00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,511
but you also have a higher risk 
   of heart attack or stroke.   

116
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,814
      Non-insulin Victoza®      
          lowers A1C,           

117
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,584
        and now reduces         
      cardiovascular risk.      

118
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,520
Victoza® lowers my              
A1C and blood sugar             

119
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,255
better than                     
the leading                     
branded pill.                   

120
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,391
             (AVO)              
      And for people with       
        type 2 diabetes         

121
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,861
treating cardiovascular disease,
    Victoza® is NOW approved    

122
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,530
   to lower the risk of major   
     cardiovascular events      

123
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,465
such as heart attack,           
stroke, or death.               

124
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,701
       And while it isn't       
        for weight loss,        

125
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,003
          Victoza® may          
   help you lose some weight.   

126
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,806
             (AVO)              
Victoza® is not for people with 
        type 1 diabetes         

127
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,541
   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

128
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,444
Do not take Victoza® if you have
  a personal or family history  

129
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,212
  of medullary thyroid cancer,  

130
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,882
       Multiple Endocrine       
   Neoplasia syndrome type 2,   

131
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,550
     or if you are allergic     
          to Victoza®           

132
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,218
   or any of its ingredients.   

133
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,721
  Stop taking Victoza® and get  
    medical help right away     

134
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,191
if you get symptoms of a serious
allergic reaction such as rash, 

135
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,493
 swelling, difficulty breathing 
         or swallowing.         

136
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,163
Serious side effects may happen,
    including pancreatitis.     

137
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,732
    So, stop taking Victoza®    
and call your doctor right away 

138
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,168
    if you have severe pain     
     in your stomach area.      

139
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,170
        Tell your doctor        
     your medical history.      

140
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,172
   Gallbladder problems have    
    happened in some people.    

141
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,507
  Tell your doctor right away   
      if you get symptoms.      

142
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,776
      Taking Victoza® with      
   a sulfonylurea or insulin    

143
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,511
   may cause low blood sugar.   

144
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,147
Common side effects are nausea, 
      diarrhea, vomiting,       

145
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,850
      decreased appetite,       
 indigestion, and constipation. 

146
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,752
          Side effects          
    can lead to dehydration,    

147
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,253
which may cause kidney problems.

148
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,622
Ask your doctor                 
about Victoza®.                 

149
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,031
Prudential asked these couples: 

150
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,867
     how much money do you      
think you'll need in retirement?

151
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,937
Then we found out how many years
  that money would last them.   

152
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:20,071
        How long do you         
      think we'll keep --       

153
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,072
    Oooooohhh! You stopped!     

154
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,608
     You're gonna leave me      
      back here at year 9?      

155
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,076
      How did this happen?      

156
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,112
      It turned out, a lot      
     of people fell short,      

157
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,114
      of even the average       
     length of retirement.      

158
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,350
     We have to think about     
 not when we expect to live to, 

159
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,785
   but when we could live to.   

160
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,956
Let's plan for income that lasts
  all our years in retirement.

>> EVERYONE SAID HIT THE FLOOR. 
SO EVERYBODY WAS LAYING ON TOP  

163
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,807
OF EACH OTHER TRYING TO GET     
AWAY.                           

164
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,077
THE SHOTS JUST KEPT COMING.     
SO WE WERE GOING DOWN.          

165
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:04,849
WHEN WE GOT DOWN, THERE WAS A   
MAN THAT WAS SHOT RIGHT THERE.  

166
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,786
THEY WERE TRYING TO TAKE HIM    
OUT.                            

167
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,921
I WAS UNCONSCIOUS.              
>> Shepard: ANOTHER WITNESS TO  

168
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:17,495
THE SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS.

173
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,947
SHE SAID THANK YOU TO THE BRAVE 
MEN AND WOMEN THAT STAYED BEHIND

174
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,716
WHEN EVERYBODY WAS RUNNING      
TERRIFIED FOR THEIR LIVES.      

175
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,554
THANK YOU TO THE MAN THAT PULLED
ME OVER THE FENCE WHEN MY BOOT  

176
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,722
WAS STUCK.                      
THANK YOU TO THE GIRLS THAT     

177
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:49,994
GRABBED ME AND RAN WITH ME WHEN 
THEY SAW I HAD BEEN SEPARATED   

178
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,130
FROM MY HUSBAND AND FRIENDS.    
THANK YOU TO THE FRIENDS THAT

00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,834
CAME AND GOT ME FROM MY PLACE OF
REFUGE EVEN WHEN THE SHOOTER WAS

TIFFANY MICHELLE IS ON THE PHONE

185
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:23,661
WITH US.                        
A LOT OF PEOPLE GAVE YOU A HAND,

186
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,462
HUH?                            
>> YES, THEY DID.               

187
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,930
SO MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT   
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT THEY    

188
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,500
WOULD BE THINKING OF HELPING    
OTHERS IN A TIME LIKE THAT.     

189
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,338
IT WASN'T ANY -- AN EVERY MAN   
FOR HIMSELF SITUATION.          

190
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,707
EVERYBODY GRABBED SOMEBODY      
AROUND THEM AND TRIED TO DO     

191
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,577
EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO GET THE
OTHERS OUT.                     

192
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,815
>> Shepard: TIFFANY, WHERE WERE 
YOU WHEN IT STARTED AND WHAT DID

193
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,185
YOU HEAR AND SEE?               
>> WE WERE ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO

194
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,988
JASON ALDEAN'S SET.             
WE WERE STANDING NEAR CENTER    

195
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:56,027
STAGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE  
STAGE.                          

196
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,762
WE WERE PROBABLY ABOUT 60, 75   
FEET AWAY FROM THE STAGE.       

197
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,733
HE HAD JUST STARTED ONE OF HIS  
SONGS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE   

198
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,470
STARTED HEARING WHAT I THOUGHT  
WERE FIRECRACKERS.              

199
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,974
I WENT ON FOR A WHILE.          
WE STARTED LOOKING AT EACH      

200
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,009
OTHER.                          
THAT'S STRANGE.                 

201
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:15,079
WHERE ARE THE FIREWORKS?        
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.           

202
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:22,553
WE SAW JASON ALDEAN'S BAND RUN  
OFF THE STAGE.                  

203
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,088
EVERYBODY STARTED GETTING ON THE
GROUND.                         

204
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:29,761
AT THIS POINT, I THOUGHT IT WAS 
FIRECRACKERS.                   

205
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:30,862
SO I HUNCHED DOWN.              
I SAID DON'T WORRY.             

206
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:31,996
IT'S OKAY.                      
IT'S JUST FIREWORKS.            

207
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:36,234
EVERYBODY WAS FREAKING OUT.     
IT WASN'T UNTIL I TURNED AROUND 

208
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:40,371
AND OUR GROUP OF SEVEN PEOPLE WE
SAW, ONE OF THE GIRLS BEHIND US 

209
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,609
HAD GOTTEN SHOT IN THE RIGHT    
SIDE OF HER CHEST.              

210
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:49,514
SHE HAD A WHITE T-SHIRT.        
YOU COULD SEE THE BLOOD OOZE    

211
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,983
OUT.                            
EVEN AT THAT POINT, I THOUGHT,  

212
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,720
OKAY, SO IT WAS GUN SHOTS.      
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAD BEEN A   

213
00:15:55,854 --> 00:16:02,627
DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AND A STRAY   
BULLET HAD GONE INTO THE CROWD. 

214
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,462
I DIDN'T REGISTER AT THAT POINT 
THAT WE WERE UNDER ATTACK.      

215
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:08,633
>> Shepard: YOU MENTIONED YOUR  
BOOT GOT STUCK.                 

216
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,903
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.             
>> AFTER THE SECOND ROUND OF    

217
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,673
SHOTS, MY HUSBAND SAID WE NEED  
TO GET OUT OF HERE.             

218
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,776
THERE WERE SOME GIRLS ON THE    
GROUND AT MY FEET.              

219
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,778
THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL IN THE    
WAY.                            

220
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,749
WE WERE JUST TRYING TO GET THE  
CROWD UP AND MOVING.            

221
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,519
WHEN WE GET TO THIS CENTER      
DIVIDE GOING DOWN THE CENTER    

222
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,724
STAGE, IT WAS LIKE A FENCE A    
METAL FENCE.                    

223
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,559
ONE MAN HOPPED OVER IN FRONT OF 
ME.                             

224
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:38,930
HE TURNED AROUND TO HELP ME.    
MY BOOT GOT STUCK ON SOMETHING  

225
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,432
ON THE GROUND.                  
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS          

226
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:47,638
UNDERNEATH PART OF THE FENCE AND
I HAD TO RUN THE REST OF THE WAY

227
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,540
WITHOUT IT.                     
>> Shepard: YOU GOT SOME HELP   

228
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,409
THERE THOUGH.                   
>> I DID, YEAH.                 

229
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,878
HE WAS VERY HELPFUL.            
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE    

230
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,980
BEEN ABLE TO GET IT UNSTOCK     
WITHOUT HIM.                    

231
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,816
I'M SO THANKFUL THAT SOMEBODY   
WAS THERE.                      

232
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,719
>> Shepard: YOU SAID THAT SORT  
OF THING KEPT HAPPENING OVER AND

233
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,221
OVER AGAIN.                     
>> YEAH.                        

234
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,893
EVERYBODY WAS -- AS WE KEPT     
RUNNING, PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO  

235
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,495
KEEP OTHER PEOPLE CALM.         
WE MADE IT TO ONE OF THE TENTS  

236
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,564
WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SERVING     
FOOD.                           

237
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,234
THERE WERE PEOPLE IN THERE.     
WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS AN  

238
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,470
ACTIVE SHOOTER ON THE GROUND.   
WE DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS        

239
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,440
FOLLOWING US WITH A GUN.        
WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD STOP AND   

240
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,810
HIDE UNDER SOMETHING.           
THERE WERE PEOPLE THERE TRYING  

241
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,813
TO KEEP EVERYBODY QUIET.        
THERE WAS ONE MAN THAT SAID, NO,

242
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,082
IT'S OKAY.                      
RUN OUT THE BACK.               

243
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,852
THAT'S WHEN EVERYBODY DECIDED TO
RUN OUT OF THE BACK OF THE TENT 

244
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:41,125
AND KEEP GOING.                 
I GOT SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP  

245
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,393
OF SEVEN THAT I WAS WITH,       
INCLUDING MY HUSBAND.           

246
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,062
I WAS RUNNING DOWN THE STREET   
AND A GROUP OF GIRLS SAW ME BY  

247
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,531
MYSELF AND ASKED ME, HEY, WHO   
ARE YOU WITH?                   

248
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,701
ARE YOU MISSING ANYBODY?        
I SAID YEAH, I CAN'T FIND MY    

249
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,104
HUSBAND.                        
THEY GRABBED ME AND TOOK ME WITH

250
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:58,042
THEM.                           
WE RAN TO THE CLOSEST MOTEL WE  

251
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,411
COULD FIND.                     
THEY HID WITH ME BETWEEN A ROW  

252
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,880
OF CARS.                        
>> Shepard: HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE  

253
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,184
TO THINK ABOUT THIS YET?        
THE LAST CALLER, YOU'VE BEEN    

254
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:14,659
THROUGH SO MUCH, YOU KNOW?      
>> REALLY HARD TO PROCESS       

255
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,893
EVERYTHING.                     
JUST GOING BACK, GETTING BACK TO

256
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,162
OUR PLACE AND WATCHING THE NEWS 
AND SEEING THE NUMBERS, JUST    

257
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:22,867
KEEP INCREASING, THE NUMBERS OF 
DEAD AND THE NUMBERS OF INJURED.

258
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,337
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT MYSELF
AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS, MY       

259
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,440
HUSBAND, MANAGED TO GET OUT     
WITHOUT ANY KIND OF INJURIES TO 

260
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:33,978
US PHYSICALLY BESIDES A COUPLE  
OF BRUISES AND SCRAPES.         

261
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,382
IT'S UNFATHOMABLE.              
I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL, SO        

262
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,818
THANKFUL THAT WE MADE IT OUT    
OKAY.                           

263
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:47,492
>> Shepard: IN THE DAYS AHEAD,  
WILL YOUR PATTERNS CHANGE?      

264
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,993
WILL YOU CHANGE ANYTHING?       
OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO BE     

265
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,231
CALM, CARRY ON?                 
>> YOU KNOW, I LOVE COUNTRY     

266
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,732
MUSIC.                          
I LOVE GOING OUT WITH FRIENDS.  

267
00:18:54,867 --> 00:19:00,938
I LOVE GOING TO CONCERTS.       
FOR ME, VEGAS, I DON'T KNOW IF  

268
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:05,610
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE FOR ME.    
YOU CAN'T LIVE YOUR LIFE IN     

269
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,745
FEAR.                           
YOU CAN'T LIVE THINKING I CAN'T 

270
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,048
GO OUT IN PUBLIC OR BIG CROWDS  
ANYMORE.                        

271
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,318
YOU HAVE TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF
WHAT HAPPENED, TRY TO JUST MOVE 

272
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:20,358
ON WITH YOUR LIFE.              
BE THANKFUL THAT YOU WERE GIVEN 

273
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,726
A SECOND CHANCE AND MAKE THE    
MOST OF YOUR LIFE WITH THAT     

274
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,060
SECOND CHANCE.                  
WE'RE STILL GOING TO GET OUT    

275
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:29,200
THERE, STILL GOING TO LIVE OUR  
LIVES AND HAVE FUN AND BE EXTRA 

276
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,470
CAUTIOUS RIGHT NOW.             
WHEN WE GO TO A BIG EVENT, WE'LL

277
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,840
HAVE A PLAN, LOOK AROUND, BE    
OBSERVANT.                      

278
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,075
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH  
OKAY.                           

279
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,811
>> Shepard: TIFFANY MICHELLE,   
REALLY NICE TO TALK TO YOU.     

280
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:45,082
GLAD YOU'RE DOING WELL AND BEST 
TO YOUR FIANCE AND ALL OF YOUR  

281
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:52,690
FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES.         
>> THANK YOU, SHEP.             

282
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:53,791
I APPRECIATE IT.                
>> Shepard: THANK YOU.          

283
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,159
IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE    
LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCES.      

284
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,428
I MEAN, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE, RIGHT?               

285
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:03,367
AND THEN SO MANY MORE WHO KNEW  
THEM CLOSELY OR WERE INTIMATELY 

286
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:08,639
INVOLVED WITH THEM IN SOME WAY  
THAT LOVED A MEMBER OF THEIR    

287
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,541
FAMILY.                         
SO MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE  

288
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,812
TENS AND THOUSANDS EVENTUALLY.  
THERE WERE REPORTS YOU SHOULD   

289
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,182
KNOW OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER AT USC
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.         

290
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:22,587
NOT TRUE.                       
WE CAN KNOCK THAT DOWN FOR YOU. 

291
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,355
THERE'S DISTURBING REPORTS ABOUT
TOM PETTY.                      

292
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,159
WE'RE NOT OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT 
THAT TMZ HAS REPORTED THAT HE'S 

293
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,962
HAD A HEART ATTACK AND MAY HAVE 
BEEN ON LIFE SUPPORT.           

294
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,898
WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT.          
WE DON'T KNOW DETAILS OF THAT.  

295
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,768
WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR SPECIFICS 
OF THAT IT'S NOT AS IF WE NOYO  

296
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,805
DON'T HAVE PHONES, TOO.         
WE'RE GETTING THESE THINGS.     

297
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,075
PART OF OUR JOB IS TO KNOCK DOWN
THINGS THAT ARE NOT TRUE.       

298
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:51,048
A, NO ACTIVE SHOOTER AT USC.    
ON TOM PETTY, WHEN WE KNOW MORE,

299
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,818
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW MORE.        
THE NEWS CONTINUES AFTER THIS.  

300
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,283
     I didn't know where I      
      was from ethnically.      

301
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,352
     So we sent that sample     
        off to Ancestry.        

302
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,290
    My Ancestry DNA results     
  are that I am 26% Nigerian.   

303
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,425
      I am just trying to       
     learn as much as I can     

304
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,560
       about my culture.        

305
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,596
      I put the Gele on my      
       head and I looked        

306
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,165
     into the mirror and I      
     was trying not to cry.     

307
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,868
      Because it's a hat,       
     but it's like the most     

308
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,736
       important hat I've       
          ever owned.

00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,924
HE WAS ON THE STAGE WHEN THE    
SHOOTING HAPPENED.

JASON ALDEAN WAS STILL PLAYING. 

340
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:37,875
WHAT IS YOUR MEMORY OF IT?      
>> MEMORY IS OF PYROTECHNICS    

341
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:49,186
MISFIRING WITH THE RAT A TAT

342
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,790
WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WHEN
THE BULLETS WERE BOUNCING OFF   

343
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,860
THE DECK OF THE STAGE.          
JASON ALDEAN'S CREW             

344
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,729
PROFESSIONALLY CLEARED HIM AND  
HIS BAND AND HIS CREW OFF THE

00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,297
STAGE.                          
THE CROWD OBVIOUSLY REALIZED    

346
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,600
WHAT WAS GOING ON WHEN THE SOUND
CUT OFF.                        

347
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:06,704

00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:15,813
WE JUMPED OFF STAGE, RIGHT      
BEHIND A CONCRETE BARRIER.      

350
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:22,620
TWO OF US HID BEHIND THAT AS THE
BULLETS WERE RICOCHETTING OFF   

351
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:23,954
THE DECK OF THE STAGE AND GOING 
THROUGH THE STAGE.              

352
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,623
SOME AT OUR FEET, SOME AROUND   
US.                             

353
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:29,960
IT JUST SEEMED TO GO ON FOREVER.
EVERY TIME IT PAUSED, WE THOUGHT

354
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:33,297
IT WOULD BE DONE AND THEN       
STARTED AGAIN.                  

355
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,033
>> Shepard: WHERE DID YOU END   
UP?                             

356
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,904
>> I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE   
OUT WHERE I'M GOING TO END UP.  

357
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,806
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS.       
CONSTANT EVOLUTION.             

358
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:48,646
WE FINALLY LEFT THE VENUE.      
FOUND SAFE HAVEN IN CHRIS YOUNG,

359
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,752
A COUNTRY SINGER.               
HE TOOK US IN AND TOOK ALL OF   

360
00:25:54,886 --> 00:26:02,393
THE MISFITS THAT HE COULD FIND  
IN HIS SUITE.                   

361
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,461
THERE WERE HOURS OF HELPING     
PEOPLE.                         

362
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:08,832
JUST TRYING TO FIND ANYBODY THAT
NEEDED HELP.                    

363
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,268
IF IT WAS JUST WITH COMFORT,    
WITH TOWELS.                    

364
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,472
THE MEDICS WERE EVERYWHERE.     
THEY WERE SO SPREAD THIN.       

365
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:19,643
EVERYBODY CHIPPED IN.           
IT WAS A GREAT EXERCISE IN      

366
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,147
HUMANITY LAST NIGHT.            
I HEAR A LOT OF RUMORS, PANIC.  

367
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:28,619
YES, WE WERE ALL PANICKED.      
EVERYBODY WANTED TO HELP.       

368
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,421
IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE EXERCISE   
LAST NIGHT DESPITE THE CHAOS.   

369
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,157
>> Shepard: STORMY WARREN FROM  
SIRIUS XM.                      

370
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,693
WE'RE SHORT ON TIME.            
I HAVE TO HIT A BREAK.          

371
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,561
THANKS SO MUCH.                 
>> YOU BET.                     

372
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,129
>> ALL OF THE BEST TO YOU AND   
YOURS.                          

373
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,800
>> SO MUCH TO GO ON THIS.

            tough...            

383
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,753
   until she got QuickBooks.    

384

 Liberty Mutual saved us almost 

388
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:45,716
 eight hundred dollars when we  

389
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:47,084
     switched our auto and      
     home insurance.            

390
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,784
 With Liberty, we could afford
