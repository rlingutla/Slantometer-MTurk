AGAINST SYRIA, A SENIOR IRANIAN

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
LAWMAKER TODAY WARNED THAT ANY

185
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
MILITARY INTERVENTION INSIDE

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SYRIA WOULD RESULT IN A REGIONAL

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WAR THAT WOULD NOT END FAVORABLY

188
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
TO THE UNITED STATES OR TO

189
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
ALLIES ACROSS THE REGION.

190
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
LESTER?

191
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> EAMON MOHYELDIN IN CAIRO,

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THANKS.
>>> WE TURN TO NBC'S DAVID

193
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
GREGORY IN WASHINGTON.

194
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS

195
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TODAY, DAVID, WHAT ARE WE

196
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
LEARNING?

197
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
>> WHAT'S CLEAR, LESTER, THERE

198
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
IS A NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE

199
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
WHITE HOUSE AFTER THIS ATTACK.

200
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THE HUMAN COSTS IN SYRIA HAVE

201
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
BECOME JUST TOO HIGH TO BEAR.

202
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
DESPITE THAT, THERE IS
DISAGREEMENT I CAN TELL YOU

203
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
AMONG THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS

204
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
ABOUT WHAT SHOULD COME NEXT.

205
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
AMONG THE QUESTIONS, WHAT IS THE

206
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR MILITARY

207
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
ACTION AND WHAT WOULD AN ATTACK

208
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ACCOMPLISH?

209
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
TRYING TO VERIFY FACTS ON THE

211
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
GROUND AND AT THIS POINT THE

212
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING LITTLE,

213
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
ONLY STRESSING THAT WHILE THE

214
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
U.S. HAS A RANGE OF OPTIONS

215
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
AVAILABLE, THE PRESIDENT WILL

216
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN A
DELIBERATE WAY RATHER THAN

217
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
PURSUE QUICK ACTION BEFORE ALL
THE FACTS ARE KNOWN.

218
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THIS

219
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WEEK'S ALLEGED CHEMICAL ATTACK

220
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
AS A "BIG EVENT WITH GRAVE

221
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
CONCERN."

222
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
RIGHT NOW THE U.S. NAVY HAS FOUR

223
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYERS IN THE

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
MEDITERRANEAN, TWO WELL WITHIN

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
FIRING RANGE OF ANY TARGETS IN
SYRIA.

226
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
DEFENSE SECRETARY HAGEL DECLINED
TO DISCUSS ANY SPECIFIC FORCED

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
MOVEMENTS, BUT HE LEFT LITTLE

228
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
DOUBT HE THINKS CHEMICAL WEAPONS

229
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WERE INVOLVED SAYING, "IT

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
APPEARS TO BE WHAT HAPPENED, USE

231
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
TAKING SHAPE.

240
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
MILITARY OFFICIALS ARE WARNING

241
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
CHAOS IN SYRIA LIKE "MOTHS TO A

244

FLAME."

245
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
YOU ADD CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE
PICTURE, AND THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
