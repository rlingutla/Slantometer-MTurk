00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
NOT NOW.
I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SILENCER

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BILL THAT APPEARED TO BE

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
SHELVED.

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
HE SAID WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
LATER.
A LOT OF TALK FOR THE NEED FOR

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
MORE GUN CONTROL.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING THAT.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT ARE SAYING,

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
WE DON'T NEED MORE GUN CONTROL

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
MEASURES.

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE SO-CALLED

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
BUMP OR SLIDE STOCKS THAT THE
SHOOTER HAD INSTALLED ON A FEW

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
RIFLES, MIGHT AS BE AS MANY AS

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
12, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO FIRE A

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE AT ALMOST

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
AUTOMATIC SPEED.

206
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THESE WERE THINGS APPROVED IN

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
2010 BY THE ATF DURING THE OBAMA

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
ADMINISTRATION.

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN CORNYN

210
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
SAYING MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
BANNING THESE.
NEWT GINGRICH WAS ON THE AIR,

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
MAYBE YOU LUMP THEM IN WITH THE

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
1934 LAW THAT BANS AUTOMATIC

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WEAPONS BY CIVILIANS.

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TOM COLE ON ANOTHER NETWORK

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SAID, THIS.
>> NO QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK

217
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
INTO THAT.

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONSES -- WHEN I

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
SAW THE CLIPS AND HEARD THE

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
FIRE, I ASSUMED HE HAD AN

221
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

222
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS

223
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE THAT CHEAPLY

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OF TRANSFORMING A SEMIAUTOMATIC

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
INTO AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
YEAH, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT

228
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THAT.

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
>> EVEN REPUBLICANS ARE

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
DESCRIBING THIS AS A LOOP HOLE,

231
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ONE THAT THEY CAN CLOSE QUICKLY.
DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE LIKE JOHN

232
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
LEWIS OUT THERE ON THE STEPS OF

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THE CAPITOL SAYING HOW MANY MORE

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED
BEFORE WE GET MORE GUN CONTROL

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
MEASURES?
THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
CLASH IN CONGRESS OVER HOW FAR

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
TO GO IN THE WAKE OF THIS
INCIDENTS.

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
AGAIN, SHEP, THE PRESIDENT
SAYING LET'S MOURN THE DEAD,

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
TEND TO THE BOUNDED AND THEN

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
LET'S HAVE THE POLITICAL

241
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
DISCUSSION, SHEP.
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE IN

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
MANDALAY BAY.
THANK YOU.

243
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THE SECRETARY OF STATE REX
TILLERSON IS NOT DENYING THAT HE

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP A

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
BLANKING MORON.

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THE SECRETARY IS INSISTING THAT
HE NEVER THREATENED TO QUIT.

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
HE'S RESPONDING TO AN NBC NEWS

248
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
REPORT THAT MIKE PENCE HAD TO

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
CONVINCE SECRETARY TILLERSON NOT

250
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
TO STEP DOWN.

251
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
>> THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
HAD TO PERSUADE ME TO REMAIN THE

253
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE I

254
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED LEAVING

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THIS POST.

256
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'M NEW TO WASHINGTON.

257
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE'S SOME

258
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THAT TRY TO SOW DISSENSION TO

259
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
ADVANCE THEIR OWN AGENDA BY

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TEARING OTHERS APART AND AN

261
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
UNDERSTOOD TO UNDERMINE THE

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
PRESIDENT'S OWN AGENDA.

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I DO NOT AND I WILL NOT OPERATE

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THAT WAY.
>> WHEN A REPORTER ASKED

265
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
SPECIFICALLY WHETHER SECRETARY

266
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TILLERSON CALLED THE PRESIDENT A
MORON, HE RESPONDED THAT HE

267
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WASN'T GOING TO DEAL WITH PETTY

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
STUFF LIKE THAT.
RICH EDSON IS AT THE STATE

269
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
DEPARTMENT.
HEATH

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
HEATHER NAUERT HAS COME FORWARD

271
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
TO DENY THAT CLAIM.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THE DAILY PRESS BRIEFING JUST

273
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WRAPPED UP.

274
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HEATHER DENIED THAT THE

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
SECRETARY OF STATE CALLED THE

276
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
PRESIDENT A MORON.

277
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
>> THE SECRETARY DOES NOT USE

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE.
THE SECRETARY DID NOT USE THAT

279
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TYPE OF LANGUAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT

280
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
STATES.

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
HE DOES NOT USE THAT LANGUAGE TO

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
SPEAK ABOUT ANYONE.

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I HOPE THAT THAT CLARIFIES IT.

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> HE NEVER SAID THAT?

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
>> HE DID NOT SAY THAT.

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> Shepard: SO THERE YOU HAVE

288
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
IT.
THE PRESIDENT NOW LIVE WITH

289
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
FIRST RESPONDERS.

290
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

291
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
LET'S LISTEN LIVE.

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
>> I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN YOU GUYS

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
ARE GOOD BUT YOU PROVED IT.

294
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HE'S A SICK, DEMENTED MAN.

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
HAVE THEY FOUND OUT ANYTHING

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
ELSE?

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>> STILL A LITTLE BIT SOON.

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD LEADS.

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THAT.
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE ANSWERS.

301
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
>> MIGHT BE SOMEBODY THERE.

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THE WIRES ARE SCREWED UP.

303
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE.

304
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
YOUR GROUP.
I WANTED TO SAY HELLO AND

306
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
CONGRATULATE YOU.

307
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I WAS A FAN BEFORE THIS.

308
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
YOU KNOW THAT.

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS

310
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
THAT.

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
A BIG FAN BEFORE THIS.

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
YOU CAN BE MORE OF A FAN, I'M

313
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
MORE OF A FAN NOW.

314
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
YOU SHOWED THE WORLD AROUND THE
WORLD WAS WATCHING AND YOU

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
SHOWED WHAT PROFESSIONALISM IS

316
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
ALL ABOUT.

317
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN TAKE

318
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
PLACE FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
HOURS.

320
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

321
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
>> A MATTER OF IDENTIFICATION,

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
OFFICER HANCOCK AT THE END TO

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
YOUR RIGHT THERE, HE WAS THE

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
FIRST SWAT OFFICER TO ENGAGE THE

326
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
INDIVIDUAL.
OFFICER DRISCOLL THERE, THE K-9

327
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
OFFICER ASSISTED.

328
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
OFFICER MORRIS WAS ONE OF THE

329
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
TWO I DESCRIBED PARTNERED WITH

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
THE SECURITY GUARDS.

331
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
>> THEY DID A GOOD JOB.

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

333
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
HIS OPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO

334
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
IT HIMSELF.

335
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU WOULDN'T

336
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
HAVE HAD THE INFORMATION MAYBE,

337
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
RIGHT?
HE DID THE RIGHT THING?

338
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
>> HE DID.

339
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WE RELIED ON THE INFORMATION.

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
>> THAT'S GREAT.

341
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
>> EVERYONE ELSE SEATED IN AND

342
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BEHIND THE PRESS THERE WERE

343
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
INTEGRAL IN SAVING NUMEROUS

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
LIVES.

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THE GENTLEMAN TO YOUR LEFT, THAT

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
FIREFIGHTER RIGHT THERE WAS OFF

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
DUTY WATCHING THE CONCERT AND

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
SAVED SEVERAL LIVES.

349
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW

350
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THAT EVERY PERSON IN HERE WAS

351
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
INSTRUMENTAL IN LIFE SAVING

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
MEASURES.
THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES HERE ARE

353
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
DISPATCHERS.

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
IF YOU EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

356
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO TRAFFIC,

357
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES ARE
AMAZING.

358
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THERE WAS A THIRD YOUNG LADY.
SHE DECIDED TO GO TO COLLEGE.

359
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
>> Shepard: PARDON THE

360
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
INTERVENTION WHILE OUR FOX

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
TELEVISION STATIONS JOIN US.

362
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
GOOD AFTERNOON FROM FOX NEWS IN

363
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
NEW YORK, A LIVE LOOK WHERE

364
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MEETING SOME

365
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
HEROS OF THE ATTACK OUTSIDE THE

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
MANDALAY BAY AT THE COUNTRY

368
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
MUSIC FESTIVAL SUNDAY NIGHT.

369
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
LET'S LISTEN LIVE.

370
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THE

371
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000

A CONCERTED EFFORT ON THE PART

416
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
OF THIS WHITE HOUSE.

417
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
GREAT TO SEE.

418
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
>> ALL THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN AND

419
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
AS PRESIDENT, SHEP, PRESIDENT

420
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
TRUMP REALLY WAS A CHAMPION OF

421
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

422
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
SO MANY CAMPAIGNED EVENTS ACROSS

423
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
THE COUNTRY, HE WOULD ALWAYS
HOLD THEM UP FOR PRAISE.

424
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
HE'S DONE THAT AGAIN AS
PRESIDENT.

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
ANY TIME HE GETS IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
MILITARY FOR THAT MATTER, HE

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
ALWAYS HAS THE HIGHEST PRAISE.

428
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I KNOW THAT HE WAS VERY TAKEN,
NOT ONLY WITH THE SCOPE AND THE

429
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
DEPTH OF THIS TRAGEDY AND THE

430
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
HORRIBLE FACT THAT SO MANY
PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

431
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
WHEN THERE WERE BULLETS RAINING

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
DOWN FROM THE WINDOWS BEHIND ME,
50, 75 AT A TIME BECAUSE HE HAD

433
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
BIG MAGAZINES, THE OFFICERS TOOK

434
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
COVER BUT MOVED TOWARD THE

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
DANGER.

436
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
THEY WERE BLOWING THE DOOR OPEN

437
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
WITHIN MINUTES TO GET INSIDE AND

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
CLEARLY HAD CORNERED THIS GUY,

439
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
THE SHOOTER.

440
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE WHEN HE

441
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
KNEW THEY WERE COMING IN THROUGH

442
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THE DOOR.
THE FACT THAT AS YOU POINTED

443
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
OUT, SO MANY CIVILIANS DOVE ON

444
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
THEIR LOVED ONES OR SACRIFICED

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THEIR OWN LIVES OR STOLE PICKUP

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
TRUCKS TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE BEDS
BECAUSE THE AMBULANCES WERE SO

447
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
OVERWHELMED.

448
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
WHEN THEY GOT TO THE HOSPITALS,

449
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THE DOCTORS AND NURSES ON STAFF

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND ALL OF THE MEDICAL STAFF

451
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
FROM ACROSS THE VALLEY HERE THAT

452
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
CAME IN TO THE TRAUMA CENTERS

453
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
AND THE HOSPITALS EVEN THOUGH

454
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THEY WERE OFF DUTY.

455
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
JUST DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO PICK UP

456
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
THE PHONE.

457
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
RAN IN TO HELP WHEN THE SCOPE

458
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
BECAME CLEAR.

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO TAKE

460
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
TIME TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THOSE

461
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
PEOPLE.

462
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
HE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE DONE AN

463
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
INCREDIBLE SERVICE FOR THEIR

464
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
COMMUNITY.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE WANTS TO

465
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
HOLD UP AS AN EXAMPLE NOT ONLY

466
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT
THE WORLD AS WELL TO SAY THIS IS

467
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
HOW WE RESPOND TO TRAGEDY IN

468
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
AMERICA AND HOPEFULLY TAKE STEPS

469
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

470
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

471
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET

472
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
INTO A REAL TUSSLE OF A DEBATE

473
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
IN CAPITOL HILL.

474
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
THERE'S GOING TO BE PEOPLE ON

475
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
ONE SAID THAT SAY WE NEED MORE

476
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
GUN CONTROL MEASURES, PEOPLE ON

477
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS THERE'S

478
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT

479
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THESE SO-CALLED PUMP STOCKS OR

480
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
SLIDE STOCKS THAT ALLOW

481
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO BE

482
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
FIRED AT A HIGH RATE OR OTHER

483
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO STOP

484
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
PEOPLE FROM CONVERTING THESE WE
POPS INTO A HIGH RATE OF FIRE.

485
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
WE DON'T NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN

486
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THAT.

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
WE NEED TO ENFORCE EXISTING

488
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
LAWS.

489
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
EVERYTHING THAT THIS FELLOW

490
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
SEEMED TO DO SHORT OF WHAT HE

491
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
DID SUNDAY NIGHT WAS WITHIN THE

492
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
LETTER OF THE LAW.

493
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
IT'S A DILEMMA HOW THAT DEBATE

494
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
WILL GO FORWARD AS TO WHAT LAW

495
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
COULD BE CRAFTED TO STOP WHAT

496
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT.

497
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
ALL OF THIS STUFF IS

498
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
RETROSPECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO

499
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
PROSPECTIVE.

500
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
YOU'RE ALWAYS REACTING TO THE

501
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
LAST INCIDENT.
IT'S DIFFICULT AND A HEATED

502
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
DEBATE GOING FORWARD, SHEP.

503
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN.

504
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
LET'S GO TO A.B. STODDARD.

505
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

506
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP.

507
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
>> Shepard: THIS DEBATE WILL

508
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
COME, THOSE ON THE GUN CONTROL

509
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
SIDE, ARE PUSHING FOR IT TODAY.

510
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
THEIR ARGUMENT IS THERE'S NO

511
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
TIME LIKE ON THE HEELS OF A

512
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
TRAGEDY TO KEEP ANOTHER TRAGEDY

513
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
FROM HAPPENING.

514
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THAT'S THEIR POSITION.

515
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
>> THEY'RE MAKING AN ARGUMENT

516
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
THAT IS REASONABLE THAT THE TIME

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS

518
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND VICTIMS
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND WANT

519
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.

520
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
IF THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK,

521
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
WE TALK ABOUT WAYS TO KEEP THE

522
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
HOMELAND SAFE FROM TERRORISTS.

523
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
SO GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES TALK

524
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
ABOUT THE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN

525
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SHOW LOOP HOLE AND LOOK AT THE

526
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
ACCESSORIES LIKE THE BUMP STOP

527
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
MECHANISM TO MAKE A

528
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC TO AN AUTOMATIC

529
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
WEAPON.
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING IN THIS

530
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
INCREDIBLY POLARIZED TIME, SHEP,

531
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
WITH THIS DEBATE THAT NEVER GOES

532
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
ANYWHERE, THAT THERE'S SOME
REPUBLICANS WILLING TO LOOK

533
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
AT -- YOU PLAYED CLIPS FROM TOM

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
COLE, THE REPUBLICAN, REPORTS

535
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THAT SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, THE

536
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
NUMBER 2 IN LEADERSHIP ON THE

537
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
SENATE SIDE IS INTERESTED.

538
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I READ THAT CONGRESSMAN BILL

539
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
FLORES FROM TEXAS IS INTERESTED

540
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
IN IT.
SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME

541
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
INCREMENTAL PATH FORWARD TO SOME

542
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING

543
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
TO DO THIS KIND OF WEAPONRY

544
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WHERE 800 ROUNDS CAN GO OFF IN A

545
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
MINUTE AND KILL SO MANY

546
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
PEOPLING.

547
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
GENERALLY SPEAKING, I'LL BE

548
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
SURPRISED IF IT DOES BECAUSE

549
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
THEY BREAK DOWN SO QUICKLY IN

550
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
ALL OF THIS POLARIZING AND ALL

551
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
OF THE DIFFERENCES AND IF DEBATE

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
GOES NOWHERE BECAUSE OF THE

553
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
VOTES AND THE WAY THEY'RE SET UP

DECK THIS AFTERNOON.

591
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I was always
"the girl with psoriasis."

592
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
People don't stare anymore.

593
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I never joined in.

594
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That wasn't fair to any of us.

595
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I was covered.

596
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I tried lots of things
over the years.

597
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But I didn't give up.

598
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I kept on fighting.

599
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I found something that worked.

600
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That still works.

601
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Now?

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000

603
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
SEE ME.

604
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I found clear skin that lasts.

605
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
See if COSENTYX could make a
difference for you-

606
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
COSENTYX is proven to help
people with moderate

607
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to severe plaque psoriasis...

608
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
...find clear skin that
can last.

609
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't use if you're allergic
to COSENTYX.

610
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Before starting COSENTYX,

611
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
you should be checked
for tuberculosis.

612
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
An increased risk of infections
and lowered ability

613
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
to fight them may occur.

614
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Tell your doctor if you have an
infection or symptoms.

615
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Or if you have received a
vaccine or plan to.

616
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
If you have inflammatory
bowel disease,

617
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
tell your doctor if symptoms
develop or worsen.

618
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Serious allergic reactions
may occur.

619
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
SEE ME
to know...

620
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
...clear skin can last.

621
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't hold back...

622
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
...ask your dermatologist if
COSENTYX can help you

623
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
find clear skin that lasts.

625
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Rodney wanted to know how his
business was doing...

626
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
...so he got QuickBooks.

627
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000

so he can see his bottom line.

IN THE WAY OF HIS PLANS.

655
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THEY KNOW

656
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THAT.
THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL US.

657
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
IN THE INTERVIEW, THEIR FACES

658
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000

ANYTHING AS WELL LIKE US.

662
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
SHE WAS SENT AWAY.

663
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
SHE WAS SENT AWAY SO THAT SHE

664
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
WOULD NOT BE THERE.

665
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000

678
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
WEAPONS FROM THREE LOCATIONS.

679
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
ONE FROM THE MANDALAY BAY BEHIND

680
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
ME AND HIS TWO HOMES, ONE IN

681
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
MESQUITE, NEVADA AND THE OTHER

682
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
ONE IN RENO, NEVADA.

683
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THOSE GUNS WORTH BETWEEN

684
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
$100,000 AND $110,000.

685
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THE SEMIAUTOMATICS ARE WORTH

686
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
BETWEEN $1,500 AND $3,000.

THEY WERE PUT ON THE FLOOR OF

690
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
THE HOTEL SWEEP IN MANDALAY BAY.
WE SHOULD KNOW THAT STEPHEN

691
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
PADDOCK HAS BEEN COLLECTING GUNS

692
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
FOR YEARS.
BUT IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE, HE

693
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
HAS AMASSED SOME 30-PLUS

694
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WEAPONS, A GUN SHOP OWNER IN

695
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
MESQUITE WHERE HE HAD A HOME

696
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SAID THAT ON SEPTEMBER 28th,

697
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
PADDOCK BOUGHT A WEAPON AND THAT

698
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
IS THE SAME DAY THAT HE CHECKED

699
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
IN TO THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL.

700
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
LISTEN TO THE GUN SHOP OWNER.

701
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
>> I WAS ILL.

702
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
MADE ME ILL TO THINK THAT WE HAD

703
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
INTERACTED WITH HIM AND HE

704
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
COMMITTED A TRAGEDY.

705
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
>> HE WENT ON THE SAY THAT HE

706
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
DID NOT SELL STEPHEN PADDOCK ANY

707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
AMMUNITION OR ANY OF THOSE BUMP

708
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
STOCKS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL

709
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
DAY LONG.

710
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
THAT'S WHAT KIND OF MAKES THE

711
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
TRIGGER TURN INTO AUTOMATICALLY

712
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
ENGAGED WEAPON, SHEP.

713
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
HE ALSO POINTS OUT AND WE SHOULD

714
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
POINT THIS OUT, THE REASON THE

715
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
BUMP STOPS ARE LEGAL IN NEVADA

716
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY

717
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
ALTER THE WEAPON.

718
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
IT'S TAKEN ON AND TAKEN OFF.

719
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
SO IT'S LEGAL NOW.

ANYTHING THAT COULD LEAD THEM TO

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
REMEMBER, THEY FOUND DOZENS AND

736
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
DOZENS OF WEAPONS INSIDE THE

737
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
HOMES THAT SHE LIVED IN WITH HIM
ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVES AND

738
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
SUITCASES OF AMMUNITION.

739
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT

740
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
SHE KNEW ABOUT THAT.

741
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
HER FAMILY SAYS THAT THE REASON

742
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
HE SENT HER TO THE PHILIPPINES

743
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
IS BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT

744
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
SHE WOULD STOP HIM FROM COMMITS

745
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THIS CRIME.

746
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
LISTEN TO THE FAMILY AGAIN.

747
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
>> NOBODY CAN PUT IT TOGETHER

748
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
EXCEPT MARILOU.

749
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
ONLY MARILOU CAN MAYBE HELP.

750
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE INTERESTED

751
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
IN THE $100,000 THAT STEPHEN

752
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
PADDOCK SENT TO PHILIPPINES IN

753
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
RECENT WEEKS.
THE SPIC YOULATION IS THAT HE

754
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
SENT IT TO HER BECAUSE HE KNEW

755
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
AS SOON AS HE COMMITTED THE

756
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
CRIME THAT ALL OF HIS ASSETS

757
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
WOULD BE LOCKED DOWN POSSIBLY

758
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
FOREVER AND SHE WOULDN'T GET ANY

759
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
KIND OF MONEY OUT OF THAT AT

760
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
ALL.
WE SHOULD KNOW THIS FBI

761
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000

762
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000

SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND STOPS

776
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS?

00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
It's OK

789
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
that everybody
ignores me
when I drive.

790
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's fine, 'cause I get
a Safe Driving Bonus Check

every six months
I'm accident-free.

792
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And I don't share it
with Mom. Right, Mom?

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Right.

00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
CELL SERVICE.

918
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
HOOKS IN TO A DIFFERENT OF CELL

919
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
NODES.

920
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE, YOU GET

921
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
PRETTY GOOD RECEPTION.

922
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
SOMETIMES INSIDE, YOU LOSE
CONNECTIVITY AND THE PICTURE

923
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
GOES FUZZY LIKE THAT.

924
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
IT'S A WAY TO BRING YOU

925
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
IMMEDIATE PICTURES FROM

926
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY WE

927
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TOO.

928
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
LATER ON WHEN WE GET THE

929
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
FEEDBACK OVER THE SATELLITE,

930
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
YOU'LL SEE THE PICTURES IN THE

931
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
ENTIRETY AND CLARITY.

932
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE

933
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
SPECIAL MENTION, SHEP, I'M TOLD

934
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
BY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WHO
SAW IT ON THE WAY HERE BEFORE WE

935
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
LANDED, WANTS TO MAKE SPECIAL

936
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
MENTION OF THE CIVILIANS WHO AT

937
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
RISK TO THEIR OWN LIVES AND SOME

938
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
OF THEM DID DIE DOING THIS,

939
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
PROTECTED OTHER PEOPLE,

940
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
PROTECTED LOVED ONES, TRIED TO

941
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE AREA, DID

942
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
WHATEVER THEY COULD TO GET

943
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
PEOPLE TO THE HOSPITALS.

944
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
THESE ARE CITIZEN HEROS, SHEP

945
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

946
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
HONOR.

947
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
WE'LL SEE THEM IN A COUPLE

948
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
MINUTES.

949
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
HE'S TOURING THE COMMAND CENTER

950
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
THERE WITH THE SHERIFF WHO HAS

951
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
DONE AMAZING WORK IN THE WAKE OF

952
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

953
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE, YOU CAN

954
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
PROBABLY COUNT ON ONE HAND THE

955
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
NUMBER OF HOURS OF SLEEP HE'S
HAD.

956
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
THE PRESIDENT TAKING THE TOUR OF
THE COMMAND CENTER, MEETING WITH

957
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE'LL

958
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HEAR FROM HIM SHORTLY WHERE HE

959
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
WILL PAY TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE
MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

960
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE

961
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AND THE CIVILIANS THAT DID THE

962
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SAME THING SUNDAY NIGHT.
SHEP?
>> Shepard: JOHN, THANKS SO

963
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
MUCH.
THE ROOM BEGINNING TO FILL WHERE

964
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL GREET THOSE

965
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
FOLKS.
THEY'VE BEEN FILLING IN THE DOOR

966
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
ON THE LEFT TO OUR LEFT SIDE OF

967
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THAT -- THE BLUE WALL BACK

968
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THERE, THE BLUE CURTAIN.

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
YOU'LL SEE MORE COMING IN NOW.
IT'S OUR BELIEF THE PRESIDENT IS

970
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ON HIS WAY RIGHT NOW.

971
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
THE OTHER STORY OF THE DAY HAS
BEEN THE REPORTS ON SECRETARY

972
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
TILLERSON.
IT WAS BACK IN THE SUMMER THAT

973
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
CNN REPORTED AND NBC REPORTED

974
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
OVERNIGHT AND INTO THIS MORNING,

975
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I THINK THEY DEBUTED IT ON

976
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
MORNING JOE, THAT REX TILLERSON

977
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
SAID I'M DONE, I'M GOING TO

978
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
TEXAS.
BUT THE PRESIDENT INTERVENED IN

979
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
SOME WAY AND IT NEVER HAPPENED.

980
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
NOW SECRETARY TILLERSON HAS SAID

981
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
NONE OF THAT HAPPENED, IT'S FAKE

982
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
NEWS.

983
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
NBC NEWS STANDS BY ITS
REPORTING.

984
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
WITH THAT, WE RETURNED TO A.B.

985
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
STODDARD.

986
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF

987
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
THIS.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I

988
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
TRIED TO QUIT AROUND HERE.

989
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
EVERYBODY HAS BAD DAYS.

990
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF

991
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THIS.

992
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
SECRETARY TILLERSON SAYS IT'S

993
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
FAKE NEWS.
NBC NEWS STANDS BY IT.

994
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO MAKE OF IT.

995
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

996
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
REPORTING BETWEEN THE TENSION OF
THE WEST WING AND THE WHITE

997
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
HOUSE.

998
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
REX TILLERSON WAS THE MOST

999
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD, HEAD

1000
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
OF EXXON MOBIL.

1001
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE REPORTERS

1002
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND ASKING HIM

1003
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
QUESTIONS IN HIS OLD LIFE ABOUT

1004
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
GLOBAL CONFRONTATIONS, HAVING TO

1005
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
DO WITH NATIONAL SECURITY.

1006
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
HE'S NOT TOTALLY AT EASE IN ALL

1007
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THE ASPECTS OF THE JOB BUT HE

1008
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
MADE COMMENTS TODAY THAT WERE

1009
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
VERY COMPELLING ABOUT HIS

1010
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
COMMITMENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND

1011
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND THAT

1012
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
AS A TEAM THEY'LL STICK

1013
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
TOGETHER.
THEY'VE HAD SUCCESS.

1014
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
HE COMPLIMENTED NIKKI HALEY THAT

1015
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
SAID WOULD REPLACE HIM IF HE

1016
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
LEFT.
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

1017
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS BEEN

1018
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
PERFORMING A JOB THAT PRESIDENT

1019
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
TRUMP APPROVES OF.

1020
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
THAT HE'S BEEN SLOW TO HIRE --

1021
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
>> Shepard: THAT WAS THE POINT.

1022
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
>> HE'S NOT DOING THINGS THE WAY

1023
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS HIM

1024
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
TO BE DOING THEM.

1025
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
BUT ALL THIS GOSSIP ABOUT WHAT

1026
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
HE'S CALLED THE PRESIDENT AND

1027
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
ALL OF THAT STUFF OBVIOUSLY GETS

1028
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
TO THE TOP OF THE HEADLINES.
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

1029
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
SITUATION.

1030
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
ALSO BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SENT

1031
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
OUT A TWEET UNDERMINING HIM

1032
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SAYING HIS WASTING HIS TIME IN

1033
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
CHINA TALKING ABOUT HOW WE HAVE

1034
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
PASSIVE NEGOTIATION OR DIALOGUE

1035
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.

1036
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
HE'S WORKING ON A DIPLOMATIC

1037
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
SOLUTION TO A GRAVE CRISIS.

1038
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
MANY PEOPLE SAID ON SUNDAY LIKE

1039
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
RICHARD HAAS, REPUBLICAN FOREIGN

1040
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
POLICY EXPERT WITH EXPERIENCE,

1041
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THAT REX TILLERSON SHOULD RESIGN

1042
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
AFTER THE WAY THE PRESIDENT

1043
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
SPOKE ABOUT HIM.

1044
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
IT'S OBVIOUSLY FILLED WITH

1045
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
TENSION AND THEY BOTH SOUNDED

1046
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
LIKE THEY WANT TO WORK.

1047
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
THE VERY UPBEAT IS HONORED BY

1048
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
TILLERSON'S COMMENTS, BUT

1049
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
THERE'S MORE BEHIND THE SCENES

1050
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THAN WE UNDERSTOOD.

1051
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
>> Shepard: THERE'S A LOT THERE.

1052
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
WE HEAR FROM THE STATE

1053
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS THAT

1054
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
THERE'S GREAT CONCERN AND GREAT

1055
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
FRUSTRATIONS THAT THE POSITIONS

1056
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
HAVE NOT BEEN FILLED.

1057
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
ON THE MATTER OF THE PRESIDENT'S

1058
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
TWEET REGARDING SECRETARY

1059
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
TILLERSON IN NORTH KOREA, THE

1060
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
PRESIDENT SAID DON'T WASTE YOUR

1061
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
TIME, SECRETARY TILLERSON.
WE'RE GOING TO NEED WHAT NEEDS

1062
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
TO BE DONE.

1063
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
IN OTHER WORDS, STOP YOUR

1064
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
DIPLOMACY.

1065
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
IT'S HIS JOB TO HEAD UP THE

1066
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
DIPLOMACY.
A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE

1067
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
VERY UPSET ABOUT WHAT IT WAS

1068
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETED

1069
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
BECAUSE IF HE MEANT IT, IT'S

1070
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
HARD TO SAY THAT HE MEANT

1071
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
ANYTHING OTHER THAN WE'RE GOING

1072
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

1073
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT

1074
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
SOMETHING AGGRESSIVE.

1075
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
>> ALSO JUST WHAT IT SHOWS TO

1076
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THE CHINESE WHEN REX TILLERSON

1077
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IS

1078
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
OVER IN CHINA DOING THIS VERY

1079
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
DIFFICULT WORK.
THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE WORK.

1080
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
WHAT IT SHOWS WITH THE PRESIDENT

1081
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
UNDERMINING HIM AND THROWING HIM

1082
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
UNDER THE BUS AND UNDERMINING

1083
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIPLOMACY

1084
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
SENDS A WORRISOME SIGNAL ABOUT

1085
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
HOW HE'S TREATING REX TILLERSON

1086
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
AND HOW HE'S HANDLING THE

1087
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
PROCESS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE'S

1088
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
ASKING THE CHINESE TO DO TO TRY

1089
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
TO MITIGATE THE THREAT OF NORTH

1090
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
KOREA.

1091
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
WE VERY MUCH OBVIOUSLY DEPEND ON

1092
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
THE CHINESE IN THIS SITUATION.

1093
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO HIS CREDIT

1094
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
HAS GOTTEN THE CHINESE

1095
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
GOVERNMENT TO STOP ALL CENTRAL

1096
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
BANK ACTIVITY WITH THE NORTH

1097
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
KOREANS.
THAT'S A HUGE STEP.

1098
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE

1099
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
GREAT -- COULD BE CONSEQUENTIAL

1100
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
IF THEY ACTUALLY ENFORCE IT.

1101
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
BUT IT'S A REAL QUESTION ABOUT

1102
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
NOT ONLY TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP WHEN

1103
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
HE DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT

1104
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
TWEET, BUT HOW LONG PEOPLE THAT

1105
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
WORK UNDERNEATH HIM AND REPORT

1106
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
TO HIM CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO

1107
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
DO THEIR JOBS IF THEY'RE TREATED

1108
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THAT WAY.

1109
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL JOB.

1110
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
BEING SECRETARY OF STATE AND
TRYING TO HANDLE THE NORTH KOREA

1111
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
CRISIS IS AT THE TOP OF THE

1112
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
LIST.
>> Shepard: THERE'S A LOT ON THE

1113
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
PLATE TODAY.
NOW THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE

1114
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
ROUNDS OUT IN LAS VEGAS AND

1115
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS

1116
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
GUN CONTROL AT A LATER DAY.

1117
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

1118
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
SUGGESTED OVER TIME PRESIDENT

1119
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
TRUMP THAT USED TO BE MUCH MORE

1120
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
LIBERAL IN MANHATTAN WAS --

1121
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE FOR GUN

1122
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
CONTROL AT A TIME BEFORE HIS

1123
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
PRESIDENCY.
I KNOW BECAUSE I READ THE MAIL

1124
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
AND STUFF THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

1125
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
CONSERVATIVES CONCERNED THAT HE

1126
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
MIGHT BECOME MORE PRO GUN

1127
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
CONTROL IN THE DAYS AHEAD.

1128
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
>> THE SUPPORTERS THAT PUT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN OFFICE ARE

1129
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
LITTLE CONCERNED THAT HE'S NOT

1130
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
GOTTEN OUT OF THE TRADE

1131
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
AGREEMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE TRANS

1132
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.

1133
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
HE'S PUT MORE TROOPS IN

1134
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
AFGHANISTAN.
AND THAT HE WAS WILLING TO TALK

1135
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
ABOUT DOING AN AGREEMENT ON

1136
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
IMMIGRATION WITH THE DEMOCRATIC

1137
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
LEADERS IN CONGRESS.

1138
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN

1139
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
ABOUT HIS UNPREDICTABILITY AND

1140
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
WHETHER OR NOT HE IS MORE TO A

1141
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
SET OF IDEALOGICAL PRINCIPLES

1142
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THAT HE WILL STICK TO AS

1143
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
PRESIDENT.
HE'S ON THE RECORD IN THE PAST

1144
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
BEING SUPPORTING GUN CONTROL.

1145
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
HE'S A WILD CARD, SHEP.

1146
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL

1147
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
HAPPEN WITH HIM.

1148
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
IF HE CREATES A BRIDGE,

1149
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN.

1150
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
>> Shepard: WE'LL SEE.

1151
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
HE SAYS HE WILL DISCUSS IT IN

1152
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THE DAYS AHEAD.

1153
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AS THAT HAPPENS, WE'LL FOLLOW

1154
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
THE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY COME.

1155
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
IN ONCE AGAIN, FOX TELEVISION

1156
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION WILL

1157
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
JOIN US RIGHT NOW.

1158
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
GOOD AFTERNOON FROM FOX NEWS IN

1159
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
NEW YORK.

1160
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'M SHEPARD SMITH.

1161
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THE PRESIDENT THIS AFTERNOON IS

1162
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
IN LAS VEGAS WHERE HE'S ABOUT TO

1163
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS.
THESE ARE POLICE CHIEFS, FIRE

1164
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
OFFICIALS AND OTHERS THAT WERE

1165
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
INSTRUMENTAL IN ENDING THE
MASSACRE THAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE

1166
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
THE MANDALAY BAY AND LUXOR

1167
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
HOTELS ON THE STRIP DURING THE

1168
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL.

1169
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
59 KILLED.

1170
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DEATH

1171
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
TOLL.

1172
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
THE GUNMAN DIED, ACCORDING TO

1173
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
AUTHORITIES, KILLED HIMSELF.

1174
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
THERE'S 59 OTHERS THAT HAVE DIED

1175
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AS ANOTHER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL.

1176
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
THAT BRINGS THE DEATH TOLL TO

1177
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
59.

1178
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
MORE THAN 540 INJURED.

1179
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
THE PRESIDENT SPREADING THE LOVE
OF THE PEOPLE AND THANKS FROM

1180
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
THE WHITE HOUSE AND FROM THE

1181
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
AMERICAN FEEL IN LAS VEGAS.

1182
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
ABOUT A MINUTE AGO, WE GOT A

1183
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
TWO-MINUTE WARNING ON THIS.

1184
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
OUR VIEWERS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL

1185
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
HAVE BEEN LISTENING DELONG AS WE

1186
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
DISCUSS THE OTHER NEWS ITEMS OF

1187
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
THE DAY.

1188
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR.

1189
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
WE'VE SEEN HIM AT THREE

1190
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
DIFFERENT APPEARANCES IN

1191
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
LAS VEGAS SINCE HE ARRIVED A FEW

1192
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SHORT HOURS AGO.

1193
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
HE AND THE FIRST LADY ARE THERE.

1194
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
THE ORDER OF THE DAY HAS BEEN TO

1195
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
THANK PEOPLE TO ALLOW THEM TO

1196
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
TELL THEIR STORIES OF WHAT

1197
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
HAPPENED DURING THE MASSACRE.

1198
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ORDINARY

1199
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
PEOPLE STEP FORWARD AND BECOME

1200
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS OR WE

1201
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
LEARNED OF THEIR EXTRAORDINARY

1202
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
FORTITUDE AS THEY HELPED PEOPLE

1203
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
OUT, STORIES OF PEOPLE PUTTING

1204
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
FOLKS IN THE BACK OF THEIR

1205
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
TRUCKS TO TAKE THEM TO

1206
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
HOSPITALS.
PEOPLE PLUGGING WOUNDS, STOPPING

1207
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
BLOOD FROM FLOWING OUT OF

1208
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
PEOPLE'S BODIES.

1209
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
THERE'S NO TELLING SPECIFICALLY

1210
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SAVED AS A

1211
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE

1212
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
THAT WERE NOT DOCTORS.

1213
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THEY WERE JUST PEOPLE THAT
STEPPED IN TO TRY TO HELP AT A

1214
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
MOMENT'S NOTICE.
JOHN ROBERTS IS THERE.

1215
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
HE'S THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

1216
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
CORRESPONDENT.
JOHN, A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED

1217
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
REST IN THAT CITY, ESPECIALLY

1218
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
THE ONES WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO

1219
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
HAVE BEEN MIGHTY GLAD TO SEE THE

1220
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
PRESIDENT.

1221
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL

1222
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
FATIGUE, EITHER.

1223
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
THE MENTAL FATIGUE AS WELL.

1224
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
LIVING EVERY DAY WITH WHAT

1225
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT AND IT

1226
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
SPREADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

1227
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD

1228
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
HAVE BEEN VISITORS FROM OUT OF

1229
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
TOWN HERE FOR THE WEEKEND AND

1230
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
JUST WANTED TO ENJOY SOME

1231
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
COUNTRY MUSIC AND JASON ALDEAN

1232
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
PACKING IN A CROWD OF 22,000

1233
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
PEOPLE.
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT WAS GOING

1234
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
ON IN THE CONCERT WHEN FROM THE

1235
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
32nd FLOOR WINDOWS BEHIND ME,

1236
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
THIS GUY PADDOCK TOOK THE

1237
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT WERE

1238
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
CONVERTED TO FEAR NEW HAMPSHIRE

1239
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
AUTOMATIC RATE OF FIRE AND START

1240
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
RAINING HELLFIRE DOWN UPON

1241
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
PEOPLE THERE JUST LISTENING TO

1242
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
MUSIC.

1243
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
SO MANY OF THEM RAN FOR THE EXIT

1244
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
AS YOU WOULD EXPECT AS MANY

1245
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
PEOPLE WOULD.

1246
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
MANY OF THEM FELL TO THE GROUND

1247
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
MORE TALLY WOUNDED OR SERIALLY

1248
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
WOUNDED.

1249
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
AND MANY DECIDED THEY WOULD

1250
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
STAND AND HELP PEOPLE.

1251
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
YOU CAN IMAGINE IN A STATE OF

1252
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
FEAR AND SHOCK THAT THEY WOULD

1253
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
DO THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY.

1254
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL

1255
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
PAY TRIBUTE TOO.

1256
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
>> Shepard: WE'RE WATCHING THE

1257
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
CROWD MAKE ITS WAY IN THE ROOM.

1258
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TOURING

1259
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
THE COMMAND FACILITY THERE.

1260
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
THIS IS A LAS VEGAS POLICE

1261
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
DEPARTMENT COMMAND FACILITY.

1262
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE

1263
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
INFORMATION FROM LAS VEGAS

1264
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
POLICE, AND THEY CALL THEM METRO

1265
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
THERE, THAT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING

1266
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
ABOUT, THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE

1267
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
THE CALLS WERE INCOMING.

1268
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT ON

1269
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
THE PHONE CALLING THE POLICE

1270
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
DEPARTMENT.

1271
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
AND THEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

1272
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
ITSELF TRYING TO ORGANIZE ALL OF

1273
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
THE FIRST RESPONDERS COMING.

1274
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
AT ONE POINT WE HEARD ON POLICE

1275
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
RADIOS THEM TELLING PEOPLE TO

1276
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
GET OFF OF NORTH LAS VEGAS

1277
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
BOULEVARD BECAUSE THEY REALIZED

1278
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
WHERE THE SHOTS WERE COMING FROM

1279
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
IN THE NORTH TOWER OF MANDALAY

1280
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
BAY.
BUT THE POLICE AT THE TIME SAID,

1281
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
YOU KNOW, DON'T USE THAT HIGHWAY

1282
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SIGHT OF HIM.

1283
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT

1284
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS ARRIVING

1285
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
TO HELP IN THIS SITUATION WOULD

1286
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
BECOME VICTIMS.

1287
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
WE KNOW A NUMBER OF LAW

1288
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT WERE

1289
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000

1292
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
EIGHT I BELIEVE FROM THE STATE

1293
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000

1294
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
JURISDICTIONS.

1295
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
DIFFERENT POLICE DEPARTMENTS

1296
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE INJURED.

1297
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
THE AUTHORITIES TOLD US THIS

1298
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
MORNING THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE

1299
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
TO IDENTIFY ALL BUT THREE OF THE

1300
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
VICTIMS.

1301
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
SADLY THEY REPORTED TO US SOME

1302
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000

IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL

1308
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000

00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1311
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
THEY DISCUSS HOW THE HALLWAYS,

1312
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
THE TRAUMA CENTER AND THE OTHER

1313
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
HOSPITALS IN THE AREA WERE JUST

1314
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
LITERALLY OVERFLOWING WITH

1315
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
PEOPLE.

1316
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
MEDICAL -- SOME PEOPLE GETTING

1317
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
OUT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BEDS TO

1318
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS THAT WERE

1319
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
MORE GRAVELY WOUNDED.

1320
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
THE SAME IN AMBULANCES AS THEY

1321
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
WERE LOADING PEOPLE IN

1322
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
AMBULANCES TO TAKE THEM TO

1323
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
HOSPITALS FROM THE SHOOTING

1324
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
SCENE.

1325
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
WE GOT WORD OF I DON'T KNOW HOW

TRANSPORTED VICTIMS TO THE
HOSPITALS IN VANS, TRUCKS.

00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
SOME PEOPLE INJURED THEMSELVES

1329
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
HELPING TO STOP THE BLEEDING OF
OTHER PEOPLE.

1330
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THE STORIES ARE ENDLESS OF MAN

1331
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
AND WOMAN HELPING MAN AND WOMAN.

1332
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
THERE WERE TEENAGERS INVOLVED

1333
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
THERE AS WELL.
A MATT RUSH TO TRY TO GET OUT.

1334
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
DIFFERENT PEOPLE TELLING STORIES

1335
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000

1336
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000

THE EXITS WHERE THE HUGE CROWDS.

1339
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
THINK OF WHEN YOU EXIT A CONCERT

1340
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
VENUE HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO STAND
AND WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET UP

1341
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
THE AISLES IN CASES LIKE THAT

1342
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
WHERE THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER

1343
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
SHOOTING DOWN FROM THE 32nd

1344
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
FLOOR.
WELL, THEY WERE IN MANY CASES

1345
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
JUST DEFENSELESS AND OUT IN THE

1346
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
WIDE OPEN.

1347
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000

SHORT.

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
THERE WAS A MEMORIAL LAST NIGHT

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000

00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
FOR HER WHILE HE HELPED OTHER

OVER 1,500 PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON

1397
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000

HUGGED ONE ANOTHER.
WE HELD HANDS.

1400

FRONT OF US TO SHOW TRIBUTE TO

1402
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000

I SAW AND WE ALL SAW THE

1407
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
GREATEST DARKNESS CAN'T PUT OUT

1408
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
THE SMALLEST LIGHT.

1416
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
HEALING.

1417
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF

1418
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
PULLING TOGETHER.

1419
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
YES, WE'RE HURT, WE'RE HURT

1420
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
BADLY, BUT WE'RE NOT BROKEN.

1421
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
AS I SAID, WE'VE SEEN GENEROSITY

1422
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
ON A SCALE THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED

1423
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
IN NEVADA HISTORY.

1424
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL NEVER EVER

1425
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
FORGET THIS HORRIFIC EVENT.

1426
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
WE WILL MARCH FORWARD AS A

1427
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
FAMILY, GIVING EACH OTHER

1428
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
COMFORT, SUPPORT AND LOVE.

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
FUTURE WILL COME ONE DAY AT A

1430
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
TIME.
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE HOW WE'RE

1431
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
GOING TO LIVE EACH DAY.

1432
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WE MUST BE GLAD, WE MUST BE

1433
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
GOOD, WE MUST BE BRAVE.

1434
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000

00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
KINDER, BETTER STATE AND NATION.

1437
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
GOD BLESS THE VICTIMS AND THEIR

1491
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
THE MASS MURDER TOOK PLACE

1492
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
SUNDAY NIGHT FILLS AMERICA'S

1493
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
HEART WITH GRIEF.

1494
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN

1495
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
MOURNING.

1496
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I VISITED THE HOSPITAL EARLIER

1497
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000

1498
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000

00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
WOUNDS.

1500
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
WE ASK GOD TO EASE THEIR

1501
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
SUFFERING.
WE PRAY FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE

1502
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000

1503
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
OFFICERS THAT SO BRAVELY THROUGH

1505
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000

1506
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000

1508
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000

00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
BED IN A WORLD THAT IS SUDDENLY

1510
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
EMPTY, THE PEOPLE THEY SO DEARLY

1511
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
LOVE WERE TORN AWAY FROM THEM

1512
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
FOREVER.
OUR SOULS ARE STRIKEN WITH GRIEF

1513
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000

1514
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
HUSBAND OR A WIFE, A MOTHER OR A

00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE.

1521
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
HERE AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

1522
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
WE REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN WHO

1523
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
DIED THIS WEEK, CHARLES

1524
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
HARTFIELD.
HE WAS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL

1525
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
PERSON.
OFFICER HARTFIELD WAS A PROUD

1526
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
VETERAN, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, A

1527
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
LOVING FATHER.

1528
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
HIS DEATH IS A TRAGIC LOSS FOR

1529
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
THIS POLICE FORCE, FOR THIS CITY

1530
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
AND FOR OUR GREAT NATION.

1531
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
WE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORDS TO

1532
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN HOW SUCH

1533
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
EVIL CAN EXIST, HOW THERE CAN BE

1534
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
SUCH CRUELTY AND SUCH SUFFERING.

1535
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
WE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE EVIL

1536
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
THAT THREATENINGS US OR THE

1537
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
VIOLENCE THAT INCITES SUCH

1538
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
TERROR.
WE'RE DEFINED BY THE LOVE, OUR

1539
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
CARING AND OUR COURAGE.

1540
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS, WHAT

1541
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
SHINES MOST BRIGHTLY IS THE

1542
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
GOODNESS THAT THRIVES IN THE

1543
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE.

1544
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
THAT GOODNESS IS OUR LIGHT HOUSE

1545
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
AND OUR SOLACE.

1546
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
IS KNOWLEDGE.
THAT THE SOULS OF THOSE THAT

1547
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
PASSED ARE NOW AT PEACE IN

1548
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
HEAVEN.
HERE ON EARTH, WE'RE BLESSED TO

1549
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
BE SURROUNDED BY HEROS.

1550
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
AS ONE EYE WITNESS RECOUNTED

1551
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
THIS WEEK, WHILE EVERYONE ELSE

1552
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
WAS CROUCHING, POLICE OFFICERS

1553
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
WERE STANDING UP AS TARGETS JUST

1554
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
TRYING TO DISTRICT PEOPLE AND

1555
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
TELL THEM WHERE TO GO.

1556
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING UP IN

1557
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
THE LINE OF FIRE TO HELP THOSE

1558
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
IN DANGER AND TO FIND OUT WHERE

1559
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
THOSE HORRIBLE SHOTS WERE COMING

1560
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
FROM.
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE

1561
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
BRAVERY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD

1562
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

1563
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
AMERICANS DENIED DEATH AND

1564
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH

1565
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
COURAGE.

1566
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
WHEN THE WORD AND WORST OF

1567
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
HUMANITY STRIKES, THE BEST OF

1568
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
HUMANITY RESPONDS.

1569
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
PARENTS AND SPOUSES USED THEIR
OWN BODIES AS SHIELDS TO PROTECT

1570
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
LOVES ONES.

1571
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
AMERICANS DASHED INTO A HAIL OF
BULLETS TO RESCUE TOTAL

1572
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
STRANGERS.
JOINING US TODAY ARE MANY OF THE

1573
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000

1574
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000

1581
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I JUST VISITED HIM IN THE

1582
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
HOSPITAL.
WITHIN MINUTES, HE JOINED A

1583
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
GROUP OF OFFICERS RUSHING

1584
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
BETWEEN FLYING BULLETS TO CLEAR

1585
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
THE FAIR GROUNDS AND SAVE LIVES.

1586
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000

1587
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
