[000:09:36;29] >> Jon: WILLIAM LA  
[000:09:37;18] JEUNESSE, THANK YOU.  
[000:09:38;08] AMERICA NEEDS TO PAY  
[000:09:38;28] ATTENTION TO THOSE REPORTS  
[000:09:39;21] OF A MASSIVE AND DEADLY  
[000:09:41;29] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN  
[000:09:43;24] SYRIA.  
[000:09:44;07] THAT'S THE WORD FROM  
[000:09:44;27] PRESIDENT OBAMA.  
[000:09:45;15] BUT HE ALSO EXPLAINED WHY  
[000:09:46;08] IT COULD HURT US BIG TIME  
[000:09:47;05] IF THE U.S. GETS TOO  
[000:09:49;18] INVOLVED.  
[000:09:50;13] PLUS, A GRIM MILESTONE ON  
[000:09:51;23] THE NUMBER OF CHILD  
[000:09:53;24] REFUGEES NOW TRYING TO

[000:09:56;10] WAR.  
[000:09:56;22] THAT'S STILL AHEAD ON "THE

[000:10:29;24] THIS MAN IS ABOUT TO BE  THE MILLIONTH
[000:10:30;15] CUSTOMER.  WOULD YOU MIND IF  I GO
[000:10:32;00] AHEAD OF YOU?
[000:10:32;22] INSTEAD WE HAD SOMEONE  GO AHEAD OF
[000:10:33;13] HIM
[000:10:34;21] AND WIN FIY THOUSAND DOLLARS.
[000:10:38;05] CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE  OUR ONE MILLIONTH

[000:10:59;15] When you realize you need  to switch
[000:11:00;07] to Verizon  it's a reality check.
[000:11:02;03] I had my  reality check when
[000:11:04;07] I'd be sitting there  with my friends
[000:11:05;11] who had their Verizon phones  and
[000:11:06;01] I'd be sitting there like
[000:11:08;11] "mine's still loading!"
[000:11:09;05] I couldn't get email.
[000:11:09;27] I couldn't stream movies.
[000:11:10;25] I couldn't upload  any of our music.
[000:11:12;06] That's when I decided  to switch.
[000:11:13;08] Now that I'm on Verizon,  everything
[000:11:13;29] moves fast.
[000:11:15;13] With Verizon  I have that reliability.
[000:11:17;02] I'm completely happy  with Verizon.
[000:11:18;14] Verizon's 4G LTE  is the most reliable
[000:11:20;25] and in more places than  any other
[000:11:21;16] 4G network.
[000:11:23;15] Period.
[000:11:24;01] That's powerful.  Verizon.

[000:13:06;28] PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING  
[000:13:08;24] CLEAR IS HE IN NO RUSH TO  
[000:13:09;17] GET THE U.S. MILITARY  
[000:13:10;08] INVOLVED IN SYRIA'S  
[000:13:10;28] 2-YEAR-OLD CIVIL WAR EVEN  
[000:13:11;21] AMID MOUNTING CLAIMS THE  
[000:13:12;24] SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGAIN  
[000:13:13;27] USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS  
[000:13:14;24] AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE THE  
[000:13:17;13] SITUATION IN SYRIA IS VERY  
[000:13:19;00] DIFFICULT.  
[000:13:19;15] AND THE NOTION THAT THE  
[000:13:20;11] U.S. CAN SOMEHOW SOLVE WHAT  
[000:13:23;13] IS A SECTARIAN, COMPLEXED  
[000:13:26;08] PROBLEM INSIDE OF SYRIA  
[000:13:28;04] SOMETIMES IS OVERSTATED.  
[000:13:29;14] >> BUT DELAY CAN BE DEADLY,  
[000:13:31;01] RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT.  
[000:13:31;26] >> THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT  
[000:13:34;10] WHEN YOU START SEEING  
[000:13:36;25] CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED ON A  
[000:13:38;17] LARGE SCALE AND AGAIN  
[000:13:40;22] WE'RE STILL GATHERING  
[000:13:41;20] INFORMATION ABOUT THIS  
[000:13:42;14] PARTICULAR EVENT BUT IT IS  
[000:13:43;29] VERY TROUBLESOME.  
[000:13:45;21] >> Jon: WHITE HOUSE  
[000:13:46;11] OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS A  
[000:13:47;04] HIGH LEVEL MEETING  
[000:13:47;23] YESTERDAY TO DISCUSS  
[000:13:48;21] AMERICA'S OPTIONS.  
[000:13:49;15] OF COURSE, ALL THIS IS  
[000:13:51;00] UNFOLDING AS THE PRESIDENT  
[000:13:52;02] WRAPS UP A TWO-DAY BUS TOUR  
[000:13:54;13] THROUGH NEW YORK AND  
[000:13:55;07] PENNSYLVANIA TO TALK ABOUT  
[000:13:56;02] HIS PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY.  
[000:13:58;03] ED HENRY IS TRAVELING WITH

[000:14:01;07] PENNSYLVANIA NOW.  
[000:14:02;03] ED?  
[000:14:02;15] >> WELL JON, YOU ARE  
[000:14:03;20] RIGHT.  
[000:14:04;03] THIS BUS TOUR WAS SUPPOSED  
[000:14:05;08] TO BEEN ALL ABOUT DOMESTIC  
[000:14:07;22] ISSUES.  
[000:14:08;06] ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE  
[000:14:09;02] THE PRESIDENT FACING A  
[000:14:10;05] CREDIBILITY TEST.  
[000:14:10;27] ONE WEEK AGO THIS WEEK THAT  
[000:14:12;03] HE DREW THAT RED LINE ON  
[000:14:13;16] CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SARA I  
[000:14:14;12] CAN'TENNED A PROMISED THERE  
[000:14:15;22] WOULD BE ENORMOUS  
[000:14:17;08] CONSEQUENCES IF SYRIA  
[000:14:17;29] CROSSED THAT RED LINE.  
[000:14:19;02] NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN  
[000:14:20;13] CROSSED SEVERAL TIMES AND  
[000:14:21;12] POSSIBLY YET AGAIN THIS  
[000:14:22;05] WEEK WITH A MASSIVE  
[000:14:24;03] CHEMICAL ATTACK THAT KILLED  
[000:14:24;29] UP TO 1800 PEOPLE.  
[000:14:26;12] IS HE UNDER PRESSURE TO ACT  
[000:14:28;26] IN THAT CNN INTERVIEW THAT  
[000:14:30;29] YOU REFERRED TO THE  
[000:14:32;04] PRESIDENT LASHED OUT AT  
[000:14:33;05] SYRIA OVER THIS ALLEGED  
[000:14:34;13] ATTACK, SAID HE IS STILL  EVIDENCE
[000:14:36;01] TO  
[000:14:36;14] COME IN.  
[000:14:36;28] STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING HE  
[000:14:38;01] WOULD USE MILITARY ACTION  
[000:14:39;04] LEADING TO CONSERVATIVES TO  
[000:14:40;08] CHARGE THAT HE IS DODDLING.  
[000:14:42;06] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:14:43;06] >> JUMPING IN TO STUFF THAT  
[000:14:45;18] DOES NOT TURN OUT WELL.  
[000:14:48;00] GETS US MIRED IN VERY  
[000:14:49;10] DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.  
[000:14:50;23] CAN RESULT IN US BEING  
[000:14:53;09] DRAWN IN TO VERY EXPENSIVE,  
[000:14:57;07] DIFFICULT, COSTLY  
[000:14:59;07] INTERVENTIONS THAT ACTUALLY  
[000:15:00;02] BREED MORE RESENTMENT IN  
[000:15:01;17] THE REGION.  
[000:15:02;03] WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH  
[000:15:03;14] STRATEGICALLY WHAT'S GOING  
[000:15:04;09] TO BE IN OUR LONG-TERM  
[000:15:05;21] NATIONAL INTEREST EVEN AS  
[000:15:06;26] WE WORK COOPERATIVELY  
[000:15:08;22] INTERNATIONALLY TO DO  
[000:15:09;13] EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT  
[000:15:10;05] PRESSURE ON THOSE WHO WOULD  
[000:15:11;24] KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS.  
[000:15:12;25] >> THE POLICY IS FOCUSED  
[000:15:14;08] AROUND NOT GETTING INVOLVED  
[000:15:19;24] SO FAR 100,000 DEAD MOSTLY  
[000:15:22;18] KILLED BY BULLETS OR  
[000:15:24;05] WHISTLES.  
[000:15:24;20] HARD TO SAY HOW 1,000 OR  
[000:15:26;12] COUPLE HUNDRED DEAD FROM A  
[000:15:28;29] CHEMICAL WEAPON WHILE  
[000:15:31;04] DEPLORABLE WOULD IMPACT HIS  
[000:15:32;18] CALCULUS.  
[000:15:33;03] >> NOW, WHAT'S NEXT?  
[000:15:33;23] THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY  
[000:15:34;21] RULED OUT U.S. GROUND  
[000:15:35;27] TROOPS IN SARA I CAN'T.  
[000:15:37;03] BUT I'M TOLD THAT THAT HIGH  
[000:15:38;10] LEVEL MEETING AT THE WHITE  
[000:15:39;03] HOUSE YESTERDAY THAT YOU  
[000:15:40;02] MENTIONED ONE OPTION THAT  
[000:15:40;25] IS BEING DISCUSSED IS U.S.  
[000:15:42;07] AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA AND  
[000:15:44;17] POSSIBLY WHOSE MISSILES TO  
[000:15:45;24] SEND A MESSAGE TO SYRIAN  
[000:15:51;10] PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD.  
[000:15:52;21] >> ED HADN'TRY, THANK YOU.  
[000:15:54;10] >> WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:15:56;04] CONTINUES TO HEDGE ITS  
[000:15:57;15] RESPONSE.  
[000:15:58;02] BRITAIN'S TOP DIPLOMAT  
[000:15:58;24] TODAY WAS A LITTLE MORE  
[000:16:00;03] BLUNT.  
[000:16:00;16] >> THE ONLY POSSIBLE  
[000:16:01;24] EXPLANATION OF WHAT WE HAVE  
[000:16:02;24] BEEN ABLE TO SEE IS THAT IT  
[000:16:04;20] WAS A CHEMICAL ATTACK.  
[000:16:07;19] CLEARLY MANY, MANY HUNDREDS  
[000:16:10;23] OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.  
[000:16:14;02] SOME OF THE ESTIMATES ARE  
[000:16:14;25] WELL OVER A THOUSAND.  
[000:16:15;16] THERE IS NO OTHER PLAUSIBLE  
[000:16:17;08] EXPLANATION FOR CASUALTIES,  
[000:16:19;25] SO INTENSE AND SUCH A SMALL  
[000:16:23;07] AREA.  
[000:16:23;20] >> Jon: HE DIDN'T GO AS FAR  
[000:16:24;14] AS THE FRENCH DID YESTERDAY  
[000:16:25;17] IN THE POSSIBILITY OF USING  
[000:16:27;01] FORCE.  
[000:16:27;14] JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE IN  
[000:16:28;09] OUR NEW YORK CITY NEWSROOM.  
[000:16:29;09] JONATHAN THE SYRIAN FORCES  
[000:16:30;25] STILL CLAIM THEY DID NOT  
[000:16:31;19] CARRY OUT THIS ATTACK.  
[000:16:32;16] >> THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT  
[000:16:35;23] INTERESTINGLY DENYING THAT  
[000:16:36;19] A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK  
[000:16:37;19] TOOK PLACE BUT SAYING AS  
[000:16:39;20] THEIR RUSSIAN ALLIES HAVE  
[000:16:40;21] ALSO IMPLIED THAT THE  
[000:16:41;24] ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY  
[000:16:42;29] THE REBELS TO GAIN SYMPATHY  
[000:16:45;15] AND PRO-VEHICLE  
[000:16:47;02] INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION  
[000:16:48;09] THERE ARE FEW WHO BELIEVE  
[000:16:49;12] THAT CLAIM.  
[000:16:50;12] BRITAIN, TURKEY, AND FRANCE  
[000:16:52;04] LEADING THE WAY AND  
[000:16:53;08] POINTING FINGERS PRETTY  
[000:16:54;12] DIRECTLY AT THE SYRIAN  
[000:16:55;21] GOVERNMENT FORCES AND  
[000:16:56;25] DEMANDING THAT THOSE U.N.  
[000:16:59;01] WEAPONS INSPECTORS WHO HAVE  
[000:17:00;03] ALREADY ARRIVED IN DAMASCUS  
[000:17:01;23] NOW BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO  
[000:17:03;18] THE SITE OF THE ALLEGED  
[000:17:05;12] ATTACK.  
[000:17:05;26] BUT THERE ARE FEW SIGNS  
[000:17:07;04] TONIGHT, JON, THAT THE  
[000:17:08;10] SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT  
[000:17:09;17] TO PROVIDE THOSE WEAPONS  
[000:17:11;25] INSPECTORS WITH SAFE  
[000:17:13;11] PASSAGE FOR THE ADMITTEDLY  
[000:17:15;22] DANGEROUS 15 MINUTE  
[000:17:16;17] JOURNEY.  
[000:17:17;01] FROM THAT HOTEL TO THE SITE  
[000:17:18;07] OF THE ATTACK JON.  
[000:17:20;06] >> Jon: ENED AT U.N. IS  
[000:17:21;00] GIVING US A LOOK AT HOW  
[000:17:22;18] SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR IS  
[000:17:23;18] EFFECTS THE CHILDREN THERE.  
[000:17:24;12] >> YEAH.  
[000:17:25;15] U.N. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCING
