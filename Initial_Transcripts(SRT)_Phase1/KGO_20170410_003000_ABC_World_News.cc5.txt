[000:25:25;991] So I talked to my doctor
[000:25:27;092] and he prescribed LYRICA.
[000:25:28;593] Nerve damage from diabetes

[000:25:31;696] LYRICA is FDA approved

[000:25:34;332] LYRICA may cause serious
[000:25:34;332] allergic reactions
[000:25:36;468] or suicidal thoughts
[000:25:36;468] or actions.
[000:25:38;169] Tell your doctor right away

[000:25:40;105] new or worsening depression,
[000:25:41;373] or unusual changes in mood
[000:25:41;373] or behavior.

[000:25:45;243] pain with fever,
[000:25:47;812] tired feeling or blurry vision.
[000:25:49;681] Common side effects are
[000:25:49;681] dizziness, sleepiness,
[000:25:51;850] weight gain and swelling
[000:25:51;850] of hands, legs, and feet.
[000:25:54;019] Don't drink alcohol while
[000:25:54;019] taking LYRICA.
[000:25:56;154] Don't drive or use machinery
[000:25:57;522] until you know how LYRICA
[000:25:57;522] affects you.
[000:25:59;491] Those who have had a drug or
[000:25:59;491] alcohol problem
[000:26:01;326] may be more likely
[000:26:01;326] to misuse LYRICA.
[000:26:03;161] Now I have less diabetic
[000:26:03;161] nerve pain.
[000:26:05;030] And I love keeping their little
