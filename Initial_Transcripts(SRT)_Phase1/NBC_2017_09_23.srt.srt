36
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:36,054
 THAT THE SAUDIS ISSUES THAT

 NOT SOON ON THE INTERNET AND   

38
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:48,934
 OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO     
 COME ON MY SHOE. ALTHOUGH IN   

39
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:58,177
 GENERAL BE IN THE VERY         
 EXCITING SEE THE BIG FUSS BUT  

40
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:04,049
 IT IS I'M ALL FOR IT           
 ESPECIALLY FOR NEWCOMERS FOR   

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:12,157

 THE TIME THE HOW WHY WOULDN'T  

42
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,893
 WE WERE GOING TO GET THEIR     
 BUTTS WONDER WHAT ALL OF US    

43
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:21,166
 TO A FEW YEARS AGO THE FIRST   
 LAST FIVE YEARS. WE GOT WHAT   

44
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,436
 I THINK THE STRIPES ARE FROM   
 LOGISTICS AS SAFE FROM         

45
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,307
 THE BIRDS INSIDE THE BOMBERS   
 ONTO THE PAVEMENT WITH BRODY   

46
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:36,515
 AT RIGHT NOW IS JUST STARTING  
 TO ENABLE WHAT THE NEXT        

47
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,883
 GENERATION OF BROTHERS ARE     
 USING IT SINCE I WAS GOING TO  

48
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,219
 SEE THE NEXT FIVE YEARS GRAY   
 WERE SOLD IN THE EARLY STAGES  

49
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:45,190
 DIVERSITY SAFE I THINK THIS    
 IS A MATTER OF DECIDING A      

50
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,561
 PROBABLY OPTIMISTICALLY AT A   
 FOSTER MOM TO WRITE IN IT AND  

51
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,029
 WHAT TO WRITE SO IF YOU THINK  
 ABOUT THAT TOO VERY LAST       

52
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,968
 SECOND CITY THAT IT'S NOT      
 BEEN THE DEFENSE WON THIS      

53
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,302
 CUTE SEGMENT OF CONSUMERS

 THE PARTS OF THE BILL BECAUSE  

55
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:03,875
 IT DIDN'T HAPPEN NEEDS TO BE   
  I THINK THE SECOND SEGMENT    

56
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,110
 IS THIS IS A LOCAL BASIS AS    
 WE DON'T ACTUALLY NOT          

57
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:11,883
 CONNECTED TO DATE TWO WEEKS    
 OF DIGITAL MEANS SOUL OF MAN   

58
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:16,121
 THAT SAT IN THAT BUILDING AND  
 TIME OF FULL HUMAN EAR BUT SO  

59
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,456
 WHAT REALLY STINGS EVERY       
 INNING BUT THIS THOUGH FUTURE  

60
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,494
 AHEAD OF US BUT WE'RE LOOKING  
 AT IS THIS THE FIRST IN REACH  

61
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:26,398

 SO STRONG THIS BIG IT'S        

62
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,600
 BETWEEN THE FIRST GENERATION   
 IN EVERY START TONIGHT ABOUT   

63
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:34,940
 SEVEN YEARS REALLY SAYING SEE  
 THAT FLY OVER THE NEXT AND     

64
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,742
 FIFTY YEARS THE QUESTION TO    
 YOU BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN        

65
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:42,814
 INVOLVED IN IN SEVEN STARTS

 HERS WHO WON A PACK A FIT AND  
 THEY'LL SAY HOW HAVE YOU SEEN

 THE OPPORTUNITIES CHANGE OVER  
 THE YEARS IN TERMS OF FUNDING  

68
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:54,793
 THAT IS IN PLACE AND           
 THE TALENT THAT'S AVAILABLE    

69
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,196
 TO SOC LIKE IN THE PAST YEARS  
 THE US BECAUSE IT IS           

70
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,665
 EXTREMELY FRAGMENTED SO YOU    
 HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TOPS   

71
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:07,673
 WAS FACING THE PROBLEMS AND A  
 LOT OF IT. I THINK IN          

72
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:13,178
 THE NEXT TEN YEARS AGO IS

76
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,927
 SYNERGISTIC PARTNERSHIPS       
 ACQUISITIONS MERGERS WILL NOT  

77
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,762
 I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN       
 THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE ORTHO  

78
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,230
 THE VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR   
 STARTUPS AND WE HAVE SEEN IN   

79
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,535
 THIS REGION. UM NOT USE IN     
 MALAYSIA AND INDONESIA AND     

80
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,836
 SINGAPORE AS WELL IS AN        
 INCREASING NUMBER OF REPORTS   

81
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,041
 OF COURSE THE BIG NAMES

82
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,212
 ON THE GO J FOR THE NAMES

83
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:54,953
 YOU THE NUMBER OF CAROUSEL     
 HAS THE NAMES HELPS INCREASE   

84
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,288
 THE CHANCES OF YOU KNOW YOU

85
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:01,760
 MILLION ROUNDS LAST YEAR. DO   
 YOU FIND OTHERS MORE FUNDING   

86
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:12,971

 UNIFORMS AND RECOGNIZE         

87
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:22,514
 THE OPPORTUNITIES AND SO I     
 GUESS SCHOOL IS KIND OF BIKE   

88
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:26,451
 IS GOING TO STOP THE CAROUSEL  
 FUNDING WAS SPEEDED UP WITH A  

89
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:32,057
 BOSS FIGHT IS TO SEE A LOT OF  
 INTERESTING STUFF COMING OUT   

90
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:39,881
 AS A RESULT OF THE INVESTORS   
 WILL BUY THE STUFF THAT        

91
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,117
 DECISION ON THE SAUCE IS       
 DEFINITELY THE BEST ACTUALLY   

92
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:48,874
 ACCELERATE THE LAW ON          
 RECENTLY IS THAT YOU SEE ON    

93
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:54,846
 CHINA AS HE SAID THE REGION    
 ARE AS FOLLOW THE USA MEANS    

94
00:06:54,981 --> 00:07:01,453
 THAT THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE TO    
 BE HONEST AND NOT SO IT'S NO   

95
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:08,326
 LONGER JUST AS IMPORTANT BUT

98
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,170
 THE CAROUSEL ON THE LINE       
 STATING THAT HE HAS TO BE A    

99
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,938
 LOCAL COMPANY HAS MORE THAN    
 SINGAPORE THE ASK IS SOMEBODY

 THOSE PCS THAT MAY HAVE        

103
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,280
 PERHAPS LOOK TO CHINA BEFORE   
 THE OPPORTUNITY SEEN           

104

 THE MARKET INCREASINGLY        
 SATURATED THEY'RE SHIFTING

 THE MONEY FROM THE US. IT'S    

107
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,560
 ONE DEGREE REMOVED FROM        
 THE START UP SO A LOT OF US

 REALLY PUSHING                 

121
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,142
 THE ENTREPRENEUR REALISM IN    
 THE SECOND GENERATION OF

127
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:53,965
 WHERE FIVE YEARS AGO ME THERE  
 WERE DOZENS OF COMPANIES OR    

128
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,101
 HANDFUL IN THE SERIES ACE      
 SPACE. NOW THEY ARE ON         

129
00:08:56,235 --> 00:09:00,572
 THE ORDER OF ONE HUNDRED       
 COMPANIES IN THE SERIES IS AN  

130
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,808
 ORDER OF MAGNITUDE GROWTH      
 THAT'S HAPPENED I SEE THAT     

131
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,344
 CONTINUING OVER THE NEXT       
 YEARS YOU START A LARGER AND   

132
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,047
 YOU ARE IN SEVERAL MARKETS     
 SINCE THEN YOU DOWNSIZE TO     

133
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:17,422
 FOCUS ON THAILAND'S INDONESIA

138
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:35,273
 A BIG MARKET IN INDONESIA IS   
 IT BETTER TO TRY TO FIND       

139
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:39,678
 SUCCESS IN ONE COUNTRY HERE    
 IN THE REGION BEFORE YOU

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:08,159

 DO IS PRETTY MUCH TO TELL ME   

174
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:11,296
 HOW WE ARE AT THE TWO          
 DIVISIONS AND PAWN IN THIS     

175
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,901

 CONNECTIVITY OF THE SYSTEM     

176
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,973
 AND BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE

177
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,409
 THE FOUR ACTIVITIES THAT WE    
 DO AND THE OTHER BIT IS        

178
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:29,781
 ACTUALLY DEPRESSING ABOUT NOT  
 SO MUCH FROM TENNESSEE WHERE   

179

 RISHI AND IT'S NOWHERE         
 THE ISLAND WEATHER HAS BEEN A  

180
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:37,789
 MAJOR RESTORATION IS           
 SOUTHEAST ASIA SHOULD BE       

181
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,625
 THE HOT POSSIBLE AND

 THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES AND   

183
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:52,103
 PULL AS SOME OF                
 THE HIGHLIGHTS IN              

184
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:59,611

185

 FIGHTS TO BE A HOUSE THE GOAL  
 IS HOW DO YOU FIND ME TO

 COLLABORATE IN A MANNER THAT   
 WOULD HELP BUILD THE SYSTEM    

187
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:13,091
 OF LAW THE BIG MARKETS HERE    
 IN THE US AND CHINA. WE SEEM   

188
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,392
 TO GET STARTED TRY TO MAKE AN  
 ENTRY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA        

189
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,694
 THROUGH DIFFERENT MEATS WERE   
 BROUGHT IN THEIR BRAND NAME    

190
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,831
 THEY HAD THEIR STRATEGY READY  
 READY TO GO HAVEN'T            

191
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,868
 NECESSARILY DOMINATED ANY      
 MARKET IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WHEN  

192
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,236
 YOU'VE GOT SOME OTHER CHINESE  
 LEADERS HAVE COME AND LOOK     

193
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:33,511
 FOR PARTNERSHIPS ANYONE WANT   
 TO JUMP IN TERMS OF WHAT SHE   

194
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,746
 THINKS IT'S A SMALL BETTER     
 BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT          

195
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,050
 SOUTHEAST ASIA AS IF IT'S ONE  
 MARKET BUT REALLY IT'S QUITE   

196
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,787
 FRAGMENTED FROM COUNTRY AND    
 THE AGGIES MADE IT PRETTY      

197
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,022
 WELL A DIFFERENT KIND OF A US  
 COMPANY COMING INTO            

198
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,193
 THE REGION OWN TACK OWN BRAND  
 NEW CHANGES VERSUS CHINESE     

199
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:55,500
 COMPANY ALIBABA INVESTING OR   
 BUYING GO JACK AS              

200
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,768
 THE AMERICANS OUT HERE         
 ACTUALLY THINK THE CHINESE     

201
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:04,008
 MODEL IS MUCH STRONGER WAY OF  
 GOING GLOBAL. BASICALLY        

202
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:08,346
 VOCALS MOBILIZING NOT THROUGH  
 LANGUAGE BUT SCREW BRAND AND   

203
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,781
 PRODUCT OFFERING PRODUCTS AND  
 SO I THINK THE LONG RUN        

204
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,117
 THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE    
 THEM THROUGHOUT BE A VERY      

205
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:20,290
 STRONG ADVANTAGE. I THINK      
 THAT'S ONE REASON THE MARKET   

206
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:23,694
 DOES NOT CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY  
 IN ANY WAY YOU'VE GOT THE WAY  

207
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:28,098
 YOU OPERATE CAROUSEL RIGHT     
 NOW. DO YOU THINK WHAT AMAZON  

208
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,366
 TO ORDER THIS PART OF          
 THE MARKET HOW DO WE AS LOCAL  

209
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:36,440
 PLAYER TRY TO MAINTAIN AND     
 KEEP OUR PIECES OF POSITIONS   

210
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:39,209
 THERE FOR ME SOMETHING THIS    
 BABY AS YOU MENTIONED. SO      

211
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:45,582
 ABBY EVERY COUNTRIES THAT      
 WISH THAN TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN   

212
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,919
  IT SEEMS THAT BROUGHT UP AND  
 MAKE YOU REALIZE THAT          

213
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:51,388
 THE BICYCLE AND ONE THING      
 THAT MAKES UP AS A REALLY      

214
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:55,492
 DIFFERENT FROM YOU COMES OUT   
 AS A COMMUNITY THAT BUILDS     

215
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:56,960
 OVER THE YEARS AND THINK       
 ABOUT AMAZON ALL OF YOU GUYS   

216
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:59,696
 STARTED MOBILE FIRSTS CARE     
 SERVICES BUT IN THE US THAT'S  

217
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:05,169
 NOT THE CASE MOST COMPANIES    
 EVEN AMAZON START BUT FIRST    

218
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,937
  SO EVEN AMAZON IN SINGAPORE   
 HAS A MOBILE YOU CAN ONLY      

219
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:11,275
 ORDER OFF THEIR MOBILE APP     
 BUT THE THING IS THEY'RE NOT   

220
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,811
 IN THE MOBILE COMPANY THEIR    
 MOBILE APP TO THE WEBSITE      

221
00:15:13,945 --> 00:15:15,712
 WITH A RAPPER OR JUST          
 SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS THAT    

222
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:20,617
 OF IN SOUTHEAST ASIA PEOPLE    
 ARE THINKING ABOUT REAL TIME   

223
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:24,121
 LOCAL CHAT INSTEAD. THESE ARE  
 THINGS THAT ARE VERY           

224
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:27,124
 DIFFERENT MINDSET FOR SOME OF  
 THESE US COMPANIES COULD NOT   

225
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,692
 IN THEIR DNA SO IT REALLY      
 GIVES A MUCH STRONGER          

226
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:36,200
 FIGHTING CHANCE WHEN YOU'RE    
 BUILDING IT FOR AUTUMN AWE ON  

227
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:39,903
 THE GAZE OF AMAZON             
 SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR DAYS AT   

228
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:44,441
 A FIRE. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS   
 THAT THAT HAS BEEN             

229
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,709
 ACCELERATING A LOT OF          
 RETAILERS. WELL WE'VE SEEN IS  

230
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:50,447
 THAT WHERE SIX TWO MM ON       
 THE GO TO YET AT SOME OF       

231
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,782
 THE REGATTA IS WHERE IT'S      
 THAT THE CALL ABOUT HOW AND    

232
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:57,621
 WHEN THAT HAPPENED TODAY NO    
 ONE IS ITB LESSON IN THAT      

233
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,790
 ANYMORE AND WAS SOO            
 DISGUSTING EYES AND CYNICAL    

234
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:06,530
 IT'S WHAT WE GET THE BEST DAD  
 A FEW NEW TRADITION OF         

235
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:10,367
 VISITING A NEW REALM OF I      
 WILL START THE NEXT HURDLE IN  

236
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:18,308
 HALF TO GET A LOT OF ISSUES    
 TO READ THE SOLVING OF         

237
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:21,945
 THE CONDITIONS THAT IS SOME    
 PRECISION FOR EXAMPLE THINGS   

238
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:31,955
 THAT SHOULD BE OR SOMETHING    
 THAT EVERY COUNTRY THEY SAW    

239
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,924
 THAT ENOUGH WAS WE NEEDED TO   
 SEE OURSELVES AS AN ECOSYSTEM  

240
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:40,230
 RATHER THAN TRYING TO TACKLE   
 ABOUT SELVES. SO RECENTLY      

241
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:43,934
 BEEN OTHER GUESTS FELL TO      
 THE EYE CAN SEE THE BEAST      

242
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:46,870
 BABY CAN ACTUALLY GET IT AT    
 ALBERTSON'S ECONOMIC           

243
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,541
 COLLABORATION. I THINK HAVING  
 COLLABORATION WITH MULTIPLE    

244
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:51,742
 PARTNERS TO BUILD THAT         
 ECOSYSTEM IS FABIO NEXT        

245
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:57,881
 HURDLE RATHER THAN GOING TO I

 NOT HOMOGENEOUS MARKET BUT     

288
00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:22,519
 THE FORMATION AND FOR          
 THE LAST TEN AND ALSO ON       

289
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:28,725
 THE CAUSE OF THE WOODS TO      
 FIND A WAY THAT YOU CAN EAT    

290
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,964
 EAT SOMETHING. THE EMERGING    
 MARKET. I SEMI HIT THE HAY     

291
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,833
 LEAD INTO THE REST OF US THEN  
 AND THEN FROM THE EMERGING     

292
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,935
 MARKETS THUS YOU THINK         
 THE GOVERNMENT PLAYS WELL IN   

293
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,473
 SUSTAINING THE GROWTH WE       
 HEARD FROM THE NAME OF         

294
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,943
 THE TALKING ABOUT ITS ONE      
 MALAYSIA IS DOING TO TRY AND   

295
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,213
 NOT ONLY FOSTER THE START OF   
 THE CULTURE HERE THAT BRING    

296
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:56,987
 IN TALENT FROM THE OUTSIDE AS  
 WELL. WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE    

297
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:59,422
 DONE ON THAT YOU KNOW AS       
 AMERICANS THE GOVERNMENT       

298
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:01,792
 SHOULD BE MORE ABOUT LIKE      
 GETTING OUT OF THE WAY BUT I   

299
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:09,199
 THINK THE IDEA OF              
 THE ECOSYSTEM POURING IN TAX   

300
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,370
 DOLLARS EXPERIENCE. I THINK    
 THAT'S VERY HELPFUL            

301
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:14,638
  THE THING THAT ALWAYS         
 OVERLOOKED AS YOU WOULD SAY    

302
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,006
 TO US SO IT'S COMPLETELY OUT   
 OF THE HANDS OF GOVERNMENT     

303
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,077
  THE REALITY IS MOST DC HAS    
 GOVERNMENT DOLLARS IS STATE    

304
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:28,185
 PENSION FUNDS IT IS THESE      
 VERY LARGE STATE OF FUNDS AND  

305
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,786
 ENDOWMENTS THE FACT HE SEES    
 THAT MAY NOT HAVE KIND OF      

306
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,689
 THE POLITICAL SAY HEY WANT     
 YOU TO INVEST IN XYZ OR        

307
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:37,227
 THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING IS    
 THE TYPE OF MONEY. HOW ABOUT   

308
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,628
 LONG TERM MULTI DECADE VIEW    
 HE BELIEVES TAKE HIGH RISKS    

309
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,298
 USUALLY COME FROM THE STATE    
  ANYWAY WE DON'T THINK ABOUT   

310
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:44,467
 THAT THE US BUT SO SEEING      
 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HERE GET     

311
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:51,975
 MORE INVOLVED IN FINANCIALLY   
 SUPPORTING THE ECOSYSTEM WITH  

312
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:54,377
 A HANDS OFF APPROACH BEING A   
 GOOD CAREER TO REMOVE I THINK  

313
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:58,548
 IS THE PATH I SEE SOUTHEAST    
 ASIAN MARKETS BEING DOMINATED  

314
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:00,884
 BY WELL FUNDED IN APPEARANCE   
 LIKE GRAVEL IS NOT UNTIL       

315
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:06,590
 THE MEDIA IS THE WORST FACE    
 WITH A SMALLER PLAYER IN       

316
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:11,027
 THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION        
 PEOPLE HIT THE STREETS WHO IS  

317
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:19,870
 THIS TO ME SAID MARKET SO      
 THE QUESTION OF HIS DAY WHO    

318
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:24,674
 WILL NOT BE YES MEN MOSTLY     
 BUT NOT ON THE INTERNET ID     

319
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:26,276
 AGE. THIS LOSS OF MUSCLE       
 WHICH IN SOMEBODY WHO HAS      

320
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,013
 INVESTED IN CAROUSEL AT THIS   
 POINT IN THE START OF GAME IN  

321
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:33,783
 SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS IT THAT     
 YOU'RE LOOKING YOU THINK OF    

322
00:22:33,918 --> 00:22:39,422
 WHICH COMPANIES YOU WANT TO    
 START NEXT. SO EVERY           

323
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:44,027
 INVESTMENT VALUE PEOPLE SO     
 THEY TOO ARE THE FOUNDERS WHY  

324
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:48,398
 WHY ARE THEY DOING WHAT WAS    
 CRUCIAL TO THE EXPERIENCE      

325
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,634
 IT'S HANDS DOWN THE QUESTIONS  
 YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE        

326
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:51,968
 CERTAIN PIECES THAT WE HAVE    
 IN TERMS OF THE BIGGER PAIN    

327
00:22:52,103 --> 00:23:00,010
 POINTS THAT CONSUMERS NEED     
 RIGHT NOW AROUND CONFERENCE    

328
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:02,712
 ARE TO PLACE HIS PAYMENTS SO   
 YOU HAVE THIS INTERSECTION OF  

329
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,582
 TOWNERS A CERTAIN PROFILE      
 CERTAIN AREAS THAT ARE CLEAR   

330
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:09,552
 IN POINTS BUT IT'S MUCH MORE   
 NUANCE NOT LIKE WHY DO WE      

331
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:13,056
 WRITE ABOUT AND WHY AS WE      
 PASS IN SOME GREAT             

332
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,260
 INVESTMENTS AND THAT YOU       
 PROBABLY WELL AND WE MAY KNOW  

333
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,764
 THAT ONE HAS SEEN ME NOTS ARE  
 PIECES PERFECTLY OR MAKE A     

334
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,266
 DIFFERENCE THEY ARE. YOU KNOW  
 WHAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR    

335
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,002
 IS THEIR THEIR BELIEFS YOU     
 INSPIRE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM     

336
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:33,009
 THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE IN    
 MULTIPLE MARKETS. THERE'S SO   

337
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:37,180
 MANY LITTLE NUANCES THAT IT'S  
 HARD TO SAY WHY YES I KNOW     

338
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,349
 THE OTHER THING IS JUST        
 THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE      

339
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:43,019
 LATE YET SOME OF THE QUESTION  
 WAS HOW DO YOU COMPUTE         

340
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:49,192
 THE BILL IS NOT A NEWSMAN SAY  
 A BILLION NEW STUFF FROM       

341
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:50,560
 SCRATCH RIGHT NOW TO COMPETE   
 WITHOUT A PROBLEM BE A VERY    

342
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:51,761
 DIFFICULT TIME AROUND          
 INVESTORS BUT THOSE OTHER      

343
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,763
 COMPANIES ARE MENTIONED        
 COOKIE A AND GRAB FIVE YEARS   

344
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:57,434
 AGO THOSE WITH A SMALL START   
 UPS GO JACK ONLY REASON SERIE  

345
00:23:57,568 --> 00:24:02,305
 DE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO    
 THAT IS NO REASON BILLION      

346
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,675
 DOLLARS. SO WHAT IS KIND OF    
 SMALL SOMETIMES YOU DON'T      

347
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,978
 REALLY REALIZE UNTIL YOU TALK  
 ABOUT THE NEXT WAVE THAT       

348
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:13,883
 WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS          
 THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS THERE   

349
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:15,251
 BEING ABLE TO EXPORT THE STAR  
 OUTSIDE OF THE REGION. WHAT    

350
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:21,725
 DO YOU SEE AS A MARKER FOR     
 THE NEXT GENERATION STARTS     

351
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:25,795
 SITE GOES COMES AND GO BUT AT  
 THE END OF THE CYCLE           

352
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,533
 THE COMPANIES THAT MISSED OUT  
 ON HIS FEET COMPANIES THAT     

353
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:35,305
 YOU ARE BASED ON THE SHOW I    
 SAW THIS ON THE EAST AND       

354
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:42,712
 THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE FOCUSING  
 ON DUTY IN THAT I DON'T I      

355
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:48,251
 BELIEVED IRAN OR EVEN          
 OUTWEIGH HER BY SAYING THAT    

356
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:52,722
 THE SOUL OF THE LOGISTICS      
 INFRASTRUCTURE E COMMERCE      

357
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,057
 MARKETPLACE BUT INSTEAD OF     
 PAVEMENT THAT'S WHY WE KEEP    

358
00:24:54,191 --> 00:25:01,031
 ON TALKING ABOUT WAS OUT I     
 WAS ON PBS THAT IS IS THIS     

359
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:02,699
 DOES THAT BIRD GOES LIVE IF    
 THIS TRANSACTION IT SO MANY    

360
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,669
 OTHER THINGS THAT WE DO GOES   
 FROM NOW THE INTERESTS OF      

361
00:25:06,804 --> 00:25:11,408
 FINANCE IS SO MANY THINGS      
 THAT THAT'S DONE AND I         

362
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:12,809
 THOUGHT THAT I THINK THE NEW   
 GENERATION WOULD BE PROBABLY   

363
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:20,050
 PEOPLE THAT LOVE GOD MY DAD    
 IS MY WAYS AND I LOVE LITTLE   

364
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:24,454
 SOMETHING TO BE OUT THE BOX    
  I THINK I CANNOT SAY THAT     

365
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:25,755
 THIS IS THAT I'M LOOKING ON    
 RIGHT NOW SO I ASK MYSELF      

366
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,690
 THE WHOLE BIG OF A PROBLEM     
 SOLVING AND ON ONE THING IS    

367
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:29,893
 GETTING OFF AND WE TILL MY     
 REST SONGS RETAILERS TO BE ON  

368
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:33,096
 MY CITY LOOK AT IT ACROSS      
 THE REGION BY GOVERNMENTS      

369
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,767
 HAVE BEEN APPEALING TO         
 BUSINESSES LOCAL BUSINESSES    

370
00:25:37,902 --> 00:25:42,872
 TO ADOPT TECHNOLOGY TO         
 DIGITAL PAYMENTS FOR EVER AND  

371
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:44,707
 I DID TODAY. IF THE PIECES     
 JUST DON'T SEE VALUE IN        

372
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:48,511
 ACTUALLY GOING ON RIGHT THING  
 TO DO THE DEMONS THEN YOU      

373
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:53,583
 WOULD NEVER HAPPEN SOUL        
  THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE        

374
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:56,386
 TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM    
 THAT ALL THESE GOVERNMENTS OF
