YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAYING THAT   
THE HARD PART WAS KNOWING SO    

206
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,564

FOR ALL OF US.                  
AND SEEING WHAT WE SAW.         

208
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:59,074
AND I THINK, AS A MOM, KNOWING  
THAT THEY HAD TO SEE THAT, AND  

209
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:02,777
THAT'S STUCK WITH THEM FOREVER.

BE OKAY.                        

211
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:06,614
AND THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO THOSE   
DOCTORS AND NURSES.             

212
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:11,019
AND AS FOR SHELDON, HE WANTS TO 
MEET THAT HERO WAS BY HIS SIDE. 

213
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,855
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HERO WAS  
GRAZED BY A BULLET, TOO, BUT IS 

214
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,524
NO LONGER AT THE HOSPITAL.      
SO, IF THAT HERO IS WATCHING    

215
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,227
TONIGHT, SHELDON'S FAMILY WANTS 
TO THANK YOU.

TO PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR, HE   
TOUTED THE DEATH COUNT AS IF HE 

230
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:06,908
WERE KEEPING SCORE.             
>> IF YOU LOOK AT A REAL KA AS  

231
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,677
THE TROE TEE LIKE KA TREE       
ANYWAY, AND YOU LOOK AT THE     

232
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:12,213
TREMENDOUS HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT

>> 16 PEOPLE, CERTIFIED.        

235
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,290
16 PEOPLE VERSUS IN THE         
THOUSANDS.                      

236
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:25,927
YOU CAN BE VERY PROUD.          
>> Reporter: AND EVEN AS HE     

237
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,896
TALKED UP THE FEDERAL RECOVERY  
EFFORT --                       

238
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:29,597

AMAZING.

HIGH COST.                      
>> I HATE TO TELL YOU,          

241
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,438
PUERTO RICO, BUT YOU'VE THROWN  
OUR BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF      

242
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,472
WHACK.                          
>> Reporter: ALSO IN THE ROOM,  

243
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,108
THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, WHO THE  
PRESIDENT HAS SLAMMED           

244
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:44,512
RELENTLESSLY ON TWITTER FOR     
SAYING PUERTO RICO NEEDS MORE   

245
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,183
THAN IT'S GETTING.              
>> SIR.                         

246
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,250
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.             
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT SAVING LIVES, 

247
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,454
IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICS.        
>> Reporter: AFTERWARDS, THE    

248
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,957
MAYOR CALLED THE MEETING        
PRODUCTIVE.                     

249
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,158
BUT ON CNN, SHE DISMISSED THE   
PRESIDENTIAL VISIT AS PUBLIC    

250
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:00,528
RELATIONS.                      
>> RATHER THAN COMMANDER IN     

251
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:03,965
CHIEF, HE SORT OF BECOMES       
MISCOMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF.       

252
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,936
>> Reporter: NOT FAR FROM THERE,
WE MET UP WITH HECTOR GARCIA HE 

253
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:12,006
HAD NO IDEA THE PRESIDENT WAS ON
THE ISLAND, BUT HE TELLS US,    

254
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:15,376
HE'S HAPPY HE'S HERE.           
"HE CAME HERE," GARCIA TOLD US, 

255
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:17,345
"BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'RE IN      
CRISIS."                        

256
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,481
DAVID, THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN      
DIPLOMATIC TONIGHT.             

257
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,051
HE SAYS HE APPRECIATES THE      
PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND HIS       

258
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,786
COMMITMENT TO THE ISLAND OF     
PUERTO RICO.                    

259
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:28,523
HE WANTS TO SEE RELIEF EFFORTS  
CONTINUE, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE 

260
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,392
THE U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL SHIP    
BEHIND ME.                      

261
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,728
THIS JUST GOT HERE TODAY, TWO   
WEEKS AFTER THE STORM HIT THE   

262
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:35,763
ISLAND.                         
DAVID?                          

263
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,765

TONIGHT.                        

264
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,635

KNOW AT HOME WE WERE IN PUERTO

RICO OVER THE WEEKEND WHEN THE  
SHOOTING BROKE OUT HERE IN LAS  

266
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,107
VEGAS, AND BEFORE WE LEFT TO    
COME HERE, WE HAD GONE TO A     

267
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:49,010
NEIGHBORHOOD, JUST A SHORT DRIVE
FROM WHERE THE PRESIDENT WAS    

268
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,578
TODAY.                          
NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE HER  

269
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:55,350
KHAN, WE DISCOVERED FAMILIES IN 
SWELTERING HERE, NO POWER, NO   

270
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,318
RUNNING WATER, AND A CALL FOR   
HELP.                           

271
00:13:57,386 --> 00:14:00,522
WE WENT LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT
BUILDING, JUST 15 MINUTES FROM  

272
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,526
THE AIRPORT IN SAN JUAN.        
BECAUSE WE HAD HEARD THAT NEARLY

273
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:09,197
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE HURRICANE   
HIT, THEY WERE STILL WITHOUT    

274
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,801
POWER AND WOULD RUNNING WATER.  
WE WALK UP THE DARKENED         

275
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:21,543
STAIRWELL AND DOWN THE HALLWAY.

LIZBETH VAZQUEZ DELGADO LIVES IN

277
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,649
NEW YORK CITY.                  
BUT SHE IS HERE TAKING CARE OF  

278
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:28,750
HER PARENTS.                    
THE PRESIDENT HAD TWEETED DAYS  

279
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:29,517
AGO, ALL BUILDINGS NOW          
INSPECTED.                      

280
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,153
AND WE WONDER, HAVE THEY SEEN   
ANY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS OR THE  

281
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:34,155
GOVERNMENT.                     
WE HAD HEARD THAT INSPECTORS HAD

282
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,623
BEEN VISITING BUILDINGS ALL OVER
PUERTO RICO.                    

283
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:36,758
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INSPECTORS?

284
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,193
NOT AT ALL.                     
THEY HAVE NOT COME TO SEE WHAT'S

285
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:41,162
HAPPENED TO THESE APARTMENTS.

NO CLEAN DRINKING WATER.        

290
00:14:49,538 --> 00:14:52,340
CAN YOU DRINK THE WATER?        
>> NO, WE CANNOT.               

291
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,610
AT ALL.

294
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:03,184
ELMER AND GLORIA, ON THE BED IN 
NEED OF MEDICATION.             

295
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:10,658
THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY ANY      
DOCTOR HAD PAID A VISIT.        

296
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:14,729
THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE?

297
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:18,466

LIKE, FOUR APARTMENTS.          

299
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:26,574
>> Reporter: DOWN THE HALLWAY,  
WE SEE OTHER RESIDENTS, SOME    

300
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,077
CARRYING FLASHLIGHTS.           
AND WE HEAD INTO ONE OF THOSE   

301
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:32,413
APARTMENTS, WHERE WE MEET A     
WOMAN LIZBETH HAS BEEN SHARING

HER BREAD AND WATER WITH.       
MARIA DIAZ IS 70, WHO HAS BEEN  

303
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,392
DRINKING THE WATER FROM THE     
FAUCET, EVEN THOUGH SHE KNOWS   

304
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,661
IT'S NOT SAFE.                  
SHE HOLDS AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF    

305
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,529
WATER.                          
TELLING US IT COSTS $6.         

306
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:52,300
WITH LITTLE FOOD AND NO CLEAN   
WATER, SHE IS PANIC-STRICKEN,   

307
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,968
TELLING ME, I DON'T WANT TO DIE 
HERE.                           

308
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,938
IN SO MANY OF THESE APARTMENT   
BUILDINGS, THEY ARE UNAWARE OF  

309
00:15:57,006 --> 00:16:00,508
THE FEMA HELP, BECAUSE THEY HAVE
NO POWER, NO ACCESS TO THE NEWS.

310
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:03,211
AND TONIGHT, JUST 7% OF THE     
ISLAND HAS POWER BACK.          

311
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,547
THIS BUILDING DOES NOT.         
A GENERATOR IS TURNED ON A      

312
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,183
COUPLE OF HOURS A NIGHT.        
AND WE WALK P THE STAIRS,       

313

KNOWING THERE ARE 13 STORIES IN 
THIS BUILDING.                  

314
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,194

DOWN THE HALL, YOU CAN SEE THE  

315
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:24,532
DESTRUCTION THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
WE STEP OVER A DOORWAY BLOWN    

316
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,601
IN BY THE HURRICANE.            
FLOOR AFTER FLOOR, WE HEAR THE  

317
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:32,040
SAME CONCERNS.                  
WHILE BACK DOWN ON THE FOURTH

LITTLE BREAD SHE HAS AND A SLICE

319

321
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,151
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE    
THAT DON'T HAVE FAMILY.         

322
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,453

331
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,478
  Your body was made for better 
           things than          

332
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,714
      rheumatoid arthritis.     

333
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,716
       Before you and your      
 rheumatologist move to another 

334
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:17,351
  treatment, ask if XELJANZ is  
         right for you.         

335
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,887
   XELJANZ is a small pill for  
           adults with          

336
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,491
 moderate to severe RA for whom 
 methotrexate did not work well.

337
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:26,227
  XELJANZ can reduce joint pain 
  and swelling in as little as  

338
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,913
two weeks, and help stop further
          joint damage.         

339
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,532
 XELJANZ can lower your ability 
      to fight infections,      

340
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,251
     including tuberculosis.    

341
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,369
    Serious, sometimes fatal    
 infections, lymphoma and other 

342
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,704
     cancers have happened.

          an infection.         

344

     Tears in the stomach or

00:17:44,414 --> 00:17:45,930
Your doctor should perform blood
        tests before you        

348
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:48,750
 start and while taking XELJANZ,
and monitor certain liver tests.

349
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,918
 Tell your doctor if you were in
      a region where fungal     

350
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,770
infections are common and if you
          have had TB,          

351
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,890
 hepatitis B or C, or are prone 
         to infections.

357
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,818
       So my dentist told       
        me about this...        

358
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,253

361
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,695
     I did it, I did it, I      
     impressed the dentist.     

362
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,463
       You owned your car

00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:36,631
        for four years.         

364
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,399
       You named it Brad.       

365
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,501
         You loved Brad.        

366
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:42,403
    And then you totaled him.   

367
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:44,772
    You two had been through    
      everything together.

      In clinical studies,      

474
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,961
    the majority of patients

HUMIRA can lower your ability to

484
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,447
  Before treatment, get tested  
            for TB.             

485
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,115
Tell your doctor if you've been

486
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,067
where certain fungal infections 
          are common,           

487
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,318

490
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,458
 Don't start HUMIRA if you have 
         an infection.          

491
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,443
 If you're still just managing  
         your symptoms,         

492
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,862
  ask your gastroenterologist   
         about HUMIRA.          

493
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,148
     With HUMIRA, remission
