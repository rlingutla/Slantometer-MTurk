00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,169

GET YOU ANOTHER ONE.

YOU WILL BE THE ONE SIGNING THIS

239
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:21,492
IN THE FUTURE.                  
>> WOW.                         

240
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,629
>> President Trump: IF YOU CAN  
GIVE ME SOME ADDITIONAL PENS.   

241
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,398
THANK YOU.                      
SEND THEM THE GOOD ONES.        

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:32,604

IT WILL GET DONE, RIGHT?        

246
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,895
IF YOU DO HEALTH CARE, IT WILL  
GET DONE.                       

247
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,564
OKAY, EVERYBODY.

THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD.    

255

STARTING TODAY.

HERE'S THE LATEST TRACK FOR YOU,
FORECASTERS SAY THEY DO NOT     

290
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,006
EXPECT THAT CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE         

291
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,441
UNITED STATES AT ALL.           
IT WILL NOT MAKE LANDFALL THEY  

292
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,112
TELL US, BUT THEY SAY IT WILL

295
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,089
THIS COMES DAYS AFTER THE STORM 
SLAMMED PUERTO RICO, LEAVING    

296
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,858
BEHIND DESTRUCTION AND I CANNOT 
POWER IT TO EVERYBODY THERE.    

297
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,361
OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH      
STRONGER.                       

298

CERTAINLY DIFFERENT ISLAND AND  

302
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,443
IT WAS A WEEK AGO.              
PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AND AT

REPORTS PEOPLE WAITED HOURS IN  

304
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,418
SOME AREAS TO GET A LITTLE BIT. 
HERE ARE KIDS FEELING JUGS WITH 

305
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,321
FRESH WATER IN A DISTRIBUTION   
POINT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER EAST 

306
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,224
OF THERE.                       
EMERGENCY WORKERS DELIVERED MORE

307
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:29,794
THAN 1 MILLION AND A HALF       
GALLONS OF WATER TO THE ISLAND. 

308
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,862
THIS IS SAN JUAN.               
A WI-FI HOT SPOT.               

309
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,766
PEOPLE GETTING SERVICE.         
CELL PHONES ARE TOUGH.          

310
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,369
WATER FLOWS FROM THE DAM ON THE 
NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND,   

311
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,172
WHERE OFFICIALS TOLD THOUSANDS  
OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.          

312
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,376
CONCERNS OF THE DAM WOULD BREAK 
AND CAUSE MORE FLOODING.        

313
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,777
MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD   
OFFERING TO HELP THIS WOMAN

00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,415
EVACUATE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT   
OPENED THE GATES OF A DAM NEAR  

315
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,584

GERALDO RIVERA IS IN            

316
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:58,289

318
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:05,963
GERALDO, TELL US HOW IT IS FIRST
AND?                            

319
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:11,602
>> SHEP, LET ME WELCOME YOU TO  
PUERTO RICO ISLAND OF DESPAIR.  

320
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,605
THE ISLAND GOT RACKED BY        
HURRICANE IRMA TWO WEEKS AGO.   

321
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,443
THAT HURRICANE ACT OF 17% OF THE
POWER GRID.                     

322
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,382
THEN CAME THE MUCH MORE SAVAGE, 
POWERFUL HURRICANE MARIA, AND   

323
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,883
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED   
THIS ISLAND.                    

324
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:32,189
IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.           

325
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,558
80% OF THE CROPS HAD BEEN       
DESTROYED.                      

326
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:40,531
THERE IS NO ELECTRIC POWER SHEP,
THE POLLS ARE DOWN EVERYWHERE.  

327
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,636
THE LARGE CONDUCTIVE POLLS, THE 
TELEPHONE POLES, THERE'S VERY   

328
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:52,176
LITTLE COMMUNICATION.           
SO SERVICE, EXTREMELY SPOTTY.   

329
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,980
THERE IS NO SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS  
HAPPENING ON AN ISLAND WITH NO  

330
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,884
WATER AND NO FUEL THEN THE LINES
AT THE SERVICE STATIONS.        

331
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:08,059
NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF       
PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT

332
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:13,464
GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME      
AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS 

333
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,168
THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS   
STATION IN PUERTO RICO.         

334
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:21,772
WITHOUT GAS, THEY CAN'T RUN THE 
GENERATORS THAT THE FEW HAVE TWO

335
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,376
POWER THE WATER PUMPS THAT ALLOW
THEM NOT ONLY TO GET WATER TO   

336
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,380
BATHE AND DRINK, BUT ALSO TO RUN
THE TOILET.                     

337
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,150
THIS SITUATION IS AS DIRE AS YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.           

338
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:37,688
3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN 
THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION,   

339
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,890
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET     
WORSE.                          

340
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:44,328
THE MILLION AND A HALF GALLON   
ALREADY DELIVERED, A DROP IN THE

341
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,799
BUCKET, IT IS NEEDED.           
>> Shepard: IN YOUR OPINION,    

342
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:52,470
GERALDO, WITH INTEREST AND A LOT
OF LOVE THERE, ARE THEY GOING TO

343
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:56,374
NEED AN AIRLIFT OR BOLT LEFT    
OUT OF THERE AND TO, OR CAN THEY

344
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:04,181
GET THIS BACK UP AND RUNNING TO 
GET THIS FROM BEING A NECESSITY?

345
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,786
>> SHEP, THERE HAS BEEN AN      
EXODUS FROM PUERTO RICO SINCE   

346
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,089
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.           
THIS U.S. COMMONWEALTH IS       

347
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,758
BANKRUPT.                       
MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT   

348
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,762
THE ISLAND.                     
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE PEOPLE 

349
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,030
FORCED TO LIVE UNDER THE        
PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS, THE YOUNG 

350
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,000
ONES WILL LEAVE.                
WHAT HAPPENS, THE OLD AND FEEBLE

351
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,771
THEY STAY BEHIND, THEN YOU      
CANNOT LEAVE.                   

352
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,742
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSER, BY THE WAY. 
BUSINESSES INCREDIBLY DISRUPTED.

353
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:36,747
OF THE 3.4 MILLION, YOU'LL SEE A
TREMENDOUS EXODUS TO FLORIDA,   

354
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:40,184
NEW YORK STATE, AND LESS THIS   
POWER GRID IS RESTORED.         

355
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:46,390
IT WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE BEFORE.
IT WAS PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION, BY

356
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:51,829
INCOMPETENCE, BY SCANDALOUS     
DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE PURCHASING 

357
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,430
FUEL OIL, PURCHASED THE LOW     

358
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,435
WAS GREAT, IT SOLD FOR THE      
HIGHEST.                        

359
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:05,609
NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.      
TO BRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN 

360
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:09,513
AND THEY ARE NOBLE PEOPLE, AND  
ARE HELPING, BUT WITH THIS      

361
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,750
ISLAND NEEDS IS AN ENTIRE NEW   
POWER GRID.                     

362
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,152
3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A 
MANY STATES IN THE UNION.       

363
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,756
I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE  
IS A.                           

364
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,960
OF SEVERE DISRUPTION.           
THEY ARE SAYING THAT 4-6 MONTHS 

365
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,429
BEFORE THEY GET THE POWER GRID  
UP AND RUNNING SO PEOPLE WOULD  

366
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:30,968
GENERATORS, THIS WILL BECOME A  
SYMBOL OF WHAT THEY BECOME      

367
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,770
TODAY.                          
WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE   

368
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:36,140
BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF 
THE HURRICANES.                 

369
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:40,478
THE TOURISM HERE ALSO SHREDDED. 
THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.    

370
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:46,116
IT IS BECAUSE -- EIGHT HUGE     
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.            

371
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:50,120
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL     
JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE,

372
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,157
BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A        
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.            

373
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:58,395
PEOPLE ARE IN DIRE STRAITS.     
THIS WILL BE A MARSHALL PLAN    

374
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,233
SCALE REBUILDING OF THE         
ELECTRICAL GRID BEFORE YOU CAN  

375
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,936
HAVE THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS 
WE KNOW IT IN PUERTO RICO.      

376
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,173
ARMED GUARDS ON THE GASOLINE.   
ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK INTO THIS 

377
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,475
CRISIS.                         
IMAGINE A MONTH FROM NOW OR TWO 

378
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,545
MONTHS FROM NOW.                
KNOWING NO ONE HAD A HOT SHOWER,

379
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,750
NO ONE CAN FLUSH THE TOILET BUT 
FOR THE COSTLY INCLUSION OF A   

380
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:24,588
GALLON OF GAS IN THE COMMODE.   
IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO BE     

381
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,591
LIKE, SHEP.                     
THERE IS NO OVERSTATING THE     

382
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,527
CRISIS HERE, THE PRESIDENT      
SHOULD COME.                    

383
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,129
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR    
HIMSELF.                        

384
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:35,766
SEND MARCO RUBIO AND HEAD OF    
FEMA, THEY ARE HERE TODAY.      

385
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,270
THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE  
CAME IN WITH THE PLANE.         

386
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,007
ALL THOSE GESTURES ARE VERY     
IMPORTANT, BUT YOU NEED IT      

387
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,142
SYSTEMIC REFORM, WAY TO BAIL    
THESE PEOPLE OUT.               

388
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:48,178
IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.       
MY FAMILY, GOD KNOWS I LOVE     

389
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,481
THEM.                           
I LIVED IN THE VERY HOUSE WHEN I

390
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:55,452
WAS A TEENAGER.                 
THEY ARE HIGH-FUNCTIONING, THEIR

391
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,721
CHILDREN HAVE BECOME DOCTORS.   
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL  

392
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:04,194
HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE  
WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.

393
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,730
MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR  
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN   

394
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:11,335
LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT 
WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY, 

395
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:18,943
A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA  
MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.         

396
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,779
SPILLED BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR    
FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE OF        

397
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,112
PUERTO RICO                     

398
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:28,252
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.           
>> Shepard: WALL STREET WILL    

399
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:32,456
BE SHUTTING DOWN FOR THE DAY AND
JUST ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND 15     

400
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,993
SECONDS.                        
IT HAS BEEN A DOWN DAY.         

401
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:36,293
THE TACK                        

402
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,363
GOT WALLOPED TODAY, BUT THERE IS
SOME BRIGHT SPOT.               

403
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:44,602
NO CAVUTO CAN ALWAYS FIND HIM.  
YOU'LL START LOOKING FOR THEM   

404
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,936
WHEN "YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL     
CAVUTO BEGINS RIGHT AFTER THIS
