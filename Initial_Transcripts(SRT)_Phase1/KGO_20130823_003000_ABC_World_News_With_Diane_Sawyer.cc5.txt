[000:02:04;808] SIZE AND THE SOAP OF THIS BLAZE
[000:02:06;910] AS THESE PLUMES CONTINUE TO
[000:02:10;246] INTENSIFY AND GET DARKER AND DIE
[000:02:13;483] DOWN AGAIN AS THIS FIRE IS
[000:02:14;684] FOUGHT MAINLY FROM THE AIR.

[000:03:07;570] ENOUGH TO SERIOUSLY HURT SOMEONE

[000:03:11;274] IT'S UNUSUALLY BAD RIGHT NOW
[000:03:12;308] EVEN THOUGH THE WILDFIRE NUMBERS
[000:03:13;409] ARE DOWN NATIONWIDE.
[000:03:15;511] THEY'RE WAY UP IN CALIFORNIA

[000:03:24;554] WE FOUND HOMEOWNERS PACKED UP,
[000:03:25;622] READY TO LEAVE IF THEY HAVE TO.
[000:03:28;291] >> IF WE LOSE IT ALL, WE HAVE A
[000:03:30;426] GREAT INSURANCE POLICY, SO.
[000:03:31;494] >> HOPEFULLY IT WON'T COME TO
[000:03:32;195] THAT.

[000:05:30;480] SAYS THE CLAIMS THAT IT CARRIED
[000:05:31;214] OUT A CHEMICAL ATTACK ARE
[000:05:31;814] BASELESS.
[000:05:33;149] BUT THE WORLD IS REACTING
[000:05:33;816] SWIFTLY AND FORCEFULLY.
[000:05:36;352] AS U.N. INVESTIGATORS BEG FOR
[000:05:38;488] ACCESS TO THE SITE, THE EVIDENCE
[000:05:39;522] MAY BE QUICKLY DISSIPATING.

[000:07:14;784] TAKEN AWAY IN A HELICOPTER.
[000:07:16;385] A DRAMATIC CHANGE OF FORTUNE
[000:07:18;488] FROM OUR TIME THERE DURING THE
[000:07:19;222] REVOLUTION THAT BROUGHT HIM
[000:07:19;856] DOWN.

[000:08:19;815] INSIDE.
[000:08:22;351] THOSE PICTURES OF HIM CROSS
[000:08:23;953] DRESSING SHOWN AT TRIAL WERE
[000:08:25;021] REAL AND NOT A DEFENSE TACTIC.
[000:08:27;657] IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY,
[000:08:29;792] MANNING WROTE, "AS I TRANSITION

[000:08:57;954] RELEASING 700,000 DOCUMENTS TO
[000:09:00;590] WIKILEAKS, THE MILITARY DOES NOT
[000:09:02;725] OFFER THAT TYPE OF TREATMENT BUT
