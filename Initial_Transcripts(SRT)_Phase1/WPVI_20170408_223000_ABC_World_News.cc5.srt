TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A
DEFENSE.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
THE REASON YOU GENERALLY DON'T

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
HIT RUNWAYS IS THAT THEY ARE

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
EASY AND INEXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000

DOES APPEAR THAT IT'S OKAY FOR

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
MR. ASSAD TO BLOW UP HIS PEOPLE.
IT'S JUST NOT OKAY TO GAS THEM.

75

THIS TEENAGER DID.

DID HIS PROM STRATEGY WORK?

462
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
THAT'S COMING UP.

463
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
My hygienist told me to try...

464
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
...a mouthwash.
So I tried Crest.

465
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It does so much more than
give me fresh breath.

466
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Crest Pro-Health mouthwash
provides all...

467
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
...of these benefits to help you
get better dental check-ups.

468

Go Pro with Crest mouthwash.

469
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Checkup? Nailed it

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This

471
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
This
This is my body of proof.

472
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Proof of less joint pain

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and clearer skin.

474
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This is my body of proof that I
can take on psoriatic

475
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
arthritis with HUMIRA.

476
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
HUMIRA works by targeting and
helping to block a specific

477
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
source of inflammation that
contributes to both joint and

478
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
skin symptoms.

479
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's proven to help relieve
pain, stop further joint damage,

480
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
and clear skin in many adults.

481
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
HUMIRA is the #1
prescribed biologic

482
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
for psoriatic arthritis.

483
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability to
fight infections,

484
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
including tuberculosis.

485
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

486
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
including lymphoma, have
happened; as have blood, liver,

487
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and nervous system problems,
serious allergic reactions,

488
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and new or worsening heart
failure.

489
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Before treatment, get tested for
TB.

490
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Tell your doctor if you've been
to areas where certain

491
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
fungal infections are common,

492
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and if you've had TB,
hepatitis B,

493
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
are prone to infections, or have
flu-like symptoms or sores.

494
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Don't start HUMIRA if you have
an infection.

495
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Want more proof? Ask your
rheumatologist about HUMIRA.
