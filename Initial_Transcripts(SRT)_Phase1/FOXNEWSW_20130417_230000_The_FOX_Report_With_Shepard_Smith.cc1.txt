[000:00:35;29] IN THE BOMBING LOOKS FOR

[000:01:12;03] WE ARE LIVE BOILSTON STREET  
[000:01:13;14] ON THE BACK BAY OF BOSTON.  
[000:01:15;14] A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE SCENE  
[000:01:17;05] OF MONDAY'S BOMBING AND  
[000:01:18;15] WHAT HAS BEEN A SOMEWHAT  
[000:01:19;28] CHAOTIC DAY HERE.  
[000:01:20;19] JUST MINUTES AGO A FEDERAL  
[000:01:22;24] SOURCE TELLING FOX NEWS  
[000:01:23;19] INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING  
[000:01:24;16] FOR TWO PERSONS OF INTEREST  
[000:01:27;12] IN CONNECTION WITH MONDAY'S  
[000:01:28;11] ATTACK.  
[000:01:28;25] NOW, BOTH MEN CAPTURED IN  
[000:01:30;08] PHOTOS FROM THE SCENE.  
[000:01:31;23] MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT.  
[000:01:33;13] OF COURSE, HOURS AGO WE  
[000:01:34;20] HEARD REPORTS THAT AN  
[000:01:35;17] ARREST WAS IMMINENT IN THE  
[000:01:37;14] ATTACKS.  
[000:01:37;28] SOME TALK THAT AN ARREST  
[000:01:38;20] HAD ALREADY HAPPENED.  
[000:01:39;20] THE FBI LATER SAYING THERE  
[000:01:41;02] WERE NO ARREST AND HAS NOT  
[000:01:42;08] BEEN ONE.  
[000:01:43;03] NOBODY TO BRING TO COURT  
[000:01:44;11] HERE IN BOSTON.  
[000:01:46;04] BUT AT THIS HOUR, WE'RE  
[000:01:47;16] STILL AWAITING A NEWS  
[000:01:48;23] CONFERENCE FROM  
[000:01:49;11] INVESTIGATORS THAT HAS BEEN  
[000:01:50;09] RESCHEDULED OVER AND OVER  
[000:01:52;05] AGAIN.  
[000:01:53;21] POSTPONED WAS THE WORD WE  
[000:01:54;19] HEARD LATE TONIGHT.  
[000:01:55;24] RICK LEVENTHAL MONITORING  
[000:01:57;16] DEVELOPMENTS ALL DAY.  
[000:01:58;07] IS HE LIVE IN BOSTON WITH  
[000:01:59;05] ME AS WELL.  
[000:02:00;00] RICK, YOU BROKE THE NEWS OF  
[000:02:01;07] THESE TWO PERSONS OF  
[000:02:03;08] INTEREST.  
[000:02:03;23] WHAT MORE YOU CAN REPORT?  
[000:02:05;19] >> WELL, OBVIOUSLY BILL,  
[000:02:07;10] THE FOCUS HERE HAS TO BE ON  
[000:02:09;22] CAPTURING THE PERSON OR  
[000:02:11;12] PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR  
[000:02:12;05] THIS HORRIFIC ATTACK ON THE  
[000:02:13;25] BOSTON MARATHON THAT KILLED  
[000:02:14;20] THREE AND WOUNDED NEARLY  
[000:02:17;04] 180 OTHERS.  
[000:02:18;19] WE HAVE SEEN THE  
[000:02:19;28] PHOTOGRAPHS OF TWO MEN WHO  
[000:02:22;29] FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE  
[000:02:24;03] LOOKING FOR AS PERSONS OF  
[000:02:26;03] INTEREST.  
[000:02:26;18] POSSIBLE SUSPECTS IN THOSE  
[000:02:28;17] TWIN BOMBINGS ON MONDAY.  
[000:02:30;11] WE ARE NOT SHARING THOSE  
[000:02:31;06] PHOTOGRAPHS WITH OUR  
[000:02:31;29] VIEWERS YET BECAUSE THE FBI  
[000:02:32;24] IS NOT SHARING THOSE  
[000:02:33;29] PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THE  
[000:02:34;19] PUBLIC.  
[000:02:35;03] WE DON'T WANT TO JENNIFER  
[000:02:36;16] DYES THIS INVESTIGATION.  
[000:02:37;23] BUT, I HAVE SEEN THESE  
[000:02:39;19] PICTURES.  
[000:02:40;04] THEY ARE VERY CLEAR.  
[000:02:41;00] THERE ARE TWO MEN ONE  
[000:02:42;28] APPEARS TO BE CARRYING A  
[000:02:44;21] BACKPACK.  
[000:02:45;06] THE OTHER APPEARS TO HAVE A  
[000:02:46;12] BAG.  
[000:02:46;24] THESE BAGS MATCH THE  
[000:02:48;23] DESCRIPTION THAT THE  
[000:02:49;13] FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE  
[000:02:50;09] TOLD US ARE BELIEVED TO BE  
[000:02:53;29] CARRIED THE TWO BOMBS ON  
[000:02:57;09] MONDAY.  
[000:02:57;23] AGAIN NOT SHOWING THE  
[000:02:58;17] PHOTOS UNTIL THE FEDERAL  
[000:02:59;22] AUTHORITIES ASK THE MEDIA  
[000:03:00;20] TO SHARE THESE PICTURES  
[000:03:01;23] BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE  
[000:03:03;00] SURE WE DON'T JEOPARDIZE  
[000:03:04;14] ANY INVESTIGATION AND THAT  
[000:03:05;08] IF THE FBI DOES HAVE LEADS  
[000:03:06;14] AND IS AFTER THESE MEN THAT  
[000:03:08;01] THEY HAVE EVERY CHANCE TO  
[000:03:08;29] CATCH THEM.  
[000:03:09;16] I THINK, BILL, ONE OF THE  
[000:03:11;00] REASONS WHY ALL OF THOSE  
[000:03:12;15] REPORTS SURFACED EARLIER  
[000:03:13;19] TODAY ABOUT POSSIBLE  
[000:03:14;21] SUSPECTS EITHER BEING  
[000:03:15;17] IDENTIFIED OR BEING IN  
[000:03:16;19] CUSTODY IS BECAUSE THESE  
[000:03:17;27] PHOTOS BEGAN CIRCULATING  
[000:03:20;02] AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AND  
[000:03:20;25] THERE WAS CONFUSION ABOUT  
[000:03:22;20] WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD  
[000:03:23;18] BEEN ARREST BUT ABOUT THE  
[000:03:24;25] FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN  
[000:03:26;00] SUSPECTS OR PERSONS OF  
[000:03:27;06] INTEREST WHO HAVE BEEN  
[000:03:28;01] IDENTIFIED OR AT LEAST  
[000:03:29;08] ISOLATED BY LAW  
[000:03:29;26] ENFORCEMENT.  
[000:03:33;18] >> Bill: SO YOU HAVE SEEN  
[000:03:34;11] THE PHOTOS, RICK, AND BASED  
[000:03:35;14] ON THE IMKNOWLEDGES YOU  
[000:03:36;22] SAW, HOW CLEAR ARE THE  
[000:03:37;20] FACES ON THESE PHOTOS?  
[000:03:40;07] >> THEY ARE PRETTY CLEAR.  
[000:03:42;18] THERE ARE MULTIPLE ANGLES  
[000:03:44;13] AND YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE  
[000:03:45;09] THEIR FACES.  
[000:03:46;27] AND I HOPE AND I BELIEVE  
[000:03:49;08] THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT USING  
[000:03:50;16] THOSE PHOTOS CAN POSITIVELY  
[000:03:52;16] IDENTIFY THE MEN AND  
[000:03:53;23] WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE THE  
[000:03:54;16] MEN WHO ARE ACTUALLY  
[000:03:55;20] RESPONSIBLE REMAINS TO BE  
[000:03:56;22] SEEN.  
[000:03:57;18] >> QUICKLY RICK, WE HAVE  
[000:03:59;06] ALSO LEARNED EARLIER TODNVESTIGATORS
[000:04:00;03] FOUND  
[000:04:00;25] MORE POSSIBLE PARTS FROM  
[000:04:01;17] THE BOMB.  
[000:04:02;10] WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY THAN  
[000:04:03;22] FROM LAST NIGHT ON THAT?  
[000:04:05;23] >> WELL, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW  
[000:04:07;05] THAT THESE CRIME SCENE  
[000:04:08;17] TECHNICIANS HAVE BEEN ON  
[000:04:09;11] SCENE ON BOILSTON STREET  
[000:04:11;01] FOR DAYS NOW COLLECTING  
[000:04:12;12] EVIDENCE, INCLUDING  
[000:04:13;05] APPARENTLY THE LID FROM A  
[000:04:14;03] PRESSURE COOKER THAT BLEW  
[000:04:15;18] UP ON TO ONE OF THE ROOFS  
[000:04:17;17] ALONG BOILSTON STREET AFTER  
[000:04:18;20] THE BLAST.  
[000:04:19;16] WE ARE TOLD BY FEDERAL  
[000:04:20;26] AUTHORITIES THAT A PRESSURE  
[000:04:21;27] COOKER WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE  
[000:04:23;00] BEEN USED IN AT LEAST ONE  
[000:04:24;03] OF THE TWO BOMBS.  
[000:04:25;02] IT WAS PACKED WITH NAILS  
[000:04:26;10] AND BALL BEARINGS AND WE  
[000:04:27;18] HAVE SEEN THE PHOTOS OF  
[000:04:28;27] THOSE NAILS AND BALL  
[000:04:30;08] BEARINGS.  
[000:04:30;23] WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE PHOTO  
[000:04:31;27] OF THE BLACK BACKPACK THAT  
[000:04:33;26] WAS SHREDDED AFTER THAT  
[000:04:34;26] BOMB WENT OFF.  
[000:04:35;16] WE ALSO KNOW THAT FEDERAL  
[000:04:37;00] AUTHORITIES ARE CAREFULLY  
[000:04:38;15] SCANNING HUNDREDS, IF NOT  
[000:04:40;10] THOUSANDS OF IMAGES, STILL  
[000:04:42;01] PICTURES AND VIDEO FROM THE  
[000:04:43;26] SCENE.  
[000:04:44;10] AGAIN, TRYING TO LINK UP  
[000:04:45;02] THE MEN WHO ARE BELIEVED TO  
[000:04:46;22] BE RESPONSIBLE WITH IMAGES  
[000:04:48;00] FROM BOILSTON STREET, BILL?  
[000:04:50;07] >> Bill: THANK YOU, RICK.  
[000:04:51;00] GOOD WORK TODAY.  
[000:04:51;23] RICK LEVENTHAL THROUGHOUT    THROUGH
[000:04:55;17] THE  
[000:04:55;29] THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT HE  
[000:04:59;11] WILL BE WITH US.  
[000:05:01;24] INVESTIGATORS HAD ARRESTED  
[000:05:02;17] A SUSPECT AND WAS BRINGING  
[000:05:03;18] HIM THERE.  
[000:05:04;29] ALTHOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT  
[000:05:05;21] OFFICIALS LATER DENYING  
[000:05:06;25] REPORTS OF AN ARREST.  
[000:05:07;26] THOSE DENIALS CAME AFTER A  
[000:05:09;03] CRUSH OF MEDIA DESCENDED ON  
[000:05:10;19] THE COURTHOUSE LOOKING FOR  
[000:05:11;22] ANY GLIMPSE OF A POSSIBLE  
[000:05:14;08] SUSPECT.  
[000:05:14;22] EVERYONE ON HIGH ALERT  
[000:05:15;13] THERE AS CAN YOU IMAGINE.  
[000:05:16;17] THIS IS WHERE A SUSPECT  
[000:05:17;10] MIGHT GO IF THE FEDS HAD  
[000:05:18;14] MADE AN ARREST.  
[000:05:19;28] THEN WORD OF A BOMB THREAT  
[000:05:23;14] INSIDE -- INSIDE THE  
[000:05:24;25] COURTHOUSE, FORCING WORKERS  
[000:05:25;29] TO LEAVE.  
[000:05:26;25] THEY SAID IT WAS A CODE RED  
[000:05:27;29] IN THE MEDIA WAS FORCED TO  
[000:05:29;15] STEP BACK.  
[000:05:30;05] WE'RE TOLD THAT ULTIMATELY  
[000:05:31;12] TURNED OUT TO BE A FALSE  
[000:05:33;00] ALARM.  
[000:05:33;13] AND YOU CAN SEE WORKERS  
[000:05:34;23] PUSHING CRIBS DOWN THE  
[000:05:35;25] STREET, POSSIBLY FROM THE  
[000:05:36;18] DAY CARE CENTER INSIDE THAT  
[000:05:38;01] COURTHOUSE IN BOSTON.  
[000:05:40;06] TOP INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY  
[000:05:41;15] HAVE RECEIVED PROMISING  
[000:05:44;08] INTELLIGENCE FROM THE  
[000:05:44;29] PHOTOS AND THE VIDEO TAKEN  
[000:05:46;07] BEFORE THE TWIN BOMBINGS,  
[000:05:47;23] THAT'S WHAT A CONGRESSIONAL

[000:05:57;02] CATHERINE?  
[000:05:57;17] >> WELL, THANK YOU BILL.  
[000:05:58;20] CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES  
[000:05:59;17] TELLING FOX NEWS THAT THE  
[000:06:00;10] FBI DID NOT BRIEF THE FULL

[000:06:22;28] OF THE WORKING THEORIES IS  
[000:06:24;05] THAT THE DEVICE USING LOW  
[000:06:25;12] EXPLOSIVES WAS PROBABLY PUT  
[000:06:26;08] TOGETHER FAIRLY CLOSED TO

[000:06:36;25] AREA, BILL.  
[000:06:38;22] >> Bill: INVESTIGATORS ALSO

[000:06:41;05] COMPONENTS OF THOSE  
[000:06:42;05] EXPLOSIVES RIGHT  
[000:06:43;11] CATHERINE?  
[000:06:43;26] >> WELL, FOX NEWS HAS TOLD  
[000:06:45;05] BOMB COMPONENTS ARE NOW AT  
[000:06:46;21] THE FBI CRIME LAB IN

[000:06:52;05] KEY COMPONENTS DESCRIBED TO  
[000:06:53;02] US AS RELATIVELY INTACT,  
[000:06:54;21] WHICH SEEMS TO BODE WELL  
[000:06:56;15] FOR INVESTIGATORS.  
[000:06:57;13] THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT  
[000:06:58;04] BULLETIN OBTAINED BY FOX

[000:07:09;07] THE SECOND DEVICE IS SO  
[000:07:10;04] BADLY DAMAGED IT WAS ONLY  
[000:07:12;01] DESCRIBED SIMPLY AS A METAL  
[000:07:14;11] CONTAINER.  
[000:07:14;26] BOTH DEVICES SAY THE TYPE

[000:07:30;05] EXPLOSIVE DEVICE HERE IN  
[000:07:30;27] THE U.S. IS UNFORTUNATELY  
[000:07:32;04] NOT NEW.

[000:07:34;13] TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED  
[000:07:35;22] OVERSEAS, IT'S SOMETHING  
[000:07:36;14] THAT IS WELL UNDERSTOOD

[000:07:43;16] WHO ARE WORKING THIS, AS  
[000:07:45;05] WELL AS BASED ON MY OWN  
[000:07:46;24] EXPERIENCE, IS THAT WE HAVE  
[000:07:48;09] ANTICIPATED SOMETHING LIKE  
[000:07:49;02] THIS COULD HAPPEN.  
[000:07:49;21] WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO  
[000:07:50;19] PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING.  
[000:07:51;16] BUT YOU CAN'T BE 100%  
[000:07:54;17] SUCCESSFUL THAT THE KEY  
[000:07:55;09] HERE IS TO BE QUICK AND  
[000:07:57;06] DILIGENT IN THE  
[000:07:58;08] INVESTIGATION, BUT ALSO TO  
[000:07:59;08] BE RESILIENT.  
[000:08:00;28] >> FOX NEWS ASKED THE FBI  
[000:08:02;05] TO COMMENT ON THE STATUS OF  
[000:08:03;29] THE BOMB ANALYSIS BUT THERE  
[000:08:05;06] WAS NO IMMEDIATE RESPONSE,  
[000:08:08;02] BILL.

[000:08:09;11] YOU FROM WASHINGTON.  
[000:08:10;01] >> YOU ARE WELCOME.  
[000:08:10;21] >> TO OUR VIEWERS AT HOME  
[000:08:11;20] WE HAD EXPECTED AN FBI  
[000:08:13;10] BRIEFING.  
[000:08:13;25] THAT WAS POSTPONED.  
[000:08:14;16] THEIR WORDS FROM EARLIER  
[000:08:15;19] TONIGHT.  
[000:08:16;03] IT STILL MAY HAPPEN THIS  
[000:08:17;02] EVENING.  
[000:08:17;16] IF IT DOES DURING THIS  
[000:08:18;21] BROADCAST, WE WILL  
[000:08:19;10] CERTAINLY BRING THAT TO YOU  
[000:08:20;22] LIVE.  
[000:08:21;06] ALSO, A MAJOR STORY  
[000:08:22;14] BREAKING EARLIER TODAY AND  
[000:08:24;12] THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  
[000:08:25;23] THE FBI TELLING FOX THERE  
[000:08:27;02] IS NO SIGN OF ANY  
[000:08:28;07] CONNECTION BETWEEN THE  
[000:08:30;01] BOMBINGS HERE IN BOSTON AND  
[000:08:31;06] THOSE SUSPICIOUS LETTERS  
[000:08:32;16] TURNING UP IN WASHINGTON.  
[000:08:33;21] INVESTIGATORS SAY EARLY  
[000:08:34;24] TESTS ON LETTERS SENT TO  
[000:08:36;19] PRESIDENT OBAMA AND  
[000:08:38;00] MISSISSIPPI REPUBLICAN  
[000:08:38;25] SENATOR ROGER WICKER WERE  
[000:08:40;12] POSITIVE FOR RICIN.  
[000:08:41;17] THAT'S A DEADLY POISON.  
[000:08:43;24] 6,000 TIMES MORE POISONOUS  
[000:08:45;12] THEY SAY THAN MANY OTHER  
[000:08:50;24] ITEMS E% SAY PRELIMINARY  
[000:08:52;14] TESTS CAN BE WRONG AND  
[000:08:53;06] THEY'RE WAITING FOR FINAL  
[000:08:54;29] RESULTS.  
[000:08:55;13] OFFICIALS SAY THEY  
[000:08:56;19] INTERCEPTED BOTH LETTERS  
[000:08:57;11] BEFORE THEY GOT TO THE  
[000:08:58;02] WHITE HOUSE OR THE CAPITOL  
[000:09:00;25] BUILDING.  
[000:09:01;10] MIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE ON THE  
[000:09:02;04] HILL THERE.  
[000:09:02;20] THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES  
[000:09:03;14] BETWEEN THE TWO LETTERS.  
[000:09:04;06] WHAT ARE THEY?  
[000:09:04;25] >> WELL, BILL, THAT'S  
[000:09:06;09] RIGHT.  
[000:09:06;22] AN FBI OPERATIONS BULLETIN  
[000:09:08;12] OBTAINED BY FOX REVEALS  
[000:09:11;00] SIMILARITIES.  
[000:09:11;17] BOTH WERE POSTMARKED  
[000:09:12;27] MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE ON APRIL  
[000:09:14;07] THE 8TH.  
[000:09:15;08] THERE WAS SOME IDENTICAL  
[000:09:17;13] WORDING.  
[000:09:17;27] AND THE SAME SIGNATURE IMKC  
[000:09:21;25] AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.  
[000:09:23;18] AT THE WHITE HOUSE WE  
[000:09:25;09] RECEIVED THIS UPDATE.  
[000:09:26;11] >> THERE WAS A LETTER SENTTO THE 
[000:09:28;05] PRESIDENT, THAT AT AN OFF

[000:09:34;24] TO HAVE CONTAINED A  
[000:09:36;11] SUSPICIOUS SUBSTANCE AND  
[000:09:37;04] TESTS WERE UNDERTAKEN.  
[000:09:38;11] THE FBI HAS THE LEAD IN  
[000:09:40;05] THAT INVESTIGATION.  
[000:09:41;18] >> IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT  
[000:09:42;25] BOTH LETTERS DID NOT REACH  
[000:09:44;17] THE WHITE HOUSE OR THE  
[000:09:46;10] CAPITOL COMPLEX.

[000:09:52;03] MR. .  
[000:09:52;16] >> Bill: YEAH, RICIN CAN BE  
[000:09:53;10] A KILLER.  
[000:09:53;25] IT'S MORE POISONOUS.  
[000:09:55;04] WE HAD AN EXPERT ON TODAY  
[000:09:58;20] SAYING 6,000 MORE TIMES  
[000:10:00;01] POISON NEWS THAN CYANIDE.  
[000:10:01;17] THIS IS DANGEROUS MATERIAL

[000:10:35;03] INSPECTOR.  
[000:10:35;25] A TOP SENATE LEADER SAYS SO

[000:16:38;10] BACK UP FOR A POTENTIAL  
[000:16:40;00] VOTE.

[000:17:42;11] LEADER HARRY REID DID VOTE  
[000:17:43;20] NO.

[000:19:46;28] RA PATIENTS    AND THOSE NOT HELPED
[000:19:49;03] ENOUGH    BY OTHER TREATMENTS.   
[000:19:51;24] DO NOT TAKE ORENCIA    WITH ANOTHER
[000:19:52;22] BIOLOGIC MEDICINE    FOR RA    DUE
[000:19:53;29] TO AN INCREASED RISK    OF SERIOUS
[000:19:54;20] INFECTION.    SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS

[000:20:52;20] NAME OF LU LING G.P.S. ZI.  
[000:20:56;19] A CHINESE CITIZEN STUDYING  
[000:20:58;17] MATT AND STATISTICS AND  
[000:21:00;12] WATCHING THE RACE NEAR THE  
[000:21:02;01] FINISH LINE WHEN THE BOMB  
[000:21:04;28] EXPLODED.  
[000:21:05;13] OTHER TWO 8-YEAR-OLD MARTIN  
[000:21:06;26] RICHARD AND 29-YEAR-OLD  
[000:21:09;11] CHRIS KRYSTLE CAMPBELL.  
[000:21:12;19] TODAY WE GOT UPDATE HOW  
[000:21:14;06] SOME OF THEM ARE DOING.

[000:21:29;26] COMING OUT OF THE HOSPITALS  
[000:21:31;17] OVERALL IS OPTIMISTIC.  
[000:21:32;25] DOCTORS DON'T ANTICIPATE  
[000:21:33;29] ANY FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE  
[000:21:34;27] AND THEY DON'T ANTICIPATE  
[000:21:36;03] THE NEED FOR ANY  
[000:21:38;11] AMPUTATIONS.  
[000:21:38;27] THAT BEING SAID, THERE IS A

[000:21:50;10] THE PATIENTS IT'S ABOUT  
[000:21:51;08] THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL.  
[000:21:52;00] WE WORK WITH THEM FROM THE  
[000:21:53;19] BEGINNING.  
[000:21:54;04] THERE IS NO, AS FAR AS I  
[000:21:55;09] KNOW ANY MAGIC BULLETS TO  
[000:21:57;24] PREVENT THIS.  
[000:21:58;12] BUT WE NEED TO, AGAIN, IT'S  
[000:22:01;12] A PROCESS AND EVOLVES OVER  
[000:22:02;19] TIME AND IT'S SOMETHING  
[000:22:03;24] AGAIN, THAT PEOPLE NEED NOT  
[000:22:04;28] TO FORGET ABOUT THAT IT'S  
[000:22:06;29] SOMETHING THAT CAN BE WITH

[000:22:32;06] ALL OF THAT BEING PULLED  
[000:22:33;10] OUT OF THE BOMBING VICTIMS  
[000:22:35;09] BILL.  
[000:22:35;22] >> Bill: TOMORROW IS GOING  
[000:22:36;15] TO BE ANOTHER EMOTIONAL  
[000:22:37;10] DAY.  
[000:22:37;22] WHAT ARE THE PLANS AS WE  
[000:22:39;11] UNDERSTAND THEM TONIGHT  
[000:22:40;27] MIKE FOR THE PRESIDENTS  
[000:22:42;01] VISIT AT THAT CHURCH BEHIND  
[000:22:44;08] YOU?

[000:22:49;28] HE WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY  
[000:22:51;06] THE FIRST LADY.  
[000:22:51;24] IT WILL BE AN INTERFAITH  
[000:22:53;12] SERVICE.  
[000:22:53;26] THE PRESIDENT IS SAID TO BE  
[000:22:55;01] DELIVERING A MESSAGE OF  
[000:22:59;01] SHARED PAIN NOT JUST WITH  
[000:22:59;26] THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE  
[000:23:00;26] RUN ITSELF OR THE PEOPLE  
[000:23:01;28] WHO LIVE HERE IN BOSTON BUT  
[000:23:03;10] THE PEOPLE -- THE PEOPLE IN  
[000:23:04;18] THE RUN ITSELF.  
[000:23:06;03] AND A SHARED SENSE OF  
[000:23:07;06] RESPECT TO THE PEOPLE WHO  
[000:23:08;15] RESPONDED AND SAVED LIVES.  
[000:23:10;14] NO WORD NOW IF THE  
[000:23:13;14] PRESIDENT INTENDS TO VISIT  
[000:23:14;09] WITH THE VICTIMS AND/OR  
[000:23:15;14] THEIR FAMILIES, BILL.  
[000:23:18;20] >> Bill: MIKE, THANKS.  
[000:23:19;13] SEE YOU TOMORROW.  
[000:23:20;27] MIKE TOBIN FROM THE CHURCH  
[000:23:22;23] TONIGHT.  
[000:23:23;07] WE ARE ALSO HEARING TONIGHT  
[000:23:24;16] FROM A HERO BY THE NAME OF  
[000:23:25;29] TYLER WHO HELPED COMFORT A  
[000:23:28;22] YOUNG WOMAN SUFFERING  
[000:23:30;05] SHRAPNEL WOUNDS FROM THE  
[000:23:30;27] TERRORIST ATTACKS.  
[000:23:31;19] YESTERDAY THE MASSACHUSETTS  
[000:23:32;25] GOVERNOR DEVOL PATRICK SAID  
[000:23:34;08] HE VISITED THE WOMAN  
[000:23:35;20] VICTORIA IN THE HOSPITAL  
[000:23:36;12] AND SHE SAID THAT TYLER  
[000:23:37;25] HELPED CALM HER DOWN, EVEN  
[000:23:40;02] SHOWING HER HIS OWN SCAR ON  
[000:23:41;13] HIS BODY.  
[000:23:42;18] >> VICTORIA VERY VERY MUCH  
[000:23:44;08] WANTS TO THANK TYLER  
[000:23:46;07] PERSONALLY SO.  
[000:23:46;24] IF TYLER IS OUT THERE AND  
[000:23:47;26] LISTENING OR READING YOUR  
[000:23:48;28] REPORTS, WE WOULD LOVE TO  
[000:23:50;19] HEAR FROM TYLER SO THAT WE  
[000:23:52;04] CAN CONNECT HIM TO VICTOR I  
[000:23:53;15] CAN'T.  
[000:23:54;18] >> WELL, OUR LOCAL  
[000:23:56;18] AFFILIATE FOX BOSTON CAUGHT  
[000:23:57;12] UP WITH A MAN TYLER DODD  
[000:23:59;12] IS HIS NAME.  
[000:24:00;05] HE SAID THAT INSIDE THE  
[000:24:01;18] MEDICAL TENT HE COULD SEE  
[000:24:02;26] THE TERROR IN VICTORIA'S  
[000:24:04;26] EYES.  
[000:24:05;09] >> I JUST KNEW THAT I HAD  
[000:24:07;13] TO TALK TO HER.  
[000:24:08;27] IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE I  
[000:24:10;06] COULD DO, I COULD TALK TO  
[000:24:11;28] HER.  
[000:24:12;11] I ASKED HER TO LOOK AT ME.  
[000:24:13;20] I THINK I ASKED HER WHAT  
[000:24:15;09] HER NAME WAS.  
[000:24:16;17] AND SHE KIND OF LOOKED AT  
[000:24:17;19] ME FUNNY LIKE WHY IS THIS  
[000:24:19;02] GUY ASKING MY NAME?  
[000:24:20;06] SHE SAID VICTORIA IS MY  
[000:24:21;28] NAME.  
[000:24:22;11] I SAID MY NAME IS TYLER.  
[000:24:23;14] IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.  
[000:24:25;07] >> WELL, JOB WELL DONE,  
[000:24:27;27] TYLER.  
[000:24:28;10] CONTRARY TO SOME EARLY  
[000:24:29;03] REPORTING THOUGH, TYLER  
[000:24:30;11] DODD SAYS HE NEVER SERVED  
[000:24:31;19] IN THE MILITARY BUT HE  
[000:24:32;23] ADDED THAT VICTORIA'S  
[000:24:34;11] STRENGTH PROVED TO BE  
[000:24:35;25] INSPIRING.  
[000:24:36;17] >> WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE  
[000:24:37;20] FOR THIS, IT WAS MEANT TO  
[000:24:39;15] INSTILL TERROR AND FEAR AND  
[000:24:41;18] CHAOS.  
[000:24:42;01] WHAT I TAKE AWAY FROM IT IS  
[000:24:44;05] THE TRUE HUMAN SPIRIT AND  
[000:24:45;29] MULTIPLE NARNLTS  
[000:24:48;24] NATIONALITIES AND CULTURES  
[000:24:49;24] COMING TOGETHER TO HELP  
[000:24:50;29] EACH OTHER OUT.  
[000:24:51;24] >> YEAH, FOX BOSTON ALSO  
[000:24:55;03] REPORTS THAT TYLER AND  
[000:24:57;03] VICTORIA, THEY ARE  
[000:24:57;22] ARRANGING TO MEET EACH  
[000:24:59;12] OTHER YET AGAIN THIS TIME  
[000:25:01;29] AT MEDICAL CENTER WHERE  
[000:25:03;18] VICTORIA IS RECOVERING AND  
[000:25:04;18] THAT WILL BE QUITE A  
[000:25:06;11] REUNION.  
[000:25:06;25] SOME CRIME SCENE PHOTOS NOW  
[000:25:07;25] SPREADING OVER THE INTERNET  
[000:25:09;00] COULD HELP FEDERAL  
[000:25:09;26] INVESTIGATORS IN THEIR  
[000:25:10;17] SEARCH FOR A SUSPECT.  
[000:25:11;23] AND WE WILL EXPLAIN WHY IN  
[000:25:12;23] A MOMENT ON THAT.  
[000:25:13;27] PLUS, A NEW TWIST IN THE  
[000:25:15;26] KILLINGS OF A TEXAS  
[000:25:16;22] DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND HIS  
[000:25:18;14] WIFE.  
[000:25:18;27] NOW, THE WIFE OF A MAN  
[000:25:20;09] ALREADY UNDER ARREST HAS  
[000:25:21;05] JUST MADE A BIG CONFESSION.  
[000:25:23;05] THAT IS NEXT AS FOX REPORTS  
[000:25:26;02] LIVE FROM BOSTON TONIGHT.
[000:27:00;08] [ Male Announcer ]    IT'S SIMPLE
[000:27:00;29] PHYSICS...    A BODY AT REST    TENDS
[000:27:01;29] TO STAY AT REST...    WHILE A BODY
[000:27:03;14] IN MOTION    TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.
[000:27:06;06] STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY    EASE
[000:27:06;27] ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.    BUT IF YOU
[000:27:09;28] HAVE ARTHRITIS,    STAYING ACTIVE
[000:27:11;09] CAN BE DIFFICULT.    PRESCRIPTION
[000:27:12;26] CELEBREX    CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS
[000:27:13;18] PAIN    SO YOUR BODY    CAN STAY IN
[000:27:16;07] MOTION.    BECAUSE JUST ONE    200MG
[000:27:17;29] CELEBREX A DAY    CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR
[000:27:20;28] RELIEF    FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS
[000:27:22;18] PAIN    AND INFLAMMATION.    PLUS,
[000:27:25;15] IN CLINICAL STUDIES    CELEBREX IS
[000:27:26;14] PROVEN TO IMPROVE    DAILY PHYSICAL
[000:27:27;04] FUNCTION    SO MOVING IS EASIER. 
[000:27:30;14] CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN    WITH OR WITHOUT
[000:27:31;10] FOOD.    AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.
[000:27:35;05] YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR    SHOULD BALANCE
[000:27:35;28] THE BENEFITS    WITH THE RISKS.  
[000:27:38;08] ALL PRESCRIPTION NSAIDS,    LIKE CELEBREX,
[000:27:39;03] IBUPROFEN    NAPROXEN AND MELOXICAM
[000:27:42;07] HAVE THE SAME    CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.
[000:27:44;17] THEY ALL MAY INCREASE    THE CHANCE
[000:27:45;23] OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE    WHICH
[000:27:46;14] CAN LEAD TO DEATH.    THIS CHANCE
[000:27:48;16] INCREASES    IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE
[000:27:50;07] OR RISK FACTORS    SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD
[000:27:51;02] PRESSURE    OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
[000:27:53;06] FOR LONG PERIODS.    NSAIDS, LIKE
[000:27:55;13] CELEBREX    INCREASE THE CHANCE OF
[000:27:56;12] SERIOUS    SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS
[000:27:58;21] OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE    PROBLEMS
[000:28:00;16] SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS    WHICH
[000:28:01;14] CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING    AND MAY
[000:28:02;07] CAUSE DEATH.    PATIENTS ALSO TAKING
[000:28:04;12] ASPIRIN    AND THE ELDERLY    ARE
[000:28:05;19] AT INCREASED RISK FOR    STOMACH BLEEDING
[000:28:06;15] AND ULCERS.    DON'T TAKE CELEBREX
[000:28:09;06] IF YOU HAVE BLEEDING    IN THE STOMACH
[000:28:10;01] OR INTESTINE    OR HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK,
[000:28:12;05] HIVES    OTHER ALLERGIES TO ASPIRIN,
[000:28:13;09] NSAIDS OR SULFONAMIDES.    GET HELP
[000:28:15;06] RIGHT AWAY IF YOU HAVE    SWELLING
[000:28:15;26] OF THE FACE OR THROAT,    OR TROUBLE
[000:28:18;17] BREATHING.    TELL YOUR DOCTOR   
[000:28:19;17] YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY.    AND FIND
[000:28:20;28] AN ARTHRITIS TREATMENT    FOR YOU.
[000:28:23;00] VISIT CELEBREX.COM AND ASK    YOUR
[000:28:23;23] DOCTOR ABOUT CELEBREX.    FOR A BODY
[000:28:27;20] IN MOTION.    
[000:29:05;16] >> Bill: A MAJOR  
[000:29:07;10] DEVELOPMENT IN THE MURDERS  
[000:29:08;03] OF A DISTRICT ATTORNEY, HIS  
[000:29:08;27] WIFE, AND A DEPUTY D.A.

[000:29:15;07] REPORTED PRIME SUSPECT.  
[000:29:16;29] INSTEAD, IT IS HIS WIFE,

[000:29:27;07] HUSBAND ERIC WILLIAMS, A  
[000:29:28;11] FORMER JUSTICE OF THE

[000:29:29;24] THEY SAY HE MADE  
[000:29:31;21] TERRORISTISTIC THREAT  
[000:29:32;12] AGAINST COUNTY EMPLOYEES.  
[000:29:33;18] HE LOST HIS JOB ABOUT A  
[000:29:34;23] YEAR AGO AFTER PROSECUTORS  
[000:29:36;07] CONVICTED HIM OF STEALING  
[000:29:38;04] COMPUTERS.  
[000:29:38;19] NOW, THOSE SAME PROSECUTO  
[000:29:40;02] RECENTLY TURNED UP DEAD  
[000:29:42;06] ALONG WITH THE D.A.'S WIFE  
[000:29:44;27] CASEY STEGALL HAS MORE IN  
[000:29:46;21] OUR DALLAS NEWSROOM.  
[000:29:47;13] DID THE WIFE SAY THAT SHE  
[000:29:48;07] WAS THE ONE WHO PULLED THE  
[000:29:49;22] TRIGGER.  
[000:29:50;20] >> BILL, GOOD EVENING TO

[000:30:03;16] HUSBAND ERIC IS THE ONE WHO  
[000:30:04;21] SHOT AND KILLED ALL THREE  
[000:30:06;26] OF THE VICTIMS.  
[000:30:07;22] SHE DID, HOWEVER CONFESS  
[000:30:09;19] HER INVOLVEMENT IN THE  
[000:30:10;25] SCHEME BUT WE HAVE NO

[000:31:13;23] LIVE AS INVESTIGATORS TELL

[000:32:38;00] AT TWO PERSONS OF INTEREST  
[000:32:39;02] THAT THEY HAVE PICTURES OF.

[000:32:42;21] NOT DISTRIBUTING AMONG THE  
[000:32:43;29] PUBLIC JUST YET THAT ONE OF  
[000:32:46;00] THEM HAS CARRYING A  
[000:32:47;03] BACKPACK.  
[000:32:47;23] THE OTHER SOME TYPE OF BAG.

[000:32:52;19] ASKING ABOUT THIS HERE.  
[000:32:54;00] ALSO VERY FRUSTRATING.  
[000:32:57;09] THAT FRUSTRATION SHOWING UP

[000:33:00;09] THERE WASSER REASON REPORTS  
[000:33:02;17] OF AN ARREST.

[000:33:09;23] TYPE OF THREAT AND THEY HAD  
[000:33:11;03] TO EVACUATE THE COURTHOUSE.  
[000:33:12;14] THAT IS UNDERSCORING THE  
[000:33:14;10] UNDERLYING TENSION THAT  
[000:33:15;02] STILL REMAINS HERE IN  
[000:33:16;08] BOSTON, NOW TWO DAYS AFTER  
[000:33:18;13] THAT BOMBING THERE AT THE  
[000:33:19;10] FINISH LINE, BILL.  
[000:33:22;16] >> Bill: CRAIG, THANK YOU.  
[000:33:23;20] CRAIG BOSWELL ON THE  
[000:33:24;16] STREETS OF BOSTON TONIGHT.  
[000:33:25;22] IT'S REMARKABLE THING TO  
[000:33:26;14] FOLLOW ALL THE EVENTS  
[000:33:27;15] THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  
[000:33:29;00] SOMETIMES THESE EVENTS  
[000:33:29;21] TURNED ON THE MINUTE  
[000:33:30;29] LITERALLY YET AGAIN THEY  
[000:33:32;26] HAVE RECORDING FROM THE  
[000:33:34;13] BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT.  
[000:33:35;09] 19 MINUTES AGO A TWEET WENT

[000:33:43;23] BRIEFING TONIGHT.  
[000:33:44;12] SO FOR THE MOMENT THAT WILL  
[000:33:45;18] NOT HAPPEN.  
[000:33:46;08] NOW, THE FEDS ARE NOT THE  
[000:33:47;10] ONLY ONES POURING OVER

[000:34:05;18] WE WILL NOT SHOW YOU THOSE  
[000:34:06;21] PICTURES HERE SINCE THERE  
[000:34:07;22] IS NOTHING YET TO SUGGEST

[000:34:10;24] RICK LEVENTHAL REPORTED ONE  
[000:34:12;10] HOUR AGO THAT THERE ARE  
[000:34:13;29] PHYSICAL COPIES OF PICTURES

[000:34:28;17] WE GET IT THROUGH OUR  
[000:34:29;26] SOURCES HERE IN BOSTON  
[000:34:30;22] TONIGHT.  
[000:34:31;06] NOW, ANY DOCTOR WILL TELL  
[000:34:32;11] YOU IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL  
[000:34:33;19] TO FEEL ON EDGE, ESPECIALLY  
[000:34:36;03] AFTER NEWS OF AN ATTACK.  
[000:34:37;09] BUT THE BOMBINGS IN BOSTON,  
[000:34:38;23] THEY ARE NO EXCEPTION WITH  
[000:34:40;17] THE SCENES OF BLOOD AND  
[000:34:41;26] SUFFERING, IT IS IMPORTANT  
[000:34:43;00] TO UNDERSTAND THAT COMPARED  
[000:34:44;02] TO DECADES PAST, THIS TYPE  
[000:34:46;03] OF HORRIFIC EVENT IS NOW  
[000:34:49;21] SUBSTANTIALLY LESS COMMON.

[000:34:52;16] CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT  
[000:34:53;10] LIVE TONIGHT WITH MORE ON  
[000:34:54;21] THAT.  
[000:34:55;04] IT DOES NOT LESSEN THE PAIN  
[000:34:56;21] THOUGH CERTAINLY FOR ANY OF  
[000:34:57;22] THE VICTIMS.  
[000:34:58;23] ACCORDING TO THE NUMBERS  
[000:35:00;00] THEY SUGGEST WE HE HAVE  
[000:35:00;22] BEEN SAFER SINCE 9/11.  
[000:35:03;19] JONATHAN?  
[000:35:04;04] >> THE BOMBINGS IN BOSTON,  
[000:35:05;17] BILL, ARE PARTLY SHOCKING  
[000:35:08;04] PURELY BECAUSE WE ARE THAT  
[000:35:10;01] MUCH SAFER THAN WE WERE  
[000:35:12;16] PRIOR TO 9/11.  
[000:35:13;21] PRIOR TO 9/11, THE BOMBINGS  
[000:35:15;16] WERE MUCH MORE COMMON ON  
[000:35:17;26] AMERICAN SOIL.  
[000:35:18;16] YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK BACK  
[000:35:20;24] TO 1993, OF COURSE, AND THE  
[000:35:22;00] FIRST BOMBING OF THE WORLD  
[000:35:23;21] TRADE CENTER.  
[000:35:24;14] AND THEN IN 1995, OF  
[000:35:26;06] COURSE, THERE WAS THE  
[000:35:27;01] OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING AND  
[000:35:29;04] MANY MORE SMALL SCALE BUT  
[000:35:30;21] DEADLY BOMBINGS IN THE  
[000:35:33;22] 1970S.  
[000:35:34;05] NOW, A LOT OF EXPERTS SAY  
[000:35:35;20] THAT SINCE THE 9/11 ATTACKS  
[000:35:38;05] OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES  
[000:35:40;00] AND LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE  
[000:35:43;00] BECOME MUCH BETTER AT  
[000:35:44;25] IDENTIFYING AND PREVENTING  
[000:35:46;13] ANY POTENTIAL ATTACKS.  
[000:35:47;17] SO WHILE WE MIGHT NOT FEEL  
[000:35:49;06] IT RIGHT NOW STAIVE TIS  
[000:35:51;15] PARTICULARLY SPEAKING, WE  
[000:35:52;16] ARE MUCH SAFER NOW THAN WE  
[000:35:54;03] WERE IN THE DECADES BEFORE  
[000:35:55;29] 9/11.  
[000:35:57;26] BILL?  
[000:35:58;09] >> YOU KNOW, JONATHAN, WE  
[000:35:59;23] KNOW AT LEAST ONE OF THESE  
[000:36:01;01] DEVICES WAS MADE USING A  
[000:36:02;14] PRESSURE COOKER, PERHAPS  
[000:36:03;14] BOTH OF THEM IN THE END.  
[000:36:04;17] THAT IS NOT A NEW TACTIC,  
[000:36:06;03] IS IT?  
[000:36:06;16] >> NO.  
[000:36:07;06] IT'S CERTAINLY NOT.  
[000:36:08;07] IN FACT, RIGHT HERE, LOOK  
[000:36:09;06] AT THESE DATES.  
[000:36:11;12] IN 1976, THERE WAS A BOMB  
[000:36:13;08] USING A PRESSURE COOKER SET  
[000:36:16;11] BY CROATIAN SEPARATISTS  
[000:36:18;12] RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK  
[000:36:19;19] CITY.  
[000:36:20;02] IN THE 1970S AND 1980S, IT  
[000:36:21;29] WAS A COMMON TACTIC USED BY  
[000:36:24;09] THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY  
[000:36:26;04] IN THE UK AND ALSO IT WAS  
[000:36:28;03] USED IN THE 1980S BY  
[000:36:31;23] COLOMBIAN REBELS.  
[000:36:32;19] EXPERTS SAY THERE IS A VERY  
[000:36:33;23] GOOD REASON WHY PRESSURE  
[000:36:35;06] COOKER STYLE BOMBS HAVE  
[000:36:36;23] LONG BEEN IN THE  
[000:36:38;25] TERRORIST'S ARSENAL  
[000:36:39;23] LISTEN.  
[000:36:40;14] >> THIS IS A DEVICE THAT'S  
[000:36:42;24] MADE HOMEGROWN, THAT YOU GO  
[000:36:43;27] OUT AND YOU TAKE ELEMENTS  
[000:36:46;09] OF A STORE THAT YOU CAN'T  
[000:36:48;16] REALLY TRACE AND YOU PUT  
[000:36:50;04] THEM TOGETHER SO THAT YOU  
[000:36:51;19] GO BELOW THE SCREEN.  
[000:36:55;07] THAT'S WHY NOBODY KNOWS YOU  
[000:36:59;23] ARE.  
[000:37:00;05] SO HE SEY TO STAY BELOW THE

[000:41:53;08] MISSISSIPPI REPUBLICAN  
[000:41:54;07] SENATOR ROGER WICKER WERE  
[000:41:55;20] POSITIVE FOR RICIN.  
[000:41:56;19] NOW WORD THEY HAVE ARRESTED  
[000:41:57;22] A MAN IN TUPELO,  
[000:41:59;13] MISSISSIPPI IN THAT CASE.  
[000:42:01;06] MIKE EMANUEL HAS BEEN ON  
[000:42:01;28] THE STORY THROUGHOUT THE  
[000:42:03;04] DAY.  
[000:42:03;16] IS HE LIVE ON THE HILL LATE  
[000:42:04;11] FOR US TONIGHT.  
[000:42:05;02] WHAT CAN WE REPORTED, MIKE?  
[000:42:06;18] WHAT ARE YOU GETTING?  
[000:42:07;13] >> BILL, WE HAVE SEVERAL  
[000:42:08;23] LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES WHO  
[000:42:09;17] TELL US THAT A MAN BY THE  
[000:42:11;03] NAME OF KENNETH CURTIS OF  
[000:42:13;19] TUPELO, MISSISSIPPI HAS  
[000:42:14;11] BEEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION  
[000:42:15;05] WITH THESE LETTERS THAT  
[000:42:16;06] HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR  
[000:42:18;01] RICIN THAT HAVE BEEN SENT  
[000:42:19;13] TO -- ADDRESSED TO  
[000:42:20;02] PRESIDENT OBAMA AND SENATOR  
[000:42:22;17] ROGER WICKER OF  
[000:42:23;18] MISSISSIPPI.  
[000:42:24;04] SOURCES EARLY ON IN THE  
[000:42:24;28] INVESTIGATION WERE TELLING  
[000:42:25;21] US THAT IT WAS SOMEBODY  
[000:42:27;01] FROM MISSISSIPPI FROM  
[000:42:28;05] SENATOR WICKER'S HOME STATE  
[000:42:30;08] AND THE FBI BULLETIN THAT  
[000:42:31;28] WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING FROM  
[000:42:33;05] THAT WE OBTAINED EARLY  
[000:42:34;14] TODAY SAYS THE TWO LETTERS  
[000:42:35;21] THAT WERE SENT WERE SIGNED  
[000:42:39;02] I AM K.C. AND I APPROVE  
[000:42:41;21] THIS MESSAGE.  
[000:42:43;09] K.C. MAY TRANSLATE TO  
[000:42:45;18] KENNETH CURTIS IT IS  
[000:42:47;08] UNCLEAR WHEN CHARGES WILL  
[000:42:48;01] BE FILED.  
[000:42:49;00] WHETHER IT WILL BE LATER  
[000:42:50;00] TONIGHT OR TOMORROW.  
[000:42:51;03] BUT, AGAIN TO RECAP  
[000:42:53;06] SEVERAL FEDERAL LAW  
[000:42:53;26] ENFORCEMENT SOURCES SAY  
[000:42:55;09] ARREST HAS BEEN MADE.  
[000:42:56;28] KENNETH CURTIS FROM TUPELO,  
[000:42:59;07] MISSISSIPPI.  
[000:42:59;23] WE ARE GATHERING FACTS AS  
[000:43:00;16] QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  
[000:43:02;10] BILL?  
[000:43:02;28] >> Bill: MIKE, THROUGHOUT  
[000:43:03;21] THE DAY, YOU HAVE BEEN  
[000:43:04;12] REPORTING THAT WHOMEVER WAS  
[000:43:07;04] THE PERSON WHO MAILED THESE  
[000:43:08;13] LETTERS APPARENTLY -- HE  
[000:43:09;21] WAS PRETTY WELL KNOWN AMONG  
[000:43:11;28] LEGISLATORS THERE ON THE  
[000:43:12;20] HOUSE AND THE SENATE SIDE.  
[000:43:15;06] S SO DOSS THIS COINCIDE  
[000:43:16;16] WITH THAT INFORMATION THAT  
[000:43:17;10] YOU HAVE TONIGHT?  
[000:43:18;08] >> IT DOES.  
[000:43:18;25] THEY SAID THAT THIS GUY WAS  
[000:43:20;20] A FREQUENT LETTER WRITER TO  
[000:43:22;16] LAWMAKERS HERE ON CAPITOL  
[000:43:23;28] HILL.  
[000:43:24;11] FEDERAL OFFICIALS THROUGH  
[000:43:25;23] THE WASHINGTON.  
[000:43:26;15] AND, AGAIN, FROM THE FBI  
[000:43:28;09] BULLETIN THAT WE OBTAINED  
[000:43:29;11] EARLY TODAY, THEY SAID THAT  
[000:43:30;25] HE SIGNED IT I AM K.C. AND  
[000:43:34;21] I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.  
[000:43:36;00] AND SO HE SEEMED PRETTY  
[000:43:37;24] CAVALIER ABOUT THAT HE DID  
[000:43:38;24] NOT PUT A -- OR THE SUSPECT  
[000:43:40;09] DID NOT PUT A RETURN  
[000:43:42;06] ADDRESS ON THESE LETTERS.  
[000:43:43;29] BUT THEY SEEMED FAIRLY  
[000:43:45;18] CONFIDENT EARLY ON THAT  
[000:43:46;12] THEY KNEW IT WAS SOMEBODY  
[000:43:47;26] FROM MISSISSIPPI SOMEBODY  
[000:43:48;23] WHO FREQUENTLY WROTE  
[000:43:49;28] LETTERS TO LAWMAKERS AND  
[000:43:51;16] OTHER FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND  
[000:43:52;29] TO RECAP AN ARREST MADE  
[000:43:54;17] WITHIN THE LAST HOUR OR SO,  
[000:43:57;14] BILL.  
[000:43:58;15] >> Bill: NOW, TO BE CLEAR,  
[000:43:59;08] SINCE THE ANTHRAX ATTACKS  
[000:44:00;01] IN THE FALL OF 2001, YOU  
[000:44:02;18] KNOW, CONGRESS CHANGED THE  
[000:44:03;29] TWAY RECEIVES MAIL.  
[000:44:05;04] WE KNOW AT THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:44:06;10] THE MAIL RECEIVING CENTER  
[000:44:07;09] IS NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  
[000:44:08;07] IT'S IN SOME OTHER PART OF  
[000:44:10;07] WASHINGTON D.C.  
[000:44:10;28] BUT HOW DID THE SENATE AND  
[000:44:12;26] THE HOUSE CHANGE THEIR  
[000:44:14;29] TACTICS BECAUSE MITCH  
[000:44:16;02] MCCONNELL SAID EARLIER  
[000:44:17;00] TODAY THAT THE SYSTEM THAT  
[000:44:18;01] WAS PUT IN PLACE BACK THEN  
[000:44:19;25] WORKED TODAY.  
[000:44:20;25] GO AHEAD AND EXPLAIN THAT.  
[000:44:21;28] >> ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BILL.  
[000:44:23;11] THEY MOVED IT OFF SITE AND  
[000:44:25;10] IT WENT TO FATAL IN  
[000:44:27;05] LANDOVER, MARYLAND WHERE  
[000:44:27;28] ALL OF THE MAIL THAT COMES  
[000:44:30;08] TO THE UNITED STATES  
[000:44:31;22] SENATOR'S OFFICE IS  
[000:44:32;19] SCREENED TESTED, OPENED,  
[000:44:35;19] AND ESSENTIALLY CHECKED TO  
[000:44:36;24] MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR  
[000:44:37;29] BEFORE THEY PASS IT ON TO  
[000:44:39;27] THE CAPITAL COMPLEX.  
[000:44:40;24] SO IT DID NOT GET ANYWHERE  
[000:44:42;12] CLOSE TO THE CAPITAL  
[000:44:44;02] COMPLEX AND JAY CARNEY TOLD  
[000:44:45;18] US TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:44:46;16] THAT IT DID NOT GET  
[000:44:48;04] ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE WHITE  
[000:44:49;15] HOUSE OR TO PRESIDENT  
[000:44:50;17] OBAMA.  
[000:44:51;10] SO, SENATOR MCCONNELL WAS  
[000:44:52;06] QUITE HAPPY THIS MORNING.  
[000:44:53;22] SAID JUSTICE WOULD PREVAIL.  
[000:44:55;03] BUT SAID THE BOTTOM LINE  
[000:44:56;16] WAS THEY LEARNED A LOT FROM  
[000:44:58;26] THOSE 2001 ANTHRAX LETTER  
[000:45:00;07] ATTACKS AND THEY MADE SURE  
[000:45:01;18] THAT THESE LETTERS IN THIS  
[000:45:02;21] CASE DID NOT GET ANYWHERE  
[000:45:04;27] CLOSE TO THE LAWMAKER AND  
[000:45:06;00] TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE  
[000:45:07;22] UNITED STATES.  
[000:45:08;09] AND SO BOTTOM LINE THE  
[000:45:09;11] SYSTEM WORKED IN THIS CASE,  
[000:45:10;22] BILL.  
[000:45:12;08] >> Bill: YEAH, ONE MORE  
[000:45:13;00] THING HERE MIKE.  
[000:45:14;02] IS THE CASE CONSIDERED  
[000:45:15;15] CLOSED OR IS THERE A  
[000:45:16;10] POSSIBILITY OF MORE LETTERS  
[000:45:17;14] BEING RECEIVED OUT THERE?  
[000:45:19;10] >> THEY ARE ON THE LOOKOUT  
[000:45:20;17] FOR OTHER SUSPICIOUS  
[000:45:21;21] LETTERS.  
[000:45:22;05] WE HAD A BUNCH OF OFFICES  
[000:45:25;02] EVACUATED OR CLEARED AND  
[000:45:27;21] HAS MAT UNIFORMS COME INTO  
[000:45:29;28] THE CAPITOL OR OFFICES  
[000:45:30;26] AROUND THE CAPITOL COMPLEX  
[000:45:32;11] AND ALSO SOME TO SOME  
[000:45:33;21] DISTRICT OFFICES JUST TO BE  
[000:45:35;18] ABUNDANTLY CAUTIOUS TO MAKE  
[000:45:36;13] SURE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING  
[000:45:38;13] SUSPICIOUS, THAT IT WAS  
[000:45:40;11] CAREFULLY CHECKED OUT  
[000:45:41;25] BECAUSE OF COURSE ONE THING  
[000:45:42;19] WE KNOW THAT RICIN IN VERY  
[000:45:45;05] SMALL AMOUNTS CAN BE  
[000:45:46;29] QUIETLY THAT, QUITE DEADLY.  
[000:45:48;17] EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN  
[000:45:49;17] HERE ON CAPITOL HILL.  
[000:45:51;10] AND IN MANY SENATORS'  
[000:45:52;27] OFFICES AROUND THE COUNTRY  
[000:45:53;23] TO MAKE SURE ANYTHING FUNNY  
[000:45:55;14] IN THE MAIL WAS  
[000:45:56;28] DOUBLE-CHECKED BILL.  
[000:45:58;04] >> Bill: THANK YOU, MIKE.  
[000:45:58;27] GOOD WORK.  
[000:46:00;08] MIKE EMANUEL WITH THE  
[000:46:00;29] BREAKING NEWS FROM CAPITOL  
[000:46:01;22] HILL TONIGHT.  
[000:46:02;09] WE'RE AWAITING MORE  
[000:46:03;12] DEVELOPMENTS OUT OF TUPELO,  
[000:46:04;17] MISSISSIPPI WITH THE LATEST  
[000:46:05;15] ON THIS.  
[000:46:05;29] THERE WAS A LOT OF NEWS TO  
[000:46:07;05] FOLLOW AS YOU CAN CLEARLY  
[000:46:09;06] SEE FROM THE PAST 47  
[000:46:10;19] MINUTES.  
[000:46:11;03] AND THERE ARE DEVELOPMENTS  
[000:46:11;26] HERE IN BOSTON THAT WE WILL  
[000:46:12;29] BRING YOU IN A MATTER OF  
[000:46:14;00] MOMENTS AS OUR COVERAGE  
[000:46:17;24] CITIZEN -- CONTINUES HERE

[000:48:06;21] >> Bill: BACK TO THE  
[000:48:08;12] BREAKING NEWS NOW, THERE  
[000:48:09;04] HAS BEEN AN ARREST IN THE  
[000:48:09;27] RICIN SCARE THAT HAS  
[000:48:10;17] GRIPPED WASHINGTON, D.C.  
[000:48:11;09] FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.  
[000:48:12;00] A MAN IN TUPELO,  
[000:48:13;04] MISSISSIPPI, WELL KNOWN TO  
[000:48:14;06] AUTHORITIES APPARENTLY ON  
[000:48:15;12] CAPITOL HILL HAS BEEN  
[000:48:16;04] ARRESTED NOW.  
[000:48:16;24] WITH ME NOW IS DAVID CATS.  
[000:48:21;15] FOUNDER, PRESIDENT AND CEO  
[000:48:23;20] OF GROUP.  
[000:48:26;02] FORMER D.E.A. AND  
[000:48:27;17] INSTRUCTOR AT THE ACADEMY.  
[000:48:28;20] YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC  
[000:48:30;10] STRATEGY WHEN DEALING WITH  
[000:48:31;06] THESE MATTERS.  
[000:48:31;28] WHAT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME,  
[000:48:33;01] DAVID IS WHETHER OR NOT  
[000:48:33;26] THEY FOUND THE RICIN AND  
[000:48:36;02] WHETHER THEY TRACED IT BACK  
[000:48:37;06] TO MISSISSIPPI OR IF THEY  
[000:48:38;07] LOOKED AT HIS RETURN  
[000:48:39;11] ADDRESS ON AN ENVELOPE IN  
[000:48:40;27] WASHINGTON, D.C.  
[000:48:41;15] IF HE WERE THAT WELL KNOWN  
[000:48:42;10] TO AUTHORITIES.  
[000:48:43;06] >> YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,  
[000:48:45;04] THE ORIGINAL REPORT  
[000:48:46;17] INDICATED THERE WAS NO  
[000:48:48;10] RETURN ADDRESS.  
[000:48:49;00] THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SO.  
[000:48:51;00] BUT IF HE IS FAMILIAR TO  
[000:48:53;19] THEM, A CERTAIN STYLE OF  
[000:48:55;06] WRITING OR THE ENVELOPES HE  
[000:48:58;06] SEND ARE VERY DISTINCTIVE  
[000:49:00;17] THAT MAY BE HOW THEY TRACE  
[000:49:02;02] HIM.  
[000:49:02;14] I ASSUME THE NEXT STEP IS  
[000:49:03;24] TO GO INTO HIS RESIDENCE OR  
[000:49:05;14] ANY AREA HE HAD CONTROL  
[000:49:06;18] OVER AND SEE WAS THERE ANY  
[000:49:08;04] OTHER RESIDUAL COMPONENTS.  
[000:49:12;02] THAT'S PROBABLY THE NEXT  
[000:49:12;24] STEP TO MAKE THE CASE  
[000:49:13;22] AGAINST HIM SOLID.  
[000:49:17;15] >> Bill: DAVID, THERE IS NO  
[000:49:18;09] INDICATION THAT ANYONE WAS  
[000:49:19;10] AFFECTED BY THIS RICIN.  
[000:49:21;00] HAD HE BEEN SUCCESSFUL,  
[000:49:23;16] WHAT HAPPENS TO A HUMAN  
[000:49:24;25] BEING WHEN THEY COME IN  
[000:49:25;29] CONTACT WITH IT?  
[000:49:27;03] >> RICIN IS AN INCREDIBLY  
[000:49:29;26] DEADLY TOXIN.  
[000:49:34;14] CLASSIFIED AS A WEAPON OF.  
[000:49:37;10] CASTER BEAN MORE DEADLY  
[000:49:39;05] THAN CYANIDE.  
[000:49:40;04] THERE IS NO RELIABLE  
[000:49:42;09] ANTIDOTE.  
[000:49:42;24] THEY ARE TRYING TO  
[000:49:43;26] MANUFACTURE ANTIDOTES NOW  
[000:49:45;12] BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF  
[000:49:46;10] THEM HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY  
[000:49:48;23] MANUFACTURED.  
[000:49:49;10] IF SO INGESTED IT.  
[000:49:50;06] IF SOMEONE HAD A BROKEN  
[000:49:51;09] SKIN OR A CUT ON THEM ON  
[000:49:52;26] THEIR HAND, FOR EXAMPLE AND  
[000:49:54;19] HANDLED THE LETTER, COULD  
[000:49:55;19] VERY WELL BE TALKING ABOUT  
[000:49:56;25] IN TWO TO THREE DAYS  
[000:49:58;20] FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF  
[000:49:59;21] THIS.  
[000:50:02;14] >> Bill: LET'S BE CLEAR  
[000:50:03;06] THOUGH, IF SOMEBODY PUTS  
[000:50:04;05] RICEN IN AN ENVELOPE AND  
[000:50:05;27] PUTS IT IN THE MAIL, THEY  
[000:50:06;26] ARE OUT TO DO HARM, AREN'T  
[000:50:08;25] THEY?  
[000:50:09;08] >> YEAH, IT'S LIKE OPENING  
[000:50:10;08] A CANISTER FROM CYANIDE  
[000:50:12;22] BREATHE DEEPLY.  
[000:50:13;21] IT'S ABSOLUTELY 100%  
[000:50:15;18] INTENTIONAL ACT AND  
[000:50:16;23] INTENTIONAL ATTEMPT TO KILL  
[000:50:20;18] SOMEBODY IT'S UNLIKELY  
[000:50:21;22] THAT SOMEONE WOULD SURVIVE  
[000:50:24;04] SIGNIFICANT EXPLOSION TO  
[000:50:25;18] RICIN.  
[000:50:26;01] HOW WOULD THEY FIND THIS  
[000:50:28;13] SHORT OF OPENING A PACKAGE  
[000:50:30;08] OR AN ENVELOPE?  
[000:50:31;20] >> THE POSTAL SERVICE HAS  
[000:50:35;05] VERY VERY SOPHISTICATED  
[000:50:37;20] TECHNOLOGIES IN DETECTING A  
[000:50:39;00] ARE A VARIETY OF BIOLOGICAL  
[000:50:40;13] WEAPONS.  
[000:50:40;27] IN ADDITION, I'M ASSUMING  
[000:50:42;04] THEY WOULD DO EVEN X-RAY  
[000:50:46;00] SCAN POWDER IN ENVELOPE AND  
[000:50:47;10] THAT WOULD BE NECESSITATE A  
[000:50:50;08] NEXT LEVEL INSPECTION WHICH  
[000:50:51;07] WOULD PUT IT ON A FIELD  
[000:50:52;13] TEST AND THAT'S PROBABLY  
[000:50:53;10] HOW THEY GOT THE POSITIVE  
[000:50:54;23] RESULT FOR RICIN.  
[000:50:56;20] >> YEAH.  
[000:50:57;05] WE WERE SPEAKING WITH MIKE  
[000:50:58;16] EMANUEL A MOMENT AGO.  
[000:50:59;27] GO BACK TO MIKE IN A MOMENT  
[000:51:02;03] HERE.  
[000:51:02;16] IF THIS MAN HAS BEEN  
[000:51:03;16] ARRESTED, THEN HIS CASE IS  
[000:51:04;29] CLOSED.  
[000:51:05;13] BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER  
[000:51:06;19] OR NOT THERE ARE OTHER  
[000:51:08;01] ENVELOPES OR PACKAGES OUT  
[000:51:08;25] THERE THAT STILL MIGHT  
[000:51:10;03] CONTAIN RICIN THAT HAD BEEN  
[000:51:11;15] MAILED PRIOR TO HIS ARREST.  
[000:51:14;24] >> THAT'S AN EXCELLENT.  
[000:51:16;05] >> Bill: WHAT DO THEY DO  
[000:51:17;00] NOW, DAVID?  
[000:51:17;25] >> EVERYONE NEEDS TO  
[000:51:19;13] UNDERSTAND.  
[000:51:19;29] I THINK IT'S CLEAR IS HE  
[000:51:21;05] TARGETING GOVERNMENT  
[000:51:22;07] OFFICIALS.  
[000:51:22;22] I'M SURE ALL THE MAIL  
[000:51:24;07] HANDLING FACILITIES,  
[000:51:24;27] WHETHER IT BE FEDERAL  
[000:51:25;26] OFFICIALS, STATE AND LOCAL  
[000:51:26;24] GOVERNMENT, THEY WILL BE ON  
[000:51:28;04] HEIGHTENED ALERT.  
[000:51:29;02] THAT'S AN EXCELLENT POINT  
[000:51:30;11] YOU RAISE.  
[000:51:31;12] TWO LETTERS HAVE  
[000:51:33;06] INTERCEPTED.  
[000:51:33;22] WHO KNOWS HOW MANY HE PUT  
[000:51:34;15] IN THE MAIL?  
[000:51:35;24] IT'S NOT DIFFICULT.  
[000:51:36;25] IT'S KIND OF LIKE IT'S A  
[000:51:39;27] NON-SOPHISTICATED  
[000:51:40;20] TECHNOLOGY.  
[000:51:41;06] SOMEONE WHO IS INTENT ON  
[000:51:42;23] CAUSING, YOU KNOW,  
[000:51:45;01] WIDESPREAD PANIC AND FEAR,  
[000:51:46;19] AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE  
[000:51:48;27] SOPHISTICATION TO  
[000:51:50;01] MANUFACTURE ANTHRAX OR --  
[000:51:55;00] RICIN MAKE SUFFICIENT  
[000:51:55;24] QUANTITY AND ALL THEY NEED  
[000:51:56;26] TO DO IS PUT IN ENVELOPES  
[000:51:59;06] PUT ON THE STAMPS AND DROP  
[000:52:00;07] THEM IN MAILBOXES AND YOU  
[000:52:01;23] HAVE MASS TERROR ALL OVER  
[000:52:02;28] THE COUNTRY.  
[000:52:04;28] >> Bill: DAVID, STAND BY  
[000:52:05;24] ONE FROM ONE MOMMY.  
[000:52:07;22] MIKE EMANUEL FROM CAPITOL  
[000:52:08;15] HILL HAS BEEN REPORTING ON  
[000:52:09;17] THIS STORY THROUGHOUT THE  
[000:52:10;20] DAY.  
[000:52:11;02] WHAT ARE THE PRECAUTIONS IN  
[000:52:12;00] PLACE NOW.  
[000:52:12;15] WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU  
[000:52:13;18] WHETHER IT'S TONIGHT OR  
[000:52:14;14] TOMORROW OR THE COMING DAYS  
[000:52:16;05] ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF  
[000:52:17;12] MORE LETTERS.  
[000:52:17;29] >> ESSENTIALLY BILL,  
[000:52:19;07] EVERYBODY SON THE LOOKOUT  
[000:52:20;00] FOR MORE LETTERS ANYTHING  
[000:52:21;11] THAT COMES IN NOT WITH A  
[000:52:22;23] RETURN ADDRESS.  
[000:52:23;18] THEY ARE TAKING A CLOSER  
[000:52:24;20] LOOK AT.  
[000:52:25;13] BOTTOM LINE IS THE LETTERS  
[000:52:26;27] THAT WERE SENT ADDRESSED TO  
[000:52:28;24] PRESIDENT OBAMA AND TO  
[000:52:30;02] SENATOR WICKER WERE BOTH  
[000:52:31;15] MAILED OUT ON APRIL THE 8TH  
[000:52:33;05] LAST WEEK FROM MEMPHIS  
[000:52:35;20] TENNESSEE.  
[000:52:36;05] AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING  
[000:52:37;09] THAT WAS IN COMMON BETWEEN  
[000:52:39;00] THE TWO LETTERS.  
[000:52:40;09] ALSO.  SO LANGUAGE THAT WAS  
[000:52:41;09] IN BOTH LETTERS, THE WAY IT  
[000:52:43;15] WAS SIGNED WAS IN BOTH  
[000:52:44;29] LETTERS.  
[000:52:45;13] AND SO THERE ARE  
[000:52:48;13] UNDOUBTEDLY SOME CLASSIFIED  
[000:52:49;13] ASPECTS AS PART OF THIS  
[000:52:50;18] INVESTIGATION THAT WILL  
[000:52:51;16] ALSO BE SIMILARITIES THAT  
[000:52:52;22] THEY ARE ON THE LOOKOUT  
[000:52:54;04] FOR.  
[000:52:54;16] BUT THE UNCLASSIFIED  
[000:52:55;07] VERSION THAT WE HAVE  
[000:52:56;08] OBTAINED ESSENTIALLY SAID  
[000:52:57;05] THAT SOME THE LANGUAGE WAS  
[000:52:58;12] THE SAME, POSTMARK WAS THE  
[000:53:00;21] SAME.  
[000:53:01;04] SOME OF THE RANTS INSIDE  
[000:53:02;00] WERE THE SAME.  
[000:53:02;25] AND SO THAT IS HOW THEY  
[000:53:04;04] WERE FAIRLY CONFIDENT IT  
[000:53:05;04] CAME FROM THIS PERSON.  
[000:53:08;06] IT WAS SIGNED THE SAME WAY  
[000:53:10;27] SAYING I AM K.C. AND I  
[000:53:12;17] APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.  
[000:53:13;26] TO SO THAT'S THE THINGS  
[000:53:15;01] THAT THAT HE ARE LOOKING  
[000:53:16;04] FOR AT THIS POINT, BILL.  
[000:53:17;21] >> Bill: THANK YOU MIKE.  
[000:53:19;11] MIKE EMANUEL LIVE ON THE  
[000:53:20;28] HILL.  
[000:53:21;11] DAVID CATS THANKS TO YOU AS

[000:53:27;10] WE ARE WATCHING ALL THE  
[000:53:28;18] DEVELOPMENTS TONIGHT IN A  
[000:53:29;25] STRANGE TWIST AGAIN ONLY  
[000:53:30;28] MOMENTS AGO THE BOSTON  
[000:53:32;03] POLICE DEPARTMENT SENT OUT  
[000:53:33;09] A MESSAGE THAT THE FBI  
[000:53:34;11] WOULD PUT A STATEMENT OUT  
[000:53:35;20] AT 8:00 AND THEN QUICKLY  
[000:53:37;08] RETRACTED THAT.  
[000:53:38;01] THERE WILL BE NO STATEMENT  
[000:53:38;25] TONIGHT BUT THE NEWS  
[000:53:40;14] CONTINUES IN ONEa MOMENT.

[000:53:50;07] back to the Ford Dealership?
[000:53:51;02] They specifically  work on Fords.
[000:53:52;29] It seems to me like  the best care.
[000:53:55;03] And it's equal or less Money  so it's
[000:53:55;26] a value for me.

[000:57:20;02] AGO, THERE WAS AN EXPECTED  
[000:57:21;14] STATEMENT FROM THE FBI.  
[000:57:22;22] THAT, TOO, WAS CANCELLED.

[000:57:37;00] ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY.

[000:57:38;21] MATTER AS WELL.
