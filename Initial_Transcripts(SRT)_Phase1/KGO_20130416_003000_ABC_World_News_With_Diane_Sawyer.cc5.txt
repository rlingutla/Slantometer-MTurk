[000:00:00;316] SMOKE, AND I RAN FAST AS I
[000:00:01;051] COULD.
[000:00:03;319] >> Reporter: CAMERAS WERE
[000:00:05;689] ROLLING FROM MANY ANGLES AS THE
[000:00:07;424] FORCE OF THE BLAST ACTUALLY
[000:00:08;692] KNOCKS OVER AT LEAST ONE OF THE
[000:00:11;494] MARATHONERS.
[000:00:11;995] LOOK AGAIN.
[000:00:13;196] MOST OF THE INJURIES, THOUGH,
[000:00:15;265] SUFFERED BY SPECTATORS WHO CAME
[000:00:16;666] TO CELEBRATE THE FINISH.
[000:00:18;702] >> A BOMB WENT OFF AND IT
[000:00:19;502] KNOCKED ME TO THE GROUND.
[000:00:20;537] AND THEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY
[000:00:21;604] STARTED RUNNING.
[000:00:23;173] PANICKING, AND ANOTHER BOMB WENT
[000:00:23;973] OFF.
[000:00:27;410] AND THEN I FELT THE GROUND
[000:00:28;478] AGAIN, PEOPLE RUNNING, YOU WERE
[000:00:29;279] GETTING TRAMPLED.
[000:00:30;080] >> IT WAS VERY LOUD.
[000:00:31;748] THE GROUND SHOOK, YOU COULD JUST
[000:00:32;816] FEEL IT GOING DOWN THROUGH YOU.
[000:00:34;918] JUST A SCARY SCENE.
[000:00:37;087] >> Reporter: RIGHT NEXT TO THE
[000:00:38;621] FINISH LINE, BLEACHERS FILLED
[000:00:40;223] WITH SPECTATORS, STUNNED AND
[000:00:41;291] CONFUSED BY THE FIRST BLAST,
[000:00:43;927] THEN WATCH IN HORROR AS 50 TO A
[000:00:45;562] HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, A SECOND
[000:00:46;296] EXPLOSION.
[000:00:50;834] EYEWITNESSES SAY THE INJURED
[000:00:52;402] WERE PILED ON THE SIDEWALK,
[000:00:54;003] SEVERED LIMBS LITTERING THE
[000:00:56;106] STREET, ONLOOKERS COMFORTING
[000:00:57;674] EACH OTHER AS THE VIOLENCE AND
[000:00:58;775] CHAOS ENGULFED THEM.
[000:01:01;411] >> I SAW QUITE A FEW CASUALTIES,
[000:01:03;546] ONE GUY WITH HIS LEGS GONE AT
[000:01:04;280] THE KNEES.
[000:01:06;216] ANKLES AND FEET MISSING,
[000:01:08;351] SHRAPNEL WOUNDS ON THE SIDE OF
[000:01:09;419] THE HEAD.
[000:01:10;487] >> Reporter: THE TWO BOMBS
[000:01:12;055] DESCRIBED BY AUTHORITIES AS
[000:01:14;190] SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, THERE
[000:01:15;825] WAS NO WARNING, NO ADVANCE
[000:01:17;927] THREAT, BUT PARAMEDICS, NATIONAL
[000:01:20;597] GUARD AND POLICE WERE ALREADY ON
[000:01:22;198] THE SCENE FOR THE MARATHON'S
[000:01:23;833] SECURITY AND MEDICAL NEEDS.
[000:01:26;402] THEY SPED INTO ACTION,
[000:01:31;674] PRONOUNCING TWO DEAD ALMOST
[000:01:32;809] IMMEDIATELY, TRAGICALLY, ONE OF
[000:01:35;445] THEM AN 8-YEAR-OLD CHILD.
[000:01:36;212] THEN CARRYING AT LEAST 99
[000:01:38;081] INJURED INTO THE RACE MEDICAL
[000:01:39;816] TENTS BEFORE THE HOSPITAL.
[000:01:41;751] POLICE AT THE INITIAL PRESS
[000:01:42;552] CONFERENCE WARNING DOWNTOWN
[000:01:44;053] BOSTON TO STAY CALM, BUT THE
[000:01:47;791] -- ADMITTING THE STREETS WERE
[000:01:51;194] NOT SAFE.
[000:01:51;961] >> WE'RE RECOMMENDING TO PEOPLE
[000:01:53;062] THAT THEY STAY HOME, THAT IF
[000:01:53;863] THEY'RE IN MOTELS IN THE AREA,
[000:01:54;898] THAT THEY RETURN TO THEIR ROOMS,
[000:01:55;965] AND THAT THEY DON'T GO ANY PLACE
[000:01:57;000] AND CONGREGATE IN LARGE CROWDS.
[000:01:58;067] WE WANT TO STABILIZE THE
[000:01:59;135] SITUATION.
[000:02:00;737] >> INITIAL REPORTS OF OTHER
[000:02:01;805] BOMBS IN THE AREA, NOW
[000:02:02;906] DISCOUNTED BY POLICE.
[000:02:04;541] AN INCIDENT AT THE LIBRARY NOW
[000:02:08;211] APPEARS TO BE UNRELATED, A
[000:02:10;313] MECHANICAL FIRE.
[000:02:12;448] >> THANKS SO MUCH.
[000:02:14;017] THINKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT,
[000:02:19;856] KEEP REMEMBER HEARING HOW THEY
[000:02:21;391] RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE DANGER,
[000:02:23;126] NOT THINKING.
[000:02:23;626] IN SECONDS THEY WERE THERE.
[000:02:24;661] WE WANT TO GO TO OUR COLLEAGUE
[000:02:28;398] SHAWN KELLEY WHO IS A REPORTER
[000:02:29;666] AT OUR GREAT BOSTON AFFILIATE.
[000:02:31;868] WE HEARD THAT HOSPITAL OFFICIALS
[000:02:32;735] SAID IT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE.
[000:02:33;736] WHAT'S THE LATEST YOU'RE HEARING
[000:02:35;338] ON THE VICTIMS?
[000:02:36;940] >> THE LATEST NUMBER WE'RE
[000:02:38;541] GETTING FROM EMERGENCY ROOMS IS
[000:02:40;143] 80 PEOPLE TAKEN TO AREA
[000:02:40;810] HOSPITALS.
[000:02:43;313] IT WAS A TRIAGE CENTER AT THE
[000:02:44;948] LOCATION OF THE MARATHON SITE
[000:02:46;516] THAT WAS SET UP QUICKLY, SO THEY
[000:02:47;584] WERE ABLE TO TEND TO THESE
[000:02:48;284] VICTIMS.
[000:02:49;752] WE SAW PEOPLE BEING WHEELED OUT
[000:02:51;354] ON WHEEL CHAIRS AND STRETCHERS
[000:02:52;922] WHO HAD LOST THEIR LIMBS.
[000:02:54;524] FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM
[000:02:56;092] DOCTORS, THE MAJORITY OF
[000:02:57;160] INJURIES ARE TO PEOPLE'S LOWER
[000:02:58;228] BODIES.
[000:03:03;299] >> BUT THERE ARE INJURIES OF
[000:03:05;368] MANY DIFFERENT KINDS, BURNS AS
[000:03:08;004] WELL.
[000:03:08;438] SHRAPNEL, ALL KINDS OF WOUNDS?
[000:03:09;172] >> Reporter: RIGHT.
[000:03:10;039] THE INJURIES WE WERE SEEING WAS
[000:03:10;807] MOSTLY TO PEOPLE'S LEGS.
[000:03:12;141] I SAW A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO
[000:03:13;209] HAVE LOST A GOOD PORTION OF HER
[000:03:14;277] JAW.
[000:03:15;345] LOTS OF LACERATIONS.
[000:03:18;514] THE SCENE COMING OUT OF IT WAS
[000:03:19;315] NOT HYSTERICAL.
[000:03:21;718] KEEP IN MIND, THIS WAS AT THE
[000:03:22;785] END OF THE MARATHON.
[000:03:24;387] SO THE RUNNERS THAT WERE INJURED
[000:03:25;989] WERE EXHAUSTED FROM THE RUN AND
[000:03:27;590] THE SPECTATORS WHO WERE INJURED
[000:03:29;192] WERE SIMPLY IN TOTAL SHOCK.
[000:03:30;827] >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
[000:03:32;395] WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU AGAIN
[000:03:33;963] THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND AGAIN
[000:03:36;099] OUR THANKS TO WCVB IN BOSTON.
[000:03:38;768] >>> AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW,
[000:03:40;870] THE BOMB WENT OFF, THE FIRST
[000:03:43;039] ONE, ABOUT 2:50 P.M. ON BOYLSTON
[000:03:46;409] STREET IN BOSTON, AND THAT WAS
[000:03:47;977] JUST FEET FROM THE FINISH LINE.
[000:03:50;947] RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO
[000:03:52;282] THE STREETS OF BOSTON AND SHOW
[000:03:54;884] YOU THE CHAOS, THE CONFUSION,
[000:03:56;619] LET YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO
[000:03:59;322] WERE THERE.
[000:03:59;822] >> IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE A
[000:04:00;523] BOMB -- WHAT I THOUGHT I BOMB
[000:04:01;224] WOULD SOUND LIKE.
[000:04:01;891] ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED.
[000:04:03;993] >> IT WAS VERY LOUD.
[000:04:06;129] THE GROUND SHOOK, YOU COULD JUST
[000:04:07;196] FEEL IT GOING DOWN THROUGH YOU.
[000:04:10;400] >> THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF RIGHT
[000:04:12;001] BY THE FINISH LINE.
[000:04:13;069] BOOM, YOU FELT IT, IT HURT YOUR
[000:04:15;171] EARS.
[000:04:17;340] >> SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP.
[000:04:18;942] >> RUN!
[000:04:21;044] >> I SAW A TRASH CAN EXPLODE AND
[000:04:22;645] PEOPLE STARTED THROWING DOWN THE
[000:04:24;247] BARRICADE AND RUNNING OVER EACH
[000:04:25;815] OTHER.
[000:04:27;450] I RAN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
[000:04:28;151] FAST AS I COULD.
[000:04:30;086] >> I WAS IN THE CITY.
[000:04:32;121] THIS IS LIKE THE SCARIEST THING
[000:04:33;756] I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.
[000:04:35;892] PEOPLE WORK IN THE RESTAURANTS
[000:04:36;960] TELLING US TO GET AWAY FROM THE
[000:04:38;528] SCENE, GET FAR AWAY.
[000:04:40;129] PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT LIKE IT
[000:04:41;731] WAS AN EXODUS AT CAMBRIDGE.
[000:04:43;833] >> I SAW RUNNERS IN FRONT OF ME
[000:04:46;536] FALL, SOME WITH INJURIES, AND
[000:04:49;706] THEN I LOOKED OVER AND SAW JUST
[000:04:52;342] A PILE OF BODIES, THE WORST
[000:04:53;443] THING I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN IN
[000:04:54;510] MY LIFE.
[000:04:56;079] MANGLED LIMBS, PEOPLE NOT
[000:04:57;714] BREATHING.
[000:04:59;849] I JUST INTERVIEWED A NURSE HERE
[000:05:00;950] ON THE SCENE WHO SAID SHE
[000:05:03;019] TREATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE,
[000:05:05;154] INCLUDING CHILDREN, MANY PEOPLE
[000:05:07;790] WITH SEVERE TRAUMA, PULMONARY
[000:05:09;926] DISTRESS, YOU NAME IT.
[000:05:10;960] >> THEY RESPONDED WITHIN 15
[000:05:12;028] SECONDS.
[000:05:13;629] YOU SAW EVERYBODY COMING DOWN
[000:05:14;697] HERE.
[000:05:15;698] THE MEDICAL TEAM HERE RESPONDED
[000:05:17;300] INSTANTLY.
[000:05:18;334] >> I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT IN
[000:05:19;936] BOSTON.
[000:05:21;571] YOU THINK PATRIOTS' DAY MARATHON
[000:05:24;207] MONDAY AND YOU DON'T THINK
[000:05:25;808] ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS EVER GOING
[000:05:27;944] TO HAPPEN ON A DAY LIKE THIS IN
[000:05:29;012] BOSTON.
[000:05:30;580] >> AND WHEN THOSE BOMBS WENT
[000:05:32;215] OFF, THERE WAS ONE PERSON
[000:05:33;783] STANDING THERE, AN EMERGENCY
[000:05:34;851] ROOM DOCTOR, WHO WAS JUST 20
[000:05:36;486] FEET AWAY FROM ONE OF THE
[000:05:38;054] EXPLOSIONS.
[000:05:39;655] THIS DOCTOR SPRANG INTO ACTION
[000:05:40;757] TO HELP THE VICTIMS.
[000:05:42;325] DR. ALAN PAINTER JOINS US RIGHT
[000:05:44;427] NOW ON THE PHONE FROM BOSTON.
[000:05:47;630] DR. PAINTER, TELL US ABOUT THE
[000:05:48;698] SCENE AND AS A MEDICAL
[000:05:50;800] PROFESSIONAL, WHAT DID YOU SEE?
[000:05:51;868] WHAT DID YOU DO?
[000:05:55;605] >> BASICALLY THE EXPLOSION
[000:05:56;672] OCCURRED TO MY LEFT.
[000:05:59;809] I REALIZED IT WAS AN EXPLOSION,
[000:06:01;911] TURNED TO MY RIGHT TO LEAVE THE
[000:06:02;979] AREA.
[000:06:05;648] ANOTHER EXPLOSION WENT OFF
[000:06:07;784] APPARENTLY DOWN THE BLOCK.
[000:06:09;352] TURNED ME BACK AROUND FACING THE
[000:06:10;420] BUILDINGS.
[000:06:11;487] THEN I REALIZED THERE WERE
[000:06:13;089] PEOPLE BLEEDING BEHIND ME.
[000:06:14;724] THEN I LOOKED TO MY LEFT WHERE I
[000:06:17;360] HAD BEEN AND THERE WERE AT LEAST
[000:06:18;428] SIX BODIES DOWN THERE.
[000:06:21;097] APPARENTLY THEY HAD TAKEN ALL
[000:06:24;267] THE BLAST AND I WAS UNSCATHED.
[000:06:26;402] >> AND WERE YOU ABLE TO HELP
[000:06:27;470] PEOPLE?
[000:06:30;173] DID YOU GATHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
[000:06:31;707] ARMS?
[000:06:35;978] >> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE
[000:06:37;046] PUT TOURNIQUETS ON PEOPLE QUICK
[000:06:37;814] AS WE CAN.
[000:06:38;648] BECAUSE MOST OF THE INJURIES
[000:06:40;216] WERE TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.
[000:06:42;885] WE ATTEMPTED RESUSCITATION OF A
[000:06:45;555] YOUNG LADY, GOT HER BACK TO THE
[000:06:47;056] MEDICAL TENT, BUT SHE DID NOT
[000:06:47;824] MAKE IT.
[000:06:51;327] I WANT TO COMMEND BOSTON POLICE
[000:06:53;996] AND THE MEDICS THERE, THEY WERE
[000:06:56;632] FRANTICALLY GETTING THINGS THAT
[000:06:58;801] EVERYBODY NEEDED TO THE AREA.
[000:06:59;836] AND THE BOSTON ATHLETIC
[000:07:01;437] ASSOCIATION HAD SO MANY PEOPLE
[000:07:02;505] THERE TO HELP, IT WAS FANTASTIC.
[000:07:06;242] >> WELL, AGAIN, DR. PAINTER, A
[000:07:07;810] HARROWING, HARROWING DAY.
[000:07:09;445] AND WE THANK YOU FOR CHECKING IN
[000:07:11;013] WITH US AS WELL.
[000:07:13;149] >> AND OF COURSE AROUND THIS
[000:07:15;251] COUNTRY AND THE WORLD, MAJOR
[000:07:16;319] CITIES ARE RAMPING UP SECURITY
[000:07:17;987] IN RESPONSE TO THE BOMBING AT
[000:07:18;988] THE BOSTON MARATHON.
[000:07:20;056] HERE IN NEW YORK, CRITICAL
[000:07:21;124] RESPONSE TEAMS WERE DEPLOYED
[000:07:23;259] AROUND THE CITY, AT HOTELS AND
[000:07:24;327] LANDMARKS.
[000:07:25;962] IN L.A., THEY'RE DISPATCHING
[000:07:27;497] BOMB SQUADS AND BOMB SNIFFING
[000:07:29;132] DOGS.
[000:07:32;935] AT AIRPORTS AND TONIGHT'S L.A.
[000:07:35;037] DODGERS GAME, AND ALSO IN
[000:07:38;040] LONDON.
[000:07:38;508] POLICE ARE REVIEWING SECURITY
[000:07:39;242] PLANS FOR THE LONDON MARATHON ON
[000:07:40;009] SUNDAY.
[000:07:41;110] SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT
[000:07:41;844] THE INVESTIGATION?
[000:07:43;813] THE LATEST ON WHO IS BEHIND
[000:07:45;948] THIS, AND THE NATURE OF THESE
[000:07:46;983] BOMBS, LET'S GO TO ABC'S SENIOR
[000:07:48;551] JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT WHO HAS
[000:07:50;186] BEEN WORKING THIS STORY ALL DAY,
[000:07:51;254] PIERRE THOMAS.
[000:07:53;890] >> WHAT WE'RE BEING TOLD BY
[000:07:56;559] SOURCES IS, THEY BELIEVE THAT
[000:07:58;661] TWO PORTABLE DEVICES WERE LEFT
[000:08:00;796] AND PLACED AT THE SCENE AND THEN
[000:08:01;564] DETONATED.
[000:08:03;466] LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS RIGHT
[000:08:06;135] NOW ARE AT THE SCENE, THEY'RE
[000:08:07;770] LOOKING FOR PIECES OF THE DEVICE
[000:08:09;872] IN ORDER TO BEGIN TO PUT THEM
[000:08:10;940] BACK TOGETHER TO GET A SENSE OF
[000:08:12;508] WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED.
[000:08:13;543] THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR
[000:08:14;277] SURVEILLANCE TAPE.
[000:08:15;645] ANY SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT WOULD
[000:08:17;280] GIVE THEM AN IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
[000:08:17;980] DONE THIS.
[000:08:19;382] ALSO WE'RE TOLD IN ADDITION TO
[000:08:21;517] LOOKING AT POTENTIAL DOMESTIC
[000:08:23;085] SUSPECTS, THEY'RE LOOKING AT
[000:08:24;720] PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE THE
[000:08:26;289] BOSTON AREA AIRPORT.
[000:08:28;424] EVERYTHING IS BEING LOOKED AT.
[000:08:31;093] THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF
[000:08:32;128] THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT
[000:08:32;895] NOW.
[000:08:34;263] >> PIERRE, I WANT TO GO TO THE
[000:08:35;331] VIDEO OF THE EXPLOSION.
[000:08:36;933] WE'RE GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN.
[000:08:39;068] LOOK AGAIN AT THIS VIDEO.
[000:08:41;204] TELL ME, FORENSICALLY, WHAT
[000:08:43;372] INVESTIGATORS THINK THEY CAN
[000:08:45;975] DETERMINE FROM WHAT WE'RE
[000:08:46;642] SEEING.
[000:08:48;644] >> I SPOKE WITH SOURCES WHO WERE
[000:08:51;280] WATCHING AND WITNESSES THAT
[000:08:52;348] PARTICULAR VIDEOTAPE.
[000:08:53;950] THEY SAY IT CONFIRMS WHAT THEY
[000:08:54;951] THINK.
[000:08:56;552] IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, IT SEEMS TO
[000:08:58;154] COME FROM A FAIRLY CONFINED
[000:08:59;222] SMALL AREA.
[000:09:01;857] AGAIN, THAT WAS ONE OF THE
[000:09:03;492] REASONS WHY THEY THOUGHT THIS
[000:09:05;061] WAS SOME SORT OF PACKAGE LEFT
[000:09:06;662] BEHIND IN THE MIDST OF THAT
[000:09:08;798] CROWD TO HARM EVERYONE IN THE
[000:09:09;832] IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY.
[000:09:11;467] >> AND AGAIN, PERSONS OF
[000:09:12;535] INTEREST TONIGHT, ANY LEADS AT
[000:09:13;269] ALL?
[000:09:15;171] >> AGAIN, ALL OF THE ABOVE, AS
[000:09:16;772] ONE SOURCE TOLD ME, THEY WILL
[000:09:18;374] LOOK AT DOMESTIC GROUPS,
[000:09:20;509] INTERNATIONAL GROUPS UNTIL THEY
[000:09:22;111] GET A SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT
[000:09:23;179] POINTS THEM IN ONE DIRECTION,
[000:09:24;213] EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.
[000:09:28;451] >> AGAIN, SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE
[000:09:31;354] ASKING THAT EVERYONE WHO HAD ANY
[000:09:32;888] VIDEO AT ALL, SEND IT TO THEM
[000:09:34;724] AND SEND THEM ANY LEADS.
[000:09:35;758] PIERRE THOMAS WILL KEEP WORKING
[000:09:36;626] THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, I KNOW.
[000:09:37;627] AND RIGHT AFTER THE EXPLOSION,
[000:09:38;694] PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN FRONT OF
[000:09:39;762] THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SHUT DOWN.
[000:09:40;830] SHORTLY BEFORE WE CAME ON THE
[000:09:42;431] AIR, THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE
[000:09:44;000] NATION.
[000:09:45;668] HERE'S ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

[000:11:13;823] THE PRESIDENT DID NOT USE THAT
