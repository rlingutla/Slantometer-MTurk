[000:04:08;781] BLOCK AFTER BLOCK OF POWER
[000:04:09;515] LINES.
[000:04:11;584] >> WE HAVE MORE STORMS COMING IN
[000:04:12;318] TONIGHT.
[000:04:13;653] THEY'RE GOING TO BE SEVERE SO WE
[000:04:15;588] WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS UP AND
[000:04:17;190] MAKE SURE IT IS IN PLACE BEFORE
[000:04:18;124] ANOTHER STORM COMES THROUGH.
[000:04:20;660] >> Reporter: 2013 HAD BEEN ONE
[000:04:22;495] OF THE QUIETEST TORNADO SEASONS
[000:04:23;830] ON RECORD DUE TO A COLD SPRING.
[000:04:26;366] BUT THAT ENDED WITH LAST WEEK'S

[000:04:44;884] ALOFT FROM THE SOUTHWEST.
[000:04:46;853] SO THE TURNING OF THOSE WINDS
[000:04:49;022] ALLOWS THE STORMS TO DEVELOP
[000:04:49;722] ROTATION.
[000:04:50;089] WE CALL THEM SUPER CELL
[000:04:51;324] THUNDERSTORMS AND THOSE ARE THE

[000:06:17;043] THEY COULD BE LARGE AND
[000:06:19;112] LONG-LIVED, THAT MEANS LASTING

[000:21:34;526] FEW MYSELF.
[000:21:41;833] SOMETIMES I WROTE OFF MY OWN

[000:21:48;774] MAKE EXCUSES FOR ME NOT DOING
[000:21:49;508] THE RIGHT THING.
[000:21:53;612] BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALL

[000:22:14;433] BE THE BEST FATHER YOU CAN BE TO
[000:22:15;167] YOUR CHILDREN.
[000:22:17;736] BECAUSE NOTHING'S MORE

[000:22:34;453] THE SPECIAL OBLIGATION I FELT AS
[000:22:36;388] A BLACK MAN, LIKE YOU, TO HELP
[000:22:39;291] THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST, PEOPLE
[000:22:40;025] WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE
[000:22:40;559] OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAD.
[000:22:43;995] BECAUSE THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE
[000:22:45;464] OF GOD GO I, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
[000:22:46;198] IN THEIR SHOES.
[000:22:46;798] I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN PRISON.
[000:22:49;101] I MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED.
[000:22:50;669] I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[000:22:51;370] SUPPORT A FAMILY.
[000:22:52;337] AND THAT MOTIVATES ME.

[000:26:34;025] AND THE OILED BLICKENSDERFER.
[000:26:39;164] AS GREAT AS THEY WERE, THESE
[000:26:41;733] MARVELS OF MECHANICS STOOD NO
[000:26:44;069] CHANCE AGAINST THE DIGITAL AGE,

[000:26:54;713] ARE A DIFFERENT GROUP, AND THEY
[000:26:57;549] LOVE THEIR TYPEWRITERS.
[000:26:58;617] IN THE LAST FEW YEARS I'VE HAD

[000:27:45;163] TWO, THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO BE
[000:27:45;864] OBSOLETE.
