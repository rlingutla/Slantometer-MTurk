WHITE BASEBALL CAP FIRST

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
BECAUSE HE APPEARED TO BE

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000

16

DEVICE IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000

>> I DON'T HAVE THE PRECISE TIME

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000

IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE THE BOMB

AS THEY ANALYZED MORE PICTURES

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
THEY REALIZED THE TWO SPENT TIME

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000

IT MAY BE DIFFICULT BUT THE

36

BOTH WERE LIKELY DETONATED BY

41

ELECTRONIC REMOTE CONTROLS.

42
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN

47
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THE FBI'S HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
WILL SEARCH THEIR MEMORIES TO

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
SEE IF THEY CAN SHED LIGHT ON

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
WHAT'S NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT

51
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
QUESTION.

52
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
WHO ARE THESE TWO MEN?

53
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
BRIAN?

54

61
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I HAVE LOOKED AT THE WEB

62
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
TONIGHT.
THERE IS ALREADY A SLEW OF

63
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THEORIES AS TO WHAT THE

64
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
ICONOGRAPHY IS ON BOTH HATS.

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
LEADING THEORY IS IT'S A

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
BRIDGESTONE GOLF LOGO ON THE

67
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
DARKER OF THE TWO.

68
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
WHAT CAN BE LEARNED?

ON THEIR OWN ANALYSIS.

75
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ONE THING THE FBI SAID TONIGHT
IS THAT THIS IS IN ESSENCE A

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
STARTER SET OF PHOTOS.

77
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THEY HOPE TO KEEP LOOKING

78
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THROUGH THE PICTURES AND AS THEY

79
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
COME UP WITH PICTURES THAT SHOW

THIS ISN'T IT.

83
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THEY HOPE TO HAVE MORE.

VIEW.

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
SECONDLY, IT'S THE SURVEILLANCE

98

99
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
STRATEGIC LOOK AT WHAT THESE MEN
