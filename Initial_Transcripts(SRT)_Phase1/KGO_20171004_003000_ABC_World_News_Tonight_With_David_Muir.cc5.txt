[000:08:44;891] AROUND YOU GET HIT FIRST?
[000:08:45;925] >> YEAH, I SAW A GIRL, LIKE TWO
[000:08:46;559] ROWS AHEAD OF ME, AND SHE GOT
[000:08:47;793] HIT IN THE NECK AND WENT DOWN.
[000:08:49;061] >> Reporter: SHELDON BEGAN

[000:08:50;263] HIM.
[000:08:51;130] THEN HE GOT SHOT, TWICE.
[000:08:52;732] IN THE ARM AND IN THE ABDOMEN.
[000:08:57;370] >> SOME HERO CAME AND SAVED ME,
[000:08:58;004] TOOK CARE OF ME, WHICH --
[000:08:58;538] >> Reporter: DO YOU KNOW HIS
[000:08:59;805] NAME?

[000:09:03;609] >> Reporter: AND HE CAME ALL THE
[000:09:04;243] WAY TO THE HOSPITAL WITH YOU.
[000:09:04;844] >> YEAH, HE WOULDN'T LEAVE MY

[000:09:08;381] STILL WANTS TO MEET THAT HERO,
[000:09:10;383] AND HIS MOM AND DAD WOULD LIKE
[000:09:11;817] TO MEET HIM, TOO.
[000:09:15;721] THEY KNOW THEIR SON STILL HAS SO
[000:09:19;225] MANY QUESTIONS, AMONG THEM, WHY?
[000:09:20;793] >> HE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHY
[000:09:21;427] WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS?
[000:09:21;928] SUCH EVIL?
[000:09:22;862] YOU KNOW, I -- I HAVE A LIFE
[000:09:23;462] AHEAD OF ME, WHY DOES SOMEONE
[000:09:24;063] WANT TO KILL ME AND LEAVE ME
[000:09:24;931] LYING ON THIS FIELD AND
[000:09:25;464] EVERYBODY ELSE?
[000:09:29;101] >> Reporter: THERE WAS MAKENNA
[000:09:29;902] PERRY, TOO, JUST 19 YEARS OLD.
[000:09:32;738] SHOT IN THE ARM AND IT WENT
[000:09:33;906] STRAIGHT THROUGH TO HER ABDOMEN.
[000:09:35;808] IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND AND GOOD
[000:09:38;311] SAMARITANS WHO HELPED SAVE HER,
[000:09:39;912] PUTTING HER IN THE BACK OF A
[000:09:42;114] TRUCK.

[000:09:44;283] TRUCK?

[000:10:01;934] IT'S KIND OF STARTING TO, BUT --
[000:10:05;838] NOT FULLY.
[000:10:08;641] >> Reporter: IT'S HARD TO EVEN
[000:10:11;811] THINK ABOUT.
[000:10:17;984] >> I JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S A
[000:10:18;584] LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD IT A LOT
[000:10:19;218] WORSE.
[000:10:24;023] SO, IT'S KIND OF JUST, LIKE,
[000:10:26;826] HARD TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT
[000:10:29;795] OF PEOPLE DEAD FROM IT, TOO.
[000:10:33;065] >> Reporter: AND HER MOTHER WAS
[000:10:33;699] AT THE CONCERT, TOO.
[000:10:35;801] YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAYING THAT
[000:10:37;770] THE HARD PART WAS KNOWING SO
[000:10:38;371] MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T GET OUT.
[000:10:39;839] >> I THINK THAT'S THE HARD PART
[000:10:40;473] FOR ALL OF US.
[000:10:41;807] AND SEEING WHAT WE SAW.
[000:10:45;945] AND I THINK, AS A MOM, KNOWING
[000:10:47;847] THAT THEY HAD TO SEE THAT, AND
[000:10:48;481] THAT'S STUCK WITH THEM FOREVER.
[000:10:51;250] >> THE SURGEON TOLD US THAT BOTH
[000:10:52;818] OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO
[000:10:53;452] BE OKAY.
[000:10:55;421] AND THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO THOSE
[000:10:56;022] DOCTORS AND NURSES.
[000:10:56;989] AND AS FOR SHELDON, HE WANTS TO
[000:10:59;592] MEET THAT HERO WHO WAS RIGHT
[000:11:01;661] THERE BY HIS SIDE.
[000:11:02;061] THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HERO WAS
[000:11:02;695] GRAZED BY A BULLET, TOO, BUT IS
[000:11:04;797] NO LONGER AT THE HOSPITAL.
[000:11:05;798] SO, IF THAT HERO IS WATCHING
[000:11:06;399] TONIGHT, SHELDON'S FAMILY WANTS
[000:11:08;968] TO THANK YOU.
[000:11:09;301] >>> WE TURN NOW TO PRESIDENT

[000:11:31;957] DISASTER ZONE QUITE LIKE THIS
[000:11:32;558] ONE.
[000:11:37;029] AT A CHURCH IN SAN JUAN,
[000:11:38;597] PRESIDENT TRUMP TOSSED PAPER
[000:11:40;666] TOWELS TO HURRICANE VICTIMS AS
[000:11:45;905] IF HE WERE PLAYING BASKETBALL.

[000:11:50;209] TOUTED THE DEATH COUNT AS IF HE
[000:11:53;646] WERE KEEPING SCORE.
[000:11:54;080] >> IF YOU LOOK AT A REAL
[000:11:56;782] CATASTROPHE LIKE KATRINA, AND
[000:11:57;383] YOU LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS
[000:11:57;950] HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND
[000:11:58;884] HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT DIED,

[000:12:18;404] COULDN'T HELP BRINGING UP THE
[000:12:19;905] HIGH COST.

[000:12:23;042] PUERTO RICO, BUT YOU'VE THROWN
[000:12:23;676] OUR BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF
[000:12:24;243] WHACK.

[000:12:35;855] >> IT'S ALL ABOUT SAVING LIVES,

[000:12:39;859] MAYOR CALLED THE MEETING
[000:12:41;427] PRODUCTIVE.
[000:12:41;727] BUT ON CNN, SHE DISMISSED THE
[000:12:42;461] PRESIDENTIAL VISIT AS PUBLIC
[000:12:43;062] RELATIONS.
[000:12:47;900] >> RATHER THAN COMMANDER IN
[000:12:49;935] CHIEF, HE SORT OF BECOMES
[000:12:51;337] MISCOMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF.
[000:12:54;406] >> Reporter: BUT NOT FAR FROM
[000:12:57;476] THERE, WE MET UP WITH HECTOR
[000:12:58;077] GARCIA.
[000:12:58;310] HE HAD NO IDEA THE PRESIDENT WAS
[000:12:58;978] ON THE ISLAND, BUT HE TELLS US,
[000:13:01;914] HE'S HAPPY HE'S HERE.
[000:13:03;482] "HE CAME HERE," GARCIA TOLD US,
[000:13:04;116] "BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'RE IN
[000:13:05;885] CRISIS."
[000:13:07;119] DAVID, THE GOVERNOR'S BEING
[000:13:08;621] DIPLOMATIC TONIGHT.
[000:13:09;054] HE SAYS HE APPRECIATES THE
[000:13:09;622] PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND HIS
[000:13:11;223] COMMITMENT TO THE ISLAND OF
[000:13:11;791] PUERTO RICO.
[000:13:13;325] HE WANTS TO SEE RELIEF EFFORTS
[000:13:17;463] CONTINUE, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE
[000:13:18;097] THE U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL SHIP
[000:13:21;100] "COMFORT" BEHIND ME.
[000:13:21;667] THIS JUST GOT HERE TODAY, TWO
[000:13:22;268] WEEKS AFTER THE STORM HIT THE
[000:13:23;736] ISLAND.
[000:13:23;969] DAVID?
[000:13:24;770] >> JON KARL, OUR THANKS TO YOU
[000:13:25;905] TONIGHT.
[000:13:27;873] >>> AND WE WANT TO LET EVERYONE
[000:13:28;507] AT HOME KNOW THAT WE WERE IN
[000:13:29;942] PUERTO RICO OVER THE WEEKEND,
[000:13:30;543] WHEN THE SHOOTING BROKE OUT HERE
[000:13:31;177] IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:13:33;612] AND BEFORE WE LEFT TO COME HERE,
[000:13:35;147] WE HAD GONE TO A NEIGHBORHOOD,
[000:13:35;781] JUST A SHORT DRIVE FROM WHERE
[000:13:36;382] THE PRESIDENT WAS TODAY.
[000:13:39;785] NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE
[000:13:41;754] HURRICANE, WE DISCOVERED
[000:13:43;889] FAMILIES IN SWELTERING HEAT, NO
[000:13:46;358] POWER, NO RUNNING WATER -- AND A
[000:13:47;993] CALL FOR HELP.
[000:13:49;895] WE WENT LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT
[000:13:50;529] BUILDING, JUST 15 MINUTES FROM
[000:13:52;498] THE AIRPORT IN SAN JUAN.
[000:13:53;899] BECAUSE WE HAD HEARD THAT NEARLY
[000:13:56;635] TWO WEEKS AFTER THE HURRICANE
[000:13:57;236] HIT, THEY WERE STILL WITHOUT
[000:13:57;937] POWER AND WITHOUT RUNNING WATER.
[000:13:59;972] WE WALK UP THIS DARKENED
[000:14:00;506] STAIRWELL AND DOWN THE HALLWAY.
[000:14:01;941] LIZBETH?

[000:14:10;516] TAKING CARE OF HER PARENTS.
[000:14:11;183] THE PRESIDENT HAD TWEETED JUST
[000:14:13;352] DAYS AGO, ALL BUILDINGS NOW
[000:14:15;855] INSPECTED.
[000:14:16;355] AND WE WONDERED, HAVE THEY SEEN
[000:14:16;989] ANY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS OR ANY
[000:14:17;957] MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HERE?
[000:14:19;491] WE HAD HEARD THAT INSPECTORS HAD
[000:14:20;559] BEEN VISITING SOME OF THESE
[000:14:23;629] BUILDINGS, ALL OVER PUERTO RICO.
[000:14:24;263] HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INSPECTORS?
[000:14:25;731] >> NO.
[000:14:25;965] NOT AT ALL.
[000:14:27;800] THEY HAVE NOT COME TO SEE WHAT'S
[000:14:29;902] HAPPENED TO THESE APARTMENTS.
[000:14:31;971] >> Reporter: NO ONE HAS COME?
[000:14:32;571] >> NO ONE HAS COME.

[000:14:39;278] CAN YOU DRINK THE WATER?
[000:14:41;313] >> NO, WE CANNOT.
[000:14:41;714] AT ALL.
[000:14:44;450] >> Reporter: INSIDE HER PARENTS'
[000:14:45;084] TINY APARTMENT, THEIR WINDOWS
[000:14:45;684] STILL BLOWN OUT BY HURRICANE
[000:14:46;285] MARIA.
[000:14:48;087] AND IN THE BEDROOM, HER PARENTS,
[000:14:49;121] ELMER AND GLORIA, ON THE BED IN
[000:14:52;258] NEED OF MEDICATION.
[000:14:53;792] THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY ANY
[000:14:54;360] DOCTOR HAD PAID A VISIT.
[000:14:57;463] THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE?
[000:15:00;065] >> THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE.
[000:15:05;938] >> Reporter: AND IT'S MOTRIN.
[000:15:08;374] >> I HAD A PIECE OF BREAD, HALF
[000:15:09;909] OF BREAD AND I SHARED IT WITH,
[000:15:12;077] LIKE, FOUR APARTMENTS.
[000:15:12;544] >> Reporter: DOWN THE HALLWAY,
[000:15:13;579] WE SEE OTHER RESIDENTS, SOME
[000:15:14;179] CARRYING FLASHLIGHTS.
[000:15:17;216] AND WE HEAD INTO ONE OF THOSE
[000:15:17;917] APARTMENTS, WHERE WE MEET A
[000:15:18;484] WOMAN LIZBETH HAS BEEN SHARING
[000:15:19;118] HER BREAD AND WATER WITH.
[000:15:21;921] MARIA DIAZ IS 70, AND SHE TELLS
[000:15:24;056] US, SHE'S BEEN DRINKING THE
[000:15:25;958] WATER FROM THE FAUCET, EVEN
[000:15:26;525] THOUGH SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT SAFE.
[000:15:30;729] SHE HOLDS AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF
[000:15:32;798] WATER.
[000:15:33;899] TELLING US IT COST $6.
[000:15:38;003] WITH LITTLE FOOD AND NO CLEAN
[000:15:39;538] WATER, SHE IS PANIC-STRICKEN,
[000:15:41;140] TELLING ME, "I DON'T WANT TO DIE
[000:15:41;774] HERE."
[000:15:41;974] IN SO MANY OF THESE APARTMENT
[000:15:42;675] BUILDINGS, THEY ARE UNAWARE OF
[000:15:45;911] THE FEMA HELP, BECAUSE THEY HAVE
[000:15:46;545] NO POWER, NO ACCESS TO THE NEWS.
[000:15:49;448] AND TONIGHT, JUST 7% OF THE
[000:15:50;015] ISLAND HAS POWER BACK.
[000:15:53;085] THIS BUILDING DOES NOT.
[000:15:53;986] A GENERATOR IS TURNED ON A
[000:15:56;188] COUPLE OF HOURS A NIGHT.
[000:15:56;689] AND WE WALK UP THE STAIRS,

[000:15:58;390] THIS BUILDING.
[000:16:05;597] AGAIN, THEY TELL US, NO FOOD.
[000:16:08;667] DOWN THE HALL, YOU CAN SEE THE
[000:16:09;902] DESTRUCTION THROUGH THE WINDOW.
[000:16:12;104] WE STEP OVER A DOORWAY BLOWN IN
[000:16:13;872] BY THE HURRICANE.
[000:16:14;273] FLOOR AFTER FLOOR, WE HEAR THE

[000:17:08;560] moderate to severe RA for whom
[000:17:08;560] methotrexate did not work well.
[000:17:12;164] XELJANZ can reduce joint pain
[000:17:12;164] and swelling in as little as
[000:17:14;900] two weeks, and help stop further
[000:17:14;900] joint damage.
[000:17:17;569] XELJANZ can lower your ability
[000:17:17;569] to fight infections,
[000:17:20;205] including tuberculosis.
[000:17:21;907] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:17:21;907] infections, lymphoma and other
[000:17:24;043] cancers have happened.
[000:17:25;377] Don't start XELJANZ if you have
[000:17:25;377] an infection.
[000:17:27;579] Tears in the stomach or
[000:17:27;579] intestines, low blood cell
[000:17:29;381] counts and higher liver tests
[000:17:29;381] and cholesterol levels have
[000:17:31;917] happened.
[000:17:32;985] Your doctor should perform blood
[000:17:32;985] tests before you
[000:17:34;586] start and while taking XELJANZ,
[000:17:34;586] and monitor certain liver tests.
[000:17:37;423] Tell your doctor if you were in
[000:17:37;423] a region where fungal
[000:17:39;591] infections are common and if you
[000:17:39;591] have had TB,
[000:17:41;427] hepatitis B or C, or are prone
[000:17:41;427] to infections.
[000:17:44;563] XELJANZ can reduce the symptoms
[000:17:44;563] of RA,
[000:17:46;865] even without methotrexate, and
[000:17:46;865] is also available
[000:17:49;902] in a once-daily pill.

[000:20:19;484] IMAGES TONIGHT.
[000:20:20;419] THE PRESSURE COOKER BOMB
[000:20:21;453] EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK CITY.
[000:20:24;223] WHAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE.
[000:20:27;259] Woman: We demand a lot
[000:20:28;460] from our eyes every day.
[000:20:29;861] I should know.
[000:20:30;896] I have Chronic Dry Eye
[000:20:32;531] caused by reduced
[000:20:32;531] tear production
[000:20:34;299] due to inflammation.
[000:20:35;534] So I use RESTASIS MultiDose®.
[000:20:37;836] It helps me make more
[000:20:37;836] of my own tears,
[000:20:40;305] with continued use,
[000:20:41;740] twice a day, every day.
[000:20:43;675] It's also what I prescribe
[000:20:43;675] to my patients
[000:20:45;978] who have this condition.
[000:20:47;279] RESTASIS MultiDose®
[000:20:48;647] helps increase your
[000:20:48;647] eyes' natural ability
[000:20:50;315] to produce tears,
[000:20:51;516] which may be reduced
[000:20:51;516] by inflammation
[000:20:53;385] due to Chronic Dry Eye.
[000:20:55;053] RESTASIS MultiDose® did
[000:20:55;053] not increase tear production
[000:20:57;422] in patients using
[000:20:57;422] anti-inflammatory eye drops
[000:20:59;891] or tear duct plugs.
[000:21:01;360] To help avoid eye injury
[000:21:01;360] and contamination,
[000:21:03;695] do not touch the bottle tip
[000:21:03;695] to your eye or other surfaces.
[000:21:06;999] Wait 15 minutes after use
[000:21:08;600] before inserting
[000:21:08;600] contact lenses.
[000:21:10;736] The most common side effect
[000:21:11;970] is a temporary
[000:21:11;970] burning sensation.
[000:21:15;440] Ask your eye doctor about

[000:22:14;533] originally discovered...
[000:22:16;068] in jellyfish.
[000:22:17;302] In clinical trials,
[000:22:17;302] Prevagen has been shown
[000:22:19;504] to improve short-term memory.
[000:22:22;207] Prevagen. The name to remember.
[000:22:28;580] W...I was always searching for
[000:22:28;580] ways to manage my symptoms.
[000:22:32;584] I thought I had it covered.
[000:22:34;753] Then I realized managing was
[000:22:34;753] all I was doing.
[000:22:38;457] When I finally told my doctor,
[000:22:39;658] he said HUMIRA was for people
[000:22:39;658] like me
[000:22:41;493] who have tried other
[000:22:41;493] medications,...
[000:22:42;928] but still experience the
[000:22:42;928] symptoms
[000:22:44;196] of moderate to severe
[000:22:44;196] Crohn's disease.
[000:22:46;098] In clinical studies,
[000:22:46;998] the majority of patients
[000:22:46;998] on HUMIRA
[000:22:48;600] saw significant symptom
[000:22:48;600] relief...
[000:22:49;935] ...and many achieved remission.
[000:22:51;603] HUMIRA can lower your ability to
[000:22:51;603] fight infections...
[000:22:54;072] ...including tuberculosis.
[000:22:55;307] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:22:55;307] infections and cancers,...
[000:22:57;576] including lymphoma, have
[000:22:57;576] happened;
[000:22:59;544] as have blood, liver, and
[000:22:59;544] nervous system problems,
[000:23:01;747] serious allergic
[000:23:01;747] reactions,...
[000:23:03;048] ...and new or worsening heart
[000:23:03;048] failure.
[000:23:04;683] Before treatment, get tested
[000:23:04;683] for TB.
[000:23:07;085] Tell your doctor if you've been
[000:23:07;085] to areas
[000:23:08;754] where certain fungal infections
[000:23:08;754] are common,
[000:23:10;689] and if you've had TB,...
[000:23:11;957] ...hepatitis B, are prone to
[000:23:11;957] infections,
[000:23:14;226] ...or have flu-like symptoms
[000:23:14;226] or sores.
[000:23:16;027] Don't start HUMIRA if you have
[000:23:16;027] an infection.
[000:23:18;096] If you're still just managing
[000:23:18;096] your symptoms,
[000:23:20;065] ask your gastroenterologist
[000:23:20;065] about HUMIRA.
[000:23:22;501] With HUMIRA, remission
[000:23:22;501] is possible.
