laxatives

and soften.

in reality
they're not.

580
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
If a denture were to be
put under a microscope,

581
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
we can see all the bacteria

582
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that still exists
on the denture,

583
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and that bacteria multiplies
very rapidly.

584
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's why dentists recommend

585
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
