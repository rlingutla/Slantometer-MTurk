[000:00:01;334] JOINING US.
[000:00:05;605] ARTHEL: WE KNOW YOU HAVE CHOICES
[000:00:06;473] AND ARE THANKFUL YOU SPEND YOUR
[000:00:07;207] TIME WITH US ON THE FOX NEWS
[000:00:08;108] CHANNEL.
[000:00:09;509] THE FOX NEWS REPORT IS UP NEXT.
[000:00:13;947] LAURA INGLE IS IN FOR HARRIS
[000:00:17;350] FAULKNER.
[000:00:18;918] >> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
[000:00:21;988] FACING CHALLENGES AT HOME AND
[000:00:22;756] ABROAD AS IT RAMPS UP THE SEARCH
[000:00:26;893] FOR THE NEXT FBI DIRECTOR AND
[000:00:29;095] RESPONSE ON THE LATEST NORTH
[000:00:31;631] KOREAN MISSILE LAUNCH.
[000:00:36;269] THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.
[000:00:38;972] THE WHITE HOUSE IS RESPONDING TO
[000:00:40;306] THE LATEST PROVOCATION FROM
[000:00:46;880] NORTH KOREA.
[000:00:48;048] IT CAME JUST A DAY AFTER A
[000:00:48;681] SENIOR NORTH KOREAN DIPLOMAT
[000:00:49;349] SAID THEY WOULD ENGAGE IN TALK
[000:00:50;050] WITH THE U.S.
[000:00:50;550] MEANWHILE, THE ADMINISTRATION
[000:00:53;887] WASTING NO TIME ON THE SEARCH
[000:00:55;889] FOR A NEW FBI DIRECTOR.
[000:00:56;890] THEY ARE WEIGHING IN ON MORE
[000:00:59;092] THAN A DOZEN CANDIDATES AND
[000:00:59;826] INTERVIEWING AT LEAST EIGHT OF
[000:01:02;629] THEM THIS WEEKEND.
[000:01:03;530] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE COULD
[000:01:05;231] HAVE AN APPOINTMENT BY FRIDAY
[000:01:07;367] BEFORE HEADING ON HIS FIRST
[000:01:08;735] FOREIGN TRIP AS PRESIDENT.
[000:01:10;503] THIS IS HAPPENING AS THE
[000:01:12;238] ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO PUT
[000:01:15;008] OUT A FIRE STORM AFTER JAMES
[000:01:17;510] COMAY'S OUSTING.
[000:01:19;646] WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR KELLYANNE
[000:01:22;749] CONWAY SAID THAT IS NOT THE CA
[000:01:30;423] CASE.
[000:01:30;790] >> INDEPENDENT OF THAT, HIS
[000:01:31;458] DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO
[000:01:32;125] OVERSEES THE FBI, THAT'S HIS
[000:01:32;792] JOB, HE CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION
[000:01:33;626] ON HIS OWN AND MADE THE
[000:01:34;227] RECOMMENDATION.
[000:01:36;362] NOW, I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT
[000:01:40;200] EVERYONE IS SAYING JAMES COMEY
[000:01:40;900] WAS INVESTIGATING.
[000:01:42;602] NO, HE WASN'T.
[000:01:43;136] THE FBI WAS INVESTIGATING AND
[000:01:44;504] THEY WILL CONTINUE TO
[000:01:45;872] INVESTIGATE.
[000:01:51;778] LAURA: WE HAVE FOX TEAM COVERAGE
[000:01:52;512] ON ALL OF THIS.
[000:01:52;979] CAROLINE SHIVELY IS IN
[000:01:53;546] WASHINGTON WITH THE LATEST ON
[000:01:54;347] NORTH KOREA.
[000:01:55;982] FIRST WE GO TO KEVIN ON THE
[000:01:58;184] NORTH LAWN AND WE HAVE HEARD THE
[000:02:00;286] PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO FILL THE
[000:02:01;020] POST AT THE FBI BY FRIDAY.
[000:02:03;189] WHAT IS THE HURRY?
[000:02:12;632] >> I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS.
[000:02:13;333] THEY FEEL THIS IS A POSITION
[000:02:14;167] THEY CAN FILL WITH RELATIVE EASE
[000:02:14;901] AND FIND A VERY HIGHLY QUALIFIED
[000:02:15;635] CANDIDATE.
[000:02:16;002] IN FACT, YOU CAN MAKE A
[000:02:16;603] PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT THAT
[000:02:17;203] WHITTLING DOWN THE FIELD IS
[000:02:17;871] PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE MOST
[000:02:19;706] DIFFICULT PART HAS AS I SHOW YOU
[000:02:20;440] THE NAMES AND FACES WE'VE
[000:02:22;208] ALREADY TALKED ABOUT, WE ARE
[000:02:27;313] TALKING OF SOME OF THE MOST
[000:02:27;981] HIGHLY QUALIFIED SPECIALISTS IN
[000:02:28;715] THIS AREA.
[000:02:30;984] BIG NAMES INCLUDE FRAN TOWNSEND,
[000:02:35;288] MIKE ROGERS, HIMSELF A FORMER
[000:02:40;393] FBI AGENT AND HE HAS ALSO BEEN
[000:02:42;662] ENDORSED BY A GROUP OF FORMER
[000:02:47;400] AND CURRENT FBI AGENTS.
[000:02:48;001] FOR HIS PART, THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:48;668] SPENT HIS SATURDAY DELIVERING
[000:02:49;869] HIS VERY FIRST COMMENCEMENT
[000:02:53;006] ADDRESS AT LIBERTY UNIVERSITY.
[000:02:54;207] HE SAID THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE A
[000:02:56;442] GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO WHITTLE
[000:02:58;645] DOWN.
[000:03:04;317] >> BEFORE YOU LEAVE BEFORE
[000:03:04;951] SATURDAY'S DEPARTURE.
[000:03:05;585] >> THESE ARE OUTSTANDING PEOPLE
[000:03:07;086] WHO ARE VERY WELL KNOWN.
[000:03:09;255] >> BEFORE THE TRIP NEXT WEEK?
[000:03:11;191] >> EVEN THAT IS POSSIBLE.
[000:03:15;728] >> SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS IT'S
[000:03:16;529] UNLIKELY THE PRESIDENT WILL LOOK
[000:03:18;531] FOR SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM A
[000:03:24;837] SPECIFIC OR STRICTLY POLITICAL
[000:03:25;538] BACKGROUND.
[000:03:25;939] LIKELY HE WILL DRAW ON SOMEONE
[000:03:26;639] WHO HAS EXPERIENCE FROM THE
[000:03:27;307] INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
[000:03:27;874] SPECIFICALLY AND MAYBE SOMEONE
[000:03:29;609] WHO CAN SAY THEY'VE DONE A BIT
[000:03:31;010] OF BOTH.
[000:03:36;049] LAURA: SOME FROM CAPITOL HILL
[000:03:36;749] ARE FLOATING THEIR OWN IDEAS
[000:03:38;151] ABOUT WHO THEY THINK MIGHT BE A
[000:03:39;886] GOOD PERSON TO LEAD THE FBI.
[000:03:41;888] WHAT ARE YOU HEARING.
[000:03:45;992] >> YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS NOT
[000:03:46;693] JUST HIGHLY QUALIFIED.
[000:03:49;529] LAWMAKERS WILL TELL YOU YOU WANT
[000:03:51;030] SOMEONE WHO IS NOT JUST
[000:03:52;365] QUALIFIED, BUT PASSABLE AND THAT
[000:03:58;805] MEANS APOLITICAL AS BEST YOU CAN
[000:03:59;539] MANAGE THAT.
[000:03:59;939] ONE NAME THAT'S BEEN TOSSED OUT,
[000:04:01;407] IT'S COMPLETELY COUNTERINTUITIVE
[000:04:04;544] BUT IT'S A NAME THAT PEOPLE ARE
[000:04:05;278] TALKING ABOUT AND THAT IS
[000:04:05;912] MERRICK GARLAND.
[000:04:07;146] CHIEF JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND.
[000:04:10;250] REMEMBER HIM, NOMINATED FOR THE
[000:04:10;984] SUPREME COURT.
[000:04:11;985] HE NEVER GOT AN UP OR DOWN VOTE.
[000:04:12;719] THERE ARE SOME WHO FEEL HE WOULD
[000:04:14;687] BE A GREAT COMPROMISE CANDIDATE.
[000:04:19;659] >> THE OUTCOME OF INVESTIGATIONS
[000:04:26;633] SHOULD NOT HAVE PARTISAN
[000:04:27;233] AFFILIATION.
[000:04:27;667] I THINK IN THIS INSTANCE THERE
[000:04:30;603] ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE.
[000:04:33;906] MERRICK GARLAND WOULD BE A GOOD
[000:04:34;641] OPTION GIVEN THAT HE COULD HAVE
[000:04:35;375] SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES
[000:04:36;109] OF THE AISLE.
[000:04:37;510] >> I WOULD STRONGLY URGE THE
[000:04:40;613] ADMINISTRATION TO PICK SOMEONE
[000:04:41;314] WHO IS APOLITICAL.
[000:04:41;814] ONE OF THE HEIGHTENED
[000:04:42;382] RESPONSIBILITIES WE WILL HAVE IS
[000:04:44;550] MAKING SURE THAT WHOEVER COMES
[000:04:47;654] IN, THIS INVESTIGATION GOES ON
[000:04:49;922] UNIMPEDED.
[000:04:51;090] >> MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT,
[000:04:53;092] GARLAND WOULD BE A VERY
[000:04:54;093] LONGSHOT, BUT KEEP IN MIND THERE
[000:04:56;763] ARE A NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS ON THE
[000:04:58;965] HILL WHO FEEL THAT BECAUSE HE IS
[000:05:00;533] APOLITICAL, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO
[000:05:01;467] MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE
[000:05:03;803] INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
[000:05:06;005] MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION
[000:05:07;106] CAMPAIGN.
[000:05:08;708] BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU
[000:05:11;577] KEEPING TRACK, IT ENDED SIX
[000:05:12;845] MONTHS AGO.
[000:05:17;083] LAURA: WE KNOW IT WILL BE AN
[000:05:18;284] INTERESTING WEEK RIGHT WHERE YOU
[000:05:19;686] ARE PAIRED NEW DETAILS ON THE
[000:05:27;393] NORTH KOREAN MISSILE LAUNCH.
[000:05:28;061] U.S. OFFICIALS TELLING FOX NEWS
[000:05:28;795] THE REGIME APPEARS TO HAVE FIRED
[000:05:29;529] WHAT IS KNOWN AS A CAYENNE 17
[000:05:30;229] BALLISTIC MISSILE.
[000:05:31;331] EXPERTS BELIEVE NORTH KOREA
[000:05:32;365] WOULD USE THIS PARTICULAR
[000:05:33;800] MISSILE TO TARGET SHIPS.
[000:05:35;902] IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT
[000:05:44;844] OUT THIS WAS THE FIRST WEAPONS
[000:05:45;545] TEST SINCE THE NEW SOUTH KOREAN
[000:05:46;279] PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE.
[000:05:46;846] THE NORTH HAS CONDUCTED AT LEAST
[000:05:47;580] TWO DOZEN TESTS OVER THE PAST
[000:05:48;281] YEAR.
[000:05:50;450] AT LEAST SEVEN OF THOSE FAILED.
[000:05:53;820] THIS LATEST TEST APPEARS TO HAVE
[000:05:56;189] SUNK THE IDEA OF THE U.S.
[000:05:59;359] SPEAKING WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:06:01;728] NIKKI HALEY SAYS THE U.S. CANNOT
[000:06:03;029] LET UP.
[000:06:06;833] >> I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET INTO
[000:06:07;567] KIM JONG-UN'S HEAD.
[000:06:09;502] HE IS IN A STATE OF PARANOIA.
[000:06:17;377] HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING
[000:06:18;077] AND EVERYTHING AROUND HIM.
[000:06:18;711] THIS WAS A MESSAGE TO SOUTH
[000:06:19;379] KOREA AFTER THE ELECTION AND
[000:06:20;046] WHAT WE WILL DO IS TIGHTEN THE
[000:06:20;747] SCREWS.
[000:06:21;080] HE FEELS IT.
[000:06:21;948] WE WILL CONTINUE WHETHER IT
[000:06:22;749] SANCTIONS, PRESS STATEMENTS,
[000:06:27;186] ANYTHING WE HAVE TO DO.
[000:06:28;187] LAURA: CAROLINE SHIVELY IS LIVE
[000:06:31;023] IN WASHINGTON.
[000:06:45;805] IF THIS IS A MEDIUM RANGE
[000:06:46;706] MISSILE, WHAT DAMAGE CAN IT DO?
[000:06:47;507] >> IT CAN DO SOME DEFINITE
[000:06:48;141] DAMAGE.
[000:06:48;474] WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THE NEWS
[000:06:49;175] AGENCY SAID THE AIM WAS TO
[000:06:49;809] VERIFY THAT THE MISSILE COULD
[000:06:50;510] CARRY A LARGE SCALE NUCLEAR
[000:06:51;177] WARHEAD AND THEY ARE CALLING IT
[000:06:51;911] A SUCCESS.
[000:06:52;278] THERE IS WHAT U.S. OFFICIALS
[000:06:52;945] SAY.
[000:06:53;212] IT IS A SINGLE STAGE LIQUID
[000:06:53;946] FUELED MISSILE, NOT THE SOLID
[000:07:04;957] FUEL MISSILE THAT WAS TESTED
[000:07:05;625] BACK IN FEBRUARY.
[000:07:06;125] THAT CAUSED MORE CONCERN FOR
[000:07:06;793] PENTAGON OFFICIALS.
[000:07:07;326] IT WAS IN THE AIR FOR ROUGHLY 30
[000:07:08;060] MINUTES AND TRAVELED ABOUT
[000:07:08;694] 430 MILES ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH
[000:07:09;429] KOREAN MILITARY.
[000:07:09;896] A MEDIUM RANGE MISSILE CAN GO
[000:07:10;596] FURTHER BUT THIS HAD A VERY HIGH
[000:07:11;664] TRAJECTORY.
[000:07:16;569] THE U.S. OFFICIALS THAT IT
[000:07:17;203] SPLASHED DOWN IN THE SEAS
[000:07:19;205] 60 MILES SOUTH OF RUSSIA AND 25.
[000:07:21;841] IT COULD NOT HAVE REACHED THE
[000:07:24;544] U.S. BUT THE STATEMENT, JUST OUT
[000:07:25;845] FROM THE NORTH REAFFIRMS IT IS
[000:07:26;946] ONE OF KIM JONG-UN'S MAIN GOALS
[000:07:30;183] FOR HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
[000:07:33;586] DAN SULLIVAN OF ALASKA SAID HE
[000:07:34;287] PLANS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION
[000:07:35;521] NEXT WEEK THAT AUTHORIZES
[000:07:37;490] GROUND-BASED INTERCEPTORS TO BE
[000:07:39;725] LINED UP IN ALASKA AND
[000:07:41;160] CALIFORNIA.
[000:07:44;197] THAT IS A THIRD MORE THAN THE
[000:07:44;897] U.S. HAS RIGHT NOW.
[000:07:47;233] >> WE KNOW THE U.S. IS PUSHING
[000:07:49;469] BACK ON NORTH KOREA.
[000:07:52;939] WE'VE BEEN REPORTING.
[000:07:53;706] WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE
[000:07:54;340] INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY?
[000:07:55;007] >> CHINA AND RUSSIA BOTH SAID
[000:07:56;642] THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
[000:07:58;945] LAUNCH, BUT IT WAS A PRETTY
[000:08:00;480] TEPID RESPONSE.
[000:08:01;080] NOT THE U.S. THOUGH.
[000:08:01;614] THEY SEEM TO BE PUSHING
[000:08:02;615] COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO GET
[000:08:04;650] TOUGHER.
[000:08:09;255] >> WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THE
[000:08:09;889] INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS
[000:08:10;523] CONCERNED.
[000:08:10;890] IT'S NOT JUST US AGAINST THEM.
[000:08:11;591] YOU WILL SEE THE ENTIRE
[000:08:12;191] INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ISOLATE
[000:08:12;992] NORTH KOREA AND LET THEM KNOW
[000:08:17;897] THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
[000:08:18;698] >> THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WILL
[000:08:19;432] HOLD URGENT MEETINGS ON THE TEST
[000:08:22;068] THIS TUESDAY.
[000:08:24;070] THE U.S., JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA
[000:08:24;804] ALL ASKED FOR THE MEETING.
[000:08:25;471] THEY HAVE ADOPTED TOUGH
[000:08:26;239] SANCTIONS BUT THEY DON'T APPEAR
[000:08:27;907] TO BE SLOWING KIM JONG-UN DOWN.
[000:08:30;443] AMBASSADOR HALEY SAID MORE
[000:08:32;311] SANCTIONS COULD BE ON THE WAY
[000:08:34;447] AND THE POTENTIAL MEETING
[000:08:39;785] BETWEEN KIM JONG-UN AND
[000:08:40;386] PRESIDENT TRUMP, NOT HAPPENING.
[000:08:41;187] >> HAVING A MISSILE TEST IS NOT
[000:08:42;822] THE WAY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE
[000:08:43;489] PRESIDENT.
[000:08:44;891] HE ABSOLUTELY WON'T DO IT.
[000:08:47;093] HE CAN SAY ALL THE CONDITIONS HE
[000:08:49;128] WANTS.
[000:08:51;931] UNTIL HE MEETS OUR CONDITIONS WE
[000:08:52;665] AREN'T SITTING DOWN WITH HIM.
[000:08:54;367] LAURA: YOU MENTION THE TIMING
[000:08:58;070] JUST DAYS AFTER THE SOUTH KOREAN
[000:08:58;804] PRESIDENT CAME INTO OFFICE.
[000:09:00;873] IT ALSO COMES AS THE U.S. AND
[000:09:01;574] JAPANESE NAVIES HAVE COME
[000:09:02;708] TOGETHER FOR WARGAMES IN THE
[000:09:04;210] SOUTH PACIFIC.
[000:09:10;283] LAURA: WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK
[000:09:10;950] ABOUT.
[000:09:11;250] LET'S BRING IN KEVIN RUDD WHO
[000:09:11;951] JOINS US BY PHONE.
[000:09:12;451] HE IS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER
[000:09:13;586] OF AUSTRALIA AND PRESIDENT OF
[000:09:14;987] THE ASIA POLICY INSTITUTE.
[000:09:18;424] THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
[000:09:22;228] >> DO YOU THINK THE RESPONSE
[000:09:24;130] FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
[000:09:27;500] GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO
[000:09:28;234] CALM THE SITUATION DOWN?
[000:09:29;569] HOW DO YOU THINK OUR ALLIES WILL
[000:09:33;306] HELP HANDLE THIS WITH DIPLOMACY?
[000:09:36;275] >> REMEMBER THE KEY OBJECTIVE IS
[000:09:39;712] TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN NORTH
[000:09:40;446] KOREAN BEHAVIOR.
[000:09:42;248] EVERYTHING ELSE IS A SOUND AND
[000:09:44;584] LIGHT SHOW.
[000:09:46;452] THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT CAN YOU
[000:09:48;087] DO TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN
[000:09:49;288] BEHAVIOR.
[000:09:51;591] THE OUTCOME OF THE MAR-A-LAGO
[000:09:53;826] MEETING WAS FOR THE TWO SIDES TO
[000:09:56;762] WORK ON A COMMON DIPLOMATIC
[000:09:59;131] STRATEGY TO BRING ABOUT THAT
[000:10:00;533] CHANGE IN NORTH KOREA.
[000:10:02;468] SO FAR, WITHOUT RESULT AS YOU'VE
[000:10:04;537] JUST DISCUSSED WITH THE MOST
[000:10:06;973] RECENT MISSILE TEST, BUT FROM
[000:10:08;808] CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE, THIS
[000:10:14;046] MISSILE TEST BY THE NORTH KOREAN
[000:10:16;482] IS THE LEAST WELCOMED
[000:10:17;049] DEVELOPMENT.
[000:10:18;751] IT SENDS A DIRECT SIGNAL TO THE
[000:10:24;790] NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF SOUTH
[000:10:25;524] KOREA LESS THAN A WEEK AGO THAT
[000:10:26;258] THE NORTH KOREANS ARE IN A
[000:10:26;892] BELLIGERENT MOOD.
[000:10:28;327] FROM CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE IN
[000:10:30;329] BEIJING, IT WAS A MAJOR GLOBAL
[000:10:33;466] CONFERENCE HOSTED HERE YESTERDAY
[000:10:35;167] ON A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE
[000:10:37;169] CONFERENCE.
[000:10:40;239] WHO UPSETS THE PARTY BUT THE GUY
[000:10:43;009] NEXT DOOR.
[000:10:44;076] HE DOESN'T DO A LOT IN TERMS OF
[000:10:45;745] IMPROVING CHINA'S SENSE OF HUMOR
[000:10:46;646] ABOUT WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN
[000:10:48;447] LEADER IS UP TOO.
[000:10:50;750] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
[000:10:52;351] CALLING FOR EVEN STRONGER
[000:10:54;754] SANCTIONS AND EVEN THOUGH THE
[000:10:55;588] U.S. IS APPLYING PRESSURE, WE
[000:10:57;590] HAVE NORTH KOREA WRITING A
[000:11:01;827] LETTER TO THE CONGRESS
[000:11:02;828] COMPLAINING ABOUT THESE
[000:11:03;429] SANCTIONS.
[000:11:05;731] WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?
[000:11:09;568] >> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE NORTH
[000:11:11;370] KOREAN DIPLOMATIC BEHAVIOR HAS A
[000:11:12;104] HISTORY OF BEING ALL OVER THE
[000:11:13;406] PLACE.
[000:11:16;475] SOMETIMES IT IS HARSH.
[000:11:19;412] I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING THAT
[000:11:25;518] ANYONE IN THE UNITED STATES
[000:11:26;252] SHOULD TAKE TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY.
[000:11:26;986] THE BOTTOM LINE IS PEOPLE WATCH
[000:11:28;888] THEIR BEHAVIOR AND THE MISSILE
[000:11:30;156] TEST IS AN ACTION BY THE NORTH
[000:11:31;190] KOREANS WHICH IS BY DEFINITION
[000:11:31;991] BELLIGERENT.
[000:11:32;391] LET'S NOT GET DISTRACTED FROM
[000:11:34;293] THE CORE ACTION WHICH IS WHAT IS
[000:11:37;563] THE UNITED STATES DOING WITH THE
[000:11:39;732] CHINESE TO BRING ABOUT
[000:11:40;700] SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN NORTH
[000:11:42;601] KOREAN BEHAVIOR?
[000:11:46;672] THE KEY TO THIS, IF THERE IS
[000:11:47;873] FURTHER SANCTIONS AND WHETHER
[000:11:49;508] THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE SUPPLY OF
[000:11:51;110] OIL FROM CHINA TO NORTH KOREA.
[000:11:52;645] THIS IS THE CORE POINT OF
[000:11:55;381] LEVERAGE.
[000:11:57;149] NORTH KOREA DEPENDS ON CHINA OIL
[000:12:02;021] TO KEEP THEIR ECONOMY RUNNING.
[000:12:04;690] THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH CHINA
[000:12:06;992] LEVERAGE WOULD BEGIN TO HAVE AN
[000:12:07;760] IMPACT.
[000:12:08;494] LAURA: I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT
[000:12:10;796] A REPORT THAT WAS OUT TODAY.
[000:12:13;232] CONGRESS IS WEIGHING OPTIONS FOR
[000:12:15;534] BOLSTERING SANCTIONS AGAINST
[000:12:18;070] NORTH KOREA BY INCREASING THE
[000:12:24;110] MISSILES ON THE WEST COAST.
[000:12:26;612] THIS RECENT MISSILE CAME
[000:12:31;851] 60 MILES OFF RUSSIA.
[000:12:36;388] >> THESE FALL INTO THREE
[000:12:37;356] CATEGORIES.
[000:12:38;691] SHORT RANGE WHICH CAN WORK FOR
[000:12:41;393] THEM ACROSS THE PARALLEL WITH
[000:12:43;395] SOUTH KOREA, MEDIUM RANGE WHICH
[000:12:45;331] WOULD AFFECT JAPAN AND AMERICAN
[000:12:49;635] DEPLOYMENTS IN GUAM, AND
[000:12:53;873] LONG-RANGE MISSILES OR
[000:12:54;507] INTERCONTINENTAL MISSILES WHICH
[000:12:56;809] COULD REACH ALASKA AND THE U.S.
[000:13:00;412] WEST COAST.
[000:13:01;680] THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN
[000:13:02;615] TESTING THE FIRST TWO SETS OF
[000:13:05;651] CATEGORIES OF THAT AND THAT IN
[000:13:07;820] OF ITSELF IS DESTABILIZING.
[000:13:09;955] THE CORE QUESTION IS, I
[000:13:11;991] UNDERSTAND THE DEBATE IN THE
[000:13:17;997] U.S. THAT THERE ARE ANTIMISSILE
[000:13:18;731] DEFENSE.
[000:13:19;131] THAT IS A NORMAL REACTION TO
[000:13:19;799] WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE DOING
[000:13:20;533] AND IRRATIONAL REASON BUT IF
[000:13:22;535] THEY REQUIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF
[000:13:23;936] MISSILES, AND THEY ALREADY HAVE
[000:13:25;538] A LARGE NUMBER OF BOMBS, IF THEY
[000:13:27;540] ARE ABLE TO MILITARIZE THOSE
[000:13:30;176] NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND HAVE A LARGE
[000:13:34;647] STOCK, THE DANGER FOR ALL OF US
[000:13:35;381] IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE
[000:13:37;116] U.S. ALLIES IN THE REGION IS
[000:13:39;585] THAT THEY HAVE A LARGE NUMBER
[000:13:41;954] AND THEY CAN OVERWHELM A MISSILE
[000:13:44;757] DEFENSE SYSTEM SO THERE IS A
[000:13:46;358] RACE AGAINST CAPABILITY AND THE
[000:13:49;428] NUMBER OF MISSILES AS WELL.

[000:23:47;592] LAURA: WHILE THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC
[000:23:49;928] IS SPREADING IN AMERICA, A NEW
[000:23:51;229] TREND IS RISING CALLED HONEST
[000:23:51;930] OBITUARIES.
[000:23:54;332] MORE AND MORE WHO HAVE LOST
[000:23:58;170] LOVED ONES TO DRUG ADDICTION
[000:24:00;705] HAVE WRITTEN HONEST OBITUARIES
[000:24:02;607] TO EXPOSE HOW DAMAGING IT IS.
[000:24:07;913] >> USING HEROIN ONCE IS ALL IT
[000:24:09;247] TAKES TO GET HOOKED.
[000:24:10;549] FROM THEN ON YOU ARE PLAYING
[000:24:11;650] RUSSIAN ROULETTE.
[000:24:14;786] THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDREW.
[000:24:16;288] LAURA: HERE IS A CLOSE LOOK AT
[000:24:17;155] THE STORY.
[000:24:18;590] HI BRIAN.
[000:24:22;994] >> MOTHER'S DAY IS NOT AN EASY
[000:24:23;695] DAY FOR EVERYONE.
[000:24:24;196] FOR STEPHANIE OSWALD, THIS IS
[000:24:26;031] HER FIRST WITHOUT HER SON
[000:24:27;232] ANDREW.
[000:24:27;799] DESPITE REHAB, HE DIED ALONE IN
[000:24:29;568] HIS APARTMENT FROM A HEROINE
[000:24:30;235] OVERDOSE.
[000:24:31;470] IT'S NOT THE KIND OF THINGS
[000:24:34;473] PARENTS WOULD USUALLY INCLUDE IN
[000:24:35;974] THEIR CHILDHOO OBITUARY BUT STEE
[000:24:38;410] DID.
[000:24:40;679] >> ON JANUARY 27, 2017, OUR
[000:24:42;848] BEAUTIFUL SON ANDREW DIED FROM A
[000:24:45;150] HEROIN OVERDOSE.
[000:24:46;284] HE WAS 23 YEARS OLD.
[000:24:47;652] NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO
[000:24:52;691] BURY THEIR CHILD.
[000:25:05;337] >> MORE PARENTS ARE USING STARK
[000:25:06;071] CANDOR IN THEIR CHILD'S OBITUARY
[000:25:06;805] ABOUT HEROIN ADDICTION TO REACH
[000:25:07;539] OUT TO FAMILIES STRUGGLING IN
[000:25:08;240] SILENCE, FEELING SHAME AND
[000:25:08;874] EMBARRASSMENT.
[000:25:09;374] >> PEOPLE HAVE TO STOP SEEING IT
[000:25:12;410] AS A DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.
[000:25:15;347] IT'S EVERYWHERE.
[000:25:17;415] THE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE HONEST
[000:25:19;918] ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE,
[000:25:22;187] THE MORE ATTENTION IT CAN GET.
[000:25:26;458] >> ANDREWS ADDICTION BEGAN AFTER
[000:25:28;293] BEING PRESCRIBED OXYCODONE AFTER
[000:25:37;068] A CAR ACCIDENT.
[000:25:37;669] STEPHANIE SAID SHE WAS HESITANT
[000:25:38;470] AT FIRST ABOUT BEING SO PUBLIC.
[000:25:39;271] >> SINCE HE HAD KEPT IT SUCH A
[000:25:40;705] SECRET TO ALL OF HIS FRIENDS
[000:25:42;507] HERE, I FEEL LIKE I OUTED HIM IN
[000:25:44;009] A WAY.
[000:25:48;914] IT WAS MOMENTARY, BUT I STILL
[000:25:50;482] FELT THAT.
[000:25:53;018] >> THE OBITUARY HAD AN IMPACT
[000:25:54;986] IMMEDIATELY.
[000:25:56;354] STRANGERS, OTHER PARENTS WHO
[000:25:57;889] LOST KIDS TO ADDICTION CAME TO
[000:25:59;257] HIS FUNERAL TO SUPPORT AND THANK
[000:26:01;493] THE OSWALD FOR THEIR COURAGE.
[000:26:04;596] >> I WON'T STOP TALKING.
[000:26:06;031] IF I HAVE TO YELL I WILL.
[000:26:07;933] WHATEVER IT TAKES, I'M GOING TO
[000:26:11;770] KEEP MOVING THIS THING FORWARD.
[000:26:17;709] >> INCREDIBLE COURAGE FROM
[000:26:18;343] STEPHANIE.
[000:26:18;710] HIS OBITUARY ALSO INCLUDED A
[000:26:19;411] REMINDER THAT ADDICTION DOES NOT
[000:26:20;679] DISCRIMINATE.
[000:26:23;148] SHE REMEMBERS HER SON'S BIG
[000:26:23;815] HEART AND LOVE OF MUSIC.
[000:26:26;451] A TOUGH DAY FOR STEPHANIE, NO
[000:26:27;619] DOUBT.
[000:26:28;453] LAURA: THANK YOU FOR SHARING
[000:26:30;488] THAT VERY IMPORTANT STORY.
[000:26:35;260] THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

[000:26:37;195] NORTH KOREA AFTER THE LATEST
[000:26:38;697] MISSILE TEST.
[000:26:41;232] OUR SANCTIONS THE RIGHT PATH TO

[000:26:43;535] PLUS, THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY
[000:26:45;503] REIGNITING DEMOCRATIC CALLS FOR
[000:26:47;205] AN INDEPENDENT PROSECUTOR.
[000:26:50;408] MOST REPUBLICANS ARE REFUSING TO
[000:26:52;277] BUDGE.
[000:26:53;211] WHAT ABOUT POLITICAL STANDOFF
[000:26:55;513] AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR BOTH
[000:26:58;149] PARTIES.
[000:27:01;620] >> THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO
[000:27:03;989] INDICATE THEY ARE AFRAID OF
[000:27:05;357] WHERE THE INVESTIGATION MAY
[000:27:08;026] LEAD.
[000:27:08;660] >> THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE
[000:27:10;829] WANTS THE INVESTIGATION TO GO
[000:27:12;931] FORWARD
[000:27:41;559] I love how USAA gives me

[000:31:27;352] WEEKEND.
[000:31:27;986] THE PRESIDENT SAID A DECISION

[000:32:42;527] STAYING ON MESSAGE THING.
[000:32:43;294] WE HEAR THIS ADVICE FROM GATES
[000:32:44;062] BUT AS WE'VE SEEN FROM TIME TO
[000:32:44;762] TIME, THE PRESIDENT HAS A
[000:32:46;831] TENDENCY TO GO OFF SCRIPT.
[000:32:48;132] LET'S ASSUME HE DOES STICK TO
[000:32:48;833] THE TALKING POINTS.
[000:32:51;235] DOUG, WHAT DOES HE NEED TO PROVE
[000:32:51;970] AND HOW DOES HE DO THAT.
[000:32:53;838] >> HE NEEDS TO PROVE HE IS AN
[000:32:56;641] AUTHENTIC AND SERIOUS
[000:32:58;876] REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED
[000:33:01;212] STATES AND OUR POSITIONS, THAT
[000:33:05;350] HE CAN ARTICULATE OUR POSITION
[000:33:06;050] IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH THE
[000:33:06;718] SAUDI'S AND THE ISRAELIS WHO ARE
[000:33:07;452] WORKING TOGETHER, HE CAN
[000:33:08;953] ARTICULATE IN EUROPE OUR
[000:33:11;789] POSITION WITH THE G-7 AND NATO
[000:33:15;493] AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS

[000:33:40;151] FOREIGN-POLICY, HE HAS DONE VERY
[000:33:40;885] WELL.
[000:33:41;185] THE ONLY TIME THAT WAS A CONCERN
[000:33:42;253] WAS RIGHT AFTER HE WAS ELECTED
[000:33:43;187] WHERE HE HAD THE CALL WITH
[000:33:43;821] TAIWAN WHICH GREATLY INFURIATED
[000:33:45;790] THE CHINESE.
[000:33:46;791] WHEN HE HAS TO AVOID IS DOING
[000:33:47;692] SOMETHING THAT CAN GIVE
[000:33:50;128] PERCEPTION TO ANOTHER COUNTRY OR
[000:33:51;896] ALLY THAT HE IS SMEARING THEM OR
[000:33:54;165] UPSETTING THEM.
[000:33:56;034] LAURA: CALL IS SO IMPORTANT WITH
[000:34:02;340] ALL THIS.
[000:34:02;974] DOUG, TAKING A LOOK AT THE LAST
[000:34:03;708] TWO PRESIDENTS ON THEIR FIRST
[000:34:04;776] FOREIGN TRIP, PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:34:07;445] WENT TO CANADA IN 2009 AND
[000:34:08;112] GEORGE W. BUSH TOOK HIS FIRST
[000:34:10;415] FOREIGN TRIP TO MEXICO IN
[000:34:12;517] FEBRUARY 2001.
[000:34:15;653] IT TOOK A FEW EXTRA MONTHS BUT
[000:34:16;354] THE PRESIDENT IS JUMPING IN,
[000:34:17;655] GOING OVERSEAS.
[000:34:18;122] GOOD MOVE?
[000:34:19;791] BAD MOVE?
[000:34:24;462] >> I THINK IT'S TH
[000:34:27;732] THERE IS A NEW AND EMERGING
[000:34:28;399] ALLIANCE BETWEEN ISRAEL, SAUDI
[000:34:30;768] AND THE EGYPTIANS AND THAT'S
[000:34:33;638] IMPORTANT, AND FOR NATO WHICH
[000:34:36;908] THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED
[000:34:38;376] OBSOLETE AND REVERSED HIMSELF,
[000:34:40;611] HE HAS TO REASSURE THEM TO MAKE
[000:34:42;046] IT CLEAR HE WILL STAND UP
[000:34:44;449] AGAINST RUSSIA AGGRESSION WHICH
[000:34:47;752] IS STRONG IN THE BALKANS AND
[000:34:49;887] EVER PRESENT IN COUNTRIES LIKE
[000:34:53;591] ESTONIA, LITHUANIA AND LATVIA.
[000:34:56;561] >> HE IS JUMPING RIGHT IN GOING
[000:34:57;295] OVERSEAS.
[000:34:58;729] THIS IS A BIG TRIP.
[000:35:00;665] >> HE HAS ALREADY ASSUAGED THE
[000:35:02;133] NATO ALLIES WHEN HE MET WITH THE
[000:35:04;635] SECRETARY GENERAL AT THE WHITE
[000:35:05;636] HOUSE AND SAID WE ARE HERE AND
[000:35:07;705] WE ARE A MEMBER AND WE WANT TO
[000:35:09;373] BE WITH YOU ON THIS.
[000:35:10;875] I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
[000:35:12;176] IN ADDITION TO SOLVING THE
[000:35:13;611] PALESTINE CONFLICT IS THE G-7
[000:35:17;448] AND NATO MEETINGS.
[000:35:19;117] WITH NORTH KOREA'S AGGRESSION,
[000:35:19;851] WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF OUR
[000:35:20;852] ALLIES ON THE SAME PAGE
[000:35:22;653] ENCOUNTERING NORTH KOREA AND
[000:35:27;291] STOPPING THEM FROM BAD BEHAVIOR
[000:35:28;025] WHICH IS ENDANGERING ASIA AND
[000:35:29;694] THE REST OF THE WORLD.
[000:35:30;394] LAURA: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE
[000:35:32;330] BEEN LOOKING AT WITH VISITING
[000:35:35;933] POPE FRANCIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:35:38;069] TRIP AND POPE FRANCIS VIEWS.
[000:35:54;218] >> I THINK THIS IS A WORK IN
[000:35:54;886] PROGRESS.
[000:35:55;253] THE PRESIDENT AND THE POPE
[000:35:55;887] COULDN'T HAVE TWO MORE DIVERGENT
[000:35:56;621] VIEWS.
[000:35:56;921] THAT BEING SAID, FOR THE
[000:35:57;522] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[000:35:58;222] NOT TO HAVE A HARMONIOUS
[000:35:59;590] RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POPE.
[000:36:01;626] [INAUDIBLE]
[000:36:03;761] >> WE CAN'T ENVISION THE BEING
[000:36:04;896] COMBATIVE.
[000:36:07;031] IT WILL BE A DECENT VISIT.
[000:36:10;101] >> I THINK THE PRESIDENT, ONE OF
[000:36:10;835] HIS STRENGTHS, WHEN HE IS
[000:36:12;670] ONE-ON-ONE WITH SOMEONE IN A
[000:36:13;971] ROOM, HE IS MUCH BETTER THAN HE
[000:36:17;108] IS IN A CROWD.
[000:36:19;844] I THINK POPE FRANCIS, THE TWO OF
[000:36:20;578] THEM KNOW THEY WILL DISAGREE BUT
[000:36:21;312] I THINK THEY WILL FIND COMMON
[000:36:22;013] GROUND.
[000:36:22;346] I THINK THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER
[000:36:24;382] AND HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE
[000:36:25;850] SO THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER IN THE
[000:36:26;584] FUTURE TO TACKLE THE MAJOR
[000:36:28;786] PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD AND HAVE
[000:36:30;488] AN EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIP.
[000:36:31;989] LAURA: THIS VISIT KICKS OFF ON
[000:36:33;991] FRIDAY.
[000:36:36;827] I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRING
[000:36:37;562] OF JAMES COMEY AND THE FBI.
[000:36:38;529] THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
[000:36:39;130] COMPARISON TO NIXON AND
[000:36:39;730] WATERGATE.
[000:36:41;432] WE WANT TO BRING IN BOB FROM FOX
[000:36:45;169] NEWS SUNDAY TALKING ABOUT THAT.
[000:36:49;040] >> THIS IS NOT WATERGATE.
[000:36:51;108] THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
[000:36:55;012] PRESIDENT TRUMP, AT THIS POINT
[000:36:55;713] WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN
[000:36:56;314] COLLUSION.
[000:36:57;915] IN THE CASE OF NIXON, HE HAD HIS
[000:37:02;286] FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, JOHN
[000:37:07;091] DEAN, TESTIFY FOR FOUR DAYS THAT
[000:37:08;492] THE PRESIDENT CORRUPTLY AND
[000:37:10;795] ILLEGALLY LED THE OBSTRUCTION OF
[000:37:11;529] JUSTICE.
[000:37:13;464] YOU HAVE NOTHING COMPARABLE.
[000:37:16;801] LAURA: DOUG, DO YOU AGREE?
[000:37:19;270] >> I THINK WITH THE EARLY STAGES
[000:37:22;607] OF THE RUSSIA, TRUMP POTENTIAL
[000:37:27;311] COLLUSION ISSUE, THERE ARE LOTS
[000:37:35;553] OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT GENERAL
[000:37:36;287] FLYNN DID OR DIDN'T DO, WHO PAUL
[000:37:37;021] MANAFORT WAS WORKING WITH.
[000:37:37;655] WE JUST DON'T KNOW.
[000:37:39;390] THE REASON I THINK THE FIRING OF
[000:37:41;592] JAMES COMEY WAS SO UNFORTUNATE,
[000:37:42;860] WE WERE BEGINNING THE
[000:37:44;195] INVESTIGATION.
[000:37:49;934] MORE FUNDS WERE REQUESTED,
[000:37:50;568] SUBPOENAS HAD GONE OUT FOR
[000:37:51;202] GENERAL FLYNN'S PAPERS.
[000:37:51;802] I THINK IT IS A MUCH EARLIER
[000:37:53;170] STAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAN
[000:37:54;572] THE POINT WOODWARD WAS TALKING
[000:37:57;875] ABOUT WITH WATERGATE.
[000:37:59;577] TIME WILL TELL, LAURA.
[000:38:06;017] LAURA: EVAN, HOW DO YOU SEE IT?
[000:38:06;751] THIS IS A BIG POINT PEOPLE ARE
[000:38:07;652] MAKING AND GOING BACK IN TIME TO
[000:38:08;386] MAKE THIS COMPARISON.
[000:38:10;054] >> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING
[000:38:11;889] THE COMPARISON.
[000:38:12;356] I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR AT THIS
[000:38:13;090] POINT.
[000:38:13;891] IT'S WAY TOO EARLY IN THE GAME.
[000:38:15;393] LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.
[000:38:18;329] THE PRESIDENT IS, AS JAMES COMEY
[000:38:23;334] ADMITTED ON WEDNESDAY, WITHIN
[000:38:24;035] HIS RIGHT TO FIRE THE FBI
[000:38:26;871] DIRECTOR AT ANY POINT IN TIME.
[000:38:37;114] THE SUBSEQUENT MESSAGE FROM THE
[000:38:37;848] WHITE HOUSE HAS GOTTEN THE
[000:38:38;482] PRESIDENT INTO HOT WATER BECAUSE
[000:38:39;216] ON TUESDAY NIGHT HIS AIDES WENT
[000:38:39;950] ON TV AND SAID IT'S TIME FOR THE
[000:38:40;685] RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION TO STOP
[000:38:41;385] AND ON THURSDAY, HE SAID THE
[000:38:42;053] RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION PLAYED A
[000:38:42;753] PART IN THAT.
[000:38:44;088] NOW, IF THE PRESIDENT, I DON'T
[000:38:45;690] SEE ANYTHING HAPPENING TO THE
[000:38:48;726] PRESIDENT FOR SAYING THAT.
[000:38:52;129] HOWEVER, IF JAMES COMEY WERE TO
[000:38:52;863] GO OUT AND SAY YES, THE
[000:38:55;766] PRESIDENT TRIED TO OBSTRUCT
[000:38:57;435] JUSTICE AND INTERFERE, THAT'S A
[000:38:58;169] MAJOR PROBLEM.
[000:38:58;602] AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO
[000:39:00;237] SEEING REPUBLICANS AND THE
[000:39:05;076] COUNTRY AS A WHOLE SHOWS VERY
[000:39:09;280] LITTLE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO
[000:39:12;316] THIS IN COMPARISON.
[000:39:13;451] LAURA: THE MILLION-DOLLAR
[000:39:16;087] QUESTION, HE IS GOING TO PICK A
[000:39:18;389] NEW PERSON.
[000:39:20;024] WHAT KIND OF PERSON SHOULD HE
[000:39:20;725] PICK?
[000:39:21;892] WHO WILL HEAT PICK?
[000:39:24;562] >> TWO VERY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
[000:39:29;734] I THINK HE SHOULD PICK SOMEONE
[000:39:30;534] OF INDEPENDENCE, NO TIES TO
[000:39:31;202] POLITICS, SOMEONE LIKE RAY
[000:39:32;737] KELLY, MIKE LEE OF UTAH
[000:39:37;074] SUGGESTED MERRICK GARLAND, THE
[000:39:39;310] JUDGE NOMINATED BY THE DEMOCRA
[000:39:40;644] DEMOCRATS, SOME OF THE LIKE THAT
[000:39:41;379] WOULD BE IDEAL.
[000:39:43;414] MY PREDICTION HE WILL PICK JOHN
[000:39:45;716] CORNYN, THE TEXAS SENATOR WHO
[000:39:46;717] HAS BEEN A LOYAL DEFENDER OF
[000:39:47;551] PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGH THE
[000:39:49;353] WHOLE INVESTIGATION.
[000:39:53;457] >> DOUG JUST BIT ON THE MERRICK
[000:39:54;892] HARLAND BAIT BECAUSE AS
[000:39:58;262] REPUBLICANS WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY
[000:40:00;965] SUPPORT THAT.
[000:40:01;732] THE PRESIDENT WANTS SOMEONE WHO
[000:40:03;634] CAN PASS 100 - 0.
[000:40:08;272] THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING
[000:40:08;873] MENTIONED ARE ALL VERY QUALIFIED
[000:40:09;607] AND CAPABLE.
[000:40:11;075] I AGREE WITH DOUG THAT JOHN
[000:40:16;247] CORNYN WOULD BE A FANTASTIC
[000:40:16;914] PICK.
[000:40:17;214] HE HAS THE RESPECT OF THE SENATE
[000:40:18;048] ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND
[000:40:18;749] HE UNDERSTANDS LAW-ENFORCEMENT
[000:40:19;450] AS WELL AS HOW TO WORK WITH
[000:40:21;152] CAPITOL HILL AND OTHERS.
[000:40:22;186] LAURA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
[000:40:22;853] BEING HERE.
[000:40:23;287] ALWAYS INTERESTING.
[000:40:25;589] IT WILL BE A VERY BIG WEEK.
[000:40:29;827] WE WANT TO REMIND YOU TO TURN IN
[000:40:30;928] LATER FOR JUDGE JEANINE'S
[000:40:33;130] CONVERSATION WITH TRUMP WHERE HE
[000:40:34;932] ADDRESSES HIS REMARKS ABOUT
[000:40:44;008] ENDING LIVE WHITE HOUSE PRESS
[000:40:44;708] BRIEFINGS.
[000:40:45;142] >> WHEN WE HAVE THOSE PRESS
[000:40:45;810] CONFERENCES, I ACTUALLY SAID WE
[000:40:46;544] SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE
[000:40:47;878] SARAH HUCKABEE --
[000:40:50;481] >> FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WE BEEN
[000:40:51;182] DOING THEM.
[000:40:51;649] >> BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ACTION
[000:40:52;383] LIKE THIS.
[000:40:52;750] THIS IS CRAZY.
[000:40:54;251] THERE ARE HIGHER RATINGS ON
[000:40:56;554] THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES --
[000:41:00;257] >> WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
[000:41:00;991] STOPPING THOSE PRESS
[000:41:01;525] CONFERENCES.
[000:41:01;992] >> WE WOULD DO IT IN A DIFFERENT
[000:41:02;726] WAY.
[000:41:03;127] A PIECE OF TAPE OR WITH A
[000:41:05;830] PERFECTLY ACCURATE BEAUTIFUL
[000:41:07;832] ANSWER.
[000:41:12;436] >> IN WRITING?
[000:41:13;037] >> THEY ARE ASKED A HUNDRED
[000:41:13;704] QUESTIONS OR 50 QUESTIONS OR 20
[000:41:14;438] QUESTIONS.
[000:41:15;873] IF THEY GET ONE OUT OF 50 AND
[000:41:21;212] IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF, FIVE
[000:41:21;946] OR 10%, THE NEXT DAY IT'S A
[000:41:23;013] FRONT-PAGE STORY IN EVERY
[000:41:25;049] NEWSPAPER.
[000:41:26;650] PRESS CONFERENCES WEREN'T EVEN
[000:41:27;351] COVERED FOR OBAMA.
[000:41:27;852] THEY WERE ON C-SPAN AND C-SPAN
[000:41:29;887] TO AND THERE WAS NOTHING GOING
[000:41:31;856] ON.
[000:41:34;325] THESE PRESS CONFERENCES LIKE THE
[000:41:37;695] THING ON DAYTIME TELEVISION.
[000:41:39;630] THEY'RE BLOWING AWAY EVERYTHING
[000:41:41;532] ON DAYTIME TELEVISION.
[000:41:45;236] WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO IS STOP
[000:41:47;438] THEM.

[000:41:51;275] CONVERSATION ON JUSTICE WITH

[000:44:40;444] to let the real you
[000:44:40;444] shine through?
[000:44:44;114] Introducing Otezla, apremilast.
[000:44:46;784] Otezla is not an injection
[000:44:48;352] or a cream.
[000:44:49;953] It's a pill that treats
[000:44:49;953] plaque psoriasis differently.
[000:44:52;389] Some people who took Otezla
[000:44:54;024] saw 75% clearer skin

[000:44:59;096] has no requirement for
[000:44:59;096] routine lab monitoring.
[000:45:01;732] Don't take Otezla
[000:45:01;732] if you are allergic
[000:45:03;667] to any of its ingredients.
[000:45:05;135] Otezla may increase
[000:45:05;135] the risk of depression.
[000:45:07;404] Tell your doctor
[000:45:07;404] if you have a history
[000:45:08;872] of depression
[000:45:08;872] or suicidal thoughts,
[000:45:10;674] or if these feelings develop.
[000:45:12;509] Some people taking Otezla
[000:45:12;509] reported weight loss.
[000:45:15;179] Your doctor should
[000:45:15;179] monitor your weight
[000:45:16;547] and may stop treatment.
[000:45:18;148] Side effects
[000:45:18;148] may include

[000:49:08;912] MOVING FORWARD ON PLANS TO BUILD
[000:49:12;349] THE BORDER WALL AND PROGRESS IS
[000:49:14;751] ABOUT TO TAKE A BIG STEP.
[000:49:17;321] >> DO NOT WORRY, WE ARE GOING TO
[000:49:19;389] BUILD THE WALL.
[000:49:20;123] DON'T WORRY.
[000:49:22;292] DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT
[000:49:22;292] per roll
[000:49:32;836] More "Doing Chores For Dad"
[000:49:32;836] per roll
[000:49:39;176] More "Earning Something
[000:49:39;176] You Love" per roll
[000:49:42;446] Bounty is more absorbent,
[000:49:44;181] so the roll can last 50% longer
[000:49:44;181] than the leading ordinary brand.
[000:49:48;118] So you get more "Life" per roll.
[000:49:50;988] Bounty, the Quicker Picker Upper
[000:52:48;248] LAURA: THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL
[000:52:48;882] IMMIGRANTS INTO THE U.S. HAS
[000:52:49;549] DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.
[000:52:50;116] THAT IS NOT STOPPING PRESIDENT
[000:52:50;817] TRUMP FROM PUSHING AHEAD WITH
[000:52:52;185] HIS SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISES,
[000:52:55;388] BUILDING A BORDER WALL.
[000:52:56;489] CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WILL SOON
[000:52:57;924] BE ANNOUNCED.
[000:53:01;127] WILL CAR JOINS US WITH MORE FROM
[000:53:01;862] L.A.
[000:53:04;064] WHERE DO THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW?
[000:53:15;876] >> IT APPEARS IT IS ONE STEP
[000:53:16;543] CLOSER TO REALITY.
[000:53:17;043] THERE IS STILL A BIG QUESTION,
[000:53:17;744] WHO WILL FOOT THE BILL THAT
[000:53:18;411] COULD RANGE FROM
[000:53:18;879] 20 - $70 BILLION.
[000:53:19;646] LAST NIGHT JUDGE JEANINE ASKED
[000:53:26;253] PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT HIS PLANS.
[000:53:26;987] LISTEN TO HIS RESPONSE.
[000:53:27;654] >> ARE YOU WANT TO BUILD THE
[000:53:28;321] WALL.
[000:53:28;688] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:53:29;122] IS THERE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
[000:53:30;123] THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
[000:53:33;660] >> MORE THAN 600 COMPANIES
[000:53:34;327] SIGNED UP TO DESIGN THE WALL.
[000:53:35;629] THE FINALISTS, WHICH WILL BE
[000:53:37;063] ANNOUNCED SOON, WILL BUILD
[000:53:39;232] PROTOTYPES NEAR THE BORDER IN
[000:53:39;933] SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
[000:53:41;768] ONE COMPANY IS DARTH HOLS PULSE
[000:53:50;710] TECHNOLOGY.
[000:53:51;244] IT WILL HAVE CONNECTION FIBERS
[000:53:51;945] BUILT IN AND UNDERNEATH.
[000:53:54;748] >> WHERE WE CAN'T GET A WALL
[000:53:56;883] BUILT DUE TO A TRAIN OR
[000:53:58;852] ENVIRONMENTAL REASON, I THINK
[000:53:59;986] HAVING SOME SORT OF CENTER IS
[000:54:02;188] PART OF THAT PROCESS.
[000:54:07;193] >> COOL TECHNOLOGY, BUT AGAIN IT
[000:54:07;928] WILL COME WITH A PRICE.
[000:54:08;728] YOU REMEMBER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
[000:54:10;230] MAINTAINED MEXICO WILL PAY FOR
[000:54:12;766] THE WALL, BUT THE NEIGHBOR TO
[000:54:13;566] THE SOUTH CONTINUES TO SAY THAT
[000:54:17;904] IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE
[000:54:20;373] MENTIONED AT THE TOP THAT BORDER
[000:54:21;107] CROSSINGS ARE DOWN.
[000:54:22;309] DO WE KNOW WHY?
[000:54:24;344] >> BORDER AUTHORITIES ATTRIBUTE
[000:54:33;553] THE DROP TO THE SUPPORT THEY ARE
[000:54:34;287] RECEIVING FROM THE TRUMP
[000:54:34;888] ADMINISTRATION AND NEWS COVERAGE
[000:54:35;622] OF IMMIGRATION BUS ACROSS THE
[000:54:36;323] COUNTRY.
[000:54:36;656] WHEN YOU ADDED UP, THE NUMBERS
[000:54:37;691] HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.
[000:54:39;092] >> BACK IN OCTOBER, NOVEMBER,
[000:54:41;528] DECEMBER WE HAD BETWEEN
[000:54:43;530] 750 - 900 PEOPLE A DAY.
[000:54:48;568] NOW WE ARE AVERAGING 150, 145 ON
[000:54:50;704] A DAILY BASIS.
[000:54:55;275] THAT FREES UP BORDER DETENTION
[000:54:57;210] CENTERS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HOLD
[000:55:05;585] THEM FOR COURT DOWN THE LINE
[000:55:07;687] WHICH NORMALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN.
[000:55:09;589] LAURA: THANK YOU.

[000:55:14;127] TOO OLD TO PURSUE YOUR DREAM AND
