[000:00:00;300] I CAN'T SING IT.

[000:00:01;801] TUCKER, GOD BLESS YOU.
[000:00:03;470] HAVE FUN ON YOUR NEXT ADVENTURE
[000:00:06;272] IN YOUR JOURNEY.

[000:00:15;281] RESCUE KIDS.
[000:00:15;982] SHEP?
[000:00:16;282] >> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE
[000:00:17;050] WEST COAST, 3:00 IN THE EAST I
[000:00:20;587] AND 2:00 P.M. IN MEXICO CITY.
[000:00:28;028] TEAMS SAY THEY HAVE SPOKEN WITH
[000:00:29;929] ONE GIRL TRAPPED BENEATH A
[000:00:32;432] BUILDING.
[000:00:32;799] SHE TOLD THEM THERE'S MORE
[000:00:34;634] SURVIVORS WITH HER.
[000:00:35;635] NOW WITH THE WRECKAGE SHIFTING
[000:00:37;771] AND GROANING AND MORE AFTER
[000:00:40;006] SHOCKS POSSIBLE, CREWS ARE
[000:00:41;674] RISKING THEIR LIVES TO TRY TO
[000:00:43;343] GET THOSE KIDS TO SAFETY.
[000:00:45;678] HURRICANE MARIA ROARING ACROSS
[000:00:47;881] THE CARIBBEAN NOW LEAVING BEHIND
[000:00:53;253] ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION.
[000:00:53;820] MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN PUERTO
[000:00:54;621] RICO NOW GETTING AN IDEA OF JUST
[000:00:56;122] HOW MUCH THEY LOST WHEN THE
[000:00:57;957] STORM SCOURED THEIR ISLAND.
[000:00:59;826] WINDS SO POWERFUL, THEY RIPPED
[000:01:02;495] CONCRETE BALCONIES OFF OF WALLS
[000:01:05;265] AND NOW MARIA HEADED FOR THE
[000:01:08;501] TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE
[000:01:09;302] BAHAMAS.
[000:01:09;669] PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCING BOLD
[000:01:12;172] NEW MEASURES TARGETING THE
[000:01:14;507] NUCLEAR NATION OF NORTH KOREA.
[000:01:16;576] HE SAYS THEY'RE AIMED AT CUTTING
[000:01:18;278] OFF CASH TO KIM JONG-UN AND HIS
[000:01:20;613] WEAPONS PROGRAM.
[000:01:21;281] MORE DETAILS EXPECTED IN A LIVE
[000:01:23;550] EVENT IN JUST MOMENTS.
[000:01:26;186] SO LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:32;525] BREAKING NEWS THIS HOUR.
[000:01:34;027] FIRST, THE TREASURY SECRETARY
[000:01:35;695] STEVE MNUCHIN ABOUT TO BRIEF
[000:01:37;430] REPORTERS ON THE TRUMP
[000:01:38;531] ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST MOVE TO
[000:01:39;799] CUT OFF NORTH KOREA'S CASH FLOW.
[000:01:41;468] PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCING HIS
[000:01:43;002] NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER HOURS AGO.
[000:01:47;907] IT GIVES THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
[000:01:48;675] MORE POWER TO GO AFTER PEOPLE
[000:01:49;509] THAT DO BUSINESS WITH KIM
[000:01:50;910] JONG-UN'S GOVERNMENT.
[000:01:51;511] THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT WILL LEAVE
[000:01:52;512] THE DICTATOR WITH LESS MONEY FOR
[000:01:55;081] HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
[000:01:56;549] >> NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS
[000:01:58;518] AND MISSILE DEVELOPMENT IS A
[000:02:01;588] GRAVE THREAT TO PEACE AND
[000:02:04;190] SECURITY IN OUR WORLD AND IT IS
[000:02:06;593] UNACCEPTABLE THAT OTHERS
[000:02:09;295] FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THIS
[000:02:11;865] CRIMINAL ROGUE REGIME.
[000:02:15;835] OUR NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL CUT
[000:02:17;537] OFF SOURCES OF REVENUE THAT FUND
[000:02:22;342] NORTH KOREA'S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP
[000:02:23;476] THE DEADLIEST WEAPONS TO HUMAN
[000:02:27;714] KIND.
[000:02:28;014] >> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT MAKING
[000:02:29;916] THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITH THE
[000:02:32;252] LEADERS OF SOUTH KOREA AND
[000:02:33;920] JAPAN.
[000:02:34;220] THE PRESIDENT HELD SEPARATE
[000:02:36;222] MEETINGS WITH EACH LEADER.
[000:02:37;457] PRESIDENT TRUMP PRAISING CHINA
[000:02:42;295] FOR REPORTEDLY TELLING ITS BANKS
[000:02:43;062] TO STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH
[000:02:43;763] NORTH KOREA.
[000:02:44;164] THE REUTERS NEWS AGENCY SAID
[000:02:45;899] THAT MESSAGE CAME FROM CHINA'S
[000:02:48;001] CENTRAL BANK, WHICH MAKES IT
[000:02:49;969] SIGNIFICANT.
[000:02:50;603] ANALYSTS SAY IT WOULD BE A MAJOR
[000:02:52;505] BLOW TO NORTH KOREA BECAUSE
[000:02:53;640] CHINA IS ITS CLOSEST ALLY.
[000:02:56;009] THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO COMES
[000:02:57;210] JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER
[000:02:58;411] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST SPEECH
[000:02:59;946] TO THE U.N.
[000:03:01;347] THE PRESIDENT SAID THE UNITED
[000:03:03;116] STATES WOULD TOTALLY DESTROY
[000:03:04;817] NORTH KOREA IF IT HAD TO, BUT
[000:03:07;086] HOPEFULLY HE SAID IT WON'T BE
[000:03:09;622] NECESSARY.
[000:03:10;223] PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID KIM
[000:03:11;658] JONG-UN OR ROCKETMAN, AS HE
[000:03:14;561] CALLS HIM THESE DAYS IS ON A
[000:03:17;463] SUICIDE ANYTHING.
[000:03:18;264] NOW NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN
[000:03:20;033] MINISTER HAS SPOKEN BACK.
[000:03:21;434] >> IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD
[000:03:22;869] SCARE US WITH A SOUND OF A DOG
[000:03:25;638] BARKING, IT'S A SILLY DREAM.
[000:03:27;106] >> Shepard: SOUND OF A DOG
[000:03:28;708] BARKING.
[000:03:29;075] THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS HE
[000:03:31;177] PITY'S PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:03:36;249] ADVISERS.
[000:03:36;616] DESPITE THE RHETORIC, PRESIDENT
[000:03:37;417] TRUMP DID NOT RULE OUT TALKING
[000:03:38;184] WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.
[000:03:39;018] >> MR. PRESIDENT, IS DIALOGUE
[000:03:42;121] STILL POSSIBLE WITH NORTH KOREA?
[000:03:50;096] >> Shepard: BREAKING RIGHT NOW,
[000:03:51;698] THE TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE
[000:03:53;233] MNUCHIN IS TALKING ABOUT THE NEW
[000:03:55;435] ORDER.
[000:03:55;735] LET'S LISTEN LIVE FROM NEW YORK
[000:03:57;637] CITY.
[000:03:57;937] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEW
[000:03:59;372] EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNIFICANTLY
[000:04:00;873] EXPANDS TREASURIES, AUTHORITIES
[000:04:02;976] TO TARGET THOSE WHO ENABLE THIS
[000:04:06;012] REGIME'S ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
[000:04:08;548] WHEREVER THEY ARE LOCATED.
[000:04:10;917] FOR TOO LONG, NORTH KOREA HAS
[000:04:12;919] EVADED SANCTIONS AND USED THE
[000:04:16;589] INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
[000:04:17;357] TO FACILITATE FUNDING FOR
[000:04:20;593] WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND
[000:04:23;263] BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS.
[000:04:24;330] NO BANK IN ANY COUNTRY SHOULD BE
[000:04:29;135] USED TO FACILITATE KIM JONG-UN'S
[000:04:29;902] DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.
[000:04:30;970] THIS NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL
[000:04:32;605] AUTHORIZE TREASURY TO IMPOSE A
[000:04:35;341] RANGE OF SANCTIONS LIKE
[000:04:38;244] SUSPENDING U.S. CORRESPONDENT
[000:04:39;746] ACCOUNT ACCESS TO ANY FOREIGN
[000:04:41;814] BANK THAT KNOWINGLY CONDUCTS OR
[000:04:45;618] FACILITATES SIGNIFICANT
[000:04:47;553] TRANSACTIONS TIED TO TRADE WITH
[000:04:49;689] NORTH KOREA.
[000:04:50;323] THESE SANCTIONS WILL BE
[000:04:52;392] FORWARD-LOOKING AND APPLIED TO
[000:04:53;993] BEHAVIOR THAT OCCURS FOLLOWING
[000:04:57;263] TODAY WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:04:59;499] SIGNED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.
[000:05:00;800] FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
[000:05:02;535] ARE NOW ON NOTICE THAT GOING
[000:05:05;171] FORWARD, THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO
[000:05:08;141] BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES
[000:05:09;676] OR WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT NOT
[000:05:12;845] BOTH.
[000:05:13;579] THIS NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER ENABLES
[000:05:15;515] TREASURY TO FREEZE ASSETS OF
[000:05:17;950] ANYONE CONDUCTING SIGNIFICANT
[000:05:20;420] TRADE IN GOODS, SERVICES OR
[000:05:26;259] TECHNOLOGY WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:05:26;959] IT ALSO ALLOWS TO US FREEZE
[000:05:27;727] ASSETS OF ACTORS SUPPORTING
[000:05:32;832] NORTH KOREA'S TEXTILE, FISHING,
[000:05:34;901] AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES.
[000:05:36;602] WE CALL ON ALL COUNTRIES AROUND
[000:05:38;438] THE WORLD TO JOIN US BY CUTTING
[000:05:40;940] OFF ALL TRIED AND FINANCIAL TIES
[000:05:42;742] TO NORTH KOREA IN ORDER TO
[000:05:45;511] ACHIEVE A DE-NUCLEARIZED KOREAN
[000:05:48;948] PENINSULA.
[000:05:49;349] AS PRESIDENT TRUMP STATED IN HIS
[000:05:54;120] SPEECH TO THE U.N., IT'S TIME
[000:05:57;323] FOR ALL NATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER
[000:06:00;126] TO ISOLATE KIM JONG-UN'S REGIME
[000:06:01;961] UNTIL IT CEASES ITS HOSTILE
[000:06:04;163] BEHAVIOR.
[000:06:04;530] WE WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES AND
[000:06:07;734] PARTNERS TO STOP FROM USING THE
[000:06:09;836] GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO
[000:06:10;536] FURTHER KIM'S RECKLESS BEHAVIOR.
[000:06:12;438] THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO
[000:06:15;775] TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS.
[000:06:20;613] >> CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS WILL
[000:06:21;414] AFFECT -- WHAT KIND OF
[000:06:24;884] DISCUSSIONS YOU AND YOUR COUNTER
[000:06:26;119] PARTS HAVE HAD ABOUT THIS?
[000:06:27;353] >> LET ME COMMENT.
[000:06:28;554] I HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE
[000:06:30;990] CONVERSATION EARLY THIS MORNING
[000:06:33;126] WITH GOVERNOR JOE AT THE PBOC,
[000:06:35;561] THE PEOPLE'S BANK OF CHINA AND
[000:06:38;631] HOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK
[000:06:40;400] TOGETHER.
[000:06:41;634] THIS ACTION IS DIRECTED AT
[000:06:45;004] EVERYONE.
[000:06:45;371] IT'S IN NO WAY DIRECTED AT
[000:06:49;275] CHINA.
[000:06:49;575] WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
[000:06:51;744] CLOSELY WITH THEM.
[000:06:52;412] >> MR. SECRETARY, CAN I READ A
[000:06:55;014] QUICK SECTION OF THE E.O.?
[000:06:57;016] NO AIRCRAFT IN WHICH A FOREIGN
[000:06:58;718] PERSON HAS AN INTERESTED HAS
[000:07:00;286] LANDED AT A PLACE IN NORTH
[000:07:01;621] KOREA, MAY LAND IN THE UNITED
[000:07:04;190] STATES AFTER DEPARTURE FROM
[000:07:05;758] NORTH KOREA.
[000:07:07;527] THEN SIMILAR APPLICATIONS TO
[000:07:13;266] SHIPS.
[000:07:13;566] ANY IDEA ON HOW MANY SHIPS OR
[000:07:14;801] AIRCRAFT WOULD BE HAVE BEEN
[000:07:16;469] AFFECTED IN PICK A YEAR?
[000:07:17;537] SO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF THE
[000:07:20;006] SCALE OF THE IMPACT.
[000:07:21;441] >> AGAIN, ANOTHER IMPORTANT
[000:07:23;009] ASPECT OF THE E.O. BESIDES FOR
[000:07:25;645] US BEING ABLE TO BLOCK FINANCIAL
[000:07:27;747] TRANSACTIONS.
[000:07:28;481] WE'LL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE
[000:07:29;782] COAST GUARD AND OTHERS ON THIS.
[000:07:31;551] I'M NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOU A
[000:07:34;620] NUMBER.
[000:07:34;954] IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT.
[000:07:36;489] FURTHER, WE CAN PUT ACTIONS
[000:07:39;292] AGAINST PORTS AS WELL.
[000:07:41;661] >> A COUPLE QUESTIONS.
[000:07:42;962] FIRST ONE, WHY WILL THIS ROUND
[000:07:44;630] OF SANCTIONS WORK WHEN OTHERS
[000:07:46;632] HAVE FAILED?
[000:07:47;099] >> AGAIN, LET ME BE CLEAR.
[000:07:48;968] I DON'T THINK OTHER SANCTIONS
[000:07:51;037] HAVE FAILED.
[000:07:51;704] THESE SANCTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT.
[000:07:53;840] NOT ONLY DOES IT ALLOW US TO
[000:07:56;309] SANCTION INDIVIDUALS OR
[000:07:57;810] ENTITIES, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO
[000:08:00;980] FREEZE OR BLOCK ANY TRANSACTIONS
[000:08:03;249] WITH ANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
[000:08:09;522] ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT
[000:08:10;223] FACILITATES ANY TRANSACTIONS
[000:08:10;957] WITH THE BLOCKED PERSON.
[000:08:12;258] >> DO THESE SANCTIONS INCLUDED A
[000:08:18;664] PLAN TO TARGET NORTH KOREAN
[000:08:20;199] BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD?
[000:08:21;767] >> YES, IT DOES.
[000:08:23;336] >> ANY FUTURE SANCTIONS?
[000:08:25;004] >> I WON'T COMMENT ON FUTURE
[000:08:28;007] SANCTIONS.
[000:08:28;508] WE'LL REVIEW ALL OPTIONS.
[000:08:29;976] >> DOES THIS REPRESENT A
[000:08:31;544] REJECTION OR A MOVING PATH TO
[000:08:33;045] THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL?
[000:08:34;447] >> NO, I DON'T THINK IN ANY WAY.
[000:08:36;549] WE APPRECIATE THE U.N. SECURITY
[000:08:40;019] COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND THE
[000:08:41;787] UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TO THAT.
[000:08:45;258] THIS GOES BEYOND IT.
[000:08:47;560] AS I'VE MENTIONED, THIS ALLOWS
[000:08:50;496] US TO BLOCK ANY FINANCIAL
[000:08:52;131] INSTITUTION THAT DOESN'T
[000:08:53;733] FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE U.N.
[000:09:07;213] SANCTIONS OR ADDITIONAL
[000:09:07;813] SANCTIONS.
[000:09:08;180] >> WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE
[000:09:08;948] DESIGNATIONS --
[000:09:09;415] >> WE'LL DO DESIGNATIONS ON A
[000:09:10;182] ROLLING BASIS.
[000:09:10;917] THIS STARTS TODAY.
[000:09:11;751] IT'S FORWARD LOOKING, NOT
[000:09:14;921] BACKWARDS LOOKING.
[000:09:16;055] >> CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT YOUR
[000:09:17;990] DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CENTRAL
[000:09:20;326] BANK OF CHINA?
[000:09:21;027] WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND --
[000:09:22;161] >> AGAIN, THOSE CONVERSATIONS
[000:09:24;830] ARE CONFIDENTIAL.
[000:09:26;299] AS I SAID, I HAD A VERY
[000:09:28;367] PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH
[000:09:29;936] THEM THIS MORNING.
[000:09:31;070] >> PIGGYBACKING ON THAT, THE
[000:09:34;941] TIMELINE, HAS THERE BEEN
[000:09:37;109] PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE
[000:09:38;844] BANK OF CHINA?
[000:09:40;012] >> NO, THERE WERE NO PREVIOUS
[000:09:42;481] DISCUSSIONS.
[000:09:42;915] THE FIRST TIME WE DISCUSSED IT
[000:09:44;383] WAS THIS MORNING.
[000:09:45;251] I CALLED THEM TO ALERT THEM OF
[000:09:47;620] THIS IN ADVANCE GIVEN THEIR
[000:09:48;854] CLOSE COOPERATION WITH US.
[000:09:52;024] >> THANK YOU.
[000:09:53;326] SO I WANT TO ASK PART OF THE
[000:09:58;764] SAME QUESTION.
[000:09:59;231] THAT CHINA HAD GIVEN SOME
[000:09:59;865] INDICATION 1 1/2 WEEKS AGO OF
[000:10:00;633] SOME ACTIONS.
[000:10:01;400] WHAT DID THEY TODAY IS SEPARATE
[000:10:02;902] FROM WHAT THEY INDICATED
[000:10:04;370] EARLIER --
[000:10:04;937] >> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE
[000:10:06;572] COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY DID
[000:10:08;574] EARLIER.
[000:10:08;941] WHAT THEY DID TODAY IS I ASSUME
[000:10:11;010] AS A RESULT OF OUR CONVERSATION.
[000:10:12;612] >> CAN I ASK --
[000:10:13;946] >> LET'S COME BACK TO YOU SO WE
[000:10:15;815] CAN GET OTHER PEOPLE.
[000:10:17;416] >> CAN YOU -- DO YOU BELIEVE
[000:10:19;885] THAT CHINA'S ACTIONS TODAY
[000:10:21;687] REDUCE THE NEED FOR FURTHER
[000:10:24;657] SECONDARY SANCTIONS ON CHINESE
[000:10:28;060] ENTITIES --
[000:10:28;494] >> I JUST COMMENTED WE LOOK
[000:10:30;329] FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS
[000:10:32;231] WELL AS ALL OF OUR PARTNERS.
[000:10:34;000] WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS
[000:10:35;735] THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES THE
[000:10:38;604] TREASURY HAS.
[000:10:42;041] >> CAN YOU PUT THIS IN THE
[000:10:43;542] CONTEXT OF THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:10:44;477] SPEECH EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN
[000:10:46;245] HE TALKED ABOUT MORE MILITARY
[000:10:59;225] ACTION?
[000:10:59;558] HOW DO THESE THINGS WORK
[000:11:00;226] TOGETHER AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
[000:11:00;960] NORTH KOREA TO DO IN RESPONSE?
[000:11:01;661] >> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON
[000:11:02;395] WHAT I EXPECT NORTH KOREA TO DO.
[000:11:03;129] OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THE
[000:11:03;863] OBJECTIVE, FOR THEM TO STOP
[000:11:04;530] THEIR MISSILE TESTS AND GIVE UP
[000:11:05;264] THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
[000:11:05;898] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN
[000:11:06;866] IN THE WORKS FOR A WHILE.
[000:11:09;368] I ALLUDED TO THIS ABOUT TWO
[000:11:11;037] WEEKS AGO, THAT I HAD BEEN
[000:11:12;972] DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE
[000:11:14;473] PRESIDENT AND THIS IS ALL PART
[000:11:15;508] OF THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY AT
[000:11:18;644] THE U.N. THIS WEEK.
[000:11:21;614] >> SECRETARY TILLERSON SAID IT
[000:11:22;915] TOOK AWHILE FOR THE LAST ROUND
[000:11:24;617] OF SANCTIONS TO HAVE AN IMPACT
[000:11:26;519] OR FOR NORTH KOREA TO BE ABLE TO
[000:11:28;120] FEEL THEM IS.
[000:11:28;788] THERE A TIMELINE THAT YOU'RE
[000:11:31;323] LOOKING AT IN WHICH CASE --
[000:11:32;591] >> AGAIN, THERE'S NO TIME LINE.
[000:11:34;794] THIS IS FORWARD ACTION ON THIS.
[000:11:37;463] AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE
[000:11:39;465] HOPE THAT THERE'S VOLUNTARY
[000:11:41;801] COOPERATION, BUT TO THE EXTENT
[000:11:43;069] THAT WE HAVE TO CUT OFF BANKS
[000:11:48;040] FROM THE BANKING SYSTEM IN THE
[000:11:48;808] UNITED STATES, WHICH OBVIOUSLY
[000:11:49;542] WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT, WE NOW
[000:11:50;609] HAVE THOSE TOOLS TO DO THAT.
[000:11:53;279] >> DO YOU RECALL ANY OTHER
[000:11:55;181] COUNTRIES, CENTRAL BANKS --
[000:11:56;649] >> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY
[000:11:58;284] COMMENTS ON CONFIDENTIAL
[000:12:00;252] DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER
[000:12:02;054] COUNTRIES.
[000:12:02;421] AGAIN, I'M CONFIRMING THAT I DID
[000:12:04;223] SPEAK TO THEM THIS MORNING.
[000:12:05;925] I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON
[000:12:08;060] OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE
[000:12:11;764] CONFIDENTIAL.
[000:12:15;468] >> THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THANKED
[000:12:20;039] PRESIDENT XI FOR HIS ACTIONS.
[000:12:21;841] DO YOU THINK THEY WERE ENOUGH?
[000:12:23;476] DID YOU CALL ON RUSSIA --
[000:12:24;810] >> AGAIN, WE'LL CALL ON RUSSIA
[000:12:26;946] TO DO MORE.
[000:12:28;914] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT XI
[000:12:30;816] HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE
[000:12:33;018] CONVERSATIONS AND WE APPRECIATE
[000:12:34;353] THE WAY THEY'RE WORKING WITH US.
[000:12:37;490] I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE MORE.
[000:12:42;361] >> I'D FOLLOW UP ON MY INITIAL
[000:12:43;129] QUESTION.
[000:12:43;496] YOU SAID THIS WAS NOT TARGETED
[000:12:44;296] AT CHINA SPECIFICALLY.
[000:12:45;464] BUT CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING
[000:12:47;800] PARTNER WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:12:48;901] SO CAN YOU SPELL OUT HOW THIS
[000:12:50;903] WILL AFFECT THEM AND HOW IT WILL
[000:12:52;838] AFFECT THE U.S. AND THEIR
[000:12:54;907] RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA WITH
[000:12:55;708] REGARD TO NORTH KOREA?
[000:12:56;742] >> AS I EMPHASIZED EARLIER, THIS
[000:12:59;145] IS TARGETED AT NORTH KOREA AND
[000:13:01;113] ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO DO TRADE
[000:13:03;249] OR BUSINESS WITH THEM.
[000:13:04;517] WE APPRECIATE THE RELATIONSHIP
[000:13:06;418] WITH CHINA AND LOOK FORWARD TO
[000:13:07;953] WORKING WITH THEM.
[000:13:10;256] THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
[000:13:13;192] >> Shepard: STEVE MNUCHIN
[000:13:16;162] DISCUSSING THE NEW SANCTIONS BY
[000:13:19;331] THE PRESIDENT THROUGH NORTH
[000:13:20;299] KOREA WITH PARTNERSHIP IT WOULD
[000:13:22;168] APPEAR FROM A NUMBER OF NATIONS.
[000:13:23;869] HE WOULDN'T BE SPECIFIC ABOUT
[000:13:25;938] DISCUSSIONS.
[000:13:26;338] BIG PICTURE WITH THE SANCTIONS
[000:13:27;740] AND THE NATIONS COMING TOGETHER
[000:13:30;109] WHAT IS THE GOAL?
[000:13:31;977] JOHN ROBERTS TRAVELLING WITH THE
[000:13:36;749] PRESIDENT IN NEW YORK AND IN THE
[000:13:37;550] STUDIO WITH US TODAY.
[000:13:38;150] BIG PICTURE?
[000:13:38;551] >> BIG PICTURE, THIS IS DESIGNED
[000:13:39;418] TO GET KIM JONG-UN TO THE
[000:13:42;588] NEGOTIATING TABLE.
[000:13:44;523] THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED, IS
[000:13:46;659] THERE STILL ROOM FOR DIALOGUE?
[000:13:48;160] HE SAID WHY NOT.
[000:13:49;562] ALL OF THIS THAT YOU'VE HAVE
[000:13:51;597] SEEN IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO GET
[000:13:55;568] KIM JONG-UN TO THE NEGOTIATING
[000:13:59;405] TABLE TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST
[000:14:01;006] FREEZING IT BUT TO GIVE IT UP.
[000:14:03;375] THE PRESIDENT'S GOAL IS TO
[000:14:07;112] DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN
[000:14:12;084] PENINSULA.
[000:14:12;451] IT MEANS FREEZING IT AND ROLLING
[000:14:14;253] IT BACK TO NOTHING.
[000:14:16;121] ONE OF THE BIG DEVELOPMENTS IS
[000:14:18;757] THE FACT THAT CHINA FINALLY
[000:14:20;025] STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE.
[000:14:21;393] LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:14:22;394] SAID CHINA DECIDED TO DO TODAY.
[000:14:26;599] >> CHINA, THEIR CENTRAL BANK,
[000:14:31;470] HAS TOLD THEIR OTHER BANKS, A
[000:14:33;839] MASSIVE BANKING SYSTEM, TO
[000:14:36;842] IMMEDIATELY STOP DOING BUSINESS
[000:14:40;546] WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:14:43;816] I THANK PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA
[000:14:46;852] FOR THE BOLD MOVE HE MADE TODAY.
[000:14:50;556] THIS IS A SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED
[000:14:52;091] MOVE AROUND WE APPRECIATE IT.
[000:14:53;525] >> RIGHT NOW THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:14:56;695] SPEAKING WITH PRESIDENT ERDOGAN
[000:14:59;732] FROM TURKEY.
[000:15:00;833] THEY'RE HAVING A BILATERAL
[000:15:02;201] MEETING AND THE POOL IS THERE.
[000:15:03;502] LET'S WATCH.
[000:15:04;403] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:15:05;771] A GREAT HONOR AND PRIVILEGE.
[000:15:09;208] HE'S BECOME A FRIEND OF MINE.
[000:15:11;577] I WANT TO INTRODUCE PRESIDENT
[000:15:15;247] ERDOGAN OF TURKEY.
[000:15:17;883] HE'S RUNNING A VERY DIFFICULT
[000:15:20;286] PART OF THE WORLD.
[000:15:25;424] HE'S INVOLVED VERY STRONGLY AND
[000:15:26;225] HE'S GETTING HIGH MARKS FRANKLY.
[000:15:27;793] HE'S ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE
[000:15:29;995] UNITED STATES.
[000:15:30;896] WE HAVE A GREAT FRIENDSHIP.
[000:15:33;065] AS COUNTRIES WE'RE AS CLOSE AS
[000:15:34;566] WE HAVE EVER BEEN.
[000:15:35;534] A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE
[000:15:38;003] PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
[000:15:39;605] SO PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY
[000:15:41;073] MUCH.
[000:15:41;373] A GREAT HONOR TO HAVE YOU HERE
[000:15:45;110] IN THE UNITED STATES.
[000:15:47;313] THANK YOU.
[000:16:06;298] [SPEAKING TURKISH].
[000:16:12;404] >> Shepard: THE TURKISH PRIME
[000:16:19;578] MINISTER EDWARD SPEAKING WITH
[000:16:20;713] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:16:21;447] ERDOGAN, A VERY COMPLICATED
[000:16:25;217] RELATIONSHIP.
[000:16:25;651] LET'S LISTEN.
[000:16:27;152] >> WE ARE GETTING TOGETHER WITH
[000:16:29;722] YOU AS A DELEGATION AND WE WILL
[000:16:32;324] COME BACK TO BILATERAL
[000:16:34;994] MEETINGS-WE'LL ASSESS THE
[000:16:36;762] CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
[000:16:38;330] THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY AND
[000:16:39;832] HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS
[000:16:41;400] REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AS A
[000:16:42;568] WHOLE.
[000:16:42;968] I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK
[000:16:44;937] YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
[000:16:46;038] THANK YOU.
[000:16:46;638] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
[000:16:47;940] MR. PRESIDENT.
[000:16:48;574] WE APPRECIATE IT.
[000:16:51;477] THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
[000:17:08;560] >> MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN IS THE
[000:17:10;062] LAST TIME YOU SPOKE WITH PAUL
[000:17:14;933] MANAFORT.
[000:17:15;300] >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
[000:17:15;934] >> Shepard: A DIFFICULT SET OF
[000:17:16;702] CIRCUMSTANCES HERE WITH THE
[000:17:17;703] PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN.
[000:17:19;571] HE'S JAILED PEOPLE BY THE
[000:17:21;206] THOUSANDS FOR SPEAKING OUT
[000:17:24;143] AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT.
[000:17:26;211] HE'S JAILED MORE THAN 120
[000:17:29;415] JOURNALISTS, DENOUNCED AROUND
[000:17:31;383] THE WORLD.
[000:17:32;284] THERE'S A WIDELY-HELD BELIEF
[000:17:34;420] THAT HE'S TURNING WHAT APPEARED
[000:17:35;821] TO BE A COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO
[000:17:38;991] DEMOCRATIZATION INTO SOMETHING
[000:17:41;560] AKIN TO A DICTATORSHIP.
[000:17:43;429] >> THE PROBLEM HERE, HE'S A NATO
[000:17:45;898] MEMBER AND TURKEY IS THE GATEWAY
[000:17:48;067] FROM TURKEY TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
[000:17:50;736] YOU SAID IT'S A COMPLICATED
[000:17:52;571] RELATIONSHIP.
[000:17:53;105] A DIPLOMATIC WAY OF PUTTING UP.
[000:17:55;541] >> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
[000:17:56;575] RESOLVE IT.
[000:17:57;910] SEEING HIM UP THERE, AS A
[000:17:59;478] JOURNALIST IT AFFECTS YOU THE
[000:18:01;346] SAME WAY IT DOES ME.
[000:18:02;247] IT'S A SCARY PROPOSITION WHAT IS
[000:18:09;188] HAPPENING IN TURKEY, IT'S
[000:18:09;888] AGAINST EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN
[000:18:10;689] THE UNITED STATES.
[000:18:11;190] >> IT IS.
[000:18:11;557] UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PRESIDENT,
[000:18:12;324] THIS NATION NEEDS TO HAVE A
[000:18:13;058] RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAUSE OF
[000:18:15;160] WHERE HIS COUNTRY IS AND WHERE
[000:18:17;629] THEY REPRESENT.
[000:18:18;363] IT'S ONE OF THOSE LINES THAT YOU
[000:18:19;832] HAVE TO HOLD YOUR NOSE TO DEAL
[000:18:21;233] WITH THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DEAL
[000:18:22;768] WITH.
[000:18:23;068] THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE IN THIS
[000:18:25;170] POINT.
[000:18:25;471] BACK TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
[000:18:28;207] PRIOR TO GOING HERE, CHINA.
[000:18:30;909] THE MOVE THAT CHINA MADE IN
[000:18:32;277] TERMS OF THE CENTRAL BANK
[000:18:34;213] TELLING CHINESE BANKS, DON'T DO
[000:18:36;782] ANY BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA
[000:18:41;420] ANYMORE, THAT'S BIG.
[000:18:42;354] THE PRESIDENT SAID CHINA NEEDS
[000:18:43;322] TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE.
[000:18:45;023] WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT
[000:18:47;326] LAST THURSDAY, I ASKED HIM ABOUT
[000:18:49;228] NORTH KOREA AND CHINA.
[000:18:50;229] HE SAID THEY'RE PLANNING SOME
[000:18:51;463] MOVES WITH CHINA HE COULDN'T
[000:18:52;831] TELL US ABOUT.
[000:18:53;599] IT WOULD CLEARLY SEEM THIS IS
[000:18:55;334] IT.
[000:18:55;868] WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE
[000:19:00;939] THIS DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT
[000:19:01;640] CHINA'S COOPERATION AND CHINA
[000:19:02;407] TAKING STRINGENT MEASURES.
[000:19:03;976] ALWAYS LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR
[000:19:06;145] CHEATING, BUT MAYBE THIS IS A
[000:19:07;779] STEP DOWN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
[000:19:09;648] >> Shepard: CHINA HAS BEEN CLEAR
[000:19:11;783] TO SAY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE,
[000:19:13;485] WE'VE DONE WHAT WE CAN DO.
[000:19:15;320] THE WORLD IS PUSHING US.
[000:19:17;222] >> THE CHINESE CAN DO MORE THAN
[000:19:19;391] THEY'VE BEEN DOING.
[000:19:20;492] >> Shepard: OBVIOUSLY.
[000:19:21;426] I WONDER IF THIS IS A CHANGE.
[000:19:24;163] >> IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A
[000:19:25;964] CHANGE.
[000:19:26;465] ALTHOUGH THERE'S ROOM FOR
[000:19:28;000] CHEATING.
[000:19:28;367] IS THIS CHINA JUST SAYING THIS
[000:19:29;902] IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO OR IS
[000:19:33;172] THIS CHINA DOING WHAT THEY SAY
[000:19:35;941] THEY'RE GOING TO DO?
[000:19:38;010] >> Shepard: THE U.S.,
[000:19:40;078] SANCTIONING BANKS, THIS IS A
[000:19:42;181] WIDE EXPANSION?
[000:19:43;515] >> IT BROADENS THE TARGET
[000:19:45;384] ENVIRONMENT.
[000:19:45;817] THERE WAS ONE CHINESE BANK BEING
[000:19:48;253] SANCTIONED.
[000:19:48;654] THIS LAST TARGETED INDIVIDUALS
[000:19:49;788] MORE THAN ANYTHING.
[000:19:50;489] THE FACT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT
[000:19:55;794] NORTH KOREA AND GOING TO TARGET
[000:19:56;595] THE NORTH KOREAN TEXTILE
[000:19:57;296] INDUSTRY AND THE FISHING
[000:20:00;199] INDUSTRY.
[000:20:00;732] OTHER SMALLER INDUSTRIES THAT
[000:20:03;235] HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
[000:20:05;337] DEFENSE MINISTRY, THIS IS TRYING
[000:20:08;240] TO PUT A CHOKE HOLD ON NORTH
[000:20:09;908] KOREA.
[000:20:10;209] THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE
[000:20:11;810] DOESN'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR
[000:20:13;845] ANYTHING SHORT OF
[000:20:16;715] DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
[000:20:19;117] PENINSULA.
[000:20:19;651] THERE COULD BE WIGGLE ROOM
[000:20:23;622] THERE.
[000:20:23;922] I DON'T THINK NORTH KOREA WOULD
[000:20:27;226] FREEZE IT UP.
[000:20:28;660] >> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN
[000:20:30;395] ROBERTS.
[000:20:31;230] GORDON CHANG WROTE THE BOOK ON
[000:20:34;833] NORTH KOREA.
[000:20:35;234] HE'S OUR GUEST LIVE NEXT.
[000:20:38;804] WILL THIS WORK?
[000:20:39;271] THAT'S NEXT.
[000:20:47;813] When my doctor told me
[000:20:49;381] I have age-related macular
[000:20:49;381] degeneration, AMD,
[000:20:52;017] he told me to look at this
[000:20:52;017] grid every day.
[000:20:54;519] And we came up with a plan
[000:20:55;821] to help reduce
[000:20:56;555] my risk
[000:20:56;555] of progression,
[000:20:57;589] including PreserVision
[000:20:57;589] AREDS 2.
[000:21:00;125] My doctor said
[000:21:00;993] PreserVision
[000:21:00;993] AREDS 2
[000:21:02;227] has the exact
[000:21:02;227] nutrient formula
[000:21:04;196] the National Eye
[000:21:04;196] Institute recommends
[000:21:06;298] to help reduce
[000:21:07;432] the risk of progression of
[000:21:07;432] moderate to advanced AMD
[000:21:09;835] after 15 years
[000:21:09;835] of clinical studies.
[000:21:13;505] PreserVision
[000:21:13;505] AREDS 2.
[000:21:15;307] Because my eyes
[000:21:15;307] are everything.
[000:22:35;120] But Prevagen helps your brain
[000:22:35;120] with an ingredient
[000:22:37;356] originally discovered...
[000:22:38;890] in jellyfish.
[000:22:40;125] In clinical trials,
[000:22:40;125] Prevagen has been shown
[000:22:42;327] to improve short-term memory.
[000:22:45;030] Prevagen. The name to remember.
[000:23:58;487] >> Shepard: NEW SANCTIONS ON
[000:24:00;589] NORTH KOREA WITH CHINESE HELP.
[000:24:02;991] LET'S GO TO GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR
[000:24:05;527] OF "NUCLEAR SHOW DOWN: NORTH
[000:24:07;863] KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD."
[000:24:09;531] GORDON, THANK YOU.
[000:24:10;198] >> THANKS, SHEP.
[000:24:11;099] >> Shepard: A BIT OF A MUTED
[000:24:13;869] RESPONSE.
[000:24:14;236] SOMETHING ABOUT DOGS BARKING.
[000:24:15;971] YOUR THOUGHTS?
[000:24:16;872] >> YEAH, THIS IS EXTREMELY
[000:24:20;242] SIGNIFICANT.
[000:24:20;642] WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AND
[000:24:22;310] WHAT TREASURY SECRETARY MNUCHIN
[000:24:23;979] IS NOW DOING IS SHUTTING OFF THE
[000:24:30;719] MONEY TO THE NORTH KOREAN
[000:24:31;453] REGIME.
[000:24:31;786] EVERY BANK GETS A FREE PASS FOR
[000:24:32;554] WHAT THEY DID IN THE PAST WITH
[000:24:33;321] THEIR RELATIONS WITH PYONGYANG.
[000:24:34;389] WHAT MNUCHIN SAID, LOOK, GOING
[000:24:36;558] FORWARD, IF A BANK VIOLATES U.S.
[000:24:38;760] LAW, IT WILL BE DESIGNATED.
[000:24:41;229] YOU HEARD THAT WORD
[000:24:43;565] "DESIGNATION" IN THE PRESS
[000:24:45;000] CONFERENCE.
[000:24:45;400] THAT'S UNDER 311 OF THE PATRIOT
[000:24:48;170] ACT.
[000:24:48;470] IF A BANK IS SO DESIGNATED, IT'S
[000:24:51;439] CUT OFF FROM THE GLOBAL
[000:24:52;240] FINANCIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT CAN
[000:24:53;742] NO LONGER TRANSACT BUSINESS IN
[000:24:55;944] DOLLARS.
[000:24:56;311] WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS NOW WILL
[000:24:57;979] DO IS TRY TO TRANSACT BUSINESS
[000:24:59;581] IN OTHER CURRENCIES, WHAT THE
[000:25:06;555] UNITED STATES IS GO AROUND THE
[000:25:07;489] WORLD AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T
[000:25:08;590] USE OTHER CURRENCIES.
[000:25:10;592] >> Shepard: THE NORTH KOREANS
[000:25:11;626] DIDN'T SAY MUCH.
[000:25:12;460] THEY WAIT AWHILE.
[000:25:13;595] YOU WONDER IF THEY WON'T WAIT
[000:25:15;230] UNTIL ALL OF THESE WORLD LEADERS
[000:25:17;232] GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES.
[000:25:19;000] >> OH, ABSOLUTELY.
[000:25:20;569] THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO DO
[000:25:25;740] IS ENGAGE IN A PROVOCATION THAT
[000:25:30;679] GIVES UP TRUMP TO TALK TO OTHER
[000:25:34;149] WORLD LEADERS.
[000:25:35;884] I EXPECT THE NORTH KOREANS TO BE
[000:25:37;986] QUIET A WORK OR SO.
[000:25:40;589] YOU HEARD WHAT NORTH KOREA SAY
[000:25:43;825] ABOUT THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT
[000:25:46;127] TRUMP, LIKE A DOG BARKING.
[000:25:48;230] THEY'RE SEEING THAT THE U.S. CAN
[000:25:51;700] EXERT PRESSURE ON THEIR PRIMARY
[000:25:55;303] BACKER.
[000:25:56;171] NORTH KOREA IS IN A WORLD OF
[000:25:59;207] HURT.
[000:25:59;507] >> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS REPORTS
[000:26:03;445] THE BIG PICTURE IS TO GET NORTH
[000:26:05;513] KOREANS TO THE NEGOTIATING
[000:26:07;115] TABLE.
[000:26:07;616] DOES THIS HELP?
[000:26:08;283] >> OBVIOUSLY NEGOTIATIONS ARE
[000:26:09;851] THE PREFERRED WAY OF SOLVING
[000:26:11;553] THIS.
[000:26:11;853] I BELIEVE WE SHOULD START THE
[000:26:14;422] DISCUSSIONS ONLY WHEN THE NORTH
[000:26:19;494] KOREANS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY
[000:26:20;262] HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DISARM.
[000:26:20;996] IF WE START THEM EARLIER THAN
[000:26:21;696] THAT, THEY WILL USE THEM TO
[000:26:22;397] DELAY TO PERFECT THEIR MISSILES
[000:26:23;265] AND NUKES.
[000:26:23;698] THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN THE
[000:26:26;268] SIX-PARTY TALKS IN THE
[000:26:27;235] ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W.
[000:26:28;203] BUSH.
[000:26:28;503] WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.
[000:26:30;372] THE PRESIDENT, OUR PRESIDENT
[000:26:32;607] UNDERSTANDS THAT, AND I THINK
[000:26:34;042] WE'LL SEE MAXIMUM PRESSURE,
[000:26:35;777] MAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT, WHICH IS THE
[000:26:37;479] BUZZ PHRASE IN WASHINGTON.
[000:26:39;614] IT MIGHT WORK THIS TIME IF THE
[000:26:41;616] ADMINISTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY
[000:26:42;450] DETERMINED TO CARRY FORWARD ON
[000:26:44;919] THIS.
[000:26:45;220] >> Shepard: SHORT ON TIME.
[000:26:46;688] LESS LIKELY OR MORE LIKELY TO
[000:26:48;590] GET ANOTHER MISSILE TEST?
[000:26:50;225] >> THERE WILL BE ANOTHER MISSILE
[000:26:52;527] TEST.
[000:26:52;827] THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TO
[000:26:54;329] IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES.
[000:26:55;864] THEY WANT A DETERRENT.
[000:26:57;165] THEY WANT TO SELL THESE THINGS
[000:26:58;767] TO THE IRANIANS, THIS IS WHERE
[000:27:00;802] WE COME IN.
[000:27:01;503] THE IRANIANS PAY THE NORTH
[000:27:04;773] KOREANS $2 BILLION TO $3 BILLION
[000:27:07;075] A YEAR.
[000:27:07;842] WHAT MNUCHIN IS DOING WILL CUT
[000:27:14;382] OFF THAT FLOW OF CASH IF HE'S
[000:27:15;216] SUCCESSFUL.
[000:27:15;617] WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED THAT THE
[000:27:18;453] NORTH KOREANS DON'T SWITCH TO
[000:27:19;187] OTHER CURRENCIES.
[000:27:19;721] THE ONE CURRENCY WE CAN'T
[000:27:23;625] CONTROL IS THE CHINESE CURRENCY.

[000:27:43;345] THAT CAME FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY.
[000:27:45;647] EARLIER REPORTS HAD INDICATED
[000:27:47;015] THAT UP TO SIX CHILDREN MIGHT BE
[000:27:48;416] ALIVE IN THE RUBBLE.
[000:27:50;251] THE ASSOCIATED PRESS QUOTING AN
[000:27:52;153] OFFICIAL FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY
[000:27:55;023] SAYS THERE MAY STILL BE AN ADULT
[000:27:57;092] ALIVE IN THE WRECKAGE.

[000:28:28;823] INJURED MORE THAN 2,000.
[000:28:30;925] OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT,
[000:28:32;260] JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE AT THE
[000:28:35;096] SCHOOL.
[000:28:35;897] JONATHAN?
[000:28:36;498] >> SHEP, IT'S A VERY TENSE SCENE
[000:28:38;233] HERE AT THE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.
[000:28:39;801] THE SCHOOL IS ABOUT 50 YARDS OR
[000:28:43;171] SO BEHIND ME.
[000:28:43;905] IT'S A HIVE OF ACTIVITY AND
[000:28:45;740] REMAINS SO.
[000:28:47;041] RUBBLE BEING BROUGHT OUT FROM
[000:28:47;809] THE SCENE, LOADED ON TO THE

[000:28:50;645] AS WE COME LEFT AND DOWN A BIT,
[000:28:53;114] YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPLY TENTS.
[000:28:54;616] THESE ARE SET UP TO SUPPORT THE

[000:29:08;463] EFFORT, SHEP.
[000:29:08;897] WE HAVE BEEN GETTING CONFLICTING
[000:29:09;664] REPORTS ALL DAY AS YOU JUST
[000:29:11;933] POINTED OUT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
[000:29:13;168] THERE MAY BE ANY SURVIVORS
[000:29:15;136] UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE OF THAT
[000:29:17;238] SCHOOL AND WHETHER, IF THERE
[000:29:18;706] ARE, THEY ARE CHILDREN OR
[000:29:20;575] ADULTS.
[000:29:20;909] THE LATEST AS YOU SAID FROM THE
[000:29:23;778] ASSOCIATED PRESS, HEARING FROM
[000:29:24;846] THE MEXICAN NAVY, WHICH IS ONE
[000:29:26;881] OF THE INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN
[000:29:28;516] THE RESCUE EFFORT, THAT THEY DO
[000:29:30;919] NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY
[000:29:31;786] SURVIVING CHILDREN.
[000:29:33;521] THEY DO BELIEVE THERE MAY BE AN
[000:29:35;523] ADULT ALIVE.
[000:29:36;424] WE HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM OUR
[000:29:39;928] SOURCES CLOSER IN TO THE SCHOOL
[000:29:41;496] THAT A HEAT-SEEKING CAMERA HAS
[000:29:45;733] PICKED UP A SIGNAL THAT MAY
[000:29:47;902] INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE
[000:29:49;037] SOMEBODY ALIVE.
[000:29:49;971] I WANT TO CAUTION EVEN WITH THE
[000:29:52;807] ASSOCIATED PRESS HEARING THIS
[000:29:58;179] FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY, THERE'S
[000:29:58;980] SO MANY CONFLICTING REPORTS
[000:29:59;714] FLOATING AROUND WHO MAY OR MAY
[000:30:01;282] NOT BE ALIVE UNDERNEATH THAT
[000:30:02;984] RUBBLE.
[000:30:03;318] IT'S DIFFICULT TO TAKE ANYTHING
[000:30:04;385] WITH ANY CERTAINTY AT THIS
[000:30:06;888] POINT.
[000:30:07;188] OBVIOUSLY THE PARENTS THAT ARE
[000:30:08;289] STILL GATHERED HERE, THE PARENTS
[000:30:10;859] OF THE CHILDREN WHO ARE STILL
[000:30:13;228] MISSING ARE HOPING AGAINST HOPE
[000:30:15;663] THAT THEIR CHILD MAY STILL BE
[000:30:17;632] ALIVE, MAY COME OUT FROM
[000:30:18;933] UNDERNEATH THAT RUBBLE.
[000:30:20;802] OBVIOUSLY, SHEP, WE'RE SOME 48
[000:30:23;972] HOURS ON FROM THAT 7.1
[000:30:26;741] EARTHQUAKE AND WITH EVERY
[000:30:28;042] PASSING MINUTE, HOPES OF FINDING
[000:30:31;379] SURVIVORS HERE OR ANY OF THE
[000:30:33;047] OTHER SITES BEGIN TO DIM.
[000:30:35;316] SHEP?
[000:30:35;617] >> Shepard: MUCH OF THE FOCUS
[000:30:36;784] HAS BEEN ON THE SCHOOL.
[000:30:37;952] BUT YOU MENTIONED THE OTHER
[000:30:40;054] SITES.
[000:30:40;388] IT APPEARS THERE'S DOZENS AND
[000:30:42;757] DOZENS.
[000:30:43;091] ANY PROGRESS?
[000:30:43;658] >> INDEED THERE'S BEEN SOME
[000:30:45;226] PROGRESS, SHEP.
[000:30:47;562] WE WERE AT AN OFFICE BUILDING
[000:30:52;901] THAT COLLAPSED.
[000:30:53;401] YOU MIGHT HAVE LIVE PICTURES, IF
[000:30:54;168] NOT, VIDEO FROM THAT BUILDING.
[000:30:55;003] THAT IS IN DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY,
[000:30:58;840] AN AREA KNOWN AS ROMA.
[000:31:01;776] IT COLLAPSED OVERNIGHT.
[000:31:03;144] A MIRACLE THERE.
[000:31:04;746] TWO WOMEN AND ONE MAN PULLED OUT
[000:31:07;048] ALIVE.
[000:31:07;448] THE SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORT
[000:31:09;017] GOES ON THERE.
[000:31:09;784] WE'RE TOLD BY FAMILIES OF PEOPLE
[000:31:13;154] WHO THEY BELIEVE WERE IN THE
[000:31:14;789] OFFICE BUILDING AND STILL
[000:31:17;825] MISSING, THERE MAY BE 14 PEOPLE
[000:31:19;827] STILL TRAPPED IN THERE.
[000:31:21;396] WHETHER THEY ARE DEAD OR ALIVE,
[000:31:24;732] WE DON'T KNOW.
[000:31:26;434] AS THE PRESIDENT SAID, IT'S A
[000:31:30;138] RESCUE OPERATION.
[000:31:31;973] THEY WON'T GIVE UP UNTIL THEY'RE
[000:31:33;241] CERTAIN THERE'S NO CHANCES OF
[000:31:34;776] ANYBODY ELSE SURVIVING.
[000:31:36;177] SHEP?

[000:35:59;640] when I feel controlled
[000:35:59;640] by frequent,
[000:36:01;242] unpredictable abdominal pain
[000:36:01;242] or discomfort
[000:36:03;411] and diarrhea.
[000:36:04;612] I tried lifestyle changes
[000:36:06;280] and over-the-counter treatments,
[000:36:07;415] but my symptoms keep
[000:36:07;415] coming back.
[000:36:09;550] It turns out I have
[000:36:10;785] Irritable Bowel Syndrome
[000:36:10;785] with Diarrhea,
[000:36:12;787] or IBS-D.
[000:36:13;788] A condition that's really
[000:36:13;788] frustrating.
[000:36:16;023] That's why I talked to my
[000:36:16;023] doctor about VIBERZI...
[000:36:18;593] ...a different way
[000:36:18;593] to treat IBS-D.
[000:36:20;728] VIBERZI is a
[000:36:20;728] prescription medication
[000:36:22;530] you take every day
[000:36:24;165] that helps proactively manage
[000:36:25;132] both abdominal pain and
[000:36:26;267] diarrhea at the same time.
[000:36:28;436] So I can stay ahead of
[000:36:28;436] my symptoms.
[000:36:30;137] VIBERZI can cause new or
[000:36:30;137] worsening abdominal pain.
[000:36:32;607] Do not take VIBERZI
[000:36:32;607] if you have no gallbladder,
[000:36:35;142] have pancreas or
[000:36:35;142] severe liver problems,
[000:36:37;178] problems with alcohol abuse,
[000:36:38;613] long-lasting or
[000:36:38;613] severe constipation,
[000:36:40;715] or a bowel or
[000:36:40;715] gallbladder blockage.
[000:36:42;717] Pancreatitis may occur
[000:36:43;784] and can lead to
[000:36:43;784] hospitalization and death.
[000:36:46;187] If you are taking VIBERZI,
[000:36:47;421] you should not take medicines
[000:36:47;421] that cause constipation.
[000:36:49;857] The most common side effects of
[000:36:49;857] VIBERZI include constipation,
[000:36:52;827] nausea, and abdominal pain.
[000:36:54;962] Stay ahead of IBS-D
[000:36:54;962] with VIBERZI.

[000:37:31;299] CATEGORY FOUR STORM, 155 MILES
[000:37:33;067] AN HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS.
[000:37:34;502] THE STRONGEST HURRICANE

[000:37:48;916] THE STORM DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF
[000:37:51;052] HOMES AND KNOCKED OUT
[000:37:52;653] ELECTRICITY TO THE ISLAND AND
[000:37:53;988] BROUGHT DOWN CELL PHONE TOWERS

[000:37:57;558] TO CALL FOR HELP OR CALL FOR

[000:38:14;608] ROOF.
[000:38:14;909] THE ROAD LITTERED WITH POLES AND
[000:38:16;644] POWER LINES.
[000:38:18;579] LOOK AT THAT.
[000:38:19;613] THINK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO
[000:38:20;781] FREE UP THIS ROAD AND FREE UP
[000:38:22;316] THE POWER LINES?
[000:38:23;851] THERE'S A WHOLE ISLAND LIKE

[000:38:26;187] HERE'S WHAT'S LEFT OF A HOUSE

[000:38:40;835] YOU CAN SEE A DAMAGED RESTAURANT

[000:38:58;085] MOVED OFF THE COAST OF THE

[000:39:04;592] THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
[000:39:05;326] HERE IN THE U.S. REPORTS THAT
[000:39:06;093] MARIA IS EXPECTED TO BRING

[000:39:12;933] THE BAHAMAS LATER TODAY.

[000:39:19;540] THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.
[000:39:23;177] IT WAS A CAT FIVE MONSTER WHEN

[000:39:28;416] THERE'S MORE FLOODING IN

[000:39:43;664] AROUND THESE APARTMENTS.
[000:39:44;765] MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR BALCONIES.

[000:39:48;903] PEOPLE TRUDGING THROUGH THIS
[000:39:50;871] WATER WITH STICKS AS GUIDES.
[000:39:53;340] OLDER PEOPLE GETTING HELP.
[000:39:54;642] IT'S TOUGH TO SEE PEOPLE WALK
[000:39:59;547] THROUGH WITH CHILDREN ON THEIR

[000:40:08;689] IT'S OUTDOOR LIVING AT THE MOST
[000:40:12;993] PRIMITIVE.
[000:40:13;360] WE'VE SEEN A HYDRANT USED AS A

[000:40:21;435] >> Shepard: STEVE, ARE THEY
[000:40:23;104] GETTING THE HELP IN THE EARLY
[000:40:24;872] GOING?
[000:40:25;172] >> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE

[000:40:28;576] WITH FLOOD WATER AND HOLES IN
[000:40:30;311] THE ROOFS, THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT
[000:40:32;680] GETTING ANYTHING.
[000:40:33;714] IT'S A DO-IT-YOURSELF OPERATION.
[000:40:37;551] IT'S PEOPLE TAKING RUBBISH FROM
[000:40:39;320] HURRICANE IRMA AND TRYING TO USE
[000:40:40;621] IT TO PROP UP A POWER LINE THAT
[000:40:42;456] WAS DOWNED BY HURRICANE MARIA.
[000:40:44;792] USING ONE HURRICANE TO HELP
[000:40:46;127] ANOTHER.
[000:40:46;460] HELP IS ON THE WAY FROM FEMA AND
[000:40:48;496] FROM THE COAST GUARD.
[000:40:49;697] RIGHT NOW MOODS ARE GOOD HERE.
[000:40:54;502] THE PEOPLE ARE RESILIENT.
[000:40:55;169] WITHOUT HELP QUICKLY, THAT COULD

[000:41:10;217] RICK?
[000:41:10;518] >> TURKS AND CAICOS WILL BE SPOT
[000:41:14;088] THAT TAKES THE WORST OF IT.
[000:41:15;723] WINDS 20 TO 50 MILES AN HOUR.
[000:41:18;526] STILL MORE RAIN HERE.
[000:41:20;694] FLOODING.
[000:41:21;061] THE TURKS AND CAICOS, IT WILL
[000:41:22;396] GET THERE CLOSE TONIGHT AND
[000:41:23;597] TOMORROW.
[000:41:23;964] THAT SAID, WE'RE WATCHING
[000:41:25;499] TROPICAL STORM JOSE.
[000:41:26;467] UP HERE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.
[000:41:27;835] THAT HAS CREATED A WEAKNESS IN
[000:41:30;037] THE ATMOSPHERE.
[000:41:30;604] IT'S GOING TO ALLOW MARIA TO
[000:41:32;740] MOVE TO THE NORTH.
[000:41:33;774] WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR RELIABLE
[000:41:35;976] COMPUTER GUIDANCE RIGHT NOW,
[000:41:37;478] PULLS THIS UP BETWEEN BERMUDA
[000:41:39;046] AND THE U.S.
[000:41:40;514] AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
[000:41:42;316] GOING TO STAY BETWEEN THAT AREA.
[000:41:43;651] IT'S A SLOW-MOVING STORM.
[000:41:48;889] WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT
[000:41:49;723] A WEEK OR SO BEFORE IT GETS INTO
[000:41:50;491] THIS AREA.
[000:41:50;858] MORE PROBLEMS FOR THE COAST.
[000:41:52;927] CERTAINLY BEACH EROSION.
[000:41:54;295] AS LONG AS WE THREAT THIS NEEDLE
[000:41:56;096] BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE EAST
[000:41:57;831] COAST, I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING
[000:42:00;534] GOOD.
[000:42:00;834] THE OFFICIAL TRACK FROM THE
[000:42:01;969] NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SHOWS
[000:42:03;370] THAT.
[000:42:03;904] KEEPING THIS WELL OFFSHORE AND
[000:42:05;639] THEN EVENTUALLY BY THURSDAY TO
[000:42:08;576] FRIDAY OUT TO SEE.
[000:42:09;510] ANY BIG IMPACTS ACROSS THE U.S.
[000:42:12;446] WON'T BE FELT.

[000:42:51;685] If he'd taken Tylenol,

[000:42:55;889] Only Aleve has the
[000:42:55;889] strength to stop tough pain
[000:42:58;525] for up to 12 hours
[000:42:58;525] with just one pill.
[000:43:01;595] Tylenol can't do that.

[000:45:08;355] and young adults in the
[000:45:08;355] first few months.

[000:52:09;142] ZUCKERBERG THAT FACEBOOK JUST
[000:52:10;944] STRUCK A DEAL WITH CONGRESS TO
[000:52:12;078] REACH DETAILS ABOUT ADS THAT THE
[000:52:15;348] RUSSIANS PURCHASED TO INFLUENCE
[000:52:17;417] THE 2016 ELECTION.
[000:52:20;554] MORE THAN 3,000 ADS APPEARED TO
[000:52:23;390] HAVE COME FROM A RUSSIAN LINKED
[000:52:25;959] FIRM.
[000:52:26;259] FACEBOOK REPORTS THEY WILL
[000:52:27;027] HAPPENED OVER THE ADS.
[000:52:29;396] LET'S BRING IN CHAD DAY FROM THE
[000:52:31;898] ASSOCIATED PRESS.
[000:52:33;400] THIS IS A REVERSAL ON FACEBOOK'S
[000:52:37;904] PART.
[000:52:38;438] ZUCKERBERG IS SAYING WE HAVE TO
[000:52:39;940] DO THIS, IT'S VITAL FOR THE
[000:52:44;878] NATION AND ALL OF YOU OTHER
[000:52:45;545] MEDIA COMPANIES YOU NEED TO DO
[000:52:46;313] THE SAME THING.
[000:52:46;847] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:52:47;347] SO THIS IS A BIG REVERSAL FOR
[000:52:49;783] THEM.
[000:52:50;350] PREVIOUSLY THEY DECIDED THEY
[000:52:51;852] WEREN'T GOING TO TURN OVER THE
[000:52:53;720] CONTENTS OF THE ADS THAT THEY
[000:52:55;388] TRACED BACK TO RUSSIAN FIRMS
[000:52:57;324] THAT WRITE POLITICAL, ON TOPICS
[000:53:00;260] THAT WERE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
[000:53:01;695] ISSUES TARGETED DURING THE
[000:53:03;597] CAMPAIGN.
[000:53:03;964] A BIG TOPIC OF INTEREST FOR THE
[000:53:05;899] COMMITTEES AND LEADERS OF THE
[000:53:08;168] SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
[000:53:08;969] HAD BEEN TURNING OVER FOR THEM
[000:53:10;937] TO TURN OVER THE CONTENTS TO ARE
[000:53:13;907] YOU VERY THEM AND SEE IF THE ADS
[000:53:15;675] WERE TARGETED AT SPECIFIC
[000:53:17;410] GROUPS.
[000:53:17;744] >> AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
[000:53:20;347] TARGETED TOWARDS SPECIFIC
[000:53:21;982] GROUPS, WHETHER SOMEBODY LED THE
[000:53:23;650] RUSSIANS TOWARD THAT.
[000:53:24;417] THAT IS THE HEART OF THIS
[000:53:27;320] INVESTIGATION, IS IT NOT?
[000:53:29;089] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:53:29;623] AS THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE
[000:53:32;125] LOOKING AT THE RUSSIAN
[000:53:33;460] INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION BUT
[000:53:39;065] LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS
[000:53:39;766] ANYBODY ON THE AMERICAN SIDE TO
[000:53:40;533] DIRECT WHERE THE ADS WOULD BE
[000:53:41;334] TARGETED.
[000:53:41;701] ONE OF THE MAIN THING THEY'RE
[000:53:43;370] LOOKING AT, IF THEY'RE TARGETED
[000:53:45;405] AT SPECIFIC GROUPS THAT COULD
[000:53:47;540] DECREASE VOTER TURNOUT FOR
[000:53:49;342] HILLARY CLINTON OR INCREASE
[000:53:50;677] TURNOUT FOR TRUMP.
[000:53:52;379] SO WHAT THE COMMITTEES
[000:53:54;948] PARTICULARLY LOOKED AT, THAT'S
[000:53:56;917] SOMETHING THAT AN AMERICAN
[000:53:58;785] POLITICAL OPERATIVE WOULD KNOW.
[000:54:01;421] SO THAT'S OF PARTICULAR INTEREST
[000:54:02;856] TO THEM AND LOOKING FOR WHETHER
[000:54:05;258] THERE WAS ANY COORDINATION
[000:54:06;626] BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
[000:54:07;994] RUSSIANS IS PART OF THIS RUSSIAN
[000:54:11;064] INTERFERENCE.
[000:54:11;498] SO FAR THE COMMITTEES HAVE SAID
[000:54:13;199] WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE OF
[000:54:15;302] COORDINATION BUT THEY HAVEN'T
[000:54:16;736] SAID ANYTHING CONCLUSIVELY.
[000:54:20;140] >> Shepard: WHICH TAKES US BACK
[000:54:21;374] TO PAUL MANAFORT WHO WAS WITH
[000:54:24;010] THE CAMPAIGN FOR A SHORT PERIOD
[000:54:26;413] OF TIME.
[000:54:26;947] AT ANY RATE, IT'S CLEAR TO
[000:54:29;049] INVESTIGATORS THAT HE OFFERED A
[000:54:33;887] PRIVATE BRIEFING TO A RUSSIAN
[000:54:34;654] BILLIONAIRE WITH CLOSE TIES TO
[000:54:35;455] VLADIMIR PUTIN.
[000:54:35;956] IT APPEARS THE FEDS WANT TO KNOW
[000:54:38;158] WHY HE DID THAT AND A LOT ELSE.
[000:54:41;728] >> RIGHT.
[000:54:42;495] SO YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN OFF OF A
[000:54:48;134] BRIEFING FOR A RUSSIAN
[000:54:50;370] BILLIONAIRE WHO HAS BEEN
[000:54:51;438] DESCRIBED AS BEING CLOSE TO
[000:54:53;173] PUTIN.
[000:54:53;473] THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS
[000:54:55;575] DESCRIBED IN AN E-MAIL BETWEEN
[000:54:56;843] POWELL MANAFORT AND A FORMER
[000:54:58;511] WORKER OR FORMER EMPLOYEE OF HIS
[000:55:02;382] A UKRAINIAN NATIONAL THAT WORKED
[000:55:04;117] WITH HIM ON POLITICAL CONSULTING
[000:55:06;486] IN THE UKRAINE.
[000:55:07;554] SO WE DON'T KNOW -- WHAT WE
[000:55:09;356] DON'T KNOW YET, A LOT WE DON'T
[000:55:12;158] KNOW ABOUT THIS POINT, WHETHER
[000:55:14;527] THAT OFFER WENT TO THE RUSSIANS.
[000:55:19;432] THE STORY WAS BROKE YET AND IT
[000:55:21;334] WAS NOTED THERE WERE NO
[000:55:23;003] BRIEFINGS THAT OCCURRED OR
[000:55:24;004] WHETHER THIS OFFER WAS ACTUALLY
[000:55:28;775] PASSED TO THE RUSSIANS.
[000:55:29;409] WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE
[000:55:30;210] E-MAILS ARE LEGITIMATE AND
[000:55:34;180] ROBERT MUELLER HAS THEM IN HIS
[000:55:35;415] POSSESSION AS WELL AS
[000:55:36;616] CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.
[000:55:37;617] THEY'LL LOOK AT THIS WHEN THEY
[000:55:39;185] LOOK AT DIRECT TIES OR LINKS
[000:55:41;354] BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
[000:55:44;024] RUSSIANS.
[000:55:44;391] >> Shepard: THE BIG PICTURE
[000:55:45;525] QUESTION, WAS SOMEONE WITHIN THE
[000:55:46;960] CAMPAIGN DIRECTING THE RUSSIANS
[000:55:48;661] WHERE TO PLACE THE ADS TO HELP
[000:55:50;830] DONALD TRUMP GET ELECTED AND
[000:55:51;965] HURT HILLARY CLINTON'S CHANCES
[000:55:53;666] TO THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE
[000:55:56;102] ANSWER.
[000:55:57;604] BUT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS
[000:55:58;805] WORKING ON IT NOW.
[000:55:59;906] CHAD DAY FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS.

[000:58:48;274] three-quarters of what
[000:58:48;274] it takes to replace it.
[000:58:50;944] What are you supposed to do?
[000:58:52;212] Drive three-quarters of a car?
[000:58:54;247] Now if you had Liberty Mutual
[000:58:54;247] New Car Replacement™,

[000:59:17;403] >> Shepard: ON THIS DAY IN 1938,

[000:59:23;109] HURRICANES ON RECORD HIT THE
[000:59:25;979] NORTHEAST.

[000:59:48;968] NEW ENGLAND HURRICANE THAT HIT
[000:59:50;937] 79 YEARS AGO TODAY.
[000:59:51;771] SHOULD NEWS BREAK OUT, WE'LL

[001:00:23;603] MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS IN BOTH
[001:00:27;006] PARTIES WERE NOT?
[001:00:27;907] EVER SINCE NORTH KOREA STARTED
[001:00:29;776] AGITATING WITH A NUCLEAR FUTURE,
[001:00:31;577] THE PRESIDENTS GOING BACK TO
[001:00:34;580] GEORGE BUSH SR. TRIED TO REIGN
[001:00:37;317] THEM IN BY GETTING THE CHINESE
[001:00:39;285] TO REIGN THEM IN BUT THEY
[001:00:42;255] FAILED.
[001:00:43;289] AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGH GEORGE
[001:00:44;190] BUSH SR. AND BILL CLINTON AND
[001:00:47;994] GEORGE W. BUSH AND BARACK OBAMA.
[001:00:49;696] THEY FAILED.
[001:00:55;134] AGAIN AND AGAIN.
[001:00:55;635] THAT WAS UNTIL TODAY.
