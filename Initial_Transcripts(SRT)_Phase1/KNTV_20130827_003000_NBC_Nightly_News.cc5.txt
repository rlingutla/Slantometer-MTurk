[000:00:14;581] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS OWN
[000:00:15;281] PEOPLE.
[000:00:18;818] THE SECRETARY OF STATE CALLING
[000:00:19;552] IT A MORAL OBSCENITY.

[000:00:40;673] DEADLIEST AND HARDEST TO
[000:00:41;307] DIAGNOSIS.
[000:00:42;375] TONIGHT A SIMPLE BLOOD TEST THAT
[000:00:43;143] COULD SAVE THOUSANDS OF LIVES.
[000:00:44;911] >> AND, ABOUT LAST NIGHT.
[000:00:45;745] THE PERFORMANCE THAT LEFT NO
[000:00:46;446] DOUBT SHE IS NOT HANNAH MONTANA
[000:00:47;213] ANYMORE.
[000:00:48;081] DID SHE GO TOO FAR?
[000:00:51;451] OR WAS THAT EXACTLY THE POINT?
[000:00:52;519] "NIGHTLY NEWS" BEGINS NOW.
[000:01:05;432] >>> GOOD EVENING.
[000:01:06;766] I'M LESTER HOLT IN FOR BRIAN.
[000:01:08;334] THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT SAYS
[000:01:09;702] THERE IS NO QUESTION THEY DID
[000:01:10;437] IT.
[000:01:10;904] CALLING OUT THE SYRIAN
[000:01:11;971] GOVERNMENT OVER A CHEMICAL
[000:01:13;940] WEAPONS ATTACK LAST WEEK THAT
[000:01:15;008] KILLED HUNDREDS OF SYRIAN
[000:01:15;742] CIVILIANS.
[000:01:17;811] THE LANGUAGE FROM WASHINGTON
[000:01:19;612] TODAY WAS EXCEEDINGLY BLUNT.

[000:01:24;451] CASE FOR A LIKELY U.S. MILITARY
[000:01:25;218] RESPONSE.
[000:01:28;221] >> THE KILLING OF WOMEN AND
[000:01:29;923] CHILDREN AND INNOCENT BYSTANDERS
[000:01:31;958] BY CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A MORAL
[000:01:32;692] OBSCENITY.
[000:01:36;429] BY ANY STANDARD IT IS
[000:01:38;998] INEXCUSABLE AND DESPITE THE
[000:01:41;301] EXCUSES AND EQUIVOCATIONS THAT
[000:01:43;603] SOME HAVE MANUFACTURED, IT IS
[000:01:45;171] UNDENIABLE.
[000:01:47;207] >> TONIGHT THE WHITE HOUSE IS
[000:01:48;541] GATHERING INTERNATIONAL BACKING
[000:01:50;877] FOR POSSIBLE AIR STRIKES AGAINST
[000:01:52;679] SYRIA WHILE U.N.
[000:01:53;880] CHEMICAL WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE
[000:01:55;215] FINALLY BEEN ALLOWED IN TO
[000:01:56;916] GROUND ZERO OF LAST WEEK'S
[000:01:57;584] ATTACK.
[000:02:00;086] NBC'S RICHARD ENGEL MADE IT INTO
[000:02:00;854] SYRIA TODAY.
[000:02:02;355] HE IS NOW SAFELY BACK ON THE
[000:02:03;590] TURKISH SIDE OF THE BORDER WITH
[000:02:04;791] A LOT MORE ON TODAY'S
[000:02:05;391] FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS.
[000:02:06;960] RICHARD, GOOD EVENING.
[000:02:09;896] >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING,
[000:02:10;563] LESTER.
[000:02:11;331] SOME WESTERN OFFICIALS BELIEVE
[000:02:13;266] THAT PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD
[000:02:14;968] PERSONALLY ORDERED THE USE OF
[000:02:15;702] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:02:17;871] TONIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO
[000:02:19;439] FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE
[000:02:21;474] ABOUT ANY U.S. MILITARY ACTION.
[000:02:26;079] >> Reporter: U.N. INSPECTORS
[000:02:26;946] TODAY IN DAMASCUS.
[000:02:28;781] ONE OF THEIR VEHICLES SHOT BY A
[000:02:31;084] SNIPER, BUT AFTER A BRIEF DELAY
[000:02:32;385] THEY FINALLY BEGAN THEIR WORK
[000:02:34;087] INTERVIEWING SURVIVORS, DOCTORS
[000:02:35;555] AND TAKING SAMPLES.
[000:02:38;691] BUT THIS MAY ALREADY BE A SIDE
[000:02:39;425] SHOW.
[000:02:40;727] THE U.S. AND OTHERS ALREADY
[000:02:42;695] BELIEVE THE ASSAD REGIME USED
[000:02:44;998] CHEMICAL WEAPONS LAST WEEK ON A
[000:02:46;566] SCALE NOT SEEN ANYWHERE IN
[000:02:47;534] DECADES.
[000:02:50;069] SO AMERICA IS ONCE AGAIN
[000:02:52;238] BUILDING A CASE FOR MILITARY
[000:02:52;939] ACTION.
[000:02:54;807] >> THERE MUST BE ACCOUNTABILITY
[000:02:56;843] FOR THOSE WHO WOULD USE THE
[000:02:58;545] WORLD'S MOST HEINOUS WEAPONS.
[000:03:00;246] >> Reporter: THE LIKELY ACTION
[000:03:02;415] CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES FROM FOUR
[000:03:03;750] U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS AND TWO
[000:03:05;318] SUBMARINES ALREADY IN THE
[000:03:05;985] MEDITERRANEAN.

[000:03:12;225] SYSTEMS, PLANES AND AIRFIELDS,
[000:03:14;060] COMMAND AND CONTROL BUNKERS, BUT
[000:03:16;963] NOT U.S. OFFICIALS SAY PRESIDENT
[000:03:17;730] ASSAD HIMSELF.
[000:03:20;099] AND NOT CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCK
[000:03:20;833] PILES.
[000:03:21;434] TOO RISKY.
[000:03:23;002] WOULD IT BE LEGAL?
[000:03:25;438] U.N. BACKING IS UNLIKELY WITHOUT
[000:03:26;272] RUSSIAN SUPPORT.
[000:03:28;575] BUT A COALITION OF ARAB AND
[000:03:30;410] EUROPEAN STATES ALONG WITH THE
[000:03:32;078] U.S. COULD BE USED TO JUSTIFY A
[000:03:33;079] STRIKE.
[000:03:35;248] WE TRAVELED TO NORTHERN SYRIA
[000:03:36;950] TODAY WITH U.S.-BACKED REBELS.
[000:03:38;985] SYRIANS TELL US THE UNITED
[000:03:40;086] STATES HAS AN ENORMOUS
[000:03:40;687] RESPONSIBILITY NOW.
[000:03:42;889] YES, THIS ISN'T AMERICA'S WAR.
[000:03:48;561] AND NO, THESE PEOPLE HERE DON'T
[000:03:50;430] WANT AMERICAN TROOPS AND FOR
[000:03:51;164] THIS TO BECOME ANOTHER IRAQ.
[000:03:51;864] BUT THEY SAY, IF THE UNITED
[000:03:52;532] STATES DOESN'T INTERVENE NOW,
[000:03:55;435] BASHAR AL ASSAD'S REGIME WILL BE
[000:03:56;369] ENCOURAGED TO GO FURTHER AND
[000:03:57;704] THEY BELIEVE USE CHEMICAL
[000:03:58;371] WEAPONS AGAIN.
[000:04:05;511] OSAMA MOAS ARRIVED AT A CAMP
[000:04:07;413] WITH HIS WIFE AND 11 CHILDREN
[000:04:08;147] TODAY.
[000:04:08;715] HE TOLD US HE CAME TO HIDE FROM
[000:04:09;482] THE POISON GAS.
[000:04:09;949] AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO
[000:04:10;650] GO.
[000:04:14;420] >> Translator: IT IS A DIRTY
[000:04:15;121] REGIME HE SAID.
[000:04:15;888] >> Reporter: BUT THE MOST
[000:04:20;526] POWERFUL WORDS CAME FROM THIS
[000:04:23;997] 10-YEAR-OLD A MESSAGE SHE SAID
[000:04:24;731] SHE HAD FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.
[000:04:25;932] >> Translator: DOES HE WANT HIS
[000:04:26;766] KIDS TO BE LIKE US?
[000:04:27;367] AREN'T WE JUST LIKE THEM?
[000:04:28;101] WHEN WE GET BIGGER, WE ARE GOING
[000:04:29;435] TO WRITE, "OBAMA DIDN'T HELP US"
[000:04:30;203] SHE SAID.
[000:04:33;906] SECRETARY KERRY MADE IT CLEAR
[000:04:35;008] TODAY THE U.S. WANTS TO HELP.
[000:04:36;476] AND IS PREPARING TO ACT.
[000:04:41;614] >> THE IMAGES OF ENTIRE FAMILIES
[000:04:44;317] DEAD IN THEIR BEDS, HUMAN
[000:04:45;718] SUFFERING THAT WE CAN NEVER
[000:04:46;386] IGNORE OR FORGET.
[000:04:47;420] ANYONE WHO COULD CLAIM THAT AN
[000:04:48;254] ATTACK OF THIS STAGGERING SCALE
[000:04:49;589] COULD BE CONTRIVED OR FABRICATED
[000:04:51;291] NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR CONSCIENCE
[000:04:52;992] AND THEIR OWN MORAL COMPASS.
[000:04:57;096] >> Reporter: THE SYRIAN REGIME
[000:04:58;665] DENIES IT EVER USED CHEMICAL
[000:04:59;365] WEAPONS.
[000:05:00;967] SYRIAN REBELS TELL US THAT ASSAD
[000:05:03;536] HAS USED THEM AT LEAST 30 TIMES
[000:05:06;072] SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN AND THIS
[000:05:07;507] LATEST CASE WAS JUST THE MOST
[000:05:08;241] FLAGRANT.
[000:05:10;176] LESTER?
[000:05:14;681] >> RICHARD ENGEL IN TURKEY
[000:05:18;484] TONIGHT, THANKS.
[000:05:19;485] >>> THERE IS SOME LATE
[000:05:20;086] DEVELOPMENTS OUT OF WASHINGTON
[000:05:20;820] REGARDING POSSIBLE U.S. ACTION
[000:05:21;754] AGAINST SYRIA.
[000:05:22;855] ANDREA MITCHELL OUR CHIEF
[000:05:23;823] FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT.
[000:05:24;791] ANDREA, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
[000:05:25;658] TONIGHT?
[000:05:26;859] >> Reporter: OFFICIALS ARE
[000:05:27;827] TELLING ME, LESTER, THEY'RE
[000:05:28;661] GOING TO PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE TO
[000:05:29;662] BACK UP THEIR CONCLUSION IN
[000:05:30;630] COMING DAYS PERHAPS AS EARLY AS
[000:05:31;564] TOMORROW.
[000:05:32;565] ONE REASON JOHN KERRY WAS SO
[000:05:33;633] PASSIONATE TODAY, THE SCALE OF
[000:05:34;867] THIS ATTACK AND ITS BRAZEN
[000:05:35;835] QUALITY.
[000:05:36;803] WITH THOSE INSPECTORS ON THE
[000:05:37;870] GROUND THEY SAY A MILITARY
[000:05:38;971] OPTION WAS NOT AUTOMATIC.
[000:05:39;939] IF RUSSIA HAD CHANGED ITS POLICY
[000:05:40;907] OR SYRIA ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT IT
[000:05:47;413] HAD DONE, THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO
[000:05:48;748] PUNISH THE REGIME.
[000:05:49;982] SO FAR, THEY HAVE BRITISH,
[000:05:50;650] FRENCH, TURKEY ON BOARD.
[000:05:51;317] THEY HOPE THE ARAB LEAGUE WILL
[000:05:52;051] ENDORSE A LIMITED ATTACK NOT
[000:05:52;752] AIMED AT TOPPLING ASSAD BUT
[000:05:53;419] MAKING IT CLEAR THE USE OF
[000:05:54;087] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THIS SCALE
[000:05:54;821] IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.
[000:05:56;422] THEY HAVE PENTAGON PLANS ON THE
[000:05:57;190] SHELF FOR A WHILE.
[000:05:58;825] I'M TOLD THIS IS NOT IMMINENT.
[000:06:01;994] THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO ORGANIZE
[000:06:03;062] THE ALLIES, NOTIFY CONGRESS AND
[000:06:04;397] LIKELY NOT ATTACK WHILE THOSE
[000:06:05;498] U.N. INSPECTORS ARE STILL ON THE
[000:06:06;265] GROUND.
[000:06:07;066] THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO LEAVE
[000:06:07;734] SUNDAY.
[000:06:09;702] LEATHER?
[000:06:11;003] >> ALL RIGHT, ANDREA.
[000:06:11;571] THANKS.
[000:06:12;305] NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
[000:06:14;507] BECOME REFUGEES FLEEING THE WAR
[000:06:15;274] IN SYRIA.
[000:06:16;576] AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THERE
[000:06:17;510] IS A GRIM MILESTONE REACHED AS
[000:06:18;244] WELL.
[000:06:22;181] NEARLY ONE MILLION OF THOSE
[000:06:23;649] REFUGEES ARE CHILDREN, MOST
[000:06:24;317] UNDER THE AGE OF 11.
[000:06:25;385] NBC'S ANN CURRY MADE HER WAY
[000:06:26;119] TODAY TO ONE OF THE REFUGEE
[000:06:32;024] CAMPS, THE BIGGEST IN FACT.
[000:06:33;426] IT'S ON SYRIA'S BOARD WITH
[000:06:35;228] JORDAN.
[000:06:35;561] IT'S BURSTING AT THE SEAMS WITH

[000:06:43;636] SUFFERING IN AN APPARENT
[000:06:45;104] CHEMICAL ATTACK, THE WAR IN
[000:06:46;205] SYRIA APPEARS TO BE TURNING AN
[000:06:50;109] EMOTIONAL CORNER, CAPTURING THE
[000:06:51;511] ATTENTION OF THE WORLD.
[000:06:52;612] TODAY WE FOUND ONE SMALL SYRIAN
[000:06:53;946] BOY, ONE OF THE ONE MILLION.
[000:06:57;683] IN A CLINIC INSIDE JORDAN'S
[000:07:01;220] ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, WE FOUND
[000:07:03;022] JALAL, WHO BARELY ESCAPED THE
[000:07:03;756] WAR BACK HOME.
[000:07:06;159] [ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]

[000:07:19;872] RIDE BICYCLES HE SAYS.
[000:07:22;408] [ BOMB BLASTS ]
[000:07:24;310] BUT WAR CAME TO HIS HOMETOWN.
[000:07:28;214] [ GUNFIRE ]
[000:07:36;522] HE TELLS US "WE WERE NOT ALLOWED
[000:07:38;858] TO LEAVE THE HOUSE BECAUSE
[000:07:39;859] SNIPERS WOULD START SHOOTING AT
[000:07:40;593] US.
[000:07:41;227] THEY WOULD SLAUGHTER THE MEN AND
[000:07:41;994] CUT OFF THEIR FINGERS OR ARMS
[000:07:42;695] AND THROW THEIR BODIES INTO THE
[000:07:43;896] SCHOOLS."
[000:07:45;765] SIX WEEKS AGO PLAYING OUTSIDE
[000:07:46;866] WITH HIS 10-YEAR-OLD BROTHER AND
[000:07:48;901] FRIENDS, SOMETHING EXPLODED.
[000:07:50;837] JALAL WAS HIT BY SHRAPNEL AND
[000:07:52;438] WATCHED CLOSE FRIENDS DIE.
[000:07:56;042] >> Translator: ONE HAD HIS
[000:07:57;510] STOMACH CUT OPEN, HE SAYS, THE
[000:08:01;447] FIGHTING WAS AS CLOSE AS YOU ARE
[000:08:02;215] FROM US.
[000:08:02;715] WE CRAWLED ON OUR BELLIES OR
[000:08:03;416] RAN.
[000:08:03;916] WE FELL AND SCRAPED OUR KNEES.
[000:08:05;852] SOMETIMES WE WOULD START
[000:08:06;486] SHAKING.
[000:08:08;020] EVEN OUR MOTHERS STARTED CRYING.

[000:08:18;431] >> Translator: WHEN WE HEARD A

[000:08:21;234] CHILDREN TO CRAWL ALONG.
[000:08:21;868] THE ROAD.
[000:08:22;435] THANK GOD THEY LISTENED TO US
[000:08:23;169] AND THEY ARE SAFE.
[000:08:27;306] >> Reporter: THEY WALKED THREE
[000:08:28;741] DAYS LEAVING JALAL'S FATHER A
[000:08:30;776] COOK TO FIGHT AS A REBEL.
[000:08:31;644] THEY HEARD FROM HIM JUST ONCE
[000:08:32;378] SINCE THEY LEFT HOME.
[000:08:36;249] NOW JALAL'S MOTHER WEEPS FOR ALL
[000:08:37;550] THEIR LOST LOVED ONES.
[000:08:42;655] TODAY, SAFE IN THE CAMP, JALAL
[000:08:43;990] GETS A CHANCE TO BE A KID AGAIN.
[000:08:49;795] BUT AT NIGHT HE SAYS IT'S HARD
[000:08:50;530] TO SLEEP.
[000:08:52;331] HE DREAMS OF HIS FATHER AND
[000:08:53;065] CRIES.
[000:09:01;674] JALAL'S STORY IS ONE GLIMPSE
[000:09:03;009] INTO THIS WAR'S TRAGEDY FOR
[000:09:03;676] SYRIA'S CHILDREN.
[000:09:04;744] MEANTIME, THE CRISIS HAS

[000:09:48;087] THAT'S THE SMOKE BEHIND ME OFF
[000:09:50;289] THE TOP OF THE TREES AND ALSO
[000:09:51;023] THE BUILDING THERE.
[000:09:52;224] THE FIRE SERVICE FIRE CHIEF
[000:09:53;292] TELLS ME THIS IS THE TOUGHEST
[000:09:54;760] FIRE HE HAS FOUGHT IN HIS
[000:09:55;861] 30-YEAR CAREER.
[000:09:59;699] SUNRISE THIS MORNING IN
[000:10:01;667] TUOLUMNE, CALIFORNIA, BROUGHT
[000:10:02;401] RELIEF.
[000:10:03;836] THE TOWN WAS STILL STANDING.
[000:10:07;573] THE FIRE OVER THE RIDGE AND IN
[000:10:09;275] THE RIVER CANYONS BELOW
[000:10:10;109] STRETCHES SOME 200 SQUARE MILES
[000:10:11;210] INCLUDING YOSEMITE NATIONAL
[000:10:12;178] PARK.
[000:10:15;948] COMMANDERS THINK THEY'RE
[000:10:16;649] STARTING TO GET THE UPPER HAND,
[000:10:17;750] BUT IT IS ONLY 15% CONTAINED.
[000:10:21;287] WE ARE FACING RECORD FUEL, DRY
[000:10:23;222] CONDITIONS ACROSS THIS STATE.
[000:10:25;391] >> THE FIRE SHOT OVER HERE.
[000:10:26;726] >> Reporter: TUCKED BETWEEN THE
[000:10:28;794] TREES ON ROBIN HOOD WAY WE FOUND
[000:10:31;831] STRIKE TEAM 2276 ALPHA, FROM SAN
[000:10:32;598] MATEO COUNTY.
[000:10:34;233] IF THE FIRE COMES OVER THE HILL
[000:10:35;701] IT WILL BE ON TOP OF THEM AND
[000:10:37;269] THE HOMES THEY'RE PREPARED TO
[000:10:38;237] DEFEND WITHIN MINUTES.
[000:10:40;873] >> THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS.
[000:10:41;874] IT IS DANGEROUS.
[000:10:43;809] WE HAVE HAD 19 FIREFIGHTERS, HOT
[000:10:46;212] SHOT CREW, DIE JUST RECENTLY IN
[000:10:46;979] ARIZONA.
[000:10:50;683] FIRE IS UNPREDICTABLE.
[000:10:51;317] WHEN IT GETS IN THE TREE TOPS IT
[000:10:52;084] MOVES DIFFERENT THAN IT DOES ON
[000:10:52;818] THE GROUND.
[000:10:54;086] >> Reporter: THE CHALLENGE --

[000:11:03;262] IT HAS GOT WILDLIFE, LIKE THIS
[000:11:04;730] MOTHER AND CUB ON THE MOVE.
[000:11:07;299] BUT FOR THE CITY OF SAN
[000:11:08;734] FRANCISCO, SOME 150 MILES AWAY,
[000:11:11;170] THE CONCERN IS THE WATER SUPPLY.
[000:11:13;239] MOST OF WHICH COMES FROM THE
[000:11:14;573] HETCH HETCHY RESERVOIR IN THE
[000:11:16;242] FIRE ZONE.
[000:11:17;843] >> WHEN YOU BURN DOWN EVERYTHING
[000:11:19;645] YOU HAVE A MOONSCAPE OUT THERE
[000:11:21;480] THAT WITH FLOODS CAN CONTAMINATE
[000:11:22;248] THE WATERS.
[000:11:24;950] >> OH, MAN.
[000:11:26;552] >> Reporter: JUST OUTSIDE OF

[000:11:35;528] >> Reporter: ALL OF IT GONE.
[000:11:37;430] >> WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO

[000:11:48;574] FOR OUR GRANDKIDS AND THEIR
[000:11:49;508] GRANDKIDS CAN ENJOY IT.
[000:11:50;676] >> Reporter: MEANWHILE ACROSS
[000:11:51;410] THIS REGION, WHOLE TOWNS HAVE
[000:11:52;144] TURNED OUT TO THANK THE THOUSAND
[000:11:52;878] OF FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE COME
[000:11:53;579] FROM AS FAR AWAY AS SAN DIEGO
[000:11:54;280] AND THE OREGON STATE LINE.
[000:11:55;181] THE FIGHT CONTINUES.
[000:11:57;950] >> SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO PUT THIS
[000:11:58;718] FIRE OUT.
[000:12:00;986] UNLESS IT STARTS TO RAIN WE HAVE
[000:12:01;754] TO FIGHT THIS THING
[000:12:02;288] AGGRESSIVELY.
[000:12:04;023] >> Reporter: FIRE COMMANDERS
[000:12:05;324] THINK THEY'RE MAKING GOOD
[000:12:06;058] PROGRESS ON THIS FIRE.
[000:12:09;929] BUT THE AFTERNOON WINDS, BIG --
[000:12:16;102] THAT'S THE BIG VARIABLE, AND
[000:12:16;836] THEY'RE KICKING UP YET AGAIN.
[000:12:17;737] LESTER?
[000:12:19;138] >> A LOT MORE AHEAD ON A MONDAY
[000:12:19;905] NIGHT.
[000:12:20;206] FIGHTING OVARIAN CANCER ONE OF
[000:12:20;940] THE DEADLIEST FORMS.
[000:12:21;674] BECAUSE BY THE TIME IT IS FOUND
[000:12:22;441] IT IS OFTEN TOO LATE.
[000:12:23;275] NOW THERE IS A PROMISING NEW WAY
[000:12:24;043] THAT COULD CATCH IT EARLY.
[000:12:24;677] WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT.
[000:12:28;147] >>> LATER, HIGH EMOTION, AND ONE
[000:12:30;082] OF THIS NATION'S HIGHEST HONORS
[000:12:31;417] TODAY FOR A GENUINE AMERICAN
[000:12:32;118] HERO.
[000:14:54;860] >>> THERE IS ENCOURAGING NEWS
[000:14:55;594] TONIGHT TO SHARE ABOUT A SILENT
[000:14:56;362] KILLER OF WOMEN -- OVARIAN
[000:14:57;029] CANCER.
[000:14:57;963] IT KILLS 14,000 WOMEN EVERY YEAR
[000:14:58;797] AND MOST ARE DIAGNOSED TOO LATE
[000:15:00;132] FOR TREATMENT TO BE EFFECTIVE.
[000:15:01;333] TONIGHT THE LATEST RESULTS ON A
[000:15:02;902] STUDY OF A BLOOD TEST THAT COULD
[000:15:04;236] POTENTIALLY SAVE A LOT OF LIVES
[000:15:05;704] BY DETECTING THIS DISEASE MUCH
[000:15:06;438] EARLIER.
[000:15:08;974] HERE IS CHIEF MEDICAL EDITOR DR.
[000:15:09;742] NANCY SNYDERMAN.
[000:15:12;978] >> Reporter: WHEN LIZ DEGALLE
[000:15:14;546] MET LINDA NELSON TAYLOR THEIR
[000:15:15;748] FIRST YEAR IN COLLEGE, THE TWO
[000:15:16;482] QUICKLY BECAME BEST FRIENDS.
[000:15:19;752] >> SHE WAS ALWAYS A TRUE FRIEND
[000:15:21;687] AND A LOT OF FUN TO BE WITH.
[000:15:23;255] WE WERE LIKE SISTERS.
[000:15:24;823] AND IT WAS AN INSTANT
[000:15:25;457] FRIENDSHIP.
[000:15:28;227] >> Reporter: THAT BOND LASTED
[000:15:29;328] MORE THAN 20 YEARS UNTIL LINDA
[000:15:30;896] DIED OF OVARIAN CANCER AT THE
[000:15:31;630] AGE OF 43.
[000:15:35;000] IT IS A DISEASE NOTORIOUSLY
[000:15:37;069] DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AT AN
[000:15:37;770] EARLY STAGE.
[000:15:40;205] SO IN LINDA'S MEMORY, LIZ JOINED
[000:15:41;640] A STUDY AT M.D. ANDERSON CANCER
[000:15:43;976] CENTER FOLLOWING MORE THAN 4,000
[000:15:46;645] LOW-RISK, POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN
[000:15:52;851] OVER 11 YEARS USING A SIMPLE
[000:15:54;954] BLOOD TEST CALLED CA-120, A
[000:15:57;589] COMMON MARKER FOR OVARIAN
[000:15:58;257] CANCER.
[000:15:58;958] BY GIVING THIS BLOOD TEST YEARLY
[000:15:59;725] AND ROUTINELY TRACKING THE
[000:16:00;392] RESULTS, DOCTORS COULD PICK UP
[000:16:01;260] EARLY STAGES OF THE DISEASE WITH
[000:16:02;027] ALMOST 100% ACCURACY.
[000:16:04;063] >> IT IS ONLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT
[000:16:05;898] IT OVER TIME THAT IT STARTS TO
[000:16:07;232] BECOME MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AT
[000:16:09;168] PICKING UP EARLY STAGE DISEASE.
[000:16:10;736] >> Reporter: BASED ON THOSE
[000:16:12;304] RESULTS, SOME WOMEN HAD
[000:16:13;505] ULTRASOUNDS TO LOOK FOR A
[000:16:15;207] CANCEROUS MASS, AND IF
[000:16:17;042] NECESSARY, SURGERY.
[000:16:18;978] ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE STUDY,
[000:16:25;417] LIZ DEGALLE'S CA-125 NUMBERS
[000:16:29;288] WERE UP, AND SHE WAS DIAGNOSED
[000:16:30;022] WITH EARLY STAGE OVARIAN CANCER.
[000:16:30;789] >> I JUST THOUGHT I WAS TIRED.
[000:16:32;424] I HAD SOME PAIN, DIFFERENT
[000:16:33;258] PLACES, BUT NOTHING ON A REGULAR
[000:16:34;026] BASIS.
[000:16:35;327] >> Reporter: THAT IS COMMON.
[000:16:36;895] THE REASON SO MANY WOMEN AREN'T
[000:16:38;731] DIAGNOSED UNTIL THE CANCER HAS
[000:16:39;465] SPREAD.
[000:16:40;766] THE PROBLEM, SYMPTOMS ARE OFTEN
[000:16:42;368] VAGUE AND CAN MIMIC OTHER
[000:16:44;169] AILMENTS.
[000:16:45;371] THEY MAY INCLUDE ABDOMINAL
[000:16:47;439] DISCOMFORT, INCLUDING BLOATING,
[000:16:49;875] CRAMPS, CHANGES IN BOWEL HABITS,
[000:16:51;910] BACK PAIN AND ABNORMAL BLEEDING.
[000:16:54;446] DOCTORS SAY THERE MAY BE CAUSE
[000:16:56;048] FOR CONCERN IF ANY OF THESE LAST
[000:16:57;116] FOR MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS.
[000:17:03;589] WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING LIZ'S
[000:17:04;523] PROGRESS THE PAST FEW YEARS.
[000:17:06;191] SHE HAS HAD SURGERY AND
[000:17:06;825] CHEMOTHERAPY AND NOW IS CANCER
[000:17:07;559] FREE.
[000:17:08;861] IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF THIS
[000:17:09;695] TEST SHOULD BECOME PART OF YOUR
[000:17:11;397] ROUTINE CHECKUP, THE ANSWER FOR
[000:17:12;164] RIGHT NOW IS NO.
[000:17:13;565] BUT THERE IS AN EVEN BIGGER
[000:17:15;634] STUDY UNDER WAY IN THE U.K., IN
[000:17:17;703] TWO YEARS WHEN THOSE RESULTS ARE
[000:17:19;772] DUE THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY
[000:17:21;073] IS CA-125 SPECIFIC ENOUGH FOR
[000:17:24;476] WOMEN TO BE USED AS A ROUTINE
[000:17:25;310] SCREENING TEST.
[000:17:26;412] BUT WE ARE NOT THERE YET.
[000:17:28;447] AND I THINK OVER AND OVER AGAIN
[000:17:29;915] AS YOU AND I HAVE TALKED, IT'S
[000:17:31;850] THE HUMAN GENOME THAT WILL CRACK
[000:17:34;019] THIS OPEN NOT JUST SCREENING
[000:17:34;720] TESTS.
[000:17:35;754] THAT'S WHY WE DO THE BIG
[000:17:36;388] STUDIES.
