592
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
XELJANZ XR can lower your

601
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your doctor should perform blood
tests before you start

602
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and while taking XELJANZ XR,

603
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
and monitor certain liver tests.

604
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000

are common

tells you to,
