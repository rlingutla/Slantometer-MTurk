[000:00:00;20] SOVEREIGNTY OF CHINA, A  
[000:00:02;05] REPRESSIVE REGIME EVER

[000:00:08;10] "SPECIAL REPORT," FAIR,  
[000:00:09;18] BALANCED AND UNAFRAID.  
[000:00:15;20] >> Shepard: THIS IS THE FOX  
[000:00:16;19] REPORT.  
[000:00:17;04] TONIGHT, RED LINE CROSSED.  
[000:00:19;05] THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT DID  
[000:00:20;18] USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS  
[000:00:22;07] AGAINST OPPOSITION  
[000:00:22;28] FIGHTERS.  
[000:00:23;23] NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:00:24;24] CONSIDERING A MILITARY  
[000:00:26;16] MOVE.  
[000:00:27;07] PLUS, IT COULD HAVE  
[000:00:28;10] PREVENTED THE ATTACKS OF  
[000:00:29;21] 9/11.  
[000:00:31;01] THE FBI DIRECTOR ON THE  
[000:00:32;28] SECRET SURVEILLANCE  
[000:00:33;18] PROGRAM.  
[000:00:35;17] HE SAYS TRACKING PHONE  
[000:00:37;04] RECORDS COULD HAVE HELPED  
[000:00:38;03] THEM FIND ONE OF THE  
[000:00:40;03] HIJACKERS.  
[000:00:41;06] >> THAT'S SAFE HOUSE HAD A  
[000:00:42;21] TELEPHONE NUMBER BUT THEY  
[000:00:43;17] COULD NOT KNOW WHO WAS  
[000:00:44;25] CALLING INTO THAT  
[000:00:46;02] PARTICULAR SAFE HOUSE.  
[000:00:47;26] >> Shepard: BUT SOME  
[000:00:48;17] LAWMAKERS ARE NOT  
[000:00:49;18] CONVINCED.  
[000:00:50;03] >> I AM NOT PERSUADED THAT  
[000:00:52;29] THAT THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO  
[000:00:55;26] COLLECT EVERY CALL.  
[000:00:58;14] >> Shepard: WHAT ABOUT THE  
[000:00:59;08] GUY WHO LEAKED EVERYTHING.  
[000:01:00;03] >> HE IS THE SUBJECT OF AN  
[000:01:01;17] ONGOING CRIMINAL  
[000:01:02;25] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:01:03;12] >> Shepard: TONIGHT,  
[000:01:04;03] SURVEILLANCE, SECURITY, AND  
[000:01:04;29] A WHOLE LOT OF SECRETS.  
[000:01:08;25] >> Shepard: SHE WAS PERHAPS  
[000:01:09;24] DAYS FROM DEATH WHEN THE  
[000:01:11;13] CALL CAME IN.  
[000:01:12;15] THEY HAD FOUND A LUNG DONOR  
[000:01:13;23] AND THE TRANSPLANT WAS GOOD  
[000:01:15;11] TO GO.  
[000:01:16;05] >> THE SURGERY WAS VERY  
[000:01:17;17] VERY SUCCESSFUL.  
[000:01:19;07] >> Shepard: TONIGHT, AN  
[000:01:19;29] UPDATE ON THE BRAVE GIRL  
[000:01:20;26] WHO IS FINALLY BREATHING A  
[000:01:22;09] BIT EASIER.  
[000:01:26;27] [WHOO!  
[000:01:27;10] >> Shepard: BUT FIRST FROM  
[000:01:28;04] FOX THIS THURSDAY NIGHT.  
[000:01:29;03] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS U.S.  
[000:01:30;20] INTELLIGENCE HAS HIGH  
[000:01:31;20] CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN  
[000:01:32;19] PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD HAS  
[000:01:35;01] USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN  
[000:01:35;29] THAT COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR.  
[000:01:37;08] A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS  
[000:01:38;29] THE COUNTRY WILL NOW  
[000:01:41;01] PROVIDE MILITARY SUPPORT TO  
[000:01:42;21] SOME REBEL FIGHTERS.  
[000:01:44;14] ANALYSTS POINT OUT THAT  
[000:01:45;09] DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN  
[000:01:46;20] WEAPONS.  
[000:01:47;05] AND THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS  
[000:01:47;29] PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOT YET  
[000:01:49;08] MADE A DECISION ABOUT  
[000:01:51;15] ENFORCING A NO-FLY ZONE  
[000:01:52;23] OVER SYRIA.  
[000:01:53;25] A FULL NO-FLY ZONE WOULD  
[000:01:54;28] COST AN ESTIMATED  
[000:01:57;02] $50 MILLION A DAY:  THE  
[000:01:58;24] UNITED NATIONS NOW REPORTS  
[000:01:59;26] MORE THAN 90,000 PEOPLE  
[000:02:02;03] HAVE DIED SINCE THE  
[000:02:03;22] UPRISING BEGAN IN SYRIA  
[000:02:04;18] MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO.  
[000:02:05;24] BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID THE  
[000:02:06;20] USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS  
[000:02:07;24] WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER.  
[000:02:09;13] >> A RED LINE FOR US IS WE  
[000:02:12;18] START SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH  
[000:02:14;13] OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS MOVING  
[000:02:15;18] AROUND OR BEING UTILIZED.  
[000:02:17;09] THAT WOULD CHANGE MY  
[000:02:19;18] CALCULUS.  
[000:02:20;03] >> Shepard: TONIGHT, THE  
[000:02:20;26] WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT  
[000:02:22;15] CALCULUS HAS CHANGED.  
[000:02:23;11] NOW THE U.S. WILL TALK TO  
[000:02:24;25] CONGRESS AND U.S. ALLIES  
[000:02:27;01] ABOUT AMERICA'S NEXT MOVE.  
[000:02:28;26] LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON  
[000:02:30;11] FOX TOP STORY.  
[000:02:31;10] ED, WE ARE TO BELIEVE AFTER  
[000:02:32;17] TWO YEARS OF A CIVIL WAR  
[000:02:33;16] THERE IS NO PLAN FOR WHAT  
[000:02:34;25] TO DO NEXT.  
[000:02:35;22] >> SHEP THAT IS WHAT IS SO  
[000:02:37;19] CONFUSING ABOUT THIS  
[000:02:38;26] ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE WHITE  
[000:02:39;21] HOUSE.  
[000:02:40;04] ONE OF THEIR TOP AIDES HERE  
[000:02:41;18] BEN RHODES ANNOUNCED JUST A  
[000:02:43;05] SHORT TIME AGO THAT THIS  
[000:02:44;15] DOES CHANGE THE CALCULUS  
[000:02:46;16] THIS USE OF CHEMICAL  
[000:02:47;21] WEAPONS.  
[000:02:48;06] IT IS A GAME CHANGER.  
[000:02:49;12] CROSS THE RED LIGHT  
[000:02:50;22] WHATEVER WORDS YOU WANT TO  
[000:02:51;18] USE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS  
[000:02:52;13] USED BEFORE BUT THEN NOT  
[000:02:53;24] DIRECTLY SAY THAT THE U.S.  
[000:02:54;27] IS GOING TO HARM ARM THE  
[000:02:56;16] SYRIAN RENELS.  
[000:02:57;06] NOT CLEAR WHAT ACTION WILL  
[000:02:58;03] BE TAKEN.  
[000:02:58;25] WILL THE U.S. HELP ONE OF  
[000:03:00;08] OUR ALLIES ARM THEM SO WE  
[000:03:02;01] ARE NOT DIRECTLY ARMING  
[000:03:03;12] THEM.  
[000:03:03;25] THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS  
[000:03:04;21] WE HAVE TO ANSWER IN THE  
[000:03:06;06] DAYS AHEAD.  
[000:03:07;11] ANNOUNCEMENT FALLS SHORT OF  
[000:03:09;14] PRESIDENT'S CRITICS NOT  
[000:03:10;17] JUST ON THE RIGHT LIKE JOHN  
[000:03:12;13] MCCAIN BUT BILL CLINTON WHO  
[000:03:13;17] WE ARE LEARNING TODAY ON  
[000:03:15;04] TUESDAY NIGHT AT A PRIVATE  
[000:03:16;19] EVENT WITH JOHN MCCAIN  
[000:03:18;11] CRITICIZED THE OBAMA  
[000:03:19;16] ADMINISTRATION POLICY  
[000:03:20;07] SUGGESTING IT WAS TOO SLOW  
[000:03:22;03] THOUGH JAY CARNEY TODAY  
[000:03:23;00] TRIED TO BRUSH OFF THAT  
[000:03:24;14] CRITICISM.  
[000:03:25;00] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:03:25;18] >> A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE  
[000:03:29;21] EXPERTISE IN THE MATTER  
[000:03:32;29] BOTH OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT  
[000:03:33;27] AND IN CONGRESS AND INSIDE  
[000:03:35;20] OF GOVERNMENT HAVE  
[000:03:38;09] PERSPECTIVES TO ADD.  
[000:03:39;28] AND OPINIONS TO CONTRIBUTE.  
[000:03:43;04] AND AANALYSIS TO PROVIDE.  
[000:03:45;09] AND THE PRESIDENT WELCOMES  
[000:03:46;12] ALL OF THAT.  
[000:03:47;09] IN THE END, OF COURSE, HE  
[000:03:49;00] AND HIS TEAM HAVE TO MAKE  
[000:03:50;25] THE DECISIONS THAT THEY  
[000:03:51;23] BELIEVE ARE IN THE BEST  
[000:03:52;16] INTEREST OF THE UNITED  
[000:03:53;08] STATES AND THE AMERICAN  
[000:03:54;01] PEOPLE.  
[000:03:55;14] >> SO STILL WAITING ON  
[000:03:56;21] WHETHER IT WILL BE U.S.  
[000:03:57;26] MILITARY ACTION.  
[000:03:58;20] THAT DECISION BUT THE  
[000:03:59;12] DECISION ON WHETHER  
[000:04:00;14] CHEMICAL WEAPONS HAVE BEEN  
[000:04:01;18] USED, THAT HAS BEEN  
[000:04:02;26] DECIDED, SPECIFICALLY THE  
[000:04:04;04] ADMINISTRATION SAYING  
[000:04:05;10] TONIGHT THEY HAVE DIRECT  
[000:04:06;17] EVIDENCE THAT THE REGIME,  
[000:04:08;17] THE SYRIAN REGIME USED  
[000:04:10;26] SYRIAN GAS.  
[000:04:11;24] THAT IS A SPECIFIC KIND OF  
[000:04:13;13] CHEMICAL WEAPON AND THAT IT  
[000:04:14;16] KILLED ABOUT 150 PEOPLE.  
[000:04:16;00] IMPORTANT, BUT LET'S  
[000:04:16;26] REMEMBER AS YOU HAVE NOTED  
[000:04:17;29] THAT'S A SMALL NUMBER OF  
[000:04:19;14] PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED  
[000:04:20;28] COMPARED TO THE OVER WELL  
[000:04:23;20] OVER 90,000 THE U.N. SAID  
[000:04:24;19] HAS NOW BEEN SLAUGHTERED IN  
[000:04:26;00] THIS CONFLICT.  
[000:04:26;28] 150 IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT  
[000:04:27;28] BUT STILL, YOU KNOW, JUST A  
[000:04:29;23] SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET IN  
[000:04:30;28] THIS BROADER CONFLICT  
[000:04:32;17] SHEP.  
[000:04:33;00] >> Shepard: IT WAS THE  
[000:04:33;21] PRESIDENT WHO SAID THAT'S  
[000:04:34;15] THE RED LINE.  
[000:04:35;02] WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HEAR  
[000:04:35;26] FROM THE PRESIDENT.  
[000:04:36;17] >> WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE  
[000:04:37;20] STILL WAITING ON.  
[000:04:39;05] AND REPUBLICAN SAXBY  
[000:04:40;17] CHAMBLISS IS SAYING TONIGHT  
[000:04:41;28] LOOK, THIS IS NOT REALLY  
[000:04:43;00] MAJOR NEWS THAT THE  
[000:04:43;22] ADMINISTRATION IS NOW  
[000:04:45;14] SAYING CHEMICAL WEAPONS  
[000:04:46;20] WERE USED.  
[000:04:47;06] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY  
[000:04:48;01] HAVE SUSPECTED FOR A LONG  
[000:04:50;06] TIME.  
[000:04:50;19] WHAT HE SPECIFICALLY WANTS  
[000:04:51;29] SAXBY CHAMBLISS IS A NO-FLY  
[000:04:53;16] ZONE.  
[000:04:53;29] THE ADMINISTRATION TONIGHT  
[000:04:54;24] RULED THAT OUT AT LEAST FOR  
[000:04:55;26] NOW AND THAT'S NOT MAKING  
[000:04:57;14] CHAMBLISS HAPPY.  
[000:04:58;06] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:04:58;24] >> WE NOW KNOW THE CHEMICAL  
[000:05:00;12] WEAPONS HAVE BEEN USED FOR  
[000:05:01;21] ALMOST A YEAR BY THE SYRIAN  
[000:05:04;22] REGIME.  
[000:05:05;06] WE HAVE DONE NOTHING.  
[000:05:06;12] SO I THINK IT'S TIME THAT  
[000:05:07;21] WE ACT IN A VERY SERIOUS  
[000:05:10;00] WAY.  
[000:05:10;13] IF A NO-FLY ZONE IS WHAT  
[000:05:11;07] THEY DECIDED TO DO, THEN  
[000:05:12;25] I'M SURE OUR MILITARY IS  
[000:05:15;09] TAKING RIGHT PREPARATIONS  
[000:05:17;08] FOR CARRYING OUT A  
[000:05:18;06] SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AND I  
[000:05:19;02] WILL SUPPORT THAT.  
[000:05:20;11] >> SO WHEN WILL WE HEAR  
[000:05:22;09] FROM THE PRESIDENT?  
[000:05:23;19] WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ARE  
[000:05:24;12] SAYING TO US TONIGHT THAT  
[000:05:25;10] HE HAS THE G 8 SUBMIT IN  
[000:05:27;29] NORTHERN IRELAND NEXT WEEK.  
[000:05:29;19] MEETING WITH ALLIES LIKE  
[000:05:32;03] THE FRENCH THE BRITISH AND  
[000:05:33;17] OTHERS.  
[000:05:34;01] CONSULTING WITH THEM BEHIND  
[000:05:34;26] CLOSED DOORS AND PUBLICLY  
[000:05:37;07] TELLING THE WORLD WHAT THE  
[000:05:40;10] ARE THE NEXT STEPS.  
[000:05:42;05] >> Shepard: OPTIONS HAVE  
[000:05:42;27] BEEN DESCRIBED AS  
[000:05:43;17] POTENTIALLY ALL BAD.  
[000:05:45;00] MIGHT U.S. INTERVENTION  
[000:05:46;12] MAKE THINGS WORSE WOULD THE  
[000:05:48;11] RUSSIANS JOIN IN ON THE  
[000:05:49;03] SIDE OF THE SYRIAN  
[000:05:50;20] GOVERNMENT?  
[000:05:51;07] COULD THE CONFLICT EXPAND  
[000:05:52;00] ACROSS THE REGION?  
[000:05:52;22] JONATHAN HUNT'S REPORT ON  
[000:05:53;23] THIS GROWING CRISIS JUST  
[000:05:55;11] AHEAD.  
[000:05:55;25] FIRST THOUGH THE FEDS MIGHT  
[000:05:56;21] HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT  
[000:05:57;16] THE ATTACKS OF 9/11 IF THEY  
[000:05:58;28] HAD BEEN COLLECTING  
[000:05:59;27] MILLIONS OF PHONE RECORDS  
[000:06:00;27] BACK THEN LIKE THEY ARE  
[000:06:02;03] NOW.  
[000:06:02;15] THAT'S WHAT THE FBI  
[000:06:04;23] DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER  
[000:06:05;25] TOLD CONGRESS TED.  
[000:06:08;28] -- TODAY.  
[000:06:09;18] HE SAID THEY COULD HAVE  
[000:06:10;27] LINKED THE PHONE NUMBER  
[000:06:12;08] YEMEN TO ONE OF THE  
[000:06:13;24] HIJACKERS BEFORE 9/11.  
[000:06:14;19] >> THE OPPORTUNITY WAS NOT  
[000:06:19;29] THERE IF WE HAD THAT  
[000:06:22;20] PROGRAM THAT OPPORTUNITY  
[000:06:23;14] WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.  
[000:06:24;07] >> I'M NOT PERSUADED THAT  
[000:06:26;05] THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO  
[000:06:27;29] COLLECT EVERY -- EVERY  
[000:06:31;02] CALL -- IT'S MY FEAR THAT  
[000:06:32;13] WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF  
[000:06:34;28] BECOMING A SURVEILLANCE  
[000:06:38;16] STATE.  
[000:06:39;08] >> Shepard: IT WAS A  
[000:06:40;10] BRUISING DAY FOR SECRETARY

[000:06:43;04] ED SNOWDEN THE FORMER NSA  
[000:06:45;18] CONTRACTOR WHO SAYS HE  
[000:06:46;22] EXPOSED THE SURVEILLANCE.  
[000:06:47;26] HE IS HIDING THOUGHT HONG  
[000:06:49;00] KONG AN THREATENING TO  
[000:06:50;07] REVEAL WHAT HE SAYS ARE  
[000:06:51;06] MORE GOVERNMENT SECRETS.

[000:06:53;10] THIS PART OF THE STORY LIVE  
[000:06:55;27] FROM D.C. NEWSROOM.  
[000:06:56;23] >> ASKED WHETHER ED SNOWDEN

[000:07:07;25] THAT ARE JUST CAN DID CANDIDLY  
[000:07:10;08] NOT CORRECT.  
[000:07:10;25] AND CLEARLY THERE IS --  
[000:07:12;13] WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE  
[000:07:13;08] THAT THERE IS A THOROUGH  
[000:07:14;18] SCRUB OF WHAT HE IS  
[000:07:16;22] HIS CHINA CONNECTIONS ARE.  
[000:07:18;27] IT SEEMS UNUSUAL THAT HE  
[000:07:19;23] WOULD BE IN CHINA AND

[000:14:45;11] ON BENGHAZI.  
[000:14:46;06] I GUESS THE QUESTION WAS

[000:15:50;14] AND POWERFUL BLAST AT A  
[000:15:52;17] CHEMICAL PLANT IN  
[000:15:53;11] LOUISIANA.  
[000:15:54;12] HAPPENED THIS MORNING.  
[000:15:55;16] STARTED A FIRE THERE.  
[000:15:56;19] AND THAT BLAST WAS SO  
[000:15:58;12] STRONG THAT ONE MAN SAYS  
[000:15:59;28] THE GROUND SHOOK AT HIS  
[000:16:01;11] HOME SEVERAL MILES AWAY.  
[000:16:02;29] HE SAID IT FELT LIKE A

[000:16:11;15] ROUGE.  
[000:16:11;28] SEVEN FIRE DEPARTMENTS  
[000:16:12;20] RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.

[000:16:16;08] FAST AS THEY COULD.  
[000:16:17;26] >> THE LATEST NUMBERS ARE  
[000:16:20;03] THAT 73 INDIVIDUALS FROM

[000:16:22;10] TAKEN TO A VARIETY OF LOCAL  
[000:16:24;20] HOSPITALS.  
[000:16:25;07] AS OF NOW WE BELIEVE THAT  
[000:16:27;03] EVERY WORKER HAS BEEN  
[000:16:27;29] ACCOUNTED FOR.  
[000:16:31;02] >> Shepard: GOVERNOR JINDAL

[000:16:35;17] DOWN THE PLANT'S  
[000:16:36;27] OPERATIONS.

[000:16:41;27] THEY ALSO SAY THEY HAVE  
[000:16:43;03] BEEN MONITORING THE AIR  
[000:16:44;04] QUALITY AND SO FAR IT SEEMS  
[000:16:45;20] FINE.

[000:20:21;28] AND WILL TRY TO MAKE AN  
[000:20:24;05] IDENTIFICATION.  
[000:20:24;25] HERE IS WHAT THE SHERIFF  
[000:20:25;18] TOLD US WAS HAPPENING WITH  
[000:20:26;13] THESE TWO PEOPLE WHOSE  
[000:20:27;22] REMAINS WERE FOUND.  
[000:20:28;14] THEY BELIEVED THAT THESE  
[000:20:29;28] TWO PEOPLE WERE PACKING UP  
[000:20:31;12] AT THE TIME AND TRYING TO  
[000:20:32;20] GET OUT OF THE FIRE ZONE.  
[000:20:34;09] AND THE REASON THEY SAY  
[000:20:35;05] THAT IS THAT ONE OF THESE  
[000:20:36;13] FOLK WAS ON THE PHONE WITH  
[000:20:37;19] SOMEONE ELSE DISCIPLINING  
[000:20:38;20] WHAT THEY WERE DOING.  
[000:20:40;08] AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER  
[000:20:41;21] LINE SAID THAT THEY COULD  
[000:20:42;22] HEAR A POPPING IN THE  
[000:20:43;29] BACKGROUND AND THEN THEY  
[000:20:45;00] DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ELSE.  
[000:20:46;13] SUPPOSEDLY THESE FOLKS ARE  
[000:20:47;13] TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS  
[000:20:48;20] AREA.  
[000:20:49;15] NOW, WHAT THE SHERIFF  
[000:20:50;15] DESCRIBED THIS AREA IT WAS  
[000:20:52;18] INTENSELY HOT PLACE WITHIN  
[000:20:54;06] THE FIRE, SO THE FIRE IS  
[000:20:56;27] ITSELF HOT.  
[000:20:57;14] THIS WAS INAT THE BUS  
[000:20:58;07] STOPLY HOT AREA.  
[000:20:58;27] HE SAID THIS WAS AN AREA  
[000:20:59;22] WHERE THE TREES WERE  
[000:21:01;11] CROWNING.  
[000:21:01;26] WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE  
[000:21:02;26] FIRE WAS THEN TRAVELING  
[000:21:04;00] VERY QUICKLY ON THE TOPS OF  
[000:21:05;19] THE TREES.  
[000:21:06;12] SO IF YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO  
[000:21:07;20] GET OUT OF THAT AREA, IT  
[000:21:08;26] CAN BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IF  
[000:21:10;06] YOU ARE DOING THAT TOO  
[000:21:11;08] LATE.  
[000:21:11;21] IN TERMS OF A FIRE FIGHT,  
[000:21:13;01] THEY ARE SAYING IT'S ONLY  
[000:21:14;15] 5% CONTAINED BUT THEY ARE  
[000:21:15;17] DOING THE BEST THEY CAN TO  
[000:21:17;08] TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CLOUD  
[000:21:18;06] COVER AND SOME THE COOLING  
[000:21:19;11] TEMPERATURES AT THIS TIME.  
[000:21:20;07] BUT, YES, THIS HAS  
[000:21:22;01] DEFINITELY TAKEN A DEADLY  
[000:21:23;22] TURN.  
[000:21:24;06] AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.  
[000:21:25;07] THEY HAVE EVACUATED MORE  
[000:21:27;05] THAN 38,000 PEOPLE AT THIS  
[000:21:28;03] TIME.  
[000:21:28;16] AND SO MANY HOMES STILL  
[000:21:29;13] HAVE BEEN DESTROYED  
[000:21:31;27] SHEPARD?  
[000:21:32;12] >> Shepard: UPDATES AS  
[000:21:33;05] WARRANTED BACK TO IT ALICIA  
[000:21:34;28] ACUNA, THANKS.  
[000:21:35;17] A POPULAR NASCAR DRIVER IS

[000:21:49;13] BASICALLY WE ARE TOLD MINOR  
[000:21:50;20] LEAGUES FOR RACING.

[000:21:53;09] THE DRIVER FROM THE WRECK.  
[000:21:54;14] HE LATER WAS PRONOUNCED  
[000:21:56;14] DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL.  
[000:21:57;07] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED.  
[000:21:58;13] THIS HE WAS A TWO-TIME  
[000:22:00;03] WINNER ON THE NASCAR  
[000:22:01;16] NATIONWIDE SERIES.  
[000:22:02;19] FELLOW DRIVER TONY STEWART  
[000:22:03;21] TODAY CALLED HIM A GREAT  
[000:22:05;04] RACER AND AN EVEN BETTER  
[000:22:06;26] FRIEND.  
[000:22:07;10] AND IN A STATEMENT NASCAR  
[000:22:09;04] OFFICIALS SAY HE WAS A  
[000:22:10;29] FIERCE COMPETITOR AND THAT  
[000:22:11;24] THE RACING WORLD WILL

[000:29:47;28] COMING IN THE EYES OF MANY  
[000:29:49;23] SHEP.  
[000:29:50;06] ALTHOUGH THE DEPUTY  
[000:29:51;02] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

[000:30:10;01] THE MODERATE REBEL GROUPS  
[000:30:11;07] LISTEN.  
[000:30:16;00] IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT TO WORK

[000:30:59;23] RIGHT NOW A HUGE RANGE OF  
[000:31:04;04] OPTIONS.  
[000:31:04;19] THIS IS THIS IS HOW FAR THE  
[000:31:07;15] SECURITY ADVISOR WAS  
[000:31:08;05] WILLING TO GO.  
[000:31:09;04] LISTEN.  
[000:31:09;18] >> THAT INCLUDES MILITARY  
[000:31:11;27] SUPPORT.  
[000:31:12;12] I CANNOT DETAIL FOR YOU ALL  
[000:31:15;19] OF THE TYPES OF THAT  
[000:31:18;03] SUPPORT.  
[000:31:18;18] FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.  
[000:31:20;23] BUT, AGAIN SUFFICE IT TO  
[000:31:22;20] SAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE  
[000:31:24;27] DIFFERENT IN BOTH SCOPE AND  
[000:31:29;10] SCALE THE REBELS HAVE BEEN  
[000:31:30;10] ASKING FOR MORE  
[000:31:32;12] SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES.  
[000:31:33;07] THOSE ARE THE KIND OF  
[000:31:36;15] MISSILES THAT THE PROVIDING  
[000:31:38;01] TO THE SOVIET INVASION IN  
[000:31:40;06] AFGHANISTAN IN THE 1980S  
[000:31:41;07] AND WERE CREDITED WITH  
[000:31:42;11] CHANGING THE COURSE OF THAT  
[000:31:46;18] CONFLICT ANOTHER OPTION  
[000:31:47;12] WOULD BE ESTABLISHING THE  
[000:31:48;23] KIND OF NO-FLY ZONE THAT  
[000:31:50;08] NATO ENFORCED OVER THE  
[000:31:51;07] SKIES OF LIBYA.  
[000:31:54;05] ABOUT APPARENTLY ACCORDING  
[000:31:55;09] TO OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE  
[000:31:56;10] HOUSE AND BEYOND, THERE ARE  
[000:31:57;16] NO DECISIONS YET.  
[000:31:58;19] THE PRESIDENT WILL AMONG  
[000:32:07;14] THE WORLD LEADERS ATTENDING  
[000:32:09;15] WILL BE PRESIDENT PUTIN OF  
[000:32:11;11] RUSSIA.  
[000:32:11;25] HE MAY HAVE SOME VERY  
[000:32:13;00] STRONG THOUGHTS ON ANY  
[000:32:13;29] PROPOSALS TO DEEPEN U.S.  
[000:32:16;09] MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN HIS  
[000:32:17;27] ALLY SYRIA.  
[000:32:18;24] SHEP?  
[000:32:19;07] >> YEAH, IS HIS INDUSTRY  
[000:32:20;07] WOULD SUGGEST.  
[000:32:21;05] JONATHAN HUNT WOULD IN.  
[000:32:25;10] TWO IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS  
[000:32:26;13] FROM THE THE PRIME MINISTER

[000:32:30;04] AFTER VIOLENT AND DEADLY  
[000:32:31;19] PROTESTS STARTING UNFOLDING  
[000:32:32;22] THERE.  
[000:32:33;05] FIRST THE PRIME MINISTER  
[000:32:33;28] DELIVERED WHAT HE CALLED A  
[000:32:34;23] FINAL WARNING.  
[000:32:35;14] TELLING ALL THOSE  
[000:32:36;16] DEMONSTRATORS THAT HE AND  
[000:32:37;11] OTHER LEADERS HAVE RUN OUT  
[000:32:38;07] OF PATIENCE.  
[000:32:39;07] THOSE ACTIVISTS THOUGH ARE

[000:32:45;18] THE SENATOR ISTANBUL.  
[000:32:47;24] TURKISH STATE MEDIA  
[000:32:52;25] REPORTED PARK INTO A MALL.  
[000:33:04;06] THAT PLAN FIRST SET OFF ALL  
[000:33:06;10] THESE DEMONSTRATIONS.  
[000:33:07;12] AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE  
[000:33:08;23] REPORTED DEAD INCLUDING AN  
[000:33:09;20] OFFICER SINCE THE PROTEST  
[000:33:11;09] BEGAN.  
[000:33:11;23] THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE  
[000:33:12;18] SAID TO BE HURT.  
[000:33:13;08] DRUG COMPANIES CANNOT  
[000:33:15;10] PATENT OUR GENES.  
[000:33:17;03] IT'S A BIG LANDMARK  
[000:33:18;25] DECISION TODAY FROM THE  
[000:33:19;22] UNITED STATES SUPREME  
[000:33:20;18] COURT.  
[000:33:21;09] THE CASE INVOLVED A COMPANY  
[000:33:23;08] THAT PATENTED TWO GENES  
[000:33:25;17] WHICH ARE LINKED TO A  
[000:33:26;19] WOMAN'S RISK TO DEVELOPING  
[000:33:28;17] BREAST CANCER OR OVARIAN  
[000:33:30;22] CANCER.  
[000:33:31;06] THE ACTRESS ANGELINE NO  
[000:33:32;19] JOLIE SAID SHE HAD A DOUBLE  
[000:33:34;20] MASTECTOMY AFTER LEARNING  
[000:33:35;13] SHE CARRIED ONE OF THOSE  
[000:33:36;20] GENES.  
[000:33:37;03] AFTER TODAY'S RULING THE  
[000:33:39;03] DECIDED GENES ARE PART OF  
[000:33:40;20] NATURE.  
[000:33:41;04] BECAUSE SCIENTISTS FOUND  
[000:33:41;28] THEM DOES NOT MEAN THEY  
[000:33:43;02] CREATED THEM OR OWN THEM  
[000:33:47;14] SHANNON BREAM COVERS THE  
[000:33:48;08] COURT FOR US, SHE IS LIVE  
[000:33:49;20] IN WASHINGTON.  
[000:33:50;19] SHANNON.  
[000:33:51;04] >> MEDICAL RESEARCHERS SAY  
[000:33:52;08] WHEN IT COMES TO GENETIC  
[000:33:54;15] TESTING TODAY'S OPINION  
[000:33:55;07] WILL MAKE A WORLD OF  
[000:33:56;15] DIFFERENCE.  
[000:33:57;01] THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE ARGUED  
[000:33:57;25] THAT THE COMPANY EXCLUSIVE  
[000:33:59;22] HOLD ON THE GENE PATENTS  
[000:34:01;19] MADE TESTING INCREDIBLY  
[000:34:03;22] EXPENSIVE OUT OF REACH FOR  
[000:34:04;16] MOST PEOPLE AND PREVENTED  
[000:34:05;15] OTHER COMPANIES FROM  
[000:34:07;19] DEVELOPING LOWER COST  
[000:34:09;07] OPTIONS.  
[000:34:09;22] TODAY JUSTICE CLARENCE  
[000:34:10;14] THOMPSON WROTE WE WROTE  
[000:34:11;23] THAT A NATURALLY OCCURRING  
[000:34:13;22] D.N.A. SEGMENT IS A PROCESS  
[000:34:14;19] OF NATURE AND NOT PATENT  
[000:34:16;15] ELIGIBLE NEARLY BECAUSE  
[000:34:18;01] IT'S BEEN ISOLATED.  
[000:34:19;26] >> THE SUPREME COURT SENDS  
[000:34:21;06] A REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE  
[000:34:22;12] THAT OUR GENES, PARTS OF  
[000:34:23;28] OUR HUMAN BODY CANNOT BE  
[000:34:26;14] PATENTED.  
[000:34:26;29] THE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR  
[000:34:28;06] GENES IS TOO IMPORTANT TO  
[000:34:29;18] ALLOW ONE COMPANY TO  
[000:34:30;26] CONTROL ALL OF ITS USES.  
[000:34:33;08] >> THE JUSTICES DID  
[000:34:34;26] HOWEVER HOLD THAT  
[000:34:36;13] SYNTHETIC COPIES OF D.N.A.  
[000:34:37;18] CREATED IN A LAB ARE NOT  
[000:34:39;01] NATURALLY OCCURRING.  
[000:34:39;28] SO THEY CAN BE PATENTED.  
[000:34:42;11] MYRIAD SAID IT IS HAPPY THE  
[000:34:44;03] COURT UPHELD THE PATENTS ON  
[000:34:46;08] SYNTHETIC MATERIAL AND IT  
[000:34:47;25] REMAINS FOCUSED ON SAVING  
[000:34:48;27] AND IMPROVING PEOPLE'S  
[000:34:50;09] LIVES.  
[000:34:51;10] SHEP?  
[000:34:51;23] >> Shepard: SHANNON, STILL  
[000:34:52;17] WAITING FOR RULINGS ON  
[000:34:53;26] OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING  
[000:34:54;21] CASES DEALING WITH SAME SEX  
[000:34:56;05] MARRIAGE, AFFIRMATIVE  
[000:34:56;29] ACTION AND VOTING RIGHTS.  
[000:34:58;04] DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED  
[000:34:58;26] WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS.  
[000:35:01;10] WALL STREET CAME BACK IN A  
[000:35:02;19] HUGE WAY TODAY AFTER A  
[000:35:04;11] THREE-DAY LOSING STREAK  
[000:35:05;16] THE LONGEST OF THE YEAR.  
[000:35:07;00] THE DOW CLOSED UP AROUND  
[000:35:09;05] 180 POINTS.  
[000:35:09;21] THE NASDAQ UP IN HIGHER  
[000:35:11;29] PERCENTAGE AND THE S&P TOO.  
[000:35:13;10] ALL OF THIS AFTER THE  
[000:35:14;09] GOVERNMENT RELEASED  
[000:35:15;01] POSITIVE REPORTS ON HIRING.  
[000:35:16;27] AND RETAIL SALES.  
[000:35:18;27] LUNG TRANSPLANT SURGERY WAS  
[000:35:21;00] VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL.  
[000:35:23;00] FOR THE 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL  
[000:35:24;10] NAMED SARAH.  
[000:35:25;00] IN HER BATTLE AGAINST THE  
[000:35:26;08] DEADLY DISEASE CYSTIC  
[000:35:28;00] FIBROSIS, SHE HAS A LEG UP.  
[000:35:29;20] THAT'S THE WORD FROM HER  
[000:35:30;25] RELATIVES.  
[000:35:31;11] YOU WILL HEAR FROM THEM  
[000:35:32;04] ABOUT HER NEXT STEPS IN  
[000:35:33;19] TREATMENT AND THEIR  
[000:35:35;23] OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK.  
[000:35:36;16] PLUS LOOK AT THIS.  
[000:35:38;01] THE SAME STORM SYSTEM THAT  
[000:35:39;14] HAMMERED THE MIDWEST WITH  
[000:35:40;09] RAIN AND HAIL AND FUNNEL  
[000:35:41;20] CLOUDS YESTERDAY HAS  
[000:35:42;20] BROUGHT SWATTER SPOUTS TO  
[000:35:43;14] THE EAST COAST.  
[000:35:44;15] WORD OF A TORNADO ON THE  
[000:35:46;06] GROUND NEAR WASHINGTON,  
[000:35:47;10] D.C.  
[000:35:47;23] A LIVE REPORT FROM THE FOX  
[000:35:50;02] EXTREME WEATHER CENTER ALL  
[000:35:50;27] AHEAD AS FOX REPORTS LIVE  
[000:35:52;07] TONIGHT.
[000:36:53;27] OK, I AM COMING.  [ Susan ] I HATE
[000:36:54;23] THAT THE REASON  WE'RE ALWAYS STOPPING
[000:36:57;14] IS BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO  TO THE BATHROOM.
[000:37:00;10] AND WHEN WE'RE SITTING  IN TRAFFIC
[000:37:02;02] I WORRY I'LL HAVE AN ACCIDENT.
[000:37:06;13] BE RIGHT BACK.
[000:37:08;07] SO TODAY, I'M FINALLY  GOING TO TALK
[000:37:08;29] TO MY DOCTOR  ABOUT OVERACTIVE BLADDER
[000:37:12;02] SYMPTOMS.    [ Female Announcer ]
[000:37:14;01] KNOW THAT GOTTA GO FEELING?    ASK
[000:37:15;28] YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT    PRESCRIPTION
[000:37:16;20] TOVIAZ.    ONE TOVIAZ PILL A DAY 
[000:37:19;07] SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES   SUDDEN URGES
[000:37:20;00] AND ACCIDENTS    FOR 24 HOURS.   
[000:37:22;26] IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN    STOMACH PROBLEMS
[000:37:23;20] OR GLAUCOMA    OR CANNOT EMPTY YOUR
[000:37:25;26] BLADDER,    YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE TOVIAZ.
[000:37:28;09] GET EMERGENCY MEDICAL HELP    RIGHT
[000:37:29;01] AWAY    IF YOUR FACE, LIPS,    THROAT
[000:37:30;22] OR TONGUE SWELLS.    TOVIAZ CAN CAUSE
[000:37:32;14] BLURRED    VISION, DIZZINESS, DROWSINESS,
[000:37:35;23] AND DREASED SWEATING.    DO NOT DRIVE,
[000:37:36;23] OPERATE MACHINERY    OR DO UNSAFE
[000:37:37;14] TASKS    UNTIL YOU KNOW HOW TOVIAZ
[000:37:40;11] AFFECTS YOU.    THE MOST COMMON SIDE
[000:37:41;13] EFFECTS    ARE DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.
[000:37:44;14] [ Susan ]  TODAY, I'M VISITING MY
[000:37:45;04] SON  WITHOUT VISITING  EVERY SINGLE
[000:37:47;00] BATHROOM.    [ Female Announcer ]
[000:37:48;24] TODAY, TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR    ABOUT
[000:37:50;20] TOVIAZ.
[000:38:53;26] For all those who sleep
[000:38:54;12] too hot or too cool, and struggle
[000:38:56;05] to sleep comfortably together
[000:38:58;26] now there's a solution.
[000:38:59;25] Introducing Sleep Number DualTemp,the
[000:39:00;16] revolutionary

[000:39:04;25] with Active Air technology that
[000:39:06;17] works on any mattress, including yours.
[000:39:09;21] Whether you sleep hot or cool,

[000:39:20;04] Sleep Number.
[000:39:21;02] Comfort individualized.
[000:39:30;12] >> Shepard: TONIGHT WE'RE  
[000:39:32;04] MONITORING THE RECOVERY OF  
[000:39:32;28] A LITTLE GIRL WHO GOT A  
[000:39:33;20] LUNG TRANSPLANT AND THAT  
[000:39:34;12] GIRL'S FAMILY NOW SAYS ARE  
[000:39:35;05] A YESTERDAY'S SUCCESSFUL  
[000:39:35;28] SURGERY SHE COULD BE  
[000:39:36;19] RUNNING THE HALLS IN A  
[000:39:37;12] MATTER OF SWEEX.  
[000:39:39;00] INCREDIBLE REALLY.  
[000:39:39;22] JUST YESTERDAY, 10-YEAR-OLD  
[000:39:41;12] SARAH WAS IN A COMA AND  
[000:39:42;26] VERY CLOSE TO DEATH  
[000:39:43;22] ACCORDING TO HER FAMILY.  
[000:39:44;19] THEN A RELATIVE GOT THE  
[000:39:45;24] NEWS THEY HAD PRAYED THEY  
[000:39:47;05] WOULD HEAR.  
[000:39:47;24] A SET OF LUNGS WAS  
[000:39:49;13] AVAILABLE.  
[000:39:49;29] IT COULD SAVE HER LIFE.  
[000:39:51;08] DOCTORS PERFORMED A SIX  
[000:39:52;13] HOUR TRANSPLANT SURGERY AND  
[000:39:53;27] HER AUNT SAYS SARAH COULD  
[000:39:55;13] BE BREATHING ON HER OWN.  
[000:39:56;28] >> NOW SHE IS INTUBATED.  
[000:39:59;03] SHE HAS BEEN SINCE  
[000:40:00;00] SATURDAY.  
[000:40:00;15] THEY WILL PROBABLY TAKE  
[000:40:01;08] THAT TUBE OUT IN THE NEXT  
[000:40:02;05] 48 HOURS.  
[000:40:03;02] AND SO WE EXPECT HER TO GET  
[000:40:05;07] HER FIRST BREATH PRETTY  
[000:40:06;25] QUICK HERE.  
[000:40:07;16] IT HAPPENS PRETTY FAST.  
[000:40:08;29] THEY HAVE GOT THOSE GET  
[000:40:10;23] THOSE LUNGS WORKING AS FAST  
[000:40:11;28] AS THEY CAN.  
[000:40:12;18] >> SARAH HAS CYSTIC  
[000:40:15;28] FIBROSIS A GENETIC DISEASE.  
[000:40:18;06] TRANSPLANT WAS FRANKLY HER  
[000:40:19;14] ONLY HOPE.  
[000:40:19;29] THE RULES SAY YOU HAVE TO  
[000:40:21;25] BE 12 YEARS OLD TO GET ON  
[000:40:23;03] THE TRANSPLANT LIST.  
[000:40:24;04] SINCE THERE ARE SO FUEL  
[000:40:26;03] CHILD DONORS SARAH'S  
[000:40:27;20] PARENTS GOT TO THE JUDGE  
[000:40:28;22] AND THE JUDGE BENT THE  
[000:40:29;16] RULES SO SHE COULD GET AN  
[000:40:32;09] ADULT ORGAN.  
[000:40:32;27] THAT LIKELY SAVED THE  
[000:40:33;29] LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE.  
[000:40:35;18] THE GIRL IS NOT OUT OF  
[000:40:37;01] DANGER.  
[000:40:37;15] FAR FROM IT.  
[000:40:38;02] MORE WITH SOME HURDLES  
[000:40:39;27] AHEAD.  
[000:40:40;11] >> THERE ARE SHEP.  
[000:40:41;02] THE BIGGEST HURDLE IS THE  
[000:40:42;19] POSSIBILITY THAT HER BODY  
[000:40:43;19] MIGHT REJECT THE DONOR LUNG  
[000:40:44;26] AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS ON  
[000:40:46;02] MEDICATION TO PREVENT THAT  
[000:40:46;27] BUT THIS REALLY WILL BE A  
[000:40:48;21] LIFE-LONG PROBLEM FOR  
[000:40:49;23] SARAH.  
[000:40:50;07] WE SPOKE TO A LUNG  
[000:40:52;07] TRANSPLANT SURGEON WHO SAYS  
[000:40:53;05] OVER THE YEARS DOCTORS HAVE  
[000:40:54;18] GOTTEN VERY GOOD AT  
[000:40:56;09] REPLACING VITAL ORGANS BUT  
[000:40:57;18] HE ALSO CAUTIONED THAT IN  
[000:41:02;25] THESE TYPES OF SURGERIES  
[000:41:03;29] SOMETHING ALWAYS COMES UP.  
[000:41:05;20] LISTEN.  
[000:41:06;04] >> SWELLING OF THE LUNG.  
[000:41:08;02] LUNG BEING SLIGHTLY TOO BIG  
[000:41:09;18] OR TOO SMALL IN THIS CASE  
[000:41:11;11] IT MAY BE A LOWER LOBE  
[000:41:13;03] THAT'S PUT IN.  
[000:41:13;25] SO THERE HAVE A VARIETY OF  
[000:41:15;28] THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH  
[000:41:16;26] THE WAY THAT THE LUNGS ARE  
[000:41:18;16] SOWN IN.  
[000:41:19;20] THAT'S GETTING TO BE LESS  
[000:41:20;15] AND LESS COMMON IT DOES  
[000:41:21;25] HAPPEN ESPECIALLY SWHU A  
[000:41:23;22] ADVISE MISMATCH LUNG LIKE  
[000:41:27;19] THIS.  
[000:41:28;05] THAT DOCTOR SAYS WHEN THEY  
[000:41:29;12] PULL OUT THE BREATHING TUBE  
[000:41:30;24] HE BELIEVES E. BELIEVES  
[000:41:32;06] SARAH WILL TAKE FIRST DEEP  
[000:41:33;20] BREATH IN A VERY LONG TIME.  
[000:41:35;05] SHEP?  
[000:41:35;18] >> ANYTHING FROM HEALTH AND  
[000:41:36;13] HUMAN SERVICES?  
[000:41:37;01] >> YEAH.  
[000:41:37;17] THEY DID COMMENT BUT IT WAS  
[000:41:38;26] VERY SHORT AND IT DID NOT  
[000:41:40;08] MENTION SARAH'S CASE AT

[000:41:50;18] LIST.  
[000:41:51;01] THIS SERVES AS A REMINDER  
[000:41:51;27] ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF  
[000:41:55;06] ORGAN DONATION.  
[000:41:55;27] IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER  
[000:41:56;23] IF THIS WERE UP TO HEALTH  
[000:41:58;10] AND HUMAN SERVICES SARAH  
[000:41:59;17] WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN NEW  
[000:42:01;13] LUNGS.

[000:42:22;16] HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT TOO  
[000:42:25;05] DIFFICULT.

[000:42:41;18] PATIENTS INCLUDING SARAH DO  
[000:42:42;12] NOT RUN THE RISK OF HAVING  
[000:42:43;14] THEIR NEW LUNGS CLOG UP  
[000:42:44;29] BECAUSE THE NEW LUNGS DON'T

[000:49:15;15] SUBJECT TO U.S. PRIVACY
