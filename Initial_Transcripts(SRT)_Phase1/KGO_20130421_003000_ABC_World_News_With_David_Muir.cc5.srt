00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
MOTIVE BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?

191
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED?

192
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
WHERE DID THEY GET THAT

193
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TRAINING?
IMMIGRANTS FROM THE RUSSIAN

194
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
CAUCUSES, THE BROTHERS CAME WITH

THEIR PARENTS TO THE U.S. AS
CHILDREN.

196
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000

YOUNGER BROTHER DZHOKHAR, 19,

HAD JUST BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN,

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
IRONICALLY, ON SEPTEMBER 11th OF

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
>> I CERTAINLY CAN'T PUT IT

207
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
TOGETHER THAT HE WAS A PERSON

TAMERLAN IN 2011 BASED ON A TIP

FROM THE RUSSIANS.

214
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE RUSSIANS SAID HE WAS A

215
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
RADICAL ISLAMIST, PREPARING TO

216
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
LEAVE THE U.S., POSSIBLY FOR A

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
TRIP TO THE CAUCUSES.

218
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AFTER LOOKING INTO TAMERLAN'S

BY LAW, FBI OFFICIALS SAID,

222
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
MONITORING HAD TO STOP, BARRING

223
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
NEW NEGATIVE INFORMATION.

224
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000

AREN'T PARTICULARLY KIND TO

229
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
AMERICANS, BUT THAT'S NOT
AGAINST THE LAW HERE.

230
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
>> Reporter: TAMERLAN'S FATHER

231
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
SAID HIS SONS COULDN'T HAVE

232
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
PLANNED THE ATTACK, BECAUSE THEY

233
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
KNEW THE FBI WAS WATCHING THEM.

234
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
BUT THEY APPARENTLY WERE NOT.

235
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
AND NEVER KNEW THAT A DARK SIDE

236
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000

237
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
EMERGE.

238
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
TAMERLAN WAS CHARGED IN

"A DECADE IN AMERICA ALREADY, I

247
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WANT OUT."

248
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
AUTHORITIES NEVER SAW THIS

249
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
COMING.

250
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
TAMERLAN TRAVELED TO RUSSIA FOR

251
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR.

252
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THE FBI WANTS TO KNOW EXACTLY

253
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WHO HE SAW AND WHAT HE WAS
DOING, DAN.

254
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
>> LET ME GET BACK TO THE FBI

INVESTIGATION INTO THE OLDER
BROTHER.

YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE FBI

257
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ALL DAY.
ARE THEY NOT EXPECTING ANY SENSE

258
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
OF FRUSTRATION OR REMORSE OVER

259
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
HAVING MISSED WHAT COULD HAVE
BEEN A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE?

260
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> THEY'LL DO A POSTMORTEM,

261
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
WHICH IS NORMAL IN THESE CASES,

262
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
BUT THEY SAID THEY DID WHAT THE

263
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
LOU AND THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS.
>> PIERRE, THANK YOU.

264

UP, AND THAT HER ELDEST SON WAS

278
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
INVESTIGATED BECAUSE HE LOVED

279
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ISLAM AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
BAD.

OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO TURN THE

282

E WASN'T TOO RELIGIOUS, THIS

290
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
NEIGHBOR IT IS ABOUT THE FATHER.
THERE WAS NO FANATICISM.

291
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
BUT IT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO ON A

292
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
FEW WERE WILLING TO TALK.

WE APPRECIATE IT.

316
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OLDER

317
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
BROTHER'S TRIP TO RUSSIA.
WE KNOW THERE ARE ISLAMIC

318
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
MILITANTS IN THIS PART OF

319
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
RUSSIA, BUT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE

320
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
ANY HISTORY OF ATTACKING

321
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
AMERICA?

322
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> NOT THE CHECHENS.

323
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THEY HAVE NO HISTORY OF

324
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
ATTACKING THE AMERICA.

325
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WHAT INVESTIGATORS WILL WANT TO
FIND OUT IS WHETHER HE WENT TO

326
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SOME SORT OF TRAINING CAMP, SOME

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
RADICAL TRAINING CAMP THAT DID

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
HAVE A BEEF WITH AMERICA.

329
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
WHO FUNDED HIM, IF HE HAD ANY

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SORT OF EXTRA FUNDING.

331
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
DID HE LEARN HOW TO BUILD THOSE

332
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BOMBS THERE, OR DID HE BUILD

333
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THEM ON THE INTERNET?

334
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL BE LOOKING

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
AT AND THEY WILL INTERVIEW

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
EVERYBODY THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO

337
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
SEE WHERE THOSE DARK MONTHS LED.

338
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
>> IF THEY RULE OUT SOME SORT OF

339
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
FOREIGN PLOT, AND THAT'S A BIG
IF AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD MAKE

340
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THESE TWO BROTHERS, ASSUMING

341
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THEY'RE PROVEN TO BE GUILTY, IT

342
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WOULD MAKE THEM LONE WOLVES,

343
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT, HAS

344
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
BEEN KEEPING UP NATIONAL

345
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT FOR YEARS NOW.

346
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
>> YES, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE

347
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
LONE WOLF, WHO THEY BELIEVE

348
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
PROBABLY CONVINCED HIS BROTHER

349
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TO BE ANOTHER ONE, THEN YOU

350
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE REST OF

351
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THEM ARE.

352
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WHAT WILL INSPIRE THEM, HOW THEY

353
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
MIGHT GET RADICALIZED.

354
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THAT'S A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.

355
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
>> THANK YOU, MARTHA.

356
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000

WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

457
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.

458
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

459

STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

200MG CELEBREX A DAY

463

CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

464
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000

AND INFLAMMATION.

PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

466
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

467
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

468
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN
WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD.

469
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

470
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS

471
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
WITH THE RISKS.

472
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000

NAPROXEN AND MELOXICAM

474
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

475
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

476
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

477
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

478
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
OR RISK FACTORS
SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

479
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
FOR LONG PERIODS.

480
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,

481
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS

482
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

483
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

484
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.

PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
AND THE ELDERLY

486
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000

STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.

487

DON'T TAKE CELEBREX

488

IF YOU HAVE BLEEDING
IN THE STOMACH OR INTESTINE,

489

For faster relief, try Dulcolax
