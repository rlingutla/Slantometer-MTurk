657
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
here's a question:
Who wouldn't want a chance

OPDIVO demonstrated longer

Over 40,000 of these
patients have been

664

prescribed OPDIVO.

665
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
OPDIVO works with
your immune system.

666
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
OPDIVO can cause your immune
system to attack normal

667
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
organs and tissues in your
body and affect how they work.

668
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This may happen any time
during or after treatment

669
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000

serious and lead to death.

670

671

these problems

680

These are not
all the possible

of OPDIVO.

683
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Tell your doctor about all
your medical conditions,

684
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
including immune
system problems,

685
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
or if you've had an
organ transplant,

686
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
or lung, breathing,
or liver problems.

687
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because who
wouldn't want...that?

688

about OPDIVO.

the doctor's office,

But why go back there,
when you can stay home...

...with Neulasta Onpro?

800
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Strong chemo can put you
at risk of serious infection.

801
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Neulasta helps
reduce infection risk

802
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
by boosting your
white blood cell count,

803
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
which strengthens
your immune system.

804
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
In a key study,

805
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Neulasta reduced the risk
of infection from 17% to 1%...

806
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
...a 94% decrease.

807

Neulasta Onpro is designed to

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Neulasta is for
certain cancer patients

811
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Do not take Neulasta
if you're allergic to

serious, sometimes
fatal crises can occur.

823
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
