[000:00:01;651] TAG DAILY BRIEFING ON INSTAGRAM
[000:00:03;987] OR POST ON FACEBOOK.
[000:00:04;821] THANKS FOR JOINING US.
[000:00:06;990] I'M DANA PERINO.
[000:00:08;291] HERE'S SHEPARD SMITH.
[000:00:14;764] >> Shepard: IT'S 3:00 ON THE
[000:00:16;833] EAST COAST.
[000:00:17;467] NOON IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:00:18;835] INVESTIGATORS HAVE REVEALED
[000:00:20;070] STUNNING NEWS ABOUT THE CONCERT
[000:00:25;542] KILLER.
[000:00:25;875] FROM HIS APPARENT ESCAPE PLAN
[000:00:26;643] AND HIS INTEREST IN OTHER MUSIC
[000:00:27;811] FESTIVALS TO HIS MYSTERIOUS
[000:00:29;646] PAST.
[000:00:29;946] >> STEPHEN PADDOCK IS A MAN THAT
[000:00:30;714] SPENT DECADES ACQUIRING WEAPONS
[000:00:33;216] AND AMMO AND LIVING A SECRET
[000:00:35;618] LIFE.
[000:00:35;919] MUCH OF WHICH WILL NEVER BE
[000:00:37;654] FULLY UNDERSTOOD.
[000:00:38;188] >> INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING TO
[000:00:40;457] UNRAVEL HIS STORY AND WHETHER HE
[000:00:42;826] HAD HELP.
[000:00:43;193] WE'RE ALSO HEARING ABOUT THE
[000:00:44;494] FIRE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST
[000:00:46;162] RESPONDERS THAT RISKED THEIR
[000:00:47;197] LIVES TO SAVE CIVILIANS ON THE
[000:00:48;865] NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING.
[000:00:49;866] POLICE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THE
[000:00:51;301] WHITE HOUSE WEIGHING IN ON A
[000:00:58;007] CONTROVERSIAL GUN DEVICE WHICH
[000:00:58;775] MAY HAVE HELPED THE VEGAS
[000:00:59;442] SHOOTER CARRY OUT HIS MADNESS.
[000:01:00;176] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:04;547] AND FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK
[000:01:05;682] THIS THURSDAY AFTERNOON, THE
[000:01:07;417] WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S OPEN TO
[000:01:09;185] THE IDEA OF REGULATING BUMP
[000:01:11;521] STOCKS.
[000:01:11;855] THOSE ARE THE DEVICES THAT THE
[000:01:13;590] SHOOTER IN LAS VEGAS APPARENTLY
[000:01:14;891] USED TO ALLOW HIS RIFLES TO FIRE
[000:01:17;460] MUCH LIKE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
[000:01:18;995] IT COMES JUST AFTER THE NATIONAL
[000:01:20;930] RIFLE ASSOCIATION CALLED ON THE
[000:01:23;133] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW
[000:01:24;968] WHETHER BUMP STOCKS COMPLY WITH
[000:01:29;539] THE LAW.
[000:01:29;873] IN A STATEMENT LEADERS OF THE
[000:01:30;573] GUN RIGHTS GROUP WROTE "THE NRA
[000:01:31;374] BELIEVES THAT DEVICES DESIGNED
[000:01:32;275] TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES TO
[000:01:34;644] FUNCTION LIKE FULLY AUTOMATIC
[000:01:36;279] RIFLES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO
[000:01:38;148] ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS."
[000:01:40;150] MORE AHEAD ON THE TRUMP
[000:01:41;184] ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THE
[000:01:42;719] MASSACRE IN VEGAS.
[000:01:43;887] WE'RE LEARNING THE GUNMAN MAY
[000:01:45;889] HAVE HAD OTHER TARGETS IN MIND.
[000:01:47;757] THAT'S THE WORD FROM THE
[000:01:50;593] INVESTIGATORS.
[000:01:51;027] THEY SAY STEPHEN PADDOCK RENTED
[000:01:51;828] ROOMS OVERLOOKING TWO OTHER
[000:01:53;563] MUSIC FESTIVALS.
[000:01:55;064] ONE IN LAS VEGAS THE WEEKEND
[000:01:57;100] BEFORE THIS SHOOTING AND ANOTHER
[000:01:59;402] IN LAST AUGUST IN CHICAGO DURING
[000:02:01;271] THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC FESTIVAL.
[000:02:04;374] THERE'S REPORTS THAT PADDOCK
[000:02:05;441] SCOUTED OUT HOTELS IN FENWAY
[000:02:07;110] PARK IN BOSTON AND WE'RE
[000:02:08;511] LEARNING HE MIGHT HAVE PLANNED
[000:02:09;579] TO ESCAPE AFTER THE VEGAS
[000:02:11;281] ATTACK.
[000:02:11;948] THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF
[000:02:12;982] WHO DIDN'T GIVE ANY OTHER
[000:02:14;818] DETAILS.
[000:02:15;151] POLICE SAY THE GUNMAN KILLED
[000:02:16;653] HIMSELF IN HIS HOTEL ROOM AS
[000:02:19;255] SWAT UNITS CLOSED IN.
[000:02:22;025] HE KILLED 58 PEOPLE AND INJURED
[000:02:24;494] HUNDREDS MORE AT THE COUNTRY
[000:02:26;896] MUSIC FESTIVAL ACROSS THE
[000:02:30;099] STREET.
[000:02:30;667] INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY'RE STILL
[000:02:32;569] STRUGGLING WHY HE DID THIS.
[000:02:33;269] FBI AGENTS QUESTIONED THE
[000:02:36;105] GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND YESTERDAY.
[000:02:37;240] HER LAWYER SAYS SHE HAD NO IDEA
[000:02:39;676] WHAT STEPHEN PADDOCK WAS
[000:02:41;611] PLANNING WHEN HE SENT HER TO THE
[000:02:43;780] PHILIPPINES TO BE WITH HER
[000:02:44;948] FAMILY.
[000:02:45;281] SHE SAID WHEN HE SENT HER
[000:02:47;050] $100,000 AND TOLD HER TO BUY A
[000:02:49;085] HOUSE, SHE THOUGHT HE WAS
[000:02:50;019] BREAKING UP WITH HER.
[000:02:51;588] WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE.
[000:02:53;590] LET'S BEGIN WITH KEVIN CORKE AT
[000:02:55;091] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:02:56;826] KEVIN?
[000:02:57;126] >> THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO
[000:02:58;294] MAINTAIN A LASER-LIKE FOCUS ON
[000:02:59;929] THE HEALING AND THE AFTER MATH
[000:03:01;531] OF THE DEVASTATION IN NEVADA BUT
[000:03:02;866] THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE
[000:03:07;804] FACT THAT THERE'S QUESTIONS,
[000:03:08;571] ESPECIALLY ABOUT AS WHAT YOU
[000:03:09;272] JUST LAID OUT, THE BUMP STOCK
[000:03:10;039] THAT WAS USED IN THIS ASSAULT ON
[000:03:12;175] SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES IN THE
[000:03:13;843] NEVADA DESERT.
[000:03:14;644] WE HEARD FROM SARAH SANDERS NOT
[000:03:16;846] LONG AGO.
[000:03:17;380] SHE SAID THIS AS FAR AS THE
[000:03:20;116] ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW OF A
[000:03:21;084] POSSIBLE BAN.
[000:03:21;784] >> OUR FOCUS, AS WE SAID THE
[000:03:24;153] LAST COUPLE DAYS, HAS BEEN ON
[000:03:25;688] HEALING AND UNITING THE COUNTRY.
[000:03:28;124] THE INVESTIGATION STILL
[000:03:29;726] CONTINUES TO BE IN VERY EARLY
[000:03:31;661] STAGES.
[000:03:31;995] WE KNOW THAT BOTH MEMBERS OF
[000:03:34;364] BOTH PARTIES IN MULTIPLE
[000:03:39;836] ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING TO
[000:03:40;603] TAKE A LOOK AT BUMP STOCKS AND
[000:03:41;404] RELATED DEVICES.
[000:03:41;905] WE WELCOME THAT.
[000:03:42;572] >> GOT TO DO IT.
[000:03:43;740] HAVE TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK
[000:03:45;308] AT IT.
[000:03:46;209] WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY
[000:03:47;543] CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS CAN
[000:03:49;512] UNPACK SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
[000:03:50;813] SHEPARD.
[000:03:51;314] >> Shepard: KEVIN, THE WHITE
[000:03:52;348] HOUSE WEIGHING IN ON THE REPORT
[000:03:54;584] THAT SECRETARY OF STATE REX
[000:03:55;818] TILLERSON THREATENED TO RESIGN
[000:03:56;853] AND CALLED THE PRESIDENT A
[000:03:59;455] MORON.
[000:04:00;790] THE REPORTING IS FROM CARROLL
[000:04:03;660] LEE FROM NBC NEWS.
[000:04:05;328] AT A CONFERENCE YESTERDAY,
[000:04:07;530] SECRETARY TILLERSON NEVER
[000:04:10;400] CONSIDERED QUITTING BUT HE
[000:04:11;434] DIDN'T DEFLY HE CALLED THE
[000:04:13;002] PRESIDENT A MORON.
[000:04:14;103] HE DENY IT A FEW HOURS LATER
[000:04:16;339] THROUGH A SPOKESMAN.
[000:04:17;941] HERE'S THE EXCHANGE.
[000:04:18;908] >> WAS THE PRESIDENT UPSET THAT
[000:04:21;611] HIS SECRETARY OF STATE DIDN'T
[000:04:22;345] DENY CALLING HIM A MORON IN HIS
[000:04:24;514] PUBLIC REMARKS YESTERDAY?
[000:04:26;182] >> AS THE SECRETARY STATE SAID,
[000:04:27;583] THIS IS A PETTY RIDICULOUS
[000:04:30;653] ACCUSATION.
[000:04:31;220] FRANKLY I THINK IT'S BENEATH THE
[000:04:34;157] SECRETARY OF STATE TO WEIGH-IN
[000:04:34;924] ON EVERY RUMOR OUT THERE.
[000:04:36;759] HIS SPOKESPERSON, HOWEVER, DID
[000:04:39;195] COME OUT
[000:04:39;195] AND CLARIFY THAT THE
[000:05:01;217] SECRETARY OF STATE HAS NEVER
[000:05:01;918] USED THOSE WORDS.
[000:05:02;418] >> Shepard: BACK TO KEVIN CORKE
[000:05:03;186] AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:05:03;720] KEVIN, CAROL LEE IS A
[000:05:04;287] WELL-RESPECTED JOURNALIST THAT
[000:05:05;021] SAYS SHE HAS MORE THAN TEN
[000:05:05;688] SOURCES ON THE MATTER BUT THE
[000:05:06;389] PUSH-BACK IS STRONG.
[000:05:06;923] >> HERE'S MORE OF WHAT SARAH
[000:05:07;623] SANDERS HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE
[000:05:08;324] PRESIDENT'S ACCUSATION THAT THIS
[000:05:09;058] IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF FAKE NEWS.
[000:05:09;792] >> THE PRESIDENT HAS A GREAT
[000:05:10;493] FRUSTRATION WITH THE FACT THAT A
[000:05:11;294] LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE INACCURATE
[000:05:13;730] INFORMATION THAT IS BEING
[000:05:15;865] PRESENTED AS FACTUAL.
[000:05:17;500] A LOT OF TIMES OPINIONS ARE
[000:05:19;602] BEING PRESENTED AS NEWS AND
[000:05:20;837] THEY'RE NOT.
[000:05:21;437] THAT IS A REAL CONCERN AND
[000:05:23;539] SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED
[000:05:24;974] AT.
[000:05:25;241] >> HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ON THIS IF
[000:05:26;476] YOU'RE SARAH SANDERS.
[000:05:28;644] YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN ALSO
[000:05:30;680] COME OUT OF THE CONVERSATION
[000:05:32;482] ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A
[000:05:33;950] REPORTER OF THE ESTEEM OF CAROL
[000:05:36;452] LEE.
[000:05:36;919] >> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:37;954] WALKING BACK COMMENTS FROM
[000:05:39;255] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:05:39;889] HE TOLD FOX NEWS HE MIGHT HAVE
[000:05:42;992] TO WIPE OUT PUERTO RICO'S TENS
[000:06:01;310] OF MILLIONS IN DEBT TO HELP
[000:06:02;045] RECOVER FROM HURRICANE MARIA.
[000:06:02;745] BUT MAYBE NOT.
[000:06:03;179] KEVIN CORKE IS AT THE WHITE
[000:06:03;846] HOUSE.
[000:06:04;147] I DON'T KNOW.
[000:06:04;580] THERE'S CONFUSION ON THIS.
[000:06:05;214] >> YEAH, THERE'S CONFUSION.
[000:06:05;882] AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, THE
[000:06:06;516] PRESIDENT WILL MAKE A COMMENT,
[000:06:07;250] BUT IT'S SORT OF OFF THE CUFF.
[000:06:07;950] DOES IT EQUAL POLICY?
[000:06:08;518] HERE AGAIN IS SARAH SANDERS ON
[000:06:09;252] TRYING TO MAKE MOST SENSE, IF
[000:06:09;952] SHE CAN, OUT OF WHAT THE
[000:06:10;586] PRESIDENT SAID PREVIOUSLY.
[000:06:11;254] >> RIGHT NOW, THE PRIMARY FOCUS
[000:06:12;955] IS TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO PUERTO
[000:06:14;724] RICO AND SUPPORT IN THE
[000:06:16;959] REBUILDING EFFORTS.
[000:06:21;798] WHILE WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH
[000:06:22;665] THE IMMEDIATE DISASTER, IT ISN'T
[000:06:23;433] INAPPROPRIATE TO FOCUS ON THE
[000:06:24;200] DIFFICULTIES THAT PUERTO RICO
[000:06:24;934] WAS DEALING WITH BEFORE THE
[000:06:26;235] STORM.
[000:06:26;602] THERE'S A PROCESS FOR HOW TO
[000:06:29;272] DEAL WITH PUERTO RICO'S DEBT.
[000:06:30;373] IT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT
[000:06:32;809] PROCESS TO HAVE A LASTING
[000:06:33;976] RECOVERY AND GROWTH.
[000:06:34;710] THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WAS PUT
[000:06:36;946] IN PLACE AND SET UP UNDER OBAMA.
[000:06:38;781] THAT HAS A BOARD OF ADVISERS
[000:06:40;450] THAT DEALS WITH THAT DEBT AND IT
[000:06:41;717] WILL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS.
[000:06:43;186] >> I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE BACK
[000:06:45;788] AND FORTH ON THIS, SHEPARD,
[000:06:51;060] BLAKE BURMAN IN PARTICULAR.
[000:06:51;761] SEEMS THE PRESIDENT MADE A
[000:06:52;929] STATEMENT THAT HAD TO BE WALKED
[000:06:55;331] BACK.
[000:06:55;865] MAYBE HIS PRAISE FOR WHAT COULD
[000:06:57;100] HAPPEN DOESN'T LINE UP WITH
[000:06:58;601] WHERE THE DOLLARS MAY END UP.
[000:07:00;336] SHEPARD?
[000:07:00;670] >> KEVIN CORKE AT THE WHITE
[000:07:02;171] HOUSE.
[000:07:03;439] "THE WASHINGTON POST" IS
[000:07:04;640] REPORTING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:07:05;508] PLANS TO ANNOUNCE NEXT WEEK THAT
[000:07:07;577] HE WILL DE-CERTIFY THE
[000:07:15;218] INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR DEAL WITH
[000:07:17;954] IRAN.
[000:07:18;254] >> "THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS HE
[000:07:19;956] WILL WALK AWAY FROM IT.
[000:07:21;257] BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.
[000:07:26;829] THERE'S THIS REVIEW THAT WAS SET
[000:07:27;630] UP BY LAW BY SENATORS CORKER AND
[000:07:28;397] CARDIN.
[000:07:28;731] CLEARLY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS
[000:07:29;599] MAKE SURE CONGRESS HAS A HAND IN
[000:07:31;267] THIS, SHEPARD.
[000:07:31;834] SO WHILE HE MAY DECIDE TO
[000:07:39;108] DE-CERTI
[000:07:40;209] DE-CERTIFY, DOESN'T MEAN THAT
[000:07:42;445] THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A PART.
[000:07:44;180] >> Shepard: LET'S GO TO ANNA
[000:07:45;848] PALMER FROM POLITCO.
[000:07:46;949] GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:07:47;683] >> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:07:48;784] >> Shepard: A LOT TO GET TO
[000:07:51;020] HERE.
[000:07:51;320] THIS TILLERSON THING, YOU WONDER
[000:07:54;690] UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
[000:07:59;428] SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS, A
[000:08:00;163] MATTER THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION
[000:08:00;963] BY ANYBODY.
[000:08:01;364] WHEN TILLERSON IS NEGOTIATING
[000:08:02;698] MATTERS REGARDING NORTH KOREA,
[000:08:04;700] THE PRESIDENT TWEETS DON'T
[000:08:07;436] BOTHER.
[000:08:07;770] WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT HAS TO BE
[000:08:10;306] DONE.
[000:08:10;606] HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE -- I DON'T
[000:08:12;375] UNDERSTAND IT.
[000:08:13;009] >> I THINK WHAT WE SAW THIS WEEK
[000:08:14;810] IS KIND OF HOW THIS RELATIONSHIP
[000:08:17;113] AND THIS DANCE BETWEEN REX
[000:08:18;181] TILLERSON AND THE PRESIDENT HAS
[000:08:18;948] BEEN EVOLVING OVER THE PAST
[000:08:21;083] SEVERAL WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS.
[000:08:22;151] YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE BIG
[000:08:24;220] QUESTIONS IS DOES THE PRESIDENT
[000:08:25;354] HAVE CONFIDENCE --
[000:08:26;889] >> Shepard: HE SAYS HE DOES.
[000:08:31;661] >> HE HAS SAID HE DOES.
[000:08:32;328] THE QUESTION IS, RESULT ALSO
[000:08:33;062] DIDN'T WALK BACK TO THE FACT
[000:08:34;597] THAT HE CALLED THE PRESIDENT A
[000:08:37;433] MORON OR NOT.
[000:08:38;167] ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WITH THIS
[000:08:39;936] PRESS CONFERENCE, HE WAS TRYING
[000:08:41;470] TO SAY LOOK, I'M ON THE AMERICA
[000:08:44;840] FIRST AGENDA.
[000:08:45;474] I HAVE AMERICA'S BACK.
[000:08:46;576] IT WAS NOT ONLY A MESSAGE TO
[000:08:48;444] PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT A MESSAGE TO
[000:08:51;247] THESE COUNTRIES THAT I HAVE TO
[000:08:52;715] DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS.
[000:08:54;250] >> Shepard: WHAT DO WE MAKE OF
[000:08:55;351] THE IRAN TALK.
[000:08:56;319] IF YOU BACK OUT OF THE DEAL,
[000:08:57;687] IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN COME UP
[000:08:59;388] WITH A NEW DEAL.
[000:09:03;926] YOU HAD TO GET THESE COUNTRIES
[000:09:04;694] TOGETHER ON THIS THING.
[000:09:05;294] WITHOUT THIS DEAL, WHERE ARE WE?
[000:09:06;062] >> I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING --
[000:09:08;798] PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS ON
[000:09:10;099] THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RAILED AT THE
[000:09:11;934] DEAL OF BEING BAD.
[000:09:14;637] SO THEY'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE
[000:09:16;472] NEEDLE SAYING THEY WANT TO PULL
[000:09:17;807] OUT OF IT.
[000:09:18;774] IT'S A PROCESS.
[000:09:20;576] SO YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T THROW
[000:09:22;812] THE WHOLE DEAL AND THE WORLD
[000:09:24;313] INTO CHAOS.
[000:09:25;514] HE'S TRYING TO HAVE IT BOTH
[000:09:27;183] WAYS.
[000:09:27;817] >> Shepard: I READ HE MIGHT BE
[000:09:29;919] TRYING TO KNOCK IT DOWN A PEG
[000:09:31;120] AND THEN LIFT IT BACK UP AGAIN.
[000:09:36;392] IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE CREDIT FOR
[000:09:37;193] FIXING SOMETHING.
[000:09:37;693] >> RIGHT.
[000:09:38;094] MY COLLEAGUE WROTE ABOUT THIS A
[000:09:38;861] COUPLE DAYS AGO.
[000:09:39;428] BASICALLY SAYING EXACTLY THAT.
[000:09:41;097] HE WANTS TO HAVE THIS PUBLIC
[000:09:42;331] STATEMENT THAT GOES VERY
[000:09:44;333] AGGRESSIVELY BUT ABLE TO COBBLE
[000:09:45;701] TOGETHER SOMETHING WITH CONGRESS
[000:09:47;136] TO COME BACK AND SAY, LOOK,
[000:09:49;105] WE'RE NOT GOING TO PULL OUT OF
[000:09:52;308] IT.
[000:09:52;575] >> Shepard: WHAT IS THE STORY
[000:09:53;509] FOR AID WITH PUERTO RICO?
[000:09:54;543] IS THIS A TEST OF THE WINDS ON
[000:09:56;445] THIS MATTER OR IS IT A TRIAL
[000:09:58;614] BALLOON?
[000:09:58;948] I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
[000:10:00;416] HAPPENING THERE EITHER.
[000:10:01;717] >> LISTEN, CONGRESS AND THE
[000:10:02;918] PRESIDENT SAID THEY'RE GOING TO
[000:10:04;086] HAVE THE MONEY THEY NEED WHEN
[000:10:09;058] THEY NEED IT.
[000:10:09;525] SO FAR CONGRESS HAS HAD THE
[000:10:10;226] MONEY FOR TEXAS AND THE
[000:10:10;860] DIFFERENT HURRICANES THIS YEAR
[000:10:11;827] AND THE FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.
[000:10:12;962] SO I THINK THE MONEY WILL BE
[000:10:14;830] THERE, BUT AS FAR AS WHAT WILL
[000:10:16;532] HAPPEN WITH THE PUERTO RICAN
[000:10:22;271] DEBT, CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT GOT
[000:10:23;939] AHEAD ON WIPING THAT AWAY.
[000:10:25;941] THE ACTUAL PROCESS IS, YOU CAN'T
[000:10:28;511] JUST WIPE IT AWAY.
[000:10:29;812] >> Shepard: THE VICE PRESIDENT
[000:10:30;579] IS AT J.B.A., JOINT BASE
[000:10:33;082] ANDREWS.
[000:10:33;582] USED TO BE ANDREWS AIR FORCE
[000:10:34;950] BASE.
[000:10:35;251] THIS IS WHERE VICE PRESIDENTS GO
[000:10:36;319] BEFORE THEY HEAD OFF PLACES.
[000:10:42;058] HE'S GOING DOWN TO ORLANDO AND
[000:10:42;858] TOUR SOME OF THE HURRICANE
[000:10:43;526] DAMAGE DOWN THERE.
[000:10:44;427] THE FUNDING OF THESE DISASTERS
[000:10:47;930] IS GOING TO BE A REAL LONG-TERM
[000:10:50;900] CHALLENGE.
[000:10:51;300] THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT
[000:10:52;601] CUTTING TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD,
[000:10:54;770] DEPENDING WHO YOU BELIEVE,
[000:10:56;505] ADDING A TRILLION DOLLARS TO THE
[000:10:57;807] DEBT OVER TIME.
[000:10:58;574] NOW YOU HAVE TENS OF BILLIONS IN
[000:11:00;943] TEXAS AND TENS OF BILLIONS IN
[000:11:03;346] FLORIDA AND MAYBE MORE THAN THAT
[000:11:05;247] IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:11:05;915] IT'S DAUNTING.
[000:11:06;749] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:11:08;050] I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE ON
[000:11:12;188] THE SCALE OF -- KATRINA IS WHAT
[000:11:12;988] PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW
[000:11:14;623] THEY JUDGE THAT.
[000:11:15;391] IT'S SO EXPENSIVE.
[000:11:16;559] YOU SEE SOME OF THE CONSERVATIVE
[000:11:18;394] WING ON THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE
[000:11:19;295] SIDE SAYING HOW ARE WE GOING TO
[000:11:20;896] PAY FOR THIS?
[000:11:22;131] ARE WE GOING TO KEEP WRITING
[000:11:24;467] THESE CHECKS AND NOT ACTUALLY
[000:11:26;302] BALANCE THE BUDGET?
[000:11:26;969] AS YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE FUNDING
[000:11:28;571] AND THE NEED CONTINUES AND THE
[000:11:31;240] WEEKS AND MONTHS AS IT GOES
[000:11:32;942] FORWARD, YOU'LL START HAVING
[000:11:34;710] CONSERVATIVE -- START TO ASK THE
[000:11:36;312] QUESTION, WHERE IS THIS MONEY
[000:11:37;313] COMING FROM, HOW ARE WE GOING TO
[000:11:39;148] GET TO A TAX CUT SITUATION, A
[000:11:41;083] TAX PACKAGE IF WE'RE CONTINUING
[000:11:45;955] TO WRITE THESE CHECKS.
[000:11:46;555] >> SO MOVEMENT NOT ON GUN
[000:11:47;189] CONTROL, BUT ON REGULATING
[000:11:47;923] OUTSIDE DEVICES.
[000:11:49;191] SOME CONSERVATIVES AND
[000:11:50;493] REPUBLICANS HAVE COME OUT IN
[000:11:51;494] FAVOR OF TAKING A LOOK AT BUMP
[000:11:54;897] STOCKS.
[000:11:55;664] THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I
[000:11:56;732] PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
[000:11:58;334] THIS.
[000:11:58;634] AND NOW THE NRA SAYING YEAH, YOU
[000:12:01;237] OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT.
[000:12:03;305] IS THERE AN APPETITE FOR REAL
[000:12:04;740] GUN CONTROL?
[000:12:05;441] WE KNOW THIS PRESIDENT WAS AT
[000:12:08;344] ONE POINT A NEW YORK LIBERAL.
[000:12:10;146] YOU WINDER IF HE WON'T MIGRATE
[000:12:13;482] IN THAT DIRECTION.
[000:12:18;254] >> THIS IS THE ONE AREA AT BEST
[000:12:19;088] THAT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU'RE FOR
[000:12:19;855] GUN CONTROL OR GUN CONTROL OF
[000:12:20;623] THIS TYPE THAT YOU'LL FIND ANY
[000:12:23;626] KIND OF COALESCING OF PEOPLE
[000:12:27;696] SUPPORTING IT.
[000:12:28;764] YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON
[000:12:29;865] HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
[000:12:31;167] THE NRA EVEN SAYING THIS IS
[000:12:33;869] SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED
[000:12:36;205] AT.
[000:12:36;472] CERTAINLY -- I'VE COVERED SOME
[000:12:40;509] OF THESE TRAGEDIES A LONG TIME.
[000:12:42;745] THIS IS AS MUCH COALESCING
[000:12:44;747] AROUND ONE PROACTIVE THING THAT
[000:12:50;553] THEY COULD DO IN LEGISLATION
[000:12:51;353] THAT WILL HAPPEN.
[000:12:51;854] YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 2018
[000:12:52;521] ELECTION YEAR, A LOT OF
[000:12:53;155] DEMOCRATS THAT DON'T WANT THIS
[000:12:53;956] TO BE AN ELECTION YEAR ISSUE.
[000:12:57;827] JOE MANCHIN, HEIDI HEIDCAMP,
[000:13:10;139] THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO
[000:13:11;207] TALK ABOUT IT.
[000:13:11;974] >> Shepard: OKAY.
[000:13:14;743] AHEAD, WHY INVESTIGATORS SAY THE
[000:13:16;479] KILLER IN LAS VEGAS MAY HAVE HAD
[000:13:18;314] HELP.
[000:13:22;718] THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX
[000:13:23;486] NEWS DECK ON A THURSDAY
[000:13:24;153] AFTERNOON.
[000:13:24;520] GLAD TO HAVE YOU IN.
[000:13:24;854] This woman is laughing
[000:13:24;854] because she's listening
[000:14:24;713] to a hilarious
[000:14:24;713] audiobook on Audible.
[000:14:28;784] And this woman is laughing
[000:14:28;784] because she's pretending
[000:14:30;886] her boss's terrible
[000:14:30;886] story is funny.
[000:14:39;595] Still actually laughing.
[000:14:42;932] No longer making
[000:14:42;932] a human noise.

[000:15:23;606] Remember that accident I got in
[000:15:24;907] with the pole, and I
[000:15:24;907] had to make a claim
[000:15:24;907] and all that?
[000:15:26;241] Is that whole thing
[000:15:26;241] still dragging on?
[000:15:27;242] No, I took some pics
[000:15:27;242] with the app and...
[000:15:28;243] filed a claim, but...
[000:15:29;645] You know how they send you
[000:15:29;645] money to cover repairs and...
[000:15:31;647] They took forever
[000:15:31;647] to pay you, right?
[000:15:32;915] No, I got paid
[000:15:32;915] right away, but...
[000:15:34;850] at the very end of
[000:15:34;850] it all, my agent...
[000:15:36;118] Wouldn't even call
[000:15:36;118] you back, right?
[000:15:37;353] No, she called to see
[000:15:37;353] if I was happy.
[000:15:38;854] But if I wasn't happy
[000:15:38;854] with my claim experience
[000:15:40;723] for any reason,
[000:15:41;824] they'd give me
[000:15:41;824] my money back,
[000:15:43;425] no questions asked.
[000:15:44;693] Can you believe that?
[000:15:46;195] No.
[000:15:47;262] The Claim Satisfaction
[000:15:47;262] Guarantee,
[000:15:49;164] only from Allstate.
[000:15:50;566] Switching to Allstate
[000:15:50;566] is worth it.
[000:15:59;675] >> Shepard: WE'RE HEARING FROM
[000:16:04;747] FIRST RESPONDERS THAT RUSHED
[000:16:05;514] INTO HARM'S WAY AND FIRED INTO A
[000:16:06;415] CROWD OF 22,000 PEOPLE.
[000:16:08;117] THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES
[000:16:09;618] THEY FACE.
[000:16:10;486] TRACE GALLAGHER ONCE AGAIN FROM
[000:16:12;187] LAS VEGAS NOT FAR FROM WHERE THE
[000:16:14;256] SHOOTING HAPPENED.
[000:16:15;024] TRACE?
[000:16:15;324] >> SHEP, THERE WAS A GROUP OF
[000:16:16;859] FIREFIGHTERS THAT WAS HANDLING A
[000:16:18;727] CAR NEAR MANDALAY BAY BEFORE
[000:16:19;828] THIS STARTED.
[000:16:22;464] THEY WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN
[000:16:23;365] FIVE SECONDS.
[000:16:23;999] THEY'RE SAYING WITHIN A FEW
[000:16:25;367] MINUTES, THERE WAS MORE THAN 100
[000:16:27;636] FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE TO HEAR
[000:16:28;771] THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS FRIGHTENING
[000:16:30;305] AND VERY FASCINATING.
[000:16:32;508] THEY WERE WORKING THIS WHOLE
[000:16:37;312] TRIAGE SETUP UNDER FIRE.
[000:16:37;980] KIND OF LIKE A BATTLEFIELD.
[000:16:38;647] AT ONE POINT IN TIME, THE RADIO
[000:16:39;581] TRAFFIC WAS SO JUMBLED THAT THE
[000:16:41;417] FIREFIGHTERS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
[000:16:42;384] WHERE THE SHOOTING WAS COMING
[000:16:43;886] FROM.
[000:16:44;453] THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE WORKING
[000:16:46;088] WITH MULTIPLE SHOOTERS.
[000:16:48;824] THEN THEY SAID THE FEEL OF
[000:16:50;826] VICTIMS WAS ALMOST A MILE LONG.
[000:16:52;661] LISTEN TO THIS.
[000:16:53;495] >> THEY WERE LAYING IN BETWEEN
[000:16:54;730] THE RUNWAYS, TRYING TO TAKE
[000:16:57;299] COVER.
[000:16:57;599] THE AREAS ARE CARVED OUT BETWEEN
[000:16:59;134] THE RUNWAYS AND THE TAXIWAYS.
[000:17:01;537] THEN WE HAD REPORTS OF GUN SHOTS
[000:17:04;840] AT THE AIRPORT.
[000:17:09;411] ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WE HAD A LOT
[000:17:10;245] ON OUR HANDS.
[000:17:10;679] A LOT WE THOUGHT WAS ESCALATING
[000:17:11;447] WHEN IT WAS REALLY CONTAINED BUT
[000:17:12;414] WE DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE OF SO
[000:17:14;049] MANY CALLS COMING IN.
[000:17:15;117] >> WHEN HE SAID ON THE RUNWAY OF
[000:17:17;820] McCARRAN AIRPORT, HE'S TALKING
[000:17:19;655] ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE WE ARE
[000:17:21;390] RIGHT NOW.
[000:17:22;257] THEY PUSHED DOWN THE FENCES AND
[000:17:24;226] RAN TO GET AWAY AND ENDED UP
[000:17:25;961] BETWEEN THE RUNWAYS AND THE
[000:17:28;330] TAXIWAYS.
[000:17:28;997] IT'S PHENOMENAL.
[000:17:30;065] THE FIREFIGHTERS SAID THEY HAD
[000:17:31;567] REHEARSED, TRAINING FOR THIS
[000:17:33;035] SCENARIO FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE
[000:17:34;069] THEY'RE A HIGH TARGET
[000:17:36;672] DESTINATION.
[000:17:37;139] SHEP?
[000:17:37;439] >> Shepard: NOTHING SPECIFIC,
[000:17:42;044] TRACE, ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE
[000:17:42;778] OTHER POSSIBLE TARGETS?
[000:17:43;412] >> WELL, WE HAVE DEFINITELY
[000:17:45;748] CONFIRMED THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK
[000:17:46;682] DID BOOK A HOTEL ROOM IN CHICAGO
[000:17:48;784] OVERLOOKING GRANT PARK IN AUGUST
[000:17:50;152] DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA CONCERT
[000:17:52;488] THAT MALIA OBAMA WAS IN
[000:17:54;323] ATTENDANCE THERE.
[000:17:55;057] THE BLACKSTONE HOTEL RELEASED A
[000:17:57;259] STATEMENT.
[000:17:57;626] IT SAYS "ON BEHALF OF THE
[000:17:59;361] BLACKSTONE, WE CAN CONFIRM THERE
[000:18:01;530] WAS NO GUEST UNDER THE NAME WHO
[000:18:03;932] STAYED AT OUR HOTEL IN AUGUST
[000:18:05;834] DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC
[000:18:08;237] FESTIVAL.
[000:18:08;604] WE CAN CONFIRM A RESERVATION WAS
[000:18:14;109] MADE UNDER THE NAME OF STEPHEN
[000:18:14;910] PADDOCK.
[000:18:15;244] HOWEVER, AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT
[000:18:15;944] CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE SAME
[000:18:16;745] PERSON AS THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER.
[000:18:17;579] WE'RE COOPERATING WITH THE
[000:18:18;580] AUTHORITIES ON THAT MATTER."
[000:18:20;048] NOW THE CHICAGO POLICE HAVE IN
[000:18:21;884] FACT CONFIRMED THIS IS THE VERY
[000:18:24;620] SAME STEPHEN PADDOCK THAT DID
[000:18:25;721] BOOK THAT HOTEL AT THE
[000:18:27;923] BLACKSTONE OVERLOOKING
[000:18:31;326] LOLLAPALOOZA.
[000:18:32;694] WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT HE
[000:18:37;166] BOOKED A HOTEL ROOM AT THE
[000:18:40;702] MANDALAY BAY AND ANOTHER CONCERT
[000:18:46;074] CALLED LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL BY
[000:18:46;809] CHANCE THE RAPPER.
[000:18:47;376] SO WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ON
[000:18:48;177] THE REPORTS OF THE AVIATION FUEL
[000:18:50;212] TANKS, WE JUST MENTIONED
[000:18:52;714] McCARRON AIRPORT, THE AVIATION
[000:18:54;082] FUEL TANKS WERE HIT BE SOME
[000:18:57;186] BULLETS.
[000:18:57;519] THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL
[000:18:58;587] SAID HE WAS TARGETING IT.
[000:19:00;789] WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
[000:19:01;924] TO CONFIRM THAT WE DON'T HAVE
[000:19:04;193] ENOUGH TO RULE IT OUT.
[000:19:05;928] THE BULLETS DID HIT THE TANK.
[000:19:08;330] WERE THEY BULLETS THAT WERE
[000:19:10;299] BEING RANDOMLY FIRED?
[000:19:12;434] POSSIBLE.
[000:19:12;801] WAS IT TARGETED?
[000:19:18;841] ALSO POSSIBLE.
[000:19:19;308] THE SHERIFF LAST NIGHT IN THIS
[000:19:20;108] ASTOUNDING NEWS CONFERENCE MADE
[000:19:20;909] MENTION OF A POTENTIAL
[000:19:22;945] ACCOMPLICE.
[000:19:23;345] HE BELIEVES THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK
[000:19:24;112] DID HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE.
[000:19:25;914] OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE A SUPER
[000:19:27;883] HUMAN EFFORT TO PULL OFF WHAT HE
[000:19:29;284] DID ALONE.
[000:19:30;552] THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS
[000:19:31;954] SAYING IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO
[000:19:35;290] THIS ATTACK AT THE MANDALAY BAY
[000:19:37;826] HOTEL WHERE HE WAS GAMBLING FOR
[000:19:39;328] HOURS AND HOURS, HE WAS WITH A
[000:19:40;729] WOMAN THAT WAS NOT HIS
[000:19:41;530] GIRLFRIEND AND NOW POLICE ARE
[000:19:42;998] INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHO
[000:19:45;467] EXACTLY THAT WOMAN WAS WITH HIM
[000:19:46;468] IN THOSE DAYS LEADING UP TO IT,
[000:19:51;707] SHEP.
[000:19:52;007] >> Shepard: LOTS OF GREAT
[000:19:52;674] INFORMATION, TRACE.
[000:19:53;208] TRACE GALLAGHER ON SCENE.
[000:19:53;842] THANKS AGAIN.
[000:19:54;276] A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT
[000:19:55;777] THE LAS VEGAS GUNMAN, STEPHEN
[000:19:57;512] PADDOCK.
[000:19:58;013] AHEAD WE'LL TALK WITH A FORMER
[000:20:00;449] FBI INVESTIGATOR ABOUT THE
[000:20:02;784] QUESTIONS HE SAYS THAT
[000:20:03;952] INVESTIGATORS NEED TO GET
[000:20:04;586] ANSWERED.

[000:20:44;359] When food is good

[000:22:09;644] Better nutrition.
[000:22:10;712] Better eggs.
[000:23:22;717] >> THE NUMBER 2 OFFICIAL IN THE
[000:23:24;586] ANYBODY SAYS HE'S SURPRISED THAT
[000:23:26;588] INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT LEARNED
[000:23:28;156] MORE YET ABOUT WHAT DROVE
[000:23:30;459] STEPHEN PADDOCK TO COMMIT MASS
[000:23:32;894] MURDER.
[000:23:37;265] ANDREW McCABE SAID WE HAVE A LOT
[000:23:38;066] OF WORK TO DO.
[000:23:42;571] WHAT IS MISSING?
[000:23:46;274] WHAT ARE THE BIG MISSES PIECES?
[000:23:48;343] >> THERE'S NO EASY BOX TO PUT
[000:23:50;378] PADDOCK IN.
[000:23:51;546] IF AN ATTACK HAPPENS, IT'S AN
[000:23:54;516] ISLAMIC ATTACK OR RACIALLY
[000:23:57;119] MOTIVATED ATTACK.
[000:23:58;386] PADDOCK DIDN'T HIT ANY OF THOSE
[000:23:59;488] TRIP WIRES.
[000:24:00;489] THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO DIG
[000:24:02;157] DEEP AND FIGURING OUT WHAT HIS
[000:24:04;426] MOTIVATION WAS, WHAT CAUSED HIM
[000:24:09;131] TO DO WHAT HE DID.
[000:24:09;698] >> Shepard: WE KNOW HE'S A
[000:24:10;365] MILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE
[000:24:10;999] INVESTOR.
[000:24:11;366] HE GAMBLED A LOT.
[000:24:12;067] IF HE BLEW ALL OF HIS MONEY
[000:24:14;336] GAMBLING THEY WOULD KNOW THAT BY
[000:24:15;937] NOW, WOULDN'T THEY?
[000:24:16;872] >> AND THEY SHOULD.
[000:24:17;772] THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATION
[000:24:19;107] WILL GO.
[000:24:19;774] IT WILL GO INTO HIS FINANCIAL
[000:24:21;810] BACKGROUND, GOES INTO ANYBODY HE
[000:24:23;378] CONTACTED.
[000:24:23;745] THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE
[000:24:25;113] FIRST WIFE, THE SECOND WIFE,
[000:24:27;048] PEOPLE HE WORKED WITH.
[000:24:28;884] HE SEEMED TO HAVE VARIOUS
[000:24:30;418] DIFFERENT JOBS, ALL GOOD JOBS,
[000:24:32;254] BUT DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND
[000:24:33;421] DIFFERENT JOBS.
[000:24:34;589] THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THOSE
[000:24:36;158] CO-WORKERS AND BOSSES TO FIGURE
[000:24:41;763] OUT WHAT MADE THIS GUY TICK.
[000:24:42;531] >> Shepard: THERE WAS A NOTE.
[000:24:43;231] WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT.
[000:24:43;932] >> WE DON'T.
[000:24:44;432] I THINK THE LAS VEGAS
[000:24:45;100] METROPOLITAN POLICE HAVE THAT
[000:24:45;867] NOTE AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING UP
[000:24:48;670] ANYTHING ON IT.
[000:24:49;304] >> Shepard: I WONDER IF THEY
[000:24:50;739] HAVE -- POLICE CAN WITHHOLD
[000:24:52;007] WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THE COURSE
[000:24:53;108] OF AN INVESTIGATION.
[000:24:55;177] IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY
[000:24:55;977] NEED TO GET TO, THEY CAN
[000:24:59;714] WITHHOLD INFORMATION.
[000:25:01;416] I WONDER IF THEY DON'T KNOW
[000:25:05;253] ABOUT MOTIVE THAN WHAT WE'RE
[000:25:10;192] HEARI
[000:25:11;059] HEARING?
[000:25:11;393] >> AND THEY MAY.
[000:25:15;096] IN AN INVESTIGATION, YOU DON'T
[000:25:15;864] WANT TO TIP YOUR HAT.
[000:25:16;498] INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HOLD
[000:25:18;400] THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO
[000:25:20;435] FURTHER THEIR INVESTIGATION
[000:25:21;570] WITHOUT TIPPING THEIR HAND OR
[000:25:22;904] LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT I MAY
[000:25:26;274] BECOME A SUBJECT OF AN
[000:25:29;544] INVESTIGATION.
[000:25:30;078] IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD.
[000:25:31;446] >> Shepard: IS THIS IDEA THAT HE
[000:25:32;380] WAS WITH A WOMAN GAMBLING BEFORE
[000:25:34;616] COMMITTING THIS ATTACK SOMEONE
[000:25:35;417] WHO HASN'T COME FORWARD, MUST
[000:25:38;019] REALIZE WOW, THIS IS THE GUY I
[000:25:40;121] WAS WITH THAT NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO
[000:25:42;023] HAVE QUESTIONS FOR WHOEVER THAT
[000:25:42;891] IS.
[000:25:43;158] >> THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.
[000:25:47;996] IN THE COURSE OF THE
[000:25:48;597] INVESTIGATION, THEY NEED TO TALK
[000:25:49;331] TO THAT WOMAN.
[000:25:49;764] I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE.
[000:25:50;432] I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT WHEN YOU
[000:25:51;233] SAID IT.
[000:25:52;100] THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN TELL
[000:25:53;602] US HOW OR WHAT PADDOCK WAS
[000:25:57;038] FEELING.
[000:25:57;372] THAT'S ALL PART OF THE
[000:25:58;940] INVESTIGATION.
[000:25:59;407] >> Shepard: THERE'S ALWAYS A
[000:26:00;575] REASON, RIGHT?
[000:26:01;343] I DON'T REMEMBER A MATT ATTACK
[000:26:03;545] WHERE IN THE END NO ONE CAN
[000:26:04;980] FIGURE OUT WHY THEY DID IT.
[000:26:07;349] MAY NOT BE A REASONABLE REASON
[000:26:08;583] BUT THERE IS USUALLY A REASON.
[000:26:10;352] >> RIGHT.
[000:26:11;286] YEAH, ALWAYS A REASON.
[000:26:12;520] IT MAY BE ONE THAT NOBODY CAN
[000:26:39;114] AGREE WITH.
[000:26:39;547] PERSON MAY BE CRAZY.
[000:26:40;115] SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID,
[000:26:40;815] MAYBE HIS FINANCIAL SITUATION
[000:26:41;516] TURNED BAD.
[000:26:41;916] MAYBE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN
[000:26:42;651] PURCHASING 33 WEAPONS OVER THE
[000:26:43;385] COURSE OF A YEAR.
[000:26:43;885] HE MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNING THIS
[000:26:44;619] AS FAR AS A YEAR AND DIDN'T HIT
[000:26:45;353] ANY TRIP WIRES.
[000:26:45;820] >> Shepard: THANKS, JEFFERY.
[000:26:46;488] >> THANK YOU.
[000:26:46;921] >> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS
[000:26:47;656] IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE
[000:26:48;290] INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO MOVE
[000:26:49;024] ON AFTER THE TOP REPUBLICAN SAYS
[000:26:49;758] THEY'RE STILL LOOKING INTO THE
[000:26:50;492] POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION BETWEEN
[000:26:51;226] MOSCOW AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
[000:26:51;926] THAT'S COMING UP.
[000:29:00;922] >> Shepard: HEADLINES FROM THE
[000:29:01;723] FOX NEWS DECK.
[000:29:02;190] U.S. OFFICIALS SAY MILITANTS
[000:29:02;924] LINKED TO AL-QUAIDA ARE LIKELY
[000:29:04;526] TO BLAME FOR AN AMBUSH THAT
[000:29:06;428] KILLED THREE GREEN BERETS AND
[000:29:07;929] WOUNDED TWO OTHERS IN AFRICA.
[000:29:10;298] IT HAPPENED IN NIGER.
[000:29:11;232] ACCORDING TO THE PENTAGON, U.S.
[000:29:13;301] SPECIAL FORCES ARE WILL TRAINING
[000:29:14;402] AND SUPPORTING THE LOCAL
[000:29:16;538] MILITARY IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST
[000:29:18;973] EXTREMISTS.
[000:29:19;374] TRACES OF VX, THE DEADLIEST
[000:29:21;743] NERVE AGENT WERE FOUND ON THE
[000:29:23;378] CLOTHES OF WOMEN SUSPECTED OF
[000:29:26;815] ASSASSINATING KIM JONG-UN'S HALF
[000:29:28;383] BROTHER.
[000:29:28;716] THAT'S ACCORDING TO A CHEMIST
[000:29:32;587] THAT TESTIFIED AT THEIR TRIAL.
[000:29:33;321] THE WOMEN COMPLAINED AGENTS
[000:29:34;022] TRICKED THEM THEY WERE THINKING
[000:29:34;823] THEY WERE PLAYING PART IN A
[000:29:36;558] HIDDEN CAMERA PRANK AT A
[000:29:39;561] MALAYSIAN AIRPORT.
[000:29:40;562] ONE DROP OF VX IS ENOUGH TO KILL
[000:29:42;831] YOU, A SPANISH COURT ATTEMPTING
[000:29:44;432] TO BLOCK CATALONIA FROM
[000:29:45;934] DECLARING INDEPENDENCE.
[000:29:47;168] LAWMAKERS IN THE NORTHEASTERN
[000:29:48;703] REGION OF SPAIN ARE THREATENING
[000:29:49;971] TO BREAKAWAY NEXT WEEK.
[000:29:51;339] THERE'S BEEN MASSIVE PROTESTS
[000:29:52;974] AND FIGHT WITH POLICE IN SPAIN.
[000:29:54;142] THE NEWS CONTINUES NEXT.
[000:30:24;072] I was always
[000:30:24;072] "the girl with psoriasis."
[000:30:27;308] People don't stare anymore.
[000:30:28;843] I never joined in.
[000:30:30;945] That wasn't fair to any of us.
[000:30:33;014] I was covered.
[000:30:34;215] I tried lots of things
[000:30:34;215] over the years.
[000:30:36;484] But I didn't give up.
[000:30:37;819] I kept on fighting.
[000:30:39;420] I found something that worked.
[000:30:41;122] That still works.
[000:30:42;590] Now?
[000:30:43;458] SEE ME.
[000:30:44;292] SEE ME.
[000:30:45;493] I found clear skin that lasts.
[000:30:47;228] See if COSENTYX could make a
[000:30:47;228] difference for you-
[000:30:49;631] COSENTYX is proven to help
[000:30:49;631] people with moderate
[000:30:51;766] to severe plaque psoriasis...
[000:30:53;201] ...find clear skin that
[000:30:53;201] can last.
[000:30:55;503] Don't use if you're allergic
[000:30:55;503] to COSENTYX.
[000:30:57;372] Before starting COSENTYX,
[000:30:58;506] you should be checked
[000:30:58;506] for tuberculosis.
[000:31:00;275] An increased risk of infections
[000:31:00;275] and lowered ability
[000:31:02;377] to fight them may occur.
[000:31:03;611] Tell your doctor if you have an
[000:31:03;611] infection or symptoms.
[000:31:05;947] Or if you have received a
[000:31:05;947] vaccine or plan to.
[000:31:07;982] If you have inflammatory
[000:31:07;982] bowel disease,
[000:31:09;651] tell your doctor if symptoms
[000:31:09;651] develop or worsen.
[000:31:11;786] Serious allergic reactions
[000:31:11;786] may occur.
[000:31:13;721] SEE ME
[000:31:13;721] to know...
[000:31:14;956] ...clear skin can last.
[000:31:17;091] Don't hold back...
[000:31:18;393] ...ask your dermatologist if
[000:31:18;393] COSENTYX can help you
[000:31:20;628] find clear skin that lasts.
[000:31:24;232] Mom,on my car insurance of money
[000:31:24;999] by switching to GEICO.
[000:31:26;801] I should take a closer
[000:31:26;801] look at GEICO...
[000:31:32;307] You know, GEICO can help you
[000:31:32;307] save money
[000:31:33;775] on your homeowners
[000:31:33;775] insurance too?
[000:31:35;176] Great! GEICO can help insure
[000:31:35;176] our mountain chalet!
[000:31:37;312] How long have we been sawing
[000:31:37;312] this log?
[000:31:38;780] Um, one hundred
[000:31:38;780] and fourteen years.
[000:31:41;316] Man I thought my arm would
[000:31:41;316] be a lot more jacked by now.
[000:31:44;052] I'm not even sure
[000:31:44;052] this is real wood.
[000:31:45;687] There's no butter in this churn.
[000:31:47;555] Do my tris look okay?
[000:31:49;524] Take a closer look at GEICO.
[000:31:51;092] Great savings.
[000:31:51;726] And a whole lot more.
[000:31:58;533] >> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS
[000:31:59;534] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FRUSTRATED
[000:32:01;169] THAT THE INVESTIGATION INTO
[000:32:02;604] POSSIBLE COLLUSION BETWEEN
[000:32:03;538] MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
[000:32:04;839] AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS
[000:32:06;507] STILL GOING ON.
[000:32:07;442] >> IT'S LITERALLY FOUND ZERO
[000:32:09;944] EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN
[000:32:11;145] THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.
[000:32:16;117] I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
[000:32:16;918] WOULD LIKE THEM TO FOCUS ON SOME
[000:32:17;685] OTHER THINGS.
[000:32:18;119] I KNOW THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE
[000:32:18;920] SAID THIS ALL ALONG AND WE'RE
[000:32:20;288] GLAD THAT AS THEY CONTINUE THIS
[000:32:21;723] PROCESS THEY'RE COMING TO THE
[000:32:23;591] SAME CONCLUSION.
[000:32:24;392] >> Shepard: THEY HAVEN'T COME TO
[000:32:25;360] THAT CONCLUSION.
[000:32:26;628] THIS COMES AFTER THE REPUBLICAN
[000:32:27;962] CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
[000:32:28;730] INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SAID THE
[000:32:30;431] POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION BETWEEN
[000:32:32;367] RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS
[000:32:33;501] STILL OPEN.
[000:32:34;602] IN OTHER WORDS, NO CONCLUSION.
[000:32:37;205] STILL OPEN.
[000:32:37;839] SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
[000:32:40;174] AND SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT

[000:32:54;856] >> THAT'S RIGHT.

[000:33:20;848] DELETION, SHREDDING OR
[000:33:30;158] MIGRATION.
[000:33:30;558] >> THE INQUIRY HAS EXPANDED
[000:33:33;928] SLIGHTLY.
[000:33:34;495] INITIAL INTERVIEWS AND DOCUMENT
[000:33:36;798] REVIEW GENERATED HUNDREDS OF
[000:33:38;533] ADDITIONAL REQUESTS ON OUR PART
[000:33:41;669] FOR INFORMATION.
[000:33:42;804] IT IDENTIFIED MANY LEADS THAT
[000:33:45;907] EXPANDED OUR INITIAL INQUIRY.
[000:33:47;442] >> A ONE-TIME FOREIGN POLICY

[000:33:56;984] REQUEST MOUNTED TO A FISHING
[000:34:01;622] EXPEDITION.
[000:34:02;190] HE SAID THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF
[000:34:04;792] FALSE TESTIMONY.
[000:34:05;727] THE COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN PAGE
[000:34:08;362] UNTIL OCTOBER 18 TO COMPLY.
[000:34:09;997] >> Shepard: WHAT DO WE KNOW
[000:34:11;099] ABOUT THIS REPORT THAT RUSSIAN
[000:34:13;101] HACKERS STOLE SENSITIVE
[000:34:13;835] INFORMATION FROM AN NSA
[000:34:16;237] CONTRACTOR?
[000:34:16;671] >> WE HAVE HAD A STATEMENT FROM
[000:34:18;973] BEN SASSE ON THIS REPORTING THAT
[000:34:20;441] WAS FIRST DONE BY THE "WALL
[000:34:25;279] STREET JOURNAL."
[000:34:25;747] THE SENATOR ACCUSED THE NSA OF
[000:34:26;547] PUTTING THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND
[000:34:27;348] OVER CONTRACTING PROBLEMS.
[000:34:28;316] SAYING THE NSA NEEDS TO GET
[000:34:30;184] THEIR HAND OUT OF THE SAND AND
[000:34:33;054] SOLVE THE CONTRACTOR PROBLEM.
[000:34:34;422] WE CAN'T AFFORD THESE
[000:34:36;758] SELF-INFLICTED INJURIES.
[000:34:37;592] WHAT WE KNOW INDEPENDENTLY
[000:34:39;627] THROUGH OUR OWN REPORTING IS
[000:34:41;229] THAT THERE REMAINS VERY DEEP
[000:34:44;065] CONCERN ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY
[000:34:45;333] SOFTWARE AND THAT IT CAN BE
[000:34:46;934] EXPLOITED BY RUSSIAN AFFILIATED
[000:34:48;436] OR RUSSIAN BACKED HACKERS.
[000:34:49;904] WE HAVE LINES OUT TO THE NSA FOR
[000:34:53;274] COMMENTING BY THE REPORTING THAT
[000:34:58;012] HACKERS WORKING FOR THE RUSSIAN
[000:34:58;780] GOVERNMENT STOLE DETAILS ABOUT
[000:34:59;580] THE U.S. CYBER TACTICS INCLUDING
[000:35:00;515] HOW WE GET INSIDE FOREIGN
[000:35:02;116] COMPUTER NETWORKS AND DEFEND
[000:35:04;418] AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS.
[000:35:06;187] THE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL
[000:35:07;455] ACCORDING TO THE "WALL STREET
[000:35:08;723] JOURNAL" WAS REMOVED AND PLACED
[000:35:09;791] ON A CONTRACTOR'S HOME COMPUTER.
[000:35:12;226] THAT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION THERE.
[000:35:14;262] AND THAT COMPUTER USED THIS
[000:35:15;596] CONSPIRACY ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.
[000:35:18;366] LAST MONTH YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER
[000:35:20;635] THE ACTING SECRETARY OF HOPE
[000:35:23;004] LAND SECRETARY ELAINE DUKE GAVE
[000:35:26;240] AGENCIES TO WIPE CONSPIRACY
[000:35:27;408] SOFTWARE FROM THEIR SYSTEMS.
[000:35:28;743] OFFICIALS HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THE
[000:35:30;244] EVIDENCE.
[000:35:31;078] THE ORDER SHOWS THE EVIDENCE WAS
[000:35:32;146] DEEMED CREDIBLE AND SIGNIFICANT.
[000:35:34;315] CURRENT AND FORMER GOVERNMENT
[000:35:35;917] OFFICIALS TOLD FOX NEWS THE REAL
[000:35:37;785] CONCERN IS THAT CONSPIRACY
[000:35:39;620] EXECUTIVES HAVE TIES TO THE
[000:35:41;122] RUSSIAN MILITARY AND THE
[000:35:42;290] INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.
[000:35:43;124] THOUGH THE COMPANY DENIES THOSE
[000:35:45;827] CONNECTIONS, SHEP.
[000:35:46;360] >> Shepard: SO THEY STOLE SPY
[000:35:47;662] TOOLS.
[000:35:47;962] THAT'S NOT A NEW THING.
[000:35:49;230] >> IF YOU THINK BACK IN THE LAST
[000:35:51;232] SIX MONTHS, WE HAD A SIMILAR
[000:35:53;634] SITUATION WITH THE CIA AND THEIR
[000:35:56;604] CYBER TOOLS INVOLVING
[000:36:02;210] CONTRACTORS.
[000:36:02;610] WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THESE
[000:36:03;377] ARE SERIOUS SITUATIONS BUT TO A
[000:36:04;178] CERTAIN EXTENT, YOU NEED TO
[000:36:05;413] THINK ABOUT THE CYBER TOOLS.
[000:36:07;181] LIKE WHEN YOU BUY MILK AT THE
[000:36:09;083] STORE.
[000:36:09;417] THEY HAVE A BEST BUY DATE.
[000:36:11;352] THE LIFETIME IS TYPICALLY 12 TO
[000:36:13;688] 18 MONTHS.
[000:36:14;255] WHEN YOU HAVE A BREACH OR A
[000:36:15;890] THEFT, PART OF THE FEELING IN
[000:36:17;725] THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS
[000:36:19;460] THEY'RE GOING TO EXPIRE IN THE
[000:36:22;597] SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM.
[000:36:27;201] BUT THE BREACH OF TAKING IT HOME
[000:36:30;037] IS AVOIDABLE AND SELF-INFLICTED.
[000:36:37;712] >> THANKS CATHERINE HERRIDGE.
[000:36:39;914] TOM, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
[000:36:41;315] THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT SAYS
[000:36:42;850] THIS IS FAKE NEWS, AND THAT'S
[000:36:45;086] THE PRESIDENT.
[000:36:46;120] THE RUSSIANS MEDDLED WITH OUR
[000:36:47;955] ELECTION IS NOT A MATTER THAT IS
[000:36:50;191] IN DISPUTE.
[000:36:51;058] WHAT ARE THEY CONTINUING TO DO
[000:36:52;560] AND WHAT WILL THEY DO NEXT?
[000:36:53;961] DO WE HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT IS
[000:36:57;164] HAPPENING?
[000:36:57;531] >> IT'S FASCINATING.
[000:36:59;133] YOU LOOK AT THAT PRESS
[000:37:01;702] CONFERENCE YESTERDAY WITH
[000:37:06;440] SENATORS BURR AND WARNER.
[000:37:07;141] THERE'S TWO DIRECTIONS.
[000:37:08;342] IT'S LOOKING BACK AT WHAT
[000:37:09;343] HAPPENED IN THE CAMPAIGN AND
[000:37:10;945] TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER THERE
[000:37:11;812] WAS SOME COLLUSION.
[000:37:12;880] THAT IS AN OPEN QUESTION RIGHT
[000:37:13;981] NOW.
[000:37:14;282] IT'S ALSO LOOKING FORWARD.
[000:37:17;084] RIGHT?
[000:37:17;418] WE'RE AT THE PRECIPICE OF
[000:37:19;053] ANOTHER CAMPAIGN HERE, THE 2018
[000:37:22;323] MID-TERMS.
[000:37:22;690] SO THIS IS -- IT'S A HUGE
[000:37:25;426] EXPANSIVE INVESTIGATION GOING ON
[000:37:27;561] RIGHT NOW.
[000:37:28;129] MULTIPLE PROBES GOING ON.
[000:37:29;630] YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU GET
[000:37:32;800] FACEBOOK COMES OUT, REVEALS ADS.
[000:37:40;074] EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS OFFERS
[000:37:40;875] MORE FOR THEM TO LOOK INTO.
[000:37:41;542] THAT'S WHAT BURR AND WARNER SAID
[000:37:42;310] YESTERDAY.
[000:37:42;677] THEY'RE EXPANDING SLIGHTLY.
[000:37:43;377] >> Shepard: IT'S ONE THING BURR
[000:37:44;178] AROUND WARNER.
[000:37:44;645] THERE'S A BIGGER THING GOING ON
[000:37:46;047] AND THAT IS MUELLER.
[000:37:47;348] WHATEVER MUELLER IS DOING, IT'S
[000:37:49;450] NOT LEAKING.
[000:37:50;885] HE HAS AN ARMY OF PROSECUTORS.
[000:37:53;220] IT'S VERY CLEAR THE DIRECTION
[000:37:56;524] HE'S GOING IN, ISN'T IT?
[000:37:58;626] >> YEAH.
[000:37:59;327] BASED ON EVERYTHING WE KNOW AND
[000:38:01;362] WE'VE SEEN, THERE'S AN INTENSE
[000:38:04;465] INTEREST ON FINANCIAL
[000:38:05;599] STATEMENTS, FINANCIAL
[000:38:06;867] INVESTIGATIONS.
[000:38:07;335] THOSE ARE THE EXPERTS THAT HE'S
[000:38:12;173] BROUGHT ON AS YOU POINT OUT.
[000:38:12;907] IT'S A PRETTY LOCK DOWN
[000:38:13;774] INVESTIGATION.
[000:38:15;543] A CREDIT TO THEM THERE.
[000:38:18;212] THERE'S NO LEAKING IN THIS TOWN
[000:38:19;480] AT LEAST.
[000:38:20;381] >> Shepard: THEY'RE FOLLOWING
[000:38:22;183] THE MONEY.
[000:38:22;616] >> EXACTLY.
[000:38:23;184] YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY THE BIG
[000:38:26;387] ONE.
[000:38:26;654] LIKE THESE CONGRESSIONAL PROBES
[000:38:28;522] ARE GOING TO FIND THINGS.
[000:38:29;657] IT'S A WEIRD DYNAMIC.
[000:38:31;092] ON ONE HAND, WE KIND OF RELY ON
[000:38:34;362] THE CONGRESSIONAL PROBES
[000:38:35;496] PUBLICLY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS
[000:38:37;131] GOING ON.
[000:38:37;832] THAT'S REALLY YOUR BEST CHANCE
[000:38:39;333] AT FINDING SOMETHING.
[000:38:44;438] THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION AND A
[000:38:45;172] PRETTY GOOD POSSIBILITY IF
[000:38:45;906] MUELLER TURNS UP NOTHING THAT WE
[000:38:46;874] DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
[000:38:47;842] AS A STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE
[000:38:51;145] JUSTICE COMMUNITY.
[000:38:52;046] >> Shepard: IT APPEAR WHAT'S
[000:38:53;914] MULER IS GOING AFTER IS
[000:38:54;949] FINANCIAL TRANSACTION.
[000:38:56;884] WHETHER MONEY CHANGED HANDS
[000:38:57;952] BETWEEN ONE PARTY AND ANOTHER,
[000:38:59;220] IF IT DID, WHAT THAT TRANSFER OF
[000:39:00;921] MONEY WAS ABOUT.
[000:39:01;922] WHAT SERVICES WERE RENDERED.
[000:39:04;392] IS THAT FAIR?
[000:39:04;959] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:39:05;760] THAT IS BASED ON THE EXPERTS
[000:39:07;661] THEY HAVE HIRED ON THAT TEAM,
[000:39:10;097] ABSOLUTELY.
[000:39:10;498] THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE IT IS
[000:39:12;767] RIGHT NOW.
[000:39:17;171] WE'RE HEADING INTO A PRECARIOUS
[000:39:17;938] MOMENT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:39:18;639] THEY'RE STARTING TO BRING IN
[000:39:19;774] WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS, CURRENT
[000:39:21;108] AND FORMER OFFICIALS FOR
[000:39:23;377] INTERVIEWS WITH MUELLER'S TEAM.
[000:39:25;746] YOU KNOW, THIS IS -- IT'S WHEN
[000:39:27;515] IT GETS REAL.
[000:39:28;482] LOOK BACK TO THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:39:29;483] TWEET EARLIER TODAY WHERE HE
[000:39:32;053] SAYS, WHY ISN'T THE INTELLIGENCE
[000:39:33;354] COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING FAKE
[000:39:35;356] NEWS?
[000:39:35;656] HE TENDS TO REACT TO WHAT IS
[000:39:38;359] HAPPENING.
[000:39:38;759] HERE THIS IS LAPPING AT HIS DOOR
[000:39:41;095] STEP, LAPPING AT THE FRONT OF
[000:39:42;997] THE OVAL OFFICE, THIS IS GETTING
[000:39:48;436] SERIOUS.
[000:39:48;803] >> Shepard: THINGS THAT DON'T
[000:39:49;570] MAKE SENSE.
[000:39:49;970] IF YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING AND YOU
[000:39:50;704] WONDER IF PEOPLE AROUND YOU
[000:39:51;439] HAVE, THINGS THAT ARE AS ILLEGAL
[000:39:53;507] AS CONSPIRING WITH ANOTHER
[000:39:54;642] GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THE COURSE
[000:39:55;543] OF HUMAN EVENTS IN OUR NATION, I
[000:39:57;845] MEAN YOU WOULD THINK WHAT YOU
[000:39:58;979] WOULD DO IS OPEN THE DOOR AND
[000:40:01;348] SAY PLEASE, COME FIND OUT
[000:40:02;983] ANYTHING THAT WENT WRONG.
[000:40:03;918] THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS WHITE HOUSE
[000:40:06;120] IS DOING.
[000:40:07;054] >> REMEMBER, THERE'S A GREAT
[000:40:08;923] REPORTING BY KEN VOGEL, "THE NEW
[000:40:11;859] YORK TIMES."
[000:40:12;626] INCREDIBLE SIT-DOWN NEXT TO TY
[000:40:15;696] COBB AND JOHN DOWD, THAT'S A
[000:40:22;002] FIGHT INSIDE THE LEGAL TEAM.
[000:40:23;671] YOU HAVE DON McGANN, THE WHITE
[000:40:28;309] HOUSE COUNSEL.
[000:40:29;110] HE DOESN'T WANT TO SET A
[000:40:31;011] PRECEDENT OF TURNING OVER THINGS
[000:40:32;313] YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
[000:40:33;614] THE FLIP SIDE IS TY COBB, THE
[000:40:36;016] PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL COUNSEL
[000:40:36;717] THAT SAYS NO, WE SHOULD BE
[000:40:40;855] TOTALLY COOPERATIVE AND TRY TO
[000:40:42;089] GET AS MUCH TO THEM AS POSSIBLE.
[000:40:45;126] NOTHING HAPPENED IS WHAT THEY
[000:40:47;027] SAY.
[000:40:47;628] THEREFORE THIS SHOULD BE OVER
[000:40:48;863] SOON.
[000:40:49;163] BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT, AS
[000:40:54;001] YOU POINT OUT, THIS IS A SPECIAL
[000:40:54;768] COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.
[000:40:55;402] THIS COULD GO ANY NUMBER OF
[000:40:58;105] DIRECTIONS.
[000:40:59;440] >> Shepard: TOM LOBIANCO, NICE
[000:41:02;810] TO SEE YOU.
[000:41:03;978] THANK YOU.
[000:41:05;045] >> THANKS.
[000:41:05;946] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:41:06;714] TAX PLAN PASSING MAJOR HURDLE
[000:41:08;382] TODAY.
[000:41:08;682] THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
[000:41:10;684] APPROVED A BUDGET FRAME WORK
[000:41:11;652] THAT GIVES SENATE REPUBLICANS
[000:41:12;720] THE POWER TO PASS A TAX BILL
[000:41:15;389] WITH 50 VOTES INSTEAD OF THE 60
[000:41:17;224] YOU NORMALLY NEED.
[000:41:18;159] THEY ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO PASS
[000:41:19;960] A HEALTHCARE BILL BUT DIDN'T
[000:41:21;362] MANAGE TO GET IT DONE.
[000:41:26;400] OUR SEASON CAPITOL HILL
[000:41:27;067] PRODUCER, CHAD PERGRAM REPORTS
[000:41:27;801] IF THE HOUSE HAD NOT APPROVED
[000:41:28;536] THIS BUDGET FRAME WORK, THE
[000:41:30;671] REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN PROBABLY
[000:41:34;141] WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD LIKE
[000:41:35;910] IMMEDIATELY.
[000:41:36;343] MIKE EMANUEL HAS MORE.
[000:41:36;944] ARE THEY OPTIMISTIC UP THERE
[000:41:38;546] NOW, MIKE?
[000:41:39;380] >> YEAH, THEY SEEM MORE HOPEFUL.
[000:41:41;549] IF YOU NEEDED 60 YES VOTES IN
[000:41:42;950] ORDER TO DO TAX REFORM, THAT
[000:41:44;818] WOULD HAVE GIVEN DEMOCRATS
[000:41:46;453] TREMENDOUS LEVERAGE.
[000:41:48;022] YOU ONLY HAVE 52 REPUBLICANS.
[000:41:49;523] SO BOTTOM LINE, THEY WANTED TO
[000:41:51;992] PASS THIS BUDGET FRAME WORK WITH
[000:41:53;794] THE TAX REFORM LANGUAGE IN IT IN
[000:41:58;832] ORDER TO GET THAT DONE.
[000:41:59;466] THAT WAS A POINT THE HOUSE
[000:42:00;134] SPEAKER MADE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR
[000:42:00;901] EARLIER TODAY.
[000:42:01;368] >> THERE'S ONE MORE THING THAT
[000:42:02;136] THIS BUDGET DOES THAT IS SO
[000:42:05;306] IMPORTANT.
[000:42:05;673] IT PAVES THE WAY FOR HISTORIC
[000:42:08;142] TAX REFORM.
[000:42:09;210] UNLOCKS THE RECONCILIATION
[000:42:10;844] PROCESS.
[000:42:11;378] WE NEED TO PASS THIS BUDGET SO
[000:42:13;214] THAT WE CAN DELIVER REAL RELIEF
[000:42:16;317] FOR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES.
[000:42:19;553] >> MITCH McCONNELL IS SELLING
[000:42:20;888] THIS AS A ONCE IN A GENERATION
[000:42:24;225] OPPORTUNITY TO FIX A BROKEN TAX
[000:42:25;759] CODE.
[000:42:26;327] SHEP?
[000:42:26;627] >> Shepard: WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS
[000:42:31;198] SAYING ABOUT THE BUDGET FRAME
[000:42:31;999] WORK PASSING?
[000:42:32;433] >> TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE
[000:42:35;102] BUDGET COMMITTEE IS BLASTING IT.
[000:42:36;704] HE SAYS THIS IS NOT ABOUT
[000:42:38;472] DELIVERING CONSERVATIVE
[000:42:40;341] PRINCIPLES IN TERMS OF CUTTING
[000:42:41;575] DEFICITS AND DEBT.
[000:42:42;376] HE SAYS THIS IS ABOUT USING
[000:42:45;579] SENATE RULES TO RAM THROUGH
[000:42:46;447] GIANT TAX GIVE AWAY TO THE
[000:42:48;249] WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS.
[000:42:49;450] THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER
[000:42:50;451] RIPPED IT AS WELL.
[000:42:53;153] >> THIS IS REALLY -- I USE THIS
[000:42:56;023] WORDS FROM TIME TO TIME AND SO
[000:42:58;259] APPROPRIATE -- PATHETIC.
[000:43:03;330] THIS BUDGET THAT THEY'RE PUTTING
[000:43:04;098] FORTH COMBINED WITH THEIR TAX
[000:43:04;865] PROPOSAL WILL ADD AROUND $2.4,
[000:43:08;869] NEARLY $2.5 TRILLION TO THE
[000:43:11;472] NATIONAL DEBT.
[000:43:11;972] >> ALL HOUSE DEMOCRATS AND 18
[000:43:13;474] HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST
[000:43:15;242] IT.
[000:43:15;509] IT STILL HAD ENOUGH VOTES TO
[000:43:17;845] PASS.
[000:43:18;579] SHEP?
[000:43:18;946] >> MIKE EMANUEL LIVE AT THE
[000:43:20;414] ROTUNDA.
[000:43:20;748] THANKS A LOT.
[000:43:21;448] THE U.S. IS BRACING FOR ANOTHER
[000:43:23;550] POTENTIAL HURRICANE THIS
[000:43:24;385] WEEKEND.
[000:43:24;952] RIGHT NOW IT'S A TROPICAL STORM.
[000:43:26;020] THE NAME IS NATE HEADED INTO THE
[000:43:28;589] GULF AND GENERALLY, AS YOU CAN
[000:43:30;391] SEE THERE, GENERALLY TOWARDS
[000:43:35;796] LOUISIANA, SOUTH MISSISSIPPI,
[000:43:36;563] LOWER ALABAMA.
[000:43:37;031] FORECASTERS SAY IT COULD GAIN
[000:43:38;766] SOME STRENGTH.
[000:43:39;400] DON'T EXPECT A MONSTER
[000:43:40;768] CATEGORY FIVE.
[000:43:41;235] NOTHING LIKE THAT.
[000:43:41;835] BUT RAIN, OH, THE RAIN IS
[000:43:42;903] COMING.
[000:43:44;672] Prudential asked these couples:
[000:43:48;342] how much money do you
[000:43:48;342] think you'll need in retirement?
[000:43:51;178] Then we found out how many years
[000:43:51;178] that money would last them.
[000:43:54;248] How long do you
[000:43:54;248] think we'll keep --
[000:43:55;382] Oooooohhh! You stopped!
[000:43:56;383] You're gonna leave me
[000:43:56;383] back here at year 9?
[000:43:58;919] How did this happen?
[000:44:00;387] It turned out, a lot
[000:44:00;387] of people fell short,
[000:44:02;423] of even the average
[000:44:02;423] length of retirement.
[000:44:04;425] We have to think about
[000:44:04;425] not when we expect to live to,
[000:44:07;661] but when we could live to.
[000:44:09;096] Let's plan for income that lasts
[000:44:09;096] all our years in retirement.
[000:44:13;267] Prudential.
[000:44:13;267] Bring your challenges.
[000:44:16;904] WE'RE ON A MISSION TO
[000:44:16;904] SHOW DRIP COFFEE DRINKERS,
[000:44:17;871] IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP TO KEURIG.
[000:44:19;273] WAKEY! WAKEY! RISE AND SHINE!
[000:44:21;141] OH MY GOSH!
[000:44:21;141] HOW ARE YOU?
[000:44:22;142] WELL WATCH THIS.
[000:44:22;810] I POP THAT IN THERE.
[000:44:23;677] PRESS BREW.
[000:44:24;445] THAT'S IT.
[000:44:25;512] LOOK HOW MUCH
[000:44:25;512] COFFEE'S IN HERE?
[000:44:26;380] FRESH COFFEE.
[000:44:27;548] SO RICH.
[000:44:28;449] I LOVE IT.
[000:44:29;616] THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD
[000:44:29;616] BE A KEURIG MAN!
[000:44:30;751] FULL-BODIED.
[000:44:32;186] ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE DESCRIBING
[000:44:32;186] THE COFFEE AND NOT ME?
[000:44:33;287] DO YOU WEAR THIS EVERY DAY?
[000:44:34;455] EVERYDAY.
[000:44:35;222] I'D NEVER TAKE IT OFF.
[000:44:36;256] ARE YOU READY TO
[000:44:36;256] SAY GOODBYE TO IT?
[000:44:37;224] GO! GO!
[000:44:39;960] TA DA! A TERRARIUM.
[000:44:42;296] THAT'S IT.
[000:44:43;163] WE BREWED THE LOVE, RIGHT GUYS?

[000:44:51;872] And this woman is laughing
[000:44:51;872] because she's pretending
[000:44:53;974] her boss's terrible
[000:44:53;974] story is funny.
[000:45:02;683] Still actually laughing.

[000:45:06;019] a human noise.

[000:46:54;661] >> Shepard: WEEKS AFTER MAJOR
[000:46:55;596] STORMS CAUSED SO MUCH
[000:46:57;030] DESTRUCTION IN TEXAS, FLORIDA
[000:46:58;565] AND PUERTO RICO AND BEYOND, THE
[000:47:00;567] GULF COAST IS BRACING FOR
[000:47:02;836] ANOTHER POSSIBLE HURRICANE.
[000:47:03;570] TROPICAL STORM NATE IS MAKING
[000:47:06;006] ITS WAY TO THE GULF OF MEXICO.
[000:47:07;508] FORECASTERS SAY IT COULD
[000:47:08;742] STRENGTHEN AND MAKE LANDFALL AS
[000:47:09;776] A HURRICANE THIS WEEKEND.
[000:47:11;478] AS YOU CAN SEE, THE CONE OF
[000:47:14;915] UNCERTAINTY ANYWHERE FROM
[000:47:15;983] EASTERN LOUISIANA ALL OF SOUTH
[000:47:17;117] MISSISSIPPI AND PARTS OF LOWER
[000:47:34;801] ALABAMA.
[000:47:35;135] EVEN INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE.
[000:47:35;936] LET'S GO TO RICK REICHMUTH.
[000:47:36;603] WHAT DO YOU THINK?
[000:47:37;104] >> RIGHT NOW CENTRAL AMERICA IS
[000:47:37;838] TAKING A WALLOP FROM THIS.
[000:47:38;472] A LOT OF MOISTURE AND
[000:47:39;039] MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ACROSS HERE.
[000:47:39;773] BECAUSE OF THAT, WE'LL SEE SOME
[000:47:40;507] SIGNIFICANT FLOODING.
[000:47:41;074] THE CENTER OF THIS IS OVER LAND
[000:47:41;808] RIGHT NOW.
[000:47:42;175] NO STRENGTHENING GOING.
[000:47:42;776] IT WILL MOVE BACK OUT
[000:47:42;776] ACROSS
[000:47:43;977] PARTS OF THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN
[000:47:46;580] AND MAKE A SECOND LANDFALL
[000:47:49;716] BEFORE GETTING BACK TO THE GULF.
[000:47:51;451] THAT'S WHERE WE'LL SEE MORE
[000:47:53;287] STRENGTHENING.
[000:47:53;720] SHORT TERM, SHEPARD, A LOT OF
[000:47:56;256] MOISTURE FOR CENTRAL AMERICA.
[000:47:57;224] SOME SPOTS,20 INCHES.
[000:47:58;625] THAT WILL CAUSE LANDSLIDES AND
[000:48:00;761] LOCAL FLOODING HERE.
[000:48:01;728] >> RICK, WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE
[000:48:03;230] ACROSS THE GULF BE PREPARED FOR
[000:48:05;132] NOW?
[000:48:05;432] >> SO A LOT OF OUR MODELS ARE
[000:48:08;001] KEEPING THIS KIND OF A STRONG
[000:48:09;202] TROPICAL STORM.
[000:48:09;770] A COUPLE OF MODELS GETTING IT
[000:48:11;605] TOWARDS HURRICANE STRENGTH.
[000:48:12;439] NONE OF THE MODELS MAKING THIS A
[000:48:13;974] MAJOR HURRICANE, WHICH IS A VERY
[000:48:15;542] IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE.
[000:48:17;711] OCTOBER, STILL AN ACTIVE TIME,
[000:48:20;013] ESPECIALLY FOR THE GULF AND THE
[000:48:21;848] CARIBBEAN.
[000:48:22;215] WE'RE GOING TO SEE RAIN HERE.
[000:48:27;654] BUT IT'S MOVING SO FAST, THE
[000:48:28;422] RAINFALL TOTALS WILL BE KEPT
[000:48:29;122] DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
[000:48:29;623] PROBABLY 4 TO 8 INCHES RANGE.
[000:48:30;390] IT WILL CAUSE SOME FLOODING.
[000:48:31;558] THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHEN DO
[000:48:34;061] WE GET GOING ONCE IT'S BACK OUT
[000:48:35;629] OVER THE GULF.
[000:48:36;263] THE GULF IS PLENTY WARM AT THIS
[000:48:37;631] TIME.
[000:48:37;931] THERE'S LIKELY WIND SHEAR TO
[000:48:39;032] BREAK THIS THING APART.
[000:48:40;133] THE TWO MODELS WE RELY ON MOST,
[000:48:42;703] GOOD AGREEMENT HERE, SOMEWHERE
[000:48:44;204] AROUND LOUISIANA, MAYBE OVER
[000:48:45;238] TOWARDS MISSISSIPPI OR THE
[000:48:46;473] ALABAMA COASTLINE.
[000:48:47;608] BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR CONE IS
[000:48:49;843] ACTUALLY NARROW AT THIS POINT.
[000:48:51;111] A LOT OF THE MODELLING PRETTY
[000:48:52;713] GOOD AGREEMENT.
[000:48:53;614] WHETHER WE GET TO THE HURRICANE
[000:48:55;048] STATUS OR NOT REMAINS TO BE
[000:49:00;420] SEEN.
[000:49:00;721] WE'LL HAVE A STRONG TROPICAL
[000:49:01;455] STORM HERE ACROSS PARTS OF THE
[000:49:02;222] GULF.
[000:49:02;522] THAT'S SATURDAY NIGHT INTO
[000:49:03;223] SUNDAY.
[000:49:03;557] WEEKEND A BAD WEEKEND.
[000:49:05;392] WE'LL SEE THE LOCALIZED FLOODING
[000:49:07;060] THERE AND AVOID ANY KIND OF A
[000:49:08;929] MAJOR HURRICANE FROM THIS ONE,
[000:49:10;564] SHEP.
[000:49:10;864] >> Shepard: HOPE SO.
[000:49:13;066] THANKS, RICK.
[000:49:15;168] WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
[000:49:17;237] LAS VEGAS GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.
[000:49:19;139] HER LAWYER SPEAKING NOW AFTER
[000:49:20;407] HOURS OF FBI QUESTIONING.
[000:49:21;341] WE'LL HAVE THAT NEXT.
[000:52:40;490] >> Shepard: THE GIRLFRIEND OF
[000:52:41;258] THE GUNMAN THAT KILLED 58
[000:52:41;258] PEOPLE
[000:53:07;517] IN LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK SAYS SHE
[000:53:08;285] HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING
[000:53:09;019] THE MASSACRE.
[000:53:09;452] THAT'S ACCORDING TO HER
[000:53:10;053] ATTORNEY.
[000:53:10;420] THE LAWYER READ A STATEMENT TO A
[000:53:11;154] CROWD OUTSIDE FBI HEAD QUARTERS
[000:53:11;888] IN L.A. AFTER AGENTS QUESTIONED
[000:53:12;622] HER FOR HOURS.
[000:53:13;056] HER NAME IS MARILOU DANLEY.
[000:53:13;723] SHE SAID THE KILLER SENT HER TO
[000:53:14;457] THE PHILIPPINES WHERE SHE HAD
[000:53:15;158] FAMILY AND SHE WAS OUT OF THE
[000:53:15;859] COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.
[000:53:16;593] WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IN THE WEST
[000:53:17;327] COAST NEWS HUB THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:53:18;028] WILLIAM?
[000:53:18;361] >> INVESTIGATORS HOPED THAT
[000:53:19;029] DANLEY WOULD TELL US WHY.
[000:53:19;663] A QUIET MILLIONAIRE WOULD
[000:53:22;465] SUDDENLY SHOOT 58 PEOPLE.
[000:53:24;334] SHE DIDN'T.
[000:53:25;068] SHE SAID THAT PADDOCK SENT HER A
[000:53:27;737] CHEAP TICKET AND SENT HER TO THE
[000:53:30;207] PHILIPPINES AS A GIFT.
[000:53:31;308] AS FOR THE $100,000 THAT
[000:53:34;077] FOLLOWED, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
[000:53:35;078] GOOD-BYE MONEY THAT PADDOCK WAS
[000:53:36;413] ENDING THEIR RELATIONSHIP.
[000:53:37;714] AT NO TIME DID SHE KNOW WHAT HE
[000:53:38;882] WAS GOING TO DO HERE'S DANLEY'S
[000:53:41;484] ATTORNEY READING HER STATEMENT.
[000:53:43;853] >> I KNEW STEPHEN PADDOCK AS A
[000:53:46;990] KIND, CARING, QUIET MAN.
[000:53:53;396] HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME OR
[000:53:54;231] TOOK ANY ACTION THAT I WAS AWARE
[000:53:56;566] OF THAT I UNDERSTOOD IN ANY WAY
[000:53:58;835] TO BE A WARNING THAT SOMETHING
[000:54:02;672] HORRIBLE LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO
[000:54:04;574] HAPPEN.
[000:54:06;443] >> STILL DANLEY'S HELP REMAINS
[000:54:09;179] CRUCIAL IN REBUILDING HIS LIFE,
[000:54:11;081] MENTAL HEALTH, WHAT HE BOUGHT
[000:54:12;782] AND WHEN HE BOUGHT IT.
[000:54:14;484] ANOTHER POSSIBLE LEAD THAT THE
[000:54:15;585] FBI HAS SAID THEY HAVE NOT HAD A
[000:54:17;654] PROBLEM ACCESSING PADDOCK'S
[000:54:19;990] ELECTRONIC FILES, COMPUTER AND
[000:54:23;393] PHONE THAT COULD CORROBORATE HER
[000:54:27;597] STORY.
[000:54:27;931] >> Shepard: THANK YOU, WILLIAM.
[000:54:29;099] THE UNLV FOOTBALL PLAYERS WILL
[000:54:31;601] BE WEARING A SPECIAL HELMET TO
[000:54:33;470] HONOR THE VICTIMS OF THE
[000:54:35;205] SHOOTING.
[000:54:35;572] THE SCHOOL TWEETED THIS PHOTO.
[000:54:36;506] THE PLAYERS TO WEAR THIS HELMET
[000:54:39;009] THIS SATURDAY AND THROUGH THE
[000:54:40;210] END OF THE SEASON.
[000:54:41;278] THE CAMPUS FROM UNLV IS A FEW
[000:54:43;480] MILES FROM THE SHOOTING.
[000:54:45;649] UNLV ANNOUNCED THAT SATURDAY
[000:54:47;784] NIGHT'S GAME AGAINST SAN DIEGO
[000:54:49;119] STATE WILL BE CALLED HERO'S
[000:54:51;121] NIGHT.
[000:54:51;421] THE PREGAME CEREMONY IS TO HONOR
[000:54:52;522] THE VICTIMS AND FIRST RESPONDERS
[000:54:57;994] OF THE DAY.
[000:54:58;395] WE'LL BE BACK WITH A LOOK AT
[000:54:59;129] WHEN THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS
[000:54:59;896] SECRET AGENT FIRST SHOWED UP ON
[000:55:01;831] THE BIG SCREEN.
[000:55:02;699] IT HAPPENED ON THIS DAY IN
[000:55:03;366] HISTORY.
[000:55:08;905] (Bell ringing)
[000:55:10;173] So, I was at Mom and Dad's
[000:55:10;173] and found this.
[000:55:12;208] CDs, baseball cards.
[000:55:14;077] Your old magic set?
[000:55:15;845] (Sigh)
[000:55:15;845] And this wrestling ticket.
[000:55:17;247] Which you still owe me for.
[000:55:18;715] Seriously? $25?
[000:55:20;483] I didn't even want to go.
[000:55:21;718] Ahh, your diary!
[000:55:24;054] "Mom says it is
[000:55:24;054] totally natural..."
[000:55:27;957] $25 is nothing.
[000:55:29;926] (Alert beep)
[000:55:31;227] Abracadabra, bro.
[000:55:33;496] Settle up with your friends
[000:55:33;496] on October 17th
[000:55:35;532] with the Bank of America
[000:55:35;532] Mobile Banking App.
[000:56:55;412] If you have moderate to severe
[000:56:55;412] Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's,
[000:56:59;315] and your symptoms have left you
[000:56:59;315] with the same view,
[000:57:02;819] it may be time for a different
[000:57:02;819] perspective.
[000:57:05;655] If other treatments haven't
[000:57:05;655] worked well enough,
[000:57:07;991] ask your doctor about ENTYVIO,
[000:57:09;826] the only biologic developed
[000:57:09;826] and approved
[000:57:11;828] just for UC and Crohn's.
[000:57:13;830] ENTYVIO works by focusing right
[000:57:13;830] in the GI-tract
[000:57:16;499] to help control damaging
[000:57:16;499] inflammation
[000:57:18;501] and is clinically proven to
[000:57:18;501] begin helping many patients
[000:57:21;171] achieve both symptom relief as
[000:57:21;171] well as remission.
[000:57:24;174] Infusion and serious allergic
[000:57:24;174] reactions
[000:57:26;176] can happen during or after
[000:57:26;176] treatment.
[000:57:28;178] ENTYVIO may increase risk of
[000:57:28;178] infection,
[000:57:30;180] which can be serious.
[000:57:31;514] While not reported with ENTYVIO,
[000:57:31;514] PML, a rare,
[000:57:34;017] serious brain infection caused
[000:57:34;017] by a virus may be possible.
[000:57:37;020] Tell your doctor if you have
[000:57:37;020] an infection,
[000:57:38;855] experience frequent infections,
[000:57:40;190] or have flu-like symptoms,
[000:57:40;190] or sores.
[000:57:42;192] Liver problems can occur
[000:57:42;192] with ENTYVIO.
[000:57:44;360] If your UC or Crohn's medication
[000:57:44;360] isn't working for you,
[000:57:47;464] ask your gastroenterologist
[000:57:47;464] about ENTYVIO.
[000:57:49;966] ENTYVIO. Relief and remission
[000:57:49;966] within reach.
[000:57:54;037] It's OK
[000:57:55;071] that everybody
[000:57:55;071] ignores me
[000:57:55;071] when I drive.
[000:57:56;539] It's fine, 'cause I get
[000:57:56;539] a Safe Driving Bonus Check
[000:57:58;475] every six months
[000:57:58;475] I'm accident-free.
[000:57:59;976] And I don't share it
[000:57:59;976] with Mom. Right, Mom?
[000:58:02;412] Right.
[000:58:03;446] Safe Driving Bonus Checks,
[000:58:04;814] only from Allstate.
[000:58:05;982] Switching to Allstate
[000:58:05;982] is worth it.
[000:58:18;461] >> Shepard: THE ASTRONAUTS ON
[000:58:19;229] THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
[000:58:19;996] HAVE PERFORMED A HAND
[000:58:21;264] TRANSPLANT.
[000:58:22;031] THE PATIENTS A GIANT ROBOTIC
[000:58:24;067] ARM.
[000:58:24;334] IT'S A 58-FOOT ARM THAT HELPS
[000:58:27;937] GRAB INCOMING SPACE CRAFT.
[000:58:29;806] ONE OF THE TWO HANDS
[000:58:31;741] MALFUNCTIONED A COUPLE MONTHS
[000:58:32;742] AGO AND ASTRONAUTS OUT
[000:58:34;244] INSTALLING A NEW ONE SO THE ARM
[000:58:36;779] CAN GRAB A SUPPLY SHIP SCHEDULED
[000:58:39;916] FOR NEXT MONTH.
[000:58:42;385] ON THIS DAY IN 1962, THE VERY
[000:58:47;290] FIRST JAMES BOND MOVIE
[000:58:48;691] PREMIERED.
[000:58:49;092] "DR. NO" DEBUTED IN LONDON BASED
[000:58:50;994] ON A BOOK BY IAN FLEMING.
[000:58:53;830] SEAN CONNERRY WAS THE FIRST OO7.
[000:58:59;502] THE FIRST SOPHISTICATED SUPPLY
[000:59:03;172] WITH THE TASTE FOR DRY MARTINIS
[000:59:11;114] AND GADGETS.
[000:59:14;117] THIS ALL HAPPENED 55 YEARS AGO
[000:59:20;523] TODAY.
[000:59:20;823] SHOULD NEWS BREAK OUT, WE'LL
[000:59:21;558] BREAK IN.
[000:59:21;925] BREAKING NEWS CHANGES EVERYTHING
[000:59:22;659] ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:59:23;192] ANOTHER INCREDIBLE DAY ON THE
[000:59:23;893] DOW.
[000:59:24;160] WE HAVE A LOT OF FINANCIAL
[000:59:24;894] PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THIS
[000:59:26;129] BUILDING.
[000:59:26;496] NOT ON THE FLOORS WHERE WE ARE.
[000:59:28;531] ONE EXPLAINED TO US YESTERDAY,
[000:59:29;899] THE PRICES AND THE EARNINGS
[000:59:31;367] AND -- I'M LOOK NO.
[000:59:32;535] IS IT GOING UP OR DOWN?
[000:59:34;304] HE WAS LIKE IF I KNEW THAT, I
[000:59:35;838] WOULDN'T BE HERE.
[000:59:36;506] TODAY THE ANSWER IS UP.
[000:59:38;741] IT'S UP ALSO HALF A POINT.
[000:59:40;710] THE S&P IS UP.
[000:59:41;611] SO IS THE RUSSELL AND EVERYTHING
[000:59:43;246] IS UP.
[000:59:43;846] WHY IS IT ALL UP?
[000:59:45;214] BECAUSE CAVUTO IS IN CHARGE.
[000:59:46;849] WHEN NEIL CAVUTO IS IN CHARGE,
[000:59:52;322] EVERYTHING ALWAYS GOES UP.
[000:59:53;022] "YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL CAVUTO IS

[001:00:19;482] INDEED STOCKS ARE UP ACROSS THE

[001:00:25;154] ALL THE MAJOR AVERAGES RUNNING A

[001:00:27;991] THE NASDAQ.
[001:00:29;993] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE
[001:00:30;960] HAVEN'T SEEN IN 20 YEARS.
[001:00:32;562] WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THAT IN A
[001:00:34;230] SECOND.
[001:00:34;564] WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A PUSH TO
[001:00:36;132] THIS WITH SPEAKER PAUL RYAN
[001:00:37;767] WRAPPING UP REMARKS EARLIER ON
[001:00:39;636] IN MARYLAND WHERE HE WAS
[001:00:41;471] ACTUALLY PUSHING FOR TAX CUTS.
[001:00:42;939] THE HOUSE APPROVED A BUDGET SORT
[001:00:44;540] OF PLAN OF THEIR OWN THAT
[001:00:45;675] THEY'RE KICKING TO THE SENATE TO
[001:00:46;643] COME UP WITH THEIR OWN.
[001:00:47;910] IN THE COURSE OF HIS REMARKS,
[001:00:50;847] BESIDES PUSHING FOR TAX CUTS
[001:00:51;848] THAT LOOK LIKE A BETTER THING,
[001:00:57;453] HE DID TALK ABOUT THE NEED TO
[001:00:58;221] LOOK INTO THIS BUMP STOCK
[001:00:58;888] MECHANISM THAT COULD ALLOW A
