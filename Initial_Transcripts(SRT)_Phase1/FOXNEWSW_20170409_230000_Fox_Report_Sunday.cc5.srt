I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE YOU

372
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
HAVE GOTTEN WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD.

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
>> THE FIRST PLACE I STARTED WAS

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
IN THE HUD BUILDING.

375
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE

376
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
FROM 10 - OF 40 YEARS AND THEY

377
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
INFORMATION.
I'M STILL GETTING INFORMATION

379
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
FROM THEM.
AS I HAVE GONE TO SOME OF THE

380
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
CITIES, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

381
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
HAS IMPRESSED ME AND WORKED
EXTRAORDINARY WHILE WAS THE

382
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND

383
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL

384
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
DOLLARS IN SOME PLACES LIKE

385
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
DETROIT, AT A RATE OF 8 - 1.

386
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
THIS GETS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY

387
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
INVESTED IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVE

388
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
THE PROJECT SUCCEEDS.

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SO YOU DON'T HAVE JUST THESE

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
FEDERAL PEOPLE LOOKING OVER
EVERYBODY'S SHOULDER.

392
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I THINK THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
>> YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING?

394
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOREIGN

395
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
POLICY THAT WE HAVE NOT TALKED

396
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
AS MUCH ABOUT DOMESTIC POLICY

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEN

398
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
CANDIDATE WANTED TO FOCUS ON IN

399
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
URBAN AREAS.
CREATING JOBS IS AN AREA HE

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THOUGHT HE COULD WIN VICTORY.

401
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
GOING FORWARD, WHAT YOU SEE IS

402
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THE PLAN?

403
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I HAVE BEEN READING THAT YOU

404
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WILL BE LEANING ON RICH URBAN

405
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
HOMEOWNERS TO BE HELPING OUT

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

407
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
HAVE YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT

408
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT

409
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
THAT?

410
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
>> THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE VERY

411
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
WELL ALIGNED.

412
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS ALREADY

413
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
IN PLACE, LIKE SECTION THREE

414
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
WHICH REQUIRES THOSE PEOPLE

415
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
RECEIVING HOUSING FUNDS TO

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
EMPLOY SOME OF THE LOW INCOME

417
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

418
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
IT HAS BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED

419
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE

420
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
PEOPLE FREQUENTLY DO NOT HAVE

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
THE SKILLS.

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS A WAY
TO, AHEAD OF TIME, MAYBE A YEAR

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE MAJOR

424
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
PROJECT, GO IN AND TRAIN PEOPLE.

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT EXCUSE.

426
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
WE HAVE MORE EMPLOYMENT OF

427
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP WITH
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.

428
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
NOW THEY HAVE A SKILL THAT

429
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TRAINS THEM.

430
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THESE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO DO

431
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
WITH TO DEVELOP OUR PEOPLE.

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
NOT JUST PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR
HEAD.

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DEVELOPING THE WHOLE PERSON.
THAT MEANS WORKING WITH THE

434
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THE

435
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,
TRANSPORTATION, HHS, A NUMBER OF

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THINGS TO CREATE VIBRANT

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
COMMUNITIES.

438
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT 8 - 1 WHEN

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
YOU LOOK AT THE PRIVATE PUBLIC

440
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
PARTNERSHIP AND HOW FAR PUBLIC

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
DOLLARS WOULD GO.
I IMAGINE THAT'S IMPORTANT.

442
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE BUDGET
PROPOSAL WOULD CUT THE

443
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
DEPARTMENT AT HUD BY MORE THAN

444
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
13%.

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO HAVING

446
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
TO DO THE JOB ON LESS MONEY FOR

447
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
YOUR DEPARTMENT?

448
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT

449
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
EFFICIENCIES.

450
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
HOW DO WE CARVE OUT AND GET THE

451
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
BANK FOR OUR BUCK.

452
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
ALSO, THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
INTERESTED IN HURTING PEOPLE AND
PUTTING PEOPLE OUT ON THE

454
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
STREET.

455
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING

456
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SURE THAT WE ARE EFFICIENT AND

457
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
THAT WE ARE COMPASSIONATE, NOT

458
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
ONLY TO THE PEOPLE TODAY BUT THE

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
PEOPLE TOMORROW.

460
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN OWES

461
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
$60000 IN TERMS OF OUR NATIONAL

462
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
DEBT.
WE HAVE TO START LOOKING OUT FOR

463
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING AFTER

464
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
US.

465
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
WE CANNOT JUST IGNORE THAT.

466
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
MANY NATIONS HAVE TRIED THAT IN

467
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THE PAST AND IT HAS BEEN

468
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
DETRIMENTAL TO THEM.

469
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
>> THE VIDEO WE SHOWED AT THE

470
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
TOP WAS YOU AND YOUR FORMER HOME

471
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
OF DETROIT.

472
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
WE KNOW THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

473
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
HOW MUCH THEY HAVE SUFFERED BOTH

474
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
ECONOMICALLY AND EVEN IN TERMS

475
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT WITH

476
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THE DRINKING WATER AND SOME OF

477
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THE PROBLEMS THERE.

478
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
OVER YEARS AND DECADES OF

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
LIBERAL LEADERSHIP AND DEMOCRATS

480
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
IN OFFICE.
POLITICS COME UP IN YOUR

481
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
LISTENING TO HER?

482
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
>> NOT VERY MUCH.

483
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I HAVE DEALT WITH BOTH

484
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
THE ISSUES THAT FACE US ARE NOT

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT ISSUES.

486
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
WE HAVE 3 - 4 TIMES THE NUMBER

487
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
OF PEOPLE WHO NEED AFFORDABLE

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
HOUSING THE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION,

490
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
BABY BOOMERS WHO NEED TO RETIRE

491
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
BUT DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO

492
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
DO SO BECAUSE THEIR 4O1 KAYS

493
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
HAVE NOT DONE MUCH IN THE PAST

494
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
TEN YEARS.

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
WE HAVE GOT TO BE CREATIVE AND

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
THINK OUT-OF-THE-BOX IN ORDER TO

497
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
MAINTAIN A REASONABLE LIFESTYLE

498
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

499
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
THIS CERTAINLY CANNOT BE A PART

500
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
OF SOMETHING.
>> REAL QUICK, BEFORE I LET YOU

501
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
GO YOU SEEM TO BE RIGHT ON

502
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
TARGET WITH THIS I KNOW YOU TO

503
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
CRITICISM EARLY ON, BUT THIS IS

504
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
IN YOUR WHEELHOUSE, YOU'VE GONE
BACK TO THE URBAN AREAS.

505
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST

506
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
WORD.
>> OKAY.

507
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THE LAST WORD IS THAT WE ONLY

508
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
HAVE 330 MILLI- PEOPLE IN

509
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
AMERICA.
ONE QUARTER WHAT CHINA HAS, ONE

510
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
QUARTER OF WHAT INDIA HAS.

511
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
WE HAVE GOT TO DEVELOP ALL OF

512
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
OUR PEOPLE IF WE ARE GOING TO

513
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
COMPETE IN THE FUTURE.

514
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
THAT MEANS TAKING A HOLISTIC

515
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
APPROACH.

516
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
>> NEXT, WHERE YOU GOING?

517
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
>> HEADING OFF TO MIAMI.

518
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I WILL BE GOING THERE THIS WEEK.

519
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'M SURE WE'LL SEE A LOT OF

520
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
GREAT THINGS THERE.

521
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
WERE LOOKING NOT ONLY THE

522
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
POSITIVE THINGS BUT THE NEGATIVE

523
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
THINGS BECAUSE WE CAN LEARN FROM
BOTH.

524
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
>> YOU HEARD IT HERE HERE FIRST.

525
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR

526
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
CARSON.

527
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
POLICE IN SWEDEN ARE RELEASING

528
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEADLY

529
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
TRUCK ATTACK IN STOCKHOLM.

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
WHY POLICE SAY HE WAS ALREADY

531
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
BEING SOUGHT.
HE WAS ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH

532
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
THEIR FINGERS.

533
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Make sure the germs they
bring home don't stick around.

534
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Use Clorox
disinfecting products.

535
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Because no one kills germs
better than Clorox.

536
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I USE WHAT'S
ALREADY INSIDE ME

537
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
TO REACH MY GOALS.

538
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
SO I LIKED WHEN
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME

539
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
THAT I MAY REACH
MY BLOOD SUGAR
AND A1C GOALS

540
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
BY ACTIVATING
WHAT'S WITHIN ME

541
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

542
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
TRULICITY IS
NOT INSULIN.

543
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
IT HELPS ACTIVATE
MY BODY TO DO WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO

544
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
RELEASE ITS
OWN INSULIN.

545
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TRULICITY RESPONDS WHEN
MY BLOOD SUGAR RISES.

546
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
AND IT WORKS 24/7.

547
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN.

548
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

549
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

550
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN
ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

551
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
WHEN USED WITH
DIET AND EXERCISE.

552
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000

IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST

TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000

FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS

674
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT, THE NATION,

675
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
AND WHAT COMES NEXT.

676
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
CONGRESSMAN SCOTT TAYLOR FROM

677
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
VIRGINIA IS COMING UP NEXT.

678
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I was given warfarin
in the hospital,

679
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
but wondered, was this the
best treatment for me?

680
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So I asked my doctor.

681
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And he recommended ELIQUIS.

682
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots

683
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and reduces the risk of
them happening again.

684
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots.

685
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
ELIQUIS also had

686
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
significantly
less major
bleeding

687
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
than the
standard
treatment.

688
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Both made me
turn around my
thinking.

689
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Don't stop ELIQUIS
unless your doctor tells you to.

690
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

691
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
an artificial heart valve

692
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
or abnormal bleeding.

693
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
If you had a spinal injection
while on ELIQUIS

694
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
call your doctor right away

695
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
if you have tingling,
numbness, or muscle weakness.

696
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
While taking ELIQUIS,
you may bruise more easily

697
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
...and it may take longer
than usual for bleeding to stop.

698
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Seek immediate medical care
for sudden signs of bleeding,

699
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
like unusual bruising.

700
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
ELIQUIS may increase
your bleeding risk

701
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
if you take
certain medicines.

702
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Tell your doctor
about all planned

703
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
medical or dental
procedures.

704
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
ELIQUIS treats
DVT and PE
blood clots.

705
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Plus had
less major
bleeding.

706
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Both made ELIQUIS
the right treatment for me.

707
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Ask your doctor if switching
to ELIQUIS is right for you.

729
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
ATTACK THAT SPURRED THAT

730
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
OPERATION SAID PEOPLE SHOULD

731
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
FORGET THE POLITICS.

732
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THAT MAN LOST HIS WIFE.

733
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
YOU PROBABLY SEEN THE PICTURE
GONE VIRAL OF HIM HOLDING HIS

734
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
TWIN BABIES.

735
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THE ASSAD REGIME TOOK THEM OUT

736
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

737
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
HE SAID THE U.S. SHOULD DO MORE

738
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
NOW, NOT JUST ONE STRIKE.

739
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
NOT ALL SYRIANS AGREE.

740
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
ENGINEMEN HALL HAS THE STORY

741
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
FROM TURKEY.

742
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
>> IT WAS WATCHING VIDEOS OF

743
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THIS HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK

744
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
WHICH DROVE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO

745
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
INTERVENE.

746
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
WHILE SPEAKING TODAY PEOPLE ARE

747
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
DIVIDED UP IT IS EASY TO

748
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT DROVE HIM.
IT WAS ALSO AN INCREDIBLY

749
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
SOBERING MOMENT.

750
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
AMONG THE FAMILIES WE SPOKE TO

751
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
WAS ABDUL, HE HAS BECOME THE

752
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
FACE OF THE TRAGEDY.
HE WAS REUNITED WITH FAMILY

753
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
MEMBERS WHO DID SURVIVE, THOUGH

754
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
HE LOST 22.

755
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
HE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS

756
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
HE SAW.
>> AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE, THE

757
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
WHOLE FAMILY WAS DEAD.

758
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
GROWN-UPS, DEAD.

759
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
FAMILY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

760
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, MY

761
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
BROTHER, HIS WIFE, THEIR

762
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
CHILDREN, MY NIECES, ALL OF THEM

763
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
DEAD.

764
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I FAINTED.

765
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
>> AMONG THE DEAD, HIS 11 MONTH
OLD TWINS.

766
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
HE BURIED THEM IN HIS WIFE WITH

767
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
HIS OWN HANDS, BUT CANNOT BEAR
TO PUT THEM IN THE GROUND,

768
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
GRIPPING THEM TILL THE BITTER

769
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
END.
HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT THE

770
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AMERICAN STRIKES.
>> I WANT TO TELL PRESIDENT

771
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
TRUMP, THE FIRST STRIKE WAS

772
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
GOOD, IT SAVED US.

773
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
BUT JUST A FEW HOURS LATER THE

774
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
AIRBAGS CONTINUED WORKING, IT'S
LIKE A CHALLENGE FROM ASSAD.

775
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I CAN STILL ATTACK FROM THE SAME

776
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
BASE YOU ATTACKED.

777
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
>> NOT ONLY A PLANE STILL TAKING

778
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
OFF FROM THE AIRBASE, THERE

779
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
STILL BOMBING THE TOWN.

780
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
APPARENTLY ADD A GREATER PACE
THAN BEFORE, WITH NOBODY TO STOP

781
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
THEM.
>> ASSAD IS A CRIMINAL.

782
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
HE IS KILLING NOT ONLY HUMAN

783
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
BEINGS AND CHILDREN, BUT ANIMALS
AS IF THEY WERE THE SAME.

784
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL.

785
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
>> THE FEELING IS ONE OF

786
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
GRATITUDE TOWARD THE U.S.

787
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
THE STRIKES GIVE THE SYRIAN BITE
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND

788
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE.

789
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
BUT THE LESS THEY HAVE DONE TO

790
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
BACK UP THE ASSAD REGIME, HE

791
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
WILL CONTINUE TO KILL HIS PEOPLE

792
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
LIKE HE HAS DONE FOR THE LAST

793
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
SIX YEARS.

794
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
>> Harris: MY NEXT GUEST,

795
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO

796
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
LAUNCH THE MISSILE STRIKE ON
SYRIA.

797
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
HE OPPOSES THE LEGAL BASIS ON
WHICH YOU ORDER THAT MISSION.

798
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN,

799
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
SCOTT TAYLOR IS A MEMBER OF THE

800
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
HOUSE APPROPRIATION ON HOMELAND
SECURITY.

801
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
THE U.S. NAVY SEAL, HE HAS
SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN THAT WAY.

802
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

803
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I WANT TO START WITH WHERE YOU

804
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
ARE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE

805
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
PRESIDENT AND WHY YOU SAY
CONGRESS NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY

806
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
GET INVOLVED NOW?

807
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
>> LET'S BE CLEAR.

808
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY

809
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND
FLEXIBILITY AS A PRESIDENT THAT

810
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
HE OR SHE SEE SOMETHING AS A

811
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

812
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
TOWARD TROOPS AND INTEREST THEY

813
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
HAVE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

814
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
ASK.

815
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
WITH THAT BEING SAID, CONGRESS

816
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
DECLARES WAR OR CREATE STATUTORY

817
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR USE OF

818
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
FORCE.

819
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THIS PRESIDENT, AND THE PREVIOUS

820
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
PRESIDENT, TWO ADMINISTRATIONS
OPERATING OFF USE OF MILITARY

821
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
FORCE FROM 16 YEARS AGO FROM A

822
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
THIRD ADMINISTRATION.

823
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
CONGRESS DOES NEED TO LEAD AND

824
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THAT NEED TO HAVE A VOICE IN

825
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
THIS.

826
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I'VE SEEN MANY CONGRESSMEN AND

827
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
WOMEN ON NATIONAL NEWS IN THE

828
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
PAST FEW DAYS BECAUSE OF THE

829
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
STRIKE.
THE BEST THING WE CAN DO AS

830
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
LEADERS IN CONGRESS IS TO TAKE

831
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
IT UP IN DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT

832
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
IT.
THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE THE

833
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
ABILITY TO ACT.

834
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HE HAS THAT TIME AND FLEXIBILITY

835
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
TO DO SO.

836
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
UNDER THE UN CHEMICAL WEAPONS

837
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
TREATY, YOU CANNOT PRODUCE,

838
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
DEVELOP, OR USE CHEMICAL

839
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
WEAPONS, I DO SUPPORT THE

840
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
PRESIDENT AND HIS ACTION.

841
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I THINK THE WORLD WAS WATCHING

842
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND I SUPPORT

843
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
HIS DECISION TO TAKE ACTION AND

844
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SAY THAT WILL NOT STAND.

845
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
>> Harris: PEOPLE HERE YOU AND I

846
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
CAN SEE EYES GLAZING OVER.
CONGRESS CUT SEEM TO AGREE ON

847
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
ANYTHING.
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,

848
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU

849
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
ARE WORKING OFF A 16-YEAR-OLD

850
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
AUTHORIZATION OF MILITARY FORCE
TO GET THIS DONE.

851
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
DO YOU REALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE

852
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
THAT IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER YOU

853
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GIVE THE

854
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
PRESIDENT SUPPORT HE NEEDS?

855
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> THAT THE NEXT ONE QUESTION.

856
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
BECAUSE CONGRESS IS SLOW TO

857
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
DEBATE AND THERE'S DIVERGING
INTEREST THERE, THERE THE

858
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVE.

859
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THAT'S WHEN EXECUTIVE HAS
FLEXIBILITY IN TIME TO TAKE

860
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ACTION IF THEY DEEM FIT.

861
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
BUT, LEADERS MUST ACT.
LEADERS MUST LEAVE.

862
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE

863
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
A SAY IN USE OF MILITARY FORCE

864
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
AROUND THE WORLD.

865
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
THAT BEING SAID, HOW TO HAVE A
SAY?

866
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN
CONGRESS.

867
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
IT'S IMPORTANT THEIR VOICES LIKE

868
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
MYSELF FOR SPEAKING OUT SAME

869
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
CONGRESS MUST TAKE THIS OUT AND

870
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
DEBATED.

871
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER

872
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
BIPARTISAN AND SAY WHAT WERE

873
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
GOING TO DO.

874
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
IF WERE GOING TO AUTHORIZE THE
USE OF MILITARY FORCE FOR LONGER

875
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
TIME ARE NOT.

876
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
>> Harris: HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION

877
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
THAT HAS BEEN LINGERING, THAT IS

878
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
OUR COMPLETE MISSION.

879
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
AS A FORMER NAVY SEAL YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENDGAME IT

880
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES AND KEEPS

881
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
OUR VISION CRISP.
IT KEEPS THINGS FROM VEERING UP

882
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
AND BECOMING OTHER THINGS.

883
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE?

884
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
TO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS?

885
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
>> THAT'S NEXT LINE POINT.

886
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
WERE NOT GOOD TO BE TALKING

887
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
ABOUT TACTICS, STRATEGY -WISE

888
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
IT'S IMPORTANT.

889
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD COME

890
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
TO CONGRESS AND TALK ABOUT THE

891
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
INTELLIGENCE, THE GOALS, THE END

892
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
STATE.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYRIA, IT'S

893
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
A POWDER CAKE, ANYTHING THAT I'M

894
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
AWARE OF SINCE WORLD WAR II YOU

895
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
HAVE TURKEY, US, ISRAEL, RUSSIA,

896
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
OTHERS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL.

897
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

898
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I RAN AS WELL, HEZBOLLAH.
YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL

899
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
FOR FLASHPOINT.

900
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
AND NOT ENOUGH TO COMPLEXION A

901
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
POTENTIALLY GREATER CONFLICT.

902
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT

903
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ENDGAME
AND THE STRATEGY AND THE GOAL OF

904
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
THE UNITED STATES.

905
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
>> Harris: WE ARE WAITING TO

906
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
HEAR THAT IS GOING TO BE.

907
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
YOU HEARD THAT FATHER IN SYRIA
WHO LOST HIS TWINS, AMERICA DO

908
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
MORE THAN ONE STRIKE.

909
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
ARE YOU CONCERNED THE EMOTION

910
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
BASED UPON THE NEED FOR POLICY?

911
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
HOW DO YOU KEEP THEM SEPARATE?

912
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
>> IT IS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND

913
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
WATCHING THE IMAGES AND

914
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
LISTENING TO THAT FAMILY.

915
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
IT DOES TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.

916
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LEADERS TO

917
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
BE ABLE TO SEE CLARITY THROUGH

918
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
CHAOS.

919
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGY AND

920
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THE GOALS ARE.

921
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
WE CANNOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM

922
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVEN

923
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
SYRIA SIGNED ONTO THE CHEMICAL

924
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
WEAPONS CONVENTION AS WELL.

925
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
IT'S IMPORTANT THE WORLD'S LEAD

926
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
AND THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT

927
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
CANNOT AND WILL NOT STAND.

928
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THE PRESIDENT TOOK DECISIVE
ACTION AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY

929
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT THAN THE

930
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
LAST ONE.
WHEN YOU HAVE DIPLOMACY THAT THE

931
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
WORLD AGREES WITH YOU HAVE TO

932
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
BACK IT UP WITH FORCE.

933
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

934
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
>> Harris: YOU SAY YOU ARE READY

935
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
TO STEP UP AND BEGIN THAT
LEADING IN CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE

936
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT

937
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
HE NEEDS.
WHEN YOU COME BACK, I WANT TO

938
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
TALK ABOUT VETERANS AFFAIRS.
YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS

939
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
DONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO

940
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT

941
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
PART OF DOMESTIC POLICY.
WE'LL BRING YOU BACK.

942
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANOTHER
TIME, DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

943
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
>> I'M OPTIMISTIC AND POSITIVE

944
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THAT WERE GONNA GET STUFF DONE

945
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
AT THE VIRGINIA.
THANK YOU.

946
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
>> Harris: THANK YOU FOR YOUR

947
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
TIME.

948
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
POPE FRANCIS IS WEIGHING IN ON

949
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
THE DEADLY BOMBING SAID TO

950
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN EGYPT.

951
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THE POPE IS CONDEMNING THE

952
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
ATTACKS HAS THAT HAPPENED AS HE

953
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
WAS HOLDING HIS PALM SUNDAY MASS
AT THE VATICAN.

954
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
HE OFFERED HIS CONDOLENCES AND

955
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
SAID HE IS PAYING FOR THOSE WHO
DIED.

956
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
THE BOMBING BECAME'S WEEKS BE

957
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
FOR HIS VISIT TO CAIRO.

958
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SEARCHING FOR

959
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AN END WITH DOMESTIC ISSUES.

960
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT

961
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THE VIRGINIA IN COMING WEEKS AS

962
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WELL.

963
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
THE PRESIDENT IS NOW TURNING

964
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
TOWARD TAX REFORM.

965
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
WE'LL HAVE TO TURN TO DEMOCRATS

966
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
TO GET SOMETHING DONE, TO HELP

967
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
HIS PRIORITIES BECOME A REALITY?

968
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
WE'LL TALK WITH MY NEXT GUEST,

969
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
DEMOCRAT.
DEMOCRAT.
NEW DETAILS ON A MANHUNT FOR A

970

SUSPECT POLICE CALL A NATIONAL

971
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THREAT.

972
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
STAY WITH US

973
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Maybe you should've done
more research on them.

974
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
For drivers with
Accident Forgiveness,

975
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Liberty Mutual won't raise
your rates

976
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
due to your first accident.

977
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Liberty Mutual Insurance.

978
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
due to your first accident.
Aleve with
DTENS Device,y

979
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
a relief from
lower back pain.

980
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's good, cause I need it.

981
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I put it on my back.

982
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Ok, this is interesting.

983
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
There we go.
There's the little tingle.

984
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I feel this electrical pulse
grabbing at my muscles.

985
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Level 3. 5.

986
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I'm pleasantly surprised.

987
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
It was more powerful
than I was expecting it to be.

988
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It worked. What can I say?
I believe Aleve.

At Red Lobster's Lobsterfestime.

991
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
any of these 9 lobster dishes
could be yours.

992
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So don't resist delicious new
Lobster Mix and Match

993
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
or Lobsterfest Surf and Turf

994
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
because you won't have this
chance for long.

995
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
WHY PAUSE A
SPONTANEOUS MOMENT?

996
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
CIALIS FOR DAILY USE TREATS ED
AND THE URINARY SYMPTOMS OF BPH.

997
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT YOUR MEDICINES,

998
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

999
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

1000
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
OR ADEMPAS® FOR
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,

1001
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

1002
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IN EXCESS.

1003
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

1004
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

1005
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS OF HEARING OR VISION,

1006
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
OR AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
STOP TAKING CIALIS

1007
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

1008
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CIALIS.

1009
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
>> HIM
.

1010
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
>> Harris: PROTESTERS TAKEN TO

SPEAK OUT OF AGAINST PRESIDENT

1013
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING

1014
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AREN'T

1015
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
MARCHING TO MILES WHAT IS CALLED

1016
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
THE MEGA MARCH.

1017
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
THEY'RE PACKED INTO SAID HE

1018
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
HALTED AND THE DEMONSTRATION.

1019
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THEY EXPECT ABOUT 100,000

1020
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
PEOPLE.

1021
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
THEY DID THAT BEFORE IN 2006, I

1022
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,000
THINK IT WAS.

1023
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
BACK TO WASHINGTON WHERE

1024
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LOOKING TO

1025
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
MOVE ON WITH HIS DOMESTIC
AGENDA.

1026
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
AFTER FAILING TO REPEAL OBAMA
CARE, HE AND CONGRESS ARE

1027
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
GEARING UP TO TACKLE TAX REFORM.

1028
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
EARLY SIGNS INDICATE A TOUGH
FIGHT AHEAD.

1029
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
WITH EVEN REPUBLICANS
DISAGREEING OVER KEY PARTS OF A

1030
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
PROPOSED PLAN.

1031
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
CAN PRESIDENT TRUMP GET

1032
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
DEMOCRATS ON HIS SIDE?

1033
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
MY NEXT GUEST HAS EXPERIENCE

1034
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
WORKING WITH THE OTHER SIDE OF

1035
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THE POLITICAL AISLE FROM THE

1036
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
WEST WING.

1037
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
HE SPENT SIX YEARS WITH

1038
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON IN THE
1990s, DOUG SHOWING.

1039
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL CLINTON

1040
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
AND A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND

1041
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
FRIEND, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ABOUT

1042
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

1043
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
PRESIDENT CLINTON PROBABLY

1044
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
TEACHES A FEW THINGS ABOUT

1045
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
DEALING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE,

1046
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
RIGHT?

1047
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
HE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT

1048
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
CONGRESSES, THE FIRST ALL

1049
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
DEMOCRAT, THE NEXT THREE FOR THE

1050
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
REST OF HIS PRESIDENCIES HE WAS

1051
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
STACKED AGAINST REPUBLICANS.

1052
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

1053
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
>> BIPARTISANSHIP.
WHAT WAS I CALL TRIANGULATION.

1054
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
CANDIDLY, WITH DONALD TRUMP

1055
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
FIGHTING WITH REPUBLICANS, HE

1056
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
HAS TO IF HE IS GOING TO

1057
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
SUCCEED, BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF

1058
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
LAST WEEK'S RAID AND BEGIN

1059
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
BIPARTISAN OUTREACH TO THE

1060
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
DEMOCRATS.

1061
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
>> Harris: LAST WEEK'S RAID?

1062
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
WHAT YOU MEAN?

1063
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
>> THE ATTACK ON SYRIA FOLLOWI

1064
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
FOLLOWING.
>> BECAUSE HE HAS BIPARTISAN

1065
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
SUPPORT ON THAT.

1066
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
>> YES, NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK
SCHUMER.

1067
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
NOW, GIVEN THE FACT THAT
REPUBLICANS ON HEALTHCARE ARE

1068
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
DIVIDED BETWEEN THE FREEDOM

1069
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:12,000
CAUCUS, THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE
REPUBLICANS AND MODERATES, HE

1070
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
REALLY HAS TO IF HE IS GOING TO

1071
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
SUCCEED.
WHETHER IT BE A TAX REFORM,

1072
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
HEALTHCARE, OR INFRASTRUCTURE.

1073
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
>> Harris: LET'S STAY WITH TAX
REFORM NOW.

1074
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT PRESIDENT
CLINT OUT WITH.

1075
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I WANT TO DO APPLES AND APPLES.

1076
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
WHO DOES THE PRESIDENT REALLY

1077
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
NEED TO REACH OUT TO?

1078
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
>> THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT WE

1079
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
NEED TO DO CORPORATE TAX REFORM.

1080
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
WE NEED TO REPATRIATE THE MONEY

1081
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
THAT MAY BE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS

1082
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
THAT ARE OVERSEAS AND LOWER THE

1083
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
RATE.

1084
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
>> Harris: AND HE HAS SAID THAT,

1085
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
HUNDRED DEMOCRATS FEEL?

1086
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
>> DEMOCRATS FEEL FINE ABOUT IT.
THEY DON'T WANT TO REDUCE TAXES

1087
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
ON THE WEALTHY WHICH IS ONE OF

1088
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
HIS SIGNATURE INITIATIVES AS

1089
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
WELL.

1090
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
IF THEY CAN BE BROKEN UP AND BE

1091
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
DONE AS BITE-SIZE INITIATIVES

1092
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
MAYBE WE CAN GET SUCCESS.
>> Harris: WHO TAKES A BITE IN

1093
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
TERMS EVERY PETRI MONEY

1094
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
OVERSEAS?
>> IF THE PRESIDENT GOES TO

1095
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
CHUCK SCHUMER AND SAID CHUCK, WE

1096
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
HAVE TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON

1097
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
CORPORATE TAX REFORM BEFORE WE

1098
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
DO INDIVIDUAL TAX REFORM.

1099
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
JUST MAYBE WE CAN BEGIN TO GET

1100
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
SOME MOMENTUM TO GET OTHER

1101
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
ISSUES.

1102
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
>> Harris: CAN ASK YOU, WHY DOES

1103
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
THE PRESIDENT HAVE TO GO TO

1104
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
SENATOR SCHUMER?
WHY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

1105
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

1106
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
YOU SAW WITH THE NOMINATION OF

1107
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
NEIL GORSUCH, YOU SAW THAT

1108
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
DEMOCRATS DO WANT TO PLAY BALL,

1109
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THEY WANTED TO FILIBUSTER.

1110
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
WE BASICALLY GOT TWO SIDES NOT

1111
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
WINNING BUT WE GOT A SUPREME

1112
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
COURT JUSTICE WHICH I THOUGHT

1113
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
EVERYBODY AGREED ON UNTIL CAME
TO POLITICS.

1114
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
THAT MIGHT BE GREAT FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT AWFUL FOR

1115
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
CAPITOL HILL.

1116
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS, WHY

1117
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
CAN'T DEMOCRATS OFFER SOMETHING?

1118
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
DOESN'T MAKE THEM LOOK WEAK?
>> ONE WORD, POLITICS.

1119
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
THE DEMOCRATIC POLITIC PARTY ITS

1120
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
DIVIDED.

1121
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
THE ONLY THING THEY AGREE ON IS
OPPOSING DONALD TRUMP.

1122
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THE

1123
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
STRATEGY AS WE JUST SAW,

1124
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
DEMONSTRATIONS, RESISTANCE,

1125
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
OPPOSITION.

1126
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WHO

1127
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
HASN'T SPOKEN TO SCHUMER IN

1128
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
ABOUT TWO MONTHS HAS TO REACH

1129
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
OUT.

1130
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> Harris: THIS ISN'T A WINNING
STRATEGY FOR DEMOCRATS.

1131
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
YOU HAVE LOST 1000 SEATS BETWEEN

1132
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
HOUSES, PRESIDENCY, CONGRESS,

1133
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU.

1134
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
>> RIGHT.

1135
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
THAT IS THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATS

1136
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
HAVE COME TO THIS.

1137
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
ADVOCACY OF IDEAS.

1138
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
WE SOUGHT WAS SECRETARY CLINTON,

1139
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
WE SOUGHT IN STATE AFTER STATE,

1140
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
DOES NOT WORK.

1141
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FOUND

1142
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
RECENTLY IS THE OPPOSITION

1143
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
STRATEGY.

1144
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD DO, AS

1145
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
YOU ARE SUGGESTING, URGE
BIPARTISANSHIP.

1146
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
FOR THE PARTY BASE, THE

1147
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
LEFT-WING, THIS RESPONSE

1148
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
RESONATES.

1149
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
>> Harris: REMEMBER THE GANG OF

1150
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
EIGHT?
ON THAT WAS CHUCK SCHUMER.

1151
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
THERE IS SOME DONATION DOLLARS
IN THE HISTORY WITH THEIR

1152
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
CURRENT PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS A

1153
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
PRIVATE CITIZEN THAT WENT TO THE

1154
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
GANG OF EIGHT.

1155
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
A FEW DOLLARS, NOT A LOT WENT TO
SENATOR SCHUMER AT THE TIME FOR

1156
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THE CAUSE THEY WERE WORKING ON.

1157
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
THEY HAVE SOME HISTORY TOGETHER.

1158
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
DOES THAT GIVE YOU SOME HOPE

1159
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH SOME

1160
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
SORT OF BIPARTISANSHIP?
>> IT DOES GIVE ME HOPE.

1161
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
SENATOR SCHUMER HAS MOVED AWAY

1162
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
FROM WHERE HE WAS IN DECEMBER
WHICH WAS TO WORK WITH THE

1163
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
PRESIDENT.
>> Harris: WHERE IS HE NOW?

1164
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
>> HE'S IN THE OPPOSITION CAN.

1165
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
RESIST, RESIST, RESIST.

1166
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I THINK OF THE PRESIDENT REACHES

1167
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
OUT WE CAN GET A DEAL
POTENTIALLY ON HEALTHCARE, TAX

1168
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
REFORM, EVEN IMMIGRATION.

1169
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
>> Harris: WOULD YOU BE WILLING

1170
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
TO BROKER THAT?

1171
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'M NOT KIDDING.

1172
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE.

1173
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
>> I WOULD DO ANYTHING I COULD

1174
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
TO GET THAT DONE FOR THE

1175
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1176
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
>> Harris: I WISCONSIN MAN WHO

1177
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
PLEASE CONSIDER NATIONAL THREAT

1178
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
IS AT LARGE AT THIS HOUR.

1179
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
THE DETAILS ON THE HUNT FOR THIS

1180
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
PERSON INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE HAS

1181
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
A BEEF FOR POLITICIANS.

1182
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
So she makes her pie crust
from scratch.

1183
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And sprinkles on brown sugar
streusel.

1184
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So that you can spend more time

1185
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
making special moments with
your family.

1186
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Marie Callender's
It's time to savor

1187
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
What twisted ankle?ask

1188
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What muscle strain?

1189
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Advil makes pain a distant
memory

1190
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Nothing works faster

1191
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Stronger

1192
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Or Longer

1193
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
What

1194
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Pain?

1195
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Advil.

1196
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I love how USAA gives me
the and the security

1197
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
just like the Marines did.

1198
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
At one point, I did change

1199
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
to a different company

1200
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
with car insurance,

1201
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
and I was not happy with the
customer service.

1202
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We have switched back over

1203
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
and we feel like
we're back home now.

1204
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
The process through USAA
is so effortless,

1205
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
that you feel like
you're a part of the family.

1206
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I love that I can pass the
membership to my children,

1207
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and that they can be protected.

1208
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
We're the Williams family,

1209
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and we're USAA
members for life.

1210

Call USAA today

1211
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
to talk about
your insurance needs.

It's over.

1284
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I've found a permanent
escape from monotony.

1285

Together, we are
perfectly balanced,

the slopes like I used to.

1294
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I even accept I have a higher
risk of stroke due to AFib,

1295
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
a type of irregular heartbeat

1296
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
not caused by a heart valve
problem.

1297
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
But whatever trail I take,
I go for my best.

1298
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So if there's something better

1299
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
than warfarin,

1300
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I'll go for that too.

1301

ELIQUIS.

1302
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
ELIQUIS reduced the risk of
stroke better than warfarin,

1303
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
plus had less
major bleeding

1304
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
than warfarin.

1305
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
ELIQUIS had both.

1306
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Don't stop taking ELIQUIS unless
your doctor tells you to,

1307
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
as stopping increases your risk
of having a stroke.

1308
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

1309
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
an artificial heart valve

1310
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
or abnormal bleeding.

1311
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
While taking ELIQUIS,

1312
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
you may bruise more easily...

1313
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
...and it may take longer than
usual for any bleeding to stop.

1314
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Seek immediate medical care for
sudden signs of bleeding,

1315
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
like unusual bruising.

1316
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
ELIQUIS may increase your
bleeding risk

1317
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
if you take certain medicines.

1318
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Tell your doctor about all
planned medical

1319
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
or dental procedures.

1320
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I'm still going
for my best.

1321
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And for ELIQUIS.

1322
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
