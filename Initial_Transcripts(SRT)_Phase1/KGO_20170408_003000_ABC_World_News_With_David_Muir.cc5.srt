18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
>>> ALSO BREAKING TONIGHT, THE

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
DEADLY TERROR ATTACK.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
WE'RE ON THE SCENE IN SWEDEN.

>>> THE NATIONWIDE MANHUNT HERE
AT HOME.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
SCHOOLS SHUT DOWN.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A SUSPECT CONSIDERED "EXTREMELY

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
DANGEROUS."

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
POLICE SAY HE MADE THIS VIDEO

>>> AND THE PICTURES COMING IN

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
NOW.

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
THE FIRES BREAKING OUT ALONG

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
THIS HIGHWAY IN FLORIDA DURING

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
SPRING BREAK.
THOUSANDS OF ACRES ALREADY

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
>>> GOOD EVENING.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HERE ON A VERY BUSY FRIDAY

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
NIGHT.

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
WE'RE GETTING A MUCH CLEARER

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
PICTURE OF WHAT LED TO PRESIDENT

44
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
TRUMP'S ORDER TO TAKE MILITARY

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
LAST NIGHT, THE WORLD SAW THE

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA, MORE

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THAN 50 TOMAHAWK MISSILES FIRED.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
IT CAME JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK ON
FAMILIES, SO MANY CHILDREN AMONG

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
THE VICTIMS.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE PROOF
THE PLANE THAT DROPPED THAT

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
TOXIC GAS WAS A SYRIAN FIGHTER

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
JET THAT TOOK OFF FROM THIS

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
BASE.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
AND NOW, WORD THAT SYRIAN PLANES

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
ARE TAKING OFF FROM THAT

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
AIRFIELD ALL OVER AGAIN.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
HERE'S MARTHA RADDATZ, LEADING
US OFF.

60

>> Reporter: UNDER THE COVER OF
DARKNESS, DOZENS OF U.S.

TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILES FIRED

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
INTO SYRIA FROM TWO NAVY

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WARSHIPS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
RAINING DOWN ON THE SHAYRAT

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AIRBASE, WHERE THE SYRIAN PLANE

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
CARRYING THOSE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
HAD TAKEN OFF.

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THE CRUISE MISSILES ALREADY

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
LAUNCHED AS THE PRESIDENT WAS

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
WRAPPING UP HIS FIRST DINNER

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT AT

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
MAR-A-LAGO.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
HOURS EARLIER, ABOARD AIR FORCE
ONE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SIGNALED TO THE WORLD THAT

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA
WAS A STRONG POSSIBILITY.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
>> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
AND HE'S THERE, AND I GUESS HE'S
RUNNING THINGS.

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
SO SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
>> Reporter: SOON AFTER LANDING

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
IN FLORIDA, THE PRESIDENT WOULD

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
GIVE HIS COMMANDERS THE GREEN

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
LIGHT.
THE PENTAGON USING MILITARY

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
CHANNELS TO LET THE RUSSIANS

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
KNOW, THIS WAS NOT AN ATTACK ON

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THEIR TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT IN

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
SYRIA.

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SYRIAN TELEVISION SHOWING WHAT

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
IT SAID WAS THE U.S. ASSAULT IN

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THE DISTANCE.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
SYRIAN OFFICIALS CLAIMING AT

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
LEAST SEVEN WERE KILLED.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THE PENTAGON SAYS IT STRUCK ALL

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
59 OF ITS TARGETS.
DESTROYING AT LEAST 20 SYRIAN

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AIRCRAFT, AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS,

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
RADAR AND AMMUNITION SUPPLY
BUNKERS.

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ONCE THOSE MISSILES FELL, THE
PRESIDENT HUDDLED WITH HIS

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM TO ASSESS

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THE DAMAGE.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THE RETALIATION COMING JUST 60
HOURS AFTER THE WORLD SAW THE

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
FIRST HORRIFIC IMAGES OF THAT

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
CHEMICAL ATTACK, IMAGES THAT

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
PUSHED THE PRESIDENT TO ACT.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> TONIGHT, I ORDERED A TARGETED

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
MILITARY STRIKE ON THE AIRFIELD

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
IN SYRIA FROM WHERE THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
>> Reporter: THE PENTAGON

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
PROVIDING EVIDENCE IT SAYS SHOWS

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ASSAD WAS BEHIND THE WAR CRIME.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE FLIGHT PATH DATA OF THE

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SYRIAN WARPLANE.

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AND TONIGHT, THE U.S. MILITARY

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
LOOKING INTO WHETHER THE

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
RUSSIANS KNEW ABOUT THAT

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
CHEMICAL ATTACK OR ASSISTED IN
ANY WAY.

115
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
TODAY AT THE UNITED NATIONS,
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY WARNED

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT THE U.S. COULD STRIKE
AGAIN.

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>> THE UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
>> SO LET'S BRING IN MARTHA,

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
LIVE IN WASHINGTON.

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
WE'RE LEARNING TONIGHT AS WE
COME ON THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
SUSPENDED THE HOTLINE THAT HAD

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
BEEN SET UP BETWEEN THE RUSSIANS

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
AND THE PENTAGON INVOLVING

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
AIRCRAFT OVER SYRIA?

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
>> Reporter: THE HOTLINE WAS SET

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
UP TO DECONFLICT THE AIRCRAFT

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
FLYING MISSIONS OVER SYRIA, SO

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
DON'T RUN INTO EACH OTHER.

132
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BUT THERE ARE RADARS AND OTHER

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
BACKUPS.
SO THERE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
CONCERN.

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
BUT ANOTHER SIGN, THE RUSSIANS

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE AMERICAN

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
ATTACKS ON SYRIA.
>> MARTHA, THANK YOU.

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>>> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THIS

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WAS A CAREFULLY TARGETED STRIKE,

140
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AIMED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I WANT TO BRING IN RETIRED

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
COLONEL STEPHEN GANYARD, WHO HAS
FLOWN OVER THAT REGION.

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
59 TOMAHAWK MISSILES WERE
LAUNCHED FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN,

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
AND GUIDED BY ADVANCED

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
NAVIGATION SYSTEMS TO AVOID
DETECTION?

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THE MISSILES DROP DOWN LOW.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THEY FLEW OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
SEA FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 30

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
MINUTES AND AN HOUR.
AND PROBABLY CAME ASHORE OVER

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
LEBANON TO AVOID SOME OF THE

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SURFACE TO AIR MISSILE SYSTEMS

152
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THE RUSSIANS HAVE IN THE

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
NORTHWEST OF THE COUNTRY.
AND WENT NORTH, WENT AFTER 59

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
CAREFULLY PICKED TARGETS AROUND

155
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THE AIRFIELD.
>> JUST 30 TO 40 MINUTES,

156
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
INCREDIBLE SPEED.
AND TAKE US DEEPER INTO THE

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
MILITARY CHOICE THEY MADE HERE.
WE KNOW PRESIDENT OBAMA

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
CONSIDERED MILITARY ACTION AFTER
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN 2013.

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
PARTS OF THAT PLAN WERE FAR MORE

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
INVOLVED THAN WHAT WE SAW

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
OVERNIGHT.

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
>> THE PENTAGON OFFERED

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SEVERAL CHOICES.

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HE COULD GO WITH A LARGE STRIKE

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WITH A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN, OR

166
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SOMETHING VERY FOCUSED THAT

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WOULD SEND A MESSAGE.
HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT OVERTHROW

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ASSAD, BUT WAS MAKING A VERY

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
CLEAR STATEMENT, SAYING YOU NEED

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
TO STOP GASSING YOUR PEOPLE, OR

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WE'LL BE BACK IN A BIG WAY.

172
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
>> COLONEL GANYARD, THANK YOU.

173
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
>>> AND THIS EVENING, WE'RE ALSO

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
LEARNING WHO WAS IN THE WAR ROOM

175
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
AS THIS UNFOLDED.

176
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HOSTING

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
CHINA'S PRESIDENT.

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
AND WE HAVE LEARNED THE MOMENT

179
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
HE TOLD PRESIDENT XI WHAT WAS

180
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HAPPENING.
JONATHAN KARL HAS THE STORY.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
>> Reporter: THAT IMAGE OF THE

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000

STRIKES.

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A PORTRAIT OF A NEW COMMANDER IN

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
CHIEF AND HIS NATIONAL SECURITY

187
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
TEAM.

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AT THE TABLE, HIS SON-IN-LAW

189
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
JARED KUSHNER.

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
ALSO PRESENT, BUT TAKING A BACK

191
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
SEAT, RECENTLY DEMOTED CHIEF

THE PHOTO EDITED.

194
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THE PAPERS MADE BLANK, TO

195
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PROTECT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

196
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
IT'S A REMARKABLE TURN FOR A MAN
WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY URGED AN

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AMERICA FIRST APPROACH TO WAR

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AND PEACE.

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
SYRIA, HE ONCE SAID, IS NOT

200
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
AMERICA'S PROBLEM.

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BUT THIS WEEK, THE PRESIDENT SAW
THOSE IMAGES.

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THE HORRORS OF CHILDREN HIT WITH

203
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
DEADLY NERVE GAS.

204
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK

205
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY HAD A BIG

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
IMPACT ON ME.

207
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BIG IMPACT.

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
>> Reporter: IN TAKING THIS

209
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
ACTION, TRUMP SEEMED MORE LIKE

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HILLARY CLINTON, WHO HAD URGED
PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ACT IN SYRIA.

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
AND JUST HOURS BEFORE TRUMP

212
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
ORDERED THE AIR STRIKES, MRS.

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CLINTON BASICALLY ENDORSED THE

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
MOVE AGAINST BASHAR AL ASSAD.

215
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE

216
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SHOULD HAVE AND STILL SHOULD

217
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
TAKE OUT HIS AIRFIELDS AND

218
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
PREVENT HIM FROM BEING ABLE TO

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
USE THEM TO BOMB INNOCENT PEOPLE

220
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
AND DROP SARIN GAS ON THEM.

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
SO --

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> Reporter: THE AIR STRIKE

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
COMES AMID NEW PROVOCATIONS FROM

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
NORTH KOREA, AND ON THE SAME DAY

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
TRUMP WAS MEETING WITH CHINA'S

226
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AT THE END OF THEIR FORMAL

228
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
DINNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP INFORMED

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
PRESIDENT XI ABOUT HIS MILITARY
ATTACK.

230
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
NOT LONG AGO, TRUMP CALLED CHINA

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A JOB-KILLING ENEMY OF AMERICA.

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
TODAY, THAT TALK WAS GONE.

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
REPLACED BY SOMETHING CLOSER TO
FRIENDSHIP.

234
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
>> THE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPED BY

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
PRESIDENT XI AND MYSELF I THINK

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
IS OUTSTANDING.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
TOGETHER MANY TIMES IN THE

238
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
FUTURE.

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000

CANDIDATE TRUMP OFTEN TALKED OF

243
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
TO VISIT MOSCOW YET.

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
AND THE BIG TEST OVER WHETHER
THIS DISAGREEMENT WILL END HOPES

258
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
OF A WARMER RELATIONSHIP WITH

259
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000

What about the
people I care about?

546
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
...including this little girl.

547
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And what if this
happened again?

548
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I was given warfarin
in the hospital,

549
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but wondered, was this the
best treatment for me?

550
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I asked my doctor.

551
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And he recommended ELIQUIS.

552
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and reduces the risk of
them happening again.

554
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots.

555
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
ELIQUIS also had

556
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
significantly
less major
bleeding

557
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
than the
standard
treatment.

558
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Both made me
turn around my
thinking.

559
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't stop ELIQUIS
unless your doctor tells you to.

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

561
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
an artificial heart valve

562
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
or abnormal bleeding.

563
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you had a spinal injection
while on ELIQUIS

564
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
call your doctor right away

565
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
if you have tingling,
numbness, or muscle weakness.

566
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
While taking ELIQUIS,
you may bruise more easily

567
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
...and it may take longer
than usual for bleeding to stop.

568
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Seek immediate medical care
for sudden signs of bleeding,

569
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
like unusual bruising.

570
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
ELIQUIS may increase
your bleeding risk

571
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
if you take
certain medicines.

572
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Tell your doctor
about all planned

573
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
medical or dental
procedures.

574
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
ELIQUIS treats
DVT and PE
blood clots.

575
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Plus had
less major
bleeding.

576
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Both made ELIQUIS
the right treatment for me.

577
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Ask your doctor if switching
to ELIQUIS is right for you.

578
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
gave us the power to turn this

579
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
enemy into an ally?

580
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Microsoft and its partners are

581
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
using smart traps to capture

582
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
mosquitoes and sequence their

583
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
DNA to fight disease.

584
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
There are over 100 million

585
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
With the Microsoft Cloud,

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
we can analyze the data

588
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
faster than ever before.

589
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If we can detect new viruses

590
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
before they spread,

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
we may someday prevent outbreaks

592
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000

CIALIS FOR DAILY USE TREATS ED
AND THE URINARY SYMPTOMS OF BPH.

646
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT YOUR MEDICINES,

647
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

648
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

649
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
OR ADEMPAS® FOR
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,

650

STOP TAKING CIALIS

656
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

657
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000

Enough!

676
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I've tried enough laxatives

677
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
to cover
the Eastern Seaboard.

678
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I've climbed a Mount Everest

Probiotics?
Enough!

680
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
(AVO)
If you've had enough,
tell your doctor

681
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
what you've tried
and how long you've been at it.

682
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
LINZESS works differently

683
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
from laxatives.

684
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
LINZESS treats adults

685
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
with IBS with Constipation

686
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
or Chronic Constipation.

687
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It can help
relieve your belly pain,

688
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and lets you have more frequent
and complete bowel movements

689
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
that are easier to pass.

690
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Do not give LINZESS
to children under six,

691
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and it should not be given
to children

692
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
six to less than eighteen.
It may harm them.

693
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Don't take LINZESS if you have
a bowel blockage.

694
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Get immediate help
if you develop unusual

695
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
or severe stomach pain,

696
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
especially with bloody
or black stools.

697
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The most common side effect
is diarrhea, sometimes severe.

698
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
If it's severe
stop taking LINZESS

699
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
and call your doctor right away.

700
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Other side effects include gas,

701
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
stomach-area pain
and swelling.

702
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Talk to your doctor about

703
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
managing your symptoms

704
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000

AMPUTEES.

728
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THEY WERE UP AND THEY WERE

729
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
WALKING AND THEY WERE OUT OF

730
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THEIR WHEELCHAIRS.

731
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000

732
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
WAS DETERMINED TO GET OUT OF
THAT CHAIR HERSELF.

741
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
