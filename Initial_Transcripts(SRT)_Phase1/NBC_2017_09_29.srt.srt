 rheumatologist move to another

         right for you.         

263
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,659
   XELJANZ is a small pill for  
           adults with          

264
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:31,262
 moderate to severe RA for whom 
 methotrexate did not work well.

265
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,998
  XELJANZ can reduce joint pain 
  and swelling in as little as

267
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,304
 XELJANZ can lower your ability 
      to fight infections,      

268
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,005
     including tuberculosis.    

269

    Serious, sometimes fatal

276
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,521
 start and while taking XELJANZ,
and monitor certain liver tests.

 Tell your doctor if you were in
      a region where fungal     

278
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,525

 XELJANZ can reduce the symptoms

281
