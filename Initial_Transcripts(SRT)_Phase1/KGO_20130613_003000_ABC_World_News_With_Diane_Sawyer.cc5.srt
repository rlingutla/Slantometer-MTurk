207
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SNOWDEN MAY BE HOLDING A LOT

208
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
MORE SECRETS.

209
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HIS LAST POST WAS AT THE NSA,

WHO ARE TARGETS IT COULD BE FAR

218
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
MORE DEVASTATING THAN WHAT HE

219
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
HAS DONE SO FAR.

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
IF THAT COMES OUT THEN THERE

223
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WILL BE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO

224
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000

DISTRACTION.

344
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

345
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
IT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

346
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000

443
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
WHEN WE MADE OUR COMMITMENT TO
THE GULF, BP HAD TWO BIG GOALS:

444
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
HELP THE GULF RECOVER, AND
LEARN FROM WHAT HAPPENED

445
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
SO WE COULD BE A BETTER,
SAFER ENERGY COMPANY.

446
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'VE BEEN WITH BP FOR 24 YEARS.

447

I WAS PART OF THE TEAM
THAT HELPED DELIVER

448

ON OUR COMMITMENTS TO THE GULF -

449
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
AND I CAN TELL YOU, SAFETY IS AT
THE HEART OF EVERYTHING WE DO.

450
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
WE'VE ADDED CUTTING-EDGE SAFETY
EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY,

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
SO WE CAN ALL PRODUCE
ENERGY MORE SAFELY.

456
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
SAFETY IS A VITAL PART OF
BP'S COMMITMENT TO AMERICA -

I needed more support.
