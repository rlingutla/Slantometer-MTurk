218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THEY WILL UTILIZE THAT EXPERTISE

219
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
TO UNDERTAKE AN ATTACK IN THE
HOMELAND.

220
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000

279
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
REAL AND NOT A DEFENSE TACTIC.

280
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY,

281
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000

287
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
MANNING WANTS TO BE CALLED "SHE"

288
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
AND BEGIN THE TRANSFORMATION

289
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
