1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
DEPLOYED SPIKE STRIPS TO SLOW IT

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
DOWN.
COPS CATCHING UP WITH AND

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
ARRESTING THE SUSPECT.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
THE DRIVER WAS SUSPECTED TO BE

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
HERE'S BILL HEMMER FOR SHEP.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
>> IT'S 3:00 P.M. ON THE EAST

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
COAST.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
SUSAN RICE IS TALKING AFTER SHE

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
REQUESTED NAMES OF TRUMP

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
UP IN

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
SURVEILLANCE.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
RICE SAID SHE HAD TO ASK FOR

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
CERTAIN NAMES TO DO HER JOB.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS TO DRAW

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ATTENTION OF THE REAL ISSUE

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
ABOUT LINKS BETWEEN THE TRUMP

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
ADMINISTRATION AND MOSCOW.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THE FACTS AHEAD IN A MOMENTS.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
IT'S TIME FOR A SHOW DOWN OVER

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
DEMOCRATS HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
BLOCK NEIL GORSUCH.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
WILL REPUBLICANS FOLLOW-THROUGH

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
ON THE NUCLEAR OPTION?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
AND ALSO REPUBLICANS TRYING TO

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
REPEAL OBAMACARE.
THAT IDEA WENT DOWN IN FLAMES

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
TWO WEEKS AGO.
NOW A NEW PLAN IS RISING FROM

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
THE ASHES OF THE SWAMP.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
IN MINUTES YOU'LL HEAR FROM A

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
CONSERVATIVE GROUP WHOSE SUPPORT

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
MIGHT MAKE OR BREAK THE PLAN.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
THAT'S AHEAD IN A VERY BUSY 3:00

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
HOUR STARTING NOW.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'M BILL HEMMER.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
GOOD DAY.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
IN FOR SHEPARD SMITH, WE BEGIN

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
WITH THE SHOW DOWN OVER

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SURVEILLANCE IN THE NATION'S

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
CAPITOL.
SUSAN RICE IS CALLING

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
ACCUSATIONS SHE MISHANDLED

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION AND

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
TARGETED MEMBERS OF TRUMP TEAM

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
FALSE.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
RICE RESPONDING AFTER FOX NEWS

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
AND OTHER NEWS OUTLETS SAID WHO

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
IS THE ONE THAT ASKED OFFICIALS

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
FOR THE NAMES OF TRUMP

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
ASSOCIATES CAUGHT UP IN

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
SURVEILLANCE.
THAT MEANS REVEALING THE NAMES

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
IN INTELLIGENCE REPORTS NOT TO

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THE PUBLIC.
HERE'S SUSAN RICE.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
>> THERE WERE OCCASIONS WHEN I

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
WOULD RECEIVE A REPORT IN WHICH

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A U.S. PERSON WAS REFERRED TO.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
NAME NOT PROVIDED.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
JUST U.S. PERSON.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REPORT AND

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ACCESS ITS SIGNIFICANCE, IT WAS

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
NECESSARY TO FIND OUT AS TO WHO

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
THE U.S. OFFICIAL WAS.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
>> MORE IN THAT INTERVIEW IN

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
JUST A MOMENT.
RICE SAYING SHE AND OTHER

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
OFFICIALS WOULD REQUEST THE

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
INFORMATION ONLY TO PROTECT THE

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
SHE SAID SHE NEVER DID IT FOR

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
POLITICAL PURPOSES AND SHE NEVER

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
LEAKED ANY INFORMATION TO

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
ANYBODY, HER WORDS EARLIER

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
TODAY.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ALL THIS COMING AFTER HOUSE

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN DEVIN

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
NUNES TOLD REPORTERS THAT TRUMP

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
TRANSITION OFFICIALS AND EVEN

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF MAY HAVE

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
GOTTEN SWEPT UP IN SURVEILLANCE

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OF FOREIGNERS.

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED TWO WHITE

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
HOUSE OFFICIALS HELPED GET NUNES

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THE INFORMATION WHICH HE SHARED

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
WITH THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THE

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
REST OF HIS OWN COMMITTEE.

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CATHERINE HERRIDGE SPEAKING WITH

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
CHAIRMAN NUNES EARLIER TODAY.

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
SHE'LL HAVE MORE ON THOSE

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
DEVELOPMENTS LATER THIS HOUR.

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
AFTER MEETING WITH NUNES,

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE FELT

91
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
SOMEWHAT VINDICATED AFTER HE'S

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS THAT

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TAPPED TRUMP

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
TOWER.
EVEN THOUGH NUNES SAID MANY

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
TIMES THAT DID NOT HAPPEN, NUNES

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
MET WITH THE PRESIDENT, SUSAN

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
RICE TELLING PBS SHE HAD NO IDEA

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WHAT THE CHAIRMAN WAS TALKING

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ABOUT.
>> I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE REPORTS

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
FROM CHAIRMAN NUNES ON THAT

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
COUNT TODAY.

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I REALLY DON'T KNOW TO WHAT

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
CHAIRMAN NUNES WAS REFERRING.

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
BUT HE SAID THAT WHATEVER HE WAS

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
REFERRING TO WAS ILLEGAL LAWFUL

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
SURVEILLANCE AND IT WAS

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
POTENTIALLY INCIDENTAL

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
COLLECTION ON ACITIZENS.

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> SO THAT INTERVIEW FROM 13

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
DAYS AGO IS NOW GETTING A SECOND

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
LOOK TODAY.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TODAY SUSAN RICE SAYS SHE DOES

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
NOT KNOW WHAT INFORMATION NUNES

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
RECEIVED AND SHE WOULD NOT GET

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
IN SPECIFICS ON ANY REPORTING.

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I SPOKE WITH SOUTH CAROLINA

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAMMARLIER

119
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
TODAY ON AMERICA'S NEWSROOM.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
HE SAID THAT HE WANTS LAWMAKERS

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
TO LOOK INTO RICE AND THE ENTIRE

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
BUSINESS OF UNMASKING.

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> AND TERMS OF POLITICAL

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
MANIPULATION OF NATIONAL

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SECURITY INFORMATION, SUSAN RICE

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
IN MY VIEW HAS DONE IT IN THE

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PAST.

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
WHETHER OR NOT SHE DID IT THIS

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
TIME, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S SOMETHING CONGRESS SHOULD

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
LOOK INTO.

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IF SHE WAS INVOLVED IN UNMASKING

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TRUMP TRANSITION FIGURES, WHAT

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WAS THE REASON AND WAS THERE A

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
POLITICAL MOTIVE.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT.

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

136
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
>> YOU HEARD THAT SENATOR GRAHAM

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
SAID THAT RICE HAS MANIPULATED

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
SECURITY INFORMATION IN THE

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
PAST.

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
AFTER THE ATTACK IN BENGHAZI,

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SHE WENT ON THE SUNDAY TALK

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
SHOWS AND SAID BASED ON THE

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
INTELLIGENCE AT THAT TIME, IT

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
LOOKED LIKE A SPONTANEOUS

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
RESPONSE TO PROTESTS OVER AN

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ANTI MUSLIM VIDEO AND NOT A

147
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
TERROR ATTACK.

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW HAS REFERRED

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
TO THE UNMASKING AS THE REAL

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
STORY ON RUSSIA.

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
DEMOCRATS SAY IT'S A DISTRACTION

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
FROM THE BIGGER ISSUE THEY ARGUE

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
TEAM TRUMP AND POTENTIAL

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN

156
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
GOVERNMENT.
YOU GOT THAT?

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
IT'S A MOUTHFUL.

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
JOHN ROBERTS ON FOX'S TOP STORY

159
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
GOOD DAY TO YOU.

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
SO WHAT ELSE DID SUSAN RICE SAID

162
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED UNMASKING?

163
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> BILL, WHEN IS IT NOT A

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
MOUTHFUL TO DIGEST EVERYTHING

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT HAPPENED HERE DAILY?

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
INTERESTING TO LOOK AS YOU POINT

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
OUT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
SHE SAID TODAY COMPARED TO THE

169
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
PBS INTERVIEW ON MARCH 22 WHEN

170
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THERE WAS AN UTTER DENIAL OF

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
ANYTHING THAT DEVIN NUNES WAS

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
TALKING ABOUT.

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
TODAY NO DENIAL THAT SHE'S THE

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
PERSON THAT ASKED FOR THE NAMES

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
TO BE UNMASKED IN INTELLIGENCE

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
REPORTS BUT THAT FIRM DENIAL

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THAT ANY OF THIS WAS DONE FOR

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
POLITICAL PURPOSES OR SHE LEAKED

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
ANY ONE'S NAME.

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
LISTEN HERE.

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
>> IT'S IN THAT PROCESS AND

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRUMP

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
CAMPAIGN, THE TRUMP TRANSITION,

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
DID YOU SEEK THE NAMES OF PEOPLE

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
INVOLVED IN -- DID YOU UNMASK

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THE TRUMP TRANSITION, THE TRUMP

188
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
PRESIDENT-ELECT IN ORDER TO SPY

190
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ON THEM?

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
>> ABSOLUTELY -- ABSOLUTELY NOT

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
FOR ANY POLITICAL PURPOSES, TO

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
SPY, EXPOSE, ANYTHING.

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> SO THE WHITE HOUSE SUGGESTING

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THAT MOST OF THE MEDIA IS NOT

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
GIVING THIS THE SENSE OF

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
IMPORTANCE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THINKS IT SHOULD HAVE.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
WE KNOW THAT SHE IS THE ONE,

200
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SUSAN RICE, THAT ASKED FOR SOME

201
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
NAMES TO BE UNMASKED.

202
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHO LEAKED

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THE NAME OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
MICHAEL FLYNN, AN ACT THAT MAY

205
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS CRIME.

206
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
>> IN RUSSIA, A REPORT OF A BACK

207
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
CHANNEL.

208
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN VLADIMIR

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
PUTIN AND A DONALD TRUMP DONOR.

210
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WHAT IS THE TRUTH ON THAT?

211
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
>> IT'S HARD TO DISCERN.

212
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PERSON

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
INVOLVED DENIED ANY KIND OF

214
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
MEETING TO CREATE A CHANNEL

215
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BETWEEN THE TRUMP TRANSITION AND

216
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THE PERSON AT THE CENTER OF THIS

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
IS ERIC PRINCE, THE FOUNDER OF

219
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BLACK WATER SECURITY

220
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
ORGANIZATION.
A BIG CHECKERED PAST PUTTING

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
CONTRACTORS IN IRAQ.

222
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
HE'S THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF BETSY

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
DeVOS.
WE'RE TOLD BY SOURCES THAT ON

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
JANUARY 11th ERIC PRINCE MET

225
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WITH A RUSSIAN ENVOY AT THE FOUR

226
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SEASONS HOTEL.

227
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
MEETING SAID TO PE THAT THE

229
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES WANTED TO

230
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
CONVINCE PUTIN TO DIAL BACK ON

231
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
HIS SUPPORT FOR IRAN AND SYRIA.

232
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AGAIN, THE WHITE HOUSE AND

233
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
PRINCE DENYING ALL OF THIS.

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
IT PRESENTS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM.

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
SUSAN RICE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION COULD

238
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SAY WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT,

239
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WHICH IS WHY WE ASKED FOR THE

240
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
UNMASKING.
SEAN SPICER DISMISSING ALL OF

241
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
THIS AS FLIMSY REPORTING SAYING

242
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I GUESS SOMEONE MAY HAVE VISITED

243
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
AN ISLAND BUT THERE'S NO PROOF

244
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THAT THEY MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL

245
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
OR THAT THEY HAD ANY TIES OR THE

246
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
DATE OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE

247
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
MEETING.

248
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I THINK THAT IT'S FLIMSY AT

249
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
BEST.

250
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> A PRO RUSSIAN CONGRESSMAN SET

251
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

252
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
TODAY.

253
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
WHO IS THAT AND WHAT IS THE

254
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
MEETING ABOUT?
>> DANA RORBACHER WILL BE HERE.

255
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
HE'S AN ADVOCATE OF IMPROVING

256
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THE RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND

257
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THE UNITED STATES.

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
DANA RORBACHER SAID IT'S A

259
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
BROUHAHA OVER NOTHING.

260
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
HE SAID "WHAT IS HAPPENING IS

261
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
YOU HAVE THE FAKE NEWS AVALANCHE

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
TRYING TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION

263
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THAT SOMETHING SINISTER IS

264
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HAPPENING WITH RUSSIA AND THAT

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
IS PREVENTING US FROM

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
NEGOTIATING AND GETTING INTO A

267
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
REAL RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN

268
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
DO SOME GOOD BY WORKING TOGETHER

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
WITH RUSSIA."

270
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE WOULD

271
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
LIKE TO WORK WITH RUSSIA ON

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
DEFEATING ISIS.

273
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA WITH

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
AL-ASSAD COULD COMPLICATE

275
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THINGS.
>> THANKS, JOHN.

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WANT TO LOOK AT THIS NOW FROM

277
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
BOTH SIDES.
A FORMER DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS AN

278
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
EXECUTIVE RESIDENT AT THE

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PUBLIC

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
AFFAIRS.
NED RYAN, FOUNDER AND CEO OF

281
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
AMERICAN MAJORITY, A POLITICAL

282
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
TRAINING INSTITUTE AND FORMER

283
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WRITER FOR GEORGE BUSH.

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
GOOD DAY TO BOTH OF YOU.

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
ST. THE STORY CHANGING WITH

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
REGARD TO SUSAN RICE GIVEN THAT

287
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
INTERVIEW ON MSNBC?

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> YOU'LL HAVE TO PARDON ME OF

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
BEING SKEPTICAL OF SOMEONE THAT

290
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
LIED ABOUT THE BENGHAZI VIDEO

291
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND A FEW WEEKS AGO CLAIMED NO

292
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT CONGRESSMAN

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
NUNES IS TALKING ABOUT AND NOW

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
LO AND BEHOLD, SHE'S CLAIMING

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
SHE KNOWS NOTHING.

296
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'M SKEPTICAL OF HOW HONEST

297
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
SUSAN RICE IS BEING.

298
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
FIGURE OUT.

300
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
THIS APPEARS TO BE COORDINATED,

301
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SYSTEMATIC.
THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING TO

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
ME, BILL, BASED OFF OF SOME OF

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THESE RECORDS, ACCORDING TO FISA

304
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
COURT RULE AND NSA POLICIES, ANY

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
INCIDENTAL COMMUNICATIONS

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
COLLECTED THAT ARE NOT SPECIFIC

307
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
TO THE INVESTIGATION ARE TO BE

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
DISCARDED.

309
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BASED OFF THE REPORTS THAT WE'RE

310
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
HEARING, NOT ONLY ARE THE

311
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
INCIDENTAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT

312
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA,

313
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT DISCARDED,

314
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
NAMES WERE UNMASKED AND PUT IN

315
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THE REPORTS AND WIDELY

316
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DISSEMINATED.

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THAT'S A PROBLEM.
I HOPE AT THE END OF DAY AND

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WE'RE GOING TO -- I FEEL LIKE

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
WE'RE PEELING BACK AN ONION

320
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
EVERY DAY.

321
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THERE'S --

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
>> YOU'RE NOT FAR FROM OFF ON

323
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
THAT.

324
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THIS

325
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
IS REFERRED SURVEILLANCE.

326
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
QUICKLY.
>> I WOULD ARGUE, THERE'S REAL

327
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
QUESTIONS IS THIS REVERSE

328
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
SURVEILLANCE.

329
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
DID THE PARTY IN POWER WEAPONIZE

330
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE STATE AGAINST THE OPPOSING

331
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
PARTY?
THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS

332
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
AND SERIOUS QUESTIONS BEING

333
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
RAISED.
I WOULD LIKE SUSAN RICE TO GO

334
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
UNDER OATH, GO UP TO THE HILL IN

335
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
FRONT OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

336
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
COMMITTEE AND GIVE ANSWERS.

337
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
>> CAPRI, HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
IS NOW?
>> WHAT A MESS THIS IS FOR THE

339
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
AMERICAN PUBLIC, FOR OUR

340
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
CREDIBILITY.

341
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I THINK CREDIBILITY HERE IS A

342
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
HUGE ISSUE.

343
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
YOU HAVE SUSAN RICE WHO AS THE

344
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
OTHER GUEST JUST MENTIONED HAD

345
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
CREDIBILITY QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF

346
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE HISTORY WITH BENGHAZI.

347
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THEN YOU HAVE THE ISSUE OF DEVIN

348
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
NUNES AND HIS CLOUD OF

349
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING WHETHER

350
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
OR NOT HE WAS POLITICALLY

351
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
MOTIVATED.
YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE COOKING IN

352
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THE KITCHEN THAT DON'T

353
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
NECESSARILY HAVE GREAT

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
CREDIBILITY IN ADDRESSING THIS

355
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ISSUE.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE

356
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE ANSWERS.

357
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THEY DESERVE ANSWERS --

358
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME.

359
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
>> FROM MARCH 22, JUDY WOODRUFF

360
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
ASKED SUSAN RICE ABOUT BEING

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
SWEPT UP IN THE SURVEILLANCE.

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
HER ANSWER IS "I KNOW NOTHING

363
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
ABOUT THIS."

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE

365
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
REPORTS FROM CHAIRMAN NUNES.

366
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
>> I CAN MAKE THAT REQUEST.

367
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

368
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
PROCESSED THAT REQUEST THROUGH

369
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THEIR NORMAL PROCEDURES AND IF

370
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THEY FEEL THEY CAN GIVE THE

371
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
ANSWER, THEY WILL GIVE THE

372
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
ANSWER.
THAT COMES BACK TO ME, NOT TO

373
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
ANYBODY BROADLY IN THE NATIONAL

374
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
SECURITY WORLD.

375
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THAT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO

376
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
MY JOB.

377
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
>> DID YOU SEEK THE NAMES OF

378
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
PEOPLE INVOLVED IN -- TO UNMASK

379
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THE TRUMP TRANSITION, THE TRUMP

381
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE

382
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
PRESIDENT-ELECT IN ORDER TO SPY

383
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ON THEM?

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR ANY

385
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
POLITICAL PURPOSES, TO SPY,

386
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
EXPOSE, ANYTHING.

387
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
>> TWO WEEKS LATER, A COMPLETELY

388
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
DIFFERENT ANSWER.

389
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
ANDREA MITCHELL HAD THE RIGHT

390
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
QUESTION.
DID YOU USE THIS INFORMATION TO

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
SPY.

392
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
>> NO.
THIS IS THE THING.

393
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
IF IT LOOKS LIKE AND APPEARS

394
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THIS WAY THAT TRUMP AND HIS

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
TRANSITION TEAM WERE TARGETED,

396
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

397
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
RUSSIA, THAT THERE WAS A

398
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE GATHERING

399
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
OPERATION AND IT WAS WIDE BY

400
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
DISSEMINATED.

401
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT

402
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

403
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
WE'RE NOT JUST REALIZING IT'S

404
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
SUSAN, HER DEPUTY, BEN RHODES AS

405
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
WELL.
I THINK THERE'S MORE NAMES

406
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
COMING OUT.

407
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
HERE'S THE THING.

408
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
SUSAN RICE DID NOT ACT IN A

409
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
VACUUM.
SHE DID NOT DO THIS OF HER OWN

410
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
VOLITION.
THERE'S OTHERS INVOLVED.

411
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
THE QUESTION IS HOW HIGH --

412
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
>> NONE OF US HERE HAVE SECURITY

413
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
CLEARANCE.

414
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
WE HAVE NO WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND

415
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
CLOSED DOOR.

416
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE

417
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
ANSWERS.
WE NEED ANSWERS BOTH FROM SUSAN

418
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
RICE AND ON THE RUSSIAN

419
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
DEBACLE --
>> TO BOTH OF YOU, THANK YOU.

420
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
A QUICK BREAK HERE.

421
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO REVIVE

422
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
THEIR PLAN TO REPEAL AND REPLACE

423
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OBAMACARE, THEY NEED

424
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
CONSERVATIVE SUPPORT.

425
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
IN A MOMENT, MEET THE LEADER OF

426
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
A GROUP THAT MAY JUST GIVE THAT

427
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
NEXT LIVE HERE.

428
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Fun in art class.

429
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come close, come close.

430
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I like that.

431
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
[ ALL SOUNDS COME TO A
CRASHING HALT ]

432
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Ah.

433
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When your pain reliever
stops working,

434
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
your whole day stops.

435
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Awww.

436
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Try this.

437
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
For minor arthritis pain,

438
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
only Aleve is FDA
approved to work

439
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
for up to 12 straight hours
with just one pill.

440
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you.

441
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Come on everybody.

442
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Aleve.

443
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Live Whole.
Not Part.

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Remember when you said
men are supeYeah...ivers?

445
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, then how'd I get this...

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
...Allstate Safe
Driving Bonus Check?

447
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
...only Allstate sends
you a bonus check

448
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
for every six months
you're accident free.

449
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Silence.

450
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's good to be IN, Good Hands.

451
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
>> Bill: BREAKING NEWS ON WHAT

452
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
MIGHT BE REPUBLICAN HOPES FOR

453
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
REVIVING THE HEALTHCARE PLAN.

454
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THE INITIAL EFFORT TO REPEAL

455
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
OBAMACARE FLOPPED TWO WEEKS AGO.

456
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
NOW ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

457
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
MOVING TO GET IT ANOTHER GO.

458
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
THERE'S A LOT OF MEETINGS DAY

459
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
AND NIGHT.

460
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
MY GUEST MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER

461
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
HELP.

462
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
DAVID McINTOSH JOINS ME LIVE

463
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
FROM WASHINGTON.

464
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
SIR, GOOD DAY TO YOU.

465
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
READY TO BREAK SOME NEWS?

466
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
READY TO GET ON BOARD A NEW PLAN

467
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
TO PASS IT OR NOT?

468
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
>> WELL, BILL, VICE PRESIDENT

469
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
PENCE HAS WORKED HARD THE LAST

470
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
CONSERVATIVES AND MODERATE

471
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
REPUBLICANS TOGETHER.

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
AS YOU KNOW, THE FLAW IN THE

473
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
FIRST EFFORT WAS IT DIDN'T

474
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
REPEAL THE COSTLY REGULATIONS

475
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
THAT OBAMACARE PUT IN PLACE THAT

476
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
HAVE CAUSED INSURANCE PREMIUMS

477
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF.

478
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
WHAT VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SAID

479
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
IS, YOU KNOW, THE MORE MODERATE

480
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
AND LIBERAL STATES WANT TO KEEP

481
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THE REGULATIONS.

482
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
MORE CONSERVATIVES WANT TO GET

483
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
RID OF THEM.

484
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
HOW ABOUT IF WE DID AN APPROACH

485
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
WHERE THE STATES COULD ASK FOR

486
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
WAIVERS, THAT THEY COULD GET RID

487
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
OF THE COSTLY REGULATIONS AND IF

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
A STATE LIKE MY STATE OF INDIANA

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WANTS TO DO THAT AND SAVE OUR

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
CITIZENS A LOT OF MONEY ON THEIR

491
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
HEALTH INSURANCE, THEY CAN DO

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
IT.

493
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
IF A STATE LIKE NEW YORK WANTS

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
TO KEEP THE EXPENSIVE

495
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
REGULATIONS, THEY CAN DO THAT.

496
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> THAT ANSWER TELLS ME YOU'RE

497
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
NOT ON BOARD.

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
YOU'RE STILL NEGOTIATING.

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
>> THE PROBLEM IS, SPEAKER RYAN

500
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
HAS NOT AGREED TO THE DEAL THAT

501
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
VICE PRESIDENT PROVIDENCE PUT
TOGETHER.

502
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
WE'RE READY TO SUPPORT IT, BILL

503
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
IF HE WILL AGREE TO IT.

504
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
>> Bill: ARE YOU ON THE SAME

505
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SIDE AS MIKE PENCE AT THE

506
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
MOMENT?

507
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
>> YES, SIR, I AM.

508
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
HE'S GOOD A GOOD PROPOSAL.

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
>> Bill: LET ME INTERRUPT YOU.

510
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
TRYING TO SQUEEZE AS MUCH AS WE

511
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
CAN IN HERE.

512
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
HOW MANY MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM

513
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
CAUCUS WOULD VOTE WITH YOUR PLAN

514
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A SECOND TIME AROUND?

515
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
>> THEY WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO

516
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
SEE THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE IN THE

517
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BILL.
THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S LUCY AND

518
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
CHARLIE BROWN.

519
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED THINGS

520
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
IN THE PAST AND HE DIDN'T

521
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
DELIVER IT.
I DON'T BLAME THEM.

522
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
SEE THE LANGUAGE, SEE THE BILL.

523
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
IF IT'S IN THERE, THE AGREEMENT

524
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
THAT WE REACHED WITH VICE

525
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
PRESIDENT PENCE IS IN THERE,

526
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THEN IT'S A GOOD PROVISION AND

527
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
THE BILL SHOULD GO FORWARD.

528
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
>> DAVID, VERY IMPORTANT, AS YOU

529
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
KNOW.

530
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
THERE WERE 36 MEMBERS OF THE

531
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
FREEDOM CAUCUS, PERHAPS 35 AT

532
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
LAST CHECK.

533
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF YOU GET

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WHAT YOU WANT, ALL 35 SIGN ON TO

535
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THIS?
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF

536
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
THEM.

537
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THERE WILL BE SOME THAT WON'T.

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM ALL.

539
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
WHAT I DO THINK IS YOU'LL SEE

540
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
ALMOST ALL THE CONSERVATIVES

541
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
AGREE TO IT AND THEN THE

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
MODERATES, WILL THEY HOLD UP

543
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
REPEAL AND REPLACE.

544
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THAT'S THEIR DECISION.

545
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
EARLY ON, THEY SIGNALS TO THE

546
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
VICE PRESIDENT THAT THEY COULD
LIVE WITH THIS COMPROMISE.

547
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS

548
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
WILL SPEAKER RYAN AND THE

549
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
MODERATES TAKE A YES AT THIS

550
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
POINT.

551
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
>> Bill: DO YOU BELIEVE AT THIS

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
POINT THAT THAT THERE HAPPEN?

553
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
>> YES, I DO.

554
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I THINK IN THE END, THEY'RE

555
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
FAITHFUL TO THEIR CAMPAIGN

556
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
PROMISES THAT THEY WANT TO

557
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
REPEAL OBAMACARE.

558
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
THIS IS A COMPROMISED WAY TO DO

559
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
IT AND A GOOD WAY FORWARD.

560
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
>> SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A

561
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
REVIVAL FOR REPEAL AND REPLACE,

562
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
IT SOUNDS AS IF A LOT IS MOVING

563
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
AT THE MOMENT.

564
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
>> A LOT IS MOVING.

565
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
THE KEY IS NOT EVERYBODY IS

566
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
GOING TO GET EVERYTHING THEY

567
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
WANT.
CONSERVATIVES GOT A BIG PART OF

568
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
WHAT THEY WANT NOW.

569
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THE INDIVIDUAL STATES CAN DECIDE

570
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
TO GET RID OF THOSE REGULATIONS.

571
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I HOPE THE MODERATES WILL SAY

572
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
YES, WE PRESERVED IT FOR OUR

573
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
STATE IF WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

574
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
THAT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE.

575
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
>> Bill: FOR THE RECORD, WE

576
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
HEARD THE SAME THING ABOUT THREE

577
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
WEEKS AGO.

578
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
>> YEAH, YOU HAVE TO KEEP

579
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
MOVING.
THINGS CAN FALL APART IN

580
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
WASHINGTON.
THE CLUB FOR GROWTH WAS DEAD SET

581
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
ABOUT THE EARLIER BILL BECAUSE

582
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ON THESE

583
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
REGULATIONS, THIS IS A BIG STEP

584
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
FORWARD TO PROVIDE RELIEF SO

585
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
INSURANCE PREMIUMS CAN COME

586
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
DOWN.
>> Bill: WE'LL SEE IF IT GOES.

587
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
DAVID, THANKS.
PRESIDENT FOR THE CLUB FOR

588
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
GROWTH.
IN A MOMENT HERE, CHILDREN AMONG

589
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
THE DEATH AFTER REPORTS OF A

590
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
CHEMICAL ATTACK INSIDE SYRIA.

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
NOW THE WHITE HOUSE UNDER

592
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
GROWING PRESSURE TO DEAL WITH

593
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
THE RUSSIAN BACK'S DICTATOR,

594
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
AL-ASSAD AFTER THE

595
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY'RE NOT

596
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
FOCUSED ON REMOVING HIM FROM

597
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
POWER.
SO WHAT NOW?
THAT'S NEXT.

598
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Why do we put so much effort

599
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
into engineering the
Can-Am Defender?

600
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Because a job worth doing,

601
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
is worth doing right.

602
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Can-Am Defender.

603
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Tough, Capable, Clever.

604
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Get a 3-year BRP limited

605
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
warranty plus a $1,500 cash

606
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
rebate on 2016 Defender models.

607
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
My lineage was the Vecchios and
Zuccolis. Through Ancestry,

608
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
through DNA I found out that I
was only 16% Italian.

609
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He was 34% Eastern European.

610
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So I went onto Ancestry,

611
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
soon learned that one of our
ancestors we thought was Italian

612
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
was Eastern European.

613
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
This is my ancestor who I
didn't know about.

614
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He looks a little bit
like me, yes.

615
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Ancestry has many paths to
discovering your story.

>> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING

618
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
TODAY'S APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK

619
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
IN SYRIA AGAINST CIVILIANS IS

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
REPREHENSIBLE AND CANNOT BE

621
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
IGNORED.
IT'S CALLING ACTIONS BY BASHAR

622
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
AL-ASSAD HEINOUS AND THAT IS A

623
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
SHIFT FROM WHAT TOP TRUMP

624
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING DAYS AGO.

625
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
ACTIVISTS CLAIM SYRIAN OR

626
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
RUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS DROPPED

627
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A TOWN IN

628
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
NORTHERN SYRIA.

629
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
A HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SAID THE

630
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
ATTACKS KILLED 58 PEOPLE

631
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
INCLUDING 11 CHILDREN.

632
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WE WANT TO WARN YOU, THE IMAGES

633
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
ARE DISTURBING AND YOU MAY WANT

634
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
TO THINK TWICE ABOUT SHARING

635
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WITH YOUR KIDS.

636
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
WE'RE SHOWING THEM THOU BECAUSE

637
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THEY CONVEY THE TRUE HORROR OF

638
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
THIS ATTACK AND THE VICTIMS IT

639
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
INVOLVES.

640
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
HEART-BREAKING PHOTOS POSTED ON

641
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000

SMALL CHILDREN IN DIAPERS AMONG

642
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THE VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL

643
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
ATTACK.

644
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
MEDICS REPORTING THAT ROCKET

645
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
ATTACKS AND CLINICS TREATING THE

646
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
WOUNDED.

647
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TODAY REPORTERS ASKED SEAN

648
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
SPICER IF THE UNITED STATES WILL

649
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
RESPOND.
SPICER IS SAYING OFF CAMERA THAT

650
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
HE WASN'T GOING TO GET AHEAD OF

651
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THE PRESIDENT.

652
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
THIS COMING DAYS AFTER THE U.S.

653
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI

654
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
HALEY SAID THE TRUMP

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T INTERESTED

656
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
IN REMOVING AL-ASSAD FROM POWER

657
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
AND IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE

659
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.

660
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THIS IS THE THIRD CLAIM OF A

661
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN JUST OVER A

662
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
WEEK IN SYRIA.

663
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
LEA GABRIELLE WITH MORE ON THIS

664
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
TODAY.

665
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
LEA?

666
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
>> THERE'S REPORTS OF PEOPLE

667
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, PEOPLE

668
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
UNRESPONSIVE.

669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
YOU CAN SEE EMERGENCY WORKERS

670
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
DRESSED IN HAZMAT SUITS AS THEY

671
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
TAKE CHILDREN INTO THE HOSPITAL

672
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
FOR TREATMENT.

673
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
ONE DOCTOR SAID HE SAW PATIENTS

674
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
WITH PINPOINT PUPILS.

675
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
THESE ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS OF

676
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
TOXIC GAS EXPOSURES.

677
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THEY THINK MORE THAN ONE GAS WAS

678
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
USED INCLUDING SARIN.

679
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
THIS HAPPENED IN AN AIR

680
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
CONTROLLED BY FORCES OPPOSED TO

681
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THE ASSAD REGIME.

682
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
IT'S HOME TO 900,000 DISPLACED

683
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
SYRIANS.

684
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THIS IS THE WORST TOXIC GAS

685
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
ATTACK ON A DAMASCUS SUBJECT

686
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
BOSCH.

687
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
AFTER THAT, PRESIDENT ASSAD

688
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
AGREED TO DESTROY CHEMICAL

689
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
WEAPONS.

690
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
1,300 TONS OF MATERIALS WERE

691
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
DESTROYED.

692
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
MANY COUNTRIES WORRY WHETHER HE

693
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
GAVE UP HIS MATERIALS.

694
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
>> AND SENATOR McCAIN IS

695
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
QUESTIONING WHETHER IT'S TIME TO

696
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
TAKE ACTION AGAINST ASSAD.

697
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
>> TODAY A STATEMENT WAS

698
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
RELEASED SAYING "ASSAD BELIEVES

699
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
HE CAN COMMIT WAR CRIMES WITH

700
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
IMPUNITY.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE WILL

701
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
TAKE ACTION TO DISABUSE HIM OF

702
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
THIS MURDEROUS NOTION."

703
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
HE SAID THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WOULD

704
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
HAVE A DECISION ABOUT ASSAD'S

705
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
FATE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

706
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
AS YOU RECALL LAST WEEK, THE

707
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY

708
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
WEREN'T FOCUSED ON TAKING OUT

709
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
ASSAD ANYMORE.
TAKE A LISTEN.

710
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
>> THERE'S A POLITICAL REALITY

711
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN TERMS

712
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

713
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
WE LOST A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THE

714
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
LAST ADMINISTRATION WITH RESPECT

715
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
TO ASSAD.

716
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
NOW IT'S UP TO THE SYRIAN

717
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
PEOPLE.

718
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE

719
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW DEFEATING

720
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
ISIS.

721
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
>> WELL, TODAY PRESS SECRETARY

722
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
SEAN SPICER TOOK A DIFFERENT

723
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
TONE.

724
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
HE SAID THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A

725
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
LACK OF COMFORT WITH ASSAD.

726
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
VERY DIDN'T TONE THERE.

727
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
>> Bill: WE AWAIT THE NEXT

728
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
CHAPTER.

729
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
TRULY DISTURBING.

730
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THANK YOU.

731
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
IN A MOMENT, MORE ON THE ONGOING

732
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000

WE'LL TALK TO HER IN A MATTER OF

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000

Whoever threw it
has to go get it.

Anyone can dream.

750
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Making it a reality
is the hard part.

751
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
From the B-2 to
the upcoming B-21,

752
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Northrop Grumman
stealth bombers give

753
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
America an advantage
in a turbulent world.

INVESTIGATORS SAY 22-YEAR-OLD

759
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
MAN FROM WAS THE CULPRIT FOR THE

760
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
BOMBING.
AND YESTERDAY THE STATION WAS

761
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
FILLED WITH SMOKE AND PEOPLE

762
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
TRIED TO PRY OPEN DOORS.

764
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
SCENE.

765

PEOPLE KNEELING OF BODIES AND

766
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THEIR HAIR BURNED.

767
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
INVESTIGATORS SAY THE SUSPECT

768
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
PLANTED A BOMB IN ANOTHER SUBWAY

769
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000

THE ENTIRE SUBWAY SYSTEM SHUT

DOWN FOR HOURS.

772
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS VISITING THAT

773
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
TOWN AT THAT TIME, WHICH IS ALSO

774
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HIS HOMETOWN.

775
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
HE COLD IT A POSSIBLE TERROR

776
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
ATTACK.

777

NO WORD ON GROUPS CLAIMING

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
RESPONSIBILITY JUST YET.

779

has the exact
nutrient formula

784
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the National Eye
Institute recommends

785
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
to help reduce

786
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000

moderate to advanced AMD

ADDRESSED THE CONTROVERSY

SURROUNDING THE UNMASKING OF

802

CATHERINE?

807
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
>> THANK YOU.

808
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
THE RICE INTERVIEW ILLUSTRATES

809
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
THE POLITICAL DIVIDE HERE IN

810
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
WASHINGTON.

811
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000

ADMINISTRATION WAS DOING DUE

ADVISOR EMPHASIZING THAT

815
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
UNMASKING IS SEPARATE AND

816
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
DISTINCT FROM MAKING THE NAMES

817
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
PUBLIC.

818
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
>> THE NOTION THAT WHICH SOME

819
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SUGGEST

820
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THAT BY ASKING FOR THE IDENTITY

821
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
OF AN AMERICAN PERSON, THAT IS

822
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
THE SAME AS LEAKING IT IS

823
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
COMPLETELY FALSE.

824
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
THERE'S NO EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN

825
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SO-CALLED UNMASKING AND LEAKING.

826

REGULAR ACCESS TO THE

THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM WERE

833
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000

INCLUDING CARTER PAGE, PAUL

MANAFORT AND ROGER STONE.

850
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
BASED ON OUR REPORTING, THERE'S

851
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WERE

852
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
DEMOCRATS FOR THE INTERVIEWS AND

853
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
COULD BE DONE AS EARLY AS APRIL

854
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
17th.

855
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
LIKELY AFTER THE RECESS.

856
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
>> SO THE FBI DIRECTOR IS BACK

857
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
IN THE CROSS HAIR.

858
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
WHAT GIVES WITH THAT?

859
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
>> JAMES COMEY AND THE NSA

860
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
DIRECTOR ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS

861
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
TESTIFIED AT THE HEARING MARCH

862
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
20th.

863
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
BUT AFTER THESE REPORTS CAME TO

864
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
LIGHT, BOTH MEN WERE RECALLED.

865
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LAST

866
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
WEEK.
THE FBI SAID THAT THEY'RE NOT

867
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
COOPERATIVE ON THE MATTER.

868
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
MEANTIME, A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL

869
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
SAID THE FBI DIRECTOR IN THEIR

870
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
OPINION WAS SO DAMAGED BY HIS

871
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN THE CLINTON

872
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
E-MAIL PROBLEM AND THE RUSSIAN

873
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
ELECTION SCANDAL THAT SHE SHOULD

874
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
CONSIDER RECUSING HIMSELF.

875
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
HE WAS AT THE CENTER OF THE

876
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
MASKING OF MIKE FLYNN AS PART OF

877
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE

878
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
INVESTIGATION.
THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD NOT

879
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SPEAK ON THE RECORD BUT THEY

880
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
CLAIMED WHAT THE DIRECTOR SAID

881
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
IN THE MARCH 20th HEARING DID

882
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
NOT SYNC UP WITH HIS STATEMENTS

883
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
DURING PRIVATE CLASSIFIED

884
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
BRIEFINGS.

885
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
THE DIRECTOR'S VIEW ON THE

886
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
PRESIDENT'S WIRETAPPING TWEETS

887
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
WERE DESCRIBED AS SHOWING A

888
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
COMPLETE LACK OF DISCRETION.

889
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I WOULD EMPHASIZE WE'VE HEARD

890
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
NOTHING IN A SIMILAR VEIN FROM

891
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THE DEMOCRATS THAT ARE ON THESE

892
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
COMMITTEES.
NO A LOT TO FOLLOW, CATHERINE.

893
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THANK YOU.

894
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
ALSO FROM THE HILL, THERE'S MORE

895
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
THIS HOUR.

896
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
SENATORS HAVE STARTED THEIR

897
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
FORMAL DEBATE OVER PRESIDENT

898
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE,

899
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
NEIL GORSUCH.

900
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
A LIVE LOOK AT THE SENATE FLOOR.

901
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
IT'S LOOKING LIKE REPUBLICANS

902
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
MIGHT USE THE NUCLEAR OPTION TO

903
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
GET HIM CONFIRMED AND ON THE

904
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
BENCH.
41 DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SAY THEY

905
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
WILL PLAN TO VOTE NO ON

906
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
CONFIRMING GORSUCH.

907
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
THAT IS ENOUGH TO STOP

908
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
REPUBLICANS FROM GETTING THE 60

909
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
VOTES THEY NEED.

910
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
THE WAY AROUND THAT FOR

911
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
REPUBLICANS IS THE NUCLEAR

912
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
OPTION.
THAT WOULD SET A NEW PRECEDENT

913
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
AND LOWTER MAJORITY TO 51 VOTES.

914
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THAT WAY REPUBLICANS COULD

915
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
CONFIRM GORSUCH WITHOUT A SINGLE

916
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
DEMOCRATIC VOTE.

917
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THE RULE CHANGE WOULD BE FOR

918
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
FUTURE NOMINEES.

919
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT BODY.

920
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
PETER, DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO

921
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
AVOID USING THE NUCLEAR OPTION

922
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
IN WHAT WAY?
>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE SENATE

923
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
MINORITY LEADER, CHUCK SCHUMER,

924
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
HIS PARTY IN THE MINORITY, THAT

925
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
IF THE NUCLEAR OPTION GETS USED

926
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
AGAINST THEM, THEY WILL BE

927
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
FURTHER MARGINALIZED WHILE

928
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
REPUBLICANS ARE IN CHARGE.

929
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
NOW SCHUMER SAYS THAT

930
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SHOULD

931
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
GET TOGETHER IN A ROOM BEHIND

932
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
CLOSED DOORS TO TALK IT OUT AND

933
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID USING

934
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

935
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THAT IS NEW FOR SCHUMER.

936
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BEEN SAYING IF

937
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
GORSUCH WASN'T GOING TO GET 60

938
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
VOTES, PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD

939
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
NOMINATE SOMEONE THAT COULD.

940
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
SCHUMER AND HIS COLLEAGUES,

941
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, ARE LAYING

942
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
OUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING

943
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
THE PRECEDENT CHANGED.

944
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
BLUMENTHAL IS USING BLEAK

945
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
ADJECTIVES.
>> THE REASON THEY CALL IT THE

946
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
NUCLEAR OPTION, THAT IS THAT

947
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THERE'S FALL-OUT.

948
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> THE MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER

949
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
IS SUGGESTING THAT PRESIDENT

950
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE A REALLY

951
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
HARD TIME DOING SOMETHING THAT

952
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
HE SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT DO

953
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SOME DAY, REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS

954
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
FOR SOME LEGISLATING HERE IF THE

955
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
NUCLEAR OPTION IS USED.

956
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
>> WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS TELLING

957
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
YOU ABOUT THE JUSTIFICATION, THE

958
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
CHANGE OF PRECEDENT?

959
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
HOW DID THEY BACK THAT UP AT

960
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THIS LATE STAGE?

961
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
>> THEY'RE JUSTIFYING IT BY

962
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
SAYING THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY

963
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
CAN CONFIRM GORSUCH EVEN THOUGH

964
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THEY KNOW THIS RULE COULD SOME

965
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
DAY BE USED AGAINST THEM.

966
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

967
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HARMFUL.
SOME DAY THE DEMOCRATS WILL BE

968
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
IN THE MAJORITY AND WE WILL LOSE

969
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
THE UNIQUE ASPECT OF THE WAY WE

970
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS.

971
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
IT WILL RESULT IN SUPREME COURT

972
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
NOMINEES THAT ARE MUCH MORE

973
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
RADICAL IN EITHER DIRECTION.

974
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
>> THE SECOND HIGHEST RANKING

975
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SENATOR, ORRIN HATCH FROM UTAH

976
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
SAYS IT COULD BE THE NEXT

977
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
CONFIRMATION FIGHT THAT WOULD BE

978
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
LIKE ARMAGEDDON.

979
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
THAT MIGHT BE THE ONE WHERE

980
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD HAVE THE

981
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE ONE OF

982
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
THE COURT'S LIBERAL JUSTICES

983
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
WITH A CONSERVATIVE.

984
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
>> MAYBE SENATOR SCHUMER IS

985
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
COOKING UP A DEAL.

986
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
COULD BE THE ART OF HIS OWN

987
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
DEAL.

988
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
PETER DOOCY LIVE.

989
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
MORE ON THE SHOWDOWN IN THE

990
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
SENATE A AND THE POSSIBLE

991
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
CONSEQUENCES OF USING THE

992
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
NUCLEAR OPTION.
THAT IS NEXT AS WE CONTINUE.

993
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Hey, ready for the big meeting?

994
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah.

995
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Uh, hello!?

996
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
A meeting?

997
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's a big one.

998
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Too bad.
We are double booked:

999
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
diarrhea and
abdominal pain.

1000
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Why don't you start
without me?

1001
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh. Yeah.

1002
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If you're living with frequent,

1003
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
unpredictable diarrhea
and abdominal pain,

1004
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you may have...

1005
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
...Irritable Bowel Syndrome
with Diarrhea,

1006
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
or IBS-D.

1007
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
A condition that can
be really frustrating.

1008
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Talk to your doctor
about VIBERZI,

1009
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
a different way to treat IBS-D.

1010
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
VIBERZI is a
prescription medication

1011
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
you take every day

1012
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
that helps proactively manage

1013
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
both diarrhea and abdominal pain

1014
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
at the same time.

1015
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So you stay ahead of
your symptoms.

1016
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
VIBERZI can cause new or
worsening abdominal pain.

1017
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Do not take VIBERZI if you have
or may have had:

1018
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
pancreas or
severe liver problems,

1019
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
problems with alcohol abuse,

1020
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
long-lasting or
severe constipation,

1021
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
or a blockage of your bowel
or gallbladder.

1022
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
If you are taking VIBERZI,

1023
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
you should not take medicines
that cause constipation.

1024
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
The most common side effects of
VIBERZI include

1025
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
constipation, nausea, and
abdominal pain.

1026
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Stay ahead of IBS-D...

1027
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
...with VIBERZI.

1028
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
>> Bill: FOLLOW UP ON THE STORY

1029
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OUT OF SYRIA.

1030
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING A

1031
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
STATEMENT OUT ON THE DEADLY

1032
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.

1033
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
BLAMING THE ASSAD REGIME FOR

1034
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLS HEINOUS

1035
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
ACTIONS.

1036
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
ACTIVISTS SAY SYRIAN OR RUSSIAN

1037
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
FIGHTER JETS DROPPED CHEMICALS

1038
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
ON A NORTHERN TOWN IN SYRIA.

1039
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
THE ATTACK KILLED AT LEAST 58

1040
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
AND 11 CHILDREN.

1041
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT READS

1042
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
THE FOLLOWING "TODAY'S CHEMICAL

1043
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
ATTACK IN SYRIA AGAINST INNOCENT

1044
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
PEOPLE, INCLUDING WOMEN AND

1045
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
CHILDREN, IS REPREHENSIBLE AND

1046
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE

1047
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
CIVILIZED WORLD.

1048
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
THESE ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

1049
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
PAST ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS.

1050
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WOULD

1051
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
ESTABLISH A RED LINE AGAINST THE

1052
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND DID

1053
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
NOTHING.
THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH

1054
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
OUR ALLIES ACROSS THE GLOBE TO

1055
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
CONDEMN THIS INTOLERABLE ATTACK.

1056
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
THAT IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE

1057
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1058
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
MORE UPDATES ON THIS STORY AS WE

1059
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
GET DEVELOPMENTS HERE AT THE FOX

1060
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
NEWS CHANNEL.

1061
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
NOW BACK TO CONTINUING COVERAGE

1062
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
OF THE SENATE DEBATE OVER

1063
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE NEIL

1064
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
GORSUCH.
IT'S ALMOST THAT TIME.

1065
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
DEMOCRATS THREATENING TO BLOCK

1066
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
THE CONFIRMATION.

1067
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WILL GET IT

1068
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
DONE ANYWAY.

1069
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I WANT TO BRING IN EMILY GOOD

1070
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
DEN TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS.

1071
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
GOOD AFTERNOON.

1072
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
FOR REPUBLICANS, WHAT THE DO

1073
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
THEY HAVE ON THE LINE FOR THIS

1074
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
POTENTIAL NUCLEAR OPTION?

1075
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
>> IT MAY BACKFIRE ON THEM JUST

1076
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
LIKE IT DID ON DEMOCRATS WHEN

1077
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
THEY DID THIS UNDER PRESIDENT

1078
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
OBAMA.
THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON

1079
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
AND CAN BITE YOU.

1080
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
THIS DOES MAKE THE NOMINATION

1081
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
PROCESS EASIER FOR SUPREME COURT

1082
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
NOMINEES.

1083
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
BUT LET'S SAY IN 2020 A DEMOCRAT

1084
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
GETS ELECTED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

1085
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
THEY WOULD HAVE AN EASIER TIME

1086
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME

1087
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
COURT.
>> WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATS?

1088
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THEM?

1089
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
>> FOR DEMOCRATS, THIS IS REALLY

1090
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
ABOUT RALLYING FOR THE BASE AND

1091
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
LOOKING AHEAD TO THE 2018

1092
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
ELECTION.

1093
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, THE

1094
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
DEMOCRATIC BASE WAS FURIOUS

1095
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MERRICK

1096
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
GARLAND.
THEY SEE THIS AS HIS SUPREME

1097
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
COURT SEAT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

1098
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO NOMINATE

1099
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
HIS NOMINEE AND THE REPUBLICANS

1100
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
STOLE THIS AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE

1101
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
FURIOUS.
THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE BASE

1102
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
HAPPY.
THEY WANT TO TAKE THE SENATE

1103
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
BACK.
>> THEY'RE RAISING MONEY OFF OF

1104
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
THIS, TOO.

1105
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
REPUBLICANS WOULD TAKE THAT

1106
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
ARGUMENT AND SAYING YOU'RE DOING

1107
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
THIS FOR REVENGE.

1108
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
>> REVENGE OR PLANNING AHEAD,

1109
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
PUT IT EITHER WAY.

1110
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
THIS IS A RALLYING CRY FOR THEM.

1111
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THEY'RE ALREADY FUND-RAISING OFF

1112
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
OF IT, THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR

1113
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
DEMOCRATS.
>> YOU NEED 60 VOTES TO END THE

1114
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
DEBATE.

1115
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
IF YOU HAD THE 60 VOTES, YOU

1116
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
COULD GET AN UP OR DOWN VOTE OR

1117
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
GOVERNOR SUM AND THEN ONLY NEED

1118
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
51 VOTES.

1119
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
SO THERE'S A RULE IN THE SENATE

1120
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
THAT NEEDS TO BE VERIFY FOR

1121
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
VIEWERS AT HOME.

1122
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
THAT'S WHY WE TALK ABOUT 51

1123
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
VERSUS 60.

1124
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
DEMOCRATS CHANGED THIS RULE IN

1125
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
THE FIRST PLACE UNDER HARRY REID

1126
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
IN 2013.

1127
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
SO WHAT ARE THEY COMPLAINING

1128
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
ABOUT NOW?

1129
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
>> WELL, EXACTLY.

1130
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
WHAT HAPPENED REPUBLICANS WERE

1131
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
FILIBUSTERING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

1132
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
NOMINEES AND DEMOCRATS WEREN'T

1133
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
HAPPY.
SO THEY CHANGED IT SO YOU ONLY

1134
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
NEED A SIMPLY MAJORITY FOR

1135
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
EVERYTHING BUT SUPREME COURT

1136
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
NOMINEES.
SO NOW WE MAY MAKE IT AN

1137
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
ACROSS-THE-BOARD SIMPLE 51.

1138
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
>> LET'S TURN THE LOGIC AROUND.

1139
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
SAY YOU'RE CHUCK SCHUMER.

1140
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK THIS

1141
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
RULE FOR SUPREME COURT NOMINEES,

1142
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
RIGHT?
SO YOU WORK OUT A WAY TO GET THE

1143
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
60 VOTES.
THE REASON YOU TRY TO DO THAT IS

1144
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A BIG

1145
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
SUPPORTER OF NEIL GORSUCH, YOU

1146
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE IS BEHIND

1147
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
DOOR NUMBER 2.

1148
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS ANOTHER

1149
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
NOMINEE, WHO KNOWS WHO LE OFFER.

1150
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
HE OR SHE MAY BE LESS PALATABLE

1151
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
TO DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE THEN.

1152
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
SO YOU DO A DEAL NOW SO IF THE

1153
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
EVENT COMES UP.

1154
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
YOU SAVE FACE FOR LATER IS.

1155
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
THAT LOGIC TOO TWISTED OR IS

1156
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
THAT LOGIC IMPOSSIBLE?

1157
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
>> BILL, I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY

1158
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
RIGHT.
THERE'S A CONCERN AMONG SOME

1159
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GET

1160
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
ANOTHER NOMINATION.

1161
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE JUSTICES ON

1162
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
THE COURT, THE ODDS ARE THE

1163
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
PERSON LEAVING WILL BE A MORE

1164
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
LIBERAL MEMBER.

1165
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL APPOINT A

1166
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
CONSERVATIVE.
IF HE ONLY NEEDS 51 VOTES, IT'S

1167
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
A DONE DEAL.

1168
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
>> WHAT IS YOUR GUESS NOW?

1169
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
IS NEIL GORSUCH SWORN IN AS THE

1170
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
NEXT SUPREME COURT MEMBER BY THE

1171
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
END OF THE WEEKEND?

1172
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1173
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
IT'S A DONE DEAL.

1174
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
>> A DONE DEAL.

1175
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
>> YOU BELIEVE RIGHT NOW IT'S A

1176
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
51 VOTE COUNT THAT DOES IT WITH

1177
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
THE NUCLEAR OPTION OR DO YOU

1178
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
THINK CHUCK SCHUMER AS PETER

1179
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
DOOCY IS REPORTING IS WORKING ON

1180
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
A BIG DEAL BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

1181
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
NOW?
>> I THINK THAT'S THE UNKNOWN

1182
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
QUESTION.

1183
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THAT'S THE UNKNOWN.

1184
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
WILL IT BE THE 60 OR THE 51.

1185
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
KEEP IN MIND, CHUCK SCHUMER

1186
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
WANTS TO BE SENATE MAJORITY

1187
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
LEADER ONE DAY.
WHATEVER RULES HE MAKES RIGHT

1188
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
NOW, HE HAS TO OPERATE UNDER IN

1189
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THE FUTURE.

1190
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
>> HOW WOULD THAT INFLUENCE HOW

1191
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
HE MAKES THIS WORK OR NOT NOW,

1192
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
EMILY?

1193
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
>> HE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT HE'S

1194
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
MAJORITY LEADER IN SAY 2018.

1195
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
HE'S MAJORITY LEADER UNDER A

1196
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE'S GOING TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO

1197
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
HAVE TO USE THE 60 VOTES BECAUSE

1198
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THAT'S HARDER TO GET.

1199
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
SO HE'S PROBABLY THINKING AHEAD

1200
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
THAT WAY.

1201
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
>> YOU THINK CHUCK SCHUMER IS IN

1202
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
A BOX ON THIS?

1203
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
>> I'M NOT SURE HE'S IN A BOX,

1204
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
BUT HE HAS TO TREAD CAREFULLY.

1205
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
HE'S BALANCING THE FUTURE POWER

1206
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
OF THE SENATE VERSUS HIS PARTY

1207
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
AND HIS DEMOCRATIC BASE, WHICH

1208
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
HE NEEDS IN ORDER TO GET CONTROL

1209
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
OF THE SENATE.
>> LAST QUESTION.

1210
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
YOU BELIEVE PACED ON THE

1211
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
JUDICIAL RECORD OF NEIL GORSUCH

1212
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
THAT HE IS THAT OFFENSIVE TO

1213
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
DEMOCRATS?
IS HE THAT OFFENSIVE TO LIBERALS

1214
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
OR JUST THE EXTREME LIBERAL PART

1215
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?

1216
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
>> THEY HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

1217
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
HIS RECORD ON WORKERS RIGHT.

1218
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE BASE,

1219
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
WOMEN'S RIGHT.

1220
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
SO THERE ARE SOME RED FLAG

1221
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
ISSUES THERE.
WHETHER THAT IS USUALLY

1222
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
DISQUALIFYING, I KNOW A LOT OF

1223
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
SENATORS ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT

1224
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
WE'RE SEEING DEMOCRATS SAY

1225
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM.

1226
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
>> UP TO THREE, I DO BELIEVE.

1227
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.

1228
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
EMILY GOODEN, YOU'RE ON RECORD.

1229
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
YOU'RE BRAVE.
THANKS.

1230
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
FOR YEARS THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT

1231
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
HAS NOT BEEN WELCOME IN

1232
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
WASHINGTON D.C.
NOW TODAY THAT IS CHANGING.

1233
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
THE TRUMP TEAM EXTENDING A HAND

1234
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
TO THE LEADER.

1235
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
WE'LL LOOK WHY THIS IS HAPPENING

1236
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
AND WHAT IT SIGNALS FOR THE

1237
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
MIDDLE EAST AND POLICY BETWEEN

1238
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
THE UNITED STATES AND THOSE

1239
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
COUNTRIES.

1240
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
STAY TUNED FOR THAT.

1241
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
WE CONTINUE.

1242
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
>> SECRETARY OF STATE REX

1243
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
TILLERSON MEETING WERE THE

1244
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT AT THE STATE

1245
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
DEPARTMENT.

1246
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THIS COMES ONLY ONE DAY AFTER

1247
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH THE

1248
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
AUTHORITARIAN LEADERTHE

1249
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
WHITE HOUSE, THIS MARKS A MAJOR

1250
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
SHIFT FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

1251
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
ADMINISTRATION.
HE NEVER HOSTED THE PRESIDENT

1252
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
AFTER A MILITARY TAKEOVER FOUR

1253
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
YEARS AGO.

1254
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
THE U.S. HAS CONDEMNED EGYPT FOR

1255
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

1256
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING AN

1257
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
AMERICAN AIDE WORKER FOR THREE

1258
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
YEARS.
WE'RE GOING TO RICH EDSON WITH

1259
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
MORE.
>> WELL, BILL, THIS IS THE

1260
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
SECOND STRAIGHT DAY OF MEETINGS

1261
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
FOR PRESIDENT SISI RIGHT HERE IN

1262
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
WASHINGTON.

1263
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
HE'S ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW

1264
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
MEETING WITH TOP CONGRESSIONAL

1265
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
LEADERS RIGHT NOW.

1266
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THIS IS AFTER A PUBLIC DISPLAY

1267
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
YESTERDAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT

1268
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT

1269
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
TRUMP SAID THAT THE U.S. STANDS

1270
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
BEHIND SISI NOTING HE'S DONE A

1271
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
FANTASTIC JOB IN A DIFFICULT

1272
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
SITUATION.
THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO ADDS THAT

1273
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THE U.S. AND EGYPT WILL CONTINUE

1274
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
COORDINATING ON MILITARY AND

1275
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL EFFORTS

1276
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
TO DEFEAT EXTREMISM.

1277
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

1278
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
SECRETARY OF STATE HAS BEEN

1279
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
WORKING ON OVER THE LAST COUPLE

1280
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
WEEKS.

1281
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
HE JUST RETURNED FROM OVERSEAS,

1282
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
MEETING WITH TURKISH OFFICIALS,

1283
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
NATO OFFICIALS.

1284
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
ON TOP OF THAT, AS YOU

1285
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
MENTIONED, THIS IS A MUCH

1286
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
GREATER EMBRACE BY THE TRUMP

1287
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000

00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
DAY IN HISTORY, OLD GLORY.

1327
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
WHY PAUSE A
SPONTANEOUS MOMENT?

1328
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
CIALIS FOR DAILY USE TREATS ED
AND THE URINARY SYMPTOMS OF BPH.

1329
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT YOUR MEDICINES,

1330
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

1331
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

1332
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
OR ADEMPAS® FOR
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,

1333
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IN EXCESS.

1335
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

1336
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

1337
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS OF HEARING OR VISION,

1338
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
OR AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
STOP TAKING CIALIS

1339
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

1340
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CIALIS.

1341
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000

1346
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000

1347
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
