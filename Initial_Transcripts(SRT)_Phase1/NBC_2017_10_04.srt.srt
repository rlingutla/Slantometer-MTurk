    in the mirror everyday.

           everyday.            

374
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,406

  help change people's lives.   

378
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,218
  I may not benefit from those

379
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,187

   Start the interview with a   
        firm handshake.         

383
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,933
     Ay,no! Don't do that!

 That, and I am better looking. 

394

         I heard that.

  And 25% less saturated fat.

404
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,839
         Better taste.          

405
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,840
       Better nutrition.        

406
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:16,707
          Better eggs.          

407
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,076
      We always were told       
        we were German.         

408
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:21,679
   We were in a German dance    
   group. I wore lederhosen.    

409
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,814
    So I just started poking    
      around on Ancestry.       

410
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,484
    Then, I decided to have     
     my DNA tested through      

411
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,418
         Ancestry DNA.          

412
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,919
   It turns out I'm Scottish.   

413
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:32,023
       So, I traded in my       
     lederhosen for a kilt.     

414
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,457
         <i> Patrick woke up</i>       
         <i> with back pain.</i>       

415
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,293
           <i> But he has</i>          
          <i> work to do.</i>          

416
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,427
         <i> So he took Aleve.</i>     

417
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,329
        <i> If he'd taken Tylenol, </i>

418
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,464
         <i> he'd be stopping for</i>  
        <i> more pills right now.</i>  

419
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,867
<i>Only Aleve has the strength</i>     
     <i> to stop tough pain</i>        

420
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,169
  <i> for up to 12 hours</i>           
 <i> with just one pill.</i>

    <i> Aleve. All Day Strong. </i>    

422
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,340
      One laugh, and hello      
       sensitive bladder.       

423
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,509
  So I tried Always Discreet.   

424
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,744
   I didn't think protection    
     this thin could work.      

425
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,480
    But the super absorbent     
   core turns liquid to gel.    

426
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,148
             SNAP!              

427
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,316
    So it's out of sight...     

428
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,183
      ...and out of mind.
