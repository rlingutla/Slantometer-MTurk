UNANIMOUS ON ALL 45 CHARGES

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000

106
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000

HEART.
CALLING HIM A TERRORIST

118
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WOULD HAVE JEOPARDIZED THE

119
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
TRIAL.
THE JURORS COULD ARGUE THE

120
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
GOVERNMENT HAD ALREADY

PLEADED GUILTY TO AVOID THE

132
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DEATH PENALTY.

133
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
ONLY OTHER OPTION WAS LIFE

134
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WITH THE CHANCE OF PAROLE

135
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000

ONE MAN LOST 11 RELATIVES

144
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
ONE DEAD.

146
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A PILE OF BURNING BODIES.

147

BALES WAS ON HIS FOURTH

154
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SORRY FOR THE MASSACRE.

155
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
CALLING IT AN ACT OF

156
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
COWARDICE THAT HE CANNOT

157
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
EXPLAIN.

158
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HE SAYS HE THINKS OF THE

159
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
VICTIMS EVERY TIME HE LOOKS

160
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
AT HIS OWN TWO CHILDREN.

161
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000

REALLY DID SAVE MY LIFE.

183
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
HE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME

184
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
THAT'S WHY ALLY TREATS ALL  THEIR
CUSTOMERS THE SAME.

378
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
WHETHER YOU'RE THE  FIRST OR THE MILLIONTH.

379
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
IF YOUR BANK DOESN'T THINK  YOU'RE

380
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SPECIAL ANYMORE

381
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
YOU NEED AN ALLY.

382
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
ALLY BANK.

383
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
YOUR MONEY NEEDS AN ALLY.

384
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When you realize you need  to switch

385
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to Verizon  it's a reality check.

386
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I had my  reality check when

387
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'd be sitting there  with my friends

388
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
who had their Verizon phones  and

389
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'd be sitting there like

390
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
"mine's still loading!"

391
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I couldn't get email.
I couldn't stream movies.

392
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I couldn't upload  any of our music.

393
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's when I decided  to switch.

394
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now that I'm on Verizon,  everything
moves fast.

395
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
With Verizon  I have that reliability.

396
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm completely happy  with Verizon.

397
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Verizon's 4G LTE  is the most reliable

398
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and in more places than  any other

399
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
4G network.

400
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Period.

401
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's powerful.  Verizon.

402
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Get the Nokia Lumia 928  for free.

403
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Play close.  Good and close.

404
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000

teeth clean

405

You'll love how they help clean.

410

With soft, meaty centers

411
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and teeth cleaning texture

412
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Healthy Smile Snacks help keep a

413
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
shine on his smile.
It's dental that tastes so good.

414
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
New Beneful Healthy Smile Food  and

415
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000

MY MANTRA?  TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS

417
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000

418
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
TO TREAT MY LOW TESTOSTERONE

419
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000

451
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING

452
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000

453
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
GET THE U.S. MILITARY

AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE THE

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
SITUATION IN SYRIA IS VERY

460
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
DIFFICULT.
AND THE NOTION THAT THE

461
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
U.S. CAN SOMEHOW SOLVE WHAT

462
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
IS A SECTARIAN, COMPLEXED

463
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
PROBLEM INSIDE OF SYRIA

464
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
SOMETIMES IS OVERSTATED.

465
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
>> BUT DELAY CAN BE DEADLY,

466
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT.
>> THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT

467
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
WHEN YOU START SEEING

468
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED ON A

469
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
LARGE SCALE AND AGAIN

470
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WE'RE STILL GATHERING

471
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS

472
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
PARTICULAR EVENT BUT IT IS

473
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
VERY TROUBLESOME.

474
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
>> Jon: WHITE HOUSE

AMERICA'S OPTIONS.

478
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
OF COURSE, ALL THIS IS

479
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
UNFOLDING AS THE PRESIDENT

480
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
WRAPS UP A TWO-DAY BUS TOUR

481
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000

ED?
>> WELL JON, YOU ARE

488

RIGHT.

489
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
THIS BUS TOUR WAS SUPPOSED

490
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
TO BEEN ALL ABOUT DOMESTIC

491
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
ISSUES.

492
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE

493
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
THE PRESIDENT FACING A

494
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
CREDIBILITY TEST.
ONE WEEK AGO THIS WEEK THAT

495
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
HE DREW THAT RED LINE ON

496
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SARA I

497
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
CAN'TENNED A PROMISED THERE

498
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
WOULD BE ENORMOUS

499
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
CONSEQUENCES IF SYRIA
CROSSED THAT RED LINE.

500
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN

501
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
CROSSED SEVERAL TIMES AND

502
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
POSSIBLY YET AGAIN THIS

503
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WEEK WITH A MASSIVE

504
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
CHEMICAL ATTACK THAT KILLED
UP TO 1800 PEOPLE.

505
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
IS HE UNDER PRESSURE TO ACT

506
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
IN THAT CNN INTERVIEW THAT

507
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
YOU REFERRED TO THE

508
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
PRESIDENT LASHED OUT AT

509
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
SYRIA OVER THIS ALLEGED

510
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
ATTACK, SAID HE IS STILL  EVIDENCE

511
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
TO
COME IN.
STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING HE

512
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
WOULD USE MILITARY ACTION

513
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
LEADING TO CONSERVATIVES TO

514
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
CHARGE THAT HE IS DODDLING.

515
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

516
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
>> JUMPING IN TO STUFF THAT

517
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
DOES NOT TURN OUT WELL.

518
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
GETS US MIRED IN VERY

519
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.

520
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
CAN RESULT IN US BEING

521
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
DRAWN IN TO VERY EXPENSIVE,

522
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
DIFFICULT, COSTLY

523
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
INTERVENTIONS THAT ACTUALLY

524
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
BREED MORE RESENTMENT IN

525
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
THE REGION.

526
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH

527
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
STRATEGICALLY WHAT'S GOING

528
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
TO BE IN OUR LONG-TERM

529
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
NATIONAL INTEREST EVEN AS

530
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
WE WORK COOPERATIVELY

531
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
INTERNATIONALLY TO DO

532
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT

533
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
PRESSURE ON THOSE WHO WOULD

534
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

535
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
>> THE POLICY IS FOCUSED

536
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
AROUND NOT GETTING INVOLVED

537
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
SO FAR 100,000 DEAD MOSTLY

538
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
KILLED BY BULLETS OR

539
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
WHISTLES.
HARD TO SAY HOW 1,000 OR

540
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
COUPLE HUNDRED DEAD FROM A

541
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
CHEMICAL WEAPON WHILE

542
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
DEPLORABLE WOULD IMPACT HIS

543
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
CALCULUS.

544
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> NOW, WHAT'S NEXT?
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY

545
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
RULED OUT U.S. GROUND

546
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TROOPS IN SARA I CAN'T.

547
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
BUT I'M TOLD THAT THAT HIGH

548
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000

MENTIONED ONE OPTION THAT
IS BEING DISCUSSED IS U.S.

551
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA AND

552
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
POSSIBLY WHOSE MISSILES TO

553
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
SEND A MESSAGE TO SYRIAN

554
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD.

555
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>> ED HADN'TRY, THANK YOU.

556
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
>> WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE

557
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
CONTINUES TO HEDGE ITS

558
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
RESPONSE.

559
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
BRITAIN'S TOP DIPLOMAT
