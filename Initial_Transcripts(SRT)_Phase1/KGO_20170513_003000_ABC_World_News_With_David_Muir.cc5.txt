[000:00:17;851] AFTER THE PRESIDENT SAYS THEY
[000:00:18;852] HAD THREE CONVERSATIONS CLEARING
[000:00:19;486] HIM.
[000:00:21;521] IS THAT A THREAT TO THE MAN WHO
[000:00:22;155] WAS HEADING THE RUSSIA
[000:00:22;655] INVESTIGATION?
[000:00:25;725] AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS ASKED,
[000:00:26;326] ARE CONVERSATIONS BEING
[000:00:26;826] RECORDED?

[000:00:46;079] 8-YEAR-OLD BOY FAINTED.
[000:00:47;480] DOES THE VIDEO TELL A DIFFERENT
[000:00:48;114] STORY?
[000:00:50;850] AND HOW LONG WAS HE LEFT THERE,
[000:00:51;484] DAYS LATER, TAKING HIS OWN LIFE.
[000:00:54;287] >>> AND THE DEADLY COLLISION
[000:00:54;888] WITH A BUS.
[000:00:55;288] TRAFFIC HALTED FOR MILES.

[000:01:14;007] HAVE YOU WITH US ON A FRIDAY
[000:01:14;607] NIGHT.

[000:01:16;709] TRUMP'S MESSAGE FOR FIRED FBI
[000:01:18;845] DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
[000:01:21;314] PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETING THAT
[000:01:22;082] JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THERE
[000:01:22;849] ARE NO TAPES OF WHAT THEY SAID.
[000:01:25;952] THE PRESIDENT SAYING COMEY TOLD
[000:01:26;586] HIM HE'S NOT UNDER
[000:01:27;520] INVESTIGATION.
[000:01:30;857] BUT TONIGHT, MAJOR NEW
[000:01:32;725] QUESTIONS.
[000:01:33;226] IS THE WHITE HOUSE RECORDING
[000:01:33;827] CONVERSATIONS?
[000:01:34;294] ARE THERE TAPES?
[000:01:34;861] AND IS THE PRESIDENT THREATENING
[000:01:38;431] THE MAN WHO WAS LEADING THE
[000:01:38;998] RUSSIA INVESTIGATION?
[000:01:39;499] TONIGHT, HOW THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:01:40;100] ANSWERS.
[000:01:41;101] JONATHAN KARL LEADING US OFF.
[000:01:46;106] >> Reporter: HE'S ALREADY FIRED
[000:01:46;840] HIM.
[000:01:50;877] AND TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMED
[000:01:51;511] AN APPARENT THREAT AT FORMER FBI
[000:01:52;145] DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.
[000:01:58;118] TWEETING, COMEY HAD BETTER HOPE
[000:01:59;752] THERE ARE NO TAPES BEFORE HE
[000:02:00;353] STARTS LEAKING TO THE PRESS.
[000:02:00;920] WAIT A MINUTE, TAPES?
[000:02:01;821] IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TAPING HIS
[000:02:02;889] WHITE HOUSE CONVERSATIONS?
[000:02:06;493] TODAY AFTER THE TWEET, A
[000:02:07;026] NONDENIAL.
[000:02:10;697] >> WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT YOU
[000:02:11;731] SAID THERE MIGHT BE TAPE
[000:02:13;800] RECORDINGS?
[000:02:14;100] >> THAT, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT.
[000:02:14;834] I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.
[000:02:16;936] ALL I WANT IS FOR COMEY TO BE
[000:02:18;838] HONEST, AND I HOPE HE WILL BE.
[000:02:20;039] AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE, I HOPE.
[000:02:30;450] >> Reporter: A RECORDING WOULD
[000:02:31;084] REVEAL WHETHER COMEY SAID WHAT
[000:02:31;718] THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS HE SAID
[000:02:32;519] ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
[000:02:33;153] >> I SAID, IF IT'S POSSIBLE,
[000:02:34;053] WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW, AM I
[000:02:34;621] UNDER INVESTIGATION?
[000:02:35;054] HE SAID, YOU ARE NOT UNDER
[000:02:35;622] INVESTIGATION.
[000:02:37;223] >> Reporter: TODAY, THE WHITE
[000:02:37;824] HOUSE WAS PRESSED ON WHETHER THE
[000:02:39;826] PRESIDENT WAS THREATENING COMEY.
[000:02:40;860] AND WHETHER ANY RECORDINGS
[000:02:41;427] ACTUALLY EXIST.
[000:02:46;199] >> DID PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORD
[000:02:47;066] HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH COMEY?
[000:02:50;703] >> I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT.
[000:02:51;337] THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING
[000:02:53;840] FURTHER TO ADD ON THAT.
[000:02:54;841] >> ARE THERE RECORDING DEVICES
[000:02:59;546] IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR RESIDENCE?
[000:03:00;180] >> I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO
[000:03:01;114] ADD.
[000:03:01;614] >> DOES HE THINK IT'S
[000:03:02;715] APPROPRIATE TO THREATEN SOMEONE
[000:03:03;349] LIKE MR. COMEY NOT TO SPEAK?
[000:03:03;917] >> THAT'S NOT A THREAT.
[000:03:05;285] HE SIMPLY STATED A FACT.
[000:03:05;785] THE TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.
[000:03:06;352] I'M MOVING ON.
[000:03:10;156] >> Reporter: SEAN SPICER REFUSED
[000:03:11;024] TO CONFIRM OR DENY WHETHER OR
[000:03:12;058] NOT THE WHITE HOUSE IS BUGGED.
[000:03:14;127] SEAN, DID YOU ASK THE PRESIDENT
[000:03:17;764] IF HE'S INSTALLED LISTENING
[000:03:18;331] DEVICES IN THE WHITE HOUSE?
[000:03:21;401] DID YOU ASK THE PRESIDENT IF HE
[000:03:22;168] INSTALLED LISTENING DEVICES?
[000:03:26;839] SECRET WHITE HOUSE RECORDINGS
[000:03:28;641] ARE NOT UNPRECEDENTED.
[000:03:29;242] KENNEDY AND LBG SECRETLY TAPED
[000:03:32;812] THEIR OVAL OFFICE MEETINGS.
[000:03:34;113] AND SO DID RICHARD NIXON.
[000:03:34;847] NIXON'S TAPES HELPED BRING DOWN
[000:03:36;983] HIS PRESIDENCY, AND NO PRESIDENT
[000:03:37;617] SINCE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
[000:03:38;117] INSTALLING LISTENING DEVICES IN
[000:03:40;153] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:03:44;757] >> JON, THE QUESTION TONIGHT IS,
[000:03:46;893] IS THIS WHITE HOUSE RECORDING
[000:03:47;894] CONVERSATIONS, OR WERE THOSE
[000:03:48;494] JUST WORDS IN A TWEET?
[000:03:51;531] SEAN SPICER REFUSING TO SAY
[000:03:53;099] WHETHER THEY WERE RECORDING
[000:03:53;666] PEOPLE?
[000:03:54;667] >> Reporter: I THOUGHT IT WAS
[000:03:58;838] STRIKING THAT HE DID NOT KNOCK
[000:04:01;407] DOWN OR DENY THAT THE WHITE
[000:04:01;975] HOUSE AND OVAL OFFICE IS BUGGED.
[000:04:02;976] AND NOW, TWO TOP DEMOCRATS
[000:04:07;647] IN THE HOUSE SAYING THEY WANT TO
[000:04:08;281] SEE ANY TAPES RELATED TO THE
[000:04:12;352] COMEY FIRING.
[000:04:12;685] AND THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
[000:04:14;854] SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE,
[000:04:18;024] WHICH IS LEADING THE
[000:04:18;491] INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA, TELLS
[000:04:19;125] ABC NEWS, IF THERE ARE TAPES,
[000:04:21;194] THEY SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND
[000:04:22;228] HANDED OVER.
[000:04:22;762] >> JON, THANK YOU.
[000:04:25;331] >>> THIS EVENING, JAMES COMEY'S
[000:04:26;899] SIDE OF THE STORY BEGINNING TO
[000:04:27;533] EMERGE.
[000:04:33;206] SOURCES CLOSE TO HIM SAYING HE'S
[000:04:33;840] FURIOUS.
[000:04:34;173] AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE DINNER
[000:04:40;213] BETWEEN THE TWO, COMEY'S CAMP
[000:04:41;447] SAYING THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM
[000:04:42;081] TO BE LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT.
[000:04:42;682] AND TONIGHT, ONE KEY PLAYER
[000:04:43;249] SAYING COMEY SAID HE WAS
[000:04:43;783] UNCOMFORTABLE GOING INTO THE
[000:04:44;384] DINNER.
[000:04:47;186] PIERRE THOMAS AGAIN TONIGHT.
[000:04:49;255] >> Reporter: TONIGHT, TWO MEN.
[000:04:50;323] TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT
[000:04:50;890] STORIES.
[000:04:52;892] ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED SOURCES IN
[000:04:54;460] FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES
[000:05:01;734] COMEY'S CIRCLE SAY, AT THAT
[000:05:02;302] JANUARY DINNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:05:02;935] ASKED COMEY MORE THAN ONCE
[000:05:03;503] WHETHER HE WOULD BE LOYAL TO
[000:05:04;103] HIM.
[000:05:05;872] OUR SOURCES SAY COMEY ONLY
[000:05:06;439] PROMISED TO BE HONEST.
[000:05:08;007] BUT TODAY, THE PRESIDENT FLATLY
[000:05:08;641] DENIED THAT EVER HAPPENED.
[000:05:10;610] >> DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?
[000:05:11;210] >> NO, I DIDN'T.
[000:05:14;847] BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A
[000:05:18;851] BE A BAD QUESTION TO ASK.
[000:05:20;987] I THINK LOYALTY TO THE COUNTRY,
[000:05:21;621] TO THE UNITED STATES, IS
[000:05:22;155] IMPORTANT.
[000:05:22;822] IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE
[000:05:25;124] LOYALTY.
[000:05:26;693] NUMBER ONE, NUMBER TWO, I DON'T
[000:05:27;327] KNOW HOW THAT GOT THERE.
[000:05:27;827] BECAUSE I DIDN'T ASK THAT
[000:05:30;830] QUESTION.
[000:05:31;898] >> Reporter: MULTIPLE SOURCES
[000:05:32;498] ALSO TELL ABC NEWS THEY DO NOT
[000:05:34;000] BELIEVE COMEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:34;634] HE WAS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION,
[000:05:35;568] AS TRUMP CLAIMED.
[000:05:38;137] >> HE WANTED TO STAY ON AS FBI
[000:05:38;905] HEAD, AND I SAID I WOULD
[000:05:39;439] CONSIDER IT.
[000:05:40;206] WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
[000:05:42;809] AND WE HAD A NICE DINNER.
[000:05:44;944] AT THAT TIME, HE TOLD ME YOU ARE
[000:05:46;446] NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, WHICH I
[000:05:50;850] KNEW ANYWAY.
[000:05:54;787] >> Reporter: FORMER DIRECTOR
[000:05:58;925] OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES
[000:05:59;959] CLAPPER MET COMEY ON THE DAY OF
[000:06:01;527] THE DINNER, AND SAID COMEY WAS
[000:06:02;829] WORRIED HOW IT WOULD APPEAR.
[000:06:03;629] >> HE MENTIONED HE HAD BEEN
[000:06:04;197] INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO
[000:06:05;198] HAVE DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT.
[000:06:06;866] AND HE WAS UNEASY WITH THAT.
[000:06:07;467] >> Reporter: TRUMP CALLED COMEY
[000:06:09;335] A SHOWBOATER.
[000:06:09;669] ALL OF THIS GALVANIZING MANY IN

[000:06:12;438] WHO BELIEVE COMEY HAS BEEN
[000:06:13;005] TREATED SHABBILY.
[000:06:20;313] AS FOR A REPLACEMENT, THE SEARCH
[000:06:23;483] BEGINS TOMORROW.
[000:06:24;817] AT LEAST FOUR CANDIDATES HAVE
[000:06:26;619] BEEN INTERVIEWED.
[000:06:30;490] >> AND WE'RE LEARNING COMEY WILL
[000:06:31;524] NOT TESTIFY ON THE HILL NEXT
[000:06:32;125] WEEK?
[000:06:32;558] DESPITE THE INVITATION TO SPEAK
[000:06:33;626] BEHIND CLOSED DOORS?
[000:06:34;160] >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S
[000:06:34;861] DECLINED TO APPEAR ON TUESDAY.
[000:06:35;695] BUT THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE

[000:06:38;898] SAYS HE BELIEVES COMEY WILL
[000:06:40;900] APPEAR AT THE RIGHT TIME AND

[000:10:24;223] QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

[000:10:27;860] OR WAS HE BULLIED?

[000:15:42;107] And take it from me,
[000:15:42;107] every step counts.
[000:15:44;910] A Bayer aspirin regimen
[000:15:44;910] is one of those steps
[000:15:47;212] in helping prevent
[000:15:47;212] another stroke.
[000:15:49;214] Be sure to talk
[000:15:49;214] to your doctor
[000:15:51;050] before you begin
[000:15:51;050] an aspirin regimen.
[000:15:54;119] If you have moderate
[000:15:55;621] to severe plaque psoriasis,
[000:15:58;190] isn't it time
[000:15:59;725] to let the real you
[000:15:59;725] shine through?
[000:16:03;395] Introducing Otezla, apremilast.
[000:16:06;065] Otezla is not an injection
[000:16:07;633] or a cream.
[000:16:09;234] It's a pill that treats
[000:16:09;234] plaque psoriasis differently.
[000:16:11;670] Some people who took Otezla
[000:16:13;305] saw 75% clearer skin
[000:16:13;305] after 4 months.
[000:16:16;375] And Otezla's
[000:16:16;375] prescribing information
[000:16:18;377] has no requirement for
[000:16:18;377] routine lab monitoring.
[000:16:21;013] Don't take Otezla
[000:16:21;013] if you are allergic
[000:16:22;948] to any of its ingredients.
[000:16:24;416] Otezla may increase
[000:16:24;416] the risk of depression.
[000:16:26;685] Tell your doctor
[000:16:26;685] if you have a history
[000:16:28;153] of depression
[000:16:28;153] or suicidal thoughts,
[000:16:29;955] or if these feelings develop.
[000:16:31;790] Some people taking Otezla
[000:16:31;790] reported weight loss.
[000:16:34;460] Your doctor should
[000:16:34;460] monitor your weight
[000:16:35;828] and may stop treatment.
[000:16:37;429] Side effects
[000:16:37;429] may include
[000:16:37;429] diarrhea, nausea,
[000:16:39;431] upper respiratory
[000:16:39;431] tract infection,
[000:16:40;833] and headache.
[000:16:42;167] Tell your doctor
[000:16:43;469] about all the
[000:16:43;469] medicines you take,
[000:16:44;870] and if you're pregnant

[000:18:42;855] Once-daily BREO prevents asthma

[000:18:46;191] BREO is for adults

[000:18:51;864] inhaler

[000:18:59;605] BREO contains a type of medicine
[000:19:01;340] that increases the risk of death
[000:19:03;041] from asthma problems
[000:19:03;976] and may increase the risk
[000:19:03;976] of hospitalization
[000:19:05;611] in children and adolescents.
[000:19:07;212] BREO is not for people whose
[000:19:08;213] asthma is well controlled on a
[000:19:09;281] long-term asthma control
[000:19:09;281] medicine,
[000:19:11;116] like an inhaled corticosteroid.
[000:19:13;051] Once your asthma is well
[000:19:13;051] controlled,
[000:19:14;286] your doctor will decide if you
[000:19:15;888] can stop BREO and prescribe a
[000:19:17;189] different asthma control
[000:19:17;189] medicine,
[000:19:18;891] like an inhaled corticosteroid.
[000:19:20;359] Do not take BREO more than
[000:19:20;359] prescribed.
[000:19:22;194] See your doctor if your asthma
[000:19:23;128] does not improve or gets worse.
[000:19:25;097] Ask your doctor
[000:19:25;097] if 24-hour BREO
[000:19:26;965] could be a missing
[000:19:26;965] piece for you.

[000:19:34;373] when this guy got a flat tire
[000:19:36;175] in the middle of the night.
[000:19:37;709] Hold on Dad...
[000:19:38;677] Liberty did what?
[000:19:40;045] Yeah, Liberty Mutual 24-Hour
[000:19:40;045] Roadside Assistance
[000:19:42;414] helped him to fix his flat
[000:19:43;949] so he could get home safely.
[000:19:46;485] My dad says our insurance
[000:19:46;485] doesn't have that.
[000:19:49;354] Don't worry - I know what a
[000:19:49;354] lug wrench is, Dad.
[000:19:52;457] Is this a lug wrench?
[000:19:54;660] Maybe?
[000:19:56;495] You can leave worry behind

[000:20:19;484] As after a DVT blood clot,ital
[000:20:21;119] I sure had a lot
[000:20:21;119] to think about.
[000:20:22;821] What about the
[000:20:22;821] people I care about?
[000:20:24;756] ...including this little girl.
[000:20:26;558] And what if this
[000:20:26;558] happened again?
[000:20:28;827] I was given warfarin
[000:20:28;827] in the hospital,
[000:20:30;629] but wondered, was this the
[000:20:30;629] best treatment for me?
[000:20:33;265] So I asked my doctor.
[000:20:34;600] And he recommended ELIQUIS.
[000:20:36;368] ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:20:36;368] and PE blood clots
[000:20:39;104] and reduces the risk of
[000:20:39;104] them happening again.
[000:20:41;673] Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:20:41;673] and PE blood clots.
[000:20:44;710] ELIQUIS also had
[000:20:46;011] significantly
[000:20:46;011] less major
[000:20:46;011] bleeding
[000:20:47;913] than the
[000:20:47;913] standard
[000:20:47;913] treatment.
[000:20:49;481] Both made me
[000:20:49;481] turn around my
[000:20:49;481] thinking.
[000:20:51;950] Don't stop ELIQUIS
[000:20:51;950] unless your doctor tells you to.
[000:20:54;019] ELIQUIS can cause serious and
[000:20:54;019] in rare cases fatal bleeding.
[000:20:57;222] Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
[000:20:57;222] an artificial heart valve
[000:20:59;424] or abnormal bleeding.
[000:21:00;892] If you had a spinal injection
[000:21:00;892] while on ELIQUIS
[000:21:02;961] call your doctor right away
[000:21:04;162] if you have tingling,
[000:21:04;162] numbness, or muscle weakness.
[000:21:06;265] While taking ELIQUIS,
[000:21:06;265] you may bruise more easily
[000:21:08;800] ...and it may take longer
[000:21:08;800] than usual for bleeding to stop.
[000:21:11;169] Seek immediate medical care
[000:21:11;169] for sudden signs of bleeding,
[000:21:13;505] like unusual bruising.
[000:21:14;840] ELIQUIS may increase
[000:21:14;840] your bleeding risk
[000:21:16;808] if you take
[000:21:16;808] certain medicines.
[000:21:18;043] Tell your doctor
[000:21:18;043] about all planned
[000:21:20;045] medical or dental
[000:21:20;045] procedures.
[000:21:21;513] ELIQUIS treats
[000:21:21;513] DVT and PE
[000:21:21;513] blood clots.
[000:21:24;449] Plus had
[000:21:24;449] less major
[000:21:24;449] bleeding.
[000:21:26;518] Both made ELIQUIS
[000:21:26;518] the right treatment for me.
[000:21:29;121] Ask your doctor if switching
[000:21:29;121] to ELIQUIS is right for you.

[000:22:43;095] WHO IS OUR PERSON OF THE WEEK?
[000:23:39;885] ♪ Strike a pose
[000:23:42;087] ♪
[000:23:44;523] Your eyes work as
[000:23:44;523] hard as you do.
[000:23:47;159] But do they need help making
[000:23:47;159] more of their own tears?
[000:23:50;328] If you have Chronic Dry Eye
[000:23:51;930] caused by reduced tear
[000:23:51;930] production due to inflammation,
[000:23:55;000] RESTASIS MultiDose™ can help...
[000:23:57;335] with continued use
[000:23:57;335] twice a day, every day,
[000:24:00;472] one drop at a time.
[000:24:04;209] RESTASIS MultiDose™ helps
[000:24:04;209] increase your eyes'
[000:24:06;445] natural ability
[000:24:06;445] to produce tears,
[000:24:08;547] which may be
[000:24:08;547] reduced by inflammation
[000:24:10;449] due to Chronic Dry Eye.
[000:24:12;017] RESTASIS MultiDose™ did not
[000:24:12;017] increase tear production
[000:24:14;619] in patients using
[000:24:14;619] anti-inflammatory eye drops
[000:24:17;055] or tear duct plugs.
[000:24:18;690] To help avoid eye
[000:24:18;690] injury and contamination,
[000:24:20;892] do not touch the bottle tip
[000:24:20;892] to your eye or other surfaces.
[000:24:24;162] Wait 15 minutes after use
[000:24:24;162] before inserting contact lenses.
[000:24:27;833] The most common side effect is
[000:24:27;833] a temporary burning sensation.
[000:24:31;336] Your eyes.
[000:24:32;737] Your tears.
[000:24:34;139] Ask your eye doctor
[000:24:34;139] about RESTASIS MultiDose™.

[000:25:15;947] It kills all three
[000:25:15;947] through contact.
[000:25:17;549] No biting required.
[000:25:18;550] So they don't
[000:25:18;550] have to bite?
[000:25:19;551] That's right. No
[000:25:19;551] biting required.
