[Burker] At Farmers,
we've seen almost everything

938
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
so we know how to cover almost
anything.

939
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Even a "Red-Hot Mascot."

940
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
[MASCOT] Hey-ooo!

941
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Whoop, whoop!

942
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
[CROWD 1] Hey, you're on fire!

943
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
[MASCOT] You bet I am!

944
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
[CROWD 2] Dude, you're on fire!

945
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
[MASCOT] Oh, yeah!

946
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
[CROWD 3] No, you're on fire!

947
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Look behind you.

948
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
[MASCOT] I'm cool. I'm cool.

949
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
[BURKE] That's one way to fire
up the crowd.

950
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But we covered it.

Crest Glamorous White
Whitestrips are the only

ADA-accepted whitening strips
proven to be safe and effective.

961
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They work below the enamel
surface to whiten 25x better

962
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
than a leading
whitening toothpaste.

Hey, nice smile!

Medicare only covers about 80%
of your Part B medical expenses.

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
The rest is up to you.

983
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
So think about an AARP Medicare
Supplement Insurance Plan,

984
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
insured by UnitedHealthcare
Insurance Company.

985
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Like any standardized Medicare
Supplement insurance plans,

986
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
they help cover some of what
Medicare doesn't pay.

987
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
