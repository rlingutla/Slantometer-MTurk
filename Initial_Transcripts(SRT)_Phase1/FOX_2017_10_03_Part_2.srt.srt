THE SYMPTOMS ARE BRAIN DAMAGE

THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED

51
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:03,155
Then we found out how many years
  that money would last them.   

52
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,289
        How long do you

57
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,332
      of even the average       
     length of retirement.      

58
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:16,568
     We have to think about     
 not when we expect to live to, 

59
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,003
   but when we could live to.   

60

122
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,518
THING.

>> HE WAS TREMENDOUSLY          

125
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,160
SUPPORTIVE.                     
HE KNEW THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM    

126
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,997
THAT YOU HAD AT THE BEGINNING   
BEFORE AND THE LEVEL OF WHAT

HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE    
TREMENDOUS STORMS THAT HAVE HIT 

128
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,305
YOUR BEAUTIFUL ISLAND.          
TO THE GOVERNOR, I WANT TO TELL 

129
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,142
YOU THAT RIGHT FROM THE         
BEGINNING, THIS GOVERNOR DID NOT

130
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,345
PLAY POLITICS.                  
HE DIDN'T PLAY IT AT ALL.       

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,815
HE WAS SAYING IT LIKE IT WAS.   
HE WAS GIVING US THE HIGHEST    

132
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,785
GRADES.                         
ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY, I WANT

THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED ABOUT 
THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY    

138
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,844
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO REBUILD   
PUERTO RICO AND JOKED THIS      

139
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,648
MORNING THE DISASTER HAS        
STRETCHED THE FEDERAL BUDGET A  

140
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,816
LITTLE BIT THIN.                
LISTEN HERE.

RICO, BUT YOU'RE THROWING OUR   

142
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,123
BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF WHACK.   
WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IN      

143
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,458
PUERTO RICO.                    
THAT'S FINE.                    

144
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,930
WE SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.        
>> ON CAPITOL HILL, SENATOR     

145
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:57,068
CHUCK SCHUMER OF NEW YORK SAID  
HE DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE JOKE   

146
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,640

00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,308
RICO.                           
A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO    

148

THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE SURE

150
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:13,218
THE FOCUS IS ON DISASTER RELIEF 
AND ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT PUERTO 

151
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:17,188
RICO'S DEBT WILL HAVE TO WAIT   
UNTIL LATER, UNTIL AFTER THEY   

152
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,157
HAVE RECOVERED FROM THE STORM.  
>> Shepard: JOHN, THE PRESIDENT

LATE TONIGHT, TOMORROW MORNING  

156
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,735
AND WILL HEAD OUT TO LAS VEGAS. 
THE PRESIDENT SAYING A WHILE AGO

IN TERMS OF THE TRIP TO         
LAS VEGAS, HE LOOKS FORWARD TO  

158
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,977
PAYING HIS PERSONAL RESPECTS AND
CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE.        

159
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:44,416
SUCH A TRAGEDY, SO UNNECESSARY. 
I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING         

160
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,184
TOMORROW.                       
THE FIRST LADY WILL BE COMING

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:52,324

THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS ANXIOUS

00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,861
TO GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING WHY 
THE GUNMAN DID THIS AND A HIGH  

163
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,464
PRAISE FOR POLICE THAT RAN      
TOWARDS DANGER AND TRACKED DOWN 

164
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,667
WHERE HE WAS FIRING FROM.       
LISTEN HERE.                    

165
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:07,872
>> WE HAVE A TRAGEDY.           
WHAT HAPPENED IN LAS VEGAS IS IN

166
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:13,044
MANY WAYS A MIRACLE.            
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE  

167
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:20,752
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB.         
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GUN LAWS.

168
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:25,824
HIS A SICK MAN, DEMENTED MAN.   
WE'RE LOOKING INTO HIM VERY     

169
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,326
SERIOUSLY.                      
BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY,  

170
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,763
VERY SICK INDIVIDUAL.           
>> A LOT OF THORNY POLITICAL    

171
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,299
ISSUES LIE AHEAD.               
DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT GUN 

172
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,268
CONTROL.                        
A BILL IN CONGRESS THAT APPEARS 

173
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:42,974
TO HAVE BEEN SHELVED FOR NOW    
THAT MAKES SILENCERS ILLEGAL.   

174
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,843
I ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HIS 
POSITION.                       

175
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,012
HE SAID WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT   
LATER.                          

176
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,347
>> Shepard: THANK YOU, JOHN.    
IN PUERTO RICO, SOME BUSINESSES 

177
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,084
ARE STARTING TO REOPEN.         
AS WE HEARD, MANY AREAS OF THE  

178
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:57,322
ISLAND ARE STILL DEVASTATED AND 
IN NEED OF SO MUCH HELP.        

179
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,993
SOME FAMOUS PUERTO RICANS ARE   
CHIPPING IN.                    

180
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,262
GERALDO RIVERA REPORTS FROM     
SAN JUAN.                       

181
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:09,167
>> SHEP, PUERTO RICO IS SLOWLY  
GETTING BACK ON ITS FEET.       

182
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,805
A LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY.        
95% OF THE PEOPLE ARE STILL     

183
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:17,509
WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER.       
EVEN HERE ON TOURIST STRIP.     

184
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,311
HALF THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE      
RUNNING WATER AND A THIRD OF    

185
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,147
THEM HAVE ANY KIND OF CELL      
SERVICE OR INTERNET.            

186
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,016
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM, NO  
COMMUNICATIONS.                 

187
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,986
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS       
UNDERREPORTED IS HOW THE PUERTO 

188
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,023
RICAN FAMILY, THE EXTENDED      
FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, RELATIVES AND

HELP PEOPLE.

NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OTHER    
VOLUNTEERS BRINGING AID AND

194
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,649

THESE ARE DONATIONS THAT CAME   

195
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,151

WE'RE GOING OUT TODAY TO TAKE   

196
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,621
CARE OF THEM.

OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE   

198
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,993
DIVERTED BY THE AWFUL TRAGEDY IN
LAS VEGAS.                      

199
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,831
THE FOLKS ARE DELIGHTED THAT HE

NEVADA ON WEDNESDAY.            

201
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,737
THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF      
LOOTING HERE IN PUERTO RICO.    

202
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,507
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT         
ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIALS, THE 

203
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,744
CRIME RATE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS 
IT WAS.                         

204
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,680
THOSE REPORTS ARE EXAGGERATED.  
WHAT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED IS HOW

205
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:33,585
THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE ARE     
COMING TOGETHER TO HELP EACH    

206
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,354

>> Shepard: THANKS, GERALDO.    

208
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:45,830
BETWEEN THE CRISIS IN PUERTO    
RICO AND THE MASSACRE IN        

209
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,966
LAS VEGAS, THE PRESIDENT IS PUT 
TO A TEST.

RESPONSE TO HURRICANE MARIA.    

213
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:05,663
AT LEAST THE LOCAL MAYOR DID AND
SOME OTHERS.                    

214
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,433
PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR HAS      
PRAISED THE TRUMP               

215
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:13,538

SAN JUAN IS COMING ALONG WELL.  
SOME OTHERS ARE NOT.            

218
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:25,283

219
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,887
SITUATION, WHAT YOU SAW TODAY IS
THE PRESIDENT TRAVELED THERE AND

220
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,291
TRIED TO BEST SPIN FORWARD ON   
WHAT HIS ADMINISTRATION'S       

221
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,527
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SO FAR.       
EVEN AS HE'S GOTTEN TO THIS     

222
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,030
FIGHT WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS      
THERE.                          

223
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,568
A LOT OF THIS SEEMED TO BE ABOUT

HIMSELF AND HIS WHITE HOUSE AND 
HOW THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR IN    

225
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,708
MANAGING THIS CRISIS.

PRESS AVAILABILITY AND PHOTO    
OPPORTUNITY THERE UNLIKE ANY    

227
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,052
I'VE SEEN WITH PREVIOUS         
PRESIDENTS AT DISASTERS.        

228
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,388
>> ABSOLUTELY.                  
YOU GOT THE SENSE THAT THE      

229
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:08,126
PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO PUT ON A
SHOW HERE AND TRYING TO         

230
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,329
ADVERTISE HIMSELF AND WHAT HE'S 
DONE AND DEFEND HIMSELF AND HIS

00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,465
ADMINISTRATION.

SEE WITH THIS TRIP THAT WILL    

233
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:24,809

THIS SQUEAK SPOTLIGHTS A ROLE   

234
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,112
THAT TRUMP HADN'T NECESSARILY   
EXPECTED TO PLAY WHEN HE FIRST  

235
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,382
RAN FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH IS THAT
OF CONSOLER IN CHIEF.           

236
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,752
THAT OF A LEADER THAT IS COMING 
TO THE COMFORT --               

237
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,722
>> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE 
WOULDN'T EXPECT TO DO THAT.     

238
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,924
EVERY PRESIDENT FOREVER HAS HAD 
TO DO THAT.                     

239
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,027
LOOK HOW GREAT RONALD REAGAN WAS
AT IT ON THE HEELS OF THE       

240
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,930
CHALLENGER DISASTER.            
EACH PRESIDENT SINCE THEN HAS   

241
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,900
HAD A SHINING MOMENT IN TIMES OF
NEED, I WOULD SAY.              

242
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,502
>> ABSOLUTELY.                  
AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER.       

243
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,838
YOU'RE SEEING A PRESIDENT THAT  
CAMPAIGNED ON THE IDEA THAT HE  

244
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:58,810
WAS GOING TO BE A STRONG MAN    
LIKE FIGURE, A FIGURE OF        

245
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,112
STRENGTH.                       
HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT HE    

246
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:05,083
DIDN'T REALLY CAMPAIGN ON.      
>> Shepard: ALEX, HAVE TO CUT IT

247
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,117
SHORT.                          
THERE'S NEW INFORMATION COMING  

248
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,921
IN TO FOX NEWS ABOUT THE        
INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS

249
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,990
MASSACRE, INCLUDING WORD THAT   
THE FEDS HAVE TALKED WITH AN    

250
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,794
IMMEDIATE RELATIVE OF THE       
GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.            

251
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:22,433
WE HAVE BRAND NEW DETAILS.      
OUR CHIEF INTELLIGENCE          

252
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,736
CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE
JUST PULLED THEM TOGETHER.      

253
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,537
LIVE TO HER NEXT.               

254
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,677
      KEEPING ME FROM THE       
      THINGS I LOVE TO DO.      

255
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,412
      TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR,      

256
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,082
   AND CALL                     
   844-214-2424.                

257
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,286
     I just saved thousands     
 on my loan at LendingTree.com. 

258
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:45,306
 In less than a minute, I found 
out how much home I can afford. 

259
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,958
 I like how you shop for loans  

260
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,193
        the same way you        
    shop for flights online.    

261
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,795
I didn't realize at LendingTree 

262
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,131
       you can save money       
  on almost any sort of loan.   

263
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:57,135
 I consolidated my credit card  
   debt with a personal loan.   

264
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,539
   I found a new credit card    
with 0% interest for 15 months. 

265
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,809
    You just shop, compare,     
  and save. And it's all free.  

266
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,644
  Go to LendingTree right now   

267
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,513
       and start saving.

307
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,973
A U.S. GOVERNMENT SOURCE SAYS

308
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,543

GIRLFRIEND AND WE HAVE JUST     

309
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,714

THE SHOOTER WORKED AS A LETTER  

310
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:03,321
CARRIER AND AN IRS AGENT        
SEPARATELY FOR A TOTAL OF A

KATHERINE?                      

314
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,762
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS    
INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY  

315
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,932
WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT     
PRODUCER, JAKE GIBSON.          

316
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,803
WE CONFIRMED THROUGH A U.S.

THIS RELATIVE SAID TO THE FBI   
THAT THEY FOUND PADDOCK UNSTABLE

320
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,013
AND HE MADE THEM UNCOMFORTABLE. 
FBI OFFICIALS DECLINED TO

00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:37,955
COMMENT ON THIS INTERVIEW ONE   
WAY OR THE OTHER TO FOX NEWS    

322
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,493
EARLIER TODAY.                  
AND THE FBI RAN PADDOCK THROUGH 

323
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,795
THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM.            
WE'RE TOLD IT WILL TAKE A DAY OR

324
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,399
TWO TO PROCESS HIS RECORD.      
THE FBI INDICATED IN CONNECTION 

325
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:53,037
TO TERROR WAS MADE BEFORE THE   
FULL ANALYSIS OF HIS ELECTRONICS

326
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,272
WAS COMPLETE, SHEP.             
>> Shepard: CATHERINE, WHAT DO  

327
00:22:55,407 --> 00:23:00,277
WE KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY THAT    
THIS MURDERER SENT OVERSEAS     

328
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:04,949
PRIOR TO THE MASSACRE?          
>> INVESTIGATORS HAVE DISCOVERED

329
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,719
THAT PADDOCK SENT TENS OF       
THOUSANDS OVERSEAS AND MAY HAVE 

330
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,855
BEEN TO THE GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU 
DANLEY.                         

331
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,291
THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.    
THEY THINK IT WAS TO THE        

332
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:18,596
PHILIPPINES BUT THERE'S         
CONFUSION OVER HER LOCATION AND 

333
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,768
WHETHER SHE'S IN JAPAN.         
HE SEND A LOT OF MONEY OVERSEAS 

334
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,737
BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND         
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO     

335
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:30,141
DETERMINE IF IT WENT TO THIS    
GIRLFRIEND OR SOMEONE ASSOCIATED

336
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,577
WITH HER, SHEP.                 
>> Shepard: CATHERINE A LOT OF  

337
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,781
GAPS IN THE STORY OF THIS MAN.  
AUTHORITIES SAY IT'S SO RARE TO 

338
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,816
HAVE A SHOOTING WITHOUT A       
MOTIVE.                         

339
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,520
SOMETHING THEY HAVE NOT FOUND.  
>> EVERYONE I SPEAK TO ABOUT    

340
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:49,293
THIS CASE, SHEP, TALKS ABOUT IT 
AS BEING AN ANOMALY.            

341
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,596
YOU KNOW FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE   
COVERING THESE EVENTS, THAT     

342
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,499
USUALLY WITHIN 24 HOURS YOU HAVE
A GOOD SENSE OF THE SHOOTER AND 

343
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,936
A LIKELY MOTIVATION.            
THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF PRESENCE 

344
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,039
ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR THEY HAVE    
BEEN ON BLOGS WRITING ABOUT     

345
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,776
THEIR POINT OF VIEW.            
THIS GUY IS REALLY A GHOST WHEN 

346
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,513
IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND NO 
ONE HAS COME FORWARD IN A VERY  

347
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,817
PUBLIC WAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT   
HIS MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN ON 

348
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,319
THE IDEOLOGY.                   
BUT WHAT IS CLEAR FROM THE SCOPE

349
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,590
OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE       
LOCATIONS, THE FIREPOWER, THE   

350
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,293
AMMUNITION, ALL OF THESE THINGS 
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST  

351
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,863
24 HOURS IS THAT IT TOOK        
SIGNIFICANT PREMEDDATION, RIGHT?

352
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,599
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN 
THROW TOGETHER ON SHORT NOTICE. 

353
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:30,234
>> Shepard: NOT THIS CLEARLY.   
>> YEAH.                        

354
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,535
>> Shepard: NICE TO TALK WITH   
YOU.                            

355
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,636
THANK YOU.                      
>> YOU BET.                     

356
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:37,174
>> Shepard: WE'LL BE BACK WITH A
LOOK AT TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS  

357
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,143
COURT VERDICTS IN AMERICAN      
HISTORY AND BOTH OF THEM        

358
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,145
HAPPENED ON THIS DAY.
