"FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>>> WE ARE LIVE AT FOX REPORT.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
AMERICAN WAR SHIPS SITTING NOT

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
FAR FROM SYRIA.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT SYRIA IS

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
OWN PEOPLE, FROM A SENIOR OBAMA

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
IS IT TIME TO FIRE AWAY?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
>> I CERTAINLY WOULD DO CRUISE

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
MISSILE STRIKES.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, WITHOUT

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
HAVING AMERICANS IN HARM'S WAY.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
>> IF THE MILITARY ADVISES, THIS

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
COULD DESTROY THE CHEMICAL

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
WEAPON STOCKPILE, I WOULD

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
SUPPORT THAT.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000

INTERVENTION AGAINST THE ASSAD

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
REGIME.
ALSO BUGGING, THE UNITED

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
NATIONS?
A NEW REPORT SAYS AMERICA'S SPY

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
AGENCY, THE NSA, TARGETED U.N.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
HEADQUARTERS.

IN MINUTES, WHAT THE LATEST

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE NSA

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
COULD MEAN FOR WASHINGTON AND

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
OUR ALLIES.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AND WHEN YOU RUN WITH THE BULLS,

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
YOU WANT TO DODGE THE HORNS.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DANGER

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
LURKING IN AMERICA'S NEWEST PAST

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
TIME, THE DRONES OVER THE SAND.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
NO REALLY, YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
FOR THOSE, TOO, APPARENTLY.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I AM HARRIS FAULKNER.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000

SPOKEN ABOUT SYRIA.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
AS YOU KNOW, WORLD GOVERNMENTS,

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
INCLUDING OUR OWN, ARE PONDERING

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
IN SYRIA CREATING MILLIONS OF

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
REFUGEES, PUTTING PRESSURE ON

NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
POTENTIALLY PUNCHING HOLES IN AN

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
ALREADY FRAGILE IMBALANCE THERE.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
IT COULD BE THE OPENING FOR

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
TERRORISTS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
CHAOS IN SYRIA.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
HELP SYRIA END THE WAR.

60

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000

SYRIA'S CAPITAL CITY, KILLING

THE U.N. ANNOUNCING SYRIA IS

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CLAIMING IT WILL ALLOW A TEAM OF

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
INSPECTORS TO EXAMINE THE SITE.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THAT'S SET TO BEGIN TOMORROW.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A SENIOR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
OFFICIAL SAYING THERE'S VERY

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000

SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE,

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000

TODAY.
>> I THINK WE WILL RESPOND IN A

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SURGICAL WAY AND I HOPE THE

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
PRESIDENT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AUTHORIZATION FROM CONGRESS TO

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
DO SOMETHING IN A VERY SURGICAL

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
AND PROPORTIONAL WAY, SOMETHING

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THAT GETS THEIR ATTENTION, THAT

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
CAUSES THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
WE HAVE TO VERIFY IT WAS

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
DIRECTED BY THE ASSAD REGIME.

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD AN

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
INTERNATIONAL COALITION AND THAT

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IS NECESSARY TO TAKE FURTHER

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
STEPS IN SYRIA, ALSO WILL HELP

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
DIFFUSE SOME OF THE COUNTRIES

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
LIKE IRAN, RUSSIA, TRYING TO

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
PAWN THIS OFF ON THE REBELS.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000

ABOUT DIFFUSING COUNTRIES LIKE

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
IRAN AND HE MENTIONED RUSSIA,

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
LONG TIME ALLY OF THE SYRIAN

116
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
PRESIDENT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
SAYS ANY BILATERAL ACTIONS THAT

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
BYPASSES UNITED NATIONS WOULD

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000

BUT NO WORD ON PLANS FOR THE

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SHIPS.
THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS A QUICK

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
INTERVENTION WOULD BE

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
PROBLEMATIC, WHILE SOME

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
LAWMAKERS THINK LEADERS SHOULD
BE ACTING OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
CAUTION, OTHERS SAY THERE SHOULD

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
BE MORE ACTIVITY.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR WAR

135

SHIPS, AGAIN, OFF THE COAST OF

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
SYRIA, MISSILES ARE AN OPTION TO

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
TRY TO TAKE OUT THE CHEMICAL

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
STOCK PILES.

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
>> JUST STANDING OFF, THROWING A

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
FEW MISSILES, DROPPING A FEW

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BOMBS ON KEY TARGETS ARE WHAT WE

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
IN THE MILITARY CALL A FEEL GOOD

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
BOMBING.
IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ABILITY TO SAY HE'S DONE

145
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
SOMETHING, PERHAPS SOME IN

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000

147
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
TERMS OF DEGRADING THE ABILITY

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OF THE SYRIAN ARMY TO ATTACK ITS

149
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OWN PEOPLE IN THIS CIVIL WAR, I

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
DON'T THINK MUCH IS GOING TO

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
COME OUT OF IT.

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000

UPGRADED, WARRANTS SERIOUS

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
RESPONSE.
TWO LEADERS AGREE ALL OPTIONS TO

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THE ALLEGED USE OF CHEMICAL

BE TOO LATE TO FIND ANYTHING.

HIDE, WOULD HAVE LET THEM IN

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
EVIDENCE OF THAT ATTACK MAY BE

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THREATS MEAN AND WHETHER THEY

202
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WOULD ACTUALLY DETER US MAKING A

IT IS NOW THE SIZE OF THE CITY

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
JUST OVERNIGHT IT GREW BY MORE

216
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000

00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
REALLY NEEDED.

228
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000

229
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000

AS YOU MAY KNOW.

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000

MASSIVE VOLUME OF SMOKE.

IT BURST OUT IN THE PAST FEW

251
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
MOMENTS.

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
WE WERE SEEING THE ORANGE GLOW

253
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
OF THE FIRE ON THE EDGE OF THE

254
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000

THIS IS THE MOMENT THE FIRE

255
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
CRUCIAL HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY

256
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
DREADING THE PAST 48 HOURS.

THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING MAKE OR

CITY FROM THE FIRE AS IT COMES

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
IN.
THE FIRE IS BURNING TWO

261
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
DIFFERENT COLORS, WHITE IS FUEL,

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
SO HOT.

263
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THE GREEN FUEL IS PUTTING BLACK

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HAD A MASSIVE AIR TANKER, FOUR

PROP PLANE LOOKING TO SEE WHERE

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
IT SHOULD PUT RETARDANT.

ABOUT 16,000 HOMES HERE OR

SUNNYVALE AND PALO ALTO ARE

275
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
LOOKING AT THAT COLUMN OF SMOKE,

276
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
EXTREMELY WORRIED.

277
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A FEW COLLEAGUES MOMENTS BEFORE

278
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
WE CAME ON AIR LEFT IN THE FIRE

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
TRUCK, HEADED IN THEIR

280
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
DIRECTION.
YOU KNOW AN EXTRA 2,000

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
FIREFIGHTERS WERE BROUGHT IN

282
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
YESTERDAY TO PROTECT THIS TOWN.

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
ALMOST 8 FIREFIGHTERS PER HOME.

284
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
WITH EASTERLY WINDS COMING IN

285
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
AND PUSHING IN THIS DIRECTION,

286
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THIS REALLY IS NOT WHAT THEY

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
WANTED TO SEE.

288
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
BUT THEY KNEW WINDS WOULD BE A

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
RISK, GOING ANYTHING FROM 10 TO

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
40 MILES PER HOUR GOING OVER THE

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
HILLSIDE.

292
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THAT KIND OF WIND GUARANTEES HOW

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
MANY LINES THEY CREATE, THE FIRE

294
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
CAN JUMP THE LINES AND THAT WILL

295
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
BE DEVASTATING FOR THE TOWN.

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
BACK TO YOU.

297
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I KNEW FROM MY NOTES YOU WOULD

300
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
BE LIVE NEAR IT.

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
YOU'RE FAIRLY CLOSE TO IT.

302
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
CAN YOU SMELL THE SMOKE?

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
>> OH, YES.

304
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
IT HAS BEEN THICK THROUGH THE

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
DAY.
YOU CAN FEEL IT ON THE BACK OF

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
OUR THROAT, COATING LIKE A

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
POWDER, IN OUR NOSTRILS.

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT.

309
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
BLUE SKY ABOVE IT ONE SIDE AND

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SMOKE KEEPS WASPING IN.

311
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I HAVE TO SAY THIS DOES NOT LOOK

312
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
GOOD FOR THE TOWN.

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THERE'S ALREADY ADVISORY,

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
EVACUATION.

315
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
LOOKS LIKE ANY TIME SOON A

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
MANDATORY EVACUATION.

317
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
WE WERE TIPPED OFF BY CAL FIRE

318
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
SAYING THAT PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN

319
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
TODAY.

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
LOOKING AT THE SIZE AND THE RACE

321
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
IT IS APPROACHING, I WOULDN'T BE

322
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
SURPRISED IF EVACUATION WAS PUT

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
IN IN MINUTES, CERTAINLY IN A

324
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
MATTER OF HOURS.

325

>> THAT WILL EFFECT EVERYBODY,

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
INCLUDING YOU.

EXACTLY, THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
DIVERT IT?

TRY TO DIRECT IT NORTH AND EAST,

338
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
AWAY FROM THE POPULATED AREAS.

339
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000

KNOW THE DIRECTION THE FIRE WILL

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
GO IN.

741

TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT ALL YOUR SYMPTOMS.

742
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000

A VIETNAM WAR VETERAN AND

747
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
SOMETHING CLOSE TO HIS HEART.

748
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
IN 1968, U.S. MARINE LAN EE

749
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
MARTIN SON WAS SEVERELY INJURED

750
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
IN A MINE FIELD IN VIETNAM.

751
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
SIX FELLOW MARINES WERE KILLED.

752
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
DURING HIS LONG ROAD TO

753
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
RECOVERY, HIS DOG TAGS WERE

754
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
SOMEHOW LOST.

TAGS ARE BACK IN HIS POSSESSION.

HIM, POST IT BACK TO HIM IN THE

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I NEVER DREAMED THAT THIS WHOLE

767
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
THING WOULD END UP LIKE THIS.

768
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
>> IT WAS VERY OVERWHELMING.

769
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY.

770
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
JUST A PIECE OF ALUMINUM, BUT I

771
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
HAD TO HAVE IT A LONG TIME.

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000

A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS

777
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT CHEMICAL

778
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
WEAPONS WERE USED BY THE SYRIAN

779
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
REGIME AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.

780
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
HUNDREDS DIED IN LAST WEEK'S

781
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
ATTACK.

782
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
TODAY, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT

783
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
CLAIMED THEY WILL ALLOW U.N.

784
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
INSPECTORS TO LOOK AT THE SITE

785
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
IT HAPPENED.

786
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY AT THIS POINT
IT IS PROBABLY TOO LATE.

787
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000

AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON, FORMER

793
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. AND FOX

794
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

795
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
DO YOU WAIT FOR THE INSPECTORS

796
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
TO TELL US WHAT THEY FOUND THERE

797
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
AT THE DEATH SITE OR IS THE

798
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
WHITE HOUSE STALLING FOR TIME TO

799
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
MAKE A DECISION?

800
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
>> I DON'T THINK THE U.N.

801
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
INSPECTORS WILL FIND MUCH OF

802
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
ANYTHING.

803
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THE SYRIAN REGIME PROBABLY

804
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
CLEANED UP THE SITES, MADE THEM

805
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
MBIGUOUS THAT
NOBODY CAN TELL WHO USE THE

806
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

807
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THEY MAY HAVE HAD RUSSIAN

808
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT.

809
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I THINK THE SYRIANS THOUGHT THEY

810
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
WERE BUYING TIME AND MAY YET,

811
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
BUT THE RHETORIC FROM THE WHITE

812
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
HOUSE IS UNDOUBTEDLY STEPPED UP.

813
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
OF COURSE, WE HAVE BEEN DOWN

814
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
THAT ROAD BEFORE AS WELL.

815
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM FOR THE

816
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
UNITED STATES IS THAT THE

817
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
ADMINISTRATION IS REACTING MORE

818
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
OUT OF POLITICAL CONCERN THAN

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
FROM STRATEGIC THINKING.

820
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THE PRESIDENT LOOKED VERY

821
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
FOOLISH, VERY WEAK SIX MONTHS

822
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
AGO WHEN CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE

823
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
FIRST REPORTED USED ON A LARGE

824
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
SCALE, CROSSING THE RED LINE

825
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF DREW

826
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
A YEAR AGO AND THE PRESIDENT DID

827
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
NOTHING.
NOW YOU HAVE AN EVEN MORE

828
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
EGREGIOUS USE OF CHEMICAL

829
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
WEAPONS AND HE THINKS HE NEEDS

830
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
TO DO SOMETHING, BUT HE CLEARLY

831
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT OR FOR WHAT

832
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
PURPOSE.

833
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
>> THE PROBLEM IS THE RED LINE

834
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
IS THAT IT IS RED, FEW PEOPLE

835
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
WILL EVER FORGET IT.

836
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
TODAY, AMBASSADOR RAND ISSUED

837
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
THE FIRST OF TWO THREATS WE

838
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
HEARD, THE OTHER COMING FROM

839
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
RUSSIA, GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT.

840
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
IRAN SAID WE BETTER NOT TOUCH

841
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
SYRIA, PARAPHRASING IT.

842
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SHOULD THAT BE DETERRENT FOR US?

843
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
>> NO, THE SYRIANS THINK

844
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS WEAK AND ARE

845
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
TRYING TO BULLY HIM.

846
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
IN THIS CONTEXT IT WILL HAVE THE

847
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
OPPOSITE EFFECT AND CONVINCE HIM

848
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
HE HAS TO DO SOMETHING, LOB A

849
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
COUPLE CRUISE MISSILES OR MORE

850
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
INTO SYRIA TO PROVE HE HAS,

851
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
QUOTE, UNQUOTE, DONE SOMETHING.

852
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS WHAT TO

853
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
DO ABOUT IRAN.

854
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
LET'S FACE IT, THE ASSAD REGIME

855
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AFTER TWO YEARS OF CONFLICT

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
WOULD NOT BE IN POWER IF IT WERE

857
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
NOT FOR RUSSIA AND IRAN, AND

858
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
PRIMARILY IRAN.

859
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
LOOKING AT SYRIA IS LOOKING AS

860
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
TRAGIC AS IT IS IS LOOKING IN A

861
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
STRATEGIC SENSE AT A SECONDARY

862
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
ISSUE.
THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE REGIME

863
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
IN IRAN.

864
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
THAT'S WHERE WE OUGHT TO DIRECT

865
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
OUR ATTENTION.

866
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
>> LET'S TALK ON THE SUBJECT

867
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
MATTER OF OTHER COUNTRIES

868
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ISSUING THREATS TO AMERICA,

869
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
SHOULD IT GET INVOLVED OUTSIDE

870
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
THE BOUNDS OF THE UNITED

871
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
NATIONS.
NO ONE SAID WE WOULD DO THAT.

872
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
BUT RUSSIA TODAY ISSUING A

873
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
WARNING THAT THERE WOULD BE
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES IN THAT

874
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
REGION TO THE SECURITY IN THE

875
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
MIDDLE EAST, IF WE SHOULD

876
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
SUDDENLY USE OUR MILITARY WITH

877
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
REGARD TO SYRIA.

878
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
IN FACT, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

879
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
FROM A LAWMAKER, MIKE McCALL,

880
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
REPUBLICAN OUT OF TEXAS, WHO

881
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
TALKS ABOUT THAT TENUOUS

882
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH RUSSIA.

883
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
LET'S WATCH THAT AND THEN WE'LL

884
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
TALK MORE.

885
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
>> THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

886
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
WHITE HOUSE AND THE PUTIN

887
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ADMINISTRATION IS SO BAD AND

888
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
LACKS SO MUCH CREDIBILITY THAT I

889
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

890
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST.

891
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I BELIEVE THE RUGS DON'T WANT

892
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED, AS DOES

893
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
THE UNITED STATES, SO WE DO HAVE

894
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
AN OPPORTUNITY, I HOPE THE

895
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO TAKE

896
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
ADVANTAGE OF.

897
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
>> AND THE COULD YOU TELL

898
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN THERE.

899
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
CURIOUS OF YOUR THOUGHTS.

900
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
>> I THINK THEY THINK OBAMA IS

901
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
WEAK AND CAN BULLY HIM, PUSHING

902
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
ON ONE OTHER BUTTON THAT THE

903
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
PRESIDENT HIGHLIGHTED LAST WEEK

904
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
WHEN HE WONDERED WHAT HIS

905
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY WAS TO

906
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
LAUNCH MILITARY ACTION.

907
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
AND THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE

908
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL WHERE

909
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
RUSSIA HAS A VETO.

910
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD CARE ONE

911
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
WIT WHETHER WE HAVE A SECURITY

912
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
COUNCIL RESOLUTION OR NOT.

913
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
THIS IS THINKING IN A EUROPEAN

914
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
WAY, WHO HAS AUTHORIZED ME TO DO

915
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THIS, AS OPPOSED TO THINKING IN

916
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WAY,

917
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WHO IS PROHIBITING ME FROM DOING

918
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THIS.

919
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
WHILE I THINK WE OUGHT TO

920
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
DISREGARD IT, I THINK THE

921
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
RUSSIANS KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S

922
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
PSYCHOLOGY AND THAT'S WHAT

923
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO EFFECT.

924
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
>> CHAT ROOMS, THEY'RE SAYING

925
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
OUR NATION SHOULDN'T BE

926
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
INVOLVED, SOME OF THEM.

927
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
YOU ALSO SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE

928
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
INVOLVED THERE THE WAY WE ARE,

929
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SYRIA IS A SECONDARY ISSUE.

930
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> AS I SAID, THE ASSAD REGIME

931
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
WOULD NOT BE IN POWER BUT FOR

932
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
IRAN, AND WHILE PEOPLE SAY THIS

933
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN DEFEAT

934
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
IRAN, THIS IS EFFECTIVELY MUCH

935
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
LESS IMPORTANT THAN IRAN'S

936
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

937
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING

938
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
RIGHT NOW.

939
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T ACT

940
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
WITH MASSIVE FORCE IN SYRIA, IF

941
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
IT IS JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST

942
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
TO THE ASSAD REGIME, WHICH MANY

943
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
ARE PREDICTING, I THINK THE

944
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
LESSON IRAN DRAWS FROM THAT WE

945
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
BETTER GET OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS

946
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
CAPABILITY IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE

947
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
THEN WE WILL BE IMMUNE TO AN

948
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
AMERICAN SLAP ON THE WRIST.

949
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE

950
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
PRESIDENT DOES USE MASSIVE FORCE

951
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF FORCES

952
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF, IT COULD

953
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
WELL RESULT IN THE OPPOSITION

954
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
TAKING POWER, WHICH I DON'T

955
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THINK IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST

956
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
EITHER.

957
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THAT'S WHY I STRESS I DON'T

958
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HIS

959
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
OWN MIND.
I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HIS

960
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
STRATEGY IS.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THE

961
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
AGONIZING IS ABOUT.

962
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
>> VERY INTERESTING.

963
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
YOU PAINT SUCH DIFFERENT

964
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
SCENARIOS THERE.
AND I'LL CHANGE TOPICS JUST

965
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
SLIGHTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK

966
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS.

967
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
SAMANTHA POWER HAS TAKEN YOUR

968
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
OLD POST AS U.S. AMBASSADOR AT

969
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
THE U.N.

970
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
SHE WAS AWAY FOR PERSONAL

971
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
REASONS WE READ THIS WEEK,

972
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
MISSED THAT VERY IMPORTANT

973
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
EMERGENCY MEETING AT THE UNITED

974
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
NATIONS.
IT WAS ON SYRIA.

975
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
HOW UNUSUAL IS IT THAT THE

976
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
AMBASSADOR WOULD MISS A MEETING

977
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
LIKE THAT?
>> WELL, I THINK IT IS OKAY FOR

978
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
PEOPLE TO TAKE VACATIONS.

979
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I THINK THAT'S FINE.

980
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I DIDN'T TAKE A VACATION WHEN I

981
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF

982
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
AUGUST OF 2005, BUT MAYBE I'M A

983
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
WORKAHOLIC.

984
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I THINK SHE WILL BE BACK IN TIME

985
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS,

986
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
GIVEN THAT PUBLICITY.

987
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
>> SO NO SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS

988
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
OF HOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD OR

989
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

990
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000

UNITED NATIONS ANYWAY.
SHE PROBABLY COULD STAY IN

993
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
IRELAND ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE.

994
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
>> THAT IS BLUNT.

995
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

996
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.
CHANGING TOPICS TO NEW

997
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
INFORMATION WE HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT

998
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
THE NSA SPYING, NOT JUST ON

999
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
MILLIONS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS AS

1000
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
WE LEARNED ABOUT FROM EDWARD

1001
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
SNOWDEN, THE U.S. CONTRACTOR NOW

1002
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
A FUGITIVE INSIDE RUSSIA, BUT

1003
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
THE UNITED NATIONS, THAT THEY

1004
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
WERE BEING BUGGED.

1005
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
UP TO 80 EMBASSIES AROUND THE

1006
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
WORLD.
THAT'S GOT TO POSE SOME QUESTION

1007
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I WOULD IMAGINE THE MINDS OF OUR

1008
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
ALLIES.
YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT?

1009
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>> THE DER SPIEGEL ARTICLE SAYS

1010
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ESPIONAGE AGAINST THE UNITED

1011

NATIONS TOOK PLACE IN 2012,

1012
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
WHICH I FIND DELICIOUSLY IRONIC

1013
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS

1014
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
SPYING ON THE UNITED NATIONS.

1015
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
HERE IS WHAT I THINK.

1016
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
ANY GATHERING OF FOREIGNERS IS A

1017
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
LEGITIMATE TARGET FOR AMERICAN

1018
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
ESPIONAGE, UNLESS WE HAVE

1019
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
AGREEMENT THAT PRECLUDES US FROM

1020
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
DOING IT.
AND ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

1021
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
ABSENT SUCH AN AGREEMENT THAT

1022
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
DOESN'T THINK WE MAY BE SPYING

1023
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
ON THEM DOESN'T LIVE IN THE REAL

1024
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000

1025
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, DOESN'T

1026
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
BOTHER ME AT ALL.

1027
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I THINK THIS SHOWS A FUNDAMENTAL

1028
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
POINT THAT SNOWDEN AND HIS MEDIA

1029
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
FRIENDS ARE TRYING TO PROVE.

1030
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
NOT TO AWAKEN AMERICANS ABOUT

1031
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY

1032
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
BUT TO HURT THE UNITED STATES

1033
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
INTERNATIONALLY.
WHILE MOST AMERICANS COULDN'T

1034
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
CARE LESS IF WE'RE SPYING ON THE

1035
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
U.N., IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES,

1036
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THAT'S ALMOST SACK RIL AJ.

1037
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000

1453
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE TO DO

1454
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
WITH BULLS.

1455
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
IT DIDN'T.

1456
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
A DRONE WITH VIDEO CAMERAS TO

1457

HIS SIGNATURE LEGISLATION

1483
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
BROKEN, THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES

1484
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
TO BLAME REPUBLICANS.

1485
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
>> THE ONE UNIFYING PRINCIPLE IN

1486
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THE

1487
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
MOMENT IS MAKING SURE THAT 30

1488
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
MILLION PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HEALTH

1489
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
CARE.
>> BUT IT IS NOT JUST THE GOP

1490
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000

>> I'M OF THE BELIEF THE ACA IS

1494
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLEX PIECE

1495
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
OF LEGISLATION EVER PASSED BY

1496
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.

1497
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
>> DEMOCRATS, THE IRS, AND EVEN

1498
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
UNIONS HAVE MAJOR ISSUES WITH

1499
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
OBAMA CARE.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS NO ONE HAS A

1500
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
BETTER PLAN.

1501
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
>> WHAT ARE THE SOLUTION
