PADDOCK AND HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, WHEN THEY CAME

184

TO BUY THE CAR.

185
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
>> MARILOU EVEN WANTED TO GET A

LEXUS, BUT HE WAS LIKE, I'M NOT

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
GOING TO SPEND $10,000 MORE FOR

188
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A CAR THAT'S GOT THE EXACT SAM

>> Reporter: AND WHEN DANLEY

190
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WENT ON A TEST DRIVE, SHE TOLD

191
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THE FEMALE SALESPERSON THAT

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
PADDOCK HAD SAHED VEOMFRR  A

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
TROUBLED MARRIAGE.

194

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
RELATIONSHIP PRIOR TO HIM.

196
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AND HOW HE HAD, YOU KNOW, TURNED

197
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HER LIFE AROUND AND REALLY
HELPED HER OUT.
>> Reporter: DANLEY'S

198
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH PADDOCK HAS

199
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
NOW BECOME A KEY FOCUS OF THE

200
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
INVESTIGATION.

201
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
AGENTS PADDOCK WAS A CARING MAN

202
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WHO SHOWED NO SIGN OF VIOLENCE.

203
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
AND THE FBI ALSO WANTED TO KNOW

204
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
ABOUT THE MORE THAN $100,000

205
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000

208
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
IN ADVANCE OF THE SHOOTING.

209
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
HER LAWYER READ HER STATEMENT.

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
>> I WAS GRATEFUL, BUT HONESTLY,

211
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I WAS WORRIED THAT FIRST, THE

212
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
UNEXPECTED TRIP HOME AND THEN

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
THE MONEY WAS A WAY OF BREAKING

214
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
UP WITH ME.
>> Reporter: FOUR DAYS INTO THE

215
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
INVESTIGATION, THE FBI SAYS IT

216
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
HAS RULED OUT MONEY PROBLEMS AND

217
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
RULED OUT ANY CONNECTION TO
ANARCHIST GROUPS, TO

218
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUPS, TO

MOTIVE.

223
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
BUT AS YOU BEGAN TO POINT OUT
RIGHT THERE, YOU HAVE LEARNED

224
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WHAT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO RULE

225
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000

>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THEY'RE STILL STUMPED, BUT
THEY'RE CERTAIN THEY WILL FIND

227
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OUT A MOTIVE, SOONER OR LATER.

237
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THIS WAS A WELL-PLANNED ATTACK.
NEARLY TWO DOZEN WEAPONS IN HIS

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
HOTEL SUITE, HALF OF THEM

239
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
CONVERTED TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC,

FOUND ON A DOZEN OF THE LAS

BUMP STOCK ATTACHMENTS THAT

269
