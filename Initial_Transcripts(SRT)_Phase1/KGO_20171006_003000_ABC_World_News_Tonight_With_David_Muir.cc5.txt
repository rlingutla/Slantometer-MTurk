[000:03:41;170] STILL FROZEN IN TIME.
[000:03:42;906] IT DOESN'T LOOK SO MUCH LIKE
[000:03:43;773] THERE WAS A CONCERT THERE, BUT

[000:03:52;749] EVIDENCE OF JUST THE ABSOLUTE
[000:03:53;349] CHAOS.
[000:03:54;918] AND TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING

[000:04:26;316] NEARLY 38,000 PEOPLE.
[000:04:28;051] BUT NO EVIDENCE HE TRAVELED TO
[000:04:30;920] BOSTON, EITHER.
[000:04:32;322] INSTEAD, HE STAYED CLOSE TO
[000:04:33;222] HOME, HOLING UP IN ONE OF THE
[000:04:34;257] CASINOS HE KNEW SO WELL, LOOKING
[000:04:35;925] DOWN ON THAT HELPLESS CROWD.
[000:04:38;461] >> SO, LET'S GET TO MATT GUTMAN

[000:07:47;583] MOVEMENT NOW ON THIS IN

[000:07:50;486] THE GROWING CALL TONIGHT TO BAN
[000:07:51;254] OR REGULATE THOSE SO-CALLED BUMP
[000:07:54;357] STOCKS.
[000:07:54;590] THE DEVICE USED BY THE GUNMAN,
[000:07:55;224] ATTACHING IT TO SOME OF HIS

[000:08:20;349] ALLOW A RIFLE TO FIRE LIKE A
[000:08:20;950] MACHINE GUN.

[000:08:46;509] THERE WOULD BE BIPARTISAN
