STUNNED THE WORLD.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
SIX YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA, THERE

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
COULD BE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THAN WHAT MANY HAVE ALREADY

GREAT CARE TO POUR THROUGH THE

IMAGES FIRST, BUT WE WARN YOU,

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THEY'RE STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE.
A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN
AMONG THE VICTIMS.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
SURVIVORS BEING SPRAYED OFF,

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000

APPEARS TO BE A TOXIC GAS.

SUFFERING IN SYRIA.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000

>> THE GAS ATTACKS ARE

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
CONTINUING EVERY DAY AND NO ONE

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
IS DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THIS

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
GAS ATTACK.

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
>> Reporter: THIS ATTACK

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
FOLLOWING TWO CHLORINE GAS

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
ATTACKS OVER THE PAST WEEK.
WHILE THIS LOCAL ACTIVIST

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
REPORTED FROM ONE OF THOSE

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
HOSPITALS, IT WAS HIT WITH

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
ANOTHER AIRSTRIKE.

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THE

83
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
ATTACK "REPREHENSIBLE" AND SAID

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
IT "CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
CIVILIZED WORLD."

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
BUT THE STATEMENT ALSO TOOK AIM

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
"THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME ARE A

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAST

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS AND

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
IRRESOLUTION."

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THAT'S A REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OBAMA'S FAILURE TO PUNISH SYRIA

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
FOR CROSSING THE SO-CALLED RED

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
LINE WHEN IT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN 2013.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA IN FACT BOASTED

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
THAT HE HAD WORKED OUT AN

98
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA AND SYRIA

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
TO GET RID OF ASSAD'S CHEMICAL

100
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WEAPONS.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
>> ASSAD GAVE UP HIS CHEMICAL

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
WEAPONS.

103
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THAT'S NOT SPECULATION ON OUR
PART.

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
>> Reporter: TRAGICALLY, THAT

105
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
WAS NOT TRUE.

106
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
AT LEAST SOME OF THE WEAPONS
REMAINED.

107
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL

109
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
HOLD ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING

110
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT TODAY

112
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
BUT HE DID SAY THIS IN A SPEECH

113
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
ON THE ECONOMY.
>> I'M NOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
BE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD.

115
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.

>> MR. SECRETARY, ANY COMMENT ON

THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA?

123
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> BASHAR AL ASSAD SHOULD STILL

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
BE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA?

125
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000

FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SECRETARY TILLERSON DID NOT TAKE

139
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
QUESTIONS ON THIS TODAY, BUT HE

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN TO HARSHER

141
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
LINE IN A STATEMENT TODAY THAN

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
JUST LAST WEEK?

A WRITTEN STATEMENT WHERE HE

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
CONDEMNED ASSAD.

146
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
REFERRING TO HIS BRUTAL,

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
UNABASHED BARBARISM.

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
AND HIS FUNDAMENTAL DISREGARD

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
FOR HUMAN DECENCY.
AND CALLED OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN,

150

SAYING THEY BEAR GREAT MORAL

151
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS.

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WILL DO ABOUT IT

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
AND WHETHER THEY NOW WANT ASSAD

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000

But then I realized there was.

570

So, I finally broke the
silence with my doctor

571
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
about what I was experiencing.

572
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He said HUMIRA is
for people like me

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
who have tried
other medications

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
but still experience
the symptoms

575
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
of moderate to severe
Crohn's disease.

576
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
In clinical studies, the
majority of patients on HUMIRA

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
saw significant
symptom relief.

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And many achieved remission.

579
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
HUMIRA can lower your
ability to fight infections,

580
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
including tuberculosis.

heart failure.

586
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

587
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Tell your doctor if
you've been to areas

588
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
where certain fungal
infections are common,

589
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000

hepatitis B,

590
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
are prone to infections,

591
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
or have flu-like
symptoms or sores.

592
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't start HUMIRA if
you have an infection.

593
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you're still just
managing your symptoms,

594
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
talk with your
gastroenterologist about HUMIRA.

642
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
