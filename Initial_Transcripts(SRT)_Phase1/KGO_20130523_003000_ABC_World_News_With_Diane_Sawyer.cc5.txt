[000:03:52;665] SERVICE PERSONNEL SERVING HERE
[000:03:54;300] IN THE UK, ARE NOW THE TARGETS.

[000:04:47;987] EARLY THIS MORNING, AUTHORITIES
[000:04:49;555] WERE INTERVIEWING HIM WHEN
[000:04:50;590] MATTERS TURNED VIOLENT.

[000:07:41;360] WORRIED ABOUT TWO OTHER
[000:07:42;028] STUDENTS.

[000:08:01;280] AND HE FINDS HER ALIVE.
[000:08:02;849] >> JOEY!

[000:08:14;026] AND LATE TODAY, AUTHORITIES
[000:08:16;229] ALLOWING US TO BRING HER BACK TO
[000:08:17;830] THAT SCHOOL.
[000:08:19;966] AS WE WALK TOWARD IT, THE FIRST
[000:08:22;068] THING WE NOTICE, THE MANGLED
[000:08:22;802] PLAYGROUND.
[000:08:23;669] >> OH, THERE'S OUR PLAYGROUND.
[000:08:25;738] >> Reporter: THIS IS THE
[000:08:26;405] PLAYGROUND HERE?
[000:08:26;973] >> THIS IS THE PLAYGROUND.
[000:08:33;679] >> Reporter: TEARS FROM THE
[000:08:34;747] TEACHER WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE
[000:08:35;781] WHAT SHE WAS SEEING.
[000:08:37;416] THE FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM BACK
[000:08:38;484] IN THE CORNER THERE, WHERE HER
[000:08:40;052] SON'S TEACHER WAS LYING ON TOP
[000:08:41;120] OF HIM AND THE OTHER CHILDREN,
[000:08:42;188] TO KEEP THEM SAFE.
[000:08:44;323] INCREDIBLE TO THINK HER SON
[000:08:46;425] CRAWLED OUT OF THAT RUBBLE WITH
[000:08:48;027] ALL THOSE FIRST GRADERS, AND
[000:08:49;128] LOOK AT THIS, RIGHT HERE IN THE
[000:08:50;196] MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL, A CAR
[000:08:52;298] LANDING FROM THE PARKING LOT.
[000:08:53;933] JUST BEYOND THAT CAR, SHE TAKES
[000:08:55;001] ME UNDERNEATH THE TWISTED METAL,
[000:08:57;169] DOWN THE HALLWAYS, ALL THAT'S
[000:09:02;241] LEFT OF THE SCHOOL.
[000:09:02;842] AMONG THE ONLY WALL STANDING,
[000:09:03;776] THAT BRICK WALL TO THE BATHROOM
[000:09:04;844] WHERE HER CLASS WAS SAVED.
[000:09:07;547] >> THIS IS WHERE WE WALKED DOWN,
[000:09:08;581] AND I WAS RIGHT HERE.
[000:09:11;217] >> Reporter: FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
[000:09:12;785] WERE HERE TODAY TOURING THE
[000:09:13;853] DAMAGE, AND AGAIN THE QUESTIONS
[000:09:14;921] SURROUNDING THOSE SAFE ROOMS AND
[000:09:15;955] WHY THERE WERE NOT ANY IN EITHER
[000:09:17;023] OF THOSE TWO SCHOOLS.
[000:09:18;591] WE LEARNED IT CAN COST UP TO
[000:09:23;529] $300 A SQUARE FOOT, UP TO A
[000:09:24;764] MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE TO BL
[000:09:26;032] THE SAFE ROOMS, BUT A LOT OF
[000:09:28;000] PARENTS BELIEVE YOU CAN'T PUT A
[000:09:29;268] PRICE TAG ON SAFETY.
[000:09:30;036] THAT CONVERSATION HAS BEGUN.
[000:09:30;903] ONE MORE DISCOVERY I WANTED TO
[000:09:31;671] SHOW YOU FROM INSIDE THAT
[000:09:36;943] SCHOOL.
[000:09:37;410] WE FOUND THIS TODAY.
[000:09:38;010] HER STUDENTS HAD MADE THIS FOR
[000:09:38;811] HER BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING ON
[000:09:39;645] TO MIDDLE SCHOOL.
[000:09:40;746] THEY HAD JUST THREE DAYS LEFT.
