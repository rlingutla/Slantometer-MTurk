EMERGENCY FOR THE CITY OF SAN

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
FRAN, 150 MILES AWAY, BECAUSE

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THE POWER LINES THAT FEED THE

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000

194
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
WE TRAVELED TO THE MASSIVE

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000

OFFICIALS SAY THE SIZE OF THE

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
IT'S THE INTENSITY.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
STILL THERE ARE EVACUATIONS

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
UNDERWAY AND ONE SMALL PIECE OF

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
GOOD NEWS.

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THE FIRE IS NOW ABOUT 5%

210
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
CONTAINED.

211
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
THAT'S NOT MUCH.
BUT IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THE 1%

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THEY HAD JUST A DAY AGO.

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THE COLD FRONT THAT IS FLIPPING

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000

233
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
