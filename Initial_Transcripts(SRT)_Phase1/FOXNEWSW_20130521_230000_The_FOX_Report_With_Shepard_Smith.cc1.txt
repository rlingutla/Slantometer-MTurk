[000:01:37;22] IS 98% SURE THAT TEAMS FROM  
[000:01:39;18] ALREADY FOUND ALL THE  
[000:01:40;14] SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS.

[000:13:46;16] AND SHE GOT A COUPLE  
[000:13:47;23] SCRAPES AND SCRATCHES.  
[000:13:49;09] NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

[000:14:14;07] WEARING A JACKET TODAY  
[000:14:15;20] BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FIND  
[000:14:16;22] HIS CLOSET.

[000:14:29;24] THAT SCHOOL.  
[000:14:30;16] DO WE KNOW?  
[000:14:31;07] >> THERE IS A SMALL PIECE  
[000:14:32;13] OF GOOD NEWS, SHEP.  
[000:14:34;11] IF THERE IS ANY GOOD NEWS  
[000:14:35;22] IN THIS DISASTER.  
[000:14:36;24] IS THE FACT THAT FOR ABOUT  
[000:14:37;28] 17 OR 18 HOURS IT WAS  
[000:14:39;08] BELIEVED AS MANY AS TWO  
[000:14:40;23] DOZEN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN  
[000:14:42;22] TRAPPED IN PARISH IN  
[000:14:44;00] ADDITION TO THE SEVEN YOU  
[000:14:45;12] MENTIONED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  
[000:14:46;07] IT APPEARS NOW THAT WAS  
[000:14:47;23] SIMPLY THE FOG OF CONFUSION  
[000:14:49;17] FOLLOWING THE INITIAL  
[000:14:50;08] STRIKE OF THE TORNADO.  
[000:14:52;05] RESCUE WORKERS WENT THROUGH  
[000:14:52;29] A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A  
[000:14:54;03] NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY AND  
[000:14:54;26] DID NOT FIND ANY MORE  
[000:14:57;01] VICTIMS.  
[000:14:57;15] THE DEATH TOLL HOLDING  
[000:14:58;08] STEADY NOW AT 24.  
[000:14:59;13] IT STILL COULD RISE BUT AT  
[000:15:01;04] LEAST WE BELIEVE NOW 24  
[000:15:03;14] ADDITIONAL CHILDREN DID NOT  
[000:15:04;28] DIE.  
[000:15:05;10] WE'RE ALSO LEARNING A  
[000:15:06;11] LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT  
[000:15:07;04] HAPPENED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL  
[000:15:08;03] IN BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY  
[000:15:09;17] FROM AN A.P. STORY THAT  
[000:15:10;25] CAME OUT JUST A LITTLE  
[000:15:11;22] WHILE AGO.  
[000:15:12;13] AS THE STORM WARNINGS WENT  
[000:15:14;08] OUT, THOSE TORNADO WARNINGS  
[000:15:15;14] ALL THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN  
[000:15:16;08] OUT OF THEIR CLASSROOMS AT  
[000:15:17;07] PLAZA TOWER SENT TO THE  
[000:15:18;05] CALF FEAR I CAN'T TO WAIT  
[000:15:19;13] FOR THEIR PARENTS TO PICK  
[000:15:20;15] THEM UP.  
[000:15:21;10] BUT WHEN THE TORNADO SIRENS  
[000:15:22;23] WENT OFF SCHOOL OFFICIALS  
[000:15:24;12] SCRAMBLED TO GET THEM ALL  
[000:15:25;28] INTO THE HALLWAY AN AREA  
[000:15:27;21] THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE A  
[000:15:28;13] SAFE PLACE.  
[000:15:29;03] BUT ONE TEACHER AT PLAZA  
[000:15:31;25] TOWERS SAID THIS HALLWAY IS  
[000:15:33;04] NOT SAFE.  
[000:15:34;03] SHE GRABBED A BUNCH OF KIDS  
[000:15:35;03] AND TOOK THEM INTO THE  
[000:15:36;25] BATHROOM.  
[000:15:37;10] WHEN THE T. HIT THE  
[000:15:40;18] CHILDREN SURVIVED.  
[000:15:41;21] SIMILAR TORE THE CHILDREN  
[000:15:42;23] TOOK THEM INTO THE HALLWAY  
[000:15:43;22] IT'S NOT SAFE.  
[000:15:44;20] TOOK THEM A FEW OF THEM AND  
[000:15:46;05] WENT INTO THE CLOSET.  
[000:15:47;13] THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS  
[000:15:48;06] WHY NONE OF THE CHILDREN AT  
[000:15:50;00] BRIAR WOOD PERISHED.  
[000:15:51;25] WE SHOULD POINT OUT SHEP,  
[000:15:54;00] NEITHER BRIAR WOOD NOR  
[000:15:56;05] PLAZA TOWERS HAD ANY KIND  
[000:15:57;10] OF SAFE ROOM OR HARDENED  
[000:15:59;12] TORNADO SHELTER.  
[000:16:00;16] THE STUDENTS SIMPLY HAD THE  
[000:16:01;29] STRUCTURE TO PROTECT THEM.  
[000:16:02;29] WE SAW HOW WELL THAT DID  
[000:16:04;08] DURING THIS TORNADO.  
[000:16:08;23] >> Shepard: BECAUSE OF ALL  
[000:16:09;17] OF THAT JOHN, IT'S MY  
[000:16:10;14] UNDERSTANDING YOU MET A MAN  
[000:16:11;29] WHOSE DAUGHTER REALLY  
[000:16:12;25] DIDN'T TRUST THAT THE  
[000:16:14;04] SCHOOLS COULD BE SAFE IN  
[000:16:15;12] THE STORM.  
[000:16:16;22] >> FELLOW WHO LIVES JUST  
[000:16:18;03] ACROSS THE STREET, HIS NAME  
[000:16:19;13] IS JIM GARNER.  
[000:16:20;12] HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY  
[000:16:21;14] AFTERNOON HIS DAUGHTER, WHO  
[000:16:23;20] HAS FOUR KIDS AT PLAZA  
[000:16:25;03] TOWERS ELEMENTARY GOT A  
[000:16:27;03] HINKY FEELING ABOUT  
[000:16:27;26] EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING  
[000:16:28;19] TO HAPPEN.  
[000:16:29;04] HE PICKS UP THE TIME LINE  
[000:16:30;08] FROM THERE.  
[000:16:33;19] SHE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.  
[000:16:35;28] SHE HAD A BAD FEELING.  
[000:16:38;03] SO SHE WENT TO THE SCHOOL  
[000:16:39;14] AND PICKED MY GRAND KIDS UP  
[000:16:40;18] FROM SCHOOL.  
[000:16:41;05] >> WHAT TIME WAS THAT AT.  
[000:16:42;26] >> AROUND 2:00.  
[000:16:43;23] >>  
[000:16:45;17] 2:59?  
[000:16:46;00] >> YES SIR.  
[000:16:46;17] SHE MADE A GOOD DECISION.  
[000:16:47;11] SHE WENT AND GOT THEM OUT  
[000:16:48;11] OF SCHOOL AND BROUGHT THEM  
[000:16:49;19] HOME.  
[000:16:51;29] >>  
[000:16:52;10] >> BROUGHT THEM HOME AND  
[000:16:53;23] TOOK THEM IMMEDIATELY TO  
[000:16:55;15] THE UNDERGROUND TORNADO  
[000:16:56;13] SHELTER RIGHT BEHIND THEIR  
[000:16:57;13] HOUSE.  
[000:16:57;26] SHE ADDED SIX MORE  
[000:16:59;15] CHILDREN.  
[000:17:00;00] JIM GARNER, HIS DAUGHTER  
[000:17:02;09] AND 10 CHILDREN RODE OUT  
[000:17:03;26] THIS TORNADO IN UNDERGROUND  
[000:17:05;04] STORM SHELTER SHEP.  
[000:17:06;09] THEY ALL ESCAPED UNSCATHED.  
[000:17:08;20] THOUGH JIM TOLD ME HE HAD  
[000:17:09;22] TO HOLD ON TO THAT DOOR  
[000:17:10;29] BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE THE  
[000:17:12;00] TORNADO WAS TRYING TO SUCK  
[000:17:13;15] IT OPEN AND SUCK THEM OUT.  
[000:17:16;20] SHEP?

[000:31:25;07] SAID HEY WHERE ARE YOU  
[000:31:26;13] LOCATED?

[000:31:27;24] TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE  
[000:31:28;18] TO TELL THEM TO GO AND I  
[000:31:31;11] REALIZED I WAS LOOKING IN  
[000:31:32;22] THE WRONG SPOT TO TELL THEM

[000:31:40;08] ABOUT PICKING THROUGH THE  
[000:31:41;07] PIECES AND CLEANING UP.  
[000:31:42;18] BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT WAS  
[000:31:45;15] ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ALL  
[000:31:46;10] TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT HOPE.  
[000:31:47;20] HOPE THAT MORE SURVIVORS  
[000:31:48;27] WOULD BE FOUND AND HOPE  
[000:31:50;02] THAT THE DEATH TOLL  
[000:31:51;09] WOULDN'T RISE AND THAT IS  
[000:31:52;27] EXACTLY EMBODIED RIGHT BACK

[000:42:50;14] TO ME, LIFE IN PRISON WAS  
[000:42:51;24] THE MOST UNAPPEALING  
[000:42:53;07] OUTCOME I COULD POSSIBLY  
[000:42:54;09] THINK OF.  
[000:42:55;28] I THOUGHT I WOULD RATHER

[000:43:09;25] OF MURDER IN THE FIRST  
[000:43:10;22] DEGREE AFTER SHE STABBED

[000:43:13;28] SHOT HIM AND SLIT HIS  
[000:43:16;16] THROAT.  
[000:43:17;00] AT THAT TIME SHE CALLED  
[000:43:17;22] DEATH THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM  
[000:43:19;22] BUT TODAY SHE TOLD THE JURY  
[000:43:21;10] SHE HAS MORE PERSPECTIVE  
[000:43:22;15] NOW ABOUT THE POSITIVE  
[000:43:24;17] CHANGE SHE CAN MAKE IN

[000:43:46;20] AND THE DEFENSE DID NOT  
[000:43:48;11] PRESENT MUCH EVIDENCE TO

[000:43:51;13] HERSELF WAS A VICTIM OF  
[000:43:52;08] DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.  
[000:43:52;27] THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL

[000:45:10;10] >> BUT LYING IS NOT A  
[000:45:12;06] CAPITAL CRIME.  
[000:45:12;24] AND LYING DOES NOT GIVE YOU  
[000:45:14;20] THE DEATH PENALTY AND LYING  
[000:45:16;10] ISN'T EVEN AN AGO  
[000:45:19;08] AGGRAVATING FACTOR.  
[000:45:19;28] >> IF SHE GETS LIFE SHE

[000:45:36;11] SHE ASKED FOR THE DEATH  
[000:45:37;16] PENALTY IT WOULD BE LIKE  
[000:45:38;26] COMMITTING SUICIDE AND THAT  
[000:45:40;05] WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL  
[000:45:41;22] FOR HER FAMILY AND SHE SAYS
