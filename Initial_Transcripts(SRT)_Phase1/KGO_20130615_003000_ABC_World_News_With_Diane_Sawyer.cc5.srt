DESTRUCTION, POUNDING AWAY WITH

188
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
TANKS AND HEAVY ARTILLERY.

189
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WHILE THE REBELS RESPOND WITH

190
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
MORTARS AND ROCKET-PROPELLED

191
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
GRENADES.

192
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE REGIME'S JETS STREAK ACROSS
THE SKY.

193
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
AS THE REBELS TRY TO TAKE THEM

194
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
DOWN WITH WEAPONS THEY'VE

195
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
STOLEN.

196
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
SOME REBEL GROUPS ARE WELL

197
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
EQUIPPED, WHILE MANY ARE

198
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DESPERATE FOR AMMUNITION AND

199
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
RESORT TO HOME-MADE WEAPONS LIKE

200
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THIS GIANT SLINGSHOT.

201
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
WE'VE SEEN THE SPARSE REBEL

202
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ARSENAL FIRST HAND.

203
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THE REGIME HAS TANKS, PLANES,

204
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HELICOPTERS AND YOU JUST HAVE

205
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AK-47s AND RPGs.

206
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
HOW CAN YOU DEFEAT THEM IN
ALEPPO?

207
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
"WE HAVE GOD ALMIGHTY," HE SAID,

208
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
"WHO IS FIGHTING WITH US."

209
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AMERICA NOW SAYS IT WILL SEND

210
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
WEAPONS TO THE REBELS, SMALL

211
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ARMS, NOT THE ROCKETS NEEDED TO

212
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
TAKE OUT TANKS OR PLANES.

213
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
TONIGHT, WE MET A REBEL LEADER

214
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
WHO SAYS, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

215
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
THE WEAPONS WON'T BE GOOD ENOUGH

216
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
FOR US TO WIN, HE SAID.

217
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'M AFRAID THEY'LL JUST MAKE THE
WAR GO ON LONGER.

218
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> Reporter: THE OBAMA

219
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HESITANT

220
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
TO OFFER BIGGER WEAPONS, KNOWING

221
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
HOW DISORGANIZED THE REBEL

222
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
FORCES ARE AND RECOGNIZING THAT

223
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
SOME OF THE STRONGEST AMONG

224
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THEM HAVE SWORN ALLEGIANCE TO

225
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
AL QAEDA.

226
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THE FEAR BEING SOME OF THESE

227
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
AMERICAN WEAPONS COULD EASILY

228
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS.

229
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
DAVID?

230
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS.

231
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I WANT TO BRING IN ABC'S MARTHA

232
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
RADDATZ.

233
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WE WERE ALL TALKING EARLIER

234
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
ABOUT FEARS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY

235
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THAT THIS COULD BE A SLIPPERY

236
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SLOPE, THAT THIS COULD BE

237
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
ANOTHER WAR WE'RE HEADED INTO.

238
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS

239
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
SAID EMPHATICALLY, NO BOOTS ON

240
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THE GROUND IN SYRIA.

241
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
BUT I DO THINK MANY AMERICANS

242
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WORRY ABOUT THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE.

243
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
WE WERE AT WAR IN IRAQ FOR

244
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
NEARLY TEN YEARS, ALTHOUGH WE

245
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE OVER IN NO
TIME.

246
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AND WE ARE STILL IN AFGHANISTAN

247
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
AFTER NEARLY 12 YEARS.

248
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS FROM

249
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THOSE CONFLICTS AND NO ONE LIKES

250
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
TO SEE SUCH HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE

251
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
SLAUGHTER IN SYRIA, BUT THERE

252
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
ARE MANY MILITARY OFFICERS I'VE

253
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
SPOKEN TO WHO ARE CONCERNED

254
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
ABOUT THE GOAL IN SYRIA, WITH

255
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THE SMALL ARMS, AND EVEN MORE

256
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
CONCERNED, DAVID, ABOUT WHAT

257
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
HAPPENS NEXT IF THEY DON'T DO

258
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
ANY GOOD.

259
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> ALL RIGHT, MARTHA, THANK YOU.

260
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>>> WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW

261
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000

REACTION THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

270
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
GOT AT THIS MODEST HOUSE IN

271
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MINNEAPOLIS, HOME TO AN ALLEGED

272
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
NAZI WAR CRIMINAL.

NEWS THAT STUNNED NEIGHBORS.

274
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> WOW, WHAT A BACKGROUND.

275
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
IT'S A SHOCKER.

276
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000

KARKOC, 94.

277
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
AN ASSOCIATED PRESS

278
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT KARKOC

279
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WAS A TOP COMMANDER IN A UNIT

280
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
LED BY THE NAZI SS, ACCUSED OF

281
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BURNING VILLAGES IN THE UKRAINE

282
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
AND KILLING DOZENS OF WOMEN AND

283
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
CHILDREN.

284
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
KARKOC CAME TO AMERICA IN 1949,

285
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
LYING TO OFFICIALS ON THIS

287
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
NEVER SERVED IN THE MILITARY.

288
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SINCE THEN, HE'S LIVED OPENLY IN

MINNEAPOLIS, RAISING A FAMILY,

290
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
AND SERVING AS A LEADER IN THE

291
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000

REPORTS OF HIS DARK PAST ONLY

293
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
CAME TO LIGHT BECAUSE OF AN

AMATEUR NAZI HUNTER OVER IN

WHEN CONFRONTED BY THE A.P., ALL

298
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
KARKOC WOULD SAY WAS, QUOTE, I

299
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
DON'T THINK I CAN EXPLAIN.

300
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HE MAY HAVE TO.

301
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
EXPERTS SAY HE COULD BE DEPORTED

302
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
