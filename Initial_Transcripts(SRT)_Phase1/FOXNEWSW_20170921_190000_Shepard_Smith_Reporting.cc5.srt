CENTRAL BANK, WHICH MAKES IT

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SIGNIFICANT.

81

ANALYSTS SAY IT WOULD BE A MAJOR

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000

NORTH KOREA IF IT HAD TO, BUT

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
HOPEFULLY HE SAID IT WON'T BE

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
NECESSARY.

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000

WE WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES AND

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
CLOSELY WITH THEM.

189
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
>> MR. SECRETARY, CAN I READ A

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
QUICK SECTION OF THE E.O.?

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
NO AIRCRAFT IN WHICH A FOREIGN

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
PERSON HAS AN INTERESTED HAS

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
LANDED AT A PLACE IN NORTH

194
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
KOREA, MAY LAND IN THE UNITED

195
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
STATES AFTER DEPARTURE FROM

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
NORTH KOREA.

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THEN SIMILAR APPLICATIONS TO

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
SHIPS.
ANY IDEA ON HOW MANY SHIPS OR

199
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
AIRCRAFT WOULD BE HAVE BEEN

200
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
AFFECTED IN PICK A YEAR?

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
SO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF THE

202
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SCALE OF THE IMPACT.

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> AGAIN, ANOTHER IMPORTANT

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ASPECT OF THE E.O. BESIDES FOR

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
US BEING ABLE TO BLOCK FINANCIAL

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
TRANSACTIONS.

207
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WE'LL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
COAST GUARD AND OTHERS ON THIS.

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'M NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOU A

210
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
NUMBER.
IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT.

211
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
FURTHER, WE CAN PUT ACTIONS

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AGAINST PORTS AS WELL.

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>> A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

214
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
FIRST ONE, WHY WILL THIS ROUND

215
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
OF SANCTIONS WORK WHEN OTHERS

216
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HAVE FAILED?

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> AGAIN, LET ME BE CLEAR.

218
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I DON'T THINK OTHER SANCTIONS

219
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
HAVE FAILED.
THESE SANCTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
NOT ONLY DOES IT ALLOW US TO

221
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
SANCTION INDIVIDUALS OR

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
ENTITIES, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
FREEZE OR BLOCK ANY TRANSACTIONS

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
WITH ANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT

226
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
FACILITATES ANY TRANSACTIONS
WITH THE BLOCKED PERSON.

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> DO THESE SANCTIONS INCLUDED A

228
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
PLAN TO TARGET NORTH KOREAN

229
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD?

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> YES, IT DOES.

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> ANY FUTURE SANCTIONS?

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> I WON'T COMMENT ON FUTURE

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
SANCTIONS.
WE'LL REVIEW ALL OPTIONS.

234
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> DOES THIS REPRESENT A

235
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
REJECTION OR A MOVING PATH TO

236
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL?

237
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IN ANY WAY.

238
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WE APPRECIATE THE U.N. SECURITY

239
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND THE

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TO THAT.

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THIS GOES BEYOND IT.

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
AS I'VE MENTIONED, THIS ALLOWS

243
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
US TO BLOCK ANY FINANCIAL

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
INSTITUTION THAT DOESN'T

245
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE U.N.

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
SANCTIONS OR ADDITIONAL
SANCTIONS.

247
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>> WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE
DESIGNATIONS --

248
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> WE'LL DO DESIGNATIONS ON A

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
ROLLING BASIS.
THIS STARTS TODAY.

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
IT'S FORWARD LOOKING, NOT

251
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
BACKWARDS LOOKING.

252
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
>> CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT YOUR

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CENTRAL

254
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
BANK OF CHINA?

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND --

256
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
>> AGAIN, THOSE CONVERSATIONS

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
AS I SAID, I HAD A VERY

259
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THEM THIS MORNING.

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
>> PIGGYBACKING ON THAT, THE

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TIMELINE, HAS THERE BEEN

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
BANK OF CHINA?

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
>> NO, THERE WERE NO PREVIOUS

266
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
DISCUSSIONS.
THE FIRST TIME WE DISCUSSED IT

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WAS THIS MORNING.

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I CALLED THEM TO ALERT THEM OF

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THIS IN ADVANCE GIVEN THEIR

270
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
CLOSE COOPERATION WITH US.

271
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
>> THANK YOU.

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
SO I WANT TO ASK PART OF THE

273
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
SAME QUESTION.

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THAT CHINA HAD GIVEN SOME
INDICATION 1 1/2 WEEKS AGO OF

275
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
SOME ACTIONS.

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WHAT DID THEY TODAY IS SEPARATE

277
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
FROM WHAT THEY INDICATED

278
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
EARLIER --
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE

279
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY DID

280
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
EARLIER.
WHAT THEY DID TODAY IS I ASSUME

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AS A RESULT OF OUR CONVERSATION.

282
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
>> CAN I ASK --

283
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
>> LET'S COME BACK TO YOU SO WE

284
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
CAN GET OTHER PEOPLE.

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
>> CAN YOU -- DO YOU BELIEVE

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THAT CHINA'S ACTIONS TODAY

287
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
REDUCE THE NEED FOR FURTHER

288
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
SECONDARY SANCTIONS ON CHINESE

289
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
ENTITIES --
>> I JUST COMMENTED WE LOOK

290
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS

291
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WELL AS ALL OF OUR PARTNERS.

292
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS

293
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES THE

294
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
TREASURY HAS.

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> CAN YOU PUT THIS IN THE

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
CONTEXT OF THE PRESIDENT'S

297
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
SPEECH EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN

298
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
HE TALKED ABOUT MORE MILITARY

299
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
ACTION?
HOW DO THESE THINGS WORK

300
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
TOGETHER AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
NORTH KOREA TO DO IN RESPONSE?

301
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WHAT I EXPECT NORTH KOREA TO DO.

303
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THE
OBJECTIVE, FOR THEM TO STOP

304
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THEIR MISSILE TESTS AND GIVE UP

305
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

306
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
IN THE WORKS FOR A WHILE.

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I ALLUDED TO THIS ABOUT TWO

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
WEEKS AGO, THAT I HAD BEEN

309
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE

310
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
PRESIDENT AND THIS IS ALL PART

311
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OF THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY AT

312
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THE U.N. THIS WEEK.

313
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> SECRETARY TILLERSON SAID IT

314
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
TOOK AWHILE FOR THE LAST ROUND

315
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
OF SANCTIONS TO HAVE AN IMPACT

316
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
OR FOR NORTH KOREA TO BE ABLE TO

317
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
FEEL THEM IS.
THERE A TIMELINE THAT YOU'RE

318
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
LOOKING AT IN WHICH CASE --

319
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
>> AGAIN, THERE'S NO TIME LINE.

320
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THIS IS FORWARD ACTION ON THIS.

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE

322
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
HOPE THAT THERE'S VOLUNTARY

323
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
COOPERATION, BUT TO THE EXTENT

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THAT WE HAVE TO CUT OFF BANKS

325
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
FROM THE BANKING SYSTEM IN THE
UNITED STATES, WHICH OBVIOUSLY

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT, WE NOW

327
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
HAVE THOSE TOOLS TO DO THAT.

328
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
>> DO YOU RECALL ANY OTHER

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
COUNTRIES, CENTRAL BANKS --

330
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
COMMENTS ON CONFIDENTIAL

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER

333
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
COUNTRIES.
AGAIN, I'M CONFIRMING THAT I DID

334
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
SPEAK TO THEM THIS MORNING.

335
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON

336
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE

337
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
CONFIDENTIAL.

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
>> THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THANKED

339
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
PRESIDENT XI FOR HIS ACTIONS.

340
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
DO YOU THINK THEY WERE ENOUGH?

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
DID YOU CALL ON RUSSIA --

342
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
>> AGAIN, WE'LL CALL ON RUSSIA

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
TO DO MORE.

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT XI

345
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
CONVERSATIONS AND WE APPRECIATE

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THE WAY THEY'RE WORKING WITH US.

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE MORE.

349
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
>> I'D FOLLOW UP ON MY INITIAL

350
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
QUESTION.
YOU SAID THIS WAS NOT TARGETED

351
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AT CHINA SPECIFICALLY.

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
BUT CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING

353
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
PARTNER WITH NORTH KOREA.

354
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
SO CAN YOU SPELL OUT HOW THIS

355
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
WILL AFFECT THEM AND HOW IT WILL

356
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
AFFECT THE U.S. AND THEIR

357
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA WITH

358
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
REGARD TO NORTH KOREA?

359
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
>> AS I EMPHASIZED EARLIER, THIS

360
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
IS TARGETED AT NORTH KOREA AND

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO DO TRADE

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
OR BUSINESS WITH THEM.

363
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WE APPRECIATE THE RELATIONSHIP

364
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
WITH CHINA AND LOOK FORWARD TO

365
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WORKING WITH THEM.

366
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

367
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
>> Shepard: STEVE MNUCHIN

368
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
DISCUSSING THE NEW SANCTIONS BY

369
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THE PRESIDENT THROUGH NORTH

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
KOREA WITH PARTNERSHIP IT WOULD

371
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
APPEAR FROM A NUMBER OF NATIONS.

372
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
HE WOULDN'T BE SPECIFIC ABOUT

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
DISCUSSIONS.

374
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
BIG PICTURE WITH THE SANCTIONS

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
AND THE NATIONS COMING TOGETHER

376
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
WHAT IS THE GOAL?

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
JOHN ROBERTS TRAVELLING WITH THE

378
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
PRESIDENT IN NEW YORK AND IN THE

379
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
STUDIO WITH US TODAY.

380
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
BIG PICTURE?
>> BIG PICTURE, THIS IS DESIGNED

381
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
TO GET KIM JONG-UN TO THE

382
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
NEGOTIATING TABLE.

383
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED, IS

384
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
THERE STILL ROOM FOR DIALOGUE?

385
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
HE SAID WHY NOT.

386
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
ALL OF THIS THAT YOU'VE HAVE

387
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SEEN IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO GET

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
KIM JONG-UN TO THE NEGOTIATING

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
TABLE TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
FREEZING IT BUT TO GIVE IT UP.

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THE PRESIDENT'S GOAL IS TO

392
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN

393
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
PENINSULA.
IT MEANS FREEZING IT AND ROLLING

394
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
IT BACK TO NOTHING.

395
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
ONE OF THE BIG DEVELOPMENTS IS

396
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
THE FACT THAT CHINA FINALLY

397
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE.

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT

399
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SAID CHINA DECIDED TO DO TODAY.

400
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> CHINA, THEIR CENTRAL BANK,

401
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
HAS TOLD THEIR OTHER BANKS, A

402
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
MASSIVE BANKING SYSTEM, TO

403
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
IMMEDIATELY STOP DOING BUSINESS

404
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
WITH NORTH KOREA.

405
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I THANK PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA

406
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
FOR THE BOLD MOVE HE MADE TODAY.

407
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
THIS IS A SOMEWHAT UNEXPECTED

408
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
MOVE AROUND WE APPRECIATE IT.

409
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> RIGHT NOW THE PRESIDENT IS

410
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
SPEAKING WITH PRESIDENT ERDOGAN

411
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000

MEETING AND THE POOL IS THERE.

414
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
LET'S WATCH.

415
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
A GREAT HONOR AND PRIVILEGE.

417
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
HE'S BECOME A FRIEND OF MINE.

418
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I WANT TO INTRODUCE PRESIDENT

419
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
ERDOGAN OF TURKEY.

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
HE'S RUNNING A VERY DIFFICULT

421
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
PART OF THE WORLD.

422
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
HE'S INVOLVED VERY STRONGLY AND

423
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
HE'S GETTING HIGH MARKS FRANKLY.

424
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
HE'S ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE

425
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
UNITED STATES.

426
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WE HAVE A GREAT FRIENDSHIP.

427
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
AS COUNTRIES WE'RE AS CLOSE AS

428
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
WE HAVE EVER BEEN.

429
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

430
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.

431
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
SO PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY

432
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000

THANK YOU.

435
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
[SPEAKING TURKISH].

436
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
>> Shepard: THE TURKISH PRIME

MINISTER EDWARD SPEAKING WITH

438
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
ERDOGAN, A VERY COMPLICATED

440
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
RELATIONSHIP.
LET'S LISTEN.

441
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
>> WE ARE GETTING TOGETHER WITH

442
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
YOU AS A DELEGATION AND WE WILL

MEETINGS-WE'LL ASSESS THE

445
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

446
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY AND

HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS

448
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AS A

449
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WHOLE.
I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK

450
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

451
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

452
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
MR. PRESIDENT.

453
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
WE APPRECIATE IT.

454
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

455
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN IS THE

456
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
LAST TIME YOU SPOKE WITH PAUL

457
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
MANAFORT.

458
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
>> Shepard: A DIFFICULT SET OF

459
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE WITH THE

460
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN.

461
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
HE'S JAILED PEOPLE BY THE

462
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THOUSANDS FOR SPEAKING OUT

463
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT.

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
HE'S JAILED MORE THAN 120

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
JOURNALISTS, DENOUNCED AROUND

466
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THE WORLD.

467
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
THERE'S A WIDELY-HELD BELIEF

468
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THAT HE'S TURNING WHAT APPEARED

469
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TO BE A COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO

470
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
DEMOCRATIZATION INTO SOMETHING

471
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
AKIN TO A DICTATORSHIP.

472
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> THE PROBLEM HERE, HE'S A NATO

473
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
MEMBER AND TURKEY IS THE GATEWAY

474
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
FROM TURKEY TO THE MIDDLE EAST.

475
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
YOU SAID IT'S A COMPLICATED

476
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
RELATIONSHIP.

477
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
A DIPLOMATIC WAY OF PUTTING UP.

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
>> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

479
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
RESOLVE IT.

480
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
SEEING HIM UP THERE, AS A

481
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
JOURNALIST IT AFFECTS YOU THE

482
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
SAME WAY IT DOES ME.

483
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
IT'S A SCARY PROPOSITION WHAT IS

484
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
HAPPENING IN TURKEY, IT'S
AGAINST EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
THE UNITED STATES.

486
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
>> IT IS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PRESIDENT,

487
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
THIS NATION NEEDS TO HAVE A

488
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAUSE OF

489
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
WHERE HIS COUNTRY IS AND WHERE

490
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
THEY REPRESENT.

491
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
IT'S ONE OF THOSE LINES THAT YOU

492
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
HAVE TO HOLD YOUR NOSE TO DEAL

493
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
WITH THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DEAL

494
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
WITH.

495
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE IN THIS

496
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
POINT.
BACK TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT

497
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
PRIOR TO GOING HERE, CHINA.

498
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THE MOVE THAT CHINA MADE IN

499
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
TERMS OF THE CENTRAL BANK

500
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
TELLING CHINESE BANKS, DON'T DO

501
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
ANY BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA

502
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
ANYMORE, THAT'S BIG.

503
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID CHINA NEEDS

504
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

505
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT

506
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
LAST THURSDAY, I ASKED HIM ABOUT

507
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
NORTH KOREA AND CHINA.

508
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
HE SAID THEY'RE PLANNING SOME

509
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
MOVES WITH CHINA HE COULDN'T

510
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
TELL US ABOUT.

511
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
IT WOULD CLEARLY SEEM THIS IS

512
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
IT.
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE

513
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THIS DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT

514
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
CHINA'S COOPERATION AND CHINA

515
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
TAKING STRINGENT MEASURES.

516
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
ALWAYS LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR

517
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
CHEATING, BUT MAYBE THIS IS A

518
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
STEP DOWN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

519
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
>> Shepard: CHINA HAS BEEN CLEAR

520
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
TO SAY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE,

521
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
WE'VE DONE WHAT WE CAN DO.

522
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
THE WORLD IS PUSHING US.

523
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
>> THE CHINESE CAN DO MORE THAN

524
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THEY'VE BEEN DOING.

525
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
>> Shepard: OBVIOUSLY.

526
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I WONDER IF THIS IS A CHANGE.

527
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
>> IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A

528
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
CHANGE.

529
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
ALTHOUGH THERE'S ROOM FOR

530
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
CHEATING.
IS THIS CHINA JUST SAYING THIS

531
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO OR IS

532
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THIS CHINA DOING WHAT THEY SAY

533
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO?

534
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
>> Shepard: THE U.S.,

535
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
SANCTIONING BANKS, THIS IS A

536
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
WIDE EXPANSION?

537
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
>> IT BROADENS THE TARGET

538
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
ENVIRONMENT.
THERE WAS ONE CHINESE BANK BEING

539
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
SANCTIONED.
THIS LAST TARGETED INDIVIDUALS

540
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

541
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT

542
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
NORTH KOREA AND GOING TO TARGET

543
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THE NORTH KOREAN TEXTILE

544
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
INDUSTRY AND THE FISHING

545
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
INDUSTRY.
OTHER SMALLER INDUSTRIES THAT

546
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

547
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
DEFENSE MINISTRY, THIS IS TRYING

548
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
TO PUT A CHOKE HOLD ON NORTH

549
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
KOREA.

550
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE

551
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
DOESN'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR

552
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
ANYTHING SHORT OF

553
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

554
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
PENINSULA.
THERE COULD BE WIGGLE ROOM

555
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THERE.
I DON'T THINK NORTH KOREA WOULD

556
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
FREEZE IT UP.

557
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN

558
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
ROBERTS.

559
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
GORDON CHANG WROTE THE BOOK ON

560
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
NORTH KOREA.

561
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
HE'S OUR GUEST LIVE NEXT.

562
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
WILL THIS WORK?

563
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
THAT'S NEXT.

564
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
When my doctor told me

565
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I have age-related macular
degeneration, AMD,

566
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
he told me to look at this
grid every day.

567
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And we came up with a plan

568
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to help reduce

569
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
my risk
of progression,

570
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
including PreserVision
AREDS 2.

571
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
My doctor said
PreserVision
AREDS 2

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
has the exact
nutrient formula

573
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the National Eye
Institute recommends

574
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
to help reduce

575
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
the risk of progression of
moderate to advanced AMD

576
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
after 15 years
of clinical studies.

577
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
PreserVision
AREDS 2.

578
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Because my eyes
are everything.

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But Prevagen helps your brain
with an ingredient

580
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
originally discovered...

581
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
in jellyfish.

582
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
In clinical trials,
Prevagen has been shown

583
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
to improve short-term memory.

584
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Prevagen. The name to remember.

585
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
>> Shepard: NEW SANCTIONS ON

586
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
NORTH KOREA WITH CHINESE HELP.

587
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
LET'S GO TO GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR

588
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
OF "NUCLEAR SHOW DOWN: NORTH

589
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD."

590
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
GORDON, THANK YOU.

591
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
>> THANKS, SHEP.

592
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
>> Shepard: A BIT OF A MUTED

593
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
RESPONSE.

594
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
SOMETHING ABOUT DOGS BARKING.

595
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
YOUR THOUGHTS?

596
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
>> YEAH, THIS IS EXTREMELY

597
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
SIGNIFICANT.
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AND

598
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WHAT TREASURY SECRETARY MNUCHIN

599
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
IS NOW DOING IS SHUTTING OFF THE

600
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
MONEY TO THE NORTH KOREAN

601
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
REGIME.
EVERY BANK GETS A FREE PASS FOR

602
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
WHAT THEY DID IN THE PAST WITH

603
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THEIR RELATIONS WITH PYONGYANG.

604
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
WHAT MNUCHIN SAID, LOOK, GOING

605
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
FORWARD, IF A BANK VIOLATES U.S.

606
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
LAW, IT WILL BE DESIGNATED.

607
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
YOU HEARD THAT WORD

608
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
"DESIGNATION" IN THE PRESS

609
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
CONFERENCE.
THAT'S UNDER 311 OF THE PATRIOT

610
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
ACT.
IF A BANK IS SO DESIGNATED, IT'S

611
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
CUT OFF FROM THE GLOBAL

612
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
FINANCIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT CAN

613
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
NO LONGER TRANSACT BUSINESS IN

614
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
DOLLARS.

615
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS NOW WILL

616
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
DO IS TRY TO TRANSACT BUSINESS

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
IN OTHER CURRENCIES, WHAT THE

618
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
UNITED STATES IS GO AROUND THE

619
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
WORLD AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T

620
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
USE OTHER CURRENCIES.

621
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
>> Shepard: THE NORTH KOREANS

622
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
DIDN'T SAY MUCH.

623
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
THEY WAIT AWHILE.

624
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
YOU WONDER IF THEY WON'T WAIT

625
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
UNTIL ALL OF THESE WORLD LEADERS

626
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES.

627
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

628
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO DO

629
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
IS ENGAGE IN A PROVOCATION THAT

630
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
GIVES UP TRUMP TO TALK TO OTHER

631
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
WORLD LEADERS.

632
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I EXPECT THE NORTH KOREANS TO BE

633
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
QUIET A WORK OR SO.

634
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
YOU HEARD WHAT NORTH KOREA SAY

635
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
ABOUT THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT

636
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
TRUMP, LIKE A DOG BARKING.

637
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
THEY'RE SEEING THAT THE U.S. CAN

638
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
EXERT PRESSURE ON THEIR PRIMARY

639
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
BACKER.

640
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
NORTH KOREA IS IN A WORLD OF

641
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
HURT.
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS REPORTS

642
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THE BIG PICTURE IS TO GET NORTH

643
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
KOREANS TO THE NEGOTIATING

644
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
TABLE.
DOES THIS HELP?

645
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
>> OBVIOUSLY NEGOTIATIONS ARE

646
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THE PREFERRED WAY OF SOLVING

647
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
THIS.
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD START THE

648
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
DISCUSSIONS ONLY WHEN THE NORTH

649
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
KOREANS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY

650
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DISARM.
IF WE START THEM EARLIER THAN

651
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
THAT, THEY WILL USE THEM TO

652
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
DELAY TO PERFECT THEIR MISSILES

653
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
AND NUKES.
THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN THE

654
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
SIX-PARTY TALKS IN THE

655
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W.

656
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
BUSH.
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN.

657
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
THE PRESIDENT, OUR PRESIDENT

658
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
UNDERSTANDS THAT, AND I THINK

659
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WE'LL SEE MAXIMUM PRESSURE,

660
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
MAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT, WHICH IS THE

661
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
BUZZ PHRASE IN WASHINGTON.

662
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
IT MIGHT WORK THIS TIME IF THE

663
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
ADMINISTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY

664
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
DETERMINED TO CARRY FORWARD ON

665
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
THIS.

666
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
>> Shepard: SHORT ON TIME.

667
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
LESS LIKELY OR MORE LIKELY TO

668
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
GET ANOTHER MISSILE TEST?

669
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
>> THERE WILL BE ANOTHER MISSILE

670
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
TEST.
THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TO

671
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES.

672
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
THEY WANT A DETERRENT.

673
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THEY WANT TO SELL THESE THINGS

674
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
TO THE IRANIANS, THIS IS WHERE

675
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WE COME IN.

676
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
THE IRANIANS PAY THE NORTH

677
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
KOREANS $2 BILLION TO $3 BILLION

678
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
A YEAR.
WHAT MNUCHIN IS DOING WILL CUT

679
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
OFF THAT FLOW OF CASH IF HE'S

680
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
SUCCESSFUL.
WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED THAT THE

681
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
NORTH KOREANS DON'T SWITCH TO

682
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
OTHER CURRENCIES.
THE ONE CURRENCY WE CAN'T

683
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
CONTROL IS THE CHINESE CURRENCY.

684
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
>> GORDON CHANG FROM WASHINGTON.

685
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THANK YOU.

686
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
>> THANK YOU, SHEPARD.

687
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
>> Shepard: THERE'S BREAKING

688
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
NEWS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE IN

689
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
MEXICO.
MOMENTS AGO, WORD THAT THERE ARE

690
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
NO CHILDREN STILL ALIVE IN THAT

691
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
SCHOOL THAT COLLAPSED THERE

692
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
AFTER TUESDAY'S POWERFUL

693
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
EARTHQUAKE.

694
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
THAT CAME FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY.

695
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
EARLIER REPORTS HAD INDICATED

696
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
THAT UP TO SIX CHILDREN MIGHT BE

697
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
ALIVE IN THE RUBBLE.

698
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS QUOTING AN

699
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
OFFICIAL FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY

700
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
SAYS THERE MAY STILL BE AN ADULT

701
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
ALIVE IN THE WRECKAGE.

702
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS, BUT NO

703
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
CHILDREN.

704
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
THE PILE OF WRECKAGE SHIFTED

705
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
DRAMATICALLY THIS MORNING.

706
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
WORKERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROP

707
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
IT UP WITH IRON BEAMS.

708
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SETS OF

709
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
HUMAN REMAINS MAY BE UNDERNEATH.

710
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
SAYS THEY HAVE EXPERTS AND TONS

715
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
OF EQUIPMENT.

716
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY SO FAR THE

717
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
QUAKE HAS KILLED 245 PEOPLE AND

718
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
INJURED MORE THAN 2,000.

719
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT,

720
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE AT THE

721
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
SCHOOL.
JONATHAN?

722
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
>> SHEP, IT'S A VERY TENSE SCENE

723
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
HERE AT THE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

724
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
THE SCHOOL IS ABOUT 50 YARDS OR

725
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
SO BEHIND ME.
IT'S A HIVE OF ACTIVITY AND

726
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
REMAINS SO.

727
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
RUBBLE BEING BROUGHT OUT FROM
THE SCENE, LOADED ON TO THE

728
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
TRUCKS YOU CAN SEE HERE.

729
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
AS WE COME LEFT AND DOWN A BIT,

730
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPLY TENTS.

731
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
THESE ARE SET UP TO SUPPORT THE

732
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
RESCUE WORKERS IN THEIR HUNDREDS

733
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
IF NOT THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEER
CIVILIANS DOING WHAT THEY CAN DO

734
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
HELP IN THIS VERY INTENSE RESCUE

735
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
EFFORT, SHEP.
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING CONFLICTING

736
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
REPORTS ALL DAY AS YOU JUST

737
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
POINTED OUT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

738

741
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
ARE, THEY ARE CHILDREN OR

742
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
ADULTS.
THE LATEST AS YOU SAID FROM THE

743
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
ASSOCIATED PRESS, HEARING FROM

744
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
THE MEXICAN NAVY, WHICH IS ONE

745
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
OF THE INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN

746
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
THE RESCUE EFFORT, THAT THEY DO

747
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY

748
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
SURVIVING CHILDREN.

749
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
THEY DO BELIEVE THERE MAY BE AN

750
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
ADULT ALIVE.

751
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
WE HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM OUR

752
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
SOURCES CLOSER IN TO THE SCHOOL

753
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THAT A HEAT-SEEKING CAMERA HAS

754
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
PICKED UP A SIGNAL THAT MAY

755
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE

756
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000

I WANT TO CAUTION EVEN WITH THE

ASSOCIATED PRESS HEARING THIS

758
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000

SO MANY CONFLICTING REPORTS

759
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
FLOATING AROUND WHO MAY OR MAY

760
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
NOT BE ALIVE UNDERNEATH THAT

761
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
RUBBLE.

762
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TAKE ANYTHING

BUT YOU MENTIONED THE OTHER

IT APPEARS THERE'S DOZENS AND

782

PROGRESS, SHEP.

785
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
WE WERE AT AN OFFICE BUILDING

786

AN AREA KNOWN AS ROMA.

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
IT COLLAPSED OVERNIGHT.

792
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
A MIRACLE THERE.

793
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
TWO WOMEN AND ONE MAN PULLED OUT

794
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
ALIVE.
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORT

795
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
GOES ON THERE.
WE'RE TOLD BY FAMILIES OF PEOPLE

796
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000

HE JUMPED THE FENCE AND TOOK OFF

857
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
LIKE A CRIMINAL.

858
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH SHEPARD

I count on my

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
My Ancestry DNA results

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I put the Gele on my

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
unpredictable abdominal pain
or discomfort

876
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
and diarrhea.

877
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I tried lifestyle changes

878
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and over-the-counter treatments,

879
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
but my symptoms keep
coming back.

880
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It turns out I have

881
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
with Diarrhea,

882
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
or IBS-D.

883
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
A condition that's really
frustrating.

884
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That's why I talked to my
doctor about VIBERZI...

885
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
...a different way
to treat IBS-D.

886
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
VIBERZI is a
prescription medication

887
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
you take every day

888
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
that helps proactively manage

889
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
both abdominal pain and

890
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
diarrhea at the same time.

891
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So I can stay ahead of
my symptoms.

892
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
VIBERZI can cause new or
worsening abdominal pain.

893
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Do not take VIBERZI
if you have no gallbladder,

894
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
have pancreas or
severe liver problems,

895
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
problems with alcohol abuse,

896
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
long-lasting or
severe constipation,

897
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
or a bowel or
gallbladder blockage.

898
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Pancreatitis may occur

899
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
and can lead to
hospitalization and death.

900
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If you are taking VIBERZI,

901
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you should not take medicines
that cause constipation.

902
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The most common side effects of
VIBERZI include constipation,

903
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
nausea, and abdominal pain.

904
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Stay ahead of IBS-D
with VIBERZI.

RICO IN MORE THAN 80 YEARS.

921
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
RESCUE WORKERS TODAY DEALING

922
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
WITH DOWNED STREETS AND FLOODING

923
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
STREETS AS THEY TRY TO REACH

924
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
VICTIMS THAT NEED HELP.

925
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
THE STORM DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF

926
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
HOMES AND KNOCKED OUT

927
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
ELECTRICITY TO THE ISLAND AND

928
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
BROUGHT DOWN CELL PHONE TOWERS

929
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
AND LEAVING MOST PEOPLE UNABLE

930
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
TO CALL FOR HELP OR CALL FOR

931
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
FAMILY MEMBERS.

932
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
MORE IMAGES TO SHARE IN THE

933
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
SLIDE SHOW THIS AFTERNOON.

934
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
THIS IS TYPICAL DAMAGE, I'M

935
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
TOLD.
A FLOODED GAS STATION ON THE

936
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
ISLAND'S EAST COAST.

937
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THE SAME AREA, AMBULANCES

938
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
TRAPPED UNDER THE COLLAPSED

939
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
ROOF.
THE ROAD LITTERED WITH POLES AND

940
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
POWER LINES.

941
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
LOOK AT THAT.

942
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
THINK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO

943
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
FREE UP THIS ROAD AND FREE UP

944
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
THE POWER LINES?

945
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THERE'S A WHOLE ISLAND LIKE

946
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
THAT.

947
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
HERE'S WHAT'S LEFT OF A HOUSE

948
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
NEXT TO THE SOUTHERN COAST.

949
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
THE ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR

950
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
SAID IT WILL BE A HISTORIC

951
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
EVENT.
AND THIS IS NEAR PUNTA CANA.

952
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
YOU CAN SEE A DAMAGED RESTAURANT

953
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
IN THE AREA.

954
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
A CATEGORY THREE STORM BY THE

955
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
TIME IT BATTERED THAT ISLAND

956
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
TODAY WITH WINDS SUSTAINED AT

957
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
NEARLY 115 MILES AN HOUR.

958
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
FORECASTERS SAY MARIA REGAINED

959
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS AS IT

960
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
MOVED OFF THE COAST OF THE

961
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TODAY.

962
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER

963
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
HERE IN THE U.S. REPORTS THAT

964
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
MARIA IS EXPECTED TO BRING

965
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
DANGEROUS WINDS, HEAVY WIND TO

966
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS AND

967
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THE BAHAMAS LATER TODAY.

968
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
MORE AHEAD IN THE FORECAST.

969
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHITE

970
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
SPREAD DAMAGE IN ST. CROIX AND

971
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.

972
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
IT WAS A CAT FIVE MONSTER WHEN

973
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
IT PASSED OVER-TUESDAY.

974
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
THERE'S MORE FLOODING IN

975
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
ST. THOMAS.

976
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN WITH

977
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
MORE.
>> A COUPLE OF FEET OF FLOODING

978
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
AROUND THESE APARTMENTS.

979
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR BALCONIES.

980
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
THEY'RE WITHOUT ELECTRIC POWER.

981
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
PEOPLE TRUDGING THROUGH THIS

982
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
WATER WITH STICKS AS GUIDES.

983
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
OLDER PEOPLE GETTING HELP.

984
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
IT'S TOUGH TO SEE PEOPLE WALK

985
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THROUGH WITH CHILDREN ON THEIR

986
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
BACKS OR CARRYING THEIR ITEMS IN

987
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
PLASTIC.
SOME WOMAN OVER HERE CHOP UP

988
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
WOOD WITH MACHETES AND HAMMERS

989
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
AND BUILD A COOKOUT.

990
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
IT'S OUTDOOR LIVING AT THE MOST

991
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
PRIMITIVE.

992
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
WE'VE SEEN A HYDRANT USED AS A

993
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
BATH THIS MORNING, SHEPARD.

994
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
>> Shepard: STEVE, ARE THEY

995
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
GETTING THE HELP IN THE EARLY

996
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
GOING?

997
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE

998
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
INSIDE THEIR APARTMENTS OFTEN

999
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
WITH FLOOD WATER AND HOLES IN

1000
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
THE ROOFS, THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT

1001
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
GETTING ANYTHING.

1002
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
IT'S A DO-IT-YOURSELF OPERATION.

1003
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
IT'S PEOPLE TAKING RUBBISH FROM

1004
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
HURRICANE IRMA AND TRYING TO USE

1005
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
IT TO PROP UP A POWER LINE THAT

1006
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
WAS DOWNED BY HURRICANE MARIA.

1007
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
USING ONE HURRICANE TO HELP

1008
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
ANOTHER.
HELP IS ON THE WAY FROM FEMA AND

1009
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
FROM THE COAST GUARD.

1010
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
RIGHT NOW MOODS ARE GOOD HERE.

1011
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
THE PEOPLE ARE RESILIENT.

1012
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
WITHOUT HELP QUICKLY, THAT COULD

1013
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
CHANGE, SHEPARD.
>> Shepard: I SUSPECT SO.

1014
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN.

1015
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
LET'S GET MORE ON THE

1016
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
HURRICANE'S PATH.
IT'S STILL ON THE MOVE AND HEAD

1017
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
ADD CROSS THE CARIBBEAN.

1018
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
CHIEF METEOROLOGIST RICK

1019
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
REICHMUTH IN THE EXTREME WEATHER

1020
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
CENTER.

1021
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
RICK?
>> TURKS AND CAICOS WILL BE SPOT

1022
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THAT TAKES THE WORST OF IT.

1023
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WINDS 20 TO 50 MILES AN HOUR.

1024
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
STILL MORE RAIN HERE.

1025
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
FLOODING.

1026
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
THE TURKS AND CAICOS, IT WILL

1027
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
GET THERE CLOSE TONIGHT AND

1028
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
TOMORROW.
THAT SAID, WE'RE WATCHING

1029
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
TROPICAL STORM JOSE.

1030
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
UP HERE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.

1031
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THAT HAS CREATED A WEAKNESS IN

1032
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THE ATMOSPHERE.
IT'S GOING TO ALLOW MARIA TO

1033
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
MOVE TO THE NORTH.

1034
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR RELIABLE

1035
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
COMPUTER GUIDANCE RIGHT NOW,

1036
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
PULLS THIS UP BETWEEN BERMUDA

1037
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
AND THE U.S.

1038
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

1039
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
GOING TO STAY BETWEEN THAT AREA.

1040
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
IT'S A SLOW-MOVING STORM.

1041
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

1042
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
A WEEK OR SO BEFORE IT GETS INTO

1043
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
THIS AREA.
MORE PROBLEMS FOR THE COAST.

1044
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
CERTAINLY BEACH EROSION.

1045
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AS LONG AS WE THREAT THIS NEEDLE

1046
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE EAST

1047
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
COAST, I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING

1048
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
GOOD.
THE OFFICIAL TRACK FROM THE

1049
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SHOWS

1050
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THAT.
KEEPING THIS WELL OFFSHORE AND

1051
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THEN EVENTUALLY BY THURSDAY TO

1052
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
FRIDAY OUT TO SEE.

1053
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
ANY BIG IMPACTS ACROSS THE U.S.

1054
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
WON'T BE FELT.

1055
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
>> Shepard: FINGERS CROSSED.

1056
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THANKS, RICK.

1057
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
OFFICIALS IN FLORIDA HAVE

1058
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
CONFIRMED A TENTH PERSON FROM A

1059
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
NURSING HOME THERE HAS DIED

1060
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
AFTER HURRICANE IRMA KNOCKED OUT

1061
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
AIR CONDITIONING IN THE BUILDING

1062
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
FOR THREE DAYS.

1063
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE SUSPENDING

1064
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
THAT CENTER'S LICENSE SAYING

1065
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
WORKERS ACTED WITH GROSS MEDICAL

1066
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
AND CRIMINAL RECKLESSNESS.

1067
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL 911 WHEN

1068
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
THE TEMPERATURES SOARED INTO THE

1069
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
TRIPLE DIGIT AND ELDERLY PEOPLE

1070
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
LEFT TO COOK.

1071
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So he took Aleve this morning.

1072
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
If he'd taken Tylenol,

1073
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
he'd be stopping for
more pills right now.

1074
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Only Aleve has the
strength to stop tough pain

1075
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
for up to 12 hours
with just one pill.

1076
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Tylenol can't do that.

1077
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Aleve. All Day Strong.
All Day Long.

1078
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Also try Aleve
Direct Therapy with

1079
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
TENS technology for
lower back pain relief.

1080
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
(AVO)it off with Contrave.

1081
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It's FDA-approved
to help adults who

1082
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
are overweight or

1083
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
struggle with obesity.

1084
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
CONTRAVE is believed to work on
two areas of the brain:

1085
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Your hunger center...

1086
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm so hungry.

1087
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
(AVO) To reduce hunger. And your
reward system...

1088
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Ice cream.

1089
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
French fries.

1090
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
(AVO) To help control cravings.

1091
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
One ingredient in CONTRAVE may

1092
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
increase suicidal thoughts or
actions in some children, teens,

1093
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
and young adults in the
first few months.

1094
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Serious side effects are mood
changes like depression

1095
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and mania, seizures, increased
blood pressure or heart rate,

1096
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
liver damage, glaucoma, allergic
reactions and hypoglycemia.

1097
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Not for patients with

'Member that
accident I got in,

1185
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
with the pole, and I had to
make a claim and all that?

1186
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Is that whole thing
still draggin' on?

1187
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No, I took some pics with
the app and filed a claim,

1188
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But, you know how they send you
money to cover repairs and -

1189
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
-they took forever
to pay you, right?

1190
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
No, I got paid right away,

1191
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But, at the very end
of it all, my agent-

1192
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
-wouldn't even call
you back, right?

1193
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
No, she called to see
if I was happy,

1194
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But, if I wasn't happy
with my claim experience,

1195
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
for any reason...

1196
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
...they'd give me
my money back,

1197
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
no questions asked.

1198
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Can you believe that?

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
No.

1214
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
FACEBOOK REPORTS THEY WILL

1215
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
HAPPENED OVER THE ADS.

1216
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
LET'S BRING IN CHAD DAY FROM THE

1217
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
ASSOCIATED PRESS.

1218
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
THIS IS A REVERSAL ON FACEBOOK'S

1219
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
PART.

1220
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
ZUCKERBERG IS SAYING WE HAVE TO

1221
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
DO THIS, IT'S VITAL FOR THE

1222
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
NATION AND ALL OF YOU OTHER

1223
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
MEDIA COMPANIES YOU NEED TO DO

1224
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
THE SAME THING.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1225
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
SO THIS IS A BIG REVERSAL FOR

1226
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
THEM.

1227
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
PREVIOUSLY THEY DECIDED THEY

1228
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WEREN'T GOING TO TURN OVER THE

1229
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
CONTENTS OF THE ADS THAT THEY

1230
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
TRACED BACK TO RUSSIAN FIRMS

1231
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
THAT WRITE POLITICAL, ON TOPICS

1232
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THAT WERE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL

1233
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
ISSUES TARGETED DURING THE

1234
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
CAMPAIGN.
A BIG TOPIC OF INTEREST FOR THE

1235
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
COMMITTEES AND LEADERS OF THE

1236
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
HAD BEEN TURNING OVER FOR THEM

1237
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
TO TURN OVER THE CONTENTS TO ARE

1238
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
YOU VERY THEM AND SEE IF THE ADS

1239
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
WERE TARGETED AT SPECIFIC

1240
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
GROUPS.
>> AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN

1241
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
TARGETED TOWARDS SPECIFIC

1242
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
GROUPS, WHETHER SOMEBODY LED THE

1243
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
RUSSIANS TOWARD THAT.

1244
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
THAT IS THE HEART OF THIS

1245
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
INVESTIGATION, IS IT NOT?

1246
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AS THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE

1247
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
LOOKING AT THE RUSSIAN

1248
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION BUT

1249
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS
ANYBODY ON THE AMERICAN SIDE TO

1250
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
DIRECT WHERE THE ADS WOULD BE

1251
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
TARGETED.
ONE OF THE MAIN THING THEY'RE

1252
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
LOOKING AT, IF THEY'RE TARGETED

1253
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
AT SPECIFIC GROUPS THAT COULD

1254
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
DECREASE VOTER TURNOUT FOR

1255
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
HILLARY CLINTON OR INCREASE

1256
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
TURNOUT FOR TRUMP.

1257
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
SO WHAT THE COMMITTEES

1258
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
PARTICULARLY LOOKED AT, THAT'S

1259
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
SOMETHING THAT AN AMERICAN

1260
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
POLITICAL OPERATIVE WOULD KNOW.

1261
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
SO THAT'S OF PARTICULAR INTEREST

1262
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
TO THEM AND LOOKING FOR WHETHER

1263
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
THERE WAS ANY COORDINATION

1264
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

1265
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
RUSSIANS IS PART OF THIS RUSSIAN

1266
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
INTERFERENCE.
SO FAR THE COMMITTEES HAVE SAID

1267
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE OF

1268
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
COORDINATION BUT THEY HAVEN'T

1269
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
SAID ANYTHING CONCLUSIVELY.

1270
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
>> Shepard: WHICH TAKES US BACK

1271
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
TO PAUL MANAFORT WHO WAS WITH

1272
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THE CAMPAIGN FOR A SHORT PERIOD

1273
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
OF TIME.
AT ANY RATE, IT'S CLEAR TO

1274
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
INVESTIGATORS THAT HE OFFERED A

1275
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
PRIVATE BRIEFING TO A RUSSIAN

1276
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
BILLIONAIRE WITH CLOSE TIES TO

1279
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
>> RIGHT.

1280
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000

00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
BRIEFING FOR A RUSSIAN

1282
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
BILLIONAIRE WHO HAS BEEN

00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
DESCRIBED AS BEING CLOSE TO

1284
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
PUTIN.
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

1285
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
DESCRIBED IN AN E-MAIL BETWEEN

1286
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
POWELL MANAFORT AND A FORMER

1287
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
WORKER OR FORMER EMPLOYEE OF HIS

1288
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000

1290
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
IN THE UKRAINE.

1291
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW -- WHAT WE

1292
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
DON'T KNOW YET, A LOT WE DON'T

1293
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000

00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,000
THAT OFFER WENT TO THE RUSSIANS.

1295
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000

1297
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
BRIEFINGS THAT OCCURRED OR

00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
WHETHER THIS OFFER WAS ACTUALLY

1299
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
PASSED TO THE RUSSIANS.

1300
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE

1301
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
E-MAILS ARE LEGITIMATE AND

1302
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
ROBERT MUELLER HAS THEM IN HIS

00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
POSSESSION AS WELL AS

1304
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.

1305
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
THEY'LL LOOK AT THIS WHEN THEY

1306
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
LOOK AT DIRECT TIES OR LINKS

1307
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND

1308
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
RUSSIANS.
>> Shepard: THE BIG PICTURE

1309
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
QUESTION, WAS SOMEONE WITHIN THE

1310
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000

1311

WHERE TO PLACE THE ADS TO HELP

1312
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
DONALD TRUMP GET ELECTED AND

1313
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
HURT HILLARY CLINTON'S CHANCES

1314
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
TO THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE

1315
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
ANSWER.

1316
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
BUT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS

1317
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
WORKING ON IT NOW.

1318
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
CHAD DAY FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS.

1319
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000

1322
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Track tuned handling,
and aggressive styling.

1323
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000

1324
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000

Experience Amazing at
your Lexus dealer.

1326
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
You totaNobody's hurt, new car.

1327
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
but there will still be pain.

1328
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
It comes when your insurance
company says they'll only pay

1329
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
three-quarters of what
it takes to replace it.

1330
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
What are you supposed to do?

1331
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Drive three-quarters of a car?

1332
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Now if you had Liberty Mutual
New Car Replacement™,

1333
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you'd get your whole car back.

1334
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I guess they don't want you
driving around on three wheels.

1335
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Smart.

1336
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000

1347
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000

1349
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000

TEN OF THEM HIT ALL-TIME HIGHS

1359
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS.

1360
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000

MANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS IN BOTH

EVER SINCE NORTH KOREA STARTED

AGITATING WITH A NUCLEAR FUTURE,

1369
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
THE PRESIDENTS GOING BACK TO
