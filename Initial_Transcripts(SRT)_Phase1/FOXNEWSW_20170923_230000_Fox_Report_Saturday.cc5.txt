[000:04:14;354] SUPPORT.

[000:04:43;149] THING THAT IS DOMINATING THE
[000:04:44;350] CONVERSATION THERE IS THIS
[000:04:45;051] GROWING FEUD BETWEEN THE
[000:04:45;785] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[000:04:48;021] AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST ATHLETES
[000:04:49;322] IN THE USA.
[000:04:51;024] RICK.
[000:04:51;324] RICK: WILL HAVE MORE ON NORTH

[000:04:59;766] THIS NFL, NBA CONTROVERSY.
[000:05:01;401] WILL GO TO LEGENDARY TV
[000:05:03;970] SPORTSCASTER WARNER WOLF.
[000:05:05;805] WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US
[000:05:09;475] TONIGHT.
[000:05:09;909] >> THANK YOU, RICK.
[000:05:10;443] I ALWAYS ENJOY YOUR WORK IN THE
[000:05:14;080] FIELD FOR ALL THESE YEARS.
[000:05:16;582] RICK: I APPRECIATE THAT, WARNER.
[000:05:17;450] WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO WHAT IS
[000:05:18;918] GOING ON BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:20;186] AND THESE PRO SPORTS LEAGUES
[000:05:21;087] COURSEWORK.
[000:05:21;554] >> FIRST OF ALL, IT IS OKAY TO
[000:05:23;890] PROTEST.
[000:05:24;223] THE PROBLEM IS WHERE.
[000:05:28;127] IT IS WHERE.
[000:05:28;561] YOU DON'T PROTEST USING A STAGE
[000:05:31;164] EXPLOITING THE PLACE WHERE YOU
[000:05:35;935] WORK.
[000:05:36;235] IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
[000:05:37;036] THEY WANT TO PROTEST, FINE, GO
[000:05:40;106] AHEAD BUT DO IT ON YOUR OWN TIME
[000:05:41;541] AND IN YOUR OWN FACILITY.
[000:05:45;378] NOT THE STAGE AND PLATFORM WHERE
[000:05:48;014] YOU WORK.
[000:05:48;381] THESE GUYS ARE BEING PAID
[000:05:49;549] MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PLAY AND
[000:05:51;317] NOT TO USE IT FOR ANOTHER
[000:05:53;653] ASPECT.
[000:05:53;986] THAT IS WRONG.
[000:05:59;792] RICK: WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE
[000:06:01;160] LEAGUE OF THESE KIND OF PROTESTS
[000:06:02;462] CONTINUE?
[000:06:02;829] IS THERE A RISK TO THE LEAGUE?
[000:06:04;130] >> IT DEPENDS ON THE FANS.
[000:06:07;200] IF THE FANS WALK OUT AND IT ALSO
[000:06:08;735] DEPENDS ON THE TV RATINGS AND IF
[000:06:10;370] THEY GO DOWN, WELL, MAYBE ROGER
[000:06:15;007] COULD OUT WILL TAKE A STAND.
[000:06:16;075] HE HAS CERTAINLY DIDN'T TODAY,
[000:06:17;143] THAT'S FOR SURE.
[000:06:18;711] RICK: BACK TO THE NBA FOR A
[000:06:20;113] MOMENT, THE WARRIORS RELEASED A
[000:06:21;214] STATEMENT THAT READ:  CLEARLY,
[000:06:33;226] THE TEAM IS STANDING TOGETHER ON
[000:06:34;460] THIS POINT AND REAL QUICK LEBRON
[000:06:39;165] JAMES ALSO WEIGHED IN AMONG
[000:06:40;133] OTHER ATHLETES AND HE CALLED THE
[000:06:41;634] PRESIDENT A BUM.
[000:06:42;235] HE SAID YOU BOMB, HE ALREADY
[000:06:45;905] SAID HE AIN'T GOING SO EIGHT NO
[000:06:48;307] INVITE.
[000:06:48;641] GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS AN
[000:06:49;742] HONOR UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP.
[000:06:53;546] SPEAKING OF COURSE, ABOUT THE
[000:06:54;547] PRESIDENT.
[000:06:54;981] >> FIRST OF ALL, THE LAWYERS HAD
[000:07:00;186] THE SUPPORT OF A STEPH CURRY
[000:07:03;055] STANDS.
[000:07:03;389] THAT IS WHY THEY ARE NOT GOING.
[000:07:04;657] IF STEPH CURRY HAD SAID HE GO,
[000:07:10;897] THEY ALL WOULD HAVE GONE.
[000:07:11;831] IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
[000:07:12;598] TOM BRADY DIDN'T SHOW UP WHEN
[000:07:13;933] OBAMA WAS THE PRESIDENT.
[000:07:14;700] SO WHAT?
[000:07:22;742] THEY ARE JUST BALLPLAYERS.
[000:07:23;409] IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
[000:07:24;076] TO ME, THE INTERESTING AND AS
[000:07:25;144] FAR AS BEING INVITED AND THEN
[000:07:26;412] WITHDRAWN, IF YOU INVITED
[000:07:27;346] SOMEONE TO A PARTY AND THEY SAID
[000:07:28;648] WE DON'T WANT TO COME SO YOU SAY
[000:07:30;349] DON'T COME, I'LL TAKE THE INVITE
[000:07:31;751] BACK.
[000:07:32;051] LOOK, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
[000:07:33;119] THE OTHER THING IS -- YEAH.
[000:07:42;829] RICK: I HAVE TO BELIEVE ALL
[000:07:43;930] THESE YEARS OF PRESIDENTS
[000:07:44;697] INVITING TEAMS TO THE WHITE
[000:07:45;531] HOUSE THAT THERE WERE PLAYERS ON
[000:07:46;699] THIS TEAM THAT DIDN'T SUPPORT
[000:07:47;767] THAT PARTICULAR PRESIDENT BUT
[000:07:48;534] THEY SHOWED UP ANYWAY AND NOW
[000:07:49;735] THIS THING HAS BEEN TURNED ON
[000:07:50;703] ITS HEAD.
[000:07:51;137] >> YES, TO ME, RICK, THE
[000:07:52;071] INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE
[000:07:53;105] PLAYERS WHO DISRESPECT THE FLAG
[000:07:58;311] AND THE INCOME THOSE ARE THE TWO
[000:07:59;512] SYMBOLS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT
[000:08:01;547] TO FREE SPEECH AND DISRESPECT
[000:08:05;084] AND SAY WHAT THEY WANT.
[000:08:10;556] THEY ARE STEPPING ON THE HAND
[000:08:11;757] THAT FEEDS THEM.
[000:08:12;258] I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
[000:08:15;094] I WAS IN THE SERVICE AS HUNDREDS
[000:08:16;496] OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE AND
[000:08:20;333] SOMEWHERE IN COMBAT, FORCE.
[000:08:21;033] HEY, THE FLAG AND THE ANTHEM
[000:08:24;570] WERE VERY IMPORTANT.
[000:08:25;137] THEY REPRESENTED THE COUNTRY
[000:08:29;976] AND, AS I SAID, THE RIGHT TO
[000:08:31;577] FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
[000:08:32;278] THESE GUYS ARE COMPLAINING AND
[000:08:35;481] THAT IS THE RIGHT TO GIVE THEM
[000:08:38;117] THE SPEECH AGAIN, TO ME, THEY
[000:08:43;089] ARE QUICK.
[000:08:43;489] THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN A
[000:08:44;690] PROTEST FINE, NOTHING WRONG WITH
[000:08:45;625] THAT BUT DON'T DO IT ON MY TIME
[000:08:47;293] IN MY PLACE.
[000:08:47;927] RICK: WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME
[000:08:51;731] TONIGHT, WARNER.
[000:08:52;231] SURE WE'RE NOT HEARD THE LAST OF
[000:08:56;636] THIS.
[000:09:12;084] >> THANK YOU.

[000:22:58;402] IN HIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TALK WAS
[000:23:00;437] REALLY TO MAKE CLAIM FOR THE
[000:23:02;539] REST OF THE WORLD HOW DANGEROUS
[000:23:05;242] THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME HAS BEEN
[000:23:06;309] FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT WE HAVE
[000:23:09;146] ALLOWED THE WORLD TO BE HIJACKED
[000:23:14;184] BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS
[000:23:14;918] OF THAT REGIME AND WHAT THE US
[000:23:18;388] PRESIDENT SAYING WE WILL NOT
[000:23:23;093] ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, I
[000:23:24;161] THINK, WERE SEEN THE ERRATIC AND
[000:23:25;295] DESPERATE NATURE OF THAT REGIME.
[000:23:33;270] IT'S NOT RATCHETED UP MORE BUT I
[000:23:34;704] THINK IT IS GETTING CLARIFIED
[000:23:35;739] FOR EVERYONE HOW DANGEROUS THIS
[000:23:36;740] REGIME HAS BEEN FOR A VERY LONG
[000:23:41;344] TIME.
[000:23:41;645] RICK: THE UN KEEPS PASSING
[000:23:42;412] STRICTER AND STRICTER SANCTIONS
[000:23:43;146] IN THE PRESIDENT IS SQUEEZING
[000:23:43;847] THE REGIME ECONOMICALLY AND SO
[000:23:44;681] FAR THAT HASN'T SEEMED TO
[000:23:46;149] MATTER.
[000:23:46;550] >> GIVE IT SOME TIME AND THE
[000:23:51;121] NORTH KOREANS ARE USED TO THE
[000:23:52;589] WORLD NOT RESPONDING TO
[000:23:54;090] SANCTIONS BUT WE HAVE THE
[000:23:55;926] CHINESE MORE ON BOARD THAT AT
[000:23:59;229] ANY POINT DURING THIS NUCLEAR
[000:24:01;898] CRISIS AND MISSILE CRISIS THEN
[000:24:04;067] HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR MANY
[000:24:06;136] YEARS.
[000:24:06;436] IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT.
[000:24:09;806] THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW IT AND
[000:24:12;175] THE PATHWAY TO DENUCLEARIZE IN
[000:24:16;279] THE PENINSULA HAS TO START WITH
[000:24:17;581] THE ECONOMIC WEAPON.
[000:24:18;181] I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE
[000:24:21;384] STATEMENT ISSUED BY SENATOR BEN
[000:24:25;021] SASS IN RECENT DAYS IN WHICH HE
[000:24:29;092] IS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE
[000:24:29;826] BANKING SUBCOMMITTEE SAID THE
[000:24:31;661] ECONOMIC WEAPON IS AN IMPORTANT
[000:24:32;596] WEAPON FOR THE NORTH KOREANS AND
[000:24:37;701] FOR THE CHINESE AND FOR OTHERS
[000:24:38;869] TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE DON'T WANT
[000:24:40;103] THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE IN THE
[000:24:41;238] REGION.
[000:24:41;571] THERE IS A KIND OF COALESCING
[000:24:44;074] BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION
[000:24:44;808] BOTH IN WASHINGTON AND AMONG
[000:24:49;246] INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND THAT
[000:24:49;980] WAS DEMONSTRATED AT THE UNITED
[000:24:51;481] NATIONS.
[000:24:51;815] RICK: SURE, BUT NORTH KOREA IS
[000:24:55;318] NOW PROMISING TO TEST A HYDROGEN
[000:24:57;220] BOMB OVER THE OCEAN AND IT
[000:24:58;355] SAYING THAT THE PENTAGON THROUGH
[000:25:01;491] BOMBERS AND JETS WELL NORTH OF
[000:25:05;061] THE PENINSULA AND IT SEEMS AS IF
[000:25:06;363] WE ARE STILL ON A COLLISION
[000:25:07;664] COURSE FOR SOME KIND OF MILITARY
[000:25:10;967] ACTION.
[000:25:11;368] >> YES, WE DON'T WANT TO GO IN
[000:25:14;070] THAT DIRECTION AND WE KNOW THAT
[000:25:15;772] THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM,
[000:25:19;910] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HAS SAID
[000:25:20;710] IT IS PREPARED FOR THE WHOLE
[000:25:22;045] RANGE OF RESPONSES AND OUR
[000:25:23;947] SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DOES NOT
[000:25:24;948] WANT TO SEE MILITARY RETALIATION
[000:25:31;821] BUT WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND I
[000:25:33;156] DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE MILITARY
[000:25:34;124] AND THE AGGRESSIVE MILITARY
[000:25:35;258] ACTIVITY OF THE NORTH KOREAN
[000:25:36;293] REGIME AND KIM JONG-UN ARE A
[000:25:40;130] RESPONSE OR DUE TO PRESIDENT
[000:25:40;830] TRUMP.
[000:25:41;131] THIS HAS BEEN COMING FOR A LONG
[000:25:42;198] TIME.
[000:25:42;499] IN FACT, WE COULD ARGUE THAT HE
[000:25:45;502] HAS BEEN, HE HAS BEEN SO
[000:25:48;672] CONDITIONED TO A LACK OF
[000:25:49;706] RESPONSE BY THE WEST IN THE
[000:25:52;309] UNITED STATES THAT HE HAS GOT TO
[000:25:55;545] RECALIBRATE TO THE REALITY OF A
[000:25:58;014] MUCH MORE AND DEEPLY RESOLVED
[000:25:58;848] REGIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND
[000:26:00;584] THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING.
[000:26:10;260] RICK: EVEN IF THESE LUNCHES WERE
[000:26:11;361] PLANNED, WITH ALL OF THESE
[000:26:12;429] WARNINGS AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS
[000:26:13;163] BEING PUT IN PLACE, WHY WOULDN'T
[000:26:14;431] HE CANCEL THEM?
[000:26:16;066] >> I THINK HE IS STILL TESTING,
[000:26:17;367] FRANKLY.
[000:26:17;701] HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH,
[000:26:23;573] IN THE ASIAN REGION AND AROUND
[000:26:24;774] THE WORLD, HE HAS BEEN ISOLATED
[000:26:25;909] AND SEEN AS THE BIG FORCE OF
[000:26:28;211] TENSION IN HIS OWN REGION, ON
[000:26:30;080] THE PENINSULA OR CHINA FOR
[000:26:33;583] EVERYONE.
[000:26:33;950] HE'S NOT HAD TO THINK LIKE THAT
[000:26:35;352] BEFORE.
[000:26:35;685] THIS IS A REAL PARADIGM CHANGE,
[000:26:39;556] BOTH FOR THE WORLD, FOR NORTH
[000:26:40;690] KOREA, FOR THE CHINESE AND AN
[000:26:46;963] INSTANCE OF AN UNUSUAL AMERICAN

[000:34:25;755] REPEAL AND REPLACE PRETTY
[000:34:26;389] AGGRESSIVELY AND THAT THE
[000:34:27;023] ARIZONA GOVERNOR SUPPORTS THE
[000:34:27;890] BILL AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT
[000:34:29;725] MCCAIN WILL HAVE TO LET ARIZONA
[000:34:32;228] DOWN.
[000:34:34;230] >> THERE IS CERTAINLY NO LOVE
[000:34:35;231] LOST BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND
[000:34:36;265] SENATOR MCCAIN AS WE KNOW THEIR
[000:34:37;900] HISTORY STRETCHES BACK TO THE
[000:34:40;136] CAMPAIGN WHEN THEN CANDIDATE
[000:34:45;141] TRUMP WAS PERCEIVED BY MANY
[000:34:46;142] PEOPLE TO DISPARAGE SENATOR
[000:34:46;843] MCCAIN'S WRAPPER DURING THE
[000:34:47;844] VIETNAM WAR.
[000:34:49;946] SETTING THAT ASIDE, FOR A SECOND
[000:34:51;047] RICK, IT IS ACTUALLY A TRUE
[000:34:53;483] STATEMENT TO POINT OUT THAT
[000:34:54;250] SENATOR MCCAIN DID INDEED
[000:34:57;053] CAMPAIGN TO LEAD THE FIGHT
[000:34:57;854] AGAINST OBAMACARE IS ONE OF HIS
[000:34:58;855] CAMPAIGN IN 2016 SO IN THAT
[000:35:02;024] PERSPECTIVE AT LEAST THE
[000:35:05;461] PRESIDENT DOES HAVE A VALID
[000:35:09;332] POINT.
[000:35:09;632] RICK: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM IS
[000:35:10;433] THAT THEY HAVE CONTROL OF THE
[000:35:11;467] SENATE AND HOUSE AND WHY CAN'T
[000:35:12;635] THEY GET THIS DONE?
[000:35:13;436] >> I THINK, BECAUSE ULTIMATELY
[000:35:14;504] NO PROPOSAL THEY HAVE PUT FORTH
[000:35:16;772] YET HAS SEEMED PARTICULARLY
[000:35:17;673] POPULAR WITH THE BROADER
[000:35:19;208] POPULATION AND THIS IS THE
[000:35:22;945] POLITICS ARE COMPENSATED BECAUSE
[000:35:26;449] AMONG THE SUPPORTERS OF THE
[000:35:27;550] RUBBLE CAN PARTY IT IS
[000:35:29;919] IMPERATIVE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE
[000:35:33;189] BUT WHEN YOU TEST ALL THE
[000:35:34;524] ALTERNATIVES THEY HAVE PUT FORTH
[000:35:35;424] IN THE GENERAL POPULATION THEY
[000:35:38;628] FRANKLY AREN'T THAT POPULAR AND
[000:35:39;462] THEREFORE THERE IS A FEAR THAT
[000:35:43;132] PASSING ANY OF THESE EFFORTS TO
[000:35:44;267] REPEAL OBAMACARE WILL CARRY A
[000:35:47;503] POLITICAL COST.
[000:35:50;373] RICK: THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID
[000:35:51;140] THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR BETTER
[000:35:52;308] CONTROL IN MANAGEMENT IN
[000:35:53;843] HEALTHCARE BUT MCCAIN IS
[000:35:54;577] APPARENTLY NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
[000:35:55;611] DISAGREES WITH THAT.
[000:35:58;214] >> YES, THAT IS RIGHT.
[000:35:58;814] THERE IS CLEARLY SOME CONCERN.
[000:36:02;718] FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MENTIONED IN
[000:36:05;054] THE REPORT THAT SENATOR FROM
[000:36:09;392] ALASKA IS ON THE FENCE AND HER
[000:36:10;626] GOVERNOR HAS COME OUT AGAINST
[000:36:12;662] THIS BILL.
[000:36:13;029] RAND PAUL, SENATOR FROM
[000:36:13;729] KENTUCKY, IS AGAINST IT AND
[000:36:18;434] THERE ARE CONCERNS AND BEYOND
[000:36:19;435] THE POLITICAL REALM THERE ARE
[000:36:20;670] CONCERNS FROM ALL KINDS OF
[000:36:21;470] MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE
[000:36:25;708] ALSO OPPOSED TO THIS CURRENT
[000:36:26;542] PROPOSAL.
[000:36:26;909] RICK: DESPITE KNOWING THAT THEY
[000:36:27;677] HAVE THESE ISSUES -- AND HAVING
[000:36:30;980] THE TIME TO PUT A BILL TOGETHER
[000:36:32;481] THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
[000:36:33;549] DO IT AND NOW WE ARE HEARING
[000:36:36;819] FROM SENATOR MCCAIN THE RUBBLE
[000:36:37;787] CAN THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO WORK
[000:36:41;691] TOGETHER ON A BETTER BILL BUT WE
[000:36:45;061] HAVEN'T SEEN ANY INDICATION THAT
[000:36:46;095] THAT IS REMOTELY POSSIBLE.
[000:36:46;829] >> THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT.
[000:36:47;496] THERE IS NO WAY THAT DEMOCRATS
[000:36:48;264] ARE GOING TO WORK FOR A FULL
[000:36:50;499] REPEAL OF WHAT THEY SEE AS
[000:36:54;270] PRESIDENT BUT OBAMA'S SIGNATURE
[000:36:55;104] ACHIEVEMENT.
[000:36:55;504] THERE MAY BE SOME TINKERING
[000:36:57;340] AROUND THE EDGES BUT TO CIRCLE
[000:37:03;546] BACK TO YOUR POINT YOU MADE,
[000:37:04;513] RICK, I SUSPECT YOUR REPUBLICAN
[000:37:05;481] VOTERS WILL PLACE A LOT OF BLAME
[000:37:06;882] ON REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN
[000:37:08;551] CONGRESS RATHER THAN PRESIDENT
[000:37:09;285] TRUMP BECAUSE THEY WILL LOOK AT
[000:37:11;220] THIS PROMISE THAT WAS MADE FOR
[000:37:13;789] SEVEN YEARS, YES, BUT FOR US WE
[000:37:15;458] WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE
[000:37:17;593] OBAMACARE BUT THEY GOT WHAT THEY
[000:37:19;195] WANTED WHICH WAS THE MAJORITIES
[000:37:20;296] IN BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS AND
[000:37:21;664] THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY STILL
[000:37:22;865] HAVEN'T DONE IT.
[000:37:23;733] RICK: WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

[000:38:29;265] BECAUSE BANNON THANKS THAT JUDGE
[000:38:30;266] ROY MOORE IS BETTER SUITED TO

[000:38:43;979] TIGHT WITH MITCH MCCONNELL BUT
[000:38:45;047] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT IS NOT
[000:38:46;649] RIGHT.
[000:38:48;284] >> THE THING WITH THIS IS HE
[000:38:51;420] DOESN'T KNOW MITCH MCCONNELL.
[000:38:52;154] HE WAS THERE FOR A FEW MONTHS
[000:38:59;328] AND THEY PUT THAT MANTLE AROUND
[000:39:00;629] HIS NECK AND I TOLD MITCH I
[000:39:02;064] WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS.

[000:39:05;568] MCCONNELL AT ALL.

[000:39:10;306] OF GETTING RID OF SENATOR

[000:39:14;343] AMONGST THEMSELVES FAILS AGAIN.

[000:39:22;251] PROGRESSIVELY IN WASHINGTON WE
[000:39:26;856] WILL LOOK AT EVERY OPTION,

[000:40:03;426] WHICHEVER REPUBLICAN IS UP ON
[000:40:04;427] THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER.

[000:41:21;871] THE ANGRY DEMONSTRATIONS ARE A
[000:41:22;771] REACTION TO A JUDGE'S DECISION

[000:43:29;064] THEM DOWN AND IT'S A MATTER OF

[000:44:22;718] I'm lucky to get through a

[000:44:24;386] Heads up!
[000:44:29;625] You know what, don't
[000:44:29;625] worry about it.
[000:44:31;427] My bargain detergent
[000:44:31;427] couldn't keep up.
[000:44:33;862] It was mostly water.
[000:44:35;364] So, I switched to Tide PODs.
[000:44:36;699] They're super concentrated,
[000:44:36;699] so I get a better clean.
[000:44:40;903] I mean, I give away
[000:44:40;903] water for free.
[000:44:43;372] I'm not about to pay for
[000:44:43;372] it in my detergent.
[000:44:45;708] Number one trusted.
[000:44:45;708] Number one awarded.
[000:44:48;110] It's got to be Tide

[000:45:01;690] drizzled with
[000:45:01;690] sweet amber honey,

[000:45:03;659] Mediterranean Shrimp
[000:45:05;561] finished with a savory blend
[000:45:07;129] of green onions,
[000:45:07;129] tomatoes, and herbs.
[000:45:09;398] Feeling hungry yet?
[000:45:11;066] Good, 'cause there's plenty
[000:45:11;066] more where these came from.
[000:45:13;202] Like Garlic Shrimp Scampi,
[000:45:14;937] and other classics you love.
[000:45:17;072] As much as you want,
[000:45:17;072] however you want them.
[000:45:18;941] But hurry, Endless Shrimp
[000:45:18;941] won't be here long.
[000:45:23;312] 83% try to eat healthy,
[000:45:23;312] however you want them.
[000:45:24;980] yet up to 90% fall short
[000:45:24;980] on getting key nutrients.
[000:45:27;583] Let's do more.
[000:45:28;784] One-A-Day 50 plus.

[000:45:38;894] for five days total.
[000:45:41;597] We lost a lot of food.
[000:45:42;831] We actually filed
[000:45:42;831] a claim with USAA
[000:45:44;600] to replace that spoiled food.
[000:45:46;101] And we really appreciated that
