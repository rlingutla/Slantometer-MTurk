[000:01:16;776] TODAY, YOU SAW IT ALL UNFOLD
[000:01:17;477] LIVE.
[000:01:20;413] POLICE MOVING IN WITH TEAR GAS,
[000:01:22;949] TRYING TO REMOVE PROTESTERS FROM
[000:01:24;284] ISTANBUL'S MAIN PUBLIC SQUARE.
[000:01:25;251] AND PROTESTERS FIGHTING BACK
[000:01:25;952] WITH GASOLINE BOMBS AND
[000:01:27;420] FIREWORKS.
[000:01:30;824] PROTESTS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN
[000:01:32;158] TURKEY FOR TWO WEEKS NOW.
[000:01:33;359] REMARKABLE NOT ONLY FOR THEIR
[000:01:34;561] SIZE AND FERVOR, BUT BECAUSE THE
[000:01:38;832] TARGET OF ALL THAT ANGER IS A
[000:01:41;534] THREE-TIME DEMOCRATICALLY
[000:01:42;168] ELECTED PRESIDENT.
[000:01:43;503] TODAY THINGS REACHED A WHOLE NEW
[000:01:44;237] LEVEL.
[000:01:45;071] IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL HAS BEEN

[000:01:49;075] ISTANBUL'S TAKSIM SQUARE WHERE
[000:01:51;511] AT THIS LATE HOUR, THE AIR IS
[000:01:55;381] APPARENTLY STILL THICK WITH TEAR
[000:01:56;116] GAS.
[000:01:56;616] RICHARD?
[000:01:58;818] >> Reporter: IT IS FULL OF TEAR
[000:02:02;922] GAS, AND THAT IS WHY I'M WEARING
[000:02:03;790] THIS MASK.
[000:02:04;624] THE CLASHES HERE ARE ONGOING.
[000:02:05;825] STILL, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AN
[000:02:11;164] ARAB SPRING MOMENT OR A TURNING
[000:02:11;898] POINT.
[000:02:13;867] BUT IF THESE CLASHES CONTINUE,
[000:02:15;335] IT COULD BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM
[000:02:17;103] FOR TURKEY, ONE OF THE MOST
[000:02:18;037] STABLE COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.
[000:02:21;574] POLICE MOVED IN AROUND 7:00
[000:02:23;510] A.M., AND SPARKED THE WORST
[000:02:25;311] CLASHES IN TURKEY IN A DECADE.
[000:02:28;715] POLICE USED TEAR GAS AND WATER
[000:02:29;449] CANNONS.

[000:02:37;924] ON FIRE AND THE POLICE PULLED
[000:02:38;625] BACK.
[000:02:39;726] THE PROTESTERS HERE ARE DIGGING
[000:02:41;294] IN, FORTIFYING THE SQUARE,
[000:02:43;129] BUILDING BARRICADES, PREPARING
[000:02:45;298] FOR A DRAWN OUT STRUGGLE WITH
[000:02:46;633] THE GOVERNMENT.
[000:02:48;101] THIS PROTEST HAS BEEN GOING ON
[000:02:49;302] NOW FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS.
[000:02:53;907] IT STARTED AS AN EFFORT TO SAVE
[000:02:56;442] THIS PARK, BUT IT'S WELL BEYOND
[000:02:57;177] THAT NOW.
[000:02:59;245] THE DEMONSTRATORS COMPLAIN OF
[000:02:59;946] POLICE BRUTALITY.
[000:03:03;950] AND THAT PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN
[000:03:05;885] IS IMPOSING AN ISLAMIC AGENDA IN
[000:03:06;619] SECULAR TURKEY.
[000:03:08;688] >> OUR PRIME MINISTER IS A
[000:03:09;989] DICTATOR, LIKE HITLER, LIKE
[000:03:10;657] MUSSOLINI.
[000:03:12;525] >> THEY'RE TRYING TO LIMIT OUR
[000:03:14;360] RIGHTS OF LIBERTY AND SHOWING
[000:03:17;130] OUR IDEAS.
[000:03:19;098] >> Reporter: BY EVENING, TAKSIM

[000:03:23;703] DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTING AGAINST
[000:03:24;671] PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN.
[000:03:27;807] IT SEEMED LIKE THE VIOLENCE WAS
[000:03:28;541] OVER.
[000:03:29;142] BUT IT TURNED AGAIN.
[000:03:30;710] SUDDENLY IN THE BIGGEST
[000:03:31;444] CRACKDOWN OF THE DAY.
[000:03:33;146] HUNDREDS OF RIOT POLICE AND
[000:03:34;347] THEIR VEHICLES CHARGED IN.
[000:03:37;850] THERE WAS A STAMPEDE AS
[000:03:39;419] PROTESTERS RUSHED TO ESCAPE.
[000:03:41;854] SOME FELL, SOME INJURED.
[000:03:46;459] FIRES, MORE TEAR GAS.
[000:03:49;462] >> IT'S BEING FIRED -- I DON'T
[000:03:50;930] WANT TO SAY AT RANDOM, BUT IT'S
[000:03:52;532] BEING FIRED WITH SUCH INTENSITY,
[000:03:54;334] IT'S EVEN COMING UP TO THE UPPER
[000:03:57;937] BALCONY OF WHAT ARE PRIVATE
[000:03:58;805] HOMES AND PRIVATE BUSINESSES.
[000:04:01;474] A DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN TO
[000:04:02;442] TAKE BACK THE SQUARE.
[000:04:04;978] THIS IS NOW A CHALLENGE OVER THE
[000:04:05;945] NATURE OF THIS COUNTRY.
[000:04:08;348] ERDOGAN'S ISLAMIC DEMOCRACY.
[000:04:10;083] OR THE SECULAR TRADITION THE
[000:04:11;751] DEMONSTRATORS SAY THEY'RE
[000:04:12;385] DETERMINED TO DEFEND.
[000:04:16;623] MANY WATCHING EVENTS HERE

[000:04:20;593] ERDOGAN, AND SAY THIS CRACKDOWN
[000:04:21;928] IS SOMETHING THE PROTESTERS

[000:08:42;588] AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

[000:08:45;992] AND 90 DEGREE TEMPERATURES FOR
[000:08:46;726] TOMORROW.

[000:09:23;996] MOST COMMON FINANCIAL MISTAKES
[000:09:25;331] AMERICANS MAKE, OVERDRAWING FROM
[000:09:26;065] THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS.
[000:09:27;733] MAYBE FORGETTING THE MORTGAGE OR
[000:09:28;834] CAR PAYMENT IS ABOUT TO BE
[000:09:29;502] DEDUCTED.

[000:09:32;238] GROCERIES OR A CUP OF COFFEE.
[000:09:34;307] SOON THERE'S AN EXTRA $30 OR
[000:09:35;374] MORE TO COUGH UP.
[000:09:37;577] SINCE 2010, CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE
[000:09:38;878] WANTED THEIR BANKS TO COVER
[000:09:43;249] THEIR OVERDRAFTS HAVE HAD TO OPT
[000:09:44;183] IN FOR THE COVERAGE.
[000:09:45;318] NOW THE GOVERNMENT REPORTS THOSE
[000:09:46;052] OVERDRAFT FEES MAKE UP A
[000:09:47;253] STAGGERING 60% OF ALL BANK FEE
[000:09:48;087] REVENUE.
[000:09:49;789] $32 BILLION A YEAR.

[000:09:56;062] >> WE'RE CONCERNED THAT
[000:10:01;000] CONCERNED THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF
[000:10:03;035] OVERDRAFT PRACTICES MEAN THAT
[000:10:03;936] CONSUMERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
[000:10:04;904] ANTICIPATE AND AVOID UNNECESSARY
[000:10:05;638] CHARGES.
[000:10:07;139] >> Reporter: WHILE SOME BANKS
[000:10:08;007] LIMIT OVERDRAFT FEES TO TWO A
[000:10:08;741] DAY, OTHERS CHARGE AS MANY AS 12
[000:10:09;475] PER DAY.
[000:10:12;845] SOME BANKS CHARGE EVEN IF THE
[000:10:14;981] OVERDRAFT IS A PENNY.
[000:10:15;548] OTHERS DON'T CHARGE A FEE IF THE
[000:10:16;282] AMOUNT IS LESS THAN $5.
[000:10:17;049] IN 2011, THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER
[000:10:18;851] WHO PAID OVERDRAFT FEES, PAID
[000:10:21;253] $225 OVER THE COURSE OF THE
[000:10:21;921] YEAR.
[000:10:23;322] >> THE FINE PRINT IS VERY THICK

[000:10:32;398] IT'S PROTECTION AGAINST ANY
[000:10:33;065] OVERDRAFT.
[000:10:33;499] A LOT OF HIDDEN FEES COME BEHIND
[000:10:34;233] THIS PROTECTION.
[000:10:34;700] >> Reporter: WITHOUT OVERDRAFT
[000:10:36;035] PROTECTION, BANKS SIMPLY REFUSE
[000:10:37;003] TO PAY THE BILL.

[000:10:39;672] BANKING INDUSTRY INSISTS 20% OF
[000:10:42;208] ITS CUSTOMERS WANT EVEN DEPEND
[000:10:42;942] ON THE COVERAGE.
[000:10:44;644] >> MANY CONSUMERS NEED TO HAVE
[000:10:46;445] THIS PRODUCT TO MAKE ENDS MEET,
[000:10:48;748] TO PAY THE BILLS, WHETHER IT'S
[000:10:50;816] GROCERY STORES OR FILLING UP THE
[000:10:51;550] CAR WITH GAS.
[000:10:56;355] OR PAYING EVERYDAY EXPENSES AS
[000:10:57;089] WELL.
[000:10:57;590] >> TO AVOID PAYING THE FEES,
[000:10:58;691] EXPERTS SUGGEST READING THE FINE
[000:10:59;659] PRINT ON THE OPT-IN COVERAGE.
