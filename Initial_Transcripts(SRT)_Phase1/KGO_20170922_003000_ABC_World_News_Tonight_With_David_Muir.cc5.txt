[000:07:10;012] FARTHER NORTH AND INTO THE OPEN

[000:09:10;199] TAKING NEW STEPS TO ISOLATE KIM

[000:09:16;472] HAS TOLD THEIR OTHER BANKS --
[000:09:20;309] THAT'S A MASSIVE BANKING
[000:09:20;843] SYSTEM -- TO IMMEDIATELY STOP

[000:09:50;506] NORTH KOREA?
[000:09:51;307] >> WELL, I THINK THAT'S JUST
[000:09:51;907] COMMON SENSE.
[000:09:53;909] IF, FOR ANY REASON, NORTH KOREA
[000:09:58;581] ATTACKS THE UNITED STATES OR OUR

[000:10:13;396] MAKE HIM PAY DEARLY, THOSE WERE
[000:10:14;196] HIS WORDS, FOR HIS SPEECH AT THE
[000:10:14;830] U.N.
[000:10:16;299] AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,
[000:10:17;366] THERE'S A REAL EFFORT BY THE
[000:10:17;967] ADMINISTRATION TO TURN THE

[000:10:21;971] THERE'S A LOT MORE STILL TO BE
[000:10:22;605] DONE DIPLOMATICALLY.

[000:11:12;955] HILLARY CLINTON.
[000:11:16;592] MILLIONS OF AMERICANS SAW THEM,

[000:11:18;661] FACEBOOK HAS TO OWN UP TO THE

[000:11:37;480] >> Reporter: UNTIL TODAY,
[000:11:38;948] FACEBOOK REFUSED TO REVEAL WHO
[000:11:41;384] PAID FOR POLITICAL ADS.
[000:11:43;152] ZUCKERBERG SAYS THAT WILL NOW
[000:11:44;353] CHANGE.

[000:12:14;216] THE PICTURE WAS ACTUALLY OF
[000:12:15;251] SOMEONE IN BRAZIL.
[000:12:17;853] >> THAT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

[000:12:28;764] VOTERS THEY WERE TRYING TO

[000:12:31;834] THAT, AND SO FAR, THEY HAVE KEPT
[000:12:32;468] IT SECRET.

[000:16:55;664] Is that why
[000:16:55;664] you don't like them?
[000:16:57;066] Those boots could

[000:17:38;474] Before I hadburning,oting,
[000:17:39;341] pins-and-needles
[000:17:40;175] of diabetic nerve pain,
[000:17:41;944] these feet...
[000:17:42;845] Grew into a free-wheeling kid...
[000:17:44;780] Loved every step
[000:17:44;780] of fatherhood...
[000:17:46;615] And made old cars
[000:17:46;615] good as new.
[000:17:48;751] But I couldn't bear
[000:17:49;785] my diabetic nerve pain
[000:17:49;785] any longer.
[000:17:51;887] So I talked to my doctor
[000:17:53;188] and he prescribed LYRICA.
[000:17:54;857] Nerve damage from diabetes
[000:17:56;091] causes diabetic nerve pain.
[000:17:57;793] LYRICA is FDA approved
[000:17:59;361] to treat this pain,
[000:18:00;395] from moderate
[000:18:01;296] to even severe
[000:18:01;296] diabetic nerve pain.
[000:18:03;098] LYRICA may cause serious
[000:18:03;098] allergic reactions,
[000:18:05;601] suicidal thoughts or actions.
[000:18:07;169] Tell your doctor right away
[000:18:08;237] if you have these,
[000:18:09;037] new or worse depression,
[000:18:10;139] unusual changes
[000:18:10;139] in mood or behavior,
[000:18:12;107] swelling,
[000:18:12;107] trouble breathing,
[000:18:13;275] rash, hives, blisters,
[000:18:14;510] muscle pain with fever,
[000:18:15;511] tired feeling or blurry vision.
[000:18:17;112] Common side effects:
[000:18:18;147] dizziness, sleepiness,
[000:18:18;147] weight gain,
[000:18:19;581] swelling of hands,
[000:18:19;581] legs, and feet.
[000:18:21;150] Don't drink alcohol
[000:18:21;150] while taking LYRICA.
[000:18:23;085] Don't drive or use machinery
[000:18:24;453] until you know how
[000:18:24;453] LYRICA affects you.
[000:18:26;321] Those who've had a
[000:18:26;321] drug or alcohol problem
[000:18:28;190] may be more likely
[000:18:28;190] to misuse LYRICA.
[000:18:30;159] Now I have less
[000:18:30;159] diabetic nerve pain.
[000:18:32;694] And I love smoothing the road
[000:18:32;694] ahead for others.
[000:18:34;897] Ask your doctor about LYRICA.

[000:20:16;431] to create the future
[000:20:18;467] that's most meaningful to you.
[000:20:21;036] It's protection for generations

[000:20:28;243] harness all of that,
[000:20:31;613] That's the Power of Pacific.
[000:20:35;217] Ask a financial advisor
[000:20:35;217] about Pacific Life.
[000:20:39;454] my doctor recommended I
[000:20:39;454] switch laxatives.
[000:20:41;490] Stimulant Laxatives
[000:20:41;490] make your body go
[000:20:43;191] by forcefully stimulating the
[000:20:43;191] nerves in your colon.
[000:20:45;794] MiraLAX is different.
[000:20:46;862] It works with the
[000:20:46;862] water in your body
[000:20:48;230] to hydrate and soften.
[000:20:49;531] Unblocking your

[000:20:57;205] protect yourself.ary.
[000:20:59;775] What is scary?
[000:21:01;076] Pneumococcal pneumonia.
[000:21:02;878] It's a serious disease.
[000:21:04;379] My doctor said the risk is
[000:21:04;379] greater now that I'm over 50!
[000:21:09;451] Yeah...ya-ha...
[000:21:11;787] Just one dose of the PREVNAR 13®
[000:21:13;722] vaccine can help protect you
[000:21:15;090] from pneumococcal pneumonia-
[000:21:15;090] an illness that can cause
[000:21:17;559] coughing, chest pain,
[000:21:17;559] difficulty breathing,
[000:21:19;661] and may even put you
[000:21:19;661] in the hospital.
[000:21:21;530] PREVNAR 13® is approved for
[000:21:21;530] adults 18 and older to help
[000:21:24;599] prevent infections from
[000:21:24;599] 13 strains of the bacteria that
[000:21:27;269] cause pneumococcal pneumonia.
[000:21:28;670] You should not receive
[000:21:28;670] PREVNAR 13® if you have had
[000:21:30;639] a severe allergic reaction to
[000:21:30;639] the vaccine or its ingredients.
[000:21:33;642] If you have a weakened
[000:21:33;642] immune system,
[000:21:35;143] you may have a lower
[000:21:35;143] response to the vaccine.
[000:21:37;279] The most common side effects
[000:21:37;279] were pain, redness,
[000:21:39;514] and swelling at
[000:21:39;514] the injection site,
[000:21:40;983] limited arm movement, fatigue,
[000:21:42;651] headache, muscle pain,
[000:21:42;651] joint pain, less appetite,
[000:21:45;454] vomiting, fever, chills,
[000:21:45;454] and rash.
[000:21:47;389] Get this one done!
[000:21:48;924] Ask about PREVNAR 13®
[000:21:48;924] at your next visit to your
[000:21:51;326] doctor's office or pharmacy.
[000:21:55;163] 83% try to eat healthy,

[000:22:04;906] One-A-Day 50 plus.
[000:22:11;113] with moderate to severe
[000:22:11;113] rheumatoid arthritis?
[000:22:11;113] How do you chase what you love
[000:22:14;049] Do what I did.
[000:22:14;983] Ask your doctor about HUMIRA.
[000:22:18;387] It's proven to help relieve pain
[000:22:18;387] and protect joints
[000:22:20;856] from further irreversible damage
[000:22:20;856] in many adults.
[000:22:24;059] HUMIRA works by targeting
[000:22:24;059] and helping to block
[000:22:26;695] a specific source
[000:22:26;695] of inflammation
[000:22:28;697] that contributes to RA symptoms.
[000:22:30;699] HUMIRA has been clinically
[000:22:30;699] studied for over 20 years.
[000:22:34;436] HUMIRA can lower your ability
[000:22:34;436] to fight infections,
[000:22:36;571] including tuberculosis.
[000:22:38;373] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:22:38;373] infections and cancers,
[000:22:40;642] including lymphoma, have
[000:22:40;642] happened; as have blood, liver,
[000:22:43;378] and nervous system problems,
[000:22:43;378] serious allergic reactions,
[000:22:46;014] and new or worsening
[000:22:46;014] heart failure.
[000:22:48;183] Before treatment,
[000:22:48;183] get tested for TB.
[000:22:50;552] Tell your doctor
[000:22:50;552] if you've been to areas
[000:22:51;887] where certain fungal infections
[000:22:51;887] are common,
[000:22:54;022] and if you've had TB,
[000:22:54;022] hepatitis B,
[000:22:56;491] are prone to infections, or have
[000:22:56;491] flu-like symptoms or sores.
[000:22:59;928] Don't start HUMIRA if
[000:22:59;928] you have an infection.
[000:23:02;030] Ready for a new chapter?
[000:23:03;565] Talk to your rheumatologist

[000:23:59;988] THAT SUDDENLY HAD EVERYONE
[000:24:01;389] LOOKING UP.
[000:24:08;263] Growing up, we were German.
[000:24:09;998] We danced in a German dance
[000:24:09;998] group. I wore lederhosen.
[000:24:12;601] When I first got on Ancestry
[000:24:14;569] I was really surprised that
[000:24:15;804] I wasn't finding all of
[000:24:15;804] these Germans in my tree.
[000:24:19;674] I decided to have my DNA
[000:24:19;674] tested through Ancestry DNA.
[000:24:22;844] The big surprise was
[000:24:22;844] we're not German at all.
[000:24:25;413] 52% of my DNA comes from
[000:24:25;413] Scotland and Ireland.
[000:24:29;918] So, I traded in my
[000:24:29;918] lederhosen for a kilt.
