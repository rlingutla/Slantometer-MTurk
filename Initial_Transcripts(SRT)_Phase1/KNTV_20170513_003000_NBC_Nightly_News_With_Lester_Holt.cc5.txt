[000:09:01;874] >> WHEN I WAS A
[000:09:02;542] CANDIDATE, A LOT
[000:09:03;242] DIFFERENT THAN BEING

[000:09:04;777] WAS A CANDIDATE, WHAT
[000:09:05;545] HE DID, WHAT COMEY DID
[000:09:06;312] HAD GOOD MOMENTS FOR
[000:09:07;079] ME.
[000:09:09;615] AS A CANDIDATE.

[000:09:12;885] FOR THE COUNTRY
[000:09:13;553] NECESSARILY.
[000:09:14;820] I'M TALKING PURELY AS

[000:09:32;705] DELETE THEM, YOU RID
[000:09:34;006] OF THEM, ACID WASH
[000:09:35;608] THEM, WHEN HE DID ALL
[000:09:37;810] OF THAT STUFF, IT WAS
[000:09:38;678] DISGRACEFUL WHEN HE'S
[000:09:39;445] COVERING EVERYTHING
[000:09:40;179] POINT AFTER POINT.
[000:09:40;880] I WAS WITH LAWYERS
[000:09:41;614] WATCHING THAT.

[000:09:55;061] HERE, GUILTY, GUILTY.
[000:09:57;530] THEN HE GETS TO THE

[000:09:59;165] FREE AS A BIRD.
