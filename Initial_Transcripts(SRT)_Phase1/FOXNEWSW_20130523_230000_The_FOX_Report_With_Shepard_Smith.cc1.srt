HIS HANDS UP.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
THAT WAS GOOD.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
THANKS FOR INVITING US INTO

"SPECIAL REPORT."

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
FAIR, BALANCED AND STILL

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
UNAFRAID.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000

DEATH DECISION.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
THE JURORS SAY THEY HAVE

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
CASE.
PLUS, WHEN IS IT OKAY FOR

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
OUR GOVERNMENT TO KILL OUR

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
PEOPLE?

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA LAYING OUT

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
HIS POLICY.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
>> TECHNOLOGY RAISES

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
PROFOUND QUESTIONS.

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
>> DRONES HAVE BECOME A

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
MAJOR PART OF COUNTER

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
TERRORISM.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
AWAY OPERATORS CAN PULL THE

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
TRIGGER AND TAKE OUT A

TARGET.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
BUT WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
RULES FOR KILLING ENEMY OR

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
KILLING AMERICANS?

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
>> THE TARGETING OF ANY

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
AMERICAN RAISES

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
ARE NOT PRESENT IN OTHER

37
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
STRIKES.

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
>> TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
ON OUR MACHINES OF WAR.

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
ATTACK ON THE STREETS OF

41
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
LONDON.

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
TWO MEN ACCUSED OF HACKING

43
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A SOLDIER TO DEATH WITH

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
BUTCHER KNIVES AND A

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
MACHETE.

46
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
NOW YOU WILL MEET THE HERO

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
MOTHER WHO CONFRONTED THE

48
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
SUSPECTS SECONDS AFTER IT

49
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
ALL WENT DOWN.

50
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
>> I OKAY OBVIOUSLY A BIT

51
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
EXCITED.

SECURITY FORCES HAD
INVESTIGATED THESE GUYS IN

THE PAST.

55
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
AND AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN

56
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
BECOME THE OLDEST TO REACH

57
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THE TOP OF THE WORLD BUT

58
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
SOMEBODY ELSE COULD BREAK

59
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
HIS RECORD WITHIN DAYS.

60
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
TONIGHT BATTLE ATOP MOUNT

61
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
EVERY REST.

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
>> Shepard: BUT FIRST FROM

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
FOX THIS THURSDAY NIGHT THE

64
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
PRESIDENT IS RULING OUT THE

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
DRONING OF AMERICANS IN

66
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AMERICA ONCE AND FOREALL.

67
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
AND SPELLING OUT THE RULES

68
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
FOR DRONE STRIKES TO TAKE

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
OUT TERRORIST SUSPECTS

70
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
INCLUDING U.S. CITIZENS

71
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
OVERSEAS.

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO
CALLING FOR NEW STEPS TO

73
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SHUT DOWN THE PRISON AT

74
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
GUANTANAMO BAY AT LAST AND

75
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
BRING SOME DETAINEES HERE

76
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
TO THE UNITED STATES.

77
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>> GIVEN MY

78
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ADMINISTRATION'S RELENTLESS

79
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
PURSUIT OF AL QAEDA'S

80
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
LEADERSHIP, THERE IS NO

81
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
JUSTIFICATION BEYOND

82
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
POLITICS FOR CONGRESS TO

83
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
PREVENT US FROM CLOSING A

84
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
FACILITY THAT SHOULD HAVE
NEVER BEEN OPENED.

85
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
>> THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

86
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
CLOSING GITMO IS THAT WE

87
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
DESTROYED THE AL QAEDA

88
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
LEADERSHIP RELENTLESS IN

89
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
OUR PURSUIT OF TERRORISTS.

90
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
THAT IS NOT A GOOD

91
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
JUSTIFICATION BECAUSE THAT
IS NOT TRUE.

92
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THE REASON WE HAVEN'T

93
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
CLOSED GUANTANAMO BAY IS WE

94
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO CLOSE

95
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
IT.

96
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
YOU NEED A PLAN.

97
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT ALSO

98
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
HEARD REACTION TO HIS PLANS

99
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
DURING HIS SPEECH AT THE

100
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY

101
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
IN WASHINGTON.

102
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I HAD HENRY IS ON FOX TOP

103
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
STORY LIVE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TONIGHT.

104
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ED HE IS TALKING ABOUT, I

105
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
GUESS, IN ESSENCE SCALING

106
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
BACK THE WAR ON TERROR?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

107
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
HE IS NOT EVEN REALLY USING

108
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THE PHRASE WAR ON TERROR

109
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ANYMORE.
SAYS THAT WHAT WE CALLED

110
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THE WAR ON TERROR IT

111
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
BECOMES SELF-DEFEATING IN
HIS WORDS TO CONSTANTLY BE

112
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ON A WAR FOOTING.

113
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
HE BELIEVES WE HAVE GOT TO

114
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
CHANGE OUR TOOLS, GOT TO

115
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
COME UP WITH A BETTER LEGAL

116
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
FRAMEWORK TO EXPLAIN TO THE

117
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW WE'RE

118
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
USING THESE TOOLS TO FIND

119
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
TERROR.

120
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
SPECIFICALLY, HE IS

121
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
STARTING WITH TRYING TO

122
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
FINALLY MAKE GOOD ON THAT

123
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
FAILED PROMISE FROM HIS

124
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE HERE

125
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TO CLOSE THE U.S. MILITARY

126
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY.

127
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
YOU MENTIONED THAT HE HAD

128
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
GOT SOME DIRECT FEEDBACK ON

129
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THAT.

130
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
IT CAME FROM A HECKLER AT

131
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
CODE PINK WHO LET THE
PRESIDENT HAVE IT ABOUT

132
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THAT HUNGER STRIKE THAT'S

133
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
GOING ON AT GUANTANAMO

134
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
RIGHT NOW.
TAKE A LISTEN.

135
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> I'M ABOUT.

136
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
>> YOU ARE COMMANDER AND

137
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
CHIEF.

138
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
>> LET ME.

139
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
>> YOU CAN CLOSE GAHANNA

140
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
TAN TODAY.
>> THANK YOU.

141
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
YOU SHOULD LET ME FINISH MY

142
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
SENTENCE.

143
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
TODAY.
I ONCE AGAIN CALL ON

144
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
CONGRESS TO LIFT THE

145
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
RESTRICTIONS ON DETAINEE

146
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TRANSFERS TO GITMO.

147
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
[ APPLAUSE ]

148
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
>> I HAVE ASKED THE

149
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO

150
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
DESIGNATE A SITE IN THE

151
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
UNITED STATES WHERE WE CAN

152
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
HOLD MILITARY COMMISSIONS.

153
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
>> REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN

154
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
MCCAIN TONIGHT SAYING HE

155
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
WILL WORK WITH THE

156
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
PRESIDENT TO TRY TO MAKE

157
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THAT HAPPEN.

158
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
BUT THAT HE BELIEVES THE

159
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
PRESIDENT STILL HASN'T
GIVEN A CLEAR PLAN ABOUT

160
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
HOW TO FOLLOW UP ON ALL OF

161
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THAT.
AND THAT'S THE REAL REASON

162
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WHY CONGRESS HASN'T MOVED

163
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
ON IT, SHEP.

164
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
>> Shepard: ED, WE GOT A
LOT OF DETAIL BRAND NEW

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
PROGRAM.

167
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000

OF DETAIL THE PRESIDENT

LAYING OUT AND ADMITTING

170
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

171
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
HAS SKILLED AT LEAST FOUR

172
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
AMERICANS SINCE 2009.

173
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
OVERSEAS.

174
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ONE OF ONLY ONE OF THEM

175
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ANWAR AL AWLAKI WAS

176
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
ACTUALLY TARGETED.
THE OTHER THREE WERE TAKEN

177
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OUT AS PART OF OTHER

178
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OPERATIONS.

179
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
NOT DIRECTLY TARGETED.

180
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY

181
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SAID THAT HE WANTS TO LAY

182
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
OUT A LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO

183
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
MAKE SURE THAT WE LIMIT

184
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WHEN WE

185
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
USE THE DRONES.

186
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THEY

187
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WANT TO SEE MORE DETAILS ON

188
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THAT AS WELL.

189
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

190
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
>> BEFORE ANY STRIKE IS

191
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
TAKEN, THERE MUST BE NEAR

192
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000

PRESIDENT SAYS HE ALSO

213
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BELIEVES THAT JOURNALISTS

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
SHOULD NOT FACE LEGAL
ACTION FOR DOING THEIR JOBS

215
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000

INSIDE FOX REPORT.

221
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000

228
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AND NOW A WOMAN WHO

229
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
CONFRONTED THE TWO MEN

230
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
ACCUSED OF HACKING THAT

231
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
SOLDIER SAYS SHE WAS JUST

232
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
TRYING TO KEEP THEM CALM.

233
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
AND STOP THEM FROM HURTING

234
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
ANYBODY ELSE.

235
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AT LEAST ONE OF THE MEN WAS

236
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
STILL CARRYING BUTCHER

237
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
KNIVES.

238
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
HIS HANDS DRIPPING WITH

239
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
ABOUT THE BRITISH

244
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
GOVERNMENT AND ITS TROOPS

245
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000

246
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
HOW THIS ATTACK IS PAY BACK

247
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
FOR THE DEATHS OF MUSLIMS.

248
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THE WOMAN WHO WENT WITH UP

249
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TO THE MEN IS A SCOUT

250
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
LEADER AND A MOTHER AND SHE

251
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SAYS SHE WAS MORE WORRIED

252
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
ABOUT OTHERS THAN HER OWN

253
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SAFETY.

254
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000

255
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION?

256
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
>> NO.
>> WHY NOT?

257
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
>> BETTER ME THAN A CHILD.

258
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY MORE

259
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000

APPROVED A PLAN THAT WILL

426
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
END THE PLAN OF OPENLY GAY

PROPOSAL.

434
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THE REVERSAL DOES NOT

435
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
REMOVE THE BAN ON GAY ADULT

457
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
EVEN STARTING A NEW

458

RECYCLING PROGRAM AMONG

459
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
OTHER THINGS.

460
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
TRACE GALLAGHER LIVE IN OUR

461
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
WEST COAST NEWSROOM FOR US

462
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
THIS AFTERNOON.
ANY MORE MOVEMENT FROM THE

463
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
COURTHOUSE TRACE?
>> CERTAINLY THE MOST WE

464
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HAVE SEEN ALLSñ DAY SHEP.

465
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
THE COURT REPORTER GOT

466
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
SUMMONSED TO COURT ALONG

467
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WITH THE HEAD OF SECURITY

468
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AND THE FAMILY OF TRAVIS

469
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
ALEXANDER BEGAN STREAMING

470
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
IN.

471
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE

472
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
JURY QUESTION YOU TALKED

473
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
ABOUT.

474
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
THEY ARE STILL IN AROUND

475
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
AROUND THE COURTROOM.
THERE COULD BE MORE GOING

476
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
ON HERE THAT WOULD HAVE

477
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
BEEN BY THE WAY, THE

478
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
SECOND COURT QUESTION FROM

479
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THE DAY FROM THE JURY.

480
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SEALED

481
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THEY WON'T EXACTLY TELL US

482
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
WHAT THE JURY WANTS.

483
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
KEEP IN MIND THE JURY SO

484
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
FAR HAS DELIBERATED ABOUT

485
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
13 HOURS DURING THE PENALTY

486
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
PHASE.

487
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THEY ONLY DELIBERATED 15

488
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
HOURS DURING THE GUILT OR

489
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
INNOCENCE PHASE.

490
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
AND BECAUSE ALL OF THE

491
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
MAJOR PLAYERS ARE ON SCENE,

492
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
IF THERE IS A VERDICT

493
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SOMETIME IN THE NEXT 15 OR

494
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
20 MINUTES SHEP, IT IS

495
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
LIKELY IT WOULD BE READ

496
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
RELATIVELY QUICKLY.

497
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> Shepard: IF THERE IS NOT
A VERDICT, TRACE.

498
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'M HEARING THAT THIS JURY

499
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
MAY TAKE A LONG WEEKEND; IS

500
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THAT RIGHT?

501
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
>> YEAH.
YOU COULD BE RIGHT SHEP.

502
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
NORMALLY THEY FINISH

503
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
DELIBERATIONS AT ABOUT 4:30

504
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
LOCAL TIME.

505
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
ABOUT 15 MINUTES FROM NOW.

506
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
NORMALLY THERE IS NO COURT

507
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
ON FRIDAY.
THEN, OF COURSE MONDAY IS

508
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
A HOLIDAY BUT NOW WE ARE

509
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
HEARING FROM THE COURT THEY

510
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
COULD GO AS LONGoT3 AS

511
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
WEDNESDAY BEFORE THEY

512
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
ACTUALLY COME BACK IN FOR

513
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
DELIBERATIONS.
FIVE DAYS.

514
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A LONG WAIT FOR JODI ARIAS.

515
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
NOW, REMEMBER IF THEY ARE

516
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED, THE

517
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
COURT REALLY HAS JUST TWO

518
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
OPTIONS.
ONE, THEY CAN EITHER

519
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
IMPANEL A BRAND NEW JURY

520
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
AND RETRY PART OF THE

521
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
PENALTY PHASE OR, TWO,

522
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
PROSECUTORS COULD AGREE TO

523
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
WAIVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND

524
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AGREE TO LIFE IN PRISON.

525
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
JODI ARIAS THINKS LIFE IN

526
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
PRISON WOULD BE LESS OF A

527
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
BURDEN ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM.

528
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
HERE SHE IS.

529
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I DON'T THINK IT WILL GIVE

530
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
CLOSURE TO ANYONE.

531
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
IF I GET A DEATH VERDICT IT

532
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
WILL DRAG OAND ON AND ON IN

533
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
APPELLATE COURTS FOR YEARS

534
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
INSTEAD OF GETTING IT DONE

535
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
INSTEAD OF SENDING ME OFF

536
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TO PRISON AND FORGETTING

537
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
ABOUT ME.

538
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
>> THE MEDIA HAS BEEN LET

539
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000

JODI ARIAS LOOKED PRETTY

558
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
GOOD DURING THE INTERVIEWS

559
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
EARLIER THIS WEEKS.

560
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000

AMERICA.

563
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
JOE ARPAIO SAYS THAT SOME

564

MINUTES.

752
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THINGS THAT THEY ARE
WORKING ON THAT DAY WHAT

753
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THEY WANTED TO BE THEIR

754
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
FAVORITE THINGS FIVE THINGS

755
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
THEY LEARNED.

756
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DAY WAS

757
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
OBVIOUSLY CHANGED A LOT.

758
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
>> LIVES CHANGED FOREVER.

759
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
SHEP?

760
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000

761

762
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
WE RECEIVED NEW VIDEO OF

763
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
THE VIDEO OF WHAT BRIAR

764
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WOOD ELEMENTARY LOOKS LIKE

765
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
TODAY.
ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF

766
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
AWAY FROM PLAZA TOWERS AND

767
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
ALSO IN THE TORNADO'S PATH.

768
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
JOHN ROBERTS TOURED WHAT'S

769
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
LEFT OF BRIAR WOOD

770
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
ELEMENTARY AND TOMORROW HE

771
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
WILL TELL US THE STORY OF

772
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
THE TEACHER WHO GOT HURT

773
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
WHILE SAVING THE STUDENTS'

774
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
LIVES.

775
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
THERE IS BREAKING NEWS NOW

776
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

777
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
WE HAVE A VERDICT IN THE

778
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
CASE OF THE MURDER JODI

779
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ARIAS.
THE JURY HAS NOW DECIDED

780
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
WHETHER JODY -- WILL

781
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
RECOMMEND THAT JODI ARIAS

782
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
LIVES OR DIES.

783
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT GOING

784
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
ON IN THAT COURTROOM TODAY.

785
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
AT ONE POINT AS YOU KNOW

786
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
THE JURORS SAID WE CAN'T

787
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
COME UP WITH A DECISION.

788
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
THE JUDGE SENT THEM BACK.

789
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE

790
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
CONVENING PEOPLE IN THE

791
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
COURTROOM NOW.

792
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
RELATIVES OF THE VICTIM
HAVE BEEN THERE AND MANY OF

793
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
THE COURT WATCHERS AS WELL.

794
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
EVERYONE IS IN THE

795
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
COURTROOM NOW AND THERE IS

796
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
A VERDICT.
SO OUR LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS

797
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
NOW OF THE JODI ARIAS

798
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
VERDICT.

799
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
AS YOU KNOW.

800
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
WE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE

801
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR

802
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
SPECIFICS THIS AFTERNOON.

803
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE

804
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
VERDICT IS IN.

805
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT IT

806
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
IS.
BUT WE'RE WAITING TO FIND

807
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
OUT WHAT THAT VERDICT IS

808
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
AND, OF COURSE LIVE

809
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
COVERAGE.
TRACE GALLAGHER IS WITH US

810
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
FROM LOS ANGELES.

811
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
TRACE, THE THINKING WAS

812
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
THAT IF THEY DIDN'T GET A

813
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
VERDICT TODAY THAT THEY

814
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
PROBABLY WOULD TAKE A LONG

815
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
WEEKEND.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE VERDICT

816
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
IS IN AND WE WILL KNOW

817
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
WHAT, MINUTES FROM NOW OR

818
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
WHAT?
DO WE KNOW?

819
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
>> WELL, SHEP, I MEAN NOT

820
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
SO FAST, BECAUSE THE JUDGE

821
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
SAID FIRST WE UNDERSTAND

822
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
THE JURY THAT YOU HAVE A

823
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
VERDICT.
AND, IN FACT WHAT THEY ARE

824
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
SAYING NOW IS THE JUDGE

825
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
COULD VERY WELL BE

826
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
DEADLOCKED.

827
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
NOW, OUR FEED IS KIND OF

828
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
BREAKING UP.

829
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
CAN YOU SEE JODI ARIAS

830
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
RIGHT THERE.

831
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE

832
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
JURY HAS NOT REACHED A

833
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
UNANIMOUS DECISION, SHEP

834
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
SO THE JURY REMAINS

835
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DEADLOCKED.

836
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
AND WE WENT OVER THE

837
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
OPTIONS BEFORE THE COURT.

838
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS

839
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
IN ESSENCE THE JUDGE HAS

840
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
NOW SET A FURTHER DATE FOR

841
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THEM, JULY 18TH IS THE DATE

842
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
FOR WHAT TO HAPPEN?

843
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
>> FOR THE RETRIAL.

844
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
SO THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO

845
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
HAPPEN NOW.

846
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
WE TALKED ABOUT OPTION ONE

847
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
AND JULY 18TH HAS NOW BEEN

848
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
SET FOR A RETRIAL.

849
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WHAT THEY WILL DO BETWEEN

850
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
NOW AND JULY 18TH, SHEP,

851
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
THEY WILL IMPANEL A BRAND

852
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
NEW JURY.

853
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THIS JURY WILL BE EXCUSED.

854
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
THEY WILL IMPANEL A BRAND

855
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
NEW JURY AND THAT NEW JURY

856
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
WILL THEN RETRY PART OF THE

857
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
PENALTY PHASE.
NOT THE ENTIRE PENALTY

858
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
PHASE.
BUT PART OF IT BECAUSE THE

859
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
AGRA VARIETY HAS ALREADY

860
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
BEEN MET.

861
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
WHAT THE NEW JURY WILL DO

862
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
IS RETRY THE TAIL END OF

863
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THE PENALTY PHASE.

864
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
THE IMPACT STATEMENTS FROM
THE FAMILY WILL BE READ

865
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AGAIN AND THIS TIME JODI

866
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
ARIAS, IF SHE WANTS TO HAVE

867
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
SOMEBODY TESTIFY ON HER

868
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
BEHALF THAT CAN ALSO HAPPEN

869
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
DURING THE RETRY OF THE

870
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
PENALTY PHASE.

871
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
SO THE SECOND CHOICE THE

872
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
PROSECUTORS HAD WAS TO WAVE

873
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
THE DEATH PENALTY ALL

874
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
TOGETHER.

875
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
AND AGREE TO LIFE IN

876
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
PRISON.

877
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
CLEARLY THE PROSECUTION DID

878
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
NOT WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE

879
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THE JUDGE HAS AGREED TO SAY

880
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
LOOK WE ARE GOING TO GO

881
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
WITH A BRAND NEW JURY.

882
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
THEY WILL CULL THAT JURY

883
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
FROM THE SAME JURY THE

884
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
ORIGINAL MARICOPA COUNTY.

885
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
WE HAVE TALKED AD NAUSEAM

886
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
ABOUT THE COVERAGE THIS

887
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
TRIAL HAS GOTTEN IS THERE

888
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
ANY JURY JURY THAT COULDN'T

889
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
BE SKEWED BY THE COVERAGE.

890
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THAT'S THE GO INTO THE JURY

891
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
SELECTION.
THOSE JUST JOINING US.

892
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THIS IS HUGE NEWS.

893
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THE JURY WAS DEADLOCKED.

894
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THE JUDGE COULD HAVE SENT

895
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THEM BACK AGAIN TO KEEP ON

896
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
DELIBERATING.

897
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
BUT THEY CAME BACK SAYING,

898
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
LOOK, WE ARE HOPELESSLY

899
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
DEAD LOCKED.

900
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE EXACT

901
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
COUNT IF IT WAS 6 TO 6 OR 8

902
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
TO 4.

903
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THEY ARE DEADLOCKED.

904
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
THE JUDGE WILL NOW LET THE

905
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
JURY GO AND THEY WILL

906
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
IMPANEL A BRAND NEW JURY,

907
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
SHEP.
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT

908
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
WILL HAPPEN.

909
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
BUT, FOR NOW, JODI ARIAS

910
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
GOES BACK TO THE MARICOPA

911
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
COUNTY JAIL AND SHE WILL

912
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
AWAIT A BRAND NEW PENALTY

913
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
PHASE OF HER TRIAL TO SEE

914
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
IF SHE LIVES OR DIES.

915
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO

916
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
SEE THIS THROUGH TO THE

917
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
END.

918
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO WAIVE

919
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
THE DEATH PENALTY IN A CASE

920
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
WHERE SHE STABBED HER

921
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
BOYFRIEND 27 TIMES, SLASHED

922
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
HIS THROAT AND SHOT HIM IN

923
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
THE HEAD.

924
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
IT IS HUGE NEWS.

925
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
STILL WAITING FOR MORE
INFORMATION FROM THE JUDGE

926
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
AS IT COMES INTO THIS US,

927
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
SHEP.

928
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
WE WILL KEEP YOU UP TO

929
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
DATE.

930
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
>> Shepard: WE'RE NOT GOING
TO STOP HERE, TRACE.

931
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF

932
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
ANY OF THE PLAYERS FROM THE

933
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
COURTHOUSE COME OUT AND

934
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
TALK.
WE HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF

935
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THAT, OF COURSE, ANYTHING

936
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
FROM LAWYERS ON EITHER

937
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
SIDE?

938
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
ANYTHING FROM THESE JURORS
WHO HAVE NOW BEEN

939
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
DISMISSED?

940
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
TRACE, IT'S POSSIBLE WE

941
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
MIGHT HEAR FROM THEM

942
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
RIGHT?
>> WE MIGHT VERY WELL,

943
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
SHEP.
BECAUSE THEY HAD SAID THE

944
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
JURORS AFTER THIS WOULD

945
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
SPEAK.
WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THREE

946
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
FEMALE JURORS AS THEY WERE

947
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
LEAVING THE COURT PARDON

948
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
ME, WERE CRYING.

949
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
SO THREE FEMALE JURORS WERE

950
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
CRYING AS THEY LEFT THE

951
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
COURT.

952
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
KEEP IN MIND, I MEAN, THIS
IS A JURY THAT HAS WORKED

953
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
FOR THE BETTER PART OF

954
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
FOUR FOUR AND A HALF

955
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
MONTHS ON THIS CASE.

956
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
IT HAS BEEN A HUGE PART OF

957
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
THEIR LIVES.
WHEN THEY'RE EXCUSED.

958
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
UNABLE TO SEE THIS THROUGH,

959
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
IT'S GOT TO BE EXTREMELY

960
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
EMOTIONAL FOR THEM.

961
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW THE

962
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
BREAKDOWN, SHEP.

963
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE JURY

964
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
MAKEUP WAS AND HOW MANY

965
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
WERE IN FAVOR OF LIFE AND

966
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
IN FAVOR OF DEATH.

967
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
AS LEGAL EXPERTS WOULD TELL

968
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
YOU, IT IS A LOT HARDER FOR

969
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
TO SWAY A JUROR WHO IS IN

970
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
FAVOR OF LIFE IN PRISON TO

971
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
ACTUALLY GO TO THE DEATH

972
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
PENALTY THAN THE CONVERSE.

973
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
TO SWITCH SOMEBODY WHO IS

974
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
IN FAVOR OF THE DEATH

975
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
PENALTY TO GO TOWARD LIFE

976
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
IN PRISON.

977
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
BUT APPARENTLY THESE JURORS

978
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
WERE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT

979
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
THEIR VIEWS BECAUSE THEY

980
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
SAID AFTER THREE HOURS OF

981
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
DELIBERATIONS YESTERDAY,

982
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
THEY CAME IN THEY TOLD THE

983
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
JUDGE THEY WERE DEADLOCKED.

984
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
SHE SAID GO BACK AND TRY

985
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
AGAIN.
NOW, SHE COULD HAVE DONE

986
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.

987
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
SHE COULD HAVE SENT THE

988
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
JURY BACK IN TO THE JURY

989
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ROOM TO KEEP DELIBERATING.

990
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
FIVE SIX, SEVEN, 10 TIMES,

991
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
WHO KNOWS?

992
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE.

993
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
CLEARLY, SHE GOT

994
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE

995
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
DEADLOCKED AND SHE DECIDED

996
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
THE BEST AND MOST

997
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
EXPEDITIOUS WAY TO APPROACH

998
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
THIS WOULD BE TO IMPANEL A

999
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
BRAND NEW JURY.

1000
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS.

1001
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT I

1002
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
MEAN, WE HAVE COVERED A

1003
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
BUNCH OF TRIALS AND I HAVE

1004
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
NEVER SEEN A BRAND NEW JURY

1005
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
COME IN AND TAKE OVER TO

1006
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE

1007
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
LIVES OR DIES.

1008
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
AND THEY WILL NOT TRY THE

1009
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
BEGINNING OF THIS TRIAL.

1010
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
SO THIS BRAND NEW JURY WILL

1011
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
GET BROUGHT UP TO SPEED AND

1012
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
THEN ONLY HEAR THE EVIDENCE

1013
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
THAT WAS DELIVERED IN THE

1014
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
PENALTY PHASE.

1015
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
IT MIGHT BE -- IT MIGHT BE

1016
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
KIND OF AN EXTRACTED

1017
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
PENALTY PHASE IF YOU WILL

1018
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
BUT IT WILL STILL ONLY BE

1019
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
THE TAIL END OF THAT

1020
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
PENALTY PHASE THAT GOES

1021
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
PAST THE AGGRAVATING

1022
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
FACTORS.
THE JURY UP TO NOW THAT WAS

1023
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
IN THIS CASE FROM THE

1024
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
BEGINNING HAS AGREED THAT

1025
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
SHE IS GUILTY AND HAS

1026
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
AGREED THAT WERE

1027
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
AGGRAVATING FACTORS.

1028
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
NOW THE SECOND JURY, THEY

1029
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WILL BE CHARGED WITH THE

1030
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
TASK OF DECIDING WHETHER OR

1031
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
NOT JODI ARIAS LIVES OR

1032
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
DIES.

1033
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
THE JURY SELECTION ALONE

1034
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
COULD BE VERY LONG AND VERY

1035
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
TEDIOUS.
JULY 18TH IS WHEN THAT WILL

1036
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
ALL BEGIN.
SO FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS

1037
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
JODI ARIAS GOES BACK TO THE

1038
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
MARICOPA COUNTY JAIL, SHEP.

1039
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
>> Shepard: I CAN'T EVEN

1040
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
BELIEVE THIS, TRACE.
THINK OF ALL THAT HAS

1041
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
HAPPENED OUTSIDE THAT

1042
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
COURTHOUSE THAT EVERYBODY

1043
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
IN AMERICA HAS HAD ACCESS

1044
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
TO.
AWESOME SPEECHES BY JODI

1045
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
ARIAS, THE WORD NOW THAT

1046
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THE MEDIA HAVE GIVEN HER

1047
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
MAKEUP AND SHE HAS GONE

1048
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
THROUGH ALL OF THIS HOW SHE

1049
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
FEELS AND WHAT SHE WANTS TO

1050
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
DO IN PRISON AND ALL OF

1051
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
THIS SIDE STUFF THAT NO

1052
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
JUROR WAS SUPPOSED TO EVER

1053
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
HEAR.
ESPECIALLY NOT THOSE MAKING

1054
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
A LIFE OR DEATH DECISION

1055
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
ABOUT HER.

1056
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
NOW ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN

1057
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.

1058
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THEY HAVE TO START OVER.

1059
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I HAVE NEAFER HEARD OF

1060
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
THIS.

1061
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I OHIO NEVER HEARD OF THIS.

1062
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
>> IMAGINE WE HAD THREE OF

1063
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
THE ORIGINAL JURORS WERE
KICKED OFF THE JURY.

1064
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
SO THEY HAD THREE OF THE

1065
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
ALTERNATES THAT WERE IN

1066
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
PLACE WHEN THIS FINAL JURY

1067
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
MADE THE DECISION WE ARE

1068
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
TALKING ABOUT MAYBE 15, 20

1069
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
MINUTES AGO.

1070
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
SO NOW YOU HAVE THIS JURY

1071
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
POOL AND JURY SELECTION WAS

1072
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
TEDIOUS TO BEGIN WITH.

1073
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS JURY

1074
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000

SAYING THERE IS NO WAY THAT

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

1079
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
FIND A FAIR JURY IN

SURROUNDING THE GREATER

1083

THERE IS NO WAY YOU ARE

1084

GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND A

1085
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
FAIR JURY IN THIS

1086
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
JURISDICTION.

1087
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THEY WILL CLEARLY ASK FOR A

1088
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
CHANGE OF VENUE.

1089
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
IMAGINE THAT IMAGINE JODI

00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
ARIAS GETTING A NEW TRIAL

1091
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000

1092
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
DIFFERENT COUNTY IN

1093
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000

THOSE ARE THE FACTS THAT

1094
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE.

1095
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000

ALL NEW TO US?

1098
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A JURY

1099
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
QUESTION.

1100
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
IT TURNS OUT THIS WAS THE

ENVELOPE AND THE VERDICT

1105
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
WAS WE ARE DEADLOCKED.

1106
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000

1354
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
>> Shepard: YOU KNOW THEY

1355
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
ARE GOING TO SEEK A CHANGE

1356

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
PUTS NEW LAWYERS ON.

1361
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THEY WILL SAY, YOUR HONOR

1362
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THIS CASE HAS BEEN GOING ON

1363
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
FOR YEARS, WE NEED TIME TO

1364
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
GET UP TO SPEED.

1365
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
THIS SAGINAW IS NOT GOING

1366
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000

1367
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> Shepard: SHANE TO ME HOW

1368
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
THIS JUDGE HAS HAD A GAG

1369
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
ORDER ON THIS CASE FROM THE

1370
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
VERY BEGINNING.

1371
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
AND WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE

1372
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE

1373
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO KILL

1374
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
YOU OR WE ARE GOING TO LOCK

1375
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
YOU UP FOR THE REST OF YOUR

1376
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
LAYOFF.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

1377
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
THE GOVERNMENT CAN EVER

1378
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
DECIDE, THE PEOPLE ARE

1379
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
HAVING TO DECIDE WHAT THE
GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO DO

1380
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TO A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED

1381
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
STATES SHE LIFTS THE GAG

1382
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
ORDER?

1383
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1384
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> THE ONLY RATIONALIZATION

1385
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I COULD THINK OF IS THIS IS

1386
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
A WOMAN WHO IS LITERALLY

1387
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE

1388
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
LITERALLY FIGHTING FOR HER

1389
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
LIFE.

1390
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
SHE HAS HAD HER FIRST

1391
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
AMENDMENT PRIVILEGES TAKEN

1392
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
AWAY FROM HER THROUGHOUT

1393
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL.

1394
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
SHE IS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK

1395
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
FREELY THE WAY EVERYONE

1396
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
ELSE IS.

1397
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
AND I MEAN, I'M GUESSING,

1398
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
SHEPAR BUT THE JUDGE

1399
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
PROBABLY SAID HEY, SHE HAS
GOT A COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT.

1400
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SHE WANTS TO GIVE HERSELF

1401
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
SOME INTERVIEWS.

1402
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
CHIEF JOE SET HER UP.

1403
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000

THE MEANEST OF THE MEANEST

1405
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
OF THE MEANEST SUPPOSEDLY.

1406
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
HE ARRANGED IT AND ALLOWED

1407
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
IT TO HAPPEN.

1408
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
SHE NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD.

1409
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
MAKEUP AND LIPSTICK AND ALL

1410
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
OF THAT STUFF.

1411
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000

CASE WHICH IS OUT THERE

1413
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
NATIONALLY.
WHATEVER NEW JURORS THERE

1415

BE GOING LING IT RIGHT NOW.

1417
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
>> Shepard: THIS WOMAN WHO

1418
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
STOOD UP ON THAT STAND AND

1419
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
FOR DAYS ACCUSED HER

1420
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
EXLOVER OF ABUSING HER.

1421
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
AFTER SHE MURDERED HIM IN

1422
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
COLD BLOOD, ACCUSED HIM OF

1423
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
ABUSIVING HER.

1424
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THAT'S WHAT THIS FAMILY --

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
AND THERE WAS NOT A SEN

1426
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
CONTINUE LA OF EVIDENCE TO

1427
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
SUPPORT THAT ACCUSATION.

1428
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
NOTHING.
THE WHOLE WAY.

00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
HAVE HAPPENED.
BLOOD, LIVER AND  NERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS,

1482
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
SERIOUS ALLERGIC REACTIONS

1483
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
AND NEW OR WORSENING  HEART FAILURE

1484
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
HAVE OCCURD.

1485
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
BEFORE STARTING HUMIRA , YOUR  DOCTOR
SHOULD TEST YOU FOR TB.

1486
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU LIVE  IN OR
HAVE BEEN TO A REGION

1487
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
WHERE CERTAIN FUNGAL  INFECTIONS ARE

1488
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
COMMON.

1489
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU  HAVE HAD
TB, HEPATITIS B

1490
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
ARE PRONE TO INFECTIONS,  OR HAVE

1491
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FEVER

1492
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
FATIGUE, COUGH, OR SORES.

1493
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
YOU SHOULD NOT START HUMIRA IF  YOU

1494
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
HAVE ANY KIND OF INFECTION.

1495
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF  HUMIRA CAN WORK

1496
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
FOR YOU.

1497
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
THIS IS HUMIRA AT WORK.

1498
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You thought this beach couldn't  get

1499
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000

1505
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
BEFORE 5:00 IN PHOENIX,

1506
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
ARIZONA.

1507
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
AND THE UNTHINKABLE HAS
HAPPENED.

1508
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
THE JURY HAS COME BACK WITH

1509
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
NO DECISION ON LIFE OR

1510
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
DEATH FOR JODI ARIAS.

1511
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
AND THAT NO DECISION MEANS

1512
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
A WHOLE NEW JURY WILL BE

1513
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
IMPANELED IN JULY AND HE

1514
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
THEY WILL GO THROUGH THIS

1515
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
PENALTY PHASE ALL OVER

1516
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
AGAIN.

1517
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
WILL THEY BE ABLE TO DO IT

1518
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
IN MARICOPA COUNTY?

1519
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
WILL THEY BE GRANTED A

1520
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
CHANGE OF VENUE AS MOST

1521
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
LEGAL ANALYSTS HAVE SAID

1522
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
PRIOR TO THIS THAT MOST

1523
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
LIKELY THEY WILL BE?

1524
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
WILL THE DEFENSE LAWYERS

1525
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
ASK TO BE TAKEN OFF THE

1526
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
CASE AGAIN?

1527
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
MOST LIKELY.

1528
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
AND WHAT OF THE PROSECUTORS

1529
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
HERE?

1530
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
ARTHUR AIDALA IS WITH US

1531
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
HERE IN STUDIO.

FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST

"STUDIO B" LEGAL HE

1534
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
CONTRIBUTOR.
IT'S JUST -- THIS IS JUST A

1535
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
DISASTER.
>> IT IS A DISASTER.

1536
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

1537
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
WHEN A JURY CAN'T REACH A

1538
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
UNANIMOUS DECISION DE FACTO

1539
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
IT'S LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE.

1540
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
>> Shepard: THAT'S WHAT WE

1541
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
DO HERE?

1542
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
>> WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS IF

1543
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
THIS NEXT JURY DOESN'T DO

1544
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
IT THE JUDGE HAS A CHOICE

1545
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
BETWEEN LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE

1546
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
OR NATURAL LIFE.

1547
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I HAVEN'T DONE THE RESEARCH

1548
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
TO TELL WHAT THE DIFFERENCE

1549
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
IS LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE OR

1550
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
NATURAL LIFE.

1551
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
>> Shepard: TRACE HAS

1552
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
SOMETHING ON THIS, TRACE?

1553
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
>> WHY YOU ARE TALKING TO

1554
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
ARTY, VERY IMPORTANT TO

1555
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
POINT OUT NOW WE ARE TOLD

1556
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

1557
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
WRIGGLE ROOM HERE FOR

1558
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
PROSECUTORS.
WE ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS

1559
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
OPTION TWO IN THIS.

1560
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
OPTION ONE IS IMPANELING

1561
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
BRAND NEW JURY AND GOING

1562
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
OVER PART OF THE PENALTY

1563
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
PHASE.

1564
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
OPTION 2 IS IF PROSECUTOR

1565
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
DECIDED THEY WANTED TO

1566
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
WAIVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND

1567
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
AGREE TO LIFE IN PRISON.

1568
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A

1569
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
STATUS HEARING THAT HAS

1570
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
BEEN SET FOR JUNE 20TH,

1571
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL

1572
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
MEET WITH PROSECUTORS AND

1573
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
THEY WILL DISCUSS GOING

1574
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
FORWARD.
NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG

1575
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
SHOT BECAUSE THESE

1576
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN

1577
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
ADAMANT ABOUT GOING FOR THE

1578
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
DEATH PENALTY IT STILL

1579
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
LEAVES A GREAT PERIOD FOR

1580
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
THEM 27 DAYS WHERE THEY CAN

1581
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
FIGURE OUT IF THIS WILL

1582
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
WORK IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT

1583
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
A CHANGE OF VENUE, IF THEY

1584
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A

1585
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
JURY AND THE PROSECUTORS

1586
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
COULD IN THEORY SAY YOU

1587
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
KNOW WHAT?
WE ARE GOING TO AGREE TO

1588
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
GIVE HER LIFE IN PRISON AND

1589
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
THEN CUT A DEAL WITH THE

1590
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND SAY

1591
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
HERE IS THE DEAL.

1592
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
YOU TAKE LIFE IN PRISON

1593
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF

1594
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
PAROLE WHICH YOU IS REALLY

1595
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
IMPORTANT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

1596
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
ARIZONA DOESN'T HAVE A

1597
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
MECHANISM THAT GIVES LIFE

1598
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
IN PRISON ANY TYPE OR ANY

1599
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
CHANCE OF PAROLE BUT SOME

1600
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
DAY DOWN THE LINE, 20 YEARS

1601
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
FROM NOW.

1602
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
IF THAT LAW IS PASSED THAT

1603
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
GIVES THEM THAT.

1604
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
SHE WOULD HAVE TO WAIVE

1605
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
THAT IN OTHER WORDS THE

1606
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
DEAL WOULD BE SHE WOULD

1607
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
ACCEPT LIFE IN PRISON

1608
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF

1609
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
PAROLE OR THEY ARE GOING

1610
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
FORWARD WITH THE DEATH

1611
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
PENALTY.

1612
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THAT'S JUST ONE THEORY.

1613
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
BUT PROSECUTORS HAVE SAID

1614
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
FROM DAY ONE THEY BELIEVE

1615
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
THIS IS A DEATH PENALTY

1616
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
CASE AND FOR THEM TO QUIT

1617
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT SEEMS

1618
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
HIGHLY UNLIKELY, BUT THERE

1619
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
IS THAT LITTLE BIT OF

1620
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
LEEWAY THEY HAVE NOW, SHEP

1621
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
BUT IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE

1622
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
THEY WILL IMPANEL A BRAND

1623
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
NEW DEATH PENALTY JURY.

1624
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
>> Shepard: TRACE, I'M SO
HOPEFUL THAT ONE OF THESE

1625
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
JURORS OR A GROUP OF THESE

1626
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
JURORS WILL COME OUT.

1627
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
WE WERE TOLD EARLIER THAT

1628
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
THREE OF THE JURORS WERE

1629
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
SEEN CRYING.

1630
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I BELIEVE YOU REPORTED

1631
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THAT.

1632
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
RIGHT, TRACE?
>> YEAH, THREE OF THE WOMEN

1633
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
WERE CRYING AS THEY LEFT

1634
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
THE COURT.

1635
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
REMEMBER YOU HAVE GOT THE

1636
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
ALEXANDER FAMILY, THEY ARE

1637
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
AN EMOTIONAL WRECK RIGHT

1638
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
NOW.

1639
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THEY HAVE BEEN PULLED

1640
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
ASIDE.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

1641
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
YOU GO THROUGH FOUR AND A
HALF MONTHS OF THIS.

1642
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
YOU ARE EXPECTING THIS TO

1643
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
HAPPEN.

1644
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
AND YOU GET THE VERDICT IS

1645
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
NO VERDICT.

1646
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
VERY EMOTIONALLY DRAINING

1647
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
SHEP.
>> Shepard: YOU KNOW, THERE

1648
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
IS SOMEBODY ELSE TO WHOM

1649
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
THEY CAN TURN ON THIS,

1650
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
ARTHUR.

1651
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
>> IF I'M THE PROSECUTOR,
AFTER WHAT THIS DECEASED

1652
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH.

1653
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
AND WE HAVE HEARD THEIR

1654
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
HEART WRENCHING CRIES, THEY

1655
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
SHOULD BE MAKING THAT

1656
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
DECISION.
YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS

1657
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AGAIN?
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS

1658
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
OPEN-ENDED PART OF YOUR

1659
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
LIFE FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS

1660
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
AND WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH

1661
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
LONGER OR DO YOU WANT TO

1662
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
JUST SAY PUT HER IN JAIL

1663
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
