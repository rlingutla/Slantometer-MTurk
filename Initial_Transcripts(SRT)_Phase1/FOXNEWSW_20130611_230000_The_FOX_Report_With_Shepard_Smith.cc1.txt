[000:01:30;15] MONITORING THE PHONE  
[000:01:31;06] RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF  
[000:01:32;16] AMERICANS.

[000:01:40;14] VIOLATES BOTH FREEDOM OF  
[000:01:41;23] SPEECH AND PRIVACY RIGHTS.  
[000:01:43;08] ACCORDING TO THE ACLU, IT  
[000:01:44;09] IS THE EQUIVALENT OF  
[000:01:45;22] REQUIRING EVERY AMERICAN TO  
[000:01:46;18] FILE A DAILY REPORT WITH  
[000:01:48;22] THE GOVERNMENT OF EVERY

[000:02:08;06] GOES EVEN A STEP FURTHER  
[000:02:09;07] THAN WHAT YOU SAID  
[000:02:10;12] ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF

[000:02:17;00] QUOTING HERE IT GIVES  
[000:02:20;28] GOVERNMENT COMPREHENSIVE

[000:02:33;26] OBAMA ADMINISTRATION  
[000:02:34;20] BEFORE.  
[000:02:35;04] BUT ALSO BY THE PARENTS OF  
[000:02:36;25] MICHAEL STRANGE.  
[000:02:37;20] HE WAS AMONG 25 NAVY SEALS  
[000:02:39;19] AND FIVE OTHER AMERICANS  
[000:02:41;04] KILLED IN A HELICOPTER  
[000:02:42;26] CRASH IN AFGHANISTAN BACK  
[000:02:44;08] IN 2011.  
[000:02:45;03] THE PARENTS ALLEGE THE  
[000:02:46;08] GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE  
[000:02:47;26] ACCESSED THEIR PHONE  
[000:02:48;23] RECORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE  
[000:02:50;08] BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT FOR  
[000:02:51;10] THE CRASH THAT KILLED THEIR  
[000:02:53;27] SON.  
[000:02:54;09] THE ADMINISTRATION HAS YET

[000:03:01;13] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRACKS  
[000:03:02;16] EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO,  
[000:03:04;08] YET, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  
[000:03:05;10] CANNOT LOCATE A 29-YEAR-OLD  
[000:03:07;01] HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.  
[000:03:08;29] >> AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE  
[000:03:10;18] THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS  
[000:03:12;03] LEFT HONG KONG.  
[000:03:13;25] 7 MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT  
[000:03:15;23] CITY, 65,000 HOTEL ROOMS.  
[000:03:16;17] AND NOW THERE IS WORD THAT  
[000:03:18;16] RUSSIA MIGHT BE WILLING TO  
[000:03:22;06] GIVE HIM ASYLUM.  
[000:03:23;27] PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS IF THE  
[000:03:25;16] REQUEST IS MADE IT WILL BE  
[000:03:26;23] CONSIDERED.  
[000:03:27;10] TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM, HE  
[000:03:28;25] WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO GO TO  
[000:03:30;09] THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN  
[000:03:32;25] HONG KONG SNOWDEN WOULD  
[000:03:33;18] HAVE TO APPLY.  
[000:03:34;14] HE ONCE TOLD THE GUARDIAN  
[000:03:35;25] NEWSPAPER THAT HE DOES NOT  
[000:03:37;04] EXPECT TO BE FREE FOREVER  
[000:03:38;14] THOUGH, LISTEN.  
[000:03:39;09] >> YOU CAN'T COME FORWARD  
[000:03:40;13] AGAINST THE WORLD'S MOST  
[000:03:44;08] POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE  
[000:03:45;01] AGENCY AND BE COMPLETELY  
[000:03:46;07] FREE FROM RISK BECAUSE THEY  
[000:03:49;10] ARE SUCH POWERFUL  
[000:03:50;16] ADVERSARIES THAT NO ONE CAN  
[000:03:52;20] MEANINGFULLY OPPOSE THEM.  
[000:03:53;15] IF THEY WANT TO GET YOU  
[000:03:54;12] THEY WILL GET NEW TIME.  
[000:03:56;15] >> SNOWDEN LEFT THE HAWAII

[000:04:14;29] THAT'S THE WORD FROM ONE OF  
[000:04:15;23] THE COLUMNISTS WHO  
[000:04:16;29] PRESENTED HIS STORY.  
[000:04:18;05] >> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

[000:29:44;00] IN TURKEY POLICE FIRING  
[000:29:45;09] TEAR GAS AND RUBBER BULLETS  
[000:29:46;25] AT DEMONSTRATORS.  
[000:29:48;00] THOSE DEMONSTRATORS IN TURN  
[000:29:49;08] THROWING STONES AND SETTING  
[000:29:50;07] UP BARRICADES.  
[000:29:51;14] PROTESTERS SAY THEY ARE  
[000:29:52;17] UNHAPPY ABOUT A NUMBER OF  
[000:29:53;15] THINGS, INCLUDING WHAT THEY  
[000:29:54;10] SEES A A GOVERNMENT  
[000:29:55;13] CRACKDOWN ON THEIR  
[000:29:56;22] FREEDOMS.  
[000:29:57;07] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS  
[000:29:58;05] TURKEY'S LONG-TERM  
[000:29:58;25] STABILITY IS BEST GAINER HE  
[000:30:00;13] TEED BY UPHOLDING PEOPLE'S  
[000:30:02;07] RIGHTS.  
[000:30:02;21] TURKEY IS, OF COURSE, A KEY  
[000:30:04;13] ALLY.  
[000:30:04;29] SHARING BORDERS WITH SYRIA,  
[000:30:06;16] IRAQ AND IRAN.  
[000:30:07;13] WE ARE TOLD PROTESTS HAVE  
[000:30:08;19] SPREAD TO 78 CITIES THERE.  
[000:30:10;18] BUT THE MOST VIOLENT SCENES  
[000:30:12;03] ARE PLAYING OUT IN ISTANBUL  
[000:30:13;28] IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE  
[000:30:14;28] CITY IN AN AREA KNOWN AS  
[000:30:19;18] SQUARE.  
[000:30:20;02] THAT'S WHERE WE ARE SEEING  
[000:30:20;28] IMAGES OF THE  
[000:30:22;15] CONFRONTATION.  
[000:30:23;02] WHERE FIRES RAGING AND BOTH  
[000:30:23;28] SIDES CONTINUE TO STAND  
[000:30:24;27] THEIR GROUND.  
[000:30:25;25] ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE  
[000:30:26;23] HOUSE WITH REACTION  
[000:30:34;09] SPOKESWOMAN FROM THE  
[000:30:35;24] SECURITY COUNSEL KATELYN  
[000:30:36;27] HAYDEN WHO SAYS THERE IS  
[000:30:39;09] CONCERN IT ABOUT THE WHITE  
[000:30:40;27] HOUSE ABOUT THE UNREST AND  
[000:30:42;08] VIOLENCE.  
[000:30:42;23] SHE GOES ON TO SAY QUOTE WE  
[000:30:43;22] ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY  
[000:30:44;19] ATTEMPTS TO PUNISH  
[000:30:45;21] INDIVIDUALS FOR EXERCISING  
[000:30:46;16] THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH  
[000:30:48;00] AS WELL AS ATTEMPTS BY ANY  
[000:30:49;03] PARTY TO PROVOKE VIOLENCE  
[000:30:50;18] WE BELIEVE TODAY'S EVENTS  
[000:30:52;01] REINFORCE THE NEED TO  
[000:30:53;01] RESOLVE THIS SITUATION  
[000:30:54;03] THROUGH I DO DOG AS WE HAVE  
[000:30:55;16] SAID.  
[000:30:55;29] WE BELIEVE THAT TURKEY'S  
[000:30:57;05] LONG-TERM STABILITY,  
[000:30:57;29] SECURITY AND PROSPERITY IS  
[000:30:59;26] BEST GUARANTEED BY  
[000:31:01;04] UPHOLDING THE FUNDAMENTAL  
[000:31:02;24] FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,  
[000:31:04;03] ASSEMBLY ASSOCIATION AND A  
[000:31:05;13] FREE AND INDEPENDENT MEDIA  
[000:31:06;11] YOU CAN SEE THE DEEP  
[000:31:07;14] CONCERN THE WHITE HOUSE IS  
[000:31:08;24] EXPRESSING TONIGHT ABOUT  
[000:31:09;29] THESE PICTURES AND  
[000:31:10;29] IMPORTANT TO NOTE IT WAS  
[000:31:12;10] JUST LAST MONTH THAT THE  
[000:31:13;21] PRIME MINISTER OF TURKEY,  
[000:31:15;14] PRIME MINISTER WAS HERE AT  
[000:31:16;20] THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING  
[000:31:17;25] WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.  
[000:31:18;18] REMEMBER, THEY HAD THAT  
[000:31:19;12] NEWS CONFERENCE IN THE ROSE  
[000:31:21;09] GARDEN IN THE RAIN WHERE  
[000:31:22;03] THE MARINE WAS HOLDING UP  
[000:31:23;03] THE UMBRELLA FOR THE  
[000:31:23;23] PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT  
[000:31:24;19] AT THAT POINT WAS ENGULFED  
[000:31:25;18] IN AWFUL THESE  
[000:31:26;17] CONTROVERSIES ABOUT THE IRS  
[000:31:28;02] AND BENGHAZI, ET CETERA.  
[000:31:29;23] LOST IN ALL OF THAT  
[000:31:30;26] ATTENTION ON THOSE OTHER  
[000:31:32;14] CONTROVERSIES, IS THE FACT  
[000:31:33;25] THAT BOTH PRIME MINISTER  
[000:31:35;22] AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD  
[000:31:37;13] VERY SERIOUS SUBSTANTIVE  
[000:31:38;29] TALKS ABOUT THE U.S. MAYBE  
[000:31:40;08] GETTING MORE AGGRESSIVE IN  
[000:31:41;16] SYRIA SINCE THAT IS RIGHT  
[000:31:42;15] ON THE TURKISH BORDER.  
[000:31:43;22] NOW, THE IDEA THOUGH THAT  
[000:31:45;08] TURKEY MIGHT PLAY A  
[000:31:46;29] CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN  
[000:31:47;21] HELPING THE U.S. AND SYRIA  
[000:31:49;01] IS ALL BUT LOST, GIVEN THE  
[000:31:51;13] FACT THAT HE HAS HIS OWN  
[000:31:53;01] PROBLEMS INSIDE THE BORDERS  
[000:31:54;04] OF TURKEY.  
[000:31:55;19] THE LAST THING HE IS GOING  
[000:31:56;17] TO BE FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW  
[000:31:58;16] IS HELPING THE U.S. WITH  
[000:31:59;21] THIS SITUATION IN SYRIA,  
[000:32:01;21] SHEP.  
[000:32:02;04] >> Shepard: WIDELY SEEN AS  
[000:32:02;28] POORLY HANDLED IN THE EARLY  
[000:32:04;07] GOING HAVE THE PRESIDENT  
[000:32:05;00] AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF  
[000:32:05;25] TURKEY BEEN IN CONTACT  
[000:32:07;01] SINCE ALL OF THIS STARTED?  
[000:32:08;09] >> U.S. OFFICIALS SAY SO  
[000:32:09;10] FAR THERE HAS NOT BEEN  
[000:32:11;11] DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE  
[000:32:12;10] PRESIDENT AND PRIME  
[000:32:13;05] MINISTER.  
[000:32:13;20] INTERESTING THAT WHEN THEY  
[000:32:14;15] HAD THOSE TALKS HERE IN MID  
[000:32:16;01] PLAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:32:17;18] ONE OF THE CONCESSIONS  
[000:32:18;29] PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT FROM  
[000:32:20;00] THE PRIME MINISTER, PRIME  
[000:32:22;03] MINISTER WAS TO GET TURKISH  
[000:32:23;27] SUPPORT FOR A UPCOMING  
[000:32:25;28] CONFERENCE IN GENEVA TO TRY  
[000:32:27;19] AND DEAL WITH THE FUTURE OF  
[000:32:29;26] SYRIA.  
[000:32:30;10] IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE  
[000:32:31;16] THAT IF ASSAD DOES GO,  
[000:32:33;16] PRESIDENT ASSAD DOES GO IN  
[000:32:35;08] SYRIA, THERE WILL BE SOME  
[000:32:36;04] SORT OF PEACEFUL  
[000:32:37;08] TRANSITION AGAIN THE IDEA  
[000:32:39;22] THAT PRIME MINISTER WILL  
[000:32:40;15] NOW BE FOCUSED ON A  
[000:32:42;02] PEACEFUL TRANSITION IN  
[000:32:42;28] SYRIA IS LOST IN THE FACT  
[000:32:44;05] HE HAS GOT MAJOR PROBLEMS  
[000:32:46;00] ON HIS OWN HANDS RIGHT NOW.  
[000:32:47;07] THIS IS A BIG CONCERN FOR  
[000:32:48;05] THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT  
[000:32:49;08] SHEP, BECAUSE THEY HAVE  
[000:32:50;01] ALREADY GOT THIS  
[000:32:51;03] INSTABILITY IN SYRIA.  
[000:32:53;18] INSTABILITY, INSTABILITY  
[000:32:54;28] SPREADING INTO TURKEY, A  
[000:32:56;14] KEY U.S. AL FLY THAT REGION  
[000:32:57;29] IS A DESPERATE SITUATION  
[000:32:59;10] FOR THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:33:00;00] TONIGHT SHEP.  
[000:33:01;03] >> Shepard: INDEED IT IS,  
[000:33:02;26] ED HENRY AT THE WHITE  
[000:33:03;23] HOUSE.  
[000:33:04;06] AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK LIVE  
[000:33:06;08] THIS IS TAKSIM A LARGE  
[000:33:09;27] SQUARE IN THE CENTER OF THE  
[000:33:11;06] CITY.  
[000:33:11;19] ANOTHER SQUARE NEAR WHERE  
[000:33:12;13] ALL OF THIS BEGAN.  
[000:33:13;04] IT'S ACTUALLY JUST A VERY  
[000:33:14;16] SMALL PARK.  
[000:33:15;11] AND IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO  
[000:33:16;08] THIS AND HAD WHAT AMOUNTED  
[000:33:18;01] TO THE LAST GREEN SPACE IN  
[000:33:19;26] ALL OF THIS PART OF THE  
[000:33:21;07] CITY.  
[000:33:21;20] THAT'S HOW ALL OF THIS  
[000:33:22;13] BEGAN WITH A GROUP OF  
[000:33:23;21] PROTESTERS WHO WANTED TO  
[000:33:24;16] SAVE THE TREES.  
[000:33:25;13] THE PRIME MINISTER HAS  
[000:33:26;07] ASKED TO MEET WITH THEM  
[000:33:27;23] TOMORROW BUT THEY ARE NOW  
[000:33:29;05] REFUSING.  
[000:33:29;20] AT 2:30 IN THE MORNING WE  
[000:33:30;29] KNOW HE WILL BE MEETING  
[000:33:32;01] TOMORROW WITH SOME SORT OF  
[000:33:33;12] FAMOUS PEOPLE AND THE  
[000:33:35;06] PROTESTERS, THE ORIGINAL  
[000:33:36;16] PROTESTERS ARE SAYING THIS  
[000:33:37;12] IS JUST THE BEGINNING, THAT  
[000:33:39;13] THIS WILL NOW SPREAD AND IT  
[000:33:40;28] WILL GROW.  
[000:33:41;24] JOINING US NOW FROM CONTEXT  
[000:33:43;10] AND PERSPECTIVE AMBASSADOR  
[000:33:45;06] STEWART HOLIDAY.  
[000:33:45;25] HE IS THE FORMER U.S.  
[000:33:47;02] AMBASSADOR FOR SPECIAL  
[000:33:47;27] POLITICAL AFFAIRS AT THE  
[000:33:48;20] UNITED NATIONS.  
[000:33:49;14] SIR, WITH WHAT DEGREE OF  
[000:33:50;25] CONCERN DO YOU WATCH THIS?  
[000:33:52;00] >> WELL, I THINK IT'S  
[000:33:54;20] OBVIOUSLY VERY TROUBLING.  
[000:33:55;26] BUT THIS IS REALLY WHAT  
[000:33:57;06] BEGAN AS A DEMONSTRATION  
[000:33:58;19] ABOUT URBAN REDEVELOPMENT  
[000:33:59;21] AND THEE TREES IS REALLY  
[000:34:01;04] NOW A PROXY FOR THE FIFTH%  
[000:34:02;19] OF THE POPULATION OF TURKEY  
[000:34:04;15] THAT DOESN'T FEEL THAT THE  
[000:34:05;23] PRIME MINISTER REPRESENTS  
[000:34:06;25] THEIR INTERESTS.  
[000:34:07;18] AND I THINK IT'S ALL GOING  
[000:34:08;23] TO BE IN HOW THE PRIME  
[000:34:11;00] MINISTER HANDLES THIS AND  
[000:34:12;18] SO FAR HE HAS GONE BACK AND  
[000:34:16;00] FORTH BETWEEN BEING  
[000:34:17;05] CONCILIATORY AND BEING  
[000:34:18;05] TOUGH.  
[000:34:18;18] IN TURKEY, ULTIMATELY THE  
[000:34:19;29] TOUGH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT  
[000:34:20;23] RESPONSE IS GOING TO CARRY  
[000:34:21;23] THE DAY.  
[000:34:22;28] >> RIGHT NOW, THERE THERE  
[000:34:25;17] IS -- THEY ARE STILL  
[000:34:26;11] ALLOWING THE PROTESTERS TO  
[000:34:27;15] BE IN THIS SMALLER PARK.  
[000:34:30;16] GIZY PARK I BELIEVE IT'S  
[000:34:33;05] PRONOUNCED.  
[000:34:33;21] THEY ARE ALLOWING THE  
[000:34:34;23] PROTESTS TO CONTINUE THERE  
[000:34:35;19] THE CONCERN IS IF POLICE  
[000:34:37;05] MOVE IN ON THAT AND SHOULD  
[000:34:38;18] ANYBODY BE INJURED, FOUR  
[000:34:39;20] PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEEN  
[000:34:41;17] KILLED.  
[000:34:42;01] THIS COULD CAN HE IS LATE  
[000:34:42;25] TO SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT  
[000:34:43;21] IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO  
[000:34:44;25] CONTROL.  
[000:34:45;09] IS THAT YOUR TAKE ON IT.  
[000:34:46;04] >> RIGHT NOW THE MAJORITY  
[000:34:47;02] OF PEOPLE WHEN I SAY THAT I  
[000:34:48;28] MEAN THE PEOPLE OUT IN THE  
[000:34:49;29] RURAL AREAS, THE SILENT  
[000:34:51;05] MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE  
[000:34:51;27] SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER.  
[000:34:52;26] THESE ARE THE PEOPLE ASIAN  
[000:34:55;03] SIDE OF THE -- THEY SUPPORT  
[000:34:56;08] THE POLICE.  
[000:34:57;00] BUT, IF THERE IS ANY  
[000:34:58;09] FURTHER VIOLENCE OR  
[000:34:59;25] ESCALATION OF THIS, IT  
[000:35:01;12] COULD TRIGGER A BACK FIRE  
[000:35:03;23] FOR THE PRIME MINISTER.  
[000:35:04;16] HE HAS GOT TO BE VERY VERY  
[000:35:06;11] CAREFUL ABOUT HOW HE  
[000:35:08;06] HANDLES THIS IN THE COMING  
[000:35:10;01] 24 HOUR PEOPLE.  
[000:35:12;13] >> Shepard: HE NEEDS  
[000:35:13;04] DIALOGUE AND SO FAR THE  
[000:35:14;14] PROTESTERS HAVE DENIED IT?  
[000:35:15;08] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:35:15;27] HE DOES NEED TO SHOW THAT  
[000:35:16;22] HE IS WILLING TO REACH OUT.  
[000:35:18;18] HE HAS DEVELOPED THIS  
[000:35:20;23] REPUTATION, A VERY TOUGH  
[000:35:22;25] LEADER BUT FOR HIM, IS HE  
[000:35:24;10] RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  
[000:35:25;02] AND HE WANTS TO BE THE  
[000:35:26;23] FIRST POPULARLY ELECTED  
[000:35:28;01] PRESIDENT IN TURKISH  
[000:35:29;11] HISTORY IN 2014.  
[000:35:30;17] FOR HIM, HE IS GOING TO  
[000:35:31;24] NEED TO HANDLE THIS VERY  
[000:35:33;09] CAREFULLY.  
[000:35:33;25] >> AMBASSADOR STEWART  
[000:35:34;19] HOLIDAY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE  
[000:35:35;14] THAT HE HAS ALREADY TRIED  
[000:35:36;13] TO PUT MORE POWERS TO THAT  
[000:35:38;19] OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY AN  
[000:35:40;13] OFFICE TO WHICH HE WANTS TO  
[000:35:42;16] MOVE.  
[000:35:42;29] WE SHALL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS  
[000:35:43;28] OUT AND WE HAVE CONTINUING  
[000:35:45;12] COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE  
[000:35:46;04] NIGHT AND THE WEEKS AHEAD.

[000:35:48;23] ADMITS HE SHOT AN UNARMED  
[000:35:50;17] TEENAGER NAMED TRAVON  
[000:35:51;16] MARTIN BACK IN COURT TODAY  
[000:35:52;21] AND LOOKING VERY DIFFERENT.  
[000:35:53;27] NOW, HIS BROTHER IS  
[000:35:54;22] SPEAKING OUT ABOUT GEORGE  
[000:35:57;00] ZIMMERMAN'S DRAMATIC WEIGHT  
[000:35:58;04] GAIN.  
[000:35:58;17] PLUS, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO  
[000:35:59;27] STAY AWAKE AT WORK.  
[000:36:01;26] ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE  
[000:36:02;25] HANDLING SOMEBODY'S MONEY.  
[000:36:04;26] WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT ONE  
[000:36:06;04] WORKER'S NAP ON HIS  
[000:36:07;26] COMPUTER KEYBOARD THAT  
[000:36:09;03] NEARLY COST HIS BANK  
[000:36:10;26] HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

[000:36:22;08] THEORY OF RELATIVITY,
[000:36:25;08] THE NEXT...  NOT SO MUCH.

[000:39:54;08] TIME FINDING JURORS FOR

[000:49:39;24] BEHIND THE WHEEL IN VARIOUS  
[000:49:41;10] SITUATIONS.

[000:49:43;02] GETTING SIDESWIPED IS JUST  
[000:49:44;24] ABOUT AS NERVE-RACKING AS

[000:49:52;08] DOM.  
[000:49:52;20] FIGHT THESE FOLKS IN  
[000:49:54;12] ONTARIO, CANADA.  
[000:49:55;00] THEY SAY THEY WERE TRYING  
[000:49:56;12] TO JUMP THEIR JEEP OVER  
[000:49:57;23] THAT GROUND SWIMMING POOL.

[000:50:22;26] EARLY 40S.

[000:50:27;23] MOST WOMEN SAID MEN NEVER  
[000:50:29;06] STOP BEING CHILDISH.
