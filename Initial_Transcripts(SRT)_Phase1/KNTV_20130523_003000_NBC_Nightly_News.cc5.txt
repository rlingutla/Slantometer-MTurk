[000:09:21;460] >> Reporter: GOOD EVENING,
[000:09:22;128] BRIAN.
[000:09:22;595] IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MORE
[000:09:23;329] SECRETIVE ASPECTS OF THE
[000:09:24;730] GOVERNMENT'S WAR AGAINST AL
[000:09:25;398] QAEDA AND OTHER EXTREMISTS.
[000:09:26;065] NOW IT'S LESS SECRET.
[000:09:26;866] FOR THE FIRST TIME THE OBAMA
[000:09:27;567] ADMINISTRATION IS CONFIRMING
[000:09:28;267] WHAT WE HAD ALREADY REPORTED FOR
[000:09:29;001] SOME TIME -- THAT THE GOVERNMENT

[000:09:30;469] AL-AWLAKI FOR DEATH VIA DRONE
[000:09:31;170] STRIKE IN YEMEN.

[000:09:52;024] AMERICANS INCLUDING THE
[000:09:54;327] ATTEMPTED UNDERWEAR BOMBER
[000:09:56;028] ATTACK AND THE PLOT TO HIDE
[000:09:56;696] BOMBS ON CARGO PLANES MADE HIM A
[000:09:57;430] LEGALLY JUSTIFIED TARGET BECAUSE
[000:09:58;164] HE WAS AN IMMINENT THREAT, COULD
[000:09:58;898] NOT BE CAPTURED AND WAS A
[000:09:59;999] LEGITIMATE TARGET UNDER THE LAWS
[000:10:01;867] OF WAR.

[000:27:11;963] EMERGING IN JOPLIN, ONE THAT
[000:27:13;632] LOOKS ALMOST NOTHING LIKE THIS
[000:27:18;169] 22-MILE PATH OF DESTRUCTION.
[000:27:20;438] >> DEVASTATION IS A SHORT WHILE,
[000:27:21;172] BUT DETERMINATION LASTS ALL THE
[000:27:21;906] TIME.

[000:28:37;682] BURIED UNDER GROUND.

[000:28:39;684] WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
[000:28:41;653] SUFFER, BUT WE ALSO KNOW WHAT
[000:28:43;088] IT'S LIKE TO GET BACK UP.
[000:28:45;790] >> TRY TO SAY THE RIGHT THINGS
[000:28:47;058] THAT CAN COME EVEN WHENEVER IT
[000:28:49;494] DOESN'T SEEM THERE COULD BE
[000:28:52;030] ANOTHER BRIGHT DAY.

[000:28:58;870] CELEBRATE AS THIS TOWN REBUILDS,
[000:29:02;841] BUT IT IS THE STRENGTH OF ITS

[000:29:49;320] >>> GOOD EVENING, AND THANK YOU
[000:29:50;288] FOR JOINING US.
[000:29:51;322] I'M JESSICA AGEAR.
[000:29:53;324] >> I'M RAJ MATHAI.
[000:29:54;425] A BATTLE IS BREWING IN THE SOUTH
[000:29:56;194] BAY OVER FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.
[000:29:57;395] AND ACCUSATIONS THAT A WELL
[000:30:00;565] KNOWN WEEKLY NEWSPAPER ALSO
[000:30:01;766] SERVED AS AN ONLINE BROTHEL.
[000:30:03;334] THE METRO NEWSPAPER HAS A LINK
[000:30:05;003] ON ITS OWN WEBSITE FOR ADULT
[000:30:07;438] ESCORT SERVICES AND CRITICS ARE
[000:30:09;507] DEMANDING THE NEWSPAPER REMOVE
[000:30:10;575] IT.
[000:30:10;809] THE METRO SAYS THE CRITICISM IS
[000:30:12;944] THE RESULT OF RUFFLED FURTHERS
[000:30:15;647] OVER ITS REPORTING OF LOCAL
[000:30:19;751] POLITICS.
[000:30:20;418] DAVID TRUJILLO JOINS US NOW.
[000:30:22;053] THE PAPER SAYS THEY'RE BEING
[000:30:23;955] UNFAIRLY TARGETED.
[000:30:24;722] ARE THEY BREAKING ANY LAWS WITH
[000:30:26;257] THE WEBSITE LINK?
[000:30:28;026] >> Reporter: DOESN'T SEEM TO AT
[000:30:28;927] THIS POINT, RAJ.
[000:30:30;228] THE METRO HAS BEEN DOING SOME
[000:30:31;296] GOOD AND EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATIVE
[000:30:33;531] REPORTING ON LOCAL POLITICIANS
[000:30:35;600] AND CANDIDATES.
[000:30:36;334] THE EDITOR AND CEO TELLS ME
[000:30:38;036] THAT'S THE REASON THESE
[000:30:39;270] ACCUSATIONS ARE COMING OUT.
[000:30:40;338] BUT CRITICS SAY THIS IS ABOUT
[000:30:43;074] ADVERTISEMENT THAT EXPLOITS
[000:30:43;641] WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
[000:30:48;079] LO
[000:30:50;548] LOGON TO THE METRO WEBSITE AND
[000:30:52;383] YOU'LL FIND A SECTION FOR ADULT
[000:30:54;552] ESCORT SERVICES.
[000:30:55;320] SOME IMAGES ARE TOO GRAPHIC TO
[000:30:57;956] BROADCAST.
