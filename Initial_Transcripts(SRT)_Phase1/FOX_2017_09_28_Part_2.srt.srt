1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,503
AS CANDIDATE COULD TAKE THAT IF 
HE WAS STILL A REPUBLICAN THE   

2
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:08,607
PRESIDENT WOULDN'T ENDORSE HIM? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:12,244
HYPOTHETICALS THAT A CANDIDATE  
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE OVER THE    

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,946
TIME THAT THE PRESIDENT IS THE  
PRESIDENT.                      

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,181
I KNOW WHERE THE PRESIDENT      
STANDS ON CERTAIN ISSUES.       

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,084
THAT'S WHAT I CAN SPEAK ABOUT,  
NOT SOMEBODY THAT IS A CANDIDATE

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,889
FOR ANOTHER OFFICE THAT IS NOT  
HERE.                           

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,326
>> I DIDN'T GET -- TOM DID NOT  
CALL ON ME.                     

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,129
I'M GOING TO ASK A QUESTION I   
WANT TO UNDERSTAND.             

10
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:34,166
HE MENTIONED IN RESPONSE TO WHAT
SENATOR RUBIO WAS SAYING ASKING 

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,803
THE PENTAGON TO BE IN CHARGE,   
THAT THE PENTAGON IS IN CHARGE  

12
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:46,245
OF A LOT BUT NOT                
IN CHARGE AND WHAT THE RESPONSE 

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,013
IS.                             
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH

14
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:52,051
STATE OFFICIALS INCLUDING       
GOVERNOR WHO AS TOM SAID WE HAVE

15
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,686
CONFIDENCE IN, BUT WE'RE        
SUPPLEMENTING AND AUGMENTING    

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:01:00,926
THAT WITH FEDERAL RESOURCES     
INCLUDING OVER 10,000 FEDERAL   

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,730
EMPLOYEES AND ONE STAR GENERAL  
THERE ON THE GROUND.            

18
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,332
>> WHY IS NOT ONE ENTITY IN     
CHARGE?                         

19
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,003
HE SAID MANY PEOPLE WERE IN     
CHARGE OF DIFFERENT THINGS.     

20
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,206
WHY IS ONE PERSON NOT IN CHARGE?
>> I BELIEVE ONE PERSON IS IN   

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,908
CHARGE OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF    
THIS PROCESS.                   

22
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,544
THE GOVERNOR IS STILL THE       
GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO.        

23
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,246
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH   
THEM, BEING IN CONSTANT CONTACT 

24
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,715
AND WE HAVE ONE PERSON IN CHARGE
OF THE FEDERAL COMPONENT OF     

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,384
THAT.                           
THAT WOULD BE THE ONE-STAR      

26
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:30,122
GENERAL ON THE GROUNDWORKING    
WITH STATE OFFICIALS.           

27
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,326
>> I KNOW YOU SAID THE WHITE    
HOUSE DOESN'T APPROVE CHARTER   

28
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,563
FLIGHTS AHEAD OF TIME.          
GENERALLY SPEAKING, GIVEN THE   

29
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:43,068
FOCUS OF THE PRESIDENT ON COST  
SAVINGS, LIKE YOU SAID, NOT JUST

30
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:48,907
DRAINING THE SWAMP AND WANT     
PEOPLE TO SPEND MONEY IN BETTER 

31
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:54,146
WAYS, IS A GUIDANCE ABOUT FLYING
COMMERCIAL AND HOW THEY SHOULD  

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,082
BE TRAVEL SOMETHING.            
>> WE'RE LOOKING INTO THAT WHEN 

33
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,185
IT COMES TO MILITARY AIRCRAFT.  
THAT'S A PART WHERE THE WHITE   

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,388
HOUSE DOES PLAY A ROLE.         
ON THAT FRONT, THE TRUMP        

35
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,192
ADMINISTRATION HAS ACTUALLY     
AUTHORIZED FAR FEWER FLIGHTS FOR

36
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,129
SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAN
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID    

37
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:13,565
DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD DID.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO     

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,569
BRING THAT BACK UNDER THE PLACES
WHERE THE WHITE HOUSES THAT THAT

39
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,372
DIRECT CONTROL AND AUTHORITY,   
WHICH IS UNDER MILITARY AIRCRAFT

40
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,509
WHICH WE CUT BACK SIGNIFICANTLY.
>> ON THE GROWING WAR OF        

41
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,145
COMMENTS, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT 
TO TALK ABOUT FROM THE RACE.    

42
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,883
BUT FROM THE PODIUM DO YOU WANT 
TO CONDEMN THE SENTIMENTS THAT  

43
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,986
THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT SHARE?   
>> I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY WE     

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,121
DON'T AGREE WITH THOSE COMMENTS 
IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT I'M  

45
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:42,528
GOING TO GET IN THE BACK AND    
FORTH OVER ANOTHER CANDIDATE,   

46
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:49,201
WE'RE HERE TO FOCUS ON THE      
PRESIDENT.                      

47
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,471
>> ONE MORE QUESTION ON         
SECRETARY PRICE'S FLIGHT.       

48
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:56,875
ON ONE OF THOSE FLIGHTS,        
KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS FLYING WITH

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,045
HIM ON THE PRIVATE FLIGHT.      
ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT         

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,183
SPECIFICALLY TO SEE --          
>> I DIDN'T SAY WE WERE NOT     

51
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,984
AWARE.                          
I SAID WE DON'T AUTHORIZE THOSE 

52
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:09,488
PRIVATE CHARTER FLIGHTS.        
WE'RE DOING AN INTERNAL REVIEW  

53
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:14,526
AT HHS OF ALL PRIVATE CHARTER   
FLIGHTS AS WELL AS AN I.G.      

54
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:19,865
REVIEW THAT WILL BE CONDUCTED OF
ALL OF THEM.                    

55
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,801
JULIE?                          
>> AS THE PRESIDENT IS WATCHING 

56
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,071
THIS COVERAGE IN PUERTO RICO, IS
HE SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE SEES  

57
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:30,609
AS A RESPONSE THERE?            
IS HE SATISFIED IN WHAT HE'S    

58
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,746
HEARING FROM HIS ADVISERS OR    
WOULD HE LIKE TO SEE THINGS     

59
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,349
MOVING ALONG FASTER AS PEOPLE ON
THE GROUND HAVE ASKED FOR?      

60
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,052
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO       
CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

61
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:44,089
TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND       
SECURITY OF THE PEOPLE BOTH AT  

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:49,661
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND     
PUERTO RICO.                    

63
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:52,030
TOM SPOKE IN DEPTH ABOUT THAT   
PROCESS.                        

64
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,933
THAT'S OUR FOCUS AND THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO.         

65
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,670
PEOPLE FIRST, PAPERWORK SECOND. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS EMPOWERED ALL 

66
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,906
OF HIS AGENCIES TO GO FORWARD   
WITH THAT MINDSET.              

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,810
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO      
CONTINUE TO DO.                 

68
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,981
>> I SAW THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 
HERE WITH AN EVENT FOR THE FIRST

69
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,549
LADY.                           
DID HE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK    

70
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:17,222
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF HIS PRIVATE  
JET OR HAS HE HAD A ONE-ON-ONE  

71
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,891
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT?        
WHEN YOU SAID THE WHITE HOUSE   

72
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,996
ORDERED A HALT ON THAT, IS THAT 
ADMINISTRATIONWIDE, EVERY AGENCY

73
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,298
OR --                           
>> SPECIFIC TO HHS.             

74
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,933
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY SPOKE    
TODAY.                          

75
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,836
I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SPOKEN    
ABOUT THIS ISSUE PREVIOUSLY.    

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,306
I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT   
SAW THE SECRETARY AT ANY POINT  

77
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:45,183
TODAY THOUGH.                   
>> FOLLOWING UP ON THAT.        

78
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:49,621
DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THAT THEY   
WERE EMPOWERED TO GO ON PRIVATE 

79
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,357
JETS?                           
WE HAVE THE HHS SECRETARY, THE  

80
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,928
EPA ADMINISTRATOR, THE TREASURY 
SECRETARY TOOK A FLIGHT ON A    

81
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:02,801
PRIVATE JET AND AN ITINERARY    
AVAILABLE COMMERCIALLY?         

82
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,770
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THE     
PRESIDENT HAS SAID --           

83
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,139
>> NOT AT ALL.                  
THE PRESIDENT IS CLEAR ABOUT HIS

84
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:13,945
POSITION BY STATING VERY CLEARLY
THAT HE IS NOT THRILLED WITH THE

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,550
AIRPLANE USE AT THIS POINT.     
>> TWO THINGS.                  

86
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:24,456
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE   
REVIEW PROCESS HERE OF PRICE AND

87
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,957
OTHERS.                         
THERE'S AN I.T. REVIEW.         

88
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,127
IS THERE A WHITE HOUSE          
COMPONENT?                      

89
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,831
IS ANYONE --                    
>> FOR HHS SPECIFICALLY, THEY'RE

90
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:37,002
CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL REVIEW AS
WELL AS AN I.G. REVIEW.         

91
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,707
THE WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING AT   
MORE OF AN OVERALL NOT SPECIFIC 

92
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,209
TO THAT DEPARTMENT BECAUSE      
THERE'S ALREADY TWO REVIEWS     

93
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,347
TAKING PLACE THERE.             
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD  

94
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,882
DONATE PERSONAL FUNDS TO HARVEY 
RELIEF.                         

95
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,851
DID HE MAKE ANY DONATION TO     
PUERTO RICO?                    

96
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,053
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM      
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THAT.        

97
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,056
HE DIDN'T MAKE A DONATION TO    
HARVEY RELIEF.                  

98
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,326
HE MADE A DONATION TO RELIEF    
ORGANIZATIONS.                  

99
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,831
THE RED CROSS AND MANY OTHERS   
THAT ARE A PART OF ALL OF THE   

100
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,033
HURRICANES THAT WE'VE           
EXPERIENCED THE LAST SEVERAL    

101
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:20,278
WEEKS.                          
SO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT  

102
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,747
LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC, NOR ARE  
THE DONATION AS SPECIFIC STORM. 

103
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,181
THEY GO TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS  
THAT ARE HELPING AGGRESSIVELY   

104
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,583
AND INTENSELY IN THE RECOVERY   
EFFORTS IN THE U.S. VIRGIN      

105
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,687
ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO AS WELL.
>> WE SAW STEVE SCALISE WITH    

106
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,556
THAT EMOTIONAL REMARKS IN THE   
HOUSE CHAMBER TODAY.            

107
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,794
DID THE PRESIDENT SPEAK TO HIM  
TO WELCOME HIM BACK?            

108
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,864
>> I KNOW THEY DID SPEAK TODAY. 
I DON'T HAVE MANY DETAILS.      

109
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:43,201
I KNOW HE CERTAINLY WELCOMED HIM
BACK AND REMINDED HIM THAT WE   

110
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,939
WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP HE AND HIS
FAMILY IN OUR PRAYERS.          

111
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:55,847
>> AND GIVEN THE DISASTER IN    
PUERTO RICO, IS THE PRESIDENT   

112
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,950
DELAYING HIS TRIP?              
>> AS OF RIGHT NOW, WE FEEL     

113
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,920
COMFORTABLE WITH THE PRESIDENT  
TAKING A TRIP.                  

114
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,191
IF THERE WAS ANY INDICATION THAT
IT WOULD HALT RELIEF EFFORTS, WE

115
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:09,461
WOULD RECONSIDER AND PULL THAT  
TRIP BACK.                      

116
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,497
BUT RIGHT NOW IT WOULD BE       
HELPFUL FOR HIM TO BE THERE.    

117
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,535
>> HAS JARED KUSHNER OR ANY     
OTHER STAFF MEMBER TAKEN A      

118
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,571
PRIVATE PLANE RIDE SINCE THEIR  
JOINING THIS ADMINISTRATION OR  

119
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,674
BE GIVEN ACCESS IN SOME FORT TO 
RIDE ALONG WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?  

120
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,112
>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THOSE TWO 
SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS.           

121
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:37,489
I HAVE TO LOOK.                 
>> I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT CUBA.  

122
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,994
THERE'S RECORDEDLY WITHDRAW OF  
FAMILY AND STAFF THERE.         

123
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,231
>> AT THIS POINT, I'M NOT GOING 
TO GET AHEAD OF ANY POTENTIAL   

124
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,999
ACTION THAT MAY TAKE PLACE      
THERE.                          

125
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,303
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING NEW TO    
ADD.                            

126
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:56,274
>> CUBA SAYS IT WARNED THE U.S. 
AGAINST TAKING ANY HASTY ACTIONS

127
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,211
IN RESPONSE TO THESE INCIDENTS  
TARGETING DIPLOMATS.            

128
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:03,281
HOW DOES THE U.S. RESPOND TO    
THAT?                           

129
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,650
>> WE HAVEN'T TAKEN ANY ACTION  
RIGHT NOW.                      

130
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,787
WHEN WE DO THAT WE'LL LET YOU   
KNOW.                           

131
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,990
I CAN ASSURE YOU OUR GOAL IS ON 
THE FOCUS OF WHAT IS BEST FOR   

132
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:16,228
THIS COUNTRY, NOT WHAT IS BEST  
FOR CUBA.                       

133
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,331
                                
JOHN.                           

134
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,067
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT  
PLAYERS THAT KNEEL DURING A     

135
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,169
NATIONAL ANTHEM OUGHT TO BE     
FIRED.                          

136
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:30,909
YOU YOURSELF HAVE SAID FROM THE 
PODIUM IN RESPONSE TO A VERY    

137
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:36,848
CRITICAL TWEET BY AN ESPN ANCHOR
THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL OUGHT TO BE

138
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,184
FIRED.                          
YOU SAID IT WAS A FIREABLE      

139
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,154
OFFENSE, WHICH BRINGS ME TO     
SECRETARY PRICE.                

140
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:50,729
HIS EXTENSIVE USE BY THESE      
PRIVATE JETS, WHY IS THAT NOT A 

141
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:55,166
FIREABLE OFFENSE IS MY FIRST    
QUESTION AND HAS HE OFFERED TO  

142
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,470
REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY 
WAY FOR HIS USE OF THOSE PRIVATE

143
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,405
JETS?                           
>> I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,974
WE WOULD DETERMINED ONCE THE    
REVIEWS ARE COMPLETE.           

145
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,279
IN TERMS OF REIMBURSEMENT, I'M  
NOT SURE.                       

146
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:11,349
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.           
>> ON THE ISSUE -- WE'RE        

147
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,686
UNDERSTANDING THAT MANY OF THE  
NFL PLAYERS ARE STILL VERY UPSET

148
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,089
WITH THIS BACK AND FORTH --     
>> I THINK SO ARE MANY          

149
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,925
AMERICANS.                      
MORE AMERICANS THAN NFL PLAYERS.

150
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,227
>> CAN I FINISH MY QUESTION?    
>> SURE.                        

151
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,063
>> MANY NFL PLAYERS ARE VERY    
UPSET.                          

152
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,199
MANY PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT IDEAS 
AND OPINIONS ON THIS.           

153
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,770
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WEIGHED IN,  
THE NFL SAID WE'RE GOING TO BE  

154
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,072
UNITED.                         
THERE'S AN ANTICIPATION THAT IT 

155
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,907
COULD GROW EVEN MORE SEE THIS   
WEEKEND.                        

156
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,810
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT           
ANTICIPATING, WHAT SHOULD WE    

157
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,147
EXPECT HIM TO SAY ABOUT THIS?   
IT'S NOW THE NFL AGAINST THE    

158
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,416
PRESIDENT.                      
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS    

159
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,252
MADE VERY CLEAR.                
THIS SHOULDN'T BE ABOUT THE NFL 

160
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,021
BEING AGAINST THE PRESIDENT.    
THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT OUR COUNTRY

161
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,058
COMING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT THE  
FLAG, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.      

162
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,560
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH      
HAVING PRIDE IN THE UNITED      

163
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,597
STATES.                         
THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY    

164
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,434
CLEAR ON THAT AND HE'S NOT GOING
TO BACK AWAY FROM THAT.         

165
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,937
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING PRIDE. 
THEY SAID THEY'RE PATRIOTS, THEY

166
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,641
LOVE THIS COUNTRY BUT THEY'RE   
CHALLENGING THE SYSTEM AND      

167
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,744
THEY'RE LOOKING AT HISTORY LIKE 
THE CHALLENGE OF THE SYSTEM WHEN

168
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,014
IT CAME TO WOMENS RIGHTS ISSUES 
AS WELL AS CIVIL RIGHTS.        

169
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:20,051
WHAT DOES THE PRESIDENT SAY WHEN
YOU LOOK AT HISTORY AND SEE HOW 

170
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,054
PEOPLE LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND    
WANTED TO CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM  

171
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,790
TO MAKE IT BETTER?              
>> IF WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT    

172
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,393
HISTORY, WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE  
THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS THAT HAVE

173
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,895
GIVEN THEIR LIFE TO PROTECT THAT
FLAG, THAT ANTHEM.              

174
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,531
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING THOSE  
PEOPLE.                         

175
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,135
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER.  
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT EVERY   

176
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,171
WAY WE CAN TO CELEBRATE OUR     
COUNTRY, BRING IT TOGETHER, NOT 

177
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,074
LOOKING AT WAYS TO DIVIDE IT.   
THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT  

178
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,178
WHAT WE'RE FOR, NOT ABOUT WHAT  
WE'RE AGAINST.                  

179
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,115
CERTAINLY THIS ADMINISTRATION   
WILL ALWAYS BE FOR PROTECTION   

180
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,818
AND CELEBRATION OF THE FLAG AND 
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.            

181
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,390
THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE.     
>> TO CLARIFY ON THAT.          

182
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,660
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TO
CLARIFY.                        

183
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,595
I THINK IT WAS BLACK AND WHITE  
THERE.                          

184
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,897
>> PEOPLE ARE VERY DIVIDED ON   
THIS ISSUE.                     

185
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,700
IT'S A RACIAL ISSUE FOR SOME    
PEOPLE.                         

186
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,236
THE QUESTION IS, WHEN THE       
MILITARY ISSUE IS BROUGHT IN,   

187
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,073
THE MILITARY GOES AND FIGHTS FOR
THE FREEDOMS OF THIS NATION.    

188
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:19,177
THESE PLAYERS ARE SAYING THEY'RE
THANKFUL FOR THE MILITARY       

189
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,814
SERVICE TO ALLOW --             
>> WE ALL ARE.                  

190
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,718
>> IS THERE SOME TYPE OF        
CONFUSION HERE OR IS THIS US    

191
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:32,257
VERSUS THEM KIND OF SCENARIO?   
>> THIS SHOULDN'T BE.           

192
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,660
IT'S NOT AN US VERSUS THEM.     
THIS SHOULD BRING OUR COUNTRY   

193
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,196
TOGETHER.                       
THESE ARE SYMBOLS OF WHAT OUR   

194
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,833
COUNTRY STAND FOR AND SHOULD BE 
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THAT IS.   

195
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:46,237
THIS SHOULD BE A UNIFYING MOMENT
WHEN THE NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYS. 

196
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,908
ALL AMERICANS SHOULD SALUTE THE 
FLAG AND THE ANTHEM AND BE A    

197
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,911
PART OF THE PROCESS.            
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE        

198
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,147
BELIEVED NFL TEAM OWNERS ARE    
AFRAID OF THEIR PLAYERS.        

199
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,317
WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?      
>> PROBABLY THE BACKLASH OF THE 

200
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,119
PLAYERS AND THE STANCE THEY'RE  
MAKING.                         

201
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,822
NOT WANTING TO CREATE THAT      
CONFLICT WITHIN THEIR TEAM.     

202
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,990
THE PRESIDENT IS HERE TO LEAD   
THE COUNTRY.                    

203
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,394
HE FEELS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT    
THIS AS DO MOST AMERICANS       

204
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,997
BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY AGREE    
WITH HIM AS WE'VE SEEN NOT JUST 

205
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:18,136
IN THE PUBLIC SUPPORT BUT ALSO  
IN PUBLIC POLLING ON THAT VERY  

206
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:27,512
SPECIFIC ISSUE.                 
>> [QUESTION INAUDIBLE]         

207
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,447
>> I BELIEVE THEY SPOKE         
YESTERDAY MORNING ON THIS       

208
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,549
MORNING.                        
WE'LL HAVE A READ OUT OR THAT.  

209
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:37,388
>> FOLLOW UP JUST QUICKLY ON THE
NFL THING.                      

210
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,958
I MAY NOT BE THE BRIGHTEST GUY  
IN THE ROOM.                    

211
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,093
>> YOU SAID IT.                 
>> MY QUESTION --               

212
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,864
>> NOBODY ELSE ARGUED EITHER.   
>> I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.   

213
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,233
I UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S SAYING   
YOU SHOULDN'T STAND UP.         

214
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,270
IF A GUY IS SITTING THERE GOING 
I DON'T WANT TO STAND UP, HE    

215
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:56,040
STILL RECOGNIZES HE HAS A FIRST 
AMENDMENT RIGHT NOT TO, YES?    

216
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,778
IT'S HIS OPINION.               
OR IS HE ASKING TO US CARVE OUT 

217
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:04,349
AN EXCEPTION TO THE FIRST       
AMENDMENT FOR FREEDOM OF        

218
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,719
EXPRESSION?                     
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY  

219
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,756
CLEAR AND HE FEELS STRONGLY WHEN
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYS,      

220
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,392
PEOPLE SHOULD STAND UP.         
>> I HAVE A SECOND QUESTION.    

221
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,796
THE SECOND QUESTION WAS IN      
REGARDS TO THE PRIVATE E-MAILS. 

222
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,398
THAT HAVE GONE OUT.             
HAS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS STAFF 

223
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:25,036
ON THAT, IS HE CONCERNED ABOUT  
THEM USING PRIVATE E-MAILS FOR  

224
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,872
PUBLIC BUSINESS?                
>> THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN     

225
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,476
CLEAR AND INSTRUCTION ALL STAFF 
TO FULL PLY COMPLY WITH         

226
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,379
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACTS.      
ALL STAFF HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON   

227
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,883
THE NEED TO PRESERVE THOSE      
RECORDS AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO

228
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,119
SO.                             
BRIAN?                          

229
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:45,657
LAST QUESTION.                  
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.      

230
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,894
>> HE TALKED ABOUT SENATOR      
COCHRAN AND THE HEALTHCARE VOTE.

231
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:55,366
HE SAID THAT SENATOR COCHRAN WAS
NOT ABLE TO BE HERE THIS WEEK.  

232
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,437
SENATOR COCHRAN WAS GOING TO    
COME IF THERE WAS A VOTE.       

233
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,474
WAS THE WHITE HOUSE NOT AWARE?  
>> THAT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING,  

234
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,311
AS I SAID.                      
THE SENATOR WAS PHYSICALLY      

235
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:10,081
UNABLE TO BE HERE THIS WEEK.    
WE'RE GLAD THAT WASN'T THE CASE.

236
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,116
THANKS SO MUCH.                 
WE'LL BE IN THE OFFICE THE REST 

237
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:17,422
OF THE DAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER  
QUESTIONS.                      

238
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:21,659
>> THE WHITE HOUSE WRAPPING UP  
THEIR DAILY BRIEFING.           

239
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,697
ALMOST AN HOUR LONG.            
I'M TRACE GALLAGHER IN FOR      

240
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,233
SHEPARD SMITH.                  
WE HAD SARAH SANDERS AND WE ALSO

241
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,936
HAD THE WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND    
SECURITY ADVISER AS WELL AS THE 

242
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,239
CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER HANDLING 
VARIOUS TOPICS.                 

243
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,475
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE    
CRISIS GOING ON IN PUERTO RICO  

244
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,579
AFTER HURRICANE MARIA.          
THE WHITE HOUSE DEFENDED ITS    

245
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:47,218
DECISION TO WAIT TO WAIVE THE   
JONES ACT AND LET MORE SHIPS    

246
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,420
DELIVER SUPPLIES.               
THE ISLAND IS DEVASTATED.       

247
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,557
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POWER BEING 
OUT ALMOST EVERYWHERE.          

248
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,259
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOOD,  
WATER.                          

249
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,329
THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CASH.    
THE JONES ACT BANS FOREIGN SHIPS

250
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,766
FROM TRANSPORTING SUPPLIES      
BETWEEN THE U.S. PORTS.         

251
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,736
JUST YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT    
SAID THIS WERE ENOUGH AMERICAN  

252
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,538
SHIPS TO DELIVER AID TO PUERTO  
RICO BUT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID   

253
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:13,678
THE PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION 
AFTER A REQUEST FROM THE        

254
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,380
ISLAND'S GOVERNOR.              
LET'S BRING IN JOHN ROBERTS LIVE

255
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,416
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.             
JOHN, THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING 

256
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,620
TO REALLY MAKE THE POINT HERE   
THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH SHIPS TO  

257
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,690
BRING THE GOODS AND SUPPLIES TO 
AND FROM PUERTO RICO.           

258
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,060
WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE IS THE     
ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE     

259
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,396
GOODS ACROSS THE ISLAND.        
>> YEAH.                        

260
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,400
GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU, TRACE.   
I TALKED WITH PEOPLE FROM THE   

261
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,469
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL ABOUT 
THIS IN DEPTH THIS MORNING.     

262
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,040
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY 
OF THE ROADS IN PUERTO RICO ARE 

263
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,942
IMPASSABLE.                     
THEY HAVE BULLDOZERS IN THE     

264
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,977
STREETS NOW.                    
THEY HAVE BACKHOES TRYING TO    

265
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,080
CLEAR THEM.                     
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE HAD THAT   

266
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,917
BACKLOG IN PORTS AND PLACES LIKE
SAN JUAN IN TERMS OF NOT GETTING

267
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,687
THE CONTAINERS FULL OF SUPPLIES 
OUT.                            

268
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,691
THE NSC WAS FIRM ABOUT THIS IDEA
THAT THEY'VE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH

269
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:04,329
CAPACITY IN TERMS OF GETTING    
THINGS TO THE ACTUAL ISLAND.    

270
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:11,703
THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT DECLARED  
ANY KIND OF WAIVER FOR THE JONES

271
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:16,774
ACT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THEY HAD
ENOUGH SHIPS TO GET SUPPLIES IN.

272
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,177
WHEN THE GOVERNOR CALLED THE    
WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 

273
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,581
TO ASK FOR THE WAIVER, THE WHITE
HOUSE THOUGHT IT WAS PRUDENT TO 

274
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,818
DO SO.                          
I ASKED TOM BOSSERT ABOUT THAT  

275
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,821
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IF THEY    
DIDN'T HAVE THAT REQUEST FROM   

276
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,824
THE GOVERNOR, WHETHER THEY WOULD
HAVE LOOKED FOR A WAIVENER THE  

277
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,861
JONES ACT.                      
LET'S WATCH THAT EXCHANGE.      

278
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,699
>> HAD THE GOVERNOR NOT         
REQUESTED PROTECTIVELY A        

279
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,902
WAIVENER THE JONES ACT, WOULD   
YOU HAVE SEEN A COMPELLING      

280
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,240
REASON TO INITIATE --           
>> I WASN'T RECOMMENDING TO THE 

281
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,509
PRESIDENT THAT HE WAIVE THE     
JONES ACT UNTIL I GOT THE       

282
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,112
GOVERNOR'S REQUEST.             
WHEN THE GOVERNOR CALLS AND SAYS

283
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,682
I SEE ON THE HORIZON, I THINK WE
SHOULD LISTEN TO HIM.           

284
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,819
>> SO THE NATIONAL SECURITY     
COUNCIL THOUGHT THERE WAS NO    

285
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,523
PROBLEM IN TERMS OF CAPACITY.   
THEY ACTED OUT OF CAUTION WHEN  

286
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:11,362
THEY GOT THAT REQUEST FROM THE  
GOVERNOR AS WELL AS TOM BOSSERT 

287
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,199
SAYING THE PRESIDENT WILL SEEK  
AN EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL TO    

288
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,268
PROVIDE MORE RELIEF FOR PUERTO  
RICO.                           

289
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:23,141
>> STAND BY.                    
I WANT TO GET TO GERALDO.       

290
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:28,479
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HEARD JOHN  
ROBERTS' CONVERSATION THERE.    

291
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:34,352
IS THERE AN IMPROVING SYSTEM IN 
PLACE NOW OF TRYING TO GET THE  

292
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,121
SUPPLIES, THE WATER, THE FOOD   
ACROSS THE ISLAND?              

293
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,925
>> I DO NOT SEE IT, TRACE.      
I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.   

294
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,961
I'D LOVE TO REPORT THAT         
EVERYTHING WAS FLOWING FREELY,  

295
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,198
THAT EVERYBODY WAS COORDINATED, 
THAT EVERYBODY WAS GETTING      

296
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,734
RELIEF WHERE THEY NEED TO.      
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.           

297
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:55,139
THE RELIEF EFFORT HAS BEEN      
CHAOTIC, IT'S BEEN SPOTTY, IT'S 

298
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,377
BEEN UNDERWHELMING TO SAY THE   
LEAST.                          

299
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:04,148
THERE'S AD HOC ACTS WHERE THEY  
APPEAR TO BE DOING THE RIGHT    

300
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,419
THING.                          
BEHIND ME IS THE VESSEL         

301
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:16,060
ADVENTURE OF THE SEAS, THE ROYAL
CARIBBEAN CRUISE SHIP THAT HAS  

302
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,697
BEEN SENT TO EVACUATE EMPLOYEES 
OF THE ROYAL CARIBBEAN COMPANY. 

303
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:25,203
THERE'S EVACUEES, TOURISTS      
IDENTIFIED BY THE MINISTRY OF   

304
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,673
TOURISM STRANDED IN THEIR       
HOTELS.                         

305
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,142
EVEN HERE THE SITUATION WAS     
CHAOTIC.                        

306
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,980
PEOPLE SCRAMBLING, ELBOWING EACH
OTHER, FIGHTING.                

307
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:43,154
THIS IS ONE MOM THAT CAN RELATE 
HER EXPERIENCES ON THE PIER HERE

308
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,823
TRYING TO GET ON THE ADVENTURE  
OF THE SEAS.                    

309
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,828
>> PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR      
WATER, FIGHTING FOR DIAPERS, FOR

310
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,563
PAMPERS FORKS ANYTHING THEY CAN 
FIND.                           

311
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,799
WE DON'T HAVE WATER, RUNNING    
WATER.                          

312
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:59,804
WE DON'T HAVE ELECTRICITY.      
WE NEED HELP, A LOT OF HELP.    

313
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:08,946
WE'RE NOT HONESTLY -- THERE'S NO
HELP COMING FOR US YET.         

314
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:16,254
THAT'S WHY SHE AND THE OTHER    
2,000 WERE LEAVING ON THIS      

315
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,589
VESSEL.                         
THIS IS AN ISLAND IN DIRE NEED, 

316
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,859
TRACE, AS YOU HAVE BEEN         
REPORTING.                      

317
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,728
IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING NORTH TO  
SOUTH.                          

318
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,132
THEY ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT   
HAD FRESHWATER OR POWER NOW.    

319
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,967
IT'S OVER A WEEK SINCE THIS     
HURRICANE HIT.                  

320
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:34,639
IT CAME ON THE HEELS OF         
HURRICANE IRMA.                 

321
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,943
PUERTO RICO IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL  
PLACE IN THE BEST OF TIMES, A   

322
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,646
BANKRUPT GOVERNMENT.            
NOW THEY HAVE FINALLY, TRAILS,  

323
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,015
APPOINT ADD THREE-STAR GENERAL  
TO COORDINATE.                  

324
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,685
THAT'S WHAT IS SORELY NEEDED    
HERE ON THE GROUND IN PUERTO    

325
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,188
RICO.                           
THEY CALL THIS THE ISLAND OF    

326
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,623
ENCHANTMENT.                    
THIS IS AN ISLAND THAT HAS BEEN 

327
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,927
CURSED BY NATURE.               
IT HAS BEEN HIT BY THESE TWO    

328
00:19:56,061 --> 00:20:00,064
DEVASTATING HURRICANES.         
NOW PEOPLE ARE SCRAMBLING JUST  

329
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:07,138
TO SURVIVE, TRACE.

         <i> So call today.</i>        

369

372
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,821
>> WELL, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TOP  
HEALTH OFFICIAL SHOWING         

373
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,357
CONFIDENCE EVEN AFTER THE       
PRESIDENT SAID HE'S NOT HAPPY   

374
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,960
WITH HIM, HEALTH AND HUMAN      
SERVICES SECRETARY TOM PRICE    

375
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,597
REPORTEDLY TOOK DOZENSES OF     
EXPENSIVE CHARTER FLIGHTS WHEN  

376
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:58,135
CHEAPER FLIGHTS WERE AVAILABLE. 
HERE'S SECRETARY PRICE ON A NEWS

377
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,004
CONFERENCE ON THE UPCOMING FLU  
SEASON.                         

378
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,739
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
FIRED?                          

379
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,642
>> I STILL THINK WE HAVE THE    
CONFIDENCE OF THE PRESIDENT AND 

380
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:08,179
WE WORK ON IMPORTANT ISSUES LIKE
FLU VACCINATION.                

381
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:14,118
>> LET'S BRING IN JOSH GERSTEIN,
THE SENIOR REPORTER FOR POLITCO.

382
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,923
A COUPLE TIMES THE PRESIDENT HAS
GIVEN THE COULD SHOULDER TO     

383
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:24,261
PEOPLE WHEN IT CAME TO SEAN     
SPICER AND STEVE BANNON AND     

384
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:30,234
WHOEVER.                        
BUT THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THOSE 

385
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:34,071
THINGS HE'S ON THIN ICE.        
>> IT LOOKS THAT WAY.           

386
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,541
USUALLY THE WHITE HOUSE IS      
COMBATIVE WHEN THERE'S QUESTIONS

387
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,846
RAISED ABOUT ONE OF THE CABINET 
MEMBERS OR A SENIOR OFFICIAL.   

388
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,915
THEY HAVEN'T CAVED IN ON THE    
ISSUES BEFORE.                  

389
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,018
SO TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT SAY    
WE'LL SEE, THE WHITE HOUSE      

390
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,555
SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO HAD THIS
TRAVEL WHILE THEY DO A REVIEW.  

391
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,459
SARAH SANDERS IN THE BRIEFING WE
SAW DIDN'T SAY THE PRESIDENT HAD

392
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,329
FULL CONFIDENCE IN SECRETARY    
PRICE.                          

393
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:04,802
SHE SAID THE REVIEW IS UNDERWAY.
THE WORDS "WE'LL SEE" LINGER IN 

394
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,971
THE AIR ART THIS POINT.         
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT?      

395
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:11,842
YOU THINK HE SURVIVES OR NO?    
>> I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE HE

396
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,478
MAY HAVE TO GO.                 
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TO LOOK

397
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:17,648
AT, THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN   
DOING MAJOR SURGERY ON THEIR    

398
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,483
CABINET.                        
ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN TROUBLE LIKE

399
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,153
THE EPA CHIEF, SCOTT PRUITT WHO 
APPARENTLY TOOK SOME CHARTER    

400
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,956
TRAVEL AS WELL.                 
KELLYANNE CONWAY WAS ON ONE OF  

401
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,559
THE FLIGHTS WITH PRICE.         
THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE IF THEY  

402
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,296
HAVE TO LANCE THIS BOIL, IT'S   
NOT AS SERIOUS A PROBLEM THAT   

403
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,033
WOULD SPREAD ACROSS THE CABINET 
OR THE ADMINISTRATION.          

404
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:40,437
>> I WANT YOUR TAKE ON TAXES.   
WE HEARD FROM GARY COHN, THE    

405
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,741
WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER    
SAYING BASICALLY THE TAXES ARE  

406
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,344
ABOUT LOWERING THE RATES AND    
GETTING RID OF LOOP HOLES.      

407
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:50,848
SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING A HARD
TIME SELLING THIS TO THE MIDDLE 

408
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:55,319
CLASS.                          
HE'S SAYING YEAH, MIDDLE CLASS, 

409
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,722
YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE $1,000.    
BUT THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME  

410
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,858
MARKETING IT.                   
>> IT'S VERY TRUE.              

411
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:04,795
PEOPLE ARE SUSPICIOUS THAT      
THEY'RE GOING TO GET A TAX CUT  

412
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,297
THAT SOMEONE ELSE ALWAYS GETS   
THE TAX CUT.                    

413
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:10,501
THE ISSUE OF THE STATE AND LOCAL
TAXES BEING DEDUCTIBLE ON THE   

414
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:17,408
FEDERAL RETURN IS A THORNY ONE. 
I NOTICED COHN DESCRIBED THAT AS

415
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,578
A LOOP HOLE.                    
AND UPPER MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE   

416
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:24,214
FROM THE HIGHER INCOME, HIGHER  
TAXING STATES LIKE NEW YORK,    

417
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,584
CONNECTICUT, CALIFORNIA ARE NOT 
GOING TO VIEW THAT DEDUCTION AS 

418
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:31,121
A LOOP HOLE AND WILL PUT UP A   
BIG FIGHT, DEMOCRATS AND        

419
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,258
REPUBLICANS.                    
>> I GOT TO GO HERE, JOSH.      

420
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,894
IS THIS THING COME DOWN TO THE  
WIRE?                           

421
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,064
DOES THIS STAND A CHANCE OF     
PASSING AT ALL?                 

422
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:44,101
>> I THINK IT DOES.             
THE REPUBLICANS NEED A WIN HERE.

423
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,671
IT'S VERY, VERY TOUGH TO PASS   
TAX REFORM LEGISLATION.         

424
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:52,443
NOBODY HAS MADE AN ATTEMPT TO DO
IT IN 30 YEARS AND THERE'S GOOD 

425
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,979
REASON WHY.                     
>> THERE'S GOOD REASON BUT THEY 

426
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:59,283
NEED A VICTORY.                 
JOSH GERSTEIN FROM POLITCO.     

427
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:03,120
THANKS.                         
>> I'M TRACE GALLAGHER IN FOR   

428
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,255
SHEPARD SMITH.                  
"YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL CAVUTO IS

429
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:05,489
NEXT.                           

430
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,150
 The day after chemo might mean 

431
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,885
         a trip back to         
      the doctor's office,      

432
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,053
        just for a shot.        

433
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,056
     But why go back there,     
   when you can stay home...    

434
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,258
    ...with Neulasta Onpro?     

435
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,894
    Strong chemo can put you    
 at risk of serious infection.  

436
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,896
         Neulasta helps         
     reduce infection risk      

437
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,431
        by boosting your        
    white blood cell count,     

438
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,066
       which strengthens        
      your immune system.       

439
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,267
            In a key study,     

440
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,770
   Neulasta reduced the risk    
 of infection from 17% to 1%... 

441
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:28,806
       ...a 94% decrease.       

442
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,074
   Applied the day of chemo,    

443
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,177
 Neulasta Onpro is designed to  
 deliver Neulasta the next day. 

444
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,912
        Neulasta is for         
    certain cancer patients     

445
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,747
 receiving strong chemotherapy. 

446
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:38,315
      Do not take Neulasta      
     if you're allergic to      

447
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,751
      Neulasta or Neupogen      
         (filgrastim).          

448
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:41,819
        Ruptured spleen,        

449
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:44,154
   sometimes fatal as well as   
     serious lung problems,     

450
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,055
      allergic reactions,       

451
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,023
        kidney injuries,        

452
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,925
  and capillary leak syndrome   
         have occurred.         

453
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,727
      Report abdominal or       
       shoulder tip pain,       

454
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:50,794
       trouble breathing        

455
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,596
     or allergic reactions      
   to your doctor right away.   

456
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,264
        In patients with        
     sickle cell disorders,     

457
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,467
       serious, sometimes       
    fatal crises can occur.     

458
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,769
  The most common side effect   
    is bone and muscle ache.    

459
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,404
     So why go back there?      

460
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,039
    If you'd rather be home,    

461
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,408
     ask your doctor about      
        Neulasta Onpro.
