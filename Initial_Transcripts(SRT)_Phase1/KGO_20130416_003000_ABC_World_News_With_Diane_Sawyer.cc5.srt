1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
SMOKE, AND I RAN FAST AS I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
COULD.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
>> Reporter: CAMERAS WERE

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
ROLLING FROM MANY ANGLES AS THE

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
FORCE OF THE BLAST ACTUALLY

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
KNOCKS OVER AT LEAST ONE OF THE

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
MARATHONERS.
LOOK AGAIN.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
MOST OF THE INJURIES, THOUGH,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
SUFFERED BY SPECTATORS WHO CAME

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
TO CELEBRATE THE FINISH.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
>> A BOMB WENT OFF AND IT

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
KNOCKED ME TO THE GROUND.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
STARTED RUNNING.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
PANICKING, AND ANOTHER BOMB WENT
OFF.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
AND THEN I FELT THE GROUND

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
AGAIN, PEOPLE RUNNING, YOU WERE

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
GETTING TRAMPLED.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
>> IT WAS VERY LOUD.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
THE GROUND SHOOK, YOU COULD JUST

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
FEEL IT GOING DOWN THROUGH YOU.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
JUST A SCARY SCENE.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
>> Reporter: RIGHT NEXT TO THE

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
FINISH LINE, BLEACHERS FILLED

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
WITH SPECTATORS, STUNNED AND

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
CONFUSED BY THE FIRST BLAST,

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THEN WATCH IN HORROR AS 50 TO A

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, A SECOND

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
EXPLOSION.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
EYEWITNESSES SAY THE INJURED

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
WERE PILED ON THE SIDEWALK,

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
SEVERED LIMBS LITTERING THE

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
STREET, ONLOOKERS COMFORTING

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
EACH OTHER AS THE VIOLENCE AND

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
CHAOS ENGULFED THEM.

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
>> I SAW QUITE A FEW CASUALTIES,

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
ONE GUY WITH HIS LEGS GONE AT

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
THE KNEES.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
ANKLES AND FEET MISSING,

40
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
SHRAPNEL WOUNDS ON THE SIDE OF

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
THE HEAD.

SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, THERE

WAS NO WARNING, NO ADVANCE

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
THREAT, BUT PARAMEDICS, NATIONAL

THE SCENE FOR THE MARATHON'S

SECURITY AND MEDICAL NEEDS.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
THEY SPED INTO ACTION,

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
PRONOUNCING TWO DEAD ALMOST

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000

BOSTON TO STAY CALM, BUT THE

-- ADMITTING THE STREETS WERE

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
NOT SAFE.
>> WE'RE RECOMMENDING TO PEOPLE

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THAT THEY STAY HOME, THAT IF
THEY'RE IN MOTELS IN THE AREA,

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
THAT THEY RETURN TO THEIR ROOMS,

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
AND THAT THEY DON'T GO ANY PLACE

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
AND CONGREGATE IN LARGE CROWDS.

66
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
WE WANT TO STABILIZE THE

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
SITUATION.

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
>> INITIAL REPORTS OF OTHER

MECHANICAL FIRE.

74
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

75
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THINKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT,

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
KEEP REMEMBER HEARING HOW THEY

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE DANGER,

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
NOT THINKING.
IN SECONDS THEY WERE THERE.

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
WE WANT TO GO TO OUR COLLEAGUE

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
SHAWN KELLEY WHO IS A REPORTER

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
AT OUR GREAT BOSTON AFFILIATE.

82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
WE HEARD THAT HOSPITAL OFFICIALS

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SAID IT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE.

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
WHAT'S THE LATEST YOU'RE HEARING

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
ON THE VICTIMS?

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
>> THE LATEST NUMBER WE'RE

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
GETTING FROM EMERGENCY ROOMS IS

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
80 PEOPLE TAKEN TO AREA
HOSPITALS.

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
IT WAS A TRIAGE CENTER AT THE

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
LOCATION OF THE MARATHON SITE

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THAT WAS SET UP QUICKLY, SO THEY

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WERE ABLE TO TEND TO THESE

93
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
VICTIMS.

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WE SAW PEOPLE BEING WHEELED OUT

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
ON WHEEL CHAIRS AND STRETCHERS

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
WHO HAD LOST THEIR LIMBS.

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
DOCTORS, THE MAJORITY OF

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
INJURIES ARE TO PEOPLE'S LOWER

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
BODIES.

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
>> BUT THERE ARE INJURIES OF

102
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
MANY DIFFERENT KINDS, BURNS AS

103
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WELL.
SHRAPNEL, ALL KINDS OF WOUNDS?

104
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> Reporter: RIGHT.

105
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THE INJURIES WE WERE SEEING WAS
MOSTLY TO PEOPLE'S LEGS.

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I SAW A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
HAVE LOST A GOOD PORTION OF HER

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
JAW.

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
LOTS OF LACERATIONS.

110
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
THE SCENE COMING OUT OF IT WAS

111
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
NOT HYSTERICAL.

112
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
KEEP IN MIND, THIS WAS AT THE

113
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
END OF THE MARATHON.

114
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
SO THE RUNNERS THAT WERE INJURED

115
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WERE EXHAUSTED FROM THE RUN AND

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE SPECTATORS WHO WERE INJURED

117
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WERE SIMPLY IN TOTAL SHOCK.

118
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

119
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU AGAIN

120
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND AGAIN

121
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
OUR THANKS TO WCVB IN BOSTON.

122
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
>>> AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW,

123
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THE BOMB WENT OFF, THE FIRST

124
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ONE, ABOUT 2:50 P.M. ON BOYLSTON

125
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
STREET IN BOSTON, AND THAT WAS

126
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
JUST FEET FROM THE FINISH LINE.

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO

128
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
THE STREETS OF BOSTON AND SHOW

129
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
YOU THE CHAOS, THE CONFUSION,

130
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
LET YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO

131
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
WERE THERE.
>> IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE A

132
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
BOMB -- WHAT I THOUGHT I BOMB

133
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WOULD SOUND LIKE.
ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED.

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
>> IT WAS VERY LOUD.

135
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THE GROUND SHOOK, YOU COULD JUST

136
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
FEEL IT GOING DOWN THROUGH YOU.

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
>> THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF RIGHT

138
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
BY THE FINISH LINE.

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
BOOM, YOU FELT IT, IT HURT YOUR

140
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
EARS.

141
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
>> SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP.

142
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> RUN!

143
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> I SAW A TRASH CAN EXPLODE AND

144
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PEOPLE STARTED THROWING DOWN THE

145
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
BARRICADE AND RUNNING OVER EACH

146
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
OTHER.

147
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I RAN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION

148
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
FAST AS I COULD.

149
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
>> I WAS IN THE CITY.

150
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THIS IS LIKE THE SCARIEST THING

151
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

152
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
PEOPLE WORK IN THE RESTAURANTS

153
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
TELLING US TO GET AWAY FROM THE

154
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SCENE, GET FAR AWAY.

155
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT LIKE IT

156
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WAS AN EXODUS AT CAMBRIDGE.

157
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
>> I SAW RUNNERS IN FRONT OF ME

158
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
FALL, SOME WITH INJURIES, AND

159
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THEN I LOOKED OVER AND SAW JUST

160
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A PILE OF BODIES, THE WORST

161
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THING I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN IN

162
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
MY LIFE.

163
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
MANGLED LIMBS, PEOPLE NOT

164
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BREATHING.

165
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I JUST INTERVIEWED A NURSE HERE

166
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ON THE SCENE WHO SAID SHE

167
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
TREATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE,

168
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
INCLUDING CHILDREN, MANY PEOPLE

169
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WITH SEVERE TRAUMA, PULMONARY

170
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
DISTRESS, YOU NAME IT.

171
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> THEY RESPONDED WITHIN 15

172
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
SECONDS.

173
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
YOU SAW EVERYBODY COMING DOWN

174
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HERE.

175
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THE MEDICAL TEAM HERE RESPONDED

176
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
INSTANTLY.

177
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
>> I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT IN

178
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
BOSTON.

179
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
YOU THINK PATRIOTS' DAY MARATHON

180
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
MONDAY AND YOU DON'T THINK

181
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS EVER GOING

182
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
TO HAPPEN ON A DAY LIKE THIS IN

183
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
BOSTON.

184
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> AND WHEN THOSE BOMBS WENT

185
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OFF, THERE WAS ONE PERSON

186
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
STANDING THERE, AN EMERGENCY

187
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
ROOM DOCTOR, WHO WAS JUST 20

188
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
FEET AWAY FROM ONE OF THE

189
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
EXPLOSIONS.

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THIS DOCTOR SPRANG INTO ACTION

191
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000

192
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
DR. ALAN PAINTER JOINS US RIGHT

193
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
NOW ON THE PHONE FROM BOSTON.

194
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
DR. PAINTER, TELL US ABOUT THE

195
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
SCENE AND AS A MEDICAL

196
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
PROFESSIONAL, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
WHAT DID YOU DO?

198
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
>> BASICALLY THE EXPLOSION

199
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OCCURRED TO MY LEFT.

200
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I REALIZED IT WAS AN EXPLOSION,

201
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
TURNED TO MY RIGHT TO LEAVE THE

202
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
AREA.

203
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
ANOTHER EXPLOSION WENT OFF

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
APPARENTLY DOWN THE BLOCK.

205
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TURNED ME BACK AROUND FACING THE

206
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
BUILDINGS.

207
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THEN I REALIZED THERE WERE

208
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
PEOPLE BLEEDING BEHIND ME.

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
THEN I LOOKED TO MY LEFT WHERE I

210
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
HAD BEEN AND THERE WERE AT LEAST

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SIX BODIES DOWN THERE.

212
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
APPARENTLY THEY HAD TAKEN ALL

213
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THE BLAST AND I WAS UNSCATHED.

214
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> AND WERE YOU ABLE TO HELP

215
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PEOPLE?

216
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
DID YOU GATHER PEOPLE IN YOUR

217
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
ARMS?

218
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE

219
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
PUT TOURNIQUETS ON PEOPLE QUICK
AS WE CAN.

220
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BECAUSE MOST OF THE INJURIES

221
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
WERE TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

222
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
WE ATTEMPTED RESUSCITATION OF A

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
YOUNG LADY, GOT HER BACK TO THE

224
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
MEDICAL TENT, BUT SHE DID NOT
MAKE IT.

225
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I WANT TO COMMEND BOSTON POLICE

226
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000

00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
FRANTICALLY GETTING THINGS THAT

228
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
EVERYBODY NEEDED TO THE AREA.

229
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AND THE BOSTON ATHLETIC

230
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
ASSOCIATION HAD SO MANY PEOPLE

231
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THERE TO HELP, IT WAS FANTASTIC.

232
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, DR. PAINTER, A

233
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000

234
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000

HERE IN NEW YORK, CRITICAL

242
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT

PIERRE THOMAS.

260
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
>> WHAT WE'RE BEING TOLD BY

261
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SOURCES IS, THEY BELIEVE THAT

262
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
TWO PORTABLE DEVICES WERE LEFT

263
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
AND PLACED AT THE SCENE AND THEN

264
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
DETONATED.

265
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS RIGHT

266
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
NOW ARE AT THE SCENE, THEY'RE

267
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
LOOKING FOR PIECES OF THE DEVICE

268
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
IN ORDER TO BEGIN TO PUT THEM

269
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
BACK TOGETHER TO GET A SENSE OF

270
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

271
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR

272
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SURVEILLANCE TAPE.

273
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
ANY SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT WOULD

274
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
GIVE THEM AN IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
DONE THIS.

275
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
ALSO WE'RE TOLD IN ADDITION TO

276
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
LOOKING AT POTENTIAL DOMESTIC

277
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
SUSPECTS, THEY'RE LOOKING AT

278
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE THE

279
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
BOSTON AREA AIRPORT.

280
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
EVERYTHING IS BEING LOOKED AT.

281
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF

282
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT
NOW.

283
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
>> PIERRE, I WANT TO GO TO THE

284
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
VIDEO OF THE EXPLOSION.

285
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WE'RE GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN.

286
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
LOOK AGAIN AT THIS VIDEO.

287
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
TELL ME, FORENSICALLY, WHAT

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
INVESTIGATORS THINK THEY CAN

289
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
DETERMINE FROM WHAT WE'RE

290
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SEEING.

291
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
>> I SPOKE WITH SOURCES WHO WERE

292
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
WATCHING AND WITNESSES THAT

293
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
PARTICULAR VIDEOTAPE.

294
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
THEY SAY IT CONFIRMS WHAT THEY

295
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THINK.

296
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, IT SEEMS TO

297
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
COME FROM A FAIRLY CONFINED

298
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
SMALL AREA.

299
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
AGAIN, THAT WAS ONE OF THE

300
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
REASONS WHY THEY THOUGHT THIS

301
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
WAS SOME SORT OF PACKAGE LEFT

302
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BEHIND IN THE MIDST OF THAT

303
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
CROWD TO HARM EVERYONE IN THE

304
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY.

305
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> AND AGAIN, PERSONS OF

306
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
INTEREST TONIGHT, ANY LEADS AT

307
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
ALL?

308
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
>> AGAIN, ALL OF THE ABOVE, AS

309
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ONE SOURCE TOLD ME, THEY WILL

310
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
LOOK AT DOMESTIC GROUPS,

311
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
INTERNATIONAL GROUPS UNTIL THEY

312
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
GET A SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT

313
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
POINTS THEM IN ONE DIRECTION,

314
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.

315
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
>> AGAIN, SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE

316
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ASKING THAT EVERYONE WHO HAD ANY

317
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
VIDEO AT ALL, SEND IT TO THEM

318
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AND SEND THEM ANY LEADS.

319
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
PIERRE THOMAS WILL KEEP WORKING

320
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, I KNOW.

321
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
AND RIGHT AFTER THE EXPLOSION,

322
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN FRONT OF

323
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SHUT DOWN.

324
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SHORTLY BEFORE WE CAME ON THE

325
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
AIR, THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE

326
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000

327
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
HERE'S ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL.

329
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
>> THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO THE

330
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
BOMBING AS THE EVENT IN BOSTON,

331
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE WHITE

332
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HOUSE IS TREATING THIS AS A

333
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
TERRORIST ATTACK.

334
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME INTO THE

335
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000

RESPONSIBLE.

339
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
>> WE STILL DO NOT KNOW WHO DID

340
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THIS OR WHY.

341
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AND PEOPLE SHOULDN'T JUMP TO

342
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
CONCLUSIONS BEFORE WE HAVE ALL

343
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THE FACTS.

344
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE WILL GET

345
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, AND WE

346
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
WILL FIND OUT WHO DID THIS,

347
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY THEY DID

348
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THIS.

349
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
ANY RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS, ANY

350
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
RESPONSIBLE GROUPS WILL FEEL THE

351
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
FULL WEIGHT OF JUSTICE.

352
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S

353
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
DIRECTED THE FULL RESOURCES OF

354
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP

355
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
NOT ONLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION

356
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
IN BOSTON AND THE RECOVERY IN

357
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
BOSTON, BUT ALSO TO SECURE OTHER

358
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES AS

359
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
NECESSARY.

360
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS INFORMED OF

361
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THIS JUST MINUTES AFTER IT

362
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
HAPPENED AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN

363
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000

NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

365
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
WE HAVE A PHOTO OF THE CALL HE

366
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
HAD WITH FBI DIRECTOR MULLER IN

367
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
THE EARTH SHOOK.

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000

LIKE OF LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE.

443
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THEN I SMELLED A LOT OF SMOKE.

444
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
