[000:00:01;868] THAT WE WILL BUILD A ECONOMY
[000:00:03;403] THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.
[000:00:04;871] WE'RE ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE
[000:00:08;108] UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DROPPED
[000:00:10;343] AND WORK FORCE IS AT A 3 1/2
[000:00:12;345] YEAR HIGH.
[000:00:13;113] THIS UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR
[000:00:14;381] CONGRESS TO WORK WITH US TO GROW
[000:00:16;282] THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS.
[000:00:17;751] THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING TAX
[000:00:19;953] RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND
[000:00:22;355] BUSINESS CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.
[000:00:23;890] WE HAVE A ONCE IN A GENERATION
[000:00:25;792] OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A TAX CODE
[000:00:27;460] THAT IS SIMPLE, FAIR AND EASY TO
[000:00:30;296] UNDERSTAND.
[000:00:30;697] THAT MEANS GETTING RID OF THE
[000:00:35;769] LOOP HOLES THAT BENEFIT THE
[000:00:38;605] WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND
[000:00:41;007] LOWERING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE
[000:00:43;009] AMERICANS AND BUY THE GREAT
[000:00:44;744] PRODUCTS MADE BY AMERICAN
[000:00:47;447] MANUFACTURERS.
[000:00:47;881] TODAY THE PRESIDENT SIGNED A
[000:00:50;550] PROCLAMATION DECLARING OCTOBER 6
[000:00:51;885] NATIONAL MANUFACTURING DAY.
[000:00:52;819] THIS HONORS THE MEN AND WOMEN
[000:00:54;254] THAT CREATE THE PRODUCTS THAT
[000:00:55;789] POWER OUR COMMUNITIES, IMPROVE
[000:00:58;391] OUR LIVES AND DEFEND OUR NATION.
[000:01:00;126] THE PEOPLE WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT
[000:01:01;961] SAYS BELIEVE IN THOSE BEAUTIFUL
[000:01:02;829] WORDS "MADE IN THE U.S.A."
[000:01:04;697] IN ADDITION TO THE 14 WORKERS
[000:01:06;833] THE PRESIDENT HOSTED IN THE OVAL
[000:01:08;034] OFFICE DURING TODAY'S
[000:01:10;003] PROCLAMATION SIGNING, MORE THAN
[000:01:12;372] 500,000 PEOPLE AROUND THE
[000:01:13;673] COUNTRY ARE PARTICIPATING IN
[000:01:15;241] THOUSANDS OF EVENTS RELATED TO
[000:01:17;210] MANUFACTURING DAY.
[000:01:18;011] AMONG THEM, NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF
[000:01:21;147] THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET AND
[000:01:25;819] OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS.
[000:01:26;453] OUR TAX PLAN WOULD LEAD TO A
[000:01:28;354] GREAT MANUFACTURING BOON.
[000:01:29;656] WE WOULD CUT TAXES ON BUSINESSES
[000:01:32;058] OF ALL SIZES AND RESTORE THEIR
[000:01:34;727] COMPETITIVE EDGE TO CREATE MORE
[000:01:35;829] JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES FOR OUR
[000:01:40;467] WORKERS.
[000:01:40;800] OUR PLAN WOULD ALLOW THEM TO
[000:01:42;535] BRING BACK TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
[000:01:44;304] OVERSEAS.
[000:01:44;671] THE PRESIDENT WILL BE BACK OUT
[000:01:45;505] ON THE ROAD BUILDING SUPPORT FOR
[000:01:46;906] THIS PLAN, WHICH IS REALLY A
[000:01:48;274] JOBS BILL.
[000:01:48;842] HE WILL BE IN PENNSYLVANIA
[000:01:49;876] MONDAY AND WE'LL HAVE MORE
[000:01:51;811] DETAILS COMING SOON.
[000:01:53;813] WITH THAT, WE'LL KICKOFF FRIDAY
[000:01:59;752] WITH QUESTIONS.
[000:02:00;820] WE'LL START NOW IS.
[000:02:02;388] KIND OF FUN.
[000:02:03;556] WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN AND
[000:02:04;924] NOT JUST SAVE IT FOR FRIDAYS.
[000:02:06;926] JOHN DECKER.
[000:02:07;594] >> THANK YOU, SARAH.
[000:02:09;262] THE BODY OF ANOTHER U.S. SOLDIER
[000:02:12;198] HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED BY
[000:02:14;501] LOCAL FORCES IN NIGER WHICH
[000:02:17;637] BRINGS TO FOUR THE TOTAL NUMBER
[000:02:21;074] OF GREEN BERETS THAT WERE KILLED
[000:02:23;209] WEDNESDAY IN NIGER.
[000:02:25;812] SO FAR THERE'S NO RESPONSE TO
[000:02:27;514] THIS BY THE PRESIDENT, NO TWEET
[000:02:29;215] FROM THE PRESIDENT, NO STATEMENT
[000:02:32;118] FROM THE PRESIDENT.
[000:02:34;254] CAN WE EXPECT SOME SORT OF
[000:02:36;322] REPRISAL BY THE U.S. MILITARY IN
[000:02:38;358] NIGER AS RELATES TO WHAT
[000:02:40;793] HAPPENED WEDNESDAY?
[000:02:41;361] >> I MADE A STATEMENT ON BEHALF
[000:02:43;663] OF THE ADMINISTRATION YESTERDAY
[000:02:45;598] IN THE OPENING.
[000:02:48;001] OBVIOUSLY ANY TIME ONE OF THE
[000:02:49;469] MEMBERS OF OUR GREAT MILITARY
[000:02:52;605] ARE INJURED, WOUNDED OR KILLED
[000:02:55;975] IN ACTION, THAT IT'S CERTAINLY
[000:02:58;178] SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY
[000:03:02;882] SERIOUSLY.
[000:03:03;249] OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE
[000:03:04;784] WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS.
[000:03:05;652] WE'RE CONTINUING TO REVIEW AND
[000:03:06;719] LOOK INTO THIS.
[000:03:07;954] AS WE HAVE MORE DETAILS, WE'LL
[000:03:09;956] LET YOU KNOW.
[000:03:11;224] CECILIA?
[000:03:11;591] >> CAN YOU CLARIFY THE
[000:03:12;625] PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS?
[000:03:13;526] WAS HE REFERRING TO MILITARY
[000:03:15;461] ACTION WHEN HE SAID "CALM BEFORE
[000:03:17;363] THE STORM?"
[000:03:18;131] >> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,
[000:03:20;200] THE PRESIDENT HAS AS I HAVE FROM
[000:03:21;501] THIS PODIUM ON QUITE A FEW
[000:03:24;270] OCCASIONS, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO
[000:03:25;638] SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT THE
[000:03:27;707] PRESIDENT WILL DO.
[000:03:28;641] AS HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN
[000:03:30;310] ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS, YOU'LL
[000:03:31;978] HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
[000:03:33;846] >> HOW SERIOUSLY SHOULD AMERICAN
[000:03:35;949] ADVERSARIES FOR THAT MATTER TAKE
[000:03:38;785] THESE COMMENTS?
[000:03:39;719] >> I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE
[000:03:42;522] PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE
[000:03:43;556] AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY
[000:03:45;525] SERIOUS.
[000:03:46;092] HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S
[000:03:47;393] HIS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY.
[000:03:49;429] IF HE FEELS THAT ACTION IS
[000:03:50;897] NECESSARY, HE WILL TAKE IT.
[000:03:52;532] STEVE?
[000:03:52;999] >> WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
[000:03:54;100] WANTS HIS MILITARY LEADERS TO
[000:03:55;868] GIVE THEM MILITARY OPTIONS
[000:03:58;104] FASTER, DOES HE FEELS LIKE
[000:03:59;138] THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY
[000:04:00;940] SLOW-WALKING THESE OPTIONS TO
[000:04:02;575] HIM?
[000:04:02;909] >> NO, NOT AT ALL.
[000:04:04;344] AS YOU KNOW, HE'S A PERSON THAT
[000:04:06;179] LIKES TO TAKE ACTION AND TAKE IT
[000:04:08;715] QUICKLY.
[000:04:09;616] I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD READ
[000:04:11;818] INTO ANYTHING BEYOND THAT.
[000:04:13;453] HE WANTS OPTIONS ON THE TABLE SO
[000:04:15;822] HE CAN MAKE QUICK DECISIONS.
[000:04:17;490] >> IS THAT A GENERAL COMMENT OR
[000:04:20;159] DID HE MEAN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY?
[000:04:22;061] >> A GENERAL COMMENT.
[000:04:24;330] NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT WAS IN
[000:04:26;132] REFERENCE TO.
[000:04:26;766] >> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.
[000:04:29;235] ONE ON THE SOLDIER THAT WAS
[000:04:30;503] KILLED IN NIGER AND THE OTHER ON
[000:04:33;239] DACA.
[000:04:33;539] WHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT MADE
[000:04:34;907] AWARE THERE WAS A FOURTH SOLDIER
[000:04:36;542] MISSING IN ACTION?
[000:04:37;377] WHEN DID HE BECOME AWARE THAT
[000:04:39;445] THAT SOLDIER HAD BEEN KILLED AND
[000:04:41;648] DISCOVERED BY LOCAL FORCES?
[000:04:42;882] >> I BELIEVE THE NOTIFICATION
[000:04:44;183] WAS YESTERDAY.
[000:04:44;717] I'D HAVE TO GET CLARIFICATION ON
[000:04:46;486] THE SPECIFIC TIMING OF WHEN THAT
[000:04:48;288] TOOK PLACE.
[000:04:48;721] >> WHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT MADE
[000:04:50;056] AWARE THAT THAT SOLDIER'S BODY
[000:04:52;292] WAS FOUND?
[000:04:53;393] AGAIN, I KNOW THAT IT WAS PRETTY
[000:04:56;562] SOON AFTER THAT HAD BEEN
[000:05:00;099] DISCOVERED.
[000:05:00;500] AS FAR AS AN EXACT TIME, I CAN'T
[000:05:02;502] GIVE YOU THAT.
[000:05:03;569] I KNOW CHIEF KELLY KEPT HIM
[000:05:05;738] UPDATED ON THAT SITUATION AS IT
[000:05:07;874] EVOLVED.
[000:05:08;207] >> AND ON DACA, THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:10;410] WELCOMED HISPANIC AMERICAN
[000:05:11;511] LEADERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:05:13;379] HE DID NOT MENTION HIS POSITION
[000:05:15;114] TO END DACA DURING HIS REMARKS
[000:05:17;950] THERE.
[000:05:18;584] HE DID NOT RENEW HIS CALL FOR
[000:05:20;353] CONGRESS TO PROTECT THOSE THAT
[000:05:22;622] WILL BE VULNERABLE FOR
[000:05:24;223] DEPORTATION IN MARCH.
[000:05:25;091] WHY DID HE NOT BRING THAT UP?
[000:05:26;759] >> LOOK, HE'S BEEN CLEAR.
[000:05:29;762] THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE TO
[000:05:31;130] REITERATE THE SAME POSITION THAT
[000:05:32;932] HE'S HELD.
[000:05:33;466] HE CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ACT ON
[000:05:34;967] IT.
[000:05:35;234] YOU CAN EXPECT IN THE COMING
[000:05:37;537] DAYS THAT HE WILL LAY OUT HIS
[000:05:40;306] RESPONSIBLE IMMIGRATION REFORM.
[000:05:41;674] YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT TO HAPPEN
[000:05:48;081] VERY SOON.
[000:05:48;481] THAT'S ALL PART OF THE PROCESS
[000:05:49;215] MOVING FORWARD.
[000:05:49;716] HE HASN'T BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT
[000:05:50;483] WHAT HIS POSITION IS ON THAT
[000:05:52;618] FRONT.
[000:05:53;186] APRIL?
[000:05:53;486] >> SARAH, GOING BACK TO THE CALM
[000:05:58;591] BEFORE THE STORM, WHEN THE
[000:06:00;493] PRESIDENT DEALS WITH WORLD
[000:06:01;728] MATTERS LIKE THIS, ALL OPTIONS
[000:06:03;730] ARE ON THE TABLE.
[000:06:05;365] HAS THIS WHITE HOUSE EXHAUSTED
[000:06:10;670] DIPLOMACY?
[000:06:11;037] FOR HIM TO SAY THE CALM BEFORE
[000:06:12;438] THE STORM, LISTENING TO WHAT HE
[000:06:14;040] HAD TO SAY.
[000:06:15;074] >> WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUT
[000:06:16;309] MAXIMUM ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC
[000:06:18;177] PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH
[000:06:19;779] KOREA.
[000:06:20;079] WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
[000:06:21;748] THAT.
[000:06:22;382] AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:23;383] WILL KEEP ALL OF HIS OPTIONS ON
[000:06:25;151] THE TABLE.
[000:06:25;651] OUR POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED.
[000:06:28;287] IT'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT.
[000:06:29;455] >> IS NORTH KOREA THE STORM?
[000:06:30;723] >> THAT'S AN EXAMPLE.
[000:06:31;591] WE HAVE A LOT OF BAD ACTORS.
[000:06:34;427] NORTH KOREA, IRAN.
[000:06:38;297] SEVERAL EXAMPLE THERE'S.
[000:06:40;400] >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE
[000:06:42;468] CONTRACEPTION WAIVER.
[000:06:43;136] THE ACLU ANNOUNCED A LAWSUIT.
[000:06:49;509] THEY SAID THE TRUMP
[000:06:50;410] ADMINISTRATION IS PAYING FOR
[000:06:51;277] WOMEN TO PAY FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS
[000:06:54;814] BELIEFS.
[000:06:55;381] THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT
[000:06:57;984] AUTHORIZE DISCRIMINATION IN THE
[000:07:01;154] NAME OF RELIGION OR OTHERWISE.
[000:07:03;756] WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE?
[000:07:05;992] >> I WOULD NEVER GET THE ACLU TO
[000:07:08;461] TAKE ANY OF MY TALKING POINTS.
[000:07:11;597] THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THE
[000:07:12;799] REASON TO PRACTICE ONE'S FAITH
[000:07:14;066] IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS
[000:07:16;936] COUNTRY.
[000:07:17;270] THAT'S ALL TODAY WAS ABOUT.
[000:07:19;105] OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD
[000:07:20;506] PROTECT THAT RIGHT.
[000:07:21;274] AS LONG AS DONALD TRUMP IS
[000:07:22;975] PRESIDENT, HE WILL.
[000:07:24;010] >> FOR THE ACLU, WHAT WOULD YOU
[000:07:26;979] SAY TO THE WOMEN OUT THERE OR
[000:07:28;281] THE FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT NOW
[000:07:29;749] HAVE TO PAY MORE OUT OF THEIR
[000:07:31;884] POCKET TO GET CONTRACEPTION
[000:07:34;220] COVERAGE THAT THEY CHOOSE AND
[000:07:35;855] THAT THEY DESIRE?
[000:07:37;256] >> THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT
[000:07:39;292] SUPPORTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT,
[000:07:40;960] SUPPORTS THE FREEDOM OF
[000:07:42;361] RELIGION.
[000:07:42;728] I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT
[000:07:43;496] SHOULD BE AN ISSUE.
[000:07:46;265] THE SUPREME COURT HAS VALIDATED
[000:07:49;135] THIS DECISION ON MANY TIMES
[000:07:51;804] OVER.
[000:07:52;104] THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEBODY THAT
[000:07:54;340] BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION.
[000:07:55;541] IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHAT THE
[000:07:58;177] CONSTITUTION SAYS, TALK TO
[000:08:00;680] CONGRESS ABOUT CHANGING IT.
[000:08:03;649] >> GIVEN THE LAWSUITS THAT THE
[000:08:07;920] ACLU HAS FIRED, IS THE
[000:08:09;088] ADMINISTRATION PREPARED TO
[000:08:10;790] DEFENSE THIS CONTRACEPTION
[000:08:12;225] MANDATE BACK TO THE SUPREME
[000:08:13;125] COURT IF NEED BE?
[000:08:14;293] >> THE SUPREME COURT MADE CLEAR
[000:08:15;328] WHAT THE POSITION IS.
[000:08:16;729] IT SUPPORT WHAT'S THIS
[000:08:18;397] ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE.
[000:08:19;065] >> BUT THIS WILL BE A LEGAL
[000:08:20;500] FIGHT --
[000:08:21;067] >> IF IT DOES, IT SHOWS THAT
[000:08:23;035] THIS STRAIGHT IS ON THE RIGHT
[000:08:24;470] SIDE OF THE LAW.
[000:08:25;505] >> AND ON THE CALM BEFORE THE
[000:08:26;539] STORM ISSUE.
[000:08:27;473] THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
[000:08:29;075] PRESERVE --
[000:08:29;609] >> AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ASK THE
[000:08:31;911] SAME QUESTION.
[000:08:32;378] >> IT'S A FOLLOW UP.
[000:08:33;946] YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
[000:08:35;248] PRESERVE AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
[000:08:36;716] IF HE WANTS TO PRESERVE AN
[000:08:38;751] ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, WHY WOULD
[000:08:40;419] HE DANGLE HINTS ABOUT HIS
[000:08:41;921] ACTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[000:08:44;323] >> I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID.
[000:08:47;293] HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY
[000:08:48;761] SPECIFIC ACTIONS AT ALL.
[000:08:50;329] MATTHEW?
[000:08:50;663] >> TWO QUESTIONS.
[000:08:51;197] FIRST FOLLOWING UP ON THE HHS
[000:08:53;766] CHANGE.
[000:08:54;100] DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE ANY
[000:08:56;435] ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE
[000:08:57;637] COULD LOSE ACCESS TO BIRTH
[000:08:58;671] CONTROL UNDER THIS CHANGE?
[000:08:59;639] >> I'M NOT AWARE.
[000:09:00;706] I'D REFER YOU TO HHS FOR
[000:09:03;175] SPECIFI
[000:09:05;378] SPECIFICS.
[000:09:05;745] >> THE PRESIDENT REPEATED
[000:09:06;412] EARLIER TODAY THAT THE U.S. IS
[000:09:08;447] THE HIGHEST TAX NATION IN THE
[000:09:09;849] WORLD.
[000:09:10;149] IT'S NOT TRUE.
[000:09:10;816] SO WHY DOES HE KEEP MAKING THAT
[000:09:13;085] STATEMENT?
[000:09:13;452] WHY DOES HE STICK TO THAT
[000:09:15;054] TALKING POINT?
[000:09:15;721] >> THERE ARE SPECIFIC SECTORS IN
[000:09:17;223] THE COUNTRY THAT ARE AMONG THE
[000:09:18;858] HIGHEST TAXED IN THE WORLD AND
[000:09:21;093] WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT
[000:09:24;964] DATA.
[000:09:25;264] JOHN?
[000:09:27;300] >> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS, SARAH.
[000:09:33;439] THERE'S RUMORS THAT PRIME
[000:09:34;774] MINISTER SABRIS WILL COME HERE
[000:09:36;776] ON THE 17th, MEET WITH THE
[000:09:38;678] PRESIDENT AND THEN MEET WITH THE
[000:09:40;046] VICE PRESIDENT ON THE 18th.
[000:09:41;280] WE'VE HAD NO CONFIRMATION.
[000:09:42;782] IS THE PRIME MINISTER INVITED
[000:09:44;350] AND IS HE COMING TO MEET THE
[000:09:46;552] PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT?
[000:09:47;420] >> HE IS.
[000:09:48;220] I BELIEVE THAT DATE IS CORRECT.
[000:09:49;855] THE 17th, I BELIEVE, THAT HE
[000:09:51;557] WILL BE HERE.
[000:09:52;224] >> THE OTHER THING, THE
[000:09:58;397] ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD A VACANCY
[000:09:59;198] WITHOUT A PERMANENT SECRETARY OF
[000:10:02;301] HOMELAND SECURITY FOR TWO
[000:10:03;569] MONTHS, WHICH IS A RECORD FOR
[000:10:05;504] THAT POSITION NOT OPERATING WITH
[000:10:07;607] A PERMANENT SECRETARY.
[000:10:09;442] ARE WE GOING TO HAVE AN
[000:10:12;144] ANNOUNCEMENT ON A CHOICE FOR
[000:10:14;647] PERMANENT SECRETARY WITHIN DAYS
[000:10:16;816] NEXT WEEK PERHAPS?
[000:10:17;783] AND RUMORS ARE CONSISTENT, HE
[000:10:19;952] WILL MAKE ELAINE DUKE THE
[000:10:23;222] PERMANENT SECRETARY.
[000:10:24;190] TRUE OR FALSE?
[000:10:24;824] >> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
[000:10:26;492] ANY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE
[000:10:28;127] PRESIDENT MAY MAKE ABOUT A
[000:10:29;395] PERMANENT PERSON.
[000:10:31;364] I WILL SAY ACTING SECRETARY DUKE
[000:10:36;769] IS VERY COMPETENT, HAS MANAGED
[000:10:39;171] THE DEPARTMENT WELL IN A TOUGH
[000:10:41;407] AND TRYING TIME GIVEN THE
[000:10:43;809] HURRICANE SEASON WE'VE HAD AND
[000:10:45;177] CERTAINLY HAVE NOT WANTED TO
[000:10:46;078] MAKE BIG SHIFTS IN LEADERSHIP
[000:10:48;681] DURING THIS TIME.
[000:10:49;348] WHILE THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON
[000:10:50;783] THERE, IN TERMS OF A TIMETABLE,
[000:10:52;518] WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED WHEN WE
[000:10:55;421] HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
[000:10:56;689] >> THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID
[000:10:59;492] ABOUT SECRETARY DUKE, THE
[000:11:00;626] TESTIMONY YOU GAVE AS THE
[000:11:01;794] PRESIDENT'S OPINION OF HER AS
[000:11:02;762] WELL.
[000:11:03;062] >> YES.
[000:11:03;729] HE'S HAPPY WITH THE JOB THAT
[000:11:06;265] SHE'S DONE AS THE ACTING
[000:11:08;167] SECRETARY.
[000:11:08;534] >> SENATOR CORNYN SAID THE
[000:11:14;407] IMMIGRATION PRINCIPLES WOULD BE
[000:11:17;309] HARMFUL TO DACA.
[000:11:18;444] DACA SHOULD BE KEPT SEPARATE
[000:11:19;412] ABOUT ANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
[000:11:21;013] WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE'S
[000:11:22;348] RESPONSE TO THAT?
[000:11:23;015] ARE YOU GUYS COMMITTED TO
[000:11:25;451] ATTACHING LEGAL IMMIGRATION TO
[000:11:27;853] THE DACA DEBATE?
[000:11:29;188] >> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER
[000:11:31;190] WE PUT FORWARD IS A RESPONSIBLE
[000:11:32;825] IMMIGRATION REFORM AND NOT ONE
[000:11:34;260] PIECE OF THIS PROCESS DEALT WITH
[000:11:36;228] SEPARATELY.
[000:11:36;629] WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE
[000:11:38;364] ADDRESSING ALL THE PROBLEMS SO
[000:11:39;465] WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THIS
[000:11:40;666] AGAIN IN TWO, FOUR, FIVE, SIX
[000:11:43;035] YEARS BUT PUTTING FORWARD A VERY
[000:11:46;172] THOROUGH AND FULL PLAN.
[000:11:47;673] THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE COMING
[000:11:49;141] FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IN VERY
[000:11:50;876] SHORT ORDER.
[000:11:51;711] FRED?
[000:11:52;011] >> THANK YOU, SARAH.
[000:11:54;947] TWO WEEKS.
[000:11:56;449] FIRST, THERE'S A VIEW ON PAYDAY
[000:12:02;621] LENDING.
[000:12:03;155] >> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.
[000:12:05;858] >> JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT
[000:12:08;994] TOPIC.
[000:12:09;695] THERE'S BEEN SOME HOUSE
[000:12:11;530] REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE THAT
[000:12:13;466] THERE'S ALREADY CAUSE FOR FIRING
[000:12:15;901] RICHARD.
[000:12:16;368] GOING BACK TO HIS HANDLING OF
[000:12:19;538] THE WELLS FARGO CASE.
[000:12:21;607] WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT -- HAS
[000:12:23;309] HE APPROVED OF THE JOB HE'S DONE
[000:12:25;478] SO FAR?
[000:12:26;078] >> WHEN WE HAVE PERSONNEL
[000:12:28;147] ANNOUNCEMENTS, WE'LL KEEP YOU
[000:12:29;749] POSTED.
[000:12:30;082] THAT'S TWO ALREADY.
[000:12:30;649] I'M MOVING ON.
[000:12:33;419] MARGARET?
[000:12:33;786] >> TWO QUICK QUESTIONS.
[000:12:34;620] THERE'S BEEN SOME RUMORS ABOUT
[000:12:37;656] THE FUTURE OF SECRETARY REX
[000:12:39;158] TILLERSON TODAY.
[000:12:39;692] CAN YOU CONTINUE TO SAY THE
[000:12:41;026] PRESIDENT REMAINS CONFIDENT IN
[000:12:42;461] HIM AS SECRETARY OF STATE?
[000:12:43;562] >> HE DOES.
[000:12:44;897] AS HE SAID YESTERDAY OR TWO DAYS
[000:12:47;333] AGO AS I SAID YESTERDAY, NOTHING
[000:12:49;268] HAS CHANGED DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY
[000:12:51;170] READ IN THE MEDIA OR WATCH ON
[000:12:53;606] TV.
[000:12:54;173] I WOULD CERTAINLY TRUST THE
[000:12:56;675] PRESIDENT IN MY COMMENTS FAR
[000:12:58;177] ABOVE THOSE OF OTHER REPORTERS.
[000:13:00;045] >> I WANT TO ASK YOU, THE
[000:13:03;449] PRESIDENT CAN MOVE MARKETS,
[000:13:09;688] CAUSE MISCALCULATIONS.
[000:13:17;029] YOU MENTIONED NORTH KOREA, IRAN
[000:13:19;832] WITH CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
[000:13:21;534] AN IMPLICATION THAT THERE'S SOME
[000:13:24;637] SORT OF FORECASTING OF A
[000:13:26;739] MILITARY ACTION.
[000:13:27;439] CAN YOU CLARIFY IF WE'RE
[000:13:29;041] INTERPRETING THINGS CORRECTLY?
[000:13:30;509] >> I HAVEN'T BEEN SPECIFIC ABOUT
[000:13:32;411] ANYTHING.
[000:13:32;778] I'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT
[000:13:34;113] THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUT
[000:13:35;548] MAXIMUM ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC
[000:13:37;116] PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH
[000:13:39;418] KOREA.
[000:13:39;718] I'M SAYING THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE
[000:13:42;154] ON THE TABLE AS THEY HAVE BEEN
[000:13:43;689] AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANNOUNCE
[000:13:45;257] WHAT ACTIONS WE'LL BE TAKING
[000:13:46;992] UNTIL THAT MOMENT COMES.
[000:13:48;027] >> WHY DID HE SAY THAT?
[000:13:49;628] >> CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC
[000:13:52;498] ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING OPEN
[000:13:54;333] TO LEGISLATION BANNING BUMP
[000:13:55;868] STOCKS?
[000:13:56;202] >> AS I SAID YESTERDAY, WE WANT
[000:13:57;636] TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.
[000:13:59;338] WE WANT MORE INFORMATION.
[000:14:00;339] WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
[000:14:02;007] THAT OVER THE COMING DAYS.
[000:14:04;276] THAT'S THE CURRENT POSITION.
[000:14:06;579] HASN'T CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY.
[000:14:07;413] >> THANK YOU, SARAH.
[000:14:09;181] TWO QUESTIONS IF I CAN.
[000:14:10;382] >> WHY NOT?
[000:14:11;450] >> I ASKED YOU ABOUT SENATOR
[000:14:14;386] CORKER.
[000:14:14;720] >> JUST NOT THREE.
[000:14:15;487] >> JUST TWO.
[000:14:16;288] I ASKED YOU ABOUT SENATOR CORKER
[000:14:18;057] AND THE COMMENTS HE MADE A FEW
[000:14:19;959] WEEKS BACK.
[000:14:21;794] EARLIER THIS WEEK HE SAID THAT
[000:14:23;028] SECRETARY TILLERSON, MATTIS AND
[000:14:24;797] KELLY ARE BASICALLY WHAT IS
[000:14:27;266] KEEPING THE COUNTRY SEPARATED
[000:14:28;200] FROM CHAOS AND HE SAID THERE'S
[000:14:30;469] OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:14:32;605] THAT AREN'T PUTTING FORTH
[000:14:35;140] POLICIES IN A COHERENT FASHION.
[000:14:38;310] DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE?
[000:14:39;178] >> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS THE
[000:14:40;946] ONE THAT IS KEEPING THE WORLD
[000:14:42;915] FROM CHAOS.
[000:14:43;983] HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE TEAM AROUND
[000:14:46;518] HIM HELPING LEAD THAT EFFORT.
[000:14:47;920] HE'S HAD TREMENDOUS
[000:14:51;523] ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE
[000:14:52;658] INTERNATIONAL STAGE BY WORKING
[000:14:53;993] WITH ALLIES AND CONFRONTING
[000:14:55;694] ENEMIES.
[000:14:56;028] WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
[000:14:57;263] THAT WITH THE TEAM AS THE
[000:15:00;032] PRESIDENT LEADING THAT EFFORT.
[000:15:02;334] >> IS GENERAL KELLY --
[000:15:05;404] >> I'M COME BACK.
[000:15:07;606] >> GETTING BACK TO THE CALM
[000:15:10;142] BEFORE THE STORM COMMENTS.
[000:15:11;210] THERE'S A THEORY IN WASHINGTON
[000:15:13;312] AND FORGIVE ME IF YOU'VE BEEN
[000:15:14;246] ASKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, THAT THE
[000:15:17;650] PRESIDENT SUBSCRIBES TO THIS MAD
[000:15:19;218] MAN THEORY, THAT IF HE MAKES A
[000:15:21;820] LOT OF UNSETTLING OFF-PUTTING
[000:15:24;056] COMMENTS THAT SORT OF THROW
[000:15:25;157] PEOPLE OFF, THAT HE LIKES TO
[000:15:27;593] KEEP HIS ADVERSARIES GUESSING.
[000:15:30;229] THAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING
[000:15:31;830] COMMENTS LIKE CALM BEFORE THE
[000:15:33;265] STORM AND SO FORTH.
[000:15:34;300] WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF THAT?
[000:15:37;469] IS THERE ANYTHING TO THAT?
[000:15:38;170] >> I THINK THE PRESIDENT
[000:15:39;939] ADDRESSED THIS HIMSELF.
[000:15:41;140] HE DOESN'T WANT TO LAY OUT HIS
[000:15:43;475] GAME PLAN FOR OUR ENEMIEENEMIES.
[000:15:48;280] IF YOU'RE ASKING, IS THE
[000:15:51;150] PRESIDENT TRYING TO DO THAT?
[000:15:52;985] ABSOLUTELY.
[000:15:53;385] >> HE'S TRYING TO THROW PEOPLE
[000:15:54;520] OFF?
[000:15:54;787] >> I WON'T SAY HE'S TRYING TO
[000:15:56;188] THROW PEOPLE OFF BUT HE'S NOT
[000:15:58;290] TRYING TO BROADCAST OR TELEGRAPH
[000:15:59;892] HIS EXACT ACTIONS.
[000:16:01;727] I THINK WE'VE SEEN WHAT A
[000:16:03;095] FAILURE IT IS WHEN AN
[000:16:04;063] ADMINISTRATION DOES THAT AND
[000:16:04;930] THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT WILL DO
[000:16:06;065] IT DIFFERENTLY AND DO IT BETTER.
[000:16:07;866] >> JUST A FOLLOW UP.
[000:16:09;134] SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE -- THEY SORT
[000:16:11;570] OF CATCH THEIR BREATH IN THIS
[000:16:13;339] TOWN, WHEN THEY SORT OF HOLD
[000:16:14;440] THEIR BREATH IN THIS TOWN, WHEN
[000:16:16;809] HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU
[000:16:18;277] HAVE A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.
[000:16:20;145] IS THAT SOMEWHAT SATISFY
[000:16:20;980] SOMETHING.
[000:16:21;380] >> NO.
[000:16:21;714] I PICTURE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN
[000:16:23;983] HOLDING THEIR BREATH.
[000:16:24;984] THAT MIGHT BE A WELCOME SURPRISE
[000:16:26;251] FOR MOST OF AMERICA.
[000:16:27;086] GO AHEAD.
[000:16:28;153] >> SARAH, ONE MORE THING TO PICK
[000:16:30;222] UP ON WHAT MARGARET WAS TRYING
[000:16:32;024] TO GET AT.
[000:16:32;725] LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY.
[000:16:34;226] CAN YOU EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY
[000:16:35;761] THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ACTUALLY
[000:16:37;663] JUST BEING MISCHIEVOUS?
[000:16:39;431] THAT HE WAS MESSING WITH THE
[000:16:40;799] PRESS A LITTLE BIT WHEN HE MADE
[000:16:42;234] THAT COMMENT.
[000:16:43;002] >> I WOULDN'T SAY HE'S MESSING
[000:16:44;737] WITH THE PRESS.
[000:16:45;637] I SAY WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS WORLD
[000:16:48;874] ISSUES HERE.
[000:16:49;942] I THINK NORTH KOREA, IRAN BOTH
[000:16:51;477] CONTINUE TO BE BAD ACTORS AND
[000:16:53;112] THE PRESIDENT IS SOMETHING THAT
[000:16:54;279] WILL ALWAYS LOOK FOR WAYS TO
[000:16:56;448] PROTECT AMERICANS.
[000:16:57;483] HE'S NOT GOING TO DICTATE WHAT
[000:16:58;784] THOSE ACTIONS MAY LOOK LIKE.
[000:17:01;286] I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
[000:17:02;321] BEYOND THAT THAT I CAN ADD ON
[000:17:03;822] THAT FRONT.
[000:17:04;256] >> AND ANOTHER QUESTION ON IRAN.
[000:17:06;725] A COUPLE DAYS AGO SENATOR TOM
[000:17:10;062] COTTON GAVE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE
[000:17:13;365] SAYS THEY BELIEVES THE BEST
[000:17:15;901] OUTCOME WOULD BE TO HAVE
[000:17:19;138] CONGRESS REIMPOSE SANCTIONS.
[000:17:21;006] WE WOULD USE THIS PERIOD OF 120,
[000:17:24;109] 90 DAYS TO RENEGOTIATE SEVERAL
[000:17:26;712] TERMS OF THE DEAL.
[000:17:27;946] DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK THAT
[000:17:29;581] THAT SOUNDS LIKE APPLAUSABLE AND
[000:17:30;916] GOOD WAY TO DO WITH THE IRAN
[000:17:32;518] NUCLEAR DEAL?
[000:17:33;018] >> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
[000:17:35;020] THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON
[000:17:36;355] THE DECISION HE HAS.
[000:17:37;723] WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, THE
[000:17:39;691] PRESIDENT ISN'T LOOKING AT ONE
[000:17:41;026] PIECE OF THIS.
[000:17:43;629] HE'S LOOKING AT ALL OF THE BAD
[000:17:45;798] BEHAVIOR OF IRAN, NOT JUST THE
[000:17:48;367] NUCLEAR DEAL AS BAD BEHAVIOR.
[000:17:50;536] THE BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING,
[000:17:52;504] DESTABILIZING OF THE REGION,
[000:17:54;606] NUMBER 1 STATE SPONSOR OF
[000:17:57;076] TERROR, ELICIT NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
[000:17:59;078] HE WANTS TO LOOK FOR A BROAD
[000:18:01;480] STRATEGY THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF
[000:18:03;048] THOSE PROBLEMS.
[000:18:03;549] THAT'S WHAT HIS TEAM IS FOCUSED
[000:18:05;384] ON AND THAT'S WHAT HE WILL ROLL
[000:18:06;885] OUT TO ADDRESS THAT AS A WHOLE
[000:18:08;353] IN THE COMING DAYS.
[000:18:11;423] STEVE?
[000:18:11;757] >> IS IT THE PRESIDENT'S WISH --
[000:18:14;626] >> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET
[000:18:20;265] INTO THE DETAILS OF THE
[000:18:20;899] PRESIDENT'S DECISION UNTIL HE
[000:18:22;000] MAKES THAT.
[000:18:22;468] >> SARAH, ABOUT CUBA.
[000:18:24;403] CBS NEWS IS REPORTING THAT THE
[000:18:26;305] STORY IS GOING TO A NEW LEVEL.
[000:18:27;773] THERE'S AMERICANS THAT DON'T
[000:18:28;974] WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT
[000:18:31;677] SAYING THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THESE
[000:18:33;545] ATTACKS.
[000:18:33;879] THERE'S A HANDFUL OF AMERICANS
[000:18:35;180] THAT HAVE REPORTED THESE
[000:18:36;181] SYMPTOMS.
[000:18:36;548] WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
[000:18:37;816] HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE VIEWING
[000:18:38;984] THIS?
[000:18:39;284] HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET TO THE
[000:18:41;320] BOTTOM OF IT?
[000:18:41;820] >> SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE
[000:18:43;255] SERIOUSLY.
[000:18:43;655] WE'RE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE.
[000:18:45;390] THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING
[000:18:46;391] THE LEAD ON THIS EFFORT AND
[000:18:47;359] WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK
[000:18:48;794] INTO THIS UNTIL WE GET SOME REAL
[000:18:52;331] ANSWERS.
[000:18:53;565] >> JUST TO DRILL DOWN ON WHAT
[000:18:55;501] YOU SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE
[000:18:56;835] PRESS.
[000:18:57;336] SAYING THAT WE OWE IT -- I DON'T
[000:18:58;837] THINK ANYBODY DISAGREES THAT WE
[000:19:02;141] SHOULD BE ACCURATE.
[000:19:03;408] BUT DO YOU AND THE PRESIDENT
[000:19:05;210] BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS A
[000:19:06;578] RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AS TRUTHFUL
[000:19:09;414] AND HONEST AND HAS HE DONE IT
[000:19:13;952] AND THOSE SURROGATES THAT HAVE
[000:19:16;955] USED ALTERNATIVE FACTS AND WOULD
[000:19:19;525] THEY NOT DO THAT?
[000:19:20;459] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:19:21;193] WE ALL COME HERE EVERY DAY TO
[000:19:22;895] GIVE YOU THE BEST AND MOST
[000:19:24;296] ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT WE
[000:19:26;865] CAN.
[000:19:27;499] APRIL?
[000:19:28;567] >> GOING BACK TO THE ANSWER
[000:19:31;770] ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND THE
[000:19:33;739] PRESIDENT.
[000:19:34;106] IS GENERAL KELLY PART OF THAT
[000:19:37;009] LEADERSHIP TEAM WITH THE
[000:19:38;143] PRESIDENT AS HE'S LEADING IN
[000:19:39;178] THIS WHITE HOUSE?
[000:19:40;445] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:19:41;313] >> DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE
[000:19:42;648] CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL KELLY?
[000:19:43;849] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:19:44;883] >> TODAY IS FRIDAY.
[000:19:45;551] CAN WE EXPECT A RESIGNATION
[000:19:48;120] TODAY?
[000:19:48;420] >> I DON'T THINK SO, APRIL.
[000:19:52;558] DAVID?
[000:19:53;759] >> SINCE WE LAST HEARD FROM YOU,
[000:19:56;295] THE FORM PRODUCER HARVEY
[000:19:58;497] WINESTEIN HAS BECOME THE SUBJECT
[000:20:00;999] OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
[000:20:03;268] ALLEGATIONS.
[000:20:03;669] AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DEMOCRATS
[000:20:06;405] THAT HAVE HAD DONATIONS.
[000:20:10;576] IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT LATINOS
[000:20:12;978] IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD BE DEPORTED
[000:20:16;014] IF THE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED.
[000:20:17;816] DOES THE PRESIDENT THESE THE
[000:20:19;284] DONATIONS SHOULD GO BACK?
[000:20:20;185] >> THAT'S A DECISION FOR THE
[000:20:21;887] INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE.
[000:20:22;487] WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS MONEY
[000:20:23;755] THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE, THAT'S
[000:20:25;290] UP TO THEM.
[000:20:25;991] THAT'S NOT A DECISION FOR US TO
[000:20:27;593] MAKE.
[000:20:27;893] >> ONE MORE -- I'M SORRY.
[000:20:31;463] WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT FIRED
[000:20:34;366] THE IRS HEAD?
[000:20:36;001] HE TALKED ABOUT THE SCANDAL.
[000:20:37;536] WHY DOES HE STILL HAVE A JOB?
[000:20:38;804] >> I'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM AND GET
[000:20:41;640] BACK TO YOU.
[000:20:43;909] >> LAS VEGAS QUESTION.
[000:20:44;776] THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE
[000:20:49;114] POLICE AND THEIR RESPONSE AFTER
[000:20:52;017] THE MASS SHOOTINGS.
[000:20:55;887] NEVADA --
[000:20:57;256] >> CAN YOU SPEAK UP A LITTLE
[000:21:00;359] BIT?
[000:21:00;659] >> NEVADIANS CREDIT FEDERAL
[000:21:02;995] MONDAY PROGRAMS TO TRAIN THEM TO
[000:21:05;130] DEAL WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS TO
[000:21:06;565] DEAL WITH THE GREAT RESPONSE.
[000:21:08;800] YOU HAVE CUTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS
[000:21:10;535] IN YOUR BUDGET PLANS?
[000:21:11;737] ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT?
[000:21:13;939] >> I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE
[000:21:16;808] CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD.
[000:21:17;976] IF THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE WE
[000:21:19;177] FEEL LIKE THE SAFETY AND
[000:21:20;679] SECURITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
[000:21:22;080] MAY BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF CUTS,
[000:21:24;483] I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO
[000:21:26;218] RE-VISIT IT AT THAT TIME.
[000:21:27;085] JIM?
[000:21:28;820] >> SARAH, THE NATION LOST 33,000
[000:21:30;756] JOBS IN SEPTEMBER.
[000:21:31;556] I WAS CURIOUS WHAT THE
[000:21:33;725] PRESIDENT -- HOW THE PRESIDENT
[000:21:36;662] FEELS ABOUT THAT AND HE'S
[000:21:38;764] STEPPING UP HIS EFFORTS TO
[000:21:41;166] CONVINCE CONGRESS TO PASS MAJOR
[000:21:43;168] TAX RETURNS BECAUSE OF THIS
[000:21:44;703] SURPRISING JOB LOSS IN
[000:21:46;171] SEPTEMBER.
[000:21:46;538] >> I THINK TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS
[000:21:48;340] THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE
[000:21:51;543] HURRICANE SEASON.
[000:21:53;045] WHILE MANY DISPLACED WEREN'T
[000:21:54;613] ABLE TO WORK, THE ECONOMY
[000:21:56;348] REMAINS EXTREMELY STRONG.
[000:21:57;582] THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE
[000:21:58;550] JOBS, WHICH IS WHY THE
[000:22:01;153] UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL.
[000:22:02;387] I THINK ONE THING TO REALLY KNOW
[000:22:04;089] AND SOMETHING THAT THIS
[000:22:04;923] ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO FOCUS ON
[000:22:06;325] CERTAINLY MOVING INTO THE
[000:22:07;659] FUTURE, I THINK TAX REFORM PLAY
[000:22:09;227] AS BIG ROLE IN THIS.
[000:22:10;762] ONE OF THE BIG IDENTIFIERS THAT
[000:22:12;898] I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IS THE
[000:22:14;232] DROP IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE,
[000:22:16;335] INCLUDING NEW LOADS FOR AFRICAN
[000:22:18;270] AMERICANS, TEENS AND WOMEN,
[000:22:19;438] WHICH IS CERTAINLY A GREAT STEP
[000:22:22;607] FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS.
[000:22:25;811] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
[000:22:30;749] REPEATEDLY SAID THAT WE SHOULD
[000:22:31;550] LET OBAMACARE IMPLODE.
[000:22:32;150] THERE'S A NEW REPORT IN "THE
[000:22:33;251] WASHINGTON POST" THAT SET THAT
[000:22:35;187] PRESIDENT TRUMP PERSONALLY
[000:22:36;054] DIRECTED ADMINISTRATION
[000:22:36;922] OFFICIALS TO DENY A REQUEST FROM
[000:22:38;690] REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF IOWA TO
[000:22:40;492] FIX THE OBAMACARE MARKET IN THAT
[000:22:41;860] STATE.
[000:22:42;227] IS THAT TRUE?
[000:22:43;161] >> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT
[000:22:45;964] SPECIFIC DIRECTIVE.
[000:22:46;732] SO I'D HAVE TO CHECK INTO THAT
[000:22:48;800] AND GET BACK TO YOU.
[000:22:50;135] >> IF IT IS TRUE --
[000:22:51;470] >> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON
[000:22:54;139] HYPOTHETICALS WHERE I DON'T HAVE
[000:22:56;308] THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME.
[000:22:57;442] >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE
[000:22:59;511] IRAN RECERTIFICATION PROCESS.
[000:23:01;847] REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:23:03;648] DECIDES, WHEN HE MAKES THIS
[000:23:05;117] DECISION NEXT WEEK, WOULD YOU
[000:23:06;985] RATHER NOT HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY
[000:23:09;121] 90 DAYS AFTER THAT?
[000:23:10;789] >> AGAIN, AS I SAID EARLIER,
[000:23:13;158] WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT
[000:23:15;293] IS A BROAD STRATEGY, DOESN'T
[000:23:18;563] JUST ADDRESS ONE PART OF I RAN'S
[000:23:20;565] BAD BEHAVIOR AND ADDRESSES A
[000:23:23;001] WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES.
[000:23:24;503] SO THAT WOULD BE OUR FOCUS.
[000:23:27;472] HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD BEGIN TO
[000:23:28;640] NOT BE A BAD ACTOR AROUND WE
[000:23:30;242] WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS AT ALL.
[000:23:33;311] OUR GOAL WOULD BE TO ADDRESS A
[000:23:34;880] NUMBER OF FACTORS, NOTICE JUST
[000:23:36;748] ONE OR TWO THING.
[000:23:39;718] PETER?
[000:23:40;018] >> A SECOND QUESTION.
[000:23:41;353] THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT HE
[000:23:44;589] WANTED PAKISTAN TO GO AGAINST
[000:23:49;261] AGENTS OF CHAOS.
[000:23:53;365] THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS HERE IN
[000:23:55;434] THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WEEK TO
[000:23:56;468] MEET GENERAL McMASTER.
[000:23:58;203] HAVE YOU SEEN ANY CHANGE IN
[000:24:01;873] PAKISTANI BEHAVIOR?
[000:24:03;341] >> NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT I CAN
[000:24:05;343] WEIGH INTO AT THIS TIME.
[000:24:06;478] WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.
[000:24:09;147] >> WILL THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN
[000:24:12;417] FOR THE CANDIDATE IN VIRGINIA?
[000:24:14;119] >> I'M NOT GROG TO WAY INTO
[000:24:15;520] SPECIFIC RACES AND THE ACTIONS
[000:24:16;955] WE MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE.
[000:24:18;256] THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO END THIS
[000:24:21;293] FOR FRIDAY.
[000:24:22;394] I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT
[000:24:23;662] REST OF THE FRIDAY AND A GOOD
[000:24:27;666] WEEKEND.
[000:24:28;900] THANKS, GUYS.
[000:24:30;202] >> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:24:31;937] PRESS SECRETARY, SARAH SANDERS
[000:24:34;973] WRAPPED UP THE BRIEFING.
[000:24:37;075] THAT STARTED AFTER PRESIDENT
[000:24:39;177] TRUMP WITH A WINK AND A WARNING
[000:24:42;814] AFTER REMAINING WHAT HE MEANT
[000:24:45;383] WHEN HE CALLED A MEETING WITH
[000:24:46;885] THE MILITARY MELITERS THE CALM
[000:24:53;058] BEFORE THE STORM.
[000:24:53;558] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:24:54;726] WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?
[000:24:57;329] >> YOU'LL FIND OUT.
[000:24:59;297] >> THANK YOU.
[000:25:00;499] >> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT MADE
[000:25:01;266] THE ORIGINAL COMMENT LAST NIGHT
[000:25:03;835] AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:25:04;536] AT THAT TIME HE WAS MEETING WITH
[000:25:05;504] HIS MILITARY LEADERS TO TALK
[000:25:08;340] ABOUT MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY
[000:25:11;009] ISSUES, INCLUDING IRAN, NORTH
[000:25:14;679] KOREA AND ISIS.
[000:25:17;449] LISTEN.
[000:25:17;782] >> THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE
[000:25:21;152] STORM.
[000:25:27;792] >> WHAT STORM IS THAT,
[000:25:30;629] MR. PRESIDENT?
[000:25:31;997] >> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.
[000:25:37;836] >> WHAT STORM, MR. PRESIDENT?
[000:25:39;804] >> YOU'LL FIND OUT.
[000:25:40;772] >> Shepard: YOU'LL FIND OUT.
[000:25:41;773] WE WERE HOPING TO FIND OUT MORE
[000:25:43;508] AT THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING
[000:25:44;976] TODAY.
[000:25:45;477] KRISTIN FISHER IS LIVE IN THE
[000:25:47;245] BRIEFING ROOM.
[000:25:47;779] WE DID NOT.
[000:25:50;181] >> WE DID NOT FIND OUT ANY
[000:25:51;783] ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION.
[000:25:53;285] THAT HAS BEEN THE MILLION DOLLAR
[000:25:54;386] QUESTION ALL DAY HERE IN
[000:25:55;954] WASHINGTON AND AROUND THE WORLD.
[000:25:57;889] WHAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:25:59;124] REFERRING TO WHEN HE SAID THAT
[000:26:00;492] THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE
[000:26:01;960] STORM.
[000:26:02;260] YOU KNOW, REPORTERS IN THIS ROOM
[000:26:04;863] ASK THAT QUESTION ABOUT AS MANY
[000:26:06;131] TIMES AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY ASK
[000:26:07;866] THE PRESS SECRETARY.
[000:26:08;967] THEY ASKED HER, YOU KNOW, WAS
[000:26:11;002] THIS INTENDED TO KEEP OUR
[000:26:13;738] ADVERSARIES GUESSING?
[000:26:14;940] PERHAPS WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:26:16;041] BEING MISCHIEVOUS OR MAYBE HE
[000:26:18;810] JUST MESSING WITH THE PRESS.
[000:26:20;378] HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.
[000:26:22;380] LISTEN TO THIS.
[000:26:23;481] >> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,
[000:26:25;483] I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS, AS I
[000:26:27;552] HAVE FROM THIS PODIUM ON QUITE A
[000:26:29;788] FEW OCCASIONS, WE'RE NEVER GOING
[000:26:31;456] TO SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT THE
[000:26:33;491] PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DO.
[000:26:34;960] AS HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN
[000:26:36;428] ADDITION TO THOSE COMMENTS,
[000:26:37;829] YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
[000:26:42;534] I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE
[000:26:43;201] PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE
[000:26:43;835] AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY
[000:26:44;603] SERIOUS.
[000:26:45;303] HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT'S HIS
[000:26:48;139] NUMBER 1 PRIORITY.
[000:26:49;374] IF HE FEELS THAT ACTION IS
[000:26:51;009] NECESSARY, HE WILL TAKE IT.
[000:26:52;110] >> WAS HE REFERRING TO NORTH
[000:26:53;712] KOREA?
[000:26:54;012] WAS HE REFERRING TO SUPERIOR IS
[000:26:56;147] FIGHTERS IN NIGER AFTER THE LOSS
[000:26:57;582] OF GREEN BERETS THIS WEEK OR
[000:26:59;384] MAYBE IRAN?
[000:27:01;186] WE JUST DON'T KNOW.
[000:27:02;787] AS THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS
[000:27:05;123] SECRETARY MADE CLEAR, SHE'S NOT
[000:27:07;592] GOING TO GIVE MORE DETAILS.
[000:27:08;793] SHE WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO HIM,
[000:27:10;729] SHEP.
[000:27:11;029] >> Shepard: KRISTIN, THE WHITE
[000:27:11;830] HOUSE TALKING ABOUT THE TRUMP
[000:27:13;064] ADMINISTRATION'S NEW LIMITS ON
[000:27:16;001] MANDATORY BIRTH CONTROL COVERAGE
[000:27:17;035] UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR
[000:27:20;005] OBAMACARE.
[000:27:20;372] THE NEW POLICY LETS EMPLOYERS
[000:27:22;774] REFUSE FREE CONTRACEPTIVES BY
[000:27:26;211] CLAIMING A RELIGIOUS OR MORAL
[000:27:31;650] OBJECTION.
[000:27:32;017] THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES
[000:27:33;685] UNION HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AND
[000:27:35;253] OTHERS ARE PLANNING TO DO THE
[000:27:36;655] SAME THING.
[000:27:37;155] BACK TO KRISTIN FISHER, A TOUCHY
[000:27:39;124] SUBJECT THERE TODAY.
[000:27:40;258] >> RIGHT.
[000:27:40;692] SO BEFORE THESE EXEMPTIONS WERE
[000:27:43;595] STRICTLY LIMITED TO RELIGIOUS
[000:27:46;865] BELIEFS.
[000:27:47;198] NOW THEY'VE BEEN EXPANDED TO
[000:27:49;901] INCLUDE MORAL OBJECTIONS AS
[000:27:51;670] WELL.
[000:27:51;970] THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT
[000:27:53;938] WHAT CONSTITUTES A MORAL
[000:27:55;907] OBJECTION, HOW WILL THAT BE
[000:27:57;208] DETERMINED.
[000:27:57;609] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT WILL
[000:27:58;443] BE DETERMINED BY THE STATE.
[000:27:59;644] THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT
[000:28:01;312] ROLL BACK OF THE CONTRACEPTION
[000:28:03;948] MANDATE BY THIS WHITE HOUSE AND
[000:28:05;517] THE ACLU HAS NOW THREATENED TO
[000:28:08;353] FILE A LAWSUIT.
[000:28:09;621] JUST A MOMENT AGO, THE PRESS
[000:28:11;189] SECRETARY WAS ASKED WHAT DOES
[000:28:12;090] THE WHITE HOUSE THINK ABOUT
[000:28:13;058] THIS?
[000:28:13;391] COULD IT GO TO THE SUPREME
[000:28:15;727] COURT?
[000:28:16;027] HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID.
[000:28:17;295] >> I WOULD PROBABLY NEVER USE
[000:28:20;365] THE ACLU TO GET MY TALKING
[000:28:22;701] POINTS.
[000:28:23;034] THE PRESIDENT SAID THE FREEDOM
[000:28:25;370] TO PRACTICE ONE'S FAITH IS A
[000:28:27;272] FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS
[000:28:28;273] COUNTRY.
[000:28:28;606] ALL OF US DO.
[000:28:29;908] THAT'S ALL THAT TODAY WAS ABOUT.
[000:28:32;610] OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD
[000:28:34;012] PROTECT THAT RIGHT.
[000:28:34;646] AS LONG AS DONALD TRUMP IS
[000:28:37;148] PRESIDENT, HE WILL.
[000:28:38;049] >> THE FLIP SIDE IS COMING FROM
[000:28:39;984] DEMOCRATS.
[000:28:40;618] NANCY PELOSI CALLED THIS NEW
[000:28:42;487] RULE DESPICABLE BECAUSE WHAT
[000:28:44;756] THIS MEANS IS NOW THAT
[000:28:46;324] POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF
[000:28:47;492] THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ACROSS THIS
[000:28:49;561] COUNTRY WILL NO LONGER HAVE
[000:28:51;896] ACCESS TO FREE BIRTH CONTROL IF
[000:28:54;766] THIS RULE GOES FORWARD, SHEP.
[000:28:56;167] >> Shepard: THANK YOU, KRISTIN.
[000:28:57;602] LET'S TURN TO CHRIS WALLACE NOW,
[000:28:59;404] THE ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY"
[000:29:01;706] LIVE WITH US IN D.C.
[000:29:06;945] WITH A SMILE THE PRESIDENT SAYS,
[000:29:08;446] YOU CAN TAKE THIS MEETING TO BE
[000:29:10;548] THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
[000:29:12;617] WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO THINK?
[000:29:15;987] >> WELL -- LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW
[000:29:18;022] IS THE ANSWER.
[000:29:20;458] THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TO ANSWER.
[000:29:23;862] YOU SAW SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS,
[000:29:25;230] HIS CHIEF SPOKESPERSON REFUSED
[000:29:26;664] TO ANSWER.
[000:29:27;532] MY GUESS IS THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:29:29;601] SITTING THERE WITH A TOP BRASS
[000:29:30;902] OF THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY ON
[000:29:33;505] EARTH EVER AND SAYING IT'S THE
[000:29:34;873] CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
[000:29:35;807] HE'S NOT SAYING WE'RE ABOUT TO
[000:29:37;842] STRIKE NORTH KOREA, WE'RE ABOUT
[000:29:39;310] TO STRIKE IRAN.
[000:29:40;245] HE'S NOT GOING TO TIP HIS HAND
[000:29:42;380] ON IMMINENT MILITARY ACTION.
[000:29:44;249] HE'S SAYING, WE HAVE THE MOST
[000:29:46;751] POWERFUL MILITARY AND DON'T MESS
[000:29:48;019] WITH US.
[000:29:48;586] WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.
[000:29:49;788] DO I THINK HE'S LAYING OUT A
[000:29:52;223] SPECIFIC -- SOMETHING THAT WILL
[000:29:53;424] HAPPEN IN THE NEXT DAYS, WEEKS,
[000:29:56;327] HOURS, MONTHS?
[000:29:56;995] NO.
[000:29:57;462] I THINK HE'S SAYING WE HAVE THAT
[000:30:00;899] CAPABILITY.
[000:30:01;432] THERE WAS A VERY GOOD QUESTION
[000:30:02;934] ASKED IN THE BRIEFING, THIS
[000:30:06;304] PRESIDENT LIKE RICHARD NIXON
[000:30:08;640] SUBSCRIBES TO THE BAD MAN
[000:30:09;774] THEORY.
[000:30:10;108] ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE TOOLS A
[000:30:11;843] PRESIDENT CAN USE AS THE MOST
[000:30:14;879] POWERFULMAN ON EARTH IS TO LAY
[000:30:18;516] OUT TO ADVERSARIES THAT HE CAN
[000:30:26;457] DO ANYTHING.
[000:30:27;759] YOU BETTER BE CONCERNED.
[000:30:28;493] THERE'S AN INTERESTING STORY
[000:30:30;929] THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK THAT HIS
[000:30:32;530] TRADE REPRESENTATIVE WAS GOING
[000:30:33;631] TO SOUTH KOREA TO NEGOTIATE A
[000:30:36;801] NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE DEAL.
[000:30:39;003] THE PRESIDENT SAID TO HIM, WE'RE
[000:30:41;706] GOING TO ONLY GIVE THIS 30 DAYS.
[000:30:43;675] WHEN THE TRADE REPRESENTATIVE
[000:30:44;776] SAID, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL THEM
[000:30:45;910] 30 DAYS.
[000:30:47;178] HE SAID NO, NO.
[000:30:48;913] I MIGHT DROP OUT AT ANY POINT
[000:30:54;752] AND PULL THE PLUG ON THIS AT ANY
[000:30:55;587] MOMENT.
[000:30:55;920] THE POINT BEING THAT SOUTH KOREA
[000:30:56;654] SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL CONFIDENT
[000:30:57;455] IN THAT THEY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT
[000:30:58;990] THIS PRESIDENT WILL DO.
[000:30:59;958] MY GUESS IS THAT IS BASICALLY
[000:31:01;326] WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING
[000:31:04;295] HERE.
[000:31:04;596] >> Shepard: IF YOU'RE IN
[000:31:05;797] NEW ORLEANS OR IN GULFPORT AND
[000:31:08;266] YOU SAY THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE
[000:31:09;567] THE STORM THAT MEANS THERE'S A
[000:31:11;402] TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE
[000:31:12;237] HEADED AND HELL COMING.
[000:31:13;271] WHEN YOU SAY IT WITH YOUR
[000:31:14;973] MILITARY LEADERS BEHIND YOU,
[000:31:16;474] THIS MEETING OF THE LEADERS IS
[000:31:18;176] THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM,
[000:31:19;477] YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT SOME SORT
[000:31:20;879] OF CONFLICT IS BREWING.
[000:31:22;614] ARE YOU NOT?
[000:31:23;414] I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IT COULD
[000:31:24;782] MEAN.
[000:31:25;149] HERE'S THE MILITARY LEADERS,
[000:31:26;784] CALM BEFORE THE STORM IS COMING.
[000:31:28;353] IT'S NOT EXACTLY A CALMING,
[000:31:31;356] COMFORTING THING.
[000:31:31;956] >> IT ISN'T.
[000:31:32;824] BUT I DON'T THINK HE WANTS IRAN
[000:31:34;525] OR NORTH KOREA OR THE LEADERS OF
[000:31:38;129] THOSE REGIMES TO BE CALM AND
[000:31:39;864] COMFORTABLE.
[000:31:40;298] IT'S LIKE WHEN HE SAID TO NORTH
[000:31:42;533] KOREA, YOU KNOW, IF THEY PUSH US
[000:31:44;302] TOO FAR, WE'LL RAIN DOWN FIRE
[000:31:45;937] AND FURY ON THEM.
[000:31:48;006] HE'S NOT SAYING I'M ABOUT TO DO
[000:31:50;108] IT.
[000:31:50;375] HE'S NOT SAYING NEXT TUESDAY AT
[000:31:51;776] 3:00 P.M., WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
[000:31:53;311] THIS PARTICULAR TACTIC.
[000:31:54;245] HE'S SAYING I HAVE THAT
[000:31:55;680] CAPABILITY AND PREPARED TO USE
[000:31:56;748] IT IF NECESSARY.
[000:31:57;448] >> Shepard: THERE'S A NEW POLL
[000:31:58;483] OUT FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS.
[000:32:00;385] 24% OF AMERICANS SAY THE UNITED
[000:32:02;020] STATES IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT
[000:32:04;455] DIRECTION.
[000:32:04;989] 67% DISAPPROVE OF THE
[000:32:07;392] PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE.
[000:32:08;726] NORMALLY WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS
[000:32:10;261] HAPPEN, HE WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME
[000:32:12;030] ACTION TO CHANGE THE POLLS.
[000:32:13;364] I WONDER HOW CONCERNED THEY ARE
[000:32:16;367] IF AT ALL?
[000:32:17;168] >> LOOK, HE'S BEEN LOW IN THE
[000:32:18;770] POLLS FOR QUITE A PERIOD OF TIME
[000:32:20;371] NOW.
[000:32:20;672] HE BASICALLY HAS SUPPORT OF 34
[000:32:22;473] TO 40, OCCASIONALLY PICKS UP
[000:32:25;076] INTO THE 40%.
[000:32:26;644] HE'S UNDER WATER IN ALMOST ALL
[000:32:28;146] OF THE POLLS.
[000:32:29;314] HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION
[000:32:32;183] FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS.
[000:32:35;353] I THINK HE FEELS IN REASONABLY
[000:32:37;989] STRONG SHAPE.
[000:32:38;823] HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE A FELLOW
[000:32:41;159] THAT KNOW WHAT'S HE WANTS TO DO
[000:32:42;593] HE'S GOTTEN HIGH MARKS ON SOME
[000:32:44;595] THINGS.
[000:32:44;929] VERY HIGH MARKS ON THE REACTION
[000:32:46;798] TO IRMA AND HARVEY AND TEXAS AND
[000:32:49;000] FLORIDA.
[000:32:49;334] NOT NEARLY AS HIGH MARKS ON HIS
[000:32:51;169] REACTION TO MARIA IN PUERTO
[000:32:52;770] RICO.
[000:32:53;071] THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
[000:32:54;172] BUMP ALONG.
[000:32:55;039] NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
[000:32:56;074] THERE'S TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE
[000:32:57;108] VERY SUPPORTIVE AND THINK HE
[000:32:58;977] DOES THE RIGHT THINGS AND TIMES
[000:33:00;144] WHEN HE UPSETS PEOPLE.
[000:33:04;716] >> Shepard: AND ALSO IN THE
[000:33:05;717] NEWS, THIS CONTRACEPTION CHANGE.
[000:33:07;952] HOW IS THAT FLYING THERE
[000:33:09;487] POLITICALLY AND OTHERWISE?
[000:33:10;655] >> LOOK, IT'S THE USUAL
[000:33:12;790] SUSPECTS.
[000:33:13;157] IF YOU'RE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF
[000:33:15;326] BIRTH CONTROL, YOU'RE OUTRAGED
[000:33:16;961] BY THIS.
[000:33:17;562] THE PRESIDENT IS DRAMATICALLY
[000:33:21;099] INCREASING THE EXCEPTIONS.
[000:33:23;601] LET'S GO BACK.
[000:33:25;069] OBAMACARE AS PART OF OFFERING
[000:33:27;705] EMPLOYERS, OFFERING HEALTHCARE
[000:33:29;007] SERVICES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES,
[000:33:30;375] THEY HAVE TO OFFER AS A FREE
[000:33:33;678] BENEFIT BIRTH CONTROL.
[000:33:36;714] NOW WE HAVE THE FIGHT IN THE
[000:33:40;251] SUPREME COURT WHEN OBAMA WAS
[000:33:44;355] PRESIDENT.
[000:33:44;722] THE HOBBY LOBBY, GROUPS THAT
[000:33:46;991] WERE EXEMPTED.
[000:33:48;993] NOW THE PRESIDENT WITH HIS HHS
[000:33:51;129] REGULATION IS DRAMATICALLY
[000:33:52;964] INCREASING THE EXCEPTIONS AND IS
[000:33:54;365] GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR
[000:33:55;833] GROUPS, NONPROFITS, TO PROPER IF
[000:33:57;869] ITS, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS,
[000:34:00;471] NONRELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IF
[000:34:02;140] THEY HAVE A RELIGIOUS OR A MORAL
[000:34:06;144] OBJECTION, THEY CAN SAY THAT
[000:34:07;211] THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO
[000:34:09;947] PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL TO THEIR
[000:34:11;249] EMPLOYEES.
[000:34:11;649] THE ACLU IS ALREADY FILING A
[000:34:13;785] SUIT ON THIS.
[000:34:14;552] THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY END UP IN
[000:34:17;188] THE COURTS.
[000:34:18;423] >> Shepard: IT IS A BIT
[000:34:20;792] CONFUSING AS BIRTH CONTROL
[000:34:22;160] PREVENTS ABORTIONS FROM EVER
[000:34:25;063] HAPPENING.
[000:34:25;596] IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE BIRTH
[000:34:28;399] CONTROL, FAMILY PLANNING COMES
[000:34:31;502] ALONG MORE EASILY AND WITHOUT
[000:34:32;770] THE CONTROVERSY THAT COMES ALONG
[000:34:35;139] WITH ABORTIONS.
[000:34:36;874] IT JUST SEEMS TO BE WORKING
[000:34:39;444] AGAINST ITSELF IN A WAY.
[000:34:41;245] >> WELL, YES, BUT THAT'S THE
[000:34:45;783] TENANT OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
[000:34:47;251] THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING
[000:34:48;486] TO INTERFERE WITH LIFE.
[000:34:50;021] ABORTION INTERFERES WITH LIFE.
[000:34:53;224] THEY THINK THAT BIRTH CONTROL,
[000:34:56;861] ARTIFICIAL BIRTH CONTROL
[000:34:57;628] INTERFERES WITH LIFE.
[000:34:58;563] THERE ARE PLENTY OF RELIGIONS
[000:35:00;098] THAT HOLD TO THOSE TENANTS EVEN
[000:35:05;937] THOUGH YOUR POINT ABOUT THE LACK
[000:35:06;737] OF BIRTH CONTROL POSSIBLY
[000:35:07;405] LEADING TO UNWANTED PREGNANCIES
[000:35:09;674] IS ALSO TRUE.
[000:35:10;808] >> Shepard: ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.
[000:35:13;377] WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND?
[000:35:14;812] >> I FEEL LIKE YOU PUT ME
[000:35:16;814] THROUGH MY PACES TODAY.
[000:35:18;015] LAS VEGAS IS A BIG STORY STILL.
[000:35:20;151] A TERRIBLE STORY.
[000:35:21;719] WE'RE STILL LEFT A WEEK LATER
[000:35:23;754] WITH THE QUESTION WHY AND WHEN
[000:35:25;189] WILL PEOPLE BE TALKING TO YOU?
[000:35:26;591] STEVE WYNN, ONE OF THE KINGS OF
[000:35:28;926] LAS VEGAS.
[000:35:29;360] THE HEAD OF TWO OF THE BIGGEST
[000:35:31;896] HOTELS AND CASINOS IN THAT TOWN.
[000:35:34;632] INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WYNN
[000:35:35;733] DECIDE ADD YEAR AGO THAT
[000:35:36;901] LAS VEGAS WAS A SOFT TARGET.
[000:35:39;036] WHEN YOU HEAR THE KINDS OF
[000:35:40;104] THINGS -- WE'LL HAVE AN
[000:35:41;572] EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SUNDAY --
[000:35:42;707] THAT HE DID TO TRY TO HARDEN THE
[000:35:45;109] WYNN HOTEL AND TO HARDEN THE
[000:35:47;879] ENCORE HOTEL IN TERMS OF
[000:35:50;515] BRINGING IN FORMER SEAL TEAMS
[000:35:51;682] SIX MEMBERS, FORMER CIA
[000:35:55;353] OFFICERS, HIDDEN DETECTORS,
[000:35:57;155] HIDDEN PROFILERS IN THE CASINOS.
[000:35:59;757] JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIS
[000:36:01;826] PROPERTIES.
[000:36:02;226] BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW THREAT,
[000:36:03;928] WHICH WE SAW FROM STEPHEN
[000:36:05;329] PADDOCK, WHICH IS KNOCKING OUT
[000:36:06;597] THE WINDOWS AND FIRING DOWN FROM
[000:36:08;266] THE 32nd FLOOR.
[000:36:09;300] ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL TALK TO
[000:36:11;569] STEVE WYNN ABOUT, HOW DO YOU
[000:36:12;904] HANDLE AND PREVENT THAT WE'LL BE
[000:36:15;206] TALKING TO ERIC PRATT, THE
[000:36:16;807] EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS
[000:36:18;809] OF AMERICA.
[000:36:20;344] INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHILE THE
[000:36:22;713] NRA IS SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD
[000:36:24;949] REGULATE AND RESTRICT THE BUMP
[000:36:26;617] STOCKS, ERIC PRATT SAYS NO.
[000:36:28;653] WE'LL TALK TO HIM.
[000:36:29;420] >> Shepard: WE'LL WATCH THIS
[000:36:31;822] SUNDAY, CHRIS, ON "FOX NEWS
[000:36:34;125] SUNDAY."
[000:36:34;458] LET'S GO TO MICHAEL CROWLEY FROM
[000:36:37;361] POLITCO.
[000:36:37;695] I'M HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING
[000:36:40;031] AWAY FROM THE CALM BEFORE THE
[000:36:41;232] STORM THING, MICHAEL.
[000:36:42;466] HE SAID IT.
[000:36:44;869] NOBODY ASKED HIM ANYTHING ABOUT
[000:36:46;070] IT.
[000:36:46;404] IT JUST CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
[000:36:47;738] IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO, HE HAS
[000:36:49;740] A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHEN
[000:36:52;743] HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS.
[000:36:54;412] ALMOST FEELS LIKE A TEASE DURING
[000:36:57;715] A REALITY SHOW.
[000:36:59;383] SERIOUSLY.
[000:36:59;750] WELL, YOU'LL SEE.
[000:37:02;220] CALM BEFORE THE STORM!
[000:37:03;487] >> HE'S A REALITY SHOW STAR,
[000:37:05;856] SHEP.
[000:37:06;157] HE BRINGS SOME OF THAT TO THE
[000:37:08;259] PRESIDENCY.
[000:37:08;659] I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY.
[000:37:09;994] I THINK THE GUY REALLY DOES HAVE
[000:37:12;296] A SENSE OF DRAMA LIKE, THIS IT'S
[000:37:15;466] ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT HE'S SORT
[000:37:17;101] OF WORKING THE AUDIENCE.
[000:37:18;603] IT'S POSSIBLE THIS.
[000:37:19;737] A THROW-AWAY COMMENT THAT TOOK
[000:37:23;174] ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN.
[000:37:26;110] INITIALLY.
[000:37:26;510] NOW HE'S RUNNING WITH IT.
[000:37:28;145] HE'S ENJOYING IT.
[000:37:29;847] NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING
[000:37:31;983] ABOUT.
[000:37:32;316] THERE AREN'T OFFICIALS AROUND
[000:37:33;584] HIM LEAKING THERE'S SOME SECRET
[000:37:36;854] MEETING.
[000:37:37;221] I WOULD SAY MY MAIN GUESS IS
[000:37:39;991] THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A MIND
[000:37:42;260] GAME HE'S PLAYING WITH NORTH
[000:37:43;160] KOREA.
[000:37:43;494] HE'S TRYING TO GET INSIDE THE
[000:37:45;196] HEAD OF KIM JONG-UN.
[000:37:45;997] I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THIS
[000:37:47;164] IS PART OF IT, BUT IT WOULD BE
[000:37:49;700] CONSISTENT WITH THINGS LIKE
[000:37:50;768] TRUMP CALLING HIM NICKNAMES LIKE
[000:37:53;838] ROCKET MAN AND LITTLE ROCKET
[000:37:55;239] MAN.
[000:37:55;773] MAKING THE NORTH KOREANS THINK
[000:37:57;141] THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP'S
[000:37:59;110] NEXT MOVE IS.
[000:37:59;844] HE COULD BE A LITTLE CRAZY.
[000:38:01;345] THE GUY WAVING THE GUN AROUND.
[000:38:03;080] YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?
[000:38:04;048] THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE THE
[000:38:06;884] CHANCE?
[000:38:08;152] IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH
[000:38:10;187] THAT.
[000:38:10;488] >> Shepard: YOU SAID I HOPE THE
[000:38:12;556] CIA IS RIGHT IN HIS ASSESSMENT
[000:38:14;492] OF KIM JONG-UN.
[000:38:15;326] >> RIGHT.
[000:38:16;027] THE CIA BELIEVES THAT KIM
[000:38:17;295] JONG-UN IS FUNDAMENTALLY
[000:38:19;630] RATIONALE.
[000:38:19;997] THE KEY WAY TO TRANSLATE THAT
[000:38:21;565] IS, HE'S NOT SUICIDAL.
[000:38:22;933] HE'S NOT GOING TO GO DOWN -- HE
[000:38:24;869] DOESN'T WANT TO GO DOWN IN
[000:38:27;071] FLAMES.
[000:38:27;405] HE LIKES HIS LIFE.
[000:38:28;639] NORTH KOREA IS A MISERABLE PLAY
[000:38:30;808] OVERALL.
[000:38:31;175] HE LIVES COMFORTABLY.
[000:38:32;910] THERE'S LIQUOR AND WOMEN AND
[000:38:34;312] NICE TECHNOLOGY IF HE WANTS IT.
[000:38:37;848] SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS IF WE'RE
[000:38:39;383] WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT DO
[000:38:41;919] SOMETHING TOTALLY IRRATIONAL AND
[000:38:44;655] UNEXPECTED.
[000:38:45;056] WHAT IS AMAZING AT THIS POINT,
[000:38:47;291] IT'S THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT
[000:38:48;159] PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DECIDE, IS
[000:38:49;960] HE ACTING TOTALLY RATIONALLY.
[000:38:52;563] MAYBE THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO
[000:38:53;964] PRESENT HIMSELF -- THERE'S A
[000:38:56;467] THEORY, THE MAD MAN THEORY.
[000:38:57;435] >> Shepard: EVERYBODY IS TALKING
[000:38:58;436] ABOUT THAT TODAY.
[000:38:59;136] CHRIS WALLACE MENTIONED IT.
[000:39:00;538] I READ IT ON MY FEED.
[000:39:01;972] WHAT PROMPTED THIS?
[000:39:04;542] WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?
[000:39:05;810] >> I THINK IT'S THE WAY TRUMP
[000:39:08;179] APPROACHES THESE ISSUES, THIS
[000:39:10;214] GOES BACK TO THE NIXON
[000:39:11;749] ADMINISTRATION WHERE HE TRIED TO
[000:39:16;887] CULTIVATE AN IMAGE THAT HE WAS
[000:39:17;655] CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING, GOING
[000:39:18;456] NUCLEAR, FOR INSTANCE AGAINST
[000:39:20;257] THE CHINESE AND TRYING TO SCARE
[000:39:22;360] YOUR OPPONENT BY MAKING THEM
[000:39:23;994] THINK YOU'RE NOT A RATIONALE
[000:39:25;463] ACTOR.
[000:39:26;530] WHAT IS AMAZING, WE SPENT THIS
[000:39:28;899] TIME TRYING TO DECIDE IF THE
[000:39:31;502] NORTH KOREANS ARE NATIONAL.
[000:39:32;303] NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SEE IF
[000:39:33;704] DONALD TRUMP IS RATIONALE.
[000:39:34;739] DOES HE PLAY BY THE OTHER RULES
[000:39:37;274] THAT AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE?
[000:39:39;176] THEY FELT LIKE AMERICAN
[000:39:40;578] PRESIDENTS WOULD STAY WITHIN
[000:39:41;345] CERTAIN BOUNDARIES AND NOT
[000:39:43;080] INITIATE MILITARY ACTION.
[000:39:44;382] OR IS HE REALLY GOING TO GO FOR
[000:39:46;350] IT IN A WAY WE'VE NEVER SEN
[000:39:47;685] BEFORE?
[000:39:48;018] THEY DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.
[000:39:49;553] TRUMP LIKES THAT.
[000:39:50;388] >> Shepard: MICHAEL CROWLEY,
[000:39:52;456] FOREIGN -- SENIOR FOREIGN
[000:39:54;358] AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR
[000:39:55;626] POLITCO.
[000:39:55;993] THANKS AS ALWAYS.
[000:39:56;527] >> THANKS.
[000:39:56;961] >> Shepard: AHEAD, THE
[000:39:58;295] INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS
[000:39:59;196] CONCERT KILLER.
[000:40:00;297] NEW REPORTS ON WHAT THE GUNMAN
[000:40:02;967] HAD IN HIS ROOM AND QUESTIONS
[000:40:04;602] NOW.
[000:40:04;869] LISTEN TO THE QUESTION THEY'RE
[000:40:07;104] TRYING TO ANSWER NOW.
[000:40:09;540] WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS ROOM?
[000:40:13;844] AS THE AGENT CHASE DOWN CLUES
[000:40:16;781] AND SURVIVORS FACE CHANGED
[000:40:19;550] LIVES, THIS WEEK A RETIRED
[000:40:22;052] CARPENTER DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO
[000:40:24;121] PLACE 58 WHITE CROSSES ON THE
[000:40:26;524] STRIP.
[000:40:26;824] ONE FOR EACH PERSON KILLED.
[000:40:27;992] HERE ONE WOMAN SITS NEAR THE
[000:40:29;560] CROSS FOR HER COUSIN,
[000:40:34;899] 20-YEAR-OLD BAILEY SCHWIETZER.
[000:40:37;601] THE NEWS OF LAS VEGAS IS NEXT.
[000:40:39;036] Prudential asked these couples:
[000:40:41;205] how much money do you
[000:40:41;205] think you'll need in retirement?
[000:40:44;041] Then we found out how many years
[000:40:44;041] that money would last them.
[000:40:47;111] How long do you
[000:40:47;111] think we'll keep --
[000:40:48;245] Oooooohhh! You stopped!
[000:40:49;246] You're gonna leave me
[000:40:49;246] back here at year 9?
[000:40:51;782] How did this happen?
[000:40:53;250] It turned out, a lot
[000:40:53;250] of people fell short,
[000:40:55;286] of even the average
[000:40:55;286] length of retirement.
[000:40:57;288] We have to think about
[000:40:57;288] not when we expect to live to,
[000:41:00;524] but when we could live to.
[000:41:01;959] Let's plan for income that lasts
[000:41:01;959] all our years in retirement.
[000:41:06;130] Prudential.
[000:41:06;130] Bring your challenges.
[000:41:12;069] (AVO)
[000:41:12;069] but you also have a higher risk
[000:41:12;069] of heart attack or stroke.
[000:41:14;738] Non-insulin Victoza®
[000:41:14;738] lowers A1C,
[000:41:18;042] and now reduces
[000:41:18;042] cardiovascular risk.
[000:41:20;811] Victoza® lowers my
[000:41:20;811] A1C and blood sugar
[000:41:23;747] better than
[000:41:23;747] the leading
[000:41:23;747] branded pill.
[000:41:25;483] (AVO)
[000:41:25;483] And for people with
[000:41:25;483] type 2 diabetes
[000:41:27;618] treating cardiovascular disease,
[000:41:27;618] Victoza® is NOW approved
[000:41:31;088] to lower the risk of major
[000:41:31;088] cardiovascular events
[000:41:33;757] such as heart attack,
[000:41:33;757] stroke, or death.
[000:41:35;693] And while it isn't
[000:41:35;693] for weight loss,
[000:41:37;928] Victoza® may
[000:41:37;928] help you lose some weight.
[000:41:40;231] (AVO)
[000:41:40;231] Victoza® is not for people with
[000:41:40;231] type 1 diabetes
[000:41:43;033] or diabetic ketoacidosis.
[000:41:44;768] Do not take Victoza® if you have
[000:41:44;768] a personal or family history
[000:41:47;671] of medullary thyroid cancer,
[000:41:49;440] Multiple Endocrine
[000:41:49;440] Neoplasia syndrome type 2,
[000:41:52;109] or if you are allergic
[000:41:52;109] to Victoza®
[000:41:53;777] or any of its ingredients.
[000:41:55;446] Stop taking Victoza® and get
[000:41:55;446] medical help right away
[000:41:57;948] if you get symptoms of a serious
[000:41:57;948] allergic reaction such as rash,
[000:42:01;418] swelling, difficulty breathing
[000:42:01;418] or swallowing.
[000:42:03;721] Serious side effects may happen,
[000:42:03;721] including pancreatitis.
[000:42:06;390] So, stop taking Victoza®
[000:42:06;390] and call your doctor right away
[000:42:08;959] if you have severe pain
[000:42:08;959] in your stomach area.
[000:42:11;395] Tell your doctor
[000:42:11;395] your medical history.
[000:42:13;397] Gallbladder problems have
[000:42:13;397] happened in some people.
[000:42:15;399] Tell your doctor right away
[000:42:15;399] if you get symptoms.
[000:42:17;735] Taking Victoza® with
[000:42:17;735] a sulfonylurea or insulin
[000:42:20;004] may cause low blood sugar.
[000:42:21;739] Common side effects are nausea,
[000:42:21;739] diarrhea, vomiting,
[000:42:24;375] decreased appetite,
[000:42:24;375] indigestion, and constipation.
[000:42:27;077] Side effects
[000:42:27;077] can lead to dehydration,
[000:42:28;979] which may cause kidney problems.
[000:42:30;481] Ask your doctor
[000:42:30;481] about Victoza®.

[000:44:10;514] THAT'S ACCORDING TO NBC NEWS.

[000:44:23;627] SOMEBODY ELSE DID ACCESS THAT

[000:44:29;199] THERE COULD BE A FEW

[000:44:31;935] BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW THE

[000:44:58;328] SO WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS,
[000:45:00;898] A PICTURE IS EMERGING OF STEPHEN

[000:45:05;769] LOSER, ALONER THAT WOULD GO TO
[000:45:10;107] PROSTITUTES.
[000:45:11;909] PROSTITUTES HAVE BEEN TALKING TO
[000:45:12;743] HIM AND HE WAS CHEAP AND NEVER
[000:45:14;278] SHOWED EMOTION WHILE HE WAS WITH
[000:45:15;646] THEM.
[000:45:16;447] IT APPEARS THE MYSTERY WOMAN
[000:45:18;248] THAT HE WAS SEEN WITH GAMBLING
[000:45:19;917] HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING WAS A
[000:45:23;420] HOOKER.
[000:45:25;689] HIS GIRLFRIEND SAID THAT HE
[000:45:26;990] GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT IN RECENT
[000:45:29;893] WEEKS AND BECAME OBSESSED WITH
[000:45:32;229] MARILOU DANLEY'S EX-HUSBAND.
[000:45:35;132] BUT SHE TOLD POLICE SHE HAD NO
[000:45:36;433] IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING MASS
[000:45:38;368] MURDER.
[000:45:39;136] THE CAR AT MANDALAY BAY HAD 50
[000:45:42;706] POUNDS OF TANNERITE AND
[000:45:44;541] AMMUNITION AND FERTILIZER.
[000:45:46;977] AND THERE'S NOW REPORTS THAT
[000:45:48;512] PADDOCK TRIED TO BUY TRACER
[000:45:52;049] AMMUNITION AT A PHOENIX GUN
[000:45:54;151] SHOW.
[000:45:54;451] HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE
[000:45:56;386] THE GUN DEALER WAS SOLD OUT BUT
[000:45:58;188] THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS
[000:45:59;857] RECORDING THAT HE HAD 1,000
[000:46:01;525] TRACER ROUNDS BUT DIDN'T USE
[000:46:02;993] THEM.
[000:46:03;727] TRACERS COULD HAVE MADE THIS
[000:46:04;828] SHOOTING MORE DEADLY, MORE
[000:46:06;463] ACCURATE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE
[000:46:08;065] BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE
[000:46:09;399] ROUNDS WERE GOING.
[000:46:11;101] THAT RAPID FIRE HAIL OF BULLETS
[000:46:16;940] LASTED TEN MINUTES.
[000:46:18;308] WE JUST INTERVIEWED AN OFF DUTY
[000:46:21;011] EMT THAT WAS AT THE CONCERT WITH
[000:46:24;014] HIS WIFE.
[000:46:25;849] HE USED HIS BELT AS A TOURNIQUET

[000:46:30;754] SEVERAL TO A TENT INCLUDING A
[000:46:32;256] WOMAN SHOT IN THE BACK.
[000:46:33;690] THE EMT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SIDE

[000:46:38;662] SAVED AT THE HOSPITAL.
