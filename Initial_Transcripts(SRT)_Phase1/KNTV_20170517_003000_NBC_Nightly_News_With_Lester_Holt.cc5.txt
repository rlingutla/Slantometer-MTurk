[000:01:27;854] ON THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:01:28;588] JUST A SHORT TIME AGO.
[000:01:29;789] POSSIBLE EVIDENCE THAT

[000:02:05;692] WROTE IN HIS OWN FILES
[000:02:06;459] IN FEBRUARY PRESIDENT
[000:02:07;227] TRUMP SUGGESTED COMEY
[000:02:07;994] SHOULD END ANY FBI
[000:02:08;728] INVESTIGATION OF
[000:02:09;462] WHETHER MICHAEL FLYNN
[000:02:10;263] LIED TO THE FBI WHEN
[000:02:11;064] HE DENIED MEETING WITH
[000:02:12;232] RUSSIA'S AMBASSADOR TO
[000:02:16;636] THE U.S.
[000:02:17;170] ACCORDING TO THE MEMO
[000:02:17;937] THE PRESIDENT MADE HIS
[000:02:18;705] COMMENT THE DAY AFTER
[000:02:19;472] FLYNN STEPPED DOWN AS
[000:02:20;273] NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:02:22;008] ADVISER.
[000:02:22;542] "I HOPE YOU CAN LET
[000:02:23;276] THIS GO," THE
[000:02:23;943] PRESIDENT SAID
[000:02:24;644] ACCORDING TO THE ME
[000:02:27;680] MEMO."
[000:02:28;181] HE IS A GOOD GUY."
[000:02:28;882] THE PRESIDENT TOLD
[000:02:29;649] LESTER HOLT LAST WEEK
[000:02:30;483] HE HAD HIGH REGARD FOR
[000:02:33;086] FLYNN.
[000:02:34;320] >> THIS MAN HAS SERVED
[000:02:35;088] FOR MANY YEARS.
[000:02:35;755] HE'S A GENERAL.
[000:02:37;991] HE'S, IN MY OPINION, A
[000:02:39;392] VERY GOOD PERSON.
[000:02:40;093] >> Reporter: THE WHITE
[000:02:40;860] HOUSE SAYS THIS
[000:02:41;528] ACCOUNT FIRST REPORTED
[000:02:42;295] BY "THE NEW YORK
[000:02:42;996] TIMES" AND CONFIRMED
[000:02:43;763] BY FORMER ASSOCIATES
[000:02:44;564] THE OF COMEY'S IS
[000:02:45;331] INCORRECT.
[000:02:47;500] QUOTE, THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:48;268] HAS NEVER ASKED MR.
[000:02:49;002] COMEY OR ANYONE ELSE
[000:02:49;769] TO END ANY
[000:02:51;304] INVESTIGATION A WHITE
[000:02:55;108] HOUSE OFFICIAL SAID IN
[000:02:55;875] A STATEMENT.
[000:02:56;476] THE WHITE HOUSE POINTS
[000:02:57;243] TO A STATEMENT MADE IN
[000:02:58;011] A SENATE HEARING BY
[000:02:58;745] THE ACTING FBI
[000:02:59;412] DIRECTOR.
[000:02:59;979] ASKED IF MR. COMEY'S
[000:03:02;015] FIRING AS FBI DIRECTOR
[000:03:02;782] HAD INTERFERED WITH
[000:03:03;550] ITS INVESTIGATIONS.
[000:03:06;286] >> THE WORK OF THE MEN
[000:03:07;053] AND WOMEN OF THE FBI
[000:03:09;455] CONTINUES DESPITE ANY
[000:03:11;291] CHANGES IN
[000:03:11;891] CIRCUMSTANCE, ANY
[000:03:12;625] DECISIONS.
[000:03:13;193] SO THERE HAS BEEN NO
[000:03:14;127] EFFORT TO IMPEDE OUR
[000:03:15;662] INVESTIGATION TO DATE.
[000:03:16;763] >> Reporter: FROM ALL
[000:03:17;764] INDICATIONS THE
[000:03:18;464] INVESTIGATION OF FLYNN
[000:03:21;301] HAS NEVER STOPPED HIS
[000:03:22;869] CONTACTS WITH THE
[000:03:24;037] RUSSIANS.
[000:03:24;604] A FEDERAL GRAND JURY
[000:03:25;405] HAS ISSUED SUBPOENAS
[000:03:29;209] IN THE CASE.
[000:03:29;809] NONE OF THIS COMES
[000:03:30;543] FROM MR. COMEY
[000:03:31;211] DIRECTLY.
[000:03:31;778] HE HAS YET TO SAY
[000:03:32;512] ANYTHING PUBLICLY
[000:03:33;246] SINCE HE WAS FIRED A
[000:03:34;047] WEEK AGO TONIGHT, BUT
[000:03:34;847] HE DID TELL FRIENDS
[000:03:37;951] AND A FEW PEOPLE AT
[000:03:38;718] THE FBI ABOUT WHAT HE
[000:03:39;485] WROTE IN THAT MEMO AT
[000:03:40;286] THE TIME, AND THEY'RE
[000:03:41;087] THE ONES DESCRIBING IT
[000:03:41;921] NOW.
[000:03:42;388] AND PEOPLE AT THE FBI
[000:03:43;456] STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT
[000:03:44;424] COMEY WAS FIRED
[000:03:45;225] BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T
[000:03:46;025] SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE
[000:03:47;460] RUSSIA INVESTIGATION,
[000:03:48;261] LESTER.
[000:03:48;795] >> PETE, I NKNOW YOU'VE
[000:03:53;366] BEEN TALKING TO LEGAL
[000:03:54;133] EXPERTS AND SOURCES.
[000:03:54;867] WHAT ARE THEY SAYING
[000:03:55;635] ABOUT POSSIBLE
[000:03:56;302] CRIMINAL ACTION HERE?
[000:03:57;070] >> WELL NOT
[000:03:57;704] SURPRISINGLY THEY SAY
[000:03:58;504] IT ALL DEPEND.
[000:03:59;172] FIRST IS TO TRY TO GET
[000:04:00;006] THE ACTUAL COMEY MEMO
[000:04:00;873] AND NOT RELY ON PEOPLE
[000:04:02;342] WHO CAN TELL US WHAT
[000:04:05;812] IT SAID TO SEE WHAT IT
[000:04:07;013] SAID, THEN PERHAPS
[000:04:07;747] TALK TO MR. COMEY.
[000:04:08;481] IT ALL COMES DOWN TO
[000:04:11;551] THE PERSON'S INTENT.
[000:04:12;285] WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:13;052] HAVE IN MIND.
[000:04:13;720] DID HE ACTUALLY INTEND
[000:04:16;256] TO TRY TO SHUT DOWN
[000:04:17;757] THE INVESTIGATION, OR
[000:04:18;558] WAS HE JUST SAYING HE
[000:04:19;325] HOPED IT WOULD END.
[000:04:20;059] >> PETE WILLIAMS
[000:04:20;793] TONIGHT STARTING US
[000:04:21;527] OFF.
[000:04:21;995] THANKS.
[000:04:22;528] WE WANT TO BRING IN
[000:04:23;263] OUR POLITICAL

[000:04:24;597] MODERATOR OF "MEET THE
[000:04:25;398] PRESS," CHUCK TODD.
[000:04:28;167] CHUCK, WHAT DO YOU
[000:04:28;901] MAKE OF ALL OF THIS?
[000:04:29;636] >> Reporter: LOOK,
[000:04:30;370] THIS IS A GUT CHECK
[000:04:31;137] MOMENT NOW FOR
[000:04:31;804] CONGRESSIONAL
[000:04:32;472] REPUBLICANS.
[000:04:33;072] THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN

[000:04:38;244] ACTIONS BY PRESIDENT
[000:04:39;746] TRUMP, YOU KNOW, JUST
[000:04:41;080] TODAY MANY REPUBLICANS
[000:04:42;315] WERE NOT WANTING TO
[000:04:44;117] SEE ANY CAMERAS
[000:04:45;818] RUNNING AROUND CAPITOL
[000:04:46;619] HILL, NOT WANTING TO
[000:04:47;587] COMMENT ON THE STORY
[000:04:48;988] YOU'RE ABOUT TO REPORT
[000:04:49;789] ON NEXT, WHICH IS THIS
[000:04:54;260] ISSUE OF THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:55;028] SHARING CLASSIFIED
[000:04:55;762] INFORMATION FOR THE
[000:04:56;496] RUSSIANS.
[000:04:57;063] THIS RAISES THE
[000:04:57;764] STAKES, THOUGH, TO A
[000:04:59;332] WHOLE NEW LEVEL.
[000:04:59;999] THIS BECOMES THIS
[000:05:00;733] INTRODUCES THE IDEA OF
[000:05:01;534] OBSTRUCTION OF
[000:05:02;235] JUSTICE.
[000:05:02;769] IF THERE'S A MEMO, NOW
[000:05:05;505] CONGRESSIONAL
[000:05:06;139] REPUBLICANS EVEN
[000:05:06;839] THOUGH IT'S THEIR OWN
[000:05:07;640] PARTY'S PRESIDENT,
[000:05:08;408] THEY'LL HAVE NO CHOICE
[000:05:09;242] BUT TO START ISSUING
[000:05:11;678] SUBPOENAS AND, BY THE
[000:05:12;512] WAY, THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:13;246] HIMSELF MADE THAT
[000:05:13;946] VEILED THREAT TO
[000:05:14;647] DIRECTOR COMEY, THEN
[000:05:15;448] FORMER DIRECTOR COMEY,
[000:05:18;584] SAYING HE'D BETTER
[000:05:19;319] HOPE THERE AREN'T
[000:05:20;019] TAPES.
[000:05:20;520] WELL, IF THE WHITE
[000:05:21;287] HOUSE'S VERSION OF
[000:05:22;055] EVENTS IS TO BE
[000:05:22;989] BELIEVED, THEN THE
[000:05:23;823] PRESIDENT BETTER HOPE
[000:05:25;892] HIS TAPES ABLE TO DO
[000:05:27;060] THAT BECAUSE THIS NOW
[000:05:28;628] BECOMES COMEY VERSUS
[000:05:29;862] THE PRESIDENT.
[000:05:30;596] AND I CAN TELL YOU
[000:05:33;800] THIS RIGHT NOW, COMEY
[000:05:34;567] PROBABLY HAS MORE
[000:05:35;301] CREDIBILITY ON CAPITOL
[000:05:36;069] HILL THAN THE
[000:05:36;736] PRESIDENT.
[000:05:37;303] >> ALL RIGHT, CHUCK

[000:05:47;347] DIPLOMATS.
[000:05:47;914] WAS THE INFORMATION
[000:05:49;782] CLASSIFIED?
[000:05:50;383] THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T
[000:05:51;184] SAY.
[000:05:51;651] HAD IT BEEN SHARED
[000:05:52;552] WITH OUR ALLIES BEFORE
[000:05:53;753] IT WAS GIVEN TO THE
[000:05:54;921] RUSSIANS?
[000:05:55;488] AGAIN, THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:56;255] WON'T SAY.

[000:06:02;595] WAS THE U.S.
[000:06:03;229] AUTHORIZED TO SHARE
[000:06:03;963] IT?
[000:06:04;430] SAME ANSWER.

[000:06:05;765] SOURCES ARE TELLING
[000:06:06;532] NBC NEWS IT CAME FROM
