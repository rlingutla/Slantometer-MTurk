[000:00:11;945] MORE NEWS NOW.
[000:00:12;412] HERE'S SHEP.

[000:00:16;483] WEST COAST, 3:00 IN PUERTO RICO
[000:00:18;018] WHERE HURRICANE MARIA HAS BEEN
[000:00:20;620] PUNISHING THAT ISLAND WITH
[000:00:22;022] POWERFUL WINDS.
[000:00:22;655] >> WE'VE BEEN SEEING STRONG
[000:00:24;758] WINDS WELL OVER 100 MILES FOR
[000:00:26;359] TWO HOURS HERE, STRONG ENOUGH TO
[000:00:27;927] CAUSE VISIBLE DESTRUCTION.
[000:00:30;930] WE'VE SEEN TREES SNAPPED, PARTS
[000:00:33;700] OF WELL-MADE STRUCTURES
[000:00:36;803] COLLAPSE.
[000:00:40;373] >> Shepard: AS STEVE CAN ATTEST,
[000:00:41;875] IT'S A CATASTROPHIC STORM.
[000:00:43;843] ONE OF THE STRONGEST TO EVER HIT
[000:00:45;578] AMERICAN SOIL AND THE
[000:00:46;980] DESTRUCTION COULD BE WIDESPREAD.
[000:00:48;648] WE'RE TRACKING THE HURRICANE.
[000:00:50;183] PLUS, IN MEXICO CITY, CRIES OF
[000:00:53;420] ANGUISH AT THE SITE OF A SCHOOL
[000:00:55;321] COLLAPSED IN THE EARTHQUAKE.
[000:00:56;122] PARENTS STILL WAITING TO FIND
[000:00:57;357] OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR KIDS.
[000:00:59;225] RESCUERS WORKING THROUGH THE
[000:01:00;660] NIGHT, SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS.
[000:01:03;329] WE'LL GO THERE LIVE.
[000:01:04;330] PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO MEET WITH
[000:01:06;166] THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER.
[000:01:07;200] THE LEADER OF OUR STRONGEST
[000:01:08;835] ALLY.
[000:01:09;135] WE'RE EXPECTING THAT IN THIS
[000:01:12;505] HOUR.
[000:01:12;806] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:21;981] WE'RE TRACKING TWO DEADLY
[000:01:23;817] NATURAL DISASTERS.
[000:01:25;118] THE DANGEROUS HURRICANE MAKING
[000:01:26;219] ITS WAY ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN AND
[000:01:27;954] THE EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO.
[000:01:30;523] WE'LL GO LIVE TO MEXICO CITY IN
[000:01:34;360] JUST A MOMENT.
[000:01:34;894] BUT HURRICANE MARIA HAS KILLED
[000:01:36;663] ANYBODY PEOPLE ACROSS THE
[000:01:39;466] CARIBBEAN.
[000:01:39;833] TODAY IT MADE LANDFALL AS ONE OF
[000:01:41;434] THE STRONGEST TO HIT PUERTO RICO
[000:01:44;337] AND ST. CROIX.
[000:01:46;072] PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR SAYS
[000:01:47;941] PUERTO RICANS HAVE NOT
[000:01:48;741] EXPERIENCED AN EVENT OF THIS
[000:01:51;377] MAGNITUDE IN THEIR MODERN
[000:01:53;546] HISTORY.
[000:01:54;848] HERE'S A LOOK AT THE STORM FROM
[000:01:56;783] SPACE AS THE CORE MOVES OVER
[000:01:58;318] PUERTO RICO.
[000:01:58;751] THE HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL AS A
[000:02:01;054] CATEGORY FOUR.
[000:02:01;521] THE STORM ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST
[000:02:03;456] OF THE ISLAND WITH SUSTAINED
[000:02:06;359] WINDS OF 155 MILES AN HOUR.
[000:02:11;831] THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
[000:02:13;299] WARNING OF LIFE THREATENING
[000:02:15;201] WINDS AND STORM SURGE AND RAIN
[000:02:17;604] OVER PUERTO RICO IN ST. CROIX
[000:02:19;472] TODAY.
[000:02:19;839] WATER LEVELS COULD RISE UP TO
[000:02:21;841] NINE FEET ON PUERTO RICO WITH
[000:02:24;477] LARGE AND DESTRUCTIVE WAVES.
[000:02:26;913] THE DANGEROUS WINDS ARE EXPECTED
[000:02:29;983] TO CONTINUE FOR 24 HOURS.
[000:02:35;555] PUERTO RICAN OFFICIALS SAY
[000:02:37;123] DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE
[000:02:38;224] TO BE REBUILD.
[000:02:40;793] THEY SAY THE STORM COULD
[000:02:45;598] "DECIMATE" THE ISLAND'S POWER
[000:02:48;635] COMPANY.
[000:02:49;035] IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ON PUERTO
[000:02:51;804] RICO'S NORTHERN COAST, THE MAYOR
[000:02:53;806] SAID FOUR OUT OF FIVE HOMES ARE
[000:02:56;342] DESTROYED.
[000:02:56;709] THE STORM HAS SNAPPED PALM
[000:02:58;912] TREES, PEELED OFF ROOFTOPS.
[000:03:02;482] PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL OF
[000:03:05;084] SAN JUAN ARE REPORTING
[000:03:06;119] WIDESPREAD FLOODING.
[000:03:07;820] SOME IN HIGH RISE APARTMENTS.
[000:03:10;523] ONE WOMAN THAT LIVES IN SAN JUAN
[000:03:13;159] TOLD THE "MIAMI HERALD" THAT HER
[000:03:14;561] HOUSE WAS TREMBLING.
[000:03:16;396] THE RAIN HORIZONTAL AND ALL THE
[000:03:18;565] TREES ON THE GROUND.
[000:03:19;432] SHE SAID THE WINDS ARE LIKE
[000:03:20;900] SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE.
[000:03:22;802] WE'RE ALSO GETTING A LOOK AT THE
[000:03:25;305] DEVASTATION ON THE SMALL ISLAND
[000:03:28;441] OF DOMINIC DiNATALE --
[000:03:36;049] DOMINIQUE.
[000:03:36;416] THE STORM HIT AND BLEW AWAY THE
[000:03:41;921] MAYOR'S ROOF.
[000:03:43;323] HERE'S A LOOK AT THE DAMAGE IN
[000:03:45;225] ST. CROIX, ONE OF THE U.S.
[000:03:48;061] VIRGIN ISLANDS.
[000:03:49;095] THE HURRICANE SIDE SWIPED THE
[000:03:52;632] ISLAND.
[000:03:53;066] KNOCKING OVER TREES, TOPPLING
[000:03:54;834] POWER LINES AND CAUSING SEVERE
[000:03:57;904] FLOODING.
[000:03:58;304] OFFICIALS IN ST. CROIX WARNED
[000:03:59;439] PEOPLE TO STAY AWAKE MOST OF THE
[000:04:01;341] NIGHT AND KEEP THEIR SHOES ON IN
[000:04:03;042] CASE THEY NEEDED TO RUN.
[000:04:05;645] FORECASTERS SAY HURRICANE FORCE
[000:04:06;646] WINDS EXTEND 60 MILES FROM THE
[000:04:08;781] EYE OF MARIA.
[000:04:09;716] THEY SAY THE CENTER OF THE STORM
[000:04:11;351] IS EXPECTED TO CROSS OVER THE
[000:04:13;586] COAST OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
[000:04:16;122] TONIGHT BEFORE MOVING TO THE
[000:04:18;024] TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE
[000:04:18;825] BAHAMAS.
[000:04:19;158] I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO STEVE
[000:04:21;461] HARRIGAN WHO IS LIVE IN SAN JUAN
[000:04:22;962] FOR US THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:04:25;131] STEVE, LOOKS LIKE THINGS HAVE
[000:04:26;266] CALMED DOWN.
[000:04:27;467] WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE NOW?
[000:04:29;936] >> SHEPARD, THE WIND HAS CALMED
[000:04:31;971] CONSIDERABLY, UNDER 50 MILES PER
[000:04:33;139] HOUR THAT MEANS THE POLICE AND
[000:04:34;707] FIRST RESPONDERS CAN GO OUT.
[000:04:37;410] EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK HERE, IT'S A
[000:04:39;012] WET MISS AND IT'S NOT GETTING
[000:04:40;947] BETTER SOON.
[000:04:41;581] WHERE I'M STANDING NOW, CHUNKS
[000:04:43;483] OF BUILDINGS, SATELLITE DISHES,
[000:04:46;352] BALCONIES, PIECES OF WALL, HOLES
[000:04:48;121] IN BUILDINGS.
[000:04:49;355] THAT WAS 145 MILES PER HOUR
[000:04:50;523] WINDS EARLIER THIS MORNING.
[000:04:52;292] WE JUST MOVED AROUND TO A
[000:04:54;827] NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:04:55;261] IF YOUR HOUSE IS MADE OF WOOD
[000:04:57;664] WITH A METAL ROOF, JUST GONE.
[000:04:59;899] SOME HOUSES WE SAW ON THE STREET
[000:05:03;002] GONE.
[000:05:03;303] TO MOVE AROUND HERE, IT'S
[000:05:05;038] STREAMLY DIFFICULT.
[000:05:05;905] IF YOU'RE AN AVERAGE CITIZEN IN
[000:05:07;707] PUERTO RICO RIGHT NOW, YOU MIGHT
[000:05:08;975] NOT HAVE A ROOF.
[000:05:10;209] YOU PROBABLY HAVE STRUCTURAL
[000:05:11;811] DAMAGE WHEREVER YOU LIVE AND YOU
[000:05:13;813] DEFINITELY DO NOT HAVE
[000:05:15;715] ELECTRICITY.
[000:05:16;115] A SITUATION THAT COULD LAST FOR
[000:05:17;283] WEEKS OR MONTHS, SHEPARD.
[000:05:18;718] >> GOING FORWARD, FLOODS AND
[000:05:22;288] MUDSLIDES.
[000:05:22;655] >> IT'S NOT OVER YET.
[000:05:24;057] THE WINDS WERE DRAMATIC AND
[000:05:27;126] POSSIBLY DEADLY.
[000:05:28;094] WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS YET.
[000:05:29;696] WE SAW POWER CREWS OUT ON FOOT
[000:05:32;165] BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.
[000:05:33;399] THERE'S SO MANY DOWNED POWER
[000:05:35;101] LINES AND DOWNED BRANCHES.
[000:05:36;969] THEY WERE WALKING TO TRY TO
[000:05:38;538] ASSESS THE DAMAGE.
[000:05:39;172] AS FAR AS THE MUDSLIDES GO,
[000:05:41;908] ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL
[000:05:43;142] MOUNTAINOUS PART OF THE COUNTRY
[000:05:44;377] THAT IS LIKELY WHEN YOU GET
[000:05:47;513] 10-15 INCHES OF RAIN.
[000:05:49;649] FEMA HAS PREPOSITIONED HERE.
[000:05:52;018] WE'LL SEARCH AND RESCUE AND A
[000:05:57;223] LOT OF RECOVERY.
[000:05:57;990] >> Shepard: THANKS, STEVE.
[000:05:59;726] LET'S GET TO RICK REICHMUTH IN
[000:06:02;028] THE EXTREME WEATHER CENTER, THIS
[000:06:03;429] IS AWFUL.
[000:06:03;796] >> A HORRIBLE FORM.
[000:06:05;198] MAKING LANDFALL 6:15 A.M.
[000:06:08;368] MAYBE A LITTLE BRIGHT NEWS,
[000:06:09;569] ANOTHER GOING OVER LAND DURING
[000:06:12;538] THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.
[000:06:15;775] ALMOST EVERY RECORD IN PUERTO
[000:06:17;910] RICO AT RECORD FLOOD STAGE.
[000:06:19;145] ALL OF THEM GOING UP INCREDIBLY
[000:06:21;781] FAST.
[000:06:23;349] UNFORTUNATELY, CUTTING A CROSS
[000:06:24;884] DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ISLAND.
[000:06:26;519] EVERYBODY FEELING THE IMPACTS OF
[000:06:28;755] THIS STORM, THIS IS THE FUTURE
[000:06:31;424] RADAR.
[000:06:31;724] THE RUSSIA ARE THE HURRICANE
[000:06:32;825] FORCE WINDS STAYING TO THE NORTH
[000:06:34;794] OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE IDEA OF
[000:06:36;496] THE D.R.
[000:06:38;131] HOPEFULLY TO THE EAST OF TURKS
[000:06:40;366] AND CAICOS THAT GOT DEVASTATED
[000:06:41;401] BY IRMA A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
[000:06:43;336] THEN IT CONTINUES TO PULL TO THE
[000:06:45;371] NORTH.
[000:06:46;906] MOST OF THE MODELS MAKE THIS
[000:06:50;476] NORTH WARD TURN HERE.
[000:06:51;477] THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE
[000:06:54;647] SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE U.S.
[000:06:55;882] WHICH WE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE A
[000:06:57;116] DISTRICT IMPACT, THIS IS
[000:06:58;985] FOLLOWING A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY
[000:07:00;486] AS TO WHAT THE HURRICANE JOSE
[000:07:01;587] HAS DONE.
[000:07:02;722] PULLING TO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND
[000:07:03;990] AROUND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST.
[000:07:05;558] WE'LL BE ADDING IMPACTS ACROSS
[000:07:08;661] PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY
[000:07:09;896] AND THURSDAY AS THE STORM PULLS
[000:07:11;364] OFF TO THE NORTH.
[000:07:12;665] THAT SAID, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT
[000:07:14;167] THE IMPACTS ARE.
[000:07:15;501] DO WE HAVE A DISTRICT HIT
[000:07:17;203] SOMEWHERE?
[000:07:17;570] MAYBE ON THE OUTER BANKS?
[000:07:19;505] IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
[000:07:21;607] SOMEWHERE FARTHER IN FROM NEW
[000:07:23;309] YORK CITY UP AROUND PARTS OF THE
[000:07:24;744] NORTHEAST, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT
[000:07:27;847] WE DO KNOW, ENVIRONMENTAL
[000:07:29;849] CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE
[000:07:32;185] FOR A STRONG HURRICANE.
[000:07:34;220] THE WATER TEMPERATURES COME DOWN
[000:07:37;089] AS WELL.
[000:07:39;292] ALL GUIDANCES HAVE A WEAKER
[000:07:41;360] STORM.
[000:07:41;661] BUT TUESDAY, A STORM OFF THE
[000:07:43;329] SHORE OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, SHEP.
[000:07:46;065] >> Shepard: WHAT A SEASON, RICK.
[000:07:47;733] CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH
[000:07:48;901] THIS THING?
[000:07:49;502] NO LIGHTS, NO WAY TO GET HELP,
[000:07:53;406] NO IDEA WHETHER YOUR HOME WILL
[000:07:54;907] STAND UP OR FALL DOWN AROUND
[000:07:56;676] YOU.
[000:07:57;009] WE'LL SPEAK WITH A WOMAN RIDING
[000:07:59;011] OUT THE STORM, HIDING IN HER
[000:08:01;481] CLOSET.
[000:08:01;814] THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX
[000:08:03;149] NEWS DECK ON THIS WEDNESDAY
[000:08:03;816] AFTERNOON.
[000:08:03;983] Ugh. Heartburn.
[000:08:12;425] Sorry Ma'am.
[000:08:12;425] No burning here.
[000:08:14;360] Try Alka-Seltzer
[000:08:15;361] Heartburn relief
[000:08:15;361] gummies.
[000:08:16;829] They don't taste
[000:08:16;829] chalky and work fast.
[000:08:18;631] MMMM. Incredible.
[000:08:20;099] Can I try?
[000:08:21;100] She doesn't
[000:08:21;100] have heartburn.
[000:08:22;268] Alka-Seltzer heartburn
[000:08:22;268] relief gummies.
[000:08:24;003] Enjoy the relief.

[000:10:47;980] >> Shepard: MORE ON HURRICANE
[000:10:50;049] MARIA AS IT BATTERS PUERTO RICO.
[000:10:51;951] OFFICIALS SAY THE EXTREMELY
[000:10:53;452] DANGEROUS STORM KNOCKED OUT
[000:10:55;354] POWER TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND.
[000:10:56;689] BLEW OUT WINDOWS IN SAN JUAN.
[000:10:58;958] LET'S TURN TO JENNIFER GONZALEZ
[000:11:02;094] COLON NOW.
[000:11:02;962] SHE'S PUERTO RICO'S RESIDENT
[000:11:06;465] COMMISSIONER.
[000:11:06;899] THE ISLAND'S REPRESENTATIVE IN
[000:11:08;267] CONGRESS AND RIDING OUT THE
[000:11:09;669] STORM IN A CLOSET EAST OF
[000:11:13;272] SAN JUAN.
[000:11:13;673] HOW ARE YOU?
[000:11:14;774] >> RIGHT NOW, I'M FINE.
[000:11:17;643] WAITING UNTIL THE WINDS GETS
[000:11:19;111] OVER THE ISLAND.
[000:11:19;845] WE ARE STILL HAVING WINDS MORE
[000:11:22;748] THAN 60 MILES PER HOUR.
[000:11:23;883] SO OFFICIALS ARE ASKING PEOPLE
[000:11:26;952] TO REMAIN AT THEIR HOMES BECAUSE
[000:11:28;654] IT'S NOT SAFE YET TO GET OUT OF
[000:11:30;589] THE HOUSES.
[000:11:32;124] THERE'S A LOT OF FLOODING IN
[000:11:35;428] MANY AREAS.
[000:11:36;696] WE RECEIVED BETWEEN 12 TO 35
[000:11:39;532] INCHES OF RAIN DURING THIS DAY.
[000:11:42;168] THE WINDS BEGAN AT 1:00 A.M. IN
[000:11:45;337] THE MORNING.
[000:11:46;605] WE'RE STILL HAVING THE SEVERE
[000:11:49;208] CONDITIONS AND SEVERE WINDS
[000:11:50;910] ACROSS THE ISLAND.
[000:11:51;744] ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IS THAT
[000:11:55;381] THE RIVERS OVERFLOWED THEIR
[000:11:59;452] BANKS.
[000:11:59;952] SO IT'S REALLY SCARY.
[000:12:02;021] WE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF
[000:12:04;390] HURRICANE BEFORE.
[000:12:05;124] OF COURSE, THE WHOLE ISLAND IS
[000:12:09;328] WITHOUT POWER.
[000:12:10;029] >> Shepard: HOW ARE YOU TALKING
[000:12:11;931] TO US?
[000:12:12;998] >> I HAVE EXTRA BATTERIES FOR MY
[000:12:18;370] CELL PHONE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
[000:12:21;307] WAY TO HAVE COMMUNICATION.
[000:12:24;410] ACTUALLY, A LOT OF COMMUNICATION
[000:12:26;312] TOWERS WENT DOWN AND ARE OFF
[000:12:27;813] LINE.
[000:12:28;114] A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE
[000:12:30;549] ISLAND DO NOT HAVE COMMUNICATION
[000:12:33;319] AT THIS TIME.
[000:12:33;753] SO THAT'S MAYBE THE REASON SOME
[000:12:37;990] PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE STATES
[000:12:39;225] ARE CALLING THEIR FAMILIES AND
[000:12:41;861] PEOPLE AND FRIENDS IN PUERTO
[000:12:42;962] RICO AND THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING,
[000:12:46;031] BECAUSE OF THAT.

[000:12:56;375] PUERTO RICANS, THERE'S SO MANY
[000:12:57;777] CONCERNED ABOUT THE AREA OUTSIDE
[000:12:58;944] OF THE CAPITOL.
[000:13:00;813] WHAT DO YOU KNOW FROM THE
[000:13:02;181] NEIGHBORHOODS?
[000:13:02;615] WERE PEOPLE EVACUATED
[000:13:04;416] EFFICIENTLY?
[000:13:04;817] >> YES, STILL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
[000:13:08;154] ARE STILL HERE BECAUSE OF THE
[000:13:11;157] FLOODING AND THE RIVERS OUT OF
[000:13:13;592] THEIR BANKS.
[000:13:14;627] THIS IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE
[000:13:17;463] RIGHT NOW.
[000:13:18;864] IT'S NOT SAFE TO GET OUT OF THE
[000:13:23;002] HOUSES.
[000:13:23;335] IN SAN JUAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE
[000:13:27;139] LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE AREAS
[000:13:32;278] HIT HARD.
[000:13:32;945] A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES
[000:13:34;647] BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WINDS.
[000:13:36;782] ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH WOODEN
[000:13:39;919] HOUSES.
[000:13:40;719] THOSE WOODEN HOUSES ARE ALMOST
[000:13:42;855] GONE IN MANY AREAS OF THE
[000:13:45;891] ISLAND.
[000:13:46;525] I'M SPEAKING WITH YOU.

[000:14:10;983] HOW CAN WE HELP?
[000:14:13;219] >> THE MOST URGENT NEED IS
[000:14:16;255] RESTORING THE POWER ON THE
[000:14:18;190] ISLAND.
[000:14:18;624] FOR THAT MATTER, I ASK DIRECTLY
[000:14:22;995] VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE LAST
[000:14:24;630] NIGHT.
[000:14:25;097] HE CALLED ME.
[000:14:25;931] I ASKED HIM DIRECTLY AND SOME
[000:14:29;134] OTHER CABINET MEMBERS TO SEND
[000:14:32;338] ELECTRIC TEAMS TO THE ISLAND TO
[000:14:33;639] HELP US RESTORE THE POWER GRID.

[000:14:46;819] PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR
[000:14:48;587] BELONGINGS.
[000:14:49;488] IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME
[000:14:54;493] TO RECOVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
[000:14:58;130] THE ISLAND.
[000:14:59;865] ROADS, BRIDGES AND MANY
[000:15:01;700] HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN HIT DIRECTLY

[000:15:06;272] ALSO IN THE HOTELS AND METRO

[000:15:15;180] EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE OF THIS
[000:15:18;217] MONSTER HURRICANE LEFT US HERE.
[000:15:20;452] >> Shepard: I KNOW THE GREATEST
[000:15:21;820] FEARS ARE FOR THE VERY YOUNG AND
[000:15:24;023] THE VERY OLD.
[000:15:25;991] IT'S A GOOD TIME TO REMEMBER
[000:15:27;326] THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS
[000:15:28;661] JUST LIKE ALL OF US.
[000:15:31;096] THEY DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND
[000:15:35;000] SALUTE THE SAME FLAG.
[000:15:36;001] I KNOW THIS NATION AND THE
[000:15:37;536] GENEROUS PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL
[000:15:38;837] RESPOND AS THEY ALWAYS DO.
[000:15:40;306] ALL THE BEST, CONGRESSWOMAN.
[000:15:41;740] WE'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU.
[000:15:44;476] >> THANK YOU.

[000:16:17;042] NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF
[000:16:20;946] HELP.
[000:16:21;246] I WANT TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT
[000:16:23;115] MIKE PENCE AND FEMA DIRECTOR FOR
[000:16:26;051] THEIR CALLS AND THEIR DILIGENCE.
[000:16:29;221] THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE ISLAND,
[000:16:30;723] FEMA, WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR,
[000:16:33;659] WORKING WITH THE TEAMS.
[000:16:34;693] WE MAY NEED A LOT OF HELP TO
[000:16:38;330] HELP THE ISLAND RECOVER.
[000:16:40;933] >> Shepard: WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO
[000:16:42;334] BROCK LONG IN JUST A MOMENT FROM

[000:21:24;466] STORM, PUERTO RICO HAD A
[000:21:25;968] CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND
[000:21:28;303] TENS OF BILLIONS IN DEBT.
[000:21:30;839] THIS WILL COMPOUND THE PROBLEMS.
[000:21:33;775] POWER LINES ALL OVER PUERTO

[000:21:43;151] NOW ALL OF PUERTO RICO IS
[000:21:44;052] WITHOUT POWER RIGHT NOW.
[000:21:46;188] THESE HURRICANES CAUSING MORE

[000:21:49;191] SPENT YEARS IN FINANCIAL CRISIS.
[000:21:50;692] TRACE GALLAGHER WITH THIS ONE
[000:21:52;227] FOR US.
[000:21:54;029] TRACE?
[000:21:54;329] >> SHEP, THE ECONOMY IS
[000:21:57;132] EXTREMELY DIRE.
[000:21:58;467] PUERTO RICO IS A PUERTO RICO --
[000:22:07;309] POOR ISLAND TO BEGIN WITH.
[000:22:09;344] THEY HAVE BILLIONS IN UNFUNDED
[000:22:12;647] PENSIONS TO TEACHERS AND
[000:22:14;383] GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.
[000:22:15;250] WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN
[000:22:17;753] ISLAND WITH FIVE MILLION PEOPLE,
[000:22:20;956] THAT IS ASTOUNDING.
[000:22:22;891] TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PUERTO

[000:22:25;994] THE ISLAND EACH YEAR FOR BETTER
[000:22:27;295] JOBS IN THE U.S.
[000:22:28;797] THE GOOD NEWS IS THE STATE OF
[000:22:31;333] EMERGENCY IN PUERTO RICO
[000:22:32;768] DECLARED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:22:34;169] COULD MEAN A LOT OF FEDERAL
[000:22:35;570] DOLLARS FLOWING INTO THE ISLAND,
[000:22:37;806] WHICH COULD BOOST THE ECONOMY AT
[000:22:40;275] LEAST TEMPORARILY.
[000:22:41;510] SHEP?
[000:22:41;810] >> Shepard: TRACE, THE STORMS
[000:22:44;112] HAVE SHOWN HOW BAD SOME OF
[000:22:48;250] PUERTO RICO'S INFRASTRUCTURE
[000:22:49;051] PROBLEMS ARE.
[000:22:49;518] >> RIGHT.
[000:22:49;918] WE TALK ABOUT THE ISLAND BEING
[000:22:51;353] WITHOUT POWER.
[000:22:53;221] 10% IS ALREADY WITHOUT POWER
[000:22:55;891] FOLLOWING HURRICANE IRMA WHICH
[000:22:56;792] DIDN'T HAVE A DIRECT HIT.
[000:22:57;959] THE NUMBER 1 CLIENT IS THE WATER
[000:23:00;228] COMPANY.
[000:23:00;562] SO NO POWER MEANS NO WATER, NO
[000:23:03;131] SEWER.
[000:23:03;465] UNLIKE HERE IN THE U.S., THE
[000:23:05;333] CELL PHONE PROVIDERS IN PUERTO
[000:23:06;835] RICO RELY SOLELY ON THE PUBLIC
[000:23:08;970] POWER GRID.
[000:23:09;771] SO COMMUNICATIONS ARE ALSO VERY
[000:23:11;673] LIMITED AND THE ISLAND'S POWER
[000:23:14;476] AUTHORITY IS MASSIVELY IN DEBT.
[000:23:16;178] SO TURNING THE LIGHTS BACK ON
[000:23:18;513] COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS.
[000:23:19;614] WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE,
[000:23:22;017] IT GETS WORSE.
[000:23:23;552] RETAINING WALLS AND BUILDINGS

[000:23:31;159] AND MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE

[000:30:30;078] WE'VE BEEN SHOWING YOU.
[000:30:31;946] ANOTHER IMAGE SHOWS FIRST
[000:30:34;182] RESPONDERS WORKING TO REMOVE A
[000:30:36;885] MASSIVE PILE OF DEBRIS.
[000:30:39;420] LOOK AT THAT PILE.
[000:30:40;188] JUST INCREDIBLE THE WORK THEY'RE
[000:30:41;956] DOING WITH SO MANY BUILDINGS
[000:30:43;825] DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, THIS
[000:30:45;426] FAMILY AND MANY OTHERS WERE
[000:30:47;962] PREPARING TO SLEEP ON THE
[000:30:50;465] STREETS LAST NIGHT AS THEY
[000:30:52;567] WAITED FOR AFTER SHOCKS.
[000:30:54;736] MANY RACED TO HELP RESCUERS.
[000:30:57;205] HERE'S A STREET CLOWN THAT
[000:30:59;007] SHOWED UP TO OFFER WHATEVER
[000:31:00;508] ASSISTANCE HE COULD.
[000:31:01;476] IN THIS INSTANCE, A WOMAN
[000:31:04;245] HOLDING UP A SIGN FOR SILENCE SO
[000:31:06;814] FIRST RESPONDERS CAN LISTEN FOR
[000:31:09;484] THOSE BURIED UNDER THE CONCRETE
[000:31:12;687] AND STEEL.
[000:31:13;755] THERESA MAY MEETING WITH
[000:31:16;624] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:31:17;091] LET'S LISTEN.

[000:31:29;170] WELL THROUGH RECENT TRADE
[000:31:31;039] NEGOTIATIONS.
[000:31:31;472] I HAVE TO SAY WE'LL BE DOING A
[000:31:33;508] LOT OF TRADING WITH THE UNITED
[000:31:35;577] KINGDOM.
[000:31:35;910] WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
[000:31:37;145] WE HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW EACH
[000:31:39;347] OTHER OVER THE LAST YEAR.
[000:31:40;515] IT'S A REAL HONOR TO HAVE YOU
[000:31:42;650] HERE.
[000:31:42;951] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:31:43;618] >> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
[000:31:45;520] GOOD TO BE HERE.
[000:31:46;654] AS YOU SAY, WE'VE HAD MANY
[000:31:50;124] DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN
[000:31:51;326] REPRESENTATIVES AND OURSELVES ON
[000:31:52;260] A WHOLE VARIETY OF ISSUES,
[000:31:54;729] INCLUDING TRADE WHICH THERE BE
[000:31:56;230] IMPORTANT FOR US AND OTHER
[000:31:57;565] ISSUES, FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES,
[000:31:59;467] SECURITY AND DEFENSE
[000:32:01;402] RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS THE
[000:32:03;504] CLOSEST THAT WE HAVE.
[000:32:05;139] GREAT THAT THAT CONTINUES.
[000:32:06;007] >> THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING
[000:32:09;344] HERE.
[000:32:09;644] >> THANK YOU.
[000:32:29;230] >> Shepard: PLEASANTRIES BUT NO
[000:32:33;568] QUESTIONS ANSWERED TODAY.
[000:32:35;303] LIVE PICTURES FROM MEXICO CITY
[000:32:36;404] WHERE STREET RESCUES ARE
[000:32:37;805] UNDERWAY, A SPLIT SCREEN HERE ON
[000:32:39;707] THE RIGHT.
[000:32:40;108] YOU CAN SEE THE STREETS OF THE
[000:32:41;509] CITY AND ON THE LEFT IS THE SPOT
[000:32:43;678] WHERE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR ANY
[000:32:45;647] POSSIBLE SURVIVORS FROM THE
[000:32:47;348] SCHOOL THAT COLLAPSED THERE.
[000:32:48;549] OUR CORRESPONDENT, JONATHAN HUNT
[000:32:50;385] IS IN MEXICO CITY NEAR A
[000:32:52;020] COLLAPSED BUILDING WHERE WE'RE
[000:32:53;788] HEARING THERE MAY BE PEOPLE
[000:32:54;889] TRAPPED THERE AS WELL, JONATHAN?
[000:32:56;557] >> YEAH, SHEP.
[000:32:58;426] WE JUST ARRIVED IN MEXICO CITY
[000:32:59;727] ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
[000:33:01;229] WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE
[000:33:02;997] COMMUNICATIONS.
[000:33:03;464] WE'RE GETTING YOU A PICTURE AT
[000:33:04;866] THIS POINT.
[000:33:05;333] LET ME PAINT THE PICTURE FOR
[000:33:07;468] YOU.
[000:33:08;870] I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF WHAT
[000:33:11;305] WAS A FIVE-STORY APARTMENT
[000:33:12;974] BUILDING.
[000:33:13;441] EACH STORY OF THE BUILDING
[000:33:16;010] PANCAKED DOWN ON TO EACH OTHER
[000:33:17;745] RIGHT NOW.
[000:33:18;279] SO IT NOW STANDS WHAT WOULD HAVE
[000:33:19;947] BEEN ABOUT TWO STORIES HIGH.
[000:33:23;818] ALTHOUGH FIVE CRUSHED INTO EACH
[000:33:25;887] OTHER.
[000:33:26;187] WE'RE TOLD THERE WAS LIKE 40
[000:33:28;990] APARTMENTS IN THAT BUILDING.
[000:33:32;360] RESCUERS ARE SWARMING AROUND IT
[000:33:34;529] RIGHT NOW TRYING TO FIND ANYBODY
[000:33:35;830] THAT STILL MAY BE ALIVE IN THE
[000:33:37;732] RUBBLE.
[000:33:38;066] THEY'VE BEEN BRINGING OUT A
[000:33:39;067] NUMBER OF BODIES TO THE BODIES
[000:33:41;569] OF TWO CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE
[000:33:43;171] BROUGHT OUT A SHORT TIME AGO.
[000:33:45;273] THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
[000:33:46;941] HERE.
[000:33:47;241] A LOT OF OFFICIAL REFUGEE
[000:33:49;010] WORKERS OBVIOUSLY.
[000:33:49;644] I HAVE TO SAY ONE OF THE
[000:33:51;546] STRIKING THINGS WHEN YOU ARRIVE
[000:33:52;747] IN MEXICO CITY IS THE NUMBER OF
[000:33:55;550] VOLUNTEERS, THE NUMBER OF
[000:33:56;851] ORDINARY MEXICAN CITIZENS
[000:33:58;720] RUSHING TO HELP.
[000:33:59;387] WE DROVE HERE FROM THE AIRPORT,
[000:34:02;123] SHEP, IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES.
[000:34:05;026] LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PICKUPS,
[000:34:07;328] MOTOR BIKES GETTING ALONG AS
[000:34:10;131] FAST AS THEY CAN.
[000:34:11;999] THOSE PICKUP TRUCKS OF MOTOR
[000:34:14;702] BIKES LOADED WITH PEOPLE JUST
[000:34:16;170] WANTING TO HELP.
[000:34:17;105] THEY'RE CARRYING SHOVELS,
[000:34:18;473] ANYTHING THAT MAY BE OF USE AS
[000:34:20;007] THEY TRY TO PERFORM THE RESCUES
[000:34:22;009] AROUND THIS CITY RIGHT NOW.
[000:34:23;077] WE'RE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF
[000:34:24;946] THE CITY, WHICH IS WARDS WHERE
[000:34:26;848] THE SCHOOL IS THAT YOU'RE
[000:34:28;015] TALKING ABOUT.
[000:34:28;883] THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE
[000:34:32;086] SCENES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY
[000:34:33;187] CHILDREN STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.
[000:34:35;723] THAT DIGGING WILL GO ON
[000:34:37;625] OBVIOUSLY UNTIL THEY HAVE
[000:34:39;427] ACCOUNTED FOR EVERYBODY WHO MAY
[000:34:40;828] HAVE BEEN IN THAT SCHOOL.
[000:34:41;863] THE SAME WITH THE BUILDING I'M
[000:34:44;031] STANDING IN FRONT OF RIGHT NOW.
[000:34:45;366] THE SAME WITH ALL OF THE 40 OR
[000:34:47;268] SO BUILDINGS THAT COLLAPSED HERE
[000:34:50;471] IN MEXICO CITY.
[000:34:55;777] PRESIDE
[000:34:56;811] THE PRESIDENT HAS DECLARED
[000:34:57;512] THREE DAYS OF MOURNING.
[000:34:58;713] IT'S RIGHT NOW A RESCUE
[000:35:02;283] OPERATION.
[000:35:02;650] THE FOCUS IS FINDING PEOPLE
[000:35:05;987] UNDER THIS RUBBLE WHO MAY STILL
[000:35:08;689] BE ALIVE.
[000:35:09;490] WE'RE TOLD, AS YOU LOOK AT THE
[000:35:11;592] PICTURES OF THE SCHOOL, THE
[000:35:13;227] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE
[000:35:14;529] SOUTHERN PART OF MEXICO CITY,
[000:35:17;365] THAT THEY FOUND ONE YOUNG GIRL
[000:35:19;333] ALIVE.
[000:35:19;634] THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST TO GET
[000:35:21;169] TO HER.
[000:35:22;970] OBVIOUSLY IT IS A VERY, VERY
[000:35:24;872] DIFFICULT OPERATION.
[000:35:26;174] A VERY DANGEROUS OPERATION.
[000:35:27;842] WHEN RESCUE WORKERS GO IN TO
[000:35:30;311] PERFORM THE OPERATIONS AS WE SAW
[000:35:31;913] A FEW YEARS AGO IN HAITI,
[000:35:33;748] THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT
[000:35:35;950] RISK.
[000:35:36;250] ONE WRONG MOVE, ONE WRONG PIECE
[000:35:38;653] OF CONCRETE OR ONE PIECE OF
[000:35:40;388] TIMBER MOVES AND MORE OF THE
[000:35:42;490] BUILDING CAN COME DOWN
[000:35:44;091] ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE
[000:35:45;326] RESCUE WORKERS.
[000:35:46;360] IT'S A TENSE, DIFFICULT
[000:35:48;296] OPERATION, SHEP.
[000:35:48;796] >> Shepard: JONATHAN HUNT IN
[000:35:50;498] MEXICO CITY.
[000:35:51;999] LIVE REPORTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
[000:35:56;370] BACK TO CONTINUING COVERAGE OF
[000:36:00;308] HURRICANE MARIA PUMMELLING
[000:36:01;442] PUERTO RICO AND ST. CROIX AND
[000:36:03;110] OTHERS.
[000:36:04;412] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW DEALING
[000:36:06;147] WITH ITS THIRD NATURAL DISASTER
[000:36:08;449] IN LESS THAN A MONTH.
[000:36:10;685] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPROVED AN
[000:36:12;854] EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR PUERTO
[000:36:13;855] RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.
[000:36:16;824] THE MONSTER STORM COULD COST
[000:36:18;092] BILLIONS IN DAMAGE ACROSS THE
[000:36:20;394] CARIBBEAN.
[000:36:20;761] THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DEVASTATION
[000:36:22;763] THAT HURRICANE IRMA HAS JUST
[000:36:24;432] LEFT BEHIND.
[000:36:25;066] LET'S GO TO BROCK LONG NOW FROM
[000:36:27;168] FEMA WHO BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:36:28;336] BY PHONE ON HURRICANE MARIA.
[000:36:30;671] SIR, NICE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
[000:36:31;973] HOW IS THE BRIEFING?
[000:36:34;442] >> THE PRESIDENT REMAINS VERY
[000:36:37;545] ENGAGED AND HIS MESSAGE IS TAKE
[000:36:41;649] CARE OF PEOPLE.
[000:36:42;250] THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
[000:36:43;484] WE KEPT 3,200 STAFF ON THE U.S.
[000:36:46;988] VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO.
[000:36:48;956] THAT IS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
[000:36:50;424] TEAMS TO MEDICAL TEAMS TO SEARCH
[000:36:52;760] AND RESCUE TEAMS.
[000:36:53;461] THEY'RE STARTING TO DEPLOY OUT
[000:36:55;630] AS THE STORM -- ELEMENTS OF THE
[000:36:57;531] STORM PASS THROUGH.
[000:36:58;332] AND THEN WE'RE PREPARED TO OPEN
[000:37:01;435] UP AIRPORTS AND THE SHIPPING
[000:37:04;972] PORTS TO CONTINUE WITH MORE
[000:37:05;706] TEAMS AND COMMODITIES COMING IN
[000:37:07;642] UP.
[000:37:07;909] >> Shepard: WHAT KIND OF REPORTS
[000:37:09;343] SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GETTING
[000:37:10;945] FROM THE TEAMS FANNING OUT?
[000:37:13;948] >> SO IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AS
[000:37:15;750] THE SYSTEM PASSED TO THE SOUTH
[000:37:17;251] OF THE ISLANDS LAST NIGHT, THE
[000:37:19;553] WINDS EXPANDED AND THEY
[000:37:20;788] BASICALLY -- THEY HAD UP TO
[000:37:23;391] ABOUT 137 MILES PER HOUR WINDS.
[000:37:25;493] SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOF
[000:37:27;228] DAMAGE.
[000:37:27;561] THEY DO HAVE DAMAGE TO THEIR
[000:37:28;930] CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
[000:37:29;764] THE POWER IS OFF.
[000:37:30;865] THEY EXPERIENCED SOME DAMAGE TO
[000:37:33;567] HOSPITALS, WHICH WERE ALREADY
[000:37:34;468] WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO
[000:37:36;971] ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS.
[000:37:40;775] PUERTO RICO UNFORTUNATELY,
[000:37:44;512] THEY'RE UNDER FLASH FLOOD
[000:37:47;248] WARNINGS IN THE COMMONWEALTH.
[000:37:49;617] THEY HAVE 100% OF THE POWER OFF.
[000:37:53;721] VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO
[000:37:54;689] HAVE FRAGILE POWER SYSTEMS.
[000:37:56;524] THE GOAL IS LIFE SAFETY, LIFE
[000:37:58;993] SUSTAINING MISSIONS BY GETTING
[000:38:02;163] COMMODITIES IN.
[000:38:02;830] FIRST TO PUSH OUT DEBRIS TO OPEN
[000:38:04;465] THE ROADS AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY
[000:38:07;368] POWER TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO
[000:38:08;669] GET IT BACK UP AND TRY TO
[000:38:11;472] RESTORE ROUTINE.
[000:38:12;273] >> Shepard: LOOKING ACROSS THE
[000:38:15;242] EXPAND OF ALL THAT YOUR
[000:38:16;310] DEPARTMENT IS DEALING WITH, IT'S
[000:38:19;146] HARD TO FATHOM HOW DIFFICULT IT
[000:38:21;749] MUST BE TO GET THROUGH THIS.
[000:38:23;651] YOU HAVE TO BE STRETCHED THIN
[000:38:26;554] RIGHT NOW.
[000:38:27;154] >> YEAH.
[000:38:28;255] I WOULDN'T SAY WE'RE STRETCHED
[000:38:29;724] THIN.
[000:38:30;024] THESE GUYS BACK HERE ARE
[000:38:31;892] INCREDIBLY DEDICATED.
[000:38:32;860] THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR 30 DAYS
[000:38:36;230] AT THIS POINT.
[000:38:37;131] WE'LL CONTINUE TO MEET THE
[000:38:40;001] DEMANDS.
[000:38:40;334] WE SIGNED UP FOR THIS JOB AND
[000:38:43;971] DEDICATED TO HELPING THE
[000:38:45;473] GOVERNORS ACHIEVE THEIR RESPONSE
[000:38:47;008] GOALS AND HELP PEOPLE.
[000:38:48;209] >> Shepard: FOR PEOPLE AT HOME
[000:38:49;610] SAYING I WANT TO HELP BUT NOT
[000:38:51;112] SURE HOW TO DO IT, WHAT DO YOU
[000:38:52;713] TELL THEM?
[000:38:53;247] >> RIGHT NOW THE BEST WAY IS TO
[000:38:56;550] GO TO NVOAD.ORG.
[000:39:01;088] THAT WILL GIVE YOU BASICALLY A
[000:39:03;224] WHOLE LIST OF OPTIONS TO
[000:39:05;693] VOLUNTEER AND DONATE.
[000:39:07;595] THEN ONCE WE WORK WITH THE
[000:39:09;997] GOVERNORS, THERE WILL BE OTHER
[000:39:12;133] OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT
[000:39:14;135] VOLUNTEER AND DONATIONS TO EACH
[000:39:15;836] ONE OF THE TERRITORIES.
[000:39:18;005] >> Shepard: WE'RE WITH YOU.
[000:39:19;640] CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.
[000:39:21;042] FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BROCK LONG.
[000:39:22;109] TALK TO YOU SOON.
[000:39:23;044] >> THANK YOU.
[000:39:23;711] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
[000:39:24;678] HE THINKS HE HAS A GOOD SHOT AT
[000:39:28;549] BROKERING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE
[000:39:30;351] EAST.
[000:39:30;651] THE PRESIDENT MET WITH THE
[000:39:33;454] PALESTINIAN LEADER TODAY.
[000:39:35;423] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE MADE UP
[000:39:36;590] HIS MIND ABOUT THE IRAN NUCLEAR
[000:39:38;793] DEAL ONE DAY AFTER CALLING IT AN
[000:39:41;662] EMBARRASSMENT.
[000:39:42;096] SO WHAT IS THE DECISION?
[000:39:44;765] BY THE WAY, THE IRANIAN
[000:39:46;233] PRESIDENT HAS SHOT BACK.
[000:39:46;867] THAT IS NEXT.
[000:39:48;002] I work
[000:39:48;002] overtime when
[000:39:48;002] I can get it.
[000:39:50;471] I need
[000:39:50;471] my blood sugar
[000:39:51;839] to stay
[000:39:51;839] in control.
[000:39:52;840] So I asked
[000:39:52;840] about Tresiba®.
[000:39:53;941] ♪ Tresiba® ready ♪
[000:39:56;210] Tresiba®
[000:39:56;210] is a once-daily,
[000:39:57;344] long-acting
[000:39:57;344] insulin
[000:39:58;579] that lasts even
[000:39:58;579] longer than
[000:39:58;579] 24 hours.
[000:40:00;915] I need to cut my A1C.
[000:40:02;683] ♪ Tresiba® ready ♪
[000:40:04;785] Tresiba® works
[000:40:04;785] like my body's insulin.
[000:40:06;720] Releases slow
[000:40:06;720] and steady.
[000:40:08;589] Providing
[000:40:08;589] powerful
[000:40:08;589] A1C reduction.
[000:40:11;192] My week?
[000:40:11;192] Hectic.
[000:40:12;760] My weekends?
[000:40:12;760] My time.
[000:40:14;662] ♪ Tresiba® ready ♪
[000:40:17;098] I can take Tresiba®
[000:40:17;098] any time of day.
[000:40:18;999] So if I sleep in,
[000:40:18;999] and delay my dose,
[000:40:20;901] I take it as soon as I can,
[000:40:22;403] as long as there's at least
[000:40:22;403] 8 hours between doses.
[000:40:25;072] Once in use,

[000:40:28;809] twice as long
[000:40:28;809] as the Lantus® Pen.
[000:40:30;578] (announcer)
[000:40:30;578] Tresiba® is used
[000:40:31;912] to control high blood sugar
[000:40:31;912] in adults with diabetes.
[000:40:33;581] Don't use Tresiba® to treat
[000:40:33;581] diabetic ketoacidosis,
[000:40:36;217] during
[000:40:36;217] episodes of low blood sugar,

[000:40:40;187] Don't share needles
[000:40:40;187] or insulin pens.
[000:40:41;856] Don't reuse needles.
[000:40:43;124] The most common side effect
[000:40:43;124] is low blood sugar,
[000:40:44;959] which may cause dizziness,
[000:40:44;959] sweating, confusion
[000:40:44;959] and headache.
[000:40:48;028] Check your blood sugar.
[000:40:49;463] Low blood sugar can be serious
[000:40:49;463] and may be life-threatening.
[000:40:51;332] Injection site reactions
[000:40:51;332] may occur.

[000:40:53;234] about all medicines you take
[000:40:55;002] and all your medical conditions.
[000:40:56;370] Taking TZDs with insulins
[000:40:56;370] like Tresiba®
[000:40:58;439] may cause serious side
[000:40:58;439] effects like heart failure.
[000:41:00;441] Your insulin dose shouldn't
[000:41:00;441] be changed
[000:41:01;842] without

[000:44:18;839] OPPORTUNITY.
[000:44:19;239] BUT SUCH UNFORTUNATE BEHAVIOR
[000:44:22;376] WILL NEVER IMPEDE IRAN'S COURSE
[000:44:25;412] OF PROGRESS AND ADVANCEMENT.
[000:44:27;614] >> Shepard: ROGUE NEWCOMERS TO

[000:44:31;685] OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:44:34;955] CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS IS
[000:44:37;257] HERE.
[000:44:37;725] THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.
[000:44:39;360] >> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

[000:44:53;374] THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF SIX
[000:44:59;079] SIGNATORS TO THE DEAL.
[000:45:00;414] IF YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER DEAL,
[000:45:02;015] IS THE PRESIDENT BETTER TO PULL
[000:45:06;653] OUT.
[000:45:06;954] AS A CANDIDATE, THE PRESIDENT
[000:45:08;956] SAID HE WAS GOING TO SCRAP THE
[000:45:10;257] DEAL.
[000:45:10;758] BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS
[000:45:12;259] RECERTIFIED THAT IRAN IS
[000:45:13;961] COMPLYING WITH THE DEAL AS
[000:45:15;696] ANOTHER DEADLINE COMES UP AS
[000:45:18;599] SOME ARE SAYING THE PRESIDENT
[000:45:20;367] WILL CONSIDER THE DECISION.
[000:45:23;504] THE WHITE HOUSE'S VIEW OF THE

[000:45:36;417] FOR TERROR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
[000:45:40;187] YESTERDAY HE SAID AT THE U.N.,
[000:45:42;489] THE IRANIAN RESPOND TODAY BY
[000:45:46;860] SAYING THE FOLLOWING.
[000:45:48;362] >> IGNORANT, ABSURD AND HATEFUL
[000:45:53;000] RHETORIC FILLED WITH
[000:45:55;836] RIDICULOUSLY BASELESS
[000:45:58;439] ALLEGATIONS.
[000:45:58;839] >> ABSURD HATEFUL RHETORIC.
[000:46:02;075] WE REPORT, YOU DECIDE.
[000:46:03;510] THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN SOME
[000:46:05;479] OTHER STEPS WITH REGARDS TO IRAN
[000:46:07;047] OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME WORK OF THE
[000:46:09;616] NUCLEAR AGREEMENT UNILATERALLY
[000:46:11;718] IMPOSED SANCTIONS.
[000:46:12;719] IF HE DECIDED TO STAY IN THE
[000:46:16;323] IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THE WHITE
[000:46:18;892] HOUSE COULD TAKE MORE STEPS TO
[000:46:25;199] REIGN IN IRAN'S BAD BEHAVIOR.
[000:46:26;533] GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
[000:46:27;734] >> AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THE
[000:46:30;938] MIDEAST PEACE DEAL.
[000:46:34;241] >> THE PRESIDENT MET WITH
[000:46:35;509] MAHMOUD ABBAS AND THE KING OF
[000:46:38;278] JORDAN.
[000:46:38;612] HE MET WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME
[000:46:40;681] MINISTER.
[000:46:41;048] THE PRESIDENT HAS A LOT INVESTED
[000:46:42;749] IN THIS.
[000:46:43;884] HIS SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER IS
[000:46:48;455] THE POINT PERSON ON THIS.
[000:46:49;823] THEY HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF
[000:46:51;358] VISITS TO THE REGION.
[000:46:52;960] WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY.
[000:46:54;862] THE PRESIDENT HOLDING OUT HOPE
[000:46:56;263] THAT SOMETHING MAY BE POSSIBLE.
[000:46:57;431] LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID THIS
[000:46:59;233] MORNING.
[000:46:59;600] >> WE'RE AT A VERY IMPORTANT
[000:47:02;069] JUNCTURE.
[000:47:02;436] A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE
[000:47:05;005] GOING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.
[000:47:06;707] SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT
[000:47:08;809] IT AND IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.
[000:47:10;777] WE'RE FIGHTING VERY HARD.
[000:47:11;845] >> HE'S OPTIMISTIC.
[000:47:13;447] SHOULD WE GO THROUGH THE LIST OF
[000:47:15;849] PRESIDENTS THAT WERE HOPEFUL AND
[000:47:17;951] CAME AWAY WITH NOTHING.
[000:47:19;753] >> Shepard: IT'S A LONG ONE.
[000:47:23;857] >> IT IS.
[000:47:25;893] >> Shepard: MICHAEL CROWLEY FROM
[000:47:30;797] POLITCO.
[000:47:31;231] GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL.
[000:47:32;799] >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, SHEP.
[000:47:35;502] >> Shepard: WHAT IS THE
[000:47:37;804] REPORTING WHERE WE ARE IN THIS.
[000:47:40;541] PULLING OUT HAS ENORMOUS
[000:47:42;709] CHALLENGES.
[000:47:43;110] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:47:43;577] SOME CRITICS OF THE DEAL, SOME
[000:47:46;914] THAT OPPOSED IT AT THE TIME THAT
[000:47:49;216] IT WAS SEALED WITH SEVERAL
[000:47:50;717] COUNTRIES AS JOHN POINTED OUT,
[000:47:52;319] EVEN SOME OPPONENTS OF DOING
[000:47:55;022] THAT NOW SAY IT'S TOO LATE.
[000:47:56;356] THE COST OF UNDOING THIS DEAL
[000:48:00;160] ARE MUCH GREATER THAN TO OPPOSED
[000:48:01;762] THE DEAL.
[000:48:02;663] IRAN GOT A LOT OF FINANCIAL
[000:48:04;197] BENEFITS.
[000:48:04;565] AS SOON AS THE DEAL WAS STRUCK
[000:48:06;099] IN JULY 2015, IRAN GOT BILLIONS
[000:48:08;936] OF IMMEDIATE PAY-OFF.
[000:48:10;737] THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CLAW THAT
[000:48:11;905] BACK.
[000:48:12;205] IN FACT, CIA DIRECTOR MIKE
[000:48:18;979] POMPEO SPOKE TO BRET BAIER.
[000:48:23;650] BRET SAID YOU WERE A STRONG
[000:48:25;886] CRITIC.
[000:48:26;286] AND POMPEO SAID THINGS LOOK
[000:48:27;521] DIFFERENT NOW BEING ON THE OTHER
[000:48:29;156] SIDE OF THE DESK AND THE
[000:48:31;558] ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED.
[000:48:32;526] THE DEAL IS SIGNED.
[000:48:33;760] IRAN GOT THE BENEFITS.
[000:48:34;928] THOSE THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE DEAL
[000:48:36;463] ARE CAUTIOUS ABOUT BLOWING IT UP
[000:48:39;466] RIGHT NOW.
[000:48:39;866] >> Shepard: WILL THERE REAL
[000:48:41;201] INDICATORS THAT THEY'RE CHEATING
[000:48:42;669] OR IS THE CONSENSUS THAT THINGS
[000:48:44;471] ARE GOING AS WELL AS COULD BE
[000:48:47;441] EXPECTED?
[000:48:48;175] >> YOU KNOW, I GUESS WHAT YOUR
[000:48:49;943] DEFINITION OF CHEATING IS.
[000:48:51;345] THE INTERNATIONAL A COMIC ENERGY
[000:48:53;347] AGENCY INSPECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN
[000:48:55;315] GOING TO IRAN AND HAVE THIS VERY
[000:48:58;218] SPECIFIC CHECKLIST OF TECHNICAL
[000:49:00;621] METRICS SAY THAT IRAN IS NOT
[000:49:02;556] CHEATING.
[000:49:02;923] THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE.
[000:49:05;559] THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT IRAN GOT
[000:49:07;094] A LITTLE ABOVE THE AMOUNT OF
[000:49:08;762] HEAVY WATER THEY WERE SUPPOSED
[000:49:10;297] TO HAVE ON HAND.
[000:49:11;932] IF YOU TALK THE PEOPLE THAT
[000:49:13;500] ARE -- FOLLOW THIS CLOSELY, THEY
[000:49:15;435] SAY IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.
[000:49:18;038] THE IAEA SAYS THEY'RE IN
[000:49:20;474] COMPLIANCE.
[000:49:20;874] THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TRUMP
[000:49:22;676] ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS,
[000:49:24;311] CONSERVATIVE, ISRAELI OFFICIALS
[000:49:25;545] SAY IT'S THE WRONG WAY TO THINK
[000:49:27;080] ABOUT IT.
[000:49:27;547] THAT IT'S BROADER THAN THIS.
[000:49:30;183] IRANIAN BEHAVIOR YOU HAVE TO
[000:49:31;818] LOOK AT.
[000:49:32;352] ARE THEY BECOMING MORE OF A
[000:49:34;721] CIVILIZED NATION THAT OBEYS THE
[000:49:36;657] SORT OF RULES OF THE ROAD
[000:49:38;925] INTERNATIONALLY.
[000:49:39;393] THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.
[000:49:41;561] THE DEAL SORT OF OBLIGATED IRAN
[000:49:43;497] TO BEHAVE BETTER IN THEIR
[000:49:45;265] NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEREFORE
[000:49:46;800] THEY'RE NOT HONORING WHAT SOME
[000:49:48;735] TRUMP OFFICIALS HAVE CALLED THE
[000:49:49;936] SPIRIT OF THE DEAL.
[000:49:51;972] THE FRIENDS THAT SERVED UNDER
[000:49:53;974] PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE DEAL
[000:49:55;542] HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRANIAN
[000:49:58;311] BEHAVIOR, THE METRICS, THE
[000:50:01;148] RESEARCH, THE URANIUM ON HAND.
[000:50:03;116] THAT'S THE OPINION RIGHT NOW.
[000:50:05;686] >> MICHAEL CROWLEY FORE POLITCO.

[000:55:05;969] ALASKA'S LISA MURKOWSKI.
[000:55:09;005] >> THE INITIAL ANALYSIS ON THE
[000:55:11;408] IMPACT OF THE STATE OF MAINE OF
[000:55:14;311] THEIR BILL IS THAT IT WOULD
[000:55:16;146] RESULT TO MAINE RECEIVING A
[000:55:19;149] BILLION DOLLARS LESS IN FEDERAL
[000:55:21;284] FUNDING FOR HEALTHCARE OVER THE
[000:55:22;886] NEXT DECADE.
[000:55:24;454] >> MEETINGS CONTINUE ON CAPITOL

[000:55:28;124] CONCERNS OF GOP SENATORS
[000:55:30;460] SCHLEPP?
[000:55:30;794] >> Shepard: THERE WAS A
[000:55:31;928] BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO TRY TO
[000:55:33;730] IMPROVE OBAMACARE.
[000:55:34;431] WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?
[000:55:35;332] >> IT FELL APART LAST NIGHT.
[000:55:37;400] YOU HAD SENATOR LAMAR ALEXANDER
[000:55:40;570] AND PATTY MURRAY TRYING TO WORK
[000:55:42;138] ON A BIPARTISAN FIX BY THE END
[000:55:43;606] OF THE MONTH.
[000:55:44;708] TOP DEMOCRATS ARE EXPRESSING
[000:55:46;710] DISAPPOINTMENT.
[000:55:47;177] >> IT'S UNFORTUNATE.
[000:55:48;511] WE HAD A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING
[000:55:51;114] IMPORTANT, HISTORIC, BIPARTISAN
[000:55:52;048] THAT WOULD HAVE BUILT ON THE
[000:55:53;850] HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE
[000:55:54;784] IN THIS COUNTRY.
[000:55:56;252] NOW WE'RE MOVING TO ANOTHER
[000:55:58;088] PARTISAN APPROACH.
[000:55:58;722] NO CBO SCORE, NO HEARINGS.
[000:56:01;257] GETTING READY TO REPEAT WHAT WE

[000:56:11;701] >> ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE
[000:56:15;105] WITHOUT ANY ECONOMIC OR
[000:56:17;807] ACTIONARY OR PLAIN COMMON SENSE
[000:56:22;212] RATIONALE.
[000:56:22;912] IT FRUSTRATES.
[000:56:24;314] IT'S CERTAINLY FRUSTRATING TO
[000:56:26;182] HAVE TO MOBILIZE EVERY COUPLE
[000:56:27;584] MONTHS TO KEEP OUR LEADERS FROM
[000:56:30;687] INFLICTING REAL HUMAN SUFFERING
[000:56:31;688] ON OUR CONSTITUENTS.
[000:56:32;822] >> IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR IF
[000:56:34;891] REPUBLICANS WILL GET TO 50 YES
[000:56:37;894] VOTES, SHEP.
[000:56:38;328] >> Shepard: MIKE EMANUEL AT THE
[000:56:39;329] ROTUNDA ON THE HILL.

[000:57:58;274] If yand constipation,ling
[000:57:58;274] and you're overwhelmed
[000:57:59;476] by everything you've tried--
[000:58:01;044] all those laxatives,
[000:58:01;044] daily probiotics,
[000:58:04;113] endless fiber--
[000:58:04;113] it could be wearing on you.
[000:58:07;116] Tell your doctor
[000:58:07;116] what you've tried,
[000:58:08;618] and how long you've been at it.
[000:58:09;919] LINZESS works differently
[000:58:09;919] from laxatives.
[000:58:12;422] LINZESS treats adults
[000:58:12;422] with IBS
[000:58:14;257] with Constipation
[000:58:14;257] or Chronic Constipation.
[000:58:18;695] It can help relieve
[000:58:18;695] your belly pain
[000:58:21;364] and lets you have more frequent
[000:58:21;364] and complete bowel movements
[000:58:24;033] that are easier to pass.
[000:58:27;303] Do not give LINZESS
[000:58:27;303] to children less than six
[000:58:29;639] and it should not be given
[000:58:29;639] to children
[000:58:30;974] six to less than eighteen.
[000:58:30;974] It may harm them.
[000:58:33;209] Don't take LINZESS
[000:58:33;209] if you have a bowel blockage.
[000:58:35;879] Get immediate help
[000:58:35;879] if you develop
[000:58:37;447] unusual or severe
[000:58:37;447] stomach pain,
[000:58:39;382] especially with
[000:58:39;382] bloody or black stools.
[000:58:41;417] The most common side effect
[000:58:41;417] is diarrhea, sometimes severe.
[000:58:44;587] If it's severe,
[000:58:44;587] stop taking LINZESS
[000:58:46;756] and call your doctor
[000:58:46;756] right away.
[000:58:48;424] Other side effects
[000:58:48;424] include gas,
[000:58:49;926] stomach-area pain
[000:58:49;926] and swelling.
[000:58:51;594] Talk to your doctor about
[000:58:53;096] managing your symptoms
[000:58:54;264] proactively with LINZESS.
