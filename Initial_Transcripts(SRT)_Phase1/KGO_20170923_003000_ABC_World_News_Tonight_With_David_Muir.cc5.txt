[000:10:45;678] BUT DETONATING A NUCLEAR BOMB
[000:10:47;780] OVER THE PACIFIC WOULD BE KIM'S
[000:10:49;849] MOST PROVOCATIVE MOVE YET.

[000:10:55;054] NUCLEAR WEAPON IS GOING TO HAVE
[000:10:55;688] A LOT OF RADIATION.

[000:19:38;777] It helps block 6 key
[000:19:38;777] inflammatory substances
[000:19:41;313] that cause symptoms.
[000:19:42;281] Pills block one
[000:19:43;282] and 6 is greater than 1.
[000:19:44;616] Flonase changes

[000:19:54;493] When a critical patient is far

[000:20:12;945] That's the power of and.
[000:20:18;350] my doctor recommended I
[000:20:18;350] switch laxatives.
[000:20:20;385] Stimulant Laxatives
[000:20:20;385] make your body go
[000:20:22;087] by forcefully stimulating the
[000:20:22;087] nerves in your colon.
[000:20:24;690] MiraLAX is different.
[000:20:25;757] It works with the
[000:20:25;757] water in your body
[000:20:27;125] to hydrate and soften.
[000:20:28;427] Unblocking your

[000:20:42;874] Guard your Card?
[000:20:44;543] Just like your credit card.
[000:20:45;944] Nobody gets my number, unless I
[000:20:45;944] know they should have it.

[000:21:04;596] I even accept I have a
[000:21:04;596] higher risk of stroke
[000:21:04;596] as far as I used to.
[000:21:06;632] due to AFib,
[000:21:07;633] a type of
[000:21:07;633] irregular heartbeat
[000:21:08;634] not caused by a
[000:21:08;634] heart valve problem.
[000:21:10;636] But no matter
[000:21:10;636] where I ride,
[000:21:12;304] I go for my best.
[000:21:13;639] So if there's something
[000:21:13;639] better than warfarin,
[000:21:15;641] I'll go for that too.
[000:21:16;742] ELIQUIS.
[000:21:18;277] ELIQUIS reduced
[000:21:18;277] the risk of stroke
[000:21:20;279] better than warfarin,
[000:21:21;613] plus had less
[000:21:21;613] major bleeding
[000:21:22;948] than warfarin.
[000:21:24;149] ELIQUIS had both.
[000:21:25;651] Don't stop taking ELIQUIS
[000:21:26;785] unless your doctor
[000:21:26;785] tells you to,
[000:21:28;320] as stopping increases your
[000:21:28;320] risk of having a stroke.
[000:21:30;656] ELIQUIS can cause serious and
[000:21:30;656] in rare cases fatal bleeding.
[000:21:34;326] Don't take ELIQUIS if you
[000:21:34;326] have an artificial heart valve
[000:21:36;995] or abnormal bleeding.
[000:21:38;330] While taking ELIQUIS,
[000:21:39;298] you may bruise more easily...
[000:21:40;666] ...and it may take
[000:21:40;666] longer than usual
[000:21:42;000] for any bleeding to stop.
[000:21:43;669] Seek immediate
[000:21:43;669] medical care
[000:21:44;836] for sudden signs
[000:21:44;836] of bleeding,
[000:21:46;171] like unusual bruising.
[000:21:47;639] ELIQUIS may increase
[000:21:47;639] your bleeding risk
[000:21:49;274] if you take
[000:21:49;274] certain medicines.
[000:21:50;842] Tell your doctor about
[000:21:51;943] all planned medical
[000:21:51;943] or dental procedures.
[000:21:54;146] I'm still going
[000:21:54;146] for my best.
[000:21:56;315] And for ELIQUIS.
