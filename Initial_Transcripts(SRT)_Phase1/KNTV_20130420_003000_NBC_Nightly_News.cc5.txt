[000:00:00;400] I DON'T SEE SMOKE AND I DON'T
[000:00:02;102] SMELL SMOKE.
[000:00:02;535] >> ONE MORE THING.
[000:00:03;937] HOW DID THEY COME AT THE HOUSE?
[000:00:09;843] ARE MOST OF THE VEHICLES IN THE
[000:00:11;878] DRIVEWAY OR DID THEY COME AT IT
[000:00:13;480] THROUGH A BACK WAY?
[000:00:21;021] >> THIS WHOLE AREA IS FIVE
[000:00:23;089] STREETS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:00:24;424] THEY WENT DOWN EVERY SIDE
[000:00:27;994] STREET.
[000:00:28;328] THERE ARE FLASHING LIGHTS AT
[000:00:29;863] EVERY END AND OFFICERS WITH
[000:00:32;465] RIFLES BY THEIR SIDES AT EVERY
[000:00:33;266] SINGLE END.
[000:00:38;838] >> ALL RIGHT.
[000:00:39;906] >> THERE IS A PARADE OF TRAFFIC
[000:00:41;975] HAPPENING NOW.
[000:00:42;542] A BUNCH OF LIGHTS FLASHING GOING
[000:00:44;677] UP MY STREET TOWARD FRANKLIN.
[000:00:46;546] THERE ARE FIVE CARS HEADED UP.
[000:00:50;683] >> OKAY.
[000:00:51;017] YEAH.
[000:00:51;351] WE JUST SAW KIND OF A SECOND
[000:00:53;186] WAVE OF SUVs, POLICE CARS
[000:00:56;056] ARRIVE.
[000:00:56;389] THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT.
[000:00:57;624] IT'S GETTING TOUGHER BECAUSE THE
[000:01:00;160] CAMERA LENS IS OVERWHELMED BY
[000:01:02;262] THE STROBES.
[000:01:03;730] IT'S HARD FOR US TO SEE, PICK
[000:01:07;033] OUT INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENT EXCEPT
[000:01:08;668] THAT VEHICLES KEEP COMING AND
[000:01:11;704] GOING.
[000:01:12;105] I'M NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR OF
[000:01:14;040] MORE OF THEM COMING DOWN WHERE
[000:01:18;411] YOU ARE.
[000:01:19;079] I COULD BE CONVINCED THAT WE
[000:01:20;447] HAVE SEEN MORE ACTIVITY.
[000:01:22;916] A LIGHT TRUCK JUST ARRIVED IN
[000:01:25;452] THE FOREGROUND THERE ON THE
[000:01:26;119] RIGHT.
[000:01:29;923] THOSE ARE ERECTABLE SPOTLIGHTS
[000:01:31;958] THEY CAN PUT UP.
[000:01:33;593] ONCE THE SCENE IS COLD, LET'S
[000:01:36;062] SAY THE SUSPECT WAS TAKEN OUT OF
[000:01:38;431] THERE.
[000:01:38;731] THEY WOULD STILL WANT TO GET AT
[000:01:40;266] THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION
[000:01:41;568] TONIGHT, SEE WHAT THEY ARE
[000:01:42;235] DEALING WITH.
[000:01:44;671] EVEN THOUGH, AS KERRY AND I AND
[000:01:46;840] PETE WILLIAMS AND I HAVE BEEN
[000:01:48;708] THEORIZING IT'S LIKELY, KNOWING
[000:01:50;977] HOW THESE GUYS WORK, THEY WILL
[000:01:55;648] NOT USE LIGHT FOR THE TAKEDOWN
[000:02:00;186] ITSELF.
[000:02:00;520] YOU SEE AN FBI AGENT GETTING OUT
[000:02:01;521] OF THE LATEST CAR TO ARRIVE.
[000:02:06;593] THIS FLASH-BANG TECHNOLOGY, IF
[000:02:08;094] THAT EXPLAINS POPS PEOPLE HEARD
[000:02:10;430] OTHER THAN GUNFIRE, THEY ARE A
[000:02:14;334] BRIEFLY DEVASTATING WEAPON THAT
[000:02:17;337] CAN JUST TAKE HOLD OF YOUR
[000:02:21;040] SENSES AND LEAVE THE SUSPECT
[000:02:24;377] BLINDED AND DEAFENED MOMENTARILY
[000:02:26;546] WHILE PEOPLE MOVE IN.
[000:02:33;019] CLOSED SPACE.
[000:02:33;887] I HAVE SEEN THEM USED OUTDOORS
[000:02:35;355] IN A COURTYARD, A WARTIME
[000:02:37;524] BACKDROP IN AFGHANISTAN.
[000:02:38;258] THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.
[000:02:43;429] JUST TOLD WE HAVE ANOTHER GUEST.
[000:02:46;533] CLINT VAN ZANT, FBI VETERAN
[000:02:49;402] PROFILER.
[000:02:49;769] WHAT CAN YOU ADD, CLINT?
[000:02:51;004] >> WELL, AS YOU KNOW MY
[000:02:53;806] BACKGROUND IS AS A HOSTAGE
[000:02:55;808] NEGOTIATOR.
[000:02:56;209] HAVING BEEN IN SIMILAR
[000:02:57;243] SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WORKING
[000:02:58;511] WITH TACTICAL TEAMS, THIS IS A
[000:03:01;648] HAND IN GLOVE OPERATION.
[000:03:02;949] THE NEGOTIATOR IS ON THE SCENE.
[000:03:04;984] HE OR SHE WILL BE WORKING HARD
[000:03:07;654] TO EXTEND A HAND AND ALLOWS THIS
[000:03:12;559] INDIVIDUAL TO COME OUT.
[000:03:16;829] WITH THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE
[000:03:18;598] DEVICE OF SOMETHING INSIDE THE
[000:03:19;999] BEST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE FOR
[000:03:21;134] THE NEGOTIATOR TO GET THE
[000:03:23;269] SUBJECT TO COME OVER THE SIDE OF
[000:03:24;871] THE BOAT, CROP TO THE GROUND SO
[000:03:26;472] THAT THE TACTICAL TEAM.
[000:03:30;843] ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
[000:03:32;478] THEN THEY CAN CLOSE, MAKE THE
[000:03:34;847] ARREST AND THEN ADMINISTER FIRST
[000:03:36;449] AID.
[000:03:36;749] IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK LIKE
[000:03:39;118] THAT.
[000:03:39;419] THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ENDANGER A
[000:03:41;754] POLICE OFFICER OR AGENT IN THE
[000:03:43;456] ARREST AND HAVE THIS GUY TRY TO
[000:03:45;191] BLOW HIMSELF UP AT THE LAST
[000:03:48;027] SECOND.
[000:03:48;361] >> WE HAVE BEEN CIRCUMSPECT
[000:03:49;295] BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH
[000:03:53;132] REPORTED WRONG OVER THE PAST
[000:03:54;434] COUPLE OF DAYS ABOUT PASSING
[000:03:57;237] THINGS ALONG.
[000:03:58;771] THIS DOES MAKE SENSE THOUGH.
[000:04:00;807] BOSTON GLOBE IS TWEETING OUT
[000:04:02;375] THAT ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS IS
[000:04:04;277] IN CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO
[000:04:07;080] HEAR COPS SAY, YOU KNOW, THE
[000:04:09;983] CLASSIC MOVIE LINE "COME OUT ON
[000:04:11;618] YOUR OWN TERMS, COME OUT WITH
[000:04:13;620] YOUR HANDS UP."
[000:04:15;588] IT WOULD INDICATE -- THE
[000:04:16;889] SURPRISE HERE -- IT WOULD
[000:04:18;057] INDICATE THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE,
[000:04:20;159] ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND ABLE TO
[000:04:22;829] MOVE.
[000:04:23;930] CLINT, AFTER TWO VOLLEYS OF
[000:04:27;834] GUNFIRE AND WELL OUTNUMBERED
[000:04:29;235] IT'S SURPRISING TO A LOT OF US.
[000:04:33;339] >> HE WAS PROBABLY WOUNDED LAST
[000:04:34;340] NIGHT IN THE EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE
[000:04:36;709] IN WHICH HIS BROTHER WAS KILLED.
[000:04:39;479] HE WAS PROBABLY SHOT AT THAT
[000:04:40;613] TIME.
[000:04:40;913] THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE BLOOD THAT
[000:04:43;449] MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE SCENE
[000:04:44;617] WHEN HE GOT ON TO THE BOAT OR
[000:04:46;786] SUBSEQUENT TO THAT.
[000:04:50;156] AS WE HEARD THE VOLLEY OF
[000:04:52;292] GUNFIRE IT SOUNDED LIKE AT LEAST
[000:04:55;895] ONE IF NOT TWO 30-ROUND
[000:04:59;699] MAGAZINES FROM THE TACTICAL
[000:05:00;366] OFFICER'S WEAPON.
[000:05:04;837] IF THEY SHOT RIGHT AT THE BOAT
[000:05:06;506] IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED THE
[000:05:07;840] BOAT INTO SWISS CHEESE.
[000:05:10;476] REALIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT, I'M
[000:05:12;111] SURE AS A GROUP HAS AN
[000:05:14;614] UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD
[000:05:15;515] LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN
[000:05:18;084] LIKE IN ANY OTHER SITUATION.
[000:05:19;719] THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS
[000:05:21;688] INDIVIDUAL EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO
[000:05:23;589] SURRENDER.
[000:05:23;990] WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.
[000:05:25;825] HE HAS INFORMATION WE NEED.
[000:05:27;493] BUT THERE ARE RULES OF
[000:05:29;996] ENGAGEMENT THAT WILL SUGGEST IF
[000:05:30;863] YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER, THE LIFE
[000:05:33;266] OF SOMEBODY ELSE DO WHAT YOU
[000:05:34;200] HAVE TO DO.
[000:05:34;934] TRY TO TAKE HIM ALIVE.
[000:05:36;969] DON'T PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE
[000:05:38;104] TO DO IT.
[000:05:39;138] >> BOSTON P.D. CAR COMING OUT.
[000:05:44;944] VEHICLES COMING AND GOING.
[000:05:48;581] WE HAVE SEEN THIS ALL NIGHT
[000:05:50;016] LONG.
[000:05:50;316] HERE ARE FOLKS TOLD A HALF HOUR
[000:05:51;751] BEFORE THE GUNSHOTS IT'S OKAY TO
[000:05:52;652] COME OUT.
[000:05:57;290] FOLK IN WATERTOWN WHO WERE
[000:05:59;225] FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ALL DAY
[000:06:03;629] AND ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN SEEING
[000:06:09;102] THE KIDS LOOKING AT THE
[000:06:10;636] GROWN-UPS IN THEIR LIVES AND THE
[000:06:14;640] GROWN-UPS WERE TOLD DON'T COME
[000:06:16;209] TO THE DOOR UNLESS YOU ARE
[000:06:17;677] CERTAIN IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[000:06:23;149] WE SAW HOUSE-TO-HOUSE SEARCHES
[000:06:24;584] TAKING PLACE WITH LAW
[000:06:25;218] ENFORCEMENT IN MILITARY DRESS.
[000:06:26;719] AUTOMATIC WEAPONS DRAWN.
[000:06:31;090] CAME TO THE HOUSE.
[000:06:32;525] EMPTIED THE HOUSE OF OCCUPANTS
[000:06:33;993] AND WENT IN TO SEARCH IT.
[000:06:35;661] THIS IS SOME OF THE DOOR-TO-DOOR
[000:06:38;531] SEARCHES.
[000:06:39;031] THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE WE ARE
[000:06:41;834] SHOWING THE RESIDENTS WERE ASKED
[000:06:44;203] TO COME OUT FIRST BEFORE THEY
[000:06:45;371] WENT IN.
[000:06:46;339] TYPICAL TO WANT TO CLEAR IT
[000:06:47;607] BEFORE YOU SEARCH.
[000:06:49;976] AGAIN, THIS IS -- THIS WAS THE
[000:06:53;179] STANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL
[000:06:54;280] DAY.
[000:06:54;547] THOSE WEAPONS ARE THE SAME
[000:06:56;449] ISSUED TO THE ARMED FORCES
[000:06:58;751] OVERSEAS.
[000:06:59;118] THAT'S A BASIC M-4
[000:07:02;288] SEMI-AUTOMATIC LONG BARRELLED
[000:07:03;322] WEAPON.
[000:07:03;656] THEY WERE NOT FOOLING AROUND.
[000:07:13;366] THEY HAD AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
[000:07:16;536] SUSPECT PINNED DOWN.
[000:07:18;671] SEVERAL PEOPLE NOTICED A BLACK
[000:07:21;073] VEHICLE WHICH PEOPLE ASSUME TO
[000:07:23;910] BE A HEARSE IN THE FOREGROUND.
[000:07:26;078] WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TRUE.
[000:07:29;081] VARIOUS SIZES AND SHAPES OF
[000:07:33;252] VEHICLES.
[000:07:34;353] SOME OF WHICH FOLKS HAVE NEVER
[000:07:36;022] SEEN BEFORE BECAUSE THEY ARE FOR
[000:07:38;891] SPECIALIZED TASKS.
[000:07:40;460] LESTER HOLT, ANYTHING FROM WHERE
[000:07:43;362] YOU ARE.
[000:07:43;696] >> Reporter: YOU'RE TALKING
[000:07:44;597] ABOUT THE FEAR AND THE CHILDREN
[000:07:46;399] OF PEOPLE WHO HEARD EXPLOSIONS
[000:07:47;767] AND SHOTS LAST NIGHT.
[000:07:49;469] ANY OF US WHO HEARD SHOTS FIRED
[000:07:52;205] IN ANGER KNOW WHAT A HORRIBLE
[000:07:54;207] SOUND THAT IS.
[000:07:54;640] IT TAKES A WHILE TO LEARN WHEN
[000:07:56;742] IT'S COMING YOUR WAY.
[000:07:57;877] YOU DON'T KNOW.
[000:07:59;712] THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
[000:08:01;881] HEARD LAST NIGHT WITH EXPLOSIONS
[000:08:04;150] AND SHOTS.
[000:08:04;517] I WANT TO POINT OUT WE HAVE BEEN
[000:08:06;419] WATCHING POLICE OFFICERS WORK SO
[000:08:08;254] WELL TOGETHER.
[000:08:08;721] DIFFERENT AGENCIES.
[000:08:09;822] WE KNOW THAT TYPICALLY THEIR
[000:08:12;558] ARRIVAL IS BETWEEN AGENCIES.
[000:08:13;926] THEY ARE UNITED IN PURPOSE.
[000:08:15;228] KEEP IN MIND THIS COMMUNITY WAS
[000:08:17;063] ATTACKED.
[000:08:17;597] THE GREATER BOSTON AREA ATTACKED
[000:08:19;765] AND THE BOMBINGS ON MONDAY.
[000:08:21;634] THEN ONE OF THEIR OWN, A POLICE
[000:08:23;469] OFFICER AT M.I.T., MURDERED,
[000:08:26;272] AMBUSHED YESTERDAY.
[000:08:27;874] ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER, TRANSIT
[000:08:29;609] OFFICER WAS SERIOUS LY WOUNDED T
[000:08:34;113] THE BEGINNING OF THE CHASE.
[000:08:35;848] THERE IS SUCH A SENSE OF PURPOSE
[000:08:37;617] AND DEDICATION WE ARE SEEING
[000:08:40;887] FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
[000:08:43;289] THAT ALL CONVERGED IN WATERTOWN.
[000:08:45;525] FBI HAS TAKEN THE LEAD BUT THEY
[000:08:47;560] HAVE ALL FOUND A ROLE.
[000:08:51;497] S.W.A.T. TEAMS TOOK VARIOUS
[000:08:52;665] ROLES AS THEY WENT THROUGH
[000:08:53;933] NEIGHBORHOODS AND POKED THROUGH
[000:08:55;334] BACKYARDS LOOKING FOR THE VERY
[000:08:57;169] KIND OF THING THEY FOUND HERE
[000:08:59;772] TONIGHT.
[000:09:00;306] BY THE WAY, THE BOAT SEEMED TO
[000:09:01;941] HAVE A SHRINK WRAP.
[000:09:03;142] WE ARE TOLD IT HAD A TEAR IN IT.
[000:09:05;444] THAT WAS THE SUSPICIOUS POINT --
[000:09:08;247] THE TEAR AND THE BLOOD STAINS
[000:09:11;284] SUGGESTING THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN
[000:09:12;552] IN THERE OR WAS IN THERE WHICH,
[000:09:14;420] AS IT TURNS OUT WAS THE CASE.
[000:09:16;656] THAT WAS THE KIND OF WORK THEY
[000:09:17;890] WERE DOING TODAY, LOOKING FOR
[000:09:20;426] TELLTALE SIGNS THAT SOMEONE
[000:09:22;061] MIGHT BE HIDING OUT.
[000:09:25;431] BRIAN, BACK TO YOU.
[000:09:28;134] >> WHDH H, OUR STATION IS
[000:09:33;239] BREAKING NEWS THAT THEY ARE
[000:09:33;906] HEARING FROM THE SCENE.
[000:09:34;507] LET'S LISTEN IN.
[000:09:36;475] >> YOU SAID A SUCCESSFUL
[000:09:38;611] RECOVERY WHICH WE WOULD SAY THEY

[000:09:43;549] SUSPECT E IN CUSTODY AND HE'S
[000:09:44;250] ALIVE.
[000:09:45;818] >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
[000:09:49;822] ASSUMPTION.
[000:09:50;222] I THINK YOU HAVE THE GUY
[000:09:50;923] RECOVERED WITH NO INJURY.
[000:09:55;761] I'M GOING TO SEE --
[000:09:59;599] >> IS HE ALIVE?
[000:10:00;933] >> NO TELLING.
[000:10:02;935] >> DAN, YOU'RE WATCHING FROM
[000:10:04;470] THERE.
[000:10:04;770] COOPER IS TALKING TO HIS

[000:10:21;621] THEY ARE ASKING FOR A MEDIC TO
[000:10:23;122] THE SCENE WHICH MEANS THEY ARE
[000:10:24;924] GOING TO BE TRYING TO TREAT HIM.
[000:10:27;326] SPECIFICS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
[000:10:28;027] THAT MEANS.
[000:10:28;427] HE IS IN CUSTODY.
[000:10:30;463] >> EXCELLENT.
[000:10:31;530] >> THAT'S THE BEST NEWS.
[000:10:33;599] 8:42 ON FRIDAY NIGHT.
[000:10:34;467] >> IS IT OVER?
[000:10:36;335] IS IT ALL OVER?
[000:10:37;703] >> IT'S ALL OVER.
[000:10:39;672] >> IT'S OVER.
[000:10:41;474] >> THEY HAVE AN AMBULANCE ON THE
[000:10:43;976] SCENE.
[000:10:44;276] >> AMBULANCE ON THE SCENE.
[000:10:46;078] >> THEY THINK THE GUY IS IN GOOD
[000:10:48;114] ENOUGH SHAPE?
[000:10:48;848] WE SEE THE AMBULANCE PULLING IN
[000:10:49;582] RIGHT NOW.
[000:10:51;083] >> OUTSTANDING.
[000:10:51;651] >> WE'LL FOLLOW THAT.
[000:10:52;952] GREAT NEWS, STEVE.
[000:10:54;387] >> YOU WONDER HOW -- STEVE, DO
[000:10:56;922] WE HAVE ANY IDEA --
[000:10:58;257] >> AMBULANCE CAN NOW GO TO THE
[000:10:59;759] SCENE.
[000:11:00;059] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CONDITION
[000:11:01;327] HE'S IN.
[000:11:03;029] IS THAT CORRECT?
[000:11:03;496] OKAY, THANKS.
[000:11:04;964] YEAH, JUST TO RECAP.
[000:11:07;299] FROM THE SCENE ACCORDING TO MY
[000:11:08;768] SOURCE THE SUSPECT IS IN
[000:11:10;503] CUSTODY.
[000:11:10;836] HE IS ALIVE.
[000:11:14;573] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CONDITION
[000:11:16;142] HE'S IN.
[000:11:17;543] THEY HAVE CALLED FOR A MEDIC TO
[000:11:19;745] THE SCENE.
[000:11:20;546] IT'S A HOT SCENE.
[000:11:21;380] THEY ARE STILL OFFICIALLY
[000:11:22;448] SECURING THE SCENE.
[000:11:23;516] THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH WHAT
[000:11:24;817] DAN WAS SAYING WITH THE LIGHT
[000:11:30;022] APPLAUSE HE MAY HAVE HEARD FROM
[000:11:30;756] HIS VANTAGE POINT.
[000:11:31;290] >> IT'S BEEN A HORRIFYING NIGHT
[000:11:34;226] IN BOSTON, THE WORLD HAS BEEN
[000:11:37;063] WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[000:11:38;330] THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS.
[000:11:40;032] REALLY ABOUT THE BEST POSSIBLE
[000:11:42;334] OUTCOME TONIGHT.
[000:11:43;002] THE SECOND SUSPECT WANTED IN THE
[000:11:45;271] MARATHON BOMBING NOW ALIVE,
[000:11:48;140] CAPTURED, IN CUSTODY AND ABOUT
[000:11:49;308] TO BE ATTENDED BY MEDICS THERE
[000:11:51;343] IN WATERTOWN.
[000:11:52;311] >> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS
[000:11:53;713] CONDITION IS NOW.
[000:11:57;216] DAN, YOU ARE JOINING US WITH
[000:11:59;218] CONFIRMATION OF WHAT STEVE SAID.
[000:12:03;089] >> STATE POLICE GAVE ME A STRONG
[000:12:05;191] HEAD SHAKE.
[000:12:05;758] AN OFFICER SAYING, YES, HE'S
[000:12:06;759] ALIVE.
[000:12:10;996] THEY ARE BRINGING HIM UP IN THIS
[000:12:15;935] DIRECTION.
[000:12:16;302] THEY APPEAR TO BE AT EASE.
[000:12:16;936] THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING UP BIRCH
[000:12:18;304] OR FRANKLIN AREA NOW.
[000:12:20;740] EVERYBODY IS STANDING DOWN,
[000:12:22;675] SATISFIED.
[000:12:23;042] A FEW OF THE OFFICERS TAKING
[000:12:26;045] PICTURES TO COMMEMORATE THE
[000:12:27;480] MOMENT OF THIS SUCCESSFUL END.
[000:12:31;250] INCREDIBLE TO THINK WHEN THIS
[000:12:34;787] CITY WAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF
[000:12:38;824] THE CONCERN, THE DANGER, THE
[000:12:40;226] WORRY ABOUT HOW IT WOULD END.
[000:12:41;627] IT ENDED WITH A WHIMPER, NOT A
[000:12:44;430] BANG.
[000:12:44;730] WE HAD BANGS AND IT COULD HAVE
[000:12:46;165] ENDED WITH MORE.
[000:12:47;299] THESE OFFICERS, WHATEVER THEY
[000:12:48;734] DID, WERE ABLE TO BRING AT LEAST
[000:12:50;870] THE END OF THIS TO A PEACEFUL
[000:12:53;105] CONCLUSION.
[000:12:53;506] >> THAT'S FANTASTIC, DAN.
[000:12:56;709] OF COURSE, NOW AS YOU MENTIONED
[000:12:57;877] THE MEDIC IS AT THE BOAT --
[000:12:59;812] >> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO
[000:13:00;946] THE COVERAGE OF OUR STATION WHDH
[000:13:03;749] IN BOSTON AS THEY WERE TALKING
[000:13:06;051] YOU SAW THE WATERTOWN EMS
[000:13:08;354] AMBULANCE THAT WAS PARKED THERE
[000:13:09;922] FOR SO LONG TAKE A RIGHT AND GO
[000:13:11;924] DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:13:13;826] YOU HEAR THESE MULTIPLE REPORTS.
[000:13:18;731] SUSPECT HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.
[000:13:20;666] THERE IS A CHANGE IN MOOD,
[000:13:22;501] STANCE AND DEMEANOR THERE.
[000:13:25;805] THE SHOT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING
[000:13:26;872] AT --
[000:13:27;473] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
[000:13:28;073] >> NOW WE ARE HEARING -- LISTEN
[000:13:28;908] TO THAT.
[000:13:31;944] OUR REPORTS ARE RICOCHETTING
[000:13:33;946] AROUND AND PEOPLE VIA BROADCAST
[000:13:35;948] OR SOCIAL MEDIA OR TELEVISION
[000:13:38;184] CREWS, PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK IN
[000:13:40;052] NEWTOWN ARE REACTING WITH
[000:13:42;321] CHEERS.
[000:13:42;655] PETE WILLIAMS?
[000:13:43;189] >> WE HAVE CONFIRMED HERE,
[000:13:45;124] BRIAN, AS WELL THAT THE SUSPECT
[000:13:47;293] IS IN CUSTODY.
[000:13:48;194] WE DON'T KNOW PRECISELY HIS
[000:13:48;961] CONDITION.
[000:13:51;864] NOW THE QUESTION IS, OF COURSE,
[000:13:55;868] WHAT HAPPENS NOW.
[000:13:57;670] HE'LL BE IN FEDERAL CUSTODY HERE
[000:14:00;472] BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE
[000:14:01;240] INVESTIGATION SINCE THE BOMBING
[000:14:02;708] HAS BEEN UNDER THE FBI'S
[000:14:05;244] JURISDICTION BECAUSE OF A
[000:14:08;514] FEDERAL LAW, A TERRORISM ATTACK
[000:14:10;049] IS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE
[000:14:14;186] FBI.
[000:14:14;887] THEY WILL TAKE HIM NOW.
[000:14:16;121] IF HE'S GRAVELY WOUNDED OR NEEDS
[000:14:18;591] MEDICAL ATTENTION HE WILL BE
[000:14:21;260] TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE
[000:14:23;262] WILL BE GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION.
[000:14:25;631] IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCENARIO
[000:14:28;734] INVOLVING UMAR ABDEL MUTALLAB,
[000:14:33;639] THE SO-CALLED CHRISTMAS DAY
[000:14:35;841] BOMBER, SIMILAR SITUATION.
[000:14:40;479] HE WAS BADLY HURT, TAKEN TO THE
[000:14:42;348] HOSPITAL, GIVEN TREATMENT.
[000:14:43;749] THEN THE FBI PROCEEDED TO
[000:14:45;684] QUESTION HIM AT LENGTH.
[000:14:47;720] THAT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL THING
[000:14:48;954] AT THE TIME.
[000:14:50;422] PEOPLE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE
[000:14:52;091] BEEN NOT GIVEN A MIRANDA
[000:14:54;260] WARNING.
[000:14:54;593] IT TURNED OUT HE WAS QUESTIONED
[000:14:56;161] FOR A TIME AND THEN GIVEN HIS
[000:14:58;998] MIRANDA WARNING AND THE POLICE
[000:15:01;467] SAID HE KEPT TALKING.
[000:15:02;468] THEY USED IT AS A TEXTBOOK
[000:15:05;204] EXAMPLE.
[000:15:05;537] THIS WILL REMAIN A CONTROVERSIAL
[000:15:06;272] DECISION.
[000:15:09;508] IT IS THE STATED POLICY OF THE
[000:15:11;410] OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE
[000:15:13;779] ANYONE LIKE THIS WHO CREATES A
[000:15:14;813] CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND
[000:15:16;482] TREAT THEM IN THE REGULAR
[000:15:18;217] CIVILIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM.
[000:15:19;318] THEY WILL TAKE HIM AWAY.
[000:15:20;552] WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME COMES,
[000:15:21;987] BEGIN TO QUESTION HIM.
[000:15:23;789] >> PETE, I GOT AN E-MAIL USING A
[000:15:25;457] TERM OF ART IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[000:15:27;026] SOMEBODY SAID, REMEMBER, THIS IS
[000:15:27;760] A FEDERAL SHOW.
[000:15:31;096] >> MEANING THE FBI IS IN CHARGE.
[000:15:33;933] WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD SOME
[000:15:35;134] MEMBERS OF THE SENATE SAY THIS
[000:15:38;437] PERSON SHOULD BE DECLARED AN
[000:15:39;538] ENEMY COMBATANT, NOT GIVEN
[000:15:41;674] MIRANDA WARNING AND SHOULD BE
[000:15:44;109] SUBJECT TO A MILITARY-STYLE
[000:15:47;346] INTERROGATION.
[000:15:47;780] THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL
[000:15:48;781] NEVER GO FOR THAT.
[000:15:50;616] THEY BELIEVE SUSPECTS WHO COMMIT
[000:15:52;885] CRIMES HERE SHOULD BE TREATED IN
[000:15:54;086] THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
[000:15:55;854] THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL INTEND TO
[000:15:57;022] DO.
[000:15:57;289] >> MICHAEL LEITER WHO WAS, AMONG
[000:15:59;525] OTHER THINGS, IN THE ROOM THE
[000:16:02;428] NIGHT OF THE BIN LADEN RAID WHEN
[000:16:03;929] IT WAS PLANNED AND ORDERS
[000:16:06;031] CARRIED OUT FROM THE SITUATION
[000:16:09;568] ROOM.
[000:16:09;935] FORMER HEAD OF COUNTER TERRORISM
[000:16:11;804] FOR THIS COUNTRY, MICHAEL, WALK
[000:16:13;939] US THROUGH WHAT IS LIKELY TO
[000:16:15;307] HAPPEN NOW.
[000:16:15;708] WHAT'S THE FIRST SET OF OFFICIAL
[000:16:19;778] EYEBALLS THAT WILL SIT DOWN
[000:16:21;280] ACROSS FROM OR RIDE WITH THIS
[000:16:24;750] SUSPECT.
[000:16:25;117] ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO
[000:16:26;819] WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
[000:16:28;787] IT TAKES FOR A 19-YEAR-OLD TO BE
[000:16:31;290] CONVINCED THAT PUTTING A BOMB
[000:16:32;891] DOWN NEXT TO LITTLE KIDS IS A
[000:16:33;625] GOOD IDEA.
[000:16:37;396] >> BRIAN, AS PETE MENTIONED
[000:16:39;465] DURING THE CHRISTMAS DAY BOMBER
[000:16:42;134] IN 2009, WE HADN'T FULLY
[000:16:44;770] ESTABLISHED A PROTOCOL AND
[000:16:50;676] DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW A TERROR
[000:16:53;212] SUSPECT WOULD BE INTERROGATED.
[000:16:54;313] WE WORKED THROUGH THE PROBLEM
[000:16:55;014] MORE.
[000:16:57;316] THERE WILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN
[000:16:59;985] PRETHIS ARREST A VERY EXTENSIVE
[000:17:02;154] DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE FBI AND
[000:17:06;191] THE REST OF THE INTELLIGENCE
[000:17:07;559] COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW SUCH AN
[000:17:09;728] INTERROGATION WILL OCCUR AND
[000:17:10;796] WHAT THE KEY ISSUES ARE.
[000:17:13;365] THE FBI IS IN CHARGE AS THE LAW
[000:17:15;334] ENFORCEMENT ENTITY FOR THE
[000:17:16;668] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF
[000:17:17;836] THE INVESTIGATION.
[000:17:18;704] BUT THEY WILL HAVE ALREADY HAVE
[000:17:20;205] WORKED WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
[000:17:21;974] CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND
[000:17:23;208] THE LIKE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
[000:17:24;643] SORTS OF QUESTIONS NEED TO BE
[000:17:27;446] ASKED ABOUT FOREIGN CONTACTS AND
[000:17:29;248] THE LIKE.
[000:17:32;017] WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE IS THEY
[000:17:33;218] WILL TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY.
[000:17:34;753] THERE IS, OF COURSE, THE
[000:17:37;256] POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL
[000:17:40;559] MIRANDAIZE HIM RIGHT AWAY.
[000:17:41;660] THEY WILL LIKELY USE WHAT'S
[000:17:42;961] KNOWN AS THE PUBLIC SAFETY
[000:17:44;797] EXCEPTION.
[000:17:45;197] THAT GIVES THEM LEGAL AUTHORITY
[000:17:48;667] TO QUESTION HIM INITIALLY ABOUT
[000:17:50;402] THINGS WHICH POSE AN IMMEDIATE
[000:17:51;737] THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.
[000:17:54;740] THEY CAN ASK, ARE THERE MORE
[000:17:57;242] IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
[000:17:59;678] ANYWHERE?
[000:18:00;045] THAT CAN TAKE SOME TIME.
[000:18:01;647] THEY CAN GET ALL OF THAT
[000:18:03;582] INFORMATION FROM HIM BEFORE THEY
[000:18:05;150] ACTUALLY MIRANDAIZE HIM.
[000:18:08;020] ONCE THEY MIRANDAIZE HIM, THEY
[000:18:10;656] WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THE
[000:18:12;224] THINGS THEY NEED TO KNOW.
[000:18:14;660] THAT WILL BE DONE BY FBI AGENTS
[000:18:17;496] BUT, AGAIN, SUPPORTED BY THE
[000:18:19;164] REST OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:18:20;299] COMMUNITY.
[000:18:20;666] IN MY VIEW, THEY WILL WANT TO
[000:18:22;167] KNOW, AGAIN, ANY WEAPONS OUT
[000:18:24;470] THERE.
[000:18:25;604] MOTIVATION, ANY OTHER
[000:18:27;206] ASSOCIATES, ARE THERE FURTHER
[000:18:28;607] DANGERS.
[000:18:28;941] THESE ARE THE KEY ISSUES THEY
[000:18:30;542] WILL PURSUE.
[000:18:31;710] THEN THEY WILL START MOVING OUT
[000:18:33;912] TOWARDS MOTIVATION, MORE DISTANT
[000:18:36;281] NETWORKS, THINGS LIKE THAT.
[000:18:37;583] >> MICHAEL, ALREADY THIS THING
[000:18:42;588] IS REICH SPIDER CRACKS WHEN A
[000:18:45;324] ROCK HITS THE WINDSHIELD.
[000:18:47;159] THIS HAS GONE IN ALL DIRECTIONS
[000:18:48;794] ALREADY TODAY.
[000:18:49;561] WE HAVE LEARNED FROM WHDH IN NEW
[000:18:56;168] BEDFORD, MASS, THREE PEOPLE HAVE
[000:18:58;270] BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.
[000:19:00;172] ALL EXPECTED TO BE ROOMMATES
[000:19:02;074] PRESENTLY OR AT ONE TIME WITH
[000:19:02;774] SUSPECT TWO.
[000:19:07;146] THIS KIND OF THING WILL HA.
[000:19:08;847] THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS KID'S
[000:19:10;149] COMPUTER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.
[000:19:12;084] THEY HAVE GOTTEN ALL RETRIEVABLE
[000:19:13;619] EVIDENCE FROM THE HOUSE HE SARED
[000:19:15;521] WITH HIS BROTHER FOR HOWEVER
[000:19:16;221] LONG.
[000:19:22;494] PETE WILLIAMS, YOU HAVE
[000:19:23;862] SOMETHING NEW?
[000:19:25;230] >> WELL, YES.
[000:19:27;499] SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
[000:19:28;367] OFFICIALS CONFIRMED HE'S ALIVE,
[000:19:30;169] IN CUSTODY.
[000:19:31;336] UNBELIEVABLE, AS ONE SAID WHO'S
[000:19:33;038] BEEN FOLLOWING THIS.
[000:19:34;406] THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT SORT
[000:19:35;974] OF CONDITION IS HE IN.
[000:19:38;310] IS HE GRAVELY WOUNDED, WALKING?
[000:19:40;579] WE DON'T KNOW.
[000:19:41;480] WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT NOW.
[000:19:43;282] >> A BIG NIGHT IN WATERTOWN,
[000:19:47;519] MASS.
[000:19:47;819] I WILL TELL YOU, WHAT A 24 HOURS
[000:19:50;455] THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED.
[000:19:53;759] THESE ARE JUST CITIZENS OF A
[000:19:55;327] TOWN IN EASTERN MASS.
[000:19:58;931] THIS WAS VISITED UPON THEM AFTER
[000:20:01;600] THEY WITNESSED THE HORRIBLE
[000:20:03;735] BOMBING AT THE FINISH LINE OF
[000:20:06;438] THE BOSTON MARATHON.
[000:20:08;440] THERE IS YOUR SUSPECT, IN
[000:20:10;943] CUSTODY AND ALIVE.
[000:20:12;044] WE BELIEVE HE SURVIVED ONE OR
[000:20:18;850] MORE BULLET WOUNDS LAST NIGHT IN
[000:20:20;519] A HAIL OF GUNFIRE.
[000:20:22;087] LESTER HOLT IS AT STREET LEVEL,
[000:20:23;422] AS WE HAVE SEEN.
[000:20:24;556] ACROSS FROM THE TOWN DINER IN
[000:20:28;026] THIS TOWN THAT CAN NOW START TO
[000:20:31;096] BREATHE AND LIVE A LITTLE BIT.
[000:20:34;032] LESTER?
[000:20:34;366] >> WE HEARD 30 SECONDS OF
[000:20:35;601] SUSTAINED APPLAUSE FROM THE
[000:20:36;969] CROWD WHEN WORD GOT OUT THAT HE
[000:20:38;804] WAS IN CUSTODY.
[000:20:44;276] THESE FOLKS HAVE LIVED THROUGH
[000:20:46;278] HELL WITH THE SHOTS AND
[000:20:47;713] EXPLOSIONS.
[000:20:48;714] I'M WITH RITA WHO LIVES IN THE
[000:20:52;184] NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:20:52;618] WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THE FACT
[000:20:55;420] THAT THEY HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY.
[000:20:56;688] >> I'M RELIEVED.
[000:20:59;091] FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN WATCHING A
[000:21:00;192] BAD MOVIE I COULDN'T TURN OFF.
[000:21:04;730] I'LL BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT.
[000:21:06;198] >> THE HELICOPTER CAME OVER AND
[000:21:07;199] YOU SAID, I WILL BE GLAD WHEN
[000:21:08;333] THAT'S OVER.
[000:21:10;969] >> I WILL BE.
[000:21:12;304] I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
[000:21:13;472] BE IN A WAR ZONE.
[000:21:15;274] LISTENING TO THEM MADE IT FEEL
[000:21:18;143] LIKE THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.
[000:21:19;911] VERY UNSETTLING.
[000:21:22;981] >> Reporter: GRATEFUL FOR YOU
[000:21:23;682] AND THE COMMUNITY.
[000:21:24;650] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING
[000:21:25;384] TO US.
[000:21:27;152] BIG RELIEF, BRIAN, FOR FOLKS
[000:21:28;720] THAT WERE POTENTIALLY GOING TO
[000:21:29;655] FACE ANOTHER NIGHT OF
[000:21:30;956] UNCERTAINTY THAT THIS PERSON
[000:21:34;359] COULD BE OUT THERE, A PERSON
[000:21:36;461] WHO'S SHOWN WILLINGNESS TO DO
[000:21:37;529] GREAT HARM.
[000:21:41;600] FOLKS HAVE BEEN OUT ALL DAY.
[000:21:43;435] THEY WILL REST WELL TONIGHT HERE
[000:21:44;436] IN WATERTOWN.
[000:21:45;337] >> LESTER, THANKS.
[000:21:46;738] IF MICHAEL LEITER CAN STILL HEAR
[000:21:51;677] US IN WASHINGTON -- ARE YOU WITH
[000:21:55;947] US?
[000:21:56;281] >> I AM, BRIAN.
[000:21:57;482] >> I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL DAY AS
[000:21:59;651] LONG AS WE KEEP THE BALANCE MORE
[000:22:01;086] GOOD GUYS THAN BAD WE'LL BE ALL
[000:22:05;524] RIGHT.
[000:22:07;326] THE OTHER LESSON IS ABOUT LAW
[000:22:09;161] ENFORCEMENT, TRAILS PEOPLE LEAVE
[000:22:11;330] BEHIND.
[000:22:11;663] THE LEAPS AND BOUNDS TECHNOLOGY
[000:22:13;065] HAS TAKEN.
[000:22:14;366] WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES IN THE
[000:22:18;437] PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
[000:22:21;239] FOLLOWING OKLAHOMA CITY WE WERE
[000:22:21;973] IN ROUGH SHAPE IN TERMS OF THE
[000:22:23;575] ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE THIS TYPE
[000:22:25;243] OF THING.
[000:22:28;413] NOW THE SWEEP OF TECHNOLOGY.
[000:22:31;083] IT'S HARD TO GET AWAY WITH
[000:22:33;118] SOMETHING BAD IN THIS COUNTRY.
[000:22:34;319] >> IT IS.
[000:22:37;756] THIS IS A SILVER LINING ON A
[000:22:39;624] DARK CLOUD GOING BACK TO 1996
[000:22:42;461] WITH OKLAHOMA CITY, 1998 WITH
[000:22:44;629] KENYA AND TANZANIA, THE FIRST
[000:22:47;866] WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
[000:22:49;501] THROUGH 9/11.
[000:22:50;302] WHAT THE LAST 12 YEARS HAVE
[000:22:52;304] GIVEN US IS INCREDIBLE HUMAN
[000:22:54;840] CAPITAL.
[000:22:55;340] INCREDIBLE TALENT WITHIN
[000:22:57;409] ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FBI AND

[000:23:14;760] AND THE TECHNOLOGY TO PULL IT
[000:23:16;661] TOGETHER.
[000:23:17;028] FIVE YEARS AGO IT COULD HAVE
[000:23:19;898] OCCURRED AND WE MIGHT NOT HAVE
[000:23:20;999] HAD NEARLY THE DIGITAL RECORD
[000:23:23;001] THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THIS CASE.
