1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
THROUGH THAT PRESS BRIEFING.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
ANOTHER EXCITING ONE.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
WE WILL BE BACK HERE TOMORROW.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
JOIN US THEN AS WELL.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'M MELISSA FRANCIS.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
COMING UP NEXT HERE'S

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
>> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
WEST COAST.
3:00 IN D.C. WHERE WE'RE

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
WATCHING NEW FALLOUT OVER THE

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
FIRING OF THE FBI DIRECTOR,

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
JAMES COMEY.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
NOW SOME REPUBLICANS ARE

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
REFUSING TO DEFEND PRESIDENT

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
TRUMP OR CALL HIM OUT.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
LAWMAKERS TALKING ABOUT WHO THEY

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
WANT RUNNING THE BUREAU NEXT.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A PROFESSIONAL, NOT A

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
POLITICIAN.
ALSO, NEW ACCUSATIONS THAT THE

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
IS CARRYING OUTS EXECUTIONS

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
AND HAS BUILT A CREMATORIUM TO

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
HIDE EVIDENCE.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
AND NORTH KOREA MARKS A

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
DANGEROUS AND NEW MILESTONE WITH

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
ITS LARGEST BALLISTIC MISSILE

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
FLIGHT SO FAR.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THE NORTH KOREANS CLAIM THIS

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THING CAN CARRY A NUKE.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
LET'S GET TO IT.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK ON

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
THIS BUSY MONDAY, THE WHITE

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
HOUSE STILL WILL NEITHER CONFIRM

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
NOR DENY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HAS TAPES OF HIS CONVERSATIONS

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
WITH THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
JAMES COMEY.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
ANALYSTS SAY THAT IS MAKING THE

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
WHITE HOUSE'S EFFORT TO RESPOND

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
TO CRITICISM OF HIS FIRING EVEN

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
MORE DIFFICULT.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
THE SEARCH IS ON FOR A NEW FBI

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
DIRECTOR.
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
ABOUT IT WHEN SPEAKING WITH THE

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
CROWN PRINCE OF ABU-DHABI.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THANK YOU.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
>> Shepard: THAT'S TODAY.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
FRIDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNED

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
JAMES COCMEY NOT THE SPEAK OUT

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
ABOUT HIS FIRING.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
IT'S WORTH NOTING THE PRESIDENT

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
PUT TAPES IN QUOTES THERE,

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
SIMILAR TO WHEN HE PUT "WIRES

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
TAPPED" IN MARCH WHEN HE MADE

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
HIS UNFOUNDED CLAIM THAT

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA ORDERED

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SURVEILLANCE AT TRUMP TOWER.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE USE OF

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
QUOTES OPENED THE PHRASE TO A

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
BROAD DEFINITION OF

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SURVEILLANCE.
THE PRESIDENT USED "TAP" NOT IN

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
QUOTES.
SO FAR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
SAID WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
WHEN HE TWEETED ABOUT TAPES.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
SEAN SPICER SAID THE PRESIDENT

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
HAD NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
ISSUE.
THE REPUBLICAN SAID AT THE

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS,

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLED THE

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
PRESIDENT'S TWEET INAPPROPRIATE

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AND THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO HAVE

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
COMEY TESTIFY BEFORE THE PANEL.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
>> I WOULD ADVISE THE PRESIDENT

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
NOT THE TWEET ABOUT THE

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
INVESTIGATION AS WE GO FORWARD.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THE RUSSIANS INTERFERED IN OUR

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
ELECTION.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I DON'T THINK THEY CHANGED THE

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
OUTCOME BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
TO BACK OFF HERE AND LET THE

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
INVESTIGATION GO FORWARD.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WE NEED TO CALL COMEY AND GOT TO

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THE BET TOM OF THIS.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> Shepard: SENATOR GRAHAM SAYS

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
PRESIDENT IS THE TARGET OF AN

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
INVESTIGATION INVOLVING POSSIBLE

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
ON THE PRESIDENT'S SUGGESTION

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THAT TAPES MAY EXIST OF HIS

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
CONVERSATIONS WITH JAMES COMEY,

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
ANOTHER REPUBLICAN ON THE SENATE

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAYS HISTORY

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SHOWS US RESPECTS RECORDING

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THEIR CONVERSATIONS IS NOT

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
NECESSARILY THE BEST IDEA.

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HERE'S WHAT SENATOR MIKE LEE OF

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
UTAH TOLD CHRIS WALLACE ON "FOX

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
NEWS SUNDAY."

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU THINK THE

102
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
PRESIDENT SHOULD TURN OVER ANY

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
RELEVANT TAPES TO THIS

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
INVESTIGATION TO THE CONGRESS?

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
>> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
INEVITABLE, IF THERE ARE SUCH

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
RECORDINGS.
THEY WILL BE SUBPOENAED AND

108
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
PROBABLY HAVE TO TURN THEM OVER.

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> Shepard: WHEN IT COMES TO THE

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
FIRING OF JAMES COMEY, NIKKI

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
HALEY TOLD ABC'S "THIS WEEK"

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A PRESIDENT

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OF ACTION.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS A CEO OF THE

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
COUNTRY.

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
HE CAN FIRE AND FIRE WHOEVER HE

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WANTS.
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH IT OR

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
NOT, IT'S THE TRUE.

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
HE'S TRYING TO FIND HIS OWN

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
TEAM.

120
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WERE THERE BETTER WAYS TO DO

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
THAT?
THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO

122
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
DECIDE.
>> NIKKI HALEY.

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
AS FOR THE POTENTIAL TAPES, SHE

124
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
SAID SHE'S ASSUMES SHE'S BEING

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
TAPED EVERYWHERE.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
JAMES COMEY HAS DECLINED AN

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
INVITATION TO TESTIFY BEHIND

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
CLOSED DOORS TOMORROW BEFORE THE

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
BUT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND

131
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
OTHERS ARE REPORTING HE'S

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WILLING TO TESTIFY AS LONG AS

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
IT'S OUT IN PUBLIC FOR EVERYBODY

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
TO SEE.

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ONE KEY ISSUE IS A WHITE HOUSE

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
DINNER BETWEEN JAMES COMEY AND

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST DAYS AFTER

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE INAUGURATION.

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THE.
HAS ONE STORY.

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
HE SAYS HE THOUGHT JAMES COMEY

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
ARRANGED THE DINNER AND THAT

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
COMEY TOLD HIM THE FBI WAS NOT

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
INVESTIGATING HIM.

144
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND OTHERS

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
REPORT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
INVITED JAMES COMEY AND THE

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
PRESIDENT ASKED REPEATEDLY

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
WHETHER THE FBI DIRECTOR WOULD

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
PLEDGE A LOYALTY TO HIM.

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ACCORDING TO THE TIMES, DIRECTOR

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
COMEY DECLINED.

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CORRESPONDENCE JOHN ROBERTS IS

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOU SAYING

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ABOUT THESE POTENTIAL TAPES IF

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
ANYTHING AT ALL?

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
>> AS YOU POINTED OUT, SHEP,

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THEY'RE NOT SAYING A LOT.

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
ABOUT ALL OF THE REPORTING GOING

161
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
ON ABOUT TAPES, PEOPLE ARE

162
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SAYING WAS THERE AN OVAL OFFICE

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
RECORDING MECHANISM MUCH LIKE IN

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE

165
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
RECORDED PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OF EVERYBODY THAT CAME IN.

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
EVEN IF THERE WAS AN OVAL OFFICE

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
SYSTEM, PROBABLY WOULDN'T

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
PERTAIN TO THE COMEY MEETING

170
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
MEETING DINNER IN THE ROOM OFF

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THE OVAL OFFICE AND MORE LIKELY

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
EITHER IN THE RESIDENCE OR IN

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
ONE OF THE OFFICIAL ROOMS IN THE

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
MAIN MANSION HERE AT THE WHITE

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
HOUSE.

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SO THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT THE

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
PRESIDENT HAD SOME SORT OF

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
RECORDING SYSTEM THAT WAS

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT MANSION.

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
IT'S NOT KNOWN AT THIS POINT

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS "TAPES"

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
ARE TALKING ABOUT A RECORDING

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
DEVICE OR OTHER CONVERSATION OR

185
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
MERELY TRYING TO PLAY WITH THE

186
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
MEDIA THERE AND JAMES COMEY

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SAYING MAYBE THERE ARE TAPES.

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HERE'S WHAT SEAN SPICER SAID

189
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
ABOUT IT AT THE BRIEFING A SHORT

190
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
TIME AGO.

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
>> IS THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDING

192
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
TO FURNISH THAT INFORMATION AS

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
REQUESTED IN WRITING?

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING

195
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
FURTHER ON THAT.

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
>> DOES THAT MEAN THE PRESIDENT

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WILL DENY --

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
>> I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THE

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE NOTHING

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
FURTHER ON THAT LAST WEEK.

201
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> IS THE SITUATION WITH THE

202
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH --

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> LISTEN, I MADE IT CLEAR WHAT

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION IS ON

205
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
THAT ISSUE.

206
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
HUNTER?

207
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
>> SO THE PRESIDENT AND THE

208
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
PRESS SECRETARY SAYING NOTHING,

209
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SHEP, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE

210
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
TAPES AND WHETHER OR NOT THE

211
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
TAPES WOULD BE PROVIDED TO

212
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
CONGRESS BECAUSE THERE ARE

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
INDICATIONS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
UP THERE ON CAPITOL HILL WOULD

215
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
LIKE TO HEAR THEM IF THERE ARE

216
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
TAPES.
I WOULD PAUSE IT, SHEP, IT'S

217
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
UNLIKELY THERE WOULD BE TAPES OF

218
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A DINNER UNLESS SOMEBODY HAD A

219
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
RECORDING DEVICE NEARBY.

220
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THE TWO PHONE CALLS ARE A

221
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
DIFFERENT STORY.

222
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
ALL OF THE PRESIDENT'S PHONE

223
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
CALLS ARE LOGGED AND SOME OF

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THEM ARE TRANSCRIBED, SHEP.

225
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS MATTER OF

226
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
DISCUSSION OF A POSSIBLE SPECIAL

227
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
PROSECUTOR?

228
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
KEN STARR, THE ONE THAT COMES TO

229
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
MIND FOR MOST PEOPLE.

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THEY END UP EXPANDING

231
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
INVESTIGATIONS.
THERE'S REPUBLICANS ON BOARD?

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
>> THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR

233
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
STATUTE AS APPLIED TO KEN STARR

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
IS NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE.

235
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WOULD HAVE

236
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TO BE PROVIDED AND NAMED BY THE

237
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

238
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMPLAINTS

239
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
FROM DEMOCRATS ABOUT THE NEED

240
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
FOR A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR OVER

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THE WEEKEND.

242
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
SOME DEMOCRATS SAID THEY WOULD

243
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
REFUSE TO CONSIDER THE NAME OF

244
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THE NOMINEE IN CONFIRMATION

245
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
HEARINGS UNTIL A SPECIAL
PROSECUTOR IS APPOINTED.

246
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I ASKED SEAN SPICER.

247
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
HERE'S HOW HE RESPONDED.

248
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> THERE'S FRANKLY NO NEED FOR A

249
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

250
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
YOU HAVE TWO SENATE COMMITTEES

251
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
LOOKING INTO THIS, THE FBI IS

252
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
CONDUCTING THEIR OWN REVIEW.

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
AND I THINK IF YOU EVEN LOOK AT

254
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
WHAT ACTING DIRECTOR McCABE

255
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
SAID, THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
THEY NEED.

257
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> ONE THING THAT DIDN'T COME UP

258
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AT THE BRIEFING, RECORDS OF A

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
MASSIVE STAFF SHAKEUP.

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'M TOLL A MASSIVE STAFF SHAKEUP

261
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
IS "NONSENSE."

262
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THERE'S SOME TALK THERE MAY BE

263
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
CHANGES TO THE COMMUNICATIONS

264
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
SHOP AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THE COMEY FIRING LAST TUESDAY.

266
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ALSO TOLD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE

267
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WHO HAS BEEN IN A LOT OF

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
REPORTING "ON THE BUBBLE" SINCE

270
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
JANUARY ALSO MAY NOT HOLD THE

271
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
COMPLETE FAVOR OF THE PRESIDENT

272
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.

273
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
SHEP, WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE

274
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

275
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
COULD BE ANOTHER CASE OF THAT.

276
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS AT THE

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WHITE HOUSE.

278
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THANK YOU.

279
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
LET'S GO TO JOSH GERSSTEIN.

280
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
ANY NEW NEWS?

281
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING,

282
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
SHEP, DURING THE BRIEFING THAT

283
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
SEAN SPICER TRIED TO PUT

284
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
TOGETHER ANOTHER RATIONALE FOR

285
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY SAYING

286
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT THAT

287
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
FIRING COMEY WOULD BE DIFFICULT

288
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT AND WOULD HURT

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
HIM IN SOME WAY.

290
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
BUT SUGGESTING AGAIN THAT MAYBE

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

292
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.

293
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
SO SPICER TRYING TO STIR UP SOME

294
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
DUST OVER THAT ISSUE AGAIN.

295
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
>> Shepard: IS THERE ANY

296
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
AGREEMENT NOW ON HOW THIS THING

297
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
SHOULD GO FORWARD?

298
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
IS IT SEPARATED COMPLETELY ALONG

299
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
PARTISAN LINES?

300
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
>> WELL, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME

301
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
INDICATION THAT SOME REPUBLICANS

302
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
MIGHT BE OPEN TO A SPECIAL

303
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
PROSECUTOR AT A CERTAIN POINT.

304
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
MARCO RUBIO SAID MAYBE WE'LL GET

305
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TO A POINT THAT THAT WOULD BE

306
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
APPROPRIATE.
THE ISSUE IS MUDDLED TOGETHER

307
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
WITH THIS QUESTION OF

308
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
REPLACEMENT OF THE FBI DIRECTOR

309
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
WITH DEMOCRATS AS WE DISCUSSED

310
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
EARLIER SAYING THEY WOULDN'T

311
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
VOTE TO CONFIRM ANYONE UNTIL A

312
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS IN PLACE.

313
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THAT LEAVES OPEN THE QUESTION OF

314
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
HOW THE WHITE HOUSE WILL GET

315
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
SOMEBODY CONFIRMED FOR THE FBI'S

316
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
DIRECTOR JOB.

317
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THOSE VOTES FOR DIRECTOR CON

318
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
FORMATION VOTES OVER THE LAST

319
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
45, 50 YEARS HAVE BEEN

320
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
UNANIMOUS.

321
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
98-0.

322
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
93-1 UNANIMOUS CONSENT.

323
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SO TO HAVE A PARTY LINE VOTE ON

324
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
CONFIRMING AN FBI DIRECTOR WOULD

325
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
BE AN EXTRAORDINARY DEPARTURE

326
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
FROM WHAT'S GO ON IN THE RECENT

327
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
DECADES.
>> Shepard: ON THE LIST OF

328
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
POTENTIAL CANDIDATES, A NUMBER

329
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
OF PEOPLE, POLITICIANS AND

330
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
JUDGES.
THIS IDEA OF A POLITICIAN AS THE

331
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
FBI DIRECTOR, IT'S A NEW ONE AND

332
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE FARING WELL.

333
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
>> IT DOESN'T.

334
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO

335
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
STEP APART FROM SOME OF THOSE

336
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
POSSIBILITIES LIKE WE HEARD

337
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
SENATOR JOHN CORNYN WAS ONE OF

338
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THOSE INTERVIEWED AS I WAS

339
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
REPRESENTATIVE MIKE ROGERS.

340
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I THINK THEY'RE BOTH HELD IN

341
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
HIGHEST STEAM IN THE CONGRESS.

342
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
YOU'VE HAD SENATOR LINDSEY

343
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
GRAHAM AND SOME OTHERS SUGGEST

344
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THAT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO SET

345
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A NEW PRECEDENT OF HAVING A

346
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
POLITICIAN AS FBI DIRECTOR.

347
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
IT WOULD BE WISER TO PICK

348
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
SOMEBODY FROM THE FBI'S RANKS OR

349
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A LONG-TERM PROSECUTOR AS WE'VE

350
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
SEEN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL,

351
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
MAYBE HAS THE CRIMINAL DIVISION

352
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

353
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THOSE ARE A GREATER POSSIBILITY

354
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
THAN A POLITICIAN.

355
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
>> Shepard: REGARDING THE ISSUES

356
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THAT WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE DALE

357
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
LIVE.

358
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
WE DID FRIDAY, WE HAVE TODAY.

359
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THEN WE HEAR THE TALK OF PEOPLE

360
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
HAVING GREAT CONCERN BEHIND THE

361
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SCENES.

362
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
COULD YOU GIVE US WHAT YOU

363
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
THOUGH ABOUT THIS SORT OF

364
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
SENTIMENT?
>> WELL, THERE'S NERVOUSNESS AS

365
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
WE HEARD IN THE BRIEFING ABOUT

366
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THE TAPE RECORDING SYSTEM AND

367
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
WHETHER THERE IS ONE OR ISN'T

368
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
ONE.

369
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
IT WAS JUST LIKE A FLAT OUT

370
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
NONRESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

371
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
TODAY.

372
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT I

373
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
THINK HAS STRUGGLED TO FIND

374
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
PEOPLE TO JOIN ITS RANKS.

375
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
SOME BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE

376
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
NOT WILLING TO DO SO.

377
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
IN OTHER CASES BECAUSE THEY MAY

378
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000

379
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
SEEN AS DISLOYAL TO PRESIDENT

380
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
TRUMP.
THEY WERE SCRATCHED FROM THE

381
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
LIST.
YOU LOOK AT THAT POOL AGAIN WHEN

382
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
YOU CAN'T GET ASSURANCES THAT

383
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
YOU'RE NOT BEING RECORDED IN

384
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000

385
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THE SEARCH OF THE NEXT HEAD OF

THE FBI, THEY HAVE SEEMED TO

393
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
FIND COMMON GROUND.

394
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000

395
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000

REPUBLICANS REFUSED TO CONFIRM

400
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
TO THE SUPREME COURT.

401
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
trust Safelite AutoGlass.

405
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
For these parents, driving
around was the only way to get
their baby to sleep.

406
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So when their windshield
got cracked...

407
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
CUSTOMER: We can't
drive this car.

408
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000

fixed right.

409
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So they scheduled with Safelite.

410

Because the ones you love,
sit behind it.

Safelite repair, Safelite

00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000

SCHUMER, SAID THE NEW FBI

427
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
DIRECTOR SHOULD BE SOMEONE OF

428
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
NOT A PARTISAN BACKGROUND.

429
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000

McCONNELL SAID THE SENATE

434
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
MAJORITY LEADER SUPPORTS THE

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
IDEA OF MERRICK GARLAND AS THE

436
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
NEXT FBI DIRECTOR.

437
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
EVEN THOUGH HE AND OTHER

438
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO HOLD

439
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
HEARINGS FOR HIM AS A SUPREME

440
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
DIRECTOR IS BEING HANDLED BY THE

448
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

449
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
MY EXPECTATION WOULD BE AS THEY

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
CONDUCT THAT SEARCH, THEY'LL

451
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000

453
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
EFFORT.

FBI DIRECTOR SAID SUNDAY THAT

458
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000

>> IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION.

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

461
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT POST

462
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000

NOMINATE MERRICK GARLAND, HIS

465
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000

THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT THIS, IT

IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST

Umm...

557
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You wouldn't want your
painter to quit part way,

558

so when it comes to
pain relievers,

560
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
why put up with
just part of a day?

company says they'll only pay

it takes to replace it.

575

did start saving.

This gap between when
we should start saving

738
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000

do is one of the reasons

739
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
why too many of us aren't
prepared for retirement.

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's going to pay
off in the future.

742
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If we all start saving
a little more today,

743
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
we'll all be better
prepared tomorrow.

Bring Your Challenges.

745
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
WILL YOU BE READY WHEN
THE MOMENT TURNS ROMANTIC?

746
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
CIALIS FOR DAILY USE TREATS ED
AND THE URINARY SYMPTOMS OF BPH.

747
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT YOUR MEDICINES,

748
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

749
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

750
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
OR ADEMPAS® FOR
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,

751
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

752
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IN EXCESS.

753
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

754
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

755
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS OF HEARING OR VISION,

756
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
OR AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
STOP TAKING CIALIS

757
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

758
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
STARTED ON THE SIXTH FLORIDA AND

776
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

784
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I was always
"the girl with psoriasis."

785
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
People don't stare anymore.

786
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I never joined in.

787
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That wasn't fair to any of us.

788
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I was covered.

789
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I tried lots of things
over the years.

790
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But I didn't give up.

791
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I kept on fighting.

792
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I found something that worked.

793
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That still works.

794
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Now?

795
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
SEE ME.

796
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SEE ME.

797
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I found clear skin that lasts.

798
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
See if COSENTYX could make a
difference for you-

799
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
COSENTYX is proven to help
people with moderate

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
to severe plaque psoriasis...

801
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
...find clear skin that
can last.

802
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Don't use if you're allergic
to COSENTYX.

803
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Before starting COSENTYX,

804
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you should be checked
for tuberculosis.

805
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
An increased risk of infections
and lowered ability

806
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
to fight them may occur.

807
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Tell your doctor if you have an
infection or symptoms.

808
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Or if you have received a
vaccine or plan to.

809
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
If you have inflammatory
bowel disease,

810
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
tell your doctor if symptoms
develop or worsen.

811
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Serious allergic reactions
may occur.

812
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
SEE ME
to know...

813
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
...clear skin can last.

814
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Don't hold back...

815
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
...ask your dermatologist if
COSENTYX can help you

816
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
find clear skin that lasts.

817
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
>> A BIG THREAT.

923
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
MEETING TOMORROW AT THE U.N.

924
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
SECURITY COUNCIL.

925
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, GREG.

926
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
AND PRESIDENT OF THE PLOW SHARES

927
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
FUND WORKING TO REDUCE AND

928
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
ELIMINATE THE DANGERS POSED BY

929
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE AUTHOR

930
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
OF "NUCLEAR NIGHTMARES."

931
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
JOE, NICE TO SEE YOU.

932
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
>> PLEASURE, SHEP.

933
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
>> Shepard: WHERE ARE WE IN THE

934
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
LONG ARM OF TROUBLES WITH NORTH

935
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
KOREA?
>> IN IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD TO

936
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
NORTH KOREA.

937
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THE MOST DANGEROUS TEST THEY

938
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
HAVE DONE YET.
>> Shepard: WHY?

939
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>> DEMONSTRATING NEW

940
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
CAPABILITIES.

941
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
IT DIDN'T TRAVEL VERY FAR BUT

942
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
THAT'S BECAUSE IT TOOK A LOFTED

943
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
TRAJECTORY.

944
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
WENT STRAIGHT UP AND CAME

945
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
STRAIGHT DOWN.
IT TRAVELED ABOUT 500 MILES, THE

946
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
DISTANCE FROM MAINE TO

947
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
WASHINGTON D.C., IF YOU FLATTEN

948
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THAT OUT.

949
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
YOU GET TO IT 2,500 MILES AND

950
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
THE WIDTH OF THE UNITED STATES

951
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AND COULD TRAVEL THAT IN ABOUT

952
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
30 MINUTES.

953
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS,

954
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
WHY IT TOOK THE TRAJECTORY.

955
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THEY RETESTED A RE-ENTRY

956
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
VEHICLE.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

957
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
ONE OF THE OBSTACLES IS NOT ONLY

958
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
GETTING SOMETHING IN SPACE BUT

959
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
BRING IT BACK DOWN AND SURVIVE

960
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
THE HEAT.

961
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
THIS TEST MIMICKED WHAT IT WOULD

962
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
BE LIKE IN ICBM RANGE, THE HEAT

963
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
AND STRESS OF REENTRY AND THEY

964
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
APPARENTLY HAD A SUCCESSFUL TEST

965
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
OF THEIR REENTRY VEHICLE

966
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
TECHNOLOGY.
FINALLY, A STEPPING STONE ON THE

967
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
WAY TO THAT LONGER MISSILE.

968
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THE

969
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
CHINESE DEVELOPED THEIR LONG

970
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
RANGE MISSILE.

971
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THEY HAD A MISSILE LIKE THIS

972
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
CALLED THE DX 3.

973
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WENT ABOUT THIS LONG.

974
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
A FEW YEARS LATER, THEY FOLLOWED

975
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
BY THE 4 AND USED THAT AS THE

976
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
FIRST STAGE OF THEIR

977
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC

978
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
MISSILE.
THAT IS WHAT WE THINK NORTH

979
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
KOREA IS UP TO.

980
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
>> Shepard: WE NEED DEES CALATIN

981
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
HERE.

982
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
ARE THE CHINESE A PARTNER IN

983
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
THAT?
>> THEY'RE DEFINITELY A PARTNER.

984
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
THEY WON'T TAKE CARE OF THE

985
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
PROBLEM FOR US.

986
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
THEY WILL PUT ON MORE SANCTIONS

987
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
AND MORE PRESSURE.

988
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
THEY AND RUSSIA, AS PUTIN

989
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
AFFIRMED TODAY, DON'T WANT TO

990
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SEE A NUCLEAR ARMED NORTH KOREA

991
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
CONTINUING TO TEST LIKE THIS,

992
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PUT

993
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
SANCTIONS ON TO CAUSE THE NORTH

994
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
KOREAN REGIME TO COLLAPSE.

995
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
THAT IS SENDING MILLIONS OF

996
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
REFUGEES INTO CHINA

997
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
DESTABILIZING IT, CREATING

998
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
CHAOS.

999
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
THEY WANT THE UNITED STATES TO

1000
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
MEET WITH NORTH KOREA TO

1001
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
NEGOTIATE SOME AGREEMENT.

1002
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THAT IS THE COMPROMISE.

1003
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
PRESSURE PLUS ENGAGEMENT COULD

1004
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
STOP THE PROGRAM.

1005
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
>> THANKS, JOE.

1006
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
>> Shepard: THANKS.

1007
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
AND SEAN SPICER SAID THAT

1008
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
ASSAD'S REGIME IS MURDERING

1009
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
THOUSANDS AND BURNING BODIES TO

1010
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
COVER IT UP APPARENTLY WITH

1011
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SUPPORT FROM RUSSIA AND IRAN.

1012
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
THEY RELEASED THE PICTURES OF

1013
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
THE PRISON WITH THE CREMATORIUM.

1014
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
OFFICIALS SAY SYRIANS ARE

1015
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
HANGING AS MANY AS 50 PEOPLE A

1016
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
DAY THERE.

1017
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
THIS IS ABOUT A 45 MINUTE DRIVE

1018
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
FROM DAMASCUS.

1019
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS APPALLED

1020
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
BY THE ATROCITIES LIKE THIS.

1021
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AFTER LAST MONTH'S GAS ATTACKS

1022
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THAT KILLED DOZENS, THE AIR

1023
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
FORCE BOMBED A SYRIAN AIR BASE.

1024
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
RICH EDSON IS AT THE STATE

1025
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
DON'T.
RICH?
>> THE ADMINISTRATION POINTS TO

1026
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THREE PHOTOS TAKEN OVER A

1027
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
FOUR-YEAR PERIOD.

1028
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SHOWED THAT

1029
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
THEY DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY SAY

1030
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
IS A CREMATORIUM OF BUILDINGS ON

1031
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE COMPLEX.

1032
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THE U.S. CLAIMS THE PHOTOS SHOW

1033
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
A PROBABLE AIR INTAKE, FIRE WALL

1034
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
AND DISCHARGE STACK.

1035
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
ONE FINAL PHOTO SHOWS MELTING

1036
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
SNOW ON THE ROOF OF THIS

1037
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
BUILDING LIKELY, ACCORDING TO

1038
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
THE ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE

1039
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
HEAT OF A CREMATORIUM BURNING

1040
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
VICTIMS.

1041
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY CANNOT

1042
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
RULE OUT THE HEAT IS FROM

1043
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ANOTHER SOURCE AND CANNOT SAY

1044
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
FOR CERTAIN THAT IT'S A

1045
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
CREMATORIUM.

1046
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
ALL THOSE THEY'RE USING THE

1047
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
PICTURES AND INTELLIGENCE.

1048
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT CITING

1049
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
REPORTS THAT THE ASSAD REGIME

1050
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
HAS ABDUCTED MORE THAN 100,000

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
AND PUTS 70 IN A PRISONERS

1052

FACILITY FROM 2011-15, SHEP.

1057
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> Shepard: NOT BRAND NEW

1058
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
INFORMATION, RICH.
I WONDER IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO

1059
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
MAKE OF THE TIMING OF THIS.

1060
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
>> IT'S ALL TOO PRESSURE RUSSIA.

1061
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
LAST WEEK, SERGEY LAVROV WAS AT

1062
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

1063
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS THE

1064
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
RUSSIANS TO REIGN IN THE ASSAD

1065
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
REGIME.

1066
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
THIS IS A WAY OF PUBLICLY

1067
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
PRESSURING RUSSIA.
PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS

1068
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
SAYING RUSSIA CANNOT ALLOW THE

1069
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
ATROCITIES TO CONTINUE AND THEY

1070
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WANT RUSSIA TO LEAD ON THE ASSAD

1071
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
REGIME TO STOP IT.

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
WHOOPS.

1104
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
UNITED UTILIZES A NUMBER OF

1105
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
MEASURES TO KEEP SAFE.

1106
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
IN THE INTERIM, THIS PROTOCOL

1107
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
ASSURES OUR COCKPITS REMAIN

1108
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
SECURITY.

1109
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE MONTHS

1110
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
FOR UNITED.

1111
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THERE'S BEEN SCORPIONS ON PLANES

1112
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
AND SECURITY OFFICERS DRAGGED A

1113
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
PASSENGER OFF OF ANOTHER FLIGHT.

1114
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK'S GERRI

1115
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
WILLIS IS HERE.

1116
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,000
WHAT ARE WE GETTED FROM  UNITED?

1117
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
>> THEY SAY THE INFORMATION WAS

1118
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
SHARED INADVERTENTLY BUT NOT A

1119
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
BREACH.

1120
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE ASSURED BY THIS.

1121
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
EITHER WAY, IT'S NOT GOOD.

1122
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
YOU DON'T WANT THIS INFORMATION

1123
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.

1124
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
WE THINK IT'S A BREACH, THAT

1125
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
SOMEBODY PROBABLY STOLE THE

1126
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
INFORMATION.
BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

1127
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
IT WAS A UNITED EMPLOYEE.

1128
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
A CALL FOR MORE PROTECTION FROM

1129
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
THE PILOT'S UNION SAYING THEY'VE

1130
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE

1131
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
INSTALLATION OF SECONDARY

1132
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
BARRIERS FOR 16 YEARS.

1133
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
>> Shepard: SECONDARY BARRIERS.

1134
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
>> ANOTHER STEP THAT WOULD KEEP

1135
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
PEOPLE FROM GETTING THROUGH THAT

1136
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
DOOR.

1137
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THERE'S SOME STUFF THAT ARE LIKE

1138
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THAT.

1139
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
THERE'S CHIMES THAT PILOTS CAN

1140
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
USE TO FIND OUT WHO IS COMING

1141
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
IN.
THEY CAN STOP SOMEBODY THAT HAS

1142
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
THE RIGHT CODE FROM COMING IN.

1143
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
THERE ARE BARRIERS.

1144
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
BUT PILOTS THINK IT'S NOT

1145
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
ENOUGH.

1146
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
>> IS UNITED BEEN FULLY

1147
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
FORTHCOMING ON THIS MATTER?

1148
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
>> NO.
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

1149
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
YOU PROBABLY DO, TOO.

1150
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
WHERE WAS THIS STUFF PUBLISHED?

1151
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
IT WAS ON A WEBSITE SOMEWHERE,

1152
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
INADVERTENT.

1153
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WEBSITE.

1154
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
HAS A UNITED EMPLOYEE BEEN

1155
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
GROUNDED OR SUSPENDED?

1156
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
PUNISHED?
WE DON'T KNOW.
HOW INADVERTENTLY -- HOW DO YOU

1157
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
DO THAT?

1158
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
INADVERTENTLY POST SOMETHING.

1159
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
UNITED NATIONS ABOUT YOU BUT I

1160
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
CAN BARELY SIGN ON TO MY

1161
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
COMPUTER.

1162
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
>> BUT IT'S FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1163
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
IF YOU DIDN'T NEED IT, WHY WAS

1164
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

1165
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
>> A GREAT QUESTION, NOT

1166
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
ANSWERED.
>> GET THE SCORPIONS --

1167
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
>> DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE BUNNY.

1168
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
>> Shepard: FRIGHTENING ALMOST.

1169
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
VERY LARGE.

1170
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
FRIGHTENING IN ITS SCOPE.

1171
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
>> SPECIAL AND BIG.

1172
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
>> Shepard: IT WON'T BE THE

1173
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
SAME.

1174
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
>> I KNOW.

1175
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU, GERRI

1176
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
WILLIS.
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, A LOT OF

1177
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
PEOPLE DON'T OWN CARS.

1178
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
MOST PEOPLE I KNOW DON'T.

1179
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
THEY GET AROUND WITH THE SUBWAY

1180
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
OR YELLOW CABS OR SOMETHING.

1181
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
IMAGINE THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY,

1182
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT GAS OR

1183
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
INSURANCE OR PARKING WHICH

1184
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
COSTLY ROUGHLY 17 GAZILLION

1185
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
DOLLARS.

1186
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
A NEW REPORT PREDICTS MORE

1187
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
AMERICANS WILL GIVE UP THEIR

1188
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
CARS.
I MEAN LIKE MOST OF THEM.

1189
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
SOON!
KENNEDY EXPLAINS ME NEXT.

1190
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's just a burst pipe,
I could fix it.

1191
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
(laugh)

1192
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
No.

1193
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
With Claim RateGuard
your rates won't go up

1194
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
just because of a claim.

1195
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I totally could've -

1196
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
No!

1197
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Switching to Allstate
is worth it.

1198
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
>> LOT OF CHANGE IN TEN YEARS.

1199
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
A DECADE AGO, WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

1200
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
iPHONE.

1201
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
BY THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE,

1202
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
WE MAY NOT OWN CARS.

1203
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A GROUP

1204
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
AFFILIATED WITH STANFORD

1205
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
UNIVERSITY.

1206
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
RETHINK X PREDICTS THIS.

1207
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
BY THE YEAR 2030, THE VAST

1208
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
MAJORITY OF US WILL ORDER

1209
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
SELF-DRIVING CARS LIKE THESE ON

1210
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
DEMAND.
BEST PART, THOSE RIDES COULD BE

1211
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
FREE.

1212
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
KENNEDY IS HERE HOST OF

1213
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
"KENNEDY" ON THE FOX BUSINESS

1214
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
NETWORK.
I LIKE A FREE RIDE.

1215
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
>> THE FUTURE IS NOW.

1216
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
THERE'S NO LONGER FUTURESTS.

1217
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
THEY'RE PRESENTISTS BECAUSE FOR

1218
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
DECADES AND GENERATION, THAT'S

1219
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
WHEN WE WOULD SEE THE SHIFT IN

1220
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THE MASSIVE PARADIGMS IN

1221
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
TRANSPORTATION.

1222
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
WHAT WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT

1223
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE CAME TO BE

1224
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO OWN HORSE

1225
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
WOULD BE LIKE NO ONE WILL EVER

1226
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
GIVE UP THEIR HORSE.

1227
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
IT TURNS OUT, THEY WERE WRONG.

1228
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
YOU DON'T SEE TOO MANY FERRIERS

1229
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
NOWADAYS.
>> NOT LIKE FIVE OR TEN YEARS

1230
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
AGO.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1231
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
>> Shepard: THE IDEA HERE IS

1232
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
THIS HAPPENS REALLY FAST.

1233
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
BECAUSE THESE BIG COMPANIES COME

1234
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
IN AND CHANGE THE WAY WE MOVE

1235
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
AROUND.
SAVE US MONEY THAT WE CAN SPEND

1236
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
ON OTHER THINGS.

1237
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
CHANGES THE OIL INDUSTRY, THE

1238
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
AUTO INDUSTRY.

1239
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
>> YES.

1240
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
THEY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WILL BE

1241
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
POWERED BY THE SUN AND POWER

1242
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
PLANTS WHICH WILL BE MOSTLY

1243
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
SOLAR IN 10, 15, 20 YEARS.

1244
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
THAT MEANS THE AUTOMOBILE

1245
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW IT AS WELL

1246
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
AS THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AS WE

1247
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
KNOW IT WILL HAVE TO CHANGE

1248
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
DRASTICALLY.
THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO

1249
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
HAVE TO GET A MOVE ON.

1250
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND SEE

1251
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THESE CHANGES IN ADVANCE IN

1252
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
ORDER TO SURVIVE.

1253
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
BLOCKBUSTER DIDN'T SURVIVE.

1254
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
NETFLIX BECAME A VERTICALLY

1255
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
INTEGRATED STUDIO AND THEY'RE

1256
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
STILL ALIVE TODAY.

1257
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
WHO WILL BE ALIVE WHEN THE NEXT

1258
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
MAJOR SHIFT HAPPENS IN

1259
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION?

1260
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
>> Shepard: SOUNDS LIKE

1261
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
EVERYBODY BUT ME.

1262
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
>> I STILL LOVE A CAR.

1263
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I THINK IN 20 YEARS I'LL BE IN

1264
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
THE MINORITY.

1265
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
A GREAT DRIVER, SHEP.

1266
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
>> Shepard: WHY WOULD THE RIDE

1267
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
BE FREE?
>> THAT'S WISHFUL THINKING ON

1268
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
THE FUTURE IST RIDERS PARTS.

1269
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I THINK THE GOVERNMENT WILL

1270
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
SUBSIDIZE THE AEV.

1271
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
BUT WHEN GOVERNMENT GETS

1272
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
INVOLVED, IT STIFLES INNOVATION.

1273
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
WE WANT FLYING CARS.

1274
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
>> Shepard: WE CAN'T HAVE FLYING

1275
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
CARS.
>> I THINK WE CAN.

1276
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'M AN OPTIMIST.

1277
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I EMBRACE OR ROBOT OVER-LORDS

1278
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
AND ANY FORM THEY TAKE,

1279
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
ESPECIALLY ONE WINGED.

1280
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
>> Shepard: IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

1281
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL CHANGE

1282
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
THAT QUICKLY.

THINK ABOUT THE ACCESS YOU HAVE

1292
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
TO CONTEND, MUSIC AND MOVIES AND

1293
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
EVERYTHING ELSE AND HOW THAT HAS

1294
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
MOVED SO QUICKLY.

1295

1297
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000

>> SO MUCH IT HURTS.

1300
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
That means, I'll get it

1301
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah okay so.

1302
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I can just quit school and get a
job.

1303
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's ok. Daddy's here.

1304
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Daddy.

1305
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Hey.

1306
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Hi.

1307
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Hey buddy

1308

Hey dad

1309
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think we can do this.

1310
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000

What is scary?

1315
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Pneumococcal pneumonia.

1316
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It's a serious disease.

1317
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
My doctor said the risk is
greater now that I'm over 50!

1318
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah...ya-ha...

1319
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Just one dose of the PREVNAR 13®

1320
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
vaccine can help protect you

1321
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
from pneumococcal pneumonia-
an illness that can cause

1322
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
coughing, chest pain,
difficulty breathing,

1323
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and may even put you
in the hospital.

1324
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
PREVNAR 13® is approved for
adults 18 and older to help

1325
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
prevent infections from
13 strains of the bacteria that

1326
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
cause pneumococcal pneumonia.

1327
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
You should not receive
PREVNAR 13® if you have had

1328
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
a severe allergic reaction to
the vaccine or its ingredients.

1329
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
If you have a weakened
immune system,

1330
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
you may have a lower
response to the vaccine.

1331
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
The most common side effects
were pain, redness,

1332
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and swelling at
the injection site,

1333
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000

headache, muscle pain,
joint pain, less appetite,

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
vomiting, fever, chills,
and rash.

1336
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Get this one done!

1337
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Ask about PREVNAR 13®
at your next visit to your

1338
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
doctor's office or pharmacy.

MAIN ROADWAYS.

1360
