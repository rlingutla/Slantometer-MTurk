1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,270
ATLANTIC HURRICANE THIS SEASON  
500 MILES SOUTH OF BERMUDA.     

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,474
NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE LAND.      
I'M SANDRA SMITH.               

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,809
THANKS FOR JOINING US.          
HERE'S SHEP.                    

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:18,150
>> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE    
WEST COAST, 3:00 IN WASHINGTON  

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,119
WHERE ONE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  
CABINET SECRETARIES IS IN       

6
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:25,391
TROUBLE FOR CHARTERING PLANES   
INSTEAD OF FLYING COMMERCIAL.   

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,526
AND IS TOM PRICE GOING TO BE OUT
OF A JOB?                       

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,430
THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE AHEAD. 
WE'LL TAKE YOU TO INDIANAPOLIS  

9
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,833
WHERE MR. TRUMP IS SET TO REVEAL
HIS TAX PLAN THIS HOUR.         

10
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:39,405
THE PROPOSAL, LOWER TAXES FOR   
BUSINESS, FEWER INCOME TAX      

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,341
BRACKETS FOR INDIVIDUALS AND A  
STANDARD DEDUCTION NEARLY       

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,611
DOUBLE.                         
AHEAD, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHO   

13
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:51,083
PAYS WHAT.                      
PLUS, SET BACKS FOR THE         

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,985
PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS
AT THEIR CANDIDATE FAILS IN THE 

15
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,187
ALABAMA PRIMARY.                
IT HAPPENED ON THE SAME DAY     

16
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,824
THEIR HEALTHCARE PLAN COLLAPSED.
NOW WILL THE GOP NEED TO START  

17
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:02,594
WORKING WITH DEMOCRATS?         
COULD THAT HAPPEN?              

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,332
TODAY A CROSS-ROADS FOR         
CONGRESS.                       

19
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:12,071
AND IN PUERTO RICO, HEAVY       
EQUIPMENT COMING IN TO MORE THAN

20
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,573
THREE MILLION AMERICANS THAT    
CALL THE ISLAND HOME.           

21
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,444
WE'LL GO LIVE WITH GERALDO      
RIVERA ABOUT THE RESCUE EFFORTS 

22
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:25,350
AND WHAT THEY NEED THE MOST.    
LET'S GET TO IT.                

23
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,685
GOOD WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON FROM   
THE FOX NEWS DECK.              

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,190
ONE DAY AFTER COMING UP EMPTY ON
HEALTHCARE, AND IN ALABAMA'S    

25
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,660
SENATE RACE, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
TAKING A SWING AT ANOTHER BIG   

26
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,863
TICKET ITEM FROM HIS REPUBLICAN 
WISH LIST.                      

27
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,298
TAXES.                          
A LIVE LOOK IN INDIANAPOLIS.    

28
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,868
THE PRESIDENT ABOUT TO UNVEIL   
HIS TAX PLAN WHICH THE WHITE    

29
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,037
HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS ARE
PUSHING.                        

30
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:49,174
WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE AS THE     
PRESIDENT STARTS TO SPEAK.      

31
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:56,582
WE WOULD REPORT TO YOU HOW YOUR 
HOUSE HOLD WOULD BE AFFECTED IF 

32
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,749
WE COULD.                       
THE PROBLEM IS, THERE'S CRUCIAL 

33
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,752
DETAILS WE DON'T KNOW AND       
PROBABLY WON'T KNOW FOR MONTHS  

34
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,722
BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS TO GET     
THEIR HANDS ON IT.              

35
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,991
DETAILS WHICH COULD HAVE A BIG  
IMPACT ON YOUR MONEY.           

36
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,696
UNDER THE PROPOSAL, THE NUMBER  
OF PERSONAL INCOME TAX BRACKETS 

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:27,279
DROPS FROM SEVEN TO THREE.      
WE DON'T+++                     

38
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,313
INDIVIDUALS AND $24,000 FOR     
FAMILIES.                       

39
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,615
IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF      
INCOME THAT IS TAX-FREE.        

40
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,717
THE WHITE HOUSE AND REPUBLICAN  
LEADERS ARE ALSO CALLING FOR AN 

41
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,219
INCREASED CHILD TAX CREDIT.     
IN ADDITION, THEY SAY THEY WANT 

42
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,489
TO OPEN IT UP TO FAMILIES WITH  
HIGHER INCOMES.                 

43
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:43,462
A NEW TAX CREDIT TO HELP PAY FOR
THE CARE OF ELDERLY AND SICK    

44
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,430
DEPENDENTS.                     
NO MORE ESTATE OR DEATH TAX AT  

45
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,800
ALL, WHICH IS A WIN FOR         
WEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS THAT      

46
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,369
INHERIT BUSINESSES AND REAL     
ESTATE.                         

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,938
THE PLAN WOULD BE A BIG WIN FOR 
BUSINESS OWNERS.                

48
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,242
IT CUTS THE CORPORATE TAX RATE  
FROM 35% DOWN TO 20%.           

49
00:02:57,377 --> 00:03:01,813
AND FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS   
FROM NEARLY 40% TO 25%.         

50
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:06,818
BEFORE HE HEADED TO INDIANA, THE
PRESIDENT SAID THE PLAN FOCUSES 

51
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,455
ON THE MIDDLE CLASS AND NOT THE 
RICH.                           

52
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,826
>> MY PLAN IS FOR THE WORKING   
PEOPLE.                         

53
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:22,868
I DON'T BENEFIT.                
IN FACT, VERY STRONGLY AS YOU   

54
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,538
SEE, THERE'S NO -- I THINK      
THERE'S VERY LITTLE BENEFIT FOR 

55
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,041
PEOPLE OF WEALTH.               
>> THE TOP DEMOCRAT IN THE      

56
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:33,879
SENATE SAYS THAT IS NOT TRUE.   
>> UNDER THIS PLAN THE          

57
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,016
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND        
WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS MAKE OUT

58
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:42,321
LIKE BANDITS WHILE MIDDLE CLASS 
AMERICANS ARE LEFT HOLDING THE  

59
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,723
BACK.                           
>> SENATOR SCHUMER SAID THE PLAN

60
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,527
DIFFERS FROM EVERYTHING THE     
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PROMISING.   

61
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,662
THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE           
CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS LIVE 

62
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,997
ON THE NORTH LAWN.              
HI, JOHN.                       

63
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:55,234
>> SHEP, GOOD AFTERNOON.        
THIS IS THE BIG ONE FOR THE     

64
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,102
PRESIDENT.                      
THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS ELECTION 

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,104
CAMPAIGN.                       
THIS IS WHAT HE PROMISED THE    

66
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,907
NATION.                         
SO HE WANTS TO GET THIS         

67
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,342
DELIVERED.                      
OBAMACARE WAS JUST A STEPPING   

68
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:06,511
STONE ALONG THE WAY.            
BECAUSE THIS IS THE SIGNATURE   

69
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:09,481
PLAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.       
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT 12% IN 

70
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,518
THE LOWEST TAX RATE, THAT IS A  
2% INCREASE FROM WHERE IT       

71
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,621
CURRENTLY IS.                   
IT'S NOW 10%.                   

72
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:20,158
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID IN VARIOUS 
BRIEFINGS, BY THE TIME YOU      

73
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,495
FACTOR IN DEDUCTIONS, THE CHILD 
CARE, THE STANDARD DEDUCTION AND

74
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,800
MORE OF PEOPLE'S MONEY WILL BE  
TAXED AT 0% THAN BEFORE MEANS   

75
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,704
THEY'LL STILL GET A TAX CUT.    
GARY COHN WAS ASKED WHAT THE    

76
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,741
AVERAGE CUT WOULD BE FOR A      
MIDDLE INCOME FAMILY OF FOUR.   

77
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,578
HE SAID HE THOUGHT, DON'T TOLD  
ME TO IT, BUT ABOUT $1,000.     

78
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,582
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THE     
PRESIDENT WAS PUSHING FOR HERE  

79
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,485
ALMOST MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, 
A CUT IN THE CORPORATE TAX RATE.

80
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,055
HE TALKED THROUGH THE ELECTION  
CAMPAIGN ABOUT 15%.             

81
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,025
SAID 15, MAYBE 20.              
AT SOME POINTS.                 

82
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,662
I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT TODAY,   
WHETHER 20% WAS A RED LINE OR   

83
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:01,900
COULD IT GO UP FROM THERE.      
HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.         

84
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:06,905
>> IS A 20% RATE A RED LINE?    
>> VERY MUCH A RED LINE.        

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,542
>> WHAT ABOUT 15%?              
>> I WANTED TO START AT 15 TO   

86
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,379
GET 20.                         
IT JUST -- THE NUMBERS WERE --  

87
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,082
15 WAS SO LOW WE DIDN'T TAKE IN 
THE REVENUE.                    

88
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,686
I WANTED 15, SO WE GOT 20.      
20 IS MY NUMBER.                

89
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,023
I'M NOT NEGOTIATING THAT NUMBER.
I'M NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE.     

90
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,658
>> INTERESTING WHAT THE         
PRESIDENT SAID THERE.           

91
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:33,065
HE WANTED 15 BUT THEY COULDN'T  
RAISE THE REVENUE WITH 15 SO HE 

92
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,567
AGREED ON 20.                   
WE'LL SEE HOW HARD HE IS WILLING

93
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:40,605
TO PUSH ON THE RED LINE.        
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN THE PAST, 

94
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,208
I DON'T SET RED LINES BUT IN    
THIS CASE HE HAS.               

95
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,378
IN TERMS OF THE WEALTHY AND     
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WOULD BE A 

96
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,682
FOURTH TAX RATE, GARY COHN WAS  
TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY SAYING 

97
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:56,722
THIS WOULD BE FOR THE VERY TOP  
INCOME EARNERS, FEWER THAN 1%.  

98
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,325
STEVE BANNON WAS TALKING ABOUT  
PEOPLE MAKING MORE THAN $5      

99
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,095
MILLION A YEAR.                 
HE WANTED THE RATE TO START WITH

100
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,897
A FOUR.                         
COHEN SAID IT MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE

101
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:10,268
AROUND 36, 37%, SHEP.           
WITH ALL OF THE ELIMINATION OF  

102
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,504
DEDUCTIONS, THAT MEANS EVEN     
THOUGH THE TAX RATE WOULD BE    

103
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:17,943
LOWER FROM 39 1/2, THE VERY TOP 
EARNERS WOULD PAY MORE THAN     

104
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:22,514
THEY'RE PAYING NOW.             
>> Shepard: JOHN, BEFORE THE    

105
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:30,589
PRESIDENT TOOK OFF ON HIS       
SPEECH, PRESIDENT SAID HE WASN'T

106
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:37,562
HAPPY WITH HIS SECRETARY OF     
HOMELAND.                       

107
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,133
BUT FIRST THE BACK STORY.       
POLITCO BROKE THIS STORY LAST   

108
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,668
WEEK.                           
IT REPORTED THAT TOM PRICE      

109
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,505
CHARTERED JETS FOR OFFICIAL     
BUSINESS AT LEAST TWO DOZEN     

110
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,241
TIMES SINCE MAY.                
SINCE THEN, THE DEPARTMENT'S    

111
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,444
INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THE HOUSE 
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HAVE        

112
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,981
LAUNCHED INVESTIGATIONS.        
SATURDAY, SECRETARY PRICE TOLD  

113
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,785
FOX NEWS THAT HE WELCOMED THE   
REVIEW AND WON'T FLY PRIVATE    

114
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,622
UNTIL IT'S OVER.                
THE SECRETARY SAID THAT HE      

115
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:08,827
REALIZES "THE OPTICS IN SOME OF 
THIS DON'T LOOK GOOD."          

116
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:14,866
WHAT WILL HAPPEN HERE?          
>> IF I WAS TOM PRICE, I'D BE   

117
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:15,967
WORRIED.                        
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DIDN'T    

118
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,903
LIKE IT.                        
HE TALKED TO TOM PRICE ABOUT IT 

119
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,406
AND SAID HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.     
HE'S BEEN ANGRY BEFORE.         

120
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,110
HE WAS ANGRY AT JEFF SESSIONS   
AND MADE UP FOR IT.             

121
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,814
LISTEN TO HOW THE PRESIDENT     
PHRASED IT WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT 

122
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,616
PRICE'S USE OF PRIVATE PLANES.  
LOOK AT IT.                     

123
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:36,588
>> I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT.       
I'LL TELL YOU, I'M NOT HAPPY    

124
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:41,827
WITH IT.                        
>> WILL YOU FIRE HIM, SIR?      

125
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,331
HE CAVALIERLY SAID WE'LL SEE.   
SHEP, HE HAD THAT LOOK ABOUT    

126
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,866
HIM.                            
I DON'T KNOW IF TOM PRICE WANTS 

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,068
TO LOOK AT MOVING BACK TO       
ATLANTA OR NOT.                 

128
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,605
I WOULD SAY THE WRITING IS ON   
THE WALL.                       

129
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,942
>> JOHN, HOURS AFTER REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS FAILED TO GET SOMETHING 

130
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,745
DONE ON HEALTHCARE YESTERDAY,   
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CHOICE FOR    

131
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,949
ALABAMA'S SENATE SEAT LOST.     
WE HAVE A PHOTO HERE ON THE LEFT

132
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:09,387
IN THIS PHOTO, ROY MOORE, THE   
CONSERVATIVE FORMER CHIEF       

133
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,656
JUSTICE OF ALABAMA'S SUPREME    
COURT.                          

134
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,127
YESTERDAY HE DEFEATED LUTHER    
STRANGE IN A REPUBLICAN         

135
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,396
REASON-OFF.                     
MORE HAS CALLS ISLAM A FALSE    

136
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,566
RELIGION.                       
HE SAID THE ATTACKS OF 9-11 WERE

137
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,636
PUNISHMENT FROM MOVING AWAY FROM
GOD.                            

138
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:32,010
IN 2003, HE SAY GAY SEX IS A    
CRIME AGAINST NATURE.           

139
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:36,348
TWO YEARS AGO, HE INSTRUCTED    
JUDGES IN ALABAMA TO DEFY A     

140
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,185
SUPREME COURT RULING AND INSTEAD
ENFORCED THEIR MINISTERIAL DUTY 

141
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:44,422
BY REFUSING TO ISSUE SAME SEX   
MARRIAGE LICENSES.              

142
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,627
ROY MOORE IS EXPECTED TO DEFEAT 
THE DEMOCRAT AND WIN THE SET    

143
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,365
THAT JEFF SESSIONS LEFT EMPTY.  
LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS COMES DAYS 

144
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:58,336
AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT DOWN 
TO ALABAMA TO STUMP FOR LUTHER  

145
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,339
STRANGE.                        
A PRO MITCH McCONNELL SUPER PACT

146
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,076
DUMPED MILLIONS IN ALABAMA TO   
TRY TO KEEP MOORE FROM WINNING. 

147
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,579
IN ANOTHER BLOW TO THE          
REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, ONE OF

148
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:12,551
SENATOR McCONNELL'S ALLIES BON  
CORKER ANNOUNCED HE WILL NOT RUN

149
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,621
FOR RE-ELECTION NEXT YEAR.      
AGAIN TO JOHN ROBERTS.          

150
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,691
BUSY DAYS.                      
>> YEAH, ALWAYS IS, SHEP.       

151
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:24,863
THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED        
AGGRESSIVELY ON BEHALF OF LUTHER

152
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,532
STRANGE.                        
STEVE BANNON WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR

153
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,268
ROY MOORE.                      
THE REASON HE WAS, HE THOUGHT   

154
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,638
ROY MOORE WOULD BE A BETTER ALLY
OF THE PRESIDENT THAN STRANGE.  

155
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:38,610
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CAMPAIGNING  
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, HE WAS   

156
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:43,348
CAMPAIGNING ON HIS BEHALF.      
THE PRESIDENT TELEPHONED ROY    

157
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,217
MOORE TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND   
SAID HE LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING

158
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,187
WITH HIM.                       
INTERESTING TO SEE THAT CORKER  

159
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,058
WON'T RUN FOR RE-ELECTION NEXT  
YEAR.                           

160
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,628
CORKER SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS   
NOT DEMONSTRATED THE STABILITY  

161
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,931
OR CONFIDENCE TO BE PRESIDENT.  
STEVE BANNON WAS PLANNING TO    

162
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:03,101
MOUND A PRIMARY CHALLENGE       
AGAINST CORKER.                 

163
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,272
SO SENATOR CORKER DECIDED HE'S  
GOING TO PLAY GOLF OUTSIDE OF   

164
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:12,077
CHATTANOOGA AT THE HONORS CLUB  
AFTER 2018 AS OPPOSED TO RUNNING

165
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,846
FOR RE-ELECTION.                
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN.       

166
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,350
AFTER HIS LATEST HEALTH CARE    
LOSS, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S   

167
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,286
WILLING TO NEGOTIATE MORE WITH  
DEMOCRATS TO COME UP WITH A     

168
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,390
BETTER BILL AND PERHAPS A SIGN  
OF THINGS TO COME.              

169
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,727
TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP TRAVELED  
WITH A DEMOCRAT TO HIS TAX PLAN 

170
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,030
EVENT IN INDIANAPOLIS.          
INDIANA SENATOR JOE DONNELLY    

171
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,833
JOINING THE PRESIDENT ON AIR    
FORCE ONE.                      

172
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,836
OUR CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL         
CORRESPONDENT MIKE EMANUEL IS ON

173
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,171
CAPITOL HILL.                   
WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS SAYING ABOUT 

174
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,341
THIS TAX PLAN?                  
>> DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WOULD LIKE

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,944
TO GET THE TAX CODE IMPROVED,   
FIXED.                          

176
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,480
THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEAS       
THEY'RE HEARING IN THE          

177
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,549
BLUEPRINT.                      
FOR EXAMPLE, LOWERING THE TOP   

178
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,654
RATE FROM 39.6% TO 35% FOR UPPER
INCOME AMERICANS.               

179
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,989
>> WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS TALKING
ABOUT THIS PLAN OVER THE LAST   

180
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:02,794
FEW DAYS, HE TALKED ABOUT       
FOCUSING ON THE MIDDLE CLASS AND

181
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:06,831
NOT HELPING THE WEALTHY.        
THE PLAN IS A MAJOR             

182
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,267
DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE IT SO    
DEVIATES FROM EVERYTHING THE    

183
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:13,571
PRESIDENT SAID.                 
>> WHAT HAS BEEN RELEASED TODAY 

184
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:19,010
MAKES A TOTAL MOCKERY OUT OF THE
PRESIDENT'S PLEDGE THAT HE      

185
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,782
WANTED TAX RELIEF TO BE FOR THE 
WORKING CLASS AND IT WOULDN'T BE

186
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,651
FOR THE WEALTHY.                
>> TOP DEMOCRATS NOTE THE       

187
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,621
PRESIDENT SAID THE RICH WOULD   
NOT BENEFIT FROM TAX REFORM.    

188
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,425
AND THEY ARE ACCUSING REPUBLICAN
LEADERS HERE ON CAPITOL HILL OF 

189
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,793
BREAKING THAT PROMISE.          
SHEP?                           

190
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,862
>> Shepard: ARE THERE ANY SIGNS,
MIKE, THE TWO SIDES ARE WILLING 

191
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,266
TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS?       
>> BOTH SIDES SAY THEY WANT TO  

192
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,302
GET IT DONE NO SURPRISE THEY    
COME AT IT FROM DIFFERENT       

193
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,438
PERSPECTIVES.                   
BOTTOM LINE, TOP REPUBLICANS ARE

194
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:50,809
SAYING THEY WOULD LIKE DEMOCRATS
AS A PART OF THE DEBATE, A PART 

195
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,611
OF THE CONVERSATION.            
NOTING THIS IS A CRITICAL       

196
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,779
PRIORITY FOR THE AMERICAN       
PEOPLE.                         

197
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,951
>> INSTEAD OF A SOURCE OF PRIDE,
OUR TAX CODE HAS BECOME A       

198
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,088
CONSTANT SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION. 
IT'S TOO BIG.                   

199
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,659
IT'S TOO COMPLICATED.           
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.             

200
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:11,629
TODAY WE ARE TAKING THE NEXT    
STEP TO LIBERATE AMERICANS FROM 

201
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,733
OUR BROKEN TAX CODE.            
>> I THINK WE CAN, BUT WE'RE    

202
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,968
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE SOME      
DEMOCRAT HELP.                  

203
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,638
I THINK WE HAVE TO SET ASIDE THE
DIFFERENCES AND WORK TOGETHER.  

204
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,809
>> WORKING TOGETHER, OF COURSE, 
HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE HERE ON    

205
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,979
CAPITOL HILL IN RECENT TIMES.   
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE SOME      

206
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,751
COMMON GROUND THEY CAN FIND ON  
FIXING THE TAX CODE, SHEP.      

207
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,488
>> Shepard: THANKS, MIKE.       
WE'LL GO LIVE TO INDIANAPOLIS AS

208
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,423
THE PRESIDENT LAYS OUT HIS TAX  
PLAN.                           

209
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,292
IS IT TIME FOR REPUBLICANS TO   
COME UP WITH A NEW STRATEGY TO  

210
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,728
GET THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA      
PASSED?                         

211
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,464
WHAT MIGHT IT BE?               
THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX   

212
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,100
NEWS DECK ON THIS WEDNESDAY     
AFTERNOON.                      

213
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:49,601
GREAT TO HAVE YOU IN.           

214
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,657
   I'll have the langoustine    
        lobster ravioli.        

215
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:53,691
         For you, sir?          

216
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,794
       The original call        

217
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,630
  was for langoustine ravioli.  

218
00:14:58,665 --> 00:14:59,664
         A langoustine          

219
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,099
   is a tiny kind of lobster.   

220
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,268
   A slight shellfish allergy   
        rules that out,         

221
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,169
      plus my wife ordered      
        the langoustine.        

222
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,572
  I will have chicken tenders   
        and tater tots.         

223
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,041
    <i> If you're a ref, you way</i>   
      <i> over-explain things.</i>     

224
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,309
       <i> It's what you do.</i>       

225
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,111
  <i> If you want to save fifteen</i>  
<i>percent or more on car insurance</i>

226
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,279
      <i> you switch to GEICO.</i>     

227
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,381
 Sir, we don't have tater tots. 

228
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,483
       <i> It's what you do.</i>       

229
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,518
      I will have nachos!       

230
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,197
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS  
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SPEECH ABOUT 

231
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,733
HIS NEW TAX PLAN.               
THE PRESIDENT IS ESSENTIALLY ON 

232
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:42,307
TIME AND SHOULD WE WILL CARRY IT
LIVE ANY MOMENT NOW.            

233
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,476
THIS COMES A DAY AFTER THE      
REPUBLICANS SUFFERED ANOTHER    

234
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,813
HEALTHCARE LOSS.                
SOME SAY REPUBLICANS AND        

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,784
DEMOCRATS NEED TO WORK TOGETHER 
TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING.        

236
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:57,355
WILL THAT HAPPEN?               
HERE'S JOHN BUSSEY.             

237
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,758
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON    
HEALTHCARE, THAT'S A NONSTARTER.

238
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,295
WHAT ABOUT ON TAXES?            
>> IT'S A NONSTARTER WITH THIS  

239
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,597
PARTICULAR HEALTHCARE BILL.     
TRUMP HAS TO BE LOOKING AT THIS 

240
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,901
AND SAYING, IT'S NOT A GREAT    
WEEK.                           

241
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,971
THE HEALTHCARE BILL DIDN'T GET A
VOTE.                           

242
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:18,776
HIS CANDIDATE LOST IN ALABAMA.  
THE CANDIDATE IN ALABAMA RAN    

243
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:24,115
AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT, WHICH
WAS DONALD TRUMP'S ZONE.        

244
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,951
SO HE'S LOOKING AT THIS AND JUST
ABOUT TO LAY OUT HIS TAX PLAN.  

245
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,989
WE HAVE THE DETAILS.            
>> Shepard: NOT MANY.           

246
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,258
>> WE HAVE THE OVERALL SCOPE BUT
NOT THE DETAILS.                

247
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,994
HE'S PROBABLY THINKING TO       
HIMSELF, IF WE'RE GOING TO WORK 

248
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,596
WITH THE DEMOCRATS, NOW IS THE  
TIME TO BE DOING IT.            

249
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,132
>> Shepard: I WAS TALKING THIS  
MORNING AND THE SUGGESTION WAS  

250
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:45,269
SAID YOU SHOULD LAY IT OUT.     
IF YOU MAKE THIS, THIS IS HOW IT

251
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,505
WILL CHANGE FROM WHERE YOU WERE 
BEFORE.                         

252
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,076
THOSE DETAILS DON'T EXIST.      
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SECOND  

253
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,378
TAX BRACKET IS.                 
WE DON'T KNOW.                  

254
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,414
>> THAT'S RIGHT.                
VIEWERS WILL PROBABLY NOT FIND  

255
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,549
OUT IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE.   
WE KNOW THE OVERALL SCOPE.      

256
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,986
IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WAS         
CAMPAIGNED ON.                  

257
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,391
SIMPLIFYING THE TAX CODE, REDUCE
THE NUMBER OF BRACKETS TO 3 OR 4

258
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,794
FROM 7.                         
REDUCE TAXES FOR COMPANIES, FOR 

259
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,797
INDIVIDUALS, FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO
OWN BUSINESSES.                 

260
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,134
ALL THAT SOUNDS GOOD.           
BUT THE SORT OF THE OTHER SIDE  

261
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,704
OF THE EQUATION HASN'T BEEN     
ADDED UP YET.                   

262
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,074
>> Shepard: HOW YOU PAY FOR IT. 
>> HOW YOU PAY FOR IT.          

263
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,712
HOW YOU FUND THE GOVERNMENT,    
REDUCE THE DEBT WITH CUTTING    

264
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,781
TAXES THIS MUCH IF THIS GOES    
THROUGH.                        

265
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:34,952
YOU KNOW, CORPORATE TAX CUT FROM
35% TO 20, 1 TO 15.             

266
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:39,924
MAYBE IT UNDER UP AT 25.        
STILL A SUBSTANTIAL CUT IN      

267
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,393
REVENUE.                        
THE ARGUMENT IS BEING MADE, IT  

268
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,563
WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.       
WHY?                            

269
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,533
CUTTING COMPANY TAXES AND YOURS 
AND MY TAXES IF THAT'S WHAT     

270
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,636
HAPPENS RESULTS IN ECONOMIC     
GROWTH BECAUSE THAT MONEY GETS  

271
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,907
INVESTED IN THE ECONOMY.        
THAT IS A BIG ROLL OF THE DICE. 

272
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,141
>> Shepard: WE'VE HEARD THAT    
BEFORE.                         

273
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,378
HAS IT WORKED IN THE PAST?      
>> WE HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE.     

274
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,182
THE REGAN ERA PROVED IT TO BE   
TRUE.                           

275
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,886
IT STIMULATES TAXES.            
>> Shepard: HIGH TAXES UNDER    

276
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,122
REAGAN.                         
>> THAT, TOO.                   

277
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:17,862
AN UNEVEN ECONOMIC GROWTH BASED 
ON A LOT OF FACTORS.            

278
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,832
NOT JUST WHETHER COMPANIES HAVE 
MORE TO INVEST AND YOU AND I DO.

279
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:25,236
>> Shepard: THERE'S MIXED       
REPORTING ON ROY MOORE IF HE    

280
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,074
DEFEATS THE DEMOCRAT WHICH HE IS
EXPECTED TO DO, IF HE WILL BE   

281
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,376
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP OR AGAINST 
HIM.                            

282
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,913
>> SO YOU'D THINK STRIKE.       
BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP         

283
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:40,451
CAMPAIGNED FOR HIS OPPONENT.    
LUTHER STRANGE IN THE ELECTION. 

284
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,054
SO DID McCONNELL.               
MOORE RAN AS AN ANTI            

285
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:46,724
ESTABLISHMENT CANDIDATE, WHICH  
SEEMS TO BE DONALD TRUMP'S      

286
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,627
TERRITORY.                      
HE RAN AGAINST McCONNELL, HE RAN

287
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,498
AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION.     
HE SAID I'M YOUR GUY.           

288
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,034
AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME, ONE  
KIND OF ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE    

289
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,038
THAT STEVE BANNON IS RIGHT.     
WHICH IS AT THE END -- STEVE    

290
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,109
BANNON THAT SUPPORTED MOORE AND 
SAYS WE'RE GOING TO DO MORE OF  

291
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,379
THIS.                           
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT AGAINST THE

292
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:11,782
ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICAN        
HIERARCHY BY ELECTING NEW       

293
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,251
REPUBLICANS.                    
HE MAY BE RIGHT.                

294
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,255
MOORE COMES IN AS SORT OF AN    
ANTI ESTABLISHMENT,             

295
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,025
ANTI-WASHINGTON CANDIDATE WHICH 
ALIGNS HIMSELF PERHAPS WITH     

296
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,728
TRUMP'S AGENDA MORE CLEARLY.    
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 

297
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,099
SAID I'LL WORK WITH HIM.        
HE SAID IT ON HIS STUMP IN      

298
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,469
ALABAMA.                        
IF ROY MOORE WINS, WE'LL WORK   

299
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,571
TOGETHER.                       
>> BY THEN WILL HE HAVE TO BE   

300
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,207
WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THE   
DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS.              

301
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,177
>> Shepard: WHAT DOES THIS SAY  
MORE ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT AND

302
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,546
MITCH McCONNELL AND THE MACHINE 
THAT THAT IS.                   

303
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,784
>> BAD WEEK FOR DONALD TRUMP.   
WORSE LAST FEW DAYSOR F         

304
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,455
L.NNEL                          
IT WAS THE LATEST ITERLATION OF 

305
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,359
THE HEALTHCARE BILL NOT GETTING 
PASSED.                         

306
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,495
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN.       
>> THANK YOU.                   

307
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:02,133
>> Shepard: HURRICANE MARIA LEFT
PARTS OF PUERTO RICO IN RUINS.  

308
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,237
THERE'S NEW VIDEO OF THE        
DEVASTATION IN POOREST          

309
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,172
NEIGHBORHOODS.                  
MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE    

310
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,474
THERE ARE HOMELESS.             
THEY'RE AMERICANS THAT LOST SO  

311
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,778
MUCH TO THIS STORM.             
WE'LL TAKE YOU LIVE TO PUERTO   

312
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,414
RICO.                           
WE'LL MEET UP WITH GERALDO THAT 

313
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,250
IS ON HOW THE MILITARY IS       
STEPPING IN TO HELP.            

314
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:23,654
WE'RE WAITING FOR PRESIDENT     
TRUMP'S BIG -- MUCH ANTICIPATED 

315
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,756
TAX SPEECH THAT IS COMING FROM  
INDIANAPOLIS.                   

316
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,559
WE'RE EXPECTING THAT MOMENTS    
FROM NOW.                       

317
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:32,630
WE'LL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE ON     
AMERICA'S CHOICE FOR NEWS AND

eligibility?                    

320
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:39,563
Don't put off checking out your 
Medicare options until 65.      

321
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,233
Now is a good time to get the   
ball rolling.                   

322
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,235
Medicare only covers about      
eighty percent of               

323
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,903
Part B medical costs.

326

insured by UnitedHealthcare     
Insurance Company come in.      

327

328
00:21:56,783 --> 00:22:00,184
they could help save you in     
out-of-pocket medical costs.    

329
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:03,521
Taking informed steps really    
makes a difference later.

IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA.       

341
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:57,301
WE WAIT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO  
LAY OUT HIS PROPOSED TAX PLAN.  

342
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,371
THAT EVENT SCHEDULED TO START IN
A FEW MINUTES.                  

343
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,341
WE'RE LED TO BELIEVE IT WAS     
BEGIN PRESENTLY.                

344
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:11,382
WE'LL HAVE IT LIVE WHEN THE     
PRESIDENT STARTS TO SPEAK.      

345
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,552
SOME IN PUERTO RICO SAY THEY    
HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE GOVERNMENT

WORKER SINCE HURRICANE MARIA    
DEVASTATED THE IDEA COME TO

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,458
THEIR AREA.                     
SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE WAITING 

348
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:25,062
AND WAITING FOR CLEAN WATER AND 
FOOD.                           

349
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:29,967
THIS IS CATANYO.                
A TOWN OUTSIDE SAN JUAN.        

350
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,870
MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE ARE
HOMELESS.                       

351
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,640
ONE WOMAN TOLD GARRETT TENNEY   
RED CROSS WORKERS CAME BY A     

352
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,910
COUPLE DAYS AGO AND PROMISED    
FOOD AND WATER BUT SO FAR NOBODY

353
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,780
HAS RETURNED.                   
FEMA OFFICIALS SAY IT'S VERY    

354
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,416
DIFFICULT TO GET AID TO SOME    
AREAS BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF  

355
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,219
THE DAMAGE.                     
THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS   

356
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:53,324
SENDING THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL 
SERVICE MEMBERS TO HELP.        

357
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:59,163
FOX NEWS' GERALDO RIVERA IS LIVE
IN SAN JUAN.                    

358
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,799
GERALDO?                        
>> PART OF THE PROBLEM IS, I    

359
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:05,402
DON'T THINK UNTIL MAYBE THIS    
MORNING THE PRESIDENT, THE      

360
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,439
CABINET AND THE ENTIRE AMERICAN 
GOVERNMENT UNDERSTOOD THE       

361
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,742
MAGNITUDE OF THIS DISASTER.     
THEY HAVE BEEN SENDING IN AID.  

362
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,879
IT'S BEEN TRICKLING IN.         
WE SAW THE PORT LAST NIGHT, THE 

363
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,749
PORT OF SAN JUAN, OPERATING WHAT
SEEMED TO BE MINIMAL CAPACITY.  

364
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:23,220
EVEN THE AIRPORT, WHICH IS JUST 
BEHIND THE CAMERA DOES NOT SEEM 

365
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,591
ANYTHING LIKE THE ACTIVITY YOU'D
EXPECT IN THE BERLIN AIRLIFT.   

366
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,294
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THIS 
IS PUERTO RICO'S KATRINA.       

367
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:38,435
THIS IS A GENERALIZED DISASTER. 
WE FOUND MY FATHER'S YOUNGEST   

368
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,472
SIBLING.                        
ONE OF THE LAST SURVIVING OF MY 

369
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,375
FATHER'S BIG FLOCK.             
HE'S ONE OF 17 SIBLINGS.        

370
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:49,980
WE FOUND HER IN A DARKENED HOUSE
LAST NIGHT WITH A TREE THROUGH  

371
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:54,885
THE ROOF AND ANOTHER TREE       
BLOCKING THE STREETS.           

372
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,187
I HAVE NOT SEEN NUMBERS OF      
FEDERAL OFFICIALS OUT WILL DOING

373
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:02,192
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THIS  
ISLAND IN CRISIS, THIS ISLAND IN

374
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,396
DIRE STRAITS.                   
YOU MENTIONED THE UNITED STATES 

375
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,331
MILITARY.                       
THE FLEET HAS ARRIVED OFF THE   

376
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:12,503
EASTERN SIDE.                   
WE TOOK A HELICOPTER OUT TO THE 

377
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:17,141
AIRCRAFT CARRIER YET.           
THEY'RE MUSTERING HELP FOR THE  

378
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:23,380
PEOPLE ASHORE WHERE THEY CAN    
LOCATE AREAS OR SPECIFIC        

379
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:27,084
LOCATIONS WHERE THEIR EXPERTISE 
IS NEEDED.                      

380
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:32,022
WE SAW ONE OF THE LOCATIONS IN A
CITY ON THE EASTERN END OF      

381
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,025
PUERTO RICO.                    
THE RIDER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,    

382
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,729
WHICH HAD BEEN DECIMATED BY THE 
HURRICANE.                      

383
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:45,836
HURRICANE MARIA SWEPT THROUGH   
THIS AND RENDERED THE HOSPITAL  

384
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:51,275
INOPERABLE.                     
THE MARINES AND THE NAVY CBs DID

385
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,444
LAND TODAY.                     
THE EMERGENCY GENERATOR, THEY   

386
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,946
WORKED AT IT, WORKED AT IT AND  
TRIED TO START IT.              

387
00:26:56,081 --> 00:27:00,284
THEY TRIED TO START IT.         
FINALLY THAT EMERGENCY GENERATOR

388
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:05,289
KICKED IN, PROVIDING MUCH-NEEDED
POWER TO THE HOSPITAL IN NEED.  

389
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:10,327
THE ADMINISTRATORS OF THE       
HOSPITAL WERE BEYOND GRATEFUL,  

390
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,632
SHEP.                           
>> I CAN'T EVEN EXPRESS THE JOY.

391
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:18,602
I'M SPEECHLESS, EXCEPT I WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS     

392
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:23,907
LISTENING TO US KNOWS HOW       
GRATEFUL, HOW THANKFUL WE ARE   

393
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:28,746
FOR EVERYTHING, EVERY PERSON,   
EVERY RESOURCE, EVERYBODY THAT  

394
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,617
WE KNOW ARE WORKING AROUND THE  
CLOCK TO HELP US.               

395
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,854
HELP WE NEED.                   
WE ARE GETTING UP.              

396
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,224
WE HAVEN'T CLOSED OUR DOORS.    
WE ARE JUST SO GRATEFUL.        

397
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:47,197
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
AMERICA.                        

398
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:55,205
>> THAT GRATITUDE IS            
HEART-RENDERING AND TOUCHING.   

399
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,543
BUT THE SCALE OF THE ASSISTANCE 
THEY'RE RECEIVING DOESN'T MATCH 

400
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,546
THE SCALE OF THIS DISASTER,     
SHEP.                           

401
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,216
>> Shepard: I KEEP WONDERING    
ABOUT THE POORER COMMUNITIES    

402
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,386
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN REPORTS.   
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, WE DON'T 

403
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,223
KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE GETTING THE
FOOD AND THE WATER AND THINGS   

404
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,192
THAT THEY NEED.                 
DO YOU KNOW?                    

405
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,695
>> THEY ARE NOT.                
THEY ARE NOT.                   

406
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:23,167
YOU KNOW, WHAT COMES IN ON A    
C-130, THESE CASES OF WATER OR  

407
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:27,705
THESE MREs, THE MEALS READY TO  
EAT DOESN'T BEGIN TO MATCH WHAT 

408
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,742
THIS POPULATION NEEDS.          
THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN CRUSHED.  

409
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,478
THERE IS NO INFRASTRUCTURE.     
THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY.         

410
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,782
THE FRUSTRATION OF TRYING TO GET
A CELL PHONE TO WORK ON THIS    

411
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,984
ISLAND.                         
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE GET SO USED TO 

412
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,687
THE INTERNET.                   
THERE IS NO INTERNET HERE EXCEPT

413
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:49,026
MAYBE IN THIS HOTEL OR THAT     
HOTEL.                          

414
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,364
THE NEED IS SO PROFOUND.        
THE NEED IS REALLY SO           

415
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:58,435
WIDESPREAD.                     
I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT IS

416
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,938
HOPEFUL.                        
WE NEED THAT PORT OPEN.         

417
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,840
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE    
JONES ACT.                      

418
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:07,578
THE JONES ACT PREVENTS SHIPS    
THAT BEAR A FOREIGN FLAG FROM   

419
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,747
TRANSPORTING GOODS OF THE       
MAINLAND TO THE UNITED STATES TO

420
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,883
PUERTO RICO, WHICH IS CONSIDERED
PART OF THE MAINLAND OF THE     

421
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,786
UNITED STATES.                  
THEY HAVE TO BE ON U.S.-FLAGGED 

422
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,423
MERCHANT VESSELS.               
THE JONES ACT MUST BE SUSPECTED.

423
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:23,360
EVERY VESSEL AVAILABLE MUST BE  
USED TO BRING FUEL OIL.         

424
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,096
THERE'S A SIX-HOUR WAIT AT GAS  
STATIONS STILL.                 

425
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:29,199
THE PEOPLE ARE RUNNING          
GENERATORS SO THEY HAVE TO STAY 

426
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,469
ONLINE.                         
THEY RUN OUT OF GAS IN THEIR    

427
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,874
CARS WAITING TO GET GAS TO FUEL 
THEIR GENERATORS.               

428
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:43,113
I THINK IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC  
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE    

429
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,249
FOLKS.                          
THE HOSPITALS ARE DOING         

430
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,017
HERCULEAN WORK TO MAKE THEM     
WELL.                           

431
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:52,389
WHAT WE NEED ARE PEOPLE TO PUT  
UP TELEPHONE POLES, CELL PHONE  

432
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,660
TOWERS, TO GET THE ELECTRIC GRID
WORKING.                        

433
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,362
70% WAS ALREADY OUT FROM        
HURRICANE KATRINA.              

434
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,563
WE NEED GENERATORS.
