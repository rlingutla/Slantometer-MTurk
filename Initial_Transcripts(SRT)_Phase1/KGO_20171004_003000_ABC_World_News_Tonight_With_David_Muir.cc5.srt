BAGS AND LIKELY PASSING A SIGN

JUST LIKE THIS.
BUT PADDOCK DIDN'T JUST BRING IN

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A FIREARM.
HE BROUGHT AN ARSENAL.

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THAT'S STUCK WITH THEM FOREVER.

362
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> THE SURGEON TOLD US THAT BOTH

363
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO

364
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
BE OKAY.

365
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AND THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO THOSE

366
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
DOCTORS AND NURSES.
AND AS FOR SHELDON, HE WANTS TO

367
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
MEET THAT HERO WHO WAS RIGHT

368
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THERE BY HIS SIDE.

369
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HERO WAS
GRAZED BY A BULLET, TOO, BUT IS

370
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
NO LONGER AT THE HOSPITAL.

371
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
SO, IF THAT HERO IS WATCHING

372
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
TONIGHT, SHELDON'S FAMILY WANTS

373
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
TO THANK YOU.

374
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>>> WE TURN NOW TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP, IN PUERTO RICO TODAY,

375
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
MEETING WITH OFFICIALS INCLUDING

376
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN.

377
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SHE WENT ON LIVE TV, BEGGING THE

378
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
ADMINISTRATION FOR HELP, AND HE
THEN TOOK AIM AT HER ON TWITTER.

379
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
HE ALSO TWEETED OF PUERTO RICO,

380
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
"THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE FOR

381
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THEM."

382
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WHAT HIS MESSAGE WAS TODAY WHEN

383
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HE LANDED THERE.

384
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL FROM

385
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
PUERTO RICO.

386
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
>> Reporter: THERE'S NEVER BEEN

387
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO A
DISASTER ZONE QUITE LIKE THIS

388
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ONE.

389
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
AT A CHURCH IN SAN JUAN,

390
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOSSED PAPER

391
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
TOWELS TO HURRICANE VICTIMS AS

392
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
IF HE WERE PLAYING BASKETBALL.

393
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
>> THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE IN THIS

394
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
ROOM.
>> Reporter: SITTING RIGHT NEXT

395
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
TO PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR, HE

396
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
TOUTED THE DEATH COUNT AS IF HE

397
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WERE KEEPING SCORE.

398
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> IF YOU LOOK AT A REAL

399
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
CATASTROPHE LIKE KATRINA, AND

400
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
YOU LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND

401
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT DIED,

402
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
WHAT IS YOUR DEATH COUNT AS OF
THIS MOMENT, 17?

403
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
>> 16 CERTIFIED.

404
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
>> 16 PEOPLE, CERTIFIED.
16 PEOPLE VERSUS IN THE

405
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THOUSANDS.

406
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
YOU CAN BE VERY PROUD.
>> Reporter: AND EVEN AS HE

407
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
TALKED UP THE FEDERAL RECOVERY

408
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
EFFORT --

409
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
>> THE WHOLE TEAM HAS BEEN
AMAZING.

410
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
>> Reporter: -- THE PRESIDENT

411
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
COULDN'T HELP BRINGING UP THE

412
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
HIGH COST.

413
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
>> I HATE TO TELL YOU,

414
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
PUERTO RICO, BUT YOU'VE THROWN
OUR BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF

415
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WHACK.

416
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
>> Reporter: ALSO IN THE ROOM,

417
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, WHO THE
PRESIDENT HAS SLAMMED

418
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
RELENTLESSLY ON TWITTER FOR

419
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
SAYING PUERTO RICO NEEDS MORE

420
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THAN IT'S GETTING.

421
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
>> HOW ARE YOU?

422
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> SIR.
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT SAVING LIVES,

423
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICS.

424
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> Reporter: AFTERWARDS, THE

425
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
MAYOR CALLED THE MEETING

426
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
PRODUCTIVE.
BUT ON CNN, SHE DISMISSED THE

427
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
PRESIDENTIAL VISIT AS PUBLIC

428
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
RELATIONS.

429
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
>> RATHER THAN COMMANDER IN

430
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
CHIEF, HE SORT OF BECOMES

431
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
MISCOMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF.

432
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
>> Reporter: BUT NOT FAR FROM

433
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THERE, WE MET UP WITH HECTOR

434
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
GARCIA.
HE HAD NO IDEA THE PRESIDENT WAS
ON THE ISLAND, BUT HE TELLS US,

435
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
HE'S HAPPY HE'S HERE.

436
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
"HE CAME HERE," GARCIA TOLD US,

437
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
"BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'RE IN

438
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
CRISIS."

439
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
DAVID, THE GOVERNOR'S BEING

440
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
DIPLOMATIC TONIGHT.

441
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
HE SAYS HE APPRECIATES THE
PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND HIS

442
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
COMMITMENT TO THE ISLAND OF
PUERTO RICO.

443
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
HE WANTS TO SEE RELIEF EFFORTS

444
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
CONTINUE, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE

445
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THE U.S. NAVAL HOSPITAL SHIP

446
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
"COMFORT" BEHIND ME.
THIS JUST GOT HERE TODAY, TWO

447
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
WEEKS AFTER THE STORM HIT THE

448
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ISLAND.
DAVID?

449
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> JON KARL, OUR THANKS TO YOU

450
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
TONIGHT.

451
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
>>> AND WE WANT TO LET EVERYONE

452
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
AT HOME KNOW THAT WE WERE IN

453
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
PUERTO RICO OVER THE WEEKEND,

454
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
WHEN THE SHOOTING BROKE OUT HERE

455
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
IN LAS VEGAS.

456
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
AND BEFORE WE LEFT TO COME HERE,

457
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
WE HAD GONE TO A NEIGHBORHOOD,
JUST A SHORT DRIVE FROM WHERE

458
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS TODAY.

459
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE

460
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
HURRICANE, WE DISCOVERED

461
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
FAMILIES IN SWELTERING HEAT, NO

462
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
POWER, NO RUNNING WATER -- AND A

463
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
CALL FOR HELP.

464
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
WE WENT LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT

465
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
BUILDING, JUST 15 MINUTES FROM

466
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THE AIRPORT IN SAN JUAN.

467
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
BECAUSE WE HAD HEARD THAT NEARLY

468
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE HURRICANE

469
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
HIT, THEY WERE STILL WITHOUT
POWER AND WITHOUT RUNNING WATER.

470
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
WE WALK UP THIS DARKENED

471
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
STAIRWELL AND DOWN THE HALLWAY.

472
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
LIZBETH?

473
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
LIZBETH VAZQUEZ DELGADO LIVES IN

474
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
NEW YORK CITY, BUT SHE IS HERE,

475
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
TAKING CARE OF HER PARENTS.

476
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
THE PRESIDENT HAD TWEETED JUST

477
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
DAYS AGO, ALL BUILDINGS NOW

478
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
INSPECTED.

479
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
AND WE WONDERED, HAVE THEY SEEN
ANY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS OR ANY

480
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HERE?

481
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WE HAD HEARD THAT INSPECTORS HAD

482
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
BEEN VISITING SOME OF THESE

483
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
BUILDINGS, ALL OVER PUERTO RICO.

484
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INSPECTORS?

485
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
>> NO.
NOT AT ALL.

486
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
THEY HAVE NOT COME TO SEE WHAT'S

487
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
HAPPENED TO THESE APARTMENTS.

488
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
>> Reporter: NO ONE HAS COME?

489
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> NO ONE HAS COME.

490
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> Reporter: AND HOW MUCH FOOD
AND WATER HAVE THEY BROUGHT?

491
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
>> NONE.

492
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
>> Reporter: NOTHING?

493
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
>> NONE AT ALL.

494
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
>> Reporter: AND WITH NO POWER,

495
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
NO CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

496
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
CAN YOU DRINK THE WATER?

497
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
>> NO, WE CANNOT.
AT ALL.

498
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
>> Reporter: INSIDE HER PARENTS'

499
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
TINY APARTMENT, THEIR WINDOWS
STILL BLOWN OUT BY HURRICANE

500
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
MARIA.

501
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
AND IN THE BEDROOM, HER PARENTS,

502
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ELMER AND GLORIA, ON THE BED IN

503
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
NEED OF MEDICATION.

504
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY ANY

505
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
DOCTOR HAD PAID A VISIT.

506
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE?

507
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
>> THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE.

508
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
>> Reporter: AND IT'S MOTRIN.

509
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
>> I HAD A PIECE OF BREAD, HALF

510
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
OF BREAD AND I SHARED IT WITH,

511
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
LIKE, FOUR APARTMENTS.
>> Reporter: DOWN THE HALLWAY,

512
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WE SEE OTHER RESIDENTS, SOME

513
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
CARRYING FLASHLIGHTS.

514
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
AND WE HEAD INTO ONE OF THOSE
APARTMENTS, WHERE WE MEET A

515
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WOMAN LIZBETH HAS BEEN SHARING

516
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
HER BREAD AND WATER WITH.

517
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
MARIA DIAZ IS 70, AND SHE TELLS

518
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
US, SHE'S BEEN DRINKING THE

519
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
WATER FROM THE FAUCET, EVEN

520
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THOUGH SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT SAFE.

521
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
SHE HOLDS AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF

522
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
WATER.

523
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
TELLING US IT COST $6.

524
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
WITH LITTLE FOOD AND NO CLEAN

525
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
WATER, SHE IS PANIC-STRICKEN,

526
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
TELLING ME, "I DON'T WANT TO DIE
HERE."
IN SO MANY OF THESE APARTMENT

527
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
BUILDINGS, THEY ARE UNAWARE OF

528
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
THE FEMA HELP, BECAUSE THEY HAVE

529
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
NO POWER, NO ACCESS TO THE NEWS.

530
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
AND TONIGHT, JUST 7% OF THE

531
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
ISLAND HAS POWER BACK.

532
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
THIS BUILDING DOES NOT.
A GENERATOR IS TURNED ON A

533
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
COUPLE OF HOURS A NIGHT.
AND WE WALK UP THE STAIRS,

534
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
KNOWING THERE ARE 13 STORIES IN

535
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
THIS BUILDING.

536
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
AGAIN, THEY TELL US, NO FOOD.

537
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
DOWN THE HALL, YOU CAN SEE THE

538
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
DESTRUCTION THROUGH THE WINDOW.

539
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000

00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
SOME OF HIS MOST FAMOUS SONGS.

563
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
A LOT MORE NEWS AHEAD.

564
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Your body was made for better
things than

565
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
rheumatoid arthritis.

566
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Before you and your
rheumatologist move to another

567
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
treatment, ask if XELJANZ is
right for you.

568
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
XELJANZ is a small pill for
adults with

569
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
moderate to severe RA for whom
methotrexate did not work well.

570
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
XELJANZ can reduce joint pain
and swelling in as little as

571
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
two weeks, and help stop further
joint damage.

572
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
XELJANZ can lower your ability
to fight infections,

573
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
including tuberculosis.

574
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections, lymphoma and other

575
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
cancers have happened.

576
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't start XELJANZ if you have
an infection.

577
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Tears in the stomach or
intestines, low blood cell

578
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
counts and higher liver tests
and cholesterol levels have

579
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
happened.

580
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Your doctor should perform blood
tests before you

581
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
start and while taking XELJANZ,
and monitor certain liver tests.

582
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Tell your doctor if you were in
a region where fungal

583
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
infections are common and if you
have had TB,

584
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
hepatitis B or C, or are prone
to infections.

585
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
XELJANZ can reduce the symptoms
of RA,

586
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
even without methotrexate, and
is also available

587
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
in a once-daily pill.

588
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ask about XELJANZ XR.

589
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So my dentist toldell,
bume about this...!

590
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Go Pro with Crest HD.

591
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Crest HD cleans and whitens my
teeth to eye-popping levels.

592
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Crest HD. 6x cleaning,
6x whitening.

593
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000

impressed the dentist.

594
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You for four years.

595
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You named it Brad.

596
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You loved Brad.

597
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And then you totaled him.

598
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You two had been through
everything together.

599
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Two boyfriends, three jobs...

600
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you're like
nothing can replace Brad.

601
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000

from our eyes every day.

657
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I should know.

658
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I have Chronic Dry Eye

659
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
caused by reduced
tear production

660
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
due to inflammation.

661
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I use RESTASIS MultiDose®.

662
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It helps me make more
of my own tears,

663
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
with continued use,

664
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
twice a day, every day.

665
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's also what I prescribe
to my patients

666
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
who have this condition.

667
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
RESTASIS MultiDose®

668
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
helps increase your
eyes' natural ability

669
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to produce tears,

670
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
which may be reduced
by inflammation

671
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
due to Chronic Dry Eye.

672
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
RESTASIS MultiDose® did
not increase tear production

673
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
in patients using
anti-inflammatory eye drops

674
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
or tear duct plugs.

675
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
To help avoid eye injury
and contamination,

676
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
do not touch the bottle tip
to your eye or other surfaces.

677
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Wait 15 minutes after use

678
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
before inserting
contact lenses.

679
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The most common side effect

680
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000

burning sensation.
