00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
FOR THOSE THEY COULDN'T REACH.

185
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
>> I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
MAY NOT GET TO EVERYBODY IN

187
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TIME.

188
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
AND THAT IS A GREAT WEIGHT ON MY

189
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SHOULDERS.

190
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
>> Reporter: SHE'S AMONG THOSE

191
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
WHO WILL FIND THEIR HOMES AND
NEIGHBORHOODS DEVASTATED, BUT

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
FOR NOW SHE CAN'T THINK OF THAT.

193
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SHE CAN ONLY THINK OF KEEPING

194
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HER CITY TOGETHER.
>> WE NEED EACH OTHER.

195
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I NEED THEM MORE THAN THEY NEED
ME.

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
>> Reporter: A FEELING SHARED
AMONG MANY HOLDING ON TO EACH

197
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
OTHER FOR STRENGTH IN WHAT'S TO

198
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
COME.
AND A VERY GRIM REALITY FOR SOME

199
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING

200
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
TO BE LEAVING THIS SHELTER AFTER

201
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
24 HOURS.
MANY OF THEM ARE GOING TO FIND

202
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THEIR HOMES IN RUIN, AND THEY'RE

203
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
GOING TO HAVE TO COME BACK TO

204
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SHELTERS LIKE THIS TO SPEND

205
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ANOTHER NIGHT, ANOTHER WEEK AND

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
POSSIBLY EVEN MONTHS.

207
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
LESTER?

208
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> GADI SCHWARTZ, SOME OF THAT

209
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
DAMAGE IS INCREDIBLE, THANK YOU.

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
>>> THIS HURRICANE THREAT IS FAR
FROM OVER.

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
WE'RE JOINED HERE BY AL ROKER

212
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHO IS TRACKING THE STORM.
WHAT'S THE LATEST?

213
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
AND IS THE U.S. EAST COAST IN

214
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
JEOPARDY?

215
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> IT'S STILL UP IN THE AIR

216
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
RIGHT NOW.

217
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WE CAN TELL YOU THAT MARIA IS A

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CATEGORY 2 BUT WILL PROBABLY

219
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
REINTENSIFY LATER THIS EVENING.

220
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
75 MILES EAST OF PUNTA CANA,

221
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

222
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
IT'S MOVING NORTHWEST AT 12,

223
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
WITH 110-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.

224
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TOMORROW

225
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
GETS ABOUT 75 MILES PER HOUR.

226
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
4 TO 6 FEET OF SURGE, 8 TO 16

227
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
INCHES OF RAIN.

228
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
TURKS AND CAICOS MAY BE THE NEXT

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
REALLY BIG DEVASTATED AREA WITH

230
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
125-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS, A STORM

231
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
SURGE OF 9 TO 12 FEET AND 9 TO

232
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
16 INCHES.

233
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
AND THEN IT CONTINUES UP INTO

234
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THE ATLANTIC BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON.

235
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
WE PUT THE ENSEMBLE MODEL INTO

236
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
PLAY.

237
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
YOU SEE THOSE SPAGHETTI STRANDS

238
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
WE CALL.
AND BASICALLY FOR THE MOST PART

239
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THEY KEEP IT OFF THE COAST, BUT

240
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S SOME
DISAGREEMENT ON THE WESTERN SIDE

241
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
OF THIS.
SO LESTER, RIGHT NOW WE STILL

242
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
CAN'T GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE

243
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
ANSWER WHETHER THIS THING STAYS

244
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
OFF SHORE OR NOT.

245
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
>> WE'LL KEEP WATCHING.

246
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
AL ROKER, THANKS VERY MUCH.

247
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO THAT OTHER

248
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
MAJOR DISASTER STILL UNFOLDING
AT THIS HOUR.

249
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
IN CENTRAL MEXICO, HUNDREDS ARE

250
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
DEAD, THOUSANDS ARE STILL

251
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
MISSING AFTER THAT DEVASTATING

252
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
7.1 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE STRUCK

253
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THERE.

254
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
NOW A DESPERATE SEARCH IS ON FOR

255
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
SURVIVORS AT SITES THAT INCLUDE

256
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
A SCHOOL THAT COLLAPSED WITH

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
STUDENTS INSIDE.

258
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
NBC'S MIGUEL ALMAGUER IS THERE

259
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
AND HAS THE LATEST.

260
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MIGUEL, GOOD EVENING.
>> Reporter: LESTER, GOOD

261
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
EVENING.
THEY ARE ASKING US TO WHISPER

262
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
BECAUSE IT APPEARS THEY HAVE

263
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
DONE IT AGAIN.

264
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
TWO RESCUES MIGHT BE UNDER WAY

265
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
RIGHT NOW AT THIS HOUR AT THAT

266
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
SCHOOL YOU MENTIONED.

267
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THEY'RE LISTENING FOR SIGNS OF
LIFE.

268
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
DOZENS OF BODIES HAVE BEEN
RECOVERED THERE, BUT DOZENS HAVE

269
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ALSO BEEN SAVED.

270
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THE DEATH TOLL STANDS AT 225 AND

271
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
GROWING, BUT THIS IS A SIGN OF

272
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
HOPE.

273
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
TONIGHT, THIS IS THE

274
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
HEART-POUNDING DRAMA PLAYING OUT

275
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ACROSS MEXICO CITY.

276
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
RESCUE TEAMS AT AN ELEMENTARY

277
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SCHOOL FINDING CHILDREN BURIED

278
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BENEATH PILES OF DEBRIS.

279
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ONE BY ONE, PULLING THEM TO

280
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
SAFETY.

281
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THIS WAS THE SCHOOL BEFORE.

282
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
NOW LITERALLY FLATTENED.

283
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THEY CALL THIS THE MIRACLE IN

284
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THE RUBBLE.

285
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE CRISIS STILL UNFOLDING

286
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
TODAY.

287
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
JUST MOMENTS AFTER THE CHEERS --

288
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
>> SILENCIO.

289
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> Reporter: FISTS GO UP, THE

290
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000

SEARCH TEAMS CAN FAINTLY HEAR A

292
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
NEW CRY FOR HELP.

293
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THIS TIME TWO LITTLE GIRLS

294
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
RESCUED.

295
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THIS SEARCH COMMANDER SAYS HE

296
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
HAS CHILDREN OF HIS OWN.

297
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THESE KIDS ARE MY FAMILY.

298
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I WANT TO BRING THEM HOME.

299
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
BUT MORE THAN 20 STUDENTS HERE

300
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
DIDN'T MAKE IT.

301
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
LUIS CARLOS SAYS HE HAS NO IDEA

302
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
HOW HE GOT OUT.

303
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I SAW THE WHOLE SCHOOL FALL

304
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
DOWN, BUT I NEVER FOUND MY

305
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
FRIENDS.

306
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ACROSS THIS SHATTERED COUNTRY,

307
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THERE IS MORE HEARTBREAK THAN

308
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
DEBRIS.

309
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
THESE ARE THE FACES OF ANGUISH.
