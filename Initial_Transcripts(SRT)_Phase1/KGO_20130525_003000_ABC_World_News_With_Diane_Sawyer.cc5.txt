[000:03:01;514] >> CAR IMMEDIATELY STARTS
[000:03:02;682] FILLING WITH WATER, AND THAT WAS
[000:03:03;850] THE POINT WHERE, YOU KNOW, I
[000:03:04;551] KIND OF THOUGHT I MIGHT BE A
[000:03:06;819] GONER, YOU KNOW, THAT MIGHT BE
[000:03:07;587] IT FOR ME.
[000:03:09;088] >> Reporter: DAN SLIGH AND HIS

[000:03:11;124] AT THE SAME TIME.
[000:03:12;625] HE DISLOCATED HIS SHOULDER ON
[000:03:13;393] IMPACT.
[000:03:14;394] >> I COULDN'T SEAT MY WIFE IN
[000:03:15;094] THE PASSENGER SEAT.
[000:03:16;663] I ASKED HER IF SHE WAS OKAY.
[000:03:17;797] SHE WASN'T RESPONDING.
[000:03:21;067] POPPED MY SHOULDER BACK IN SO I
[000:03:21;834] COULD UNBUCKLE EVERYTHING AND
[000:03:22;602] GET OVER TO HER.
[000:03:23;503] >> Reporter: THIS ISN'T THE
[000:03:24;671] FIRST BRIDGE TO FAIL WITH
[000:03:26;906] TERRIFYING RESULTS.
[000:03:29;909] THE 2007 COLLAPSE OF THE
[000:03:31;344] MINNEAPOLIS I-35 BRIDGE KILLED
[000:03:32;111] 13 PEOPLE.
[000:03:33;613] AND IN 2009, CRACKS AND
[000:03:34;781] CORROSION ON A BOSTON BRIDGE
[000:03:37;016] SENT ROCKS RAINING DOWN ON A
[000:03:38;718] WOMAN'S WINDSHIELD.
[000:03:44;190] INVESTIGATORS HERE SAY A
[000:03:46;659] SEMI-TRUCK CARRYING AN OVERSIZED
[000:03:49;362] LOAD GASHED THROUGH A STEEL BEAM
[000:03:50;997] AND LIKELY TRIGGERED THIS
[000:03:51;664] COLLAPSE.
[000:03:54;300] BUT THE BRIDGE IS OLD, TOO,
[000:03:55;034] BUILT IN 1955 WITH A PILE OF
[000:03:55;768] MEDIOCRE INFRASTRUCTURE RANKINGS
[000:03:56;502] AND RECENT REPAIRS.
[000:03:57;136] ONE THING INVESTIGATORS BEEN
[000:03:57;837] LOOKING AT ALL DAY IS THAT CLEAN
[000:03:59;405] BREAK OVER THERE.
[000:04:01;107] IT'S ALMOST AS IF THAT CHUNK OF
[000:04:02;275] BRIDGE JUST SNAPPED RIGHT OFF.
[000:04:06;646] THE INVESTIGATION, THOUGH, WILL
[000:04:08;815] TAKE MONTHS TO COMPETE AND IN
[000:04:10;383] THE MEANTIME, GOING INTO THIS
[000:04:11;985] HOLIDAY WEEKEND, TRAFFIC IS
[000:04:12;919] ALREADY BEGINNING TO BACK UP.

[000:04:43;182] FROM THAT SCARE FOR DRIVERS TO A
[000:04:43;983] SCARE IN THE AIR.
[000:04:45;318] THIS IS WHAT PASSENGERS ON BOARD
[000:04:47;553] A BRITISH AIRWAYS FLIGHT SAW OUT
[000:04:48;354] THEIR WINDOW.
[000:04:48;921] SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF.
[000:04:50;023] SMOKE POURING FROM THE ENGINE.
[000:04:54;127] THEIR QUICK-THINKING PILOTS
[000:04:54;861] FORCED TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY
[000:04:55;561] LANDING.
[000:04:56;529] TONIGHT, ABC'S NICK SCHIFRIN,
[000:04:57;263] WITH THE PASSENGERS WHO
[000:04:57;930] WITNESSED IT ALL RIGHT THROUGH
[000:04:58;665] THEIR WINDOWS.
[000:05:00;967] >> Reporter: RIGHT AFTER
[000:05:02;101] TAKEOFF, A HARROWING SIGHT.
[000:05:05;405] FLIGHT 762'S ENGINE WAS ON FIRE.
[000:05:06;539] IT HAD SUFFERED A MAJOR
[000:05:09;342] TECHNICAL FAULT OR WAS STRUCK BY
[000:05:10;109] BIRDS.
[000:05:13;212] INSIDE THE CABIN, JON CHAPLIN
[000:05:16;549] LOOKED OUT HIS WINDOW.
[000:05:17;250] THE LEFT ENGINE FLAP HAD BLOWN
[000:05:18;318] OFF.
[000:05:18;951] >> LOUD BOOM AND THEN THERE WAS
[000:05:22;722] ORANGE COLORS FILLING THE CABIN.
[000:05:24;457] SO THAT WAS QUITE SCARY.
[000:05:25;124] >> Reporter: THE RIGHT ENGINE,
[000:05:25;892] CONSUMED BY FLAME, NOW USELESS.
[000:05:26;859] DID YOUR HEART SKIP A FEW BEATS?
[000:05:29;062] >> YEAH.
[000:05:31;364] IT'S -- IT'S -- YOU GET A BIT
[000:05:32;532] PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT IT AND
[000:05:34;233] WONDER IF THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.
[000:05:38;204] >> Reporter: THE PILOT FLEW LOW,
[000:05:38;971] BACK TOWARD THE AIRPORT.
[000:05:41;374] WHEN HE LANDED SAFELY --
[000:05:43;042] [ APPLAUSE ]
[000:05:45;244] BUT THEN JON HAD TO EVACUATE.
[000:05:47;747] HE SLID OUT AN EMERGENCY EXIT,
[000:05:48;481] HIS HANDS TREMBLING SO MUCH, HE
[000:05:49;248] COULD BARELY HOLD HIS CAMERA
[000:05:49;982] STEADY.
[000:05:50;416] >> THERE WERE PEOPLE THROWING UP
[000:05:52;952] AS WE GOT OFF THE PLANE, ON THE
[000:05:55;054] GRASS AND THEY WERE CRYING AND
[000:05:56;923] HYSTERICS.
[000:05:59;158] >> Reporter: HE CAN'T FORGET THE
[000:05:59;926] MOMENT WHEN HE TRIED TO CALL HIS
[000:06:00;693] WIFE.
[000:06:01;094] >> I WAS THINKING BACK TO THE
[000:06:01;828] PHONE CALLS FROM 9/11, ACTUALLY,
[000:06:02;695] AND HOW MOVING SOME OF THOSE
[000:06:03;463] MESSAGES WERE.
[000:06:07;166] AND I WONDERED IF I WOULD BE THE
[000:06:07;934] ONE LEAVING A MESSAGE.
[000:06:08;968] >> Reporter: JON TOLD ME HE'LL
[000:06:10;903] TOAST THE PILOT, BECAUSE IT
[000:06:11;604] COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.

[000:16:44;703] OF DYING.
[000:16:45;671] 1 IN 100.
[000:16:48;974] THE QUESTION IS, HOW DOES THIS

[000:17:18;070] McDONALD'S.
[000:17:18;704] IN A MOMENT HERE, YOU'LL HEAR
[000:17:19;938] HER CHALLENGING THE CEO, RIGHT
[000:17:20;839] TO HIS FACE.
[000:17:21;440] AND SHE'S MAD ABOUT MORE THAN
[000:17:22;307] JUST THE BIG MAC.
[000:17:23;008] YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR THIS, AFTER
[000:17:23;909] THE BREAK.
[000:17:25;144] THE BREAK.
[000:17:27;012] of store management started as
[000:17:27;012] ere over seve percent
[000:17:29;782] hourly associates. There's
[000:17:29;782] opportunity here. I can use
[000:17:33;786] Walmart's education benefits to
[000:17:33;786] get a degree, Maybe work in IT,
[000:17:39;024] Or be an engineer, helping
[000:17:39;024] Walmart conserve energy. Even
[000:17:42;594] today, when our store does well,
[000:17:42;594] I earn quarterly bonuses. When
[000:17:46;565] people look at me, I hope they
[000:17:46;565] see someone working their way
[000:17:48;867] up. VO: Opportunity, that's the
[000:17:48;867] real Walmart.
[000:17:56;108] ACCOMPLISHING EVEN LITTLE THINGS
[000:17:57;843] CAN BECOME MAJOR VICTORIES.
[000:17:59;411] I'M PHIL MICKELSON, PRO GOLFER.
[000:18:02;014] WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED
[000:18:02;014] WITH PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS,
[000:18:04;316] MY RHEUMATOLOGIST

[000:18:19;364] AND ALLERGIC REACTIONS
[000:18:19;364] HAVE OCCURRED.
[000:18:21;400] BEFORE STARTING ENBREL,
[000:18:22;734] YOUR DOCTOR SHOULD TEST YOU
[000:18:22;734] FOR TUBERCULOSIS
[000:18:24;703] AND DISCUSS WHETHER
[000:18:24;703] YOU'VE BEEN TO A REGION
[000:18:26;371] WHERE CERTAIN FUNGAL INFECTIONS
[000:18:26;371] ARE COMMON.
[000:18:28;006] YOU SHOULD NOT START ENBREL
[000:18:29;274] IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION
[000:18:29;274] LIKE THE FLU.
[000:18:30;576] TELL YOUR DOCTOR

[000:18:43;522] IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS
[000:18:43;522] THAT MEAN THE MOST.
[000:18:46;291] ASK YOUR RHEUMATOLOGIST

[000:20:23;188] AND THAT'S NOT ALL SHE SAID.
[000:20:23;889] >> SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK

[000:21:18;343] WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
[000:21:18;343] TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.
[000:21:21;380] STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
[000:21:21;380] EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.
[000:21:24;349] BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,
[000:21:25;751] STAYING ACTIVE
[000:21:25;751] CAN BE DIFFICULT.
[000:21:27;853] PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX

[000:21:30;522] SO YOUR BODY

[000:21:48;407] AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.
[000:21:50;342] YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
[000:21:50;342] SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS

[000:22:03;555] THIS CHANCE INCREASES

[000:22:05;390] OR RISK FACTORS
[000:22:05;390] SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
[000:22:07;659] OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
[000:22:07;659] FOR LONG PERIODS.
[000:22:09;761] NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,
[000:22:11;330] INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS

[000:22:13;632] PROBLEMS,

[000:26:34;926] MIRACLE, IS HOW SO MANY OTHERS
[000:26:35;827] GOT OUT.
[000:26:36;361] MOST EVERYTHING THERE IS GONE.
[000:26:37;295] BUT WE NOTICED
[000:26:38;496] MRS. MARINELLI'S FIRST GRADE
[000:26:39;397] CLASSROOM IN TACT.
[000:26:40;098] THE SCHOOLWORK RIGHT THERE ON
[000:26:40;999] THE DESK WHERE IT WAS LEFT.
[000:26:41;800] AND JUST BEFORE THAT TORNADO
[000:26:43;168] HIT, THEY WERE WRITING WHAT THEY
[000:26:44;336] LIKED MOST ABOUT THEIR TEACHER.
[000:26:46;605] I WILL REMEMBER SHE GAVE ME
[000:26:47;572] CUPCAKES.
[000:26:49;207] THEY WERE REMEMBERING, BECAUSE
[000:26:50;342] THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS
[000:26:51;710] LEFT OF SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR.
[000:26:54;613] WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN THE
[000:26:56;815] TORNADO HIT, SHE HAD HER
[000:26:58;083] CHILDREN SINGING IN THE HALLWAY,
[000:27:00;352] TRYING TO DISTRACT THEM.
[000:27:01;319] AND IN THE CLASSROOM NEXT DOOR,
[000:27:03;054] WE WERE SURPRISED TO MEET MISS
[000:27:05;290] DOMINICK, ALREADY BACK PICKING
[000:27:06;191] UP THE PIECES.
[000:27:06;891] SHE TAUGHT THE AUTISTIC
[000:27:07;692] CHILDREN.
[000:27:08;259] SHE SAID MANY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
[000:27:09;294] WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
[000:27:10;929] BUT SHE HAD THE PRESENCE OF
[000:27:11;763] MIND TO PULL OUT HER iPAD TO
[000:27:12;597] HAVE THEM TEXT MESSAGE THEIR
[000:27:13;465] PARENTS.
[000:27:14;966] EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WOULDN'T
[000:27:16;301] GO THROUGH.
[000:27:17;602] BUT SHE KNEW IT WOULD CALM THEM.
[000:27:20;405] WHAT DID THEY WANT TO SAY?
[000:27:21;239] >> THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY MOM,
[000:27:22;140] COME GET ME, OR, YOU KNOW, I
[000:27:22;974] WANT TO GO HOME.
