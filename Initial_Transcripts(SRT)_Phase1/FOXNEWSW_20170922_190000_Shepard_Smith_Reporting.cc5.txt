[000:01:37;680] HEALTHCARE PLAN IS NOW ONE VOTE
[000:01:38;915] AWAY FROM COLLAPSE.
[000:01:40;984] AFTER THE REPUBLICAN SENATOR
[000:01:42;152] JOHN McCAIN ANNOUNCED HE CANNOT
[000:01:43;486] SUPPORT THE BILL.
[000:01:45;722] THE EDITION SO SIGS DESPITE THE
[000:01:47;223] FACT ONE OF ITS CO-SPONSORS IS
[000:01:51;127] HIS CLOSEST FRIEND IN THE

[000:01:55;098] SENATOR McCAIN BROKE THE NEWS
[000:01:56;366] HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:01:57;267] WARNED HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS TO
[000:01:58;868] VOTE YES.

[000:02:07;644] KNOWN AS THE REPUBLICAN WHO
[000:02:08;912] SAVED OBAMACARE.
[000:02:11;381] KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL WAS
[000:02:13;049] THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO COME OUT
[000:02:14;017] AGAINST THE BILL.
[000:02:14;984] HIS REASONING, IT DOESN'T GO FAR
[000:02:17;353] ENOUGH TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE
[000:02:18;288] CARE ACT.
[000:02:19;255] NOW WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM
[000:02:20;723] THE OTHER TWO REPUBLICANS WHO

[000:02:27;564] CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER
[000:02:30;733] MIKE OMANUAL.
[000:02:31;167] >> WITH SENATOR JOHN McCAIN BEAK
[000:02:32;202] A NO ON THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY PLAN
[000:02:34;737] THERE'S INTENSE PRESSURE TO LOCK
[000:02:36;339] DOWN ALL OTHER REPUBLICAN
[000:02:37;006] SENATORS.
[000:02:38;508] MAINE SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS SAID
[000:02:40;743] HE'S LEANING AGAINST SUPPORTING
[000:02:42;145] THIS GRAHAM-CASSIDY LEGISLATION.
[000:02:44;814] COLLINS IS ONE OF THE NO VOTES
[000:02:48;885] ON HEALTHCARE REFORM IN JULY.
[000:02:50;887] THERE WAS PRESIDENT TO SUPPORT
[000:02:51;888] WITH IT HER GOVERNOR AND
[000:02:53;022] VICE PRESIDENT PENCE URGING HER
[000:02:53;756] TO GET ONBOARD.
[000:02:55;325] >> WE'RE ENCOURAGING SENATOR
[000:03:00;230] CAIN, BUT ESPECIALLY ENCOURAGING
[000:03:01;030] SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS.
[000:03:01;598] TO JOIN US IN THIS EFFORT.
[000:03:05;134] TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF MAINE, THE
[000:03:06;936] GOVERNMENT OF MAVINE THE
[000:03:11;507] FLEXIBILITY TO IMPROVE THE LIVES
[000:03:12;575] AND THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE OF
[000:03:13;576] MAINE.
[000:03:14;811] >> IF COLLINS OR ALASKA'S LISA
[000:03:19;249] MURKOWSKI SAY THEY'RE AGAINST
[000:03:20;316] GRAY WHOM-CASSIDY LEADERSHIP DUS
[000:03:21;951] VENLT VOTES TO PASS IT.
[000:03:24;320] MURKOWSKI WAS NO ON THE SKINNY
[000:03:26;723] REPEAL BILL IN JULY, SO-CALLED.
[000:03:28;558] PRESIDENT REPUBLICAN SOURCES
[000:03:31;060] HOPE THIS TEAM WOULD BE
[000:03:32;362] DIFFERENT IF FOR NO OTHER REASON
[000:03:33;563] THAN JOHN McCAIN'S BEST FRIEND
[000:03:35;231] IN THE WORLD IS LINDSAY GRAHAM,
[000:03:36;866] AUTHOR OF THE BILL.
[000:03:39;035] >> Shepard: WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
[000:03:39;769] FROM DEMOCRATS?
[000:03:40;770] >> THEY'RE VOI VOWING TO
[000:03:42;705] CONTINUE THE FIGHT, PRAISING
[000:03:44;073] SENATOR McCAIN FOR STANDING UP
[000:03:45;408] AND STOPPING THIS BILL.
[000:03:47;076] BOTTOM LINE, A NUMBER OF
[000:03:48;244] DEMOCRATS SAY THEY PISH THE
[000:03:57;020] BIPARTISAN TALKS TO TRY TO FIX
[000:03:57;754] OBAMACARE WERE CONTINUING.
[000:03:58;421] >> I FELT LIKE WE WERE MAKING
[000:03:59;155] STEADY PROS TOWARD A BIPARTISAN
[000:04:00;556] COMPROMISE TO ADDRESS THE
[000:04:02;725] CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS WITH
[000:04:03;860] OBAMACARE REPEAL.
[000:04:06;396] THERE'S AN AN ABRUPT HALT BY THE
[000:04:07;897] REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE WILL
[000:04:09;332] HAVE A VOTE THIS COMING WEEK ON
[000:04:10;667] THIS BILL.
[000:04:12;702] I HAVE CONCERNS HOW IT WILL
[000:04:14;037] AFFECT DELAWARE AND THE COUNTRY
[000:04:15;605] AND I PLAN TO VOTE AGAINST IT.
[000:04:17;774] >> MITCH McCONNELL INTENDS TO
[000:04:20;043] BRING UP GRAHAM-CASSIDY NEXT
[000:04:22;045] WEEK BUT THAT WAS BEFORE HE HAD
[000:04:24;247] TWO HARD NO VOTES AGAINST THE
[000:04:26;149] BILL.
[000:04:26;449] >> MIKE EMMANUEL, THANKS.
[000:04:29;018] >> Shepard: CHRIS WALLACE,
[000:04:30;486] MODERATOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY."
[000:04:32;622] JOHN McCAIN GAVE HIS REASONS.
[000:04:33;856] LAST TIME AROUND, HE MADE A
[000:04:36;793] PRETTY CLEAR STATEMENT WHEN HE
[000:04:38;895] WAS THAT DRAMATIC VOTE FOR NO.
[000:04:41;297] WE HAVE A FULL SCREEN OF THAT
[000:04:43;099] I'D LIKE TO SHOW THE VIEWING
[000:04:43;900] AUDIENCE.
[000:04:44;600] HERE IT IS.
[000:04:48;972] THIS IS WHAT HE SAID LAST TIME.
[000:04:49;806] THE CONGRESS MUST NOW RETURN TO
[000:04:50;540] REGULAR ORDER.
[000:04:51;007] HOLD HEARINGS.
[000:04:51;441] RECEIVE INPUT FROM MEMBERS OF
[000:04:52;208] BOTH PARTIES.
[000:04:53;910] AND HEED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF
[000:04:55;645] OUR NATION'S GOVERNORS SO THAT
[000:04:57;246] WE CAN PRODUCE A BILL THAT
[000:04:59;949] FINALLY PROVIDES AMERICANS WITH
[000:05:01;718] ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE
[000:05:02;485] HEALTHCARE.
[000:05:03;386] THAT PART OF IT HADN'T CHANGED,
[000:05:04;954] THOUGH THIS IS TECHNICALLY
[000:05:05;955] REGULAR ORDER IT WASN'T.
[000:05:08;558] COMMITTEES HAD MET ON IT, AND
[000:05:10;093] THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
[000:05:11;661] HADN'T MARKED IT UP.
[000:05:12;829] >> EXACTLY RIGHT.
[000:05:14;063] THE COMMITTEES HAVE NOT MET ON
[000:05:14;864] IT.
[000:05:16;132] THEY'LL HOLD ONE OR TWO HEARINGS
[000:05:17;333] THIS NEXT WEEK.
[000:05:18;634] SIMPLY, I THINK, TRYING TO
[000:05:20;837] SATISFY JOHN McCAIN,nd SOME
[000:05:22;839] OTHERS WHO SAID THIS IS A HECK
[000:05:24;841] OF A WAY TO COMPLETELY REFORM
[000:05:29;012] THE HEALTH SYSTEM, ONE-SIXTH OF
[000:05:30;313] THE ECONOMY.
[000:05:31;381] WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A CBL
[000:05:33;850] SCORE, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
[000:05:34;517] OFFICE.
[000:05:35;852] THE IMPACT ON PREMIUMS OR THE
[000:05:38;721] IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON MILLIONS
[000:05:43;993] OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY LOSING
[000:05:44;727] THEIR COVERAGE.
[000:05:45;194] JOHN McCAIN DECIDED TO PULL THE
[000:05:45;928] PLUG EARLY.
[000:05:46;329] MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE
[000:05:47;063] ONE, THE FINAL VOTE AS HE WAS
[000:05:47;864] LAST TIME, WHEN HE LITERALLY PUT
[000:05:48;664] HIS THUMB DOWN.
[000:05:49;665] BUT HE MADE IT CLEAR HE'S A NO
[000:05:50;566] VOTE.
[000:05:52;068] RAND PAUL HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE'S
[000:05:52;935] A NO VOTE.
[000:05:53;903] THIS REMINDS ME OF THE LINE
[000:05:55;304] ABOUT THE KNIGHT AND THE PRINCE,
[000:05:57;240] IN THE PRINCESS BRIDE, IT'S
[000:05:59;509] MOSTLY DEAD, THIS IS MOSTLY DEAD
[000:06:00;309] RIGHT NOW.
[000:06:02;512] I SUPPOSE SUSAN COLLINS COULD
[000:06:04;047] CHANGE BUT SHE'S BEEN AGAINST
[000:06:05;248] ALL OF THESE REPEAL AND REPLACE
[000:06:06;449] PLANS.
[000:06:08;418] I'D BE SHOCKED IF SHE WERE TO
[000:06:09;118] CHANGE.
[000:06:10;753] LISA MURKOWSKI HAS BEEN AGAINST
[000:06:11;954] ALMOST ALL OF THEM.
[000:06:13;990] I'D BE A LITTLE LESS SHOCKED IF
[000:06:14;757] SHE CHANGED.
[000:06:17;760] SHELLEY MOORE OF WEST VIRGINIA,
[000:06:18;728] ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO, GRASSLEY
[000:06:21;931] AND EARNS THE FROM IOWA.
[000:06:24;767] THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION.
[000:06:26;335] IT'S ON- SUPPORT, WOULD BE AN
[000:06:28;204] OVERSTATEMENT.
[000:06:29;172] ON LIFE SUPPORT.
[000:06:31;707] >> Shepard: LISA MURKOWSKI OF
[000:06:34;043] ALASKA, THERE'S A LARGE GIFT
[000:06:39;148] BASKET WAITING IN THE WINGS,
[000:06:39;882] IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FOR THE
[000:06:40;583] PEOPLE OF ALASKA IF SHE CHANGES
[000:06:41;350] HER MIND.
[000:06:41;717] >> YES, THERE'S A PROVISION FOR
[000:06:44;454] SPARSELY POPULATED STATES,
[000:06:46;022] ALASKA CERTAINLY QUALIFIES AS A
[000:06:47;990] SPARSELY POPULATED STATE, THAT
[000:06:50;059] THEY WOULD NOT FALL UNDER ALL OF
[000:06:51;094] THE PROVISIONS AND IT WOULD MAKE
[000:06:53;763] SURE THAT THEY GOT MORE FUNDING
[000:06:55;064] RATHER THAN LESS FUNDING WHICH
[000:06:56;666] THEY WOULD OTHERWISE IF THEY
[000:06:58;034] WERE TREATED LIKE EVERY OTHER
[000:06:58;801] STATE.
[000:07:00;603] THIS IS, IT'S INTERESTING TO
[000:07:02;638] SEE, SHEP, WE ALL REMEMBER
[000:07:05;274] OBAMACARE, ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS
[000:07:06;042] THAT REPUBLICANS HAD AT THE TIME
[000:07:06;809] ABOUT THE MESSY WAY THAT WAS
[000:07:07;577] PASSED.
[000:07:08;811] WE HAVE A PASS IT IN ORDER TO
[000:07:09;712] FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT.
[000:07:11;247] THINGS ARE JAMMED DOWN.
[000:07:13;015] THERE WAS THE CORNHUSKER
[000:07:14;784] KICKBACK, ALL OF THE SPECIAL
[000:07:15;918] DEALS TO BUY THE VOTES OF
[000:07:16;552] SENATORS.
[000:07:17;720] YOU'RE SEEING ALL OF THAT IF NOT
[000:07:19;055] MORE ON THE PART OF REPUBLICANS
[000:07:20;356] THIS TIME.
[000:07:23;960] IT'S PERFECT HYPOCRISY, WHAT YOU
[000:07:27;096] SEE ON CAPITOL HILL.
[000:07:31;501] >> Shepard: I WANTED TO SPEAK
[000:07:32;301] SPECIAL ABOUT SUSAN COLLINS OF
[000:07:33;035] MAINE.
[000:07:33;336] FOR HER, SHE SAID REPEATEDLY, I
[000:07:35;004] THINK, CHRIS, THIS IS ABOUT
[000:07:35;705] MEDICAID.
[000:07:36;305] HER CONCERNS ABOUT IT.
[000:07:38;274] >> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:07:40;409] IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE
[000:07:42;078] FORMULA, MAINE WOULD DO BETTER,
[000:07:44;480] THERE ARE SOME STATES, ABOUT 31
[000:07:45;915] STATES THAT ARE LOSERS IN THIS
[000:07:46;649] BILL.
[000:07:47;049] THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE WINNERS.
[000:07:48;818] MAINE WOULD BE A WINNER.
[000:07:50;753] BUT SHE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
[000:07:51;854] THE MEDICAID.
[000:07:52;822] IT TURNS IT FROM A BASICALLY
[000:07:55;358] OPEN-ENDED ENTITLEMENT INTO A
[000:07:57;160] BLOCK GRANT AND EVENTUALLY A
[000:08:00;463] FORMULA WITH DIMINISHING
[000:08:02;565] FINANCING PER CAPITA, PER
[000:08:03;232] PERSON.
[000:08:04;634] IN THE LONG RUN, CERTAINLY AFTER
[000:08:06;736] 2026, PEOPLE ON MEDICAID GET
[000:08:09;305] LESS FUNDING THAN IN THE PAST.
[000:08:11;040] SUSAN COLLINS IS MAD ABOUT THAT.
[000:08:12;942] YOU SAW THE GOVERNOR, THE
[000:08:15;411] INDEPENDENT GOFF OF MAINE
[000:08:16;546] JOIN -- GOVERNOR OF MAINE TO
[000:08:17;480] JOIN WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT TO
[000:08:19;549] URGE HER TO DO IT.
[000:08:20;983] SHE'S REPORTING A LOT OF FOLKS
[000:08:22;685] IN MAINE LIKE HER STAND AGAINST
[000:08:23;619] PASSING THIS BILL.
[000:08:27;990] >> Shepard: IT SEEMS THAT LAST
[000:08:28;758] TIME THE REPUBLICANS CAME UP
[000:08:29;492] WITH A PLAN, IT ONLY HAD 17%
[000:08:30;293] APPROVAL ACROSS THE NATION.
[000:08:31;627] THIS TIME THE CONCERN SEEMS TO
[000:08:33;763] BE IF NOT PRIMARILY, LARGELY,
[000:08:36;732] ABOUT A CAP ON LIFETIME BENEFITS
[000:08:38;367] FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING
[000:08:39;168] CONDITIONS.
[000:08:41;037] AND THEY'RE DISCUSSING THIS IN
[000:08:43;139] THE JIMMY KIMMEL WAY, IF YOU
[000:08:45;341] HAVE A CHILD WHO NEEDS MULTIPLE
[000:08:48;044] IN HIS CASE HEART SURGERIES AND
[000:08:50;012] YOU HAVE A MILLION DOLLAR CAP
[000:08:51;380] AND YOUR CHILD DICE AS A RESULT
[000:08:52;782] OF THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE
[000:08:53;916] ENOUGH MONEY THAT SEEMS TO BE A
[000:08:55;418] CONCERN FOR A LOT OF VOTERS.
[000:08:57;653] >> LOOK, THE PROBLEM IS THAT
[000:09:00;590] WHAT THIS DOES IS BASICALLY
[000:09:02;058] KEEPS ALL OF THE TAXES FROM
[000:09:04;293] OBAMACARE AND DOES AWAY WITH THE
[000:09:05;928] MANDATES, DOES AWAY WITH THE
[000:09:07;230] MEDICAL DEVICE TAX.
[000:09:08;631] IT TAKES THE OTHER BIG TAXES AND
[000:09:11;934] SIMPLY GIVES IT BACK TO THE
[000:09:13;302] STATE AND SAYS FEDERALISM, YOU
[000:09:14;136] DO IT.
[000:09:15;605] THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY STATE
[000:09:18;040] WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN AND
[000:09:22;878] THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET WAIVERS
[000:09:23;646] FROM THE DEPARTMENT, FROM
[000:09:24;313] WASHINGTON, FROM THE DEPARTMENT
[000:09:25;114] OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF
[000:09:26;916] APPROPRIATE AND AFFORDABLE
[000:09:27;583] COVERAGE.
[000:09:28;150] NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS.
[000:09:29;986] NOW, THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT
[000:09:32;989] SOME STATES, LIBERAL STATES,
[000:09:34;423] BLUE STATES, WOULD HAVE VERY
[000:09:36;726] LENIENT BENEFITS AND WOULD, FOR
[000:09:40;229] INSTANCE, PEOPLE WITH
[000:09:41;364] PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE WELL
[000:09:42;131] COVERED.
[000:09:42;498] OTHER STATES WE AREN'T SURE.
[000:09:44;000] WHO KNOWS WHAT A WAIVER FOR
[000:09:46;102] APPROPRIATE AND AFFORDABLE
[000:09:46;769] COVERAGE MEANS.
[000:09:47;236] THERE IS A CONCERN.
[000:09:48;904] WE DON'T KNOW, IN FACT, BUT
[000:09:51;073] THERE IS A CONCERN THAT SOME SAY
[000:09:53;976] WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS MAY
[000:09:55;177] SAY ON PAPER THEY CAN GET
[000:09:58;047] COVERAGE BUT IN TERMS OF THE
[000:09:59;415] FINANCING, COST OF THE PREMIUMS
[000:10:00;850] OR DEDUCTIBLES, THEY CAN'T.
[000:10:02;084] >> Shepard: IT'S NOT DEAD BUT
[000:10:03;919] IT'S EXTREMELY COLD AND
[000:10:04;553] EXTREMELY WHITE.
[000:10:06;055] >> IT'S MOSTLY DEAD.
[000:10:08;024] >> Shepard: THE LEADERS OF NORTH
[000:10:10;393] KOREA AND UNITED STATES ARE
[000:10:11;460] PERSON
[000:10:11;460] ALLY INSULTING EACH OTHER
[000:10:33;516] AND BRINGING THE NUCLEAR
[000:10:34;216] STANDOFF TO A NEW LEVEL.
[000:10:34;850] THE DICTATOR KIM JUDGE UN HAS
[000:10:35;551] CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP MENTALLY
[000:10:36;285] DERANGED N A PERSONAL STATEMENT,
[000:10:37;019] IT COMES AFTER PRESIDENT PLUMP
[000:10:37;753] THREATENED TO TOTALLY DESTROY
[000:10:38;454] NORTH KOREA IF THAT IS WHAT IT
[000:10:39;188] TAKES TO DEFEND THE UNITED
[000:10:39;855] STATES.
[000:10:40;189] THAT WAS DURING HIS SPEECH TO
[000:10:40;890] THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL
[000:10:41;557] ASSEMBLY.
[000:10:41;924] ACCORDING TO NORTH KOREAN STATE
[000:10:42;658] TELEVISION, KIM JUNG UN SAID
[000:10:43;359] WHATEVER TRUMP MIGHT HAVE
[000:10:43;993] EXPECTED HE WILL FACE RESULTS
[000:10:44;694] BEYOND HIS EXPECTATION.
[000:10:45;294] PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED THIS
[000:10:47;263] MORNING, KIM JUN-UN OF NORTH
[000:10:51;067] KOREA, OBVIOUS LAY MADMAN,
[000:10:52;735] DOESN'T MIND STARVING AND
[000:10:54;036] KILLING HIS PEOPLE, WILL BE
[000:10:55;104] TESTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE.
[000:10:58;174] NOW, NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN MIN
[000:11:00;009] CITY SAID THEY MIGHT CONSIDER
[000:11:02;011] TESTING A HYDROGEN BOMB IN THE
[000:11:02;745] PACIFIC OCEAN.
[000:11:04;113] HERE'S HOW THE SECRETARY OF
[000:11:05;348] STATE, REX TILLERSON, RESPONDED
[000:11:10;252] TO THAT.
[000:11:10;619] >> ALL OF OUR MILITARY OPTIONS
[000:11:11;354] ARE ON THE TABLE AS THE
[000:11:11;987] PRESIDENT SAID.
[000:11:13;022] THERE WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND
[000:11:14;557] THERE IS ASSEMBLED A NATIONAL
[000:11:16;659] SECURITY COUNCIL THAT MEETS ON
[000:11:17;560] EACH OF THESE ISSUES TO ADVISE
[000:11:18;294] THE PRESIDENT.
[000:11:20;029] IT WILL BE HIS DECISION
[000:11:20;663] ULTIMATELY.
[000:11:22;465] >> Shepard: SECRETARY TILLERSON
[000:11:24;266] SAID THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE
[000:11:25;401] EFFORTS IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA
[000:11:27;136] A BACK TO CHRIS WALLACE.
[000:11:28;371] GOING AT IT LIKE CHILDREN IN A
[000:11:30;706] PLAYGROUND, DOES THIS LEAD TO
[000:11:32;541] WAR?
[000:11:32;808] YESTERDAY THE STOCK MARKET
[000:11:34;143] SEEMED TO SUGGEST SO, 10 DEFENSE
[000:11:35;778] STOCKS HIT THE ALL-TIME HIGH.
[000:11:39;482] >> WE'RE A WAYS AWAY FROM THAT.
[000:11:41;183] GENERAL McMASTER, H.R. McMASTER,
[000:11:43;686] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, SAID
[000:11:44;920] WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROAD.
[000:11:45;755] THERE IS MORE ROAD.
[000:11:47;790] YOU CAN SEE THAT YESTERDAY WHEN
[000:11:48;858] THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT HE
[000:11:51;060] SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER GIVING
[000:11:53;062] THE TREASURY SECRETARY THE
[000:11:54;930] POWERS TO CUT OFF ANY TRADE, ANY
[000:11:56;799] DEALINGS WITH ANY COMPANY, ANY
[000:11:58;701] BANK, THAT HAS TRADE OR DEALINGS
[000:12:00;035] WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:12:01;470] PRESIDENT ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT
[000:12:07;076] CHINESE, THE CHINESE CENTRAL
[000:12:07;843] BANK, IN ACCOUNT THEIR FEDERAL
[000:12:08;644] RESERVE, IS ORDERING ALL OF
[000:12:09;412] THEIR BANKS TO CUT OFF ANY
[000:12:12;882] FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH
[000:12:16;018] PYONGYANG, WITH THE KIM REGIME.
[000:12:17;853] WE'LL WAIT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS,
[000:12:21;123] WHETHER SQUEEZING NORTH KOREA IN
[000:12:22;858] THAT FINANCIAL AND TRADE SENSE
[000:12:25;995] SHAKES ANY SENSE INTO THE KIM
[000:12:27;663] REGIME AND GETS THEM TO STAND
[000:12:28;697] DOWN.
[000:12:29;665] THE QUESTION, SHEP, IS WHETHER
[000:12:33;135] KIM HAS MADE IN EFFECT AN
[000:12:35;337] EXISTENTIAL CHOICE, BELIEVES
[000:12:36;739] THAT HAVING A LONG-RANGE
[000:12:38;607] BALLISTIC MISSILE WITH A NUCLEAR
[000:12:40;543] WAR HEAD ON IT IS NOT THE PATH
[000:12:42;378] TO DISASTER BUT THE PATH TO
[000:12:44;113] SURVIVAL FOR HIS REGIME.
[000:12:46;048] YOU KNOW, HE LOOKS AROUND THE
[000:12:47;983] WORLD, SEES SADDAM HUSSEIN, NO
[000:12:50;119] WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,
[000:12:51;020] ENDED UP DEAD.
[000:12:53;923] SAME WITHCA DAFIE AND MAY
[000:12:55;991] HAVE -- KHADAFFI.
[000:13:00;863] THE THING THAT ENSURES HIS
[000:13:01;564] SURVIVAL HE BELIEVES IS TO HAVE
[000:13:02;331] A NUCLEAR WEAPON.
[000:13:03;232] >> Shepard: WONDER WHAT KIND OF
[000:13:04;834] REACTION HE'D GET TO AN H-BOMB
[000:13:06;402] TEST IN THE PACIFIC.
[000:13:07;470] >> WE HAVE HAD H-BOMB TESTS
[000:13:09;038] BEFORE, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,
[000:13:10;372] WE THINK, IT WAS UNDERGROUND.
[000:13:12;374] THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE MORE
[000:13:13;909] STUNNING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
[000:13:14;610] OVER GROUND.
[000:13:15;044] IT WOULD BE OVER THE WATER.
[000:13:17;179] WE WOULD SEE THE MUSHROOM CLOUD
[000:13:18;981] THAT WOULD BRING HOME WHAT THE
[000:13:19;982] THREAT IS.
[000:13:20;783] DO I THINK WE'LL GO TO WAR OVER
[000:13:22;251] A NUCLEAR TEST, PROBABLY NOT.
[000:13:24;487] PARTICULARLY NOT WITH ALL OF
[000:13:25;754] THESE SANCTIONS JUST GETTING
[000:13:27;523] STARTED.
[000:13:27;890] >> Shepard: CHRIS WALLACE, FROM

[000:13:32;461] HE'LL TALK WITH MICROSOFT

[000:13:44;507] TO TAKE ANOTHER TRY AT A TRAVEL
[000:13:45;307] BAN.
[000:13:46;108] THE FIRST BAN CAUSED A BIT OF
[000:13:47;076] CHAOS.
[000:13:48;777] SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME?
[000:13:50;479] JUST RELEASED DETAILS COMING UP

[000:17:32;201] S.
[000:17:32;468] >> Shepard: THE TRUMP
[000:17:33;135] ADMINISTRATION PREPARING A NEW
[000:17:35;037] ORDER TO REPLACE THE
[000:17:36;105] CONTROVERSIAL TRAVEL BAND.
[000:17:38;273] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
[000:17:40;642] HAS TAILORED RESTRICTIONS TO
[000:17:42;044] EACH COUNTRY.
[000:17:43;612] BASED ON WHAT THEY CALL MULTIPLE
[000:17:45;714] FACTORS INCLUDING THE THREAT
[000:17:48;016] EACH COUNTRY POSES AND WHETHER
[000:17:49;551] IT COOPERATES WITH U.S.
[000:17:50;185] REGULATIONS.
[000:17:51;487] THE NEW RULES WOULD REPLACE
[000:17:52;721] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EARLIER
[000:17:54;123] EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT BANNED
[000:17:55;557] TRAVELERS FROM SIX MUSLIM
[000:17:56;558] MAJORITY COUNTRIES.
[000:17:57;826] BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING TO HEAR
[000:17:59;595] WHICH COUNTRIES THE NEW TRAVEL
[000:18:01;296] RULES WILL AFFECT.
[000:18:02;998] KEVIN CORK, LIVE IN SOMERSET,
[000:18:05;000] NEW JERSEY NOT FAR FROM THE
[000:18:05;734] PRESIDENT'S GOLF CLUB WHERE HE'S
[000:18:07;069] SPENDING THE WEEKEND.
[000:18:08;237] KEVIN?
[000:18:08;537] >> RIGHT ON THE MONEY, SHEPARD.
[000:18:10;072] WE TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS SIX
[000:18:12;207] COUNTRY, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
[000:18:13;742] COUNTRIES WILL BE INVOLVED IN
[000:18:14;510] THE NEW TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS.
[000:18:15;911] WE DO HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
[000:18:18;714] BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN
[000:18:19;615] LEARNING FROM ADMINISTRATION
[000:18:21;283] SOURCES AND BASE ON WHAT WE
[000:18:23;218] LEARNED FROM A RECENTLY
[000:18:25;220] CONCLUDED CALL THE NUMBER OF
[000:18:29;925] COUNTRIES INVOLVED WILL LIKELY
[000:18:30;692] EXPAND TO INCLUDE MORE THAN THE
[000:18:31;460] ORIGINAL SIX COUNTRIES THAT WE
[000:18:32;194] TALKED ABOUT.
[000:18:32;628] LET ME SHARE PART OF AN
[000:18:33;328] ADMINISTRATION STATEMENT THEY'VE
[000:18:34;129] BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IDEA OF
[000:18:35;230] SECURING THE HOMELAND AND MOST
[000:18:37;132] IMPORTANTLY PROTECTING THE
[000:18:37;833] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:18:39;168] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ENSURE
[000:18:41;737] WE ONLY ADMIT THOSE PROPERLY
[000:18:43;505] VOTED AND WILL NOT POSE A THREAT
[000:18:45;007] TO NATIONAL SECURITY OR PUBLIC
[000:18:45;741] SAFETY.
[000:18:46;341] SO IN EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF
[000:18:48;310] COUNTRIES ON THE LIST THE
[000:18:49;912] ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AS YOU
[000:18:51;213] SAID, TO CREATE MORE
[000:18:52;714] RESTRICTIONS BUT ON A
[000:18:53;348] CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
[000:18:54;817] THIS IS ALSO RELEVANT FOR ONE
[000:18:56;552] MAJOR IMPORTANT REASON, THAT IS
[000:18:58;754] BY EXPANDING IT AND MAKING IT
[000:19:01;490] COUNTRY-TO-COUNTRY, SHEPARD,
[000:19:02;224] WHAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY TRYING
[000:19:03;859] TO DO IS BLUNT PERHAPS SOME OF
[000:19:05;127] THE LEGAL PUSHBACK THAT THE
[000:19:06;795] ADMINISTRATION HAS PREVIOUSLY
[000:19:07;529] GOTTEN.
[000:19:09;731] YOU MAY RECALL THE STATE
[000:19:10;933] DEPARTMENT SAID THERE WERE LIKE
[000:19:12;000] 17 COUNTRIES NOT UP TO U.S.
[000:19:14;169] STANDARDS AND FAILED TO FALL
[000:19:15;237] INTO COMPLIANCE B HALF HAVE.
[000:19:17;940] WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT NUMBER LOOKS
[000:19:18;707] LIKE.
[000:19:39;561] I WANT TO SHARE A TWEET THAT THE
[000:19:40;362] PRESIDENT SENT OUT AFTER AN
[000:19:41;029] ATTACK ON LONDON.
[000:19:41;530] I THINK IT'S INSTRUCTIVE, WILL
[000:19:42;264] GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT HE'S
[000:19:42;965] BEEN THINKING.
[000:19:43;398] THIS IS BACK IN SEPTEMBER 15.
[000:19:44;099] A TRAVEL BAN INTO THE U.S.
[000:19:44;766] SHOULD BE FOR LARGER, TOUGHER,
[000:19:45;500] AND MORE SPECIFIC.
[000:19:46;001] INDEED THAT APPEARS TO BE THE
[000:19:46;702] CASE.
[000:19:47;002] >> Shepard: KEVIN CORK, LIVE FOR
[000:19:47;736] US, THANK YOU.
[000:19:48;170] THERE'S BREAKING NEWS FROM

[000:34:59;188] RUSSIAN AIR STRIKES AGAINST
[000:35:00;890] U.S.-BACKED FIGHTERS AND THEIR
[000:35:02;792] AMERICAN ADVISORS IN SYRIA.
[000:35:05;194] >> NO, I'M NOT WORRIED, WE DEAL
[000:35:08;197] WITH THE RUSSIANS IN A
[000:35:09;265] COLLABORATIVE WAY AND WE'LL SORT
[000:35:10;032] IT OUT.
[000:35:11;267] >> THE U.S. AND RUSSIA ARE
[000:35:12;668] BARRED BY LAW FROM COOPERATING
[000:35:13;669] TOGETHER.
[000:35:15;138] CONGRESS PASSED A LAW AFTER
[000:35:16;372] RUSSIA'S INVASION OF UKRAINE IN
[000:35:18;875] 2014.
[000:35:21;210] THAT DIDN'T STOP AMERICAN AND
[000:35:23;279] RUSSIAN GENERALS FROM MEETING
[000:35:24;847] FACE-TO-FACE IN RECENT DAYS, ON
[000:35:26;482] THE GROUND, TO DEFUSE THE
[000:35:27;583] ESCALATING SITUATION.
[000:35:29;218] >> Shepard: WHAT ABOUT THE FIGHT
[000:35:30;419] AGAINST ISIS?
[000:35:30;920] >> ALL EYES ARE ON THE KURDISH
[000:35:33;222] AREAS OF NORTHERN IRAQ WHERE A
[000:35:35;791] CONTROVERSIAL REFERENDUM ON
[000:35:36;526] INDEPENDENT EVENS IS TAKING
[000:35:37;260] PLACE ON MONDAY.
[000:35:38;961] U.S.-BACKED FORCES FIGHTING TO
[000:35:41;564] CLEAR ISIS FROM ITS
[000:35:43;666] SELF-PROCLAIMED CAPITAL IN SYRIA
[000:35:48;337] HAVE CLEARED WE'RE TOLD 70% OF
[000:35:49;172] RA" A.
[000:35:49;505] UP TO 900 ISIS FIGHTERS IN
[000:35:51;207] RACKIA.
[000:35:53;409] IN IRAQ THE OPERATION TO PLIB
[000:35:55;411] RATE ONE OF THE LAST POCKETS
[000:35:57;346] THAT ISIS CONTROLS IN IRAQ.
[000:35:59;248] AS IF THE PENTAGON DOESN'T HAVE
[000:36:01;651] ENOUGH TO KEEP IT'SES ON, RUSSIA
[000:36:04;153] TEST FIRED AN INTERCONTINENTAL
[000:36:06;789] BALLISTIC MISS WILL A 7,500 MILE
[000:36:08;991] RANGE CAPABLE OF HITTING ANY
[000:36:10;159] CITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
[000:36:12;962] PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE U.S.
[000:36:14;564] WAS WARNED ABOUT THE TEST LAUNCH
[000:36:17;233] IN ACCORDANCE A WITH
[000:36:21;270] LONG-STANDING TREATMENTIES.
[000:36:22;838] RUSSIA HAS BEEN USING SYRIA FOR
[000:36:24;040] TESTING.
[000:36:26;209] THAT HAS THE PENTAGON CONCERNED.
[000:36:27;343] >> Shepard: THANK YOU.
[000:36:29;011] OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE COMMANDER
[000:36:31;380] OF THE AIR WAR AGAINST THE
[000:36:34;317] ISLAMIC STATE, LIEUTENANT
[000:36:37;220] JEFFREY COBRA HARIGIAN HAS
[000:36:42;024] DIRECTED SOME OF THE BIGGEST
[000:36:42;758] EVENTS IN THE FIGHTING INCLUDING
[000:36:43;492] THE NINE-MONTH FIGHT FOR THE
[000:36:44;260] CITY OF MOSUL.
[000:36:45;328] THIS PHOTO FROM MOSUL YESTERDAY.
[000:36:47;863] MUCH OF THAT CITY IS DEVASTATED
[000:36:49;265] FROM THE FIGHTING.
[000:36:50;900] THE GENERAL IS AN AIR FORCE
[000:36:52;501] FIGHTER PILOT WITH MORE THAN 30
[000:36:53;769] YEARS EXPERIENCE.
[000:36:54;704] HE FLIES OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA
[000:36:56;872] NOW, THIS SHOT FROM JUNE AS HE
[000:36:58;808] REFUELED DURING A RISHGS.
[000:37:01;177] THE GENERAL IS ALSO A PURPLE
[000:37:02;545] HEART RECIPIENT N1996 HE WAS
[000:37:05;248] STATIONED IN SAUDI ARABIA WHEN
[000:37:06;048] HE WAS INJURED IN THE BOMBING OF
[000:37:07;550] THE KOBAR TOWERS.
[000:37:09;986] 19 AIRMEN DIED IN THAT ATTACK,
[000:37:12;255] SOME 300 OTHERS HURT.
[000:37:14;690] LT. GENERAL JEFFREY COBRA
[000:37:20;730] HARIGIAN, CENTRAL COMMAND, HAN
[000:37:23;799] HONOR TO HAVE YOU.
[000:37:24;367] >> IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.
[000:37:26;736] >> DOES ANYTHING CHANGE IN
[000:37:27;903] REGARDS TO THE RUSSIANS?
[000:37:29;805] >> STEP ONE IS MANAGE THE DEACON
[000:37:32;975] FLICKS, GET BACK TO THE FIGHT
[000:37:33;676] AGAINST ISIS.
[000:37:37;480] WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND
[000:37:38;547] IN COORDINATION WITH THE TEAM TO
[000:37:41;617] MAKE SURE WE HAVE DEACON FLIKTED
[000:37:45;221] TO GET OF ONE IN THE SIGS FIGHT.
[000:37:48;124] WE'LL GET THE TEAM IN POSITION
[000:37:49;358] TO ENSURE THERE'S NOT A
[000:37:51;794] STRATEGIC MISCOMMUNICATION THAT
[000:37:52;695] CAN OCCUR.
[000:37:53;896] >> Shepard: THE RUSSIANS WERE
[000:37:55;031] FIRING ON OTHERS, OUR SPECIAL OP
[000:37:56;766] FORCES NEARBY.
[000:37:58;334] IT WAS TOO CLOSE.
[000:37:59;969] AND WE SAID, BASICALLY, DON'T DO
[000:38:01;904] IT AND THEY SAID WE'LL FIRE ON
[000:38:02;672] YOU.
[000:38:05;908] DOES THAT CHANGE ANYTHING ON THE
[000:38:07;476] GROUND?
[000:38:07;810] >> WELL, I THINK THE IMPORTANT
[000:38:09;779] PART TO REMEMBER HERE IS WE WILL
[000:38:11;981] PROTECT OUR FORCE.
[000:38:13;115] IT SHOULD BE CRYSTAL CLEAR IN
[000:38:14;884] EVERY AMERICAN'S MIND THAT WE'RE
[000:38:16;118] FOG TO PROTECT OUR FORCE.
[000:38:18;187] WE WORK THROUGH THIS, I THINK
[000:38:19;822] THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT
[000:38:21;057] NEEDS TO OCCUR IS GETTING BACK
[000:38:24;694] TO FIGHTING ISIS, DE-CONFLICTING
[000:38:27;530] OUR FORCES, ENSURING THE
[000:38:32;368] MECHANISM TO DO THAT, WHAT IS
[000:38:33;169] REQUIRED IS A CONTINUED
[000:38:33;803] COVERINGS WITH THE RUSSIANS TO
[000:38:34;570] MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
[000:38:35;237] >> Shepard: WE HAD A MEETING
[000:38:36;405] THAT HAPPENS AT UNDISCLOSED, ALL
[000:38:38;307] THE REST, A MEETING YOU WOULD
[000:38:39;742] HAVE ATTENDED HAD YOU NOT BEEN
[000:38:40;876] HERE.
[000:38:41;177] >> I HAD A REPRESENTATIVE THERE.
[000:38:42;878] AND THAT REPRESENTATIVE GAVE ME
[000:38:44;146] FULL FEEDBACK ON HOW THAT PLAYED
[000:38:45;381] OUT.
[000:38:47;016] AND THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.
[000:38:48;718] >> I KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW DETAILS,
[000:38:50;953] I DON'T WANT TO KNOW DETAILS.
[000:38:52;521] I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, IF YOU CAN
[000:38:53;856] TELL US, ARE THINGS GETTING
[000:38:55;558] BETTER.
[000:38:55;891] >> THERE WAS PROGRESS MADE.
[000:38:58;994] IT WILL BE PIECEMEAL AND IT WILL
[000:39:00;563] TAKE TIME.
[000:39:01;697] THE KEY IS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE
[000:39:04;033] WORK THROUGH DE-CON FLICKS THAT
[000:39:06;602] ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE OUR FIGHT.
[000:39:07;803] AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO
[000:39:10;940] ENCIRCLE AND ANNIHILATE ISIS
[000:39:13;209] PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE
[000:39:15;611] EUPHRATES RIVER VALLEY.
[000:39:16;946] >> IS THAT WHAT THE RUSSIANS
[000:39:18;414] WANT?
[000:39:18;714] ARE WE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE?
[000:39:20;149] WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
[000:39:22;118] TEAM-TO-TEAM, RUSSIANS AND
[000:39:22;785] AMERICANS.
[000:39:26;589] >> THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE
[000:39:27;256] COMMUNICATED TO US.
[000:39:27;790] PUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AS YOU
[000:39:28;591] KNOW, ACTIONS SPEECH LOUDER THAN
[000:39:29;358] WORDS.
[000:39:30;559] WE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH
[000:39:33;229] THAT, FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE MAKE
[000:39:34;630] SURE THAT OUR AIRMEN, OUR
[000:39:36;165] TEAMMATES ON THE GROUND, OUR
[000:39:37;733] SOLDIERS AND OUR PARTNERS ARE IN
[000:39:38;968] A POSITION TO CONTINUE THAT
[000:39:39;668] FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.
[000:39:41;937] >> Shepard: OUR UNDERSTANDING OF
[000:39:42;705] THINGS IS THAT WE'RE BOMBING
[000:39:44;006] MORE TARGETS IN SYRIA, ISIS
[000:39:45;908] RELATED, THAN IN THE PAST.
[000:39:47;910] IS THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE
[000:39:48;978] TARGETS OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?
[000:39:50;179] >> WELL I THINK IT'S COMBINATION
[000:39:52;314] OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO
[000:39:53;983] DEVELOP TARGETS.
[000:39:55;317] OVER TIME, AS WE'VE SPENT TIME
[000:39:59;021] USING OUR INTELLIGENCE,
[000:40:01;157] SURVEILLANCE, AND RECON SAYS
[000:40:02;725] ASSETS WE HAVE A BETTER
[000:40:03;859] UNDERSTANDING OF THE
[000:40:04;427] ENVIRONMENT.
[000:40:06;662] THE SECOND BIG PIECE IS THE
[000:40:08;831] SIRRIAL DEMOCRATIC FORCES ARE ON
[000:40:09;665] THE MOVE.
[000:40:10;866] IN RA" A, THE GREAT SUCCESS,
[000:40:14;203] ALONG WITH THE MIDDLE EUPHRATES
[000:40:16;572] RIVER VALLEY THAT, DRIVES
[000:40:17;373] ACTIVITY.
[000:40:21;610] >> Shepard: SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC
[000:40:22;378] FORCES.
[000:40:22;711] THAT'S THE ONES WE FIGHT WITH
[000:40:23;479] AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT?
[000:40:24;113] >> YES, SIR.
[000:40:24;513] THAT'S IT.
[000:40:25;448] >> Shepard: ARE THEY GETTING
[000:40:26;549] BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO, AND ARE
[000:40:28;651] THEY -- CAN THEY STAND UP?
[000:40:31;387] >> WOULD I TELL YOU, THEIR
[000:40:34;290] ASYMMETRIC ADVANTAGE IS AIR
[000:40:34;957] POWER.
[000:40:35;357] WE PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO
[000:40:36;992] REMAIN ON THE OFFENSIVE.
[000:40:38;027] AND PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION
[000:40:39;228] TO SUCCEED.
[000:40:42;231] THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE TODAY.
[000:40:42;865] >> Shepard: THE CRITICS SAID
[000:40:43;599] REPEATEDLY THAT OUR AIR FORCE IS
[000:40:44;867] WORKING FOR IRAN IN THAT MATTER.
[000:40:46;769] >> I WOULD DENY THAT.
[000:40:48;537] >> Shepard: I WOULDN'T SUGGEST
[000:40:49;271] ANYTHING ELSE.
[000:40:50;339] BUT WE CAN SEE WHERE THEY'RE
[000:40:51;574] COMING FROM.
[000:40:52;007] >> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
[000:40:53;542] BUT I THINK IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE
[000:40:56;745] SUPPORTING THE SBS IN THEIR
[000:41:00;349] OPERATION, THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC
[000:41:02;818] FORCES, TO DELIBERATE THESE
[000:41:03;486] CITIES IN SYRIA.
[000:41:05;054] THEY HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE AT
[000:41:05;988] DOING THAT AND WE'RE SUPPORTING
[000:41:07;490] THEM EVERY DAY AND CONTINUE TO
[000:41:08;557] DO THAT.
[000:41:10;226] >> Shepard: WHEN YOU TAKE OUT
[000:41:11;360] ISIS WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
[000:41:16;465] >> WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS
[000:41:17;199] FACILITATE THE ABILITY FOR THE
[000:41:17;933] POLITICAL PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE
[000:41:18;834] SO THAT GOVERNANCE CAN OCCUR
[000:41:20;402] ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALLOW THE
[000:41:21;937] PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO WORK.
[000:41:23;272] THE KIDS TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL.
[000:41:25;274] >> Shepard: THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
[000:41:26;509] FROM EVERYTHING WE SEE IT LOOKS
[000:41:28;210] LIKE SYRIA IS PRETTY WELL
[000:41:28;878] DESTROYED.
[000:41:30;412] >> THAT WILL BE A HEAVY LIFT.
[000:41:32;848] BUT THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES
[000:41:35;284] COMBINED WITH OUR PRECISION
[000:41:37;586] TARGETING HAVE DONE AS MUCH AS
[000:41:38;787] THEY CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT
[000:41:41;323] INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS STANDING.
[000:41:44;860] GO AHEAD.
[000:41:45;294] >> Shepard: I DIDN'T MEAN TO
[000:41:46;028] INTERRUPT.
[000:41:46;395] I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT
[000:41:47;196] IRAQ.
[000:41:48;097] IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S VERY
[000:41:49;265] GOOD PROGRESS THERE.
[000:41:50;766] IN FACT, FROM A LOT OF READING
[000:41:52;835] OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, IT
[000:41:54;570] SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE COLLAPSING
[000:41:56;305] MORE QUICKLY THAN HAD BEEN
[000:41:58;674] ANTICIPATED.
[000:41:59;108] >> I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU.
[000:42:00;042] THE WORD I'M USING IS MOMENTUM.
[000:42:01;777] THEY HAVE MOMENTUM.
[000:42:04;480] IT'S BECAUSE THE IRAQIE SKRT
[000:42:06;081] FORCES PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE
[000:42:10;953] VERY CONFIDENT IN WHAT THEY'RE
[000:42:11;687] DOING.
[000:42:11;987] THE SECURITY FORCES.
[000:42:12;521] THEY LEMPLED THE SKILLS THAT WE
[000:42:13;355] BRING TO SUPPORT THEM.
[000:42:13;989] WHAT YOU SEE IS A GROWING
[000:42:15;424] NATIONALISM INSIDE OF IRAQ.
[000:42:16;091] THEY OWN THIS.
[000:42:18;694] THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD
[000:42:19;595] THROW OUT IS WHAT I'VE SEEN ON
[000:42:21;230] THE GROUND IS THEY'VE BEEN
[000:42:23;198] COURAGEOUS, THEY'VE BEEN HEROIC
[000:42:24;433] IN THE FIGHT AND THE PEOPLE
[000:42:25;968] APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO
[000:42:26;735] LIBERATE THEM.
[000:42:28;103] >> Shepard: I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT
[000:42:29;505] BEFORE, THE OTHER TIMES THAT WE
[000:42:30;539] HAVE ENGAGED OURSELVES WITH
[000:42:33;475] GENERALS OF YOUR ILK HAVE SAID
[000:42:35;277] OTHER THINGS.
[000:42:35;778] THE POINT IS, AS YOU'VE WATCHED
[000:42:37;947] THIS MATURE OVER TIME THE
[000:42:39;448] IRAQIES HAVE BEEN UP FRONT.
[000:42:42;151] WE ARE IN AN ADVISE AND ASSIST
[000:42:43;953] OPERATION.
[000:42:44;353] THAT'S HOW WE SUPPORT THEM.
[000:42:45;454] WHEN YOU COMBINE THE OPERATIONS
[000:42:50;559] WITH THE ASYMMETRIC FORCES OF
[000:42:51;827] THEIR POWER, THEY ARE SUCCEEDING
[000:42:53;896] AND BRINGING IN FORCES THAT
[000:42:55;864] MAINTAIN THE STABILITY TO ALLOW
[000:42:57;466] GOVERNANCE TO OCCUR.
[000:42:59;034] >> Shepard: YOU TALK ABOUT IRAQI
[000:43:00;135] NATIONALISM, THAT'S HARD TO
[000:43:00;836] FIND.
[000:43:01;770] THE KURDS MORE THAN EVER WANT
[000:43:04;473] OUT.
[000:43:05;574] THEY'RE ORGANIZING AND THEY
[000:43:06;775] DON'T WANT TO BE IRAQ, THEY WANT
[000:43:09;378] TO BE KURDISTAN.
[000:43:11;246] >> THE KURDISH REFERENDUM IS
[000:43:13;215] SOMETHING WE'RE ALL CONCERNED
[000:43:13;949] ABOUT.
[000:43:15;317] POLITICALLY THAT WILL BE
[000:43:16;085] SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO BE
[000:43:16;852] SORTED OUT.
[000:43:17;620] FROM THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE WE
[000:43:19;355] WANT TO ENSURE THEIR STABILITY
[000:43:22;591] AND SECURITY THAT FACILITATES
[000:43:24;093] POLITICAL PROGRESS TO BE MADE.
[000:43:25;594] >> Shepard: WILL THERE COME A
[000:43:27;663] TIME WHEN THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF
[000:43:29;231] THEMSELVES?
[000:43:29;632] HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN THAT IS?
[000:43:30;599] >> THAT'S THE PLAN.
[000:43:32;301] BUT WE HAVE TO ALLOW THAT TO
[000:43:33;669] TAKE TIME.
[000:43:34;703] THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FOR
[000:43:36;105] THAT TO OCCUR.
[000:43:37;573] WE WILL LAY OUT METRICS AS WE
[000:43:39;174] MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE
[000:43:41;076] CAMPAIGN, THAT WOULD LAY OUT
[000:43:42;144] WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE
[000:43:43;712] TIME FOR US STARTING TO HAND
[000:43:46;148] OVER THE RESPONSIBILITIES
[000:43:47;383] PARTICULARLY FROM A SUPPORT ON
[000:43:48;584] THE MILITARY SIDE PERSPECTIVE.
[000:43:51;420] >> Shepard: WE READ REPORTS THAT
[000:43:52;655] THE AIR FORCE DOESN'T HAVE
[000:43:53;522] ENOUGH BOMBS.
[000:43:55;391] AND WHATEVER YOU READ SOMETHING
[000:44:00;763] LIKE THAT AS A JOURNALIST, YOU
[000:44:01;563] THINK THEY WANT MORE FUNDING.
[000:44:02;264] WE ALSO WANT MORE FUNDING,
[000:44:02;998] EVERYONE DOES.
[000:44:03;732] OR DO WE HAVE A CRITICAL BOMB
[000:44:05;267] SHORTAGE?
[000:44:05;634] >> I'VE BEEN MANAGING THIS FROM
[000:44:06;935] THE DAY I TOOK COMMAND 15 MONTHS
[000:44:08;437] AGO.
[000:44:09;271] IT'S AN ISSUE WE HAVE WORKED
[000:44:10;572] THROUGH CLOSELY WITH THE AIR
[000:44:11;740] FORCE AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
[000:44:12;908] AND THERE'S A CONCERN OUT THERE,
[000:44:15;644] CLEARLY, AS YOU LOOK AT THE
[000:44:17;279] BUDGET AND ABILITY TO FORECAST
[000:44:18;981] LONG TERM, CONTINUING
[000:44:21;250] RESOLUTIONS DO NOT HELP OUR
[000:44:22;518] ABILITY TO PROCURE THE WEAPONS
[000:44:24;086] IN THE LONG TERM THAT WE NEED.
[000:44:25;421] >> Shepard: YOU NEED A BUDGET.
[000:44:27;289] >> THAT WOULD BE HELP.
[000:44:30;059] >> Shepard: HOW IS WASHINGTON
[000:44:30;893] RESPONDING?
[000:44:31;293] >> I THINK THEY HEAR US BUT I'LL
[000:44:32;828] COME BACK TO THERE IS TALKING
[000:44:34;196] BUT WE NEED TO SEE ACTION TO GET
[000:44:35;330] THE BUDGET RESOLVED.
[000:44:37;066] >> Shepard: DOES THE LACK OF A
[000:44:38;300] BUDGET, JUST CONTINUING
[000:44:39;368] RESOLUTION, MAKE YOUR JOB AND
[000:44:41;136] THE MILITARY JOB HARDER?
[000:44:41;770] >> IT CONCERNS ME.
[000:44:42;938] THE ANSWER TO THAT IN THE SHORT
[000:44:43;739] TERM IS YES.
[000:44:44;940] IT DRIVES US TO HAVE CHALLENGES
[000:44:46;642] THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT
[000:44:48;277] HAVE TO DEAL WITH HAD THERE BEEN
[000:44:50;345] A BUDGET.
[000:44:50;713] >> Shepard: YOU HAVE HAD
[000:44:54;883] PROBLEMS WITH SOME PLANES.
[000:44:55;517] THERE'S BEEN TALK OF TAKING THEM
[000:44:56;318] OUT OF THE THE MIX.
[000:44:56;852] WHERE IS THAT?
[000:44:57;352] >> I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE'VE
[000:44:58;253] BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT
[000:45:00;355] AND AS YOU LOOK AT THE RESOURCES
[000:45:02;124] THAT I HAVE, AVAILABLE TO ME,
[000:45:04;793] I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXECUTE THE
[000:45:06;295] FIGHT EVERY DAY WITHOUT HAVING
[000:45:07;696] TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE ASSETS
[000:45:09;965] BEING PULLED BACK.
[000:45:11;066] >> Shepard: WHEN YOU LOOK AT
[000:45:12;134] WHAT'S GOING ON WITH NORTH
[000:45:14;002] KOREA, THE BACK AND FORTH
[000:45:15;304] RHETORICALLY AND OTHERWISE,
[000:45:17;506] WHAT'S YOURS GREATEST CONCERN?
[000:45:18;273] >> WELL, I THINK AT THE END OF
[000:45:20;876] THE DAY ALL OF US ARE CONCERNED
[000:45:22;277] ABOUT THIS ESCALATING INTO
[000:45:23;746] SOMETHING THAT NO WOULD WANTS TO
[000:45:24;480] HAPPEN.
[000:45:24;980] THAT IS OUT OF MY AREA OF
[000:45:25;748] RESPONSIBILITY.
[000:45:27;149] BUT AS AN AMERICAN, THERE IS A
[000:45:28;951] CONCERN THERE THAT I THINK WE
[000:45:30;119] ALL SHOULD BE WARY OF.
[000:45:31;920] AND HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A
[000:45:34;590] DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO THIS
[000:45:35;257] PROBLEM.
[000:45:36;024] >> Shepard: WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT
[000:45:37;259] NIGHT?
[000:45:37;559] >> WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY IN
[000:45:40;429] MY AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, IS
[000:45:42;197] THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRATEGIC
[000:45:43;298] MISCALCULATION.
[000:45:45;667] WE ARE NOT THERE TO FIGHT
[000:45:50;472] RUSSIA.
[000:45:50;806] WE ARE NOT THERE TO FIGHT SYRIA.
[000:45:51;540] OUR JOB IS TO CRUSH ISIS AND
[000:45:52;307] THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING EVERY
[000:45:53;008] DAY.
[000:45:53;275] I WORRY THAT WE PUT OUR AIRMEN,
[000:45:55;511] OUR COALITION TEAM, IN A
[000:45:57;546] POSITION WHERE STRATEGIC
[000:45:58;614] MISCALCULATION COULD OCCUR.
[000:46:00;048] THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING THIS
[000:46:02;551] DE-CONFLICT.
[000:46:03;819] >> Shepard: YOU USE THAT PHONE
[000:46:04;753] WITH THE RUSSIANS?
[000:46:05;587] >> I DON'T USE INTEREST BUT MY
[000:46:07;456] GUYS DO EVERY DAY.
[000:46:08;290] >> WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT PHONE?
[000:46:09;324] >> THE INTERESTING PART IS I
[000:46:11;026] HAVE SOME YOUNG AIRMEN THAT WE
[000:46:12;528] BRING IN, THAT ARE INTERPRETERS.
[000:46:14;963] SO WE'LL TALK, THEY'LL RESPOND
[000:46:17;533] AND OUR INTERPRETERS, THESE
[000:46:19;334] YOUNG AIRMEN, TRANSLATE FOR US.
[000:46:20;903] IT'S INCREDIBLE THE CONTEXT THAT
[000:46:22;571] THEY GIVE US WITH THEIR
[000:46:24;973] UNDERSTANDING OF THE RUSSIAN
[000:46:25;941] LAYMEN.
[000:46:26;275] IT'S FASCINATING, IT'S BEEN A
[000:46:28;310] LESSON IN LEADERSHIP AS WE WORK
[000:46:30;212] THROUGH NEGOTIATING WITH THE
[000:46:32;414] RUSSIANS ON HOW WE DE-CONFLICT
[000:46:34;116] OUR OPERATIONS.
[000:46:36;518] >> Sandra: IS IT WE'RE HERE,
[000:46:37;753] DON'T GO THERE, OR IS IT BIGGER
[000:46:39;555] PICTURE THAN THAT.
[000:46:40;088] >> ALL OF THE ABOVE.
[000:46:44;193] EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW, IF WE SEE
[000:46:45;027] SOMETHING WE DON'T LIKE WE CALL
[000:46:45;761] THEM.
[000:46:47;796] WE WILL TRY TO MANAGE THE
[000:46:52;367] DE-CONFLICTION, BUT IT'S A
[000:46:53;735] CONVERSATION THAT ENSURES WE'RE
[000:46:55;170] BEING CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT WE DO.
[000:46:57;272] GENERALLY WE COULD WHAT WE NEED
[000:46:59;741] TO DO TO PROTECT OUR FORCE.
[000:47:01;710] >> Shepard: YOU COMING IN HOT ON
[000:47:02;744] THAT PHONE?
[000:47:03;212] >> OCCASIONALLY, YES, SIR.
[000:47:05;614] >> Shepard: GENERAL, I CAN'T
[000:47:07;049] THANK YOU ENOUGH.
[000:47:08;250] ALL OF THE BEST AND THANK YOU
[000:47:10;185] FOR WHAT YOU DO FOR OUR NATION.
[000:47:11;253] >> IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.
[000:47:13;589] WHAT YOUR YOUNG AMERICANS ARE
[000:47:14;556] DOING AND WHAT THE COALITION
[000:47:16;191] TEAM IS DOING IS SOMETHING FOR
[000:47:17;092] US ALL TO BE PROUD OF.
[000:47:19;695] >> Shepard: HERE, HERE.
