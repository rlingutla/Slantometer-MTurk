[000:00:01;534] WERE ASSEMBLED INSIDE PRESSURE
[000:00:02;869] COOKER POTS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE
[000:00:06;072] PACKED WITH BBs, BALL BEARINGS
[000:00:07;273] AND NAILS TO MAGNIFY THE INJURY.
[000:00:08;341] AS THESE HOMELAND SECURITY
[000:00:10;043] BULLETINS NOTE, PRESSURE COOKERS
[000:00:11;511] HAVE BEEN USED FOR DECADES IN
[000:00:12;812] TERROR BOMBINGS.
[000:00:14;280] INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING THEM
[000:00:16;216] APPEAR ON THE INTERNET INCLUDING
[000:00:17;417] JUST LAST MONTH IN AN AL QAEDA
[000:00:18;985] MAGAZINE "INSPIRE."
[000:00:20;787] INVESTIGATORS SAY THE EXPLOSIVE
[000:00:22;122] IN BOSTON WAS MOST LIKELY
[000:00:23;823] SMOKELESS POWDER, GUNPOWDER LIKE
[000:00:25;658] THIS, AVAILABLE AT SPORTING
[000:00:31;231] GOODS STORES, NOT SOMETHING MORE
[000:00:31;965] POWERFUL LIKE DYNAMITE.
[000:00:32;799] AND THEY BELIEVE THE BOMBS WERE
[000:00:33;767] CARRIED TO THE SCENE IN DARK
[000:00:34;467] NYLON BAGS AND SET OFF BY
[000:00:35;101] TIMERS.
[000:00:36;302] THE FBI IS EXAMINING PHOTOS LIKE
[000:00:38;872] THIS FROM NBC AFFILIATE WHDH TO
[000:00:41;274] SEE IF NYLON BAGS MIGHT HAVE
[000:00:46;613] BEEN PLACED IN TRASH BAGS ON THE
[000:00:47;347] SIDEWALK TO APPEAR LESS
[000:00:47;947] CONSPICUOUS.
[000:00:48;681] A FORMER BOMB INVESTIGATOR SAYS
[000:00:49;416] THE EXPERTS KNOW WHAT TO LOOK
[000:00:50;116] FOR.
[000:00:50;750] >> THEY ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE
[000:00:56;089] THE MINUTE PIECES OF AN ARTICLE
[000:00:58;525] THAT A CIVILIAN WOULDN'T EVEN
[000:00:59;225] KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT A BOMB
[000:00:59;926] INVESTIGATOR LIKE FBI OR ATF
[000:01:00;627] WILL SAY, THAT'S FROM A CLOCK.
[000:01:01;327] THAT'S FROM A BATTERY.
[000:01:01;895] >> Reporter: BOSTON POLICE SAY
[000:01:02;862] THE AREA WAS CHECKED TWICE FOR
[000:01:03;963] BOMBS YESTERDAY, BUT THERE WAS
[000:01:05;532] NO SECURITY SCREENING.
[000:01:11;037] >> BECAUSE THERE IS UNRESTRICTED
[000:01:11;771] ACCESS TO THE RACE COURSE,
[000:01:12;839] SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S 28 MILES
[000:01:13;540] LONG, PEOPLE CAN COME AND GO AND
[000:01:14;274] BRING ITEMS IN AND OUT.
[000:01:15;775] >> Reporter: AUTHORITIES LAST
[000:01:17;110] NIGHT SEARCHED THE APARTMENT OF
[000:01:18;445] A FOREIGN STUDENT WHO WAS
[000:01:19;145] INJURED IN THE BLAST AND SEEN
[000:01:20;380] RUNNING AWAY, BUT THEY FOUND
[000:01:21;614] NOTHING, AND HE IS NOT
[000:01:22;449] CONSIDERED A SUSPECT.
[000:01:25;118] INVESTIGATORS URGE ANYONE WHO
[000:01:26;419] WAS AT THE SCENE YESTERDAY TO
[000:01:27;287] SEND THEM PICTURES AND VIDEOS.
[000:01:30;056] ONE PERSON RESPONDING, BEN
[000:01:31;524] THORNDIKE, WHO WORKS IN A
[000:01:32;392] BUILDING THAT OVERLOOKS THE
[000:01:33;059] FINISH LINE.
[000:01:34;294] HE SNAPPED THESE PICTURES IN
[000:01:36;096] RAPID SEQUENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER
[000:01:37;063] THE FIRST EXPLOSION.
[000:01:39;966] ONE PERSON CAN BE SEEN RUNNING
[000:01:41;201] AWAY, CLOTHES TORN BY THE BLAST.
[000:01:43;269] >> I JUST KEPT THE CAMERA UP,
[000:01:45;672] JUST PUSHED THE RAPID SHUTTER

[000:01:52;479] COURSE OF -- IF FELT LIKE A LONG
[000:01:53;546] TIME, BUT I THINK IT WAS ONLY 15
[000:01:54;514] OR 20 SECONDS.
[000:01:59;853] >> Reporter: POLICE AND FEDERAL
[000:02:00;820] AGENTS EVEN TOOK THE HIGHLY
[000:02:01;488] UNUSUAL STEP OF ASKING PEOPLE
[000:02:02;188] LEAVING BOSTON AT THE AIRPORT

[000:02:03;590] VALUE, TOO.
[000:02:06;793] AND THIS BREAKING NEWS ON
[000:02:07;727] ANOTHER NOTE.
[000:02:08;228] AN UNRELATED NOTE.

[000:02:12;232] SENT TO A U.S. SENATOR BUT
[000:02:13;666] INTERCEPTED AT AN OFF-SITE MAIL
[000:02:14;400] SITE.

[000:02:17;904] POSITIVE FOR THE POISON CALLED
[000:02:19;606] RICIN.
[000:02:21;174] IT'S NOW IN THE LAB TO SEE IF IT

[000:02:58;478] A VIEW THAT CHANGES IN AN
[000:03:00;880] INSTANT.

[000:08:51;097] AND WE HAVE EVERY CONCEIVABLE
[000:08:52;932] ASSET ON THE GROUND, AND THEY
[000:08:54;867] ARE LITERALLY COMBING THE BLAST
[000:08:56;335] SITE WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB TO
[000:08:58;371] PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED AND
[000:09:03;242] ULTIMATELY THE STORY OF HOW AND
[000:09:03;976] BRING WHOMEVER IS RESPONSIBLE TO
[000:09:04;710] JUSTICE.
[000:09:08;214] IT'S A SLOW PROCESS.
[000:09:08;915] IT'S A PAINFUL ONE.
[000:09:11;017] BUT THERE ARE ALSO ALONGSIDE
[000:09:14;020] THIS, BRIAN, SOME EXTRAORDINARY
[000:09:15;488] STORIES OF GRACE AND KINDNESS
[000:09:17;657] THAT PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN, BOTH
[000:09:20;426] NEIGHBORS FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND
[000:09:21;761] VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE
[000:09:22;461] CITY AND THE STATE.
[000:09:25;264] >> I HEARD YOUR PUBLIC PLEA,
[000:09:27;567] GOVERNOR, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS
[000:09:28;768] HELPED BY AN ARMY SERGEANT JUST
[000:09:30;703] BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN.
[000:09:31;938] YOU'RE HELPING TO FIND HIM TO
[000:09:32;905] REUNITE HIM WITH HER.
[000:09:34;240] ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE
[000:09:36;409] LOSE YOU.
[000:09:40;179] AND THAT IS, IT WAS STRIKING
[000:09:40;880] YESTERDAY, THIS HAPPENED WITH
[000:09:43;215] BOSTON PD OFFICERS IN THE
[000:09:45;151] FOREGROUND, MEANING IF YOU CAN
[000:09:47;820] GET A DEVICE INTO AN ALREADY
[000:09:48;788] SECURED AREA, WHAT'S THAT GOING
[000:09:49;522] TO MEAN FOR DEFENDING CITIES
[000:09:50;489] LIKE BOSTON?
[000:09:53;759] >> WELL, I THINK THE THING TO
[000:09:55;194] REMEMBER HERE -- MAYBE TWO
[000:09:55;962] THINGS TO REMEMBER.
[000:09:57;496] FIRST OF ALL, THE FIRST JOB OF
[000:10:01;634] EVERYBODY IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO
[000:10:02;969] IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED
[000:10:05;638] AND PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED AND
[000:10:08;040] TO BRING THAT PERSON OR PERSONS
[000:10:09;375] TO JUSTICE.
[000:10:10;109] AND THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT
[000:10:14;814] IS FOCUSED ON.
[000:10:15;281] THE SECOND THING, THEN, IS TO
[000:10:15;982] SORT OUT HOW THIS COULD HAVE
[000:10:16;682] HAPPENED.
[000:10:17;216] YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD 116 YEARS OF
[000:10:18;217] INCIDENT-FREE MARATHONS.
[000:10:21;120] AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE LEARNED
[000:10:22;188] LESSONS FROM THE ONE BEFORE.
[000:10:25;725] IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE AND
[000:10:27;059] BLOODY LESSON WE'RE HAVING TO
[000:10:28;027] LEARN THIS TIME.
[000:10:30;563] BUT I AM ALSO CONFIDENT THAT WE
[000:10:32;131] WILL LEARN WHAT LESSONS THERE
[000:10:34;467] ARE TO BE LEARNED, AND NEXT
[000:10:35;901] YEAR'S MARATHON WILL BE BIGGER
[000:10:36;736] AND BETTER THAN EVER.
[000:10:37;370] >> THE GOVERNOR OF THE
[000:10:38;471] COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS,

[000:12:57;276] THE NEXT MAJOR MARATHON IS THIS

[000:12:58;511] FOR THAT MATTER THERE'S A MAJOR
[000:12:59;345] SPORTING EVENT EVERY DAY ALL
[000:13:03;716] YEAR ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
[000:13:10;156] AND THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT
[000:13:21;367] HOW TO DEFEND AND SECURE THOSE.

[000:14:32;838] >> I THINK THE EVENT IN BOSTON
[000:14:34;540] YESTERDAY WILL RAISE ONCE AGAIN

[000:14:38;310] A REASON, THERE IS A NEED FOR

[000:14:42;548] >> Reporter: SINCE 9/11, THERE'S
[000:14:43;415] BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE

[000:19:00;405] THEY SAID IT WAS A GLITCH AND

[000:28:55;400] AT THAT MOMENT, I MEAN I DIDN'T
[000:28:56;968] KNOW WHERE MY SON WAS.
[000:28:59;604] MOMENTS LATER THERE WAS A SECOND
[000:29:02;741] BOMBING OR EXPLOSION AND IT WAS
[000:29:04;743] JUST -- IT WAS JUST

[000:29:20;258] THE ANDERSONS WAS THE HOTEL.

[000:29:26;131] >> MIKE CAME IN AND WE BOTH JUST
[000:29:29;367] HUGGED EACH OTHER.

[000:29:37;509] I MEAN WE JUST -- WE HUGGED EACH
[000:29:43;815] OTHER.
[000:29:44;048] BUT IT'S -- IT'S JUST
[000:29:48;586] UNBELIEVABLE.
