00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
AN OFFICIAL TELLS US AFTERWARDS

185
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THAT SO FAR, THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT,

186
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING.

187
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
THEY ALSO SAY THEY ARE GETTING

188
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
GOOD COOPERATION NOW FROM

189
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
RUSSIA, WITH WHOM AS YOU KNOW

190
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THE U.S. HAS HAD VERY ROCKY

191
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
RELATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW

192
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
YEARS.

193
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT

194
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
VLADIMIR PUTIN SPOKE WITH

195
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST NIGHT AND

196
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
THE TWO LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING

197
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING MORE

198
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
CLOSELY TOGETHER ON

199
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
COUNTERTERRORISM IN THE FUTURE.

200
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
THE FBI AS YOU HEARD SAID AFTER

201
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
INTERVIEWING TAMERLAN AT

202
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
RUSSIA'S REQUEST IN 2011, THEY
SOUGHT AND FAILED TO GET MORE

203
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA'S

204
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
INTELLIGENCE AND STATE SECURITY
AGENCIES, SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS

205
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
STILL TO ANSWER.

206
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
DID THESE BROTHERS JOIN EXISTING

207
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
SEPARATE CHECHEN FACTIONS?

208
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
IF SO, WHY WEREN'T THEY ATTACK

209
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
ING RUSSIAN TARGETS?
WHY DID THEY GO AFTER THEIR NEW

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
HOMELAND, THE U.S.?

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THIS IS A BIG MYSTERY.

212
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT IS

213
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
OFFICIALS, ALSO STATE AND LOCAL

215
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OFFICIALS, BUT THEY

216
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
ARE STILL ASKING WHY DID SOMEONE
WHO WAS ALREADY IN THE FBI'S

217
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
DATABASE GET THROUGH THE CRACKS.

218
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000

WATERTOWN WHERE THIS ALL ENDED

222
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
IS ONLY ABOUT 60 OFFICERS STRONG
AND OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, IT

223
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
WAS TESTED IN WAYS THAT EVEN THE

224
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
BIGGEST POLICE FORCES WILL

225
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
RARELY OR EVER EXPERIENCE.

226
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THIS AFTERNOON, I SPOKE WITH

ABOUT THE LARGER IMPLICATIONS OF

229
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WHAT HIS OFFICERS ACCOMPLISHED.

230
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN NOW,

231
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THE WEAPONS, THE FACT THEY HAD

232
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
OTHER EXPLOSIVES, IN YOUR MIND,

233
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
DO YOU THINK THEY WERE PREPARED

234
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
TO ATTACK AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE?

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
>> OH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

236
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
FOR SURE, BUT MY GUT TELLS ME

237
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000

242
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THEY WERE SAVING THAT FOR

SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE BOSTON

244
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
