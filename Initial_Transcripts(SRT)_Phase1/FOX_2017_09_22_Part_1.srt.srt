KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL WAS  
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO COME OUT

32
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,547
AGAINST THE BILL.               
HIS REASONING, IT DOESN'T GO FAR

33
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,449
ENOUGH TO REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE

HE'S LEANING AGAINST SUPPORTING 
THIS GRAHAM-CASSIDY LEGISLATION.

COLLINS IS ONE OF THE NO VOTES  
ON HEALTHCARE REFORM IN JULY.   

42
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,216
THERE WAS PRESIDENT TO SUPPORT

VICE PRESIDENT PENCE URGING HER

PRESIDENT REPUBLICAN SOURCES    

52
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,757
HOPE THIS TEAM WOULD BE         
DIFFERENT IF FOR NO OTHER REASON

53
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,060
THAN JOHN McCAIN'S BEST FRIEND  
IN THE WORLD IS LINDSAY GRAHAM,

>> THEY'RE VOI VOWING TO        

56
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,602
CONTINUE THE FIGHT, PRAISING    
SENATOR McCAIN FOR STANDING UP  

57
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,438
AND STOPPING THIS BILL.         
BOTTOM LINE, A NUMBER OF        

58
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:35,948
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY PISH THE     
BIPARTISAN TALKS TO TRY TO FIX  

59
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,349
OBAMACARE WERE CONTINUING.      
>> I FELT LIKE WE WERE MAKING   

60
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,919
STEADY PROS TOWARD A BIPARTISAN 
COMPROMISE TO ADDRESS THE       

61
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,590
CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS WITH    
OBAMACARE REPEAL.               

62
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,526
THERE'S AN AN ABRUPT HALT BY THE
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE WILL  

63
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,896
HAVE A VOTE THIS COMING WEEK ON 
THIS BILL.                      

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,799
I HAVE CONCERNS HOW IT WILL     
AFFECT DELAWARE AND THE COUNTRY 

65
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:58,237
AND I PLAN TO VOTE AGAINST IT.  
>> MITCH McCONNELL INTENDS TO   

66
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,441
BRING UP GRAHAM-CASSIDY NEXT    
WEEK BUT THAT WAS BEFORE HE HAD 

67
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,643
TWO HARD NO VOTES AGAINST THE   
BILL.                           

68

>> Shepard: CHRIS WALLACE,      

69
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,050
MODERATOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY." 
JOHN McCAIN GAVE HIS REASONS.   

70
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:17,089
LAST TIME AROUND, HE MADE A     
PRETTY CLEAR STATEMENT WHEN HE  

71
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:21,293
WAS THAT DRAMATIC VOTE FOR NO.  
WE HAVE A FULL SCREEN OF THAT   

72
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,794
I'D LIKE TO SHOW THE VIEWING    
AUDIENCE.                       

73
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:28,000
HERE IT IS.                     
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID LAST TIME. 

74
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,201
THE CONGRESS MUST NOW RETURN TO 
REGULAR ORDER.                  

75
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,402
HOLD HEARINGS.                  
RECEIVE INPUT FROM MEMBERS OF   

76
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,839
BOTH PARTIES.                   
AND HEED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF 

77
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:38,143
OUR NATION'S GOVERNORS SO THAT  
WE CAN PRODUCE A BILL THAT      

78
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,679
FINALLY PROVIDES AMERICANS WITH 
ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE

79
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,148
HEALTHCARE.                     
THAT PART OF IT HADN'T CHANGED, 

80
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,752
THOUGH THIS IS TECHNICALLY      
REGULAR ORDER IT WASN'T.        

81
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,855
COMMITTEES HAD MET ON IT, AND   
THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE 

82
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,257
HADN'T MARKED IT UP.            
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.               

83
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,326
THE COMMITTEES HAVE NOT MET ON  
IT.                             

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,828
THEY'LL HOLD ONE OR TWO HEARINGS
THIS NEXT WEEK.                 

85
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,033
SIMPLY, I THINK, TRYING TO      
SATISFY JOHN McCAIN,nd SOME     

86
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:07,205
OTHERS WHO SAID THIS IS A HECK  
OF A WAY TO COMPLETELY REFORM   

87
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,574
THE HEALTH SYSTEM, ONE-SIXTH OF 
THE ECONOMY.                    

88
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,711
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A CBL    
SCORE, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET     

89
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:16,915
OFFICE.                         
THE IMPACT ON PREMIUMS OR THE   

90
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,921
IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY LOSING    

91
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,122
THEIR COVERAGE.                 
JOHN McCAIN DECIDED TO PULL THE 

92
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,257
PLUG EARLY.                     
MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE  

93
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,858
ONE, THE FINAL VOTE AS HE WAS   
LAST TIME, WHEN HE LITERALLY PUT

94
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,760
HIS THUMB DOWN.                 
BUT HE MADE IT CLEAR HE'S A NO  

95
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:31,129
VOTE.                           
RAND PAUL HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE'S

96
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,498
A NO VOTE.                      
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE LINE     

97
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,703
ABOUT THE KNIGHT AND THE PRINCE,
IN THE PRINCESS BRIDE, IT'S     

98
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,706
MOSTLY DEAD, THIS IS MOSTLY DEAD
RIGHT NOW.                      

99
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,442
I SUPPOSE SUSAN COLLINS COULD   
CHANGE BUT SHE'S BEEN AGAINST   

100
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,611
ALL OF THESE REPEAL AND REPLACE 
PLANS.                          

101
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,947
I'D BE SHOCKED IF SHE WERE TO   
CHANGE.                         

102
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,184
LISA MURKOWSKI HAS BEEN AGAINST 
ALMOST ALL OF THEM.             

103
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,954
I'D BE A LITTLE LESS SHOCKED IF 
SHE CHANGED.                    

104
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,125
SHELLEY MOORE OF WEST VIRGINIA, 
ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO, GRASSLEY   

105
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,529
AND EARNS THE FROM IOWA.        
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION.    

106
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,366
IT'S ON- SUPPORT, WOULD BE AN   
OVERSTATEMENT.                  

107
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,237
ON LIFE SUPPORT.                
>> Shepard: LISA MURKOWSKI OF   

108
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:18,076
ALASKA, THERE'S A LARGE GIFT    
BASKET WAITING IN THE WINGS,    

109
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,544
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FOR THE   
PEOPLE OF ALASKA IF SHE CHANGES 

110
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,647
HER MIND.                       
>> YES, THERE'S A PROVISION FOR 

111
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,184
SPARSELY POPULATED STATES,      
ALASKA CERTAINLY QUALIFIES AS A 

112
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,287
SPARSELY POPULATED STATE, THAT  
THEY WOULD NOT FALL UNDER ALL OF

113
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,258
THE PROVISIONS AND IT WOULD MAKE
SURE THAT THEY GOT MORE FUNDING 

114
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,228
RATHER THAN LESS FUNDING WHICH  
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE IF THEY    

115
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,797
WERE TREATED LIKE EVERY OTHER   
STATE.                          

116
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,468
THIS IS, IT'S INTERESTING TO    
SEE, SHEP, WE ALL REMEMBER      

117
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,003
OBAMACARE, ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS
THAT REPUBLICANS HAD AT THE TIME

118
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,005
ABOUT THE MESSY WAY THAT WAS    
PASSED.                         

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,441
WE HAVE A PASS IT IN ORDER TO   
FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT.          

120
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,978
THINGS ARE JAMMED DOWN.         
THERE WAS THE CORNHUSKER        

121
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,746
KICKBACK, ALL OF THE SPECIAL    
DEALS TO BUY THE VOTES OF       

122
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,249
SENATORS.                       
YOU'RE SEEING ALL OF THAT IF NOT

123
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:02,154
MORE ON THE PART OF REPUBLICANS 
THIS TIME.                      

124
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:09,694
IT'S PERFECT HYPOCRISY, WHAT YOU
SEE ON CAPITOL HILL.            

125
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,229
>> Shepard: I WANTED TO SPEAK   
SPECIAL ABOUT SUSAN COLLINS OF  

126
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,198
MAINE.                          
FOR HER, SHE SAID REPEATEDLY, I 

127
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,499
THINK, CHRIS, THIS IS ABOUT     
MEDICAID.                       

128
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,603
HER CONCERNS ABOUT IT.          
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.          

129
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,674
IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE        
FORMULA, MAINE WOULD DO BETTER, 

130
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,843
THERE ARE SOME STATES, ABOUT 31 
STATES THAT ARE LOSERS IN THIS  

131
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,012
BILL.                           
THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE WINNERS.

132
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,048
MAINE WOULD BE A WINNER.        
BUT SHE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT  

133
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,552
THE MEDICAID.                   
IT TURNS IT FROM A BASICALLY    

134
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:38,657
OPEN-ENDED ENTITLEMENT INTO A   
BLOCK GRANT AND EVENTUALLY A    

135
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,426
FORMULA WITH DIMINISHING        
FINANCING PER CAPITA, PER       

136
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,930
PERSON.                         
IN THE LONG RUN, CERTAINLY AFTER

137
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:49,234
2026, PEOPLE ON MEDICAID GET    
LESS FUNDING THAN IN THE PAST.  

138
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,605
SUSAN COLLINS IS MAD ABOUT THAT.
YOU SAW THE GOVERNOR, THE       

139
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,674
INDEPENDENT GOFF OF MAINE       
JOIN -- GOVERNOR OF MAINE TO    

140
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,177
JOIN WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT TO 
URGE HER TO DO IT.              

141
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,813
SHE'S REPORTING A LOT OF FOLKS  
IN MAINE LIKE HER STAND AGAINST 

142
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:06,952
PASSING THIS BILL.              
>> Shepard: IT SEEMS THAT LAST  

143
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,487
TIME THE REPUBLICANS CAME UP    
WITH A PLAN, IT ONLY HAD 17%    

144
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,957
APPROVAL ACROSS THE NATION.     
THIS TIME THE CONCERN SEEMS TO  

145
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:16,561
BE IF NOT PRIMARILY, LARGELY,   
ABOUT A CAP ON LIFETIME BENEFITS

146
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,231
FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING    
CONDITIONS.                     

147
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,535
AND THEY'RE DISCUSSING THIS IN  
THE JIMMY KIMMEL WAY, IF YOU    

148
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,206
HAVE A CHILD WHO NEEDS MULTIPLE 
IN HIS CASE HEART SURGERIES AND 

149
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,976
YOU HAVE A MILLION DOLLAR CAP   
AND YOUR CHILD DICE AS A RESULT 

150
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,612
OF THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE      
ENOUGH MONEY THAT SEEMS TO BE A 

151
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:38,783
CONCERN FOR A LOT OF VOTERS.    
>> LOOK, THE PROBLEM IS THAT    

152
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,487
WHAT THIS DOES IS BASICALLY     
KEEPS ALL OF THE TAXES FROM     

153
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,423
OBAMACARE AND DOES AWAY WITH THE
MANDATES, DOES AWAY WITH THE    

154
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:50,128
MEDICAL DEVICE TAX.             
IT TAKES THE OTHER BIG TAXES AND

155
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,330
SIMPLY GIVES IT BACK TO THE     
STATE AND SAYS FEDERALISM, YOU  

156
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,234
DO IT.                          
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY STATE 

157
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:01,840
WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN AND 
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET WAIVERS  

158
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,308
FROM THE DEPARTMENT, FROM       
WASHINGTON, FROM THE DEPARTMENT 

159
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,777
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF 
APPROPRIATE AND AFFORDABLE      

160
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,179
COVERAGE.                       
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS.   

161
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,617
NOW, THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT  
SOME STATES, LIBERAL STATES,    

162
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:18,423
BLUE STATES, WOULD HAVE VERY    
LENIENT BENEFITS AND WOULD, FOR 

163
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,325
INSTANCE, PEOPLE WITH           
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE WELL

164
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,193
COVERED.                        
OTHER STATES WE AREN'T SURE.    

165
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,963
WHO KNOWS WHAT A WAIVER FOR     
APPROPRIATE AND AFFORDABLE      

166
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,098
COVERAGE MEANS.                 
THERE IS A CONCERN.             

167
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,170
WE DON'T KNOW, IN FACT, BUT     
THERE IS A CONCERN THAT SOME SAY

168
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,241
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS MAY
SAY ON PAPER THEY CAN GET       

169
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,044
COVERAGE BUT IN TERMS OF THE    
FINANCING, COST OF THE PREMIUMS 

170
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,113
OR DEDUCTIBLES, THEY CAN'T.     
>> Shepard: IT'S NOT DEAD BUT   

171
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,249
IT'S EXTREMELY COLD AND         
EXTREMELY WHITE.                

172
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:48,587
>> IT'S MOSTLY DEAD.            
>> Shepard: THE LEADERS OF NORTH

173
00:09:48,721 --> 00:10:06,938
KOREA AND UNITED STATES ARE     
PERSON                          

174
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,410
      ALLY INSULTING EACH OTHER 
AND BRINGING THE NUCLEAR        

175
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,745
STANDOFF TO A NEW LEVEL.        
THE DICTATOR KIM JUDGE UN HAS   

176
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,213
CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP MENTALLY 
DERANGED N A PERSONAL STATEMENT,

THAT WAS DURING HIS SPEECH TO   
THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL      

182
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,852
ASSEMBLY.                       
ACCORDING TO NORTH KOREAN STATE 

183
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,187
TELEVISION, KIM JUNG UN SAID    
WHATEVER TRUMP MIGHT HAVE       

184
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,488
EXPECTED HE WILL FACE RESULTS   
BEYOND HIS EXPECTATION.         

185
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:29,260
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED THIS    
MORNING, KIM JUN-UN OF NORTH    

186
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,230
KOREA, OBVIOUS LAY MADMAN,      
DOESN'T MIND STARVING AND       

187
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,368
KILLING HIS PEOPLE, WILL BE     
TESTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE.       

188
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,205
NOW, NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN MIN  
CITY SAID THEY MIGHT CONSIDER   

189
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,307
TESTING A HYDROGEN BOMB IN THE  
PACIFIC OCEAN.                  

190
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:48,446
HERE'S HOW THE SECRETARY OF     
STATE, REX TILLERSON, RESPONDED 

191
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,547
TO THAT.                        
>> ALL OF OUR MILITARY OPTIONS  

192
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,216
ARE ON THE TABLE AS THE         
PRESIDENT SAID.                 

193
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,853
THERE WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND     
THERE IS ASSEMBLED A NATIONAL   

194
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,488
SECURITY COUNCIL THAT MEETS ON  
EACH OF THESE ISSUES TO ADVISE  

195
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,857
THE PRESIDENT.                  
IT WILL BE HIS DECISION         

196
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,460
ULTIMATELY.                     
>> Shepard: SECRETARY TILLERSON 

197
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,330
SAID THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE     
EFFORTS IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA 

198
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,900
A BACK TO CHRIS WALLACE.        
GOING AT IT LIKE CHILDREN IN A  

199
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,002
PLAYGROUND, DOES THIS LEAD TO   
WAR?                            

200
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,972
YESTERDAY THE STOCK MARKET      
SEEMED TO SUGGEST SO, 10 DEFENSE

201
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:19,377
STOCKS HIT THE ALL-TIME HIGH.   
>> WE'RE A WAYS AWAY FROM THAT. 

202
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,114
GENERAL McMASTER, H.R. McMASTER,
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, SAID 

203
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,984
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROAD.      
THERE IS MORE ROAD.             

204
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,254
YOU CAN SEE THAT YESTERDAY WHEN 
THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT HE 

205
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:33,124
SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER GIVING
THE TREASURY SECRETARY THE      

206
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,895
POWERS TO CUT OFF ANY TRADE, ANY
DEALINGS WITH ANY COMPANY, ANY  

207
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,664
BANK, THAT HAS TRADE OR DEALINGS
WITH NORTH KOREA.               

208
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:46,037
PRESIDENT ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT   
CHINESE, THE CHINESE CENTRAL    

209
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,605
BANK, IN ACCOUNT THEIR FEDERAL  
RESERVE, IS ORDERING ALL OF     

210
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,212
THEIR BANKS TO CUT OFF ANY      
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH     

211
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:59,317
PYONGYANG, WITH THE KIM REGIME. 
WE'LL WAIT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS, 

212
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:04,189
WHETHER SQUEEZING NORTH KOREA IN
THAT FINANCIAL AND TRADE SENSE  

213
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,891
SHAKES ANY SENSE INTO THE KIM   
REGIME AND GETS THEM TO STAND   

214
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:11,329
DOWN.                           
THE QUESTION, SHEP, IS WHETHER  

215
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,933
KIM HAS MADE IN EFFECT AN       
EXISTENTIAL CHOICE, BELIEVES    

216
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,737
THAT HAVING A LONG-RANGE        
BALLISTIC MISSILE WITH A NUCLEAR

217
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,307
WAR HEAD ON IT IS NOT THE PATH  
TO DISASTER BUT THE PATH TO     

218
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,177
SURVIVAL FOR HIS REGIME.        
YOU KNOW, HE LOOKS AROUND THE   

219
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,214
WORLD, SEES SADDAM HUSSEIN, NO  
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,    

220
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:34,185
ENDED UP DEAD.                  
SAME WITHCA DAFIE AND MAY       

221
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,758
HAVE -- KHADAFFI.               
THE THING THAT ENSURES HIS      

222
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,426
SURVIVAL HE BELIEVES IS TO HAVE 
A NUCLEAR WEAPON.               

223
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,596
>> Shepard: WONDER WHAT KIND OF 
REACTION HE'D GET TO AN H-BOMB  

224
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,232
TEST IN THE PACIFIC.            
>> WE HAVE HAD H-BOMB TESTS     

225
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,568
BEFORE, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,  
WE THINK, IT WAS UNDERGROUND.   

226
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,804
THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE MORE    
STUNNING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE    

227
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,373
OVER GROUND.                    
IT WOULD BE OVER THE WATER.     

228
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,176
WE WOULD SEE THE MUSHROOM CLOUD 
THAT WOULD BRING HOME WHAT THE  

229
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,445
THREAT IS.                      
DO I THINK WE'LL GO TO WAR OVER 

230
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,948
A NUCLEAR TEST, PROBABLY NOT.   
PARTICULARLY NOT WITH ALL OF    

231
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,084
THESE SANCTIONS JUST GETTING    
STARTED.                        

232
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,219
>> Shepard: CHRIS WALLACE, FROM

 THE WAY OF A TOUCHING MOMENT?

 PSORIASIS, YOU CAN EMBRACE     

249
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,788
    THE CHANCE OF COMPLETELY    
    CLEAR SKIN WITH TALTZ.      

250
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:56,227
TALTZ IS PROVEN TO GIVE YOU A

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,443
TALTZ MAY INCREASE YOUR         
RISK OF INFECTIONS              

257
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,379

TO FIGHT THEM.                  

258
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,947
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF             
YOU ARE BEING TREATED

     NOW'S YOUR CHANCE AT       
     COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.     

265
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,697
        JUST ASK YOUR

CONTROVERSIAL TRAVEL BAND.      
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 

283
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,806
HAS TAILORED RESTRICTIONS TO    
EACH COUNTRY.                   

284
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,210
BASED ON WHAT THEY CALL MULTIPLE
FACTORS INCLUDING THE THREAT    

285
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,379
EACH COUNTRY POSES AND WHETHER  
IT COOPERATES WITH U.S.         

286
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,915
REGULATIONS.                    
THE NEW RULES WOULD REPLACE

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EARLIER       
EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT BANNED

MAJORITY COUNTRIES.             

289
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,490
BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING TO HEAR 
WHICH COUNTRIES THE NEW TRAVEL  

290
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,194
RULES WILL AFFECT.

KEVIN?                          

293
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:50,401
>> RIGHT ON THE MONEY, SHEPARD. 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS SIX

294
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,703
COUNTRY, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY 
COUNTRIES WILL BE INVOLVED IN   

295
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,908
THE NEW TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS.    
WE DO HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY 

296
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:59,477
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN        
LEARNING FROM ADMINISTRATION    

297
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:03,414
SOURCES AND BASE ON WHAT WE     
LEARNED FROM A RECENTLY         

298
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,886
CONCLUDED CALL THE NUMBER OF    
COUNTRIES INVOLVED WILL LIKELY  

299
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,388
EXPAND TO INCLUDE MORE THAN THE 
ORIGINAL SIX COUNTRIES THAT WE  

300
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:11,522
TALKED ABOUT.                   
LET ME SHARE PART OF AN         

301
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,424
ADMINISTRATION STATEMENT THEY'VE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IDEA OF 

302
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,027
SECURING THE HOMELAND AND MOST  
IMPORTANTLY PROTECTING THE      

303
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,931
AMERICAN PEOPLE.                
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ENSURE

304
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,201
WE ONLY ADMIT THOSE PROPERLY    
VOTED AND WILL NOT POSE A THREAT

305
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:24,535
TO NATIONAL SECURITY OR PUBLIC  
SAFETY.                         

306
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,106
SO IN EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF   
COUNTRIES ON THE LIST THE       

307
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,908
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AS YOU  
SAID, TO CREATE MORE            

308
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,010
RESTRICTIONS BUT ON A           
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.             

309
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,948
THIS IS ALSO RELEVANT FOR ONE   
MAJOR IMPORTANT REASON, THAT IS 

310
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:40,418
BY EXPANDING IT AND MAKING IT   
COUNTRY-TO-COUNTRY, SHEPARD,    

311
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,321
WHAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY TRYING 
TO DO IS BLUNT PERHAPS SOME OF  

312
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,723
THE LEGAL PUSHBACK THAT THE     
ADMINISTRATION HAS PREVIOUSLY   

313
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,127
GOTTEN.                         
YOU MAY RECALL THE STATE        

314
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,363
DEPARTMENT SAID THERE WERE LIKE 
17 COUNTRIES NOT UP TO U.S.     

315
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,134
STANDARDS AND FAILED TO FALL    
INTO COMPLIANCE B HALF HAVE.    

316
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:14,185
WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT NUMBER LOOKS
LIKE.                           

317
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,223
I WANT TO SHARE A TWEET THAT THE
PRESIDENT SENT OUT AFTER AN     

318
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,458
ATTACK ON LONDON.               
I THINK IT'S INSTRUCTIVE, WILL  

319
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,592
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT HE'S   
BEEN THINKING.                  

320
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,960
THIS IS BACK IN SEPTEMBER 15.   
A TRAVEL BAN INTO THE U.S.      

321
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,195
SHOULD BE FOR LARGER, TOUGHER,  
AND MORE SPECIFIC.              

322
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,196
INDEED THAT APPEARS TO BE THE   
CASE.
