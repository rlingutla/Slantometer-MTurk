00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
IN THE VIDEO, THE AUTHORITIES

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
SAY THE WHITE SMOKE INDICATES A

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
BOMB BUILT WITH LOW-VELOCITY

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES, NOT MILITARY

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
GRADE.
>> SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
>> RUN!
>> THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
RESOURCES AS WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
BOMB ATTACKS, BUT THEY KNEW HOW

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
TO MAKE THE BOMB GO BOOM.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
>> Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THE

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
LARGE PIECES OF METAL, AS SEEN

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
HERE IN THE AIR, SUGGEST THE

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
BOMBS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCEALED

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
IN OR UNDER A MAILBOX OR TRASH

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
BARREL, AS ONE WITNESS

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
DESCRIBED.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
>> I LITERALLY SAW THE GARBAGE

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
BARREL EXPLODE.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I SAW AT THE FLASH, THE FIRE,

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
THE SMOKE, AND I RAN AS FAST AS

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I COULD.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
>> Reporter: MIKE SULLIVAN IS

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ATF.

24
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
>> ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
COLLECT IT IS, IT MIGHT NOT LOOK

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
LIKE MUCH.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
BUT TO INVESTIGATORS,

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
EVERY SMALL PIECE OF EVIDENCE
THEY COLLECT WILL BE A TREASURE

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
TROVE.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
>> Reporter: IF THE FBI BELIEF
ABOUT THE PRESSURE COOKER BEARS

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OUT, IT WILL BE NO SURPRISE TO

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS WHO

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
HAVE WARNED ABOUT THEIR POSSIBLE

COMPONENTS FOR YEARS.

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
THERE ARE NUMEROUS DESCRIPTIONS

37
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
ONLINE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A

38
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
PRESSURE-COOKER BOMB, INCLUDING

39
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
THIS DETAILED ONE POSTED IN AN

40
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
AL QAEDA INTERNET PUBLICATION.

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
APRIL IS ALSO A MONTH WITH

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
SIGNIFICANCE FOR DOMESTIC TERROR

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
GROUPS.

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THE MONTH OF THE WACO RAID AND

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
AS PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE CLEAR

47
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
TODAY, THERE'S STILL NO EVIDENCE

48
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS

49
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
ACT OF TERRORISM.

50
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
>> THIS WAS A HEINOUS AND

51
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
COWARDLY ACT, AND GIVEN WHAT WE

52
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE,

53
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING IT AS

54
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.

55
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> Reporter: THE FBI AGENTS TELL

56
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
US THEY HAVE TONS OF VIDEO, AND

57
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SOMEWHERE IN THERE WILL BE A

58
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
PICTURE OF THE PERSON WHO

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
PLANTED THESE TWO BOMBS, DIANE.

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
>> SPEAKING OF PICTURES, I WANT

61
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
TO ASK YOU ABOUT A PHOTO THAT

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
EVERYBODY WAS E-MAILING TODAY.

63
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
IT IS A MAN STANDING UP ON TOP

64
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
OF A ROOF.

65
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
YOU CAN MOVE IN THERE, YOU SEE

66
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
IT RIGHT THERE.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

67
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S VERY

68
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
INTRIGUING, BUT AUTHORITIES SAY

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THEY'RE GIVING IT NO SPECIAL

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
PRIORITY.

71
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
IT'S ONE OF MANY TIPS AND LEADS

72
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THEY'RE FOLLOWING.

73
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE

74
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
PERSON WHO HAD THAT UNUSUALLY

75
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
HEAVY BLACK BAG THE DAY OF THE

76
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
RACE.

77
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
>> AS YOU SAID THE STRONGEST

78
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
CLUES ARE IN THE NATURE OF THE

79
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
BOMB.

80

EVEN LEAVING THE CHARACTERISTIC

90
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
WHITE SMOKE.

91
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
BOMBS DESIGNED TO SPREAD TERROR

92
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
AND DEATH WITH A LETHAL BLAST OF

93
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
METAL SHRAPNEL.

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000

AND MAIM.

>> Reporter: HOLD IT RIGHT
THERE.

96
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
HERE WE SEE WINDOWS BLOWN OUT

97
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HERE, BUT THE BUILDINGS

98
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THEMSELVES ARE INTACT.

99
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT

100
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
WHAT THIS BOMBER WANTED TO DO?

101
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
>> THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE

102
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
DOWN THE BUILDING.

103
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THAT WASN'T HIS MAIN TARGET.

104
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
IT WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARATHON

105
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
AND KILL PEOPLE IN THAT

106
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
IMMEDIATE AREA.

107
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
>> Reporter: HOUSTON SAYS THIS

108
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
IS CLASSIC IED DESIGN, THE KILL

109
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
ZONE FROM THE BLAST, ONE TO TWO

110
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
YARDS.

111
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTS FROM

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
THE BOMB'S SITE, POWERFUL ENOUGH

113
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
TO KNOCK A RUNNER OFF HIS FEET

114
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TEN YARDS AWAY.

115
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000

AWAY.

119
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A BASIC DESIGN

OF AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE

DEVICE.

122
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
HOWEVER, THE PLACEMENT OF IT IS

123
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
SOPHISTICATED.

124
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000

PLANNING AND EXECUTION TELL US

134
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
THAT THE TERRORIST WAS

135
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
WELL-TRAINED.

136
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT'S

OF ANY ONE ORGANIZATION.

AND WHEN WE COME BACK, YOU'LL

448
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
MEET A SURGEON WHO KNEW ABOUT

449
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
TRAUMA IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.

450
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
HE RAN THE MARATHON, AND THEN

451
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
FACED IT AGAIN.

452
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
COPD includes emphysema
and chronic bronchitis.

453
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
SPIRIVA is a once-daily inhaled
COPD maintenance treatment

454
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
that helps open my obstructed
airways for a full 24 hours.

455
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know, SPIRIVA helps
me breathe easier.

456
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
SPIRIVA HandiHaler Tiotropium
Bromide Inhalation Powder

457
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
does not replace fast-acting
inhalers for sudden symptoms.

458
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Tell your doctor if you
have kidney problems,

459
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
glaucoma, trouble urinating,
or an enlarged prostate.

460
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
These may worsen with SPIRIVA.

461
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Discuss all medicines you
take, even eye drops.

462
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Stop taking SPIRIVA and seek
immediate medical help

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
if your breathing
suddenly worsens,

464
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
your throat or tongue swells,
you get hives, vision changes

465
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
or eye pain, or problems
passing urine.

466
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Other side effects include
dry mouth and constipation.

467
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Nothing can reverse COPD.

468
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
SPIRIVA helps me
breathe better.

469
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Does breathing with
COPD weigh you down?

470
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't wait to ask your
doctor about SPIRIVA.

471
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A BODY AT REST
TENDS TO STAY AT REST...

472
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

473
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.

474
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

476
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

477
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

478
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

479
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

480
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION.

481
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

482
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

483
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

484
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN
WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD.

485
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

486
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS

487
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
WITH THE RISKS.

488
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
ALL PRESCRIPTION NSAIDS,
LIKE CELEBREX, IBUPROFEN,

489
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
NAPROXEN AND MELOXICAM

490
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

491
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

492
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

493
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

494
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
OR RISK FACTORS
SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

495
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
FOR LONG PERIODS.

496
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,

497
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS

498
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

499
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

500
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.

501
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
AND THE ELDERLY

502
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR
STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.

503
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
DON'T TAKE CELEBREX

504
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
IF YOU HAVE BLEEDING
IN THE STOMACH OR INTESTINE,

505
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
OR HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK, HIVES,

506
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OTHER ALLERGIES TO ASPIRIN,
NSAIDS OR SULFONAMIDES.

507
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
GET HELP RIGHT AWAY IF YOU HAVE
SWELLING OF THE FACE OR THROAT,

508
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000

512
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
FOR A BODY IN MOTION.

513
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
N AND AMID THE GRIEF OF THOSE

514
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WHO WERE LOST, THERE WERE SO

515
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
MANY PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED US.

516
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
EARLIER TODAY I TALKED IT TRAUMA

517
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SURGEON, DR. DAVID KING, WHO HAD

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
SAVED LIVES IN IRAQ AND

519
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
AFGHANISTAN, AND YESTERDAY RAN
THE MARATHON AND THEN DID IT

520
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
AGAIN.
>> YOU COMPLETED THE MARATHON?

521
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

522
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I WAS IN THE ATHLETE'S RECOVERY

523
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
AREA FOR ABOUT 30 TO 45 MINUTES.

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
BUT ESSENTIALLY JUST LEFT THERE

525
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF AND, OF

526
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
COURSE, IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE

527
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
HOSPITAL.

528
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF

529
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS?

530
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
>> THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE

531
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
EMERGENCY ROOM AND LOOKED AT THE

532
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
CASUALTIES, WITHOUT EVEN

533
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
EXAMINING THE PATIENTS IN

534
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
DETAIL, I COULD JUST SEE THE

535
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
PATTERN OF INJURY, AND I THOUGHT

536
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
TO MYSELF, THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE

537
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I WAS BACK IN IRAQ OR

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
AFGHANISTAN.

539
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
>> YOU'RE FINDING METALLIC

540
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
PARTICLES, SMALL METAL BALLS,

541
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
NAILS, SCREWS IN THESE WOUNDS?

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THEY

544
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
ARE.

545
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
