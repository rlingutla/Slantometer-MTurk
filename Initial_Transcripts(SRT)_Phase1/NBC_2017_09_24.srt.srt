NO CELL SERVICE AND NO

THIS MAN IS A POLICE OFFICER.   
THE HURRICANE DESTROYED HIS HOME

WON'T BE MEASURED IN WEEKS, BUT 

249
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,700
MONTHS.

NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SAYS

NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

ALABAMA FOR A LOOK AT A WORLD   
THAT WILL EXISTED ON LAND MOR   

262
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,244
I just saved a bunch of money on
  my car insurance with GEICO.  

263
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,512
              Huh.              

264
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,547
     I should take a closer     
        look at GEICO...        

265
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,552
    GEICO can help with way     
    more than car insurance.    

266
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,554
  Boats, homes, motorcycles...  

267
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,856
    even umbrella coverage.     

268
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,757
     This guy's gonna wish      
    he brought his umbrella.    

269
00:14:19,793 --> 00:14:20,925
         Fire at will!          

270
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,393
   How'd you know the guy's     
         name is Will?          

271
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,361
             Yeah?              

272
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,629
  It's an expression, ya know?  
         Fire at will?          

273
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,396
    You never heard of that?    

274
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,297
      Oh, there goes Will!      

275
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,031
           Bye, Will!           

276
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,433
      That's not his name!      

277
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,968
  <i> Take a closer look at GEICO.</i> 

278
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,536
         <i> Great savings.</i>        
     <i> And a whole lot more.</i>     

279
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,208
DI just drank tons of water all 
 the time, it was never enough. 

280
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,112
  My dentist suggested Biotene, 
 my mouth felt more lubricated. 

281
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,948
     I use the Biotene rinse    
      and I use the spray.      

282
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,150
 Biotene did make a difference. 

283
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,657
I NEEDED SOMETHING MORE TO HELP 
CONTROL MY TYPE 2 DIABETES.     

284
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,894
MY A1C WASN'T WERE              
IT NEEDED TO BE.                

285
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,762
SO I LIKED WHEN                 
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME               

286
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,932
THAT I MAY REACH MY BLOOD       
SUGAR AND A1C GOALS             

287
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,834
BY ACTIVATING WHAT'S WITHIN ME  

288
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,603
  WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.   

289
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:07,071
   TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.    

290
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,440
  IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO  
  DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO DO,   

291
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,209
    RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.    

292
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,612
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,          
AND IT WORKS 24/7.              

293
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,514
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN  

294
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,050
AND I MAY EVEN LOSE             
A LITTLE WEIGHT.                

295
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,186
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY      
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

296
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,056
  TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN     
  ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES   

297
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,191
       WHEN USED WITH           
       DIET AND EXERCISE.       

298
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,294
   TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.    

299
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,930
  IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST    
  MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,   

300
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,865
       OR FOR PEOPLE WITH       
       TYPE 1 DIABETES          

301
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,301
   OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.    

302
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,870
   DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY        
   IF YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER    

303
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,638
       HAS HAD MEDULLARY        
       THYROID CANCER,          

304
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,608
IF YOU'VE HAD MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2,      

305
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:46,544
     OR IF YOU ARE              
     ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY.     

306
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,813
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL         
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY          

307
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,982
IF YOU HAVE A LUMP OR           
SWELLING IN YOUR NECK,          

308
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,517

RASH, OR TROUBLE BREATHING.

    SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY    
    INCLUDE PANCREATITIS,       

311
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,658
      WHICH CAN BE FATAL.       

312
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,328
    TAKING TRULICITY WITH A     
    SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN,    

313
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,064
      INCREASES YOUR RISK       
      FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.      

314
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,100
  COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE   
  NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,   

315
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,536
       DECREASED APPETITE       
       AND INDIGESTION.         

316
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,838
     SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN      
     LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,       

317
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,607
    WHICH MAY MAKE EXISTING     
    KIDNEY PROBLEMS WORSE.

JOURNEY TO ANOTHER WORLD HIDDEN

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND OUT
OF SIGHT FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS  

491
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,337
OF YEARS.                       
THE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT FOREST

492
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:17,007
DISCOVERED RECENTLY IN THE GULF 
OF MEXICO OFF THE COAST OF      

493
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:21,579
ALABAMA.                        
NBC'S KERRY SANDERS GOT A LOOK. 

494
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:28,385
>> Reporter: ALONG THE ALABAMA  
COAST, WE HEAD TO A SECRET SPOT.

495
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,225
WHAT LIES HERE, 60 FEET BELOW   
THE SURFACE, A REMARKABLE       

496
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,895
DISCOVERY.                      
AN ANCIENT FOREST TEAMING WITH  

497
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:42,132
SEA LIFE, BALD CYPRESS TREES    
THAT LOOKED LIKE THIS LONG      

498
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,636
CONCEALED AND PRESERVED UNDER A 
THICK LAYER OF SEDIMENT.        

499
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,306
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THE FOREST   
HERE WAS UNCOVERED BY MOTHER    

500
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,911
NATURE IN 2004, WHAT HURRICANE  
IVAN ROYALED THE SEABED.        

501
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,313
THAT'S ABOUT 65 MILES AN HOUR   
RIGHT THERE.                    

502
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,384
IT WASN'T UNTIL ALMOST A DECADE 
LATER THAT A FISHERMAN OVER THIS

503
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:04,555
SPOT LOOKED AT HIS SONAR AND    
NOTICED SOMETHING ODD.          

504
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:09,159
HE THEN CALLED SKUB BAA DIVER.  
COULD YOU FIGURE IT OUT.        

505
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,996
>> WE COULDN'T.                 
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.     

506
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,833
THAT'S WHEN WE THOUGHT WE NEEDED
TO GET SCIENTISTS OUT HERE.     

507
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,569
>> Reporter: THIS FILM MAKE ORE 
DOCUMENTED IT.

512
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,422
RESEARCHERS FROM LOUISIANA STATE
UNIVERSITY ESTIMATE THAT THE    

513
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,091
FOREST HERE WAS ABOUT A HALF    
SQUARE MILE.                    

514
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,595
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE     
WHERE WE SEE THE GULF OF MEXICO 

515
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:50,067
NOW, THERE WAS AN ISLAND, AND   
RUSHING AROUND IT, A FRESH WATER

516
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:55,372
RIVER.                          
SO THE MUCK FEELS LIKE

00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,141
PLAY-DOUGH.                     
THEY'RE BEGINNING TO DECOMPOSE. 

518

THESE ANCIENT RELICS MAY HOLD

FUTURE.                         

521
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,318
>> THESE TREES DIED VERY        
QUICKLY.                        

522
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:12,856
