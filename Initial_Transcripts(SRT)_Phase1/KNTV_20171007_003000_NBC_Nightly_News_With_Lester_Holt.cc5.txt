[000:09:48;521] NOT AFFECT THE VAST
[000:09:51;057] MAJORITY OF WOMEN, BUT
[000:09:53;059] THAT'S ONLY BASED ON
[000:09:55;061] GROUPS THAT SO FAR

[000:10:11;644] >> WHAT THIS RULE DOES
[000:10:12;411] IS PUT THAT COVERAGE
[000:10:13;179] IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE IT
[000:10:13;946] PUTS CONTROL IN THEIR
