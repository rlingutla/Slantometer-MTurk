LABELED WITH SOME DISORDER AND

500
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
KICKED OUT OF THE MILITARY, THEN

501
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000

WHAT'S DIFFICULT TO SURVIVE IS
HOW THEY WERE TREATED

509
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
AFTERWARDS.
THEY SEE THE MILITARY AS THEIR

510
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
CALLING, AS THEIR FAMILY.

511
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
FOR A LOT OF THESE WOMEN WHEN

512
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
THEY SEPARATE FROM ACTIVE DUTY

513
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
THEY DO EXPERIENCE POST

THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

518
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
WE HAVE GOT TO CLEAN THE SYSTEM

>> Reporter: DO YOU FEEL THERE

521
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
IS A SIMILARITY BETWEEN WHAT WE

522
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
ARE SEEING IN THE MILITARY AND

PEOPLE AROUND WHICH IS WHAT

530
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
HAPPENED IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.
IT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE
