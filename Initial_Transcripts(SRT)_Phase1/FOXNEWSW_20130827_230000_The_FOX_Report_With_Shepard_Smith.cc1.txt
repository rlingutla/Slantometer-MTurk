[000:02:31;06] EVENING.  
[000:02:31;21] JENNIFER, GOOD EVENING TO  
[000:02:32;16] YOU.  
[000:02:32;28] WHAT WOULD A U.S. MILITARY  
[000:02:34;27] STRIKE LOOK LIKES A IT  
[000:02:35;29] STANDS NOW?  
[000:02:37;00] >> BILL, A SENIOR U.S.  
[000:02:39;05] OFFICIAL TELLS FOX THAT ANY  
[000:02:40;07] STRIKE ON SYRIA IS LIKELY  
[000:02:41;18] TO LAST HOURS, NOT DAYS.  
[000:02:43;15] ACCORDING TO U.S. MILITARY  
[000:02:45;11] SOURCES, THERE ARE NO PLANS  
[000:02:46;21] IN THIS INITIAL MISSION SET  
[000:02:48;04] TO GO AFTER ASSAD'S  
[000:02:49;28] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  
[000:02:51;05] IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CARRY  
[000:02:51;29] OUT A SURGICAL STRIKE ON  
[000:02:54;20] CHEMICAL WEAPONS STORAGE  
[000:02:55;23] FACILITIES, ASSAD IS  
[000:02:56;25] ESTIMATED TO HAVE  
[000:02:58;20] 1,000 TONS OF THOSE  
[000:03:00;03] MATERIALS.  
[000:03:00;18] SUCH A STRIKE COULD UNLEASH  
[000:03:01;27] THOSE CHEMICALS AND LEAD TO  
[000:03:02;26] A LOT OF DEATH AND  
[000:03:04;11] DESTRUCTION, SOURCES SAY.  
[000:03:05;13] ANY PLANS TO SECURE ASSAD'S  
[000:03:07;14] CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD  
[000:03:08;27] REQUIRE SPECIAL OPERATIONS  
[000:03:09;29] AND BOOTS ON THE GROUND.  
[000:03:11;07] THAT IS NOT ON THE TABLE  
[000:03:12;12] RIGHT NOW.  
[000:03:16;26] THE U.S. IS PLANNING A  
[000:03:18;06] LIMITED STRIKE.  
[000:03:19;16] FOUR NAVY DESTROYERS IN  
[000:03:20;16] POSITION AND AT LEAST ONE  
[000:03:22;03] NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINE.  
[000:03:23;15] THE BRITISH COULD PROVIDE

[000:03:29;26] FOR THURSDAY BILL.

[000:03:35;15] BRUSSELS TOMORROW AND WE'RE  
[000:03:36;09] TOLD IT WOULD OCCUR MOST  
[000:03:38;07] LIKELY THIS WEEKEND.

[000:03:41;28] PARTS BY PHONE TODAY.  
[000:03:42;23] IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE

[000:03:46;16] WARSHIPS ARE STANDING BY  
[000:03:47;24] AWAITING ORDERS.  
[000:03:48;12] >> LET'S GET THE FACTS.  
[000:03:49;19] LET'S GET THE INTELLIGENCE.  
[000:03:51;08] AND THEN A DECISION WILL BE  
[000:03:52;22] MADE ON WHETHER ACTION  
[000:03:53;28] SHOULD BE TAKEN, IF ACTION  
[000:03:55;05] SHOULD BE TAKEN, WHAT  
[000:03:58;02] ACTION.  
[000:03:58;16] OR NO ACTION.  
[000:04:00;26] BUT IF YOU COME YOU ARE  
[000:04:01;27] READY TO GO LIKE THAT.  
[000:04:03;02] >> WE ARE READY TO GO LIKE  
[000:04:05;11] THAT.  
[000:04:05;24] >> AGAIN THE PLAN AT THIS  
[000:04:06;17] POINT IS TO DETER ASSAD AND  
[000:04:08;03] DEGRADE HIS ABILITIES.  
[000:04:09;18] MULTIPLE PENTAGON SOURCES  
[000:04:10;21] SUGGEST THE STRIKE WILL BE  
[000:04:12;15] LIMITED.  
[000:04:13;14] BILL?  
[000:04:13;27] >> Bill: THANK YOU

[000:04:17;21] PENTAGON.  
[000:04:18;06] SECRETARY HAGEL SAYS IF THE  
[000:04:19;00] U.S. MILITARY DOES TAKE  
[000:04:20;20] ACTION, WE WILL NOT BE  
[000:04:21;16] GOING IT ALONE.  
[000:04:22;18] OUR TEAM FOX COVERAGE  
[000:04:23;24] CONTINUES NOW.  
[000:04:29;17] CHIEF CORRESPONDENT  
[000:04:30;11] JONATHAN HUNT JOINS US.  
[000:04:31;12] IT LOOKS LIKE WE SEE A  
[000:04:33;13] COALITION FORMING.  
[000:04:34;04] >> FORMING AND IN PLACE.  
[000:04:35;18] IMPORTANT PART OF THAT  
[000:04:36;10] COALITION EVEN IF  
[000:04:37;23] UNOFFICIALLY MAY WELL BE  
[000:04:38;19] THE ARAB LEAGUE.  
[000:04:39;17] THE ARAB LEAGUE MET TODAY  
[000:04:40;22] AND ISSUED A STATEMENT  
[000:04:42;20] BACKING U.S. CONCLUSIONS  
[000:04:43;16] OVER THE USE OF CHEMICAL  
[000:04:44;28] WEAPONS IN SYRIA LAST WEEK  
[000:04:47;05] ON THE WESTERN FRONT BOTH  
[000:04:49;09] THE FRENCH AND BRITISH  
[000:04:50;12] PRIME MINISTERS TALKING  
[000:04:52;01] VERY MUCH ABOUT THE NEED  
[000:04:53;21] FOR MILITARY ACTION.  
[000:04:55;25] BRITISH PRIME MINISTER  
[000:04:56;16] DAVID CAMMERON SAYS IT IS  
[000:04:58;04] LIKELY TO HAPPEN.  
[000:04:59;01] BUT THERE MUST BE A CLEAR  
[000:05:01;08] GOAL.  
[000:05:01;21] LISTEN.  
[000:05:02;16] >> IT WOULD HAVE TO BE  
[000:05:05;02] SPECIFICALLY TO DETER AND  
[000:05:06;27] DEGRADE THE FUTURE USE OF  
[000:05:09;04] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  
[000:05:09;27] LET ME STRESS TO PEOPLE.  
[000:05:11;02] THIS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING  
[000:05:12;20] INVOLVED IN A MIDDLE  
[000:05:14;11] EASTERN WAR OR CHANGING OUR  
[000:05:17;01] STAFFS IN SYRIA OR GOING  
[000:05:18;05] FURTHER INTO THAT CONFLICT.  
[000:05:19;16] IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH  
[000:05:20;14] THAT IT'S ABOUT CHEMICAL  
[000:05:22;11] WEAPONS, THEIR USE IS  
[000:05:23;16] WRONG.  
[000:05:23;29] AND THE WORLD SHUNNED  
[000:05:25;20] DISTANT IDOLLY BY.  
[000:05:28;01] >> PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO  
[000:05:28;26] PRIME MINISTER DAVID  
[000:05:30;07] CAMMERON TODAY.  
[000:05:31;10] ALSO WORTH NOTING BILL  
[000:05:32;20] THAT THE BRITISH PRIME  
[000:05:34;02] MINISTER HAS RECALLED  
[000:05:35;18] PARLIAMENT FROM ITS SUMMER  
[000:05:37;02] RECESS.  
[000:05:37;16] THAT MEETING DUE TO TAKE  
[000:05:38;21] PLACE THURSDAY.  
[000:05:39;16] IF YOU ARE READING THE TEA  
[000:05:41;01] LEAVES ON TIMING, THAT  
[000:05:42;03] COULD ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT,  
[000:05:43;13] BILL.  
[000:05:43;26] >> BUT SYRIA REMAINS  
[000:05:45;24] DEFIANT.  
[000:05:46;08] >> YEAH, THE FOREIGN  
[000:05:47;08] MINISTER SPEAKING OUT TODAY  
[000:05:48;12] SAYING THAT ABSOLUTELY  
[000:05:50;08] WITHOUT QUESTION SYRIA WILL  
[000:05:52;09] DEFEND ITSELF IF ATTACKED.  
[000:05:54;01] LISTEN.  
[000:05:56;10] >> IF ANY AGGRESSION WERE  
[000:05:58;09] TO TAKE PLACE, WE HAVE TWO  
[000:06:01;11] OPTIONS.  
[000:06:01;25] TO SURRENDER OR TO DEFEND  
[000:06:03;19] OURSELVES USING THE OPTIONS  
[000:06:05;20] AVAILABLE.  
[000:06:06;05] USING ALL MEANS AVAILABLE.  
[000:06:07;26] >> IN THE MEANTIME, U.N.  
[000:06:10;22] WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE  
[000:06:11;19] STILL ON THE GROUND IN  
[000:06:13;13] DAMASCUS, TRYING TO  
[000:06:14;03] INVESTIGATE THAT ALLEGED  
[000:06:14;27] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.  
[000:06:16;19] DESPITE DIFFICULTIES THAT  
[000:06:17;12] THEY HAVE FACED, INCLUDING  
[000:06:18;20] A SNIPER ATTACK ON THEIR  
[000:06:21;16] CONVOY.  
[000:06:22;00] YOU CAN SEE THE BULLET  
[000:06:22;21] HOLES IN ONE OF THEIR  
[000:06:23;20] VEHICLES THERE.  
[000:06:25;01] MEANTIME, THE SPOKESMAN FOR  
[000:06:26;24] THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL  
[000:06:28;24] SAYS DIPLOMACY IS STILL BY  
[000:06:31;02] FAR THE PREFERRED MEANS OF  
[000:06:32;20] ENDING THIS CRISIS.  
[000:06:33;17] LISTEN.  
[000:06:34;28] >> OUR FOCUS IS AWAY FROM  
[000:06:37;08] ANY MILITARY SOLUTION AND  
[000:06:38;09] TOWARDS A DIPLOMATIC  
[000:06:39;09] SOLUTION AND WE CONTINUE TO  
[000:06:42;15] WORK ON AT ALL AVENUES TO  
[000:06:44;01] TRY TO GET A DIPLOMATIC  
[000:06:45;22] SOLUTION GOING.  
[000:06:48;00] WE REMAIN COMBINED THAT  
[000:06:48;27] THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN FAR  
[000:06:50;11] TOO MUCH BLOOD SHED IN  
[000:06:52;05] SYRIA.  
[000:06:52;18] >> BUT, WITH THE RUSSIANS  
[000:06:53;20] BOUND TO BLOCK ANY UNITED  
[000:06:56;19] NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL  
[000:06:58;01] RESOLUTION, IT APPEARS  
[000:06:59;01] BILL, THAT THE U.S. HAS  
[000:06:59;29] ALREADY MADE THE DECISION  
[000:07:01;10] TO GO AHEAD WITH ANY  
[000:07:03;10] MILITARY OPTION UNDER THE  
[000:07:05;09] AUSPICES OF NATO, RATHER  
[000:07:06;18] THAN THE U.N., BILL.  
[000:07:08;13] >> Bill: WE WILL LIKELY  
[000:07:09;07] FIND OUT VERY SOON.  
[000:07:10;10] THANK YOU JONATHAN HUNT  
[000:07:11;09] FROM OUR NEW YORK NEWSROOM

[000:07:13;20] CONSULTING WITH CONGRESS  
[000:07:14;12] ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO  
[000:07:15;25] DAMASCUS.  
[000:07:16;13] BUT, SOME LAWMAKERS FROM  
[000:07:17;27] BOTH PARTIES CLAIM THAT IS  
[000:07:19;00] NOT ENOUGH.  
[000:07:19;28] THEY SAY CONGRESS HAS TO  
[000:07:21;27] APPROVE ANY MILITARY  
[000:07:23;16] ACTION.  
[000:07:24;00] WE'LL GO LIVE TO THE WHITE

[000:08:03;03] PLEASE DON'T SHOOT MY BABY.  
[000:08:04;15] HE SHOT A WARNING SHOT TO  
[000:08:07;04] THE GROUND.

[000:09:28;15] STATEMENTS SHE MADE TO THE  
[000:09:29;27] POLICE IN THE AFTERMATH.

[000:09:32;09] THE CHILD'S FATHER, LUIS  
[000:09:35;17] SANTIAGO MAY HAVE HAD SOME  
[000:09:37;05] INVOLVEMENT IN THE CHILD'S  
[000:09:38;08] DEATH.  
[000:09:38;21] AT ONE POINT PUBLIC  
[000:09:40;02] DEFENDER KEVIN GOFF BROUGHT  
[000:09:41;04] UP WEST'S HISTORY OF MENTAL  
[000:09:43;01] ILLNESS.  
[000:09:44;08] >> ONE THE MENTAL ILLNESSES  
[000:09:46;05] FROM WHICH YOU SUFFER IS  
[000:09:48;08] WHAT'S KNOWN AS BIPOLAR  
[000:09:49;19] DISORDER OR MANIC

[000:10:19;06] $5,000 INSURANCE POLICY IN

[000:10:20;18] MOMENTS AGO IN THE  
[000:10:21;19] COURTROOM GUFF SUGGESTED  
[000:10:22;21] THAT WEST WAS SUCH A BAD  
[000:10:24;03] MOTHER THAT THE MURDER OF  
[000:10:25;04] HER CHILD MAY HAVE BEEN  
[000:10:28;17] QUOTE MERCIFUL.  
[000:10:29;11] THE DEFENSE IS WALKING A  
[000:10:30;15] VERY FINE LINE HERE BETWEEN  
[000:10:32;02] TOUGH CROSS-EXAMINATION OF  
[000:10:33;02] A MOTHER WHO HAD LOST HER

[000:15:12;13] IS TREATING HIS SENTENCING  
[000:15:13;15] JUST LIKE HIS TRIAL.

[000:15:17;00] HIS CASE WITH THE SAME  
[000:15:19;23] THREE WORDS THE DEFENSE

[000:15:29;23] FOR THE CRIME KILLING FROM

[000:15:33;14] JURORS HEARD FROM VICTIMS'  
[000:15:35;04] FAMILY MEMBERS TODAY.  
[000:15:36;19] ONE WOMAN WHO LOST HER  
[000:15:37;18] HUSBAND SAID SHE CANNOT  
[000:15:38;22] BRING HERSELF TO MOVE ANY  
[000:15:39;23] OF HIS BELONGINGS EVENING  
[000:15:41;12] TO THIS DAY.

[000:15:44;15] GARAGE.  
[000:15:44;29] HIS CLOTHES STILL HANGING  
[000:15:45;22] IN THE CLOSET.  
[000:15:46;19] ANOTHER WIDOW DESCRIBED HER  
[000:15:47;20] RELIEF WHEN AN ARMY  
[000:15:49;01] OFFICIAL TOLD HER THAT ALL  
[000:15:50;12] THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES HAD  
[000:15:52;00] ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED.  
[000:15:53;11] SHE TESTIFIED TODAY IN A  
[000:15:55;04] STRANGE SENSE OF IRONY THAT  
[000:15:56;18] SHE THOUGHT HER HUSBAND WAS  
[000:15:57;28] STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR AND  
[000:15:59;06] JOKED TO HERSELF I'M GOING  
[000:16:00;17] TO KILL HIM BUT THAT ARMY  
[000:16:03;22] OFFICIAL TURNED OUT TO BE  
[000:16:05;00] WRONG, HER HUSBAND WAS  
[000:16:06;00] ALREADY DEAD.  
[000:16:07;11] CASEY STEGALL HAS THE NEWS  
[000:16:08;17] LIVE AT FORT HOOD TONIGHT

[000:16:11;29] CASEY?  
[000:16:12;12] >> YEAH, BILL.  
[000:16:12;29] >> AMONG THOSE WE HEARD  
[000:16:14;05] FROM TODAY THREE WIDOWS  
[000:16:15;21] AND THREE MOTHERS WHO TRIED  
[000:16:17;20] EXPLAINING WHAT LIFE HAS  
[000:16:18;18] BEEN LIKE SINCE THEIR  
[000:16:19;26] HUSBANDS OR THEIR CHILDREN  
[000:16:21;14] WERE KILLED.  
[000:16:22;14] EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL, MANY  
[000:16:23;07] OF THEM REACHING FOR  
[000:16:24;09] TISSUES WHILE ON THE STAND.  
[000:16:26;08] IT'S LIKE TINA, HER SON  
[000:16:28;26] PRIVATE FIRST CLASS AARON  
[000:16:30;18] WAS JUST 19 YEARS OLD WHEN  
[000:16:32;12] HASAN GUNNED HIM DOWN.  
[000:16:33;29] SHE TEARFULLY RECALLED THE  
[000:16:35;08] MOMENT OFFICERS ARRIVED AT  
[000:16:36;02] HER HOME TO MAKE THE  
[000:16:37;11] NOTIFICATION.  
[000:16:37;28] SHE SAID FROM THE STAND AND  
[000:16:38;22] I'M QUOTING HERE:  YOU JUST  
[000:16:40;23] FREEZE.  
[000:16:41;07] YOU CAN'T OPEN THAT DOOR.  
[000:16:43;03] YOU DON'T WANT THE NEWS  
[000:16:44;02] THAT YOU HAVE LOST YOUR  
[000:16:45;16] SON.  
[000:16:45;28] IT IS THE WORST NEWS YOU  
[000:16:47;14] COULD EVER HEAR.  
[000:16:48;17] NOW, FIRST THING TOMORROW  
[000:16:49;27] MORNING, THE PANEL WILL  
[000:16:51;05] BEGIN SENTENCING  
[000:16:52;19] INSTRUCTIONS.  
[000:16:53;06] THEN THE PROSECUTION WILL  
[000:16:54;06] GIVE CLOSING ARGUMENTS, AND  
[000:16:56;04] FINALLY MAJOR HASAN WILL  
[000:16:57;14] HAVE ONE MORE CHANCE TO  
[000:17:00;02] SPEAK.  
[000:17:00;15] THE PROSECUTION HAS A  
[000:17:01;06] CHANCE TO GIVE A REBUTTAL  
[000:17:02;18] AND THEN THE PANEL GETS  
[000:17:04;01] THIS CASE ONCE AGAIN,  
[000:17:06;13] DELIBERATIONS BEGIN.  
[000:17:07;13] ALL 13 OF THOSE SENIOR ARMY  
[000:17:10;01] OFFICERS MUST BE UNANIMOUS  
[000:17:11;05] IF THEY WANT' TO GIVE THE  
[000:17:13;17] 42-YEAR-OLD ARMY  
[000:17:14;08] PSYCHIATRIST THE DEATH  
[000:17:14;29] PENALTY, BILL.  
[000:17:16;05] >> Bill: WHAT A ROAD THIS  
[000:17:16;28] HAS BEEN FOR ALL OF THEM.  
[000:17:18;06] CASEY, THANK YOU.  
[000:17:18;29] CASEY STEGALL THERE.  
[000:17:19;24] EVEN IF MAKE HASAN GETS THE  
[000:17:21;12] DEATH PENALTY, IT WILL BE  
[000:17:22;08] FAR FROM A DONE DEAL IT  
[000:17:23;24] WOULD LIKELY MEAN YEARS OF  
[000:17:26;04] APPEALS.  
[000:17:26;18] IN THE PAST 30 YEARS  
[000:17:27;20] MILITARY APPEALS COURTS  
[000:17:29;17] HAVE OVERTURNED SOME TWO  
[000:17:30;15] THIRDS OF ALL DEATH  
[000:17:31;24] SENTENCES.  
[000:17:32;15] AND THE MILITARY HAS NOT  
[000:17:34;08] EXECUTED ANYONE IN MORE  
[000:17:35;20] THAN 50 YEARS.  
[000:17:38;02] THREE MILLION DOLLARS' BAIL

[000:17:51;01] BEHIND BARS ON $2 MILLION  
[000:17:53;03] BAIL.  
[000:17:53;16] PROSECUTORS WILL TRY BOTH  
[000:17:54;12] TEENS AS ADULTS FOR FIRST  
[000:17:55;24] DEGREE MURDER AND ROBBERY.  
[000:17:57;08] THEY SAY THE TEENS RANDOMLY

[000:29:37;13] FRESH.  LIKE I COULD DEFINITELY  WRAP
[000:29:38;14] MYSELF IN IT.    ODORS ARE NO MATCH
[000:29:41;23] FOR THE FEBREZE CAR VENT CLIP.   
[000:29:44;13] ANOTHER WAY FEBREZE    HELPS YOU BREATHE
[000:29:45;06] HAPPY.
[000:29:55;23] POLICE ARRESTED THE BROTHER  
[000:29:57;22] OF A MURDER VICTIM AFTER HE  
[000:29:58;16] TRIED TO BULL RUSSIA  
[000:29:59;06] SUSPECTED KILLER INSIDE OF  
[000:29:59;29] A COURTROOM.  
[000:30:00;17] WATCH HERE.  
[000:30:03;04] [SHOUTING]  
[000:30:05;16] >> Bill: THAT GUY RAN  
[000:30:06;07] TOWARD THE PRISONER BOXES  
[000:30:08;02] AS PROSECUTORS READ OUT THE  
[000:30:09;07] DETAILS OF THE APPARENT  
[000:30:11;03] HOMICIDE NEAR BOSTON.  
[000:30:11;24] THE SUSPECT ON SATURDAY  
[000:30:12;23] STABBED THE VICTIM ALMOST  
[000:30:14;12] 70 TIMES AT A TRAILER PARK.  
[000:30:16;13] AUTHORITIES FOUND THE  
[000:30:17;13] SUSPECT' AT A NEARBY TRAIN  
[000:30:19;04] STATION WITH BLOODY CLOTHES  
[000:30:20;07] AND A CUT ON HIS HAND.  
[000:30:21;20] SOON AFTER THEY DISCOVERED  
[000:30:23;09] THE VICTIM INSIDE OF A  
[000:30:24;07] BLOOD SPATTERED MOBILE  
[000:30:26;06] HOME.  
[000:30:26;19] HIS BROTHER FACES CHARGES  
[000:30:27;13] OF DISRUPTING COURT  
[000:30:29;00] PROCEEDINGS AND RESISTING  
[000:30:30;08] ARREST.  
[000:30:34;09] I'M BILL HEMMER IN TONIGHT  
[000:30:35;20] FOR SHEPARD SMITH.  
[000:30:36;20] THIS IS "THE FOX REPORT."  
[000:30:38;26] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S  
[000:30:40;29] PREPOSTEROUS TO SUGGEST  
[000:30:41;21] THAT SYRIA WAS NOT BEHIND  
[000:30:42;25] LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL  
[000:30:44;01] WEAPONS ATTACK.  
[000:30:45;03] THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED  
[000:30:46;06] HUNDREDS THERE.  
[000:30:47;00] NOW THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS  
[000:30:48;01] THERE IS NO DOUBT THE U.S.  
[000:30:49;22] WILL RESPOND.  
[000:30:50;09] THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN  
[000:30:52;20] AND HOW THE U.S. HAS  
[000:30:57;16] FOUR WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST  
[000:30:58;19] OF MILITARY.  
[000:30:59;29] THE MILITARY IS READY TO  
[000:31:01;15] STRIKE WHENEVER PRESIDENT  
[000:31:02;08] OBAMA GIVES THAT ORDER.  
[000:31:03;13] BUT DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK  
[000:31:04;10] HAGEL STRESSING THE U.S.  
[000:31:05;19] WILL COORDINATE ANY ACTION  
[000:31:06;25] WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL  
[000:31:08;26] PARTNERS.  
[000:31:09;11] ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE  
[000:31:10;04] HOUSE TONIGHT.  
[000:31:10;26] ED, GOOD EVENING TO YOU.  
[000:31:13;20] WOULD THE THE  
[000:31:14;09] ADMINISTRATION GET  
[000:31:15;19] CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY OR  
[000:31:16;12] IS THIS A DECISION THE  
[000:31:17;21] PRESIDENT WILL MAKE ON HIS  
[000:31:19;24] OWN.  
[000:31:20;06] >> GOOD EVENING, BILL.  
[000:31:20;27] IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT  
[000:31:23;04] IS GOING TO OPERATE  
[000:31:24;18] UNILATERALLY WITHOUT  
[000:31:25;23] CONGRESS.  
[000:31:26;09] INTERESTING BECAUSE VICE  
[000:31:27;01] PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TODAY  
[000:31:28;06] ADDED HIS NAME TO THE  
[000:31:29;01] COURSE OF TOP OFFICIALS  
[000:31:30;00] HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:31:30;22] SAYING THAT ASSAD AND SYRIA  
[000:31:32;10] NEEDS TO BE HELD  
[000:31:33;24] ACCOUNTABLE.  
[000:31:34;10] THAT HE DID, IN FACT, USE  
[000:31:35;12] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  
[000:31:36;09] BUT SOME DEMOCRATS ON  
[000:31:37;17] CAPITOL HILL LIKE  
[000:31:39;12] CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE,  
[000:31:40;06] THE ONLY MEMBER OF CONGRESS  
[000:31:41;00] TO VOTE AGAINST THE WAR IN  
[000:31:42;15] AFGHANISTAN DEMANDING A  
[000:31:43;25] DEBATE AND VOTE IN  
[000:31:45;13] CONGRESS.  
[000:31:45;28] OFFICIALS HERE AT THE WHITE  
[000:31:46;22] HOUSE TELLING ME THAT IS  
[000:31:47;27] UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN BEFORE  
[000:31:48;23] THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS  
[000:31:49;25] DECISION ON WHETHER TO MOVE  
[000:31:50;29] FORWARD ON U.S. MILITARY  
[000:31:52;26] ACTION.  
[000:31:53;10] EVEN THOUGH IN THE 2008  
[000:31:54;12] CAMPAIGN, HE SLAMMED THE  
[000:31:56;00] BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR  
[000:31:57;11] ACTING UNILATERALLY, TAKE A  
[000:31:59;11] LISTEN TO HOW I PRESSED JAY  
[000:32:00;28] CARNEY ABOUT THIS AND  
[000:32:01;23] LISTEN TO THE VICE  
[000:32:02;12] PRESIDENT AS WELL.  
[000:32:04;18] >> 2007, CANDIDATE OBAMA  
[000:32:06;04] WAS AN ACTUAL OR IMMINENT  
[000:32:07;17] THREAT TO THE NATION.  
[000:32:08;16] DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EXISTS  
[000:32:09;14] RIGHT NOW AN ACTUAL OR  
[000:32:10;28] IMMINENT THREAT TO THE  
[000:32:11;19] UNITED STATES?  
[000:32:12;06] >> I BELIEVE THAT  
[000:32:14;20] ABSOLUTELY ALLOWING THE USE  
[000:32:16;01] OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A  
[000:32:19;09] SIGNIFICANT STALE TO TAKE  
[000:32:21;20] PLACE WITHOUT A RESPONSE  
[000:32:29;10] WOULD PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT  
[000:32:31;10] THREAT TO UNITED STATES  
[000:32:33;08] NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST.  
[000:32:34;05] >> NATIONAL SECURITY IS  
[000:32:35;05] STRENGTHENED WHEN WE HOLD  
[000:32:36;20] ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO  
[000:32:38;05] VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL  
[000:32:38;26] NORMS.  
[000:32:40;00] >> NOW THE WOWS JUST  
[000:32:41;14] REVEALED IN THE LAST FEW  
[000:32:42;27] MOMENTS AND THE PRESIDENT  
[000:32:43;23] JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH  
[000:32:45;05] THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER  
[000:32:46;00] DAVID CAMMERON.  
[000:32:46;26] WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT  
[000:32:47;18] THAT SECOND TIMED THEY HAVE  
[000:32:48;26] SPOKEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW  
[000:32:50;09] DAYS.  
[000:32:50;22] CONSULTING WITH ALLIES LIKE  
[000:32:51;16] THAT SUGGEST WE ARE EDGING  
[000:32:52;21] CLOSER TO U.S. MILITARY  
[000:32:54;20] ACTION.  
[000:32:55;23] BILL?  
[000:32:56;06] >> Bill: WE ARE HEARING  
[000:32:56;28] FROM MANY PRODUCTION AT  
[000:32:58;07] LEAST SOME OF THEM ANY WAY  
[000:32:59;27] SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD NOT  
[000:33:00;25] BE SOME SORT OF SYMBOLIC  
[000:33:02;12] HIT OR ATTACK, ED?  
[000:33:03;15] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:33:04;10] REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN  
[000:33:05;07] MCCAIN SAYING TONIGHT LOOK,  
[000:33:06;15] IF THERE IS GOING TO BE  
[000:33:07;17] MILITARY ACTION, FINE.  
[000:33:08;12] BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO  
[000:33:09;18] EXPLAIN THE MISSION TO THE  
[000:33:10;18] AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MCCAIN  
[000:33:11;27] SAYING TONIGHT HE CAN'T  
[000:33:12;29] JUST BE SOME SYMBOLIC MOVE  
[000:33:15;10] TO BACK UP THE PRESIDENT'S  
[000:33:16;29] RHETORIC FROM LAST SUMMER  
[000:33:17;24] ABOUT A RED LINE ON  
[000:33:19;07] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  
[000:33:20;08] MCCAIN SAYING IT'S GOT TO  
[000:33:21;12] BE A SERIOUS MILITARY  
[000:33:22;25] ACTION THAT ACTUALLY  
[000:33:24;13] DEGRADES ASSAD'S FORCES.  
[000:33:25;15] TAKE LAFN.  
[000:33:26;18] >> IF IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE  
[000:33:28;23] LAUNCH SOME CREWS MISSILES  
[000:33:29;23] AND DO THAT FOR THREE DAYS  
[000:33:31;28] AND NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT  
[000:33:33;26] EFFECT ON THE MOMENTUM ON  
[000:33:35;08] THE BATTLEFIELD IT WILL  
[000:33:38;15] HAVE AN UNHELPFUL EFFECT.  
[000:33:40;17] IF WE DO IT RIGHT.  
[000:33:41;21] AND WE GET THE MOMENTUM  
[000:33:44;15] BACK ON SHIFTED TO OUR  
[000:33:47;02] FREEDOM FIGHTERS --  
[000:33:48;11] >> NOW, THE NEXT STEP IN  
[000:33:49;10] THE CASE FOR MILITARY  
[000:33:51;16] ACTION WE'RE EXPECTING THE  
[000:33:52;17] WHITE HOUSE AS EARLY AS  
[000:33:53;21] TOMORROW TO DECLASSIFY SOME  
[000:33:54;28] INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY SAY  
[000:33:55;25] WILL SHOW THAT ASSAD DID  
[000:33:57;15] USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  
[000:33:58;09] THAT WILL MOVE THEM ONE  
[000:33:59;20] STEP CLOSER TO ACTUAL  
[000:34:00;13] MILITARY ACTION,  (A  8GBm&n;<@&E}lK
[000:34:02;12] Z5R$  (PR&L.  
[000:34:03;00] >> Bill: A LOT MORE COMING  
[000:34:03;23] UP CLEARLY ON THIS  
[000:34:04;23] TOMORROW.  
[000:34:05;08] ED HENRY THANKS FROM THE  
[000:34:06;00] WHITE HOUSE ON THE FRONT  
[000:34:06;25] LAWN TONIGHT.  
[000:34:07;16] WILDFIRE ALERT NOW.  
[000:34:09;10] NEARLY 4,000 FIREFIGHTERS  
[000:34:10;03] FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE  
[000:34:10;27] FIGHTING A MASSIVE BLAZE IN  
[000:34:13;01] CALIFORNIA.  
[000:34:13;17] SO FAR THE RIM FIRE HAS  
[000:34:15;01] SPREAD TO COVER AN AREA OF  
[000:34:18;08] SOME 200 AND 80 SQUARE  
[000:34:20;03] MILES.  
[000:34:20;16] IT'S THE STATE'S SEVENTH  
[000:34:21;26] LARGEST FIRE ON RECORD.  
[000:34:23;01] AND IT CONTINUES TO  
[000:34:24;10] THREATEN MORE OF THE  
[000:34:26;07] YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK.  
[000:34:27;02] AS OF THE LAST COUNT, THE  
[000:34:28;09] WILDFIRE WAS ABOUT 20%  
[000:34:30;05] CONTAINED.  
[000:34:30;20] THAT WAS IT.  
[000:34:31;06] THIS THING HAS BEEN BURNING  
[000:34:32;02] FOR DAYS.  
[000:34:32;22] AS WE REPORTED YESTERDAY,  
[000:34:34;07] IT'S NOT ONLY THREATENING  
[000:34:35;06] POWER AND GAS LINES, BUT  
[000:34:36;22] THE WATER SUPPLY FOR  
[000:34:39;02] MILLIONS IN THE NEAR SAN  
[000:34:40;13] FRANCISCO BAY AREA.  
[000:34:41;26] CLAUDIA COWAN IS LIVE NEAR  
[000:34:42;19] THE EDGE OF THAT FIRE FOR  
[000:34:44;03] US THIS EVENING.  
[000:34:48;12] CLAUDIA?  
[000:34:48;26] >> BILL, WE ARE UNDER AN  
[000:34:51;26] EVACUATION ADVISORY FOR A  
[000:34:52;24] SIXTH STRAIGHT DAY.  
[000:34:53;19] FIRE CREWS ARE MAKING  
[000:34:55;03] PROGRESS BUT SAY STRONG  
[000:34:56;14] WIND GUSTS ESPECIALLY IN  
[000:34:58;00] THOSE CANYONS ARE MAKING IT  
[000:34:59;07] VERY TOUGH GOING.  
[000:35:00;20] OUR CAMERAS WERE ON A MEDIA  
[000:35:02;11] TOUR THIS AFTERNOON AND  
[000:35:03;06] HAPPENED TO SEE THIS GROVE  
[000:35:04;08] OF PONDEROSA PINES EXPLODE  
[000:35:06;02] INTO FLAMES.  
[000:35:06;26] HOT SPOTS LIKE THIS  
[000:35:07;28] CONTINUE TO HAMPER  
[000:35:09;13] CONTAINMENT EFFORTS AND  
[000:35:11;02] STRUCTURE PROTECTION.  
[000:35:12;02] 31 HOMES AND 80  
[000:35:13;19] OUTBUILDINGS LOST SO FAR.  
[000:35:15;14] BUT, IRONICALLY, BECAUSE OF  
[000:35:16;26] THIS FIRE'S ERRATIC  
[000:35:18;13] MOVEMENT, THIS MAY BE THE  
[000:35:19;24] BEST TIME TO VISIT  
[000:35:21;11] YOSEMITE.  
[000:35:23;03] >> YOU GO INTO THE PARK AND  
[000:35:25;14] YOSEMITE VALLEY AND IT'S  
[000:35:26;06] HARD TO TELL THAT THERE IS  
[000:35:27;12] A FIRE JUST 20 MILES AWAY  
[000:35:29;04] BECAUSE THE SMOKE IS  
[000:35:29;29] FLOWING AWAY FROM THE  
[000:35:31;11] VALLEY AND FRASIER POINT.  
[000:35:32;26] THE VIEWS ARE ALL STILL AS  
[000:35:34;11] BEAUTIFUL AS THEY ALWAYS  
[000:35:35;07] ARE.  
[000:35:37;05] >> UNFORTUNATELY, A LOT OF  
[000:35:38;04] THAT SMOKE IS BLOWING RIGHT  
[000:35:39;28] INTO ARENA, NEVADA WHERE  
[000:35:41;13] THE AIR QUALITY IS NOW  
[000:35:42;12] LISTED AS UNHEALTHY FOR  
[000:35:44;19] EVERYONE.  
[000:35:45;04] FIRE CREWS HERE SAY THEY  
[000:35:46;15] HOPE COOLER TEMPERATURES  
[000:35:48;17] AND HIGHER HUMIDITY OVER  
[000:35:50;12] THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAY ALSO  
[000:35:51;12] HELP THEM GET THE UPPER  
[000:35:53;06] HAND.  
[000:35:53;19] BILL, THEY SAY IT COULD BE  
[000:35:54;24] MONTHS, WELL INTO WINTER  
[000:35:56;02] BEFORE THIS MASSIVE  
[000:35:57;12] WILDFIRE IS COMPLETELY OUT.  
[000:35:58;12] >> WOW THAT'S AMAZING.  
[000:36:00;03] STILL DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE  
[000:36:02;07] EITHER.  
[000:36:02;21] CLAUDIA COWAN NORTHERN  
[000:36:03;12] CALIFORNIA FOR US TONIGHT.  
[000:36:04;12] THERE IS GOOD NEWS IF YOU  
[000:36:05;07] ARE LOOKING TO SELL YOUR  
[000:36:06;06] HOME NOW.  
[000:36:06;21] A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT  
[000:36:07;17] HOME PRICES ACROSS THE  
[000:36:09;22] COUNTRY ROSE AN AVERAGE OF  
[000:36:11;00] 12% IN JUNE COMPARED TO  
[000:36:12;00] JUNE OF LAST YEAR.  
[000:36:13;05] THAT ACCORDING TO THE S&P  
[000:36:14;20] CASE SCHILLER HOME PRICE  
[000:36:16;15] INDEX.  
[000:36:16;28] IT FOUND THAT MORE  
[000:36:17;20] AMERICANS WERE ENCOURAGED  
[000:36:18;22] TO BUY HOMES.  
[000:36:19;24] THANKS MOSTLY TO STEADY JOB  
[000:36:22;12] GAINS AND LOW MORTGAGE  
[000:36:24;01] RATES.  
[000:36:24;14] BUT ANALYSTS SAY HIGHER  
[000:36:25;24] MORTGAGE RATES COULD SOON  
[000:36:27;00] WEIGH ON THE HOUSING  
[000:36:28;07] RECOVERY.  
[000:36:28;22] FROM THE FOX BUSINESS  
[000:36:29;18] NETWORK RICH EDISON JOINS  
[000:36:30;26] US LIVE TONIGHT WITH THE  
[000:36:31;18] NEWS ON THAT TODAY IN  
[000:36:33;19] WASHINGTON.  
[000:36:34;05] RICH, GOOD EVENING.  
[000:36:34;25] >> GOOD EVENING, BILL.  
[000:36:35;23] THE HOUSING MARKET  
[000:36:36;15] CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.  
[000:36:37;24] THOUGH AT A SLOWER PACE.  
[000:36:39;07] THERE ARE 20 CITIES IN THIS  
[000:36:41;10] SURVEY.  
[000:36:41;24] HOME PRICES IN 13 OF THEM  
[000:36:43;13] ROSE FASTER IN MAY THAN  
[000:36:44;21] THEY DID IN JUNE.  
[000:36:46;05] ONE ANALYST SAYS THE  
[000:36:48;25] HOUSING MARKET EARLIER THIS  
[000:36:49;29] YEAR WAS JUST GETTING TOO  
[000:36:51;06] HOT.  
[000:36:51;18] >> IT WAS ACCELERATING TOO  
[000:36:53;20] QUICKLY AND NOW IT'S  
[000:36:54;24] ACCELERATING LESS QUICKLY.  
[000:36:55;27] I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT  
[000:36:57;07] WAY TO LOOK AT THE DATA  
[000:36:58;09] WHEN YOU BOIL IT ALL DOWN.  
[000:36:59;12] >> THIS REPORT SAYS OVER  
[000:37:00;12] THE PAST YEAR, THE LARGEST  
[000:37:01;22] GAINS IN HOME PRICES ARE IN  
[000:37:03;13] CITIES THE HOUSING  
[000:37:04;17] RECESSION HIT HARDEST.  
[000:37:05;21] HOME VALUES IN LAS VEGAS  
[000:37:07;12] IN SAN FRANCISCO ARE UP  
[000:37:08;18] NEARLY A QUARTER.  
[000:37:09;21] PRICES IN LOS ANGELES,  
[000:37:11;05] PHOENIX, AND SAN DIEGO HAVE  
[000:37:12;10] INCREASED NEARLY 20% OVER  
[000:37:13;23] THE PAST YEAR.  
[000:37:14;21] THOUGH THE IMPROVING  
[000:37:15;25] HOUSING MARKET HAS  
[000:37:16;24] SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES,  
[000:37:18;04] MORTGAGE RATES HAVE SPIKED.  
[000:37:19;15] SIX MONTHS AGO A HOME BUYER
