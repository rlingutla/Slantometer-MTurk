[000:01:29;04] FRIDAY NIGHT THE COLLAPSE  
[000:01:30;04] OF A MAJOR INTERSTATE  
[000:01:31;24] BRIDGE.  
[000:01:32;08] AND DRIVERS WHO WERE  
[000:01:33;01] CROSSING A RIVER SUDDENLY  
[000:01:34;12] FOUND THEMSELVES IN THAT  
[000:01:35;26] RIVER.  
[000:01:36;10] IT HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON  
[000:01:37;23] STATE A PORTION OF I-5  
[000:01:39;16] PLUNGED INTO THE WATER LAST

[000:01:42;01] SAY A BIG RIG WITH WITH AN  
[000:01:44;23] OVERSIZED LOAD RAMMED INTO  
[000:01:46;06] AN OVERHEAD GERDER.  
[000:01:47;11] YOU CAN SEE HOW IT DUMPED A  
[000:01:52;26] JUMBO OF CONCRETE INTO THE  
[000:01:54;13] RIVER THAT 18-WHEELER MADE  
[000:01:55;16] IT ACROSS THE BRIDGE.  
[000:01:56;28] EMERGENCY CREWS REPORT TWO  
[000:01:58;05] CARS DID NOT.  
[000:01:58;26] THEY SENT RESCUE BOATS TO  
[000:02:00;20] REACH THE THREE PEOPLE WHO  
[000:02:02;03] WERE INSIDE THOSE CARS.  
[000:02:03;03] THEY SAY NONE OF THEM IS

[000:02:09;27] NOBODY DIED AS A RESULT OF  
[000:02:11;12] THIS.  
[000:02:11;25] WE WERE FORTUNATE IT  
[000:02:12;20] HAPPENED LATER IN THE DAY  
[000:02:13;23] INSTEAD OF, YOU KNOW,  
[000:02:15;17] DURING RUSH HOUR TIME.  
[000:02:16;15] THE IMPACT ON FOR  
[000:02:18;27] WASHINGTON STATE AND THE  
[000:02:19;22] PEOPLE LIVING IN THIS AREA  
[000:02:20;17] AND COMMERCE ON THE WEST  
[000:02:21;23] COAST IS GOING TO BE PRETTY  
[000:02:23;12] SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED  
[000:02:24;07] BECAUSE THIS IS THE MAJOR  
[000:02:25;21] INTERSTATE ROADWAY FOR THE  
[000:02:26;15] THE WEST COAST TO THE  
[000:02:27;07] UNITED STATES.  
[000:02:28;11] >> Shepard: IN FACT IT'S  
[000:02:29;13] THE MAIN LINK BETWEEN  
[000:02:31;02] SEATTLE AND VANCOUVER.  
[000:02:33;01] TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS  
[000:02:33;24] ESTIMATE AN AVERAGE OF  
[000:02:35;02] 71000 VEHICLES CROSS THAT  
[000:02:36;04] BRIDGE EVERY DAY AND  
[000:02:37;07] TONIGHT WE ARE LEARNING  
[000:02:38;03] MORE ABOUT THE TRUCK THAT  
[000:02:39;14] SUPPOSEDLY BROUGHT IT DOWN.  
[000:02:40;29] IT'S FOX TOP STORY AND DAN  
[000:02:43;02] SPRINGER IS ON IT  
[000:02:44;25] MT. VERNON IN WASHINGTON  
[000:02:46;11] TONIGHT.  
[000:02:47;00] DAN?  
[000:02:47;13] >> YEAH, SHEP.  
[000:02:48;20] IT WAS A TRUCK DRIVER FROM  
[000:02:50;20] ALBERTA, CANADA WHO HAD A  
[000:02:52;17] LOT OF EXPERIENCE HAULING  
[000:02:54;21] OVERSIZED LOADS, EVEN  
[000:02:55;23] THOUGH HE HAD A LOT OF  
[000:02:57;08] EXPERIENCE, HE HAD A LOCAL  
[000:02:58;04] DRIVER, A GUIDE WITH HIM  
[000:02:58;28] AND ALSO A PERMIT IT WAS A  
[000:03:00;19] TRIP THAT WENT HORRIBLY  
[000:03:02;05] WRONG.  
[000:03:02;18] INVESTIGATORS SAY THAT THE  
[000:03:03;12] TRUCK WAS TRAVELING IN THE  
[000:03:04;21] FAR RIGHT LANE.  
[000:03:05;20] AND IT HIT THE OVERHEAD  
[000:03:08;04] STEEL GIRDER AT ITS LOWEST  
[000:03:10;16] POINT IF HE HAD BEEN IN THE  
[000:03:11;24] MIDDLE LANE HE LIKELY WOULD  
[000:03:13;00] HAVE CLEARED IT UP.  
[000:03:14;08] DRUG AND ALCOHOL NOT A  
[000:03:16;02] FORK.  
[000:03:16;15] TRUCK DRIVER HAS NOT BEEN  
[000:03:17;18] ARRESTED.  
[000:03:18;03] BOTH DRIVERS WHO PLUNGED  
[000:03:18;27] INTO THE RIVER ARE TALKING  
[000:03:19;26] ABOUT THE FRIGHTENING  
[000:03:21;14] CHERNS.  
[000:03:21;29] 20-YEAR-OLD BRICE KENNING  
[000:03:24;23] WAS SIMPLY HEADING TO PLAY  
[000:03:27;10] HOCKEY.  
[000:03:27;24] >> I WATCHED THIS BRIDGE  
[000:03:29;06] COLLAPSE GOING 60 MILES PER  
[000:03:30;17] HOUR.  
[000:03:31;00] SLAM ON THE BRAKES THERE IS  
[000:03:31;29] NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO IN THAT  
[000:03:33;12] SPLIT SECOND IT WAS WAS  
[000:03:35;19] LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A  
[000:03:36;24] MOVIE, YOU KNOW.  
[000:03:37;20] >> THE NATIONAL  
[000:03:38;23] TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD  
[000:03:40;06] HAS A GO TEAM ON THE GROUND  
[000:03:41;15] HERE AND STARTED ITS  
[000:03:43;05] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:03:43;23] WASHINGTON STATE GOVERNOR  
[000:03:46;10] JAY ENDSLEY DECLARED A  
[000:03:47;14] STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THREE  
[000:03:49;11] SURROUNDING COUNTIES  
[000:03:50;03] BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC  
[000:03:51;21] IMPACT OF HAVING THIS MAIN  
[000:03:53;21] THOROUGHFARE FOR SEVERAL  
[000:03:54;15] MONTHS IT TO COME.  
[000:03:56;03] ESTIMATED REPAIR COST OF  
[000:03:57;12] $15 MILLION.  
[000:03:57;29] THE FEDS HAVE PLEDGED  
[000:03:58;25] $1 MILLION TO GET THE JOB  
[000:04:00;15] MOVING THERE ARE WAYS  
[000:04:01;18] AROUND THIS MESS.  
[000:04:02;09] THEY WILL FILL UP QUICKLY.  
[000:04:03;25] THE FIRST BIG TEST SHEP  
[000:04:05;04] WILL BE THIS HOLIDAY  
[000:04:08;02] WEEKEND.  
[000:04:08;16] >> Shepard: WORKERS BUILT  
[000:04:09;11] THAT BRIDGE IN 1955.  
[000:04:10;03] THE FEDS DESCRIBE IS AS  
[000:04:14;09] FUNCTIONALLY OBSOLETE.  
[000:04:15;07] MEANING ITS DESIGN WAS  
[000:04:16;22] OUTDATED.  
[000:04:17;07] IT WAS NOT AMONG THE 11% OF  
[000:04:18;28] U.S. BRIDGES WHICH  
[000:04:20;15] TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS  
[000:04:21;08] WARN ARE STRUCTURALLY  
[000:04:22;24] DEFICIENT.  
[000:04:23;17] THAT'S HOW ENGINEERS  
[000:04:25;12] DEFINED THE I-25 BRIDGE IN  
[000:04:27;18] MINNEAPOLIS.  
[000:04:28;04] REMEMBER THAT?  
[000:04:28;27] IT COLLAPSED COLLAPSED COLLAPSED IN
[000:04:30;18] 2007.  
[000:04:31;02] A COLLAPSE THAT KILLED 13

[000:05:18;00] NEWSROOM.  
[000:05:18;15] DOUG?

[000:05:19;20] THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S  
[000:05:21;06] ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT  
[000:05:21;27] ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC  
[000:05:22;20] HOLDER SIGNED OFF ON THE  
[000:05:23;25] JAMES ROSEN SEARCH WARRANT  
[000:05:24;21] IS THE LATEST IN WHAT MANY  
[000:05:26;19] BELIEVE TO BE A SHIFTING  
[000:05:27;29] NARRATIVE BY THE NATION'S  
[000:05:29;05] TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  
[000:05:32;05] ON MAY 15TH HE  
[000:05:34;04] CATEGORICALLY DENIED  
[000:05:34;27] INVOLVEMENT IN THE  
[000:05:35;19] PROSECUTION OF REPORTERS  
[000:05:36;19] WHO RECEIVED LEAKED  
[000:05:39;15] INFORMATION.  
[000:05:40;02] WITH REGARD TO THE  
[000:05:40;29] POTENTIAL PROSECUTION OF  
[000:05:41;22] THE PRESS FOR DISCLOSURE OF  
[000:05:42;19] MATERIAL THAT IS NOT  
[000:05:43;25] SOMETHING THAT I HAVE EVER  
[000:05:45;10] BEEN INVOLVED AND HEARD OF  
[000:05:46;14] OR WOULD THINK WOULD BE A  
[000:05:48;13] WISE POLICY.  
[000:05:49;05] IN FACT, MY VIEW IS QUITE  
[000:05:50;22] THE OPPOSITE.  
[000:05:52;14] >> THAT VERY SAME MORNING,  
[000:05:54;11] ON NPR, HE OFFERED A  
[000:05:56;16] DIFFERENT RESPONSE WHEN  
[000:05:57;14] ASKED HOW OFTEN HIS  
[000:05:58;19] DEPARTMENT HAD OBTAINED  
[000:05:59;24] JOURNALIST PHONE RECORDS.  
[000:06:00;18] >> I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY OF  
[000:06:01;28] THOSE CASES I HAVE ACTUALLY  
[000:06:05;13] SIGNED OFF ON.  
[000:06:06;13] I TAKE THEM VERY SERIOUSLY.  
[000:06:07;24] I KNOW THAT I HAVE REFUSED  
[000:06:09;14] TO SIGN A FEW.  
[000:06:13;14] PUSHED A FEW BACK FOR  
[000:06:15;17] MODIFICATIONS.  
[000:06:16;04] >> WHEN ASKED HOW MANY  
[000:06:17;22] REQUESTS FOR SEARCH  
[000:06:18;13] WARRANTS OR SUBPOENAS OF  
[000:06:19;22] JOURNALISTS HE HAD TURNED  
[000:06:23;06] DOWN COULDN'T REMEMBER  
[000:06:24;00] THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING I  
[000:06:24;24] WOULD WANT TO KNOW IF YOU  
[000:06:26;04] MY I WAS ON THE DEFENSIVE  
[000:06:27;00] AND THE PRESIDENT HAD JUST  
[000:06:29;06] EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN HE  
[000:06:30;02] ME.  
[000:06:30;14] THIS IS TRULY AMAZING  
[000:06:35;23] CRITICS ARE DERIDING  
[000:06:37;12] INVESTIGATING REPORTERS  
[000:06:38;05] CALLING IT A CASE OF THE  
[000:06:38;29] ATTORNEY GENERAL  
[000:06:39;18] INVESTIGATING HIMSELF.  
[000:06:40;19] OTHERS BELIEVE HOLDER IS  
[000:06:41;21] TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE  
[000:06:42;23] BETWEEN PROTECTING NATIONAL  
[000:06:44;21] SECURITY AND PRESS FREEDOM.  
[000:06:46;18] THE DOJ SAID IN ITS  
[000:06:48;09] STATEMENT TODAY THAT IT  
[000:06:49;11] FOLLOWED ALL APPLICABLE  
[000:06:50;17] LAWS AND THAT A FEDERAL  
[000:06:52;18] MAGISTRATE OKAYED IT  
[000:06:53;17] DETERMINING THERE WAS,  
[000:06:54;20] INDEED, PROBABLE CAUSE FOR  
[000:06:55;16] A SEARCH WARRANT.  
[000:06:58;07] SHEP?  
[000:06:58;20] >> Shepard: DOUG, THANKS.  
[000:06:59;15] THE PRESIDENT SAYS SEXUAL  
[000:07:00;11] ASSAULT IS A THREAT TO THE

[000:07:04;27] THE U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY

[000:07:07;18] MISCONDUCT BY EVEN A FEW  
[000:07:09;11] SERVICE MEMBERS CAN HURT  
[000:07:10;20] THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION.  
[000:07:11;23] >> THOSE WHO COMMIT SEXUAL  
[000:07:13;11] ASSAULT ARE NOT ONLY  
[000:07:14;13] COMMITTING A CRIME THEY  
[000:07:16;09] THREATENED THE TRUST AND  
[000:07:17;21] DISCIPLINE THAT MAKES OUR  
[000:07:19;16] MILITARY STRONG.  
[000:07:20;09] THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE  
[000:07:21;25] DETERMINED TO STOP THESE  
[000:07:22;26] CRIMES.  
[000:07:24;10] BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT NO  
[000:07:25;08] PLACE IN THE GREATEST  
[000:07:26;15] MILITARY ON EARTH.  
[000:07:28;19] >> Shepard: EARLIER THIS

[000:13:49;21] HIM AND SLIT HIS THROAT.  
[000:13:51;15] ARIAS INITIALLY SAID SHE  
[000:13:52;28] KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE  
[000:13:53;28] MURDER.  
[000:13:54;12] THEN SHE BLAMED IT ON

[000:13:57;03] THEN TESTIFIED THAT SHE DID  
[000:13:58;05] SHOOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE.  
[000:13:59;24] OF COURSE, THE MURDER  
[000:14:01;08] CONVICTION STANDS.

[000:14:02;24] UP TO A NEW JURY TO  
[000:14:04;19] DETERMINE WHETHER SHE GETS  
[000:14:05;18] THE DEATH PENALTY.

[000:14:14;08] >> THAT'S RIGHT, SHEPARD.

[000:14:16;20] THE DATE THAT A NEW JURY  
[000:14:17;25] WOULD BE IMPANELED  
[000:14:20;26] BASICALLY.

[000:14:30;02] DEATH PENALTY OR NOT.  
[000:14:31;10] THIS HAS HAPPENED FIVE  
[000:14:32;03] TIMES IN BEFORE IN ARIZONA  
[000:14:33;17] WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A HUNG  
[000:14:35;25] JURY.  
[000:14:36;08] OF THOSE FIVE TIMES FOUR  
[000:14:39;04] TIMES THE D.A. HAS DECIDED  
[000:14:40;25] THEY WON GETTING THE DEATH  
[000:14:42;28] PENALTY VERDICT.  
[000:14:43;19] IF THE D.A. DOES STICK TO  
[000:14:44;16] HIS GUNS AND SAY HE IS  
[000:14:45;24] GOING TO TRY TO GO FOR THE  
[000:14:47;10] DEATH PENALTY AND CALL THIS  
[000:14:48;17] JURY AS THE JUDGE HAS  
[000:14:50;21] DIRECTED IN JULY IT MAY BE  
[000:14:52;01] A GOOD SIGN FOR THE D.A.  
[000:14:53;08] AND A BAD SIGN FOR JODI  
[000:14:55;26] ARIAS.  
[000:14:56;09] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:14:56;27] >> THEY ARE GOING TO BE  
[000:14:57;20] TOLD THAT THEY NEED TO  
[000:14:59;14] ASSUME THAT THIS WAS  
[000:15:01;07] PLANNED, PREMEDITATED  
[000:15:02;07] MURDER.  
[000:15:02;21] HE THEY ARE GOING TO HEAR  
[000:15:03;16] HOW HEINOUS IT IS.  
[000:15:04;24] AND THIS JURY IS GOING TO  
[000:15:05;22] BE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO  
[000:15:07;14] HAVE NO AUTO FIN AT THIS OR  
[000:15:08;29] CONNECTION WITH JODY AND  
[000:15:10;01] JUST SAY THIS IS A  
[000:15:12;17] CALCULATED, PREMEDITATED  
[000:15:14;05] MASSACRE.  
[000:15:15;29] AND THIS NEW JURY, SHEPARD,  
[000:15:17;26] AGAIN, IF IT DOES GO  
[000:15:19;04] FORWARD IN JULY ALSO  
[000:15:20;06] WOULDN'T HAVE THE  
[000:15:20;25] OPPORTUNITY TO SEE JODI  
[000:15:22;03] ARIAS ON TELEVISION.  
[000:15:23;20] WHY?  
[000:15:25;03] BECAUSE SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO  
[000:15:27;08] SAID NO MORE TV INTERVIEWS
[000:15:30;08] FOR MS. ARIAS.  
[000:15:32;25] SHEPARD?

[000:15:34;15] ALEXANDER'S FAMILY TOLD US  
[000:15:36;19] THE FAMILY DOES NOT WANT TO  
[000:15:38;01] GIVE UP ON DEATH PENALTY.  
[000:15:39;10] TODAY ON "STUDIO B" SHE  
[000:15:40;15] EXPLAINED WHY.  
[000:15:41;03] >> WHILE SHE IS ON THE  
[000:15:42;04] STAND FOR HER 18 DAYS,  
[000:15:43;18] THERE IS SEVERAL POINTS  
[000:15:45;04] THAT SHE MADE THAT A LOT OF  
[000:15:47;05] US WERE THERE FOR AND WE  
[000:15:48;20] KNOW SHE IS LYING.  
[000:15:49;25] IF THERE WAS A THIRD OPTION  
[000:15:51;01] TO HAVE HER ON DEATH ROW  
[000:15:52;09] AND IT WOULDN'T MATTER ONE  
[000:15:53;16] WAY OR ANOTHER WHETHER SHE  
[000:15:54;27] WAS PUT TO DEATH OR NOT BUT  
[000:15:56;07] SHE WAS IN THAT SECLUSION  
[000:15:57;25] WHERE SHE WAS ISOLATED  
[000:15:59;02] THAT WOULD BE GREAT.  
[000:15:59;28] BUT IF THAT'S NOT AN  
[000:16:01;13] OPTION, THEN DEATH IS THE  
[000:16:02;19] OPTION THAT THE FAMILY  
[000:16:04;06] WANTS.  
[000:16:04;19] THEY WANT HER TO IT BE ON  
[000:16:06;09] DEATH ROW.  
[000:16:07;21] >> Shepard: SHE ADDED TODAY

[000:29:57;12] BACK ON FOR 10 HOURS.  
[000:30:02;06] I'M SHEPARD SMITH.  
[000:30:03;03] THIS IS "THE FOX REPORT."  
[000:30:04;04] IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE  
[000:30:05;15] HOUR, TIME FOR THE TOP OF  
[000:30:06;12] THE NEWS.  
[000:30:07;15] AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  
[000:30:08;27] NOW CONFIRMS THE ATTORNEY  
[000:30:10;23] GENERAL ERIC HOLDER HIMSELF  
[000:30:13;14] APPROVED THE SEARCH WARRANT  
[000:30:14;12] THAT LET THE FEDS ACCESS  
[000:30:16;04] FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT  
[000:30:17;06] JAMES ROSEN'S PHONE RECORDS  
[000:30:19;05] AND PERSONAL EMAIL.  
[000:30:21;23] DOCUMENTS SHOW  
[000:30:22;13] INVESTIGATORS GOT THAT  
[000:30:23;08] ACCESS BY CLAIMING JAMES  
[000:30:25;04] ROSEN MIGHT HAVE BROKEN THE  
[000:30:27;15] LAW.  
[000:30:27;28] PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE IS  
[000:30:28;23] WORRIED THAT LEAK  
[000:30:29;26] INVESTIGATIONS WILL KEEP  
[000:30:31;04] JOURNALISTS FROM HOLDING  
[000:30:33;03] GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE, SO  
[000:30:34;06] HE IS GIVING THE ATTORNEY  
[000:30:35;05] GENERAL LESS THAN TWO  
[000:30:36;10] MONTHS TO REVIEW JUSTICE  
[000:30:38;14] DEPARTMENT GUIDELINES WITH  
[000:30:39;19] INPUT FROM THE MEDIA.  
[000:30:41;10] ED HENRY IS ON THE FOX TOP  
[000:30:42;29] STORY LIVE FROM WASHINGTON  
[000:30:44;07] TONIGHT.  
[000:30:44;22] ED REPUBLICANS SAY LETTING  
[000:30:46;05] THE A.G. REVIEW HIMSELF IS  
[000:30:47;27] KIND OF A WAY OF CUTTING  
[000:30:49;09] HIM SOME SLACK?  
[000:30:50;00] >> SURE, SHEP, BECAUSE THE  
[000:30:51;14] PRESIDENT AND ATTORNEY  
[000:30:52;07] GENERAL ARE VERY CLOSE.  
[000:30:53;01] THE PRESIDENT HAS DEFENDED  
[000:30:54;18] HIM BEFORE DURING PREVIOUS  
[000:30:56;14] POLITICAL FIRE STORMS LIKE  
[000:30:57;09] THE FAST AND FURIOUS GUN  
[000:31:00;02] RUNNING INVESTIGATION FOR  
[000:31:01;07] EXAMPLE AND THE FORMER BUSH  
[000:31:02;18] WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF  
[000:31:03;24] ANDY CARD TOLD US TODAY  
[000:31:04;28] THAT AT THE VERY LEAST WITH  
[000:31:06;23] THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD  
[000:31:08;00] DO IS FIND SOME INDEPENDENT  
[000:31:10;00] PERSON EITHER WITHIN THE  
[000:31:10;28] JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR  
[000:31:12;06] OUTSIDE TO COME IN AND  
[000:31:13;20] ACTUALLY LEAD THIS REVIEW.  
[000:31:14;21] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:31:15;13] >> WELL I HOPE THE  
[000:31:16;16] ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD SAY  
[000:31:17;12] I AM NOT GOING TO  
[000:31:18;26] INVESTIGATE MYSELF.  
[000:31:19;24] I'M GOING TO APPOINT THIS  
[000:31:21;24] PERSON WHO I AM NOT GOING  
[000:31:24;28] TO DIRECT TO TAKE A LOOK AT  
[000:31:26;16] IT.  
[000:31:27;05] >> NOW, SENIOR DEMOCRATS  
[000:31:28;24] THOUGH TELL ME THAT'S NOT  
[000:31:29;27] GOING TO HAPPEN.  
[000:31:30;28] THEY BELIEVE INSIDE THE  
[000:31:32;17] HOUSE THAT IN FACT THIS  
[000:31:33;21] WILL BE A THOROUGH  
[000:31:35;04] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:31:35;21] AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'M  
[000:31:37;03] HEARING FROM DEMOCRATS  
[000:31:38;00] CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:31:39;01] THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HAPPY  
[000:31:40;14] WITH WHAT WAS DONE WITH  
[000:31:41;24] JAMES ROSEN.  
[000:31:42;18] THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE A  
[000:31:44;15] CRIMINAL COCONSPIRATOR.  
[000:31:45;10] THEY REALIZE THAT WAS A  
[000:31:46;25] GOVERNMENT OVERREACH AND  
[000:31:47;17] THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT  
[000:31:48;12] HAS DEMANDED THIS REVIEW  
[000:31:51;09] SHEP.  
[000:31:51;22] >> Shepard: WHITE HOUSE  
[000:31:52;14] OFFICIALS INSIST THEY WILL  
[000:31:53;10] NOT PROTECT THE JUSTICE  
[000:31:54;05] DEPARTMENT.  
[000:31:54;21] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:31:55;10] THEY SAY LOOK NO FURTHER  
[000:31:56;03] THAN THE PRESIDENT'S OWN  
[000:31:57;09] BLUNT WORDS YESTERDAY.  
[000:31:58;14] WHEN HE GAVE THAT SPEECH  
[000:31:59;08] ABOUT THE BALANCE IN TERMS  
[000:32:00;17] OF DEALING WITH FIGHTING  
[000:32:03;05] TERRORISM, WHETHER HE USED  
[000:32:04;04] DRONES AND OTHER TOOLS, HE  
[000:32:05;29] ALSO TALKED ABOUT THESE  
[000:32:07;22] LEAK INVESTIGATIONS AND THE  
[000:32:08;19] BALANCE THERE.  
[000:32:09;09] THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY  
[000:32:10;05] DIRECT IN SAYING  
[000:32:11;09] JOURNALISTS SHOULD NOT BE  
[000:32:12;10] PROSECUTED AS HE SAID FOR  
[000:32:13;21] DOING THEIR JOBS.  
[000:32:14;18] THEN HE SAID THIS:  
[000:32:16;14] >> AND I HAVE RAISED THESE  
[000:32:18;01] ISSUES WITH THE ATTORNEY  
[000:32:18;24] GENERAL WHO SHARES MY  
[000:32:20;02] CONCERNS.  
[000:32:20;17] SO HE HAS AGREED TO REVIEW  
[000:32:23;05] EXISTING DEPARTMENT OF  
[000:32:24;04] JUSTICE GUIDELINES  
[000:32:24;26] GOVERNING INVESTIGATIONS  
[000:32:26;13] THAT INVOLVE REPORTERS.  
[000:32:27;26] AND HE WILL CONVENE A GROUP  
[000:32:29;19] OF MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS TO  
[000:32:30;26] HEAR THEIR CONCERNS AS PART  
[000:32:31;26] OF THAT REVIEW.  
[000:32:34;09] >> AND THEY SAY INSIDE THE  
[000:32:35;17] WHITE HOUSE THAT THIS IS  
[000:32:36;16] SORT OF A MIDDLE STEP  
[000:32:37;14] BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CAN'T  
[000:32:38;16] JUST PICK UP THE PHONE EVEN  
[000:32:39;18] IF HE HE DISAGREES WITH  
[000:32:40;23] ERIC HOLDER ABOUT THE JAMES  
[000:32:42;00] ROSEN
[000:32:42;28] AND SAY SHUT THIS DOWN.  
[000:32:44;06] THAT WOULD BE MET LING WITH  
[000:32:49;23] THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.  
[000:32:51;08] THAT WOULD BE A BIGGER  
[000:32:54;28] SCANDAL.  
[000:32:55;13] >> Shepard: TRIBUTE TO FOUR  
[000:32:56;19] YOUNG GIRLS DIED CIVIL  
[000:32:59;19] RIGHTS.  
[000:33:00;03] THREE OF THOSE GIRLS WERE  
[000:33:01;04] 14 YEARS OLD.  
[000:33:01;22] THE FOURTH WAS JUST 11.  
[000:33:03;03] THEY WERE INSIDE A BATHROOM  
[000:33:04;25] WHEN THE BOMB BLAST TORE  
[000:33:06;18] APART THAT CHURCH IN  
[000:33:08;07] BIRMINGHAM.  
[000:33:09;05] TODAY PRESIDENT OBAMA  
[000:33:10;23] POSTHUMOUSLY AWARDED THOSE  
[000:33:11;26] GIRLS THE CONGRESSIONAL  
[000:33:13;02] GOLD MEDAL, THE NATION'S  
[000:33:14;20] HIGHEST CIVILIAN HONOR.  
[000:33:15;23] >> FOR US TO BE ABLE TO  
[000:33:18;29] OVAL OFFICE WITH SOME  
[000:33:23;05] PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED HARD  
[000:33:24;15] TO MAKE THIS DAY POSSIBLE  
[000:33:26;14] AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT  
[000:33:29;09] TRAGIC LOSS, THAT HEART  
[000:33:32;27] BREAK HELP [INAUDIBLE]

[000:33:39;08] KLAN MEMBERS OF THE  
[000:33:40;01] BOMBING.  
[000:33:40;22] ONE IS STILL IN PRISON.  
[000:33:42;00] THE OTHER TWO ARE NOW DEAD.  
[000:33:44;04] REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WANT  
[000:33:44;29] TO TRY AGAIN TO GET ANSWERS  
[000:33:46;25] FROM LOIS LERNER.  
[000:33:47;26] SHE IS THE IRS OFFICIAL WHO  
[000:33:49;12] REFUSED TO RESPOND TO  
[000:33:50;18] QUESTIONS AT A HEARING  
[000:33:51;17] EARLIER THIS WEEK ON THE  
[000:33:53;04] AGENCY'S TARGETING OF  
[000:33:54;03] CONSERVATIVE GROUPS.  
[000:33:55;15] WITHBUT SINCE SHE INVOKED THE  
[000:33:58;09] FIFTH AMENDMENT AFTER SHE  
[000:34:00;01] WROTE A STATEMENT IN WHICH  
[000:34:01;14] SHE MAINTAINED HER  
[000:34:02;25] INNOCENCE.  
[000:34:03;11] G.O.P. LAWMAKERS SAY SHE  
[000:34:04;04] WAIVED HER RIGHTS AGAINST

[000:34:08;01] D.C. NEWSROOM TONIGHT.  
[000:34:09;06] MIKE?  
[000:34:09;19] >> WELL, SHEP, LOIS LERNER  
[000:34:11;06] CREATED QUITE A STIR WHEN  
[000:34:12;10] SHE SAYS SHE HASN'T DONE  
[000:34:13;15] ANYTHING WRONG HASN'T  
[000:34:14;14] BROKEN ANY LAWS AND THEN  
[000:34:15;25] TOOK THE FIFTH.  
[000:34:16;22] THAT LED TO SOME  
[000:34:17;24] REPUBLICANS AND THEIR  
[000:34:18;17] LAWYERS SAYING BY MAKING  
[000:34:19;27] THOSE COMMENTS SHE WAIVED  
[000:34:21;06] HER FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT.  
[000:34:22;09] THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE'S  
[000:34:23;26] TOP DEMOCRAT SAYS WHILE HE  
[000:34:24;26] WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM  
[000:34:26;13] HER.  
[000:34:26;25] FORGET ABOUT IT.  
[000:34:27;15] >> I WOULD NOT RECALL HER  
[000:34:29;08] BECAUSE FOR ONE THING I  
[000:34:31;16] KNOW THAT WHAT HE SHE WILL  
[000:34:32;29] DO IS REASSERT HER RIGHTS  
[000:34:35;22] UNDER THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.  
[000:34:36;27] I KNOW THAT AND I THINK  
[000:34:39;00] THERE IS A 99.99 CHANCE  
[000:34:41;21] THAT SHEED YOU WOULD.  
[000:34:43;26] >> DANIEL MAKING CHANGES

[000:34:52;22] SAID NO SHOW SHE WAS PLACED  
[000:34:54;10] ON LEAVE.  
[000:34:56;01] >> SHE WILL STILL BE  
[000:34:57;08] RECEIVING HER PAYCHECK.  
[000:34:58;07] IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLEAD  
[000:35:00;19] THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND YOU  
[000:35:01;14] ARE NOT GOING TO BE PART OF  
[000:35:02;27] A CONGRESSIONAL  
[000:35:03;19] INVESTIGATION YOU ARE NOT  
[000:35:05;11] GOING TO PARTICIPATE.  
[000:35:06;15] I THINK SUSPENSION WITHOUT

[000:35:08;17] TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

[000:35:26;04] SMOKE SPEWING FROM ONE OF  
[000:35:27;01] THE PLANE'S ENGINES AND IT  
[000:35:28;21] CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE IT,  
[000:35:29;29] DOESN'T IT?  
[000:35:30;15] A PASSENGER ALSO RECORDED  
[000:35:31;25] THIS VIDEO IT APPARENTLY

[000:40:40;25] DOWN 1% FROM A YEAR AGO.  
[000:40:42;08] PART OF THE REASON COULD BE  
[000:40:43;16] HIGHER GAS PRICES ANALYSTS  
[000:40:45;08] SAY IN THE UPPER MIDWEST,

[000:41:11;14] THE COAT ON MEMORIAL DAY  
[000:41:12;06] MIGHT HAVE PART OF IT.  
[000:41:14;03] >> YEAH.  
[000:41:15;13] COLD FRONT CAME IN THROUGH  
[000:41:16;20] HERE, SHEPARD.  
[000:41:17;08] I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO  
[000:41:18;02] THE BEACH TOMORROW BUT IT  
[000:41:21;23] IS THE OFFICIAL START OF  
[000:41:23;20] THE UNOFFICIAL START OF THE  
[000:41:24;26] SUMMER HOLIDAY SEASON.  
[000:41:25;26] AND IT IS STARTING WITH THE  
[000:41:26;28] HIGHEST GAS PRICES FOR A  
[000:41:30;07] MEMORIAL DAY IN TWO YEARS  
[000:41:33;09] WITH PRICES FOR REGULAR  
[000:41:34;29] GALLON OF GAS UP 15 CENTS  
[000:41:36;07] JUST IN THE LAST MONTH  
[000:41:37;18] ALONE.  
[000:41:38;02] AND IN 8 STATES ACCORDING  
[000:41:39;24] TO A.A.A. GAS IS ABOVE $4 A  
[000:41:42;29] GALLON.  
[000:41:43;13] PART OF THE REASON AS YOU  
[000:41:45;07] MENTIONED, IS BECAUSE OF  
[000:41:47;04] REFINERIES WITH MAINTENANCE  
[000:41:48;06] AND REPAIR ISSUES.  
[000:41:49;02] WHICH HAS HURT GASOLINE  
[000:41:51;26] SUPPLIES.  
[000:41:52;11] TRIPLE A SURVEYED DRIVERS  
[000:41:53;24] ABOUT WHETHER HIGHER PRICES  
[000:41:55;07] WOULD EFFECT THEIR MEMORIAL  
[000:41:57;04] DAY TRAVEL PLANS.  
[000:41:58;18] AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE  
[000:42:01;20] PEOPLE SAID NO, BUT THE  
[000:42:03;10] REST SAID YES.  
[000:42:04;21] 27 PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD  
[000:42:05;18] TRY TO SAVE MONEY IN OTHER  
[000:42:07;19] AREAS ON THEIR MEMORIAL DAY  
[000:42:10;06] VACATION.  
[000:42:10;26] 8 PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD  
[000:42:12;01] TAKE SHORTER TRIPS AND  
[000:42:14;17] 3 PERCENT SAID THEY  
[000:42:15;08] WOULDN'T DRIVE AT ALL.  
[000:42:16;07] THEY WOULD FIND SOME  
[000:42:18;15] ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION  
[000:42:19;24] SHEPARD.  
[000:42:20;09] >> Shepard: SO GAS IS KIND  
[000:42:21;03] OF HIGH.  
[000:42:21;18] WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK COMING  
[000:42:22;27] UP?  
[000:42:23;09] >> WELL TRIPLE A THINKS  
[000:42:25;07] THAT PRICES WILL START  
[000:42:27;07] FALLING SHORTLY.  
[000:42:30;04] >> SO WE DO EXPECT PRICES  
[000:42:31;23] SHOULD DROP IN THE COMING  
[000:42:33;01] DAYS GIVEN THE FACT THAT  
[000:42:34;17] SOME REFINERIES ARE COMING  
[000:42:36;17] BACK ONLINE THAT'S  
[000:42:37;07] RESULTING IN GAS INCREASE  
[000:42:38;22] REDUCTION AND OIL PRICE  
[000:42:41;03] DROP AS WELL.  
[000:42:41;24] OIL PRICES SHOULD DROP IN  
[000:42:43;07] JUNE.  
[000:42:43;20] THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO YOU  
[000:42:44;17] ANY GOOD FOR MEMORIAL DAY.  
[000:42:46;22] >> AND A STATE HARDEST HIT  
[000:42:48;08] BY THOSE REFINERY PROBLEMS  
[000:42:50;16] MINNESOTA WHERE PRICES ARE  
[000:42:52;28] UP 80 CENTS A GALLON JUST  
[000:42:54;06] IN THE LAST MONTH.  
[000:42:56;16] SHEPARD?  
[000:42:57;27] >> Shepard: WOW, PETER  
[000:42:58;19] BARNES LIVE IN CHEVY CHASE,  
[000:43:00;00] MARYLAND TONIGHT.  
[000:43:00;19] THE WEATHER WILL NOT BE  
[000:43:02;00] COOPERATING MUCH AT ALL FOR  
[000:43:02;28] THE EAST COAST WHERE IT IS  
[000:43:03;29] EXPECTED TO FEEL MORE LIKE  
[000:43:05;19] WINTER THAN THE START OF  
[000:43:06;25] SUMMER.  
[000:43:07;09] COLD, WET, EVEN WORD OF  
[000:43:08;13] SNOW IN SOME PARS.  
[000:43:11;21] METEOROLOGIST ANDRE FUNTE  
[000:43:19;18] FOX 5.  
[000:43:20;02] >> WHAT A HORRIBLE WAY TO  
[000:43:21;12] START THE WEEKEND IN THE  
[000:43:22;20] NORTHEAST.  
[000:43:23;06] COLD AND RAINY ALL DAY  
[000:43:25;09] LONG.  
[000:43:25;22] MORE TONIGHT AND EVEN INTO  
[000:43:26;26] TOMORROW.  
[000:43:27;11] WE HAVE AN AREA OF LOW  
[000:43:28;04] PRESSURE THAT IS SITTING  
[000:43:28;29] JUST TO OUR EAST AND ON THE  
[000:43:30;12] BACK SIDE OF IT COLD AIR IS  
[000:43:32;15] BEING PULLED IN FROM CANADA  
[000:43:33;16] AND RAINY WEATHER  
[000:43:34;24] PERSISTENT AS THIS AIR IS  
[000:43:37;19] GOING TO BE SLOW TO MOVE  
[000:43:39;24] OUT OF THE REGION.  
[000:43:40;20] THIS THE 30'S AND 40S IN  
[000:43:41;26] THE GREAT LAKES ALL THE WAY  
[000:43:42;22] INTO THE NEW ENGLAND AND  
[000:43:43;20] HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOUT  
[000:43:45;28] 2500 FEET WE COULD ACTUALLY  
[000:43:47;10] SEE SOME WET SNOW COMING  
[000:43:48;17] OUT OF THE SKIES TONIGHT.  
[000:43:49;24] THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:43:50;19] SNOW.  
[000:43:51;02] IT WON'T BE ACCUMULATING  
[000:43:52;23] BUT ENOUGH TO CAUSE A MAJOR  
[000:43:54;06] NUISANCE CONSIDERING THIS  
[000:43:55;00] IS THE UNOFFICIAL START OF  
[000:43:56;05] SUMMER AND STILL LOOKS LIKE  
[000:43:57;14] WINTER OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW.  
[000:43:59;08] ELSEWHERE AROUND THE NATION  
[000:44:00;06] WE DO HAVE SOME RAIN COMING  
[000:44:01;24] THROUGH MINNESOTA THERE IS  
[000:44:02;20] THE POTENTIAL FOR SLIGHT  
[000:44:03;17] RISK OF SEVERE  
[000:44:04;24] THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE  
[000:44:05;18] WESTERN DAKOTAS AND WESTERN  
[000:44:06;28] NEBRASKA TOMORROW.  
[000:44:07;20] FLOODING RAINS TO OUR SOUTH  
[000:44:09;04] TEXAS TODAY AND THAT WET  
[000:44:10;09] WEATHER IS GOING TO MOVE  
[000:44:11;16] SLIGHTLY EASTWARD AS WE GET  
[000:44:13;01] INTO THE DAY TOMORROW.  
[000:44:14;11] OUT TOWARDS THE WEST  
[000:44:16;27] SCATTERED SHOWERS IN  
[000:44:18;15] SEATTLE.  
[000:44:18;29] NICE AND DRY ACROSS THE  
[000:44:20;07] FOUR CORNER STATES.  
[000:44:21;09] ALSO FINDING SOME BIG HEAT  
[000:44:22;20] WITH THAT WILL ALSO COME  
[000:44:24;01] THE POTENTIAL FOR FIRE  
[000:44:25;03] DANGER ACROSS NORTHERN  
[000:44:26;18] PARTS OF ARIZONA INTO THE  
[000:44:27;16] FOUR CORNERS.  
[000:44:28;22] BE AWARE OF THAT COOL IN  
[000:44:29;19] THE NORTHWEST BUT SEATTLE  
[000:44:30;22] COMING IN THE LOW 60'S.  
[000:44:31;17] IF YOU WANT SOME HOT NICE  
[000:44:33;17] WEATHER IT LOOKS LIKE THE  
[000:44:34;25] GULF COAST IS GOING TO GET  
[000:44:36;00] THE BEST PART OF THE START  
[000:44:37;00] OF THE MEMORIAL DAY  
[000:44:38;00] WEEKEND.  
[000:44:38;15] THAT'S WHERE WE WILL FIND  
[000:44:40;11] READINGS ACE FROM NEW  
[000:44:41;08] ORLEANS TO SOUTH FLORIDA.  
[000:44:42;24] TOMORROW MORNING START OFF  
[000:44:44;06] WITH NEAR RECORD LOWS  
[000:44:45;21] CAROLINAS.  
[000:44:46;06] REBOUND NICELY IN THE  
[000:44:46;28] AFTERNOON WITH THE HIGH  
[000:44:47;22] TEMPERATURES MOVING INTO  
[000:44:48;16] THE 70s.  
[000:44:49;01] SHEP, OVER TO YOU.  
[000:44:50;15] >> Shepard: AUDREY, THANKS.  
[000:44:51;10] JUST IN TIME FOR HURRICANE  
[000:44:52;15] SEASON A KEY SATELLITE THAT  
[000:44:54;02] TRACKS SEVERE WEATHER ALL  
[000:44:54;25] UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST  
[000:44:56;12] HAS FAILED FOR THE SECOND  
[000:44:57;28] TIME IN TWO YEARS.  
[000:44:59;08] RESEARCHERS SAY THE  
[000:45:00;06] SATELLITE STARTED HAVING  
[000:45:01;01] ISSUES ON WEDNESDAY WHEN IT  
[000:45:02;01] FAILED TO RELAY IMAGES BACK  
[000:45:03;21] TO IRTD.  
[000:45:04;10] IN THE MEANTIME SCIENTISTS  
[000:45:05;18] SAY THEY HAVE ACTIVATED A  
[000:45:07;02] SPARE SATELLITE WHERE WHILE  
[000:45:08;12] THEY WORKED TO FIX THE ONE  
[000:45:09;18] THAT'S UP THERE BROKEN.  
[000:45:10;18] NO WORD ON WHEN THEY MIGHT  
[000:45:11;22] GET THAT PRIMARY SATELLITE  
[000:45:12;24] BACK UP AND RUNNING.  
[000:45:14;15] WELL, YOU WOULD NOT THINK  
[000:45:15;16] THAT A LITTLE WATER WOULD  
[000:45:17;02] BE SUCH A BIG PROBLEM FOR  
[000:45:19;02] FISH.  
[000:45:20;19] BUT THE STORM SURGE FROM  
[000:45:25;18] SUPER STORM SANDY CAUSED  
[000:45:26;29] MAJOR DAMAGE AT THE NEW  
[000:45:27;27] YORK AQUARIUM.  
[000:45:29;02] TONIGHT, A LOOK AT ALL THE  
[000:45:30;07] HARD WORK THAT'S GONE INTO  
[000:45:31;11] THE CLEAN UP THERE AND TALK  
[000:45:32;12] ABOUT A COME BACK.  
[000:45:33;06] ONE OF THE AREAS IN SANDY'S  
[000:45:34;20] PATH HAS JUST TAKEN THE TOP  
[000:45:36;10] SPOT IN A NEW POLL OF THE  
[000:45:38;05] NATION'S BEST BEACHES.  
[000:45:39;20] SO WHERE IS THAT?  
[000:45:41;09] IT'S COMING UP AS FOX  
[000:45:42;28] REPORTS THIS FRIDAY FOR  
[000:45:44;15] MEMORIAL DAY.
[000:45:50;01] Why are twice as many people  choosing
[000:45:50;21] Verizon  over any other carrier?
[000:45:54;06] Many choose us because we have  the
[000:45:54;27] largest 4GLTE network.
[000:45:59;06] Others, because of our  reputation
[000:45:59;26] for reliability.
[000:46:02;26] Or maybe it's because  we've received
[000:46:03;18] JD Power
[000:46:04;20] and Associates' customer service 
[000:46:05;10] award 4X in a row.
[000:46:08;19] In the end  there are countless reasons.
[000:46:11;12] But one choi.
[000:47:01;07] >> Shepard: THE JERSEY  
[000:47:02;29] GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE IS

[000:47:33;04] TONIGHT IN THE RECOVERY  
[000:47:33;29] FROM THAT HURRICANE.  
[000:47:35;16] THE NEW YORK AQUARIUM IS

[000:47:40;02] ISLAND, THE BOARD WALK  
[000:47:41;01] THERE AND PLAYS AN  
[000:47:41;28] IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

[000:47:43;17] IT NORMALLY BRINGS IN  
[000:47:44;15] TOURISTS AND SCHOOL GROUPS  
[000:47:45;16] EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.  
[000:47:47;07] IT'S BEEN CLOSED EVER SINCE  
[000:47:50;00] LAST OCTOBER'S STORM CAUSED  
[000:47:51;21] SEVERE DAMAGE ACROSS THE  
[000:47:52;25] PARK.  
[000:47:55;22] THE ANIMALS ARE AS PLAYFUL  
[000:47:57;12] AS EVER BUT THE ONLY  
[000:47:58;26] VISITORS THEY HAVE SEEN

[000:48:06;08] FROM SUPER STORM SANDY.  
[000:48:07;10] >> WE WERE WORKING FOR A  
[000:48:08;12] BIG STORM.  
[000:48:09;08] NOTHING PREPARED US FOR THE  
[000:48:11;09] STORM THAT HAPPENED.  
[000:48:12;23] >> Shepard: THIS IS WHAT  
[000:48:13;16] HAPPENED LAST FALL AT THE

[000:48:21;28] FAST IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.  
[000:48:23;18] I THINK WE WERE ALL FEELING  
[000:48:25;09] THE SAME THING WHICH WAS  
[000:48:27;01] WHEN IS THIS GOING TO STOP?  
[000:48:29;01] >> Shepard: ONCE IT DID,  
[000:48:29;24] WORKERS FOUND THE WATER HAD  
[000:48:31;01] DESTROYED MUCH OF THE

[000:48:44;02] OTHER LEVELS IT'S A VERY  
[000:48:45;25] SIMPLE ADRENALINE FOCUSED  
[000:48:47;15] TASK, RIGHT?  
[000:48:48;03] WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO  
[000:48:49;05] AND WE JUST GOT TO FOCUS ON  
[000:48:50;19] DOING THAT.

[000:49:38;16] REALLY VIBRANT HOWEVER  
[000:49:39;24] MUCH SMALLER IT FOR THE
