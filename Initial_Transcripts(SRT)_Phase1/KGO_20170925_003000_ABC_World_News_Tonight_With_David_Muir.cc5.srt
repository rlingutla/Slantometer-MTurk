all those laxatives,
daily probiotics,

583
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
endless fiber--
it could be wearing on you.

584
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Tell your doctor
what you've tried,

585
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and how long you've been at it.

586
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
LINZESS works differently
from laxatives.

587
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
LINZESS treats adults
with IBS

588
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
with Constipation
or Chronic Constipation.

589
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It can help relieve
your belly pain

and lets you have more frequent
and complete bowel movements

591
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
that are easier to pass.e NZESS
to children less than six

592
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
and it should not be given
to children

593
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
six to less than eighteen.
It may harm them.

594
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't take LINZESS
if you have a bowel blockage.

595
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Get immediate help
if you develop

596
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
unusual or severe
stomach pain,

597
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
especially with
bloody or black stools.

598
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The most common side effect
is diarrhea, sometimes severe.

599
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
If it's severe,
stop taking LINZESS

600
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and call your doctor
right away.

601
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Other side effects
include gas,

00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
stomach-area pain
and swelling.

603
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Talk to your doctor about

Do what I did.

621
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Ask your doctor about HUMIRA.

622
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's proven to help relieve pain
and protect joints

623
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
from further irreversible damage
in many adults.

624
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
HUMIRA works by targeting
and helping to block

625
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
a specific source
of inflammation

626
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
that contributes to RA symptoms.

627
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
HUMIRA has been clinically
studied for over 20 years.

628
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability
to fight infections,

629
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
including tuberculosis.

630
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000

infections and cancers,

heart failure.

634
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

635
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Tell your doctor
if you've been to areas

636
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
where certain fungal infections
are common,

637
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
and if you've had TB,
hepatitis B,

638
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000

flu-like symptoms or sores.

639
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000

you have an infection.

718
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
>>> LIVE, WHERE YOU LIVE, THIS

719
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
IS ABC 7 NEWS.

720
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
>>> A PEACEFUL APPEARANCE, BUT A

721
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
BIG PRICE TAG.

722
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
TODAY CONSERVATIVE PROVOCATEUR

723
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
SHOWED UP AT A CANCELED EVENT

724
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
WHERE HE DREW A FEW SUPPORTERS

725
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
AND A LOT OF POLICE.

726
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
GOOD EVENING.
I'M ERIC THOMAS.

727
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

728
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
MILO YIANNOPOULOUS WAS IN AND

729
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
OUT WITH LITTLE TO NO

730
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
RESISTANCE.
BUT AS TIFFANY WILSON TELLS US,

731
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S SAYING.

732
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
SHE JOINS US LIVE FROM BERKELEY.

733
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
>> Reporter: WE SAW INTERESTING

734
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN WHAT WE

735
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
SAW HERE IN THE FIELD AND THE

736
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
STATEMENT THAT MILO

737
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
YIANNOPOULOUS RELEASED.

738
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
HE SAYS THAT PROTESTERS STORMED

739
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THE BARRICADES AND THAT HE HAD

740
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
TO BE RUSHED OUT OF UC

741
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
BERKELEY'S CAMPUS.

742
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
WE WERE RIGHT THERE AND WE DID

743
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
NOT SEE ANYONE GOING OVER THE

744
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
BARRICA

745
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
BARRICADES.
IN FACT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY

746
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
DIFFICULT TO DO SO BECAUSE THERE

747
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
WERE POLICE OFFICERS EVERY FEW

748
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
FEET ALONG THE PERIMETER.

749
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
ALSO UC BERKELEY OFFICIALS SAY

750
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
THEY DON'TWHY

751
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
LEFT WHEN HE DID, BUT IT WAS HIS

752
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
CHOICE.

753
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
HIS UNSANCTIONED AND UNSPONSORED

754
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
APPEARANCE ON UC BERKELEY'S

755
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
CAMPUS CREATED HOURS OF

756
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
DISRUPTION AND DISCORD.

757
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
AND IT COST THE UNIVERSITY AT

758
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
LEAST $800,000 IN SECURITY.

759
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
YIANNOPOULOS SAW IT DIFFERENTLY.

760
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
>> I GOT TO
