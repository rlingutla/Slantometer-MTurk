THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT

PROBLEMS AND ISSUES AND I

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
BELIEVE THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THAT THE IRS ABUSED THE PLAYER

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
TO ESCAPE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THAT THEIR COUNTRY HAS BECOME.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
IT COULD CREATE NOW HAVENS FOR

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000

SECURITY TIME TALKED ABOUT THE

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
NEXT STEP AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
IS UNFOLDING, PICTURES THAT ARE

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
SO HARD TO LOOK AT AND

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO AUNTICATE AND SEEM

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
TO GO ALONG WITH CHEMICAL

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ATTACKS IN SYRIA.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AND MORE ON THE HIGH LEVEL

MEETING FOR YOU.
AND FIRST A DEADLY GAME OF BACK

HOURED IN OF SYRIA.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THEY ARE ACCUSING THE ANTI-

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
GOVERNMENT REBELS OF USING

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND OTHERS CALL

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000

FROM THE NERVE GAS ASSAULT ON

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A NEIGHBORHOOD THEY SAY.

65

DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
ASKED THE PENTAGON TO PREPARE

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
MILITARY OPTIONS FOR SYRIA AND

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THAT REQUIRES POSIINGING OUR

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000

IS NOT TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
AND THE CHIEF IS THERE TO URGE

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
UNITED NATION'S EXPERTS TO LOOK

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000

WERE KILLED AND SOME HAVE THE

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
NUMBER MUCH HIGHER AND IF

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
CONFIRMED IT WOULD BE THE

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
WOFRSOUS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SINCE SADDAM HUSSEIN GASSED

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
LINE.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GETTING

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
DEPARTMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
TO PROVIDE THE PRESIDENT WITH

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OPTIONS FOR ALL CONTINGENCY AND

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
THAT REQUIRES POSITIONING OUR

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
FORCES AND ASSETS TO BE ABLE FOR

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE PRESIDENT TO CHOOSE.

WAR SHIPS IN THE REGION, HARRIS.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
>> IT IS AWFULLY DIFFICULT WHEN

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WE ARE NOT BEGIN INFORMATION OR

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
NOTES TO KNOW WHETHER AND THIS

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
IS A QUESTION, DOES THIS MEAN

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
MILITARY ACTIONS MORE OR LESS

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
LIKELY AT THIS POINT?
>> IT CERTAINLY GIVES PRESIDENT

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
OBAMA MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ORDER

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AIR STRIKES OR MISSILE ATTACKS

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
IF HE DECIDES TO DO.

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THAT ONE FORMER UN AMBASSADOR

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
SAID PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES WITH SYRIA

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
AND ITS GOVERNMENT AND STOCK

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
POIL OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HIMSELF

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A YEAR AGO THAT THE USE OF

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD CROSS

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A REDLINE AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
OF THE UNITED STATES MAKES

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A STATEMENT LIKE THAT, HE NEEDS

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
TO BE PREPARED TO DO MANAGE

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DRAMATIC IF THE REDLINE IS

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
CROSSED.

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
OTHERWISE HIS CREDIBILITY IS

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
GRAVELY DAMAGED AND THAT'S WHERE

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
WE ARE AT THE MOMENT.

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
>> BUT BOLTON BELIEVES THAT THE

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ADMINISTRATION WILL TRY TO

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
INDICT THE SYRIAN REGIME IN THE

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
>> MOLLY, ON THE STORY ON WHICH

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WE HAVE SEEN MOVEMENT SO MUCH.

154
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE WHAT

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WE LEARNED FROM MOLLY.

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
WHAT IS A SERIOUS RESPONSE

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
LIKELY TO LOOK LIKE?

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000

WOULD BE PROUD OF THE SPIRIT OF

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
NONVIOLENCE AND GENERALIZED GOOD

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WILL.

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
FOR ME THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENTS

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
CAME NOT FROM THE PODIUM BUT

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
SOME OF WHOM WERE HERE TO WATCH

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THAT SPEECH IN KNOWN 63, AND

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT AND MANY

198
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
OTHERS WHO WATCHED IT ON

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
TELEVISION AND STILL OTHERS WHO

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
LIVE IN THE SEGGATED SOUTH LIKE

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THE BROTHERS WHO GREW UP IN

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
MOBILE, OBAMA.

203
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> IT WAS ROUGH.

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SEGREGATION WAS ALIVE AND WELL.

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
AND IT WAS HARD FOR BLACK PEOPLE

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
TO STICK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THINGS, BECAUSE OF THE

208
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
VIOLATION.
THE BOMBING IN BIRMINGHAM AND

209
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
MEG AREAS AND ALL OF THE THINGS

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
WERE GOING ON AND SO YOUR

211
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
PARENTS WERE RELUCTANT TO HAVE

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
YOU PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
KNEW THE CONSEQUENCES.

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> THERE IS A LOT OF WORK IN

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
PROGRESS AND UP TO US AS THE

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
BABY BOMERS AND TO PASS ON TO MY

217
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
GREAT NEPHEWS AND BEING PART OF

218
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THE MOVEMENT AND ACTION AND TO

219
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
VOLUNTEER AND HELP YOUR

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
FELLOWMAN.
>> WE FOUND ONE MARCHER WHO IS

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
94 YEARS OLD AND MARCHED IN THE

222
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
1963 EVENT.

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HE HAD THE SAME SIGN HE CARRIED

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
IN KNOWN 63 AND HERE HE WAS

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
IMPARTING ADVICE IN A FEISTY WAY

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
TO THE YOUNG FOLKS AROUND HIM.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
>> THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT I

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THINK, IT IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THINK?

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
IT?

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ANSWER ME, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

233
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
DO APPROXIMATE IT?

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
>> HE TOLD US THAT HE WAS

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A TRUCK DRIVER AND HAD A ROUTE

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
FROM NEW YORK TO WASHINGTON AND

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
RAN HOME AND TOCK A BATH AND

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
CAME DOWN TO THE MARCH.

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
WHAT A MAN.

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> YOU DESCRIBED A FAMILY

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ATMOSPHERE, SIMILAR OR

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
CONTRASTING TO THE ORIGINAL

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
MARCH?
>> I THINK IT WAS A HUGE

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
CONTRAST TO THE ORIGINAL MARCH.

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WASHINGTON ON THAT PARTICULAR

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
DAY WAS A TENSE CITY.

247
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I GREW UP HERE AND I WAS NINE

248
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
YEARS OLD ON THAT DAY AND

249
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
WASHINGTON WAS A SEGREGATED

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
TOWN.
I CAN REMEMBER TALKING TO MY

251
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
FRIENDS WERE THERE GOING TO BE

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
RIOTS AND PEOPLE COMING TO THE

253
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ADULTS WERE

254
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AFRAID.
IT WAS A REFLECTION OF WHAT THE

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS DOING.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THE POLICE FORCE WAS ON FULL

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ALERT AND ALL HANDS ON DECK AND

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
NATIONAL GUARD WAS CALLED OUGHT

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND FBI DIRECTOR HOOVER HAD

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
INFILM TRAITED THE MOVEMENT AND

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
FOUND COMMUNISM ACTIVITY AND

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
KENNEDY REFUSED TO MEET WITH

263
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THEM BECAUSE OF A FEAR OF

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
IMPOSING ON HIM.

265
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
AND ONE OUT AND THE REST IS

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
HISTORY, HARRIS.

267
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
>> FOR OUR VOWERS.

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
SHOWING YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND

270
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
PUTTING THINGS IN CONTEXT IN THE

271
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
MEMORIES ON THE CHANNEL TODAY.

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> THANK YOU, HARRIS.

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000

FRANCISCO.

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THE WEST IS GETTING EATEN UP.

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
A CITY ROUGHLY 150 MILE PER HOUR

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
AND WHY THESE FLAMES COULD

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
AFFECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
DENOTICES DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

284
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WE REMEMBER HE SAID HE IS

285
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
A HUGGER.

286
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
AND ONE PERSON SAID HE COULD

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
MAKE THE LEGAL TROUBLES FOR

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
FILNER A LOT WORSE.

289
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
STAY CLOSE.

290
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000

THE SAME THINGS YOU DO.

IT'S WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT HER.

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
BUT YOUR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION -

OF DR. KING'S EQUALITY FOR ALL

742
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
AMERICANS.

743
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
>> NOT ONLY MUST WE NOT BE

744
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
SATISFIED BUT FIGHT BACK BOLDLY,

745
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000

VOTE.
>> IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US.

749
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

750
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
NEXT STEP IN SYRIA LOCKS LIKE.

751
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA

752
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
TALKED ABOUT A SHORT TIME AGO

753
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

754
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
THEIR MEETING AFTER A REPORT

755
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
THAT SYRIA'S GOVERNMENT

756
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
AGAINOUSED DEADLY CHEMICAL

757
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
WEAPONS ON HIS CHILDREN.

758
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
WE CAN'T AUTHTENTICATE IT, WE

759
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
CAN'T WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT

760
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
OR ROLE.

761
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
BUT THEY DO SUPPORT REPORTS THAT

762
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
A SUBURB OF DAMASCUS WAS HIT

763
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

764
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE UNITED

765
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
STATES IS TRYING TO CONFIRM THE

766
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
REPORT.

767
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
ONCE THE FACTS ARE CLEAR

768
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE

769
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
A DECISION TO RESPOND.

770
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
WE HAVE A FORMER VICE CHIEF OF

771
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
STATE AND CHAIRMAN.

772
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I COULDN'T SAY THE WORD BUT I

773
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE MEAN.

774
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
THE PICTURES ARE HARD TO VIEW,

775
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
BUT IF WE CAPTAIN DETERMINE,

776
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
GENERAL, WHERE THE TRUTH LIES,

777
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
WHETHER IT IS THE GOVERNMENT OR

778
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
REBELS BLAMED FOR THE CHEMICAL

779
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
WEAPONS, WHAT SHOULD OUR

780
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
MILITARY MOVE BE?

781
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
>> I THINK WE CAN DETERMINE.

782
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
IT THE PRESIDENT SPOKE BY THE

783
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
EXPERIENCE HIS PREDECESSOR OVER

784
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THE WMD IN IRAQ AND LACK OF

785
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
INACCURATE WILL BOW TO THE UN TO

786
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
DO WHAT THEY CAN DO.

787
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
ASSAD CAN PUSH BACK ON THE UN

788
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
THE WAY SADDAM HUSSEIN HUSSEIN

789
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
DID.

790
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THE WAY TO GET THE VERIFICATION

791
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
IS THE DOCTORS AND OTHERS

792
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
TREATING THE PATIENTS KNOW WHAT

793
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
IT IS BY NOW AND ANY DOCTOR

794
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
LOOKING AT THE VIDEOS ALSO

795
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
KNOWS.
WE KNOW IT IS A CHEMICAL ATTACK

796
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
TAKING PLACE.

797
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WHO DID IT IS THE ISSUE THEN?

798
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
WE HAVE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ON

799
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
THE GROUND.

800
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE MISSION

801
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
TO GO AND DO AN INVESTIGATION TO

802
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
GET AT THE ROCKETS THAT WERE

803
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
FIRED AND WHERE WERE THEY FIRED

804
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
FROM AND WITNESSES TO SEE THAT.

805
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
YOU CAN'T FOUR ROCKETS IN

806
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
A NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOT HAVE THE

807
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
PEOPLE PROVIDE TESTIMONY.

808
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
IT IS DISCERNIBLE RATHER

809
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
QUICKLY.

810
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
>> I WANT TO BE ABLE TO READ

811
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
FROM A STATEMENT THAT IS

812
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A FREEDOM FREEDOM IN CANADA AND

813
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
ALSO FROM THE PRIME FREEDOM IN

814
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THE UK.

815
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
IN THIS MEETING WITH THE

816
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
PRESIDENT SHORTLY AFTER PHONE

817
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
CALLS WERE MADE AND OTHER

818
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
COUNTRIES ARE BEING TALKED TO.

819
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
CAN WE PUT WORDS ON THE SCREEN.

820
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
SERIOUS RESPONSE ARE BEING

821
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
TALKED ABOUT THIS FROM THE

822
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
BRITAIN PRIME MINISTER AND

823
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
SIGNIFICANT USE OF CHEMICAL

824
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
WEAPONS WOULD MERIT A SERIOUS

825
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
RESPONSE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL

826
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
COMMUNITY AND BOTH HAVE ASKED

827
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
OFFICIALS TO EXAMINE ALL OF THE

828
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
OPTIONS.

829
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE

830
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
EXACTLY?

831
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
>> IN TERMS OF OUR OPTIONS,

832
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
HARRIS?
>> RIGHT.

833
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
>> CERTAINLY.

834
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
LET'S GET INSIDE OF ASSAD'S

835
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
HEAD.

836
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
HE'S USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS

837
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
AGAINST A NEIGHBORHOOD IN

838
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
EASTERN DAMASCUS BECAUSE THE

839
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
REBELS SEIZED THE NEIGHBORHOOD

840
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
FOR A NUMBER OF WEEKS AND

841
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
DESPITE AIR POWER AND MILITARY

842
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
HE IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN DISLODGING

843
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THEM AND HE USED THE CHEMICAL

844
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
WEAPONS AND HE HAS REASONED

845
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
BEGIN HIS INTRODUCTION OF

846
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
CHEMICAL WEAPON IN THE PAST AND

847
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
NO REACTION TO IT, THAT NUMBER

848
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
ONE, THE UNITED STATES WILL

849
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
PROBABLY NOT ACT AND NUMBER TWO,

850
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
IF THE UNITED STATES DOES ACT, I

851
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
BELIEVE THAT ASSAD'S CALCULATION

852
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
BELIEVES IT WILL BE A STATEMENT

853
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
ATTACK DESIGNED TO RESTORE

854
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
PRESIDENTIAL CREDIBILITY THAN AN

855
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
ATTACK ON A SIGNIFICANT MILITARY

856
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
CAPABILITY THAT IS DESTROYED OR

857
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
REDUCED DRAMATICALLY.

858
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
THAT IS HIS HEAD AND WHAT HE'S

859
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THINKING ABOUT.
>> GENERAL, WHAT I KNOW YOU SAID

860
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
IN THE PAST.

861
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE TONE

862
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A STATEMENT ATTACK AND WHAT YOU

863
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
THINK IS REALLY NECESSARY HERE.

864
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
WHAT IS THAT DIFFER?

865
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
>> IT IS DRAMATIC.

866
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US IS SEIZE

867
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
AND SECOWER CHEMICAL STORAGE.

868
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE INTEGRATED

869
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
AIR DEFENSE TO FLY OUR AIR IN

870
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THERE.

871
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
AND WE WOULD NOT DO THAT UNDER

872
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

873
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
AND SECONDLY WHAT IS AVAILABLE

874
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TO US.

875
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
AND MORE LIKELY IS TO STAND OFF

876
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
IN THE MED TERRANNIAN AND

877
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
SURFACE SHIP SUBMARINE AND USED

878
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
PRECISION GUYEDED AMMUNITION IN

879
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
SYRIA THAT WILL BE OF VALUE TO

880
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
HIM.
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD USE THIS

881
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
OPPORTUNITY NOT TO MAKE

882
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
A STATEMENT ATTACK BUT ELIMINATE

883
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
AND DEGRADE ONE OF HIS MAJOR

884
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
CAPABILITIES AND THE FIRST ONE

885
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
HE VALUES IS AIR POWER.

886
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THIS IS SIX MAJOR AIR FIELDS AND

887
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,000
TAKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOWN AND

888
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
AMMUNITION AND AIRPLANE THEM AND

889
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
CREATOR THE RUN AWAY.

890
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
AND WE HAVE TO DESTROY THE

891
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMAND AND

892
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
CONTROL FOR SOMETIME HE WILL NOT

893
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
BE ABLE TO USE AIR POWER AND

894
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
THAT IS SOMETHING HE IS NOT

895
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
EXPECTING TO HELP HIM FRANKLY.

896
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
>> WHEN WE HAVE GONE DOWN THE

897
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
ROAD BEFORE.

898
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
WE SEE MISSION CREEP.

899
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
WHERE WE GO IN WITH A MISSION

900
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
AND KROEP AWAY AND NEXT THING

901
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
YOU KNOW, WE ARE THERE TWO

902
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
YEARS.
HOW DO WE GET IN AND OUT AND

903
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
WHAT IS THE MISSION?

904
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> THERE IS NO ENTERTAINING THE

905
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
THOUGHT OF BEING ON THE GROUND

906
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
WITH OUR TROOPS IS WHERE YOU GET

907
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
IN MISSION CREEPS AND MORE

908
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
MISSION AND CHALLENGES.

909
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
>> YOU DON'T SEE US GOING IN

910
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
FROM THE GROUND AT ALL.

911
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
JUST FROM THE AIR.
