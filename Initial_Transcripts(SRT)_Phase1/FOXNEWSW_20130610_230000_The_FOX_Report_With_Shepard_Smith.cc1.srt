THE NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S A

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
FEAR I WILL LIVE UNDER FOR

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
HOWEVER LONG THAT HAPPENS

159
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000

SAME INTERVIEW, SHEP, THAT

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
HE BELIEVES ABSOLUTELY THAT

162
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
HE DID NOTHING WRONG, SHEP?

163
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
>> Shepard: HE COULD BE

164
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
BROUGHT BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES.

165
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S

166
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
VERY IFFY.

167
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
>> YEAH.
THERE IS AN EXTRADITION

168
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000

170
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN

171
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
TESTED IN A CASE LIKE THIS.

172
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
AND THERE IS AN EXCEPTION.

173
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IF THE AUTHORITIES IN HONG

174
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
KONG BELIEVE THAT AN

175
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
EXTRADITION REQUEST IS

176
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ALL

177
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OF WHICH ACCORDING TO THE

178
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000

SNOWDEN, LISTEN.

181
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
>> COMING TO HONG KONG IS

182
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
PROBABLY A GOOD DECISION

183
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE

184
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
PROTECTIONS UNDER OUR

POLITICAL OFFENSE

188
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
EXCEPTION, BUT WE ALSO HAVE

189
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR

190
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000

1124
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000

ON THE LIBERAL LEFT YOU

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
HAVE FOLKS LIKE FORMER OHIO

1126
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
CONGRESSMAN DENNIS KUCINICH
WHO HAS RUN FOR PRESIDENT

1127
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
HIMSELF TWICE.

1128
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000

1129
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000

ONCE THE PATRIOT ACT WAS

1137
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000

1138
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000

1139
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000

1141
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
>> WELL, KUCINICH VOTED

1142
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000

1143
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
RAND PAUL WASN'T IN

1148
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
ACT'S REAUTHORIZATION.

1149
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
BEN FRANKLIN SUMMED IT UP

1150
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000

00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
THERE.

1306
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THE PLANE WAS PULLED OFF

1307
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THE SIDE OF THE TARMAC.

1308
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
THEY PUT THE STAIRS UP

1309
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THERE AND EVACUATED ALL 143

1310
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
PASSENGERS.

1311
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO
CONFIRM A TWEET THAT WAS

1312
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
SENT OUT BY SOMEBODY

1313
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
CLAIMING TO BE A PASSENGER

1314
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
SAYING THE PLANE ACTUALLY

1315
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
HAD A MILITARY ESCORT, A

1316
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
FIGHTER JETTERS COURT, IF

1317
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
YOU WILL, IN TO PHOENIX SKY

1318
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
HARBOR AIRPORT.

1319
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
AND YOU SHOULD NOTE, YOU

1320
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
CAN SEE OUR FOX AFFILIATE

1321
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THERE UP IN THE AIR GETTING

1322
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
PICTURES OF THIS.
WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THE

1323
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
WEST END OF SKY HARBOR

1324
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
AIRPORT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN.

1325
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET

1326
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
TRAFFIC REREGULATED AGAIN.

1327
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
FOR THE TIME BEING PEOPLE

1328
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
GOING TO AND FROM THE THE

1329
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
AIRPORT ARE GOING TO HAVE
SOME DIFFICULTIES.

1330
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT

1331
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
THE SOUTHWEST PLANE LANDED

1332
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
WITHOUT INCIDENT AT ALL THE

1333
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
PASSENGERS GOT OUT.

1334
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A VERY

1335
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
CALM EXIT AND NOW WE ARE

1336
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
BEING TOLD BY ONE OF THE

1337
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
LOCAL AFFILIATES THERE THAT

1338
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
THE PASSENGERS ARE INSIDE

1339
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THE TERMINAL SHEP, THEY

1340
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
ARE HAVING TO FILL OUT

1341
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
THESE FBI QUESTIONNAIRES.

1342
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

1343
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
THE QUESTIONS ARE.

1344
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
IT MAY BE STANDARD

1345
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
OPERATING PROCEDURE BECAUSE

1346
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
THEY LEFT ALL OF THEIR

1347
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
BELONGINGS ON BOARD THAT

1348
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
PLANE.

1349
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THE PLANE NOW HAS A

1350
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
SECURITY TEAM THAT IS ON

1351
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
BOARD SWEEPING IT, LOOKING

1352
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
FOR ANY KIND OF SECURITY

1353
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
THREAT AT ALL.

1354
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A THREAT

1355
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
TO BE CALLED IN BY A LOCAL

1356
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEN

1357
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
TRANSFERRED UP TO THE PILOT

1358
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
AND THEN HE KIND OF MAKES

1359
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
THE DECISION ON WHETHER TO

1360
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
LAND.
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

1361
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
JUST HAPPENED IN PHOENIX.

1362
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
WE'RE NOW BEING TOLD THAT

1363
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
ALL THOSE PASSENGERS WILL

1364
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
BE REROUTED TO AUSTIN,

1365
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
TEXAS SOON AS ANOTHER PLANE

1366
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
BECOMES AVAILABLE.

1367
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
THAT PLANE RIGHT THERE

1368
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
WON'T GO ANYWHERE FOR THE

1369
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
TIMENNING BECAUSE IT IS NOW

1370
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
UNDER SURVEILLANCE OR AT

1371
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
LEAST SECURITY WATCH TO
MAKE SURE THAT IT IS

1372
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
TOTALLY CLEAR AND THEY HAVE

1373
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
TO KIND OF DO THE TRIFECTA

1374
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
OF CHECKING THE THREE

1375
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
POINTS, IF YOU WILL,

1376
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
L.A.P.D. FBI, AND THE FAA

1377
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
WILL MAKE SURE EVERYTHING

1378
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
IS FINE WITH THAT PLANE

1379
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
BEFORE IT GOES AIRBORNE

1380
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
AGAIN SHEP.

1381
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
WE WILL KEEP YOU UP TO

1382
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
SPEED ON MORE DEVELOPMENTS

1383
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
AS THEY COME IN WITH THIS

1384
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
EMERGENCY LANDING AT SKY

1385
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
HARBOR AIRPORT.

1386
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
>> Shepard: I WONDERED IF

1387
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT

1388
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
MIGHT INSIDE

1389
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE KEPT IT

1390
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
SO FAR FROM THE TERMINAL

1391
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
YOU WONDER IF THE POLICE IN

1392
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
LOS ANGELES HADN'T

1393
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
SUGGESTED THERE IS

1394
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
SOMETHING ON HERE THAT

1395
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
MIGHT BE OF DANGER TO

1396
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
PEOPLE IN THAT TERMINAL.

1397
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
>> IT'S A GREAT POINT.
I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT POINT.

1398
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
WHY NOT JUST BRING IT UP IF

1399
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
THEY THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS

1400
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO LEAVE

1401
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

1402
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
TARMAC IT'S A VERY GOOD

1403
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
POINT, BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU

1404
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
WOULD BRING IT CLOSER TO

1405
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
THE GATES.
THEY BROUGHT THE BUS OUT TO

1406
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
THE PLANE.
OF COURSE, THEY BROUGHT THE

1407
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
POLICE OUT TO THE PLANE.

1408
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
NONE OF THE PASSENGERS BY

1409
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THE WAY ANY SUSPICIONS

1410
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
RAISED ON ANY OF THEM THEY

1411
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
WERE BROUGHT OFF ORDERLY

1412
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
AND BROUGHT INSIDE THE

1413
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
TERMINAL.
ANOTHER PASSENGER AGAIN,

1414
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
CLAIMING TO BE A PASSENGER

1415
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
TWEETED THAT THERE WAS VERY

1416
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
HIGH SECURITY INSIDE THE

1417
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
TERMINAL.

1418
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
AND NOW AS WE KNOW THOSE

1419
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
PASSENGERS ARE KIND OF

1420
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
BEING GROUND TOGETHER AND

1421
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT IT IS

1422
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING
OVER THE PAST 12 TO 24

1423
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
HOURS OR SO.

1424
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
AGAIN THEY LITTLE

1425
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
INFORMATION COMING FROM

1426
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000

FIRST THOUGH, ASTEROIDS,

1440
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

1441
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
END LIFE AS WE KNOW IT ON

1442
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000

ELECTRICITY.

1726
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
INSTEAD, HE SHOWED THAT

1727
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000

1728
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000

HIS IDEAS HAVE BEEN

00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
PUBLISHED IN 1751 BUT HE

1731
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
HAD LITTLE EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT THEM UNTIL HE TIED

1732
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
A KEY TO A KITE STRING AND

1733
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
LET IT SOAR DURING A NASTY

1734
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000

LIGHTNING ROD AMONG OTHERS

1743
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
