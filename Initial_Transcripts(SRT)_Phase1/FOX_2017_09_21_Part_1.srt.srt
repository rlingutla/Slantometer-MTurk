10
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:39,772
RISKING THEIR LIVES TO TRY TO   
GET THOSE KIDS TO SAFETY.       

11
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:47,346
HURRICANE MARIA ROARING ACROSS  
THE CARIBBEAN NOW LEAVING BEHIND

HOW MUCH THEY LOST WHEN THE     

14
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,588
STORM SCOURED THEIR ISLAND.     
WINDS SO POWERFUL, THEY RIPPED  

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:02,594
CONCRETE BALCONIES OFF OF WALLS 
AND NOW MARIA HEADED FOR THE

17
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,600
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCING BOLD 
NEW MEASURES TARGETING THE      

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,371
NUCLEAR NATION OF NORTH KOREA.  
HE SAYS THEY'RE AIMED AT CUTTING

19
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,374
OFF CASH TO KIM JONG-UN AND HIS 
WEAPONS PROGRAM.                

20
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:20,279
MORE DETAILS EXPECTED IN A LIVE 
EVENT IN JUST MOMENTS.          

21
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:28,120
SO LET'S GET TO IT.             
BREAKING NEWS THIS HOUR.        

22
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,523
FIRST, THE TREASURY SECRETARY   
STEVE MNUCHIN ABOUT TO BRIEF    

23
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,892
REPORTERS ON THE TRUMP          
ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST MOVE TO 

24
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,096
CUT OFF NORTH KOREA'S CASH FLOW.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCING HIS  

25
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,768
NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER HOURS AGO.  
IT GIVES THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT

26
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,003
MORE POWER TO GO AFTER PEOPLE   
THAT DO BUSINESS WITH KIM       

27
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,605
JONG-UN'S GOVERNMENT.           
THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT WILL LEAVE

28
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,642
THE DICTATOR WITH LESS MONEY FOR
HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.            

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,681
>> NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS
AND MISSILE DEVELOPMENT IS A    

30
00:01:55,815 --> 00:02:00,686
GRAVE THREAT TO PEACE AND       
SECURITY IN OUR WORLD AND IT IS 

31
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,958
UNACCEPTABLE THAT OTHERS        
FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THIS        

32
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:11,630
CRIMINAL ROGUE REGIME.          
OUR NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL CUT

33
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:17,569
OFF SOURCES OF REVENUE THAT FUND
NORTH KOREA'S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP

34
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:22,107
THE DEADLIEST WEAPONS TO HUMAN  
KIND.                           

35
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,345
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT MAKING
THE ANNOUNCEMENT WITH THE       

36
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,313
LEADERS OF SOUTH KOREA AND      
JAPAN.                          

37
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,550
THE PRESIDENT HELD SEPARATE     
MEETINGS WITH EACH LEADER.      

38
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:37,156
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRAISING CHINA  
FOR REPORTEDLY TELLING ITS BANKS

39
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,257
TO STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH     
NORTH KOREA.                    

40
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:42,094
THE REUTERS NEWS AGENCY SAID    
THAT MESSAGE CAME FROM CHINA'S  

41
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,696
CENTRAL BANK, WHICH MAKES IT    
SIGNIFICANT.                    

42
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,733
ANALYSTS SAY IT WOULD BE A MAJOR
BLOW TO NORTH KOREA BECAUSE     

43
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,303
CHINA IS ITS CLOSEST ALLY.      
THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO COMES  

44
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,039
JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER     
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST SPEECH  

45
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,209
TO THE U.N.                     
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE UNITED   

46
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,180
STATES WOULD TOTALLY DESTROY    
NORTH KOREA IF IT HAD TO, BUT   

47
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:04,316
HOPEFULLY HE SAID IT WON'T BE   
NECESSARY.                      

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,654
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID KIM   
JONG-UN OR ROCKETMAN, AS HE     

49
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:12,357
CALLS HIM THESE DAYS IS ON A    
SUICIDE ANYTHING.               

50
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,527
NOW NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN       
MINISTER HAS SPOKEN BACK.       

51
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,731
>> IF THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD   
SCARE US WITH A SOUND OF A DOG  

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,801
BARKING, IT'S A SILLY DREAM.    
>> Shepard: SOUND OF A DOG      

53
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,270
BARKING.                        
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS HE    

54
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:30,709
PITY'S PRESIDENT TRUMP'S        
ADVISERS.                       

55
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,277
DESPITE THE RHETORIC, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP DID NOT RULE OUT TALKING  

56
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,215
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.         
>> MR. PRESIDENT, IS DIALOGUE   

57
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:45,791
STILL POSSIBLE WITH NORTH KOREA?
>> Shepard: BREAKING RIGHT NOW, 

58
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,528
THE TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE    
MNUCHIN IS TALKING ABOUT THE NEW

59
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,730
ORDER.                          
LET'S LISTEN LIVE FROM NEW YORK 

60
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,465
CITY.                           
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NEW        

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,069
EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNIFICANTLY   
EXPANDS TREASURIES, AUTHORITIES 

62
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:02,641
TO TARGET THOSE WHO ENABLE THIS 
REGIME'S ECONOMIC ACTIVITY      

63
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:07,012
WHEREVER THEY ARE LOCATED.      
FOR TOO LONG, NORTH KOREA HAS   

64
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,450
EVADED SANCTIONS AND USED THE   
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM  

65
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:17,356
TO FACILITATE FUNDING FOR       
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND 

66
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:23,228
BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS.     
NO BANK IN ANY COUNTRY SHOULD BE

67
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,063
USED TO FACILITATE KIM JONG-UN'S
DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR.           

68
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,434
THIS NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER WILL   
AUTHORIZE TREASURY TO IMPOSE A  

69
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,839
RANGE OF SANCTIONS LIKE         
SUSPENDING U.S. CORRESPONDENT   

70
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:39,711
ACCOUNT ACCESS TO ANY FOREIGN   
BANK THAT KNOWINGLY CONDUCTS OR 

71
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,782
FACILITATES SIGNIFICANT         
TRANSACTIONS TIED TO TRADE WITH 

72
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,485
NORTH KOREA.                    
THESE SANCTIONS WILL BE         

73
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:51,356
FORWARD-LOOKING AND APPLIED TO  
BEHAVIOR THAT OCCURS FOLLOWING  

74
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,893
TODAY WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP      
SIGNED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.     

75
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:59,264
FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
ARE NOW ON NOTICE THAT GOING    

76
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,769
FORWARD, THEY CAN CHOOSE TO DO  
BUSINESS WITH THE UNITED STATES 

77
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,673
OR WITH NORTH KOREA, BUT NOT    
BOTH.                           

78
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,044
THIS NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER ENABLES
TREASURY TO FREEZE ASSETS OF    

79
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:20,352
ANYONE CONDUCTING SIGNIFICANT   
TRADE IN GOODS, SERVICES OR     

80
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,820
TECHNOLOGY WITH NORTH KOREA.    
IT ALSO ALLOWS TO US FREEZE     

81
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:28,994
ASSETS OF ACTORS SUPPORTING     
NORTH KOREA'S TEXTILE, FISHING, 

82
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,531
AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES.      
WE CALL ON ALL COUNTRIES AROUND 

83
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,835
THE WORLD TO JOIN US BY CUTTING 
OFF ALL TRIED AND FINANCIAL TIES

84
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:43,041
TO NORTH KOREA IN ORDER TO      
ACHIEVE A DE-NUCLEARIZED KOREAN 

85
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:48,213
PENINSULA.                      
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP STATED IN HIS

86
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:54,219
SPEECH TO THE U.N., IT'S TIME   
FOR ALL NATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER

87
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,256
TO ISOLATE KIM JONG-UN'S REGIME 
UNTIL IT CEASES ITS HOSTILE     

88
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,827
BEHAVIOR.                       
WE WILL WORK WITH OUR ALLIES AND

89
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,629
PARTNERS TO STOP FROM USING THE 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO      

90
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:09,868
FURTHER KIM'S RECKLESS BEHAVIOR.
THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO   

91
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:15,507
TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS.           
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS WILL

92
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,212
AFFECT -- WHAT KIND OF          
DISCUSSIONS YOU AND YOUR COUNTER

93
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,647
PARTS HAVE HAD ABOUT THIS?      
>> LET ME COMMENT.              

94
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:27,219
I HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE         
CONVERSATION EARLY THIS MORNING 

95
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,724
WITH GOVERNOR JOE AT THE PBOC,  
THE PEOPLE'S BANK OF CHINA AND  

96
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,727
HOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK         
TOGETHER.                       

97
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:39,464
THIS ACTION IS DIRECTED AT      
EVERYONE.                       

98
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,668
IT'S IN NO WAY DIRECTED AT      
CHINA.                          

99
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,505
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING      
CLOSELY WITH THEM.              

100
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,109
>> MR. SECRETARY, CAN I READ A  
QUICK SECTION OF THE E.O.?      

101
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,379
NO AIRCRAFT IN WHICH A FOREIGN  
PERSON HAS AN INTERESTED HAS    

102
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,283
LANDED AT A PLACE IN NORTH      
KOREA, MAY LAND IN THE UNITED   

103
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,620
STATES AFTER DEPARTURE FROM     
NORTH KOREA.                    

104
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:07,659
THEN SIMILAR APPLICATIONS TO    
SHIPS.                          

105
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,562
ANY IDEA ON HOW MANY SHIPS OR   
AIRCRAFT WOULD BE HAVE BEEN     

106
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,099
AFFECTED IN PICK A YEAR?        
SO WE CAN GET A SENSE OF THE    

107
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,102
SCALE OF THE IMPACT.            
>> AGAIN, ANOTHER IMPORTANT     

108
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,840
ASPECT OF THE E.O. BESIDES FOR  
US BEING ABLE TO BLOCK FINANCIAL

109
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,875
TRANSACTIONS.                   
WE'LL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE     

110
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,713
COAST GUARD AND OTHERS ON THIS. 
I'M NOT PREPARED TO GIVE YOU A  

111
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,582
NUMBER.                         
IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT.          

112
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:35,754
FURTHER, WE CAN PUT ACTIONS     
AGAINST PORTS AS WELL.          

113
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,723
>> A COUPLE QUESTIONS.          
FIRST ONE, WHY WILL THIS ROUND  

114
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,193
OF SANCTIONS WORK WHEN OTHERS   
HAVE FAILED?                    

115
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:45,130
>> AGAIN, LET ME BE CLEAR.      
I DON'T THINK OTHER SANCTIONS   

116
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,933
HAVE FAILED.                    
THESE SANCTIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

117
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,903
NOT ONLY DOES IT ALLOW US TO    
SANCTION INDIVIDUALS OR         

118
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,342
ENTITIES, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO   
FREEZE OR BLOCK ANY TRANSACTIONS

119
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:04,316
WITH ANY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT      

120
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,351
FACILITATES ANY TRANSACTIONS    
WITH THE BLOCKED PERSON.        

121
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:14,292
>> DO THESE SANCTIONS INCLUDED A
PLAN TO TARGET NORTH KOREAN     

122
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,429
BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD?    
>> YES, IT DOES.                

123
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:22,100
>> ANY FUTURE SANCTIONS?        
>> I WON'T COMMENT ON FUTURE    

124
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,069
SANCTIONS.                      
WE'LL REVIEW ALL OPTIONS.       

125
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,138
>> DOES THIS REPRESENT A        
REJECTION OR A MOVING PATH TO   

126
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,642
THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL?      
>> NO, I DON'T THINK IN ANY WAY.

127
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:35,881
WE APPRECIATE THE U.N. SECURITY 
COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND THE      

128
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:41,653
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TO THAT.      
THIS GOES BEYOND IT.            

129
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:46,224
AS I'VE MENTIONED, THIS ALLOWS  
US TO BLOCK ANY FINANCIAL       

130
00:08:46,359 --> 00:09:01,306
INSTITUTION THAT DOESN'T        
FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE U.N.      

131
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,274
SANCTIONS OR ADDITIONAL         
SANCTIONS.                      

132
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,508
>> WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE   
DESIGNATIONS --                 

133
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,010
>> WE'LL DO DESIGNATIONS ON A   
ROLLING BASIS.                  

134
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:09,014
THIS STARTS TODAY.              
IT'S FORWARD LOOKING, NOT       

135
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,083
BACKWARDS LOOKING.              
>> CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT YOUR  

136
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,120
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CENTRAL    
BANK OF CHINA?                  

137
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,924
WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND --       
>> AGAIN, THOSE CONVERSATIONS   

138
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,460
ARE CONFIDENTIAL.               
AS I SAID, I HAD A VERY         

139
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,163
PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH    
THEM THIS MORNING.              

140
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:31,202
>> PIGGYBACKING ON THAT, THE    
TIMELINE, HAS THERE BEEN        

141
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,105
PREVIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE  
BANK OF CHINA?                  

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,008
>> NO, THERE WERE NO PREVIOUS   
DISCUSSIONS.                    

143
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,344
THE FIRST TIME WE DISCUSSED IT  
WAS THIS MORNING.               

144
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,948
I CALLED THEM TO ALERT THEM OF  
THIS IN ADVANCE GIVEN THEIR     

145
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,419
CLOSE COOPERATION WITH US.      
>> THANK YOU.                   

146
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:53,325
SO I WANT TO ASK PART OF THE    
SAME QUESTION.                  

147
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,726
THAT CHINA HAD GIVEN SOME       
INDICATION 1 1/2 WEEKS AGO OF   

148
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,995
SOME ACTIONS.                   
WHAT DID THEY TODAY IS SEPARATE 

149
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,030
FROM WHAT THEY INDICATED        
EARLIER --                      

150
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,667
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE        
COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT THEY DID    

151
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,103
EARLIER.                        
WHAT THEY DID TODAY IS I ASSUME 

152
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,039
AS A RESULT OF OUR CONVERSATION.
>> CAN I ASK --                 

153
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,509
>> LET'S COME BACK TO YOU SO WE 
CAN GET OTHER PEOPLE.           

154
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,780
>> CAN YOU -- DO YOU BELIEVE    
THAT CHINA'S ACTIONS TODAY      

155
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:22,153
REDUCE THE NEED FOR FURTHER     
SECONDARY SANCTIONS ON CHINESE  

156
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,422
ENTITIES --                     
>> I JUST COMMENTED WE LOOK     

157
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,093
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS 
WELL AS ALL OF OUR PARTNERS.    

158
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:32,697
WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS 
THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES THE  

159
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:37,636
TREASURY HAS.                   
>> CAN YOU PUT THIS IN THE      

160
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,338
CONTEXT OF THE PRESIDENT'S      
SPEECH EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN 

161
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:53,652
HE TALKED ABOUT MORE MILITARY   
ACTION?                         

162
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,053
HOW DO THESE THINGS WORK        
TOGETHER AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT 

163
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,488
NORTH KOREA TO DO IN RESPONSE?  
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON  

164
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,956
WHAT I EXPECT NORTH KOREA TO DO.
OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'VE SAID IS THE

165
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,357
OBJECTIVE, FOR THEM TO STOP     
THEIR MISSILE TESTS AND GIVE UP 

166
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,725
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.          
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN 

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,461
                                
IN THE WORKS FOR A WHILE.       

168
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,065
I ALLUDED TO THIS ABOUT TWO     
WEEKS AGO, THAT I HAD BEEN      

169
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,601
DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE        
PRESIDENT AND THIS IS ALL PART  

170
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:15,707
OF THE PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY AT  
THE U.N. THIS WEEK.             

171
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,710
>> SECRETARY TILLERSON SAID IT  
TOOK AWHILE FOR THE LAST ROUND  

172
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,213
OF SANCTIONS TO HAVE AN IMPACT  
OR FOR NORTH KOREA TO BE ABLE TO

173
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,417
FEEL THEM IS.                   
THERE A TIMELINE THAT YOU'RE    

174
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,887
LOOKING AT IN WHICH CASE --     
>> AGAIN, THERE'S NO TIME LINE. 

175
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:33,558
THIS IS FORWARD ACTION ON THIS. 
AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE

176
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,162
HOPE THAT THERE'S VOLUNTARY     
COOPERATION, BUT TO THE EXTENT  

177
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:42,901
THAT WE HAVE TO CUT OFF BANKS   
FROM THE BANKING SYSTEM IN THE  

178
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,703
UNITED STATES, WHICH OBVIOUSLY  
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT, WE NOW    

179
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:49,274
HAVE THOSE TOOLS TO DO THAT.    
>> DO YOU RECALL ANY OTHER      

180
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:52,377
COUNTRIES, CENTRAL BANKS --     
>> I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY    

181
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,147
COMMENTS ON CONFIDENTIAL        
DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER          

182
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,316
COUNTRIES.                      
AGAIN, I'M CONFIRMING THAT I DID

183
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:02,153
SPEAK TO THEM THIS MORNING.     
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON     

184
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:09,561
OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE      
CONFIDENTIAL.                   

185
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:15,934
>> THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THANKED
PRESIDENT XI FOR HIS ACTIONS.   

186
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,903
DO YOU THINK THEY WERE ENOUGH?  
DID YOU CALL ON RUSSIA --       

187
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:23,007
>> AGAIN, WE'LL CALL ON RUSSIA  
TO DO MORE.                     

188
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:27,112
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT XI
HAVE HAD PRODUCTIVE             

189
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,583
CONVERSATIONS AND WE APPRECIATE 
THE WAY THEY'RE WORKING WITH US.

190
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:37,222
I'M GOING TO TAKE ONE MORE.     
>> I'D FOLLOW UP ON MY INITIAL  

191
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,389
QUESTION.                       
YOU SAID THIS WAS NOT TARGETED  

192
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,893
AT CHINA SPECIFICALLY.          
BUT CHINA IS THE LARGEST TRADING

193
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,996
PARTNER WITH NORTH KOREA.       
SO CAN YOU SPELL OUT HOW THIS   

194
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:49,000
WILL AFFECT THEM AND HOW IT WILL
AFFECT THE U.S. AND THEIR       

195
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,835
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA WITH    
REGARD TO NORTH KOREA?          

196
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,206
>> AS I EMPHASIZED EARLIER, THIS
IS TARGETED AT NORTH KOREA AND  

197
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,610
ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO DO TRADE  
OR BUSINESS WITH THEM.          

198
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:02,046
WE APPRECIATE THE RELATIONSHIP  
WITH CHINA AND LOOK FORWARD TO  

199
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:07,285
WORKING WITH THEM.              
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED, IS     
THERE STILL ROOM FOR DIALOGUE?  

210
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,690
HE SAID WHY NOT.

IT MEANS FREEZING IT AND ROLLING

215
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,851
IT BACK TO NOTHING.             
ONE OF THE BIG DEVELOPMENTS IS  

216
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,486
THE FACT THAT CHINA FINALLY     
STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE.        

217
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:20,692

PRESIDENT TRUMP.                

238
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,744
ERDOGAN, A VERY COMPLICATED     
RELATIONSHIP.                   

239
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,815
LET'S LISTEN.                   
>> WE ARE GETTING TOGETHER WITH 

240
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:29,087
YOU AS A DELEGATION AND WE WILL 
COME BACK TO BILATERAL          

241
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,423
MEETINGS-WE'LL ASSESS THE       
CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN   

242
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,493
THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY AND
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS 

243
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,061
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AS A      
WHOLE.                          

244
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,131
I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK
YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.       

245
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,033
THANK YOU.                      
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,         

246
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,570
MR. PRESIDENT.                  
WE APPRECIATE IT.               

247
00:16:45,704 --> 00:17:04,155
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.        
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN IS THE   

248
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:09,394
LAST TIME YOU SPOKE WITH PAUL   
MANAFORT.                       

249
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,795
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.        
>> Shepard: A DIFFICULT SET OF  

250
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,664
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE WITH THE     
PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN.         

251
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,236
HE'S JAILED PEOPLE BY THE       
THOUSANDS FOR SPEAKING OUT      

252
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,508
AGAINST HIS GOVERNMENT.         
HE'S JAILED MORE THAN 120       

253
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,377
JOURNALISTS, DENOUNCED AROUND   
THE WORLD.                      

254
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,914
THERE'S A WIDELY-HELD BELIEF    
THAT HE'S TURNING WHAT APPEARED 

255
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,653
TO BE A COUNTRY ON THE WAY TO   
DEMOCRATIZATION INTO SOMETHING  

256
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,991
AKIN TO A DICTATORSHIP.         
>> THE PROBLEM HERE, HE'S A NATO

257
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:44,829
MEMBER AND TURKEY IS THE GATEWAY
FROM TURKEY TO THE MIDDLE EAST. 

258
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,198
YOU SAID IT'S A COMPLICATED     
RELATIONSHIP.                   

259
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,668
A DIPLOMATIC WAY OF PUTTING UP. 
>> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU

260
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,571
RESOLVE IT.                     
SEEING HIM UP THERE, AS A       

261
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,340
JOURNALIST IT AFFECTS YOU THE   
SAME WAY IT DOES ME.            

262
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:03,981
IT'S A SCARY PROPOSITION WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN TURKEY, IT'S       

263
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,283
AGAINST EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN
THE UNITED STATES.              

264
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,417
>> IT IS.                       
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PRESIDENT,  

265
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,253
THIS NATION NEEDS TO HAVE A     
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAUSE OF

266
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,457
WHERE HIS COUNTRY IS AND WHERE  
THEY REPRESENT.                 

267
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,326
IT'S ONE OF THOSE LINES THAT YOU
HAVE TO HOLD YOUR NOSE TO DEAL  

268
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,161
WITH THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO DEAL
WITH.                           

269
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,564
THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE IN THIS
POINT.                          

270
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:25,002
BACK TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT    
PRIOR TO GOING HERE, CHINA.     

271
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,306
THE MOVE THAT CHINA MADE IN     
TERMS OF THE CENTRAL BANK       

272
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:35,513
TELLING CHINESE BANKS, DON'T DO 
ANY BUSINESS WITH NORTH KOREA   

273
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,415
ANYMORE, THAT'S BIG.            
THE PRESIDENT SAID CHINA NEEDS  

274
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,419
TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE.        
WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT 

275
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,322
LAST THURSDAY, I ASKED HIM ABOUT
NORTH KOREA AND CHINA.          

276
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,924
HE SAID THEY'RE PLANNING SOME   
MOVES WITH CHINA HE COULDN'T    

277
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,427
TELL US ABOUT.                  
IT WOULD CLEARLY SEEM THIS IS   

278
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:55,032
IT.                             
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE

279
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,501
THIS DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT       
CHINA'S COOPERATION AND CHINA   

280
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,238
TAKING STRINGENT MEASURES.      
ALWAYS LOTS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR

281
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,741
CHEATING, BUT MAYBE THIS IS A   
STEP DOWN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  

282
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,578
>> Shepard: CHINA HAS BEEN CLEAR
TO SAY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE,  

283
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,315
WE'VE DONE WHAT WE CAN DO.      
THE WORLD IS PUSHING US.        

284
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,585
>> THE CHINESE CAN DO MORE THAN 
THEY'VE BEEN DOING.             

285
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,256
>> Shepard: OBVIOUSLY.          
I WONDER IF THIS IS A CHANGE.   

286
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,558
>> IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A      
CHANGE.                         

287
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,460
ALTHOUGH THERE'S ROOM FOR       
CHEATING.                       

288
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:27,265
IS THIS CHINA JUST SAYING THIS  
IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO OR IS 

289
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:32,103
THIS CHINA DOING WHAT THEY SAY  
THEY'RE GOING TO DO?            

290
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:36,274
>> Shepard: THE U.S.,           
SANCTIONING BANKS, THIS IS A    

291
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,477
WIDE EXPANSION?                 
>> IT BROADENS THE TARGET       

292
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,346
ENVIRONMENT.                    
THERE WAS ONE CHINESE BANK BEING

293
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,881
SANCTIONED.                     
THIS LAST TARGETED INDIVIDUALS  

294
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:49,887
MORE THAN ANYTHING.             
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT

295
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,389
NORTH KOREA AND GOING TO TARGET 
THE NORTH KOREAN TEXTILE        

296
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,825
INDUSTRY AND THE FISHING        
INDUSTRY.                       

297
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,430
OTHER SMALLER INDUSTRIES THAT   
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE      

298
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:04,001
DEFENSE MINISTRY, THIS IS TRYING
TO PUT A CHOKE HOLD ON NORTH    

299
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,903
KOREA.                          
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE       

300
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,808
DOESN'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR      
ANYTHING SHORT OF               

301
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,744
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE         
PENINSULA.                      

302
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:18,015
THERE COULD BE WIGGLE ROOM      
THERE.                          

303
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,753
I DON'T THINK NORTH KOREA WOULD 
FREEZE IT UP.                   

304
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,323
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN        
ROBERTS.                        

305
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,327
GORDON CHANG WROTE THE BOOK ON  
NORTH KOREA.                    

306
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,364
HE'S OUR GUEST LIVE NEXT.       
WILL THIS WORK?                 

307
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,265
THAT'S NEXT.                    

308

Approaching Medicare            
eligibility?                    

332
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,571
Don't put off checking out your 
Medicare options until 65.      

333
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,240
Now is a good time to get the   
ball rolling.                   

334
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,242
Medicare only covers about      
eighty percent of               

335
00:22:58,277 --> 00:22:59,910
Part B medical costs.           

336
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,712
The rest is up to you.          

337
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:04,815
That's where AARP Medicare      
Supplement Insurance Plans      

338
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:08,018
insured by UnitedHealthcare     
Insurance Company come in.      

339
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,755
Like all standardized Medicare  
supplement insurance plans,     

340
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,191
they could help save you in     
out-of-pocket medical costs.    

341
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:17,528
Taking informed steps really    
makes a difference later.

00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:57,601
>> Shepard: NEW SANCTIONS ON    
NORTH KOREA WITH CHINESE HELP.  

353
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:02,473
LET'S GO TO GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR
OF "NUCLEAR SHOW DOWN: NORTH    

354
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,809
KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD."      
GORDON, THANK YOU.              

355
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,479
>> THANKS, SHEP.                
>> Shepard: A BIT OF A MUTED    

356
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,581
RESPONSE.                       
SOMETHING ABOUT DOGS BARKING.   

357
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,852
YOUR THOUGHTS?                  
>> YEAH, THIS IS EXTREMELY      

358
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,921
SIGNIFICANT.                    
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AND    

359
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:25,329
WHAT TREASURY SECRETARY MNUCHIN 
IS NOW DOING IS SHUTTING OFF THE

360
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,397
MONEY TO THE NORTH KOREAN       
REGIME.                         

361
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,932
EVERY BANK GETS A FREE PASS FOR 
WHAT THEY DID IN THE PAST WITH  

362
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,168
THEIR RELATIONS WITH PYONGYANG. 
WHAT MNUCHIN SAID, LOOK, GOING  

363
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,840
FORWARD, IF A BANK VIOLATES U.S.
LAW, IT WILL BE DESIGNATED.     

364
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,610
YOU HEARD THAT WORD             
"DESIGNATION" IN THE PRESS      

365
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,780
CONFERENCE.                     
THAT'S UNDER 311 OF THE PATRIOT 

366
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,050
ACT.                            
IF A BANK IS SO DESIGNATED, IT'S

367
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,352
CUT OFF FROM THE GLOBAL         
FINANCIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT CAN 

368
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,921
NO LONGER TRANSACT BUSINESS IN  
DOLLARS.                        

369
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,191
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS NOW WILL 
DO IS TRY TO TRANSACT BUSINESS  

370
00:24:54,326 --> 00:25:02,099
IN OTHER CURRENCIES, WHAT THE   
UNITED STATES IS GO AROUND THE  

371
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,202
WORLD AND MAKE SURE THEY CAN'T  
USE OTHER CURRENCIES.           

372
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,071
>> Shepard: THE NORTH KOREANS   
DIDN'T SAY MUCH.                

373
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,840
THEY WAIT AWHILE.               
YOU WONDER IF THEY WON'T WAIT   

374
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,611
UNTIL ALL OF THESE WORLD LEADERS
GO BACK TO THEIR HOMES.         

375
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:20,351
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.              
THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO DO  

376
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:28,759
IS ENGAGE IN A PROVOCATION THAT 
GIVES UP TRUMP TO TALK TO OTHER 

377
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:32,596
WORLD LEADERS.                  
I EXPECT THE NORTH KOREANS TO BE

378
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:38,435
QUIET A WORK OR SO.             
YOU HEARD WHAT NORTH KOREA SAY  

379
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,840
ABOUT THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT    
TRUMP, LIKE A DOG BARKING.      

380
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:49,914
THEY'RE SEEING THAT THE U.S. CAN
EXERT PRESSURE ON THEIR PRIMARY 

381
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,817
BACKER.                         
NORTH KOREA IS IN A WORLD OF    

382
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:58,055
HURT.                           
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS REPORTS

383
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,725
THE BIG PICTURE IS TO GET NORTH 
KOREANS TO THE NEGOTIATING      

384
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,893
TABLE.                          
DOES THIS HELP?                 

385
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,163
>> OBVIOUSLY NEGOTIATIONS ARE   
THE PREFERRED WAY OF SOLVING    

386
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,033
THIS.                           
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD START THE   

387
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:14,872
DISCUSSIONS ONLY WHEN THE NORTH 
KOREANS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY    

388
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,307
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DISARM.   
IF WE START THEM EARLIER THAN   

389
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,875
THAT, THEY WILL USE THEM TO     
DELAY TO PERFECT THEIR MISSILES 

390
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,878
AND NUKES.                      
THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN THE       

391
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,813
SIX-PARTY TALKS IN THE          
ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W.     

392
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,982
BUSH.                           
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN. 

393
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:28,652
THE PRESIDENT, OUR PRESIDENT    
UNDERSTANDS THAT, AND I THINK   

394
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,089
WE'LL SEE MAXIMUM PRESSURE,     
MAXIMUM ENGAGEMENT, WHICH IS THE

395
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:36,226
BUZZ PHRASE IN WASHINGTON.      
IT MIGHT WORK THIS TIME IF THE  

396
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,530
ADMINISTRATION IS ABSOLUTELY    
DETERMINED TO CARRY FORWARD ON  

397
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,298
THIS.                           
>> Shepard: SHORT ON TIME.      

398
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,835
LESS LIKELY OR MORE LIKELY TO   
GET ANOTHER MISSILE TEST?       

399
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,438
>> THERE WILL BE ANOTHER MISSILE
TEST.                           

400
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:50,474
THE NORTH KOREANS NEED TO       
IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES.     

401
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,377
THEY WANT A DETERRENT.          
THEY WANT TO SELL THESE THINGS  

402
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,113
TO THE IRANIANS, THIS IS WHERE  
WE COME IN.                     

403
00:26:56,247 --> 00:27:01,685
THE IRANIANS PAY THE NORTH      
KOREANS $2 BILLION TO $3 BILLION

404
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,993
A YEAR.                         
WHAT MNUCHIN IS DOING WILL CUT  

405
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,227
OFF THAT FLOW OF CASH IF HE'S   
SUCCESSFUL.                     

406
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,797
WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED THAT THE
NORTH KOREANS DON'T SWITCH TO   

407
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:18,235
OTHER CURRENCIES.               
THE ONE CURRENCY WE CAN'T       

408
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,974
CONTROL IS THE CHINESE CURRENCY.
>> GORDON CHANG FROM WASHINGTON.

409
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,910
THANK YOU.                      
>> THANK YOU, SHEPARD.          

410
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,980
>> Shepard: THERE'S BREAKING    
NEWS FROM THE EARTHQUAKE IN     

411
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,683
MEXICO.                         
MOMENTS AGO, WORD THAT THERE ARE

412
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,719
NO CHILDREN STILL ALIVE IN THAT 
SCHOOL THAT COLLAPSED THERE     

413
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,955
AFTER TUESDAY'S POWERFUL        
EARTHQUAKE.                     

414
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,625
THAT CAME FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY.
EARLIER REPORTS HAD INDICATED   

415
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,862
THAT UP TO SIX CHILDREN MIGHT BE
ALIVE IN THE RUBBLE.            

416
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:49,633
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS QUOTING AN 
OFFICIAL FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY  

417
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,903
SAYS THERE MAY STILL BE AN ADULT
ALIVE IN THE WRECKAGE.          

418
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,807
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS, BUT NO   
CHILDREN.                       

419
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:03,480
THE PILE OF WRECKAGE SHIFTED    
DRAMATICALLY THIS MORNING.      

420
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,882
WORKERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PROP
IT UP WITH IRON BEAMS.          

421
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,918
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SETS OF  
HUMAN REMAINS MAY BE UNDERNEATH.

422

A SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM FROM   
LOS ANGELES IN MEXICO TO HELP, A

424
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,728
THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO MEXICO   
SAYS THEY HAVE EXPERTS AND TONS 

425
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,331
OF EQUIPMENT.                   
MEXICAN OFFICIALS SAY SO FAR THE

426
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,536
QUAKE HAS KILLED 245 PEOPLE AND 
INJURED MORE THAN 2,000.        

427
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,707
OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT,        
JONATHAN HUNT IS LIVE AT THE    

428
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,108
SCHOOL.                         
JONATHAN?                       

429
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,411
>> SHEP, IT'S A VERY TENSE SCENE
HERE AT THE SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.   

430
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,515
THE SCHOOL IS ABOUT 50 YARDS OR 
SO BEHIND ME.                   

431
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,652
IT'S A HIVE OF ACTIVITY AND     
REMAINS SO.                     

432
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,154
RUBBLE BEING BROUGHT OUT FROM   
THE SCENE, LOADED ON TO THE     

433
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:47,725
TRUCKS YOU CAN SEE HERE.        
AS WE COME LEFT AND DOWN A BIT, 

434
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:51,895
YOU CAN SEE THE SUPPLY TENTS.   
THESE ARE SET UP TO SUPPORT THE 

435
00:28:52,030 --> 00:29:01,572
RESCUE WORKERS IN THEIR HUNDREDS
IF NOT THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEER   

436
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,073
CIVILIANS DOING WHAT THEY CAN DO
HELP IN THIS VERY INTENSE RESCUE

437
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,274
EFFORT, SHEP.                   
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING CONFLICTING

438
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,778
REPORTS ALL DAY AS YOU JUST     
POINTED OUT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

439
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,849
THERE MAY BE ANY SURVIVORS      
UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE OF THAT   

440
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,185
SCHOOL AND WHETHER, IF THERE    
ARE, THEY ARE CHILDREN OR       

441
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,388
ADULTS.                         
THE LATEST AS YOU SAID FROM THE 

442
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,492
ASSOCIATED PRESS, HEARING FROM  
THE MEXICAN NAVY, WHICH IS ONE  

443
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,529
OF THE INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED IN 
THE RESCUE EFFORT, THAT THEY DO 

444
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:28,132
NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY       
SURVIVING CHILDREN.             

445
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,034
THEY DO BELIEVE THERE MAY BE AN 
ADULT ALIVE.                    

446
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:36,106
WE HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM OUR 
SOURCES CLOSER IN TO THE SCHOOL 

447
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:42,513
THAT A HEAT-SEEKING CAMERA HAS  
PICKED UP A SIGNAL THAT MAY     

448
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,581
INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE      
SOMEBODY ALIVE.                 

449
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:52,790
I WANT TO CAUTION EVEN WITH THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS HEARING THIS   

450
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,324
FROM THE MEXICAN NAVY, THERE'S  
SO MANY CONFLICTING REPORTS     

451
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,594
FLOATING AROUND WHO MAY OR MAY  
NOT BE ALIVE UNDERNEATH THAT    

452
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,996
RUBBLE.                         
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TAKE ANYTHING 

453
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,197
WITH ANY CERTA
