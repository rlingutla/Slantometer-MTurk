REPRESSIVE REGIME EVER

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
SINCE 1997.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
TONIGHT, RED LINE CROSSED.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT DID

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
AGAINST OPPOSITION
FIGHTERS.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
NOW, THE WHITE HOUSE

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
CONSIDERING A MILITARY

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
MOVE.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
PLUS, IT COULD HAVE

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
PREVENTED THE ATTACKS OF

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
9/11.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
THE FBI DIRECTOR ON THE

SECRET SURVEILLANCE

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
PROGRAM.

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
HE SAYS TRACKING PHONE

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
RECORDS COULD HAVE HELPED

26
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THEM FIND ONE OF THE

27
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
HIJACKERS.

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
TELEPHONE NUMBER BUT THEY

30
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000

CALLING INTO THAT

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
PARTICULAR SAFE HOUSE.

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000

34
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
LAWMAKERS ARE NOT

35
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
CONVINCED.

36
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
>> I AM NOT PERSUADED THAT

37
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THAT THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
COLLECT EVERY CALL.

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
>> Shepard: WHAT ABOUT THE

40
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
GUY WHO LEAKED EVERYTHING.

41
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
>> HE IS THE SUBJECT OF AN

42
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
ONGOING CRIMINAL

43
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000

SURVEILLANCE, SECURITY, AND
A WHOLE LOT OF SECRETS.

46
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
>> Shepard: SHE WAS PERHAPS

47
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
DAYS FROM DEATH WHEN THE

48
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
CALL CAME IN.

49
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THEY HAD FOUND A LUNG DONOR

50
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
AND THE TRANSPLANT WAS GOOD

51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
TO GO.

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>> THE SURGERY WAS VERY

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

54
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
>> Shepard: TONIGHT, AN
UPDATE ON THE BRAVE GIRL

55
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WHO IS FINALLY BREATHING A

56
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
BIT EASIER.

57
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
[WHOO!

58
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
>> Shepard: BUT FIRST FROM

59
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
FOX THIS THURSDAY NIGHT.

60
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS U.S.

61
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
INTELLIGENCE HAS HIGH

62
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN

63
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
PRESIDENT BASHAR ASSAD HAS

64
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN
THAT COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR.

65
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS

66
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THE COUNTRY WILL NOW

67
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
PROVIDE MILITARY SUPPORT TO

68
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
SOME REBEL FIGHTERS.

69
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
ANALYSTS POINT OUT THAT

70
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN

71
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WEAPONS.

72
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
AND THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS NOT YET

73
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
MADE A DECISION ABOUT

74
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ENFORCING A NO-FLY ZONE

75
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
OVER SYRIA.

76
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
A FULL NO-FLY ZONE WOULD

77
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
COST AN ESTIMATED

78
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
$50 MILLION A DAY:  THE

79
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
UNITED NATIONS NOW REPORTS

80
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
MORE THAN 90,000 PEOPLE

81
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
HAVE DIED SINCE THE

82
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
UPRISING BEGAN IN SYRIA

83
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO.

84
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
BUT THE PRESIDENT SAID THE

85
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS

86
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
WOULD BE A GAME CHANGER.

87
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
>> A RED LINE FOR US IS WE

88
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
START SEEING A WHOLE BUNCH

89
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS MOVING

90
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
AROUND OR BEING UTILIZED.

91
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
THAT WOULD CHANGE MY

92
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
CALCULUS.

93
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
>> Shepard: TONIGHT, THE
WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT

94
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
CALCULUS HAS CHANGED.

95
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
NOW THE U.S. WILL TALK TO

96
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
CONGRESS AND U.S. ALLIES

97
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
ABOUT AMERICA'S NEXT MOVE.

98
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON

99
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
FOX TOP STORY.

100
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
ED, WE ARE TO BELIEVE AFTER

101
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
TWO YEARS OF A CIVIL WAR

102
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THERE IS NO PLAN FOR WHAT

103
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TO DO NEXT.

104
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
>> SHEP THAT IS WHAT IS SO

105
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
CONFUSING ABOUT THIS

106
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE WHITE

107
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
HOUSE.

108
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ONE OF THEIR TOP AIDES HERE

109
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
BEN RHODES ANNOUNCED JUST A

110
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
SHORT TIME AGO THAT THIS

111
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
DOES CHANGE THE CALCULUS

112
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THIS USE OF CHEMICAL

113
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WEAPONS.

114
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
IT IS A GAME CHANGER.

115
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
CROSS THE RED LIGHT

116
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WHATEVER WORDS YOU WANT TO

117
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
USE THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

118
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
USED BEFORE BUT THEN NOT

119
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
DIRECTLY SAY THAT THE U.S.

120
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
IS GOING TO HARM ARM THE

121
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
SYRIAN RENELS.

122
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
NOT CLEAR WHAT ACTION WILL

123
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
BE TAKEN.
WILL THE U.S. HELP ONE OF

124
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OUR ALLIES ARM THEM SO WE

125
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
ARE NOT DIRECTLY ARMING

126
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THEM.
THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS

127
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WE HAVE TO ANSWER IN THE

128
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
DAYS AHEAD.

129
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ANNOUNCEMENT FALLS SHORT OF

130
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
PRESIDENT'S CRITICS NOT

131
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
JUST ON THE RIGHT LIKE JOHN

132
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
MCCAIN BUT BILL CLINTON WHO

133
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
WE ARE LEARNING TODAY ON

134
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
TUESDAY NIGHT AT A PRIVATE

135
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
EVENT WITH JOHN MCCAIN

136
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
CRITICIZED THE OBAMA

137
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
ADMINISTRATION POLICY

138
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SUGGESTING IT WAS TOO SLOW

139
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THOUGH JAY CARNEY TODAY

140
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
TRIED TO BRUSH OFF THAT

141
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
CRITICISM.

142
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

143
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
EXPERTISE IN THE MATTER

144
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
BOTH OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT

145
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
AND IN CONGRESS AND INSIDE

146
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
OF GOVERNMENT HAVE

147
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
PERSPECTIVES TO ADD.

148
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
AND OPINIONS TO CONTRIBUTE.

149
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AND AANALYSIS TO PROVIDE.

150
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AND THE PRESIDENT WELCOMES

151
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
ALL OF THAT.

152
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
IN THE END, OF COURSE, HE

153
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
AND HIS TEAM HAVE TO MAKE

154
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THE DECISIONS THAT THEY

155
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
BELIEVE ARE IN THE BEST

156
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
INTEREST OF THE UNITED

157
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
STATES AND THE AMERICAN

158
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
PEOPLE.

159
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
>> SO STILL WAITING ON

160
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
WHETHER IT WILL BE U.S.

161
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
MILITARY ACTION.

162
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THAT DECISION BUT THE

163
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
DECISION ON WHETHER

164
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS HAVE BEEN

165
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
USED, THAT HAS BEEN

166
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
DECIDED, SPECIFICALLY THE

167
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ADMINISTRATION SAYING

168
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TONIGHT THEY HAVE DIRECT

169
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
EVIDENCE THAT THE REGIME,

170
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THE SYRIAN REGIME USED

171
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
SYRIAN GAS.

172
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THAT IS A SPECIFIC KIND OF

173
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
CHEMICAL WEAPON AND THAT IT

174
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
KILLED ABOUT 150 PEOPLE.

175
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
IMPORTANT, BUT LET'S
REMEMBER AS YOU HAVE NOTED

176
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT'S A SMALL NUMBER OF

177
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED

178
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
COMPARED TO THE OVER WELL

179
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
OVER 90,000 THE U.N. SAID

180
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
HAS NOW BEEN SLAUGHTERED IN

181
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THIS CONFLICT.
150 IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

182
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
BUT STILL, YOU KNOW, JUST A

183
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET IN

184
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THIS BROADER CONFLICT

185
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
SHEP.

186
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> Shepard: IT WAS THE
PRESIDENT WHO SAID THAT'S

187
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THE RED LINE.

188
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HEAR
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

189
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

190
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
STILL WAITING ON.

191
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
AND REPUBLICAN SAXBY

192
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
CHAMBLISS IS SAYING TONIGHT

193
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LOOK, THIS IS NOT REALLY

194
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
MAJOR NEWS THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION IS NOW

195
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
SAYING CHEMICAL WEAPONS

196
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WERE USED.

197
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY

198
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
HAVE SUSPECTED FOR A LONG

199
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
TIME.
WHAT HE SPECIFICALLY WANTS

200
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SAXBY CHAMBLISS IS A NO-FLY

201
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ZONE.
THE ADMINISTRATION TONIGHT

202
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
RULED THAT OUT AT LEAST FOR

203
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
NOW AND THAT'S NOT MAKING

204
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
CHAMBLISS HAPPY.

205
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> WE NOW KNOW THE CHEMICAL

206
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WEAPONS HAVE BEEN USED FOR

207
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
ALMOST A YEAR BY THE SYRIAN

208
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
REGIME.

209
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WE HAVE DONE NOTHING.

210
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
SO I THINK IT'S TIME THAT

211
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WE ACT IN A VERY SERIOUS

212
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WAY.
IF A NO-FLY ZONE IS WHAT

213
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THEY DECIDED TO DO, THEN

214
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'M SURE OUR MILITARY IS

215
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TAKING RIGHT PREPARATIONS

216
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
FOR CARRYING OUT A

217
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION AND I

218
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WILL SUPPORT THAT.

219
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
>> SO WHEN WILL WE HEAR

220
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT?

221
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ARE

222
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000

224
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000

225

THE FRENCH THE BRITISH AND

227
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
OTHERS.

228
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
CONSULTING WITH THEM BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS AND PUBLICLY

229
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
TELLING THE WORLD WHAT THE

230
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
ARE THE NEXT STEPS.

231
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
>> Shepard: OPTIONS HAVE
BEEN DESCRIBED AS

232
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
POTENTIALLY ALL BAD.

233
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
MIGHT U.S. INTERVENTION

234
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
MAKE THINGS WORSE WOULD THE

235
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
RUSSIANS JOIN IN ON THE

236
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
SIDE OF THE SYRIAN

237
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
GOVERNMENT?

238
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
COULD THE CONFLICT EXPAND

239
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ACROSS THE REGION?
JONATHAN HUNT'S REPORT ON

240
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THIS GROWING CRISIS JUST

241
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
AHEAD.
FIRST THOUGH THE FEDS MIGHT

242
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT

243
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THE ATTACKS OF 9/11 IF THEY

244
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
HAD BEEN COLLECTING

245
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
MILLIONS OF PHONE RECORDS

246
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
BACK THEN LIKE THEY ARE

247
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
NOW.
THAT'S WHAT THE FBI

248
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER

249
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TOLD CONGRESS TED.

250
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
-- TODAY.

251
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HE SAID THEY COULD HAVE

252
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
LINKED THE PHONE NUMBER

253
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
YEMEN TO ONE OF THE

254
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HIJACKERS BEFORE 9/11.

255
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
>> THE OPPORTUNITY WAS NOT

256
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THERE IF WE HAD THAT

257
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
PROGRAM THAT OPPORTUNITY

258
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

259
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
>> I'M NOT PERSUADED THAT

260
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO

261
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
COLLECT EVERY -- EVERY

262
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
CALL -- IT'S MY FEAR THAT

263
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF

264
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
BECOMING A SURVEILLANCE

265
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
STATE.

266
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THIS PART OF THE STORY LIVE

278
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
FROM D.C. NEWSROOM.

279
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> ASKED WHETHER ED SNOWDEN

280
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WAS A SPY OR HAD DEFECTED

SERIOUS HARM.

THAT ARE JUST CAN DID CANDIDLY

SCRUB OF WHAT HE IS

HIS CHINA CONNECTIONS ARE.

292
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
IT SEEMS UNUSUAL THAT HE

293
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WOULD BE IN CHINA AND

294
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
MY DOCTOR AND I WENT WITH AXIRON

383
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THE ONLY UNDERARM LOW T TREATMENT.

384
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
AXIRON CAN RESTORE T LEVELS TO NORMAL

385
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS IN MOST MEN.

386
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
AXIRON IS NOT FOR USE IN WOMEN OR

387
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ANYONE YOUNGER THAN 18

388
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
OR MEN WITH PROSTATE OR BREAST CANCER.

389
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WOMEN, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE OR
WHO MAY BECOME PREGNANT

390
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
AND CHILDREN SHOULD AVOID CONTACT
WHERE AXIRON IS APPLIED

391
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
AS UNEECTED SIGNS OF PUBERTY IN CHILDREN

392
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
OR CHANGES IN BODY HAIR

393
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
OR INCREASED ACNE IN WOMEN MAY OCCUR.

394
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
REPORT THESE SYMPTOMS TO YOUR DOCTOR.

395
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL
MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND MEDITIONS.

396
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS COULD INCLUDE

397
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
INCREASED RISK

PROBLEMS BREATHING WHILE SLEEPING;

403
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
AND BLOOD CLOTS IN THE LEGS.

404
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
SKIN REDNESS OR IRRITATION WHERE APPLIED

HEADACHE, DIARRHEA, VOMITING AND INCREASE
IN PSA.

407
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT E ONLY UNDERARM

I GUESS THE QUESTION WAS

500
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
HOW ABOUT SOME ARRESTS?

501
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000

WE DON'T HAVE COLLEAGUES WE

512
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
UNIQUE.

513
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000

515
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000

532
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
NOMINATED JAMES COLME TO

534
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000

HE WAS THE NUMBER TWO

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
OFFICIAL AT THE JUSTICE

DOZENS OF WORKERS ARE HURT

539
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
AND AT LEAST ONE IS DEAD

540
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
AFTER AN EXTREMELY LARGE

541
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
AND POWERFUL BLAST AT A

542
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
CHEMICAL PLANT IN

543
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
LOUISIANA.

544
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

545
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
STARTED A FIRE THERE.

546
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
AND THAT BLAST WAS SO

547
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
STRONG THAT ONE MAN SAYS

548
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THE GROUND SHOOK AT HIS

549
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
HOME SEVERAL MILES AWAY.

550
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
HE SAID IT FELT LIKE A

551
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
THREE SECOND EARTHQUAKE.

552
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
IT HAPPENED IN AN

553
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
INDUSTRIAL AREA ABOUT

555
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
ROUGE.
SEVEN FIRE DEPARTMENTS

556
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.

557
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
AND CREWS JUST STARTED

558
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
CLEARING OUT WORKERS AS

559
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
FAST AS THEY COULD.

560
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
>> THE LATEST NUMBERS ARE

561
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
THAT 73 INDIVIDUALS FROM

562
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THE PLANT SITE HAVE BEEN

563
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
TAKEN TO A VARIETY OF LOCAL

564
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
HOSPITALS.

565
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
AS OF NOW WE BELIEVE THAT

566
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
EVERY WORKER HAS BEEN
ACCOUNTED FOR.

567
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
>> Shepard: GOVERNOR JINDAL

EVACUATION ZONE.

625
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
ALICIA?
>> SHEPARD, AND NOW THE

626
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
SHERIFF SAYS THIS BECOMES A

627
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

628
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
THE CORONER IS NOW ON SCENE

629
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
AND WILL TRY TO MAKE AN

630
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
IDENTIFICATION.
HERE IS WHAT THE SHERIFF

631
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
TOLD US WAS HAPPENING WITH

632
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THESE TWO PEOPLE WHOSE

633
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
REMAINS WERE FOUND.

634
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
THEY BELIEVED THAT THESE

635
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
TWO PEOPLE WERE PACKING UP

636
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
AT THE TIME AND TRYING TO

637
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
GET OUT OF THE FIRE ZONE.

638
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
AND THE REASON THEY SAY

639
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
THAT IS THAT ONE OF THESE

640
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
FOLK WAS ON THE PHONE WITH

641
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
SOMEONE ELSE DISCIPLINING

642
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

643
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER

644
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
LINE SAID THAT THEY COULD

645
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
HEAR A POPPING IN THE

646
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
BACKGROUND AND THEN THEY

647
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING ELSE.

648
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
SUPPOSEDLY THESE FOLKS ARE

649
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS

650
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
AREA.

651
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
NOW, WHAT THE SHERIFF

652
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
DESCRIBED THIS AREA IT WAS

653
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
INTENSELY HOT PLACE WITHIN

654
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
THE FIRE, SO THE FIRE IS

655
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
ITSELF HOT.

656
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
THIS WAS INAT THE BUS

657
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
STOPLY HOT AREA.
HE SAID THIS WAS AN AREA

658
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
WHERE THE TREES WERE

659
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
CROWNING.
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE

660
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
FIRE WAS THEN TRAVELING

661
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
VERY QUICKLY ON THE TOPS OF

662
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
THE TREES.

663
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
SO IF YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO

664
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
GET OUT OF THAT AREA, IT

665
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
CAN BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IF

666
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
YOU ARE DOING THAT TOO

667
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
LATE.
IN TERMS OF A FIRE FIGHT,

668
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
THEY ARE SAYING IT'S ONLY

669
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
5% CONTAINED BUT THEY ARE

670
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
DOING THE BEST THEY CAN TO

671
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CLOUD

672
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
COVER AND SOME THE COOLING

673
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
TEMPERATURES AT THIS TIME.

674
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
BUT, YES, THIS HAS

675
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
DEFINITELY TAKEN A DEADLY

676
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
TURN.

677
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

678
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
THEY HAVE EVACUATED MORE

679
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
THAN 38,000 PEOPLE AT THIS

680
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
TIME.
AND SO MANY HOMES STILL

681
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED

682
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000

693
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
IT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT

EMERGENCY CREWS HAD TO CUT

698
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
THE DRIVER FROM THE WRECK.

699
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
HE LATER WAS PRONOUNCED

700
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL.

701
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED.

702
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THIS HE WAS A TWO-TIME

703
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
WINNER ON THE NASCAR

704

705
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
FELLOW DRIVER TONY STEWART

706
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000

707
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000

709
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
AND IN A STATEMENT NASCAR

OFFICIALS SAY HE WAS A

711
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
FIERCE COMPETITOR AND THAT

712
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000

941
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
HELP ME OUT WHAT DOES IT

942
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
MEAN?
>> IT CLEARLY LEAVES OPEN

943
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
RIGHT NOW A HUGE RANGE OF

944
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
OPTIONS.
THIS IS THIS IS HOW FAR THE

945
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
SECURITY ADVISOR WAS

946
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
WILLING TO GO.

947
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
LISTEN.
>> THAT INCLUDES MILITARY

948
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
SUPPORT.

949
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I CANNOT DETAIL FOR YOU ALL

950
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
OF THE TYPES OF THAT

951
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
SUPPORT.
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

952
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
BUT, AGAIN SUFFICE IT TO

953
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
SAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE

954
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
DIFFERENT IN BOTH SCOPE AND

955
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
SCALE THE REBELS HAVE BEEN

956
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
ASKING FOR MORE

957
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES.

958
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF

959
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
MISSILES THAT THE PROVIDING

960
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
TO THE SOVIET INVASION IN

961
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
AFGHANISTAN IN THE 1980S

962
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
AND WERE CREDITED WITH

963
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
CHANGING THE COURSE OF THAT

964
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
CONFLICT ANOTHER OPTION

965
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
WOULD BE ESTABLISHING THE

966
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
KIND OF NO-FLY ZONE THAT

967
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
NATO ENFORCED OVER THE

968
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
SKIES OF LIBYA.

969
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
ABOUT APPARENTLY ACCORDING

970
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
TO OFFICIALS AT THE WHITE

971
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
HOUSE AND BEYOND, THERE ARE

972
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
NO DECISIONS YET.

973
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
THE PRESIDENT WILL AMONG

974
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
THE WORLD LEADERS ATTENDING

975
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
WILL BE PRESIDENT PUTIN OF

976
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
RUSSIA.
HE MAY HAVE SOME VERY

977
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
STRONG THOUGHTS ON ANY
PROPOSALS TO DEEPEN U.S.

978
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN HIS

979
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ALLY SYRIA.

980
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
SHEP?

981
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
>> YEAH, IS HIS INDUSTRY

982
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
WOULD SUGGEST.

983
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
JONATHAN HUNT WOULD IN.

984
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
TWO IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS

985
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
FROM THE THE PRIME MINISTER

986
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000

STRIKE DIFFERENT TONES

988
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
AFTER VIOLENT AND DEADLY

989
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
PROTESTS STARTING UNFOLDING

990
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THERE.

991
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
FIRST THE PRIME MINISTER
DELIVERED WHAT HE CALLED A

992
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
FINAL WARNING.

993
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
TELLING ALL THOSE

994
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
DEMONSTRATORS THAT HE AND

995
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
OTHER LEADERS HAVE RUN OUT

996
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
OF PATIENCE.

997
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
THOSE ACTIVISTS THOUGH ARE

998
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
STILL CAMPING OUT IN TAX

999
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
TAKSIM SQUARE.

1000
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000

REPORTED PARK INTO A MALL.

1003
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THAT PLAN FIRST SET OFF ALL

1004
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
THESE DEMONSTRATIONS.

1005
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE

1006
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
REPORTED DEAD INCLUDING AN

1007
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
OFFICER SINCE THE PROTEST

1008
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
BEGAN.
THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE

1009
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
SAID TO BE HURT.

1010
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
DRUG COMPANIES CANNOT

1011
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
PATENT OUR GENES.

1012
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
IT'S A BIG LANDMARK

1013
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
DECISION TODAY FROM THE

1014
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
UNITED STATES SUPREME

1015
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
COURT.

1016
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THE CASE INVOLVED A COMPANY

1017
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THAT PATENTED TWO GENES

1018
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
WHICH ARE LINKED TO A

1019
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
WOMAN'S RISK TO DEVELOPING

1020
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
BREAST CANCER OR OVARIAN

1021
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
CANCER.

1022
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THE ACTRESS ANGELINE NO

1023
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
JOLIE SAID SHE HAD A DOUBLE

1024
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
MASTECTOMY AFTER LEARNING

1025
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
SHE CARRIED ONE OF THOSE

1026
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
GENES.

1027
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
AFTER TODAY'S RULING THE

1028
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
DECIDED GENES ARE PART OF

1029
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
NATURE.

1030
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
BECAUSE SCIENTISTS FOUND
THEM DOES NOT MEAN THEY

1031
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
CREATED THEM OR OWN THEM

1032
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000

SHANNON.

1036
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
>> MEDICAL RESEARCHERS SAY

1037
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
WHEN IT COMES TO GENETIC

1038
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
TESTING TODAY'S OPINION

1039
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
WILL MAKE A WORLD OF

1040
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
DIFFERENCE.

1041
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE ARGUED
THAT THE COMPANY EXCLUSIVE

1042
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
HOLD ON THE GENE PATENTS

1043
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
MADE TESTING INCREDIBLY

1044
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
EXPENSIVE OUT OF REACH FOR

1045
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
MOST PEOPLE AND PREVENTED

OTHER COMPANIES FROM

OPTIONS.
TODAY JUSTICE CLARENCE

1049
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THOMPSON WROTE WE WROTE

1050
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
THAT A NATURALLY OCCURRING

1051
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
D.N.A. SEGMENT IS A PROCESS

1052
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
OF NATURE AND NOT PATENT

1053
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
ELIGIBLE NEARLY BECAUSE

1054
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
IT'S BEEN ISOLATED.

1055
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
>> THE SUPREME COURT SENDS

1056
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
A REALLY IMPORTANT MESSAGE

1057
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
THAT OUR GENES, PARTS OF

1058
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
OUR HUMAN BODY CANNOT BE

1059
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
PATENTED.
THE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

1060
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
GENES IS TOO IMPORTANT TO

1061
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ALLOW ONE COMPANY TO

1062
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
CONTROL ALL OF ITS USES.

1063
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
>> THE JUSTICES DID

1064
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
HOWEVER HOLD THAT

1065
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
SYNTHETIC COPIES OF D.N.A.

1066
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
CREATED IN A LAB ARE NOT

1067
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
NATURALLY OCCURRING.
SO THEY CAN BE PATENTED.

1068
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
MYRIAD SAID IT IS HAPPY THE

1069
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
COURT UPHELD THE PATENTS ON

1070
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000

AND IMPROVING PEOPLE'S

1073
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
LIVES.

PERCENTAGE AND THE S&P TOO.

1087
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
ALL OF THIS AFTER THE

1088
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
GOVERNMENT RELEASED

1089
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000

OK, I AM COMING.  [ Susan ] I HATE

00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
THAT THE REASON  WE'RE ALWAYS STOPPING

1118
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
IS BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO  TO THE BATHROOM.

1119
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AND WHEN WE'RE SITTING  IN TRAFFIC

1120

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
INCREDIBLE REALLY.
JUST YESTERDAY, 10-YEAR-OLD

1170
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
SARAH WAS IN A COMA AND

1171
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
VERY CLOSE TO DEATH

1172
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
ACCORDING TO HER FAMILY.

1173
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
THEN A RELATIVE GOT THE

1174
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
NEWS THEY HAD PRAYED THEY

1175
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
WOULD HEAR.
A SET OF LUNGS WAS

1176
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000

IT COULD SAVE HER LIFE.

BE BREATHING ON HER OWN.

1181
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
>> NOW SHE IS INTUBATED.

1182
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
SHE HAS BEEN SINCE

1183
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000

THEY WILL PROBABLY TAKE

1184
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
THAT TUBE OUT IN THE NEXT

1185
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
48 HOURS.

1186
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000

QUICK HERE.

1189
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
IT HAPPENS PRETTY FAST.

1190
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THEY HAVE GOT THOSE GET

1191
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
THOSE LUNGS WORKING AS FAST

1192
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
AS THEY CAN.

1193
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
>> SARAH HAS CYSTIC

1194
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
FIBROSIS A GENETIC DISEASE.

1195
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
TRANSPLANT WAS FRANKLY HER

1196
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ONLY HOPE.
THE RULES SAY YOU HAVE TO

1197
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
BE 12 YEARS OLD TO GET ON

1198
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

1199
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
SINCE THERE ARE SO FUEL

1200
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
CHILD DONORS SARAH'S

1201
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
PARENTS GOT TO THE JUDGE

1202
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
AND THE JUDGE BENT THE

1203
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
RULES SO SHE COULD GET AN

1204
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ADULT ORGAN.
THAT LIKELY SAVED THE

1205
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE.

1206
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THE GIRL IS NOT OUT OF

1207
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
DANGER.
FAR FROM IT.

1208
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
MORE WITH SOME HURDLES

1209
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
AHEAD.

1210
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
>> THERE ARE SHEP.

1211
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
THE BIGGEST HURDLE IS THE

1212
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
POSSIBILITY THAT HER BODY

1213
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
MIGHT REJECT THE DONOR LUNG

1214
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS ON

1215
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
MEDICATION TO PREVENT THAT
BUT THIS REALLY WILL BE A

1216
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
LIFE-LONG PROBLEM FOR

1217
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
SARAH.

1218
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
WE SPOKE TO A LUNG

1219
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
TRANSPLANT SURGEON WHO SAYS

1220
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
OVER THE YEARS DOCTORS HAVE

1221
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
GOTTEN VERY GOOD AT

1222
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
REPLACING VITAL ORGANS BUT

1223
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
HE ALSO CAUTIONED THAT IN

1224
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
THESE TYPES OF SURGERIES

1225
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
SOMETHING ALWAYS COMES UP.

1226
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
LISTEN.

1227
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
>> SWELLING OF THE LUNG.

1228
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
LUNG BEING SLIGHTLY TOO BIG

1229
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
OR TOO SMALL IN THIS CASE

1230
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
IT MAY BE A LOWER LOBE

1231
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THAT'S PUT IN.
SO THERE HAVE A VARIETY OF

1232
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH

1233
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
THE WAY THAT THE LUNGS ARE

1234
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
SOWN IN.

1235
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THAT'S GETTING TO BE LESS

1236
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
AND LESS COMMON IT DOES

1237
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
HAPPEN ESPECIALLY SWHU A

1238
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
ADVISE MISMATCH LUNG LIKE

1239
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
THIS.

1240
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THAT DOCTOR SAYS WHEN THEY

1241
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
PULL OUT THE BREATHING TUBE

1242
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
HE BELIEVES E. BELIEVES

1243
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
SARAH WILL TAKE FIRST DEEP

1244
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
BREATH IN A VERY LONG TIME.

1245
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
SHEP?
>> ANYTHING FROM HEALTH AND

1246
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
HUMAN SERVICES?

1247
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
>> YEAH.
THEY DID COMMENT BUT IT WAS

1248
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
VERY SHORT AND IT DID NOT

1249
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
MENTION SARAH'S CASE AT

1250
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
ALL.
IT READS AND I'M QUOTING

1251
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
HERE.
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE

1257
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
THIS SERVES AS A REMINDER
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

1258
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
ORGAN DONATION.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

1259
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
IF THIS WERE UP TO HEALTH

1260
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
AND HUMAN SERVICES SARAH

1261
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN NEW

1262
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
LUNGS.
HER FAMILY SAYS THIS IS A

1263
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
VERY GOOD EXAMPLE FOR OTHER

1264
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000

1265
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
FIGHTING.

1266
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000

1267
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
NEVER LOSE HOPE AND NEVER

1268
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
GIVE UP.
BE AGGRESSIVE AND LEARN AS

1269
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
MUCH AS YOU CAN AND MAKE

1270
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
SURE YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT

1271

BASICALLY DON'T BRING ANY

1671
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
BAGS.
THE LEAGUE CLAIMS THIS WILL

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
HELP SECURITY AND SPEED UP

1673
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000

FIVE CYBERRIAN TIGER CUBS

1679
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
MAKING THEIR FIRST PUBLIC

1680
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
APPEARANCE.

1681
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT THIS
IS A WILDLIFE PARK IN

1682
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
CHINA.
THE CUBS NICKNAMED THE FIVE

1683
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
SISTERS BECAUSE AS YOU

1684
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
MIGHT EXPECT THEY ARE ALL

1685
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000

00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
SPECIES INCLUDING THESE
RING TAILED LEMURS.

1691
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
CONFIDENCE THAT SYRIA'S

1692
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
LEADER HAS USED CHEMICAL

1693
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN

1694
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
PEOPLE.

1695
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
THE ONE OFFICIAL SAYS THE
U.S. WILL NOW PROVIDE

1696
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
MILITARY SUPPORT TO THE

1697
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
OPERATION.
WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT?

1698
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
WE HAVE NO IDEA.
A SHERIFF IN COLORADO

1699
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
CONFIRMS THE MOST

1700
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000

KILLED AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE.

1703
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
THAT WILDFIRE HAS ALSO

1704
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF

1705
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
HOMES.
AND INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY

1706
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
ARE NOW TRYING TO DETERMINE

1707
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
WHAT CAUSED AN ENORMOUS

1708
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
EXPLOSION AT A CHEMICAL

1709
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
PLANT IN LOUISIANA.

00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
BLAST RESULTED IN A FIRE

1712
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
KILLED A WORKER AND HURT
MORE THAN 70 OTHERS.

1713
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
AND ON THIS DAY IN THE YEAR

1714
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000

1715
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
WEATHER LEWIS REACHED THE
GREAT FALLS OF THE MISSOURI

1716
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
RIVER CONFIRMING HIS

1717
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
EXPEDITION WITH WILLIAM

1718
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
CLARK WAS RIGHT ON TRACK

1719
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER

1720
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

1721
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
THE TEAM HAD SET OUT THE

1722
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
PREVIOUS YEAR.

1723
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
SOME NATIVE AMERICANS HAD

1724
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
GIVEN THEM VALUABLE

1725
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
DIRECTIONS TO THE ROCKIE

1726
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
MOUNTAINS.
THEY TOLD LEWIS AND CLARK

1727
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
THEY HAD HAD REACHED AN

1728
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
IMPASSABLE WATER FALL WHEN

1729
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
THEY NEARED THE ROCKIES.

1730
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
THE PARTY CONTINUED UP THE

1731
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
MISSOURI RIVER UNTIL IT

1732
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
FORKED OFF WITH NO CLUE

1733
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
WHERE TO GO, LEWIS AND A

1734
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
FEW OTHERS WENT AHEAD OF

1735
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
THE PACK IN HOPES OF

1736
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
FINDING THAT GREAT WATER

1737
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
FALL.

1738
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
THEY CHOSE THE RIGHT PATH.

1739
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
AND EXPLORERS MADE A VITAL

1740
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
FIND ON THEIR WESTWARD

1741
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
