NOON IN LAS VEGAS.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE REVEALED

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
STUNNING NEWS ABOUT THE CONCERT

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
KILLER.
FROM HIS APPARENT ESCAPE PLAN

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
AND HIS INTEREST IN OTHER MUSIC

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
FESTIVALS TO HIS MYSTERIOUS

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
PAST.
>> STEPHEN PADDOCK IS A MAN THAT

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
SPENT DECADES ACQUIRING WEAPONS

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
AND AMMO AND LIVING A SECRET

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
LIFE.
MUCH OF WHICH WILL NEVER BE

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING TO

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
UNRAVEL HIS STORY AND WHETHER HE

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
HAD HELP.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
WE'RE ALSO HEARING ABOUT THE

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
RESPONDERS THAT RISKED THEIR

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
LIVES TO SAVE CIVILIANS ON THE

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
POLICE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THE

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
WHITE HOUSE WEIGHING IN ON A

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
CONTROVERSIAL GUN DEVICE WHICH
MAY HAVE HELPED THE VEGAS

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
SHOOTER CARRY OUT HIS MADNESS.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
LET'S GET TO IT.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
AND FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
THIS THURSDAY AFTERNOON, THE

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S OPEN TO

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
THE IDEA OF REGULATING BUMP

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
STOCKS.
THOSE ARE THE DEVICES THAT THE

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
SHOOTER IN LAS VEGAS APPARENTLY

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
USED TO ALLOW HIS RIFLES TO FIRE

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
MUCH LIKE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
IT COMES JUST AFTER THE NATIONAL

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
RIFLE ASSOCIATION CALLED ON THE

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
WHETHER BUMP STOCKS COMPLY WITH

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
THE LAW.
IN A STATEMENT LEADERS OF THE

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
GUN RIGHTS GROUP WROTE "THE NRA

TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES TO

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
FUNCTION LIKE FULLY AUTOMATIC

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
RIFLES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS."

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
MORE AHEAD ON THE TRUMP

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THE

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
MASSACRE IN VEGAS.

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
WE'RE LEARNING THE GUNMAN MAY

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
HAVE HAD OTHER TARGETS IN MIND.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
THAT'S THE WORD FROM THE

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
INVESTIGATORS.

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
THEY SAY STEPHEN PADDOCK RENTED
ROOMS OVERLOOKING TWO OTHER

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
MUSIC FESTIVALS.

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
ONE IN LAS VEGAS THE WEEKEND

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
BEFORE THIS SHOOTING AND ANOTHER

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
IN LAST AUGUST IN CHICAGO DURING

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC FESTIVAL.

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THERE'S REPORTS THAT PADDOCK

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
SCOUTED OUT HOTELS IN FENWAY

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
PARK IN BOSTON AND WE'RE

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
LEARNING HE MIGHT HAVE PLANNED

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
TO ESCAPE AFTER THE VEGAS

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
ATTACK.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
WHO DIDN'T GIVE ANY OTHER

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
DETAILS.

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
POLICE SAY THE GUNMAN KILLED

73
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
HIMSELF IN HIS HOTEL ROOM AS

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
SWAT UNITS CLOSED IN.

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
HE KILLED 58 PEOPLE AND INJURED

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
HUNDREDS MORE AT THE COUNTRY

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
MUSIC FESTIVAL ACROSS THE

78
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
STREET.
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY'RE STILL

79
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
STRUGGLING WHY HE DID THIS.

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
FBI AGENTS QUESTIONED THE

81
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND YESTERDAY.

82
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
HER LAWYER SAYS SHE HAD NO IDEA

83
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
WHAT STEPHEN PADDOCK WAS

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
PLANNING WHEN HE SENT HER TO THE

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
PHILIPPINES TO BE WITH HER

86
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
FAMILY.

87
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
SHE SAID WHEN HE SENT HER

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
$100,000 AND TOLD HER TO BUY A

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HOUSE, SHE THOUGHT HE WAS

90
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
BREAKING UP WITH HER.

91
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE.

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
LET'S BEGIN WITH KEVIN CORKE AT

93
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

94
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
KEVIN?

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
>> THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO

96
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
MAINTAIN A LASER-LIKE FOCUS ON

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE HEALING AND THE AFTER MATH

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OF THE DEVASTATION IN NEVADA BUT

99
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
FACT THAT THERE'S QUESTIONS,

101
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ESPECIALLY ABOUT AS WHAT YOU

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
JUST LAID OUT, THE BUMP STOCK

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THAT WAS USED IN THIS ASSAULT ON

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES IN THE

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
NEVADA DESERT.

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
WE HEARD FROM SARAH SANDERS NOT

107
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
LONG AGO.

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SHE SAID THIS AS FAR AS THE

109
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW OF A

110
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
POSSIBLE BAN.
>> OUR FOCUS, AS WE SAID THE

111
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
LAST COUPLE DAYS, HAS BEEN ON

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
HEALING AND UNITING THE COUNTRY.

113
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
THE INVESTIGATION STILL

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
CONTINUES TO BE IN VERY EARLY

115
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
STAGES.
WE KNOW THAT BOTH MEMBERS OF

116
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BOTH PARTIES IN MULTIPLE

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING TO

118
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
TAKE A LOOK AT BUMP STOCKS AND

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
RELATED DEVICES.
WE WELCOME THAT.

120
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
>> GOT TO DO IT.

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HAVE TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AT IT.

123
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY

124
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS CAN

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
UNPACK SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

126
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
SHEPARD.

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> Shepard: KEVIN, THE WHITE

128
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
HOUSE WEIGHING IN ON THE REPORT

129
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THAT SECRETARY OF STATE REX

130
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
TILLERSON THREATENED TO RESIGN

131
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
AND CALLED THE PRESIDENT A

132
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
MORON.

133
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THE REPORTING IS FROM CARROLL

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
LEE FROM NBC NEWS.

135
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
AT A CONFERENCE YESTERDAY,

136
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SECRETARY TILLERSON NEVER

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CONSIDERED QUITTING BUT HE

138
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
DIDN'T DEFLY HE CALLED THE

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
PRESIDENT A MORON.

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
HE DENY IT A FEW HOURS LATER

141
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THROUGH A SPOKESMAN.

142
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
HERE'S THE EXCHANGE.

143
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> WAS THE PRESIDENT UPSET THAT

144
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE DIDN'T

145
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
DENY CALLING HIM A MORON IN HIS

146
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
PUBLIC REMARKS YESTERDAY?

147
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
>> AS THE SECRETARY STATE SAID,

148
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THIS IS A PETTY RIDICULOUS

149
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
ACCUSATION.

150
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
FRANKLY I THINK IT'S BENEATH THE

151
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SECRETARY OF STATE TO WEIGH-IN
ON EVERY RUMOR OUT THERE.

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
HIS SPOKESPERSON, HOWEVER, DID

153
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
COME OUT
AND CLARIFY THAT THE

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
SECRETARY OF STATE HAS NEVER
USED THOSE WORDS.

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
>> Shepard: BACK TO KEVIN CORKE

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
KEVIN, CAROL LEE IS A

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
WELL-RESPECTED JOURNALIST THAT

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
SAYS SHE HAS MORE THAN TEN
SOURCES ON THE MATTER BUT THE

159
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
PUSH-BACK IS STRONG.
>> HERE'S MORE OF WHAT SARAH

160
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SANDERS HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE

161
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
PRESIDENT'S ACCUSATION THAT THIS

162
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF FAKE NEWS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS A GREAT

163
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
FRUSTRATION WITH THE FACT THAT A

164
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE INACCURATE

165
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
INFORMATION THAT IS BEING

166
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
PRESENTED AS FACTUAL.

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A LOT OF TIMES OPINIONS ARE

168
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BEING PRESENTED AS NEWS AND

169
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THEY'RE NOT.

170
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THAT IS A REAL CONCERN AND

171
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED

172
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
AT.

173
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
>> HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ON THIS IF

174
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
YOU'RE SARAH SANDERS.

175
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN ALSO

176
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
COME OUT OF THE CONVERSATION

177
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A

178
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
REPORTER OF THE ESTEEM OF CAROL

179
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
LEE.
>> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE

180
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
WALKING BACK COMMENTS FROM

181
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
HE TOLD FOX NEWS HE MIGHT HAVE

182
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
TO WIPE OUT PUERTO RICO'S TENS

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
OF MILLIONS IN DEBT TO HELP

184
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
RECOVER FROM HURRICANE MARIA.
BUT MAYBE NOT.

185
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
KEVIN CORKE IS AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.

186
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S CONFUSION ON THIS.

187
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
>> YEAH, THERE'S CONFUSION.
AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, THE

188
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE A COMMENT,

189
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
BUT IT'S SORT OF OFF THE CUFF.
DOES IT EQUAL POLICY?

190
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
HERE AGAIN IS SARAH SANDERS ON

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TRYING TO MAKE MOST SENSE, IF
SHE CAN, OUT OF WHAT THE

192
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
PRESIDENT SAID PREVIOUSLY.

193
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
>> RIGHT NOW, THE PRIMARY FOCUS

194
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
IS TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO PUERTO

195
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
RICO AND SUPPORT IN THE

196
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
REBUILDING EFFORTS.

197
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WHILE WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH

198
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
THE IMMEDIATE DISASTER, IT ISN'T

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
INAPPROPRIATE TO FOCUS ON THE

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
DIFFICULTIES THAT PUERTO RICO
WAS DEALING WITH BEFORE THE

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
STORM.
THERE'S A PROCESS FOR HOW TO

202
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
DEAL WITH PUERTO RICO'S DEBT.

203
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
IT WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT

204
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
PROCESS TO HAVE A LASTING

205
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
RECOVERY AND GROWTH.

206
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WAS PUT

207
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
IN PLACE AND SET UP UNDER OBAMA.

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THAT HAS A BOARD OF ADVISERS

209
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THAT DEALS WITH THAT DEBT AND IT

210
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
WILL GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

211
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
>> I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE BACK

212
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
AND FORTH ON THIS, SHEPARD,

213
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
BLAKE BURMAN IN PARTICULAR.
SEEMS THE PRESIDENT MADE A

214
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
STATEMENT THAT HAD TO BE WALKED

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
BACK.
MAYBE HIS PRAISE FOR WHAT COULD

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
HAPPEN DOESN'T LINE UP WITH

217
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WHERE THE DOLLARS MAY END UP.

218
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
SHEPARD?
>> KEVIN CORKE AT THE WHITE

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
HOUSE.

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
"THE WASHINGTON POST" IS

221
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
REPORTING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

222
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
PLANS TO ANNOUNCE NEXT WEEK THAT

223
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
HE WILL DE-CERTIFY THE

224
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR DEAL WITH

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
IRAN.

226
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> "THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS HE

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
WILL WALK AWAY FROM IT.

228
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

229
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THERE'S THIS REVIEW THAT WAS SET

230
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
UP BY LAW BY SENATORS CORKER AND

231
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
CARDIN.
CLEARLY WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS

232
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
MAKE SURE CONGRESS HAS A HAND IN

233
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THIS, SHEPARD.
SO WHILE HE MAY DECIDE TO

234
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
DE-CERTI

235
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
DE-CERTIFY, DOESN'T MEAN THAT

236
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A PART.

237
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
>> Shepard: LET'S GO TO ANNA

238
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
PALMER FROM POLITCO.

239
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

241
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
>> Shepard: A LOT TO GET TO

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
HERE.
THIS TILLERSON THING, YOU WONDER

243
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS, A

245
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
MATTER THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION
BY ANYBODY.

246
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WHEN TILLERSON IS NEGOTIATING

247
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
MATTERS REGARDING NORTH KOREA,

248
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THE PRESIDENT TWEETS DON'T

249
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
BOTHER.
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT HAS TO BE

250
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
DONE.
HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE -- I DON'T

251
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
UNDERSTAND IT.

252
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE SAW THIS WEEK

253
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
IS KIND OF HOW THIS RELATIONSHIP

254
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
AND THIS DANCE BETWEEN REX

255
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TILLERSON AND THE PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN EVOLVING OVER THE PAST

256
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SEVERAL WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS.

257
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK ONE OF THE BIG

258
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
QUESTIONS IS DOES THE PRESIDENT

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
HAVE CONFIDENCE --

260
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> Shepard: HE SAYS HE DOES.

261
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
>> HE HAS SAID HE DOES.

262
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THE QUESTION IS, RESULT ALSO

263
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
DIDN'T WALK BACK TO THE FACT

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THAT HE CALLED THE PRESIDENT A

265
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
MORON OR NOT.

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WITH THIS

267
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
PRESS CONFERENCE, HE WAS TRYING

268
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
TO SAY LOOK, I'M ON THE AMERICA

269
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
FIRST AGENDA.

270
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I HAVE AMERICA'S BACK.

271
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
IT WAS NOT ONLY A MESSAGE TO

272
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT A MESSAGE TO

273
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THESE COUNTRIES THAT I HAVE TO

274
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS.

275
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
>> Shepard: WHAT DO WE MAKE OF

276
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THE IRAN TALK.

277
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
IF YOU BACK OUT OF THE DEAL,

278
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN COME UP

279
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WITH A NEW DEAL.

280
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
YOU HAD TO GET THESE COUNTRIES

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
TOGETHER ON THIS THING.

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
WITHOUT THIS DEAL, WHERE ARE WE?

283
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
>> I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING --

284
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN HE WAS ON

285
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL RAILED AT THE

286
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
DEAL OF BEING BAD.

287
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
SO THEY'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE

288
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
NEEDLE SAYING THEY WANT TO PULL

289
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
OUT OF IT.

290
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
IT'S A PROCESS.

291
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SO YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T THROW

292
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
THE WHOLE DEAL AND THE WORLD

293
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
INTO CHAOS.

294
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
HE'S TRYING TO HAVE IT BOTH

295
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WAYS.
>> Shepard: I READ HE MIGHT BE

296
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
TRYING TO KNOCK IT DOWN A PEG

297
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
AND THEN LIFT IT BACK UP AGAIN.

298
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE CREDIT FOR

299
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
FIXING SOMETHING.
>> RIGHT.

300
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
MY COLLEAGUE WROTE ABOUT THIS A
COUPLE DAYS AGO.

301
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
BASICALLY SAYING EXACTLY THAT.

302
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
HE WANTS TO HAVE THIS PUBLIC

303
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
STATEMENT THAT GOES VERY

304
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
AGGRESSIVELY BUT ABLE TO COBBLE

305
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
TOGETHER SOMETHING WITH CONGRESS

306
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
TO COME BACK AND SAY, LOOK,

307
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO PULL OUT OF

308
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
IT.
>> Shepard: WHAT IS THE STORY

309
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
FOR AID WITH PUERTO RICO?

310
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
IS THIS A TEST OF THE WINDS ON

311
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THIS MATTER OR IS IT A TRIAL

312
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
BALLOON?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

313
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
HAPPENING THERE EITHER.

314
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
>> LISTEN, CONGRESS AND THE

315
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
PRESIDENT SAID THEY'RE GOING TO

316
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
HAVE THE MONEY THEY NEED WHEN

317
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THEY NEED IT.
SO FAR CONGRESS HAS HAD THE

318
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
MONEY FOR TEXAS AND THE
DIFFERENT HURRICANES THIS YEAR

319
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
AND THE FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.

320
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
SO I THINK THE MONEY WILL BE

321
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THERE, BUT AS FAR AS WHAT WILL

322
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
HAPPEN WITH THE PUERTO RICAN

323
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
DEBT, CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT GOT

324
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AHEAD ON WIPING THAT AWAY.

325
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THE ACTUAL PROCESS IS, YOU CAN'T

326
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
JUST WIPE IT AWAY.

327
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
>> Shepard: THE VICE PRESIDENT

328
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
IS AT J.B.A., JOINT BASE

329
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
ANDREWS.
USED TO BE ANDREWS AIR FORCE

330
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
BASE.

331
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
THIS IS WHERE VICE PRESIDENTS GO

332
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
BEFORE THEY HEAD OFF PLACES.

333
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
HE'S GOING DOWN TO ORLANDO AND
TOUR SOME OF THE HURRICANE

334
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
DAMAGE DOWN THERE.

335
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THE FUNDING OF THESE DISASTERS

336
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
IS GOING TO BE A REAL LONG-TERM

337
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
CHALLENGE.

338
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT

339
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
CUTTING TAXES ACROSS THE BOARD,

340
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
DEPENDING WHO YOU BELIEVE,

341
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
ADDING A TRILLION DOLLARS TO THE

342
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
DEBT OVER TIME.

343
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
NOW YOU HAVE TENS OF BILLIONS IN

344
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
TEXAS AND TENS OF BILLIONS IN

345
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
FLORIDA AND MAYBE MORE THAN THAT

346
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
IN PUERTO RICO.
IT'S DAUNTING.

347
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

348
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE ON

349
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THE SCALE OF -- KATRINA IS WHAT
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW

350
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THEY JUDGE THAT.

351
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE.

352
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
YOU SEE SOME OF THE CONSERVATIVE

353
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
WING ON THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE

354
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
SIDE SAYING HOW ARE WE GOING TO

355
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
PAY FOR THIS?

356
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
ARE WE GOING TO KEEP WRITING

357
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THESE CHECKS AND NOT ACTUALLY

358
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
BALANCE THE BUDGET?
AS YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE FUNDING

359
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AND THE NEED CONTINUES AND THE

360
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
WEEKS AND MONTHS AS IT GOES

361
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
FORWARD, YOU'LL START HAVING

362
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
CONSERVATIVE -- START TO ASK THE

363
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
QUESTION, WHERE IS THIS MONEY

364
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
COMING FROM, HOW ARE WE GOING TO

365
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
GET TO A TAX CUT SITUATION, A

366
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
TAX PACKAGE IF WE'RE CONTINUING

367
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
TO WRITE THESE CHECKS.

368
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
>> SO MOVEMENT NOT ON GUN

369
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
CONTROL, BUT ON REGULATING
OUTSIDE DEVICES.

370
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SOME CONSERVATIVES AND

371
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
REPUBLICANS HAVE COME OUT IN

372
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
FAVOR OF TAKING A LOOK AT BUMP

373
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
STOCKS.

374
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

375
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE

376
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THIS.
AND NOW THE NRA SAYING YEAH, YOU

377
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT.

378
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
IS THERE AN APPETITE FOR REAL

379
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
GUN CONTROL?

380
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
WE KNOW THIS PRESIDENT WAS AT

381
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
ONE POINT A NEW YORK LIBERAL.

382
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
YOU WINDER IF HE WON'T MIGRATE

383
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
IN THAT DIRECTION.

384
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
>> THIS IS THE ONE AREA AT BEST

385
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THAT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU'RE FOR
GUN CONTROL OR GUN CONTROL OF

386
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
THIS TYPE THAT YOU'LL FIND ANY

387
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
KIND OF COALESCING OF PEOPLE

388
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
SUPPORTING IT.

389
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON

390
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

391
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THE NRA EVEN SAYING THIS IS

392
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED

393
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
AT.
CERTAINLY -- I'VE COVERED SOME

394
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
OF THESE TRAGEDIES A LONG TIME.

395
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THIS IS AS MUCH COALESCING

396
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
AROUND ONE PROACTIVE THING THAT

397
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
THEY COULD DO IN LEGISLATION

398
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
THAT WILL HAPPEN.
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 2018

399
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ELECTION YEAR, A LOT OF

400
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
DEMOCRATS THAT DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE AN ELECTION YEAR ISSUE.

401
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
JOE MANCHIN, HEIDI HEIDCAMP,

402
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO

403
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
TALK ABOUT IT.
>> Shepard: OKAY.

404
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
AHEAD, WHY INVESTIGATORS SAY THE

405
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
KILLER IN LAS VEGAS MAY HAVE HAD

406
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
HELP.

407
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX

408
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
NEWS DECK ON A THURSDAY

409
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
AFTERNOON.
GLAD TO HAVE YOU IN.
This woman is laughing
because she's listening

410
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to a hilarious
audiobook on Audible.

411
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And this woman is laughing
because she's pretending

412
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
her boss's terrible
story is funny.

413
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Still actually laughing.

414
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No longer making
a human noise.

415
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Experience the comedy,
not your commute.

416
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Dial STAR-STAR-Audible on
your smartphone

417
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
to start listening today.

418
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
If you're not content

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
to remain where you are,

420
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
why should your teeth be?

421
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Invisalign clear aligners

422
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
can shape your smile

423
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
up to 50% faster.

424
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't let anything slow
you down.

425
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Visit Invisalign.com

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Remember that accident I got in

427
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
with the pole, and I
had to make a claim
and all that?

428
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Is that whole thing
still dragging on?

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, I took some pics
with the app and...

430
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
filed a claim, but...

431
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You know how they send you
money to cover repairs and...

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They took forever
to pay you, right?

433
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No, I got paid
right away, but...

434
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
at the very end of
it all, my agent...

435
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Wouldn't even call
you back, right?

436
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No, she called to see
if I was happy.

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But if I wasn't happy
with my claim experience

438
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
for any reason,

439
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
they'd give me
my money back,

440
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
no questions asked.

441
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Can you believe that?

442
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The Claim Satisfaction
Guarantee,

444
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
only from Allstate.

445
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Switching to Allstate
is worth it.

446
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
>> Shepard: WE'RE HEARING FROM

447
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
FIRST RESPONDERS THAT RUSHED

448
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
INTO HARM'S WAY AND FIRED INTO A

449
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
CROWD OF 22,000 PEOPLE.

450
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

451
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THEY FACE.

452
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
TRACE GALLAGHER ONCE AGAIN FROM

453
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
LAS VEGAS NOT FAR FROM WHERE THE

454
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SHOOTING HAPPENED.

455
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
TRACE?
>> SHEP, THERE WAS A GROUP OF

456
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
FIREFIGHTERS THAT WAS HANDLING A

457
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
CAR NEAR MANDALAY BAY BEFORE

458
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
THIS STARTED.

459
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
THEY WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN

460
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
FIVE SECONDS.
THEY'RE SAYING WITHIN A FEW

461
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
MINUTES, THERE WAS MORE THAN 100

462
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE TO HEAR

463
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS FRIGHTENING

464
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
AND VERY FASCINATING.

465
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THEY WERE WORKING THIS WHOLE

466
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
TRIAGE SETUP UNDER FIRE.
KIND OF LIKE A BATTLEFIELD.

467
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
AT ONE POINT IN TIME, THE RADIO

468
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
TRAFFIC WAS SO JUMBLED THAT THE

469
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
FIREFIGHTERS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW

470
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WHERE THE SHOOTING WAS COMING

471
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
FROM.

472
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE WORKING

473
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
WITH MULTIPLE SHOOTERS.

474
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
THEN THEY SAID THE FEEL OF

475
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
VICTIMS WAS ALMOST A MILE LONG.

476
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
>> THEY WERE LAYING IN BETWEEN

478
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
THE RUNWAYS, TRYING TO TAKE

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
COVER.
THE AREAS ARE CARVED OUT BETWEEN

480
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
THE RUNWAYS AND THE TAXIWAYS.

481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THEN WE HAD REPORTS OF GUN SHOTS

482
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
AT THE AIRPORT.

483
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WE HAD A LOT

484
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
ON OUR HANDS.
A LOT WE THOUGHT WAS ESCALATING

485
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
WHEN IT WAS REALLY CONTAINED BUT

486
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
WE DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE OF SO

487
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
MANY CALLS COMING IN.

488
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
>> WHEN HE SAID ON THE RUNWAY OF

489
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
McCARRAN AIRPORT, HE'S TALKING

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE WE ARE

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
RIGHT NOW.

492
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THEY PUSHED DOWN THE FENCES AND

493
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
RAN TO GET AWAY AND ENDED UP

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
BETWEEN THE RUNWAYS AND THE

495
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
TAXIWAYS.
IT'S PHENOMENAL.

496
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
THE FIREFIGHTERS SAID THEY HAD

497
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
REHEARSED, TRAINING FOR THIS

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
SCENARIO FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE

499
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
THEY'RE A HIGH TARGET

500
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
DESTINATION.

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
SHEP?
>> Shepard: NOTHING SPECIFIC,

502
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
TRACE, ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE
OTHER POSSIBLE TARGETS?

503
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> WELL, WE HAVE DEFINITELY

504
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
CONFIRMED THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK

505
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
DID BOOK A HOTEL ROOM IN CHICAGO

506
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
OVERLOOKING GRANT PARK IN AUGUST

507
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA CONCERT

508
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THAT MALIA OBAMA WAS IN

509
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
ATTENDANCE THERE.

510
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THE BLACKSTONE HOTEL RELEASED A

511
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
STATEMENT.
IT SAYS "ON BEHALF OF THE

512
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
BLACKSTONE, WE CAN CONFIRM THERE

513
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
WAS NO GUEST UNDER THE NAME WHO

514
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
STAYED AT OUR HOTEL IN AUGUST

515
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC

516
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
FESTIVAL.
WE CAN CONFIRM A RESERVATION WAS

517
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
MADE UNDER THE NAME OF STEPHEN
PADDOCK.

518
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
HOWEVER, AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT
CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE SAME

519
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
PERSON AS THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER.

520
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WE'RE COOPERATING WITH THE

521
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
AUTHORITIES ON THAT MATTER."

522
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
NOW THE CHICAGO POLICE HAVE IN

523
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
FACT CONFIRMED THIS IS THE VERY

524
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
SAME STEPHEN PADDOCK THAT DID

525
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
BOOK THAT HOTEL AT THE

526
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
BLACKSTONE OVERLOOKING

527
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
LOLLAPALOOZA.

528
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT HE

529
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
BOOKED A HOTEL ROOM AT THE

530
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
MANDALAY BAY AND ANOTHER CONCERT

531
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
CALLED LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL BY
CHANCE THE RAPPER.

532
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
SO WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ON

533
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
THE REPORTS OF THE AVIATION FUEL

534
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
TANKS, WE JUST MENTIONED

535
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
McCARRON AIRPORT, THE AVIATION

536
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
FUEL TANKS WERE HIT BE SOME

537
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
BULLETS.
THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL

538
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
SAID HE WAS TARGETING IT.

539
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

540
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
TO CONFIRM THAT WE DON'T HAVE

541
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
ENOUGH TO RULE IT OUT.

542
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THE BULLETS DID HIT THE TANK.

543
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
WERE THEY BULLETS THAT WERE

544
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
BEING RANDOMLY FIRED?

545
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
POSSIBLE.
WAS IT TARGETED?

546
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
ALSO POSSIBLE.

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THE SHERIFF LAST NIGHT IN THIS

548
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
ASTOUNDING NEWS CONFERENCE MADE
MENTION OF A POTENTIAL

ACCOMPLICE.

550
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
HE BELIEVES THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK

551
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
DID HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE.

552
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE A SUPER

553
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
HUMAN EFFORT TO PULL OFF WHAT HE

554
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
DID ALONE.

555
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS

556
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
SAYING IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO

557
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
THIS ATTACK AT THE MANDALAY BAY

558
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
HOTEL WHERE HE WAS GAMBLING FOR

559
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
HOURS AND HOURS, HE WAS WITH A

560
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WOMAN THAT WAS NOT HIS

561
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
GIRLFRIEND AND NOW POLICE ARE

562
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHO

563
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
EXACTLY THAT WOMAN WAS WITH HIM

564
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
IN THOSE DAYS LEADING UP TO IT,

565

SHEP.

566
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
>> Shepard: LOTS OF GREAT
INFORMATION, TRACE.

567
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
TRACE GALLAGHER ON SCENE.
THANKS AGAIN.

568
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT

569
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
THE LAS VEGAS GUNMAN, STEPHEN

570
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
PADDOCK.

571
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
AHEAD WE'LL TALK WITH A FORMER

572
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
FBI INVESTIGATOR ABOUT THE

573
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
QUESTIONS HE SAYS THAT

574
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
INVESTIGATORS NEED TO GET

575
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
ANSWERED.

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
♪

577
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When food is good
and clean and real,

578
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
it's ok to crave.

579
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And with Panera catering,
there's more to go around.

580
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Panera.

581
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Food as it should be.

582
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that just tastes better.

583
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So fresh from the farm.

584
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Delicious.

585
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Perfect.

586
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Only one egg

587
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
with more great nutrition-

588
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
now with 5 times

589
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
more vitamin D,

590
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
10 times more vitamin E,

591
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and 25% less saturated fat.

592
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Only one egg good enough

593
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
for my family.

594
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Because why have ordinary

595
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
when you can have the best.

596
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Eggland's Best.

597
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The only egg that

598
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
gives you so much more:

599
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Better taste.

600
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Better nutrition.

601
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Better eggs.

602
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
>> THE NUMBER 2 OFFICIAL IN THE

603
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ANYBODY SAYS HE'S SURPRISED THAT

604
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT LEARNED

605
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MORE YET ABOUT WHAT DROVE

606
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
STEPHEN PADDOCK TO COMMIT MASS

607
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
MURDER.

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
ANDREW McCABE SAID WE HAVE A LOT

609
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
OF WORK TO DO.

610
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
WHAT IS MISSING?

611
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
WHAT ARE THE BIG MISSES PIECES?

612
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
>> THERE'S NO EASY BOX TO PUT

613
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
PADDOCK IN.

614
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
IF AN ATTACK HAPPENS, IT'S AN

615
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
ISLAMIC ATTACK OR RACIALLY

616
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
MOTIVATED ATTACK.

617
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
PADDOCK DIDN'T HIT ANY OF THOSE

618
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
TRIP WIRES.

619
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO DIG

620
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
DEEP AND FIGURING OUT WHAT HIS

621
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
MOTIVATION WAS, WHAT CAUSED HIM

622
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
TO DO WHAT HE DID.
>> Shepard: WE KNOW HE'S A

623
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
MILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE
INVESTOR.

624
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
HE GAMBLED A LOT.

625
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
IF HE BLEW ALL OF HIS MONEY

626
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
GAMBLING THEY WOULD KNOW THAT BY

627
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
NOW, WOULDN'T THEY?

628
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
>> AND THEY SHOULD.

629
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATION

630
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
WILL GO.
IT WILL GO INTO HIS FINANCIAL

631
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
BACKGROUND, GOES INTO ANYBODY HE

632
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
CONTACTED.
THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE

633
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
FIRST WIFE, THE SECOND WIFE,

634
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
PEOPLE HE WORKED WITH.

635
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
HE SEEMED TO HAVE VARIOUS

636
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
DIFFERENT JOBS, ALL GOOD JOBS,

637
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
BUT DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND

638
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
DIFFERENT JOBS.

639
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THOSE

640
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
CO-WORKERS AND BOSSES TO FIGURE

641
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
OUT WHAT MADE THIS GUY TICK.

642
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
>> Shepard: THERE WAS A NOTE.

643
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT.
>> WE DON'T.

644
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I THINK THE LAS VEGAS

645
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
METROPOLITAN POLICE HAVE THAT
NOTE AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING UP

646
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
ANYTHING ON IT.

647
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
>> Shepard: I WONDER IF THEY

648
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
HAVE -- POLICE CAN WITHHOLD

649
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THE COURSE

650
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
OF AN INVESTIGATION.

651
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY
NEED TO GET TO, THEY CAN

652
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
WITHHOLD INFORMATION.

653
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I WONDER IF THEY DON'T KNOW

654
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
ABOUT MOTIVE THAN WHAT WE'RE

655
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
HEARI

656
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
HEARING?
>> AND THEY MAY.

657
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
IN AN INVESTIGATION, YOU DON'T
WANT TO TIP YOUR HAT.

658
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HOLD

659
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO

660
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
FURTHER THEIR INVESTIGATION

661
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
WITHOUT TIPPING THEIR HAND OR

662
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT I MAY

663
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
BECOME A SUBJECT OF AN

664
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
INVESTIGATION.

665
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD.

666
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
>> Shepard: IS THIS IDEA THAT HE

667
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
WAS WITH A WOMAN GAMBLING BEFORE

668
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
COMMITTING THIS ATTACK SOMEONE

669
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
WHO HASN'T COME FORWARD, MUST

670
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
REALIZE WOW, THIS IS THE GUY I

671
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
WAS WITH THAT NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO

672
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
HAVE QUESTIONS FOR WHOEVER THAT
IS.

673
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
>> THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.

674
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
IN THE COURSE OF THE

675
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
INVESTIGATION, THEY NEED TO TALK

676
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
TO THAT WOMAN.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE.

677
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT WHEN YOU

678
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
SAID IT.

679
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN TELL

680
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
US HOW OR WHAT PADDOCK WAS

681
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
FEELING.
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE

682
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
INVESTIGATION.

683
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
>> Shepard: THERE'S ALWAYS A

684
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
REASON, RIGHT?

685
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I DON'T REMEMBER A MATT ATTACK

686
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
WHERE IN THE END NO ONE CAN

687
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
FIGURE OUT WHY THEY DID IT.

688
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
MAY NOT BE A REASONABLE REASON

689
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
BUT THERE IS USUALLY A REASON.

690
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
>> RIGHT.

691
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
YEAH, ALWAYS A REASON.

692
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
IT MAY BE ONE THAT NOBODY CAN

693
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
AGREE WITH.
PERSON MAY BE CRAZY.

694
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID,
MAYBE HIS FINANCIAL SITUATION

695
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
TURNED BAD.
MAYBE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN

696
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
PURCHASING 33 WEAPONS OVER THE

697
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
COURSE OF A YEAR.
HE MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNING THIS

698
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
AS FAR AS A YEAR AND DIDN'T HIT

699
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
ANY TRIP WIRES.

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
REGION OF SPAIN ARE THREATENING

734
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
TO BREAKAWAY NEXT WEEK.

735
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
THERE'S BEEN MASSIVE PROTESTS

736
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
AND FIGHT WITH POLICE IN SPAIN.

737
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
THE NEWS CONTINUES NEXT.

738
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I was always
"the girl with psoriasis."

739
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
People don't stare anymore.

740
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I never joined in.

741
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That wasn't fair to any of us.

742
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I was covered.

743
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I tried lots of things
over the years.

744
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But I didn't give up.

745
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I kept on fighting.

746
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I found something that worked.

747
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
That still works.

748
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Now?

749
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
SEE ME.

750
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
SEE ME.

751
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I found clear skin that lasts.

752
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
See if COSENTYX could make a
difference for you-

753
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
COSENTYX is proven to help
people with moderate

754
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
to severe plaque psoriasis...

755
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
...find clear skin that
can last.

756
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Don't use if you're allergic
to COSENTYX.

757
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Before starting COSENTYX,

758
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
you should be checked
for tuberculosis.

759
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
An increased risk of infections
and lowered ability

760
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
to fight them may occur.

761
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Tell your doctor if you have an
infection or symptoms.

762
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Or if you have received a
vaccine or plan to.

763
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If you have inflammatory
bowel disease,

764
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
tell your doctor if symptoms
develop or worsen.

765
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Serious allergic reactions
may occur.

766
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
SEE ME
to know...

767
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
...clear skin can last.

768
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Don't hold back...

769
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
...ask your dermatologist if
COSENTYX can help you

770
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
find clear skin that lasts.

771
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Mom,on my car insurance of money
by switching to GEICO.

772
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I should take a closer
look at GEICO...

773
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You know, GEICO can help you
save money

774
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
on your homeowners
insurance too?

775
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Great! GEICO can help insure
our mountain chalet!

776
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
How long have we been sawing
this log?

777
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Um, one hundred
and fourteen years.

778
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Man I thought my arm would
be a lot more jacked by now.

779
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm not even sure
this is real wood.

780
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
There's no butter in this churn.

781
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Do my tris look okay?

782
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Take a closer look at GEICO.

783
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Great savings.
And a whole lot more.

784
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
>> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS

785
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FRUSTRATED

786
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
THAT THE INVESTIGATION INTO

787
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
POSSIBLE COLLUSION BETWEEN

788
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

789
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS

790
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
STILL GOING ON.

791
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
>> IT'S LITERALLY FOUND ZERO

792
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN

793
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.

794
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WOULD LIKE THEM TO FOCUS ON SOME

795
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
OTHER THINGS.

796
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I KNOW THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE
SAID THIS ALL ALONG AND WE'RE

797
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
GLAD THAT AS THEY CONTINUE THIS

798
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
PROCESS THEY'RE COMING TO THE

799
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
SAME CONCLUSION.

800
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
>> Shepard: THEY HAVEN'T COME TO

801
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THAT CONCLUSION.

802
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THIS COMES AFTER THE REPUBLICAN

803
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE

804
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE SAID THE

805
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION BETWEEN

806
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS

807
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
STILL OPEN.

808
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
IN OTHER WORDS, NO CONCLUSION.

809
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
STILL OPEN.
SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

810
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
AND SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT

811
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
MUELLER ARE LOOKING INTO THE

812
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
MEDDLING INTO THE ELECTION BY
RUSSIA AND TIES TO TEAM TRUMP.

813
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS LIVE IN

814
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
WASHINGTON.

815
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
CATHERINE, THE COMMITTEE IS

816
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
ASKING FOR MORE DOCUMENTS.

817
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

818
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

819
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
COMMITTEE ASKED FOR RECORDS

820
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000

CONTACT WITH RUSSIANS GOING BACK

822
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
SEVEN YEARS, TRAVEL TO RUSSIA,

823
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
CAMPAIGNS, E-MAILS OR TEXTS.

824
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
A LETTER SENT UNDER THE

825
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000

826

COMMITTEE'S REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN

829
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
DELETION, SHREDDING OR

830
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
MIGRATION.
>> THE INQUIRY HAS EXPANDED

831
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
SLIGHTLY.

832
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
INITIAL INTERVIEWS AND DOCUMENT

833
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
REVIEW GENERATED HUNDREDS OF

834
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
ADDITIONAL REQUESTS ON OUR PART

835
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
FOR INFORMATION.

836
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
IT IDENTIFIED MANY LEADS THAT

837
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
EXPANDED OUR INITIAL INQUIRY.

838
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
>> A ONE-TIME FOREIGN POLICY

839
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
ADVISER CARTER PAGE SAID THE

840
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
REQUEST MOUNTED TO A FISHING

841
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
EXPEDITION.

842
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
HE SAID THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF

843
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
FALSE TESTIMONY.

844
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
THE COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN PAGE

845
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
UNTIL OCTOBER 18 TO COMPLY.

846
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
>> Shepard: WHAT DO WE KNOW

847
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
ABOUT THIS REPORT THAT RUSSIAN

848
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
HACKERS STOLE SENSITIVE
INFORMATION FROM AN NSA

849
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
CONTRACTOR?
>> WE HAVE HAD A STATEMENT FROM

850
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
BEN SASSE ON THIS REPORTING THAT

851
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WAS FIRST DONE BY THE "WALL

852
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
STREET JOURNAL."
THE SENATOR ACCUSED THE NSA OF

853
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
PUTTING THEIR HEAD IN THE SAND

854
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
OVER CONTRACTING PROBLEMS.

855
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
SAYING THE NSA NEEDS TO GET

856
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
THEIR HAND OUT OF THE SAND AND

857
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
SOLVE THE CONTRACTOR PROBLEM.

858
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WE CAN'T AFFORD THESE

859
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
SELF-INFLICTED INJURIES.

860
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
WHAT WE KNOW INDEPENDENTLY

861
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
THROUGH OUR OWN REPORTING IS

862
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THAT THERE REMAINS VERY DEEP

863
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
CONCERN ABOUT THE CONSPIRACY

864
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
SOFTWARE AND THAT IT CAN BE

865
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
EXPLOITED BY RUSSIAN AFFILIATED

866
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
OR RUSSIAN BACKED HACKERS.

867
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
WE HAVE LINES OUT TO THE NSA FOR

868
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
COMMENTING BY THE REPORTING THAT

869
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
HACKERS WORKING FOR THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT STOLE DETAILS ABOUT

870
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THE U.S. CYBER TACTICS INCLUDING

871
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
HOW WE GET INSIDE FOREIGN

872
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
COMPUTER NETWORKS AND DEFEND

873
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS.

874
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
THE CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

875
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ACCORDING TO THE "WALL STREET

876
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
JOURNAL" WAS REMOVED AND PLACED

877
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
ON A CONTRACTOR'S HOME COMPUTER.

878
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THAT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION THERE.

879
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
AND THAT COMPUTER USED THIS

880
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
CONSPIRACY ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

881
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
LAST MONTH YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER

882
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
THE ACTING SECRETARY OF HOPE

883
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
LAND SECRETARY ELAINE DUKE GAVE

884
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
AGENCIES TO WIPE CONSPIRACY

885
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
SOFTWARE FROM THEIR SYSTEMS.

886
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
OFFICIALS HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THE

887
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
EVIDENCE.

888
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THE ORDER SHOWS THE EVIDENCE WAS

889
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
DEEMED CREDIBLE AND SIGNIFICANT.

890
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
CURRENT AND FORMER GOVERNMENT

891
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
OFFICIALS TOLD FOX NEWS THE REAL

892
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
CONCERN IS THAT CONSPIRACY

893
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
EXECUTIVES HAVE TIES TO THE

894
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
RUSSIAN MILITARY AND THE

895
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.

896
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THOUGH THE COMPANY DENIES THOSE

897
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
CONNECTIONS, SHEP.

898
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
>> Shepard: SO THEY STOLE SPY

899
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
TOOLS.
THAT'S NOT A NEW THING.

900
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> IF YOU THINK BACK IN THE LAST

901
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
SIX MONTHS, WE HAD A SIMILAR

902
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
SITUATION WITH THE CIA AND THEIR

903
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
CYBER TOOLS INVOLVING

904
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
CONTRACTORS.
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THESE

905
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
ARE SERIOUS SITUATIONS BUT TO A

906
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
CERTAIN EXTENT, YOU NEED TO

907
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
THINK ABOUT THE CYBER TOOLS.

908
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
LIKE WHEN YOU BUY MILK AT THE

909
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
STORE.
THEY HAVE A BEST BUY DATE.

910
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
THE LIFETIME IS TYPICALLY 12 TO

911
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
18 MONTHS.

912
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A BREACH OR A

913
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
THEFT, PART OF THE FEELING IN

914
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS

915
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THEY'RE GOING TO EXPIRE IN THE

916
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM.

917
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
BUT THE BREACH OF TAKING IT HOME

918
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
IS AVOIDABLE AND SELF-INFLICTED.

919
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
>> THANKS CATHERINE HERRIDGE.

920
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
TOM, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

921
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
THERE'S ONE PERSON THAT SAYS

922
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
THIS IS FAKE NEWS, AND THAT'S

923
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
THE PRESIDENT.

924
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THE RUSSIANS MEDDLED WITH OUR

925
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
ELECTION IS NOT A MATTER THAT IS

926
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
IN DISPUTE.

927
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
WHAT ARE THEY CONTINUING TO DO

928
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
AND WHAT WILL THEY DO NEXT?

929
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
DO WE HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT IS

930
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
HAPPENING?
>> IT'S FASCINATING.

931
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
YOU LOOK AT THAT PRESS

932
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY WITH

933
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
SENATORS BURR AND WARNER.

934
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
THERE'S TWO DIRECTIONS.

935
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
IT'S LOOKING BACK AT WHAT

936
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
HAPPENED IN THE CAMPAIGN AND

937
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER THERE

938
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
WAS SOME COLLUSION.

939
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
THAT IS AN OPEN QUESTION RIGHT

940
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
NOW.

941
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
IT'S ALSO LOOKING FORWARD.

942
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
RIGHT?
WE'RE AT THE PRECIPICE OF

943
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
ANOTHER CAMPAIGN HERE, THE 2018

944
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
MID-TERMS.
SO THIS IS -- IT'S A HUGE

945
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
EXPANSIVE INVESTIGATION GOING ON

946
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
RIGHT NOW.

947
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
MULTIPLE PROBES GOING ON.

948
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU GET

949
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
FACEBOOK COMES OUT, REVEALS ADS.

950
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
EVERY ONE OF THOSE THINGS OFFERS
MORE FOR THEM TO LOOK INTO.

951
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THAT'S WHAT BURR AND WARNER SAID

952
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
YESTERDAY.
THEY'RE EXPANDING SLIGHTLY.

953
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
>> Shepard: IT'S ONE THING BURR

954
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
AROUND WARNER.
THERE'S A BIGGER THING GOING ON

955
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
AND THAT IS MUELLER.

956
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
WHATEVER MUELLER IS DOING, IT'S

957
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
NOT LEAKING.

958
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
HE HAS AN ARMY OF PROSECUTORS.

959
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
IT'S VERY CLEAR THE DIRECTION

960
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
HE'S GOING IN, ISN'T IT?

961
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
>> YEAH.

962
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
BASED ON EVERYTHING WE KNOW AND

963
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
WE'VE SEEN, THERE'S AN INTENSE

964
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
INTEREST ON FINANCIAL

965
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
STATEMENTS, FINANCIAL

966
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
INVESTIGATIONS.

967
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THOSE ARE THE EXPERTS THAT HE'S

968
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
BROUGHT ON AS YOU POINT OUT.
IT'S A PRETTY LOCK DOWN

969
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
INVESTIGATION.

970
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
A CREDIT TO THEM THERE.

971
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THERE'S NO LEAKING IN THIS TOWN

972
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
AT LEAST.

973
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
>> Shepard: THEY'RE FOLLOWING

974
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
THE MONEY.
>> EXACTLY.

975
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
YOU KNOW, THAT'S REALLY THE BIG

976
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
ONE.
LIKE THESE CONGRESSIONAL PROBES

977
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
ARE GOING TO FIND THINGS.

978
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
IT'S A WEIRD DYNAMIC.

979
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
ON ONE HAND, WE KIND OF RELY ON

980
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
THE CONGRESSIONAL PROBES

981
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
PUBLICLY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS

982
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
GOING ON.
THAT'S REALLY YOUR BEST CHANCE

983
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
AT FINDING SOMETHING.

984
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION AND A

985
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
PRETTY GOOD POSSIBILITY IF
MUELLER TURNS UP NOTHING THAT WE

986
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

987
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
AS A STANDARD PRACTICE IN THE

988
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
JUSTICE COMMUNITY.

989
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
>> Shepard: IT APPEAR WHAT'S

990
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
MULER IS GOING AFTER IS

991
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
FINANCIAL TRANSACTION.

992
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
WHETHER MONEY CHANGED HANDS

993
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
BETWEEN ONE PARTY AND ANOTHER,

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
IF IT DID, WHAT THAT TRANSFER OF

995
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
MONEY WAS ABOUT.

996
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WHAT SERVICES WERE RENDERED.

997
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
IS THAT FAIR?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

998
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THAT IS BASED ON THE EXPERTS

999
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THEY HAVE HIRED ON THAT TEAM,

1000
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
ABSOLUTELY.
THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE IT IS

1001
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
RIGHT NOW.

1002
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
WE'RE HEADING INTO A PRECARIOUS
MOMENT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

1003
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
THEY'RE STARTING TO BRING IN

1004
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS, CURRENT

1005
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
AND FORMER OFFICIALS FOR

1006
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
INTERVIEWS WITH MUELLER'S TEAM.

1007
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
YOU KNOW, THIS IS -- IT'S WHEN

1008
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
IT GETS REAL.

1009
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
LOOK BACK TO THE PRESIDENT'S

1010
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
TWEET EARLIER TODAY WHERE HE

1011
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
SAYS, WHY ISN'T THE INTELLIGENCE

1012
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING FAKE

1013
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
NEWS?
HE TENDS TO REACT TO WHAT IS

1014
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
HAPPENING.
HERE THIS IS LAPPING AT HIS DOOR

1015
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
STEP, LAPPING AT THE FRONT OF

1016
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
THE OVAL OFFICE, THIS IS GETTING

1017
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
SERIOUS.
>> Shepard: THINGS THAT DON'T

1018
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
MAKE SENSE.
IF YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING AND YOU

1019
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
WONDER IF PEOPLE AROUND YOU

1020
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
HAVE, THINGS THAT ARE AS ILLEGAL

1021
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
AS CONSPIRING WITH ANOTHER

1022
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THE COURSE

1023
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
OF HUMAN EVENTS IN OUR NATION, I

1024
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
MEAN YOU WOULD THINK WHAT YOU

1025
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
WOULD DO IS OPEN THE DOOR AND

1026
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SAY PLEASE, COME FIND OUT

1027
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
ANYTHING THAT WENT WRONG.

1028
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS WHITE HOUSE

1029
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
IS DOING.

1030
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
>> REMEMBER, THERE'S A GREAT

1031
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
REPORTING BY KEN VOGEL, "THE NEW

1032
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
YORK TIMES."

1033
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
INCREDIBLE SIT-DOWN NEXT TO TY

1034
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
COBB AND JOHN DOWD, THAT'S A

1035
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
FIGHT INSIDE THE LEGAL TEAM.

1036
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
YOU HAVE DON McGANN, THE WHITE

1037
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
HOUSE COUNSEL.

1038
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SET A

1039
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
PRECEDENT OF TURNING OVER THINGS

1040
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

1041
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THE FLIP SIDE IS TY COBB, THE

1042
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL COUNSEL
THAT SAYS NO, WE SHOULD BE

1043
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
TOTALLY COOPERATIVE AND TRY TO

1044
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
GET AS MUCH TO THEM AS POSSIBLE.

1045
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
NOTHING HAPPENED IS WHAT THEY

1046
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
SAY.
THEREFORE THIS SHOULD BE OVER

1047
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
SOON.

1048
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT, AS

1049
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
YOU POINT OUT, THIS IS A SPECIAL
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.

1050
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
THIS COULD GO ANY NUMBER OF

1051
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
DIRECTIONS.

1052
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
>> Shepard: TOM LOBIANCO, NICE

1053
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
TO SEE YOU.

1054
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THANK YOU.

1055
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
>> THANKS.
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

1056
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
TAX PLAN PASSING MAJOR HURDLE

1057
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
TODAY.
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

1058
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
APPROVED A BUDGET FRAME WORK

1059
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
THAT GIVES SENATE REPUBLICANS

1060
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
THE POWER TO PASS A TAX BILL

1061
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
WITH 50 VOTES INSTEAD OF THE 60

1062
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
YOU NORMALLY NEED.

1063
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
THEY ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO PASS

1064
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
A HEALTHCARE BILL BUT DIDN'T

1065
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
MANAGE TO GET IT DONE.

1066
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
OUR SEASON CAPITOL HILL

1067
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
PRODUCER, CHAD PERGRAM REPORTS
IF THE HOUSE HAD NOT APPROVED

1068
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THIS BUDGET FRAME WORK, THE

1069
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN PROBABLY

1070
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD LIKE

1071
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
IMMEDIATELY.

1072
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
MIKE EMANUEL HAS MORE.
ARE THEY OPTIMISTIC UP THERE

1073
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
NOW, MIKE?

1074
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
>> YEAH, THEY SEEM MORE HOPEFUL.

1075
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
IF YOU NEEDED 60 YES VOTES IN

1076
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
ORDER TO DO TAX REFORM, THAT

1077
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WOULD HAVE GIVEN DEMOCRATS

1078
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
TREMENDOUS LEVERAGE.

1079
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
YOU ONLY HAVE 52 REPUBLICANS.

1080
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
SO BOTTOM LINE, THEY WANTED TO

1081
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
PASS THIS BUDGET FRAME WORK WITH

1082
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THE TAX REFORM LANGUAGE IN IT IN

1083
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ORDER TO GET THAT DONE.

1084
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
THAT WAS A POINT THE HOUSE

1085
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SPEAKER MADE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR
EARLIER TODAY.

1086
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
>> THERE'S ONE MORE THING THAT

1087
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THIS BUDGET DOES THAT IS SO

1088
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
IMPORTANT.
IT PAVES THE WAY FOR HISTORIC

1089
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
TAX REFORM.

1090
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
UNLOCKS THE RECONCILIATION

1091
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
PROCESS.

1092
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
WE NEED TO PASS THIS BUDGET SO

1093
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
THAT WE CAN DELIVER REAL RELIEF

1094
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
FOR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES.

1095
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
>> MITCH McCONNELL IS SELLING

1096
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
THIS AS A ONCE IN A GENERATION

1097
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX A BROKEN TAX

1098
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000

SHEP?
>> Shepard: WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS

1100
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
SAYING ABOUT THE BUDGET FRAME
WORK PASSING?

1101
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
>> TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE

1102
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
BUDGET COMMITTEE IS BLASTING IT.

1103
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
HE SAYS THIS IS NOT ABOUT

1104
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
DELIVERING CONSERVATIVE

1105
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
PRINCIPLES IN TERMS OF CUTTING

1106
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
DEFICITS AND DEBT.

1107
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
HE SAYS THIS IS ABOUT USING

1108
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
SENATE RULES TO RAM THROUGH

1109
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
GIANT TAX GIVE AWAY TO THE

1110
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
WEALTHY AND CORPORATIONS.

THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER

1112
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
RIPPED IT AS WELL.

1113
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
>> THIS IS REALLY -- I USE THIS

1114
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WORDS FROM TIME TO TIME AND SO

1115
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
APPROPRIATE -- PATHETIC.

1116
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
THIS BUDGET THAT THEY'RE PUTTING

1117
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
FORTH COMBINED WITH THEIR TAX
PROPOSAL WILL ADD AROUND $2.4,

1118
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
NEARLY $2.5 TRILLION TO THE

1119
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
NATIONAL DEBT.
>> ALL HOUSE DEMOCRATS AND 18

1120
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST

1121
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
IT.
IT STILL HAD ENOUGH VOTES TO

1122
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
PASS.

1123
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
SHEP?
>> MIKE EMANUEL LIVE AT THE

1124
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
ROTUNDA.
THANKS A LOT.

1125
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
THE U.S. IS BRACING FOR ANOTHER

1126
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
POTENTIAL HURRICANE THIS

1127
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
WEEKEND.
RIGHT NOW IT'S A TROPICAL STORM.

1128
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
THE NAME IS NATE HEADED INTO THE

1129
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
GULF AND GENERALLY, AS YOU CAN

1130
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
SEE THERE, GENERALLY TOWARDS

1131
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
LOUISIANA, SOUTH MISSISSIPPI,

1132
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
LOWER ALABAMA.

1133
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
FORECASTERS SAY IT COULD GAIN

1134
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
SOME STRENGTH.

1135
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
DON'T EXPECT A MONSTER

1136
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
CATEGORY FIVE.

1137
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
NOTHING LIKE THAT.
BUT RAIN, OH, THE RAIN IS

1138
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
COMING.

1139
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Prudential asked these couples:

1140
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
how much money do you
think you'll need in retirement?

1141
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Then we found out how many years
that money would last them.

1142
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
How long do you
think we'll keep --

1143
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Oooooohhh! You stopped!

1144
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You're gonna leave me
back here at year 9?

1145
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
How did this happen?

1146
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
It turned out, a lot
of people fell short,

1147
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
of even the average
length of retirement.

1148
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
We have to think about
not when we expect to live to,

1149
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
but when we could live to.

1150
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Let's plan for income that lasts
all our years in retirement.

1151
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Prudential.
Bring your challenges.

1152
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
WE'RE ON A MISSION TO
SHOW DRIP COFFEE DRINKERS,

1153
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP TO KEURIG.

1154
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WAKEY! WAKEY! RISE AND SHINE!

1155
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
OH MY GOSH!
HOW ARE YOU?

1156
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
WELL WATCH THIS.
I POP THAT IN THERE.

1157
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
PRESS BREW.

1158
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THAT'S IT.

1159
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
LOOK HOW MUCH
COFFEE'S IN HERE?

1160
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
FRESH COFFEE.

1161
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
SO RICH.

1162
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I LOVE IT.

1163
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD
BE A KEURIG MAN!

1164
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
FULL-BODIED.

1165
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE DESCRIBING
THE COFFEE AND NOT ME?

1166
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
DO YOU WEAR THIS EVERY DAY?

1167
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
EVERYDAY.

1168
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'D NEVER TAKE IT OFF.

1169
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
ARE YOU READY TO
SAY GOODBYE TO IT?

1170
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
GO! GO!

1171
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
TA DA! A TERRARIUM.

1172
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
THAT'S IT.

1173
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
WE BREWED THE LOVE, RIGHT GUYS?

1174
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
(ALL) YES.

1175
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Thisto a hilarioushing
WE Bbaudiobook on Audible.gUYS?

1176
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And this woman is laughing
because she's pretending

1177
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
her boss's terrible
story is funny.

1178
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Still actually laughing.

1179
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
No longer making
a human noise.

1180
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Experience the comedy,
not your commute.

1181
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Dial STAR-STAR-Audible on
your smartphone

1182
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
to start listening today.

1183
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
>> Shepard: WEEKS AFTER MAJOR

1184
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
STORMS CAUSED SO MUCH

1185
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
DESTRUCTION IN TEXAS, FLORIDA

1186
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
AND PUERTO RICO AND BEYOND, THE

1187
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
GULF COAST IS BRACING FOR

1188
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
ANOTHER POSSIBLE HURRICANE.

1189
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
TROPICAL STORM NATE IS MAKING

1190
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
ITS WAY TO THE GULF OF MEXICO.

1191
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
FORECASTERS SAY IT COULD

1192
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
STRENGTHEN AND MAKE LANDFALL AS

1193
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
A HURRICANE THIS WEEKEND.

1194
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE CONE OF

1195
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
UNCERTAINTY ANYWHERE FROM

1196
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
EASTERN LOUISIANA ALL OF SOUTH

1197
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
MISSISSIPPI AND PARTS OF LOWER

1198
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
ALABAMA.

1199
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
EVEN INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE.
LET'S GO TO RICK REICHMUTH.

1200
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1201
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
>> RIGHT NOW CENTRAL AMERICA IS
TAKING A WALLOP FROM THIS.

1202
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
A LOT OF MOISTURE AND

1203
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ACROSS HERE.
BECAUSE OF THAT, WE'LL SEE SOME

1204
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
SIGNIFICANT FLOODING.

1205
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THE CENTER OF THIS IS OVER LAND
RIGHT NOW.

1206
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
NO STRENGTHENING GOING.
IT WILL MOVE BACK OUT
ACROSS

1207
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
PARTS OF THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN

1208
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
AND MAKE A SECOND LANDFALL

1209
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
BEFORE GETTING BACK TO THE GULF.

1210
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
THAT'S WHERE WE'LL SEE MORE

1211
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
STRENGTHENING.
SHORT TERM, SHEPARD, A LOT OF

1212
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
MOISTURE FOR CENTRAL AMERICA.

1213
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
SOME SPOTS,20 INCHES.

1214
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THAT WILL CAUSE LANDSLIDES AND

1215
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
LOCAL FLOODING HERE.

1216
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
>> RICK, WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE

1217
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
ACROSS THE GULF BE PREPARED FOR

1218
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
NOW?
>> SO A LOT OF OUR MODELS ARE

1219
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
KEEPING THIS KIND OF A STRONG

1220
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
TROPICAL STORM.
A COUPLE OF MODELS GETTING IT

1221
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
TOWARDS HURRICANE STRENGTH.

1222
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
NONE OF THE MODELS MAKING THIS A

1223
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
MAJOR HURRICANE, WHICH IS A VERY

1224
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE.

1225
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
OCTOBER, STILL AN ACTIVE TIME,

1226
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
ESPECIALLY FOR THE GULF AND THE

1227
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
CARIBBEAN.

1228
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
WE'RE GOING TO SEE RAIN HERE.

1229
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
BUT IT'S MOVING SO FAST, THE

1230
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
RAINFALL TOTALS WILL BE KEPT

1231
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
PROBABLY 4 TO 8 INCHES RANGE.

1232
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
IT WILL CAUSE SOME FLOODING.

1233
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHEN DO

1234
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
WE GET GOING ONCE IT'S BACK OUT

1235
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
OVER THE GULF.

1236
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THE GULF IS PLENTY WARM AT THIS

1237
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
TIME.
THERE'S LIKELY WIND SHEAR TO

1238
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
BREAK THIS THING APART.

1239
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
THE TWO MODELS WE RELY ON MOST,

1240
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
GOOD AGREEMENT HERE, SOMEWHERE

1241
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
AROUND LOUISIANA, MAYBE OVER

1242
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
TOWARDS MISSISSIPPI OR THE

1243
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ALABAMA COASTLINE.

1244
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
BECAUSE OF THAT, OUR CONE IS

1245
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
ACTUALLY NARROW AT THIS POINT.

1246
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
A LOT OF THE MODELLING PRETTY

1247
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
GOOD AGREEMENT.

1248
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
WHETHER WE GET TO THE HURRICANE

1249
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
STATUS OR NOT REMAINS TO BE

1250
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SEEN.
WE'LL HAVE A STRONG TROPICAL

1251
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
STORM HERE ACROSS PARTS OF THE

1252
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
GULF.
THAT'S SATURDAY NIGHT INTO

1253
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
SUNDAY.
WEEKEND A BAD WEEKEND.

1254
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
WE'LL SEE THE LOCALIZED FLOODING

1255
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
THERE AND AVOID ANY KIND OF A

1256
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
MAJOR HURRICANE FROM THIS ONE,

1257
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
SHEP.
>> Shepard: HOPE SO.

1258
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
THANKS, RICK.

1259
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

1260
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
LAS VEGAS GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.

1261
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
HER LAWYER SPEAKING NOW AFTER

1262
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
HOURS OF FBI QUESTIONING.

1263
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
WE'LL HAVE THAT NEXT.

1264
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
>> Shepard: THE GIRLFRIEND OF

1265
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
THE GUNMAN THAT KILLED 58
PEOPLE

1266
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
IN LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK SAYS SHE

1267
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING

1268
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
THE MASSACRE.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO HER

1269
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
ATTORNEY.
THE LAWYER READ A STATEMENT TO A

1270
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
CROWD OUTSIDE FBI HEAD QUARTERS
IN L.A. AFTER AGENTS QUESTIONED

1271
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
HER FOR HOURS.

1272
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
HER NAME IS MARILOU DANLEY.
SHE SAID THE KILLER SENT HER TO

1273
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
THE PHILIPPINES WHERE SHE HAD

1274
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
FAMILY AND SHE WAS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.

1275

COAST NEWS HUB THIS AFTERNOON.

1277
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
WILLIAM?
>> INVESTIGATORS HOPED THAT

1278
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
DANLEY WOULD TELL US WHY.
A QUIET MILLIONAIRE WOULD

1279
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
SUDDENLY SHOOT 58 PEOPLE.

1280
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
SHE DIDN'T.

1281
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
SHE SAID THAT PADDOCK SENT HER A

1282
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
CHEAP TICKET AND SENT HER TO THE

1283
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
PHILIPPINES AS A GIFT.

1284
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
AS FOR THE $100,000 THAT

1285
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
FOLLOWED, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS

1286
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
GOOD-BYE MONEY THAT PADDOCK WAS

1287
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
ENDING THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

1288
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
AT NO TIME DID SHE KNOW WHAT HE

1289
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
WAS GOING TO DO HERE'S DANLEY'S

1290
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
ATTORNEY READING HER STATEMENT.

1291
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
>> I KNEW STEPHEN PADDOCK AS A

1292
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
KIND, CARING, QUIET MAN.

1293
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME OR

1294
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
TOOK ANY ACTION THAT I WAS AWARE

1295
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
OF THAT I UNDERSTOOD IN ANY WAY

1296
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
TO BE A WARNING THAT SOMETHING

1297
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
HORRIBLE LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO

1298
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
HAPPEN.

1299
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
>> STILL DANLEY'S HELP REMAINS

1300
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
CRUCIAL IN REBUILDING HIS LIFE,

1301
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
MENTAL HEALTH, WHAT HE BOUGHT

1302
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
AND WHEN HE BOUGHT IT.

1303
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
ANOTHER POSSIBLE LEAD THAT THE

1304
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
FBI HAS SAID THEY HAVE NOT HAD A

1305
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
PROBLEM ACCESSING PADDOCK'S

1306
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
ELECTRONIC FILES, COMPUTER AND

1307
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
PHONE THAT COULD CORROBORATE HER

1308
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
STORY.
>> Shepard: THANK YOU, WILLIAM.

1309
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
THE UNLV FOOTBALL PLAYERS WILL

1310
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
BE WEARING A SPECIAL HELMET TO

1311
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
HONOR THE VICTIMS OF THE

1312
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
SHOOTING.
THE SCHOOL TWEETED THIS PHOTO.

1313
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THE PLAYERS TO WEAR THIS HELMET

1314
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THIS SATURDAY AND THROUGH THE

1315
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
END OF THE SEASON.

1316
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
THE CAMPUS FROM UNLV IS A FEW

1317
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
MILES FROM THE SHOOTING.

1318
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
UNLV ANNOUNCED THAT SATURDAY

1319
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
NIGHT'S GAME AGAINST SAN DIEGO

1320
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
STATE WILL BE CALLED HERO'S

1321
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
NIGHT.
THE PREGAME CEREMONY IS TO HONOR

1322
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE VICTIMS AND FIRST RESPONDERS

1323
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
OF THE DAY.

1324
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
WE'LL BE BACK WITH A LOOK AT

1325
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
WHEN THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS
SECRET AGENT FIRST SHOWED UP ON

1326
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
THE BIG SCREEN.

1327
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
IT HAPPENED ON THIS DAY IN

1328
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,000
HISTORY.

1329
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
(Bell ringing)

1330
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So, I was at Mom and Dad's
and found this.

1331
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
CDs, baseball cards.

1332
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Your old magic set?

1333
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
(Sigh)
And this wrestling ticket.

1334
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Which you still owe me for.

1335
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Seriously? $25?

1336
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I didn't even want to go.

1337
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Ahh, your diary!

1338
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
"Mom says it is
totally natural..."

1339
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
$25 is nothing.

1340
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
(Alert beep)

1341
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Abracadabra, bro.

1342
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Settle up with your friends
on October 17th

1343
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
with the Bank of America
Mobile Banking App.

1344
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
If you have moderate to severe
Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's,

1345
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and your symptoms have left you
with the same view,

1346
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
it may be time for a different
perspective.

1347
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
If other treatments haven't
worked well enough,

1348
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
ask your doctor about ENTYVIO,

1349
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
the only biologic developed
and approved

1350
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
just for UC and Crohn's.

1351
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
ENTYVIO works by focusing right
in the GI-tract

1352
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
to help control damaging
inflammation

1353
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
and is clinically proven to
begin helping many patients

1354
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
achieve both symptom relief as
well as remission.

1355
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Infusion and serious allergic
reactions

1356
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
can happen during or after
treatment.

1357
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
ENTYVIO may increase risk of
infection,

1358
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
which can be serious.

1359
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
While not reported with ENTYVIO,
PML, a rare,

1360
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
serious brain infection caused
by a virus may be possible.

1361
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Tell your doctor if you have
an infection,

1362
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
experience frequent infections,

1363
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
or have flu-like symptoms,
or sores.

1364
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Liver problems can occur
with ENTYVIO.

1365
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
If your UC or Crohn's medication
isn't working for you,

1366
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
ask your gastroenterologist
about ENTYVIO.

1367
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,000
ENTYVIO. Relief and remission
within reach.

1368
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's OK

1369
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
that everybody
ignores me
when I drive.

1370
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
It's fine, 'cause I get
a Safe Driving Bonus Check

1371
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
every six months
I'm accident-free.

1372
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And I don't share it
with Mom. Right, Mom?

1373
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Right.

1374
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Safe Driving Bonus Checks,

1375
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
only from Allstate.

1376
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Switching to Allstate
is worth it.

1377
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
>> Shepard: THE ASTRONAUTS ON

1378
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000

IT'S A 58-FOOT ARM THAT HELPS

1383

ONE OF THE TWO HANDS

00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
AGO AND ASTRONAUTS OUT

CAN GRAB A SUPPLY SHIP SCHEDULED

WE HAVE A LOT OF FINANCIAL
PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THIS

WOULDN'T BE HERE.

1411
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
TODAY THE ANSWER IS UP.

IT'S UP ALSO HALF A POINT.

1413
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000

WHY IS IT ALL UP?

1416
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
BECAUSE CAVUTO IS IN CHARGE.

1417
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000

WE MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A PUSH TO

THIS WITH SPEAKER PAUL RYAN

WRAPPING UP REMARKS EARLIER ON

IN MARYLAND WHERE HE WAS

1434
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
ACTUALLY PUSHING FOR TAX CUTS.

1435
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
THE HOUSE APPROVED A BUDGET SORT

1436
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000

IN THE COURSE OF HIS REMARKS,

BESIDES PUSHING FOR TAX CUTS
