NO SECURITY SCREENING.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
>> BECAUSE THERE IS UNRESTRICTED
ACCESS TO THE RACE COURSE,

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S 28 MILES

40

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
NOTHING, AND HE IS NOT

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
CONSIDERED A SUSPECT.

188
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000

IT'S A PAINFUL ONE.

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
THIS, BRIAN, SOME EXTRAORDINARY

326
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
STORIES OF GRACE AND KINDNESS

327
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THAT PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN, BOTH

>> I HEARD YOUR PUBLIC PLEA,

332
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
GOVERNOR, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS

333
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HELPED BY AN ARMY SERGEANT JUST

334
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN.

335

REUNITE HIM WITH HER.

337
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE

338
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
LOSE YOU.

339
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
AND THAT IS, IT WAS STRIKING
YESTERDAY, THIS HAPPENED WITH

340
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
BOSTON PD OFFICERS IN THE

341
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
FOREGROUND, MEANING IF YOU CAN

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
GET A DEVICE INTO AN ALREADY

343
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
SECURED AREA, WHAT'S THAT GOING

344
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
TO MEAN FOR DEFENDING CITIES

345
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
LIKE BOSTON?

346
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
>> WELL, I THINK THE THING TO

347
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
REMEMBER HERE -- MAYBE TWO
THINGS TO REMEMBER.

348
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
FIRST OF ALL, THE FIRST JOB OF

349
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
EVERYBODY IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO

350
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED

351
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
AND PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED AND

352
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
TO BRING THAT PERSON OR PERSONS

353
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
TO JUSTICE.

354
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

355
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
IS FOCUSED ON.

356
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THE SECOND THING, THEN, IS TO
SORT OUT HOW THIS COULD HAVE

357
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
HAPPENED.

358
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD 116 YEARS OF

359
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
INCIDENT-FREE MARATHONS.

360
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE LEARNED

361
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
LESSONS FROM THE ONE BEFORE.

362
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE AND

363
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
BLOODY LESSON WE'RE HAVING TO

364
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
LEARN THIS TIME.

365
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
BUT I AM ALSO CONFIDENT THAT WE

366
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WILL LEARN WHAT LESSONS THERE

367
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ARE TO BE LEARNED, AND NEXT

368
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
YEAR'S MARATHON WILL BE BIGGER

369
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

370
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000

FOR A TIME, THE ENTIRE AIRLINE

GROUNDED ITS FLEET.

476
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THEY SAID IT WAS A GLITCH AND

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
NOT A HACK.
AMERICAN TERMINALS AROUND THE

478
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
