[000:02:13;249] ROSE GARDEN, HE SUGGESTED THERE
[000:02:13;883] SHOULD BE RETALIATION.
[000:02:14;784] >> THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE

[000:02:17;353] TOLERATED.

[000:02:26;229] TWEETING "SYRIA IS NOT OUR
[000:02:27;831] PROBLEM" WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:02:29;332] PROPOSED PROTECTING CIVILIANS.
[000:02:32;969] AND AFTER ASSAD'S MASSIVE
[000:02:34;070] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN 2013,
[000:02:36;072] HE TWEETED "DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA,
[000:02:37;640] FIX U.S.A."
[000:02:40;777] ADDING, "IF YOU DO MANY BAD
[000:02:42;312] THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT
[000:02:43;847] FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!"
[000:02:46;482] BUT NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS
[000:02:47;517] THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES HAVE
[000:02:49;085] CHANGED HIS VIEWS ON THE ASSAD
[000:02:50;153] REGIME.

[000:03:07;270] AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
[000:03:07;837] FLEXIBILITY.
[000:03:10;473] AND I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK
[000:03:12;008] ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY, HAD A BIG
[000:03:12;642] IMPACT ON ME.
[000:03:15;144] BIG IMPACT.
[000:03:17;714] AND IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE,
[000:03:21;150] AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S
[000:03:22;385] ALREADY HAPPENED, THAT MY
[000:03:26;055] ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD
[000:03:26;689] HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

[000:03:29;158] PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE
[000:03:31;194] HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT
[000:03:32;729] ACKNOWLEDGES IT'S NOW HIS

[000:03:46;843] YOU IF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS
[000:03:48;845] CROSSES A RED LINE FOR YOU?
[000:03:50;413] >> IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
[000:03:51;047] ME.
[000:03:53;049] WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
[000:03:56;219] INNOCENT BABIES -- BABIES,
[000:03:59;822] LITTLE BABIES -- WITH A CHEMICAL
[000:04:00;857] GAS THAT IS SO LETHAL.
[000:04:04;460] PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT
[000:04:08;131] GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES MANY,
[000:04:10;166] MANY LINES, BEYOND A RED LINE.
[000:04:10;767] MANY, MANY LINES.
[000:04:11;234] >> Reporter: BUT HE GAVE NO
[000:04:11;801] INDICATION OF WHAT HE MAY DO.
[000:04:14;904] >> WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS I
[000:04:15;505] THINK YOU'VE NOTICED ABOUT ME IS
[000:04:17;507] MILITARILY, I DON'T LIKE TO SAY
[000:04:20;610] WHERE I'M GOING AND WHAT I'M
[000:04:21;210] DOING.
[000:04:22;178] I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
[000:04:24;747] ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
[000:04:25;348] BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
[000:04:25;982] BE TELLING YOU.
[000:04:26;349] >> Reporter: TODAY, KING
[000:04:27;417] ABDULLAH MADE IT CLEAR, THE
[000:04:28;384] WORLD IS LOOKING TO PRESIDENT
[000:04:28;985] TRUMP.

[000:04:34;624] UNRAVEL THIS VERY COMPLICATED
[000:04:35;224] SITUATION.
[000:04:37;327] >> Reporter: AND THE PRESIDENT,
[000:04:37;961] WHILE AGAIN BLAMING HIS
[000:04:38;828] PREDECESSOR, IS PROMISING TO
[000:04:39;429] TAKE ACTION.

[000:04:55;945] LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:04:56;612] THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR HE
[000:04:57;480] WON'T SAY WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
[000:04:58;581] BUT DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF TIME
[000:04:59;215] LINE FOR POSSIBLE ACTION HERE?
[000:05:01;217] >> WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY
[000:05:01;818] THIS IS VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA.
[000:05:03;753] IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
[000:05:05;822] CHAIRED A MEETING OF HIS
[000:05:06;889] NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY
[000:05:08;391] HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE

[000:05:23;539] NOT ONLY A RED LINE, BUT SEVERAL
[000:05:26;109] LINES.
[000:05:26;309] WE ALSO SAW U.N. AMBASSADOR
[000:05:27;143] NIKKI HALEY HOLDING UP PICTURES
[000:05:28;244] TODAY SAYING, IF THE U.N.
[000:05:29;245] DOESN'T ACT THE U.S. MAY HAVE
[000:05:30;313] TO.
[000:05:31;347] >> HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE
[000:05:33;950] TO DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?
[000:05:35;485] THE UNITED STATES SEES
[000:05:37;086] YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AS A DISGRACE
[000:05:38;121] AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.
[000:05:42;759] AN ASSURANCE THAT HUMANITY MEANS
[000:05:43;826] NOTHING TO THE SYRIAN
[000:05:44;360] GOVERNMENT.
[000:05:45;862] WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS
[000:05:54;203] CONSISTENTLY FAILS IN ITS DUTY
[000:05:58;408] TO ACT COLLECTIVELY, THERE ARE
[000:05:59;442] TIMES WHERE WE ARE COMPELLED TO
[000:06:00;510] TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.
[000:06:01;477] >>> I WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA
[000:06:02;545] RADDATZ, WITH US TONIGHT.
[000:06:06;716] YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE
[000:06:07;316] SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
[000:06:08;284] HAS CHANGED.
[000:06:09;786] WE JUST HEARD AMBASSADOR HALEY
[000:06:10;820] SAY, AT TIMES WE'RE QUOTE,
[000:06:11;387] COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN
[000:06:11;921] ACTION.
[000:06:17;093] FOR AMERICANS AT HOME TONIGHT
[000:06:17;693] WONDERING WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN,
[000:06:21;297] WHAT'S NEXT?
[000:06:22;298] >> WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE?
[000:06:23;332] DO THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER
[000:06:23;966] ATTACKS?
[000:06:24;400] DO THEY JUST WANT TO PUNISH OR
[000:06:29;105] DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
[000:06:29;672] BASHAR AL ASSAD?
[000:06:30;640] WE DON'T KNOW.
[000:06:31;707] IN 2013, THERE WERE ARRAY OF AIR
[000:06:33;409] STRIKES WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:06:34;010] SAID THEY CROSSED THE RED LINE.
[000:06:34;811] THEY DIDN'T USE THEM.
[000:06:35;311] THEY STILL HAD THAT
[000:06:36;379] INTELLIGENCE.
[000:06:39;482] BUT MOST OF THOSE CHEMICAL
[000:06:43;653] WEAPONS, THE STOCKPILES, ARE
[000:06:44;253] GONE SO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:06:44;854] USED HERE WERE HIDDEN.
[000:06:45;755] THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.
[000:06:46;322] >> AND AS WE HEARD, THEY MET
[000:06:47;256] WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
[000:06:47;890] TODAY.
[000:06:49;759] MARTHA, THANK YOU.

[000:15:23;739] swelling and joint damage,
[000:15:25;441] even without methotrexate.
[000:15:27;009] XELJANZ XR can lower your

[000:15:29;979] including tuberculosis.
[000:15:31;213] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:15:31;213] infections,
[000:15:33;515] lymphoma and other cancers have

[000:15:35;751] Don't start XELJANZ XR if you
[000:15:35;751] have an infection.

[000:15:44;293] Your doctor should perform blood
[000:15:44;293] tests before you
[000:15:46;462] start and while taking XELJANZ
[000:15:46;462] XR, and monitor
[000:15:49;465] certain liver tests. Tell your
[000:15:49;465] doctor if you were
[000:15:51;533] in a region where fungal
[000:15:51;533] infections are common

[000:23:37;032] Nice to meet you too.
[000:23:38;200] Your parents have been
[000:23:38;200] talking about you for years.
[000:23:40;135] Sorry about that.
[000:23:41;236] They're all about me
[000:23:41;236] saving for a house,
[000:23:43;338] or starting a
[000:23:43;338] college fund for my son.
[000:23:45;440] Actually, I want to
[000:23:45;440] know what you're thinking.
[000:23:49;277] Have a seat.
[000:23:50;912] Knowing that the most
[000:23:50;912] important goals are yours.
[000:23:54;149] Multiplied by 14,000 financial
[000:23:54;149] advisors, it's a big deal.
[000:23:59;020] And it's how Edward Jones
[000:23:59;020] makes sense of investing.
[000:24:04;059] I'm 51 years old.m.
[000:24:05;794] When I was diagnosed with
[000:24:06;995] pneumococcal pneumonia,
[000:24:08;597] it was huge for everybody.
[000:24:10;599] She just started to

[000:24:13;535] I was rushed to the hospital...
[000:24:15;737] My symptoms were devastating.
[000:24:17;939] The doctor said, "Pam!
[000:24:19;241] If you'd have waited
[000:24:19;241] two more days,
[000:24:21;109] you would've died."
[000:24:23;345] If I'd have known that a vaccine
[000:24:25;113] could have helped prevent this,
[000:24:26;581] I would have asked my doctor
[000:24:27;716] or pharmacist about it.

[000:25:05;887] products I've used.
[000:25:07;989] Enough!
[000:25:09;524] I've tried enough laxatives
[000:25:10;926] to cover
[000:25:10;926] the Eastern Seaboard.
[000:25:13;695] I've climbed a Mount Everest
[000:25:13;695] of fiber.
[000:25:16;698] Probiotics?
[000:25:16;698] Enough!
[000:25:18;366] (AVO)
[000:25:18;366] If you've had enough,
[000:25:18;366] tell your doctor
[000:25:20;135] what you've tried
[000:25:20;135] and how long you've been at it.
[000:25:22;404] LINZESS works differently
[000:25:23;738] from laxatives.
[000:25:24;839] LINZESS treats adults
[000:25:25;941] with IBS with Constipation
[000:25:27;542] or Chronic Constipation.
[000:25:29;177] It can help
[000:25:29;177] relieve your belly pain,
[000:25:30;712] and lets you have more frequent
[000:25:30;712] and complete bowel movements
[000:25:32;881] that are easier to pass.
[000:25:35;016] Do not give LINZESS
[000:25:35;016] to children under six,
[000:25:36;918] and it should not be given
[000:25:36;918] to children
[000:25:38;119] six to less than eighteen.
[000:25:38;119] It may harm them.
[000:25:40;522] Don't take LINZESS if you have
[000:25:40;522] a bowel blockage.
[000:25:42;924] Get immediate help
[000:25:42;924] if you develop unusual
[000:25:44;793] or severe stomach pain,
[000:25:46;061] especially with bloody
[000:25:46;061] or black stools.
[000:25:48;163] The most common side effect
[000:25:48;163] is diarrhea, sometimes severe.
[000:25:51;399] If it's severe
[000:25:51;399] stop taking LINZESS
[000:25:53;335] and call your doctor right away.
[000:25:55;070] Other side effects include gas,
[000:25:56;538] stomach-area pain
[000:25:56;538] and swelling.
[000:25:58;440] Talk to your doctor about
[000:25:59;708] managing your symptoms
[000:26:00;709] proactively with LINZESS.
