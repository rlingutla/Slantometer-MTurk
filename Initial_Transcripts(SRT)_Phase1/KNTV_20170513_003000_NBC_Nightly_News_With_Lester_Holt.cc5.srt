COMEY'S IDEA.
>> I HAD A DINNER WITH

HIM.

284
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
HE WANTED TO HAVE
DINNER BECAUSE HE

>> THE DINNER WAS
ARRANGED.

291
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I THINK HE ASKED FOR

292
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THE DINNER, AND HE
WANTED TO STAY ON AS

293
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THE FBI HEAD, AND I
