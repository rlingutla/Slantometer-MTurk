[000:00:03;319] DEPLOYED SPIKE STRIPS TO SLOW IT
[000:00:05;522] DOWN.
[000:00:05;889] COPS CATCHING UP WITH AND
[000:00:07;791] ARRESTING THE SUSPECT.
[000:00:08;992] THE DRIVER WAS SUSPECTED TO BE
[000:00:14;631] UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS.
[000:00:17;967] HERE'S BILL HEMMER FOR SHEP.
[000:00:21;071] >> IT'S 3:00 P.M. ON THE EAST
[000:00:24;974] COAST.
[000:00:25;608] SUSAN RICE IS TALKING AFTER SHE
[000:00:28;945] REQUESTED NAMES OF TRUMP
[000:00:30;980] UP IN
[000:00:32;782] SURVEILLANCE.
[000:00:33;216] RICE SAID SHE HAD TO ASK FOR
[000:00:36;453] CERTAIN NAMES TO DO HER JOB.
[000:00:38;488] DEMOCRATS SAY THIS IS TO DRAW
[000:00:40;290] ATTENTION OF THE REAL ISSUE
[000:00:41;958] ABOUT LINKS BETWEEN THE TRUMP
[000:00:43;460] ADMINISTRATION AND MOSCOW.
[000:00:44;761] THE FACTS AHEAD IN A MOMENTS.
[000:00:46;696] IT'S TIME FOR A SHOW DOWN OVER
[000:00:48;965] THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.
[000:00:56;005] DEMOCRATS HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO
[000:00:59;976] BLOCK NEIL GORSUCH.
[000:01:01;644] WILL REPUBLICANS FOLLOW-THROUGH
[000:01:04;481] ON THE NUCLEAR OPTION?
[000:01:06;282] AND ALSO REPUBLICANS TRYING TO
[000:01:08;318] REPEAL OBAMACARE.
[000:01:08;952] THAT IDEA WENT DOWN IN FLAMES
[000:01:10;220] TWO WEEKS AGO.
[000:01:10;987] NOW A NEW PLAN IS RISING FROM
[000:01:12;655] THE ASHES OF THE SWAMP.
[000:01:14;824] IN MINUTES YOU'LL HEAR FROM A
[000:01:17;594] CONSERVATIVE GROUP WHOSE SUPPORT
[000:01:18;962] MIGHT MAKE OR BREAK THE PLAN.
[000:01:20;263] THAT'S AHEAD IN A VERY BUSY 3:00
[000:01:23;633] HOUR STARTING NOW.
[000:01:29;339] I'M BILL HEMMER.
[000:01:30;640] GOOD DAY.
[000:01:31;908] IN FOR SHEPARD SMITH, WE BEGIN
[000:01:33;843] WITH THE SHOW DOWN OVER
[000:01:35;378] SURVEILLANCE IN THE NATION'S
[000:01:37;647] CAPITOL.
[000:01:37;981] SUSAN RICE IS CALLING
[000:01:40;283] ACCUSATIONS SHE MISHANDLED
[000:01:42;218] INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION AND
[000:01:43;319] TARGETED MEMBERS OF TRUMP TEAM
[000:01:44;821] FALSE.
[000:01:45;155] RICE RESPONDING AFTER FOX NEWS
[000:01:46;723] AND OTHER NEWS OUTLETS SAID WHO
[000:01:49;793] IS THE ONE THAT ASKED OFFICIALS
[000:01:51;594] FOR THE NAMES OF TRUMP
[000:01:53;897] ASSOCIATES CAUGHT UP IN
[000:01:55;331] SURVEILLANCE.
[000:01:55;765] THAT MEANS REVEALING THE NAMES
[000:01:57;934] IN INTELLIGENCE REPORTS NOT TO
[000:01:59;002] THE PUBLIC.
[000:01:59;736] HERE'S SUSAN RICE.
[000:02:00;603] >> THERE WERE OCCASIONS WHEN I
[000:02:02;539] WOULD RECEIVE A REPORT IN WHICH
[000:02:05;809] A U.S. PERSON WAS REFERRED TO.
[000:02:09;846] NAME NOT PROVIDED.
[000:02:13;917] JUST U.S. PERSON.
[000:02:16;586] SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
[000:02:17;654] THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REPORT AND
[000:02:20;156] ACCESS ITS SIGNIFICANCE, IT WAS
[000:02:22;859] NECESSARY TO FIND OUT AS TO WHO
[000:02:24;460] THE U.S. OFFICIAL WAS.
[000:02:25;762] >> MORE IN THAT INTERVIEW IN
[000:02:27;397] JUST A MOMENT.
[000:02:27;864] RICE SAYING SHE AND OTHER
[000:02:30;333] OFFICIALS WOULD REQUEST THE
[000:02:31;034] INFORMATION ONLY TO PROTECT THE
[000:02:32;402] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:02:33;203] SHE SAID SHE NEVER DID IT FOR
[000:02:34;838] POLITICAL PURPOSES AND SHE NEVER
[000:02:37;440] LEAKED ANY INFORMATION TO
[000:02:38;575] ANYBODY, HER WORDS EARLIER
[000:02:39;943] TODAY.
[000:02:40;410] ALL THIS COMING AFTER HOUSE
[000:02:43;279] INTELLIGENCE CHAIRMAN DEVIN
[000:02:44;380] NUNES TOLD REPORTERS THAT TRUMP
[000:02:45;782] TRANSITION OFFICIALS AND EVEN
[000:02:47;617] THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF MAY HAVE
[000:02:49;219] GOTTEN SWEPT UP IN SURVEILLANCE
[000:02:50;720] OF FOREIGNERS.
[000:02:52;388] WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED TWO WHITE
[000:02:54;224] HOUSE OFFICIALS HELPED GET NUNES
[000:02:56;492] THE INFORMATION WHICH HE SHARED
[000:02:58;194] WITH THE PRESIDENT BEFORE THE
[000:02:59;495] REST OF HIS OWN COMMITTEE.
[000:03:02;665] CATHERINE HERRIDGE SPEAKING WITH
[000:03:03;466] CHAIRMAN NUNES EARLIER TODAY.
[000:03:05;468] SHE'LL HAVE MORE ON THOSE
[000:03:08;104] DEVELOPMENTS LATER THIS HOUR.
[000:03:09;305] AFTER MEETING WITH NUNES,
[000:03:11;674] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE FELT
[000:03:12;842] SOMEWHAT VINDICATED AFTER HE'S
[000:03:16;779] UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS THAT
[000:03:17;747] PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TAPPED TRUMP
[000:03:20;116] TOWER.
[000:03:20;416] EVEN THOUGH NUNES SAID MANY
[000:03:21;885] TIMES THAT DID NOT HAPPEN, NUNES
[000:03:23;653] MET WITH THE PRESIDENT, SUSAN
[000:03:25;622] RICE TELLING PBS SHE HAD NO IDEA
[000:03:27;991] WHAT THE CHAIRMAN WAS TALKING
[000:03:31;261] ABOUT.
[000:03:31;561] >> I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.
[000:03:33;730] I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE REPORTS
[000:03:36;900] FROM CHAIRMAN NUNES ON THAT
[000:03:37;867] COUNT TODAY.
[000:03:38;501] I REALLY DON'T KNOW TO WHAT
[000:03:41;537] CHAIRMAN NUNES WAS REFERRING.
[000:03:43;473] BUT HE SAID THAT WHATEVER HE WAS
[000:03:46;876] REFERRING TO WAS ILLEGAL LAWFUL
[000:03:52;515] SURVEILLANCE AND IT WAS
[000:03:54;384] POTENTIALLY INCIDENTAL
[000:03:55;585] COLLECTION ON ACITIZENS.
[000:03:57;020] >> SO THAT INTERVIEW FROM 13
[000:03:58;922] DAYS AGO IS NOW GETTING A SECOND
[000:04:01;724] LOOK TODAY.
[000:04:02;759] TODAY SUSAN RICE SAYS SHE DOES
[000:04:05;061] NOT KNOW WHAT INFORMATION NUNES
[000:04:06;496] RECEIVED AND SHE WOULD NOT GET
[000:04:08;231] IN SPECIFICS ON ANY REPORTING.
[000:04:10;233] I SPOKE WITH SOUTH CAROLINA
[000:04:11;801] SENATOR LINDSEY GRAMMARLIER
[000:04:14;103] TODAY ON AMERICA'S NEWSROOM.
[000:04:15;772] HE SAID THAT HE WANTS LAWMAKERS
[000:04:17;640] TO LOOK INTO RICE AND THE ENTIRE
[000:04:20;176] BUSINESS OF UNMASKING.
[000:04:22;078] >> AND TERMS OF POLITICAL
[000:04:24;147] MANIPULATION OF NATIONAL
[000:04:25;181] SECURITY INFORMATION, SUSAN RICE
[000:04:27;016] IN MY VIEW HAS DONE IT IN THE
[000:04:28;885] PAST.
[000:04:29;185] WHETHER OR NOT SHE DID IT THIS
[000:04:31;120] TIME, I DON'T KNOW.
[000:04:31;688] IT'S SOMETHING CONGRESS SHOULD
[000:04:32;522] LOOK INTO.
[000:04:33;256] IF SHE WAS INVOLVED IN UNMASKING
[000:04:36;059] TRUMP TRANSITION FIGURES, WHAT
[000:04:37;427] WAS THE REASON AND WAS THERE A
[000:04:39;062] POLITICAL MOTIVE.
[000:04:39;862] I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT.
[000:04:41;130] WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.
[000:04:42;865] >> YOU HEARD THAT SENATOR GRAHAM
[000:04:45;368] SAID THAT RICE HAS MANIPULATED
[000:04:47;103] SECURITY INFORMATION IN THE
[000:04:48;871] PAST.
[000:04:49;706] AFTER THE ATTACK IN BENGHAZI,
[000:04:52;241] SHE WENT ON THE SUNDAY TALK
[000:04:53;476] SHOWS AND SAID BASED ON THE
[000:04:55;244] INTELLIGENCE AT THAT TIME, IT
[000:04:56;746] LOOKED LIKE A SPONTANEOUS
[000:04:58;181] RESPONSE TO PROTESTS OVER AN
[000:04:59;816] ANTI MUSLIM VIDEO AND NOT A
[000:05:02;585] TERROR ATTACK.
[000:05:03;853] PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW HAS REFERRED
[000:05:05;021] TO THE UNMASKING AS THE REAL
[000:05:07;423] STORY ON RUSSIA.
[000:05:09;225] DEMOCRATS SAY IT'S A DISTRACTION
[000:05:10;493] FROM THE BIGGER ISSUE THEY ARGUE
[000:05:12;128] ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO
[000:05:13;696] TEAM TRUMP AND POTENTIAL
[000:05:15;365] COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN
[000:05:16;499] GOVERNMENT.
[000:05:16;899] YOU GOT THAT?
[000:05:19;202] IT'S A MOUTHFUL.
[000:05:21;371] JOHN ROBERTS ON FOX'S TOP STORY
[000:05:22;905] LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:05:24;240] GOOD DAY TO YOU.
[000:05:25;541] SO WHAT ELSE DID SUSAN RICE SAID
[000:05:28;144] ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED UNMASKING?
[000:05:30;613] >> BILL, WHEN IS IT NOT A
[000:05:32;782] MOUTHFUL TO DIGEST EVERYTHING
[000:05:34;217] THAT HAPPENED HERE DAILY?
[000:05:35;518] INTERESTING TO LOOK AS YOU POINT
[000:05:37;320] OUT, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT
[000:05:39;555] SHE SAID TODAY COMPARED TO THE
[000:05:42;025] PBS INTERVIEW ON MARCH 22 WHEN
[000:05:44;227] THERE WAS AN UTTER DENIAL OF
[000:05:45;661] ANYTHING THAT DEVIN NUNES WAS
[000:05:47;764] TALKING ABOUT.
[000:05:49;499] TODAY NO DENIAL THAT SHE'S THE
[000:05:50;867] PERSON THAT ASKED FOR THE NAMES
[000:05:52;268] TO BE UNMASKED IN INTELLIGENCE
[000:05:55;104] REPORTS BUT THAT FIRM DENIAL
[000:05:56;539] THAT ANY OF THIS WAS DONE FOR
[000:05:58;007] POLITICAL PURPOSES OR SHE LEAKED
[000:05:59;409] ANY ONE'S NAME.
[000:06:01;477] LISTEN HERE.
[000:06:02;078] >> IT'S IN THAT PROCESS AND
[000:06:03;413] WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE TRUMP
[000:06:05;948] CAMPAIGN, THE TRUMP TRANSITION,
[000:06:08;684] DID YOU SEEK THE NAMES OF PEOPLE
[000:06:11;287] INVOLVED IN -- DID YOU UNMASK
[000:06:13;022] THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
[000:06:15;158] THE TRUMP TRANSITION, THE TRUMP
[000:06:16;993] CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE
[000:06:19;195] PRESIDENT-ELECT IN ORDER TO SPY
[000:06:20;229] ON THEM?
[000:06:21;264] >> ABSOLUTELY -- ABSOLUTELY NOT
[000:06:23;032] FOR ANY POLITICAL PURPOSES, TO
[000:06:25;501] SPY, EXPOSE, ANYTHING.
[000:06:27;670] >> SO THE WHITE HOUSE SUGGESTING
[000:06:29;105] THAT MOST OF THE MEDIA IS NOT
[000:06:31;307] GIVING THIS THE SENSE OF
[000:06:32;708] IMPORTANCE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:06:33;910] THINKS IT SHOULD HAVE.
[000:06:35;078] WE KNOW THAT SHE IS THE ONE,
[000:06:36;879] SUSAN RICE, THAT ASKED FOR SOME
[000:06:39;248] NAMES TO BE UNMASKED.
[000:06:40;950] WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS WHO LEAKED
[000:06:43;119] THE NAME OF LIEUTENANT GENERAL
[000:06:45;455] MICHAEL FLYNN, AN ACT THAT MAY
[000:06:47;423] CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS CRIME.
[000:06:48;257] >> IN RUSSIA, A REPORT OF A BACK
[000:06:50;660] CHANNEL.
[000:06:52;295] COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN VLADIMIR
[000:06:53;262] PUTIN AND A DONALD TRUMP DONOR.
[000:06:55;298] WHAT IS THE TRUTH ON THAT?
[000:06:57;300] >> IT'S HARD TO DISCERN.
[000:07:00;870] THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PERSON
[000:07:03;406] INVOLVED DENIED ANY KIND OF
[000:07:05;508] MEETING TO CREATE A CHANNEL
[000:07:07;043] BETWEEN THE TRUMP TRANSITION AND
[000:07:08;945] VLADIMIR PUTIN.
[000:07:09;412] THE PERSON AT THE CENTER OF THIS
[000:07:11;614] IS ERIC PRINCE, THE FOUNDER OF
[000:07:15;251] BLACK WATER SECURITY
[000:07:17;153] ORGANIZATION.
[000:07:17;720] A BIG CHECKERED PAST PUTTING
[000:07:21;724] CONTRACTORS IN IRAQ.
[000:07:22;859] HE'S THE BROTHER-IN-LAW OF BETSY
[000:07:25;361] DeVOS.
[000:07:25;795] WE'RE TOLD BY SOURCES THAT ON
[000:07:27;763] JANUARY 11th ERIC PRINCE MET
[000:07:30;266] WITH A RUSSIAN ENVOY AT THE FOUR
[000:07:32;468] SEASONS HOTEL.
[000:07:33;536] ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE
[000:07:35;605] MEETING SAID TO PE THAT THE
[000:07:38;040] UNITED ARAB EMIRATES WANTED TO
[000:07:40;243] CONVINCE PUTIN TO DIAL BACK ON
[000:07:41;744] HIS SUPPORT FOR IRAN AND SYRIA.
[000:07:44;647] AGAIN, THE WHITE HOUSE AND
[000:07:45;414] PRINCE DENYING ALL OF THIS.
[000:07:47;216] IT PRESENTS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM.
[000:07:51;787] THIS IS THE SORT OF THING THAT
[000:07:53;723] SUSAN RICE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF
[000:07:55;424] THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION COULD
[000:07:56;192] SAY WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT,
[000:07:57;226] WHICH IS WHY WE ASKED FOR THE
[000:08:00;596] UNMASKING.
[000:08:00;997] SEAN SPICER DISMISSING ALL OF
[000:08:02;865] THIS AS FLIMSY REPORTING SAYING
[000:08:04;867] I GUESS SOMEONE MAY HAVE VISITED
[000:08:06;836] AN ISLAND BUT THERE'S NO PROOF
[000:08:08;704] THAT THEY MET WITH AN INDIVIDUAL
[000:08:10;773] OR THAT THEY HAD ANY TIES OR THE
[000:08:12;341] DATE OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE
[000:08:14;710] MEETING.
[000:08:15;111] I THINK THAT IT'S FLIMSY AT
[000:08:18;981] BEST.
[000:08:19;282] >> A PRO RUSSIAN CONGRESSMAN SET
[000:08:22;385] TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:08:23;819] TODAY.
[000:08:24;120] WHO IS THAT AND WHAT IS THE
[000:08:26;556] MEETING ABOUT?
[000:08:26;989] >> DANA RORBACHER WILL BE HERE.
[000:08:32;628] HE'S AN ADVOCATE OF IMPROVING
[000:08:39;368] THE RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND
[000:08:44;507] THE UNITED STATES.
[000:08:45;875] DANA RORBACHER SAID IT'S A
[000:08:48;945] BROUHAHA OVER NOTHING.
[000:08:49;545] HE SAID "WHAT IS HAPPENING IS
[000:08:51;781] YOU HAVE THE FAKE NEWS AVALANCHE
[000:08:53;482] TRYING TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION
[000:08:55;184] THAT SOMETHING SINISTER IS
[000:08:56;419] HAPPENING WITH RUSSIA AND THAT
[000:08:57;353] IS PREVENTING US FROM
[000:08:59;288] NEGOTIATING AND GETTING INTO A
[000:09:00;389] REAL RELATIONSHIP WHERE WE CAN
[000:09:02;325] DO SOME GOOD BY WORKING TOGETHER
[000:09:03;559] WITH RUSSIA."
[000:09:04;694] THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE WOULD
[000:09:06;128] LIKE TO WORK WITH RUSSIA ON
[000:09:07;663] DEFEATING ISIS.
[000:09:09;865] WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA WITH
[000:09:13;102] AL-ASSAD COULD COMPLICATE
[000:09:18;074] THINGS.
[000:09:18;407] >> THANKS, JOHN.
[000:09:19;242] WANT TO LOOK AT THIS NOW FROM
[000:09:22;044] BOTH SIDES.
[000:09:22;645] A FORMER DEMOCRATIC LEADER IS AN
[000:09:25;615] EXECUTIVE RESIDENT AT THE
[000:09:27;683] AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PUBLIC
[000:09:29;118] AFFAIRS.
[000:09:29;452] NED RYAN, FOUNDER AND CEO OF
[000:09:31;887] AMERICAN MAJORITY, A POLITICAL
[000:09:34;423] TRAINING INSTITUTE AND FORMER
[000:09:36;192] WRITER FOR GEORGE BUSH.
[000:09:37;159] GOOD DAY TO BOTH OF YOU.
[000:09:39;895] ST. THE STORY CHANGING WITH
[000:09:43;199] REGARD TO SUSAN RICE GIVEN THAT
[000:09:44;934] INTERVIEW ON MSNBC?
[000:09:47;236] >> YOU'LL HAVE TO PARDON ME OF
[000:09:49;238] BEING SKEPTICAL OF SOMEONE THAT
[000:09:50;473] LIED ABOUT THE BENGHAZI VIDEO
[000:09:52;308] AND A FEW WEEKS AGO CLAIMED NO
[000:09:56;045] KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT CONGRESSMAN
[000:09:57;113] NUNES IS TALKING ABOUT AND NOW
[000:09:59;849] LO AND BEHOLD, SHE'S CLAIMING
[000:10:01;350] SHE KNOWS NOTHING.
[000:10:02;418] I'M SKEPTICAL OF HOW HONEST
[000:10:05;187] SUSAN RICE IS BEING.
[000:10:06;389] HERE'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO
[000:10:07;990] FIGURE OUT.
[000:10:08;491] THIS APPEARS TO BE COORDINATED,
[000:10:11;394] SYSTEMATIC.
[000:10:11;794] THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING TO
[000:10:13;095] ME, BILL, BASED OFF OF SOME OF
[000:10:15;464] THESE RECORDS, ACCORDING TO FISA
[000:10:17;500] COURT RULE AND NSA POLICIES, ANY
[000:10:19;935] INCIDENTAL COMMUNICATIONS
[000:10:21;604] COLLECTED THAT ARE NOT SPECIFIC
[000:10:22;705] TO THE INVESTIGATION ARE TO BE
[000:10:25;508] DISCARDED.
[000:10:26;842] BASED OFF THE REPORTS THAT WE'RE
[000:10:28;411] HEARING, NOT ONLY ARE THE
[000:10:30;179] INCIDENTAL COMMUNICATIONS THAT
[000:10:31;147] HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA,
[000:10:32;948] NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT DISCARDED,
[000:10:35;084] NAMES WERE UNMASKED AND PUT IN
[000:10:37;186] THE REPORTS AND WIDELY
[000:10:38;921] DISSEMINATED.
[000:10:39;355] THAT'S A PROBLEM.
[000:10:39;889] I HOPE AT THE END OF DAY AND
[000:10:41;490] WE'RE GOING TO -- I FEEL LIKE
[000:10:43;225] WE'RE PEELING BACK AN ONION
[000:10:45;728] EVERY DAY.
[000:10:46;662] THERE'S --
[000:10:47;229] >> YOU'RE NOT FAR FROM OFF ON
[000:10:48;798] THAT.
[000:10:49;098] A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THIS
[000:10:51;267] IS REFERRED SURVEILLANCE.
[000:10:54;403] QUICKLY.
[000:10:54;737] >> I WOULD ARGUE, THERE'S REAL
[000:10:56;405] QUESTIONS IS THIS REVERSE
[000:10:58;307] SURVEILLANCE.
[000:10:59;108] DID THE PARTY IN POWER WEAPONIZE
[000:11:01;177] THE STATE AGAINST THE OPPOSING
[000:11:03;546] PARTY?
[000:11:03;846] THESE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS
[000:11:05;181] AND SERIOUS QUESTIONS BEING
[000:11:07;049] RAISED.
[000:11:07;383] I WOULD LIKE SUSAN RICE TO GO
[000:11:09;185] UNDER OATH, GO UP TO THE HILL IN
[000:11:10;986] FRONT OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE
[000:11:18;194] COMMITTEE AND GIVE ANSWERS.
[000:11:19;328] >> CAPRI, HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS
[000:11:21;030] IS NOW?
[000:11:21;564] >> WHAT A MESS THIS IS FOR THE
[000:11:23;265] AMERICAN PUBLIC, FOR OUR
[000:11:24;800] CREDIBILITY.
[000:11:25;201] I THINK CREDIBILITY HERE IS A
[000:11:26;669] HUGE ISSUE.
[000:11:28;704] YOU HAVE SUSAN RICE WHO AS THE
[000:11:30;840] OTHER GUEST JUST MENTIONED HAD
[000:11:33;309] CREDIBILITY QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF
[000:11:34;110] THE HISTORY WITH BENGHAZI.
[000:11:35;578] THEN YOU HAVE THE ISSUE OF DEVIN
[000:11:37;780] NUNES AND HIS CLOUD OF
[000:11:39;648] CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING WHETHER
[000:11:40;716] OR NOT HE WAS POLITICALLY
[000:11:43;018] MOTIVATED.
[000:11:43;386] YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE COOKING IN
[000:11:44;687] THE KITCHEN THAT DON'T
[000:11:46;188] NECESSARILY HAVE GREAT
[000:11:47;123] CREDIBILITY IN ADDRESSING THIS
[000:11:48;657] ISSUE.
[000:11:48;991] AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE
[000:11:50;526] AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE ANSWERS.
[000:11:53;496] THEY DESERVE ANSWERS --
[000:11:55;965] >> MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME.
[000:11:59;769] >> FROM MARCH 22, JUDY WOODRUFF
[000:12:08;077] ASKED SUSAN RICE ABOUT BEING
[000:12:09;445] SWEPT UP IN THE SURVEILLANCE.
[000:12:11;180] HER ANSWER IS "I KNOW NOTHING
[000:12:14;450] ABOUT THIS."
[000:12:15;317] I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THE
[000:12:16;519] REPORTS FROM CHAIRMAN NUNES.
[000:12:21;757] >> I CAN MAKE THAT REQUEST.
[000:12:23;759] THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
[000:12:25;561] PROCESSED THAT REQUEST THROUGH
[000:12:26;529] THEIR NORMAL PROCEDURES AND IF
[000:12:28;664] THEY FEEL THEY CAN GIVE THE
[000:12:30;032] ANSWER, THEY WILL GIVE THE
[000:12:31;100] ANSWER.
[000:12:31;434] THAT COMES BACK TO ME, NOT TO
[000:12:34;270] ANYBODY BROADLY IN THE NATIONAL
[000:12:36;972] SECURITY WORLD.
[000:12:37;540] THAT IS NECESSARY FOR ME TO DO
[000:12:39;008] MY JOB.
[000:12:40;109] >> DID YOU SEEK THE NAMES OF
[000:12:42;645] PEOPLE INVOLVED IN -- TO UNMASK
[000:12:44;447] THE NAMES OF PEOPLE INVOLVED IN
[000:12:45;948] THE TRUMP TRANSITION, THE TRUMP
[000:12:48;517] CAMPAIGN, PEOPLE SURROUNDING THE
[000:12:50;553] PRESIDENT-ELECT IN ORDER TO SPY
[000:12:52;755] ON THEM?
[000:12:53;789] >> ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR ANY
[000:12:56;625] POLITICAL PURPOSES, TO SPY,
[000:12:58;994] EXPOSE, ANYTHING.
[000:12:59;595] >> TWO WEEKS LATER, A COMPLETELY
[000:13:01;497] DIFFERENT ANSWER.
[000:13:02;465] ANDREA MITCHELL HAD THE RIGHT
[000:13:04;066] QUESTION.
[000:13:04;500] DID YOU USE THIS INFORMATION TO
[000:13:05;801] SPY.
[000:13:06;068] >> NO.
[000:13:06;669] THIS IS THE THING.
[000:13:08;437] IF IT LOOKS LIKE AND APPEARS
[000:13:09;972] THIS WAY THAT TRUMP AND HIS
[000:13:11;273] TRANSITION TEAM WERE TARGETED,
[000:13:12;708] IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
[000:13:14;076] RUSSIA, THAT THERE WAS A
[000:13:16;145] POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
[000:13:17;947] OPERATION AND IT WAS WIDE BY
[000:13:20;783] DISSEMINATED.
[000:13:21;217] COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT
[000:13:23;385] THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE.
[000:13:24;487] WE'RE NOT JUST REALIZING IT'S
[000:13:27;256] SUSAN, HER DEPUTY, BEN RHODES AS
[000:13:29;258] WELL.
[000:13:29;658] I THINK THERE'S MORE NAMES
[000:13:30;926] COMING OUT.
[000:13:31;961] HERE'S THE THING.
[000:13:33;429] SUSAN RICE DID NOT ACT IN A
[000:13:35;397] VACUUM.
[000:13:35;731] SHE DID NOT DO THIS OF HER OWN
[000:13:39;568] VOLITION.
[000:13:39;935] THERE'S OTHERS INVOLVED.
[000:13:41;237] THE QUESTION IS HOW HIGH --
[000:13:43;072] >> NONE OF US HERE HAVE SECURITY
[000:13:46;642] CLEARANCE.
[000:13:47;009] WE HAVE NO WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND
[000:13:48;944] CLOSED DOOR.
[000:13:49;845] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE
[000:13:54;216] ANSWERS.
[000:13:54;550] WE NEED ANSWERS BOTH FROM SUSAN
[000:13:56;185] RICE AND ON THE RUSSIAN
[000:13:59;288] DEBACLE --
[000:13:59;788] >> TO BOTH OF YOU, THANK YOU.
[000:14:01;991] A QUICK BREAK HERE.
[000:14:03;325] IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO REVIVE
[000:14:05;060] THEIR PLAN TO REPEAL AND REPLACE
[000:14:08;230] OBAMACARE, THEY NEED
[000:14:09;465] CONSERVATIVE SUPPORT.
[000:14:10;432] IN A MOMENT, MEET THE LEADER OF
[000:14:12;801] A GROUP THAT MAY JUST GIVE THAT
[000:14:13;869] NEXT LIVE HERE.
[000:14:15;137] Fun in art class.
[000:14:22;811] Come close, come close.
[000:14:25;080] I like that.
[000:14:26;348] [ ALL SOUNDS COME TO A
[000:14:26;348] CRASHING HALT ]
[000:14:27;349] Ah.
[000:14:28;350] When your pain reliever
[000:14:28;350] stops working,
[000:14:31;453] your whole day stops.
[000:14:33;956] Awww.
[000:14:34;957] Try this.
[000:14:35;958] For minor arthritis pain,
[000:14:37;359] only Aleve is FDA

[000:14:39;528] for up to 12 straight hours

[000:14:42;131] Thank you.
[000:14:46;835] Come on everybody.
[000:14:48;604] Aleve.
[000:14:49;605] Live Whole.
[000:14:49;605] Not Part.
[000:16:23;565] Remember when you said
[000:16:23;565] men are supeYeah...ivers?
[000:16:24;266] Yeah, then how'd I get this...
[000:16:25;801] ...Allstate Safe
[000:16:25;801] Driving Bonus Check?
[000:16:27;536] ...only Allstate sends
[000:16:27;536] you a bonus check
[000:16:29;638] for every six months
[000:16:29;638] you're accident free.
[000:16:32;041] Silence.
[000:16:33;075] It's good to be IN, Good Hands.
[000:16:57;833] >> Bill: BREAKING NEWS ON WHAT
[000:17:00;235] MIGHT BE REPUBLICAN HOPES FOR
[000:17:01;870] REVIVING THE HEALTHCARE PLAN.
[000:17:04;406] THE INITIAL EFFORT TO REPEAL
[000:17:06;208] OBAMACARE FLOPPED TWO WEEKS AGO.
[000:17:08;711] NOW ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
[000:17:09;812] MOVING TO GET IT ANOTHER GO.
[000:17:10;946] THERE'S A LOT OF MEETINGS DAY
[000:17:12;614] AND NIGHT.
[000:17:13;348] MY GUEST MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER
[000:17:17;553] HELP.
[000:17:18;120] DAVID McINTOSH JOINS ME LIVE
[000:17:19;488] FROM WASHINGTON.
[000:17:22;257] SIR, GOOD DAY TO YOU.
[000:17:23;659] READY TO BREAK SOME NEWS?
[000:17:24;927] READY TO GET ON BOARD A NEW PLAN
[000:17:26;395] TO PASS IT OR NOT?
[000:17:28;397] >> WELL, BILL, VICE PRESIDENT
[000:17:30;332] PENCE HAS WORKED HARD THE LAST
[000:17:33;535] CONSERVATIVES AND MODERATE
[000:17:34;503] REPUBLICANS TOGETHER.
[000:17:35;204] AS YOU KNOW, THE FLAW IN THE
[000:17:37;673] FIRST EFFORT WAS IT DIDN'T
[000:17:39;575] REPEAL THE COSTLY REGULATIONS
[000:17:41;643] THAT OBAMACARE PUT IN PLACE THAT
[000:17:43;312] HAVE CAUSED INSURANCE PREMIUMS
[000:17:45;414] TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF.
[000:17:47;549] WHAT VICE PRESIDENT PENCE SAID
[000:17:48;751] IS, YOU KNOW, THE MORE MODERATE
[000:17:51;553] AND LIBERAL STATES WANT TO KEEP
[000:17:53;255] THE REGULATIONS.
[000:17:54;923] MORE CONSERVATIVES WANT TO GET
[000:17:56;692] RID OF THEM.
[000:17:57;559] HOW ABOUT IF WE DID AN APPROACH
[000:18:00;195] WHERE THE STATES COULD ASK FOR
[000:18:02;064] WAIVERS, THAT THEY COULD GET RID
[000:18:03;532] OF THE COSTLY REGULATIONS AND IF
[000:18:05;734] A STATE LIKE MY STATE OF INDIANA
[000:18:07;236] WANTS TO DO THAT AND SAVE OUR
[000:18:08;971] CITIZENS A LOT OF MONEY ON THEIR
[000:18:10;439] HEALTH INSURANCE, THEY CAN DO
[000:18:11;840] IT.
[000:18:12;107] IF A STATE LIKE NEW YORK WANTS
[000:18:13;575] TO KEEP THE EXPENSIVE
[000:18:16;345] REGULATIONS, THEY CAN DO THAT.
[000:18:18;147] >> THAT ANSWER TELLS ME YOU'RE
[000:18:21;550] NOT ON BOARD.
[000:18:22;117] YOU'RE STILL NEGOTIATING.
[000:18:24;753] >> THE PROBLEM IS, SPEAKER RYAN
[000:18:26;688] HAS NOT AGREED TO THE DEAL THAT
[000:18:29;091] VICE PRESIDENT PROVIDENCE PUT
[000:18:29;825] TOGETHER.
[000:18:30;192] WE'RE READY TO SUPPORT IT, BILL
[000:18:32;294] IF HE WILL AGREE TO IT.
[000:18:35;063] >> Bill: ARE YOU ON THE SAME
[000:18:36;198] SIDE AS MIKE PENCE AT THE
[000:18:37;666] MOMENT?
[000:18:38;033] >> YES, SIR, I AM.
[000:18:39;134] HE'S GOOD A GOOD PROPOSAL.
[000:18:42;371] >> Bill: LET ME INTERRUPT YOU.
[000:18:45;874] TRYING TO SQUEEZE AS MUCH AS WE
[000:18:47;442] CAN IN HERE.
[000:18:48;210] HOW MANY MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM
[000:18:50;646] CAUCUS WOULD VOTE WITH YOUR PLAN
[000:18:52;548] A SECOND TIME AROUND?
[000:18:53;515] >> THEY WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO
[000:18:55;050] SEE THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE IN THE
[000:18:58;053] BILL.
[000:18:58;420] THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S LUCY AND
[000:19:00;756] CHARLIE BROWN.
[000:19:01;356] THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED THINGS
[000:19:02;858] IN THE PAST AND HE DIDN'T
[000:19:04;193] DELIVER IT.
[000:19:04;927] I DON'T BLAME THEM.
[000:19:05;861] SEE THE LANGUAGE, SEE THE BILL.
[000:19:07;663] IF IT'S IN THERE, THE AGREEMENT
[000:19:09;331] THAT WE REACHED WITH VICE
[000:19:10;399] PRESIDENT PENCE IS IN THERE,
[000:19:11;433] THEN IT'S A GOOD PROVISION AND
[000:19:12;835] THE BILL SHOULD GO FORWARD.
[000:19:14;403] >> DAVID, VERY IMPORTANT, AS YOU
[000:19:16;972] KNOW.
[000:19:17;739] THERE WERE 36 MEMBERS OF THE
[000:19:19;575] FREEDOM CAUCUS, PERHAPS 35 AT
[000:19:21;510] LAST CHECK.
[000:19:22;177] YOU'RE SAYING THAT IF YOU GET
[000:19:23;712] WHAT YOU WANT, ALL 35 SIGN ON TO
[000:19:26;415] THIS?
[000:19:26;715] >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF
[000:19:27;883] THEM.
[000:19:28;317] THERE WILL BE SOME THAT WON'T.
[000:19:29;751] I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM ALL.
[000:19:31;019] WHAT I DO THINK IS YOU'LL SEE
[000:19:34;156] ALMOST ALL THE CONSERVATIVES
[000:19:35;991] AGREE TO IT AND THEN THE
[000:19:38;594] MODERATES, WILL THEY HOLD UP
[000:19:40;128] REPEAL AND REPLACE.
[000:19:41;029] THAT'S THEIR DECISION.
[000:19:42;030] EARLY ON, THEY SIGNALS TO THE
[000:19:44;132] VICE PRESIDENT THAT THEY COULD
[000:19:44;900] LIVE WITH THIS COMPROMISE.
[000:19:46;869] I THINK THE REAL QUESTION IS
[000:19:47;870] WILL SPEAKER RYAN AND THE
[000:19:49;304] MODERATES TAKE A YES AT THIS
[000:19:51;840] POINT.
[000:19:52;808] >> Bill: DO YOU BELIEVE AT THIS
[000:19:55;244] POINT THAT THAT THERE HAPPEN?
[000:19:56;612] >> YES, I DO.
[000:19:58;680] I THINK IN THE END, THEY'RE
[000:20:00;282] FAITHFUL TO THEIR CAMPAIGN
[000:20:01;650] PROMISES THAT THEY WANT TO
[000:20:02;851] REPEAL OBAMACARE.
[000:20:03;752] THIS IS A COMPROMISED WAY TO DO
[000:20:05;320] IT AND A GOOD WAY FORWARD.
[000:20:06;989] >> SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A
[000:20:08;790] REVIVAL FOR REPEAL AND REPLACE,
[000:20:10;425] IT SOUNDS AS IF A LOT IS MOVING
[000:20:12;728] AT THE MOMENT.
[000:20:13;762] >> A LOT IS MOVING.
[000:20:15;797] THE KEY IS NOT EVERYBODY IS
[000:20:17;232] GOING TO GET EVERYTHING THEY
[000:20:19;201] WANT.
[000:20:19;968] CONSERVATIVES GOT A BIG PART OF
[000:20:21;370] WHAT THEY WANT NOW.
[000:20:22;638] THE INDIVIDUAL STATES CAN DECIDE
[000:20:24;072] TO GET RID OF THOSE REGULATIONS.
[000:20:25;774] I HOPE THE MODERATES WILL SAY
[000:20:28;143] YES, WE PRESERVED IT FOR OUR
[000:20:29;912] STATE IF WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
[000:20:32;247] THAT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE.
[000:20:33;548] >> Bill: FOR THE RECORD, WE
[000:20:34;917] HEARD THE SAME THING ABOUT THREE
[000:20:35;884] WEEKS AGO.
[000:20:36;518] >> YEAH, YOU HAVE TO KEEP
[000:20:38;353] MOVING.
[000:20:38;687] THINGS CAN FALL APART IN
[000:20:41;290] WASHINGTON.
[000:20:41;690] THE CLUB FOR GROWTH WAS DEAD SET
[000:20:43;125] ABOUT THE EARLIER BILL BECAUSE
[000:20:45;193] IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ON THESE
[000:20:47;129] REGULATIONS, THIS IS A BIG STEP
[000:20:49;464] FORWARD TO PROVIDE RELIEF SO
[000:20:51;433] INSURANCE PREMIUMS CAN COME
[000:20:52;567] DOWN.
[000:20:52;868] >> Bill: WE'LL SEE IF IT GOES.
[000:20:56;204] DAVID, THANKS.
[000:20:56;939] PRESIDENT FOR THE CLUB FOR
[000:20:58;073] GROWTH.
[000:20:58;507] IN A MOMENT HERE, CHILDREN AMONG
[000:21:00;375] THE DEATH AFTER REPORTS OF A
[000:21:01;710] CHEMICAL ATTACK INSIDE SYRIA.
[000:21:03;578] NOW THE WHITE HOUSE UNDER
[000:21:04;746] GROWING PRESSURE TO DEAL WITH
[000:21:06;214] THE RUSSIAN BACK'S DICTATOR,
[000:21:11;186] AL-ASSAD AFTER THE
[000:21:13;889] ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY'RE NOT
[000:21:15;190] FOCUSED ON REMOVING HIM FROM
[000:21:17;159] POWER.
[000:21:17;459] SO WHAT NOW?
[000:21:17;859] THAT'S NEXT.
[000:21:18;760] Why do we put so much effort
[000:21:20;696] into engineering the
[000:21:20;696] Can-Am Defender?
[000:21:22;464] Because a job worth doing,
[000:21:23;966] is worth doing right.
[000:21:25;600] Can-Am Defender.
[000:21:26;802] Tough, Capable, Clever.
[000:21:28;637] Get a 3-year BRP limited
[000:21:29;905] warranty plus a $1,500 cash
[000:21:31;640] rebate on 2016 Defender models.
[000:22:36;304] My lineage was the Vecchios and
[000:22:36;304] Zuccolis. Through Ancestry,
[000:22:40;308] through DNA I found out that I
[000:22:40;308] was only 16% Italian.
[000:22:44;246] He was 34% Eastern European.
[000:22:47;749] So I went onto Ancestry,
[000:22:49;918] soon learned that one of our
[000:22:49;918] ancestors we thought was Italian
[000:22:53;088] was Eastern European.
[000:22:54;589] This is my ancestor who I
[000:22:54;589] didn't know about.
[000:22:56;925] He looks a little bit
[000:22:56;925] like me, yes.
[000:22:58;927] Ancestry has many paths to
[000:22:58;927] discovering your story.

[000:23:01;696] Ancestry.com
[000:24:33;321] >> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING
[000:24:34;589] TODAY'S APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK
[000:24:37;092] IN SYRIA AGAINST CIVILIANS IS
[000:24:40;629] REPREHENSIBLE AND CANNOT BE
[000:24:43;031] IGNORED.
[000:24:43;498] IT'S CALLING ACTIONS BY BASHAR
[000:24:47;903] AL-ASSAD HEINOUS AND THAT IS A
[000:24:50;305] SHIFT FROM WHAT TOP TRUMP
[000:24:51;506] OFFICIALS WERE SAYING DAYS AGO.
[000:24:53;642] ACTIVISTS CLAIM SYRIAN OR
[000:24:55;744] RUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS DROPPED
[000:24:57;045] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A TOWN IN
[000:24:58;947] NORTHERN SYRIA.
[000:24:59;748] A HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SAID THE
[000:25:02;384] ATTACKS KILLED 58 PEOPLE

[000:25:05;253] WE WANT TO WARN YOU, THE IMAGES
[000:25:07;689] ARE DISTURBING AND YOU MAY WANT
[000:25:12;794] TO THINK TWICE ABOUT SHARING
[000:25:14;863] WITH YOUR KIDS.
[000:25:15;730] WE'RE SHOWING THEM THOU BECAUSE
[000:25:17;465] THEY CONVEY THE TRUE HORROR OF
[000:25:18;767] THIS ATTACK AND THE VICTIMS IT
[000:25:22;003] INVOLVES.
[000:25:23;471] HEART-BREAKING PHOTOS POSTED ON
[000:25:26;508] FACEBOOK.
[000:25:26;875] SMALL CHILDREN IN DIAPERS AMONG
[000:25:28;643] THE VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL
[000:25:30;612] ATTACK.
[000:25:31;813] MEDICS REPORTING THAT ROCKET
[000:25:33;949] ATTACKS AND CLINICS TREATING THE
[000:25:35;984] WOUNDED.
[000:25:36;551] TODAY REPORTERS ASKED SEAN
[000:25:38;887] SPICER IF THE UNITED STATES WILL
[000:25:40;422] RESPOND.
[000:25:40;855] SPICER IS SAYING OFF CAMERA THAT
[000:25:42;424] HE WASN'T GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
[000:25:43;925] THE PRESIDENT.
[000:25:44;459] THIS COMING DAYS AFTER THE U.S.
[000:25:46;728] AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI
[000:25:52;300] HALEY SAID THE TRUMP
[000:25:53;368] ADMINISTRATION WASN'T INTERESTED
[000:25:54;936] IN REMOVING AL-ASSAD FROM POWER
[000:25:56;905] AND IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE
[000:25:58;807] SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE
[000:26:00;008] FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.
[000:26:01;409] THIS IS THE THIRD CLAIM OF A
[000:26:03;144] CHEMICAL ATTACK IN JUST OVER A
[000:26:05;146] WEEK IN SYRIA.
[000:26:07;082] LEA GABRIELLE WITH MORE ON THIS
[000:26:09;117] TODAY.
[000:26:11;786] LEA?
[000:26:12;053] >> THERE'S REPORTS OF PEOPLE
[000:26:13;922] FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, PEOPLE
[000:26:16;358] UNRESPONSIVE.
[000:26:17;225] YOU CAN SEE EMERGENCY WORKERS
[000:26:20;395] DRESSED IN HAZMAT SUITS AS THEY
[000:26:22;230] TAKE CHILDREN INTO THE HOSPITAL
[000:26:23;298] FOR TREATMENT.
[000:26:24;032] ONE DOCTOR SAID HE SAW PATIENTS
[000:26:26;401] WITH PINPOINT PUPILS.
[000:26:28;903] THESE ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS OF
[000:26:32;907] TOXIC GAS EXPOSURES.
[000:26:35;043] THEY THINK MORE THAN ONE GAS WAS
[000:26:38;380] USED INCLUDING SARIN.
[000:26:44;586] THIS HAPPENED IN AN AIR
[000:26:46;588] CONTROLLED BY FORCES OPPOSED TO
[000:26:49;157] THE ASSAD REGIME.
[000:26:50;558] IT'S HOME TO 900,000 DISPLACED
[000:26:54;963] SYRIANS.
[000:26:55;297] THIS IS THE WORST TOXIC GAS
[000:26:58;366] ATTACK ON A DAMASCUS SUBJECT
[000:27:00;201] BOSCH.
[000:27:01;369] AFTER THAT, PRESIDENT ASSAD
[000:27:04;072] AGREED TO DESTROY CHEMICAL
[000:27:05;874] WEAPONS.
[000:27:07;075] 1,300 TONS OF MATERIALS WERE
[000:27:10;645] DESTROYED.
[000:27:11;012] MANY COUNTRIES WORRY WHETHER HE
[000:27:13;214] GAVE UP HIS MATERIALS.
[000:27:15;884] >> AND SENATOR McCAIN IS
[000:27:18;186] QUESTIONING WHETHER IT'S TIME TO
[000:27:19;487] TAKE ACTION AGAINST ASSAD.
[000:27:21;690] >> TODAY A STATEMENT WAS
[000:27:23;391] RELEASED SAYING "ASSAD BELIEVES
[000:27:25;927] HE CAN COMMIT WAR CRIMES WITH
[000:27:29;097] IMPUNITY.
[000:27:29;464] THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE WILL
[000:27:31;032] TAKE ACTION TO DISABUSE HIM OF
[000:27:33;101] THIS MURDEROUS NOTION."
[000:27:34;936] HE SAID THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WOULD
[000:27:36;571] HAVE A DECISION ABOUT ASSAD'S
[000:27:41;109] FATE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.
[000:27:42;277] AS YOU RECALL LAST WEEK, THE
[000:27:44;646] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY
[000:27:45;447] WEREN'T FOCUSED ON TAKING OUT
[000:27:48;083] ASSAD ANYMORE.
[000:27:48;650] TAKE A LISTEN.
[000:27:50;185] >> THERE'S A POLITICAL REALITY
[000:27:53;188] THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN TERMS
[000:27:55;690] OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
[000:27:57;859] WE LOST A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THE
[000:28:00;228] LAST ADMINISTRATION WITH RESPECT
[000:28:03;264] TO ASSAD.
[000:28:04;032] NOW IT'S UP TO THE SYRIAN
[000:28:05;567] PEOPLE.
[000:28:06;101] WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE
[000:28:07;302] NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW DEFEATING
[000:28:09;971] ISIS.
[000:28:10;271] >> WELL, TODAY PRESS SECRETARY
[000:28:12;307] SEAN SPICER TOOK A DIFFERENT
[000:28:13;875] TONE.
[000:28:14;175] HE SAID THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A
[000:28:15;577] LACK OF COMFORT WITH ASSAD.
[000:28:17;479] VERY DIDN'T TONE THERE.
[000:28:18;480] >> Bill: WE AWAIT THE NEXT
[000:28:19;981] CHAPTER.
[000:28:20;515] TRULY DISTURBING.
[000:28:21;483] THANK YOU.

[000:28:55;884] (Dog barking)
[000:28:59;487] Anyone can dream.
[000:29:01;756] Making it a reality
[000:29:01;756] is the hard part.
[000:29:04;092] From the B-2 to
[000:29:04;092] the upcoming B-21,
[000:29:06;294] Northrop Grumman
[000:29:06;294] stealth bombers give
[000:29:07;562] America an advantage
[000:29:07;562] in a turbulent world.
[000:29:09;998] And we're looking for a

[000:30:49;063] >> Bill: FOX REPORT NOW.
[000:30:50;431] AN UPDATE ON THE SUBWAY BOMBING
[000:30:52;233] IN RUSSIA.
[000:30:53;768] INVESTIGATORS SAY 22-YEAR-OLD
[000:30:56;871] MAN FROM WAS THE CULPRIT FOR THE
[000:31:08;650] BOMBING.
[000:31:08;983] AND YESTERDAY THE STATION WAS
[000:31:10;685] FILLED WITH SMOKE AND PEOPLE
[000:31:12;053] TRIED TO PRY OPEN DOORS.
[000:31:13;721] WITNESSES DESCRIBE A HORRIFIC
[000:31:16;791] SCENE.
[000:31:17;458] PEOPLE KNEELING OF BODIES AND
[000:31:19;794] THEIR HAIR BURNED.
[000:31:21;262] INVESTIGATORS SAY THE SUSPECT
[000:31:23;298] PLANTED A BOMB IN ANOTHER SUBWAY
[000:31:24;966] STATION IN ST. PETERSBURG.
[000:31:30;705] THE ENTIRE SUBWAY SYSTEM SHUT
[000:31:32;473] DOWN FOR HOURS.
[000:31:33;975] VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS VISITING THAT
[000:31:36;444] TOWN AT THAT TIME, WHICH IS ALSO
[000:31:37;478] HIS HOMETOWN.
[000:31:38;313] HE COLD IT A POSSIBLE TERROR
[000:31:40;882] ATTACK.
[000:31:41;215] NO WORD ON GROUPS CLAIMING
[000:31:43;184] RESPONSIBILITY JUST YET.
[000:31:45;553] THE NEWS WILL CONTINUE AFTER
[000:31:46;287] THIS.
[000:31:51;793] AREDS 2.
[000:31:55;129] My doctor said
[000:31:55;997] PreserVision
[000:31:55;997] AREDS 2
[000:31:57;231] has the exact
[000:31:57;231] nutrient formula

[000:32:01;302] to help reduce
[000:32:02;437] the risk of progression of
[000:32:02;437] moderate to advanced AMD
[000:32:04;839] after 15 years
[000:32:04;839] of clinical studies.
[000:32:08;509] PreserVision
[000:32:08;509] AREDS 2.
[000:32:10;311] Because my eyes
[000:32:10;311] are everything.
[000:33:48;876] >> Bill: SENATE INTELLIGENCE
[000:33:49;877] COMMITTEE MEETING BEHIND CLOSED
[000:33:50;978] DOOR AS THEY CONTINUE TO
[000:33:53;114] INVESTIGATE RUSSIA'S INVOLVEMENT
[000:33:55;283] IN THE ELECTION OF 2016.
[000:33:58;519] A LIVE LOOK NOW AT THE STAKEOUT
[000:34:00;455] CAM WHERE WE CAN HEAR FROM
[000:34:01;556] MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ONCE
[000:34:03;257] THEY'RE DONE MEETING, THIS COMES
[000:34:04;759] ONLY HOURS AFTER SUSAN RICE
[000:34:06;594] ADDRESSED THE CONTROVERSY
[000:34:08;296] SURROUNDING THE UNMASKING OF
[000:34:09;897] TRUMP ASSOCIATE NAMES CAUGHT UP
[000:34:13;201] IN SURVEILLANCE.
[000:34:14;502] CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS ON THAT
[000:34:15;536] STORY NOW LIVE IN WASHINGTON.
[000:34:17;972] CATHERINE?
[000:34:18;339] >> THANK YOU.
[000:34:19;540] THE RICE INTERVIEW ILLUSTRATES
[000:34:20;975] THE POLITICAL DIVIDE HERE IN
[000:34:26;647] WASHINGTON.
[000:34:27;315] SOME SAY THE OBAMA
[000:34:29;117] ADMINISTRATION WAS DOING DUE
[000:34:31;219] DILIGENCE.
[000:34:31;686] THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:34:33;921] ADVISOR EMPHASIZING THAT
[000:34:35;656] UNMASKING IS SEPARATE AND
[000:34:36;691] DISTINCT FROM MAKING THE NAMES
[000:34:40;695] PUBLIC.
[000:34:41;028] >> THE NOTION THAT WHICH SOME
[000:34:42;263] PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SUGGEST
[000:34:43;898] THAT BY ASKING FOR THE IDENTITY
[000:34:47;001] OF AN AMERICAN PERSON, THAT IS
[000:34:48;803] THE SAME AS LEAKING IT IS
[000:34:50;371] COMPLETELY FALSE.
[000:34:51;739] THERE'S NO EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN
[000:34:53;307] SO-CALLED UNMASKING AND LEAKING.
[000:34:56;811] >> MEANTIME A GOVERNMENT SOURCE
[000:34:59;180] CONFIRMED TO FOX NEWS THAT RICE
[000:35:00;381] WITH BEN RHODES AND FORMER
[000:35:02;250] C.I.A. DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN HAD
[000:35:03;951] REGULAR ACCESS TO THE
[000:35:05;319] INTELLIGENCE WHERE MEMBERS OF
[000:35:06;521] THE TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM WERE
[000:35:08;222] IDENTIFIED OR UNMASKED.
[000:35:10;892] AS THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
[000:35:15;696] COMMITSTY'S RANKING DEMOCRATS
[000:35:18;733] SAID, IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO GET
[000:35:21;402] IDENTITIES TO UNDER THE
[000:35:22;637] CONVERSATIONS.
[000:35:23;070] >> Bill: ARE THEY DOING THAT
[000:35:25;239] ALREADY, CATHERINE?
[000:35:26;040] >> A SHORT TIME AGO, FOX NEWS
[000:35:29;544] ASKING THE REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN
[000:35:31;512] RICHARD BURR ABOUT SUSAN RICE.
[000:35:37;885] MEAN TONIGHT THE HOUSE
[000:35:40;021] INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, FOX NEWS
[000:35:41;756] SAID THAT THOSE THAT WILL BE
[000:35:43;157] INTERVIEWED BE INVESTIGATORS
[000:35:46;627] INCLUDING CARTER PAGE, PAUL
[000:35:49;564] MANAFORT AND ROGER STONE.
[000:35:51;299] BASED ON OUR REPORTING, THERE'S
[000:35:55;570] AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WERE
[000:35:56;804] DEMOCRATS FOR THE INTERVIEWS AND
[000:35:58;172] COULD BE DONE AS EARLY AS APRIL
[000:36:00;541] 17th.
[000:36:01;776] LIKELY AFTER THE RECESS.
[000:36:04;078] >> SO THE FBI DIRECTOR IS BACK
[000:36:06;314] IN THE CROSS HAIR.
[000:36:07;048] WHAT GIVES WITH THAT?
[000:36:08;216] >> JAMES COMEY AND THE NSA
[000:36:10;918] DIRECTOR ADMIRAL MIKE ROGERS
[000:36:12;920] TESTIFIED AT THE HEARING MARCH
[000:36:14;488] 20th.
[000:36:15;089] BUT AFTER THESE REPORTS CAME TO
[000:36:16;858] LIGHT, BOTH MEN WERE RECALLED.
[000:36:19;126] THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LAST
[000:36:21;462] WEEK.
[000:36:21;762] THE FBI SAID THAT THEY'RE NOT
[000:36:25;266] COOPERATIVE ON THE MATTER.
[000:36:27;501] MEANTIME, A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
[000:36:28;569] SAID THE FBI DIRECTOR IN THEIR
[000:36:29;837] OPINION WAS SO DAMAGED BY HIS
[000:36:32;206] PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN THE CLINTON
[000:36:36;744] E-MAIL PROBLEM AND THE RUSSIAN
[000:36:38;579] ELECTION SCANDAL THAT SHE SHOULD
[000:36:39;981] CONSIDER RECUSING HIMSELF.
[000:36:41;148] HE WAS AT THE CENTER OF THE
[000:36:44;318] MASKING OF MIKE FLYNN AS PART OF
[000:36:47;488] THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE
[000:36:50;258] INVESTIGATION.
[000:36:50;691] THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD NOT
[000:36:51;759] SPEAK ON THE RECORD BUT THEY
[000:36:52;860] CLAIMED WHAT THE DIRECTOR SAID
[000:36:54;128] IN THE MARCH 20th HEARING DID
[000:36:55;963] NOT SYNC UP WITH HIS STATEMENTS
[000:36:59;400] DURING PRIVATE CLASSIFIED
[000:37:00;835] BRIEFINGS.
[000:37:01;202] THE DIRECTOR'S VIEW ON THE
[000:37:02;603] PRESIDENT'S WIRETAPPING TWEETS
[000:37:03;905] WERE DESCRIBED AS SHOWING A
[000:37:06;040] COMPLETE LACK OF DISCRETION.
[000:37:07;575] I WOULD EMPHASIZE WE'VE HEARD
[000:37:10;044] NOTHING IN A SIMILAR VEIN FROM
[000:37:11;746] THE DEMOCRATS THAT ARE ON THESE
[000:37:14;181] COMMITTEES.
[000:37:14;582] NO A LOT TO FOLLOW, CATHERINE.
[000:37:16;884] THANK YOU.
[000:37:17;451] ALSO FROM THE HILL, THERE'S MORE
[000:37:19;287] THIS HOUR.
[000:37:20;388] SENATORS HAVE STARTED THEIR
[000:37:22;423] FORMAL DEBATE OVER PRESIDENT
[000:37:25;059] TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE,
[000:37:26;460] NEIL GORSUCH.
[000:37:27;695] A LIVE LOOK AT THE SENATE FLOOR.
[000:37:30;164] IT'S LOOKING LIKE REPUBLICANS
[000:37:31;766] MIGHT USE THE NUCLEAR OPTION TO
[000:37:34;001] GET HIM CONFIRMED AND ON THE
[000:37:36;070] BENCH.
[000:37:36;404] 41 DEMOCRATIC SENATORS SAY THEY
[000:37:38;639] WILL PLAN TO VOTE NO ON
[000:37:40;641] CONFIRMING GORSUCH.
[000:37:42;143] THAT IS ENOUGH TO STOP
[000:37:43;344] REPUBLICANS FROM GETTING THE 60
[000:37:45;246] VOTES THEY NEED.
[000:37:46;213] THE WAY AROUND THAT FOR
[000:37:48;582] REPUBLICANS IS THE NUCLEAR
[000:37:52;153] OPTION.
[000:37:52;486] THAT WOULD SET A NEW PRECEDENT
[000:37:54;155] AND LOWTER MAJORITY TO 51 VOTES.
[000:37:58;192] THAT WAY REPUBLICANS COULD
[000:38:00;061] CONFIRM GORSUCH WITHOUT A SINGLE
[000:38:03;264] DEMOCRATIC VOTE.
[000:38:05;266] THE RULE CHANGE WOULD BE FOR
[000:38:06;667] FUTURE NOMINEES.
[000:38:07;568] IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT BODY.
[000:38:12;106] PETER, DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO
[000:38:13;541] AVOID USING THE NUCLEAR OPTION
[000:38:15;443] IN WHAT WAY?
[000:38:15;843] >> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE SENATE
[000:38:18;679] MINORITY LEADER, CHUCK SCHUMER,
[000:38:20;481] HIS PARTY IN THE MINORITY, THAT
[000:38:23;884] IF THE NUCLEAR OPTION GETS USED
[000:38:24;752] AGAINST THEM, THEY WILL BE
[000:38:29;023] FURTHER MARGINALIZED WHILE
[000:38:31;993] REPUBLICANS ARE IN CHARGE.
[000:38:33;027] NOW SCHUMER SAYS THAT
[000:38:34;362] REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS SHOULD
[000:38:35;629] GET TOGETHER IN A ROOM BEHIND
[000:38:38;065] CLOSED DOORS TO TALK IT OUT AND
[000:38:39;867] FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID USING
[000:38:41;802] THE NUCLEAR OPTION.
[000:38:43;337] THAT IS NEW FOR SCHUMER.
[000:38:46;007] PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BEEN SAYING IF
[000:38:47;274] GORSUCH WASN'T GOING TO GET 60
[000:38:50;011] VOTES, PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD
[000:38:51;846] NOMINATE SOMEONE THAT COULD.
[000:38:52;913] SCHUMER AND HIS COLLEAGUES,
[000:38:55;182] RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, ARE LAYING
[000:38:56;484] OUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING
[000:39:01;255] THE PRECEDENT CHANGED.
[000:39:03;691] BLUMENTHAL IS USING BLEAK
[000:39:05;493] ADJECTIVES.
[000:39:05;893] >> THE REASON THEY CALL IT THE
[000:39:07;561] NUCLEAR OPTION, THAT IS THAT
[000:39:09;964] THERE'S FALL-OUT.
[000:39:11;165] >> THE MINORITY LEADER SCHUMER
[000:39:12;967] IS SUGGESTING THAT PRESIDENT
[000:39:14;001] TRUMP IS GOING TO HAVE A REALLY
[000:39:15;569] HARD TIME DOING SOMETHING THAT
[000:39:16;637] HE SUGGESTED THAT HE MIGHT DO
[000:39:18;539] SOME DAY, REACH OUT TO DEMOCRATS
[000:39:20;641] FOR SOME LEGISLATING HERE IF THE
[000:39:25;379] NUCLEAR OPTION IS USED.
[000:39:26;547] >> WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS TELLING
[000:39:28;382] YOU ABOUT THE JUSTIFICATION, THE
[000:39:29;884] CHANGE OF PRECEDENT?
[000:39:31;552] HOW DID THEY BACK THAT UP AT
[000:39:33;387] THIS LATE STAGE?
[000:39:34;021] >> THEY'RE JUSTIFYING IT BY
[000:39:35;589] SAYING THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY
[000:39:37;958] CAN CONFIRM GORSUCH EVEN THOUGH
[000:39:39;660] THEY KNOW THIS RULE COULD SOME
[000:39:41;162] DAY BE USED AGAINST THEM.
[000:39:44;498] >> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY
[000:39:46;534] HARMFUL.
[000:39:46;867] SOME DAY THE DEMOCRATS WILL BE
[000:39:47;968] IN THE MAJORITY AND WE WILL LOSE
[000:39:51;906] THE UNIQUE ASPECT OF THE WAY WE
[000:39:54;742] SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS.
[000:39:56;944] IT WILL RESULT IN SUPREME COURT
[000:39:59;413] NOMINEES THAT ARE MUCH MORE
[000:40:02;883] RADICAL IN EITHER DIRECTION.
[000:40:04;418] >> THE SECOND HIGHEST RANKING
[000:40:06;987] SENATOR, ORRIN HATCH FROM UTAH
[000:40:08;556] SAYS IT COULD BE THE NEXT
[000:40:11;625] CONFIRMATION FIGHT THAT WOULD BE
[000:40:13;194] LIKE ARMAGEDDON.
[000:40:14;128] THAT MIGHT BE THE ONE WHERE
[000:40:15;563] PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD HAVE THE
[000:40:16;464] OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE ONE OF
[000:40:18;165] THE COURT'S LIBERAL JUSTICES
[000:40:20;568] WITH A CONSERVATIVE.
[000:40:22;269] >> MAYBE SENATOR SCHUMER IS
[000:40:23;904] COOKING UP A DEAL.
[000:40:25;406] COULD BE THE ART OF HIS OWN
[000:40:27;908] DEAL.
[000:40:28;576] PETER DOOCY LIVE.
[000:40:29;443] MORE ON THE SHOWDOWN IN THE
[000:40:32;847] SENATE A AND THE POSSIBLE
[000:40:35;749] CONSEQUENCES OF USING THE
[000:40:37;284] NUCLEAR OPTION.
[000:40:37;751] THAT IS NEXT AS WE CONTINUE.
[000:40:39;053] Hey, ready for the big meeting?
[000:42:11;378] Yeah.
[000:42:13;113] Uh, hello!?
[000:42:14;248] A meeting?
[000:42:15;249] It's a big one.
[000:42:16;250] Too bad.
[000:42:16;250] We are double booked:
[000:42:17;618] diarrhea and
[000:42:17;618] abdominal pain.
[000:42:20;321] Why don't you start
[000:42:20;321] without me?
[000:42:21;855] Oh. Yeah.
[000:42:24;725] If you're living with frequent,
[000:42:25;993] unpredictable diarrhea
[000:42:25;993] and abdominal pain,
[000:42:27;595] you may have...
[000:42:28;696] ...Irritable Bowel Syndrome
[000:42:28;696] with Diarrhea,
[000:42:30;264] or IBS-D.
[000:42:31;365] A condition that can
[000:42:31;365] be really frustrating.
[000:42:33;267] Talk to your doctor
[000:42:33;267] about VIBERZI,
[000:42:35;269] a different way to treat IBS-D.
[000:42:36;737] VIBERZI is a
[000:42:36;737] prescription medication
[000:42:38;505] you take every day
[000:42:39;740] that helps proactively manage
[000:42:40;908] both diarrhea and abdominal pain
[000:42:42;243] at the same time.
[000:42:43;410] So you stay ahead of
[000:42:43;410] your symptoms.
[000:42:45;145] VIBERZI can cause new or
[000:42:45;145] worsening abdominal pain.
[000:42:47;781] Do not take VIBERZI if you have
[000:42:47;781] or may have had:
[000:42:49;917] pancreas or
[000:42:49;917] severe liver problems,
[000:42:51;719] problems with alcohol abuse,
[000:42:52;920] long-lasting or
[000:42:52;920] severe constipation,
[000:42:54;722] or a blockage of your bowel
[000:42:54;722] or gallbladder.
[000:42:56;690] If you are taking VIBERZI,
[000:42:57;992] you should not take medicines
[000:42:57;992] that cause constipation.
[000:42:59;793] The most common side effects of
[000:42:59;793] VIBERZI include
[000:43:02;162] constipation, nausea, and
[000:43:02;162] abdominal pain.
[000:43:05;299] Stay ahead of IBS-D...
[000:43:07;167] ...with VIBERZI.
[000:43:44;338] >> Bill: FOLLOW UP ON THE STORY
[000:43:46;407] OUT OF SYRIA.
[000:43:47;875] PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING A
[000:43:49;076] STATEMENT OUT ON THE DEADLY
[000:43:50;544] CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.
[000:43:52;980] BLAMING THE ASSAD REGIME FOR
[000:43:54;882] WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLS HEINOUS
[000:43:57;851] ACTIONS.
[000:43:58;585] ACTIVISTS SAY SYRIAN OR RUSSIAN
[000:44:01;822] FIGHTER JETS DROPPED CHEMICALS
[000:44:03;023] ON A NORTHERN TOWN IN SYRIA.
[000:44:04;825] THE ATTACK KILLED AT LEAST 58
[000:44:06;827] AND 11 CHILDREN.
[000:44:08;696] THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT READS
[000:44:10;030] THE FOLLOWING "TODAY'S CHEMICAL
[000:44:12;700] ATTACK IN SYRIA AGAINST INNOCENT
[000:44:16;470] PEOPLE, INCLUDING WOMEN AND
[000:44:17;771] CHILDREN, IS REPREHENSIBLE AND
[000:44:19;873] CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
[000:44:23;077] CIVILIZED WORLD.
[000:44:24;378] THESE ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE
[000:44:28;582] PAST ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS.
[000:44:30;884] PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WOULD
[000:44:32;286] ESTABLISH A RED LINE AGAINST THE
[000:44:33;354] USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND DID
[000:44:36;156] NOTHING.
[000:44:36;924] THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH
[000:44:37;691] OUR ALLIES ACROSS THE GLOBE TO
[000:44:41;528] CONDEMN THIS INTOLERABLE ATTACK.
[000:44:42;863] THAT IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE
[000:44:44;064] PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:44:45;432] MORE UPDATES ON THIS STORY AS WE
[000:44:47;801] GET DEVELOPMENTS HERE AT THE FOX
[000:44:50;704] NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:44:51;138] NOW BACK TO CONTINUING COVERAGE
[000:44:52;439] OF THE SENATE DEBATE OVER
[000:44:54;942] SUPREME COURT NOMINEE NEIL
[000:44:58;312] GORSUCH.
[000:44:58;645] IT'S ALMOST THAT TIME.
[000:45:00;180] DEMOCRATS THREATENING TO BLOCK
[000:45:01;348] THE CONFIRMATION.
[000:45:02;483] REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WILL GET IT
[000:45:03;450] DONE ANYWAY.
[000:45:04;385] I WANT TO BRING IN EMILY GOOD
[000:45:07;921] DEN TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS.
[000:45:09;690] GOOD AFTERNOON.
[000:45:13;694] FOR REPUBLICANS, WHAT THE DO
[000:45:15;028] THEY HAVE ON THE LINE FOR THIS
[000:45:17;765] POTENTIAL NUCLEAR OPTION?
[000:45:18;665] >> IT MAY BACKFIRE ON THEM JUST
[000:45:20;467] LIKE IT DID ON DEMOCRATS WHEN
[000:45:22;202] THEY DID THIS UNDER PRESIDENT
[000:45:23;437] OBAMA.
[000:45:23;737] THIS IS A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON
[000:45:26;006] AND CAN BITE YOU.
[000:45:27;641] THIS DOES MAKE THE NOMINATION
[000:45:29;743] PROCESS EASIER FOR SUPREME COURT
[000:45:31;779] NOMINEES.
[000:45:32;146] BUT LET'S SAY IN 2020 A DEMOCRAT
[000:45:33;914] GETS ELECTED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:45:35;649] THEY WOULD HAVE AN EASIER TIME
[000:45:37;985] PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME
[000:45:39;520] COURT.
[000:45:39;853] >> WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRATS?
[000:45:40;621] WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THEM?
[000:45:42;022] >> FOR DEMOCRATS, THIS IS REALLY
[000:45:44;391] ABOUT RALLYING FOR THE BASE AND
[000:45:46;226] LOOKING AHEAD TO THE 2018
[000:45:48;829] ELECTION.
[000:45:49;196] YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, THE
[000:45:50;998] DEMOCRATIC BASE WAS FURIOUS
[000:45:52;166] ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MERRICK
[000:45:54;134] GARLAND.
[000:45:54;501] THEY SEE THIS AS HIS SUPREME
[000:45:57;571] COURT SEAT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:45:58;906] SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO NOMINATE
[000:46:01;708] HIS NOMINEE AND THE REPUBLICANS
[000:46:03;644] STOLE THIS AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE
[000:46:05;012] FURIOUS.
[000:46:05;379] THEY'RE TRYING TO KEEP THE BASE
[000:46:07;381] HAPPY.
[000:46:07;681] THEY WANT TO TAKE THE SENATE
[000:46:09;583] BACK.
[000:46:09;883] >> THEY'RE RAISING MONEY OFF OF
[000:46:11;585] THIS, TOO.
[000:46:12;252] REPUBLICANS WOULD TAKE THAT
[000:46:13;821] ARGUMENT AND SAYING YOU'RE DOING
[000:46:15;756] THIS FOR REVENGE.
[000:46:16;857] >> REVENGE OR PLANNING AHEAD,
[000:46:19;259] PUT IT EITHER WAY.
[000:46:20;527] THIS IS A RALLYING CRY FOR THEM.
[000:46:23;130] THEY'RE ALREADY FUND-RAISING OFF
[000:46:24;364] OF IT, THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR
[000:46:26;366] DEMOCRATS.
[000:46:26;733] >> YOU NEED 60 VOTES TO END THE
[000:46:28;936] DEBATE.
[000:46:29;736] IF YOU HAD THE 60 VOTES, YOU
[000:46:31;705] COULD GET AN UP OR DOWN VOTE OR
[000:46:34;341] GOVERNOR SUM AND THEN ONLY NEED
[000:46:35;809] 51 VOTES.
[000:46:36;376] SO THERE'S A RULE IN THE SENATE
[000:46:37;945] THAT NEEDS TO BE VERIFY FOR
[000:46:39;813] VIEWERS AT HOME.
[000:46:40;414] THAT'S WHY WE TALK ABOUT 51
[000:46:42;349] VERSUS 60.
[000:46:43;517] DEMOCRATS CHANGED THIS RULE IN
[000:46:44;785] THE FIRST PLACE UNDER HARRY REID
[000:46:46;119] IN 2013.
[000:46:47;521] SO WHAT ARE THEY COMPLAINING
[000:46:49;089] ABOUT NOW?
[000:46:51;158] >> WELL, EXACTLY.
[000:46:52;926] WHAT HAPPENED REPUBLICANS WERE
[000:46:54;261] FILIBUSTERING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
[000:46:55;496] NOMINEES AND DEMOCRATS WEREN'T
[000:46:57;197] HAPPY.
[000:46:57;498] SO THEY CHANGED IT SO YOU ONLY
[000:46:59;466] NEED A SIMPLY MAJORITY FOR
[000:47:01;602] EVERYTHING BUT SUPREME COURT
[000:47:03;203] NOMINEES.
[000:47:03;570] SO NOW WE MAY MAKE IT AN
[000:47:06;106] ACROSS-THE-BOARD SIMPLE 51.
[000:47:08;275] >> LET'S TURN THE LOGIC AROUND.
[000:47:11;812] SAY YOU'RE CHUCK SCHUMER.
[000:47:13;213] YOU DON'T WANT TO BREAK THIS
[000:47:14;581] RULE FOR SUPREME COURT NOMINEES,
[000:47:16;383] RIGHT?
[000:47:16;683] SO YOU WORK OUT A WAY TO GET THE
[000:47:19;353] 60 VOTES.
[000:47:19;887] THE REASON YOU TRY TO DO THAT IS
[000:47:22;256] NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A BIG
[000:47:24;658] SUPPORTER OF NEIL GORSUCH, YOU
[000:47:26;126] DON'T KNOW WHAT THE IS BEHIND
[000:47:27;628] DOOR NUMBER 2.
[000:47:29;730] IF PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS ANOTHER
[000:47:32;232] NOMINEE, WHO KNOWS WHO LE OFFER.
[000:47:35;769] HE OR SHE MAY BE LESS PALATABLE
[000:47:39;406] TO DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE THEN.
[000:47:41;074] SO YOU DO A DEAL NOW SO IF THE
[000:47:43;810] EVENT COMES UP.
[000:47:44;578] YOU SAVE FACE FOR LATER IS.
[000:47:47;281] THAT LOGIC TOO TWISTED OR IS
[000:47:49;716] THAT LOGIC IMPOSSIBLE?
[000:47:51;318] >> BILL, I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY
[000:47:54;688] RIGHT.
[000:47:54;988] THERE'S A CONCERN AMONG SOME
[000:47:56;723] THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GET
[000:47:57;658] ANOTHER NOMINATION.
[000:47:58;458] IF YOU LOOK AT THE JUSTICES ON
[000:48:00;360] THE COURT, THE ODDS ARE THE
[000:48:02;329] PERSON LEAVING WILL BE A MORE
[000:48:05;198] LIBERAL MEMBER.
[000:48:07;000] PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL APPOINT A
[000:48:10;003] CONSERVATIVE.
[000:48:10;437] IF HE ONLY NEEDS 51 VOTES, IT'S
[000:48:12;306] A DONE DEAL.
[000:48:13;006] >> WHAT IS YOUR GUESS NOW?
[000:48:15;842] IS NEIL GORSUCH SWORN IN AS THE
[000:48:17;744] NEXT SUPREME COURT MEMBER BY THE
[000:48:18;779] END OF THE WEEKEND?
[000:48:19;947] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:48:20;847] IT'S A DONE DEAL.
[000:48:22;215] >> A DONE DEAL.
[000:48:23;584] >> YOU BELIEVE RIGHT NOW IT'S A
[000:48:25;786] 51 VOTE COUNT THAT DOES IT WITH
[000:48:28;455] THE NUCLEAR OPTION OR DO YOU
[000:48:29;990] THINK CHUCK SCHUMER AS PETER
[000:48:31;725] DOOCY IS REPORTING IS WORKING ON
[000:48:33;727] A BIG DEAL BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
[000:48:35;162] NOW?
[000:48:35;429] >> I THINK THAT'S THE UNKNOWN
[000:48:36;964] QUESTION.
[000:48:37;331] THAT'S THE UNKNOWN.
[000:48:38;131] WILL IT BE THE 60 OR THE 51.
[000:48:40;601] KEEP IN MIND, CHUCK SCHUMER
[000:48:42;469] WANTS TO BE SENATE MAJORITY
[000:48:44;071] LEADER ONE DAY.
[000:48:44;838] WHATEVER RULES HE MAKES RIGHT
[000:48:46;139] NOW, HE HAS TO OPERATE UNDER IN
[000:48:47;908] THE FUTURE.
[000:48:48;575] >> HOW WOULD THAT INFLUENCE HOW
[000:48:50;210] HE MAKES THIS WORK OR NOT NOW,
[000:48:52;779] EMILY?
[000:48:53;180] >> HE WANTS TO THINK ABOUT HE'S
[000:48:57;584] MAJORITY LEADER IN SAY 2018.
[000:48:59;620] HE'S MAJORITY LEADER UNDER A
[000:49:01;388] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:49:01;888] HE'S GOING TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO
[000:49:03;557] HAVE TO USE THE 60 VOTES BECAUSE
[000:49:05;525] THAT'S HARDER TO GET.
[000:49:07;027] SO HE'S PROBABLY THINKING AHEAD
[000:49:09;863] THAT WAY.
[000:49:10;230] >> YOU THINK CHUCK SCHUMER IS IN
[000:49:11;465] A BOX ON THIS?
[000:49:12;499] >> I'M NOT SURE HE'S IN A BOX,
[000:49:14;668] BUT HE HAS TO TREAD CAREFULLY.
[000:49:16;670] HE'S BALANCING THE FUTURE POWER
[000:49:18;972] OF THE SENATE VERSUS HIS PARTY
[000:49:20;707] AND HIS DEMOCRATIC BASE, WHICH
[000:49:22;909] HE NEEDS IN ORDER TO GET CONTROL
[000:49:24;077] OF THE SENATE.
[000:49:24;811] >> LAST QUESTION.
[000:49:25;512] YOU BELIEVE PACED ON THE
[000:49:28;148] JUDICIAL RECORD OF NEIL GORSUCH
[000:49:30;050] THAT HE IS THAT OFFENSIVE TO
[000:49:33;053] DEMOCRATS?
[000:49:33;420] IS HE THAT OFFENSIVE TO LIBERALS
[000:49:36;690] OR JUST THE EXTREME LIBERAL PART
[000:49:39;459] OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?
[000:49:40;894] >> THEY HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT
[000:49:42;996] HIS RECORD ON WORKERS RIGHT.
[000:49:44;464] THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE BASE,
[000:49:47;968] WOMEN'S RIGHT.
[000:49:48;702] SO THERE ARE SOME RED FLAG
[000:49:50;137] ISSUES THERE.
[000:49:50;671] WHETHER THAT IS USUALLY
[000:49:52;873] DISQUALIFYING, I KNOW A LOT OF
[000:49:54;541] SENATORS ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT
[000:49:55;409] WE'RE SEEING DEMOCRATS SAY
[000:49:56;510] THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM.
[000:49:57;811] >> UP TO THREE, I DO BELIEVE.
[000:50:00;113] THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.
[000:50:02;349] EMILY GOODEN, YOU'RE ON RECORD.
[000:50:05;152] YOU'RE BRAVE.
[000:50:05;919] THANKS.
[000:50:06;253] FOR YEARS THE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT
[000:50:07;521] HAS NOT BEEN WELCOME IN
[000:50:10;023] WASHINGTON D.C.
[000:50:10;490] NOW TODAY THAT IS CHANGING.
[000:50:12;459] THE TRUMP TEAM EXTENDING A HAND
[000:50:15;128] TO THE LEADER.
[000:50:16;496] WE'LL LOOK WHY THIS IS HAPPENING
[000:50:17;864] AND WHAT IT SIGNALS FOR THE
[000:50:19;800] MIDDLE EAST AND POLICY BETWEEN
[000:50:21;968] THE UNITED STATES AND THOSE
[000:50:23;103] COUNTRIES.
[000:50:24;738] STAY TUNED FOR THAT.
[000:50:25;372] WE CONTINUE.
[000:53:44;871] >> SECRETARY OF STATE REX
[000:53:47;474] TILLERSON MEETING WERE THE
[000:53:49;376] EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT AT THE STATE
[000:53:50;911] DEPARTMENT.
[000:53:51;311] THIS COMES ONLY ONE DAY AFTER
[000:53:53;413] PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH THE
[000:53:57;350] AUTHORITARIAN LEADERTHE
[000:53:59;152] WHITE HOUSE, THIS MARKS A MAJOR
[000:54:01;855] SHIFT FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
[000:54:04;357] ADMINISTRATION.
[000:54:04;824] HE NEVER HOSTED THE PRESIDENT
[000:54:06;026] AFTER A MILITARY TAKEOVER FOUR
[000:54:07;894] YEARS AGO.
[000:54:08;428] THE U.S. HAS CONDEMNED EGYPT FOR
[000:54:11;097] HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.
[000:54:13;066] THE GOVERNMENT IS HOLDING AN
[000:54:15;368] AMERICAN AIDE WORKER FOR THREE
[000:54:18;238] YEARS.
