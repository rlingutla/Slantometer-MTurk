[000:00:00;517] THE BIG PICTURE HAS TO COME
[000:00:02;519] FIRST.
[000:00:02;819] TO MY MIND THAT'S
[000:00:05;689] >> HERE WE ARE WATCHING
[000:00:07;123] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST
[000:00:08;792] LADY EXIT AIR FORCE ONE AS THEY
[000:00:11;428] COME TO MEET THE CHINESE
[000:00:12;929] PRESIDENT.
[000:00:13;396] I'LL HAND IT OVER TO SHEPARD
[000:00:15;331] SMITH.
[000:00:15;665] >> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE
[000:00:17;167] WEST COAST.
[000:00:18;034] 3:00 ON THE EAST COAST.
[000:00:19;969] WE'RE WATCHING THREE MAJOR
[000:00:21;471] BREAKING NEWS EVENTS.
[000:00:23;006] FIRST, SOUTH FLORIDA WHERE
[000:00:24;407] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST
[000:00:25;608] ARRIVED.
[000:00:26;142] MOMENTS AGO, SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:00:29;012] TILLERSON SAID THE SECOND MAJOR
[000:00:31;114] SIGNAL OF AN AMERICAN POLICY
[000:00:34;584] CHANGE TOWARDS SYRIA.
[000:00:36;119] HE SAID THE UNITED STATES IS
[000:00:37;887] ORGANIZING AN INTERNATIONAL
[000:00:40;090] COALITION TO RESPOND TO BASHAR
[000:00:42;959] AL-ASSAD'S CHEMICAL ATTACK ON
[000:00:44;694] HIS OWN PEOPLE.
[000:00:45;929] DOES THIS MEAN AMERICAN MILITARY
[000:00:47;731] ACTION IN SYRIA?
[000:00:49;432] IT'S BREAKING NOW.
[000:00:50;767] ON CAPITOL HILL, WE JUST WATCHED
[000:00:52;569] HISTORY UNFOLD.
[000:00:53;803] A MOVE ON THE SENATE FLOOR THAT
[000:00:55;805] COULD FOREVER CHANGE CONGRESS
[000:00:57;907] AND ALSO THE UNITED STATES
[000:00:58;808] SUPREME COURT FOR MANY
[000:00:59;909] GENERATIONS TO COME.
[000:01:01;111] YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE NUCLEAR
[000:01:03;980] OPTION.
[000:01:04;314] TODAY THE SENATE REPUBLICANS
[000:01:05;749] BLEW IT UP.
[000:01:06;516] THE FALL-OUT COULD BE
[000:01:09;018] EXTRAORDINARY.
[000:01:09;452] WE'LL EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT IT
[000:01:10;887] MEANS AND WHY IT MATTERS SO
[000:01:13;223] MUCH.
[000:01:13;523] AND SHAKE-UP IN THE RUSSIA
[000:01:16;025] INVESTIGATION.
[000:01:16;760] THE REPUBLICAN CHAIR OF THE
[000:01:18;128] HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
[000:01:19;529] AGREES TO STEP ASIDE AS HE IS
[000:01:22;799] NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION.
[000:01:24;567] DEVIN NUNES BLAMING WHAT HE
[000:01:26;236] CALLS ACCUSATIONS FROM LEFT-WING
[000:01:28;805] GROUPS.
[000:01:29;606] AHEAD YOU'LL HEAR THE MAN WHO IS
[000:01:31;574] TAKING OVER.
[000:01:32;842] AND WHY THE IRS TOOK MILLIONS OF
[000:01:35;211] DOLLARS FROM PEOPLE THAT DID
[000:01:37;480] ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG.
[000:01:38;715] WHO ARE THE VICTIMS?
[000:01:39;916] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:45;355] IT IS RARE TO HAVE THIS MANY
[000:01:47;724] ENORMOUS STORIES BREAKING AT ONE
[000:01:50;226] TIME.
[000:01:50;593] WE ARE AT THAT TIME.
[000:01:52;028] WE'LL TAKE YOU TO THE FALL-OUT
[000:01:53;530] FROM SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:01:59;369] TILLERSON'S BLOCKBUSTER
[000:02:01;805] ANNOUNCEMENT.
[000:02:02;238] BUT FIRST, THE UNITED STATES
[000:02:03;072] LEGISLATIVELY SPEAKING, THE
[000:02:04;607] ADULTS IN THE ROOM, WHEN THE
[000:02:07;177] COUNTRY GOES TOO FAR LEFT OR
[000:02:08;678] RIGHT, THE SENATE WOULD COOL
[000:02:09;913] THINGS OFF.
[000:02:10;346] FIND SOMETHING CLOSER TO THE
[000:02:11;748] MIDDLE SO THE NATION DOESN'T
[000:02:13;449] SLIDE TO THE EXTREME.
[000:02:15;118] THE SENATE.
[000:02:15;718] THE GUARDRAILS OF DEMOCRACY.
[000:02:20;190] IF THE LEGISLATIVE BUS CAREENS
[000:02:21;391] OVER THE LEFT OR RIGHT, THE
[000:02:24;027] GUARDRAILS BOUNCE THE BUS BACK
[000:02:25;028] TO THE MIDDLE.
[000:02:26;095] IT SERVED OUR REPUBLIC WELL FOR
[000:02:28;131] A COUPLE CENTURIES.
[000:02:30;934] ONLY A SORT OF LEGISLATIVE
[000:02:32;268] NUCLEAR EXPLOSION COULD CHANGE
[000:02:33;670] THAT.
[000:02:33;970] FOR INSTANCE, SUSPEND THE RULES
[000:02:35;872] TO CHANGE THE TRADITION SO THE
[000:02:37;106] SENATE IS MORE LIKE THE HOUSE
[000:02:39;142] AND ONLY NEEDS 51 VOTES INSTEAD
[000:02:41;711] OF 60 TO GET BIG THINGS DONE.
[000:02:43;713] IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTION.
[000:02:46;149] AT LEAST SINCE 1957 AFTER A
[000:02:49;085] THREAT IN 1917 AND TODAY THE
[000:02:50;987] SENATE EXERCISED THAT NUCLEAR
[000:02:53;823] OPTION.
[000:02:54;224] AS OF LAST HOUR, WE'RE IN A NEW
[000:02:56;192] LEGISLATIVE WORLD.
[000:02:56;759] IT MARKS A HISTORIC CHANGE TO
[000:02:58;595] SENATE NORMS THAT COULD AFFECT
[000:03:00;230] OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR REPUBLIC
[000:03:02;365] BEYOND ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES.
[000:03:04;167] THE MOVE LETS REPUBLICANS IN
[000:03:05;768] THIS CASE ADVANCE PRESIDENT
[000:03:08;204] TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE,
[000:03:09;405] NEIL GORSUCH WITH A SIMPLY
[000:03:11;274] MAJORITY OF 51 VOTES INSTEAD OF
[000:03:14;177] 60.
[000:03:14;444] IT SET AS PRECEDENT THAT
[000:03:16;045] ANALYSTS SAY THAT WILL ALLOW ANY
[000:03:17;847] PARTY TO CONTROL THE SENATE TO
[000:03:19;749] APPROVE SUPREME COURT NOMINEES
[000:03:21;351] WITHOUT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.
[000:03:22;852] LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH PARTIES ARE
[000:03:23;953] BLAMING EACH OTHER.
[000:03:25;555] THE TRUTH BE TOLD, THEY'RE ALL
[000:03:26;990] TO BLAME.
[000:03:27;690] REPUBLICANS SAY THEY HAD TO USE
[000:03:29;325] THE NUCLEAR OPTION BECAUSE
[000:03:32;195] DEMOCRATS FILIBUSTERED JUST
[000:03:34;831] GORSUCH'S NOMINATION.
[000:03:35;765] HIS NOMINATION VOTE IS SET FOR
[000:03:38;902] TOMORROW.
[000:03:39;269] DEMOCRATS ARE BLAMING GOP
[000:03:42;171] LEADERS BECAUSE THEY NEVER HELD
[000:03:44;173] HEARINGS FOR MERRICK GARLAND.
[000:03:45;675] MITCH McCONNELL SAID DEMOCRATS
[000:03:46;910] OVER THE YEARS HAVE REPEATEDLY
[000:03:48;611] RAISED THE STAKES IN
[000:03:50;280] CONFIRMATION BATTLES.
[000:03:51;347] >> THE OPPOSITION TO THIS
[000:03:52;515] PARTICULAR NOMINEE IS MORE ABOUT
[000:03:53;816] THE MAN THAT NOMINATED HIM AND
[000:04:00;189] THE PARTY HE REPRESENTS THAN THE
[000:04:04;193] NOMINEE HIMSELF.
[000:04:04;761] IT'S PART OF A MUCH LARGER
[000:04:07;163] STORY, ANOTHER EXTREME
[000:04:09;432] ESCALATION IN THE LEFT'S
[000:04:13;670] NEVER-ENDING DRIVE TO POLITICIZE
[000:04:15;071] THE COURTS AND THE CONFIRMATION
[000:04:17;106] PROCESS.
[000:04:18;574] >> THE REPUBLICANS SAY HARRY
[000:04:21;010] REID STARTED ALL OF THIS IN 2013
[000:04:24;614] WHEN HE ALLOWED THE SAME NUCLEAR
[000:04:28;284] OPTION FOR OBAMA'S NOMINEES FOR
[000:04:30;620] EVERYONE EXCEPT THE SUPREME
[000:04:33;022] COURT.
[000:04:33;323] AND THEN MITCH McCONNELL CALLED
[000:04:34;390] IT A DEMOCRATIC POWER GRAB AND A
[000:04:36;526] SAD DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE
[000:04:38;061] SENATE.
[000:04:38;394] THAT WAS 2013.
[000:04:40;263] THE CURRENT SENATE MAJORITY
[000:04:42;298] LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER SAID
[000:04:43;533] DEMOCRATS AT THE TIME HAD TO USE
[000:04:44;867] THE NUCLEAR OPTION BECAUSE
[000:04:46;836] REPUBLICANS WERE USING THE
[000:04:49;305] FILIBUSTER TO STONEWALL
[000:04:50;940] NOMINEES.
[000:04:51;307] >> THE TRUTH IS, OVER THE LONG
[000:04:54;177] HISTORY OF PARTISAN COMBAT OVER
[000:04:57;413] JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS, THERE'S
[000:04:59;115] BLAME ON BOTH SIDES.
[000:05:00;116] WE BELIEVE THE BLAME SHOULD NOT
[000:05:01;918] BE SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN
[000:05:03;519] REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
[000:05:06;055] WE BELIEVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
[000:05:07;657] HAS BEEN FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IN
[000:05:09;993] THE ESCALATION OF TACTICS AND IN
[000:05:13;229] THE SELECTION OF EXTREME
[000:05:15;331] JUDICIAL CANDIDATES WHILE
[000:05:17;934] DEMOCRATS HAVE TENDED TO SELECT
[000:05:19;168] JUDGES CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE.
[000:05:20;470] >> OF COURSE HE DOES.
[000:05:21;504] HE'S THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER.
[000:05:22;739] THE REPUBLICANS SAY THE SAME
[000:05:24;107] THING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.
[000:05:25;541] MANY DEMOCRATS EVEN ADMITTED
[000:05:27;110] LONG BEFORE TODAY THAT THEY
[000:05:28;277] SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT THEY
[000:05:29;512] DID IN 2013 BECAUSE IT HAS HURT
[000:05:32;281] THE BODY, BUT THEY DID.
[000:05:34;650] SO NOW NO MORE SUPER MAJORITY
[000:05:36;753] NECESSARY IN THE SENATE.
[000:05:37;987] FOR JUDGES, SUPREME COURT
[000:05:39;889] JUSTICES.
[000:05:40;356] IF THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF
[000:05:41;958] DOMINOES FALLING, FIRST JUDGES
[000:05:43;693] IN 2013, NOW SUPREME COURT
[000:05:46;462] JUSTICES, THE QUESTION IS WILL
[000:05:47;997] THERE COME A TIME THAT THE
[000:05:50;299] SENATE MIGHT SUSPEND THE RULES
[000:05:51;868] TO CHANGE THE RULES FOR ALL
[000:05:53;703] LEGISLATION?
[000:05:54;103] THAT IS POSSIBLE.
[000:05:54;637] THAT IS SORT OF HOW FALLING
[000:05:57;073] DOMINOES TEND TO WORK.
[000:05:58;174] WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
[000:05:59;042] MAYBE WE'LL NEVER GET THERE.
[000:06:01;577] STILL YOU COULD ARGUE OUR
[000:06:03;246] POLITICS HAVE BEEN SO POLARIZED
[000:06:05;048] THAT THE RULES ARE JUST CATCHING
[000:06:09;052] UP WITH THE STATE OF POLITICAL
[000:06:10;953] AFFAIRS.
[000:06:11;287] ONE JUST CHANGED AND THE PROCESS
[000:06:13;356] OF RUNNING OUR NATION CHANGED
[000:06:15;458] WITH IT.
[000:06:16;092] MIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE ON CAPITOL
[000:06:17;460] HILL.
[000:06:17;760] MIKE A DAY FOR THE HISTORY
[000:06:19;195] BOOKS.
[000:06:19;495] >> THAT'S RIGHT, SHEP.
[000:06:20;329] YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE IMPACT.
[000:06:22;632] MISSOURI SENATOR CLAIRE
[000:06:24;534] McCASKILL QUESTIONED HER PARTY'S
[000:06:26;569] STRATEGY.
[000:06:26;936] SHE SUGGESTED IF THE NEXT
[000:06:29;939] VACANCY HAPPENS TO BE JUSTICE
[000:06:31;774] RUTH BADER GINSBERG, ANTHONY
[000:06:35;678] KENNEDY OR STEPHEN BREYER,
[000:06:39;115] DEMOCRATS WILL LIVE TO REGRET
[000:06:42;685] NOT HAVING THE FILIBUSTER.
[000:06:44;954] >> IT'S A BAD -- A VERY SAD DAY
[000:06:47;156] FOR THE SENATE.
[000:06:49;692] BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW DESTROYED
[000:06:52;061] 200 YEARS OF TRADITION OF
[000:06:54;697] REQUIRING 60 VOTES WHICH MEANING
[000:06:56;132] THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE BIPARTISAN
[000:06:57;800] APPROACH TO THESE ISSUES AND
[000:06:59;235] THESE APPOINTMENTS.
[000:07:01;270] I THINK WE'RE ON A SLIPPERY
[000:07:03;139] SLOPE.
[000:07:03;439] >> A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
[000:07:06;075] OTHER REPUBLICANS WERE FURIOUS
[000:07:08;277] WITH CHUCK SCHUMER.
[000:07:09;879] THE SENATE CHAIRMAN ACCUSED OF
[000:07:13;116] TREATING JUDGE GORSUCH UNFAIRLY.
[000:07:14;283] >> THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, THE
[000:07:17;520] MINORITY LED BY THEIR LEADER HAS
[000:07:19;789] BEEN DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR A
[000:07:23;526] JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR
[000:07:26;262] PREPLANNED FILIBUSTER.
[000:07:26;863] OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST
[000:07:29;799] COUPLE MONTHS, THEY'VE TROTTED
[000:07:31;501] OUT ONE EXCUSE AFTER ANOTHER.
[000:07:35;638] BUT NOTHING WILL STICK.
[000:07:38;708] >> THAT LEAVES 30 HOURS OF
[000:07:41;043] DEBATE.
[000:07:41;410] ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT JUDGE
[000:07:43;779] GORSUCH WILL BE CONFIRMED BY
[000:07:45;348] TOMORROW EVENING.
[000:07:46;349] >> WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS SAYING
[000:07:48;751] TODAY, MIKE?
[000:07:49;552] >> THEY'RE FURIOUS WITH MITCH
[000:07:51;487] McCONNELL.
[000:07:52;255] THEY'RE SAYING THAT McCONNELL
[000:07:54;857] DIDN'T TREAT NEIL GORSUCH'S
[000:07:57;193] PREDECESSOR, JUDGE MERRICK
[000:07:59;495] GARLAND, THE LAST NOMINEE
[000:08:01;364] NOMINATED TO THE HIGH COURT.
[000:08:03;132] DEMOCRATS VENTED THEIR ANGER AT
[000:08:04;700] MITCH McCONNELL.
[000:08:06;202] THEY WERE HELPLESS TO STOP THE
[000:08:07;870] SO-CALLED NUCLEAR OPTION AND
[000:08:09;539] BLASTED McCONNELL.
[000:08:10;173] >> SO THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY
[000:08:12;775] HAS MADE HISTORY.
[000:08:13;543] HE COMES TO THE FLOOR AND TELLS
[000:08:14;977] US HISTORY.
[000:08:15;611] HE MADE HISTORY IN THE NUMBER OF
[000:08:17;713] FILIBUSTERS THAT HE USED ON THIS
[000:08:19;282] FLOOR.
[000:08:19;582] HE MADE HISTORY AND DENYING A
[000:08:22;285] PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE THE
[000:08:23;019] OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING AND A
[000:08:25;621] VOTE, WHICH HAD NEVER, NEVER
[000:08:27;256] HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY
[000:08:29;192] OF THE UNITED STATES.
[000:08:30;526] TALK ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.
[000:08:31;861] >> SOURCES ON BOTH SIDES SUGGEST
[000:08:34;931] THERES PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO
[000:08:36;599] AROUND.
[000:08:37;033] WE'RE IN AN ERA OF PARTISANSHIP.
[000:08:39;302] >> Shepard: NO DOUBT.
[000:08:40;002] MIKE EMANUEL ON THE HILL.
[000:08:41;704] THANKS.
[000:08:42;038] LET'S GO TO GREGORY McGARIAN
[000:08:47;276] FROM ST. LOUIS.
[000:08:49;312] LOVE IT THERE.
[000:08:50;246] THE BACKGROUND ON THIS IS IT'S
[000:08:53;082] ALL POLITICS.
[000:08:53;749] THE LEFT IS MAD AT THE RIGHT,
[000:08:55;851] THE RIGHT IS MAD AT THE LEFT.
[000:08:58;754] PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, WHAT DOES
[000:08:59;956] THIS MEAN GOING FORWARD?
[000:09:02;592] >> WELL, IT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR
[000:09:04;493] THE SENATE AND FOR THE SUPREME
[000:09:05;928] COURT.
[000:09:06;229] FOR THE SENATE, AS YOU SAID,
[000:09:08;731] THIS IS SORT OF A STAGE IN A
[000:09:10;566] PROCESS RATHER THAN MAYBE A
[000:09:12;368] SINGLE DEFINING MOMENT.
[000:09:14;704] THE SENATE HAS BEEN MOVING
[000:09:18;140] TOWARD MORE PARTISAN DIVISION.
[000:09:19;809] I THINK, AS YOU SUGGESTED,
[000:09:21;777] REFLECTING THE POLITICS OF THE
[000:09:22;979] NATION AND THE GREATER
[000:09:24;580] DIFFICULTY OF FORGING CONSENSUS
[000:09:26;816] WITHIN THE DELIBERATIVE BODY.
[000:09:28;784] FOR THE SUPREME COURT, THIS MAY
[000:09:31;420] WELL MEAN THAT OVER TIME BOTH
[000:09:33;322] PARTIES ARE -- HAVE A GREATER
[000:09:36;325] INCENTIVE TO PROMOTE JUDGES AND
[000:09:38;995] JUSTICES WHO ARE MORE SHARPLY
[000:09:42;265] IDEALOGICAL AND LEFT CENTRISTS.
[000:09:44;500] >> Shepard: BECAUSE THEY
[000:09:45;167] WOULDN'T NEED TO REACH OUT TO
[000:09:46;435] THE OTHER SIDE TO GET HELP TO
[000:09:48;638] PUSH THOSE THROUGH.
[000:09:49;905] SO IF AS MANY PEOPLE SUSPECT,
[000:09:52;842] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABLE TO
[000:09:54;277] APPOINT ANOTHER SUPREME COURT
[000:09:55;645] JUSTICE.
[000:09:55;978] MIGHT TILT WILDLY RIGHT.
[000:09:57;313] IF THE NEXT PRESIDENT, IF IT
[000:09:58;781] TAKES UNTIL THE NEXT PRESIDENT,
[000:09:59;849] HE OR SHE IS A DEMOCRAT, IT
[000:10:02;018] MIGHT TILT WIDELY LEFT.
[000:10:03;085] THAT INCREASES THE PARTISANSHIP
[000:10:05;855] ALL OVER THE LAND.
[000:10:07;556] >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:10:09;392] ACTUALLY, OVER THE LONG-TERM.
[000:10:11;694] I THINK THERE'S A GOOD
[000:10:14;397] POSSIBILITY THAT THIS WILL
[000:10:15;665] BENEFIT -- I WOULDN'T SAY
[000:10:17;033] BENEFIT DEMOCRATS SO MUCH AS
[000:10:18;401] BENEFIT THE LEFT MORE THAN THE
[000:10:19;869] RIGHT.
[000:10:20;169] >> Shepard: WHY IS THAT?
[000:10:21;170] >> OVER THE PAST COUPLE
[000:10:23;539] GENERATIONS, CONSERVATIVES HAVE
[000:10:24;940] BEEN MUCH MORE ANIMATED
[000:10:26;942] POLITICALLY ABOUT THE SUPREME
[000:10:28;344] COURT.
[000:10:28;711] AS A RESULT, CONSERVATIVE
[000:10:30;713] SUPREME COURT NOMINEES HAVE
[000:10:34;083] GENERALLY BEEN MORE STRONG IN
[000:10:35;418] THEIR IDEALOGICAL CONVICTIONS.
[000:10:37;086] THERE'S BEEN SOME EXCEPTIONS
[000:10:38;421] GOING BACK TO JUSTICE KENNEDY.
[000:10:40;790] IF YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE THOMAS,
[000:10:44;393] JUSTICE SCALIA, CHIEF JUSTICE
[000:10:46;295] ROBERTS, VERY STRONGLY COMMITTED
[000:10:48;431] CONSERVATIVES.
[000:10:48;864] ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, YOU HAD
[000:10:50;766] MORE NOMINATIONS OF JUSTICE
[000:10:53;235] BREYER, JUSTICE KAGAN THAT ARE
[000:10:54;704] ON THE LEFT SIDE, CERTAINLY TO
[000:10:56;739] THE LEFT OF THE REPUBLICAN
[000:10:58;341] APPOINTEE COLLEAGUES.
[000:11:00;242] BUT NOT NEARLY AS FAR TO THE
[000:11:02;878] LEFT AS WARREN COURT GENERATION,
[000:11:04;680] THE LEADERS OF THAT COURT IN THE
[000:11:06;482] 60s THAT WERE SEEN AS LIBERAL
[000:11:08;984] ACTIVISTS.
[000:11:09;819] SO IF THERE IS FROM THIS LOSS OF
[000:11:11;654] THE FILIBUSTER A SORT OF
[000:11:14;223] LIBERATION OF IDEALOGICAL
[000:11:16;158] NOMINEES, THAT LIBERATION WOULD
[000:11:17;860] HAVE A STRONGER EFFECT ON THE
[000:11:20;062] DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAN THE
[000:11:21;364] REPUBLICAN SIDE.
[000:11:22;465] >> Shepard: WHAT EFFECT DOES
[000:11:23;899] THIS HAVE ON FUTURE CHANGES THAT
[000:11:27;336] COULD ALLOW FOR A 51-VOTE ON
[000:11:30;706] REGULAR LEGISLATION?
[000:11:31;440] WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
[000:11:32;742] THE LEADERS TODAY SAY THAT WON'T
[000:11:35;010] HAPPEN.
[000:11:35;344] THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF THAT, IS
[000:11:38;881] THERE?
[000:11:39;648] >> NO.
[000:11:40;850] IT'S TRADITION AND SORT OF
[000:11:43;018] SELF-CONTROL OR FUNNY THINGS.
[000:11:45;154] THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE
[000:11:46;355] SENATE AND THE HOUSE THE POWER
[000:11:48;023] TO SET THEIR OWN RULES.
[000:11:49;658] AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, THOSE
[000:11:51;494] BODIES HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE
[000:11:53;763] THEIR RULES.
[000:11:54;764] SO IN ONE SENSE, THIS COULD BE A
[000:11:57;900] HICCUP.
[000:11:58;234] IT COULD BE A PARTISAN MOMENT.
[000:12:01;470] IN THE FUTURE OF THE SENATE
[000:12:04;840] COULD FULLBACK FROM THIS BRINK.
[000:12:06;542] MORE THAN WHAT THIS CAUSES IS
[000:12:08;144] WHAT IT REPRESENTS.
[000:12:09;111] IT REPRESENTS THE GREATER
[000:12:11;614] DIFFICULTY OF FORGING BIPARTISAN
[000:12:16;619] CONSENSUS AND THE SENATE IS
[000:12:19;722] ADJUSTING TO THE REALITY AND
[000:12:21;323] HAPPENS TO BE AT A MOMENT WHEN
[000:12:23;759] THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN CONTROL
[000:12:24;660] AND TRYING TO GET DONE WHAT THEY
[000:12:26;328] WANT DON'T.
[000:12:26;762] >> Shepard: THIS HAS SEEN AS A
[000:12:28;063] TRADITION BEFORE TODAY.
[000:12:28;697] THE SENATE, THE ONES THAT STEP
[000:12:30;433] UP AND KEEPS THE COUNTRY FROM
[000:12:32;234] GOING TOO FAR ONE WAY OR TOO FOR
[000:12:34;236] THE OTHER.
[000:12:35;004] IS THERE REASONS FOR PEOPLE THAT
[000:12:37;072] HOPE THAT THE CENTER HOLDS IN
[000:12:38;741] THIS NATION IS THERE REAL REASON
[000:12:40;075] FOR THEM TO BE VERY CONCERNED
[000:12:41;610] TODAY OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER
[000:12:42;778] ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT THE
[000:12:46;682] SYSTEM CAN OVERCOME?
[000:12:47;583] >> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE A
[000:12:49;351] MOMENT THE SYSTEM COULD
[000:12:51;220] OVERCOME.
[000:12:51;620] SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON
[000:12:54;657] PERSONALITIES AND POLITICS IN
[000:12:57;460] THE SENATE.
[000:12:59;929] ANYONE THAT IS STRONGLY IN
[000:13:01;831] BIPARTISAN COOPERATION HAS HAD A
[000:13:03;432] LOT OF REASONS TO BUN HAPPY OVER
[000:13:06;068] THE PAST DECADE OR MORE.
[000:13:08;971] I THINK TODAY IS A CONTINUATION
[000:13:10;573] OF THAT.
[000:13:11;040] >> GREGORY MAGARIAN FROM
[000:13:14;176] WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, I
[000:13:15;544] APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
[000:13:16;712] THANK YOU.
[000:13:17;213] >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
[000:13:18;380] >> Shepard: IF YOU WATCHED IN
[000:13:19;582] THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO, YOU
[000:13:21;584] SAW WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE
[000:13:24;086] SHIFT IN UNITED STATES POLICY
[000:13:24;887] TOWARDS SYRIA.
[000:13:25;554] THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN IN THE
[000:13:27;122] MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR.
[000:13:29;625] THE SYRIAN LEADER, BASHAR
[000:13:31;560] AL-ASSAD, BY ALL INTERNATIONAL
[000:13:35;664] OBSERVATION HAS MURDERED
[000:13:37;867] HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN
[000:13:39;435] PEOPLE BY USING BARREL BOMBS AND
[000:13:41;604] ALL KINDS OF EXPLOSIONS THE LAST
[000:13:42;605] MANY YEARS.
[000:13:43;105] THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THERE WAS
[000:13:44;507] VIDEO OF A CHEMICAL ATTACK, A
[000:13:50;246] SARIN GAS ATTACK, ONE
[000:13:52;481] PERPETRATED BY BASHAR AL-ASSAD
[000:13:53;716] HIMSELF AND IT APPEARS THE
[000:13:55;284] POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS
[000:13:56;385] CHANGED IN AN ENORMOUS WAY.
[000:13:59;955] THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT
[000:14:00;923] THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER AN
[000:14:02;525] INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
[000:14:04;093] RESPOND.
[000:14:04;527] IS MILITARY ACTION, BOOTS ON THE
[000:14:06;428] GROUND AHEAD FOR THE UNITED
[000:14:07;730] STATES IN SYRIA?
[000:14:09;465] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
[000:14:10;132] THE RUSSIANS AND THE IRANIANS
[000:14:12;101] ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[000:14:13;702] IT'S BREAKING NEWS AND IT'S
[000:14:14;436] NEXT.
[000:14:18;274] AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
[000:14:18;274] HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.
[000:14:20;276] DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
[000:14:20;276] TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,
[000:14:22;811] OR ADEMPAS® FOR
[000:14:22;811] PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,
[000:14:24;547] AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
[000:14:24;547] DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.
[000:14:26;882] DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IN EXCESS.
[000:14:28;551] TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
[000:14:28;551] GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY
[000:14:30;953] FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
[000:14:30;953] MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.
[000:14:32;955] IF YOU HAVE A SUDDEN DECREASE
[000:14:32;955] OR LOSS OF HEARING OR VISION,
[000:14:35;357] OR AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
[000:14:35;357] STOP TAKING CIALIS
[000:14:37;393] AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.
[000:14:38;928] ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CIALIS.
[000:14:42;898] You totaNobody's hurt, new car.
[000:14:44;500] but there will still be pain.
[000:14:45;968] It comes when your insurance
[000:14:45;968] company says they'll only pay
[000:14:48;737] three-quarters of what
[000:14:48;737] it takes to replace it.
[000:14:51;407] What are you supposed to do?
[000:14:52;641] Drive three-quarters of a car?
[000:14:54;677] Now if you had Liberty Mutual
[000:14:54;677] New Car Replacement™,
[000:14:57;146] you'd get your whole car back.
[000:14:59;682] I guess they don't want you
[000:14:59;682] driving around on three wheels.
[000:15:02;751] Smart.
[000:15:03;953] With Liberty Mutual
[000:15:03;953] New Car Replacement™,
[000:15:05;688] we'll replace the full
[000:15:05;688] value of your car.
[000:15:08;023] Liberty Stands With You™.
[000:15:09;491] Liberty Mutual Insurance.
[000:16:47;556] >> Shepard: THERE'S BREAKING
[000:16:49;358] NEWS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:16:50;959] FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY
[000:16:52;127] SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TO BASHAR
[000:16:53;095] AL-ASSAD HAS CHANGED.
[000:16:54;096] IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES, ANOTHER
[000:16:57;800] SIGN.
[000:16:58;100] SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON
[000:17:00;169] ANNOUNCING THAT "STEPS ARE
[000:17:01;870] UNDERWAY TO ORGANIZE AN
[000:17:03;605] INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
[000:17:04;740] REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN
[000:17:06;909] DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, FROM
[000:17:07;743] POWER FOLLOWING THIS WEEK'S
[000:17:10;312] APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK IN THE
[000:17:12;147] WAR-TORN COUNTRY."
[000:17:13;716] REGIME CHANGE.
[000:17:14;650] THAT'S BRAND NEW.
[000:17:15;484] THIS REPRESENTS AN ENORMOUS
[000:17:18;187] DEPARTURE FROM DAYS AGAINST WHEN
[000:17:20;155] THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE SYRIANS
[000:17:21;990] SHOULD DECIDE.
[000:17:22;991] THEN IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO
[000:17:25;327] TRY TO REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD
[000:17:26;328] FROM POWER AND THAT THE FOCUS
[000:17:28;430] SHOULD BE ON DEFEATING ISIS.
[000:17:30;632] NOW WE LEARNED THAT SYRIA'S
[000:17:32;701] FOREIGN MINISTER HAS DENIED THAT
[000:17:34;470] HIS GOVERNMENT USED CHEMICAL
[000:17:39;108] WEAPONS
[000:17:43;112] WEAPONS IN  ATTACKS.
[000:17:44;513] 86 PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING DOZENS
[000:17:46;648] OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
[000:17:48;183] THEY SAID THE POISON GAS ATTACK
[000:17:50;686] INJURED HUNDREDS MORE.
[000:17:51;687] RUSSIA IS A KEY ALLY OF
[000:17:54;523] AL-ASSAD.
[000:17:54;890] THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH
[000:17:56;091] THE SYRIANS.
[000:17:57;493] THE IRANIANS ARE IN THE MIX
[000:18:05;300] SUPPORTING HEZBOLLAH.
[000:18:07;503] A SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A REBEL
[000:18:14;042] FACTORY.
[000:18:14;376] SO THE RUSSIANS SAY IT HAPPENED
[000:18:15;811] THE OTHER WAY.
[000:18:16;712] THE AMERICANS SAY IT HAPPENED
[000:18:17;880] ANOTHER.
[000:18:18;213] THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THIS SIDE,
[000:18:20;149] THE AMERICANS ARE ON THE OTHER.
[000:18:22;618] IN THE SENDER IS BASHAR
[000:18:24;052] AL-ASSAD.
[000:18:24;419] THE RUSSIANS HAVE PROPPED HIM
[000:18:25;788] UP.
[000:18:26;054] THE RUSSIANS SAY THAT BASHAR
[000:18:27;656] AL-ASSAD SHOULD STAY IN POWER.
[000:18:29;124] THE RUSSIANS ARE SUPPORTING HIM.
[000:18:31;727] THE AMERICANS JUST SAID WE'RE
[000:18:33;929] ORGANIZING A COALITION TO TAKE
[000:18:36;031] HIM OUT.
[000:18:36;565] THAT MEANS THE UNITED STATES
[000:18:37;733] WITH SYRIAN REBELS AGAINST THE
[000:18:40;169] SYRIANS, THE RUSSIANS AND THE
[000:18:42;237] IRANIANS THAT SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.
[000:18:44;807] SO FAR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MANY
[000:18:46;141] OTHER WORLD LEADERS SAY THE
[000:18:47;776] SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS FLATLY TO
[000:18:49;411] BLAME.
[000:18:49;711] THE TRUTH IS, THE SYRIAN
[000:18:51;246] GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MURDERING
[000:18:53;649] ITS OWN PEOPLE FOR YEARS.
[000:18:54;716] BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.
[000:18:56;652] THESE PICTURES ARE NEW.
[000:18:58;453] THIS INCIDENT IS NEW.
[000:19:01;590] THIS SITUATION IS VERY OLD.
[000:19:04;393] THEY DROPPED BARREL BOMBS FROM
[000:19:05;561] THE SKY AND MURDERS CHILDREN IN
[000:19:07;229] THEIR BEDS ON A DAILY BASIS.
[000:19:09;731] BUT THESE PICTURES AND THIS
[000:19:12;167] INCIDENT IS NEW ALONG WITH THIS
[000:19:14;703] PRESIDENT AND HIS ENTOURAGE.
[000:19:18;874] NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE
[000:19:20;509] HORRIBLE IMAGES FROM THIS WEEK'S
[000:19:23;078] ATTACK MADE HIM CHANGE HIS
[000:19:25;514] ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD.
[000:19:28;817] >> IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.
[000:19:30;819] YOU SEE BABIES DEAD FROM GAS AND
[000:19:33;789] A VERY HEINOUS FORM OF GAS,
[000:19:36;391] WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE
[000:19:37;726] ACCESS, TO IT'S BAD STUFF.
[000:19:39;895] REALLY BAD.
[000:19:40;796] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
[000:19:43;465] SAID THAT THE AL-ASSAD REGIME'S
[000:19:47;903] ACTIONS CANNOT BE TOLERATED.
[000:19:50;739] AND NOW VLADIMIR PUTIN IS
[000:19:52;774] ACCUSING PRESIDENT TRUMP OF
[000:19:54;509] RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.
[000:19:55;177] THE RUSSIANS SAYING ONE THING
[000:19:56;612] AND THE AMERICANS SAYING
[000:19:58;380] ANOTHER.
[000:19:58;714] THE AMERICANS ORGANIZING A
[000:20:00;048] COALITION TO SETTLE IT ALL.
[000:20:02;184] HERE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:20:03;585] REX TILLERSON SAID 30 MINUTES
[000:20:05;854] AGO.
[000:20:06;121] >> OBVIOUSLY THE EVENTS THAT
[000:20:07;789] HAVE OCCURRED IN SYRIA WITH THE
[000:20:09;725] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK HERE IN
[000:20:13;528] THE PAST DAY HAVE JUST I THINK
[000:20:16;865] HORRIFIED ALL OF US AND BROUGHT
[000:20:18;367] TO THE FRONT PAGES INTO OUR
[000:20:21;603] TELEVISION SCREENS AS WELL.
[000:20:22;471] THE TRAGEDY THAT IS PART OF THE
[000:20:26;308] SYRIAN CONFLICT.
[000:20:29;177] THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS
[000:20:30;712] AND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE
[000:20:33;448] SUPPORTS THAT SYRIA, THE SYRIAN
[000:20:37;185] REGIME ON ORDERS OF PRESIDENT
[000:20:39;488] BASHAR AL-ASSAD ARE RESPONSIBLE
[000:20:40;289] FOR THIS ATTACK.
[000:20:41;423] AND I THINK FURTHER IT IS VERY
[000:20:44;026] IMPORTANT THAT THE RUSSIAN
[000:20:46;128] GOVERNMENT CONSIDER CAREFULLY
[000:20:47;296] THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE
[000:20:51;066] ASSAD REGIME.
[000:20:52;000] >> Shepard: TODAY A SPOKESMAN
[000:20:54;069] FOR THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SAID
[000:20:55;671] WE WOULD WELCOME A MORE
[000:20:58;407] CONSIDERED APPROACH.
[000:20:59;374] IT IS A PERILOUS SET OF
[000:21:01;476] CIRCUMSTANCES NOW.
[000:21:02;144] THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN
[000:21:04;646] SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD FOR A LONG
[000:21:05;814] TIME.
[000:21:06;114] AL-ASSAD HAS BEEN MURDERING HIS
[000:21:07;449] OWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME.
[000:21:09;284] HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS HAVE
[000:21:11;253] BEEN IN ON THAT EFFORT FOR A
[000:21:13;956] LONG TIME AS THE UNITED STATES
[000:21:17;025] SUPPORTS THE REBELS.
[000:21:18;093] NOW THE QUESTION IS, DO WE
[000:21:19;695] LAUNCH WITH A COALITION THAT HAS
[000:21:21;964] BEEN SUGGESTED A MILITARY STRIKE
[000:21:24;166] TO REMOVE THE MURDEROUS DICTATOR
[000:21:26;134] FROM THAT COUNTRY?
[000:21:27;569] IF SO, WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS?
[000:21:30;072] WHO FILLS THE VOID THAT BASHAR
[000:21:31;840] AL-ASSAD HAS HELD.
[000:21:33;375] THOSE ARE THE VERY BIG QUESTIONS
[000:21:34;776] THAT HAVE JUST ARISEN ON AN
[000:21:41;149] ENORMOUS NEWS DAY.
[000:21:44;052] RICH EDSON WITH ANALYSIS WITH
[000:21:46;822] A.B. STODDARD.
[000:21:48;657] THAT'S NEXT ON A THURSDAY ON THE
[000:21:49;458] FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:21:49;992] Crohn's disease,...
[000:21:51;827] ...I was always searching for
[000:21:51;827] ways to manage my symptoms.
[000:21:55;831] I thought I had it covered.
[000:21:58;000] Then I realized managing was
[000:21:58;000] all I was doing.
[000:22:01;703] When I finally told my doctor,
[000:22:02;904] he said HUMIRA was for people
[000:22:02;904] like me
[000:22:04;740] who have tried other
[000:22:04;740] medications,...
[000:22:06;174] but still experience the
[000:22:06;174] symptoms
[000:22:07;442] of moderate to severe
[000:22:07;442] Crohn's disease.
[000:22:09;344] In clinical studies,
[000:22:10;245] the majority of patients
[000:22:10;245] on HUMIRA
[000:22:11;847] saw significant symptom
[000:22:11;847] relief...
[000:22:13;181] ...and many achieved remission.
[000:22:14;850] HUMIRA can lower your ability to
[000:22:14;850] fight infections...
[000:22:17;319] ...including tuberculosis.
[000:22:18;553] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:22:18;553] infections and cancers,...
[000:22:20;822] including lymphoma, have
[000:22:20;822] happened;
[000:22:22;791] as have blood, liver, and
[000:22:22;791] nervous system problems,
[000:22:24;993] serious allergic
[000:22:24;993] reactions,...
[000:22:26;294] ...and new or worsening heart
[000:22:26;294] failure.
[000:22:27;929] Before treatment, get tested
[000:22:27;929] for TB.
[000:22:30;332] Tell your doctor if you've been
[000:22:30;332] to areas
[000:22:32;000] where certain fungal infections
[000:22:32;000] are common,
[000:22:33;935] and if you've had TB,...
[000:22:35;203] ...hepatitis B, are prone to
[000:22:35;203] infections,
[000:22:37;472] ...or have flu-like symptoms
[000:22:37;472] or sores.
[000:22:39;274] Don't start HUMIRA if you have
[000:22:39;274] an infection.
[000:22:41;343] If you're still just managing
[000:22:41;343] your symptoms,
[000:22:43;311] ask your gastroenterologist
[000:22:43;311] about HUMIRA.
[000:22:45;747] With HUMIRA, remission
[000:22:45;747] is possible.
[000:25:03;301] >> WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT
[000:25:05;070] APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FOR THIS
[000:25:06;137] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK WHICH
[000:25:10;041] VIOLATES ALL PREVIOUS U.N.
[000:25:12;978] RESOLUTIONS, VIOLATES
[000:25:14;479] INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND
[000:25:16;014] LONG-HELD AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
[000:25:17;048] PARTIES INCLUDING SYRIAN REGIME,
[000:25:19;217] THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND ALL
[000:25:20;619] OTHER MEMBERS OF THE U.N.
[000:25:21;953] SECURITY COUNCIL.
[000:25:22;621] IT'S A SERIOUS MATTER.
[000:25:24;556] IT REQUIRES A SERIOUS RESPONSE.
[000:25:26;825] >> Shepard: GASSING YOUR OWN
[000:25:28;193] PEOPLE IS A WAR CRIME.
[000:25:29;761] BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE SYRIAN
[000:25:32;230] DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, HAS
[000:25:33;532] BEEN MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE
[000:25:35;233] HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FOR YEARS.
[000:25:37;869] NOW 30 MINUTES AGO WE LEARNED
[000:25:40;171] THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARING
[000:25:41;573] TO TAKE ACTION.
[000:25:42;374] IT'S BREAKING NEWS AND RICH
[000:25:43;742] EDSON IS ON IT AT THE STATE
[000:25:46;077] DEPARTMENT.
[000:25:46;678] RICH?
[000:25:46;978] >> THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS
[000:25:48;013] THAT STEPS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE
[000:25:50;348] UNITED STATES TO LEAD AN
[000:25:52;350] INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
[000:25:54;286] REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD FROM
[000:25:55;787] POWER.
[000:25:56;821] JUST A WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY
[000:25:58;523] OF STATE ASKED ABOUT THIS IN
[000:26:00;125] TURKEY.
[000:26:00;458] HIS RESPONSE TO THAT WAS THAT IT
[000:26:02;160] IS UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO
[000:26:04;262] DECIDE THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF
[000:26:06;531] BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
[000:26:07;032] SO THIS CHEMICAL ATTACK
[000:26:09;134] REPRESENTING A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN
[000:26:11;770] THE POSITION, MUCH MORE DETAILED
[000:26:13;939] FROM THE UNITED STATES AND
[000:26:15;373] SECRETARY TILLERSON THAN HE
[000:26:16;675] SPOKE ABOUT A WEEK AGO IN
[000:26:18;510] TURKEY.
[000:26:18;843] THIS IS AS THE SECRETARY SAYS
[000:26:20;812] THERE'S NO DOUBT THE REGIME OF
[000:26:23;648] BASHAR AL-ASSAD IS RESPONSIBLE
[000:26:24;416] FOR THE CHEMICAL ATTACK THIS
[000:26:25;884] WEEK ON HIS OWN CITIZENS.
[000:26:29;254] THERE'S RUSSIA ANGLE AS YOU HAVE
[000:26:31;823] DISCUSSED.
[000:26:32;190] THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT
[000:26:33;692] RUSSIA NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT ITS
[000:26:34;993] SUPPORT FOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND
[000:26:35;894] THIS IS ONE WEEK AHEAD OF
[000:26:38;597] SECRETARY OF STATE REX
[000:26:40;365] TILLERSON'S VISIT TO MOSCOW
[000:26:44;436] WHERE HE WILL MEET WITH THE
[000:26:46;571] STATE DEPARTMENT THERE.
[000:26:47;706] OFFICIALS SAY THE CHEMICAL
[000:26:49;774] ATTACK WILL COLOR THOSE
[000:26:51;409] DISCUSSIONS.
[000:26:51;810] STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAY
[000:26:54;713] THAT THE UNITED STATES WITH
[000:26:56;514] SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
[000:26:57;449] STILL EXPLORE A RELATIONSHIP
[000:26:59;451] WORKING TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA ON
[000:27:01;019] AREAS THAT BENEFIT THE UNITED
[000:27:02;387] STATES.
[000:27:02;721] THIS ALL COMING ONE WEEK AHEAD
[000:27:05;090] OF THAT VISIT, SHEP, AS THE
[000:27:11;730] SECRETARY OF STATE SPEAKING AT
[000:27:13;231] LENGTH ABOUT SYRIA PREVIOUS TO
[000:27:14;833] THIS SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS
[000:27:17;002] ALREADY IN DISCUSSIONS, TALKING
[000:27:19;771] ABOUT A POST AL-ASSAD SYRIA AND
[000:27:21;272] AS YOU PLAYED LEADING INTO OUR
[000:27:23;274] DISCUSSION HERE, THAT THE U.S.
[000:27:25;910] IS LEAVING A NUMBER OF OPTIONS
[000:27:27;912] ON THE TABLE IN RESPONDING TO
[000:27:30;615] THIS.
[000:27:31;583] SHEP?
[000:27:31;883] >> Shepard: THANKS.
[000:27:34;519] A.B. STODDARD WITH
[000:27:37;555] REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM.
[000:27:38;123] THIS STORY JUST BREAKING.
[000:27:40;725] PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVEN AS A
[000:27:42;127] LIST OF BAD OPTIONS.
[000:27:43;928] HE CHOSE THE BAD OPTION THAT WAS
[000:27:45;597] TO REMAIN OUT OF THIS CONFLICT
[000:27:48;133] LARGELY.
[000:27:48;466] WE'VE HAD VERY BAD RESULTS.
[000:27:50;869] THERE'S NO QUESTIONING THIS.
[000:27:52;137] NOW AS A PATTERN BY AL-ASSAD
[000:27:55;106] CONTINUES, THIS PRESIDENT HAS
[000:27:55;874] MADE ANOTHER DECISION.
[000:27:56;675] WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE,
[000:27:59;077] A.B.?
[000:27:59;411] >> SHEP, YOU POINT OUT CORRECTLY
[000:28:00;912] THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A
[000:28:02;814] LONG TIME.
[000:28:03;314] PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW THERE WERE
[000:28:04;616] CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN THE PAST,
[000:28:06;618] THAT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS
[000:28:10;088] PRESIDENT HAD BEEN BUTCHERING
[000:28:11;756] HIS OWN CIVILIANS TO THE TUNE OF
[000:28:15;894] 500,000 PEOPLE OVER SEVEN YEARS.
[000:28:18;763] RE LENTLESSLY.
[000:28:21;700] THIS IS A VERY BIG CHANGE OF
[000:28:23;268] MIND AFTER THE ATTACK.
[000:28:24;769] ALTHOUGH THE IMAGES ARE
[000:28:27;906] GRUESOME, THE ATTACKS HAVE NOT
[000:28:29;841] CHANGED.
[000:28:30;475] SO THE QUESTION IS NOT THAT
[000:28:32;277] THERE'S JUST A RUSSIAN ANGLE
[000:28:35;947] HERE, THE RUSSIAN PART IS
[000:28:38;483] EVERYTHING.
[000:28:39;417] TILLERSON GOES TO MOSCOW TO TRY
[000:28:41;453] TO KEEP AN AVENUE OPEN ON ISSUES
[000:28:43;121] THAT WE CAN WORK ON WITH THE
[000:28:45;590] RUSSIANS.
[000:28:45;957] THEY ARE BACKING THIS BRUTAL
[000:28:49;327] DICTATOR WHO IS MURDERING HIS
[000:28:50;995] PEOPLE AND DON'T INTEND TO BACK
[000:28:52;764] DOWN.
[000:28:53;064] THEY'RE MAKING EQUIVOCATING
[000:28:55;133] COMMENTS TODAY THAT IF IT WASN'T
[000:28:56;701] REALLY AN ATTACK, A ACCIDENTAL
[000:28:59;070] ATTACK ON A WEAPONS FACTORY RUN
[000:29:01;072] BY THE REBELS, THAT WOULD BE OUT
[000:29:06;377] OF THE NORMS.
[000:29:07;178] THEY THINK THE U.N. SHOULD DO AN
[000:29:10;482] INVESTIGATION.
[000:29:10;915] WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN BACKING
[000:29:12;484] THIS REGIME, FIGHTING ITS OWN
[000:29:14;552] PEOPLE, NOT ISIS.
[000:29:15;487] SO AT THIS POINT, WHAT IS
[000:29:18;056] PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTING OF THE
[000:29:19;924] RUSSIANS?
[000:29:20;358] ARE WE GOING TO GO TO WAR
[000:29:22;293] AGAINST THEM OR ARE WE GOING TO
[000:29:24;496] TRY TO COAX THE RUSSIANS INTO
[000:29:26;965] DEPOSING AL-ASSAD WITH US?
[000:29:28;399] THAT IS EVERYTHING IN THIS
[000:29:30;702] EQUATION.
[000:29:31;069] WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE
[000:29:35;106] RUSSIANS.
[000:29:35;473] WHAT DO THE ADMINISTRATION
[000:29:36;474] THINKS THEY CAN GET THE RUSSIANS
[000:29:37;976] TO DO?
[000:29:38;376] >> WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT THE
[000:29:40;678] UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF
[000:29:41;913] THE WEST TO BACK OFF ON THEIR
[000:29:44;816] ANNEXATION, THEIR INVASION AND
[000:29:46;518] ANNEXING OF CRIMEA.
[000:29:49;854] WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT NATO'S
[000:29:53;158] FRONT NOT TO BE SO CLOSE TO THE
[000:29:55;193] RUSSIANS.
[000:29:55;593] THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF DESIRES.
[000:29:57;796] IT'S A MATTER OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE
[000:29:59;798] WILLING TO GIVE.
[000:30:00;298] >> IF WE GAVE THEM ALL OF THOSE
[000:30:02;567] CONCESSIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE,
[000:30:04;135] THEY WOULD -- PUTIN IS ENJOYING
[000:30:06;971] A SUPREMACY THAT HE'S NEVER HAD
[000:30:09;507] BEFORE.
[000:30:09;841] HE RESCUED PRESIDENT OBAMA IN
[000:30:12;177] 2013 SO THAT HE COULD RETREAT
[000:30:14;012] FROM HIS THREAT OF AIR STRIKES
[000:30:15;914] WITH THIS DEAL HE NEGOTIATED TO
[000:30:19;017] GET ALL THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS OUT
[000:30:21;052] OF SYRIA.
[000:30:24;055] THAT IS A HOAX.
[000:30:26;224] I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BACK
[000:30:27;959] AWAY FROM HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH
[000:30:29;961] THE IRANIAN REGIME AND THE
[000:30:32;964] SYRIAN REGIME.
[000:30:34;132] HE'S PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE
[000:30:36;134] ANT I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY
[000:30:38;036] INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN OVER
[000:30:39;838] WHAT CONCESSIONS WE GIVE.
[000:30:41;706] >> Shepard: WE'RE STILL IN THE
[000:30:42;507] WORDS CATEGORY.
[000:30:43;808] THIS IS NOTHING BUT TALK AT
[000:30:45;076] LEAST AT THIS MOMENT.
[000:30:46;744] IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE PLANS
[000:30:51;015] ARE BEING DRAWN UP.
[000:30:54;319] THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN PENTAGON
[000:30:58;556] GAME PLANS.
[000:30:59;123] HEZBOLLAH IS IN THERE AND THE
[000:31:01;659] IRANIANS SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.
[000:31:03;695] WE HAVE UNITED STATES FORCES ON
[000:31:05;396] THE GROUND.
[000:31:05;830] HOWEVER QUIETLY.
[000:31:06;731] THEY ARE THERE FIGHTING AGAINST
[000:31:08;199] ISIS.
[000:31:08;499] THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE GROUND
[000:31:11;035] SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD.
[000:31:12;136] YOU HAVE THIS TOXIC MIX OF ALL
[000:31:14;038] OF THOSE PEOPLE AND TO REMOVE
[000:31:15;773] THIS MAN FROM POWER, REGIME
[000:31:18;776] CHANGE, SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH
[000:31:20;078] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RAILED FOR
[000:31:21;746] YEARS.
[000:31:22;313] COULD REALLY UPSET THE
[000:31:24;816] EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT REGION AND
[000:31:26;017] AROUND THE WORLD.
[000:31:26;651] WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT I RAN HERE,
[000:31:29;287] HEZBOLLAH, RUSSIA, THE UNITED
[000:31:30;388] STATES AND SYRIA, THAT IS ALMOST
[000:31:32;657] A WORLD WAR DEFINED OR AT LEAST
[000:31:35;093] YOU RISK THAT POSSIBILITY.
[000:31:36;461] >> RIGHT.
[000:31:37;328] THAT'S THE THING.
[000:31:38;129] IF HE WANTS TO DO SOME AIR
[000:31:39;430] STRIKES ON THE WEAPONS ARSENALS,
[000:31:41;666] THAT'S ONE THING.
[000:31:42;834] OBVIOUSLY REGIME CHANGE IS A
[000:31:44;435] HUGE OCCUPATION OF SYRIA AND A
[000:31:46;638] MASSIVE GROUND WAR IN WHICH YOU
[000:31:48;439] MENTIONED THERE'S SO MANY SIDES
[000:31:49;240] AND PROXY FIGHTS GOING ON.
[000:31:51;709] AGAIN, ARE WE GOING TO DO IT
[000:31:53;077] WITH THE RUSSIANS OR NOT?
[000:31:54;646] THAT'S THE QUESTION.
[000:31:55;747] WE'LL LEARN MORE IN WEEKS TO
[000:31:57;081] COME.
[000:31:57;382] >> Shepard: WE NEED TO DISCUSS
[000:31:58;182] THIS FURTHER.
[000:31:58;683] THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT
[000:32:00;051] HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED,
[000:32:02;854] DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES.
[000:32:04;722] A.B. WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
[000:32:06;291] WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL
[000:32:07;659] BREAK.
[000:32:07;959] IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, WE HAVE A
[000:32:09;294] MINUTE OF OTHER HEADLINES.
[000:32:11;095] AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK TO THIS.
[000:32:12;997] ORGANIZING A COALITION FOR
[000:32:13;665] SYRIA.
[000:32:20;805] But with added touches you can't
[000:32:20;805] get everywhere else,
[000:32:23;041] like Claim Free Rewards...
[000:32:24;909] or Safe Driving Bonus Checks.
[000:32:27;245] Oh Yes....
[000:32:28;813] Even a Claim Satisfaction
[000:32:30;248] Guaranteeeeeeeeeee!
[000:32:33;785] IN means protection
[000:32:33;785] plus unique extras
[000:32:36;287] only from an expert
[000:32:36;287] Allstate agent.
[000:32:38;256] It's good to be in,
[000:32:38;256] good hands.
[000:34:17;422] >> I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE
[000:34:18;923] FOX REPORT.
[000:34:19;791] RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE
[000:34:21;759] DIFFUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE
[000:34:23;361] DEVICE IN ST. PETERSBURG AND
[000:34:26;064] ARRESTED THREE PEOPLE IN
[000:34:27;799] CONNECTION WITH THE SUBWAY
[000:34:29;367] BOMBING.
[000:34:29;700] THE DEVICE TURNED UP IN THE
[000:34:31;502] APARTMENT WHERE THE SUSPECT
[000:34:32;570] LIVED.
[000:34:32;870] THEY'RE ACCUSED OF HAVING TIES
[000:34:34;539] TO THE SUICIDE BOMBER THAT
[000:34:37;942] KILLED 13 OTHERS ON MONDAY.
[000:34:41;345] A WOMAN THAT FELL 60 FEET TO THE
[000:34:43;581] GROUND WHILE TAKING A SELFIE ON
[000:34:45;216] A BRIDGE IS NOT LIKELY TO FACE
[000:34:47;819] CHARGES.
[000:34:48;152] THAT'S THE WORDS FROM SHERIFF
[000:34:50;054] DEPUTIES.
[000:34:50;588] CREWED AIRLIFTED HER AND SHE'S
[000:34:53;024] EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.

[000:34:59;097] CEMETERY TO SAY THEIR FINAL
[000:35:00;798] GOOD-BYES.
[000:35:01;165] GLENN WAS THE FIRST AMERICAN TO
[000:35:03;067] ORBIT THE EARTH.
[000:35:04;635] HE DIED IN DECEMBER AT AGE 95.
[000:35:08;072] RELATIVES SAID THEY HAD THE
[000:35:10;041] FUNERAL TODAY BECAUSE IT WOULD
[000:35:11;109] HAVE BEEN HIS 75th ANNIVERSARY
[000:35:13;945] WITH HIS WIFE, ANNIE.
[000:35:16;347] THE NEWS WITH SHEP CONTINUES
[000:35:17;615] AFTER THIS.
[000:37:16;434] >> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS ON FOX
[000:37:18;035] NEWS CHANNEL AND MUCH MORE ON
[000:37:20;338] SECRETARY TILLER SEASON.
[000:37:21;205] THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:37:22;206] ANNOUNCING THAT STEPS ARE
[000:37:23;140] UNDERWAY TO FORM AN
[000:37:24;208] INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
[000:37:25;343] REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN
[000:37:27;478] DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
[000:37:28;679] THIS AFTER INTERNATIONAL
[000:37:30;181] INVESTIGATORS SAY HE LAUNCHED
[000:37:31;382] ANOTHER CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
[000:37:33;084] KILLING DOZENS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE
[000:37:35;620] AN INJURING DOZENS AND CHILDREN
[000:37:38;055] AS THEY SLEPT IN THEIR BEDS.
[000:37:39;390] LET'S GO BACK TO A.B. STODDARD
[000:37:42;326] FROM REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM.
[000:37:44;595] YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY OUT
[000:37:48;266] STRATEGIC AIR STRIKES.
[000:37:49;066] IN 2015, THE RUSSIANS WENT IN
[000:37:51;302] AND OWNED THE AIR BASES.
[000:37:52;903] THAT I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT
[000:37:54;438] BASES AND MISSILE DEFENSE
[000:37:55;706] SYSTEMS THERE.
[000:37:56;307] THE IDEA THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD
[000:37:59;143] ALLOW US TO STRIKE THE SIX AIR
[000:38:01;646] STRIKES THAT EXIST SEEMS AT THIS
[000:38:04;749] MOMENT IMPLAUSIBLE.
[000:38:07;285] >> RIGHT.
[000:38:07;885] THERE'S RUSSIANS EVERYWHERE
[000:38:10;921] THERE.
[000:38:11;222] SO THE POTENTIAL FOR AN
[000:38:13;357] ACCIDENT, WHICH WE ALMOST HAD IN
[000:38:15;493] 2015 WITH OUR MORE LIMITED AIR
[000:38:17;361] STRIKES WITH THE RUSSIANS AND
[000:38:20;131] STARTING WORLD WAR III WITH THEM
[000:38:23;567] IS VERY HIGH.
[000:38:24;302] SO I DON'T KNOW -- IT'S
[000:38:25;903] INTERESTING THAT TRUMP SAID
[000:38:26;804] UNTIL YESTERDAY THAT HE DOESN'T
[000:38:28;205] TELEGRAPH WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO
[000:38:30;241] AND HE LIKES TO DO THINGS
[000:38:32;710] SECRETLY.
[000:38:33;077] HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN
[000:38:34;745] INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO TAKE
[000:38:35;846] OUT AL-ASSAD WITH ALL OF THESE
[000:38:37;381] TERRIBLE OPTIONS.
[000:38:38;349] IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO
[000:38:40;551] SEE WHAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING,
[000:38:41;319] WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE WILLING
[000:38:43;220] TO PUT GROUND FORCES ON.
[000:38:44;655] WE HAVE 900 SPECIAL FORCE
[000:38:46;724] THERE'S ALREADY IN HARM'S WAY.
[000:38:48;359] THE CONGRESS AT SOME POINT,
[000:38:50;061] SHEP, IS GOING TO HAVE TO
[000:38:51;295] WEIGH-IN ON THIS.
[000:38:52;163] THEY BACKED AWAY WHEN OBAMA
[000:38:54;165] WANTED TO RENEW THE 2001
[000:38:55;766] AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF
[000:38:56;901] MILITARY FORCE A FEW YEARS AGO.
[000:38:59;704] THEY ABDICATED THE
[000:39:02;173] RESPONSIBILITY.
[000:39:02;640] I WAS CRITICAL AT THE TIME THEY
[000:39:03;441] DID THAT.
[000:39:03;841] THE PRESSURE WILL BE ON THEM TO
[000:39:05;543] WEIGH-IN ON THIS.
[000:39:06;577] THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER POLITICAL
[000:39:08;846] DEBATE AND WHOLE OTHER HURDLE.
[000:39:10;548] >> Shepard: INTERESTING YOU SAY
[000:39:12;383] THAT BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:39:13;584] SAID THE SAME THING BACK
[000:39:14;618] REGARDING THIS MATTER EARLIER.
[000:39:16;454] LOOK AT THE TWEET THAT PRESIDENT
[000:39:18;356] TRUMP SENT BACK, BEFORE HE WAS
[000:39:20;324] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:39:20;925] THIS WAS FROM 2013.
[000:39:23;060] "WHAT WILL WE GET FOR BOMBING
[000:39:24;895] SYRIA BESIDES MORE DEBT AND A
[000:39:27;365] POSSIBLE LONG-TERM CONFLICT?
[000:39:29;600] OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL
[000:39:31;435] APPROVAL ON THAT SAME LINE."
[000:39:34;138] TODAY SENATOR RAND PAUL FROM
[000:39:35;706] KENTUCKY SAID IF WE WANT TO
[000:39:37;408] CARRY OUT STRIKES IN SYRIA,
[000:39:39;243] THERE SHOULD BE CONGRESSIONAL
[000:39:41;579] APPROVAL.
[000:39:41;946] THE CHANCES OF CONGRESS WEIGHING
[000:39:43;614] IN ON THIS, A.B.?
[000:39:45;483] >> THEY DON'T WANT TO.
[000:39:46;584] I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
[000:39:49;353] THEY'LL BE FORCED.
[000:39:50;688] AND IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT
[000:39:52;823] THIS WAS A SARIN ATTACK, IT
[000:39:55;726] SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE
[000:39:58;562] PUBLIC BEFORE THERE'S ANY
[000:40:00;364] MILITARY INTERVENTION.
[000:40:01;432] CONGRESS WILL BE ASKING AS THEY
[000:40:04;502] REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN 435
[000:40:06;003] CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AND THE
[000:40:06;971] HOUSE, THEY'LL BE ASKING FOR
[000:40:08;539] HARD EVIDENCE TO LAY OUT THE
[000:40:10;408] CASE IF THEY ARE TO SUPPORT MORE
[000:40:13;344] AGGRESSIVE AIR STRIKES, LET
[000:40:15;813] ALONE GROUND OPERATIONS THE
[000:40:17;148] TOPPLE THE REGIME, THIS SOUNDS
[000:40:18;382] LIKE A LONG BATTLE.
[000:40:20;084] ALTHOUGH THE TRUMP
[000:40:20;618] ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THEY'RE
[000:40:21;986] WORKING ON SOME PLAN TO DO
[000:40:23;788] SOMETHING EXTREMELY BOLD, AS A
[000:40:25;523] FEW DAYS AGO, THEY HAD NO PLAN
[000:40:27;024] IN PLACE AND NO INTENTIONS LIKE
[000:40:29;493] THIS.
[000:40:29;927] SO I THINK THEY'RE FLYING A BIT
[000:40:31;962] BY THE SEAT OF THEIR PANTS.
[000:40:33;764] NOBODY IN CONGRESS KNOW WHAT'S
[000:40:34;965] THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.
[000:40:36;434] AGAIN THAT MEETING IN RUSSIA
[000:40:38;602] SAYS IT WILL BE SO PIVOTAL.
[000:40:40;304] HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES GO IT
[000:40:42;139] ALONE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS
[000:40:44;442] SUPPORTING ASSAD'S REGIME?
[000:40:47;178] DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.
[000:40:47;845] >> Shepard: A.B. STODDARD WITH
[000:40:49;079] THE BREAKING NEWS.
[000:40:50;948] I APPRECIATE IT.
[000:40:52;116] >> THANK YOU.
[000:40:52;783] >> Shepard: I JUST LEARNED THAT
[000:40:53;784] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SPOKEN ABOUT
[000:40:55;119] SYRIA AS HE HEADED ON AIR FORCE
[000:40:58;622] ONE DOWN TO FLOOR.
[000:41:01;725] JOHN ROBERTS IS ALREADY IN PALM
[000:41:02;793] BEACH.
[000:41:03;093] WHAT DID HE SAY, JOHN?
[000:41:04;195] >> GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.
[000:41:05;596] THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK TO THE
[000:41:06;764] PRESS CABIN IN THE REAR RIGHT
[000:41:09;366] SIDE OF AIR FORCE ONE TO TALK
[000:41:10;668] ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
[000:41:12;470] THINGS.
[000:41:12;803] HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE
[000:41:14;305] SUMMIT HE'S HAVING WITH
[000:41:15;606] XI JINPING, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO
[000:41:16;807] BE THE THEME OF THIS NEXT 24
[000:41:18;709] HOURS.
[000:41:19;009] IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT IS GOING ON
[000:41:20;244] WITH SYRIA AND THE POTENTIAL
[000:41:22;446] THERE IS OVERSHADOWING THAT.
[000:41:24;281] A ROUTINE LEADER SUMMIT BETWEEN
[000:41:27;184] THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS
[000:41:29;353] TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE ALL
[000:41:30;554] TOGETHER.
[000:41:30;921] THE PRESIDENT TALKING TO THE
[000:41:31;689] PRESS ABOUT SYRIA.
[000:41:32;723] HE WAS ASKING WHETHER BASHAR
[000:41:33;591] AL-ASSAD SHOULD GO.
[000:41:34;158] THIS IS ON CAMERA.
[000:41:35;693] WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE.
[000:41:37;361] SO I'LL READ THE TRANSCRIPT.
[000:41:39;330] THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT ASSAD
[000:41:40;865] DID IS TERRIBLE.
[000:41:42;132] WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS ONE OF
[000:41:44;602] THE TRULY EGREGIOUS CRIMES.
[000:41:55;079] AND WHEN ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT
[000:41:56;547] WAS GOING TO TAKE TO PRESIDENT
[000:42:01;719] PUTIN, HE SAID I MAY.
[000:42:03;921] THERE WILL BE A RANGE OF OPTIONS
[000:42:06;323] PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT ON
[000:42:07;091] HOW HE COULD RESPOND MILITARY.
[000:42:09;026] THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DISCUSSING
[000:42:10;361] THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S
[000:42:14;064] GOING TO HAPPEN.
[000:42:15;099] IF AN AIR STRIKE OR SOMETHING
[000:42:16;567] LIKE THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT
[000:42:17;768] WOULD BE A TEST OF HOW GOOD A
[000:42:19;803] RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT COULD
[000:42:20;804] HAVE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
[000:42:27;144] RUSSIA.
[000:42:27;945] WHEN ASKED IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD
[000:42:29;346] SHOULD LEAVE POWER, HE SAID IT'S
[000:42:32;116] A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.
[000:42:34;985] HE'S THERE AND HE'S RUNNING
[000:42:37;187] THINGS BUT SOMETHING SHOULD
[000:42:38;756] HAPPEN.
[000:42:39;089] REX TILLERSON IN THE CAMP OF
[000:42:40;824] YES, HE NEEDS TO GO.
[000:42:42;493] THE UNITED STATES TRYING TO GET
[000:42:43;327] A COALITION FOR A POLITICAL
[000:42:45;029] FRAME WORK FOR THAT TO HAPPEN
[000:42:47;965] SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD.
[000:42:50;134] THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA
[000:42:51;669] ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING AT
[000:42:53;971] WHICH CAME TO NOTHING.
[000:42:54;905] >> Shepard: IT DEED.
[000:42:55;706] THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED
[000:42:57;141] TO STOP IT.
[000:42:57;775] THE WORLD WANTS TO STOP IT.
[000:42:59;376] THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY IS
[000:43:02;112] MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE
[000:43:03;447] HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THE
[000:43:04;548] REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING
[000:43:05;883] BECAUSE ALL OF THE OPTIONS ARE
[000:43:07;084] BAD OPTIONS.
[000:43:07;952] THAT WAS THE DECISION OF
[000:43:09;920] PRESIDENT OBAMA.
[000:43:10;421] HE DIDN'T ACT.
[000:43:11;522] NOW THIS PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED
[000:43:13;190] TO ACT.
[000:43:15;492] HE'S TRYING TO FORM A COALITION.
[000:43:18;429] BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
[000:43:20;030] OVERTHROW BASHAR AL-ASSAD?
[000:43:20;965] WHO HOLDS THE LAND THEN?
[000:43:22;166] WHO IS IN CHARGE?
[000:43:23;267] HOW DO YOU COME TO SOME
[000:43:26;937] AGREEMENT WITH THE RUSSIANS WHO
[000:43:28;205] HAVE BEEN PROPPING UP THE SYRIAN
[000:43:30;774] DICTATOR?
[000:43:31;141] WOULD THE RUSSIANS ALLOW A NO
[000:43:32;943] FLY ZONE?
[000:43:33;811] IT'S THE RUSSIAN'S AIRSPACE.
[000:43:35;279] THIS IS AS COMPLICATED AS ANY
[000:43:37;047] FOREIGN MATNER THE WORLD RIGHT
[000:43:38;682] NOW AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE
[000:43:39;984] DYING BEFORE OUR EYES.
[000:43:41;118] WE HAVE THAT AND A LOT MORE ON
[000:43:43;187] FOREIGN POLICY CHALLENGES FACING
[000:43:45;222] THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.
[000:43:46;690] THE MEETING WITH THE CHINESE
[000:43:49;560] LEADER, XI JINPING IS ABOUT TO
[000:43:51;662] HAPPEN RIGHT NOW.
[000:43:52;296] ON ANY NORMAL DAY, THAT WOULD BE
[000:43:53;998] THE HEADLINE.
[000:43:54;865] OH, BY THE WAY, THE LEADER OF
[000:43:57;468] THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
[000:43:58;802] THAT HAS BEEN WORKING TO
[000:44:00;070] INVESTIGATE THE RUSSIAN MATTER
[000:44:01;605] WHO SAID WHY WOULD I STEP DOWN?
[000:44:04;008] HE JUST STEPPED DOWN.
[000:44:05;109] THAT WOULD ALSO BE THE LEAD ON A
[000:44:07;111] GIVEN DAY.
[000:44:07;878] DEVIN NUNES, WHAT IS NEXT FOR
[000:44:09;647] THAT INVESTIGATIVE BODY.

[000:48:21;665] ALEX IS HERE FROM POLITICO.
[000:48:23;433] ALL THE TALK COMES AND NOW THE
[000:48:25;569] FACE-TO-FACE.
[000:48:26;003] YOU WONDER HOW THIS WILL GO.
[000:48:27;771] >> YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE
[000:48:30;007] INTERESTING AND INTERESTING TO
[000:48:30;841] WATCH THE CHEMISTRY OF THESE TWO
[000:48:32;743] LEADERS, HOW THEY GET ALONG, HOW
[000:48:34;912] THEY WORK.
[000:48:36;914] WHAT THEIR BODY LANGUAGE IS LIKE
[000:48:40;717] AFTER YOU REFERENCED THE TOUGH
[000:48:41;952] TALK IN THE CAMPAIGN.
[000:48:44;121] WE'RE LEARNING IN REAL-TIME HOW
[000:48:47;257] DONALD TRUMP RESPONDS TO FOREIGN
[000:48:48;592] POLICY CRISES THAT ARE HAPPENING
[000:48:51;461] ON PARALLEL TRACKS.
[000:48:52;696] ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE SYRIA, ON
[000:48:54;731] THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE NORTH
[000:48:56;266] KOREA THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THESE
[000:48:58;969] TALKS WITH CHINA.
[000:48:59;970] >> Shepard: THE WORLD NEEDS
[000:49:01;204] CHINA ON THAT FRONT.
[000:49:02;172] IT'S CHINA THAT HAS THE SWAY
[000:49:03;507] OVER NORTH KOREA.
[000:49:04;174] IT'S CHINA THAT ALLOWS FOR
[000:49:06;009] REALLY 90% OF EVERYTHING THAT
[000:49:09;012] NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
[000:49:10;380] HOW MUCH LEVERAGE DO WE HAVE ON
[000:49:12;049] CHINA WITH THIS -- ON THIS
[000:49:15;652] MATTER AND WHAT DOESN'T TRUMP
[000:49:17;788] PLAN TO USE AS LEVERAGE?
[000:49:19;323] >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
[000:49:21;058] THERE'S SOME QUESTION MARKS
[000:49:22;292] THERE.
[000:49:22;592] WHAT IS CLEAR THAT THE
[000:49:23;593] ADMINISTRATION IS SERIOUS ABOUT
[000:49:25;495] TRYING TO EXERT SOME PRESSURE ON
[000:49:26;897] CHINA TO TAKE A TOUGHER LINE ON
[000:49:29;666] NORTH KOREA.
[000:49:30;167] YOU SAW THE WHITE HOUSE STARTING
[000:49:31;468] TO DO THAT A LITTLE BIT THIS
[000:49:33;337] WEEK AHEAD OF THE MEETING.
[000:49:35;339] IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT BEHIND
[000:49:37;507] CLOSED DOORS YOU'LL SEE
[000:49:39;209] PRESIDENT TRUMP TRY TO PUSH THE
[000:49:41;845] CHINESE PRESIDENT TO TAKE A
[000:49:44;247] HARDER TACT HERE.
[000:49:45;449] SO DURING THE CAMPAIGN, A LOT OF
[000:49:49;953] TALK SURROUNDED TRADE POLICIES.
[000:49:52;089] THIS MEETING WILL BE LESS ABOUT
[000:49:55;625] TRADE AND MORE ABOUT NORTH
[000:49:57;094] KOREA.
[000:49:57;427] >> Shepard: AS WE TALK ABOUT
[000:49:58;428] NORTH KOREA, THERE'S A FEAR THAT
[000:49:59;796] NORTH KOREA WOULD TAKE ANOTHER
[000:50:01;131] AGGRESSIVE ACTION JUST AS IT DID
[000:50:02;599] A COUPLE DAYS AGO.
[000:50:04;167] I THINK THOSE THAT WATCH NORTH
[000:50:07;037] KOREA CLOSELY ARE CONCERNED THAT
[000:50:08;772] A MISTAKE ON THE PART OF THE
[000:50:10;173] NORTH KOREANS COULD START A
[000:50:12;309] SERIES OF EVENTS THAT COULD LEAD
[000:50:13;677] ANOTHER WAR AND UPSET THE ENTIRE
[000:50:15;479] WORLD.
[000:50:15;779] I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT IS PART
[000:50:18;348] OF THIS DISCUSSION.
[000:50:20;050] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:50:22;219] LOOK, HOVERING OVER THIS ARE
[000:50:24;121] THESE QUESTIONS THAT WE DON'T
[000:50:25;288] HAVE ANSWERS TO, REALLY WHAT IS
[000:50:28;525] DONALD TRUMP'S RED LINE.
[000:50:30;127] WHERE IS THE POINT THAT HE WOULD
[000:50:31;762] BE INTERESTED IN MILITARY ACTION
[000:50:33;897] OF SOME KIND.
[000:50:34;698] WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT
[000:50:35;966] AND WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER ON
[000:50:37;768] THAT YET ON NORTH KOREA EITHER.
[000:50:39;636] BUT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF
[000:50:41;872] THINGS THAT ARE REALLY TURNING
[000:50:44;641] INTO MAJOR HEADLINES AND THE
[000:50:46;576] FOCAL POINT OF THIS WEEKEND AS
[000:50:48;712] HE DEALS WITH THESE TWIN CRISES.
[000:50:50;947] >> Shepard: THE USE OF GOING IT
[000:50:53;150] ALONE AGAINST NORTH KOREA IS NOT
[000:50:56;186] OFF THE TABLE.
[000:50:57;954] ALEX, THANK YOU.
[000:50:58;588] >> THANK YOU.
[000:50:59;489] >> Shepard: AS THE NEWS
[000:51:00;390] CONTINUES TO BREAK ON A VERY
[000:51:01;992] BUSY THURSDAY, THE CHAIRMAN OF
[000:51:04;094] THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
[000:51:04;995] SAYS HE'S REMOVING HIMSELF FROM
[000:51:06;329] THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AFTER
[000:51:07;631] THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE
[000:51:09;533] INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS THAT HE
[000:51:10;734] VIEWED AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:51:12;002] NOW HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION.
[000:51:13;703] THAT'S NEXT.
[000:51:56;379] So much lobster, so little time.
[000:51:58;782] At Red Lobster's Lobsterfest
[000:52:00;884] any of these 9 lobster dishes
[000:52:00;884] could be yours.
[000:52:03;553] So don't resist delicious new
[000:52:03;553] Lobster Mix and Match
[000:52:06;923] or Lobsterfest Surf and Turf
[000:52:08;225] because you won't have this
[000:52:08;225] chance for long.
[000:54:26;947] >> Shepard: AFTER SAYING TO
[000:54:28;381] REPORTERS FOR WEEKS, WHY WOULD I
[000:54:30;917] STEP DOWN?
[000:54:31;885] THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
[000:54:32;852] CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES IS STEPPING
[000:54:34;921] DOWN FROM HIS PANEL'S
[000:54:36;756] INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA'S
[000:54:39;592] MEDDLING IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN
[000:54:44;164] ELECTION.
[000:54:44;531] A TEMPORARY MOVE, HE SAYS.
[000:54:45;999] ALSO NEW, THE HOUSE ETHICS
[000:54:48;368] COMMITTEE IS INVESTIGATING
[000:54:50;203] WHETHER NUNES MISHANDLED
[000:54:52;005] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[000:54:52;839] HIS RESPONSE, SOUTHWEST
[000:54:54;908] LEFT-WING ACTIVISTS GROUPS HAVE
[000:54:57;043] FILED ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME
[000:54:58;345] WITH THE OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL
[000:55:01;748] ETHICS.
[000:55:02;082] THE CHARGES ARE POLITICALLY
[000:55:04;818] MOTIVATED AND LEVELLED JUST AS
[000:55:07;721] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STARTING
[000:55:09;055] TO LEARN ABOUT UNMASKING OF
[000:55:10;757] CITIZENS AND ABUSE OF POWER.
[000:55:13;360] DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE
[000:55:15;862] QUESTIONED WHETHER CONGRESSMAN
[000:55:20;500] NUNES COULD BE AT FAULT.
[000:55:22;068] SOME SAY HE'S A SHIELD FOR THE
[000:55:28;241] WHITE HOUSE.
[000:55:31;378] NUNES SHARED INFORMATION WITH
[000:55:32;746] THE PRESIDENT BEFORE HIS
[000:55:35;882] COMMITTEE.
[000:55:36;316] WAS HE GIVING THE PRESIDENT
[000:55:39;052] COVER?
[000:55:39;919] CONGRESSMAN NUNES, THE WHITE
[000:55:41;121] HOUSE AND THEIR SUPPORTERS HAVE
[000:55:43;390] BEEN TRYING TO CHANGE THE
[000:55:45;692] NARRATIVE.
[000:55:46;593] OPPONENTS SAY THEY'RE TRYING TO
[000:55:48;661] DISTRACT FROM THE INVESTIGATION
[000:55:50;096] INTO WHETHER MEMBERS OF TEAM
[000:55:51;264] TRUMP WORKED WITH THE RUSSIANS
[000:55:52;499] TO TAKE DOWNHILL HILL AND GET
[000:55:55;068] THEM CANDIDATE TRUMP ELECTED.
[000:55:57;637] PETER DOOCY WITH THIS BACK AND
[000:55:59;339] FORTH.
[000:56:00;306] PETER?
[000:56:00;607] >> SHEP, CONGRESSMAN NUNES HAS
[000:56:03;676] SENT A LAWYER TO THE HOUSE
[000:56:05;445] ETHICS COMMITTEE.
[000:56:06;246] HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE
[000:56:07;680] YOU HAVE ON THEM THAT SOMEBODY
[000:56:10;016] UNKNOWN, HE SAYS, A LEFT-LEANING
[000:56:13;686] OUTSIDE GROUP SUBMITTED THAT LED
[000:56:15;288] TO THIS INVESTIGATION.
[000:56:17;223] I SPOKE TO TEXAS CONGRESSMAN
[000:56:18;625] MIKE CONWAY, THE REPUBLICAN FROM
[000:56:19;726] THE COMMITTEE, WHO WILL TAKE
[000:56:21;027] OVER THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.
[000:56:22;929] HE SAID HE GOT A CALL FROM NUNES
[000:56:26;066] LAST NIGHT ASKING HIM TO TAKE
[000:56:27;967] OVER, SO HE'S GOING TO DO IT.
[000:56:29;803] HE STILL HAS NOT SEEN THE
[000:56:31;905] DOCUMENTS THAT NUNES SAW ON THE
[000:56:33;339] WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS THAT ALLEGED
[000:56:35;241] THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
[000:56:36;409] IMPROPERLY UNMASKED THE IDENTITY
[000:56:38;912] OF TRUMP TRANSITION OFFICIALS IN
[000:56:41;481] U.S. INTELLIGENCE REPORTS.
[000:56:43;083] HE COULDN'T CONFIRM OR DENY
[000:56:45;085] WHETHER SUSAN RICE, THE OBAMA
[000:56:46;486] ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL WHO IS
[000:56:47;887] ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED WITH SOME OF
[000:56:49;089] THAT UNMASKING, IS GOING TO COME
[000:56:52;158] AND TESTIFY.
[000:56:52;892] THE REASON HE WOULDN'T CONFIRM
[000:56:54;427] OR DENY AN INVITATION FOR THE
[000:56:56;830] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR IN THE
[000:56:58;331] OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS BECAUSE
[000:56:59;132] HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO
[000:57:01;367] CONDUCT COMMITTEE BUSINESS IN
[000:57:02;802] THE PRESS.
[000:57:03;603] SHEP?
[000:57:04;037] >> Shepard: THANKS, PETER.
[000:57:06;206] BUSY NEWS DAY?
[000:57:07;140] LIKE FEW OTHERS.
[000:57:08;741] THE UNITED STATES PUTTING
[000:57:09;809] TOGETHER A COALITION FOR REGIME
[000:57:11;644] CHANGE IN SYRIA.
[000:57:13;213] NEIL CAVUTO PICKS UP AFTER THIS.
[001:00:17;997] >> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
[001:00:18;965] FORGET GOING NUCLEAR.
[001:00:36;749] Z AND/OR TAX REFORM.
[001:00:47;393] YOU GET AN IDEA THAT NOT
[001:00:48;628] EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE?
[001:00:50;463] MAYBE EVEN WITHIN THE WHITE
[001:00:55;768] HOUSE ITSELF?
[001:00:56;836] I'M CONFUSED.
[001:00:57;737] THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S
