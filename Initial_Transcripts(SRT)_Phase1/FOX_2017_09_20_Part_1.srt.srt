1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:03,535
YOU WHEN IT HAPPENS.            
IT'S BEEN A BUSY HOUR.          

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,404
I'M HARRIS FAULKNER.            
MORE NEWS NOW.

00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:09,475
HERE'S SHEP.                    
>> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE    

4
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,612
WEST COAST, 3:00 IN PUERTO RICO 
WHERE HURRICANE MARIA HAS BEEN  

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,647
PUNISHING THAT ISLAND WITH      
POWERFUL WINDS.                 

6
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:19,351
>> WE'VE BEEN SEEING STRONG     
WINDS WELL OVER 100 MILES FOR   

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:23,922
TWO HOURS HERE, STRONG ENOUGH TO
CAUSE VISIBLE DESTRUCTION.      

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:29,795
WE'VE SEEN TREES SNAPPED, PARTS 
OF WELL-MADE STRUCTURES         

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:34,867
COLLAPSE.                       
>> Shepard: AS STEVE CAN ATTEST,

10
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,570
IT'S A CATASTROPHIC STORM.      
ONE OF THE STRONGEST TO EVER HIT

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,640
AMERICAN SOIL AND THE           
DESTRUCTION COULD BE WIDESPREAD.

12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,412
WE'RE TRACKING THE HURRICANE.   
PLUS, IN MEXICO CITY, CRIES OF  

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,114
ANGUISH AT THE SITE OF A SCHOOL 
COLLAPSED IN THE EARTHQUAKE.    

14
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,217
PARENTS STILL WAITING TO FIND   
OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR KIDS.

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:56,321
RESCUERS WORKING THROUGH THE    
NIGHT, SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS. 

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,158
WE'LL GO THERE LIVE.            
PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO MEET WITH

17
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,827
THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER.     
THE LEADER OF OUR STRONGEST     

18
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,497
ALLY.                           
WE'RE EXPECTING THAT IN THIS    

19
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:14,973
HOUR.                           
LET'S GET TO IT.                

20
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,110
WE'RE TRACKING TWO DEADLY       
NATURAL DISASTERS.              

21
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,946
THE DANGEROUS HURRICANE MAKING  
ITS WAY ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN AND

22
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:27,352
THE EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO.       
WE'LL GO LIVE TO MEXICO CITY IN 

23
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,655
JUST A MOMENT.                  
BUT HURRICANE MARIA HAS KILLED  

24
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,825
ANYBODY PEOPLE ACROSS THE       
CARIBBEAN.                      

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,329
TODAY IT MADE LANDFALL AS ONE OF
THE STRONGEST TO HIT PUERTO RICO

26
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,933
AND ST. CROIX.                  
PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR SAYS     

27
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:44,369
PUERTO RICANS HAVE NOT          
EXPERIENCED AN EVENT OF THIS    

28
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,840
MAGNITUDE IN THEIR MODERN       
HISTORY.                        

29
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:51,310
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE STORM FROM 
SPACE AS THE CORE MOVES OVER    

30
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,046
PUERTO RICO.                    
THE HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL AS A

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,448
CATEGORY FOUR.                  
THE STORM ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST

32
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:04,823
OF THE ISLAND WITH SUSTAINED    
WINDS OF 155 MILES AN HOUR.     

33
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,193
THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER   
WARNING OF LIFE THREATENING     

34
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,464
WINDS AND STORM SURGE AND RAIN  
OVER PUERTO RICO IN ST. CROIX   

35
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,833
TODAY.                          
WATER LEVELS COULD RISE UP TO   

36
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,905
NINE FEET ON PUERTO RICO WITH   
LARGE AND DESTRUCTIVE WAVES.    

37
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:28,547
THE DANGEROUS WINDS ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE FOR 24 HOURS.       

38
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,216
PUERTO RICAN OFFICIALS SAY      
DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE 

39
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:38,590
TO BE REBUILD.                  
THEY SAY THE STORM COULD        

40
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,027
"DECIMATE" THE ISLAND'S POWER   
COMPANY.                        

41
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,798
IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ON PUERTO   
RICO'S NORTHERN COAST, THE MAYOR

42
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,701
SAID FOUR OUT OF FIVE HOMES ARE 
DESTROYED.                      

43
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:55,474
THE STORM HAS SNAPPED PALM      
TREES, PEELED OFF ROOFTOPS.     

44
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,111
PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL OF        
SAN JUAN ARE REPORTING          

45
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:03,515
WIDESPREAD FLOODING.            
SOME IN HIGH RISE APARTMENTS.   

46
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,553
ONE WOMAN THAT LIVES IN SAN JUAN
TOLD THE "MIAMI HERALD" THAT HER

47
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,557
HOUSE WAS TREMBLING.            
THE RAIN HORIZONTAL AND ALL THE 

48
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,892
TREES ON THE GROUND.            
SHE SAID THE WINDS ARE LIKE     

49
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:18,297
SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE.
WE'RE ALSO GETTING A LOOK AT THE

50
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:29,041
DEVASTATION ON THE SMALL ISLAND 
OF DOMINIC DiNATALE --          

51
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:34,913
DOMINIQUE.                      
THE STORM HIT AND BLEW AWAY THE 

52
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,217
MAYOR'S ROOF.                   
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE DAMAGE IN  

53
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,087
ST. CROIX, ONE OF THE U.S.      
VIRGIN ISLANDS.                 

54
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,058
THE HURRICANE SIDE SWIPED THE   
ISLAND.                         

55
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:50,896
KNOCKING OVER TREES, TOPPLING   
POWER LINES AND CAUSING SEVERE  

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,431
FLOODING.                       
OFFICIALS IN ST. CROIX WARNED   

57
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,034
PEOPLE TO STAY AWAKE MOST OF THE
NIGHT AND KEEP THEIR SHOES ON IN

58
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,638
CASE THEY NEEDED TO RUN.        
FORECASTERS SAY HURRICANE FORCE 

59
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,708
WINDS EXTEND 60 MILES FROM THE  
EYE OF MARIA.                   

60
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,578
THEY SAY THE CENTER OF THE STORM
IS EXPECTED TO CROSS OVER THE   

61
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,016
COAST OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
TONIGHT BEFORE MOVING TO THE    

62
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,150
TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE        
BAHAMAS.                        

63
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,954
I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO STEVE 
HARRIGAN WHO IS LIVE IN SAN JUAN

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,258
FOR US THIS AFTERNOON.          
STEVE, LOOKS LIKE THINGS HAVE   

65
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,928
CALMED DOWN.                    
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE NOW?     

66
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,131
>> SHEPARD, THE WIND HAS CALMED 
CONSIDERABLY, UNDER 50 MILES PER

67
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,402
HOUR THAT MEANS THE POLICE AND  
FIRST RESPONDERS CAN GO OUT.    

68
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,939
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK HERE, IT'S A
WET MISS AND IT'S NOT GETTING   

69
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,475
BETTER SOON.                    
WHERE I'M STANDING NOW, CHUNKS  

70
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:41,113
OF BUILDINGS, SATELLITE DISHES, 
BALCONIES, PIECES OF WALL, HOLES

71
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:43,515
IN BUILDINGS.                   
THAT WAS 145 MILES PER HOUR     

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,819
WINDS EARLIER THIS MORNING.     
WE JUST MOVED AROUND TO A       

73
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,656
NEIGHBORHOOD.                   
IF YOUR HOUSE IS MADE OF WOOD   

74
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,994
WITH A METAL ROOF, JUST GONE.   
SOME HOUSES WE SAW ON THE STREET

75
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,030
GONE.                           
TO MOVE AROUND HERE, IT'S       

76
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,699
STREAMLY DIFFICULT.             
IF YOU'RE AN AVERAGE CITIZEN IN 

77
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,201
PUERTO RICO RIGHT NOW, YOU MIGHT
NOT HAVE A ROOF.                

78
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,805
YOU PROBABLY HAVE STRUCTURAL    
DAMAGE WHEREVER YOU LIVE AND YOU

79
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,107
DEFINITELY DO NOT HAVE          
ELECTRICITY.                    

80
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,710
A SITUATION THAT COULD LAST FOR 
WEEKS OR MONTHS, SHEPARD.       

81
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:15,647
>> GOING FORWARD, FLOODS AND    
MUDSLIDES.                      

82
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:20,118
>> IT'S NOT OVER YET.           
THE WINDS WERE DRAMATIC AND     

83
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,688
POSSIBLY DEADLY.                
WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS YET.  

84
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,391
WE SAW POWER CREWS OUT ON FOOT  
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE. 

85
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,961
THERE'S SO MANY DOWNED POWER    
LINES AND DOWNED BRANCHES.      

86
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,164
THEY WERE WALKING TO TRY TO     
ASSESS THE DAMAGE.              

87
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:36,134
AS FAR AS THE MUDSLIDES GO,     
ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL       

88
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:40,505
MOUNTAINOUS PART OF THE COUNTRY 
THAT IS LIKELY WHEN YOU GET     

89
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,010
10-15 INCHES OF RAIN.           
FEMA HAS PREPOSITIONED HERE.    

90
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:50,982
WE'LL SEARCH AND RESCUE AND A   
LOT OF RECOVERY.                

91
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,020
>> Shepard: THANKS, STEVE.      
LET'S GET TO RICK REICHMUTH IN  

92
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,788
THE EXTREME WEATHER CENTER, THIS
IS AWFUL.                       

93
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:01,360
>> A HORRIBLE FORM.             
MAKING LANDFALL 6:15 A.M.       

94
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,530
MAYBE A LITTLE BRIGHT NEWS,     
ANOTHER GOING OVER LAND DURING  

95
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:10,902
THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.             
ALMOST EVERY RECORD IN PUERTO   

96
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,773
RICO AT RECORD FLOOD STAGE.     
ALL OF THEM GOING UP INCREDIBLY 

97
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,876
FAST.                           
UNFORTUNATELY, CUTTING A CROSS  

98
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,747
DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ISLAND.   
EVERYBODY FEELING THE IMPACTS OF

99
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,716
THIS STORM, THIS IS THE FUTURE  
RADAR.                          

100
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,786
THE RUSSIA ARE THE HURRICANE    
FORCE WINDS STAYING TO THE NORTH

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,123
OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE IDEA OF
THE D.R.                        

102
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,393
HOPEFULLY TO THE EAST OF TURKS  
AND CAICOS THAT GOT DEVASTATED  

103
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,363
BY IRMA A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.     
THEN IT CONTINUES TO PULL TO THE

104
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:43,468
NORTH.                          
MOST OF THE MODELS MAKE THIS    

105
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,639
NORTH WARD TURN HERE.           
THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE       

106
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,108
SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE U.S.   
WHICH WE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE A   

107
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,478
DISTRICT IMPACT, THIS IS        
FOLLOWING A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY  

108
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,714
AS TO WHAT THE HURRICANE JOSE   
HAS DONE.                       

109
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,550
PULLING TO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND 
AROUND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST.  

110
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,888
WE'LL BE ADDING IMPACTS ACROSS  
PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY

111
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,657
AND THURSDAY AS THE STORM PULLS 
OFF TO THE NORTH.               

112
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,493
THAT SAID, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT
THE IMPACTS ARE.                

113
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,562
DO WE HAVE A DISTRICT HIT       
SOMEWHERE?                      

114
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,599
MAYBE ON THE OUTER BANKS?       
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.             

115
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,736
SOMEWHERE FARTHER IN FROM NEW   
YORK CITY UP AROUND PARTS OF THE

116
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,841
NORTHEAST, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT
WE DO KNOW, ENVIRONMENTAL       

117
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:27,212
CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE   
FOR A STRONG HURRICANE.         

118
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:32,284
THE WATER TEMPERATURES COME DOWN
AS WELL.                        

119
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,653
ALL GUIDANCES HAVE A WEAKER     
STORM.                          

120
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,057
BUT TUESDAY, A STORM OFF THE    
SHORE OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, SHEP.

121
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,893
>> Shepard: WHAT A SEASON, RICK.
CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH  

122
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:46,398
THIS THING?                     
NO LIGHTS, NO WAY TO GET HELP,  

123
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,668
NO IDEA WHETHER YOUR HOME WILL  
STAND UP OR FALL DOWN AROUND    

124
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,003
YOU.                            
WE'LL SPEAK WITH A WOMAN RIDING 

125
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,806
OUT THE STORM, HIDING IN HER    
CLOSET.                         

126
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,808
THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX   
NEWS DECK ON THIS WEDNESDAY     

127
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,108
AFTERNOON.                      

128
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,517
 Ugh. Heartburn.                

129
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,452
         Sorry Ma'am.           
        No burning here.        

130
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,453
               Try Alka-Seltzer 

131
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,921
             Heartburn relief   
                 gummies.       

132
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,723
   They don't taste             
 chalky and work fast.          

133
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,191
      MMMM. Incredible.         

134
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,192
                   Can I try?   

135
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,293
          She doesn't           
        have heartburn.

     <i> Enjoy the relief.</i>

     when we're on our way.     

140

      You can see exactly       
       when we'll arrive.       

141
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,604
   I'm Micah with Safelite.     

142
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,005
  CUSTOMER: Thanks for coming,

143
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,608
  TECH: Giving you a few more   
 minutes for what matters most. 

144
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,709
           Take care.

146
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,943
>> Shepard: MORE ON HURRICANE   
MARIA AS IT BATTERS PUERTO RICO.

147
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,346
OFFICIALS SAY THE EXTREMELY     
DANGEROUS STORM KNOCKED OUT     

148
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,950
POWER TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND.     
BLEW OUT WINDOWS IN SAN JUAN.   

149
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,954
LET'S TURN TO JENNIFER GONZALEZ 
COLON NOW.                      

150
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,891
SHE'S PUERTO RICO'S RESIDENT    
COMMISSIONER.                   

151
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,661
THE ISLAND'S REPRESENTATIVE IN  
CONGRESS AND RIDING OUT THE     

152
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,665
STORM IN A CLOSET EAST OF       
SAN JUAN.                       

153
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,635
HOW ARE YOU?                    
>> RIGHT NOW, I'M FINE.         

154
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,837
WAITING UNTIL THE WINDS GETS    
OVER THE ISLAND.                

155
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:16,875
WE ARE STILL HAVING WINDS MORE  
THAN 60 MILES PER HOUR.         

156
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,646
SO OFFICIALS ARE ASKING PEOPLE  
TO REMAIN AT THEIR HOMES BECAUSE

157
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,116
IT'S NOT SAFE YET TO GET OUT OF 
THE HOUSES.                     

158
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:29,688
THERE'S A LOT OF FLOODING IN    
MANY AREAS.                     

159
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:35,160
WE RECEIVED BETWEEN 12 TO 35    
INCHES OF RAIN DURING THIS DAY. 

160
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,597
THE WINDS BEGAN AT 1:00 A.M. IN 
THE MORNING.                    

161
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,902
WE'RE STILL HAVING THE SEVERE   
CONDITIONS AND SEVERE WINDS     

162
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:48,373
ACROSS THE ISLAND.              
ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IS THAT  

163
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:52,944
THE RIVERS OVERFLOWED THEIR     
BANKS.                          

164
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,382
SO IT'S REALLY SCARY.           
WE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF       

165
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:02,320
HURRICANE BEFORE.               
OF COURSE, THE WHOLE ISLAND IS  

166
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,923
WITHOUT POWER.                  
>> Shepard: HOW ARE YOU TALKING 

167
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:11,362
TO US?                          
>> I HAVE EXTRA BATTERIES FOR MY

168
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:17,402
CELL PHONE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO HAVE COMMUNICATION.      

169
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,805
ACTUALLY, A LOT OF COMMUNICATION
TOWERS WENT DOWN AND ARE OFF    

170
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,541
LINE.                           
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE      

171
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,745
ISLAND DO NOT HAVE COMMUNICATION
AT THIS TIME.                   

172
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,217
SO THAT'S MAYBE THE REASON SOME 
PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE STATES   

173
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,954
ARE CALLING THEIR FAMILIES AND  
PEOPLE AND FRIENDS IN PUERTO    

174
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,725
RICO AND THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING, 
BECAUSE OF THAT.                

175
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:49,367
>> Shepard: REPRESENTATIVE      
GONZALEZ COLON, THERE'S SO MANY 

176
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,936
PUERTO RICANS, THERE'S SO MANY  
CONCERNED ABOUT THE AREA OUTSIDE

177
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,173
OF THE CAPITOL.                 
WHAT DO YOU KNOW FROM THE       

178
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,408
NEIGHBORHOODS?                  
WERE PEOPLE EVACUATED           

179
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,146
EFFICIENTLY?                    
>> YES, STILL, A LOT OF PEOPLE  

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,584
ARE STILL HERE BECAUSE OF THE   
FLOODING AND THE RIVERS OUT OF  

181
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,455
THEIR BANKS.                    
THIS IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE

182
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,994
RIGHT NOW.                      
IT'S NOT SAFE TO GET OUT OF THE 

183
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,131
HOUSES.                         
IN SAN JUAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE    

184
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:25,937
LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE AREAS   
HIT HARD.                       

185
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,774
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES
BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WINDS.     

186
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,711
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH WOODEN   
HOUSES.                         

187
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,883
THOSE WOODEN HOUSES ARE ALMOST  
GONE IN MANY AREAS OF THE       

188
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,886
ISLAND.                         
I'M SPEAKING WITH YOU.          

189
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:46,057
I'M STILL HAVING HEAVY WINDS IN 
MY OWN HOUSE.                   

190
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:51,262
THE HOUSE JUST TREMBLED DURING  
THIS SITUATION.                 

191
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:55,867
>> Shepard: CONGRESS WOMAN, FOR 
OUR VIEWERS WATCHING ACROSS THE 

192
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,537
48 AND AROUND THE WORLD THIS    
AFTERNOON, WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO

193
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,873
HELP YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF      
PUERTO RICO?                    

194
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,211
WHAT IS THE MOST URGENT NEED?   
HOW CAN WE HELP?                

195
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:11,182
>> THE MOST URGENT NEED IS      
RESTORING THE POWER ON THE      

196
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,987
ISLAND.                         
FOR THAT MATTER, I ASK DIRECTLY 

197
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,089
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE LAST  
NIGHT.                          

198
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:22,126
HE CALLED ME.                   
I ASKED HIM DIRECTLY AND SOME   

199
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,631
OTHER CABINET MEMBERS TO SEND   
ELECTRIC TEAMS TO THE ISLAND TO 

200
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:32,270
HELP US RESTORE THE POWER GRID. 
THE SECOND ONE, THE GOVERNOR OF 

201
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:41,579
PUERTO RICO, HELP FOR THOSE     
PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR          

202
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:47,485
BELONGINGS.                     
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME  

203
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,857
TO RECOVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
THE ISLAND.                     

204
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,995
ROADS, BRIDGES AND MANY         
HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN HIT DIRECTLY

205
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,264
BY THIS HURRICANE.              
YOU'LL HAVE THAT.               

206
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:04,669
ALSO IN THE HOTELS AND METRO    
AREA.                           

207
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:11,209
SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE FULL 
EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE OF THIS    

208
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,746
MONSTER HURRICANE LEFT US HERE. 
>> Shepard: IW K TNOHERETAT GES

THE VERY OLD.                   

210
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,653
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO REMEMBER    
THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS

211
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:27,992
JUST LIKE ALL OF US.            
THEY DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND 

212
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,528
SALUTE THE SAME FLAG.           
I KNOW THIS NATION AND THE      

213
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,298
GENEROUS PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL 
RESPOND AS THEY ALWAYS DO.      

214
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,468
ALL THE BEST, CONGRESSWOMAN.    
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU.       

215
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:42,707
>> THANK YOU.                   
AS YOU SAID, THERE'S FOUR       

216
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:47,612
MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS HERE. 
FIVE MILLION PUERTO RICANS IN   

217
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,282
THE MAINLAND.                   
IT'S THE THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN

218
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,753
A MONTH THAT A HURRICANE        
LANDFALL ON THE U.S. SOIL.      

219
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:01,059
IN OUR CASE, TWICE.             
IRMA AND WITH MARIA.            

220
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:06,631
WE'VE BEEN MANAGING PEOPLE FROM 
ST. THOMAS, THE U.S. VIRGIN     

221
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,034
ISLANDS, THE BRITISH VIRGIN     
ISLANDS, GIVING SHELTER TO THEM.

222
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,238
NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF
HELP.                           

223
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:19,043
I WANT TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT  
MIKE PENCE AND FEMA DIRECTOR FOR

224
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,715
THEIR CALLS AND THEIR DILIGENCE.
THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE ISLAND,

WORKING WITH THE TEAMS.

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,925
WE MAY NEED A LOT OF HELP TO    
HELP THE ISLAND RECOVER.        

227
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,529

PUERTO RICO IS A PUERTO RICO -- 

288

DECLARED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

FOLLOWING HURRICANE IRMA WHICH  

302
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,970
DIDN'T HAVE A DIRECT HIT.       
THE NUMBER 1 CLIENT IS THE WATER

303
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,873
COMPANY.
