[000:00:29;996] LEGAL CATS, BUT THIS THE THIRD
[000:00:31;431] TIME MAY JUST BE THE CHARM FOR
[000:00:34;834] THE PRESIDENT.
[000:00:35;502] REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE TAKEN
[000:00:36;669] ANOTHER TRY AT CHANGING
[000:00:38;671] OBAMACARE.

[000:03:24;938] ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

[000:03:28;875] VOTE, WE SURE HOPE SO.
[000:03:30;643] WE'VE BEEN CALLING ON CONGRESS
[000:03:31;344] TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO

[000:03:34;881] CAMPAIGNED ON, AND THAT IS TO
[000:03:37;317] REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.
[000:03:38;017] WE ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH
[000:03:39;552] FORWARD.
[000:03:39;886] WE KNOW WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THE
[000:03:41;454] OBAMACARE STATUS QUO.
[000:03:43;856] >> THE PRESIDENT ALSO TAKING
[000:03:45;692] JOHN McCAIN OUT TO THE

[000:03:50;096] THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL.
[000:03:52;065] LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ON THE
[000:03:54;801] "RICK AND BUBBA SHOW."
[000:03:58;271] >> YOU LOOK AT WHAT
[000:03:59;105] JOHN McCAIN HAS DONE, A
[000:04:03;009] TREMENDOUS SLAP IN THE FACE OF
[000:04:03;710] THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
[000:04:05;678] TREMENDOUS.
[000:04:06;079] HE WAS GOOD TO GO ALL WEEK LONG,
[000:04:07;947] ALL MONTH LONG, HE WAS GOOD TO
[000:04:09;382] GO, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THUMBS
[000:04:12;051] DOWN.
[000:04:12;552] YOU CAN CALL WHAT YOU WANT THAT
[000:04:15;555] WAS A -- THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
[000:04:17;056] WE DO NOT HAVE IT, BECAUSE OF
[000:04:19;692] JOHN McCAIN.
[000:04:21;261] >> THE PRESENT CONTINUING TO PUT
[000:04:22;762] THAT
[000:04:23;229] HOME SAYING, JOHN McCAIN HAD
[000:04:26;232] NEVER INTENTION TO VOTE FOR THE
[000:04:27;834] BILL, WHICH IS GOVERNOR LOVES.
[000:04:31;671] LET ARIZONA DOWN AND THEN'S WENT
[000:04:33;172] ON TO SAY, DEMOCRATS ARE
[000:04:35;475] LAUGHINGLY SAME, A MOMENT OF
[000:04:36;676] COURAGE.
[000:04:37;010] TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF
[000:04:39;479] ARIZONA WHO RECEIVED 100%
[000:04:41;714] INCREASE.
[000:04:42;215] THE PRESENT IS TALK ABOUT THE
[000:04:44;617] HEALTH CARE COSTS.
[000:04:47;053] >> Shepard: THIS HEALTH CARE
[000:04:47;754] AND VOTE.
[000:04:49;455] THE NUCLEAR CRISIS WITH
[000:04:50;256] NORTH KOREA LIKE NOTHING WE HAVE
[000:04:51;457] SEEN SINCE THE COLD WAR.
[000:04:53;726] THERE'S CLEANUP AND RECOVERY IN
[000:04:55;662] PUERTO RICO, AND IN TEXAS, AND
[000:04:56;896] OF FLORIDA, AND A LONG, LONG
[000:04:58;031] LIST COMING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:04:59;565] KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT FOOTBALL.
[000:05:02;268] >> YES, AND THIS STARTED ON
[000:05:04;837] FRIDAY NIGHT, SHEP, WHEN HE WAS
[000:05:06;472] DOWN IN ALABAMA AT A RALLY FOR
[000:05:09;475] SENATOR LUTHER STRANGE, WHO IS
[000:05:10;209] IN THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.
[000:05:12;845] AND TOMORROW NIGHT'S PRIMARY.
[000:05:15;048] THE PRESIDENT ZEROING IN ON
[000:05:16;249] RESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN FLAG
[000:05:17;050] AND GOING ON TO SAY, HE WISHES
[000:05:19;185] THE SUM OF THESE NFL OWNERS, ANY
[000:05:21;554] TIME THE PLAYER TAKES A KNEE
[000:05:23;222] DURING A NATIONAL ANTHEM, WOULD
[000:05:24;590] TELL THOSE SOBS THAT THEY ARE
[000:05:28;261] FIRED.
[000:05:28;594] I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS
[000:05:30;596] ABOUT THE COMMENTS, WHETHER THEY
[000:05:32;265] WERE TOO STRIDENT AT THE
[000:05:33;333] BRIEFING A SHORT TIME AGO, GIVEN
[000:05:34;867] THE REACTION THAT THEY PROVOKED
[000:05:36;002] OVER THE WEEKEND.
[000:05:36;869] LET'S LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.
[000:05:38;838] >> DID THE PRESIDENT GO TOO FAR?
[000:05:40;506] >> I THINK IT IS ALWAYS
[000:05:43;609] APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF
[000:05:44;377] THE UNITES STATES TO DEFEND OUR
[000:05:46;079] FLAG, DEFEND THE
[000:05:47;046] NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND TO DEFEND
[000:05:48;047] THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND
[000:05:49;682] DIED TO DEFEND A.
[000:05:51;050] >> AS HE SAID OVER THE WEEKEND,
[000:05:55;188] SOME 200 PLAYERS OUT OF 1600
[000:05:56;322] EITHER TOOK A KNEE AT THE
[000:05:59;792] VARIOUS GAME OR IN THE CASE OF
[000:06:01;594] THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS,
[000:06:03;029] SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, AND ONE OTHER
[000:06:04;230] TEAM, AND ACTUALLY STAYED INSIDE
[000:06:05;231] THE LOCKER ROOM RATHER THAN
[000:06:05;898] COMING OUT.
[000:06:07;166] FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:06:09;435] ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION, ALEJANDRO
[000:06:12;538] VILLANUEVA FOR THE PITTSBURGH
[000:06:14;240] STEELERS, WHO DID THREE TOURS OF
[000:06:15;842] DUTY AS AN ARMY RANGER IN
[000:06:16;876] AFGHANISTAN HE WAS THE LONE
[000:06:19;112] PLAYER DURING THAT GAME TO COME
[000:06:20;246] OUT OF THE TUNNEL PUT HIS HAND
[000:06:21;347] OVER HIS HEART AND STAND FOR THE
[000:06:24;584] NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:06:27;987] ROGER THE NFL COMMISSIONER SAID,
[000:06:31;257] THE FRUSTRATION OVER THE VICE OF
[000:06:34;460] RHETORIC THAT WE HEARD FROM
[000:06:35;728] TRUMP.
[000:06:39;232] TOM BRADY, THAT PATRIOT ON THE
[000:06:41;100] RADIO CALLED THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:06:43;269] COMMENTS DIVISIVE AND SAID, HE
[000:06:44;837] DID NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THE
[000:06:45;505] PRESIDENT SAID.
[000:06:48;274] AND NOW NASCAR IS WEIGHING IN ON
[000:06:49;842] ALL OF IT.
[000:06:50;376] OFFICIAL STATEMENTS INCOME IN
[000:06:51;878] SPORTS ARE UNIFYING INFLUENCE IN
[000:06:53;446] OUR SOCIETY, PUTTING PEOPLE OF
[000:06:54;814] DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND
[000:06:55;848] BELIEFS TOGETHER.
[000:06:56;616] I RESPECT FOR THE
[000:06:57;483] NATIONAL ANTHEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN
[000:06:59;018] A HALLMARK OF OUR PRERACE
[000:07:01;754] EVENTS.
[000:07:02;088] THANKS TO THE SACRIFICES OF
[000:07:03;055] MANY, WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY OF
[000:07:05;858] UNPARALLELED FREEDOMS AND CALLUS
[000:07:06;626] LIBERTIES, INCLUDING THE RIGHT
[000:07:07;994] TO PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ONE'S
[000:07:09;629] OPINION.
[000:07:10;062] DESPITE THE FACT THAT TEAM OWNER
[000:07:11;831] SAID HE WANTED HIS TEAM MEMBERS
[000:07:13;933] TO STAND UP FOR THE
[000:07:16;235] NATIONAL ANTHEM, DALE
[000:07:17;036] EARNHARDT JR. TWEETED, ALL
[000:07:18;204] AMERICANS ARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO
[000:07:19;839] PEACEFUL PROTESTS.
[000:07:20;606] THOSE WHO MAKE PEACEFUL
[000:07:22;608] REVOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE WILL MAKE
[000:07:24;811] VIOLENT REVOLUTION INEVITABLE.
[000:07:28;047] QUOTING JFK.
[000:07:28;815] >> Shepard: JOHN, THANK YOU.
[000:07:30;016] THE TOP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED
[000:07:30;917] A NEW BAN, BUT IT'S CLIMATE
[000:07:35;254] NOTHING MORE THAN WINDOW
[000:07:35;855] DRESSING ON MUSLIMS.
[000:07:40;026] HIS TEMPER A BAND ON TRAVELERS
[000:07:43;229] ELECTED TO EXPIRE.
[000:07:46;432] FROM SIX MAJORITY MUSLIM NATIONS
[000:07:47;633] FROM ENTERING UNLESS THEY HAD A
[000:07:49;268] SOUL CARD SO-CALLED BONA FIDE
[000:07:50;069] RELATIONSHIP HERE IN THE U.S.
[000:07:52;472] NOW, SUDAN IS FINE, AND OFF THE
[000:07:54;574] LIST.
[000:07:54;874] IT'S NEIGHBOR CHAD IS NOW ON THE
[000:07:58;811] LIST, AND VENEZUELA.
[000:07:59;412] ALTHOUGH THE RESTRICTIONS APPLY
[000:08:00;813] ONLY TO A GROUP OF GOVERNMENT
[000:08:02;615] OFFICIALS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
[000:08:04;050] THE CHANGES TAKE EFFECT ON
[000:08:04;750] OCTOBER THE 18TH.
[000:08:07;453] THE HOME UNSECURED OFFICIALS SAY
[000:08:09;088] THE EIGHT NATIONS EITHER FAILED
[000:08:10;423] TO SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH
[000:08:11;524] THE UNITED STATES OR DID NOT
[000:08:13;826] TAKE ENOUGH SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
[000:08:14;560] IN MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.
[000:08:16;496] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS IS ALL
[000:08:17;964] ABOUT SECURITY.
[000:08:19;265] THE PRESIDENT TWEETING, MAKING
[000:08:19;999] AMERICA SAFE IS MY NUMBER ONE
[000:08:21;634] PRIORITY.
[000:08:22;001] WE WILL NOT ADMIT THOSE INTO OUR
[000:08:25;438] COUNTRY THAT YOU CANNOT SAFELY
[000:08:27;640] BET.
[000:08:28;641] NEW TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT
[000:08:29;675] CANCELED ARGUMENTS FOR NEXT
[000:08:31;277] MONTH WITH HIS OLD TROUBLE BAND
[000:08:33;646] AFTER HE ANNOUNCED NEW
[000:08:34;413] RESTRICTIONS, CIVIL RIGHTS
[000:08:35;047] GROUPS SAY THE NEW BAN ISN'T
[000:08:39;719] COVERED, NORTH KOREA AND
[000:08:40;319] VENEZUELA ON THE LIST, THE STILL
[000:08:42;221] AMOUNT TO A MUSLIM BAN.
[000:08:46;826] SIX OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:08:47;426] TARGETED COUNTRIES ARE MUSLIM,
[000:08:48;394] THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS ADDED
[000:08:52;431] NORTH KOREA, WITH FEW VISITORS,
[000:08:54;400] AND
[000:08:54;934] AND A FEW GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
[000:08:55;868] FROM VENEZUELA, IS DOES NOT
[000:08:58;204] CONCEAL THE REAL FACT THAT IT IS
[000:09:00;907] STILL A MUSLIM BAN.
[000:09:04;243] PRESIDENT TRUMP ORIGINAL STANCE
[000:09:06;712] CANNOT BE CURED BY THROWING
[000:09:08;581] OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE ENEMY
[000:09:10;583] LIST.
[000:09:10;883] BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS AT THE
[000:09:13;019] WHITE HOUSE.
[000:09:13;419] JOHN?
[000:09:13;719] >> THE PRESIDENT, SHEP, BELIEVE
[000:09:17;056] THAT BY MODIFYING THE TRAVEL
[000:09:18;457] BAN, IT WILL PASS MUSTER IN THE
[000:09:19;759] COURTS.
[000:09:20;092] YOU BET THEIR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
[000:09:21;727] THE ACL YOU, WILL GO TO TRY TO
[000:09:26;899] GET STOPPED AS WELL.
[000:09:27;466] THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT BY
[000:09:30;436] WRITING THESE OUT TO INCLUDE
[000:09:32;438] CHAD AND NORTH KOREA INSERTED
[000:09:33;372] OFFICIALS FROM VENEZUELA, A GETS
[000:09:34;674] THEM OUT OF THAT IDEA THAT SO
[000:09:35;408] MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT.
[000:09:37;810] YOU READ THAT STATEMENT FROM THE
[000:09:40;212] ACLU, THIS IS SIMPLY MUSLIM BAN,
[000:09:41;781] IT'S HOPEFULLY ONE THAT CAN
[000:09:43;416] MUSTER IN THE COURTS, BECAUSE
[000:09:46;252] THE RESTRICTIONS ARE TAILORED TO
[000:09:49;422] INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.
[000:09:51;424] CERTAINLY, THE WATERFALL OF
[000:09:53;059] CRITICISM CONTINUES TO BE AIMED
[000:09:55;127] AT THE PRESIDENT WHETHER IT IS
[000:09:57;096] ON CAPITOL HILL WITH THE
[000:09:58;164] INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FROM
[000:09:58;831] CIVIL LIBERTARIAN GROUPS, YOU
[000:10:00;266] WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS IN
[000:10:01;367] THE COMING DAYS, SHEP, DESPITE
[000:10:04;136] THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME COURT
[000:10:05;237] PUT ON HOLD THE HEARINGS THAT
[000:10:06;639] WERE SCHEDULED FOR THE TENTH
[000:10:08;074] SAYING, WITH THE NEW TROUBLE
[000:10:08;975] BAND IN PLACE, THOSE HEARINGS
[000:10:11;377] ARE MOOT.
[000:10:11;744] >> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS AT
[000:10:12;445] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:10:13;846] LET'S GO TO JAIL, REPORTER WITH
[000:10:15;214] THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
[000:10:18;117] HEALTH CARE.

[000:11:16;842] REGARDING NUCLEAR WAR, IT SOUNDS

[000:11:59;018] COMING FROM PERSONALITIES, WHO
[000:12:01;220] REALLY SEEM TO BE ESCALATING THE

[000:12:14;533] WANT IS TO GET TO THE TABLE AND
[000:12:15;367] TALK ABOUT THIS.
[000:12:19;238] SPEAK OUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME
[000:12:21;540] CONVERSATIONS THROUGH
[000:12:22;241] INTERMEDIARIES TAKING PLACE.
[000:12:23;042] PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO

[000:12:40;726] THEY ARE VERY FEW GOOD OPTIONS,

[000:13:06;218] FROM THE FIRST ONE THAT THEY
[000:13:08;154] PUSH THROUGH JANUARY, IS REALLY
[000:13:08;888] THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE HHS
[000:13:12;458] AND STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE SPENT
[000:13:14;193] COMING UP WITH A STANDARD THAT
[000:13:15;194] THEY USE TO PICK WHICH COUNTRY

[000:13:29;208] AS PEOPLE COME TO THE

[000:13:38;384] WHETHER THEY SHARE INFORMATION
[000:13:43;022] WITH THE U.S. ABOUT TERRORIST

[000:24:57;996] DIFFERENT?
[000:24:58;463] WHY BRING THIS UP AGAIN TO WHAT
[000:25:01;132] APPEARS AT LEAST FOR NOW TO BE A
[000:25:04;669] FAILURE, IF YOU DID NOT HAVE
[000:25:06;071] SOMETHING TO PLACATE THOSE WHO
[000:25:08;073] ARE VOTING NO?
[000:25:08;640] >> I THINK TWO THINGS.
[000:25:11;476] THE TIME ISSUE.
[000:25:12;477] RIGHT NOW, REPUBLICANS ONLY HAVE
[000:25:13;278] UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK TO
[000:25:16;047] PASS AN OBAMACARE REPEAL.
[000:25:16;848] ONCE WE HIT SATURDAY, THEY
[000:25:18;250] CANNOT DO THIS ANYMORE, BECAUSE
[000:25:20;285] THEY LOSE THE ABILITY TO
[000:25:21;887] CIRCUMVENT DEMOCRATS AND BYPASS
[000:25:23;255] THE FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE.
[000:25:24;756] THAT GOES AWAY.
[000:25:26;057] IT DISAPPEARS.
[000:25:26;491] REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING BECAUSE
[000:25:28;960] OF THE TIME PRESSURE, PEOPLE
[000:25:30;529] WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY HAD TO
[000:25:32;063] SUPPORT SOMETHING RIGHT NOW,
[000:25:32;998] EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE
[000:25:34;599] EVERYTHING LEGISLATION LOOK
[000:25:38;670] REPUBLICANS, GRAHAM AND CASSIE,
[000:25:40;205] WERE GOING TO THROW
[000:25:40;972] MORE MONEY AT OPPONENTS.
[000:25:42;807] PUTTING MONEY IN ALASKA, ARIZON
[000:25:46;678] ARIZONA, AND ALSO KENTUCKY
[000:25:47;812] SQUARELY AT SENATORS, WHO ARE
[000:25:48;680] OPPOSED.
[000:25:49;281] THE ISSUE IS, YOU CANNOT BUY
[000:25:51;449] THESE GUYS ARE.
[000:25:53;084] JOHN McCAIN'S COMPLAINT IS NOT
[000:25:53;818] ABOUT MONEY AS MUCH IT IS ABOUT
[000:25:56;755] PROCESS.
[000:25:57;656] HE WANTS MORE COMMITTEE
[000:25:59;057] HEARINGS.
[000:25:59;424] ALSO RAND PAUL, HE HATES THE
[000:26:01;426] IDEA OF SENDING MONEY TO THE
[000:26:02;494] STATES.
[000:26:02;861] THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY FEDERAL
[000:26:04;362] HEALTH CARE MONEY.
[000:26:04;863] GET RID OF THAT.
[000:26:05;497] THESE ARE THINGS YOU CANNOT
[000:26:08;667] BRIDGE PEOPLE BY, AND
[000:26:10;869] REPUBLICANS, THE TIME IS
[000:26:11;503] TICKING, AND THEY WANT TO DO
[000:26:13;738] SOMETHING, BUT THEY ARE IN A BAD
[000:26:15;407] SPOT RIGHT NOW.
[000:26:17;275] >> Shepard: AND
[000:26:19;010] PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT
[000:26:19;711] NORTH KOREA ON THE ONE HAND AND
[000:26:20;478] RATCHETING THAT UP AND ON THE
[000:26:21;713] OTHER HAND, ALL THE RACISM WITH
[000:26:27;619] THE NFL.
[000:26:28;053] HE HAS NOT BEEN TWEETING ABOUT
[000:26:30;422] HEALTH CARE AT ALL.
[000:26:30;956] DOES HE CARE ABOUT THIS?
[000:26:33;425] >> WELL, HE CERTAINLY SAYS HE
[000:26:35;894] DOES.
[000:26:36;194] I CAN TELL YOU REPUBLICANS ON
[000:26:38;029] THE HILL ARE VERY UPSET ABOUT
[000:26:40;065] THE FACT THAT HE IS IN A WAR
[000:26:41;666] RIGHT NOW WITH THE NFL.
[000:26:43;034] THEY SAY IT IS A DISTRACTION.
[000:26:44;469] IT THEY COULD REALLY USE HIS
[000:26:46;338] HELP GETTING THIS ACROSS THE
[000:26:47;138] FINISH LINE, AND ANOTHER THING
[000:26:48;273] COMING HERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A
[000:26:49;674] BIG PUSH ON TAX REFORM.
[000:26:51;876] WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM PUT OUT
[000:26:53;278] A BUNCH OF DETAILS ON TAX
[000:26:54;512] REFORM.
[000:26:54;846] HE WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND
[000:26:56;548] SUPPORT.
[000:26:56;881] LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
[000:26:58;883] PAPERS RIGHT NOW.
[000:27:00;151] WE'RE SEEING SEEING AGAIN, LIKE
[000:27:00;885] YOU SAID, THE SPATS AND THESE
[000:27:05;624] ARE NOT THINGS THAT REPUBLICAN'S
[000:27:06;391] WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
[000:27:08;460] >> Shepard: REPUBLICANS MAY
[000:27:09;227] NOT WANT IT, RACHEL, BUT THIS
[000:27:13;064] THING, I READ THE EMAIL.
[000:27:15;233] I HAVE TWITTER, I LET THEM TAKE
[000:27:16;001] CARE OF IT.
[000:27:18;036] IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT FOR HIS
[000:27:20;071] BASE, DISSES THE RED MEAT OF ALL
[000:27:22;140] RED MEAT.
[000:27:23;308] THEY ARE ABLE TO RECLAIM THIS?
[000:27:25;276] THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY, THEY WERE
[000:27:27;679] ATTACKING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM,
[000:27:29;614] ATTACKING THE TROOPS, ATTACKING
[000:27:30;649] THE FLAG.
[000:27:31;650] NONE OF WHICH THEY ARE DOING.
[000:27:33;051] THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.
[000:27:35;654] THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT RACIAL
[000:27:36;321] INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY, AND
[000:27:37;489] THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT THE THINGS
[000:27:38;690] THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, AND
[000:27:40;659] HE TURNS IT AROUND FOR HIS BASE.
[000:27:43;061] IS THIS ALL A PLAY TO HIS BASE,
[000:27:45;563] AND COULD POSSIBLY BE SO THEY DO
[000:27:47;098] NOT NOTICE, THERE IS NO
[000:27:49;000] HEALTH CARE AND NORTH KOREA IS
[000:27:49;734] THE BIGGEST MESS SINCE THE
[000:27:52;804] COLD WAR?
[000:27:53;405] >> A DISTRACTION HE WANTS RIGHT
[000:27:54;139] NOW, RIGHT?
[000:27:56;608] A PLACE TO A CORNER OF HIS BASE,
[000:27:58;243] FRACTION.
[000:27:58;610] I'LL TELL YOU I'LL TALK TO A
[000:28:00;045] REPUBLICAN ABOUT THIS COUPLE OF
[000:28:00;779] HOURS AGO.
[000:28:02;380] THEY DO NOT SEE THIS HELPFUL AT
[000:28:05;650] ALL.
[000:28:06;384] THESE PROTESTERS WERE A FEW
[000:28:10;255] PLAYERS COME AND THEY'RE BARELY
[000:28:11;723] GETTING ANY HEADLINES, AND THEN
[000:28:13;358] TRUMP ATTACKS THEM, AND ATTACKED
[000:28:14;693] THE NFL, NEVER SINCE THEN, HE
[000:28:17;562] RATCHETED IT UP SO YOU HAVE 200
[000:28:20;665] PLAYERS TAKING A KNEE OR BACK IN
[000:28:23;802] THE LOCKER ROOM, NOT STANDING
[000:28:25;036] FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND IT
[000:28:26;104] IS AN UGLY DISPUTE RIGHT NOW.
[000:28:28;473] PEOPLE IN GENERAL DO NOT LIKE IT
[000:28:31;976] WHEN PEOPLE PROTEST THE
[000:28:34;145] NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:28:34;646] >> Shepard: THEY'RE NOT
[000:28:35;814] PROTESTING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:28:36;548] THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
[000:28:39;184] >> IT HAS BECOME MORE ABOUT THE
[000:28:43;455] FLAG, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE THE
[000:28:44;222] FOLKS FEEL THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:28:49;461] GOADING BLACK FOOTBALL PLAYERS
[000:28:50;195] AFTER THE CHARLOTTESVILLE
[000:28:52;130] CONTROVERSY A FEW WEEKS LATER.
[000:28:54;099] IT'S BATTLEGROUND FOR
[000:28:57;435] REPUBLICANS.
[000:28:57;836] >> Shepard: RACHEL BADE, GREAT
[000:28:59;237] TO SEE YOU FROM "POLTICO."
[000:28:59;904] KEEP IT UP.
[000:29:02;607] MORE ON THE SHOWDOWN WITH

[000:29:07;245] THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
[000:29:07;846] DECLARED WAR ON NORTH KOREA.
[000:29:10;448] THAT IS COMING UP IN 2 MINUTES
[000:29:12;050] PAIRED WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE
[000:29:13;818] MAN WHO POLICE SAY SHOT PEOPLE
[000:29:16;221] INSIDE A CHURCH IN TENNESSEE.
[000:29:17;055] IN THE USHER WHO RISKED HIS LIFE
[000:29:19;924] TO TAKE DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.
[000:29:20;625] THAT IS STRAIGHTAWAY.

[000:46:36;426] MUSICAL
[000:49:46;566] >> Shepard: OFFICIALS AND
[000:49:47;334] NORTH CAROLINA ARE TELLING
[000:49:47;968] PEOPLE TO LEAVE SOME AREAS OF
[000:49:48;702] THE OUTER BANKS AS HURRICANE
[000:49:50;170] MARIA MOVES TOWARD THE AREA.
[000:49:52;773] OFFICIALS HAD MANDATORY

[000:49:57;878] HERE'S THE LATEST TRACK FOR YOU,
[000:50:00;013] FORECASTERS SAY THEY DO NOT
[000:50:01;815] EXPECT THAT CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
[000:50:03;316] TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE
[000:50:04;384] UNITED STATES AT ALL.
[000:50:05;552] IT WILL NOT MAKE LANDFALL THEY
[000:50:06;820] TELL US, BUT THEY SAY IT WILL
[000:50:09;189] CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE
[000:50:10;490] UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST.
[000:50:12;025] TELLING PEOPLE TO PREPARE FOR
[000:50:13;794] STRONG WINDS, STORM SURGE, AND
[000:50:14;761] SOME FLOODING.
[000:50:17;531] THIS COMES DAYS AFTER THE STORM
[000:50:18;565] SLAMMED PUERTO RICO, LEAVING
[000:50:21;468] BEHIND DESTRUCTION AND I CANNOT
[000:50:22;502] POWER IT TO EVERYBODY THERE.
[000:50:23;236] OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH
[000:50:26;006] STRONGER.
[000:50:26;740] ONE LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY,
[000:50:28;075] HURRICANE MARIA SAID BACK TO
[000:50:29;276] UNITED STATES TERRITORY BY
[000:50:31;078] DECADES, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT
[000:50:32;112] ISLAND THAT IT WAS WEEK AGO.
[000:50:34;748] IMAGES TO SHOW YOU IN A
[000:50:36;616] SLIDESHOW THIS AFTERNOON,
[000:50:37;451] CERTAINLY DIFFERENT ISLAND AND
[000:50:38;552] IT WAS A WEEK AGO.
[000:50:39;119] PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AND AT

[000:50:44;991] REPORTS PEOPLE WAITED HOURS IN
[000:50:46;126] SOME AREAS TO GET A LITTLE BIT.
[000:50:48;161] HERE ARE KIDS FEELING JUGS WITH
[000:50:49;796] FRESH WATER IN A DISTRIBUTION
[000:50:51;398] POINT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER EAST
[000:50:52;699] OF THERE.
[000:50:53;133] EMERGENCY WORKERS DELIVERED MORE
[000:50:55;602] THAN 1 MILLION AND A HALF
[000:50:56;737] GALLONS OF WATER TO THE ISLAND.
[000:50:59;172] THIS IS SAN JUAN.
[000:51:00;741] A WI-FI HOT SPOT.
[000:51:01;241] PEOPLE GETTING SERVICE.
[000:51:03;343] CELL PHONES ARE TOUGH.
[000:51:05;145] WATER FLOWS FROM THE DAM ON THE
[000:51:06;213] NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND,
[000:51:07;748] WHERE OFFICIALS TOLD THOUSANDS
[000:51:09;883] OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.
[000:51:10;550] CONCERNS OF THE DAM WOULD BREAK
[000:51:11;284] AND CAUSE MORE FLOODING.
[000:51:14;755] MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
[000:51:15;455] OFFERING TO HELP THIS WOMAN
[000:51:16;156] EVACUATE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT
[000:51:18;391] OPENED THE GATES OF A DAM NEAR
[000:51:20;794] HER HOME.
[000:51:21;962] GERALDO RIVERA IS IN
[000:51:22;963] PUERTO RICO.
[000:51:23;363] HE IS PUERTO REAGAN HIMSELF AND
[000:51:27;667] HIS LIVE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:51:30;570] GERALDO, TELL US HOW IT IS FIRST
[000:51:33;073] AND?
[000:51:35;342] >> SHEP, LET ME WELCOME YOU TO
[000:51:38;578] PUERTO RICO ISLAND OF DESPAIR.
[000:51:40;981] THE ISLAND GOT RACKED BY
[000:51:42;749] HURRICANE IRMA TWO WEEKS AGO.
[000:51:43;984] THAT HURRICANE ACT OF 17% OF THE
[000:51:46;119] POWER GRID.
[000:51:48;822] THEN CAME THE MUCH MORE SAVAGE,
[000:51:51;758] POWERFUL HURRICANE MARIA, AND
[000:51:53;760] THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED
[000:51:54;461] THIS ISLAND.
[000:51:55;262] IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL
[000:51:59;366] FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.
[000:52:01;568] 80% OF THE CROPS HAD BEEN
[000:52:03;570] DESTROYED.
[000:52:03;937] THERE IS NO ELECTRIC POWER SHEP,
[000:52:08;341] THE POLLS ARE DOWN EVERYWHERE.
[000:52:09;910] THE LARGE CONDUCTIVE POLLS, THE
[000:52:13;513] TELEPHONE POLES, THERE'S VERY
[000:52:15;015] LITTLE COMMUNICATION.
[000:52:15;582] SO SERVICE, EXTREMELY SPOTTY.
[000:52:21;555] THERE IS NO SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS
[000:52:22;589] HAPPENING ON AN ISLAND WITH NO
[000:52:25;358] WATER AND NO FUEL THEN THE LINES
[000:52:27;127] AT THE SERVICE STATIONS.
[000:52:29;262] NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF
[000:52:34;768] PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT
[000:52:37;437] GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME
[000:52:40;574] AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS
[000:52:42;843] THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS
[000:52:45;545] STATION IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:52:46;546] WITHOUT GAS, THEY CAN'T RUN THE
[000:52:49;015] GENERATORS THAT THE FEW HAVE TWO
[000:52:51;151] POWER THE WATER PUMPS THAT ALLOW
[000:52:51;918] THEM NOT ONLY TO GET WATER TO
[000:52:54;754] BATHE AND DRINK, BUT ALSO TO RUN
[000:52:57;524] THE TOILET.
[000:52:58;758] THIS SITUATION IS AS DIRE AS YOU
[000:53:01;027] CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.
[000:53:02;529] 3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN
[000:53:05;932] THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION,
[000:53:07;067] AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET
[000:53:08;969] WORSE.
[000:53:09;269] THE MILLION AND A HALF GALLON
[000:53:11;538] ALREADY DELIVERED, A DROP IN THE
[000:53:13;707] BUCKET, IT IS NEEDED.
[000:53:16;343] >> Shepard: IN YOUR OPINION,
[000:53:18;178] GERALDO, WITH INTEREST AND A LOT
[000:53:19;246] OF LOVE THERE, ARE THEY GOING TO
[000:53:21;848] NEED AN AIRLIFT OR BOLT LEFT
[000:53:23;016] OUT OF THERE AND TO, OR CAN THEY
[000:53:25;752] GET THIS BACK UP AND RUNNING TO
[000:53:27;153] GET THIS FROM BEING A NECESSITY?
[000:53:33;560] >> SHEP, THERE HAS BEEN AN
[000:53:35;528] EXODUS FROM PUERTO RICO SINCE
[000:53:38;164] THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.
[000:53:39;432] THIS U.S. COMMONWEALTH IS
[000:53:41;468] BANKRUPT.
[000:53:42;369] MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT
[000:53:43;136] THE ISLAND.
[000:53:43;536] I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE PEOPLE
[000:53:47;140] FORCED TO LIVE UNDER THE
[000:53:48;408] PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS, THE YOUNG
[000:53:49;409] ONES WILL LEAVE.
[000:53:50;343] WHAT HAPPENS, THE OLD AND FEEBLE
[000:53:52;379] THEY STAY BEHIND, THEN YOU
[000:53:55;215] CANNOT LEAVE.
[000:53:56;149] SCHOOLS ARE CLOSER, BY THE WAY.
[000:53:58;451] BUSINESSES INCREDIBLY DISRUPTED.
[000:54:01;121] OF THE 3.4 MILLION, YOU'LL SEE A
[000:54:04;124] TREMENDOUS EXODUS TO FLORIDA,
[000:54:06;126] NEW YORK STATE, AND LESS THIS
[000:54:08;194] POWER GRID IS RESTORED.
[000:54:09;562] IT WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE BEFORE.
[000:54:11;164] IT WAS PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION, BY
[000:54:15;769] INCOMPETENCE, BY SCANDALOUS
[000:54:19;940] DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE PURCHASING
[000:54:21;207] FUEL OIL, PURCHASED THE LOW
[000:54:25;145] WAS GREAT, IT SOLD FOR THE
[000:54:26;479] HIGHEST.
[000:54:26;813] NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.
[000:54:31;117] TO BRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN
[000:54:34;988] AND THEY ARE NOBLE PEOPLE, AND
[000:54:36;923] ARE HELPING, BUT WITH THIS
[000:54:38;892] ISLAND NEEDS IS AN ENTIRE NEW
[000:54:39;759] POWER GRID.
[000:54:42;128] 3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A
[000:54:43;363] MANY STATES IN THE UNION.
[000:54:44;531] I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE
[000:54:45;765] IS A.
[000:54:48;134] OF SEVERE DISRUPTION.
[000:54:48;702] THEY ARE SAYING THAT 4-6 MONTHS
[000:54:52;339] BEFORE THEY GET THE POWER GRID
[000:54:54;007] UP AND RUNNING SO PEOPLE WOULD
[000:54:54;808] GENERATORS, THIS WILL BECOME A
[000:54:58;745] SYMBOL OF WHAT THEY BECOME
[000:55:00;347] TODAY.
[000:55:00;680] WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE
[000:55:02;148] BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF
[000:55:04;117] THE HURRICANES.
[000:55:05;518] THE TOURISM HERE ALSO SHREDDED.
[000:55:08;188] THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.
[000:55:09;856] IT IS BECAUSE -- EIGHT HUGE
[000:55:14;961] HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
[000:55:15;495] IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL
[000:55:17;330] JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE,
[000:55:19;499] BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A
[000:55:21;534] HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
[000:55:22;535] PEOPLE ARE IN DIRE STRAITS.
[000:55:24;738] THIS WILL BE A MARSHALL PLAN
[000:55:27;774] SCALE REBUILDING OF THE
[000:55:29;809] ELECTRICAL GRID BEFORE YOU CAN
[000:55:31;611] HAVE THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS
[000:55:32;946] WE KNOW IT IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:55:35;315] ARMED GUARDS ON THE GASOLINE.
[000:55:36;750] ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK INTO THIS
[000:55:38;551] CRISIS.
[000:55:38;885] IMAGINE A MONTH FROM NOW OR TWO
[000:55:40;854] MONTHS FROM NOW.
[000:55:42;122] KNOWING NO ONE HAD A HOT SHOWER,
[000:55:43;923] NO ONE CAN FLUSH THE TOILET BUT
[000:55:45;825] FOR THE COSTLY INCLUSION OF A
[000:55:49;129] GALLON OF GAS IN THE COMMODE.
[000:55:51;765] IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO BE
[000:55:53;967] LIKE, SHEP.
[000:55:54;934] THERE IS NO OVERSTATING THE
[000:55:56;970] CRISIS HERE, THE PRESIDENT
[000:55:58;304] SHOULD COME.
[000:55:58;905] THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR
[000:56:01;174] HIMSELF.
[000:56:01;508] SEND MARCO RUBIO AND HEAD OF
[000:56:02;609] FEMA, THEY ARE HERE TODAY.
[000:56:05;145] THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE
[000:56:06;312] CAME IN WITH THE PLANE.
[000:56:08;648] ALL THOSE GESTURES ARE VERY
[000:56:09;849] IMPORTANT, BUT YOU NEED IT
[000:56:12;385] SYSTEMIC REFORM, WAY TO BAIL
[000:56:14;020] THESE PEOPLE OUT.
[000:56:14;521] IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.
[000:56:16;756] MY FAMILY, GOD KNOWS I LOVE
[000:56:17;557] THEM.
[000:56:17;857] I LIVED IN THE VERY HOUSE WHEN I
[000:56:19;859] WAS A TEENAGER.
[000:56:22;095] THEY ARE HIGH-FUNCTIONING, THEIR
[000:56:24;831] CHILDREN HAVE BECOME DOCTORS.
[000:56:25;532] I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL
[000:56:27;100] HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE
[000:56:29;469] WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.
[000:56:33;573] MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR
[000:56:34;307] SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN
[000:56:36;109] LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT
[000:56:37;544] WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY,
[000:56:40;713] A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA
[000:56:47;587] MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.
[000:56:48;321] SPILLED BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR
[000:56:49;722] FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE OF
[000:56:51;157] PUERTO RICO
[000:56:51;758] THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.
[000:56:56;596] >> Shepard: WALL STREET WILL
[000:56:57;630] BE SHUTTING DOWN FOR THE DAY AND
[000:56:59;799] JUST ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND 15
[000:57:01;835] SECONDS.
[000:57:02;168] IT HAS BEEN A DOWN DAY.
[000:57:05;371] THE TACK
[000:57:06;339] GOT WALLOPED TODAY, BUT THERE IS
[000:57:07;941] SOME BRIGHT SPOT.
[000:57:08;741] NO CAVUTO CAN ALWAYS FIND HIM.
[000:57:09;909] YOU'LL START LOOKING FOR THEM
[000:57:13;980] WHEN "YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL
[000:57:14;647] CAVUTO BEGINS RIGHT AFTER THIS

[001:00:47;327] , IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO
[001:00:48;194] ANYTHING THAN UNDER THE FLAG.
