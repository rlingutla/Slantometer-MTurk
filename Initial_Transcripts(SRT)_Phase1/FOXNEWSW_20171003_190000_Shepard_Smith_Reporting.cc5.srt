RECOVERY IN TERMS OF SAVING

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
LIVES, 16 LIVES.

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THAT'S A LOT.

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
BUT YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT DIED IN

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OTHER HURRICANES AND FRANKLY

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE'RE NOT NEARLY AS SEVERE.

200
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I JUST HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR

201
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
FEMA AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT

202
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
GOVERNOR, YOU MAY WANT TO SAY

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SOMETHING.
>> WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
EFFORTS THAT THE FEDERAL

207
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED.

208
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT.

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
WE HAVE ALL THE WAY FROM MAYORS

BUCHANAN IS HERE AS WELL.

212
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS IF WE

213
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
DIDN'T HAVE THOSE SUPPORT.

214
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
OF COURSE, WE RECOGNIZE AND THE

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES WE STILL

216
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
NEED TO DO MORE.

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WE KNOW WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER,

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THIS IS A COMMITMENT BY THE

219
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
PRESIDENT, THE FIRST LADY BEING

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
BUILDING PUERTO RICO STRONGER

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THAN BEFORE.

226
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU.

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MAY HEARD

228
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
ON THE MAINLAND THAT IS NOT

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
HAPPENING HERE.

230
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
PEOPLE WERE ON THE ISLAND BEFORE

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
THE HURRICANE, BEFORE, DURING

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
AND AFTER MARIA.

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
SO WE'VE BEEN HIT BY A HURRICANE

234
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
CAT 5 IN LESS THAN TEN DAYS, ONE

235
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
AFTER THE OTHER.

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SO IT'S NOT BY THE NAVY AND THE

237
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
COAST GUARD.

238
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THEY ARE RESCUING MORE THAN 800

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
PEOPLE AND STILL ONGOING IN

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
RESCUE MISSIONS.

241
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,

242
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THE PUERTO RICAN HAS WORKED WITH

243
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
THE GOVERNOR, TO DEAL WITH THIS

244
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
ISSUE.

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE.
WE'RE USED TO HAVING A HURRICANE

246
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
BUT NEVER LIKE THIS ONE.

247
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THIS IS A MAJOR ONE.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
DEVASTATION.
THANKS FOR ALL OF THE HELP AND

249
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
ALL THE RESOURCES.

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
ALL FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ON THE

251
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
ISLAND BECAUSE OF YOU.

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> THANK YOU.

253
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
>> THE POWER GRID WAS DEVASTATED

254
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BEFORE THE HURRICANES EVEN HIT.

255
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THEN THE HURRICANES HIT.

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THEY WIPED THEM OUT.

257
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF

258
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
GENERATORS THAT HAVE BEEN

259
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
BROUGHT TO THE ISLAND.
MOST OF THE HOSPITALS ARE OPEN.

260
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
AT LEAST PARTIALLY OPEN.

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
MOST OF THEM NOW ARE OPEN.

262
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
AGAIN, THE JOB DONE HERE IS

263
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE.

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I APPRECIATE VIRTUALLY -- THIS

266
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000

BEHALF OF THE 3.5 MILLION U.S.

271
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
CITIZENS.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
IS A TEAM.
YOUR PEOPLE ARE DOING THE RIGHT

273
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
STUFF FOR US.

274
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
WE AS THE MAYOR -- THIS IS A

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
HELPING OF THOUSANDS AND

277
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000

EVERYBODY.
>> WHAT DID YOU MEAN EARLIER

280
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
THAT THEY COULD DO MORE?

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
>> Shepard: NOW THE PRESIDENT

282
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
WILL WALK IN THE BUILDING AND

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
BEGIN THIS EFFORT OF

284
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
DISTRIBUTING SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE

285
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
WHO WERE THERE.

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
SO LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.

287
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
[APPLAUSE]

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
[APPLAUSE]

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
>> THANK YOU.

290
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THANK YOU.

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
>> Shepard: THERE YOU HAVE IT.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
LOTS OF PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THE

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
PRESIDENT.

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
SOME WELL-WISHES, SOME CHEERS

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
AND APPLAUSE AND SOME SUPPLIES

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
TO BE HANDED OUT THERE.

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
OF COURSE, THE REAL PROBLEM IN

298
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN WITH

299
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
DISTRIBUTION.

300
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
SO MANY OF THE DRIVERS OF THE

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
TRUCKS THAT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
THE PRODUCTS, THAT ARE NECESSARY

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
FOR SURVIVAL AROUND THE ISLAND,

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
THOSE DRIVERS HAVE LOST IN MANY

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
CASES THEIR HOMES OR THEIR

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ABILITY TO GET WHEREVER THEY

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
NEED TO GO TO DRIVE THE

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
VEHICLES.
SO THEY'RE HAVING A LOT OF

309
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
PROBLEMS WITH DISTRIBUTION.

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
HURTING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SMALL

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
TOWNS AND OUTSIDE OF SAN JUAN.

312
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
TO HEAR IT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
THEY'RE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
CAN TO GET THE DISTRIBUTION

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
CHANNELS IN LINE SO THAT NO ONE

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
ELSE LOSES THEIR LIVES IN THE

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
HORROR THAT HAS BEEN PUERTO

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
RICO.

319
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
IN JUST A MOMENT, WE'LL RETURN

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
TO TRACE GALLAGHER WHO IS IN

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
LAS VEGAS.

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
AGAIN, THE HEADLINE FROM THIS

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
HOUR, WE NOW HAVE REPORTS FROM

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
THE DAILY MAIL THE UNITED

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
KINGDOM THAT THE GUNMAN BROUGHT

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
ALONG WITH ALL THE WEAPONS TO

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
CREATE HIS CARNAGE, CAMERAS TO

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
RECORD IT SET UP AT THE WINDOW

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
WHERE HE WAS SHOOTING AT LEAST

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ONE OF THEM AND IN A HALL SO HE

331
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
WOULD KNOW WHEN POLICE WERE

332
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
COMING.

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000

Patrick woke up
with a sore back.

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But he's got work to do.

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So he took Aleve this morning.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If he'd taken Tylenol,

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
he'd be stopping for
more pills right now.

341
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Only Aleve has the
strength to stop tough pain

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
for up to 12 hours
with just one pill.

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Tylenol can't do that.

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Aleve. All Day Strong.
All Day Long.

345
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Check this Sunday's paper

346

SOME HAD BEEN AUGMENTED, AFTER

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
SCENE PROCESSING THE WEAPONS AND

374
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
THE AMMUNITION.

375
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
THAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
MORE DAYS.
THEY WITH BACK HERE EARLY THIS

377
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
MORNING.
THE MANDALAY BAY IS FULLY OPEN

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
EXCEPT FOR THE 32nd FLOOR, WHICH

379
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
IS COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THIS VIDEO WHERE THE CONCERT

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
TOOK PLACE, STILL SHUT DOWN TO

382
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THE MEDIA AND THERE'S STILL

383
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
INVESTIGATORS CRAWLING ALL OVER

384
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THIS PLACE TRYING NOT TO DISTURB

385
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
THE EVIDENCE BY WEARING BOOTIES.

386
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
YOU CAN TELL THE CARS TELL THE

387
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
STORY HERE.

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
STILL HUNDREDS OF CARS AROUND

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THIS AREA.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WE HAD SOME PEOPLE COME OUT LAST

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
NIGHT ASKING US IF THEY COULD

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
GET THEIR CAR, ASKING POLICE.

393
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
THEY'RE BEING TOLD NO.

394
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT EVERY CAR

395
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
HAS TO MATCH UP TO A CERTAIN

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
PERSON.
AS WE ALL KNOW, SOME OF THESE

397
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
CARS WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY

398
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
THEIR OWNERS.

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THE FBI IS ON SCENE.

400
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
THEY'RE MAPPING CARS OVER HERE.

401
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
THERE'S A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
SOME OF THESE CARS TRIED TO GET

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
OUT WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
AND RAN INTO A DEAD END.

405
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THE GREEN JEEP HAS BLOOD-STAINED

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
HAND PRINTS ON THE HOOD.

407
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
IF YOU LEAVE THE CAR, LOOK

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
AROUND THE GROUND AND THERE'S

409
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
BLOOD PRINTS ALL THE WAY OUT

410
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HERE.

411
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
THIS DOESN'T GIVE US MOTIVE BUT

412
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
GIVES US AN IDEA HOW THE

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO MAP

414
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
THIS INVESTIGATION, WHICH COULD

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
GO ON FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS, SHEP.

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
>> Shepard: TRACE GALLAGHER ON

417
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
SCENE.
EACH ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN

418
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
LAS VEGAS HAS HIS OR OWN STORY.

419
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
ALL OF THEM HAVE PEOPLE THAT

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
CARE ABOUT THEM, WHO MISS THEM,

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
WHO MOURN THEM.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
WE'LL REMEMBER THE ONES ABOUT

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
WHICH WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND TELL

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
YOU ABOUT THEIR LIVES NEXT.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
FIRST, TWO YEARS AGO, THE

426
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
REPLICA EIFFEL TOWER AT THE

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
PARIS CASINO IN LAS VEGAS WENT

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
DARK IN MEMORY OF ALL THAT WENT

429
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
DIED IN A TERROR ATTACK IN THE

430
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
FRENCH CAPITOL.

431
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
LAST NIGHT, THE ORIGINAL

432
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
RETURNED THE RESPECT.

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
DARKENING THOSE THAT WERE KILLED

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
IN LAS VEGAS AND A WEEKEND

435
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
TERROR ATTACK IN MARSEILLE.

436
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
THE NEWS CONTINUES NEXT.

437
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
al stooe

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
when this guy got a flat tire

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
in the middle of the night,

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
so he got home safe.

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, my dad says our
insurance doesn't have that.

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What?!

443
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You can leave worry behind

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
when Liberty stands with you™.

445
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Liberty Mutual Insurance.

446
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But Prevagen helps your brain
with an ingredient

447
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
originally discovered...

448
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
in jellyfish.

449
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
In clinical trials,
Prevagen has been shown

450
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
to improve short-term memory.

451
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Prevagen. The name to remember.

452
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
>> Shepard: MUCH OF THE FOCUS IN

453
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
LAS VEGAS HAS BEEN ON THE

454
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
SHOOTER FOLLOWING THE MASSACRE.

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
BUT STORIES AFTER HEROISM

456
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
CONTINUE TO EMERGE.
FOR INSTANCE, 30-YEAR-OLD COPY

457
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
MACHINE REPAIR MAN JONATHAN

458
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
SMITH.
ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON

459
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
POST," THE FATHER OF THREE WAS

460
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY BUT

461
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
STAYED BEHIND TO DIRECT DOZENS

462
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
OF PEOPLE TO SAFETY.

463
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
A BULLET STRUCK HIM IN THE NECK

464
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
LEAVING HIM WITH A CRACKED RIB

465
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
AND BRUISED LINK.

466
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
THEN THERE'S 29-YEAR-OLD MARINE

467
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
VETERAN TAYLOR WINSTON WHO SAID

468
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
HE STOLE A TRUCK TO DRIVE PEOPLE

469
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
TO THE HOSPITAL.

470
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
HE TRANSPORTED BETWEEN 20 AND 30

471
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
PEOPLE AND LATER RETURNED THE

472
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
KEYS TO THE TRUCK'S OWNER AND

473
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THEN THERE'S TRAVIS PHIPPEN AN

474
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
EMT.
HE STAYED BEHIND TO REVIVE HIS

475
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
FATHER THAT WAS SHOT.

476
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
ONE OF THE GUNMAN'S BULLETS HIT

477
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
TRAVIS WHO IS EXPECTED TO

478
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
SURVIVE.

479
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
HIS FATHER DID NOT MAKE IT OUT

480
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ALIVE.
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WENT TO

481
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
HOSPITALS AFTER THE SHOOTING AND

482
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
SOME DOCTORS HAVE SAID IT WAS

483
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
VERY TOUGH TO KEEP UP AS THE

484
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
PATIENTS KEPT COMING.

485
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN

486
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HUNT IS LIVE AT UNIVERSITY

487
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
MEDICAL CENTER IN LAS VEGAS.

488
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
JONATHAN, HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE

489
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
STILL LISTED AS CRITICAL?

490
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
>> WELL, THERE'S TWO HOSPITALS

491
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
WITH CRITICAL PATIENTS NOW.

492
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
OVER AT SUNRISE MEDICAL, THEY

493
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
HAVE 33 IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

494
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
HERE AT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL

495
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
CENTER, 20 REMAIN AT THIS POINT

496
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
IN THE ICU.

497
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE SURGEONS

498
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
WHO HAS BEEN WORKING DAY AND

499
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
NIGHT HERE.
HE SAID MANY OF THE GUNSHOT

500
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
WOUNDS WERE SO HORRIFIC, A LOT

501
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
OF THE STAFF WILL LIKELY NEED

502
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.

503
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
LISTEN HERE.

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY

505
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
AND LOSS OF FOCUS.

506
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THAT CAN BE EASILY CORRECTED.

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
THE UNCONSCIOUS FORMS OF STRESS

508
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
ARE THINGS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE IN

509
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THE SECOND AND THIRD DAY.

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
WE HAVE DEBRIEFING TEAMS

511
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
OFFERING SERVICE TO THE STAFF.

512
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
>> A REMINDER, SHEP, AS WELL AS

513
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
SO MANY PHYSICAL SCARS, THERE

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
WILL BE MANY MENTAL SCARS THAT

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL.

516
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
>> TELL US HOW THE MURDERER

517
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
MODIFIED THE WEAPONS TO SHOOT

518
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
MORE BULLETS QUICKLY.

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
>> YEAH,  WE TALKED TO AN ATF

520
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
SERVICE THAT SAID SOME OF THE

521
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
WEAPONS WERE MODIFIED AS WHAT IS

522
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
CALLED A SLIDE-FIRE MECHANISM.

523
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
THE INFORMATION APPARENTLY AND

524
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
THE COMPONENTS TO DO THAT EASILY

525
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.

526
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
THIS VIDEO IS FROM ONE SUCH

527
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
SITE.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT MR. PADDOCK

528
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
USED THIS PARTICULAR SITE, OF

529
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
COURSE, BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF

530
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WHAT IS OUT THERE.

531
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WHAT IT DOES, ACCORDING TO OUR

532
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
SOURCE, IS CHANGED THE SHOULDER

533
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
REST AND EFFECTIVELY MAKE THE

534
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
TRIGGER MIMIC FULLY AUTOMATIC

535
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
OPERATION.

536
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
OUR SOURCE SAYS THAT IT

537
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
BASICALLY TURNS A SEMIAUTOMATIC

538
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
RIFLE INTO A MACHINE GUN AND

539
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
REMEMBER, PADDOCK WAS ARMED WITH

540
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
MORE THAN ONE MACHINE GUN.

541
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
THAT'S THE KIND OF FIREPOWER

542
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
THAT RAINED DOWN ON THOSE

543
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
INNOCENT CONCERT GOERS.

544
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
>> THANKS, JONATHAN.

545
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
FIRST A LOOK AT MORE OF THE

546
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
VICTIMS.

547
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
MEN AND WOMEN MURDERED AT A WARM

548
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
WEEKEND NIGHT IN LAS VEGAS.

549
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
People would stare.

550
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Psoriasis does that.

551
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It was tough getting out there
on stage.

552
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I wanted to be clear.

553
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I wanted it to last.

554
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
So I kept on fighting.

555
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I found something that worked.

556
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And keeps on working.

557
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Now?

558
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
They SEE ME.

559
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
SEE ME.

560
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
See if COSENTYX could make a
difference for you-

561
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
COSENTYX is proven to help
people with moderate

562
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
to severe plaque psoriasis...

563
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
...find clear skin that
can last.

564
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't use if you're allergic
to COSENTYX.

565
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Before starting COSENTYX,

566
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
you should be checked
for tuberculosis.

567
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
An increased risk of infections
and lowered ability

568
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
to fight them may occur.

569
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Tell your doctor if you have

570
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
an infection or symptoms.

571
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Or if you have received a
vaccine or plan to.

572
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If you have inflammatory
bowel disease,

573
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
tell your doctor if symptoms
develop or worsen.

574
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Serious allergic reactions
may occur.

575
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Never give up.

576
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
SEE ME.

577
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
SEE ME.

578
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Clear skin can last.

579
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Don't hold back...

580
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
...ask your dermatologist

581
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
if COSENTYX can help you

582
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
find clear skin that lasts.

583
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
>> I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE

584
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
FOX REPORT.
MORE OF TODAY'S HEADLINES.

585

WASHINGTON.

588
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
THIS COMES AFTER A MYSTERIOUS

589
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
SONIC ATTACK AGAINST AT LEAST 22

590
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
AMERICANS IN HAVANA.

591
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
THE SYMPTOMS ARE BRAIN DAMAGE

592
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
AND HEARING LOSS.

593
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED

594
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
ANY INVOLVEMENT.

595
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO

596
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
PULLING MOST OF ITS STAFF OUT OF

597
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
CUBA AND WARNING AMERICANS

598
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
AGAINST TRAVELING THERE.

599
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER A MASSIVE

600
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
EARTHQUAKE ROCKED MEXICO, SEARCH

601
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
TEAMS ARE STILL PULLING OUT

602
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
BODIES.

603
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THE QUICK KILLED MORE THAN 300

604
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
AND DAMAGED THOUSANDS OF HOMES.

605
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
MUSIC FANS REMEMBERING TOM PETTY

606
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
LEAVING CANDLES AND FLOWERS ON

607
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
HIS HOLLYWOOD STAR.

608
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
HIS MANAGER SAID HE WENT INTO

609
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
CARDIAC ARREST AND DIED AT THE

610
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
HOSPITAL.
HE WAS 66.

611
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH SHEP

612
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
AFTER THIS.

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
eed in retirement?

614
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Then we found out how many years
that money would last them.

615
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
How long do you
think we'll keep --

616
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Oooooohhh! You stopped!

617
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You're gonna leave me
back here at year 9?

618
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
How did this happen?

619
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It turned out, a lot
of people fell short,

620
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
of even the average
length of retirement.

621
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
We have to think about
not when we expect to live to,

622
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
but when we could live to.

623
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Let's plan for income that lasts
all our years in retirement.

624
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Prudential.
Bring your challenges.

625

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000

TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH

637
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
STORM VICTIMS IN PUERTO RICO.

638
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
OFFICIALS SAY ABOUT 95% OF THAT

639
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
ISLAND STILL HAS NO ELECTRICITY.

640
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THAT INCLUDES SOME HOSPITALS.

641
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL

642
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000

MONEY.
THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT COMES AS

CRITICS SAY THAT THE FEDS HAVE

646
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND.

647
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR HAS

648
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
DEFENDED THE TRUMP

649
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000

WEEK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

652
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
KILLING US WITH INEFFICIENCY.

653
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
THAT'S A QUOTE.

654
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
SHE ALSO SAID THAT PUERTO RICO

655
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
WAS HEADING TOWARDS GENOCIDE

656
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS.

657
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER THE WEEKEND

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000

00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
THE PRESIDENT ALSO TWEETED THAT

662
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS

663
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
PROGRESS.
DESPITE THAT, AS HE PUT IT,

664
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INGRATES

665
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
WE'RE SAYING.

666
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000

NOW ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT A GREAT

672
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
JOB WE'VE DONE.

673
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THAT.

I TELL YOU WHAT, WE'VE DONE JUST

AS GOOD IN PUERTO RICO.

677
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
IT'S A MUCH TOUGHER SITUATION.

678
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
BUT NOW THE ROADS ARE CLEARED,

679
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
COMMUNICATIONS ARE STARTING TO

680
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000

681
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
WE NEED THEIR TRUCK DRIVERS.

682
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
THEIR DRIVERS HAVE TO START

683
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
DRIVING TRUCKS.

684
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
WE HAVE TO DO THAT.

685
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ON A LOCAL LEVEL, WE NEED MORE

686
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
HELP.
THE FIRST RESPONDERS, MILITARY,

687
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
FEMA HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB

688
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
IN PUERTO RICO.

689
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP

MAYOR JUST BEFORE A BRIEFING ON

692
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
THE RELIEF EFFORTS.

693
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
YOU CAN MAKE OUT A LITTLE BIT OF

694
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
THAT OR WHAT SHE SAID TO THE

695
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000

EFFORTS, HE DID NOT MENTION THE

701
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
MAYOR.
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THE

702
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
TRUCKERS.

703
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTERS ON

704
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THE GROUND, MANY OF THOSE THAT

705
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
WOULD MOVE THE SUPPLIES HAVE

706
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
LOST THEIR HOMES AND VEHICLES IN

707
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THE STORM.
SOME OF THE TRUCKERS CAN'T BE

708
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
REACHED BECAUSE THERE'S NO

709
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
COMMUNICATION WORKING IN SO MANY

710
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
AREAS STILL.
REPORTS THAT A UNION TRUCKER'S

711
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
STRIKE ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS ARE

712
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
NOT TRUE.

713
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
THEY ARE IN FACT FAKE NEWS

714
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
SPREAD LARGELY BY A WEBSITE

715
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
CALLED CONSERVATIVE TREE HOUSE

716
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000

AGAIN, THERE'S NO TRUCKER'S

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
STRIKE.
THAT'S FAKE NEWS.

719
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
THE TRUCKERS IN PUERTO RICO ARE

LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT

737
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
SAID JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
>> HE WAS TREMENDOUSLY

739
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SUPPORTIVE.
HE KNEW THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM

740
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
BEGINNING, THIS GOVERNOR DID NOT

747
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
PLAY POLITICS.

748
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
HE DIDN'T PLAY IT AT ALL.

749
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
HE WAS SAYING IT LIKE IT WAS.

00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF WHACK.

770
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IN

771
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000

SAYING IT LOOKS LIKE THE

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
PRESIDENT WAS BLAMING PUERTO

778
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000

BLOW THE LINES FOR DISASTER

780
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
RELIEF AND THE ENORMOUS DEBT IN

781
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THE FOCUS IS ON DISASTER RELIEF

783
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
AND ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT PUERTO

784
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
RICO'S DEBT WILL HAVE TO WAIT

785
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
UNTIL LATER, UNTIL AFTER THEY

CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE.

THE GUNMAN DID THIS AND A HIGH

808
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000

TOWARDS DANGER AND TRACKED DOWN

810
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000

811
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
LISTEN HERE.

812
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000

WHAT HAPPENED IN LAS VEGAS IS IN

814
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
MANY WAYS A MIRACLE.

815
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE

816
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

817
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000

WE'RE LOOKING INTO HIM VERY

820
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
SERIOUSLY.
BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY,

821
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
VERY SICK INDIVIDUAL.

>> A LOT OF THORNY POLITICAL

823
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
ISSUES LIE AHEAD.

DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT GUN

825
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
CONTROL.

826
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
A BILL IN CONGRESS THAT APPEARS

827
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
TO HAVE BEEN SHELVED FOR NOW

828
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THAT MAKES SILENCERS ILLEGAL.

829
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HIS

830
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000

ARE STARTING TO REOPEN.

835
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
AS WE HEARD, MANY AREAS OF THE

836
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
ISLAND ARE STILL DEVASTATED AND

837
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
IN NEED OF SO MUCH HELP.

838
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000

A LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY.

850
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000

THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM, NO

THOSE REPORTS ARE EXAGGERATED.

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
PRESS AVAILABILITY AND PHOTO

927
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
OPPORTUNITY THERE UNLIKE ANY

928
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I'VE SEEN WITH PREVIOUS

929
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
PRESIDENTS AT DISASTERS.

930
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

931
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
YOU GOT THE SENSE THAT THE

932
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO PUT ON A

933
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
SHOW HERE AND TRYING TO

934
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
ADVERTISE HIMSELF AND WHAT HE'S

935
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
DONE AND DEFEND HIMSELF AND HIS

936
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
ADMINISTRATION.

937
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING ABOUT

938
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THIS TRIP AND WHAT YOU'LL ALSO

939
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
SEE WITH THIS TRIP THAT WILL

940
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
COME TOMORROW WITH LAS VEGAS.

941
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
THIS SQUEAK SPOTLIGHTS A ROLE

942
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THAT TRUMP HADN'T NECESSARILY

943
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
EXPECTED TO PLAY WHEN HE FIRST

944
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
RAN FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH IS THAT

945
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
OF CONSOLER IN CHIEF.

946
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
THAT OF A LEADER THAT IS COMING

947
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
TO THE COMFORT --

948
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
>> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE
WOULDN'T EXPECT TO DO THAT.

949
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
EVERY PRESIDENT FOREVER HAS HAD

950
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
TO DO THAT.

951
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
LOOK HOW GREAT RONALD REAGAN WAS

952
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
AT IT ON THE HEELS OF THE

953
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
CHALLENGER DISASTER.

954
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
EACH PRESIDENT SINCE THEN HAS

955
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
HAD A SHINING MOMENT IN TIMES OF

956
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
NEED, I WOULD SAY.

957
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

958
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER.

959
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
YOU'RE SEEING A PRESIDENT THAT

960
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
CAMPAIGNED ON THE IDEA THAT HE

961
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
WAS GOING TO BE A STRONG MAN

962
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
LIKE FIGURE, A FIGURE OF

963
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
STRENGTH.
HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT HE

964
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
DIDN'T REALLY CAMPAIGN ON.

965
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
>> Shepard: ALEX, HAVE TO CUT IT

966
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
SHORT.
THERE'S NEW INFORMATION COMING

967
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
IN TO FOX NEWS ABOUT THE

968
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS

969
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
MASSACRE, INCLUDING WORD THAT

970
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THE FEDS HAVE TALKED WITH AN

971
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
IMMEDIATE RELATIVE OF THE

972
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.

973
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
WE HAVE BRAND NEW DETAILS.

974
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
OUR CHIEF INTELLIGENCE

975
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE

976
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
JUST PULLED THEM TOGETHER.

977
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
LIVE TO HER NEXT.

978
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
KEEPING ME FROM THE
THINGS I LOVE TO DO.

979
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR,

980
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
AND CALL
844-214-2424.

981
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I just saved thousands
In less than a minute, I found
out how much home I can afford.

982
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I like how you shop for loans

983
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
the same way you
shop for flights online.

984
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I didn't realize at LendingTree

985
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
you can save money
on almost any sort of loan.

986
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I consolidated my credit card
debt with a personal loan.

987
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I found a new credit card
with 0% interest for 15 months.

988
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You just shop, compare,
and save. And it's all free.

989
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Go to LendingTree right now

990
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
and start saving.

991
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
>> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS NOW.

992
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE

993
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
INVESTIGATION OF THE MASSACRE IN

994
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
LAS VEGAS.

995
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
A U.S. GOVERNMENT SOURCE SAYS

996
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
THE FEDS HAVE INTERVIEWED A

997
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
RELATIVE OF THE SHOOTER'S

998
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
GIRLFRIEND AND WE HAVE JUST

999
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
LEARNED THAT IN THE 70s AND 80s,

1000
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THE SHOOTER WORKED AS A LETTER

1001
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
CARRIER AND AN IRS AGENT

1002
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
SEPARATELY FOR A TOTAL OF A

1003
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
DECADE.

1004
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
SO WHAT ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW

1005
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
WITH THE GIRLFRIEND'S FAMILY?

1006
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS THAT LIVE

1007
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
IN WASHINGTON.

1008
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
KATHERINE?

1009
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

1010
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY

1011
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

1012
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
PRODUCER, JAKE GIBSON.

1013
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
WE CONFIRMED THROUGH A U.S.

1014
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
GOVERNMENT SOURCE THAT FEDERAL

1015
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE INTERVIEWED A

1016
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
IMMEDIATE RELATIVELY MARILOU

1017
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
DANLEY.

1018
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
THIS RELATIVE SAID TO THE FBI

1019
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
THAT THEY FOUND PADDOCK UNSTABLE

1020
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
AND HE MADE THEM UNCOMFORTABLE.

1021
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
FBI OFFICIALS DECLINED TO

1022
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
COMMENT ON THIS INTERVIEW ONE

1023
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
WAY OR THE OTHER TO FOX NEWS

1024
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
EARLIER TODAY.

1025
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
AND THE FBI RAN PADDOCK THROUGH

1026
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM.

1027
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
WE'RE TOLD IT WILL TAKE A DAY OR

1028
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
TWO TO PROCESS HIS RECORD.

1029
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
THE FBI INDICATED IN CONNECTION

1030
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
TO TERROR WAS MADE BEFORE THE

1031
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
FULL ANALYSIS OF HIS ELECTRONICS

1032
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
WAS COMPLETE, SHEP.

1033
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
>> Shepard: CATHERINE, WHAT DO
WE KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY THAT

1034
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THIS MURDERER SENT OVERSEAS

1035
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
PRIOR TO THE MASSACRE?

1036
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
>> INVESTIGATORS HAVE DISCOVERED

1037
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THAT PADDOCK SENT TENS OF

1038
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
THOUSANDS OVERSEAS AND MAY HAVE

1039
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
BEEN TO THE GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU

1040
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
DANLEY.
THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.

1041
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
THEY THINK IT WAS TO THE

1042
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
PHILIPPINES BUT THERE'S

1043
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
CONFUSION OVER HER LOCATION AND

1044
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
WHETHER SHE'S IN JAPAN.

1045
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
HE SEND A LOT OF MONEY OVERSEAS

1046
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND

1047
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO

1048
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
DETERMINE IF IT WENT TO THIS

1049
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
GIRLFRIEND OR SOMEONE ASSOCIATED

1050
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
WITH HER, SHEP.

1051
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
>> Shepard: CATHERINE A LOT OF

1052
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
GAPS IN THE STORY OF THIS MAN.

1053
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
AUTHORITIES SAY IT'S SO RARE TO

1054
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
HAVE A SHOOTING WITHOUT A

1055
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
MOTIVE.
SOMETHING THEY HAVE NOT FOUND.

1056
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
>> EVERYONE I SPEAK TO ABOUT

1057
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THIS CASE, SHEP, TALKS ABOUT IT

1058
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
AS BEING AN ANOMALY.

1059
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
YOU KNOW FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE

1060
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
COVERING THESE EVENTS, THAT

1061
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
USUALLY WITHIN 24 HOURS YOU HAVE

1062
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
A GOOD SENSE OF THE SHOOTER AND

1063
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
A LIKELY MOTIVATION.

1064
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF PRESENCE

1065
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR THEY HAVE

1066
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
BEEN ON BLOGS WRITING ABOUT

1067
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
THEIR POINT OF VIEW.

1068
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THIS GUY IS REALLY A GHOST WHEN

1069
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND NO

1070
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
ONE HAS COME FORWARD IN A VERY

1071
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
PUBLIC WAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

1072
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
HIS MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN ON

1073
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
THE IDEOLOGY.

1074
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
BUT WHAT IS CLEAR FROM THE SCOPE

1075
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE

1076
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
LOCATIONS, THE FIREPOWER, THE

1077
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
AMMUNITION, ALL OF THESE THINGS

1078
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST

1079
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
24 HOURS IS THAT IT TOOK

1080
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
SIGNIFICANT PREMEDDATION, RIGHT?

1081
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

1082
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
THROW TOGETHER ON SHORT NOTICE.

1083
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
>> Shepard: NOT THIS CLEARLY.

1084
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
>> YEAH.
>> Shepard: NICE TO TALK WITH

1085
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
YOU.

1086
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
THANK YOU.
>> YOU BET.

1087
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
>> Shepard: WE'LL BE BACK WITH A

1088
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
LOOK AT TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS

1089
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
COURT VERDICTS IN AMERICAN

1090
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
HISTORY AND BOTH OF THEM
HAPPENED ON THIS DAY.

1091
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
(AVO)
When you have type 2 diabetes,
you manage your A1C,

1092
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
but you also have a higher risk
of heart attack or stroke.

1093
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Non-insulin Victoza®
lowers A1C,

1094
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
and now reduces
cardiovascular risk.

1095
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Victoza® lowers my
A1C and blood sugar

1096
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
better than
the leading
branded pill.

1097
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
(AVO)
And for people with
type 2 diabetes

1098
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
treating cardiovascular disease,
Victoza® is NOW approved

1099
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
to lower the risk of major
cardiovascular events

1100
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
such as heart attack,
stroke, or death.

1101
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
And while it isn't
for weight loss,

1102
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Victoza® may
help you lose some weight.

1103
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
(AVO)
Victoza® is not for people with
type 1 diabetes

1104
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
or diabetic ketoacidosis.
