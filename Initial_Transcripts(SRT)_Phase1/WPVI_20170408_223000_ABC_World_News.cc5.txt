[000:02:14;000] TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A
[000:02:14;634] DEFENSE.
[000:02:16;603] THE REASON YOU GENERALLY DON'T

[000:02:19;706] EASY AND INEXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY
[000:02:20;340] FIX.
[000:02:23;943] THE PENTAGON SAYS IT WAS FROM

[000:02:43;163] MR. ASSAD TO BLOW UP HIS PEOPLE.
[000:02:43;796] IT'S JUST NOT OKAY TO GAS THEM.
[000:02:44;430] >> WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:02:44;931] ANNOUNCED THE STRIKE HE POINTED
[000:02:46;766] TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED.

[000:02:51;471] DEATH FOR SO MANY.

[000:03:34;080] I TOLD THEM HELLO DARLINGS I
[000:03:34;681] TOOK TOO LONG.
[000:03:39;185] I RESCUED EVERYONE ELSE BUT I
[000:03:39;786] COULDN'T RESCUE YOU.

[000:03:41;754] WAS TAKEN YOUSSEF SAID I WASN'T
[000:03:43;356] AWARE OF ANYTHING.
[000:03:44;157] I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE.
[000:03:47;160] I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO HUG ME
[000:03:47;794] BACK.

[000:03:55;835] RESPOND TO THE U.S. ATTACK AND
[000:03:57;070] DO WE KNOW IF TODAY'S NEW
[000:03:59;205] BOMBING BY SYRIA OF THAT TOWN
[000:04:00;907] WHERE THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
[000:04:01;874] OCCURRED WAS THAT RETALIATION?
[000:04:07;614] >> Reporter: IT'S UNCLEAR
[000:04:08;681] WHETHER THAT SYRIAN ATTACK WAS
[000:04:09;716] IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE
[000:04:11;284] AMERICAN STRIKE WHICH PRESIDENT
[000:04:13;386] ASSAD HAS CALLED AN UNJUST ACT
[000:04:15;455] OF AGGRESSION BUT WE ARE SEEING

[000:05:06;072] SYRIA.
[000:05:06;472] >> BACK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA

[000:05:11;778] FOR BOMBING SYRIA BESIDES MORE
[000:05:15;315] DEBT AND A LONG TERM CONFLICT.
[000:05:16;849] OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL
[000:05:17;383] APPROVAL.
[000:05:19;952] TRUMP INFORMED CONGRESS AFTER
[000:05:22;055] THE MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED.
[000:05:24;724] GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ASKED
[000:05:25;291] SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
[000:05:27;260] IF THE STRIKE SIGNALS A CHANGE
[000:05:28;828] IN U.S. POLICY.
[000:05:31;998] >> THIS STRIKE WAS RELATED
[000:05:33;032] SOLELY TO THE MOST RECENT
[000:05:35;101] HORRIFIC USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:05:37;203] AGAINST WOMEN, CHILDREN AND AS

[000:15:11;143] THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO

[000:15:17;850] THIS TEENAGER DID.
[000:15:19;118] DID HIS PROM STRATEGY WORK?
[000:15:20;019] THAT'S COMING UP.
[000:15:22;988] My hygienist told me to try...
[000:15:58;257] ...a mouthwash.
[000:15:58;257] So I tried Crest.
[000:15:59;758] It does so much more than
[000:15:59;758] give me fresh breath.
[000:16:01;961] Crest Pro-Health mouthwash
[000:16:01;961] provides all...
[000:16:04;163] ...of these benefits to help you
[000:16:04;163] get better dental check-ups.
[000:16:07;199] Go Pro with Crest mouthwash.
[000:16:10;102] Checkup? Nailed it
[000:16:27;453] This
[000:16:28;320] This
[000:16:28;988] This is my body of proof.
[000:16:31;056] Proof of less joint pain
[000:16:33;826] and clearer skin.
[000:16:35;427] This is my body of proof that I
[000:16:35;427] can take on psoriatic
[000:16:38;464] arthritis with HUMIRA.
[000:16:41;000] HUMIRA works by targeting and
[000:16:41;000] helping to block a specific
[000:16:44;136] source of inflammation that
[000:16:44;136] contributes to both joint and
[000:16:46;839] skin symptoms.
[000:16:48;140] It's proven to help relieve
[000:16:48;140] pain, stop further joint damage,
[000:16:51;243] and clear skin in many adults.
[000:16:52;845] HUMIRA is the #1
[000:16:52;845] prescribed biologic
[000:16:54;980] for psoriatic arthritis.
[000:16:56;949] HUMIRA can lower your ability to
[000:16:56;949] fight infections,
[000:16:59;118] including tuberculosis.
[000:17:00;219] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:17:00;219] infections and cancers,
[000:17:02;855] including lymphoma, have
[000:17:02;855] happened; as have blood, liver,
[000:17:05;057] and nervous system problems,
[000:17:05;057] serious allergic reactions,
[000:17:07;059] and new or worsening heart
[000:17:07;059] failure.
[000:17:09;094] Before treatment, get tested for
[000:17:09;094] TB.
[000:17:10;863] Tell your doctor if you've been
[000:17:10;863] to areas where certain
[000:17:12;965] fungal infections are common,
[000:17:14;266] and if you've had TB,
[000:17:14;266] hepatitis B,
[000:17:16;835] are prone to infections, or have
[000:17:16;835] flu-like symptoms or sores.
[000:17:19;405] Don't start HUMIRA if you have
[000:17:19;405] an infection.
[000:17:20;773] Want more proof? Ask your
[000:17:20;773] rheumatologist about HUMIRA.
