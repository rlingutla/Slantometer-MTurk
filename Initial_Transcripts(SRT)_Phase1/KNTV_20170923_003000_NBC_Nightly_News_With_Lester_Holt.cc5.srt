how much money do you
think you'll need in retirement?

769
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then we found out how many years
that money would last them.

770
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How long do you
think we'll keep --

771

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're gonna leave me
back here at year 9?

How did this happen?

774
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It turned out, a lot
of people fell short,

775
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
of even the average
length of retirement.

776
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We have to think about
not when we expect to live to,

777
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
but when we could live to.

778
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's plan for income that lasts
all our years in retirement.
