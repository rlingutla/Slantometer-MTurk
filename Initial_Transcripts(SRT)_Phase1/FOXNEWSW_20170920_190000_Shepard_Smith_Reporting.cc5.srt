IT'S BEEN A BUSY HOUR.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'M HARRIS FAULKNER.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
WHERE HURRICANE MARIA HAS BEEN

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
PUNISHING THAT ISLAND WITH

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
POWERFUL WINDS.
>> WE'VE BEEN SEEING STRONG

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
WINDS WELL OVER 100 MILES FOR

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
TWO HOURS HERE, STRONG ENOUGH TO

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
CAUSE VISIBLE DESTRUCTION.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
WE'VE SEEN TREES SNAPPED, PARTS

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
OF WELL-MADE STRUCTURES

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
COLLAPSE.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
>> Shepard: AS STEVE CAN ATTEST,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
IT'S A CATASTROPHIC STORM.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
ONE OF THE STRONGEST TO EVER HIT

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
AMERICAN SOIL AND THE

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
DESTRUCTION COULD BE WIDESPREAD.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
WE'RE TRACKING THE HURRICANE.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
PLUS, IN MEXICO CITY, CRIES OF

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
ANGUISH AT THE SITE OF A SCHOOL

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
COLLAPSED IN THE EARTHQUAKE.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
PARENTS STILL WAITING TO FIND

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR KIDS.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
RESCUERS WORKING THROUGH THE

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
NIGHT, SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS.

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
WE'LL GO THERE LIVE.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SET TO MEET WITH

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
THE LEADER OF OUR STRONGEST

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
ALLY.

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
WE'RE EXPECTING THAT IN THIS

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HOUR.
LET'S GET TO IT.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
WE'RE TRACKING TWO DEADLY

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
NATURAL DISASTERS.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
THE DANGEROUS HURRICANE MAKING

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
ITS WAY ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN AND

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
THE EARTHQUAKE IN MEXICO.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
WE'LL GO LIVE TO MEXICO CITY IN

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
JUST A MOMENT.
BUT HURRICANE MARIA HAS KILLED

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
ANYBODY PEOPLE ACROSS THE

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
CARIBBEAN.
TODAY IT MADE LANDFALL AS ONE OF

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THE STRONGEST TO HIT PUERTO RICO

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AND ST. CROIX.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR SAYS

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
PUERTO RICANS HAVE NOT

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
EXPERIENCED AN EVENT OF THIS

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
MAGNITUDE IN THEIR MODERN

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
HISTORY.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE STORM FROM

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SPACE AS THE CORE MOVES OVER

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
PUERTO RICO.
THE HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL AS A

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
CATEGORY FOUR.
THE STORM ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
OF THE ISLAND WITH SUSTAINED

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
WINDS OF 155 MILES AN HOUR.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
WARNING OF LIFE THREATENING

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
WINDS AND STORM SURGE AND RAIN

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
OVER PUERTO RICO IN ST. CROIX

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
TODAY.
WATER LEVELS COULD RISE UP TO

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
NINE FEET ON PUERTO RICO WITH

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
LARGE AND DESTRUCTIVE WAVES.

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THE DANGEROUS WINDS ARE EXPECTED

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
TO CONTINUE FOR 24 HOURS.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
PUERTO RICAN OFFICIALS SAY

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
TO BE REBUILD.

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
THEY SAY THE STORM COULD

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
"DECIMATE" THE ISLAND'S POWER

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
COMPANY.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ON PUERTO

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
RICO'S NORTHERN COAST, THE MAYOR

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
SAID FOUR OUT OF FIVE HOMES ARE

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
DESTROYED.
THE STORM HAS SNAPPED PALM

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
TREES, PEELED OFF ROOFTOPS.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL OF

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
SAN JUAN ARE REPORTING

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
WIDESPREAD FLOODING.

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
SOME IN HIGH RISE APARTMENTS.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
ONE WOMAN THAT LIVES IN SAN JUAN

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
TOLD THE "MIAMI HERALD" THAT HER

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
HOUSE WAS TREMBLING.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE RAIN HORIZONTAL AND ALL THE

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
TREES ON THE GROUND.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SHE SAID THE WINDS ARE LIKE

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
WE'RE ALSO GETTING A LOOK AT THE

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
DEVASTATION ON THE SMALL ISLAND

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
OF DOMINIC DiNATALE --

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
DOMINIQUE.
THE STORM HIT AND BLEW AWAY THE

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
MAYOR'S ROOF.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE DAMAGE IN

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
ST. CROIX, ONE OF THE U.S.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
VIRGIN ISLANDS.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THE HURRICANE SIDE SWIPED THE

103
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ISLAND.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
KNOCKING OVER TREES, TOPPLING

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
POWER LINES AND CAUSING SEVERE

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
FLOODING.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OFFICIALS IN ST. CROIX WARNED

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
PEOPLE TO STAY AWAKE MOST OF THE

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
NIGHT AND KEEP THEIR SHOES ON IN

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CASE THEY NEEDED TO RUN.

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
FORECASTERS SAY HURRICANE FORCE

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WINDS EXTEND 60 MILES FROM THE

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
EYE OF MARIA.

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THEY SAY THE CENTER OF THE STORM

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IS EXPECTED TO CROSS OVER THE

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
COAST OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
TONIGHT BEFORE MOVING TO THE

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE
BAHAMAS.

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO STEVE

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
HARRIGAN WHO IS LIVE IN SAN JUAN

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
FOR US THIS AFTERNOON.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
STEVE, LOOKS LIKE THINGS HAVE

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
CALMED DOWN.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE NOW?

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
>> SHEPARD, THE WIND HAS CALMED

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
CONSIDERABLY, UNDER 50 MILES PER

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
HOUR THAT MEANS THE POLICE AND

128
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FIRST RESPONDERS CAN GO OUT.

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK HERE, IT'S A

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
WET MISS AND IT'S NOT GETTING

131
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BETTER SOON.

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WHERE I'M STANDING NOW, CHUNKS

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
OF BUILDINGS, SATELLITE DISHES,

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
BALCONIES, PIECES OF WALL, HOLES

135
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
IN BUILDINGS.

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THAT WAS 145 MILES PER HOUR

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
WINDS EARLIER THIS MORNING.

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
WE JUST MOVED AROUND TO A

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
IF YOUR HOUSE IS MADE OF WOOD

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WITH A METAL ROOF, JUST GONE.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SOME HOUSES WE SAW ON THE STREET

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
GONE.
TO MOVE AROUND HERE, IT'S

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
STREAMLY DIFFICULT.
IF YOU'RE AN AVERAGE CITIZEN IN

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
PUERTO RICO RIGHT NOW, YOU MIGHT

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
NOT HAVE A ROOF.

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
YOU PROBABLY HAVE STRUCTURAL

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
DAMAGE WHEREVER YOU LIVE AND YOU

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
DEFINITELY DO NOT HAVE

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
ELECTRICITY.

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A SITUATION THAT COULD LAST FOR

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WEEKS OR MONTHS, SHEPARD.

153
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
>> GOING FORWARD, FLOODS AND

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MUDSLIDES.
>> IT'S NOT OVER YET.

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
THE WINDS WERE DRAMATIC AND

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
POSSIBLY DEADLY.

157
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS YET.

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
WE SAW POWER CREWS OUT ON FOOT

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THERE'S SO MANY DOWNED POWER

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
LINES AND DOWNED BRANCHES.

162
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THEY WERE WALKING TO TRY TO

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ASSESS THE DAMAGE.

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
AS FAR AS THE MUDSLIDES GO,

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
MOUNTAINOUS PART OF THE COUNTRY

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THAT IS LIKELY WHEN YOU GET

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
10-15 INCHES OF RAIN.

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
FEMA HAS PREPOSITIONED HERE.

170
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WE'LL SEARCH AND RESCUE AND A

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
LOT OF RECOVERY.
>> Shepard: THANKS, STEVE.

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
LET'S GET TO RICK REICHMUTH IN

173
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
THE EXTREME WEATHER CENTER, THIS

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
IS AWFUL.
>> A HORRIBLE FORM.

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
MAKING LANDFALL 6:15 A.M.

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
MAYBE A LITTLE BRIGHT NEWS,

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ANOTHER GOING OVER LAND DURING

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
ALMOST EVERY RECORD IN PUERTO

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
RICO AT RECORD FLOOD STAGE.

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ALL OF THEM GOING UP INCREDIBLY

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
FAST.

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
UNFORTUNATELY, CUTTING A CROSS

184
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ISLAND.

185
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
EVERYBODY FEELING THE IMPACTS OF

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THIS STORM, THIS IS THE FUTURE

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
RADAR.
THE RUSSIA ARE THE HURRICANE

188
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
FORCE WINDS STAYING TO THE NORTH

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE IDEA OF

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THE D.R.

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
HOPEFULLY TO THE EAST OF TURKS

192
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
AND CAICOS THAT GOT DEVASTATED

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
BY IRMA A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THEN IT CONTINUES TO PULL TO THE

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
NORTH.

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
MOST OF THE MODELS MAKE THIS

197
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
NORTH WARD TURN HERE.

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE

199
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE U.S.

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WHICH WE THOUGHT WOULD HAVE A

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
DISTRICT IMPACT, THIS IS

202
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
FOLLOWING A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY

203
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AS TO WHAT THE HURRICANE JOSE

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
HAS DONE.

205
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
PULLING TO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AROUND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST.

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WE'LL BE ADDING IMPACTS ACROSS

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
AND THURSDAY AS THE STORM PULLS

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
OFF TO THE NORTH.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THAT SAID, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT

212
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THE IMPACTS ARE.

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
DO WE HAVE A DISTRICT HIT

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SOMEWHERE?
MAYBE ON THE OUTER BANKS?

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
SOMEWHERE FARTHER IN FROM NEW

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
YORK CITY UP AROUND PARTS OF THE

218
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
NORTHEAST, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
WE DO KNOW, ENVIRONMENTAL

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE

221
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
FOR A STRONG HURRICANE.

222
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THE WATER TEMPERATURES COME DOWN

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
AS WELL.

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
ALL GUIDANCES HAVE A WEAKER

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
STORM.
BUT TUESDAY, A STORM OFF THE

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
SHORE OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, SHEP.

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
>> Shepard: WHAT A SEASON, RICK.

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH

229
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THIS THING?

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
NO LIGHTS, NO WAY TO GET HELP,

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
NO IDEA WHETHER YOUR HOME WILL

232
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
STAND UP OR FALL DOWN AROUND

233
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
YOU.

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
WE'LL SPEAK WITH A WOMAN RIDING

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
OUT THE STORM, HIDING IN HER

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
CLOSET.
THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
NEWS DECK ON THIS WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON.
Ugh. Heartburn.

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Sorry Ma'am.
No burning here.

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Try Alka-Seltzer

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Heartburn relief
gummies.

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They don't taste
chalky and work fast.

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
MMMM. Incredible.

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can I try?

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She doesn't
have heartburn.

245
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Alka-Seltzer heartburn
relief gummies.

246
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Enjoy the relief.

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
TECH: When you schedule
with Safelite AutoGlass,
You get a text
when we're on our way.

248
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can see exactly
when we'll arrive.

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm Micah with Safelite.

250
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
CUSTOMER: Thanks for coming,
it's right over here.

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
TECH: Giving you a few more
minutes for what matters most.

252
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Take care.

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
KIDS SINGING:
Safelite® repair,
Safelite® replace.

254
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
>> Shepard: MORE ON HURRICANE

255
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
MARIA AS IT BATTERS PUERTO RICO.

256
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
OFFICIALS SAY THE EXTREMELY

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
DANGEROUS STORM KNOCKED OUT

258
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
POWER TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND.

259
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
BLEW OUT WINDOWS IN SAN JUAN.

260
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
LET'S TURN TO JENNIFER GONZALEZ

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
COLON NOW.
SHE'S PUERTO RICO'S RESIDENT

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
COMMISSIONER.
THE ISLAND'S REPRESENTATIVE IN

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
CONGRESS AND RIDING OUT THE

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
STORM IN A CLOSET EAST OF

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
SAN JUAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>> RIGHT NOW, I'M FINE.

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
WAITING UNTIL THE WINDS GETS

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
OVER THE ISLAND.
WE ARE STILL HAVING WINDS MORE

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
THAN 60 MILES PER HOUR.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
SO OFFICIALS ARE ASKING PEOPLE

271
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TO REMAIN AT THEIR HOMES BECAUSE

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
IT'S NOT SAFE YET TO GET OUT OF

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
THE HOUSES.

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THERE'S A LOT OF FLOODING IN

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
MANY AREAS.

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WE RECEIVED BETWEEN 12 TO 35

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
INCHES OF RAIN DURING THIS DAY.

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THE WINDS BEGAN AT 1:00 A.M. IN

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THE MORNING.

280
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
WE'RE STILL HAVING THE SEVERE

281
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
CONDITIONS AND SEVERE WINDS

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
ACROSS THE ISLAND.

283
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IS THAT

284
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
THE RIVERS OVERFLOWED THEIR

285
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
BANKS.
SO IT'S REALLY SCARY.

286
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
WE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
HURRICANE BEFORE.

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
OF COURSE, THE WHOLE ISLAND IS

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WITHOUT POWER.

290
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
>> Shepard: HOW ARE YOU TALKING

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
TO US?

292
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
>> I HAVE EXTRA BATTERIES FOR MY

293
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
CELL PHONE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WAY TO HAVE COMMUNICATION.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
ACTUALLY, A LOT OF COMMUNICATION

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
TOWERS WENT DOWN AND ARE OFF

297
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
LINE.

298
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE

299
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
ISLAND DO NOT HAVE COMMUNICATION

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
AT THIS TIME.
SO THAT'S MAYBE THE REASON SOME

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE STATES

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
ARE CALLING THEIR FAMILIES AND

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
PEOPLE AND FRIENDS IN PUERTO

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
RICO AND THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING,

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
BECAUSE OF THAT.

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
>> Shepard: REPRESENTATIVE

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
GONZALEZ COLON, THERE'S SO MANY

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
PUERTO RICANS, THERE'S SO MANY

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
CONCERNED ABOUT THE AREA OUTSIDE

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
OF THE CAPITOL.

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
WHAT DO YOU KNOW FROM THE

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
NEIGHBORHOODS?
WERE PEOPLE EVACUATED

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
EFFICIENTLY?
>> YES, STILL, A LOT OF PEOPLE

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
ARE STILL HERE BECAUSE OF THE

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
FLOODING AND THE RIVERS OUT OF

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THEIR BANKS.

317
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THIS IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
RIGHT NOW.

319
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
IT'S NOT SAFE TO GET OUT OF THE

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
HOUSES.
IN SAN JUAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE AREAS

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
HIT HARD.
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WINDS.

324
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH WOODEN

325
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
HOUSES.

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THOSE WOODEN HOUSES ARE ALMOST

327
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
GONE IN MANY AREAS OF THE

328
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
ISLAND.

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'M SPEAKING WITH YOU.

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'M STILL HAVING HEAVY WINDS IN

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
MY OWN HOUSE.

332
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
THE HOUSE JUST TREMBLED DURING

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THIS SITUATION.

334
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
>> Shepard: CONGRESS WOMAN, FOR

335
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
OUR VIEWERS WATCHING ACROSS THE

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
48 AND AROUND THE WORLD THIS

337
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
AFTERNOON, WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO

338
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
HELP YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF

339
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
PUERTO RICO?
WHAT IS THE MOST URGENT NEED?

340
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
HOW CAN WE HELP?

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
>> THE MOST URGENT NEED IS

342
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
RESTORING THE POWER ON THE

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
ISLAND.
FOR THAT MATTER, I ASK DIRECTLY

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE LAST

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
NIGHT.

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
HE CALLED ME.
I ASKED HIM DIRECTLY AND SOME

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
OTHER CABINET MEMBERS TO SEND

348
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
ELECTRIC TEAMS TO THE ISLAND TO

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
HELP US RESTORE THE POWER GRID.

350
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
THE SECOND ONE, THE GOVERNOR OF

351
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
PUERTO RICO, HELP FOR THOSE

352
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR

353
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
BELONGINGS.

354
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME

355
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
TO RECOVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF

356
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
THE ISLAND.

357
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
ROADS, BRIDGES AND MANY

358
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN HIT DIRECTLY

359
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
BY THIS HURRICANE.
YOU'LL HAVE THAT.

360
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
ALSO IN THE HOTELS AND METRO

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
AREA.

362
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE FULL

363
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE OF THIS

364
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
MONSTER HURRICANE LEFT US HERE.

365
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>> Shepard: I KNOW THE GREATEST

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
FEARS ARE FOR THE VERY YOUNG AND

367
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THE VERY OLD.

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO REMEMBER

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS

370
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
JUST LIKE ALL OF US.

371
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
THEY DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
SALUTE THE SAME FLAG.

373
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I KNOW THIS NATION AND THE

374
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
GENEROUS PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL

375
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
RESPOND AS THEY ALWAYS DO.

376
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
ALL THE BEST, CONGRESSWOMAN.

377
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT YOU.

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
>> THANK YOU.

379
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
AS YOU SAID, THERE'S FOUR

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS HERE.

381
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
FIVE MILLION PUERTO RICANS IN

382
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THE MAINLAND.

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
IT'S THE THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN

384
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
A MONTH THAT A HURRICANE

385
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
LANDFALL ON THE U.S. SOIL.

386
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
IN OUR CASE, TWICE.

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
IRMA AND WITH MARIA.

388
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
WE'VE BEEN MANAGING PEOPLE FROM

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
ST. THOMAS, THE U.S. VIRGIN

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
ISLANDS, THE BRITISH VIRGIN

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
ISLANDS, GIVING SHELTER TO THEM.

392
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF

393
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
HELP.

394
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I WANT TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT

395
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
MIKE PENCE AND FEMA DIRECTOR FOR

396
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
THEIR CALLS AND THEIR DILIGENCE.

397
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE ISLAND,

398
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
FEMA, WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR,

399
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
WORKING WITH THE TEAMS.

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
WE MAY NEED A LOT OF HELP TO

401
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
HELP THE ISLAND RECOVER.

402
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
>> Shepard: WE'LL BE SPEAKING TO

403
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
BROCK LONG IN JUST A MOMENT FROM

404

FEMA.

405
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
THANKS, REPRESENTATIVE

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000

THANKS VERY MUCH.

407

>> Shepard: A NINTH PATIENT HAS

409
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
DIED AFTER HURRICANE IRMA TURNED

A FLORIDA NURSING HOME INTO AN

411
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
OVEN.
THAT'S THE WORD OF POLICE FROM

412

HOLLYWOOD.
COPS THERE SAY THE LATEST VICTIM

413
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
HAD BEEN 93 YEARS OLD.

414
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THIS COMES NEARLY A WEEK AFTER

415
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
RESCUERS FOUND ELDERLY PATIENTS

416
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
SWELTERING IN THAT FACILITY.

417
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THE STORM KNOCKED OUT THE AIR

418
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
CONDITIONING.

419
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
INVESTIGATORS SAY THE STAFF

420
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
DIDN'T CALL 911 FOR THREE DAYS.

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
INVESTIGATORS HAVE LAUNCHED A

422
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION NOW.

423
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
THE CENTER'S ADMINISTRATOR HAS

424
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
SAID THAT STAFFERS DILIGENTLY

425
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
PREPARED FOR THE IMPACT OF

426
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
HURRICANE IRMA.

427
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
YET WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING

428
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
WENT OUT ON ELDERLY AND

429
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
INFIRMED, THEY DID NOT CALL 911

430
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
FOR THREE DAYS.

431
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
WE'RE WATCHING THE AFTERMATH OF

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER.

433
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
ONE THAT BROKE DURING THIS HOUR

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
YESTERDAY.
CREWS ARE DIGGING THROUGH THE

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
AGONIZING HOURS GO BY.

FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE,

Mmm, fine.

Okay, what do we got?

Okay, watch this.
Do the thing we talked about.

What do we say?
It's going to be great. Watch.

>> Shepard: EVEN BEFORE THIS

463
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
STORM, PUERTO RICO HAD A

464
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND

465
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
TENS OF BILLIONS IN DEBT.

466
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
THIS WILL COMPOUND THE PROBLEMS.

467
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
POWER LINES ALL OVER PUERTO

468
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
RICO.

469
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
TWO WEEKS AGO, HUNDREDS OF

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
THOUSANDING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
NOW ALL OF PUERTO RICO IS

472
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
WITHOUT POWER RIGHT NOW.

473
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
THESE HURRICANES CAUSING MORE

474
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
PROBLEMS FOR AN ISLAND THAT HAS

475
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
SPENT YEARS IN FINANCIAL CRISIS.

476
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
TRACE GALLAGHER WITH THIS ONE

477
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
FOR US.

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TRACE?
>> SHEP, THE ECONOMY IS

479
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
EXTREMELY DIRE.

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
PUERTO RICO IS A PUERTO RICO --

481
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
POOR ISLAND TO BEGIN WITH.

482
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
THEY HAVE BILLIONS IN UNFUNDED

483
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
PENSIONS TO TEACHERS AND

484
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.

485
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

486
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
ISLAND WITH FIVE MILLION PEOPLE,

487
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THAT IS ASTOUNDING.

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PUERTO

489
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
RICO'S BEST AND BRIGHTEST LEAVE

490
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THE ISLAND EACH YEAR FOR BETTER

491
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
JOBS IN THE U.S.

492
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE STATE OF

493
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
EMERGENCY IN PUERTO RICO

494
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
DECLARED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP

495
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
COULD MEAN A LOT OF FEDERAL

496
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
DOLLARS FLOWING INTO THE ISLAND,

497
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
WHICH COULD BOOST THE ECONOMY AT

498
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
LEAST TEMPORARILY.

499
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
SHEP?
>> Shepard: TRACE, THE STORMS

500
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
HAVE SHOWN HOW BAD SOME OF

501
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
PUERTO RICO'S INFRASTRUCTURE

502
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
PROBLEMS ARE.
>> RIGHT.
WE TALK ABOUT THE ISLAND BEING

503
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
WITHOUT POWER.

504
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
10% IS ALREADY WITHOUT POWER

505
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
FOLLOWING HURRICANE IRMA WHICH

506
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
DIDN'T HAVE A DIRECT HIT.

507
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
THE NUMBER 1 CLIENT IS THE WATER

508
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
COMPANY.
SO NO POWER MEANS NO WATER, NO

509
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
SEWER.
UNLIKE HERE IN THE U.S., THE

510
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
CELL PHONE PROVIDERS IN PUERTO

511
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
RICO RELY SOLELY ON THE PUBLIC

512
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
POWER GRID.

513
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
SO COMMUNICATIONS ARE ALSO VERY

514
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
LIMITED AND THE ISLAND'S POWER

515
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
AUTHORITY IS MASSIVELY IN DEBT.

516
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
SO TURNING THE LIGHTS BACK ON

517
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS.

518
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE,

519
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
IT GETS WORSE.

520
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
RETAINING WALLS AND BUILDINGS

521
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
ARE WEAK.

522
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
IN SOME CASES, THEY'RE DANGEROUS

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
BY YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

524
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
AND MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE

525
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
UNDERFUNDED AND COULD BE

526
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
OVERWHELMED BY THE STORM.

527
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
WE'RE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF

739
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
THE CITY, WHICH IS WARDS WHERE

740
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
THE SCHOOL IS THAT YOU'RE

741
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
TALKING ABOUT.
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE

742
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
SCENES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY

743
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
CHILDREN STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR.

744
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THAT DIGGING WILL GO ON

745
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
OBVIOUSLY UNTIL THEY HAVE

746
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
ACCOUNTED FOR EVERYBODY WHO MAY

747
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
HAVE BEEN IN THAT SCHOOL.

748
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
THE SAME WITH THE BUILDING I'M

749
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
STANDING IN FRONT OF RIGHT NOW.

750
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
THE SAME WITH ALL OF THE 40 OR

751
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
SO BUILDINGS THAT COLLAPSED HERE

752
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
IN MEXICO CITY.

753
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
PRESIDE

754
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS DECLARED

755
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THREE DAYS OF MOURNING.

756
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
IT'S RIGHT NOW A RESCUE

757
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
OPERATION.
THE FOCUS IS FINDING PEOPLE

758
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
UNDER THIS RUBBLE WHO MAY STILL

759
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
BE ALIVE.

760
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WE'RE TOLD, AS YOU LOOK AT THE

761
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
PICTURES OF THE SCHOOL, THE

762
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE

763
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
SOUTHERN PART OF MEXICO CITY,

764
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
THAT THEY FOUND ONE YOUNG GIRL

765
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
ALIVE.
THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST TO GET

766
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
TO HER.

767
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A VERY, VERY

768
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
DIFFICULT OPERATION.

769
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
A VERY DANGEROUS OPERATION.

770
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
WHEN RESCUE WORKERS GO IN TO

771
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
PERFORM THE OPERATIONS AS WE SAW

772
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
A FEW YEARS AGO IN HAITI,

773
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT

774
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
RISK.

775
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
ONE WRONG MOVE, ONE WRONG PIECE

776
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
OF CONCRETE OR ONE PIECE OF

777
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
TIMBER MOVES AND MORE OF THE

778
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
BUILDING CAN COME DOWN

779
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE

780
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
RESCUE WORKERS.

781
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
IT'S A TENSE, DIFFICULT

782
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OPERATION, SHEP.
>> Shepard: JONATHAN HUNT IN

783
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
MEXICO CITY.

784
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
LIVE REPORTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

785
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
BACK TO CONTINUING COVERAGE OF

786
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
HURRICANE MARIA PUMMELLING

PUERTO RICO AND ST. CROIX AND

788
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
OTHERS.

789
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW DEALING

790
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
WITH ITS THIRD NATURAL DISASTER

791
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
IN LESS THAN A MONTH.

792
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPROVED AN

793
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR PUERTO

794
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

795
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THE MONSTER STORM COULD COST

796
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
BILLIONS IN DAMAGE ACROSS THE

797
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
CARIBBEAN.
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DEVASTATION

798
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
THAT HURRICANE IRMA HAS JUST

799
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
LEFT BEHIND.

800
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
LET'S GO TO BROCK LONG NOW FROM

801
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
FEMA WHO BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP

802
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
BY PHONE ON HURRICANE MARIA.

803
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
SIR, NICE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

804
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HOW IS THE BRIEFING?

805
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
>> THE PRESIDENT REMAINS VERY

806
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
ENGAGED AND HIS MESSAGE IS TAKE

807
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
CARE OF PEOPLE.

808
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

809
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
WE KEPT 3,200 STAFF ON THE U.S.

810
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO.

811
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THAT IS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

812
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
TEAMS TO MEDICAL TEAMS TO SEARCH

813
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
AND RESCUE TEAMS.

814
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THEY'RE STARTING TO DEPLOY OUT

815
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
AS THE STORM -- ELEMENTS OF THE

816
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
STORM PASS THROUGH.

817
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
AND THEN WE'RE PREPARED TO OPEN

818
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
UP AIRPORTS AND THE SHIPPING

819
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
PORTS TO CONTINUE WITH MORE

820
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TEAMS AND COMMODITIES COMING IN

821
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
UP.
>> Shepard: WHAT KIND OF REPORTS

822
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GETTING

823
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
FROM THE TEAMS FANNING OUT?

824
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
>> SO IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AS

825
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THE SYSTEM PASSED TO THE SOUTH

826
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
OF THE ISLANDS LAST NIGHT, THE

827
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
WINDS EXPANDED AND THEY

828
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
BASICALLY -- THEY HAD UP TO

829
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
ABOUT 137 MILES PER HOUR WINDS.

830
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOF

831
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
DAMAGE.
THEY DO HAVE DAMAGE TO THEIR

832
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

833
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THE POWER IS OFF.

834
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THEY EXPERIENCED SOME DAMAGE TO

835
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
HOSPITALS, WHICH WERE ALREADY

836
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO

837
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS.

838
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
PUERTO RICO UNFORTUNATELY,

839
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THEY'RE UNDER FLASH FLOOD

840
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
WARNINGS IN THE COMMONWEALTH.

841
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THEY HAVE 100% OF THE POWER OFF.

842
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO

843
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
HAVE FRAGILE POWER SYSTEMS.

844
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THE GOAL IS LIFE SAFETY, LIFE

845
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
SUSTAINING MISSIONS BY GETTING

846
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
COMMODITIES IN.

POWER TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

849
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
GET IT BACK UP AND TRY TO

850
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
RESTORE ROUTINE.

851
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000

DEPARTMENT IS DEALING WITH, IT'S

854
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
HARD TO FATHOM HOW DIFFICULT IT

855
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
MUST BE TO GET THROUGH THIS.

856
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
YOU HAVE TO BE STRETCHED THIN

857
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
RIGHT NOW.

858
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> YEAH.

859
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I WOULDN'T SAY WE'RE STRETCHED

860
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
THIN.

861
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
THESE GUYS BACK HERE ARE

862
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
INCREDIBLY DEDICATED.

THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR 30 DAYS

864
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
AT THIS POINT.

865
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
WE'LL CONTINUE TO MEET THE

866
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
DEMANDS.
WE SIGNED UP FOR THIS JOB AND

867
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
DEDICATED TO HELPING THE

868
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
GOVERNORS ACHIEVE THEIR RESPONSE

869
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
GOALS AND HELP PEOPLE.

870
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
>> Shepard: FOR PEOPLE AT HOME

871
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
SAYING I WANT TO HELP BUT NOT

872
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
SURE HOW TO DO IT, WHAT DO YOU

873
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
TELL THEM?

874
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
>> RIGHT NOW THE BEST WAY IS TO

875
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
GO TO NVOAD.ORG.

876
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000

VOLUNTEER AND DONATE.

879
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THEN ONCE WE WORK WITH THE

880
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
GOVERNORS, THERE WILL BE OTHER

881
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT

882
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
VOLUNTEER AND DONATIONS TO EACH

883
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
ONE OF THE TERRITORIES.

884
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
>> Shepard: WE'RE WITH YOU.

885
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

886
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BROCK LONG.

887
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
TALK TO YOU SOON.

888
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

889
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
HE THINKS HE HAS A GOOD SHOT AT

890
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
BROKERING PEACE IN THE MIDDLE

891
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
EAST.
THE PRESIDENT MET WITH THE

892
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
PALESTINIAN LEADER TODAY.

893
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE MADE UP

894
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
HIS MIND ABOUT THE IRAN NUCLEAR

895
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
DEAL ONE DAY AFTER CALLING IT AN

896
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
EMBARRASSMENT.

897
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
SO WHAT IS THE DECISION?

898
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
BY THE WAY, THE IRANIAN

899
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
PRESIDENT HAS SHOT BACK.
THAT IS NEXT.

900
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I work
overtime when
I can get it.

901
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I need
my blood sugar

902
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
to stay
in control.

903
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So I asked
about Tresiba®.

904
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
♪ Tresiba® ready ♪

905
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Tresiba®
is a once-daily,

906
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
long-acting
insulin

907
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
that lasts even
longer than
24 hours.

908
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I need to cut my A1C.

909
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
♪ Tresiba® ready ♪

910
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Tresiba® works
like my body's insulin.

911
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Releases slow
and steady.

912
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Providing
powerful
A1C reduction.

913
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
My week?
Hectic.

914
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
My weekends?
My time.

915
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
♪ Tresiba® ready ♪

916
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I can take Tresiba®
any time of day.

917
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
So if I sleep in,
and delay my dose,

918
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I take it as soon as I can,

919
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
as long as there's at least
8 hours between doses.

920
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Once in use,
Tresiba® lasts

921
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
with or without
refrigeration,

922
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
twice as long
as the Lantus® Pen.

923
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
(announcer)
Tresiba® is used

924
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
to control high blood sugar
in adults with diabetes.

925
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Don't use Tresiba® to treat
diabetic ketoacidosis,

926
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
during
episodes of low blood sugar,

927
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
or if you are allergic
to any of its ingredients.

928
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Don't share needles
or insulin pens.

929
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Don't reuse needles.

930
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

931
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
which may cause dizziness,
sweating, confusion
and headache.

932
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Check your blood sugar.

933
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Low blood sugar can be serious
and may be life-threatening.

934
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Injection site reactions
may occur.

935
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Tell your prescriber
about all medicines you take

936
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and all your medical conditions.

937
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Taking TZDs with insulins
like Tresiba®

938
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
may cause serious side
effects like heart failure.

939
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Your insulin dose shouldn't
be changed

940
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
without
asking your prescriber.

941
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Get medical help right away
if you have trouble breathing,

942
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
fast heartbeat,
extreme drowsiness,

943
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
swelling of your face,
tongue or throat,

944
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
dizziness or confusion.

945
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Ask your health care provider
if you're Tresiba® ready.

946
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Covered by most insurance

947

UNITED STATES OUT OF THE

983
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
HISTORIC NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.

984
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT DECISION

985
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
IS HIS TO KNOW FOR NOW.

986
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000

SHOT BACK.

1000
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000

1001
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
DISAGREEMENT IN THE WORLD OF

1002
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
POLITICS.

1003
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
THE WORLD WILL HAVE LOST A GREAT

OPPORTUNITY.

1005
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
BUT SUCH UNFORTUNATE BEHAVIOR

1006
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
WILL NEVER IMPEDE IRAN'S COURSE

1007
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000

CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS IS

DEAL BE REOPENED.

1019
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,000
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF SIX

1020
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
SIGNATORS TO THE DEAL.

1021
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
IF YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER DEAL,

1022
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
IS THE PRESIDENT BETTER TO PULL

1023
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
OUT.
AS A CANDIDATE, THE PRESIDENT

1024
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
SAID HE WAS GOING TO SCRAP THE

1025
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
DEAL.
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS

1026
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
RECERTIFIED THAT IRAN IS

1027
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
COMPLYING WITH THE DEAL AS

1028
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
ANOTHER DEADLINE COMES UP AS

1029
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
SOME ARE SAYING THE PRESIDENT

1030
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
WILL CONSIDER THE DECISION.

1031
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
THE WHITE HOUSE'S VIEW OF THE

1032
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
DEAL, IT ONLY DEALS WITH IRAN

1033
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
AND THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND

1034
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SUPPORT

1035
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
FOR TERROR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

1036
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
YESTERDAY HE SAID AT THE U.N.,

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
THE IRANIAN RESPOND TODAY BY

1038
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
SAYING THE FOLLOWING.

1039
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
>> IGNORANT, ABSURD AND HATEFUL

1040
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
RHETORIC FILLED WITH

1041
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
RIDICULOUSLY BASELESS

1042
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
ALLEGATIONS.
>> ABSURD HATEFUL RHETORIC.

1043
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
WE REPORT, YOU DECIDE.

1044
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN SOME

1045
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
OTHER STEPS WITH REGARDS TO IRAN

1046
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME WORK OF THE

1047
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT UNILATERALLY

1048
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
IMPOSED SANCTIONS.

1049
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
IF HE DECIDED TO STAY IN THE

1050
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THE WHITE

1051
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
HOUSE COULD TAKE MORE STEPS TO

1052
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
REIGN IN IRAN'S BAD BEHAVIOR.

1053
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

1054
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
>> AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THE

1055
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
MIDEAST PEACE DEAL.

1056
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
>> THE PRESIDENT MET WITH

1057
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
MAHMOUD ABBAS AND THE KING OF

1058
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
JORDAN.
HE MET WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME

1059
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
MINISTER.

1060
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS A LOT INVESTED

1061
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
IN THIS.

1062
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
HIS SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER IS

1063
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
THE POINT PERSON ON THIS.

1064
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THEY HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF

1065
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
VISITS TO THE REGION.

1066
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY.

1067
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
THE PRESIDENT HOLDING OUT HOPE

1068
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
THAT SOMETHING MAY BE POSSIBLE.

1069
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID THIS

1070
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
MORNING.
>> WE'RE AT A VERY IMPORTANT

1071
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
JUNCTURE.
A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE

1072
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
GOING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

1073
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

1074
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
IT AND IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.

1075
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
WE'RE FIGHTING VERY HARD.

1076
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
>> HE'S OPTIMISTIC.

1077
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
SHOULD WE GO THROUGH THE LIST OF

1078
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
PRESIDENTS THAT WERE HOPEFUL AND

1079
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
CAME AWAY WITH NOTHING.

1080
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
>> Shepard: IT'S A LONG ONE.

1081
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
>> IT IS.

1082
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
>> Shepard: MICHAEL CROWLEY FROM

1083
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
POLITCO.

1084
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL.

1085
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, SHEP.

1086
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
>> Shepard: WHAT IS THE

1087
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
REPORTING WHERE WE ARE IN THIS.

1088
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
PULLING OUT HAS ENORMOUS

1089
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
CHALLENGES.

1090
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SOME CRITICS OF THE DEAL, SOME

1091
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
THAT OPPOSED IT AT THE TIME THAT

1092
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
IT WAS SEALED WITH SEVERAL

1093
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
COUNTRIES AS JOHN POINTED OUT,

1094
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
EVEN SOME OPPONENTS OF DOING

1095
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
THAT NOW SAY IT'S TOO LATE.

1096
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
THE COST OF UNDOING THIS DEAL

1097
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
ARE MUCH GREATER THAN TO OPPOSED

1098
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
THE DEAL.

1099
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
IRAN GOT A LOT OF FINANCIAL

1100
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
BENEFITS.
AS SOON AS THE DEAL WAS STRUCK

1101
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
IN JULY 2015, IRAN GOT BILLIONS

1102
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
OF IMMEDIATE PAY-OFF.

1103
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CLAW THAT

1104
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
BACK.

1105
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
IN FACT, CIA DIRECTOR MIKE

1106
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:24,000
POMPEO SPOKE TO BRET BAIER.

1107
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
BRET SAID YOU WERE A STRONG

1108
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
CRITIC.

1109
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
AND POMPEO SAID THINGS LOOK

1110
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
DIFFERENT NOW BEING ON THE OTHER

1111
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
SIDE OF THE DESK AND THE

1112
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED.

1113
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
THE DEAL IS SIGNED.

1114
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
IRAN GOT THE BENEFITS.

1115
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
THOSE THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE DEAL

1116
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
ARE CAUTIOUS ABOUT BLOWING IT UP

1117
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
RIGHT NOW.
>> Shepard: WILL THERE REAL

1118
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
INDICATORS THAT THEY'RE CHEATING

1119
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
OR IS THE CONSENSUS THAT THINGS

1120
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
ARE GOING AS WELL AS COULD BE

1121
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
EXPECTED?

1122
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
>> YOU KNOW, I GUESS WHAT YOUR

1123
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
DEFINITION OF CHEATING IS.

1124
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
THE INTERNATIONAL A COMIC ENERGY

1125
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
AGENCY INSPECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN

1126
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
GOING TO IRAN AND HAVE THIS VERY

1127
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
SPECIFIC CHECKLIST OF TECHNICAL

1128
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
METRICS SAY THAT IRAN IS NOT

1129
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
CHEATING.
THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE.

1130
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT IRAN GOT

1131
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
A LITTLE ABOVE THE AMOUNT OF

1132
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
HEAVY WATER THEY WERE SUPPOSED

1133
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
TO HAVE ON HAND.

1134
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
IF YOU TALK THE PEOPLE THAT

1135
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
ARE -- FOLLOW THIS CLOSELY, THEY

1136
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
SAY IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

1137
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
THE IAEA SAYS THEY'RE IN

1138
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
COMPLIANCE.
THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TRUMP

1139
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS,

1140
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
CONSERVATIVE, ISRAELI OFFICIALS

1141
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
SAY IT'S THE WRONG WAY TO THINK

1142
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
ABOUT IT.
THAT IT'S BROADER THAN THIS.

1143
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
IRANIAN BEHAVIOR YOU HAVE TO

1144
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
LOOK AT.

1145
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
ARE THEY BECOMING MORE OF A

1146
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
CIVILIZED NATION THAT OBEYS THE

1147
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
SORT OF RULES OF THE ROAD

1148
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
INTERNATIONALLY.

1149
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.

1150
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
THE DEAL SORT OF OBLIGATED IRAN

1151
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
TO BEHAVE BETTER IN THEIR

1152
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEREFORE

1153
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
THEY'RE NOT HONORING WHAT SOME

1154
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
TRUMP OFFICIALS HAVE CALLED THE

1155
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
SPIRIT OF THE DEAL.

1156
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
THE FRIENDS THAT SERVED UNDER

1157
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE DEAL

1158
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRANIAN

1159
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
BEHAVIOR, THE METRICS, THE

1160
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
RESEARCH, THE URANIUM ON HAND.

1161
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
THAT'S THE OPINION RIGHT NOW.

1162
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
>> MICHAEL CROWLEY FORE POLITCO.

1163
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
THANK YOU.
>> THANKS, SHEP.

1164
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
>> Shepard: THE TOP REPUBLICAN
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SAYS

1165
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
HE PLANS TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE

1166
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
LATEST GOP HEALTHCARE PLAN.

1167
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
BUT HE CAN LOSE ONLY ONE MORE

1168
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
REPUBLICAN VOTE AND STILL PASS

1169
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
THE BILL.

1170
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
TODAY THE FORMER PRESIDENT

1171
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
BARACK OBAMA WEIGHED IN ON THIS

1172
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
MATTER.

1173
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
ON THE BATTLE OVER HIS OWN

1174
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
HEALTHCARE LAW.
WE'LL GO LIVE TO CAPITOL HILL

1175
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WATCH IN

1176
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
MEXICO CITY WHERE THE SEARCH IS

1177
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
ON FOR SURVIVORS A DAY AFTER THE

1178
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
QUAKE HIT WITH SO MANY WONDERING

1179
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
WITH BUILDINGS COLLAPSED ALL

1180
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
OVER THE COUNTRY, HOW HIGH THE

1181
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
DEATH TOLL MAY BE.

1182
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
stimate.

1183
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I just snapped a photo

1184
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and got an estimate in 24 hours.

1185
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
My insurance company

1186
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
definitely doesn't have that...

1187
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
You can leave worry behind when

1188
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Liberty Stands With You™

1189
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Liberty Mutual Insurance.

1190
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
But Prevagen helps your brain
with an ingredient

1191
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
originally discovered...

1192
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
in jellyfish.

1193
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
In clinical trials,
Prevagen has been shown

1194
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
to improve short-term memory.

1195
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Prevagen. The name to remember.

1196
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
>> Shepard: THE SENATE MAJORITY

1197
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
LEADER MITCH McCONNELL INTENDS

1198
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
TO BREAK THE LATEST GOP

1199
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
HEALTHCARE BILL TO THE SENATE

1200
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
FLOOR TO A VOTE NEXT WEEK.

1201
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
THAT'S THE WORD FROM HIS

1202
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
SPOKESMAN.
WHEN RAND PAUL ALREADY PLEDGING

1203
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
TO VOTE NO AND WITH NO SUPPORT

1204
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
FROM DEMOCRATS AT ALL, THE GOP

1205
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
CAN AFFORD TO LOSE BY ONE MORE

1206
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
VOTE.
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE

1207
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
FENCE.

1208
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
THE CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL

1209
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
CORRESPONDENT MIKE EMANUEL WITH

1210
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
THE NEWS.

1211
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
HI, MIKE.

1212
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
>> PLANS TO VOTE NEXT WEEK ARE

1213
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
DESIGNED TO TURN UP THE PRESSURE

1214
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
ON UNDECIDED REPUBLICANS.

1215
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
>> IT'S BEEN THE MOST FUN THING

1216
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I'VE WORKED ON, THE MOST

1217
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
CHALLENGING THING I'VE WORKED ON

1218
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
AND WE'RE A POINT TO TAKE THE

1219
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
BILL UP NEXT WEEK.

1220
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF

1221
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA, NOW IS

1222
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
THE TIME.

1223
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
>> YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT UP

1224
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
NEXT WEEK?

1225
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE GOING TO THE FLOOR WITH A

1226
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
REPEAL AND REPLACE PROPOSAL THAT

1227
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
IS FEDERALISM.
EVERYBODY GETS TO LOOK AT IT,

1228
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
STUDY IT.

1229
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
>> A LOT OF FOCUS ON THREE

1230
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
REPUBLICAN SENATORS THAT KILLED

1231
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
HEALTHCARE REFORM IN JULY.

1232
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
SUSAN COLLINS, JOHN McCAIN AND

1233
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
ALASKA'S LISA MURKOWSKI.

1234
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
>> THE INITIAL ANALYSIS ON THE

1235
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
IMPACT OF THE STATE OF MAINE OF

1236
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
THEIR BILL IS THAT IT WOULD

1237
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
RESULT TO MAINE RECEIVING A

1238
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
BILLION DOLLARS LESS IN FEDERAL

1239
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
FUNDING FOR HEALTHCARE OVER THE

1240
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
NEXT DECADE.

1241
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
>> MEETINGS CONTINUE ON CAPITOL

1242
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
HILL TRYING TO ADDRESS THE

1243
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
CONCERNS OF GOP SENATORS

1244
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
SCHLEPP?
>> Shepard: THERE WAS A

1245
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO TRY TO

1246
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
IMPROVE OBAMACARE.

1247
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?

1248
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
>> IT FELL APART LAST NIGHT.

1249
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
YOU HAD SENATOR LAMAR ALEXANDER

1250
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
AND PATTY MURRAY TRYING TO WORK

1251
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
ON A BIPARTISAN FIX BY THE END

1252
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
OF THE MONTH.

1253
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
TOP DEMOCRATS ARE EXPRESSING

1254
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
DISAPPOINTMENT.

1255
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

1256
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
WE HAD A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING

1257
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
IMPORTANT, HISTORIC, BIPARTISAN

1258
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
THAT WOULD HAVE BUILT ON THE

1259
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

1260
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
IN THIS COUNTRY.

1261
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
NOW WE'RE MOVING TO ANOTHER

1262
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
PARTISAN APPROACH.
NO CBO SCORE, NO HEARINGS.

1263
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
GETTING READY TO REPEAT WHAT WE

1264
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
DID A FEW MONTHS AGO.

1265
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
>> FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA

1266
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WEIGHED IN THIS AFTERNOON

CALLING THE LATEST ATTEMPT TO

SCRAP OBAMACARE AGGRAVATING.

1269
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
>> ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE

1270
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
WITHOUT ANY ECONOMIC OR

1271
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
ACTIONARY OR PLAIN COMMON SENSE

1272
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
RATIONALE.
IT FRUSTRATES.

1273
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
IT'S CERTAINLY FRUSTRATING TO

1274
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
HAVE TO MOBILIZE EVERY COUPLE

1275
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
MONTHS TO KEEP OUR LEADERS FROM

1276
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
INFLICTING REAL HUMAN SUFFERING

1277
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
ON OUR CONSTITUENTS.

1278
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
>> IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR IF

1279
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
REPUBLICANS WILL GET TO 50 YES

1280
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000

If yand constipation,ling
and you're overwhelmed

1294
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
by everything you've tried--

1295
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
all those laxatives,
daily probiotics,

1296
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
endless fiber--
it could be wearing on you.

1297
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Tell your doctor
what you've tried,

1298
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and how long you've been at it.

1299
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
LINZESS works differently
from laxatives.

1300
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
LINZESS treats adults
with IBS

1301
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
with Constipation
or Chronic Constipation.

1302
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It can help relieve
your belly pain

1303
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
and lets you have more frequent
and complete bowel movements

1304
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
that are easier to pass.

1305
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Do not give LINZESS
to children less than six

1306
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
and it should not be given
to children

1307
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
six to less than eighteen.
It may harm them.

1308
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Don't take LINZESS
if you have a bowel blockage.

1309
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Get immediate help
if you develop

1310
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
unusual or severe
stomach pain,

1311
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
especially with
bloody or black stools.

1312
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
The most common side effect
is diarrhea, sometimes severe.

1313
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
If it's severe,
stop taking LINZESS

1314
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
and call your doctor
right away.

1315
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Other side effects
include gas,

1316
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
stomach-area pain
and swelling.

1317
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Talk to your doctor about

1318
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
managing your symptoms

1319
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
