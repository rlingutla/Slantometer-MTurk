ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GET

570
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000

THE BAN WAS LIFTED ON

571
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
PEOPLE HAVING TO STAY

572
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000

573
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
TALKING TO A FEW NEIGHBORS.

574
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I WAS JUST ACTUALLY DOING

575
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000

576
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000

580
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
NOT MORE GUNSHOTS GO OFF.

581
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
WE STOPPED, WE RAN OVER

582
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
HERE, WE SAW POLICE

583
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
FLOODING THE SCENE.

584
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A LOT OF MOVEMENT.

585
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
WE SEEN A CONSTANT STREAM

586
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
OF POLICE CARS WITH THEIR

587
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
SIRENS ON, RUSHING TOWARDS

588
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE

589
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
SITE, ABOUT A MILE WEST OF

590
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
US.
WE'RE KIND OF BEING HELD IN

591
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
PLACE RIGHT NOW.

592
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

593
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
WE ARE ON LOCKDOWN.

594
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE

595
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
THERE.

596
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
>> Shepard: CHRIS, BOSTON

598
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
OF ALERT AS WELL.

599
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
THE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT

600
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
HERE IN BOSTON PROPER HAS

601
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
SENT OUT A TWEET ASKING ALL

602
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
BOSTON RESIDENTS TO SHELTER

603
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
IN PLACE AS THEY ASK THEM

604
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000

605
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
AND, FRANKLY THEY

606
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
RESPECTED THAT REQUEST AND

607
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
DID SO.

608
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
CAN YOU TELL BY WANDERING

609
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000

611
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIVES.

612
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
IT'S THE BELIEF AT THIS
MOMENT THAT SUSPECT NUMBER

613
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
2 IN THE BOSTON MARATHON

614
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
BOMBING IS DOWN ON FRANKLIN

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
STREET IN WATERTOWN

616
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
MASSACHUSETTS.
THAT IS NOT YET CONFIRMED

617
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000

621
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM

622
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
POLICE AS THEY MOVE IN WITH

623
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
THAT ROBOT.
GO BACK TO WATERTOWN AND

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
THAT SHOTS HAD BEEN FIRED.

628
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
SUSPECT WAS DOWN.

629
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
HERE AGAIN WE SEE MORE

630
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
PEOPLE RUNNING DOWN THE

631
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
STREET.
FAMILIES WERE EVACUATING

632
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
EARLIER RUNNING AT A GOOD

633
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
CLIP.

634
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
HE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE

635
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
TO MOVE THEM TOO FAST.

636
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
THEY WEREN'T RUNNING.

637
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
NOW YOU ARE SEEING MEMBERS
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT ARE

638
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
PICKING UP THE PACE A BIT.

639
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THE SCENE IS BECOMING A

640
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
LITTLE BIT MORE ACTIVE DOWN

641
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
THERE TOWARDS THE END.

642
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
WE DID SEE HEAVILY ARMED

643
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
OFFICERS WITH GUNS DRAWN.

644
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
GOING AROUND THE BASE --

645
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
YOU SEE THE WINDOWS DOWN

646
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THERE WITH THE WHITE

647
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
SHUTTERS, THEY WERE WALKING

648
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
AROUND THE FRONT OF THAT

649
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
HOME.
BUT NOW WE SEE SOME PEOPLE

650
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
MERELY WALKING UP TO IT AT

651
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
THIS POINT.

652
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
BUT, AGAIN VERY FLUID

653
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SCENE IN WATER TOWN.

654
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US,

655
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
REPORTS THAT ABOUT 20

656
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
MINUTES AGO SHOTS FIRED

657
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
AFTER THINGS HAD KIND OF

658
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
CALMED DOWN A BIT AND THE

659
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
PRESS CONFERENCE SAID, YOU

660
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000

661
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
LOCKDOWN ON THE TOWN AND

662
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
WILL INCREASE OUR PRESENCE

663
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
AS FAR AS SECURITY GOES BUT

664
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
TO GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS

665
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
AND BE VIGILANT, NOW

666
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
EVERYBODY WAS AT THAT PRESS

667
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
CONFERENCE IS ON FRANKLIN

668
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
STREET.

669
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

670
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
IT REALLY GOT QUIET AFTER

671
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE.

672
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
THERE WAS THIS THOUGHT OF,

673
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
YOU KNOW, WE ARE DONE FOR

674
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
THE NIGHT AND YOU KNEW THAT

675
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THEY WERE GOING TO WORK

676
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
HARD THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT

677
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
WE FELT LIKE THINGS HAD

678
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
QUIETED DOWN.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

679
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SCENE, IT'S A WHOLE ANOTHER

680
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
STORY AND IT'S JUST CRAZY

681
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
HOW THINGS CAN CHANGE IN A

682
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
MATTER OF A SECOND.

683
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
LOOK AT THE SCENE.

684
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
WE HAVE GOT THE STATE

685
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
POLICE AND EVERYONE BACK AT
THE SCENE ON FRANKLIN

686
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
STREET IN WATERTOWN WHERE

687
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
NOT FAR FROM THE WATERTOWN

688
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
MALL.

689
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
PROBABLY A MILE OR LESS.
THIS IS IN A POPULATED

690
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
AREA.
LOTS OF HOMES AND WE JUST

691
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
SAW MOMENTS AGO FAMILIES

692
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
RUNNING OUT IN TERROR AFTER

693
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THEY HEARD 20 TO 30 SHOTS

694
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
FIRED IN THEIR

695
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> OKAY.

696
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I WANT TO GO TO THE PHONE

697
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
NOW.
WE HAVE MARY SULLIVAN,

698
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
RESIDENT OF WATERTOWN AND

699
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
MARY, IT'S MARK ALONG WITH

700
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000

I UNDERSTAND YOU WITNESSED

702
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WHAT WENT DOWN ON FRANKLIN

703
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
STREET EARLIER.

704
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
TELL US ABOUT IT.

705
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
>> YES.

706
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WE WERE -- THE GOVERNOR HAD

707
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
JUST SAID THERE WAS A LIFT.

708
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
AND SO WE KIND OF HOOKED UP

709
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
OUR DOG AND MY 20-YEAR-OLD

710
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
CHILDREN AND MY SON'S

711
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
GIRLFRIEND WAS WITH US AND

712
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
WE WERE COMING DOWN RUSSELL

713
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
AVE AND WE WERE READY TO

714
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
GET TO THE END OF RUSSELL

715
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
AVE TALKING TO A STUDENT

716
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU

717
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
HEARD THIS SERIES OF

718
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
GUNSHOTS.

719
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
AND AS HE WE RAN ACROSS

720
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
RUSSELL TO THE CORNER OF

721
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
RUSSELL -- ALL THESE CARS

722
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
AND POLICE CARS AND HUMVEES

723
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
AND POLICE AND EVERYONE

724
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
JUST STARTED TO RUN DOWN TO

725
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
FRANKLIN STREET, WHICH IS A

726
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
VERY RESIDENTIAL AREA AND

727
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
SO WE JUST STARTED FILMING

728
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
AND THE GUN -- IT WAS JUST

729
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
LIKE A VERY QUICK LIKE

730
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
ALMOST 30 SECONDS OF

731
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
GUNSHOTS.

732
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THEN 2 STOPPED AND THEN

733
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THEY JUST SHUT THE ROADS

734
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
DOWN AND THEN EVERYONE IS

735
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
HERE.
LIKE THERE IS AMBULANCES

736
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
AND NEIGHBORS AND IT WAS

737
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
JUST CRAZY BECAUSE THE

738
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
WHOLE SERIES HAS BEEN UP IN

739
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THE EAST END AND THIS IS

740
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM

741
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
WHERE WE LIVE.

742
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
WE JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

743
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
WE WOULD GO WALK THE DOG.

744
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
YOU KNOW, WE FELT SAFE AND

745
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE

746
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
HEAR ALL THIS GUNSHOT IN

747
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

748
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY

749
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
HAVE GOTTEN SOMEONE BUT IT

750
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
SEEMS THAT SOMETHING BIG

751
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
HAPPENED HERE.
>> SURE, WHAT EXACTLY DID

752
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
YOU SEE THOUGH IN TERMS OF

753
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOW

754
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000

944
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
HOURS, HOW NERVOUS THEY

945
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WERE GOING THROUGH ANOTHER

946
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
NIGHT NOT KNOWING IF THE

947
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SUSPECT WAS CAUGHT OR

948
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
KNOWING THAT HE WASN'T

949
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
CAUGHT.

950
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE

951
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
HEARD GUNSHOTS.

952
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
WE CAME BACK OVER TO OUR

953
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
CAMERA POSITION, COP

954
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
STARTED SCREAMING DOWN THE

955
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
STREET TOWARDS THE SOUND OF

956
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THE GUNSHOTS.

957
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
THERE IS A LOT OF ACTIVITY.

958
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
WE'RE STUCK HERE RIGHT NOW.

959
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
POLICE HAVE LOCKED DOWN THE

960
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
AREA.
IT SEEMS LIKE RESIDENTS ARE

961
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
CURIOSITY IS GETTING THE

962
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
BETTER OFTHEY ARE COMING OUT OF

963
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THEIR HOMES TO TAKE A LOOK

964
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I CAN SEE A COUPLE BLOCKS THERE IS

965
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
A GROUP OF

966
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THEM FORMING.

967
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
POLICE ARE KEEPING THEM OFF
TO THE SIDE ON THE SIDE OF

968
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
THE ROAD.

969
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
BUT IT IS A FLUID SITUATION

970
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
HERE TO SAY THE LEAST.

971
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
WITHOUT DOUBT, CHRIS.

972
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
LOOKING AT THE VIDEO I CAN TELL FROM

973
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
WATCHING THROUGHOUT THE DAY

974
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
THE MEANING OF ALL THOSE ON

975
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
SCENE IN WATER TOWN IS

976
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN

977
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE

978
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
EARLY MORNING HOURS TOY

979
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
WHEN ALL OF THIS BEGAN.

980
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
ONCE THE SUN C
WAS A VERY TENSE PLACE.

981
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
IT LOOKED LIKE AN ARMED

982
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
CITY AT WAR.

983
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
THERE WERE MILITARY

984
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
VEHICLES AND SWAT IN FULL

985
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
BODY ARMOR.

986
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
AND REALLY THE CITY HAD

987
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
BEEN LOCKED DOWN TO A

988
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
DEGREE THAT BOSTON HAS

989
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
NEVER EXPERIENCED IN ITS

990
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
LONG AND STORIC HISTORY.

991
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
BECAUSETONIANS RESPONDED

992
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
WELL ESPECIALLY THERE IN

993
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
WATER TOWN.

994
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
WE ARE GETTING BACKGROUND

995
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
INFORMATION OF GREAT

996
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
INTEREST TO ME.
WE HAVE JUST GOTTEN THIS

997
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
FROM A SOURCE AT THE FBI.

998
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THIS IS FROM OUR JUSTICE

999
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
PRODUCER MICHAEL LAVIGNE.

1000
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'M JUST GOING TO QUOTE

1001
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THIS FOR YOU.

1002
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
TWO YEARS AGO AN UNNAMED

1003
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ASKED

1004
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
THE FBI TO CHECK OUT THE

1005
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
OLDER OF THESE TWO

1006
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
BROTHERS.
THE BROTHER WHO DIED LAST

1007
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
NIGHT IN A SHOOTOUT WITH

1008
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
POLICE BECAUSE THAT FOREIGN

1009
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
GOVERNMENT, NOT THE U.S.

1010
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
GOVERNMENT, IT NOTES HERE,

1011
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
HAD CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE

1012
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
EXTREMIST TIES.

1013
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
TWO YEARS AGO WITH A MAN

1014
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
WHO DIED OVERNIGHT.

1015
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THE FBI FULLY SCRUBBED THIS

1016
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
INDIVIDUAL SCRUBBED

1017
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
MEANING THEY CHECKED OUT

1018
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM AND
THEN EVENTUALLY WENT --

1019
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
ENDED UP TALKING TO HIM

1020
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
QUOTING NOW:  WE DID NOT

1021
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
FIND ANYTHING, THE OFFICIAL

1022
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
SAYS.
THE FBI REPORTED BACK TO

1023
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT

1024
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
IT FOUND NOTHING BUT TOLD

1025
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO

1026
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
FOLLOW UP IF THEY HAD ANY

1027
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
MORE CONCERNS.
AND THAT FOREIGN

1028
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
GOVERNMENT, WHATEVER
GOVERNMENT IT IS, AND MOST

1029
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
LIKELY WE WILL LEARN THAT

1030
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
WITHIN THE HOURS OR DAYS

1031
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
AHEAD, THE FOREIGN

1032
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
GOVERNMENT NEVER FOLLOWED

1033
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
UP, QUOTE, IN ANY WAY

1034
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
SHAPE, OR FORM.

1035
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
AGAIN, THAT'S FROM A SOURCE

1036
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
CLOSE TO THE FBI.

1037
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
FAST FORWARD NOW TO JUST A

1038
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
FEW MINUTES BEFORE 7:00

1039
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
TONIGHT IN WATERTOWN

1040
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
MASSACHUSETTS WHERE SHOTS

1041
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
RANG OUT.
NOW THERE IS A ROBOT GOING

1042
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
IN IT'S OUR STANDING TO

1043
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE

1044
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
ANY BOMBS THERE.

1045
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
A ROBOT WITH CAMERA SO

1046
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
AUTHORITIES ON SCENE CAN

1047
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
LOOK AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES

1048
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
WHETHER THIS MAN WHO IS

1049
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
DOWN IN THE STREET IN THE

1050
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
CITY THERE IN A RESIDENTIAL

1051
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
NEIGHBORHOOD MAY HAVE LEFT

1052
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES

1053
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
BEHIND.
AND AT SOME POINT, IN THE

1054
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
NEAR TERM, WE EXPECT TO

1055
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
HEAR FROM POLICE ABOUT WHAT

1056
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
HAS JUST HAPPENED AND

1057
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

1058
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
BOSTON AND THE UNITED

1059
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
STATES' NIGHTMARE IS AT

1060
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
LEAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE

1061
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
AT LEASE -- LEAST THIS

1062
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
STAGE OF IT.

1063
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
WFXT FOR BOSTON HAS BEEN

1064
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
COVERING THIS 24 HOURS A

1065
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
DAY AND IS LIVE ON SCENE

1066
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
NOW WITH THE FIRST

1067
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
REPORTER, TO MY KNOWLEDGE

1068
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
WHO WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM

1069
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THAT INDEED A SUSPECT WAS

1070
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
DOWN AND SHE CITED LOCAL

1071
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
POLICE SOURCES FOR THAT.

1072
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
LET'S LISTEN IN.

1073
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
>> WE NEED TO BE A NORMAL

1074
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
CITY AGAIN.

1075
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
EVERYBODY STARTED COMING

1076
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
OUT.
YOU COULD SEE EVERYBODY

1077
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
HANGING OUT ON THE PORCH.

1078
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
>> HANG ON ONE SECOND.

1079
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
>> IT'S LIKE THE FIRST

1080
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
BREATH OF FRESH AIR THEY

1081
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
HAVE HAD IN A WHILE.

1082
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
WE JUST GOT RIGHT DOWN THE

1083
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
STREET AS WE WERE STARTING

1084
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
TO HEAD BACK.
WE SAW LAW ENFORCEMENT

1085
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
STARTING TO LEAVE AND THEN

1086
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
ALL OF THIS JUST UNFOLDED

1087
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
SO QUICK SO FAST.

1088
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
>> ALL RIGHT, JARED, HANG
ON ONE SECOND, JARED.

1089
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
WE WANT TO REASSESS THE

1090
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
SCENE HERE AND STAND BY ON

1091
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THE PHONE.
WE WANT TO SHOW THIS IS

1092
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE 67

1093
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
FRANKLIN STREET AND THERE

1094
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
WAS TALK OF SUSPECT

1095
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
POTENTIALLY HIDING IN A
BOAT AND WE GET A BETTER

1096
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
LOOK AT IT NOW AS WE PULL

1097
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THIS IMAGE IN CLOSER.

1098
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
CAN YOU SEE THAT TRAILER IN
THE BACKYARD.

1099
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
AGAIN, THERE WAS TALK THAT

1100
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
POTENTIALLY THE SUSPECT WAS

1101
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
FOUND IN THAT TRAILER.

1102
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
GUNFIRE, 20 TO 30 SHOTS WE

1103
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
HAVE HEARD.

1104
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
WE BELIEVE AGAIN THIS IS 67

1105
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
FRANKLIN STREET IN WATER

1106
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
TOWN.
AND THE SUSPECT IS DOWN.

1107
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
>> AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

1108
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
HIS CONNECTION IS TO THIS

1109
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
HOUSE.

1110
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
>> HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

1111
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
WE ARE GETTING WORD IN
RIGHT NOW FROM SOURCES AS

1112
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
WELLING.

1113
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
-- WELL.

1114
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

1115
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
SUSPECT IS ALIVE SURROUNDED

1116
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
AND STILL MOVING.

1117
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
SO THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE

1118
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
SURROUNDED BY LAW

1119
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
ENFORCEMENT, BUT STILL

1120
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
MOVING.

1121
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE

1122
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
RIGHT NOW AT 7:28 IN THE

1123
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
EVENING AS POLICE HAVE THIS

WELL.
THIS IS FRANKLIN STREET IN

1126
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
WATERTOWN.
WE HEARD 20 TO 30 SHOTS

1127
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
FIRED BY EYEWITNESS

1128
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
ESTIMATES.
AND WE BELIEVE THEY ARE AT

1129
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
67 FRANKLIN STREET.

1130
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
SOURCES TELL US THE SUSPECT

1131
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
IS ALIVE AND SURROUNDED.

1132
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
STILL MOVING.

1133
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
>> IT WAS JUST ABOUT 30

1134
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
MINUTES AGO THAT THE

1135
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
GOVERNOR LIFTED THE ORDER

1136
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
TO STAY AT HOME.

1137
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
SO SO MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT

1138
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH

1139
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
AIR AND AS SOON AS THEY

1140
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
WALKED OUTSIDE THEY HEARD

1141
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
SOME 20 TO 30 GUNSHOTS

1142
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
FIRED IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

1143
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
LOTS OF HOMES HERE AND IF

1145
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
YOU LOOK AT THIS ARROW

1146
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
BOAT IS THAT THEY BELIEVE A

1147
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
SUSPECT WAS HIDING.

1148
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
LET'S GET TO BOB WARD RIGHT

1149
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
PERSON YET.

1166
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
BOAT AND POTENTIALLY HE WAS

1239
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
UP UNDER THE CANOPY THAT

1240
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
WHERE THIS WENT DOWN JUST

1262
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
ABOUT 35 MINUTES AGO.

1263
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
SUSPECT IS ALIVE AND

1264
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
SURROUNDED AND BELIEVED TO

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
SUSPECTS IN THE BOMBING AT

1266
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
SCENE IN WATERTOWN.

1271
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
MIKE, IT'S MY STANDING THAT

1272
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
THE SCENE JUST WAS OVERRUN

1273
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
IN A MATTER OF JUST A

1274
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
COUPLE OF MINUTES.

1275
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
>> IT HAPPENED VERY

1276
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
RAPIDLY.

1277
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
AND THE SCENE WE ARE

1278
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
TALKING ABOUT GROUND ZERO
IS JUST ABOUT TWO BLOCKS IN

1279
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THAT DIRECTION SHEP.

1280
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THE WAY IT ALL WENT DOWN IS

1281
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
THAT SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER

1282
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
WAS LIFTED.

1283
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
AND AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS

1284
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
LIFTED, YOU COULD HE SEE

1285
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
THE PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE

1286
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
STREET.

1287
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
THE CABIN FEVER HAD GOTTEN

1288
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
THE BEST OF THEM.

1289
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T SEEM

1290
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
TO HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO.

1291
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
THEY WILL WANTED TO GET OUT

1292
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
OF HOUSE AND WALK AROUND.

1293
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, WE

1294
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
STARTED SEEING SOME OF THE

1295
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
POLICE VEHICLES ZOOMING UP

1296
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
IN THIS DIRECTION.

1297
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
THAT WASN'T UNCOMMON

1298
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

1299
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
YOU WOULD OFTEN TIMES SEE

1300
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
THE POLICE VEHICLES ZOOM   ING

1301
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN

1302
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
ANOTHER.

1303
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
ONE COP CAR AND ANOTHER

1304
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THREE, FOUR, THEY WERE ALL

1305
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
GOING IN THE SAME

1306
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
DIRECTION.

1307
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
PRETTY SOON YOU HAD THE

1308
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
POLICE HELICOPTER OVERHEAD

1309
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
IT BECAME APPARENT THAT

1310
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

1311
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
SO, AND THAT IS HOW IT ALL

1312

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000

1679
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
AND A GUN FIGHT IS ONGOING.

1680
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
THE OLDER OF THESE TWO

1681
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
BROTHERS, IT'S OUR STANDING

1682
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
IS SAID TO HAVE THROWN ONE

1683
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
OF THESE PRESSURE COOKER

1684
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
BOMBS OUTS AND TOWARD

1685
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
POLICE.
INSTEAD OF THE LID LOCK

1686
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
SOLID, THAT LID CAME OFF

1687
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
BEFORE IT WAS ABLE TO

1688
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
EXPLODE.
IT DID LESS DAMAGE THAN IT

1689
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE.

1690
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
IT'S FURTHER OUR STANDING

1691
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
THAT THERE WAS LARGE NUMBER

1692
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
OF POLICE OFFICERS AROUND

1693
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
THIS AREA.

1694
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
AND HAD THAT BOMB WORKED

1695
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
PROPERLY, THIS STORY WOULD

1696
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
HAVE TAKEN ITSELF TO AN

1697
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL.

1698
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THANKFULLY, IN THIS CASE,

1699
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

1700
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
WE'RE TOLD THEY HAD

1701
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
IMPROVISED GRENADES AS WELL

1702
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
AND HURLED THOSE TOWARDS

1703
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
THE VEHICLE.

1704
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
STANDOFF ENDED AND THE CAR

1705
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
CAME TO A STOP.

1706
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT THE

1707
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
OLDER OF THE PRO BROTHERS

1708
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
DIED IN WHAT WE ARE LED TO

1709
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
BELIEVE WAS A SHOOTOUT WITH

1710
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
POLICE.
AND THIS YOUNGER SUSPECT

1711
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
TOOK OFF ON FOOT.

1712
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
IT'S THE DARK OF NIGHT.

1713
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
THE WATER TOWN POLICE WILL

1714
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
TELL YOU AND THEY DID TO

1715
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
THE WORLD TODAY.

1716
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

1717
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
MANPOWER TO LOCKDOWN THIS

1718
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
OR THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY

1719
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
DID.

1720
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
BECAUSE THEY WENT

1721
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
DOOR-TO-DOOR, THEY TELL US

1722
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
EVERY HOUSE IN WATER TOWN

1723
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
FOR A 20 SQUARE BLOCK

1724
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
RADIUS SEARCHED THE ATTIC.

1725
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
EVERY FRONT PORCH HAS AN

1726
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
AREA UNDERNEATH IT AND

1727
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
THERE IS A -- PLENTY OF

1728
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
PLACES WHO HIDE THE WAY

1729
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
CONSTRUCTION IS DONE IN

1730
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
WATER TOWN BUT THEY

1731
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
SEARCHED IT ALL AND

1732
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

1733
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THEY SEARCHED THIS BOAT IN

1734
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THE BACK OF THIS HOME AT 57

1735
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
FRANKLIN STREET AS WELL.

1736
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS

1737
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
NOTHING THERE.

1738
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
BUT, THE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN

1739
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
THAT HOUSE ACCORDING TO THE

1740
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
MOST RECENT REPORTS CALLED

1741
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
UP THE POLICE AND GOES,

1742
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
HEY, YOU SEARCHED HERE BUT

1743
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW.

1744
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
THERE IS A DOOR TO THE SHED

1745
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
OPEN.
SHE WENT OUT AND LOOKED,

1746
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
THERE WERE BLOODY CLOTHES

1747
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
INSIDE THE SHED SHE

1748
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
REPORTED TO POLICE.
AND THERE WAS BLOOD ON THE

1749
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
FLOOR.

1750
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
SO POLICE CAME BACK.

1751
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
AND IT'S OUR STANDING THAT

1752
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
THEY SEARCHED THE AREA.

1753
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
THERE IS SOME REPORTS NOW

1754
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000

1758
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000

WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE

1782
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
HAS BEEN IN THAT BOAT IF

00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
IT'S BEEN ALL DAY SINCE

THIS MORNING WHEN HE

1785
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
ESCAPED THE GUN FIGHT.

1786
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE IS

TELLING US THAT THE ROBOT

1800
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000

1810
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

1811
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT PUTTING A

1812
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
HUMAN LIFE IN HARM'S WAY.

1813
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000

DELICATE SITUATION.

1828
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
THEY WANT TO BRING THIS

1829
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
ROBOT IN TO THE BOAT TO

1830
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO

1831
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000

1837
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
INVESTIGATION.

1838
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO

1839
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
ANYTHING THAT WOULD

1840
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
NECESSITATE HIM POTENTIALLY

1841
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
TAKING HIS OWN LIFE IN THIS

1842
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
SITUATION.
HE IS FROM A DIRE SITUATION

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
GO AT THIS POINT.

1848
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
YOU THINK ABOUT THE DRAGNET

1849
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000

A BACKYARD, 67 FRANKLIN

1858
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
STREET IN WATER TOWN.

1859
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
A BOAT, INSIDE THE BOAT THE

1860
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
SUSPECT.

00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
AND THIS ALL HAPPENING IN

2047
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
THE BACKYARD AT 67 FRANKLIN

2048
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
STREET WHERE WE BELIEVE

2049
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
SUSPECT 2 IS HOLD UP IN
THIS BOAT THAT YOU SEE ON

2050
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
THE RIGHT PICTURE HERE IN

2051
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
THE ARROW WITH THE TARP ON

2052
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
IT THAT HE HID IN THERE.

2053
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
SWAT TEAM SURROUNDED HIM.

2054
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
HAD HIM SURROUNDED.

2055
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
BASH TAKE A LOOK AROUND

2056
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY

2057
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT

2058
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
THAT THERE COULD BE

2059
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
EXPLOSIVES THERE AS WELL.

2060
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
ONCE THAT ROBOTIC DEVICE

2061
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
WENT IN, WE UNDERSTAND THAT

2062
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
POTENTIALLY THAT IS WHEN WE

2063
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
STARTED TO HEAR SOME OF THE

2064
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
EXPLOSIONS.

2065
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
BOB WARD SAID HE HEARD SOME

2066
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
8 TO 10 EXPLOSIONS IN THAT

2067
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
AREA POSSIBLY COMING FROM

2068
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
THE BACKYARD WHERE THAT
SUSPECT IS HOLD UP IN A

2069
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
BOAT THAT YOU SEE RIGHT

2070
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THERE.
IT IS NIGHT FALL RIGHT NOW.

2071
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
AND IT'S AMAZING HOW THIS

2072
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
STORY HAS CHANGED IN A

2073
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
MATTER OF SECONDS MARK.

2074
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
>> IT CERTAINLY IS.

2075
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
THIS WAS ALL DAY PRESENCE.

2076
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
>> THE POLICE IN WATERTOWN

2077
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
OUGHT NIGHT.
THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FROM

2078
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
THE TIME THAT THE CAR CHASE

2079
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
ENDED UP IN WATERTOWN.

2080
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
WE HAD SHOOTOUT, A FIRE

2081
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
FIGHT LAST NIGHT WITH

2082
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
POLICE RESULTING IN SUSPECT

2083
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
NUMBER 1' DEMISE AS IT

2084
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
TURNED OUT AS HE WAS GUNNED

2085
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
DOWN.
THEN WE ALSO HAD THE FOOT

2086
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
CHASE THAT ENSUED FOR THIS

2087
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
INDIVIDUAL HERE IT APPEARS.

2088
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
THIS WOULD BE SUSPECT

2089
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
NUMBER 2.
THROUGHOUT THE DAY

2090
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
WATERTOWN WAS IN LOCKDOWN

2091
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
AS WERE ALL THE COMMUNITIES

2092
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
AROUND IT AS WAS THE CITY

2093
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
OF BOSTON.

2094
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
AS NIGHT.

2095
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
>> Shepard: WE ARE

2096
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
LISTENING TO WFXT IN BOSTON

2097
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
LIVE COVERAGE OF DEVELOPING

2098
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
STORY IN WATERTOWN.

2099
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THE

2100
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
SUSPECT THERE IN THE BOSTON

2101
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
MARATHON BOMBING WAS

2102
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
UNDERNEATH THIS BOAT TARP

2103
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
AND NOW THERE ARE REPORTS

2104
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
OF ALL OF THESE EXPLOSIONS

2105
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
AND THE EXPLOSIONS, THOUGH

2106
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
THEY ARE BEING REPORTED BY

2107
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
THE LOCAL REPORTER AS A

2108
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS, IT'S

2109
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
POSSIBLE THAT WHEN THEY
SENT THIS ROBOT IN TO DO

2110
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THE EXPLORATION OF THE

2111
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
AREA, TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEOS

2112
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
AND THE REST, THEY COULD

2113
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
HAVE SET OFF A FLASH BANG

2114
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
IN THERE.

2115
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
IF YOU REMEMBER THE

2116
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN

2117
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
CALIFORNIA WHEN THE MAN WAS

2118
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
GOING TO -- HE WAS SHOOTING

2119
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
A BUNCH OF COPS OUT THERE.

2120
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
AND AUTHORITIES SET OFF

2121
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
FLASH BANGS INSIDE THE

2122
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
BUILDING TO TRY AND RESCUE

2123
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
THE HOSTAGE SHOWS FLASH

2124
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
BANGS ENDED UP SETTING THE

2125
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
HOUSE ON FIRE, REMEMBER?

2126
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT'S

2127
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
THE SAME THING THAT'S GOING

2128
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
ON NOW.

2129
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS

2130
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
ISN'T AN ESCALATION BUT

2131
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
PART OF THE ONGOING

2132
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
PROCESS.

2133
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
WE HAVE NOTHING TO INDICATE

2134
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
ANY FURTHER HAVE BEEN

2135
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
INJURED THERE AT LEAST AT

2136
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
THIS MOMENT.
SO WE DON'T GET AHEAD OF

2137
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
OURSELVES IN THE REPORTING

2138
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT IS

2139
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THAT THE SUSPECT IS NOW

2140
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
SURROUNDED IN THE BACKYARD

2141
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
OF A STREET IN FRANKLIN

2142
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
STREET IN WATERTOWN.

2143
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE COME FROM

2144
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
BOSTON AND DID IMMEDIATELY

2145
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
FROM OUR POSITION IN

2146
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
DOWNTOWN BOSTON WE WATCHED

2147
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
THEM HEADING IN THAT

2148
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
DIRECTION.

2149
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE

2150
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
SOMEWHERE AROUND HUNDREDS

2151
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
OF OFFICERS ON SCENE AND

2152
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IS

2153
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
SURROUNDED.
WHAT THESE NEW EXPLOSIONS

2154
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
ARE, WE DON'T YET KNOW.

2155
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
THEY WERE WORKING TO MAKE

2156
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
CONTACT WITH A NEIGHBOR AND

2157
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN

2158
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
WE DO.

2159
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
NOW BACK TO LOCAL COVERAGE

2160
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
FROM FOX 25 WFXT FOR NEW

2161
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
ENGLAND.
>> THIS WHOLE CROWD HERE,

2162
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
DOZENS OF PEOPLE.
YOU COULDN'T HEAR A PIN

2163
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
DROP IT'S SO QUIET OUT HERE

2164
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
RIGHT NOW.

2165
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
WE HEARD A SERIES -- MANY

2166
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
HERE BELIEVE INCLUDING

2167
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
MYSELF THAT THERE WERE

2168
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
GUNSHOTS FIRED.

2169
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
WE HEARD TWO FAINT POPS.

2170
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
ONE OF THOSE TWO DEFINITELY

2171
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT.

2172
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
THEN WE HAD A LULL OF ABOUT

2173
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
30 SECONDS.
AND THEN WE HEARD A LOUD

2174
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
BOOM.
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT

2175
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
WAS.
COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLOSIVE

2176
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
OR COULD HAVE BEEN A

2177
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
GUNSHOT.
AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE WE

2178
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
HEARD TWO MORE POPS WHICH

2179
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
SOUNDED LIKE GUNSHOTS.

2180
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
EVERYONE HERE IS LISTENING

2181
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WAS

2182
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
EXACTLY.
EVERYBODY YELLED GUNSHOTS

2183
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
WHEN THEY HEARD THE NOISE.

2184
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I'M STANDING HERE WITH DAWN

2185
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
WHO ACTUALLY HEARD THE

2186
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
SOUNDS AS WELL.

2187
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE TO

2188
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
YOU?

2189
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
>> WELL, FIRST I HEARD

2190
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
ABOUT -- TWO POPS, YOU

2191
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
KNOW LOUD DISTINCT POPS,

2192
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
GUNSHOTS.
ABOUT 10 SECOND INTERVAL

2193
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
AND THEN WE HEARD A THIRD

2194
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
SHOT.
AND THEN A COUPLE MINUTES

2195
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
WENT BY.

2196
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
TIME IS KIND OF FUZZY RIGHT

2197
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
NOW AND THEN WE HEARD

2198
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
THAT'S THE LAST WE HAVE

2199
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
HEARD.
>> AND IT'S REALLY QUIET ON

2200
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
SCENE RIGHT NOW.

2201
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
EVERYONE -- EVERYBODY IS

2202
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
TRYING TO LISTEN IN AND GET

2203
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
A GRASP FOR WHAT EXACTLY

2204
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
THOSE SOUNDS WERE.

2205
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
>> JARED I'M GOING TO STOP

2206
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
YOU FOR JUST A MOMENT TO

2207
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
SAY WE ARE GETTING FROM BOB

2208
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
WARD.

2209
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
HE BELIEVES THEY MAY HAVE

2210
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
BEEN FLASH BANKS.

2211
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME

2212
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY

2213
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
AS YOU ARE A MARINE WHO

2214
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
ALSO WORKED WITH

2215
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
EXPLOSIVES, SO TELL US A

2216
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND

2217
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OR

2218
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
DIDN'T HEAR.

2219
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
>> RIGHT, ONE OF THOSE WAS

2220
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
VERY LOUD.

2221
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A

2222
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
GUNSHOT TO ME.

2223
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
IT DID SOUND LIKE A FLASH

2224
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
BANG.

2225
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I CAN'T SEE IT.
IT DID SOUND MORE OF LIKE

2226
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
AN EXPLOSIVE.

2227
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I FIGURED IT WAS EITHER A

2228
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
FLASH BANG OR PIPE BOMB.

2229
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT'S

2230
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
ON SCENE.

2231
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
IT DID SOUND MORE THAN

2232
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
GUNSHOT ONE OF THOSE

2233
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
SOUNDS, A LITTLE MORE

2234
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
FAINT.
>> JARED, I JUST WANT TO

2235
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
PASS ALONG TO THE AUDIENCE

2236
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING NEW

2237
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
INFORMATION.

2238
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
SOURCES TELLING US NOW THAT

2239
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
THE SUSPECT IS INJURED FROM

2240
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
LAST NIGHT FROM LAST

2241
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
NIGHT'S CAR CHASE.

2242
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
THE FIRE FIGHT THAT ENSUED

2243
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
AND THEN HIS SUBSEQUENT

2244
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
FLEEING ON FOOT.

2245
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
SO WE'RE TOLD AGAIN THAT

2246
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
THE SUSPECT WAS INJURED IN

2247
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,000
LAST NIGHT'S SHOOTOUT.

2248
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
AND SO NOW WE KNOW HE IS

2249
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
INJURED, HE IS IN THAT

2250
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
BOAT.

2251
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME

2252
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
OUT.
SOME TYPE OF ROBOTIC DEVICE

2253
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
HAS GONE IN TO SEE WHAT IT

2254
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
LOOKS LIKE IN THAT AREA,

2255
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
POTENTIALLY WHETHER OR NOT

2256
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
HE IS THE SUSPECT THEY HAVE

2257
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
BEEN LOOKING FOR ALTHOUGH

2258
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO

2259
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:00,000
BELIEVE IT MAY BE.

2260
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO

2261
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
TRY TO TAKE HIM OUT ALIVE.

2262
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
THERE IS A QUESTION HERE.

2263
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
DOES HE WANT TO COME OUT

2264
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
AND HE SIMPLY CAN'T BECAUSE

2265
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
HE IS INJURED?

2266
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

2267
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
WE DON'T
