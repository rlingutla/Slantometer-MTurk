To many, words are

Last I checked,
stores don't take "words."

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Some do.

501
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Not everyone can be the poetic
voice of a generation.

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It helps block 6 key
inflammatory substances

509
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
that cause symptoms.

510
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Pills block one

511
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000

512
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000

everything.

So he took Aleve.

If he'd taken Tylenol,

516
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
he'd be stopping for
more pills right now.

517
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Only Aleve has the strength
to stop tough pain

518
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
for up to 12 hours
with just one pill.

It's a serious disease.

524
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My doctor said the risk is
greater now that I'm over 50!

525
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah...ya-ha...

526
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Just one dose of the PREVNAR 13®

527
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
vaccine can help protect you

528
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
from pneumococcal pneumonia-
an illness that can cause

529
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
coughing, chest pain,
difficulty breathing,

530
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and may even put you
in the hospital.

531
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
PREVNAR 13® is approved for
adults 18 and older to help

532
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
prevent infections from
13 strains of the bacteria that

533
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
cause pneumococcal pneumonia.

534
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You should not receive
PREVNAR 13® if you have had

535
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
a severe allergic reaction to
the vaccine or its ingredients.

536
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If you have a weakened
immune system,

537
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you may have a lower
response to the vaccine.

538
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The most common side effects
were pain, redness,

539
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and swelling at
the injection site,

540
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
limited arm movement, fatigue,

541
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
headache, muscle pain,
joint pain, less appetite,

and rash.

Flonase outperforms the #1

602
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It helps block 6 key
inflammatory substances

603
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
that cause symptoms.

604
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Pills block one

605
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000

When a critical patient is far

That's the power of and.

617
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
my doctor recommended I
switch laxatives.

618
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Stimulant Laxatives
make your body go

619
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
by forcefully stimulating the
nerves in your colon.

620
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
MiraLAX is different.

621
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It works with the
water in your body

622
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
to hydrate and soften.

623
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Unblocking your
system naturally.

624
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
MiraLAX.

625
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
(Con artists...)

626
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
They'll try anything to get your
Medicare card number.

627
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So they can steal your identity,

628
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
commit Medicare Fraud.

629
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What can you do?

630
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Guard your Card?

631
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Guard your Card?

632
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Just like your credit card.

633
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Nobody gets my number, unless I
know they should have it.

634
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
To protect your identity,

635
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
new Medicare cards without
Social Security numbers

636
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
will be mailed next year.

637
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Visit Medicare.gov/Fraud

638
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Stay sharp people!

639
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I even accept I have a
higher risk of stroke
as far as I used to.

640
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
due to AFib,

641
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
a type of
irregular heartbeat

642
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
not caused by a
heart valve problem.

643
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But no matter
where I ride,

644
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I go for my best.

645
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So if there's something
better than warfarin,

646
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'll go for that too.

647
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
ELIQUIS.

648
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
ELIQUIS reduced
the risk of stroke

649
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
better than warfarin,

650
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
plus had less
major bleeding

651
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
than warfarin.

652
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
ELIQUIS had both.

653
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't stop taking ELIQUIS

654
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
unless your doctor
tells you to,

655
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
as stopping increases your
risk of having a stroke.

656
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

657
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you
have an artificial heart valve

658
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
or abnormal bleeding.

659
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
While taking ELIQUIS,

660
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you may bruise more easily...

661
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
...and it may take
longer than usual

662
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
for any bleeding to stop.

663
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Seek immediate
medical care

664
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
for sudden signs
of bleeding,

665
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
like unusual bruising.

666
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
ELIQUIS may increase
your bleeding risk

667
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
if you take
certain medicines.

668
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Tell your doctor about

669
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
all planned medical
or dental procedures.

670
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm still going
for my best.

671
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And for ELIQUIS.

672
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000

about ELIQUIS.
