IT'S EARLY YET.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IT HAPPENED JUST A FEW HOURS AGO

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, JUST TO THE

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000

FROM THE AIR, IT IS HARD TO KNOW

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
AT TIMES JUST WHAT IT IS WE ARE

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
LOOKING AT.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EITHER AN

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
A MILE WIDE AT THE BASE OF THE

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
STORM.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
IT WAS IN THIS SAME TOWN --

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
MOORE, OKLAHOMA -- BACK IN 1999

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
WHEN THE HIGHEST EVER TORNADO

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WINDS WERE RECORDED, 302 MILES

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
AGAIN, EARLY PICTURES FROM MOORE

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
SHOW SCHOOL CHILDREN STAGGERING

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
INTO THE ARMS OF TEACHERS AND

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
PARENTS.
THERE ARE FIRES BURNING FROM

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
OPEN GAS LINES.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THERE ARE MILES OF DEVASTATION.

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
IT HAS BEEN HARD TO LISTEN TO,

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
BUT LOCAL REPORTERS HAVE BEEN

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000

AFTER ALL, THEY ARE COVERING

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE REPORT

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THAT MANY SCHOOL CHILDREN MAY

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
HAVE BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE ONE

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000

YOU CAN SEE AGAIN -- WE HAVE

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
SAID IT BEFORE FROM THE AIR --

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
IT'S TOTALLY DESTROYED.

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
MOST OF THE WALLS COLLAPSED.

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
NUMBER OF CARS THAT WERE THROWN

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
INTO THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
IT'S AN OFFICE ON THE FRONT OF

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
THIS SCHOOL.

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THERE IS A TRUCK, SUV OF SOME

85
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
KIND THROWN INTO THE FRONT OF

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000

WORK ON GETTING KIDS OUT OF THE

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
SCHOOL BUILDING.

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AGAIN, I TOLD YOU A FEW MINUTES

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF KIDS

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL AT THE

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TIME.
THEY WERE LITERALLY HUGGING THE

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
WALLS OF THE INTERIOR HALLWAYS

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
AS THAT TORNADO WENT OVERHEAD,

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
TRYING TO SURVIVE.

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THEY WERE BEING PROTECTED BY

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT WORKED

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
IN THIS SCHOOL BUILDING.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
AGAIN, RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW

102
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
HOW MANY KIDS WERE INSIDE OR ARE

103
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
STILL INSIDE.

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
AGAIN, APPARENTLY THERE MAY

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
STILL BE KIDS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.

107
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THE INFORMATION IS VERY SPARSE

108
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000

STILL BE KIDS INSIDE.

114
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HONESTLY IT'S NOT JUST THE

115
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
SCHOOL THAT GOT HIT.

116
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000

AT LEAST SIX CHILDREN HAVE

SCHOOL AS IT WAS DIRECTLY STRUCK

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
BY THE TORNADO.

THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE

THESE ARE WELL BUILT FRAME

HOMES, BRICK HOMES.

154
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.

155
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THIS POINT.

THEY ARE GATHERING RIGHT NOW,

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
SETTING UP COMMAND POSTS, TRYING

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
TO BE ORDERLY IN HOW THEY

164
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
RESPOND TO THIS.

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THEY ARE GOING TO NEED TO GO

SCHOOL THAT ALSO TOOK A DIRECT

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
HIT FROM THE TORNADO.
WE TALKED TO ONE SCHOOL TEACHER

174

A LITTLE BIT AGO.

175
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
HE SAID THE TEACHERS TOOK ALL

THE SCHOOL KIDS INTO THE MIDDLE,

177
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THE CENTER PART OF THE SCHOOL,

178
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
PUT THEM ON INTERIOR WALLS AND

179
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
AS FAR AS HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE

180
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
TEACHER AND STUDENT IS ACCOUNTED

181
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
FOR.

182
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000

00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WE SPOKE WITH A YOUNG WOMAN THAT

189
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
LIVES IN THIS HOME.

190
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SHE WAS NOT HOME AT THE TIME,

191
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THANK GOODNESS.

192
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
SHE'S OKAY.

193
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
HER FAMILY IS OKAY.

194
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
HER NEIGHBORS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.

195
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
NOW IT IS THE HARD TASK OF

196
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TRYING TO PUT YOUR LIFE BACK

197
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
TOGETHER AND TRYING TO FIGURE

198
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SO MUCH

199
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
CHANGED FOR YOU IN AN INSTANT.

200
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WE ARE WITH DR. GREG FORBES, AN

201
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
EXPERT IN SURVEYING DAMAGE.

202
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HE'S DONE HUNDREDS OF DAMAGE

203
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
SURVEYS IN HIS LONG CAREER.

204
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DR. FORBES, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
>> NO.

207
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER

208
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
SEEN.
THE EXPANSE OF THE DAMAGE,

209
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
PROBABLY THREE BLOCKS IN THIS

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT GOES ON AT LEAST A MILE DOWN

211
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
THERE.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN DESTRUCTION SO

212
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
TOTAL OVER SUCH AN EXPANSIVE

213
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
AREA.
>> Reporter: DR. FORBES, IS

214
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THERE A QUESTION IN YOUR MIND

215
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SINCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS MORE

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THAN ANYBODY ON THE TALENT THAT

217
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THIS TORNADO WILL NOT BE AN

218
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
EF-5?
>> I WOULD GIVE IT AN EF-5

219
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
RATING.

220
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WE HAVE TREES DEBARKED, CARS

221
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
TOSSED LONG DISTANCE.

222
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
STRUCTURES BROKEN INTO PIECES,

223
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
UNRECOGNIZABLE AND TOSSED AS

224
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
DEBRIS DOWNWIND.

225
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
IT IS A SCENE OF UTTER

226
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
DESTRUCTION, ALMOST BEYOND

227
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WORDS.

228
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
>> Reporter: BRIAN, YOU KNOW,
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF STORIES

229
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
WE HATE TO COME TO YOU WITH.

230
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WE KNOW THIS IS A SCENE THAT'S

231
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
HAPPENED BEFORE.
WE SAW THIS TWO YEARS AGO IN

232
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
JOPLIN, MISSOURI.

233
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
CONJECTURE IS SOMETHING WE DON'T

234
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
LIKE TO DO.

235
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
AT THAT TIME EARLY ON IN THAT

236
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
TORNADO THE FATALITY COUNT WAS

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
29.

238
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
OVERNIGHT IT WENT TO 92.

239
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CONFIRMED

240
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
FATALITY OF 37.

241
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S

242
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
BEEN FLATTENED.

243
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'M AFRAID OF WHAT WE'LL END UP

244
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
SEEING TOMORROW WHEN MORE

245
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
NUMBERS COME OUT, WHEN THERE IS

246
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE TALLY OF

247
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

248
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL GO ON

249
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THROUGH THE NIGHT.
THERE IS A PUNGENT ODOR TO HAVE

250
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
NATURAL GAS AND GASOLINE.

251
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WE ARE JUST HOURS INTO THIS.

252
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'M TRULY STUNNED BY WHAT I SEE.

253
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> MIKE BETTES ALONG WITH DR.

254
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
GREG FORBES IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

255
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
AS MIKE SAYS, IT IS EARLY YET.

256
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WE COULD BE IN FOR SOME DARK

257
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
HOURS AND DARK DAYS AHEAD FOR

258
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THAT COMMUNITY AS THEY COME TO

259
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
GRIPS WITH WHAT'S BEEN LOST

260
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
HERE.

261
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
MIKE, THANK YOU.

262
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OUR THANKS TO DR. FORBES AS

263
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
WELL.
>>> WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A

264
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
SURVIVOR, SOMEONE WHO WAS

265
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
EVACUATED AND MADE IT THROUGH

266
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THIS STORM IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

267
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN GET TO

268
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
THAT NOW.

269
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> WE THOUGHT WE DIED.

270
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WE WERE INSIDE THE CELLAR DOOR.

271
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
LOCKED THE CELLAR DOOR WHEN WE

272
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
SAW IT COMING.

273
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
IT GOT LOUDER AND NEXT THING YOU

274
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
KNOW, YOU SEE THE LATCH COMING

275
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
UNDONE.
WE COULDN'T REACH FOR IT.

276
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR AND JUST

277
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
GLASS AND DEBRIS STARTED

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SLAMMING ON US.

279
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE

280
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
HONEST.
>> AGAIN, WHEN YOU HEAR A

281
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
SURVIVOR STORY IT MEANS, ALMOST

282
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
BY DEFINITION IN THE HEART OF

283
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THIS STORM THAT THEY HAD
SOMEWHERE TO GO.

284
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
LOCAL WEATHER AUTHORITIES WERE

285
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
SAYING THE ONLY WAY THIS WAS

286
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
SURVIVABLE WAS TO BE UNDER

287
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
GROUND AT A SECURE UNDER GROUND

288
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
SHELTER.
IT MAY FIGURE THAT SOME OF THE

289
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THIS WERE

290
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
INDEED ABLE TO GET TO SHELTERS

291
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
AND THE OPPOSITE WAS NOT TRUE.

292
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
JANET SHAMLIAN HAS MADE HER WAY

293
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
TO MOORE, OKLAHOMA, THIS

294
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
EVENING.

295
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
JANET, GOOD EVENING.

296
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
>> Reporter: BRIAN, GOOD EVENING

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
TO YOU.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MOORE HAS

298
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
BASICALLY PARALYZED EVERYTHING

299
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
NEAR AND AROUND IT.

300
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WHAT YOU SEE OVER MY SHOULDER IS

301
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
THE AGONIZING WAIT OF PEOPLE

302
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE

303
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
COMMUNITY.

304
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, MOST OF

305
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THEM ARE BEING TURNED AWAY.

306
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
JUST TO GET TO THIS POINT, THIS

307
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
ROAD GOES ABOUT TWO MILES TO THE

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
INTERSTATE.
IT IS ABOUT AN HOUR TO GET THOSE

309
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
TWO MILES.

310
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT

311
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
BEING ALLOWED BACK INTO THEIR

312
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
HOMES.

313
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN TRYING

314
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
FOR HOURS.

315
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
THEY REPORT COMMUTES OF TWO OR

316
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
THREE HOURS TO GET 12 OR 14

317
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
MILES.
THE ONLY VEHICLES WE ARE SEEING

318
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
GO IN ARE AMBULANCES, STATE

319
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
TROOPERS, POLICE, UTILITY

320
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
COMPANIES.

321
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
AND THE ONLY ONES WE HAVE SEEN

322
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
COME OUT ARE TWO AMBULANCES WITH

323
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THEIR SIRENS FLASHI INING ABOUT

324
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
HOUR AGO.

325
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
THAT BROUGHT HOPE TO US HERE.

326
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
SPEAKING OF THE PARALYSIS, THE

327
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
USAGE OF CELL PHONES HAS MADE

328
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TRYING TO USE THE CELL PHONES

329
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
BASICALLY USELESS.

330
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
YOU CANNOT GET A CELL CALL IN OR

331
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
OUT.
PEOPLE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE ARE

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
STRUGGLING IN THAT WAY AS WELL.

333
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AS WE SEE THE AERIALS OF THE

334
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SEARCH CREWS GOING HOUSE TO

335
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
HOUSE TO HOUSE THEY ARE

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DEFINITELY TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
OUT OF THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
SOME WHO ARE DESPERATELY TRYING

339
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
TO MAKE THEIR WAY HOME, BRIAN.

340
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
>> JANET, I DID CEE LO CALL -- E

341
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
SEE LOCAL OFFICIALS TELLING

342
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
PEOPLE TO TRY TEXTING.

343
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THEY WILL DIVIDE UP THE

344
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
COMMUNITY INTO GRIDS.

345
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO

346
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BEGIN.
YOU HAVE TO SET UP SOME

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
STRUCTURE AND SEARCH PROPERTY BY

348
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
PROPERTY.
IN SOME CASES IT WILL BE

349
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ADDRESSES.

350
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
>> YEAH.

351
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN

352
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
ABLE TO TALK TO ANYBODY COMING

353
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
OUT.
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE CALLS

354
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
IN NOW ASKING US, DO OUR PHONES

355
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
WORK, AND THEY DON'T EITHER.

356
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET

357
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
MUCH COMMUNICATION.

358
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
WE KNOW EVERYONE IS AFFECTED IN

359
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THE SAME WAY AT THIS POINT.

360
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> JANET SHAMLIAN PART OF OUR

361
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
TEAM ON THE GROUND IN MOORE,

362
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
OKLAHOMA.
>> WE GO TO THE WEATHER CHANNEL

363
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
HEADQUARTERS.

364
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
TO BE HONEST.

365
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND --

366
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
WE HAD A LONG WIND-UP ON SEVERE

367
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WEATHER.

368
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
WE KNEW THIS SYSTEM WAS COMING.

369
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
AT LEAST IT STRUCK DURING THE
DAY AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

370
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
NIGHT.
