FIGHTER PILOT WITH MORE THAN 30 

118
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,622
YEARS EXPERIENCE.               
HE FLIES OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA    

119
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:34,926
NOW, THIS SHOT FROM JUNE AS HE  
REFUELED DURING A RISHGS.       

120
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,997
THE GENERAL IS ALSO A PURPLE    
HEART RECIPIENT N1996 HE WAS    

121
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,299
STATIONED IN SAUDI ARABIA WHEN  
HE WAS INJURED IN THE BOMBING OF

122
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:46,004
THE KOBAR TOWERS.               
19 AIRMEN DIED IN THAT ATTACK,  

123
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:54,479
SOME 300 OTHERS HURT.           
LT. GENERAL JEFFREY COBRA       

124
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,116
HARIGIAN, CENTRAL COMMAND, HAN  
HONOR TO HAVE YOU.              

125
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,653
>> IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.       
>> DOES ANYTHING CHANGE IN      

126
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,725
REGARDS TO THE RUSSIANS?        
>> STEP ONE IS MANAGE THE DEACON

127
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:11,229
FLICKS, GET BACK TO THE FIGHT   
AGAINST ISIS.                   

128
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:15,367
WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND 
IN COORDINATION WITH THE TEAM TO

129
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:21,873
MAKE SURE WE HAVE DEACON FLIKTED
TO GET OF ONE IN THE SIGS FIGHT.

130
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,544
WE'LL GET THE TEAM IN POSITION  
TO ENSURE THERE'S NOT A         

131
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,646
STRATEGIC MISCOMMUNICATION THAT 
CAN OCCUR.                      

132
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,515
>> Shepard: THE RUSSIANS WERE   
FIRING ON OTHERS, OUR SPECIAL OP

133
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,718
FORCES NEARBY.                  
IT WAS TOO CLOSE.               

134
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,421
AND WE SAID, BASICALLY, DON'T DO
IT AND THEY SAID WE'LL FIRE ON  

135
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:41,226
YOU.                            
DOES THAT CHANGE ANYTHING ON THE

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,528
GROUND?                         
>> WELL, I THINK THE IMPORTANT  

137
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,865
PART TO REMEMBER HERE IS WE WILL
PROTECT OUR FORCE.              

138
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,868
IT SHOULD BE CRYSTAL CLEAR IN   
EVERY AMERICAN'S MIND THAT WE'RE

139
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,572
FOG TO PROTECT OUR FORCE.       
WE WORK THROUGH THIS, I THINK   

140
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:58,443
THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT
NEEDS TO OCCUR IS GETTING BACK  

141
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:06,117
TO FIGHTING ISIS, DE-CONFLICTING
OUR FORCES, ENSURING THE        

142
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,552
MECHANISM TO DO THAT, WHAT IS   
REQUIRED IS A CONTINUED         

143
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:08,987
COVERINGS WITH THE RUSSIANS TO  
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.               

144
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,057
>> Shepard: WE HAD A MEETING    
THAT HAPPENS AT UNDISCLOSED, ALL

145
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,626
THE REST, A MEETING YOU WOULD   
HAVE ATTENDED HAD YOU NOT BEEN  

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,628
HERE.                           
>> I HAD A REPRESENTATIVE THERE.

147
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,130
AND THAT REPRESENTATIVE GAVE ME 
FULL FEEDBACK ON HOW THAT PLAYED

148
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,467
OUT.                            
AND THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.    

149
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:26,271
>> I KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW DETAILS,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW DETAILS.   

150
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:29,307
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, IF YOU CAN
TELL US, ARE THINGS GETTING     

151
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,744
BETTER.                         
>> THERE WAS PROGRESS MADE.     

152
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,447
IT WILL BE PIECEMEAL AND IT WILL
TAKE TIME.                      

153
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,352
THE KEY IS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE
WORK THROUGH DE-CON FLICKS THAT 

154
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,689
ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE OUR FIGHT.
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO

155
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,361
ENCIRCLE AND ANNIHILATE ISIS    
PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE      

156
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,163
EUPHRATES RIVER VALLEY.         
>> IS THAT WHAT THE RUSSIANS    

157
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,899
WANT?                           
ARE WE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE?     

158
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,535
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE   
TEAM-TO-TEAM, RUSSIANS AND      

159
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,006
AMERICANS.                      
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE        

160
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,340
COMMUNICATED TO US.             
PUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AS YOU

161
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,309
KNOW, ACTIONS SPEECH LOUDER THAN
WORDS.                          

162
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,380
WE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH 
THAT, FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE MAKE 

163
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,483
SURE THAT OUR AIRMEN, OUR       
TEAMMATES ON THE GROUND, OUR    

164
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,418
SOLDIERS AND OUR PARTNERS ARE IN
A POSITION TO CONTINUE THAT     

165
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,454
FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.             
>> Shepard: OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

166
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,658
THINGS IS THAT WE'RE BOMBING    
MORE TARGETS IN SYRIA, ISIS     

167
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,727
RELATED, THAN IN THE PAST.      
IS THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE  

168
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,064
TARGETS OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?
>> WELL I THINK IT'S COMBINATION

169
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,067
OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO
DEVELOP TARGETS.                

170
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:34,906
OVER TIME, AS WE'VE SPENT TIME  
USING OUR INTELLIGENCE,         

171
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,609
SURVEILLANCE, AND RECON SAYS    
ASSETS WE HAVE A BETTER         

172
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,412
UNDERSTANDING OF THE            
ENVIRONMENT.                    

173
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,415
THE SECOND BIG PIECE IS THE     
SIRRIAL DEMOCRATIC FORCES ARE ON

174
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:47,953
THE MOVE.                       
IN RA" A, THE GREAT SUCCESS,    

175
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,122
ALONG WITH THE MIDDLE EUPHRATES 
RIVER VALLEY THAT, DRIVES       

176
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,127
ACTIVITY.                       
>> Shepard: SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC   

177
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,228
FORCES.                         
THAT'S THE ONES WE FIGHT WITH   

178
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,263
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT?         
>> YES, SIR.                    

179
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,298
THAT'S IT.                      
>> Shepard: ARE THEY GETTING    

180
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,136
BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO, AND ARE 
THEY -- CAN THEY STAND UP?      

181
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,707
>> WOULD I TELL YOU, THEIR      
ASYMMETRIC ADVANTAGE IS AIR     

182
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,742
POWER.                          
WE PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO    

183
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,978
REMAIN ON THE OFFENSIVE.        
AND PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION

184
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,615
TO SUCCEED.                     
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE TODAY.      

185
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,617
>> Shepard: THE CRITICS SAID    
REPEATEDLY THAT OUR AIR FORCE IS

186
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,287
WORKING FOR IRAN IN THAT MATTER.
>> I WOULD DENY THAT.           

187
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,089
>> Shepard: I WOULDN'T SUGGEST  
ANYTHING ELSE.                  

188
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,757
BUT WE CAN SEE WHERE THEY'RE    
COMING FROM.                    

189
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,495
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.           
BUT I THINK IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE 

190
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,568
SUPPORTING THE SBS IN THEIR     
OPERATION, THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC

191
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,803
FORCES, TO DELIBERATE THESE     
CITIES IN SYRIA.                

192
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,239
THEY HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE AT   
DOING THAT AND WE'RE SUPPORTING 

193
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,975
THEM EVERY DAY AND CONTINUE TO  
DO THAT.                        

194
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:50,215
>> Shepard: WHEN YOU TAKE OUT   
ISIS WHAT HAPPENS THEN?         

195
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,683
>> WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS        
FACILITATE THE ABILITY FOR THE  

196
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,152
POLITICAL PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE 
SO THAT GOVERNANCE CAN OCCUR    

197
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,022
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALLOW THE
PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO WORK.     

198
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,258
THE KIDS TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL. 
>> Shepard: THAT SOUNDS GREAT.  

199
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,627
FROM EVERYTHING WE SEE IT LOOKS 
LIKE SYRIA IS PRETTY WELL       

200
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,598
DESTROYED.                      
>> THAT WILL BE A HEAVY LIFT.   

201
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:11,336
BUT THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES
COMBINED WITH OUR PRECISION     

202
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,073
TARGETING HAVE DONE AS MUCH AS  
THEY CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT      

203
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:19,044
INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS STANDING.
GO AHEAD.                       

204
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,145
>> Shepard: I DIDN'T MEAN TO    
INTERRUPT.                      

205
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,846
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT    
IRAQ.                           

206
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,516
IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S VERY    
GOOD PROGRESS THERE.            

207
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,319
IN FACT, FROM A LOT OF READING  
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, IT      

208
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,424
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE COLLAPSING  
MORE QUICKLY THAN HAD BEEN      

209
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,792
ANTICIPATED.                    
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. 

210
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:38,229
THE WORD I'M USING IS MOMENTUM. 
THEY HAVE MOMENTUM.             

211
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:44,703
IT'S BECAUSE THE IRAQIE SKRT    
FORCES PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE   

212
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,737
VERY CONFIDENT IN WHAT THEY'RE  
DOING.                          

213
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,105
THE SECURITY FORCES.            
THEY LEMPLED THE SKILLS THAT WE 

214
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,174
BRING TO SUPPORT THEM.          
WHAT YOU SEE IS A GROWING       

215
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,444
NATIONALISM INSIDE OF IRAQ.     
THEY OWN THIS.                  

216
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,979
THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD    
THROW OUT IS WHAT I'VE SEEN ON  

217
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,183
THE GROUND IS THEY'VE BEEN      
COURAGEOUS, THEY'VE BEEN HEROIC 

218
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,485
IN THE FIGHT AND THE PEOPLE     
APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO 

219
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,254
LIBERATE THEM.                  
>> Shepard: I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT

220
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,225
BEFORE, THE OTHER TIMES THAT WE 
HAVE ENGAGED OURSELVES WITH     

221
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,527
GENERALS OF YOUR ILK HAVE SAID  
OTHER THINGS.                   

222
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,198
THE POINT IS, AS YOU'VE WATCHED 
THIS MATURE OVER TIME THE       

223
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:17,702
IRAQIES HAVE BEEN UP FRONT.     
WE ARE IN AN ADVISE AND ASSIST  

224
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,204
OPERATION.                      
THAT'S HOW WE SUPPORT THEM.     

225
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:25,577
WHEN YOU COMBINE THE OPERATIONS 
WITH THE ASYMMETRIC FORCES OF   

226
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,614
THEIR POWER, THEY ARE SUCCEEDING
AND BRINGING IN FORCES THAT     

227
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,784
MAINTAIN THE STABILITY TO ALLOW 
GOVERNANCE TO OCCUR.            

228
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,586
>> Shepard: YOU TALK ABOUT IRAQI
NATIONALISM, THAT'S HARD TO     

229
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,223
FIND.                           
THE KURDS MORE THAN EVER WANT   

230
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,525
OUT.                            
THEY'RE ORGANIZING AND THEY     

231
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,996
DON'T WANT TO BE IRAQ, THEY WANT
TO BE KURDISTAN.                

232
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,699
>> THE KURDISH REFERENDUM IS    
SOMETHING WE'RE ALL CONCERNED   

233
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,834
ABOUT.                          
POLITICALLY THAT WILL BE        

234
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,369
SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO BE  
SORTED OUT.                     

235
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:56,341
FROM THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE WE
WANT TO ENSURE THEIR STABILITY  

236
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,344
AND SECURITY THAT FACILITATES   
POLITICAL PROGRESS TO BE MADE.  

237
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:02,981
>> Shepard: WILL THERE COME A   
TIME WHEN THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF 

238
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,349
THEMSELVES?                     
HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN THAT IS?  

239
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:07,418
>> THAT'S THE PLAN.             
BUT WE HAVE TO ALLOW THAT TO    

240
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,854
TAKE TIME.                      
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FOR

241
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,924
THAT TO OCCUR.                  
WE WILL LAY OUT METRICS AS WE   

242
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,894
MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE 
CAMPAIGN, THAT WOULD LAY OUT    

243
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,898
WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE   
TIME FOR US STARTING TO HAND    

244
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,333
OVER THE RESPONSIBILITIES       
PARTICULARLY FROM A SUPPORT ON  

245
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,404
THE MILITARY SIDE PERSPECTIVE.  
>> Shepard: WE READ REPORTS THAT

246
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,140
THE AIR FORCE DOESN'T HAVE      
ENOUGH BOMBS.                   

247
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:35,313
AND WHATEVER YOU READ SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT AS A JOURNALIST, YOU  

248
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,748
THINK THEY WANT MORE FUNDING.   
WE ALSO WANT MORE FUNDING,      

249
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,017
EVERYONE DOES.                  
OR DO WE HAVE A CRITICAL BOMB   

250
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,685
SHORTAGE?                       
>> I'VE BEEN MANAGING THIS FROM 

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,021
THE DAY I TOOK COMMAND 15 MONTHS
AGO.                            

252
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,490
IT'S AN ISSUE WE HAVE WORKED    
THROUGH CLOSELY WITH THE AIR    

253
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:49,394
FORCE AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.
AND THERE'S A CONCERN OUT THERE,

254
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,730
CLEARLY, AS YOU LOOK AT THE     
BUDGET AND ABILITY TO FORECAST  

255
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,267
LONG TERM, CONTINUING           
RESOLUTIONS DO NOT HELP OUR     

256
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,170
ABILITY TO PROCURE THE WEAPONS  
IN THE LONG TERM THAT WE NEED.  

257
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:03,808
>> Shepard: YOU NEED A BUDGET.  
>> THAT WOULD BE HELP.          

258
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,043
>> Shepard: HOW IS WASHINGTON   
RESPONDING?                     

259
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,946
>> I THINK THEY HEAR US BUT I'LL
COME BACK TO THERE IS TALKING   

260
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,815
BUT WE NEED TO SEE ACTION TO GET
THE BUDGET RESOLVED.            

261
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,117
>> Shepard: DOES THE LACK OF A  
BUDGET, JUST CONTINUING         

262
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,520
RESOLUTION, MAKE YOUR JOB AND   
THE MILITARY JOB HARDER?        

263
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,488
>> IT CONCERNS ME.              
THE ANSWER TO THAT IN THE SHORT 

264
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,391
TERM IS YES.                    
IT DRIVES US TO HAVE CHALLENGES 

265
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:24,095
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT    
HAVE TO DEAL WITH HAD THERE BEEN

266
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,633
A BUDGET.                       
>> Shepard: YOU HAVE HAD        

267
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,068
PROBLEMS WITH SOME PLANES.      
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF TAKING THEM

268
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,102
OUT OF THE THE MIX.             
WHERE IS THAT?                  

269
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,105
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE'VE 
BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT  

270
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,543
AND AS YOU LOOK AT THE RESOURCES
THAT I HAVE, AVAILABLE TO ME,   

271
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,446
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXECUTE THE   
FIGHT EVERY DAY WITHOUT HAVING  

272
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,816
TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE ASSETS     
BEING PULLED BACK.              

273
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,752
>> Shepard: WHEN YOU LOOK AT    
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH NORTH      

274
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,256
KOREA, THE BACK AND FORTH       
RHETORICALLY AND OTHERWISE,     

275
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,626
WHAT'S YOURS GREATEST CONCERN?  
>> WELL, I THINK AT THE END OF  

276
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,495
THE DAY ALL OF US ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THIS ESCALATING INTO      

277
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,730
SOMETHING THAT NO WOULD WANTS TO
HAPPEN.                         

278
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,899
THAT IS OUT OF MY AREA OF       
RESPONSIBILITY.                 

279
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,868
BUT AS AN AMERICAN, THERE IS A  
CONCERN THERE THAT I THINK WE   

280
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:08,339
ALL SHOULD BE WARY OF.          
AND HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A     

281
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,774
DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO THIS     
PROBLEM.                        

282
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,309
>> Shepard: WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT
NIGHT?                          

283
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:15,947
>> WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY IN
MY AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, IS   

284
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,417
THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRATEGIC  
MISCALCULATION.                 

285
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,555
WE ARE NOT THERE TO FIGHT       
RUSSIA.                         

286
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,057
WE ARE NOT THERE TO FIGHT SYRIA.
OUR JOB IS TO CRUSH ISIS AND    

287
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,025
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING EVERY   
DAY.                            

288
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,296
I WORRY THAT WE PUT OUR AIRMEN, 
OUR COALITION TEAM, IN A        

289
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,798
POSITION WHERE STRATEGIC        
MISCALCULATION COULD OCCUR.     

290
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,568
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING THIS   
DE-CONFLICT.                    

291
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,337
>> Shepard: YOU USE THAT PHONE  
WITH THE RUSSIANS?              

292
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,040
>> I DON'T USE INTEREST BUT MY  
GUYS DO EVERY DAY.              

293
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,776
>> WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT PHONE?  
>> THE INTERESTING PART IS I    

294
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,713
HAVE SOME YOUNG AIRMEN THAT WE  
BRING IN, THAT ARE INTERPRETERS.

295
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:53,084
SO WE'LL TALK, THEY'LL RESPOND  
AND OUR INTERPRETERS, THESE     

296
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,321
YOUNG AIRMEN, TRANSLATE FOR US. 
IT'S INCREDIBLE THE CONTEXT THAT

297
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,691
THEY GIVE US WITH THEIR         
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RUSSIAN    

298
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,060
LAYMEN.                         
IT'S FASCINATING, IT'S BEEN A   

299
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:06,164
LESSON IN LEADERSHIP AS WE WORK 
THROUGH NEGOTIATING WITH THE    

300
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,268
RUSSIANS ON HOW WE DE-CONFLICT  
OUR OPERATIONS.                 

301
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,304
>> Sandra: IS IT WE'RE HERE,    
DON'T GO THERE, OR IS IT BIGGER 

302
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,942
PICTURE THAN THAT.              
>> ALL OF THE ABOVE.            

303
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,510
EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW, IF WE SEE  
SOMETHING WE DON'T LIKE WE CALL 

304
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:26,117
THEM.                           
WE WILL TRY TO MANAGE THE       

305
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,920
DE-CONFLICTION, BUT IT'S A      
CONVERSATION THAT ENSURES WE'RE 

306
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:33,491
BEING CRYSTAL CLEAR WHAT WE DO. 
GENERALLY WE COULD WHAT WE NEED 

307
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,494
TO DO TO PROTECT OUR FORCE.     
>> Shepard: YOU COMING IN HOT ON

308
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,364
THAT PHONE?                     
>> OCCASIONALLY, YES, SIR.      

309
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,000
>> Shepard: GENERAL, I CAN'T    
THANK YOU ENOUGH.               

310
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:45,003
ALL OF THE BEST AND THANK YOU   
FOR WHAT YOU DO FOR OUR NATION. 

311
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,306
>> IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE.  
WHAT YOUR YOUNG AMERICANS ARE   

312
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,842
DOING AND WHAT THE COALITION    
TEAM IS DOING IS SOMETHING FOR  

313
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:54,479
US ALL TO BE PROUD OF.          
>> Shepard: HERE, HERE.         

314
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,782
THANK YOU, TO ALL OF YOUR       
COLLEAGUES, APPRECIATE IT.      

315
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:08,192
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.         
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP     

316
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:14,198
DOWNPLAYING THAT RUSSIANS BOUGHT
ARIZONA DURING THE ELECTION.    

317
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,868
WHAT ABOUT THE TOTALLY BIASED   
AND DISHONEST MEDIA COVERAGE IN

00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,405
FAVOR OF COOKED HILLARY?        
FACEBOOK REVEALED THIS WEEK THAT

319
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,308
FAKE ACCOUNTS BASED IN RUSSIA   
BOUGHT AROUND 3,000 POLITICAL

00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:30,515
THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY 
IT WILL TURN OVER THE ADS TO    

322
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,783
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS     
LOOKING INTO RUSSIAN            

323
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,652
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION.   
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCUSED     

324
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:39,690
DEMOCRATS OF USING RUSSIA AS AN 
EXCUSE FOR LOSING THE ELECTION. 

325
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,361
THE KREMLIN SPOKESMAN DECLINED  
THAT MOSCOW PLACED ADS ON       

326
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,463
FACEBOOK AT ALL AND CLAIMED HIS 
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO

327

THAT.                           
TRACE GALLAGHER WITH THE

TELL US MORE ABOUT WHAT FACEBOOK

329
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,539
IS DOING.                       
>> DURING THE FACEBOOK LIVE     

330
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,076
STREAM, THE CEO SAID HE CARES   
DEEPLY ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC     

331
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,911
PROCESS AND PROTECTING ITS      
INTEGRITY.                      

332
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,780
BECAUSE OF THAT HE IS           
IMPLEMENTING A SERIES OF STEPS  

333
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,950
THE COMPANY PLANS ON TAKING TO  
ENSURE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN

00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,920
AGAIN.                          
HE ALSO GAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR 

335
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,354
HOW IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN   
THE FIRST PLACE.

PROGRAMMATICALLY THROUGH THE    
APPS WITHOUT AN ADVERTISER      

338
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,096
SPEAKING TO SOME ONE AT

339
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,566
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.      
EVEN WITHOUT OUR EMPLOYEES      

340
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,736
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE SALES, 
WE CAN DO BETTER.               

341
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,574
BY DOING BETTER HE MEANS        
FACEBOOK WILL IMPROVE ITS REVIEW

342

COMMISSIONS THAT WILL ALSO      

344
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,417
INCREASE TRANSPARENCY, REQUIRING
POLITICAL ADVERTISERS TO DECLARE

00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,753
EXACTLY WHO IS PAYING FOR THE
