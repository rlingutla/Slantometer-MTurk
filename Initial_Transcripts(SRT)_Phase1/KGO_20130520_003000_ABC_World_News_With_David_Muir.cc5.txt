[000:04:15;822] YOU.
[000:04:17;824] THE JACKPOT WAS $590.5 MILLION.
[000:04:20;460] SOMEONE HERE DID THE MATH TODAY,
[000:04:21;227] LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE INCOME
[000:04:22;595] FOR ZEPHYRHILLS.
[000:04:24;731] IT WOULD TAKE THE AVERAGE PERSON
[000:04:27;400] WHO LIVES THERE 28,000 YEARS TO
[000:04:29;535] MAKE THAT MUCH.
[000:04:32;238] BUT FOR SOMEONE OR SOME GROUP,

[000:05:00;133] AROUND TOWN WITH IT BURNING IN
[000:05:01;234] THEIR POCKET.
[000:05:02;835] COULD BE A FRIEND.
[000:05:03;870] COULD BE FAMILY.

[000:05:30;663] >> Reporter: YES.
[000:05:32;298] YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE AN URGENCY
[000:05:33;399] TO CHECK?
[000:05:33;933] >> YOU SEE, THE ANTICIPATION IS
[000:05:34;701] MORE OF A PLEASURE THAN ACTUALLY
[000:05:35;601] LOSING, WHICH IS MOSTLY WHAT
[000:05:37;136] HAPPENS.
[000:05:38;771] I ANTICIPATE LONGER.
