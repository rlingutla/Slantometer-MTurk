THIS COMES AFTER THE PRESIDENT  
ANNOUNCES A NEW TRAVEL BAN.

THE PRESIDENT.                  

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,381
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE TAKEN   
ANOTHER TRY AT CHANGING         

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,183

TERRIBLE HURRICANE.             

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,170

THE CLEANUP EFFORT THAT COULD BE

11
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,707
MEASURED IN MONTHS.

NORTH KOREA LIKE NOTHING WE HAVE
SEEN SINCE THE COLD WAR.        

78
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,605
THERE'S CLEANUP AND RECOVERY IN 
PUERTO RICO, AND IN TEXAS, AND  

79
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,275
OF FLORIDA, AND A LONG, LONG    
LIST COMING AT THE WHITE HOUSE

00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:41,546
KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT FOOTBALL.  
>> YES, AND THIS STARTED ON     

81
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:46,184
FRIDAY NIGHT, SHEP, WHEN HE WAS 
DOWN IN ALABAMA AT A RALLY FOR  

82
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,554
SENATOR LUTHER STRANGE, WHO IS

00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,958
AND TOMORROW NIGHT'S PRIMARY.   
THE PRESIDENT ZEROING IN ON     

84
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,894

AND GOING ON TO SAY, HE WISHES  

85
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,931
THE SUM OF THESE NFL OWNERS, ANY
TIME THE PLAYER TAKES A KNEE    

86
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,703
DURING A NATIONAL ANTHEM, WOULD 
TELL THOSE SOBS THAT THEY ARE   

87
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,306
FIRED.                          
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS  

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,042
ABOUT THE COMMENTS, WHETHER THEY
WERE TOO STRIDENT AT THE        

89
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,711
BRIEFING A SHORT TIME AGO, GIVEN
THE REACTION THAT THEY PROVOKED 

90
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,547
OVER THE WEEKEND.               
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.  

91
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:20,319
>> DID THE PRESIDENT GO TOO FAR?
>> I THINK IT IS ALWAYS         

92
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,788
APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITES STATES TO DEFEND OUR 

93
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,756
FLAG, DEFEND THE                
NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND TO DEFEND  

94
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,759
THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND
DIED TO DEFEND A.               

95
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:33,031
>> AS HE SAID OVER THE WEEKEND, 
SOME 200 PLAYERS OUT OF 1600    

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,303
EITHER TOOK A KNEE AT THE       
VARIOUS GAME OR IN THE CASE OF  

97
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,939
THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS,        
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, AND ONE OTHER 

98
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,607
TEAM, AND ACTUALLY STAYED INSIDE
THE LOCKER ROOM RATHER THAN     

99
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,144
COMING OUT.                     
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.        

100
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,949
ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION, ALEJANDRO
VILLANUEVA FOR THE PITTSBURGH   

101
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,585
STEELERS, WHO DID THREE TOURS OF
DUTY AS AN ARMY RANGER IN       

102
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,955
AFGHANISTAN HE WAS THE LONE     
PLAYER DURING THAT GAME TO COME 

103
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,293
OUT OF THE TUNNEL PUT HIS HAND  
OVER HIS HEART AND STAND FOR THE

104
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:07,966
NATIONAL ANTHEM.                
ROGER THE NFL COMMISSIONER SAID,

105
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:12,437
THE FRUSTRATION OVER THE VICE OF
RHETORIC THAT WE HEARD FROM     

106
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:17,809

COMMENTS DIVISIVE AND SAID, HE  

108
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,983
DID NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THE     
PRESIDENT SAID.                 

109
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,085
AND NOW NASCAR IS WEIGHING IN ON
ALL OF IT.                      

110
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,155
OFFICIAL STATEMENTS INCOME IN   
SPORTS ARE UNIFYING INFLUENCE IN

111
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,557
OUR SOCIETY, PUTTING PEOPLE OF  
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND       

112
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,192
BELIEFS TOGETHER.               
I RESPECT FOR THE

A HALLMARK OF OUR PRERACE

TO PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ONE'S     

117
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,540
OPINION.                        
DESPITE THE FACT THAT TEAM OWNER

118
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:52,944
SAID HE WANTED HIS TEAM MEMBERS 
TO STAND UP FOR THE             

119

PEACEFUL PROTESTS.              

121
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,520
THOSE WHO MAKE PEACEFUL         
REVOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE WILL MAKE 

122
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:05,524
VIOLENT REVOLUTION INEVITABLE.  
QUOTING JFK.                    

123
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,626
>> Shepard: JOHN, THANK YOU.    
THE TOP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,564
A NEW BAN, BUT IT'S CLIMATE     
NOTHING MORE THAN WINDOW        

125
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:19,938
DRESSING ON MUSLIMS.            
HIS TEMPER A BAND ON TRAVELERS  

126
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:24,342
ELECTED TO EXPIRE.              
FROM SIX MAJORITY MUSLIM NATIONS

127
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,778
FROM ENTERING UNLESS THEY HAD A 
SOUL CARD SO-CALLED BONA FIDE

NOW, SUDAN IS FINE, AND OFF THE 

129
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,520
LIST.                           
IT'S NEIGHBOR CHAD IS NOW ON THE

130
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,522
LIST, AND VENEZUELA.            
ALTHOUGH THE RESTRICTIONS APPLY 

131
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,759
ONLY TO A GROUP OF GOVERNMENT   
OFFICIALS AND THEIR FAMILIES.   

132
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,162
THE CHANGES TAKE EFFECT ON      
OCTOBER THE 18TH.               

133
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,132
THE HOME UNSECURED OFFICIALS SAY
THE EIGHT NATIONS EITHER FAILED 

134
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,535
TO SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH  
THE UNITED STATES OR DID NOT    

135
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,205
TAKE ENOUGH SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
IN MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.     

136
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,974
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS IS ALL
ABOUT SECURITY.                 

137
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,343
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING, MAKING  
AMERICA SAFE IS MY NUMBER ONE   

138
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,147
PRIORITY.                       
WE WILL NOT ADMIT THOSE INTO OUR

139
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,350
COUNTRY THAT YOU CANNOT SAFELY  
BET.                            

140
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,986
NEW TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT    
CANCELED ARGUMENTS FOR NEXT     

141
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,122
MONTH WITH HIS OLD TROUBLE BAND 
AFTER HE ANNOUNCED NEW          

142
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:16,428
RESTRICTIONS, CIVIL RIGHTS      
GROUPS SAY THE NEW BAN ISN'T    

143
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,930
COVERED, NORTH KOREA AND        
VENEZUELA ON THE LIST, THE STILL

144
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:24,135
AMOUNT TO A MUSLIM BAN.         
SIX OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S        

145
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,140
TARGETED COUNTRIES ARE MUSLIM,  
THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS ADDED   

146
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,643
NORTH KOREA, WITH FEW VISITORS, 
AND                             

147
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,913
AND A FEW GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS  
FROM VENEZUELA, IS DOES NOT     

148
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:40,952
CONCEAL THE REAL FACT THAT IT IS
STILL A MUSLIM BAN.             

149
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:45,290
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORIGINAL STANCE 
CANNOT BE CURED BY THROWING     

150
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,592
OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE ENEMY    
LIST.                           

151
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,128
BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS AT THE     
WHITE HOUSE.                    

152
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,765
JOHN?                           
>> THE PRESIDENT, SHEP, BELIEVE 

153
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,468
THAT BY MODIFYING THE TRAVEL    
BAN, IT WILL PASS MUSTER IN THE 

154
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,436
COURTS.                         
YOU BET THEIR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE

155
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:04,175
THE ACL YOU, WILL GO TO TRY TO  
GET STOPPED AS WELL.            

156
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,147
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT BY  
WRITING THESE OUT TO INCLUDE    

157
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,383
CHAD AND NORTH KOREA INSERTED   
OFFICIALS FROM VENEZUELA, A GETS

158
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,519
THEM OUT OF THAT IDEA THAT SO   
MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT.       

159
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,490
YOU READ THAT STATEMENT FROM THE
ACLU, THIS IS SIMPLY MUSLIM BAN,

160
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:22,961
IT'S HOPEFULLY ONE THAT CAN     
MUSTER IN THE COURTS, BECAUSE   

161
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:28,133
THE RESTRICTIONS ARE TAILORED TO
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.           

162
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,836
CERTAINLY, THE WATERFALL OF     
CRITICISM CONTINUES TO BE AIMED 

163
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,873
AT THE PRESIDENT WHETHER IT IS  
ON CAPITOL HILL WITH THE        

164
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,975
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FROM    
CIVIL LIBERTARIAN GROUPS, YOU   

165
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:40,845
WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS IN   
THE COMING DAYS, SHEP, DESPITE  

166
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,348
THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME COURT 
PUT ON HOLD THE HEARINGS THAT   

167
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,684
WERE SCHEDULED FOR THE TENTH    
SAYING, WITH THE NEW TROUBLE    

168
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,453
BAND IN PLACE, THOSE HEARINGS   
ARE MOOT.                       

169
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,555
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS AT     
THE WHITE HOUSE.                

170
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,424
LET'S GO TO JAIL, REPORTER WITH 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS            

171
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,762
HEALTH CARE.                    
THAT OVER OR NOT?               

172
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,465
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT     
THINGS GOING ON WITH THE        

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,935
WHITE HOUSE.                    
THEY ARE PLANNING A NEW TAX     

174
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,138
REFORM PLAN THIS WEEK AS WELL.  
THEY ARE ASPIRING TO MULTIPLE   

175
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,275
DIFFERENT FRONTS RIGHT NOW.     
HEALTH CARE, IT STILL SEEMS     

176
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,044
THEY'RE CROSSING THE FINGERS    
REALLY, REALLY HOPING THAT      

177
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,348
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PULL A COUPLE
OF SENATORS OVER THE LINE AND   

178
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,550
SAY THIS BILL.                  
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS          

179
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,685
ACKNOWLEDGED HIS COMMENTS THAT  
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN THIS TIME      

180
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,953
AROUND.                         
>> Shepard: WHICH OF THOSE      

181
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:26,725
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE      
PULLOVER AS YOU DESCRIBED?      

182
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:32,631
>> WE WILL HAVE TO SEE A REPORT 
SAYS TODAY, BUT IT IS NOT       

183
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,199
LOOKING GOOD.                   
>> Shepard: AND FOR OUR         

184
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,736
VIEWERS, THE REPORT WILL BE A   
FULL REPORT.                    

185
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,105
THEY'LL BE SOME GUIDANCE, IT    
WILL GET SOMETHING FROM THAT    

186
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,874
INHERE FROM THOSE ON            
CAPITOL HILL AS A RESULT.       

187
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,146
ON THESE OTHER MATTERS, JILL,   
LOTS OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT  

188
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,315
FOOTBALL, BUT I WOULD RATHER    
STICK TO THE REAL ISSUES AT     

189
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,551
HAND.                           
THE NORTH KOREA BACK AND FORTH  

190
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,956
REGARDING NUCLEAR WAR, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE NORTH KOREANS ARE NOW  

191
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,658
THREATENING -- THEY ARE         
THREATENING TO SHOOT DOWN OUR   

192
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,528
JETS IN THAT REGION.            
THE WHITE HOUSE -- THEY PLAN TO 

193
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:09,167
SEE MORE ON THIS?               
>> IS ESCALATING TO A POINT THAT

194
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,738
AMERICANS NEVER HAVE SEEN.      
YET THE FOR MR. SAINT TODAY THAT

195
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:21,980
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS OVER   
WEEKEND HAS COME IS A THREAT OF 

196
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,782
WAR AND SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS  
SAINT, WE ARE NOT THREATENING   

197
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,452
WAR.                            
WE WILL NOT GO TO WAR WITH KORE 

198
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:33,658
KOREA.                          
THE PLAN RIGHT NOW NONETHELESS, 

199
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,929
THESE ARE VERY SCARY WORDS      
COMING FROM PERSONALITIES, WHO  

200
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,265
REALLY SEEM TO BE ESCALATING THE
RHETORIC AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.   

201
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,633
SPIEL WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SORT
OF                              

202
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,070
THING SINCE THE COLD WAR, AND I 
WONDER IF THERE ARE MEETINGS OR 

203
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,206
DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY TO TRY TO  
CAMPED ON THE RHETORIC AND ALL  

204
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,242
THOSE WITH IT, BECAUSE OUR      
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY REALLY  

205
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,947
WANT IS TO GET TO THE TABLE AND 
TALK ABOUT THIS.                

206
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,950
SPEAK OUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME   
CONVERSATIONS THROUGH           

207
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,619
INTERMEDIARIES TAKING PLACE.    
PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO  

208
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:05,123
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS        
ESCALATING RHETORIC FROM THE    

209
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,926
PRESIDENT'S TWEETS, ESPECIALLY  
THOSE THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY     

210
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,895
GOING AFTER KIM JONG UN         
PERSONALLY AND CREATING A       

211
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,732
PERSONAL WAR BETWEEN THESE TWO  
MEN, WHO ARE VERY MUCH          

212
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,701
INTERESTED IN STICKING TO THEIR 
HEELS.                          

213
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:21,306
AS ONE OF THE SITUATIONS, WHERE 
THEY ARE VERY FEW GOOD OPTIONS, 

214
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,309
AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN    
THINKING AND CONSIDERING WHAT   

215
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,011
THEIR OPTIONS ARE INCLUDING     
MILITARY OPTIONS.               

216
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,381
>> Shepard: YOU WROTE ON THE    
TRAVEL BAN, IS A TRAVEL BAN --  

217
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,552
WILL GO THROUGH NOW OR IS THERE 
MORE TO COME?                   

218
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,190
>> WE HAVE TROUBLE BAND 1.0,    
2.0, THIS IS 3.0 THAT HE SIGNED 

219
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,927
ONE DAY.                        
WHAT IS DIFFERENT, ESPECIALLY   

220
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,597
FROM THE FIRST ONE THAT THEY    
PUSH THROUGH JANUARY, IS REALLY 

221
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:50,735
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE HHS 
AND STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE SPENT 

222
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,538
COMING UP WITH A STANDARD THAT  
THEY USE TO PICK WHICH COUNTRY  

223
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:58,309
WOULD BE IMPLEMENT IT, IMPACTED.
THERE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT  

224
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,412
POTENTIAL LEGAL CHALLENGES, AND 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THIS FOR    

225
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,815
MONTHS AND MONTHS GOING THROUGH 
ALL OF WHAT THEY THINK ARE THE  

226
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,917
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WANT FROM
COUNTRIES.                      

227
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,753
AS PEOPLE COME TO THE           
UNITED STATES, THINGS LIKE      

228
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,123
WHETHER THOSE COUNTRIES GIVE    
THEIR CITIZENS PASSPORTS.       

229
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,726
WHETHER THEY REPORTED STOLEN AND
COUNTERFEIT PASSPORTS TO        

230
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,731
INTERPOL.                       
WHETHER THEY SHARE INFORMATION  

231
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,533
WITH THE U.S. ABOUT TERRORIST   
LINKS.                          

232
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,802
THE U.S. PUT TOGETHER THAT SET  
OF BENCHMARKS, WENT THROUGH     

233
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,937
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IT'S 
A COME HERE THEY ARE.           

234
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,507
YOU COMPLY AND COME TO OUR      
COUNTRY, OR YOU DO NOT COMPLY,  

235
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,544
AND YOU WILL HAVE RESTRICTIONS  
PLACED ON YOU.                  

236
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,547
THE GOVERNMENT SAID, THESE EIGHT
COUNTRIES OF THE EIGHT COUNTRIES

237
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,484
THAT DO NOT LIVE UP TO THOSE

HAPPEN?                         
WHAT DO YOU DO?                 

358
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:41,252
THE SEARCH TO A CONGRESSIONAL   
REPORTER FOR "POLTICO."         

359
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:46,223
THEY ARE TRYING, WHAT CAN THEY  
DO, RACHEL?                     

360
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,425
SPEAK OUT NOT MUCH MORE         

361
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:50,828
THERE BRACING FOR FAILURE RIGHT 
NOW.                            

362
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,565
THAT IS BECAUSE ON THE ONE SITE,
HAVE CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT TO  

363
00:23:54,699 --> 00:24:01,839
TAKE THIS BILL TO THE RIGHT.    
TED CRUZ, RAND PAUL, WANTING    

364
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,810
LESS REGULATION, BUT THEN YOU   
LOSE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS    

365
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,945
PAIRED PEOPLE RELYING ON        
MEDICAID ARE VULNERABLE, AND YOU

366
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,983
HAVE A LOT OF MODERATES WHO ARE 
HOLDING OUT AND WORRIED ABOUT   

367
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,685
SUPPORTING, BECAUSE I THINK IT  
WILL HURT PEOPLE WHO RELY ON    

368
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,656
THESE PROGRAMS.                 
TO ADD ON TOP, THE PROTEST THAT 

369
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,260
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, I JUST  
DON'T SEE SUSAN COLLINS,        

370
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,628
LISA MURKOWSKI, JOHN McCAIN     
SAYING THEY WILL BACK THIS.     

371
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:28,566
A LOT OF MY REPUBLICANS         
COLLEAGUE SOURCES ARE SAYING,   

372
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,136
THIS WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE.      
>> Shepard: WHAT MADE THEM      

373
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,039
THINK THAT THIS TIME WOULD BE   
DIFFERENT?                      

374
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:41,245
WHY BRING THIS UP AGAIN TO WHAT 
APPEARS AT LEAST FOR NOW TO BE A

375
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,648
FAILURE, IF YOU DID NOT HAVE    
SOMETHING TO PLACATE THOSE WHO  

376
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:48,052
ARE VOTING NO?                  
>> I THINK TWO THINGS.          

377
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,854
THE TIME ISSUE.                 
RIGHT NOW, REPUBLICANS ONLY HAVE

378
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,424
UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK TO    
PASS AN OBAMACARE REPEAL.       

379
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,861
ONCE WE HIT SATURDAY, THEY      
CANNOT DO THIS ANYMORE, BECAUSE 

380
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,830
THEY LOSE THE ABILITY TO        
CIRCUMVENT DEMOCRATS AND BYPASS 

381
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,633
THE FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE.   
THAT GOES AWAY.                 

382
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,536
IT DISAPPEARS.                  
REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING BECAUSE  

383
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,639
OF THE TIME PRESSURE, PEOPLE    
WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY HAD TO     

384
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,175
SUPPORT SOMETHING RIGHT NOW,    
EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE       

385
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,146
EVERYTHING LEGISLATION LOOK     
REPUBLICANS, GRAHAM AND CASSIE, 

386
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,281
WERE GOING TO THROW             

387
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:23,254
MORE MONEY AT OPPONENTS.        
PUTTING MONEY IN ALASKA, ARIZON 

388
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,256
ARIZONA, AND ALSO KENTUCKY      
SQUARELY AT SENATORS, WHO ARE   

389
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,025
OPPOSED.                        
THE ISSUE IS, YOU CANNOT BUY    

390
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,394
THESE GUYS ARE.                 
JOHN McCAIN'S COMPLAINT IS NOT  

391
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,231
ABOUT MONEY AS MUCH IT IS ABOUT 
PROCESS.                        

392
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,000
HE WANTS MORE COMMITTEE         
HEARINGS.                       

393
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:39,069
ALSO RAND PAUL, HE HATES THE    
IDEA OF SENDING MONEY TO THE    

394
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,938
STATES.                         
THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY FEDERAL 

395
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,072
HEALTH CARE MONEY.              
GET RID OF THAT.                

396
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:47,444
THESE ARE THINGS YOU CANNOT     
BRIDGE PEOPLE BY, AND           

397
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,314
REPUBLICANS, THE TIME IS        
TICKING, AND THEY WANT TO DO    

398
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:53,851
SOMETHING, BUT THEY ARE IN A BAD
SPOT RIGHT NOW.                 

399
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,287
>> Shepard: AND                 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT   

400
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,289
NORTH KOREA ON THE ONE HAND AND 
RATCHETING THAT UP AND ON THE   

401
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:04,628
OTHER HAND, ALL THE RACISM WITH 
THE NFL.                        

402
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,531
HE HAS NOT BEEN TWEETING ABOUT  
HEALTH CARE AT ALL.             

403
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:12,469
DOES HE CARE ABOUT THIS?        
>> WELL, HE CERTAINLY SAYS HE   

404
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,605
DOES.                           
I CAN TELL YOU REPUBLICANS ON   

405
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,242
THE HILL ARE VERY UPSET ABOUT   
THE FACT THAT HE IS IN A WAR    

406
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,045
RIGHT NOW WITH THE NFL.         
THEY SAY IT IS A DISTRACTION.   

407
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,714
IT THEY COULD REALLY USE HIS    
HELP GETTING THIS ACROSS THE    

408
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,250
FINISH LINE, AND ANOTHER THING  
COMING HERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A  

409
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,853
BIG PUSH ON TAX REFORM.         
WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM PUT OUT

410
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,422
A BUNCH OF DETAILS ON TAX       
REFORM.                         

411
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,457
HE WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND      
SUPPORT.                        

412
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,727
LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE OF THE   
PAPERS RIGHT NOW.               

413
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:42,199
WE'RE SEEING SEEING AGAIN, LIKE 
YOU SAID, THE SPATS AND THESE   

414
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,035
ARE NOT THINGS THAT REPUBLICAN'S
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.             

415
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,640
>> Shepard: REPUBLICANS MAY     
NOT WANT IT, RACHEL, BUT THIS   

416
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,576
THING, I READ THE EMAIL.        
I HAVE TWITTER, I LET THEM TAKE 

417
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,647
CARE OF IT.                     
IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT FOR HIS   

418
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,883
BASE, DISSES THE RED MEAT OF ALL
RED MEAT.                       

419
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:04,254
THEY ARE ABLE TO RECLAIM THIS?  
THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY, THEY WERE  

420
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,224
ATTACKING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM,  
ATTACKING THE TROOPS, ATTACKING 

421
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,627
THE FLAG.                       
NONE OF WHICH THEY ARE DOING.   

422
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,896
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.  
THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT RACIAL      

423
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,265
INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY, AND   
THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT THE THINGS  

424
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,637
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, AND
HE TURNS IT AROUND FOR HIS BASE.

425
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,674
IS THIS ALL A PLAY TO HIS BASE, 
AND COULD POSSIBLY BE SO THEY DO

426
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,310
NOT NOTICE, THERE IS NO         
HEALTH CARE AND NORTH KOREA IS  

427
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,980
THE BIGGEST MESS SINCE THE      
COLD WAR?                       

428
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:33,183
>> A DISTRACTION HE WANTS RIGHT 
NOW, RIGHT?                     

429
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,185
A PLACE TO A CORNER OF HIS BASE,
FRACTION.                       

430
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,354
I'LL TELL YOU I'LL TALK TO A    
REPUBLICAN ABOUT THIS COUPLE OF 

431
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,226
HOURS AGO.                      
THEY DO NOT SEE THIS HELPFUL AT 

432
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,830
ALL.                            
THESE PROTESTERS WERE A FEW     

433
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,933
PLAYERS COME AND THEY'RE BARELY 
GETTING ANY HEADLINES, AND THEN 

434
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:54,138
TRUMP ATTACKS THEM, AND ATTACKED
THE NFL, NEVER SINCE THEN, HE   

435
00:27:54,272 --> 00:28:00,377
RATCHETED IT UP SO YOU HAVE 200 
PLAYERS TAKING A KNEE OR BACK IN

436
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,680
THE LOCKER ROOM, NOT STANDING   
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND IT 

437
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:08,552
IS AN UGLY DISPUTE RIGHT NOW.   
PEOPLE IN GENERAL DO NOT LIKE IT

438
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,221
WHEN PEOPLE PROTEST THE         
NATIONAL ANTHEM.                

439
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,123
>> Shepard: THEY'RE NOT         
PROTESTING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. 

440
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:20,030
THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
>> IT HAS BECOME MORE ABOUT THE 

441
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:26,036
FLAG, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE THE    
FOLKS FEEL THE PRESIDENT IS     

442
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,706
GOADING BLACK FOOTBALL PLAYERS  
AFTER THE CHARLOTTESVILLE       

443
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,011
CONTROVERSY A FEW WEEKS LATER.  
IT'S BATTLEGROUND FOR           

444
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,813
REPUBLICANS.                    
>> Shepard: RACHEL BADE, GREAT  

445
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:39,183
TO SEE YOU FROM "POLTICO."      
KEEP IT UP.                     

446
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,419
MORE ON THE SHOWDOWN WITH       
NORTH KOREA AFTER THE           

447
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,421
WHITE HOUSE DISMISSES THE CLAIM 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS        

448
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,625
DECLARED WAR ON NORTH KOREA.    
THAT IS COMING UP IN 2 MINUTES  

449
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,796
PAIRED WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE
MAN WHO POLICE SAY SHOT PEOPLE  

450
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:56,500
INSIDE A CHURCH IN TENNESSEE.   
IN THE USHER WHO RISKED HIS LIFE

451
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,002
TO TAKE DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.    
THAT IS STRAIGHTAWAY.

    Accident Forgiveness.       

454
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,544
    So the incredibly minor     
 accident that I had tonight...

00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,712
   Four weeks
