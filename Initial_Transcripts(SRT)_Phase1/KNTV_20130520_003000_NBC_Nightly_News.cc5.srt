THEY COULD BE LARGE AND

MORE FREEDOM TO JUST SAY IT I'LL

551
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
JUST FIX IT WITH A PILL?

552
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
>> NO.

553
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THE NEW MANUAL DOESN'T GIVE THAT

554
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
KIND OF PERMISSION TO FIX IT

555
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
WITH A PILL AT ALL.

556
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
IT IS NOT A TREATMENT DOCUMENT.

557
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
NEVER WAS.
IT'S A COMMUNICATION DOCUMENT.

558
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> MAYBE WE CAN THINK ABOUT IT
DIFFERENTLY.

559
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
>> Reporter: A BRIGHT SPOT FOR

560
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
FAMILIES LIKE THE FINKLESTEINS,

561
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
NECESSARY CARE.

564
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
>> JUST BECAUSE IT'S GONE AWAY

565
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
IN THE BOOK DOESN'T MEAN IT IS

566
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
GOING AWAY IN REAL LIFE.

567
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000

JOURNEY TO HIS OWN STRUGGLES
GROWING UP.

584

>> WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY YOUNG

585
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
MEN IN OUR COMMUNITY CONTINUE TO

586
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
MAKE BAD CHOICES AND I HAVE TO

587
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
SAY, GROWING UP, I MADE QUITE A

588
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
FEW MYSELF.

589
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
SOMETIMES I WROTE OFF MY OWN

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
FAILINGS AS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE

591
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
OF THE WORLD TRYING TO KEEP A

592
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
BLACK MAN DOWN.

593
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I HAD A TENDENCY SOMETIMES TO

594
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
MAKE EXCUSES FOR ME NOT DOING

595
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
THE RIGHT THING.

596
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALL

597
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
OF YOU HAVE LEARNED OVER THE

598
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
LAST FOUR YEARS IS THERE'S NO

599
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
LONGER ANY ROOM FOR EXCUSES.

600
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
BE THE BEST HUSBAND TO YOUR

601
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
WIFE, OR YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR

602
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
PARTNER.

603
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
BE THE BEST FATHER YOU CAN BE TO

604
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
YOUR CHILDREN.

605
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
BECAUSE NOTHING'S MORE

606
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
IMPORTANT.

607
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
WHATEVER SUCCESS I HAVE

608
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
ACHIEVED, WHATEVER POSITIONS OF

609
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
LEADERSHIP I HAVE HELD, HAVE

610
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
DEPENDED LESS ON IVY LEAGUE

611
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
DEGREES OR S.A.T. SCORES OR GPAs

612
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
AND HAVE INSTEAD BEEN DUE TO

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
THAT SENSE OF CONNECTION AND

614
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
EMPATHY.

615
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
THE SPECIAL OBLIGATION I FELT AS

616
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
A BLACK MAN, LIKE YOU, TO HELP

617
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
THOSE WHO NEED IT MOST, PEOPLE

618
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAD.

619
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
BECAUSE THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE

620
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
OF GOD GO I, I MIGHT HAVE BEEN

621
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
IN THEIR SHOES.
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN PRISON.

622
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN UNEMPLOYED.

623
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

624
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
SUPPORT A FAMILY.

625
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
AND THAT MOTIVATES ME.

626
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SHARING IN A

627
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000

COMMUNICATING IN A SIMPLER WAY

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000

651
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
US FEEL SENTIMENTAL.

652

WORKPLACE.

656
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
THE AGE OF THE TYPEWRITER.

657
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
THE BRAND NAMES HAD GRAVITAS.

658
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000

669
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
LOVE THEIR TYPEWRITERS.

670
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000

COLLECTING A TYPEWRITER, YOU

687
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000

THAT'S IT.

706
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE, THIS IS

707
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
SO EASY.

708
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I WAS READY FOR THE SPEED

709
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000

A ROUGH START.

712

I'M ALREADY LOSING.

713
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.

714

OH, I RIPPED IT!

715
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
