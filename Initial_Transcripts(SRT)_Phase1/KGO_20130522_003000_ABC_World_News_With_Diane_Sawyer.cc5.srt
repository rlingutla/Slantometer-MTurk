00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
THE OPEN AREA IN THE MIDDLE,

191
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
PASSING THE CHILDREN OVER THE

192
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
RUBBLE.

193
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
UNLIKE PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY,

194
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
MORE TRADITIONAL WITH A LONG

195
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
LINE OF CLASSROOMS UNDER ONE

196
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ROOF.

197
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
WHEN IT COLLAPSED, THE ROOF AND

198
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
WALLS PILING ON TOP OF ONE

199
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
ANOTHER, NO OPENING IN THE

200
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
MIDDLE, LIKE THOSE PODS.

201
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TO CRAWL OUT FROM.

202
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
TONIGHT AS THEY CONTINUE TO

203
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
SEARCH THERE, AN HONEST FIRE
CHIEF.

204
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
>> NO SURVIVOR HAS BEEN FOUND

205
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
RECENTLY, IN THE LAST FEW HOURS.

206
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
>> Reporter: BUT FOR THAT

207
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
TEACHER WHOSE PRAYER WAS

208
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
ANSWERED, TONIGHT A PRAYER FOR

209
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THE TEACHERS AT THE OTHER

210
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
SCHOOL.
>> THE TEACHERS AT PLAZA TOWERS

211
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
DIDN'T HAVE THAT BLESSING.

212
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE NOT

213
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
BEING ABLE TO GIVE THOSE KIDS

214
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
BACK TO THEIR PARENTS THAT
BROUGHT THEM TO ME THAT MORNING.

215
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
>> Reporter: TONIGHT THAT

216
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
TEACHER THINKING ABOUT ALL THOSE

217
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
OTHER TEACHERS AT THE OTHER

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
SCHOOL.

219
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
AND WE LEARNED FROM THOSE TWO

220
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
TEACHERS EARLIER TODAY, DIANE,

221
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
THAT THERE WERE NO SAFE ROOMS IN

222
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
EITHER OF THOSE SCHOOLS.

223
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WHEN AUTHORITIES WERE ASKED

224
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ABOUT THAT LATE TODAY, THEY

225
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE SIMPLY

226
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ISN'T THE FUNDING TO PUT SAFE

227
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
ROOMS IN EVERY SCHOOL.

228
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE TWO SCHOOLS

229
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
WERE AMONG THOSE THAT WERE NOT

230
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
FUNDED.
A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO COME ON

231
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THAT.

232
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
>> YOU BET A LOT OF QUESTIONS

233
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WILL BE ASKED.
DAVID, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

234
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
FACT SO MANY PEOPLE VIDEOTAPED

235
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THE STORM

236
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WAS GOING OVERHEAD.

237
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
YOU MET WITH ONE OF THEM?

238
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
>> Reporter: THE EXTRAORDINARY

239
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
TAPE, THAT HUSBAND WHO WATCHED

240
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THE TORNADO COMING TOWARD HIS

241
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
HOUSE, TOWARD HIS FAMILY.

242
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
TODAY WE WENT TO MEET THEM.

243
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
HE TOOK ME DOWN THE STAIRWELL

244
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT SAVED HIS FAMILY'S LIFE.

245
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
IT IS THE VOICE YOU HEAR AS THAT

246
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
TORNADO IS ABOUT TO TOUCH DOWN

247
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
AND TAKE DIRECT AIM AT HIS HOME

248
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
AND HIS FAMILY.

249
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
[ SIRENS ]
HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN

250
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
WAITING IN THE STORM SHELTER,

251
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THEIR BUNKER.
AND TODAY WE WENT TO FIND THEM.

252
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THERE WAS JASON IN HIS FRONT

253
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
YARD.

254
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
NO HOME LEFT, BUT HE HAS HIS

255
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
FAMILY AND HE SHOWED US WHY.

256
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
TAKING US DOWN INTO HIS CONCRETE

257
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
STORM SHELTER WHERE THEY WERE

258
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
HUDDLED.

259
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> YOU COULD SEE THE PRESSURE OF

260
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THE TORNADO AGAINST THE METAL?

261
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> YEAH, THE METAL WAS POPPING

262
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
IN AND OUT.

263
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
>> Reporter: THAT METAL DOOR
BUCKLING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF

264
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
THE TORNADO.
YOU HAVE LANTERNS?

265
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
>> WE HAVE LAN TERNS AND ANOTHER

266
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
INTERESTING THING, LAPTOPS WHILE

267
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
WE WERE IN HERE.

268
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
HE TOLD ME THE CHILDREN QUIETLY

269
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
CRYING, THE FAMILY MOUTHING
THEIR WORDS TO EACH OTHER,

270
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE ON THEIR

271
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
EARS, THEY COULDN'T HEAR A

272
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THING.
>> I CAN REACH OUT AND TOUCH

273
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
BOTH WALLS WITH MY FINGERS.
NOT A HUGE SPACE.

274
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
SUDDENLY SILENCE.

275
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
IT WAS OVER.

276
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
HE SHOWS US HOW HE OPENED THAT

277
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
DOOR AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAW

278
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
WHEN HE WALKED OUT.

279
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> I WANT YOU TO STAY.

280
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> OKAY.

281
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> THE LORD GIVETH, AND THE LORD

282
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
TAKETH AWAY.

283
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> Reporter: REALLY

284
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
EXTRAORDINARY.

285
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THEY SAY IT WENT COMPLETELY

286
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SILENT IN THAT BUNKER WHEN THE

287
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
TORNADO STOPPED DOING ITS

288
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
DAMAGE.

289
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
WE MET HIS WIFE TODAY, GIANT

290
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
SMILE ON HER FACE, EVEN THOUGH

291
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
SHE HAS NO HOME LEFT, SHE HAS
HER FAMILY.

292
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
AND SHE FOUND THE BABY ALBUMS

293
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WHILE WE WERE THERE, ALL BECAUSE

294
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
THE FAMILY WAS SAFE INSIDE THAT

295
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
BUNKER, I COULD REACH OUT AND

296
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
TOUCH EACH SIDE.
>> ALL RIGHT, DAVID MUIR

297
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
REPORTING.

298
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I HAVE ANOTHER BEHIND THE

299
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
PICTURE IMAGE TONIGHT.

300
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
IN FACT, YOU SHOWED US THE

301
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ICONIC SCENE, THE MOTHER AND

302
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
FATHER WALKING.

303
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
SHE'S BLOODIED.

304
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
THEY'RE WALKING AWAY FROM BRIAR

305
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH TOOK A

306
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
DIRECT HIT.

307
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
THEY ARE THE COBB FAMILY, LA

308
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
DONNA AND STEVE.
SHE HAS A BADLY BRUISED EYE AND

309
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
FACE, BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.

310
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
EARLIER I SPOKE TO THEM ABOUT
WHAT THEY DID.

311
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> I JUST TRIED TO BE THE BEST

312
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
DAD I COULD AT THAT TIME.

313
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I WANTED HER TO FEEL SAFE AND

314
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE OKAY.

315
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I WISHED I COULD HAVE SPLIT

316
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
MYSELF INTO TWO AND STAYED THERE

317
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
AND TRIED TO HELP OUT SOME OF

318
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THOSE OTHER KIDS, BECAUSE I CAN

319
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
IMAGINE HOW THEY WERE FEELING AT

320
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THAT TIME.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEIR PARENTS

321
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
WEREN'T THERE, KIND OF WANDERING

322
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AROUND.

323
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
IT'S LIKE BEING IN A MOVIE, AND

324
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY'S PLAYING A

325
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
PART.

326
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
WE'RE ALL ACTING OR SOMETHING

327
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
LIKE THAT.

328
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IT'S JUST NOT -- DOESN'T SEEM

329
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
REAL TO YOU THAT THIS IS
OCCURRING.

330
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
>> AND JORDAN, HOW LONG DID THAT

331
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
TORNADO SEEM TO LAST FOR YOU?

332
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
>> FOREVER.

333
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS LIKE AN

334
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
HOUR.

335
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
LIKE, IT WAS CRAZY.

336
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE WE

337
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
SURVIVED THAT.

338
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
>> I WAS JUST GRABBING ON TO
WHATEVER I COULD.

339
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
ONCE THE ROOF LIFTED OFF OF THE

340
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
BUILDING, I FELT MYSELF BEING

341
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
SUCKED, AND I KNEW THAT IF I WAS

342
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
TAKEN, THEN ALL THE LITTLE

343
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BABIES UNDERNEATH ME WOULD BE

344
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
GONE TOO.

345
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SO I JUST HELD ON.

346
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE UNTIL

347
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THE WALL FELL ON TOP OF ME AND

348
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
KNOCKED ME OUT.

349
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
>> I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE OTHER

350
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
-- I COULDN'T LEAVE THE OTHER

351
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
KIDS.
THEY ALL ARE SPECIAL TO ME.

352
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AND I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.

353
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
AND I WANTED MY FAMILY TO BE

354
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
SAFE, BUT I ALSO WANTED

355
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
EVERYBODY ELSE'S FAMILY TO BE

356
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
SAFE TOO.

357
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
>> WHAT WAS THE HARDEST MOMENT

358
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
FOR YOU, JORDAN?

359
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
>> JUST WHEN I WAS LIKE, I TRIED

360
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
TO GET UP AND I TRIED TO MOVE

361
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE BRICKS OFF OF MY LEG, AND IT

362
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
HURT SO MUCH, AND I WAS LIKE --

363
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
AND IT WAS DURING -- THE TORNADO

364
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
HAD NOT LEFT YET.

365
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I WAS JUST SCREAMING, HELP,

366
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
MY LEG, MY LEG, AND NO ONE COULD

367
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
HEAR ME.
>>SET

368
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
>> YEAH.

369
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
>> WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

370
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THING ABOUT FAMILY TO YOU?

371
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
>> THAT WE'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR

372
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
