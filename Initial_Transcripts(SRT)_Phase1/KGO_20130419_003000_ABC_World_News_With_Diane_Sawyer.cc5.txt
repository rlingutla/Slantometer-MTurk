[000:02:35;488] WITH A WHITE CAP WORN BACKWARDS.
[000:02:37;123] BOTH WEARING BACKPACKS THAT THE
[000:02:38;024] FBI BELIEVE HELD THE BOMBS.
[000:02:40;994] OFF TO THE SIDE OF THIS VIDEO,

[000:02:50;870] POTENTIAL SUSPECTS, THE ONE WITH
[000:02:52;505] THE WHITE CAP, WAS ACTUALLY SEEN
[000:02:53;573] PLACING HIS BACKPACK AT THE

[000:03:12;659] DANGEROUS MEN.
[000:03:14;794] >> WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE ARMED

[000:03:23;269] SOME OF THE COMPONENTS,
[000:03:24;337] INCLUDING THIS BATTERY, AND THIS
[000:03:25;905] CIRCUIT BOARD, WERE RECOGNIZED
[000:03:27;507] BY HOBBYISTS AS PARTS OF A TOY
[000:03:29;676] REMOTE CONTROL CAR, SIMILAR TO
[000:03:31;244] THIS ONE SEEN IN AN ONLINE

[000:03:45;625] THE COMPONENTS WAS A RADIO
[000:03:46;326] RECEIVER.
[000:03:49;362] THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS DEAD ON.
[000:03:51;464] >> Reporter: THERE ARE
[000:03:52;498] INSTRUCTIONS ON THE INTERNET

[000:04:01;541] COOKBOOK" AND SEVERAL JIHADIST
[000:04:02;609] SITES AS WELL.
[000:04:03;643] THERE IS STILL NO INDICATION OF
[000:04:04;711] WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACT OF
[000:04:05;778] FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM,
[000:04:07;347] BUT THE PRESIDENT VOWED TODAY
[000:04:08;414] THE BOMBERS, WHOEVER THEY ARE,
[000:04:09;482] WILL NOT ESCAPE.
[000:04:11;084] >> YES, WE WILL FIND YOU.

[000:05:32;398] SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE WOULD
[000:05:33;099] NOTICE.
