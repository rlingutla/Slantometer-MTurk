[000:04:24;897] ATTACK HAVE STILL NOT BEEN
[000:04:25;698] VERIFIED.
[000:04:28;568] FROM THE SYRIAN REGIME DENIALS,
[000:04:30;136] AS THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WHICH
[000:04:31;371] FOR A YEAR HAS CALLED THE USE OF

[000:04:43;316] RICHARD ENGEL JOINS US NOW WITH

[000:04:56;362] WE SPOKE TO.
[000:04:58;064] AND AGAIN, THESE IMAGES ARE
[000:04:58;731] GRAPHIC.
[000:05:00;600] THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT BOMBED
[000:05:03;636] VILLAGES OUTSIDE DAMASCUS TODAY,
[000:05:05;338] THE SAME VILLAGES HIT YESTERDAY
[000:05:06;572] BY WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WAR CRIME.
[000:05:08;274] AN OUTRAGE.
[000:05:09;342] HUNDREDS KILLED BY CHEMICAL
[000:05:10;543] WEAPONS, THE REBELS SAY, MANY OF

[000:05:20;353] LOOKING AT AN EXPLODED ROCKET.
[000:05:22;288] NEAR IT, DEAD BODIES.
[000:05:25;325] NBC NEWS HAS NO WAY TO CONFIRM
[000:05:26;893] THAT THE CASUALTIES WERE CAUSED
[000:05:28;594] BY THIS WEAPON.
[000:05:31;364] THERE IS STILL NO DEFINITIVE
[000:05:32;699] PROOF THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE
[000:05:33;900] USED OR BY WHOM.
[000:05:37;670] BUT HOW CAN ANYONE FAKE ROWS OF
[000:05:38;538] DEAD CHILDREN?
[000:05:40;340] NO APPARENT INJURIES.
[000:05:41;808] NO BLOOD.
[000:05:43;609] JUST LIFELESS BODIES, THEIR ARMS
[000:05:44;577] FOLDED.
[000:05:48;314] SO MANY THEY'RE NOT EVEN NAMED,
[000:05:49;515] BUT NUMBERED.
[000:05:51;617] THIS IS BABY 11 FROM THE VILLAGE
[000:05:53;653] OF DUMA, THE NUMBER WRITTEN ON A
[000:05:55;955] BURIAL SHROUD.
[000:05:59;592] IN SYRIA OUTRAGES HAVE LONG GONE

[000:06:07;467] DEAD, NEARLY 2 MILLION REFUGEES.
[000:06:09;035] >> THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT.
[000:06:12;538] THERE IS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF
[000:06:13;272] THE TUNNEL.

[000:06:22;348] CONSIDERED.
[000:06:24;517] ARMING THE REBELS.
[000:06:26;452] BUT WASHINGTON WORRIES, WHO
[000:06:27;787] WOULD GET THE WEAPONS?
[000:06:29;756] THE REBELS ARE DIVIDED WITH SOME
[000:06:31;424] LINKED TO AL QAEDA.
[000:06:32;992] WHAT ABOUT A MILITARY INVASION?
[000:06:35;194] U.S. BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
[000:06:37;230] FOR WAR-WEARY AMERICANS, THAT'S
[000:06:38;097] NOT EVEN UNDER CONSIDERATION.
[000:06:41;868] TODAY A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION
[000:06:46;806] OFFICIAL SAID THE U.S. MUST BE,
[000:06:47;540] QUOTE, HUMBLE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN
[000:06:48;274] AND CANNOT DO.
[000:06:48;741] AND WITH ASSAD BACKED BY RUSSIA,
[000:06:53;012] IRAN, AND HEZBOLLAH, THERE IS
[000:06:55;515] LITTLE THE WORLD CAN DO.
[000:06:56;282] THE U.N. HAS PROVEN TO BE
[000:06:57;817] UTTERLY POWERLESS.
[000:07:00;620] IT HAS INSPECTORS IN DAMASCUS
[000:07:02;054] RIGHT NOW, JUST A FEW MILES FROM
[000:07:03;656] WHERE SO MANY DIED YESTERDAY,

[000:07:08;361] WORST ATROCITY IN SYRIA'S
[000:07:12;098] ATROCIOUS WAR.
[000:07:14;667] IT'S UNCLEAR, LESTER, IF THIS
[000:07:15;501] WILL BE A TURNING POINT OR JUST
[000:07:17;437] ANOTHER HORROR IN A WAR NO ONE
[000:07:21;641] WANTS TO -- SEEMS TO WANT TO
[000:07:22;375] HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH.
[000:07:23;109] LESTER?

[000:08:16;028] U.S. SECRETS IN HISTORY.
[000:08:18;231] BUT IT APPEARS MANNING HAD ONE
[000:08:18;965] LAST SECRET LEFT.
[000:08:23;536] JUST ONE DAY AFTER BRADLEY
[000:08:26;939] MANNING WAS SENTENCED TO 35
[000:08:28;508] YEARS IN A MILITARY PRISON, THE

[000:08:58;671] FOR LEAKING U.S. SECRETS AS
[000:09:00;106] PROOF OF TRANSGENDER ISSUES.
[000:09:01;307] BUT MANNING WANTS TO TAKE IT ONE

[000:09:45;384] >> Reporter: BUT THERE'S ALSO
[000:09:46;752] CONCERN ABOUT MANNING'S SAFETY.
[000:09:52;892] THE ARMY REPORTS THAT
[000:09:53;626] TRANSGENDER PRISONERS ARE MORE
[000:09:54;727] LIKELY TO BE ASSAULTED BY OTHER
[000:09:56;896] INMATES.
[000:09:57;863] OFFICIALS AT LEAVENWORTH INSIST
[000:09:59;198] THEY'VE TAKEN STEPS TO PROTECT
[000:10:00;299] THOSE PRISONERS LIKE MANNING WHO
[000:10:03;569] MAY BE AT HIGH RISK.
[000:10:04;103] AS FOR THE NAME CHANGE, THE
[000:10:04;770] ARMY'S NOT BUYING IT.
[000:10:06;606] LETTERS SENT TO MANNING AT FT.
[000:10:07;673] LEAVENWORTH HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED
[000:10:09;008] TO BRADLEY.
[000:10:09;742] CHELSEA WON'T MAKE IT.
[000:10:10;343] LESTER?

[000:10:14;981] THANK YOU.
[000:10:15;681] >>> NOW TO A BIG MYSTERY THIS
[000:10:16;382] EVENING AFTER HOURS OF CHAOS ON
[000:10:17;149] WALL STREET.
[000:10:18;117] A GLITCH THAT HALTED TRADING ON
[000:10:19;819] THE NATION'S SECOND LARGEST
[000:10:21;754] STOCK EXCHANGE WHERE PEOPLE
[000:10:22;421] TRADE HUGE COMPANIES LIKE APPLE
[000:10:23;155] AND FACEBOOK.
[000:10:24;924] EXPERTS ARE CALLING IT
[000:10:26;492] UNPRECEDENTED, AND TONIGHT IT'S
[000:10:27;693] RAISING A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
[000:10:30;596] CNBC'S BRIAN SULLIVAN IS LIVE AT
[000:10:32;164] THE NASDAQ WITH LATE DETAILS ON
[000:10:32;898] ALL OF THIS.
[000:10:33;299] BRIAN, WHAT HAPPENED?
[000:10:35;301] >> WELL, LESTER, WHAT HAPPENED
[000:10:38;170] WAS WHAT BEGAN AS A RELATIVELY
[000:10:39;772] SLOW SUMMER DAY TURNED INTO
[000:10:40;439] ANYTHING BUT.
[000:10:41;907] RIGHT AROUND 12:30 EASTERN TIME,
[000:10:44;410] AN UNEXPECTED HALT TO TRADING
[000:10:45;111] BEGAN.
[000:10:46;712] YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE NAMES.
[000:10:47;480] APPLE, YOU'VE GOT GOOGLE,
[000:10:48;180] MICROSOFT, EVEN FACEBOOK.
[000:10:49;982] IT WAS A GLITCH, AND WE'VE
[000:10:50;716] FINALLY GOTTEN A STATEMENT FROM
[000:10:52;418] THE NASDAQ ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,
[000:10:55;154] BUT THEY DID NOT GO INTO DETAIL
[000:10:57;256] ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
[000:10:58;257] ALL WE KNOW IS THAT STOCK
[000:11:00;793] TRADING FOR NASDAQ-LISTED STOCKS
[000:11:01;527] DID CEASE FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS
[000:11:02;728] TODAY.
[000:11:05;531] NOW, PRICES IN THE NAMES THAT
[000:11:08;100] YOU MENTIONED, THOSE NAMES WERE
[000:11:10;636] NOT IMPACTED.
[000:11:11;170] AND WITH ABOUT 30 MINUTES LEFT
[000:11:12;338] TO GO IN TRADING THERE WAS A
[000:11:13;039] RESUMPTION.
[000:11:13;606] HOWEVER, MANY MARKET
[000:11:14;173] PARTICIPANTS ARE CALLING THIS
[000:11:14;874] YET ANOTHER BLACK EYE FOR NOT
[000:11:15;574] ONLY THE NASDAQ BUT FOR THIS
[000:11:17;710] HIGHLY TECHNICAL STYLE OF
[000:11:18;344] TRADING THAT WE HAVE DRIVEN
[000:11:19;011] INTO.
[000:11:22;782] REMEMBER WITH FACEBOOK AND THEIR
[000:11:24;617] IPO THERE WAS A PROBLEM.
[000:11:25;451] WE HAD, OF COURSE, THE BIG FLASH
[000:11:26;419] CRASH ON MAY 6th IN 2010.
[000:11:30;056] SO MANY SAYING THAT WHILE
[000:11:30;923] UNDERLYING PRICES, LESTER, MAY
[000:11:31;757] NOT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED, IT IS
[000:11:32;992] YET PERHAPS ANOTHER BLACK EYE TO
[000:11:35;394] ELECTRONIC TRADING AS WELL AS
[000:11:36;095] CONFIDENCE.
[000:11:36;962] I SHOULD NOTE, THE DOW, S&P AND
[000:11:41;434] NASDAQ ACTUALLY ALL DID END THE
[000:11:42;601] DAY HIGHER.
[000:11:43;302] BACK TO YOU.

[000:15:18;450] >> Reporter: IT'S BEEN LESS THAN
[000:15:19;418] THREE WEEKS SINCE HANNAH
[000:15:20;519] ANDERSON WAS ABDUCTED BY FAMILY
[000:15:21;487] FRIEND JAMES DiMAGGIO.
[000:15:25;357] >> THIS GENTLEMAN THAT WAS A
[000:15:26;825] FRIEND OF OURS FOR A LONG TIME
[000:15:27;793] HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING.
[000:15:30;329] >> Reporter: HANNAH DIDN'T HAVE
[000:15:31;063] ANY IDEA THERE WAS AN AMBER
[000:15:32;398] ALERT STRETCHING ACROSS THE
[000:15:33;332] WEST.
[000:15:34;199] >> I LOVE HER DEARLY.
[000:15:35;034] >> Reporter: SHE DIDN'T KNOW
[000:15:36;135] DiMAGGIO HAD ALREADY KILLED HER
[000:15:39;038] MOTHER AND 8-YEAR-OLD BROTHER,
[000:15:39;772] ETHAN.
[000:15:43;509] >> HE HAD A REALLY BIG HEART
[000:15:44;710] AND --
[000:15:48;747] >> Reporter: THE FAMILY HAD
[000:15:49;815] CLEARLY TRUSTED THE MAN THEY
[000:15:51;183] CALLED UNCLE JIM.
[000:15:52;718] AT HIS BURNED-OUT HOME
[000:15:53;585] INVESTIGATORS FOUND LETTERS
[000:15:55;387] HANNAH WROTE TO HIM.
[000:15:58;857] >> THE LETTERS WERE FROM LIKE A
[000:16:00;459] YEAR AGO WHEN ME AND MY MOM
[000:16:01;593] WEREN'T GETTING ALONG VERY WELL.
[000:16:03;529] ME AND HIM WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW
[000:16:04;263] TO DEAL WITH IT.
[000:16:05;798] >> Reporter: DiMAGGIO WOULD
[000:16:06;465] OFTEN GIVE HANNAH RIDES TO AND
[000:16:07;266] FROM ACTIVITIES.
[000:16:09;568] THAT, SHE EXPLAINS, IS WHY THE
[000:16:11;370] TWO EXCHANGED 13 TEXT MESSAGES
[000:16:12;705] ON THE DAY OF HER KIDNAPPING.
[000:16:14;039] >> HE WAS PICKING ME UP FROM
[000:16:16;475] CHEER CAMP, AND HE DIDN'T KNOW
[000:16:17;443] THE ADDRESS.
[000:16:19;979] >> Reporter: BUT AFTER PICKING
[000:16:21;180] HER UP, HE DROVE HER TO THIS
[000:16:22;765] REMOTE PART OF IDAHO WHERE A
[000:16:23;482] GROUP OF HORSEBACK RIDERS SAW
[000:16:24;350] THE ODD COUPLE AND ALERTED
[000:16:25;050] AUTHORITIES.
[000:16:25;918] >> I DON'T KNOW IF WE SAVED HER
[000:16:27;853] LIFE.
[000:16:29;054] I KNOW WE SET THE STAGE FOR
[000:16:32;091] SOMEBODY ELSE TO SAVE HER LIFE.
[000:16:33;058] >> I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU
[000:16:35;494] BECAUSE WITHOUT THEM I PROBABLY
[000:16:36;228] WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.
[000:16:37;062] >> Reporter: WITHIN DAYS, HANNAH
[000:16:39;231] APPEARED AT A CAR WASH
[000:16:40;799] FUND-RAISER FOR HER FAMILY,
[000:16:41;667] POSTED PHOTOS AND MESSAGES
[000:16:42;868] ONLINE.
[000:16:45;771] >> IT JUST HELPS ME GRIEVE, LIKE
[000:16:46;872] POST PICTURES AND TO SHOW HOW
[000:16:47;840] I'M FEELING.
[000:16:49;174] AND I'M A TEENAGER.
[000:16:51;343] I'M GOING TO GO ON IT.
[000:16:52;544] >> Reporter: BUT THAT OPENED HER
[000:16:54;413] UP TO JUDGMENT FROM COMPLETE
[000:16:55;114] STRANGERS.
[000:16:57;049] >> I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE COULD BE
[000:16:57;883] SO CRUEL.
[000:17:01;520] THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW THE
[000:17:02;354] STORY, SO THEY KIND OF HAVE
[000:17:03;022] THEIR OWN OPINION ON WHAT THEY
[000:17:03;756] HEAR.
[000:17:04;690] >> Reporter: EVEN TODAY, WHILE
[000:17:05;424] SOME OFFERED PRAYERS AFTER
[000:17:06;392] SEEING HANNAH ON THE "TODAY"
[000:17:07;726] SHOW, MANY WERE SKEPTICAL.
[000:17:12;064] HANNAH SAYS HER MOTHER RAISED
[000:17:12;765] HER TO BE STRONG.
[000:17:13;365] >> THIS WAS A HARD TIME, AND
[000:17:14;233] THERE'S GOING TO BE HARDER TIMES
[000:17:14;967] IN LIFE.
[000:17:17;970] BUT IF I COULD GET THROUGH THIS,
[000:17:18;704] I'M SURE I CAN GET THROUGH A LOT
[000:17:19;705] MORE.
[000:17:21;740] >> Reporter: WHEN WE ASK WHAT
[000:17:22;441] SHE'S LEARNED, SHE HINTS AT PAIN
[000:17:23;342] AND REGRET.
[000:17:25;644] >> TO JUST NOT HOLD A GRUDGE
[000:17:26;578] BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
[000:17:27;246] SOMEONE CAN BE GONE.
[000:17:31;183] >> Reporter: HANNAH SAYS SHE'S
[000:17:32;251] GETTING READY TO GO BACK TO HIGH
[000:17:33;485] SCHOOL THE DAY AFTER LABOR DAY.
[000:17:35;187] IT WILL BE OVERWHELMING, SHE
[000:17:36;288] SAYS, BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE NOW
[000:17:37;356] KNOW HER STORY AND ARE SO
[000:17:39;658] VOCALLY CRITICAL OF HER.
[000:17:41;360] BUT SHE SAYS HER FRIENDS HAVE
[000:17:43;896] HER BACK AND, LESTER, ONE THING
[000:17:45;831] SHE EMPHASIZED IS THAT SHE DOES
[000:17:46;799] NOT WANT ANYONE TO SEE HER AS A
[000:17:48;000] VICTIM BUT AS A SURVIVOR.
[000:17:49;068] LESTER?
[000:17:49;802] >> WELL, SHE IS STRONG AND
[000:17:50;469] CERTAINLY A REMARKABLE YOUNG
[000:17:51;170] LADY.
[000:17:51;470] KATE SNOW, THANKS.
[000:17:53;205] AND "DATELINE" WILL HAVE A FULL
[000:17:54;873] HOUR ON THIS CASE TOMORROW NIGHT
[000:17:56;108] AT 9:00/8:00 CENTRAL.

[000:21:06;098] >>> WHEN HE STARTED THE JOB AS
[000:21:07;666] HEAD OF THE FBI, NOBODY
[000:21:11;069] INCLUDING ROBERT MUELLER HIMSELF
[000:21:12;037] EVER IMAGINED WHAT WAS ABOUT TO
[000:21:12;771] HAPPEN JUST A WEEK LATER.
[000:21:14;339] IT CHANGED AMERICA, THE FBI, AND
[000:21:16;742] THE WORLD.

[000:21:28;820] >> Reporter: ROBERT MUELLER

[000:21:35;627] OF AGENTS ASSIGNED TO TERRORISM.
[000:21:36;862] BUT SOME QUESTIONED THE STING
[000:21:38;797] CASES, PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED
[000:21:40;098] ONLY A DESIRE TO ATTACK.
[000:21:40;832] >> I WOULD ASK A DIFFERENT
[000:21:42;067] QUESTION.
[000:21:43;135] HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN THAT PERSON
[000:21:45;203] WHO HARBORS THE INTENT TO KILL
[000:21:46;772] AMERICAN CITIZENS IS GOING TO
[000:21:50;208] MOVE FROM HARBORING THE INTENT
[000:21:50;942] TO ACTUALLY PICKING UP A PISTOL
[000:21:52;344] AND KILLING 13 PEOPLE?
[000:21:52;944] >> I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR PICTURE
[000:21:54;780] IN THE LOBBY OUT HERE, AND YOU
[000:21:55;981] HAVE MORE GRAY HAIR NOW THAN YOU
[000:21:57;683] DID WHEN YOU BECAME DIRECTOR.
[000:21:59;484] >> I'LL ALSO MENTION, SO DO YOU.
[000:22:01;053] >> ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH.
[000:22:03;155] >> Reporter: HE SAYS IT'S BEEN
[000:22:04;256] AN INTENSE 12 YEARS AND
[000:22:05;424] REMEMBERS THE TOUGHEST TIMES.
[000:22:07;959] >> THE HARDEST DAYS THAT YOU
[000:22:09;194] HAVE ARE THOSE WHEN YOU LOSE AN
[000:22:10;028] AGENT IN THE COURSE OF DUTY.
[000:22:12;197] >> Reporter: AND THE MOMENTS OF
[000:22:13;432] UNCERTAINTY, LIKE THE CHAOTIC
[000:22:14;132] HOURS AFTER THE BOSTON MARATHON
[000:22:14;866] BOMBING.
[000:22:21;273] >> THE INVESTIGATION HAD MORE
[000:22:22;007] TWISTS AND TURNS IN THAT VERY
[000:22:22;708] SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAN IN
[000:22:23;408] MANY INVESTIGATIONS.
[000:22:23;975] YOU WERE UP IN THE AIR IN TERMS
[000:22:24;810] OF WHETHER YOU WERE DOING THE
[000:22:25;510] RIGHT THING, MAKING THE RIGHT
[000:22:26;211] DECISIONS.
[000:22:26;845] >> Reporter: AS FOR THREATS,
[000:22:27;579] MUELLER SAYS CONCERN REMAINS
[000:22:29;414] HIGH THAT TERROR GROUPS MIGHT
[000:22:30;248] TARGET AN AIRLINER USING
[000:22:31;216] IMPLANTED EXPLOSIVES.
[000:22:32;184] ARE YOU GOING TO MISS ALL THIS?
[000:22:34;252] >> YES.
[000:22:35;587] GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT CHALLENGE.
[000:22:39;324] IT'S BEEN A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

[000:22:47;699] IN WESTERN RUSSIA IT WAS A QUIET
[000:22:52;037] DAY AT THE BEACH.
[000:22:52;904] SUDDENLY, THIS SHOWED UP, AN
[000:22:55;307] AMPHIBIOUS LANDING CRAFT THAT
[000:22:56;775] SEEMED TO BE COMING IN FOR THAT
[000:22:57;743] LANDING AT FULL SPEED.
[000:22:58;343] SUNBATHERS SCRAMBLED TO GET OUT
[000:22:59;077] OF THE WAY.
[000:22:59;678] THEY WERE SURPRISED.
[000:23:00;779] NOBODY WAS INJURED, THOUGH.
[000:23:01;880] RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SAY THE SHIP
[000:23:03;448] WAS ON A REGULAR TRAINING
[000:23:04;383] EXERCISE.
[000:23:05;250] >>> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
[000:23:05;851] INCREDIBLE VIDEO FROM THE

[000:23:21;233] IT HAS SINCE GROWN TO AT LEAST
[000:23:21;967] 24 ACRES, NOW FILLED WITH WATER.
[000:23:23;769] >>> WHEN WE COME BACK, A YOUNG
[000:23:24;503] LADY WITH A NEED FOR SPEED.
[000:23:26;938] NO WONDER.
[000:23:27;305] IT'S IN HER BLOOD.
[000:26:18;410] >>> FINALLY TONIGHT, A YOUNG
[000:26:21;646] LADY WITH A LEGENDARY NAME NOW
[000:26:23;214] GOING INTO THE FAMILY BUSINESS.
[000:26:24;816] MORE THAN 12 YEARS AGO WHEN THE
[000:26:26;618] GREAT DALE EARNHARDT DIED IN A
[000:26:28;920] CRASH AT THE DAYTONA 500, HE WAS
[000:26:30;355] JUST 49 YEARS OLD, AND HIS
[000:26:36;695] GRANDDAUGHTER CARSON WAS JUST 5
[000:26:37;429] MONTHS OLD.
[000:26:37;829] TONIGHT, NBC'S KATY TUR

[000:26:48;039] 12-YEAR-OLD CARSON MAY LOOK LIKE
[000:26:49;641] YOUR TYPICAL PRETEEN.

[000:26:53;244] SNAPPING SELFIES.
[000:26:54;512] BUT ON THE INSIDE, SHE'S AN
[000:26:55;480] EARNHARDT, RACE CAR ROYALTY.
[000:26:56;548] DALE EARNHARDT WAS HER
[000:26:59;818] GRANDFATHER, DALE JR. IS HER
[000:27:00;518] UNCLE.
[000:27:01;052] >> IT'S LIKE I'VE GOT CARS GOING
[000:27:01;786] THROUGH MY BLOOD VEINS.
[000:27:02;387] I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT IT'S
[000:27:03;121] TRUE.
[000:27:04;322] >> Reporter: PEDAL TO THE METAL,
[000:27:06;725] 45 MILES AN HOUR ON A DIRT
[000:27:07;926] TRACK.
[000:27:09;527] WHY DO YOU LIKE RACING SO MUCH?
[000:27:10;261] >> I LIKE RACING BECAUSE I LIKE
[000:27:10;996] GOING FAST.
[000:27:11;396] >> YOU LIKE A LITTLE DANGER.

[000:27:16;434] RACING WITH HER DAD.
[000:27:18;370] CALL IT HER SUMMER SCHOOL.
[000:27:20;305] >> I KNEW THAT MY GRANDFATHER
[000:27:23;108] AND MY UNCLE WERE RACE CAR
[000:27:24;643] DRIVERS, FAMOUS ONES, BUT IT
[000:27:26;945] DIDN'T ALL START REALLY SINKING
[000:27:32;584] IN AND I DIDN'T START REALLY
[000:27:33;551] THINKING ABOUT IT UNTIL I WAS
[000:27:34;252] 11.
[000:27:35;053] >> SHE REMINDS ME OF MY DAD AND
[000:27:35;920] ESPECIALLY HER AGGRESSIVE NATURE
[000:27:36;655] ON THE TRACK.
[000:27:38;089] >> Reporter: CARSON HAS
[000:27:38;690] LITERALLY GROWN UP ON THE
[000:27:41;126] TRACKS, BUT A FEW YEARS AGO SHE
[000:27:42;460] DECIDED IT WAS TIME SHE TOOK THE
[000:27:43;194] WHEEL, RACING AND WINNING WITH
[000:27:43;928] HER GRANDDAD'S LEGENDARY NUMBER
[000:27:44;663] 3.
[000:27:46;931] NICKELODEON NOTICED IN JUNE AND

[000:27:51;536] HERE CARSON IS UNRIVALED BY BOTH
[000:27:52;971] THE GIRLS AND THE BOYS.
[000:27:53;805] ARE THEY INTIMIDATED BY YOU, DO
[000:27:54;539] YOU THINK?
[000:27:56;608] >> PROBABLY.
[000:27:58;209] MOST LIKELY.
[000:27:59;744] >> Reporter: WHY IS THAT?

[000:28:03;381] >> GO GET THEM, GIRL.
[000:28:03;948] >> THANK YOU.
[000:28:05;216] >> Reporter: TONIGHT'S RACE IS
[000:28:07;385] HER LAST BEFORE SCHOOL, AND SHE
[000:28:11;623] IS LAPPING THE COMPETITION UNTIL
[000:28:14;526] CARSON CLIPS ANOTHER CART AND
[000:28:15;260] GOES HEADFIRST INTO THE WALL.
[000:28:16;361] A SCARY MOMENT FOR THE PRE-TEEN,
[000:28:21;433] EVEN SCARIER FOR MOM, WHO RAN TO
[000:28:22;167] HER SIDE.
[000:28:23;001] BUT CARSON WAS OKAY, ONE CRASH
[000:28:23;735] NOT ENOUGH TO STOP HER FROM
[000:28:24;402] RACING.
[000:28:25;070] >> ACCIDENTS CAN HAPPEN
[000:28:27;839] ANYWHERE, AND YOU CAN'T LIVE
[000:28:28;573] LIFE IN A BUBBLE TRYING TO
[000:28:29;441] PREVENT SOMETHING FROM HAPPENING
[000:28:30;508] OR YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE WHAT
[000:28:31;476] LIFE IS ABOUT.
[000:28:32;677] >> Reporter: BY MONDAY, THE
[000:28:34;279] CRASH IS OLD NEWS.
[000:28:36;214] FOR NOW, IT'S BACK TO SCHOOL BUT

[000:28:54;999] WE HOPE TO SEE YOU RIGHT BACK
[000:28:55;700] HERE TOMORROW EVENING.
[000:28:56;901] GOOD NIGHT.
[000:29:24;062] >>> NBC BAY AREA NEWS STARTS
[000:29:28;099] NOW.
[000:29:28;733] >>> THANKS FOR JOINING US.
[000:29:34;506] >>> WE BEGIN WITH A DEVELOPING
[000:29:36;808] STORY WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR
[000:29:38;376] DAYS.
[000:29:38;843] WE SHOW YOU THIS WILDFIRE STILL
[000:29:41;346] BURNING NEAR YOSEMITE.
[000:29:42;981] RIGHT NOW IT IS TWICE THE SIZE
[000:29:44;883] OF SAN FRANCISCO.
[000:29:46;251] IT'S FORCED THE GOVERNOR TO
[000:29:48;253] DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO
[000:29:49;387] HE CAN FREE UP MONEY AND ALSO SO
[000:29:51;689] HE CAN FREE UP RESOURCES.
[000:29:53;291] WE TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THIS FIRE
[000:29:54;859] WAS AT 5% CONTAINED.
[000:29:57;896] BUT IT BLEW UP OVERNIGHT.
[000:30:02;767] AT THIS POINT, THOUSANDS OF
[000:30:04;369] AT RISK.
[000:30:06;638] NBC'S JODI HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN
[000:30:09;374] FOLLOWING THE FIRE.
[000:30:10;041] >> Reporter: FIREFIGHTERS ARE
[000:30:11;743] THROWING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE AT
[000:30:12;610] THIS FIRE, BUT THEY'VE MADE
[000:30:13;978] LITTLE PROGRESS.
[000:30:14;712] TO SAY THAT THE FIRE CONDITIONS
[000:30:16;447] ARE EXTREME OUT HERE IS A MAJOR
[000:30:18;716] UNDERSTATEMENT.
[000:30:19;551] FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING THE
[000:30:20;952] HEAT, THE WIND, AND A FIRE THAT
[000:30:23;021] THEY SAY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN.
[000:30:26;224] NOW FIREFIGHTERS ARE ACTUALLY
[000:30:28;526] LOSING GROUND TODAY.
[000:30:29;427] YESTERDAY THEY HAD THE FIRE 5%
[000:30:31;863] CONTAINED.
[000:30:32;697] TODAY, THAT HAS SLIPPED BACK TO
[000:30:34;399] JUST 2%.
[000:30:35;700] MORE THAN÷fx 54,000 ACRES HAVE
[000:30:38;203] BURNED.
[000:30:38;503] AND THAT FIGURE IS MOST
[000:30:40;338] DEFINITELY IS GOING TO GO UP
[000:30:42;040] WHEN THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO UP
[000:30:44;142] AND DO AN AERIAL SURVEY.
[000:30:46;277] ABOUT 1500 HOMES REMAIN
[000:30:48;613] THREATENED AND HUNDREDS OF
[000:30:49;547] PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EVACUATED.
[000:30:51;616] THE FIRE HAS CROSSED HIGHWAY 120
[000:30:54;652] SEVERAL TIMES.
[000:30:55;887] WE SAW CREWS WORKING TO REMAYOR
