[000:03:11;057] WAS IN SOME PLACES EVEN STRONGER
[000:03:12;959] AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN FIRST
[000:03:14;027] THOUGHT, A PROMISE FROM
[000:03:15;828] AUTHORITIES HERE.
[000:03:16;963] TO SEARCH EVERY HOME HERE IN
[000:03:19;032] MOORE, OKLAHOMA, THREE TIMES
[000:03:20;166] BEFORE GIVING UP.

[000:03:22;335] ANOTHER VISIT TO THE HOME RIGHT
[000:03:23;102] HERE BESIDE US.
[000:03:23;903] AND AT THE PLAZA TOWERS
[000:03:24;971] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THEY'RE STILL
[000:03:26;039] SEARCHING.
[000:03:27;106] THOUGH AUTHORITIES WON'T SAY FOR
[000:03:28;174] SURE IF THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE
[000:03:29;776] ANY CHILDREN STILL INSIDE.

[000:03:59;806] BOY TO CONSOLE HIM.
[000:04:01;374] AND THERE WAS THIS FATHER AS
[000:04:02;075] PANICKED AS ANY PARENT WOULD BE.
[000:04:04;310] >> SHE'S OUT?
[000:04:09;282] >> Reporter: HE WOULD SOON FIND
[000:04:11;317] HER.

[000:04:13;086] SHE JUST WOULDN'T LET GO OF THAT
[000:04:16;456] DESK.
[000:04:16;889] >> THE TORNADO WENT IN AND I WAS
[000:04:18;691] SO AFRAID THAT I WAS HANGING ON
[000:04:20;159] TO ONE OF THE DESKS.
[000:04:21;527] AND THEN, UM, I FELL BACK, AND
[000:04:24;530] ALL THE DIRT THAT GOT IN MY EYES
[000:04:25;632] AND I FELL.
[000:04:27;233] >> Reporter: THE COUNTLESS

[000:04:32;171] PARENTS.
[000:04:33;606] >> ALL FIFTH GRADERS RIGHT HERE!
[000:04:37;277] >> Reporter: TONIGHT A CLEARER
[000:04:38;411] PICTURE OF THE MOMENTS BEFORE
[000:04:39;979] THE TORNADO TOOK AIM AT TWO
[000:04:40;680] DIFFERENT SCHOOLS.
[000:04:42;081] AT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY, THEY
[000:04:43;149] ALL GOT OUT.
[000:04:44;751] CINDY LOWE TEACHES FIRST GRADE.
[000:04:46;886] SHE OPENED HER DOOR AND SAW THE
[000:04:47;954] TORNADO COME.
[000:04:50;790] YOU SAW IT COMING RIGHT AT YOU?
[000:04:52;992] >> COMING RIGHT FOR THE SCHOOL.
[000:04:54;794] RAN OVER AND GOT ON TOP OF THE
[000:04:55;561] KIDS.
[000:04:56;195] SAID THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
[000:04:57;797] >> Reporter: ONE OF THOSE
[000:04:58;498] CHILDREN, HER OWN SON.
[000:05:03;069] HER BODY ON TOP OF HIS AND
[000:05:05;605] SEVERAL OTHERS AS THEY CRIED FOR
[000:05:06;939] THEIR MOMS.
[000:05:07;440] >> THEY HAD DESKS AND CHAIRS AND
[000:05:08;241] TABLES COVERING THEM.
[000:05:08;875] >> Reporter: AND TEACHER?
[000:05:09;542] >> AND TEACHER.
[000:05:10;109] >> Reporter: JUST ACROSS THE
[000:05:11;678] WAY, SHERRY URGED HER FIRST
[000:05:12;712] GRADERS TO USE THEIR BACKPACKS
[000:05:14;314] AS SHIELDS.
[000:05:16;449] >> THEY WERE COVERING THEIR
[000:05:18;584] HEADS WITH THEIR BACKPACKS.
[000:05:20;186] >> Reporter: WHAT WERE THE KIDS
[000:05:21;220] SAYING DURING ALL THIS?
[000:05:22;288] >> I WANT MY MOM.
[000:05:23;323] >> Reporter: THEIR SCHOOL IS
[000:05:24;023] DESTROYED TOO.
[000:05:25;458] HOW DID ALL THE CHILDREN THERE
[000:05:27;026] GET OUT WHEN SOME OF THE
[000:05:30;863] STUDENTS AT PLAZA TOWERS DID
[000:05:34;667] NOT?
[000:05:35;068] SHE BELIEVES IT WAS BECAUSE HER
[000:05:39;972] SCHOOL WAS CONSTRUCTED
[000:05:40;973] DIFFERENTLY.
[000:05:41;474] EACH GRADE ORGANIZED INTO PODS,
[000:05:42;241] A FEW CLASSROOMS IN EACH
[000:05:42;909] BUILDING.
[000:05:43;409] AT THE CENTER OF THOSE BUILDINGS
[000:05:44;110] AN OPENING TO THE OUTDOORS.
[000:05:45;578] WHEN EVERYTHING COLLAPSED, THEY
[000:05:46;646] WERE ABLE TO CRAWL OUT THROUGH
[000:05:47;680] THE OPEN AREA IN THE MIDDLE,
[000:05:48;748] PASSING THE CHILDREN OVER THE
[000:05:49;449] RUBBLE.
[000:05:50;383] UNLIKE PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY,
[000:05:51;984] MORE TRADITIONAL WITH A LONG
[000:05:53;553] LINE OF CLASSROOMS UNDER ONE
[000:05:54;587] ROOF.
[000:05:56;222] WHEN IT COLLAPSED, THE ROOF AND
[000:05:57;790] WALLS PILING ON TOP OF ONE
[000:05:58;858] ANOTHER, NO OPENING IN THE
[000:06:00;426] MIDDLE, LIKE THOSE PODS.
[000:06:04;831] TO CRAWL OUT FROM.
[000:06:05;398] TONIGHT AS THEY CONTINUE TO
[000:06:06;132] SEARCH THERE, AN HONEST FIRE
[000:06:06;866] CHIEF.
[000:06:07;300] >> NO SURVIVOR HAS BEEN FOUND
[000:06:08;201] RECENTLY, IN THE LAST FEW HOURS.
[000:06:12;739] >> Reporter: BUT FOR THAT
[000:06:13;873] TEACHER WHOSE PRAYER WAS
[000:06:16;275] ANSWERED, TONIGHT A PRAYER FOR
[000:06:17;009] THE TEACHERS AT THE OTHER
[000:06:19;412] SCHOOL.
[000:06:19;846] >> THE TEACHERS AT PLAZA TOWERS
[000:06:22;648] DIDN'T HAVE THAT BLESSING.
[000:06:25;752] AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE NOT
[000:06:28;855] BEING ABLE TO GIVE THOSE KIDS
[000:06:32;058] BACK TO THEIR PARENTS THAT
[000:06:32;792] BROUGHT THEM TO ME THAT MORNING.
[000:06:34;761] >> Reporter: TONIGHT THAT
[000:06:35;595] TEACHER THINKING ABOUT ALL THOSE
[000:06:36;662] OTHER TEACHERS AT THE OTHER
[000:06:37;330] SCHOOL.
[000:06:38;231] AND WE LEARNED FROM THOSE TWO
[000:06:39;332] TEACHERS EARLIER TODAY, DIANE,
[000:06:40;366] THAT THERE WERE NO SAFE ROOMS IN
[000:06:42;001] EITHER OF THOSE SCHOOLS.
[000:06:43;569] WHEN AUTHORITIES WERE ASKED
[000:06:44;637] ABOUT THAT LATE TODAY, THEY
[000:06:45;705] ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE SIMPLY
[000:06:46;739] ISN'T THE FUNDING TO PUT SAFE
[000:06:47;807] ROOMS IN EVERY SCHOOL.
[000:06:50;443] ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE TWO SCHOOLS
[000:06:51;511] WERE AMONG THOSE THAT WERE NOT
[000:06:53;112] FUNDED.
[000:06:53;646] A LOT OF QUESTIONS TO COME ON
[000:06:54;380] THAT.
[000:06:57;383] >> YOU BET A LOT OF QUESTIONS
[000:06:58;117] WILL BE ASKED.
[000:06:58;684] DAVID, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
[000:06:59;552] FACT SO MANY PEOPLE VIDEOTAPED
[000:07:01;053] WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THE STORM
[000:07:02;121] WAS GOING OVERHEAD.
[000:07:03;189] YOU MET WITH ONE OF THEM?
[000:07:06;392] >> Reporter: THE EXTRAORDINARY
[000:07:07;460] TAPE, THAT HUSBAND WHO WATCHED
[000:07:08;528] THE TORNADO COMING TOWARD HIS
[000:07:09;595] HOUSE, TOWARD HIS FAMILY.
[000:07:11;197] TODAY WE WENT TO MEET THEM.
[000:07:13;332] HE TOOK ME DOWN THE STAIRWELL
[000:07:14;934] THAT SAVED HIS FAMILY'S LIFE.
[000:07:19;172] IT IS THE VOICE YOU HEAR AS THAT
[000:07:20;273] TORNADO IS ABOUT TO TOUCH DOWN
[000:07:21;340] AND TAKE DIRECT AIM AT HIS HOME
[000:07:22;375] AND HIS FAMILY.
[000:07:28;181] [ SIRENS ]
[000:07:28;714] HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN
[000:07:29;415] WAITING IN THE STORM SHELTER,
[000:07:30;149] THEIR BUNKER.
[000:07:30;883] AND TODAY WE WENT TO FIND THEM.
[000:07:31;951] THERE WAS JASON IN HIS FRONT
[000:07:32;652] YARD.
[000:07:34;587] NO HOME LEFT, BUT HE HAS HIS
[000:07:36;222] FAMILY AND HE SHOWED US WHY.
[000:07:38;291] TAKING US DOWN INTO HIS CONCRETE
[000:07:39;859] STORM SHELTER WHERE THEY WERE
[000:07:40;626] HUDDLED.
[000:07:41;994] >> YOU COULD SEE THE PRESSURE OF
[000:07:43;629] THE TORNADO AGAINST THE METAL?
[000:07:47;567] >> YEAH, THE METAL WAS POPPING
[000:07:49;469] IN AND OUT.
[000:07:50;002] >> Reporter: THAT METAL DOOR
[000:07:50;736] BUCKLING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF
[000:07:51;471] THE TORNADO.
[000:07:51;971] YOU HAVE LANTERNS?
[000:07:53;973] >> WE HAVE LAN TERNS AND ANOTHER
[000:07:55;875] INTERESTING THING, LAPTOPS WHILE
[000:07:57;376] WE WERE IN HERE.
[000:08:02;281] HE TOLD ME THE CHILDREN QUIETLY
[000:08:03;082] CRYING, THE FAMILY MOUTHING
[000:08:03;850] THEIR WORDS TO EACH OTHER,
[000:08:04;584] BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE ON THEIR
[000:08:05;384] EARS, THEY COULDN'T HEAR A
[000:08:06;085] THING.
[000:08:06;552] >> I CAN REACH OUT AND TOUCH
[000:08:07;286] BOTH WALLS WITH MY FINGERS.
[000:08:07;987] NOT A HUGE SPACE.
[000:08:12;158] SUDDENLY SILENCE.
[000:08:13;526] IT WAS OVER.
[000:08:14;093] HE SHOWS US HOW HE OPENED THAT
[000:08:15;528] DOOR AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAW
[000:08:17;530] WHEN HE WALKED OUT.
[000:08:18;898] >> I WANT YOU TO STAY.
[000:08:23;803] >> OKAY.
[000:08:25;004] >> THE LORD GIVETH, AND THE LORD
[000:08:26;772] TAKETH AWAY.
[000:08:27;507] >> Reporter: REALLY
[000:08:28;140] EXTRAORDINARY.
[000:08:29;108] THEY SAY IT WENT COMPLETELY
[000:08:30;676] SILENT IN THAT BUNKER WHEN THE
[000:08:31;744] TORNADO STOPPED DOING ITS
[000:08:32;445] DAMAGE.
[000:08:34;413] WE MET HIS WIFE TODAY, GIANT
[000:08:35;515] SMILE ON HER FACE, EVEN THOUGH
[000:08:37;083] SHE HAS NO HOME LEFT, SHE HAS
[000:08:37;850] HER FAMILY.
[000:08:40;753] AND SHE FOUND THE BABY ALBUMS
[000:08:42;288] WHILE WE WERE THERE, ALL BECAUSE
[000:08:43;923] THE FAMILY WAS SAFE INSIDE THAT
[000:08:46;225] BUNKER, I COULD REACH OUT AND
[000:08:47;393] TOUCH EACH SIDE.
[000:08:47;960] >> ALL RIGHT, DAVID MUIR
[000:08:48;628] REPORTING.
[000:08:49;128] THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[000:08:49;929] I HAVE ANOTHER BEHIND THE
[000:08:51;531] PICTURE IMAGE TONIGHT.
[000:08:53;132] IN FACT, YOU SHOWED US THE
[000:08:54;233] ICONIC SCENE, THE MOTHER AND
[000:08:55;234] FATHER WALKING.
[000:08:56;302] SHE'S BLOODIED.
[000:08:58;938] THEY'RE WALKING AWAY FROM BRIAR
[000:09:00;540] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH TOOK A
[000:09:01;274] DIRECT HIT.
[000:09:06;345] THEY ARE THE COBB FAMILY, LA
[000:09:07;079] DONNA AND STEVE.
[000:09:07;947] SHE HAS A BADLY BRUISED EYE AND
[000:09:09;015] FACE, BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.
[000:09:10;082] EARLIER I SPOKE TO THEM ABOUT
[000:09:10;816] WHAT THEY DID.
[000:09:11;684] >> I JUST TRIED TO BE THE BEST
[000:09:12;785] DAD I COULD AT THAT TIME.
[000:09:15;421] I WANTED HER TO FEEL SAFE AND
[000:09:17;023] THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE OKAY.
[000:09:19;959] I WISHED I COULD HAVE SPLIT
[000:09:21;761] MYSELF INTO TWO AND STAYED THERE
[000:09:23;296] AND TRIED TO HELP OUT SOME OF
[000:09:25;932] THOSE OTHER KIDS, BECAUSE I CAN
[000:09:27;166] IMAGINE HOW THEY WERE FEELING AT
[000:09:29;468] THAT TIME.
