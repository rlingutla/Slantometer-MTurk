>> YES, HE WILL BE MAKING BRIEF 

66
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,981
REMARKS.                        
IT'S A FIVE NETWORK POOL.       

67
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,518
IT'S UNDERSTAND, CNN, ABC AND   
CBS AND US.                     

68

WE WERE HOPING HE WOULD COME

69
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,793
THOUGHTS ABOUT TODAY AND MAYBE

71
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,801

BUT HE HAD A LOT OF COMPANY WITH

72
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,940
HIM ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE.     
KEVIN McCARTHY WAS WITH HIM,

SENATOR HELLER AND HIS WIFE,    
MELANIA WAS THERE WITH HIM.     

74
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,016
SO THE PRESIDENT STAYED IN THE  
FORWARD CABIN.                  

75
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,253
YOU CAN SEE THE BREAK-UP.       
IT'S A UNIT THAT OPERATES ON    

76

00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,335
CONNECTIVITY AND THE PICTURE    
GOES FUZZY LIKE THAT.           

80
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,339

IMMEDIATE PICTURES FROM         

81
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,009

WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TOO.       

82
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,046
LATER ON WHEN WE GET THE        
FEEDBACK OVER THE SATELLITE,    

83
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,249
YOU'LL SEE THE PICTURES IN THE  
ENTIRETY AND CLARITY.           

84
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:22,721
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE     
SPECIAL MENTION, SHEP, I'M TOLD 

85
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,724

OF THEM DID DIE DOING THIS,     

88
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,936
PROTECTED OTHER PEOPLE,

THESE ARE CITIZEN HEROS, SHEP

92
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,947
WE'LL SEE THEM IN A COUPLE      
MINUTES.                        

93
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,584
HE'S TOURING THE COMMAND CENTER 
THERE WITH THE SHERIFF WHO HAS  

94
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,822
DONE AMAZING WORK IN THE WAKE OF
THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.          

95
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:17,876
YOU CAN IMAGINE, YOU CAN        
PROBABLY COUNT ON ONE HAND THE  

96
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,910
NUMBER OF HOURS OF SLEEP HE'S   
HAD.                            

97
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,379
THE PRESIDENT TAKING THE TOUR OF
THE COMMAND CENTER, MEETING WITH

98
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,847
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE'LL  
HEAR FROM HIM SHORTLY WHERE HE  

99
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,281
WILL PAY TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE   
MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

100
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,750
THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE
AND THE CIVILIANS THAT DID THE  

101
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,650
SAME THING SUNDAY NIGHT.        
SHEP?                           

102
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,618
>> Shepard: JOHN, THANKS SO     
MUCH.                           

103
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,186
THE ROOM BEGINNING TO FILL WHERE
THE PRESIDENT WILL GREET THOSE  

104
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,287
FOLKS.                          
THEY'VE BEEN FILLING IN THE DOOR

105
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:34,393
ON THE LEFT TO OUR LEFT SIDE OF 
THAT -- THE BLUE WALL BACK      

106
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:40,465
THERE, THE BLUE CURTAIN.        
YOU'LL SEE MORE COMING IN NOW.  

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,833
IT'S OUR BELIEF THE PRESIDENT IS
ON HIS WAY RIGHT NOW.           

108
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,770
THE OTHER STORY OF THE DAY HAS  
BEEN THE REPORTS ON SECRETARY   

109
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,472
TILLERSON.                      
IT WAS BACK IN THE SUMMER THAT  

110
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:53,111
CNN REPORTED AND NBC REPORTED   
OVERNIGHT AND INTO THIS MORNING,

111
00:06:53,246 --> 00:07:01,119
I THINK THEY DEBUTED IT ON      
MORNING JOE, THAT REX TILLERSON 

112
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,388
SAID I'M DONE, I'M GOING TO     
TEXAS.                          

113
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,292
BUT THE PRESIDENT INTERVENED IN 
SOME WAY AND IT NEVER HAPPENED. 

114
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:13,432
NOW SECRETARY TILLERSON HAS SAID
NONE OF THAT HAPPENED, IT'S FAKE

115
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:14,332
NEWS.                           
NBC NEWS STANDS BY ITS          

116
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:19,004

WITH THAT, WE RETURNED TO A.B.  

117
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:23,875
STODDARD.                       
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF    

118
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,144
THIS.                           
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I   

119
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,015
TRIED TO QUIT AROUND HERE.      
EVERYBODY HAS BAD DAYS.         

120
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:34,653
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF    
THIS.                           

121
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,390
SECRETARY TILLERSON SAYS IT'S   
FAKE NEWS.                      

122
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,926
NBC NEWS STANDS BY IT.          
I DON'T KNOW WHO TO MAKE OF IT. 

123
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,465
>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF        
REPORTING BETWEEN THE TENSION OF

124
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,732
THE WEST WING AND THE WHITE     
HOUSE.                          

125
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,168
REX TILLERSON WAS THE MOST      
POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD, HEAD 

126
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:57,709
OF EXXON MOBIL.                 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE REPORTERS

127
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,112
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND ASKING HIM 
QUESTIONS IN HIS OLD LIFE ABOUT 

128
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,049
GLOBAL CONFRONTATIONS, HAVING TO
DO WITH NATIONAL SECURITY.      

129
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:09,154
HE'S NOT TOTALLY AT EASE IN ALL 
THE ASPECTS OF THE JOB BUT HE   

130
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,591
MADE COMMENTS TODAY THAT WERE   
VERY COMPELLING ABOUT HIS       

131
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:18,463
COMMITMENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND 
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND THAT 

132
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:19,498
AS A TEAM THEY'LL STICK         
TOGETHER.                       

133
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,000
THEY'VE HAD SUCCESS.            
                                

134
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:26,838
HE COMPLIMENTED NIKKI HALEY THAT
SAID WOULD REPLACE HIM IF HE    

135
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,807
LEFT.                           
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT     

136
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,877
WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS BEEN      
PERFORMING A JOB THAT PRESIDENT 

137
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,380
TRUMP APPROVES OF.              
THAT HE'S BEEN SLOW TO HIRE --  

138
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:41,019
>> Shepard: THAT WAS THE POINT. 
>> HE'S NOT DOING THINGS THE WAY

139
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,189
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS HIM  
TO BE DOING THEM.               

140
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:50,896
BUT ALL THIS GOSSIP ABOUT WHAT  
HE'S CALLED THE PRESIDENT AND   

141
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,397
ALL OF THAT STUFF OBVIOUSLY GETS
TO THE TOP OF THE HEADLINES.    

142
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,332
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY        
SITUATION.                      

143
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:59,838
ALSO BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SENT 
OUT A TWEET UNDERMINING HIM     

144
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,375
SAYING HIS WASTING HIS TIME IN  
CHINA TALKING ABOUT HOW WE HAVE 

145
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,344
PASSIVE NEGOTIATION OR DIALOGUE 
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.         

146
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:12,050
HE'S WORKING ON A DIPLOMATIC    
SOLUTION TO A GRAVE CRISIS.     

147
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:16,254
MANY PEOPLE SAID ON SUNDAY LIKE 
RICHARD HAAS, REPUBLICAN FOREIGN

148
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:23,261
POLICY EXPERT WITH EXPERIENCE,  
THAT REX TILLERSON SHOULD RESIGN

149
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,730
AFTER THE WAY THE PRESIDENT     
SPOKE ABOUT HIM.                

150
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:30,201
IT'S OBVIOUSLY FILLED WITH      
TENSION AND THEY BOTH SOUNDED   

151
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,372
LIKE THEY WANT TO WORK.         
THE VERY UPBEAT IS HONORED BY   

152
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,108
TILLERSON'S COMMENTS, BUT       
THERE'S MORE BEHIND THE SCENES  

153
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,077
THAN WE UNDERSTOOD.             
>> Shepard: THERE'S A LOT THERE.

154
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:43,748
WE HEAR FROM THE STATE          
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS THAT       

155
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,185
THERE'S GREAT CONCERN AND GREAT 
FRUSTRATIONS THAT THE POSITIONS 

156
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,423
HAVE NOT BEEN FILLED.           
ON THE MATTER OF THE PRESIDENT'S

157
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:56,995
TWEET REGARDING SECRETARY       
TILLERSON IN NORTH KOREA, THE   

158
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,463
PRESIDENT SAID DON'T WASTE YOUR 
TIME, SECRETARY TILLERSON.      

159
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,465
WE'RE GOING TO NEED WHAT NEEDS  
TO BE DONE.                     

160
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,834
IN OTHER WORDS, STOP YOUR       
DIPLOMACY.                      

161
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,669
IT'S HIS JOB TO HEAD UP THE     
DIPLOMACY.                      

162
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,773
A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE 
VERY UPSET ABOUT WHAT IT WAS    

163
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,810
THAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETED      
BECAUSE IF HE MEANT IT, IT'S    

164
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,713
HARD TO SAY THAT HE MEANT       
ANYTHING OTHER THAN WE'RE GOING 

165
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,716
DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.       
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT  

166
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,952
SOMETHING AGGRESSIVE.           
>> ALSO JUST WHAT IT SHOWS TO   

167
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,822
THE CHINESE WHEN REX TILLERSON  
AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IS    

168
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:29,361
OVER IN CHINA DOING THIS VERY   
DIFFICULT WORK.                 

169
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,797
THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE WORK.    
WHAT IT SHOWS WITH THE PRESIDENT

170
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:37,602
UNDERMINING HIM AND THROWING HIM
UNDER THE BUS AND UNDERMINING   

171
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,173
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIPLOMACY     
SENDS A WORRISOME SIGNAL ABOUT  

172
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,342
HOW HE'S TREATING REX TILLERSON 
AND HOW HE'S HANDLING THE       

173
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:49,447
PROCESS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE'S   
ASKING THE CHINESE TO DO TO TRY 

174
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,850
TO MITIGATE THE THREAT OF NORTH 
KOREA.                          

175
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,153
WE VERY MUCH OBVIOUSLY DEPEND ON
THE CHINESE IN THIS SITUATION.  

176
00:10:55,287 --> 00:11:01,493
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO HIS CREDIT   
HAS GOTTEN THE CHINESE          

177
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,028
GOVERNMENT TO STOP ALL CENTRAL  
BANK ACTIVITY WITH THE NORTH    

178
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:03,962
KOREANS.                        
THAT'S A HUGE STEP.             

179
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,165
IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE  
GREAT -- COULD BE CONSEQUENTIAL 

180
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,636
IF THEY ACTUALLY ENFORCE IT.    
BUT IT'S A REAL QUESTION ABOUT  

181
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,573
NOT ONLY TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP WHEN
HE DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT     

182
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,944
TWEET, BUT HOW LONG PEOPLE THAT 
WORK UNDERNEATH HIM AND REPORT  

183
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,616
TO HIM CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO 
DO THEIR JOBS IF THEY'RE TREATED

184
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,818
THAT WAY.                       
THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL JOB.     

185
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,087
BEING SECRETARY OF STATE AND    
TRYING TO HANDLE THE NORTH KOREA

186
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:34,192
CRISIS IS AT THE TOP OF THE     
LIST.                           

187
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,360
>> Shepard: THERE'S A LOT ON THE
PLATE TODAY.                    

188
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,828
NOW THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE    
ROUNDS OUT IN LAS VEGAS AND     

189
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,398
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS   
GUN CONTROL AT A LATER DAY.     

190
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,002
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT    
SUGGESTED OVER TIME PRESIDENT   

191
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:49,107
TRUMP THAT USED TO BE MUCH MORE 
LIBERAL IN MANHATTAN WAS --     

192
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,811
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE FOR GUN    
CONTROL AT A TIME BEFORE HIS    

193
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,579
PRESIDENCY.                     
I KNOW BECAUSE I READ THE MAIL  

194
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:59,684
AND STUFF THAT THERE'S A LOT OF 
CONSERVATIVES CONCERNED THAT HE 

195
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:06,691
MIGHT BECOME MORE PRO GUN       
CONTROL IN THE DAYS AHEAD.      

196
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,159
>> THE SUPPORTERS THAT PUT      
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN OFFICE ARE   

197
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,929
LITTLE CONCERNED THAT HE'S NOT  
GOTTEN OUT OF THE TRADE         

198
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,398
AGREEMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE TRANS 
PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.            

199
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,267
HE'S PUT MORE TROOPS IN         
AFGHANISTAN.                    

200
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:21,039
AND THAT HE WAS WILLING TO TALK 
ABOUT DOING AN AGREEMENT ON     

201
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,375
IMMIGRATION WITH THE DEMOCRATIC 
LEADERS IN CONGRESS.            

202
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,680
SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN     
ABOUT HIS UNPREDICTABILITY AND  

203
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,983
WHETHER OR NOT HE IS MORE TO A  
SET OF IDEALOGICAL PRINCIPLES   

204
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,385
THAT HE WILL STICK TO AS        
PRESIDENT.                      

205
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,358
HE'S ON THE RECORD IN THE PAST  
BEING SUPPORTING GUN CONTROL.   

206
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,827
HE'S A WILD CARD, SHEP.         
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL      

207
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,565
HAPPEN WITH HIM.                
IF HE CREATES A BRIDGE,         

208
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,967
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN.         
>> Shepard: WE'LL SEE.          

209
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,137
HE SAYS HE WILL DISCUSS IT IN   
THE DAYS AHEAD.                 

210
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,707
AS THAT HAPPENS, WE'LL FOLLOW   
THE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY COME.  

211
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,244
IN ONCE AGAIN, FOX TELEVISION   
STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION WILL 

212
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,447
JOIN US RIGHT NOW.              
GOOD AFTERNOON FROM FOX NEWS IN 

213
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,916
NEW YORK.                       
I'M SHEPARD SMITH.              

214
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:16,728
THE PRESIDENT THIS AFTERNOON IS 
IN LAS VEGAS WHERE HE'S ABOUT TO

215
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,096
MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS.     
THESE ARE POLICE CHIEFS, FIRE   

216
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,497
OFFICIALS AND OTHERS THAT WERE  
INSTRUMENTAL IN ENDING THE      

217
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,899
MASSACRE THAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE  
THE MANDALAY BAY AND LUXOR      

218
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,669
HOTELS ON THE STRIP DURING THE  
COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL.         

219
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,238
59 KILLED.                      
A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DEATH  

220
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,142
TOLL.                           
THE GUNMAN DIED, ACCORDING TO   

221
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:35,513
AUTHORITIES, KILLED HIMSELF.    
THERE'S 59 OTHERS THAT HAVE DIED

222
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,918
AS ANOTHER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL.
THAT BRINGS THE DEATH TOLL TO   

223
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,823
59.                             
MORE THAN 540 INJURED.          

224
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,291
THE PRESIDENT SPREADING THE LOVE
OF THE PEOPLE AND THANKS FROM   

225
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,792
THE WHITE HOUSE AND FROM THE    
AMERICAN FEEL IN LAS VEGAS.     

226
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,329
ABOUT A MINUTE AGO, WE GOT A    
TWO-MINUTE WARNING ON THIS.     

227
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:55,200
OUR VIEWERS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL 
HAVE BEEN LISTENING DELONG AS WE

228
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,236
DISCUSS THE OTHER NEWS ITEMS OF 
THE DAY.                        

229
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,772
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR.   
WE'VE SEEN HIM AT THREE         

230
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,909
DIFFERENT APPEARANCES IN        
LAS VEGAS SINCE HE ARRIVED A FEW

231
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,478
SHORT HOURS AGO.                
HE AND THE FIRST LADY ARE THERE.

232
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:11,216
THE ORDER OF THE DAY HAS BEEN TO
THANK PEOPLE TO ALLOW THEM TO   

233
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,086
TELL THEIR STORIES OF WHAT      
HAPPENED DURING THE MASSACRE.   

234
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,890
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ORDINARY 
PEOPLE STEP FORWARD AND BECOME  

235
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,660
EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS OR WE 
LEARNED OF THEIR EXTRAORDINARY  

236
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,297
FORTITUDE AS THEY HELPED PEOPLE 
OUT, STORIES OF PEOPLE PUTTING  

237
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,767
FOLKS IN THE BACK OF THEIR      
TRUCKS TO TAKE THEM TO          

238
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,870
HOSPITALS.                      
PEOPLE PLUGGING WOUNDS, STOPPING

239
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,940
BLOOD FROM FLOWING OUT OF       
PEOPLE'S BODIES.                

240
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,644
THERE'S NO TELLING SPECIFICALLY 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SAVED AS A 

241
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,814
RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE 
THAT WERE NOT DOCTORS.          

242
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:49,888
THEY WERE JUST PEOPLE THAT      
STEPPED IN TO TRY TO HELP AT A  

243
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:50,989
MOMENT'S NOTICE.                
JOHN ROBERTS IS THERE.          

244
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,423
HE'S THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE      
CORRESPONDENT.                  

245
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,226
JOHN, A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED 
REST IN THAT CITY, ESPECIALLY   

246
00:14:55,361 --> 00:15:01,432
THE ONES WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO
HAVE BEEN MIGHTY GLAD TO SEE THE

247
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,401
PRESIDENT.                      
>> IT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL   

248
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:09,207
FATIGUE, EITHER.                
THE MENTAL FATIGUE AS WELL.     

249
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,943
LIVING EVERY DAY WITH WHAT      
HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT AND IT    

250
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,146
SPREADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.     
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD    

251
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:21,352
HAVE BEEN VISITORS FROM OUT OF  
TOWN HERE FOR THE WEEKEND AND   

252
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,088
JUST WANTED TO ENJOY SOME       
COUNTRY MUSIC AND JASON ALDEAN  

253
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,624
PACKING IN A CROWD OF 22,000    
PEOPLE.                         

254
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,962
YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT WAS GOING  
ON IN THE CONCERT WHEN FROM THE 

255
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:38,903
32nd FLOOR WINDOWS BEHIND ME,   
THIS GUY PADDOCK TOOK THE       

256
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,107
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT WERE 
CONVERTED TO FEAR NEW HAMPSHIRE 

257
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:47,078
AUTOMATIC RATE OF FIRE AND START
RAINING HELLFIRE DOWN UPON      

258
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,713
PEOPLE THERE JUST LISTENING TO  
MUSIC.                          

259
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:55,586
SO MANY OF THEM RAN FOR THE EXIT
AS YOU WOULD EXPECT AS MANY     

260
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,289
PEOPLE WOULD.                   
MANY OF THEM FELL TO THE GROUND 

261
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:03,761
MORE TALLY WOUNDED OR SERIALLY  
WOUNDED.                        

262
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:09,634
AND MANY DECIDED THEY WOULD     
STAND AND HELP PEOPLE.          

263
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,938
YOU CAN IMAGINE IN A STATE OF   
FEAR AND SHOCK THAT THEY WOULD  

264
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:18,910
DO THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY.       
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL  

265
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,446
PAY TRIBUTE TOO.                
>> Shepard: WE'RE WATCHING THE  

266
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:28,453
CROWD MAKE ITS WAY IN THE ROOM. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TOURING  

267
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,854
THE COMMAND FACILITY THERE.     
THIS IS A LAS VEGAS POLICE      

268
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,790
DEPARTMENT COMMAND FACILITY.    
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE  

269
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,560
INFORMATION FROM LAS VEGAS      
POLICE, AND THEY CALL THEM METRO

270
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,895
THERE, THAT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT, THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE  

271
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,332
THE CALLS WERE INCOMING.        
IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT ON  

272
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,401
THE PHONE CALLING THE POLICE    
DEPARTMENT.                     

273
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,904
AND THEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT  
ITSELF TRYING TO ORGANIZE ALL OF

274
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,310
THE FIRST RESPONDERS COMING.    
AT ONE POINT WE HEARD ON POLICE 

275
00:16:52,444 --> 00:17:00,385
RADIOS THEM TELLING PEOPLE TO   
GET OFF OF NORTH LAS VEGAS      

276
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,986
BOULEVARD BECAUSE THEY REALIZED 
WHERE THE SHOTS WERE COMING FROM

277
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,122
IN THE NORTH TOWER OF MANDALAY  
BAY.                            

278
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:08,226
BUT THE POLICE AT THE TIME SAID,
YOU KNOW, DON'T USE THAT HIGHWAY

279
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,963
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SIGHT OF HIM. 
THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT   

280
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,499
AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS ARRIVING 
TO HELP IN THIS SITUATION WOULD 

281
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,735
BECOME VICTIMS.                 
WE KNOW A NUMBER OF LAW         

282
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,372
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT WERE  
OFF DUTY AND AT THAT CONCERT    

283
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,942
WERE INJURED IN ONE WAY OR      
ANOTHER.                        

284
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:36,254
EIGHT I BELIEVE FROM THE STATE  
OF CALIFORNIA FROM DIFFERENT    

285
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,889
JURISDICTIONS.                  
DIFFERENT POLICE DEPARTMENTS    

286
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,458
WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE INJURED.  
THE AUTHORITIES TOLD US THIS    

287
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:45,229
MORNING THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE  
TO IDENTIFY ALL BUT THREE OF THE

288
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,365
VICTIMS.                        
SADLY THEY REPORTED TO US SOME  

289
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:54,806
OF THE VICTIMS WITH REALLY --   
WERE LEFT IN A POSITION TO      

290
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,908
IDENTIFY THEM.                  
AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING ON      

291
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,111
IDENTIFYING THREE OF THEM WHO   
DIED ON THAT FATEFUL NIGHT.     

292
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:05,750
IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL       
WORKERS WERE CONGRATULATED BY   

293
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,218
THE PRESIDENT AND THANKED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF THE      

294
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,854
AMERICAN PEOPLE.                
THEY DISCUSS HOW THE HALLWAYS,  

295
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:15,193
THE TRAUMA CENTER AND THE OTHER 
HOSPITALS IN THE AREA WERE JUST 

296
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,828
LITERALLY OVERFLOWING WITH      
PEOPLE.                         

297
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,331
MEDICAL -- SOME PEOPLE GETTING  
OUT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BEDS TO   

298
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:24,235
MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS THAT WERE  
MORE GRAVELY WOUNDED.           

299
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,839
THE SAME IN AMBULANCES AS THEY  
WERE LOADING PEOPLE IN          

300
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,509
AMBULANCES TO TAKE THEM TO      
HOSPITALS FROM THE SHOOTING     

301
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:41,052
SCENE.                          
WE GOT WORD OF I DON'T KNOW HOW 

302
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,453
MANY DOZENS OF PEOPLE THAT      
TRANSPORTED VICTIMS TO THE      

303
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,855
HOSPITALS IN VANS, TRUCKS.      
SOME PEOPLE INJURED THEMSELVES  

304
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,123
HELPING TO STOP THE BLEEDING OF 
OTHER PEOPLE.                   

305
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,193
THE STORIES ARE ENDLESS OF MAN  
AND WOMAN HELPING MAN AND WOMAN.

306
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,529
THERE WERE TEENAGERS INVOLVED   
THERE AS WELL.                  

307
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:56,501
A MATT RUSH TO TRY TO GET OUT.  
DIFFERENT PEOPLE TELLING STORIES

308
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,737
OF IF I DIDN'T KNOW TO CROUCH   
DOWN AND WAIT AND WAIT FOR      

309
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,374
INSTRUCTIONS OR BE RUNNING FOR  
THE EXITS WHERE THE HUGE CROWDS.

310
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:11,682
THINK OF WHEN YOU EXIT A CONCERT
VENUE HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO STAND

311
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,185
AND WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET UP   
THE AISLES IN CASES LIKE THAT   

312
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,055
WHERE THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SHOOTING DOWN FROM THE 32nd     

313
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,391
FLOOR.                          
WELL, THEY WERE IN MANY CASES   

314
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,793
JUST DEFENSELESS AND OUT IN THE 
WIDE OPEN.                      

315
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,463
CLAUDIA COWAN IS IN LAS VEGAS

CLAUDIA?

00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:37,441
>> WELL, WITH SHEPARD, EVERY    
STORY OF A VICTIM IS A LIFE CUT 

318
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:43,614
SHORT.                          
THERE WAS A MEMORIAL LAST NIGHT 

319
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:50,855
IN MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA FOR 
50-YEAR-OLD STACY ECHABAR.      

320
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:55,426
VINCENT PUT HIS WIFE IN A PLACE 
THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE SAFE   

321
00:19:55,561 --> 00:20:00,164
FOR HER WHILE HE HELPED OTHER   
PEOPLE TO SCRAMBLE FOR SAFETY.  

322
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,334
ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT SHE HAD
DIED.                           

323
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,938
I CAN TELL YOU A LAS VEGAS      
POLICE OFFICER THAT WAS OFF DUTY

324
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:12,677
OUT ENJOYING THE MUSIC SUNDAY   
NIGHT, HE PASSED AWAY AS WELL

BACK TO YOU.

LET'S LISTEN IN.                

328
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:23,321

THEY REACTED TO THIS SITUATION  

329
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:27,225
PROVIDED SO MANY LOVE AND CARE  
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HARMED 

330
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,597
BY THIS HORRIBLE INCIDENT.      
THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY, THOSE    

331
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,099
THAT CAME TO THE AID OF THESE   
PEOPLE.                         

332
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,637
THE EMPLOYEES AT MGM RESORTS AND
HOW THEY RESPONDED AS WELL.     

333
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,708
AND EVERYONE ELSE, PERFECT

334
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:48,379
TO THIS AND GAVE LOVE AND       
ASSISTANCE TO THEIR FELLOW MAN. 

335
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,782
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE 
FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND     

336
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:56,220
ACROSS THE WORLD FOR THEIR      
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT AND       

337
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:00,258
GENEROSITY THAT HAS COME HERE.  
IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR       

338
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,761
HISTORY.                        
MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT    

339
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:07,932
ALONE AND GIVES US STRENGTH.    
BRIEFLY I ATTENDED A CANDLELIGHT

340
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:12,603
VIGIL LAST NIGHT AT THE         
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA.           

341
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,807
IT WAS AN IMPROMPTU EVENT.      
OVER 1,500 PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON  

342
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:22,113
SHORT NOTICE.                   
WE ALL HELD CANDLES, WE ALL     

343
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,414
HUGGED ONE ANOTHER.             
WE HELD HANDS.                  

344
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,817
WE HELD THOSE FLAMES OUT IN     
FRONT OF US TO SHOW TRIBUTE TO  

345
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:33,257
THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES  
OF THIS HORRIBLE EVENT.         

346
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:41,599
AND TO -- AT THAT MOMENT,       
DESPITE HOW DARK AND COLD IT WAS

347
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,169
I SAW AND WE ALL SAW THE        
GREATEST DARKNESS CAN'T PUT OUT 

348
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:53,911
THE SMALLEST LIGHT.             
WE COLLECTIVELY FELT FOR THE    

349
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:54,979
FIRST TIME THE FIRST PANES OF   
HOPE.                           

350
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,148
WE SAW DESPITE THE SADNESS AND  
GRIEF AROUND US THAT WE'RE      

351
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,784
RESILIENT AND THAT WE'RE        
COMMITTED TO FIGHT AND RECOVER  

352
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,020
AND BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF   
HEALING.                        

353
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,591
WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF       
PULLING TOGETHER.               

354
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:13,297
YES, WE'RE HURT, WE'RE HURT     
BADLY, BUT WE'RE NOT BROKEN.    

355
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:18,169
AS I SAID, WE'VE SEEN GENEROSITY
ON A SCALE THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED

356
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,539
IN NEVADA HISTORY.              
WE KNOW THAT WE WILL NEVER EVER 

357
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:26,977
FORGET THIS HORRIFIC EVENT.     
WE WILL MARCH FORWARD AS A      

358
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:31,749
FAMILY, GIVING EACH OTHER       
COMFORT, SUPPORT AND LOVE.      

359
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:35,519
FUTURE WILL COME ONE DAY AT A   
TIME.                           

360
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:41,392
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE HOW WE'RE  
GOING TO LIVE EACH DAY.         

361
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:47,264
WE MUST BE GLAD, WE MUST BE     
GOOD, WE MUST BE BRAVE.         

362
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:53,504
WE MUST HAVE FAITH.             
WE WILL EMERGE AS A STRONGER,   

363
00:22:53,638 --> 00:23:01,145
KINDER, BETTER STATE AND NATION.
GOD BLESS THE VICTIMS AND THEIR 

364
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,015
FAMILIES.                       
MAY THEY GIVE THEM PEACE, GOD   

365
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,919
BLESS OUR STATE AND THE NATION, 
THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.

THE MASS MURDER TOOK PLACE

00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:24,822
SUNDAY NIGHT FILLS AMERICA'S    
HEART WITH GRIEF.               

395
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:30,160
AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN    
MOURNING.                       

396
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:35,099
I VISITED THE HOSPITAL EARLIER

BED IN A WORLD THAT IS SUDDENLY 
EMPTY, THE PEOPLE THEY SO DEARLY

405
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,575
LOVE WERE TORN AWAY FROM THEM   
FOREVER.                        

406
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:22,012
OUR SOULS ARE STRIKEN WITH GRIEF
FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO LOST A

ENDLESS.

WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE.  

411
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:48,038
HERE AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,  
WE REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN WHO  

412
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,108
DIED THIS WEEK, CHARLES         
HARTFIELD.                      

413
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,511
HE WAS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL     
PERSON.                         

414
00:26:54,646 --> 00:27:00,517
OFFICER HARTFIELD WAS A PROUD   
VETERAN, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, A   

415
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,622
LOVING FATHER.                  
HIS DEATH IS A TRAGIC LOSS FOR  

416
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:09,560
THIS POLICE FORCE, FOR THIS CITY
AND FOR OUR GREAT NATION.       

417
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:14,198
WE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORDS TO    
EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN HOW SUCH

418
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:20,537
EVIL CAN EXIST, HOW THERE CAN BE
SUCH CRUELTY AND SUCH SUFFERING.

419
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:24,942
WE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE EVIL
THAT THREATENINGS US OR THE     

420
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:28,545
VIOLENCE THAT INCITES SUCH      
TERROR.                         

421
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,151
WE'RE DEFINED BY THE LOVE, OUR  
CARING AND OUR COURAGE.         

422
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:39,690
IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS, WHAT    
SHINES MOST BRIGHTLY IS THE     

423
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,661
GOODNESS THAT THRIVES IN THE    
HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE.           

424
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:51,735
THAT GOODNESS IS OUR LIGHT HOUSE
AND OUR SOLACE.                 

425
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,936
IS KNOWLEDGE.                   
THAT THE SOULS OF THOSE THAT    

426
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,607
PASSED ARE NOW AT PEACE IN      
HEAVEN.                         

427
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:02,246
HERE ON EARTH, WE'RE BLESSED TO 
BE SURROUNDED BY HEROS.         

428
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,850
AS ONE EYE WITNESS RECOUNTED    
THIS WEEK, WHILE EVERYONE ELSE  

429
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:11,388
WAS CROUCHING, POLICE OFFICERS  
WERE STANDING UP AS TARGETS JUST

430
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,858
TRYING TO DISTRICT PEOPLE AND   
TELL THEM WHERE TO GO.          

431
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:23,567
THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING UP IN
THE LINE OF FIRE TO HELP THOSE  

432
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,737
IN DANGER AND TO FIND OUT WHERE 
THOSE HORRIBLE SHOTS WERE COMING

433
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,140
FROM.                           
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE       

434
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:36,413
BRAVERY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD    
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.      

435
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:43,420
AMERICANS DENIED DEATH AND      
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH       

436
00:28:43,555 --> 00:29:08,812
COURAGE.                        
WHEN THE WORD AND WORST OF
