REMARKABLE NOT ONLY FOR THEIR

IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL HAS BEEN
OUR CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AT THIS LATE HOUR, THE AIR IS

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
APPARENTLY STILL THICK WITH TEAR

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
GAS.
RICHARD?

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
>> Reporter: IT IS FULL OF TEAR

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
GAS, AND THAT IS WHY I'M WEARING

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THIS MASK.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
THE CLASHES HERE ARE ONGOING.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
STILL, IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AN

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
ARAB SPRING MOMENT OR A TURNING
POINT.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
BUT IF THESE CLASHES CONTINUE,

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IT COULD BECOME A MAJOR PROBLEM

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
FOR TURKEY, ONE OF THE MOST

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000

MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
PROTESTERS SET A POLICE VEHICLE

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
ON FIRE AND THE POLICE PULLED

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
BACK.

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
THE PROTESTERS HERE ARE DIGGING

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
IN, FORTIFYING THE SQUARE,

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
BUILDING BARRICADES, PREPARING

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
FOR A DRAWN OUT STRUGGLE WITH

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THE GOVERNMENT.

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THIS PROTEST HAS BEEN GOING ON

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
NOW FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS.

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
IT STARTED AS AN EFFORT TO SAVE

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THIS PARK, BUT IT'S WELL BEYOND

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
THAT NOW.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
THE DEMONSTRATORS COMPLAIN OF
POLICE BRUTALITY.

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND THAT PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
IS IMPOSING AN ISLAMIC AGENDA IN

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
SECULAR TURKEY.

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
>> OUR PRIME MINISTER IS A

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
DICTATOR, LIKE HITLER, LIKE

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
MUSSOLINI.

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
>> THEY'RE TRYING TO LIMIT OUR

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
RIGHTS OF LIBERTY AND SHOWING

DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTING AGAINST

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
PRIME MINISTER ERDOGAN.

106
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
IT SEEMED LIKE THE VIOLENCE WAS

107
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
OVER.

108
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
BUT IT TURNED AGAIN.

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SUDDENLY IN THE BIGGEST

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000

THEIR VEHICLES CHARGED IN.

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
THERE WAS A STAMPEDE AS

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
PROTESTERS RUSHED TO ESCAPE.

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SOME FELL, SOME INJURED.

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FIRES, MORE TEAR GAS.

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
>> IT'S BEING FIRED -- I DON'T

WANT TO SAY AT RANDOM, BUT IT'S

119

BALCONY OF WHAT ARE PRIVATE

122
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000

A DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN TO

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
TAKE BACK THE SQUARE.

125
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THIS IS NOW A CHALLENGE OVER THE

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
NATURE OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
NANCY, THANKS.

556
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
>> YOU BET.
>>> WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH

557
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
A BIG ADMISSION FROM A LOT OF

558
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
MOMS AND DADS ABOUT THEIR KIDS.

559
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For our families...

560
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
our neighbors...

561
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and our communities...

562
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
America's beverage companies
have created...

563
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
a wide range of new choices.

564
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Developing smaller portion sizes
and more..

565
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
low and no-calorie
beverages...

566
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
adding clear calorie labels so
you know...

567
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
exactly what you're choosing...

568
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and in schools, replacing
full-calorie soft drinks...

569
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
with lower-calorie options.

570
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
With more choices and fewer
calories...

571
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
America's Beverage Companies are
delivering.

572
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
>>> THIS IS THE 50th ANNIVERSARY

573
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
OF A PIVOTAL DAY IN THE HISTORY

574
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY.

575
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
STARTING IN ALABAMA, THE DEFIANT

576
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
GEORGE WALLACE, ALABAMA

577
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
GOVERNOR, BLOCKING TWO

578
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS FROM

579
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF
ALABAMA.

580
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
THAT AFTERNOON PRESIDENT KENNEDY

581
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
FEDERALIZED THE ALABAMA NATIONAL

582
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
GUARD TO REMOVE THE GOVERNOR.

583
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
THE STUDENTS WALKED IN AND MADE

584
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
HISTORY.

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
THAT SAME NIGHT, KENNEDY TOOK A

586
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
STAND OF HIS OWN, IN A SPEECH TO

587
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
THE NATION, HE PROMISED TO

588
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
INTRODUCE COMPREHENSIVE CIVIL

589
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
RIGHTS LEGISLATION.

590
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
BUT WITHIN HOURS, AT HALF PAST

591
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
MIDNIGHT, ANOTHER SIGN OF HOW

592
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
STRONG THE OPPOSITION WAS.

593
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST MEDGAR

594
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
EVERS WAS SHOT IN THE BACK AND

595
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
KILLED IN THE DRIVEWAY OF HIS

596
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000

597
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
HE WAS BURIED AT ARLINGTON

599
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
MILITARY HONORS.

600
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
>>> TONIGHT WORK IS FINALLY

601
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
UNDER WAY TO REPAIR A DAMAGED

602
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
AMERICAN ICON.

603
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT HAS BEEN

604
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
CLOSED SINCE A 5.2 MAGNITUDE

605
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
EARTHQUAKE SHOOK THE NATION'S

606
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
CAPITOL IN AUGUST 2011, SHIFTING

607
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
STONES IN THE MONUMENT AND

608
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
LEAVING DEEP CRACKS, ESPECIALLY

609
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
NEAR THE TOP.

610
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WITH THE SCAFFOLDING AROUND IT
NOW COMPLETE, WORKERS ARE

611
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
BEGINNING THE TASK OF REPLACING

612
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
THE STONES WHILE HANGING MORE

613
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
THAN 500 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

614
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
>>> IN CHICAGO, IT WASN'T THE

615
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
TYPICAL WEATHER PROBLEM AT THE

616
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
BASEBALL GAMES IN THAT CITY LAST
NIGHT.

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
EVEN A LITTLE RAIN MAY HAVE BEEN

618
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
BETTER THAN THIS.

619
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
THE CUBS AND REDS HAD TO PLAY IN

620
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
AN UNUSUAL FOG THAT SETTLED IN

621
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ON WRIGLEY FIELD.

622
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
THE CUBS LOST.

623
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
AND IT WAS THE SAME STORY ON THE

624
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
SOUTH SIDE AT THE WHITE SOX/BLUE

625
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
JAYS GAME.

626
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
THE SOX WERE ABLE TO GET THROUGH

627
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
IT A BIT BETTER.

628
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
THEY ENDED UP WINNING THAT

629
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
CONTEST.

630
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
>>> NOW PARENTS WILL ALMOST

631
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
NEVER ADMIT, TO ANYONE ELSE, AT

632
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
LEAST, THAT THEY HAVE A FAVORITE

633
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
CHILD.
IT'S JUST NOT DONE.

634
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
BUT WHEN A BRITISH WEBSITE FOR

635
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
PARENTS PUT THE QUESTION TO MORE

636
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
THAN 2000 MOMS AND DADS IN A

637
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
SURVEY, IT GOT SOME SHOCKING
RESULTS.

638
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE MOTHERS

639
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
ADMITTED TO HAVING A FAVORITE
CHILD.

640
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
NOT QUITE SO MANY OF THE DADS

641
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
WERE WILLING TO GO THAT FAR.

642
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
JUST OVER A QUARTER OF THE

643
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
FATHERS SAID THEY HAD A

644
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
FAVORITE.

645

651
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
MONTH BACK IN 1933, WHEN A

CONVOY OF EAGER MOTORISTS DROVE

653
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
INTO A LOT.

654
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
THEY PUT THEIR CARS IN PARK AND

655
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
SAT BACK AND ENJOYED THE SHOW.

656
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
IT WAS THE OPENING OF THE FIRST

657
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
DRIVE-IN CINEMA.

658
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000

BE THOUSANDS OF THEM.
