 Remember that accident I got in

469
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,292
            with the pole, and I
            had to make a claim 
            and all that?       

470
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,293
Is that whole thing             
still dragging on?              

471
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:50,294
            No, I took some pics
            with the app and... 

472
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,712
     filed a claim, but...      

473
00:23:51,714 --> 00:23:53,714
 You know how they send you     
 money to cover repairs and...  

474
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:54,965
              They took forever 
              to pay you, right?

475
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,917
No, I got paid                  
right away, but...              

476
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:58,185
at the very end of              
it all, my agent...             

477
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,419
              Wouldn't even call
              you back, right?  

478
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,921
     No, she called to see      
        if I was happy.         

479
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:02,773

480
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:03,891
                 for any reason,

481
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:05,476
                  they'd give me
