[000:18:16;462] It's your eyes.
[000:18:18;197] That's why there's Ocuvite,
[000:18:19;665] from Bausch + Lomb.
[000:18:20;766] As you age your eyes can lose
[000:18:20;766] vital nutrients.
[000:18:23;402] Ocuvite helps replenish those
[000:18:23;402] nutrients.
[000:18:25;737] Ocuvite has Lutein, Zeaxanthin,
[000:18:25;737] and Omega-3.

[000:18:43;589] If he'd taken Tylenol,
[000:18:44;823] he'd be stopping for
[000:18:44;823] more pills right now.
[000:18:47;793] Only Aleve has the
[000:18:47;793] strength to stop tough pain
[000:18:50;429] for up to 12 hours
[000:18:50;429] with just one pill.

[000:20:25;224] With my moderate to severe
[000:20:25;224] Crohn's disease,...
[000:20:28;493] ...I was always searching for
[000:20:28;493] ways to manage my symptoms.
[000:20:34;666] Then I realized managing was
[000:20:34;666] all I was doing.
[000:20:38;370] When I finally told my doctor,
[000:20:39;571] he said HUMIRA was for people
[000:20:39;571] like me
[000:20:41;406] who have tried other
[000:20:41;406] medications,...
[000:20:42;841] but still experience the
[000:20:42;841] symptoms
[000:20:44;109] of moderate to severe
[000:20:44;109] Crohn's disease.
[000:20:46;011] In clinical studies,
[000:20:46;912] the majority of patients
[000:20:46;912] on HUMIRA
[000:20:48;513] saw significant symptom
[000:20:48;513] relief...
[000:20:49;848] ...and many achieved remission.
[000:20:51;516] HUMIRA can lower your ability to
[000:20:51;516] fight infections...
[000:20:53;986] ...including tuberculosis.
[000:20:55;220] Serious, sometimes fatal

[000:21:02;961] ...and new or worsening heart

[000:21:04;596] Before treatment, get tested
[000:21:04;596] for TB.
[000:21:06;999] Tell your doctor if you've been
[000:21:06;999] to areas
[000:21:08;667] where certain fungal infections
[000:21:08;667] are common,
[000:21:10;602] and if you've had TB,...
[000:21:11;870] ...hepatitis B, are prone to
[000:21:11;870] infections,
[000:21:14;139] ...or have flu-like symptoms
[000:21:14;139] or sores.
[000:21:15;941] Don't start HUMIRA if you have
[000:21:15;941] an infection.
[000:21:18;010] If you're still just managing
[000:21:18;010] your symptoms,
[000:21:19;978] ask your gastroenterologist
[000:21:19;978] about HUMIRA.
[000:21:22;414] With HUMIRA, remission
[000:21:22;414] is possible.
[000:21:26;852] I tabut with my back paines,
[000:21:28;086] I couldn't sleep

[000:21:29;621] Then I found Aleve PM.
