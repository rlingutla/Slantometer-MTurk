BE KIND OF LIKE ■çSUMMER.

WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO COOL    
OFF.                            

751
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:23,792
>> SUPPOSED TO.                 
IT IS NOT DOING THAT AT ALL.    

752
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:23,802
MAYBE IN THE EXTENDED RANGE BUT 
ONLY BACK TO NORMAL.            

753
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:23,812
HOLIDAY WEEKEND COMING UP, WET  
COLUMBUS DAY AND THAT DAY HAS   

754
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:23,822
DOWNPOURS AND TROPICAL IN NATURE
AS AN IN TENSE RAIN.            

755
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:23,832
NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL FOLLOW 
THIS WET PATTERN.               

756
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:23,842
IT IS OKAY THAT WE GET INTO A   
WET PATTERN.                    

757
00:28:23,843 --> 00:28:23,852
IN THE 60s, AFTER HITTING 78.   
THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY WAS   

758
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:23,862
DRY.                            
SECOND HALF GOT INTO THE CLOUDS 

759
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:23,872
AND SPRINKLES.                  
WAIT UNTIL THE HUMIDITY HITS    

760
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:23,882
TOMORROW.                       
A WARM FRONT TO THE NORTH OF NEW

761
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:23,892
YORK CITY.                      
IT IS A DEW POINT.              

762
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:23,902
AND 66 IN NEW YORK CITY.        
THE SPRINKLES HAVE FADED FOR THE

763
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:23,912
NIGHT.                          
THE CLOUDS WILL REMAIN AND      

764
00:28:23,913 --> 00:28:23,922
THEY'LL BE IN OUR HAIR FOR THE  
ENTIRE WEEKEND.                 

765
00:28:23,923 --> 00:28:23,932
THIS IS A WEATHER FRONT THAT    
LIFTS THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING  

766
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:23,942
SO IF YOU ARE THINKING IT IS    
DRY, WELL, MOSTLY.              

767
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:23,952
WE'LL SAY THAT.                 
BUT THERE MIGHT BE A SPRINKLE OR

768
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:23,962
A RENEGADE SPRINKLE GOING       
THROUGH AND THEN IN THE         

769
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:23,972
AFTERNOON WE OPEN UP SUNSHINE   
AND THAT IS WHEN WE GET UP INTO 

770
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:23,982
THE MID AND UPPER 70s.          
THE WINDS KICKING UP THIS       

771
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:23,992
WEEKEND.                        
LATE OFTEN SATURDAY AND         

772
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,002
ESPECIALLY SUNDAY INTO EARLY    
MONDAY.                         

773
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:24,012
75 TOMORROW.                    
72 IN WORCESTER.                

774
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:24,022
MIDDLE 70s SHOULD DO IT.        
LOW 70s ON CAPE COD AND THE     

775
00:28:24,023 --> 00:28:24,032
TOPSFIELD FAIR ON GOING THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND.                    

776
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:24,042
MILD AND MANY CLOUDS AROUND     
TOMORROW AND ABOUT 75 DEGREES.  

777
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:24,052
AND WE'RE IN THE HUMID AIR.     
FEEDING THE SHOWERS ON MONDAY,  

778
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:24,062
THIS IS OVERPLAYED.             
THEY ARE NOT THAT ROBUST.       

779
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:24,072
I THINK MAYBE A PASSING SPRINKLE
ON SUNDAY.                      

780
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:24,082
UP UNTIL MIDDAY, VERY HUMID.    
TROPICAL DOWNPOURS ON MONDAY AND

781
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:24,092
THAT IS THE ODD MAN OUT.        
THE TEMPERATURES KIND OF JUMP UP

782
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:24,102
AND THEN SLIDE BACK DOWN ONCE   
AGAIN.                          

783
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:24,112
81 DEGREES ON SUNDAY.           
THE RED SOX GAME LOOKING■ç GOOD.

784
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:24,122
ABOUT 79 BUT WE'LL HIT THE 80   
LATER IN THE DAY.               

785
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:24,132
HAZY SUNSHINE GOING OUT TO      
CENTER FIELD.                   

786
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:24,142
PART OF THE REASONS WE'RE SEEING
THE TROPICAL DOWNPOURS IS THIS, 

787
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:24,152
NATE.                           
A LOT OF HEAVY RAIN.            

788
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:24,162
BUT THE WINDS NOT ALL THAT      
IMPRESSIVE.                     

789
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:24,172
MOST OF THESE TO THE EAST OF THE
CENTER OF CIRCULATION.          

790
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:24,182
60 MILES PER HOUR, COULD        
STRENGTHEN IN A HURRICANE AS IT 

791
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:24,192
HEADS FOR NEW ORLEANS AND THEN  
GOES UP INTO THE DEEP SOUTH AND 

792
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:24,202
AS IT GOES ACROSS THE           
APPALACHIANS WEAKENS BUT STILL A

793
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:24,212
SEMBLANCE OF A STRUCTURE TO GIVE
US THE DOWNPOUR.                

794
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:24,222
A LOT OF HUMIDITY.              
WE NEED SOMETHING TO TRIGGER IT 

795
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:24,232
AND NATE WOULD BE JUST WHAT THE 
DOCTOR ORDERS.                  

796
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:24,242
NOT TO BANISH THE BROUGHT       
ALTOGETHER OR THE DRY SPELL.    

797
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:24,252
BUT AT LEAST PUT A GOOD DENT    
THERE IT.                       

798
