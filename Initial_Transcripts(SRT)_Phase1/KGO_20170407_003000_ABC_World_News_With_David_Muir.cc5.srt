69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
WHETHER TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION.

71
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
TERRIBLE.

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA
IS ONE OF THE TRULY EGREGIOUS

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
CRIMES.

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
HAPPEN.

76

RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT

HAPPENED?

>> AT SOME POINT I MAY.

80
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I HAVEN'T, BUT AT SOME POINT I

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
MAY.

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> DO YOU THINK THAT ASSAD

83
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
SHOULD LEAVE POWER IN SYRIA?

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
>> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AND HE'S THERE AND I GUESS HE'S

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
RUNNING THINGS, SO SOMETHING

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
SHOULD HAPPEN.

>> SIR, DOES ASSAD HAVE TO GO?

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> ASSAD'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE IS

97
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
UNCERTAIN CLEARLY, AND WITH THE

98
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
ACTS HE HAS TAKEN, IT WOULD SEEM

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THERE IS NO ROLE FOR HIM TO

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
GOVERN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000

ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL

103
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
COALITION TO REMOVE ASSAD?

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
>> THOSE STEPS ARE UNDER WAY.

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> Reporter: BUT IT WAS JUST ONE

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
SUGGESTED SOMETHING FAR

108
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
DIFFERENT, SAYING THE SYRIAN

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
PEOPLE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO
GET RID OF ASSAD.

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
THIS SHIFT COMES JUST 24 HOURS

111
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
AFTER THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE

112
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
WORLD WATCHING, SAID THOSE

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
IMAGES OF CHILDREN GASSED HAD

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
CHANGED HIS MIND.

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
>> I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HAPPENED THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
MUCH.

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,

121
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO

122
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
BE TELLING YOU.

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> Reporter: BEFORE HE WAS

124

REPEATEDLY TWEETING ABOUT IT.

126
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BACK IN 2013, AFTER A CHEMICAL

WEAPONS ATTACK, WHEN PRESIDENT

IF YOU DO, MANY BAD THINGS WILL

132
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
HAPPEN.

133
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
AND FROM THAT FIGHT, THE U.S.

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
TONIGHT, HE IS SIGNALING HIS

136
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
STANCE HAS CHANGED.

137
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SUPPORTING SYRIAN LEADER BASHAR

139
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
AL ASSAD, SAID TODAY SUPPORT FOR

140
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
ASSAD NOT UNCONDITIONAL, BUT

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
URGING CAUTION.

142
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
ON CAPITOL HILL, A LEADING

143
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
REPUBLICAN SAID THIS IS A TEST

144
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FOR TRUMP.

145
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO MAKE A

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
DECISION THAT'S GOING TO DEFINE

147
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
HIS PRESIDENCY ONE WAY OR THE

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
OTHER.

149
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
IF HE DOES NOTHING, THEN IT'S

150
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
GOING TO BE OBAMA ON STEROIDS.

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
HASN'T SAID WHAT HE WOULD DO IN
SYRIA, BUT THERE ARE MANY

153
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
MILITARY OPTIONS.

154
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
HIT SYRIAN AIRFIELDS TO GROUND

155
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
ASSAD'S AIR FORCE.

156
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
GO AFTER MILITARY TARGETS SUCH

157
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
AS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.

158
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WHAT COULD WE USE?

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILES OR
U.S.-MANNED AIRCRAFT.

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
RISKIER BUT WE HAVE HIGHLY

161
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
SOPHISTICATED WARPLANES.

162
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> AND MARTHA JOINS ME NOW.

163
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
MARTHA WE KNOW
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEFENSE

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
SECRETARY ARE NOW TOGETHER.
HE'S BEING BRIEFED ON THE

165
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
POTENTIAL OPTIONS.

166
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
WE LEARNED THAT THE AIRCRAFT

167
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
THAT DROPPED THE CHEMICAL

168
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
WEAPONS WAS IN FACT A SYRIAN

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MILITARY AIRCRAFT.

170
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
>> THEY SAY THERE'S NO QUESTION

171
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
IT WAS A SYRIAN MILITARY

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
AIRCRAFT.

173
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE EQUIPMENT

174
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THERE OVER SYRIA NOW THEY COULD

175
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ACTUALLY WATCH, GO BACK AND SEE

176
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
WHAT KIND OF AIRCRAFT DROPPED

177
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
THOSE MUNITIONS.

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
>> WE HAVE MORE EQUIPMENT THERE.

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
MARTHA, AS YOU BEEN REPORTING WE

180
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
HAVE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS THERE

181
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IN RECENT WEEKS, WE LEARNED OF

182
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
HUNDREDS BEING SENT INTO SYRIA.

183
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
>> WE DO, DAVID, AND THAT'S A
REAL CONCERN.

184
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
IF MILITARY ACTION IS TAKEN

185
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THERE WILL BE A WARNING TO

Ray's always been different.

744
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Last year, he said he was going
to dig a hole to China.

745
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
AT&T is working with farmers to
improve irrigation techniques.

746
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Remote moisture sensors use a
reliable network

747
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
to tell them when and where to
water.

748
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So that farmers like Ray can
compete in big ways.

749
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000

773
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I USE WHAT'S ALREADY
INSIDE ME TO REACH MY GOALS.

774
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SO I LIKED WHEN MY
DOCTOR TOLD ME

775
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I MAY REACH MY BLOOD
SUGAR AND A1C GOALS

776
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
BY ACTIVATING
WHAT'S WITHIN ME

777
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

778
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

779
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO
DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO

780
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.

781
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
TRULICITY RESPONDS WHEN
MY BLOOD SUGAR RISES.

782
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
AND IT WORKS 24/7.

783
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN

784
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

785
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

786
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN
ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

787
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
WHEN USED WITH
DIET AND EXERCISE.

788
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

789
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST
MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES

790
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES

791
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.

792
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY
IF YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER

793
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
HAS HAD MEDULLARY
THYROID CANCER,

794
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
IF YOU'VE HAD MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2,

795
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
OR IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY.

796
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

797
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS

798
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
SUCH AS ITCHING, RASH,
OR TROUBLE BREATHING;

799

OR SEVERE PAIN IN
YOUR STOMACH AREA.

801
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS
MAY INCLUDE PANCREATITIS,

802
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
WHICH CAN BE FATAL.

803
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN

804
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
INCREASES YOUR RISK
FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

805
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,

806
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
DECREASED APPETITE
AND INDIGESTION.

807
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,

808
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
WHICH MAY MAKE EXISTING
KIDNEY PROBLEMS WORSE.
