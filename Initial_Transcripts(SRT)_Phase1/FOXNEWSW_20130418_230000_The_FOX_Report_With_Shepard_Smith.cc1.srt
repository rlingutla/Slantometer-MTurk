HATS THESE GUYS ARE WEARING

146
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
BOUGHT THEM FOR THAT DAY

148
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000

BE DISTINCTIVE TO SOMEONE

MONDAY THAT WOULD BE EVEN

177
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
MORE VALUABLE TO THE FBI.

178
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
AN EVEN BETTER ANGLE OF ONE

179
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
TRUE THEY CAN PIN POINT

383
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
EVERY CALL OF EVERY MOMENT

384
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
AT THAT HOUR OF THE DAY

385
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
FROM 2:00 TO 3:00 ON MONDAY

386
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
AFTERNOON AND IF THEY CAN

387
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
CAN THEY TRACE IT?

388
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
>>
>> WHAT WE REPORTED EARLIER

389
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HERE AT FOX IS THAT THE FBI

390
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
WAS SCRUBBING OR SCANNING

391
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
THE CELL PHONE TOWER

392
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
RECORDS LOOKING FOR

393
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
POSITIVE HITS AT THE POINT

394
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
OF DETONATION.

395
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
IN OTHER WORDS WERE THERE

396
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
PHONE CALLS GOING THROUGH

397
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
CELL PHONE TOWERS AT THE

398
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
VERY MOMENTS THAT THEY KNOW

399
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
THE BOMBS WERE BEING

400
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
DETONATED, THEY CAN USE

401
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THAT INFORMATION TO TRACE

402
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
IT BACK TO A PHONE NUMBER.

403
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
BUT ANY TERRORIST BECAUSE

404
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THAT'S WHAT THESE TWO

405
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
PEOPLE ARE WORTH THEIR

406
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
SAWLTD SALT, IF THEY ARE

407
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
USING CELL PHONES FOR

408
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
DETONATION WOULD BE USING

409
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
DISPOSABLE CELL PHONES THAT

410
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
THEY PURCHASED AT

411
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
CONVENIENCE STORE.
EVEN FINDING THAT NUMBER IF

412
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THAT WAS THE METHOD OF

413
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
DETONATION IS NOT

414
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
NECESSARILY GOING TO LEAD

415
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
BACK TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN
THIS CASE UNLESS YOU HAVE A

416
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
SUPER ALERT CONVENIENCE

417
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
STORE CLERK WHO MAY

418
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
REMEMBER THESE GUYS.

419
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
>> YEAH.

420
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AND THE INVESTIGATION AS IT

421
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
MOVES FORWARD, YOU WONDER,

422
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
CATHERINE, WHY THE FBI WAS

423
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
QUIET FOR TWO DAYS.

424
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
IS THERE A REASONABLE

425
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
EXPLANATION OR WHAT ARE WE

426
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
HEARING ABOUT WHAT EXPLAINS

427
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
THAT OVER THE PAST 48

428
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
HOURS?
>> THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED AN

429
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
EXPLANATION.

430
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
BUT I THINK RICK WOULD
AGREE WITH ME THAT OUR

431
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
EXPERIENCE WOULD TELL YOU
THAT THINGS WERE MOVING AT

432
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
A VERY FAST PACE AND IT WAS

433
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
EXTREMELY FLUID.

434
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
THE DECISION TO RELEASE THE

435
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
PICTURES HAS BENEFITS.

436
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
IF THE SUBJECTS ARE

437
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
IDENTIFIED, BUT THEY ARE

438
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ALSO RISKS BECAUSE IT TIPS

439
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
THE FBI'S HAT TO THESE

440
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
INDIVIDUALS AND IT MAKE

441
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
CAUSE SOME TO FLEE.

442
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
BUT IF WE WANT TO SORT OF

443
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
LOOK AT WHAT I THINK IS THE

444
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
LEADING EDGE OF THIS STORY

445
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
NOW IS THAT THERE ARE TWO

446
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
INDIVIDUALS, BUT THEY HAD

447
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
TO HAVE SOME KIND OF HELP.

448
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
IT WOULD BE CALLED A

449
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SUPPORT NETWORK FOR THEIR

450
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
OPERATIONS IN BOSTON.

451
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
WERE THESE PEOPLE PART OF

452
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
THE CONSPIRACY OR WAS --

453
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
WERE THEY SORT OF

454
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
UNWITTINGLY HELPING THESE

455
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
INDIVIDUALS, BILL?

456
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> Bill: TO THAT POINT

457
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
CATHERINE, THE FBI AGENT IN

458
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
CHARGE, AND I WILL BRING

459
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
RICK IN FOR A COMMENT ON

460
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
THIS AS WELL.

461
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
BE

462
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
DIFFICULT BUT PLEASE COME

463
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
FORWARD.

464
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
ESSENTIALLY, RICK, THAT WAS

465
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
AN APPEAL TO FAMILY OR

466
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
FRIENDS THAT YOU MAY KNOW

467
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT WE

468
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY'RE

469
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
AND DON'T HOLD BACK.

470
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
>> AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE

471
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
REMINDED OF THE HORRORS OF

472
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
THAT DAY AND THE PAIN AND

473
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
ANGUISH AND AWFUL INJURIES

474
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THAT THESE TWO SUSPECTS

475
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
ALLEGEDLY INFLICTED.

476
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I MEAN SOMEBODY PUT THESE

477
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
BOMBS DOWN THERE AND THE

478
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
FBI SEEMS PRETTY SURE THAT

479
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
IT'S THESE TWO GUYS.

480
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BILL, ONE OTHER THING, A

481
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
LOT OF-LY TO HAS BEEN A LOT

482
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
OF CRITICISM ABOUT ALL OF

483
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THESE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

484

POSTED AROUND ALL OF THESE

485

BIG CITIES IN AMERICA.

486
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
IF THOSE CAMERAS WEREN'T

487
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
THE IMAGES OF THESE TWO

488
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
GUYS AND IT WOULD BE A LOT

489
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
HARDER TO TRACK THEM DOWN.

490
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
>> RICK, THANK YOU FOR

491
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THAT.

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS

753
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
HOW CRITICAL AND VITAL AT

754
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
THIS POINT IN THE

755
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
INVESTIGATION THESE IMAG
AND THE VIDEO AND HOW VITAL

756
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
THEY CAN

757
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
>> YOU ARE RIGHT BILL.

758
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
THEY ARE K. NOT ONLY

759
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
ALLEGEDLY IDENTIFY THE

760
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
IN THE COURSE OF A TRIAL

761
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THEY PROVIDE THE SEQUENCE

762
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
OF CONVENIENCE LEADING UP

763
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
TO THE EXPLOSION.

764
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
REMEMBER, YOU SEE TWO GUYS,

765
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
ONE OF

766
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
VAD YES TAPE ACCORDING TO

767
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
THE FBI LITERALLYE BACKPACK WHERE

768
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AND  TS

769
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
BE.

770
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
THAT IS INCOWERFUL

771
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
IT ALSO SHOWS FLIGHT AS

772
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT

773
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
BILL.
>> Bill: WELL, THAT IS

774
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
INTERESTING.

775
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
BECAUSE THE FBI SAID THAT

776
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
COMMENT TONIGHT ABOUT

777
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
SUSPECT NUMBER 2.
AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE

778
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
VIDEOTAPE EVIDENCE OF H

779
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
LEAVING THAT BOMB AT THE

780
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
SCENE.

781
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
NOW, WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE

782
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
COULD BE IMPORTANT HERE,

783
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
GREG?

784
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
>> Greg: THE DEBRIS FIELD
IS A WEALTH OF DIRECT

785
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
EVIDENCE BECAUSE IN
PARTICULAR THEY MAY BE AGE

786
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
TO IDENTIFY THE LABORATORY

787
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
UNDERWRITER ON ONE OR MORE

788
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
OF THE PRESSURE COOKERS

789
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
THAT COULD LEAD TO WHERE IT   THE

790
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
PEOPLE WHO

791
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
PURCHASED IT.

792
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
1993 IN THE WORLD TRADE

793
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
CENTER BOMBING, IT WAS A

794
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
SMALL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

795
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
IN THE DEBRIS FIELD FOUND

796
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
ON THE AXLE OF T

797
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
EXPLODING VAN THAT

798
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THE RYDER TRUCK RENTAL IN

799
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
NEW JERSEY AND THAT'S HOW

800
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
THEY NABBED THE KILLERS.

801
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
>> Bill: AS WE MOVE
FORWARD, IF THERE IS AN

802
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
ARREST, IF THERE IS AN

803
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
APPREHENSION, WH

804
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
CHARGES COULD BE FILED IN A

805
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
CASE LIKE THIS?

806
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
>> THE FEDS COULD FILE

807
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
TERRORISM CHARGES AGAINST

808
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
THESE SUSPECTS.

809
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, AN ACT

810
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
OF VIOLENCE INTENDED TO

811
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
COERCE THE GOVERNMENT OR

812
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
INTIMIDATE THE GENERAL

813
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
POPULATION.
THAT CARRIES THE DEATH

814
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
PENALTY AS WELL AS
EXPLODING A WEAPON OF MASS

815
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
DESTRUCTION.
THE STATE COULD CHARGE,

816
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
MURDER CHARGES UP TO 200

817
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES

818
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
BUT, REMEMBER,

819
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
MASSACHUSETTS ABOLISHED THE

820
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
DEATH PENALTY IN 1984, SO

821
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
ONLY THE FEDS CAN SEEK

822
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
DEATH.

823
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000

ATTACK AT THE BOSTON

THE FBI SPECIAL AGENT

866
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
LEADING THE INVESTIGATION
SAYS THAT ANYONE WITH ANY

867
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
INFORMATION ON THE SUSPECTS

868
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000

BOSTON?

877
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
>> WELL, BILL, ONE OF THE
FIRST THINGS THAT STRUCK ME

878
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000

886
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
FOLLOWING ON WHAT WE HAD

A BALL CAP TURNED BACKWARDS

THE SECOND SUSPECT IS QUITE

941
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000

FACES A YOU LOOK AT HIS

946
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
PROFILE AND THEY COULD BE

947
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
QUITE REVEALING TOO THROUGH

948
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
THE THIS INVESTIGATION

949
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000

THE FBI IS LAUNCHING A

950
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
SERIOUS APPEAL TO THE

951
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000

952
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
>> THEY ARE.

953
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
AND THE BAD NEWS WHEN YOU

954
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
HEAR THEM GOING PUBLIC,

955
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY

956
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THE

957
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
LEADS THEY HAD TO THIS

958
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
POINT AND THEY DON'T KNOW

959
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
EXACTLY WHO THESE

960
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
INDIVIDUALS ARE.

00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
BUT YOU HEARD FROM THE FEDS

962
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
VERY CLEARLY IN THIS PRESS

963
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
CONFERENCE THAT SOMEONE OUT

964
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
THERE KNOWS WHO THESE

965
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
INDIVIDUALS ARE.

966
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THE IMAGES ARE VERY CLEAR

967
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
THAT THEY HAVE DISPLAYED.

968
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
THAT THE BLESSING WE HAVE

969
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
WITH THE PROLIFERATION WITH

970
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
CAMERAS, SECURITY CAMERAS

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
iPHONE CAMERAS THAT ARE

974
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THESE PEOPLE.

975
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
WHEN THAT KIND OF THING

976
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
COMES OUT.

977
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
SOMEONE KNOWS WHO THEY'RE.

978
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT YOU

979
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
NOW HAVE TO COMPETE WITH

980
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
ALL OF THE BAD IMAGES

981
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
FLOATING AROUND ON THE

982
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
INTERNET.

983
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
FOR CLARITY THESE IMAGES

984
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONES, I

985
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
EMPHASIZE THE ONLY ONES

986
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD VIEW

987
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
TO ASSIST US.

988
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
OTHER PHOTOS SHOULD NOT BE

989
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
DEEMED CREDIBLE AND UN --

990
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
THEY UNNECESSARILY DIVERT

991
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION IN

992
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
THE WRONG DIRECTION AND

993
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
CREATE UNDUE WORK FOR VITAL

994
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
RESOURCES.
>> THE BLAST LOCATION HERE

995
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
ON BOYLSTON STREET STILL

996
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
VERY MUCH AN ACTIVE CRIME

997
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
SCENE.
INVESTIGATORS COULD BE

998
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
SCENE THROUGHOUT THE DAY

999
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
SIFTING THROUGH THE DEBRIS

1000
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
OF THAT BOMBING.

1001
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
WEARING THE WHITE SUITS.

1002
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
PULLING UP PIECES OF THE

1003
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
ASPHALT.

1004
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
THE LITTLE BITS OF EVIDENCE

1005
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THEY PULL FROM THAT BECOME

1006
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
PIECES TO THE PUZZLE.
ONCE YOU HAVE THE SUSPECTS,

1007
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE

1008
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
FALL TOGETHER.

1009
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
BILL?

1010
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
>> Bill: YOU KNOW, MIKE,

1011
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
THAT COMMENT THAT WAS MADE

1012
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
BY THE FBI I THINK IS SO

1013
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
TELLING.
WE HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF

1014
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 LEAVING A

1015
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
BACKPACK AT THE SCENE OF

1016
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
HIS SECOND EXPLOSION YOU

1017
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
THINK ABOUT THE COMMENT AND

1018
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
WHERE THE PRESS CONFERENCE

1019
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
STARTED.

1020
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
WE HAD A SINGLE PERSON OF

1021
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
INTEREST AND WE WERE

1022
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
WORKING TO CONFIRM WHETHER
OR NOT THIS PERSON WAS

1023
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
WORKING BY HIMSELF OR WITH

1024
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
SOMEONE ELSE.
MAYBE ANOTHER PERSON MAYBE

1025
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
A THIRD PERSON AT THE

1026
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
SCENE.
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE

1027
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
INVESTIGATION WORKED FROM

1028
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
THE POINT OF THE EXPLOSION

1029
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
AND WORKED ITS OUTWARD.

1030
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
AND NOW WE HAVE TWO IMAGES

1031
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
THAT ARE NOW PUBLIC.

1032
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
MIKE?
>> Mike: EXACTLY BILL.

1033
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AND GUN ONCE YOU GET THE

1034
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
PUBLIC APPEAL, HAVE YOU

1035
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
IMAGES THIS GOOD.

1036
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WHAT

1037
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS

1038
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
SAY.

1039
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
SOMEONE OUT THERE KNOWS WHO
THEY ARE.

1040
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
THEY PUT OUT A WORD OF

1041
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
CAUTION AS THEY HAVE TO AN

1042
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
EXTENT.

1043
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
DEPOSIT PEW ADVERTISE THE
GENERAL PUBLIC.

1044
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
THE WORD OF CAUTION YOU

1045
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

1046
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
KILLED THUS FAR.

1047
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE

1048
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS IF

1049
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
THEY INDEED ARE

1050
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
RESPONSIBLE.
THEY ARE VIOLENT.

1051
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THEY'RE

1052
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
VIOLENT AND THE FEDERAL

1053
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
INVESTIGATORS WANT TO GET

1054
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE

1055
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
INDIVIDUALS.

1056
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO APPROACH THEM,

1057
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
BILL?

1058
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
>> Bill: MIKE, THANKS, MIKE

QUIETLY TO QUIETLY PICK UP

1076
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000

HAVE CLEARLY DRAWN A BLANK

1081
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
IN TRACKING THESE TWO MEN.

1082
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
NOW THEY NEED THE PUBLIC'S

1083
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
INSTANCE, IN THE PUBLIC

1085
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000

FIESEL SHAH SAD.

1087
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
A PAKISTANI CITIZEN WHO

1088
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
ATTEMPTED TO SET OFF A CAR

1089
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
BOMB IN TIMES SQUARE IN MAY

1090
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
OF 2010.
POLICE HAVE VIDEO OF HIM.

1091
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
THEY HAD AN I.D.

1092
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THEY DID NOT FEEL IT

1093
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
NECESSARY TO PUT THAT OUT

1094
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
PUBLICLY.

1095
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
THEY SIMPLY TAILED HIM.

1096
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
HE THEY PUT HIM ON A NO FLY

1097
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
LIST.
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY WE

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
ARE SEEING THE BOSTON

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000

SHAH SAD.

1102
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
THEY SURVEILLED HIM.

1103
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
THEY TRACKED HIM IN THE END

1104
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
AND HE WAS FOUND TRYING TO
GET ON A FLIGHT OUT OF

1105
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
COUNTRY AT JFK.

1106
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
SO, WHAT WE KNOW FROM THIS

1107
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
NOW IS THAT THEY NEED THE

1108
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000

1110
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS

1111
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
WOULD TELL YOU IT WOULD
SUGGEST THERE WAS A FAIR

1112
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
DEGREE OF PLANNING IN THE

1113
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
PLOT BY THESE TWO MEN IF,

1114
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
INDEED, THEY ARE THE TWO

1115
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
WHO CARRIED IT OUT.

1116
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
THERE WAS A DEGREE OF

1117
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
PLANNING FOR AN ESCAPE

1118
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
ROUTE.

1119
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
THEY WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT

1120
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
TELLS YOU IT MAY MEAN THAT

1121
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
THEY HAVE HAD HELP IN

1122
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
STAYING AT LARGE.

1123
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
IT ALMOST CERTAINLY MEANS

1124
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
ACCORDING TO LAW

1125

IT'S A GRUELING EFFORT

YOU HAVE HOUSES THAT HAVE

1313

THEY RESPONDED IN THE

1343
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE

1344
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
NEWS OF THE EXPLOSION

1345
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
TAKING PLACE THE

1346
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
AUTHORITIES HERE SAYING

1347
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
THEY ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY

1348
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
EVERYTHING THEY CAN.

1349
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
A FOUR BLOCK AREA.

1350
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
A LARGE AREA FOR THEM TO

1351
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

1352
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE

1353
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
BELIEVED TO BE EITHER

1354
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
BURIED ALIVE OR MANY OF

1355
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
THEM SUSPECTED NOW AFTER

1356
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
THIS AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE

1357
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
DEAD BILL.

1358
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
>> Bill: WOW, YOU LOOK AT
THESE HOMES AND YOU HOW

1359
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THEY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED AND

1360
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
YOU IMAGINE THE FORCE OF

1361
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
THAT BLAST AND THE HEAT

1362
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
THAT CAME OFF THAT PLANT AS

1363
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
WELL.
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1364
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
WHAT CAUSED THIS.

1365
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
DO WE KNOW AT THIS POINT?

1366
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
ARE WE ANY CLOSER TO THAT

1367
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
ANSWER DOMINIC?

1368
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
>> WHAT CAUSED THE BLAST

1369
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
WELL IT APPEARS THAT WHEN

1370
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
FIREFIGHTERS ATTENDED A

1371
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
FIRE AT THE SCENE EARLIER

1372
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
IN THE EVENING.
THEY STARTED POURING WATER.

1373
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
THIS WAS AMMONIUM FACTORY.

1374
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
WHEN AMMONIUM IS MIXED WITH

1375
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
WATER IT BECOMES VERY

1376
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
HAZARDOUS, THAT'S VERY MUCH

1377
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
KNOWN.

1378
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
THE SUSPICION AT THIS TIME

1379
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
IS THAT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF
THE EXPLOSION.

1380
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
WHAT WAS CAUSE OF THE

1381
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
ORIGINAL FIRE, WE DON'T

1382
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
ACTUALLY KNOW.

1383
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
BACK IN JANUARY THERE WAS A

1384
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
REPORT THAT THERE HAD BEEN

1385
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
THE FACT THE PLANT HAD BEEN

1386
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
BURNING PALLETS AND BRUSH

1387
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AND THEY HADN'T NOTIFIED

1388
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
THE AUTHORITIES AND THAT A

1389
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
LOCAL SCHOOL WAS EVACUATED

1390
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
AS A RESULT OF THAT NO

1391
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
DOUBT THE AUTHORITIES

1392
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
LOOKING INTO WHETHER THERE

1393
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
IS ANYTHING IN THAT AT ALL.

1394
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
AT THIS TIME THEY STILL

1395
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
DON'T KNOW.
BACK TO YOU, BILL.

1396
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
>> Bill: THAT IS A

1397
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
NIGHTMARE OF LIVING HELL
LAST NIGHT.

1398
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
DOMINIC DI-NATALE, THANK

ABOUT A 20 MINUTE DRIVE

1402
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
SOUTH OF THAT BLAST SITE IS

1403
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
THE TOWN OF WACO TEXAS.

1404

1409
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
CONTROVERSIAL STANDOFF WITH

1410
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
FEDERAL AGENTS.

1411
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
THEY ATTEMPTED TO CARRY OUT

1412
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
A SEARCH WARRANT.

1413
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A 50 DAY

1414
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
SIEGE THAT ENDED WHEN THE
FEDS RAIDED THE PLACE AND

1415
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
THE CULT'S COMPOUND BURNED

1416
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
TO THE GROUND.

1417
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
ALMOST EVERYONE INSIDE DIED

1418
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
INCLUDING 20 CHILDREN.

1419
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
THIS WEEK ALSO MARKS 66

1420
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
YEARS SINCE THE DEADLIEST

1421
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
INDUSTRIAL DISASTER IN OUR

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
NATION'S HISTORY.

1423
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
IT ALSO HAPPENED IN THE

1424
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
STATE OF TEXAS OUTSIDE OF

1425
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
HOUSTON.

1426
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
A FIRE ON BOARD A SHIP FULL

1427
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
OF FERTILIZER KILLED NEAR

1428
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
600 THERE.

1429
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THAT BLAST ALSO BLEW TWO

1430
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
SMALL PLANES OUT OF THE SKY

1431
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
AND CAUSED A 15-FOOT TITLED

1432
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
TIDAL WAVE.

1433
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
MANY OF THE VICTIMS OUTSIDE

1435
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000

NOW MAKES HIM HOME HERE IN

NEW YORK.
WE SPOKE 11 HOURS AGO IN

1462
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
AMERICA'S NEWSROOM ABOUT

1463
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
WHAT COULD COME NEXT FROM

1464
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
THE FBI.
IS THIS WHAT YOU EXPECTED?

1465
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
>> YES BILL, IT IS WHAT I

1466
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
EXPECTED THAT THE PHOTOS
WOULD BE RELEASED BECAUSE

1467
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG TO

1468
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
SIFT THROUGH THE WHOLE

1469
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
CO-LODGE OF PHOTOS THEY HAD

1470
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
AND FILM ALL THE WAY BEFORE

1471
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
THE FINISH LINE TO THE

1472
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
FINISH LINE.
BILL, THE IMPORTANT THING

1473
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
RIGHT NOW IS THAT ANYBODY

1474
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
THAT WAS IN THE AREA AFTER

1475
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
THE FINISH LINE OUGHT TO BE

1476
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
LOOKING AT THEIR FILM THAT

1477
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
THEY THOUGHT WAS IRRELEVANT

1478
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
PRIOR TO THIS EVENT BECAUSE

1479
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
THESE INDIVIDUALS DROPPED

1480
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THE BOMBS ON THE STREET AND

1481
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
KEPT ON WALKING.

1482
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
SO, RIGHT BEYOND THEM DOWN

1483
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
BOYLSTON STREET WE HAVE

1484
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
SUBWAY ENTRANCES TO TWO

1485
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
DIFFERENT SUBWAY STATIONS
AND PEOPLE COULD HAVE SEEN

1486
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
THEM GOING INTO THE SUBWAY

1487
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
STATION PEOPLE COULD HAVE

1488
