BURIAL SHROUD.

186
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
IN SYRIA OUTRAGES HAVE LONG GONE

187
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
UNPUNISHED.

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A VICIOUS CIVIL WAR NOW IN ITS

THIRD YEAR, MORE THAN 100,000

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
DEAD, NEARLY 2 MILLION REFUGEES.

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
>> THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT.

192
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
THERE IS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF

193
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THE TUNNEL.

194
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> Reporter: CAN ANYTHING BE
DONE?

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000

GROUND ASSAD'S AIR POWER.

197
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
EXPENSIVE AND A LONG-TERM

198
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
COMMITMENT, NOT ACTIVELY BEING

199
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
CONSIDERED.

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ARMING THE REBELS.

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
BUT WASHINGTON WORRIES, WHO

202
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
WOULD GET THE WEAPONS?

203
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
THE REBELS ARE DIVIDED WITH SOME

204
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
LINKED TO AL QAEDA.

205
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
WHAT ABOUT A MILITARY INVASION?

206
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
U.S. BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

207
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
FOR WAR-WEARY AMERICANS, THAT'S

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
NOT EVEN UNDER CONSIDERATION.

209
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
TODAY A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION

210
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000

QUOTE, HUMBLE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN

212
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
AND CANNOT DO.
AND WITH ASSAD BACKED BY RUSSIA,

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IRAN, AND HEZBOLLAH, THERE IS

214
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
LITTLE THE WORLD CAN DO.

215
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THE U.N. HAS PROVEN TO BE

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
UTTERLY POWERLESS.

217
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
IT HAS INSPECTORS IN DAMASCUS

218
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
RIGHT NOW, JUST A FEW MILES FROM

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
WHERE SO MANY DIED YESTERDAY,

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
BUT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WON'T

221
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
LET THEM SEE WHAT COULD BE THE

222
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WORST ATROCITY IN SYRIA'S

223
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
ATROCIOUS WAR.

224
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
IT'S UNCLEAR, LESTER, IF THIS

225
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WILL BE A TURNING POINT OR JUST

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
ANOTHER HORROR IN A WAR NO ONE

227
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
WANTS TO -- SEEMS TO WANT TO

228
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH.

229
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
LESTER?

230
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

231

237
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WEARING A WHITE T-SHIRT, HE WAS

AS HE HEADS OFF TO BEGIN HIS
SENTENCE AT A MILITARY PRISON.

251
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
SO THE QUESTION TONIGHT, WILL HE

252
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
GET HORMONE TREATMENTS AT FT.

253
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000

U.S. SECRETS IN HISTORY.

263
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
BUT IT APPEARS MANNING HAD ONE
LAST SECRET LEFT.

264
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
JUST ONE DAY AFTER BRADLEY

265
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
MANNING WAS SENTENCED TO 35

266
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000

MANNING ASKED TO BE CALLED ONLY

275
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
BY THE NAME CHELSEA AND THE
FEMALE PRONOUN "SHE," NOT "HE."

276
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THE EVIDENCE WAS ALREADY OUT

277
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
THERE.

278
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
THIS PHOTO OF MANNING WEARING A

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000

FOR LEAKING U.S. SECRETS AS

283
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
PROOF OF TRANSGENDER ISSUES.

284
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
BUT MANNING WANTS TO TAKE IT ONE

285
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
STEP FURTHER TOWARD ACTUALLY

286
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
BECOMING A WOMAN.

TAKE IT TO COURT.

298
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000

ULTIMATE DECISION FOR HORMONE

303
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
TREATMENT SHOULD BE UP TO

304
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
MANNING AND A DOCTOR, NOT THE

305
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
WARDEN.

312
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
CONCERN ABOUT MANNING'S SAFETY.

313

THE ARMY REPORTS THAT

314
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
TRANSGENDER PRISONERS ARE MORE

315
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
LIKELY TO BE ASSAULTED BY OTHER

316
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000

317
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
OFFICIALS AT LEAVENWORTH INSIST

318
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THEY'VE TAKEN STEPS TO PROTECT

319
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THOSE PRISONERS LIKE MANNING WHO

320
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
MAY BE AT HIGH RISK.

321
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
AS FOR THE NAME CHANGE, THE
ARMY'S NOT BUYING IT.

322

LETTERS SENT TO MANNING AT FT.

323
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
LEAVENWORTH HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
BRIAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

341
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
>> WELL, LESTER, WHAT HAPPENED

342
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000

SLOW SUMMER DAY TURNED INTO

ANYTHING BUT.

345
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
RIGHT AROUND 12:30 EASTERN TIME,

346
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
AN UNEXPECTED HALT TO TRADING

347
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
BEGAN.

348
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE NAMES.

349
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
APPLE, YOU'VE GOT GOOGLE,

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
MICROSOFT, EVEN FACEBOOK.

351
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
IT WAS A GLITCH, AND WE'VE

352
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
FINALLY GOTTEN A STATEMENT FROM

353
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
THE NASDAQ ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,

354
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
BUT THEY DID NOT GO INTO DETAIL

355
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

356
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
ALL WE KNOW IS THAT STOCK

TRADING FOR NASDAQ-LISTED STOCKS

358
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000

NOW, PRICES IN THE NAMES THAT

361
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
YOU MENTIONED, THOSE NAMES WERE

362
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
NOT IMPACTED.

363
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
AND WITH ABOUT 30 MINUTES LEFT

364
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
TO GO IN TRADING THERE WAS A

365
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
RESUMPTION.
HOWEVER, MANY MARKET

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000

THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW THE

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000

HEAR.

THERE'S GOING TO BE HARDER TIMES
IN LIFE.

507

IT WILL BE OVERWHELMING, SHE

520

THROWING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE AT

730
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
THIS FIRE, BUT THEY'VE MADE

731
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
LITTLE PROGRESS.

732
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
TO SAY THAT THE FIRE CONDITIONS

733
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
ARE EXTREME OUT HERE IS A MAJOR

734
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
UNDERSTATEMENT.

735
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING THE

736
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
HEAT, THE WIND, AND A FIRE THAT

737
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THEY SAY HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN.

738
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
NOW FIREFIGHTERS ARE ACTUALLY

739
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
LOSING GROUND TODAY.

740
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
YESTERDAY THEY HAD THE FIRE 5%

741
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
CONTAINED.

742
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
TODAY, THAT HAS SLIPPED BACK TO

743
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
JUST 2%.

744
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
MORE THAN÷fx 54,000 ACRES HAVE

745
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
BURNED.
AND THAT FIGURE IS MOST

746
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
DEFINITELY IS GOING TO GO UP

747
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
WHEN THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO GO UP

748
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
AND DO AN AERIAL SURVEY.

749
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
