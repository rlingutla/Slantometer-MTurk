IT IS FIRST TWO EFFORTS HAD

LEGAL CATS, BUT THIS THE THIRD

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
TIME MAY JUST BE THE CHARM FOR

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
THE PRESIDENT.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000

A COUPLE OF KEY COLLEAGUES SAY

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
THEY ARE NOT ON BOARD.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
WE WILL SEE WHO WILL NEED TO

TERRIBLE HURRICANE.

00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD, GAS AND

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
THE CLEANUP EFFORT THAT COULD BE

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000

TO SEE THE PRESIDENT CONTINUE TO

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
PUT THE PRESSURE ON HIS OWN

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
PARTY.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
IN HOPES OF AVOIDING ANOTHER

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000

KENTUCKY, MAINE, AND TEXAS.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
ALL OF THOSE ARE STATES, THAT

THEY ARE PULLING OUT ALL THE

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
STOPS TO TRY TO GET THIS THING

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WE'VE BEEN CALLING ON CONGRESS

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
DO.

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000

WE ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000

THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL.

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000

"RICK AND BUBBA SHOW."

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
JOHN McCAIN HAS DONE, A

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TREMENDOUS SLAP IN THE FACE OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
TREMENDOUS.

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
HE WAS GOOD TO GO ALL WEEK LONG,

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
ALL MONTH LONG, HE WAS GOOD TO

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
GO, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THUMBS

121
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
DOWN.
YOU CAN CALL WHAT YOU WANT THAT

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
WAS A -- THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WE DO NOT HAVE IT, BECAUSE OF

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000

HOME SAYING, JOHN McCAIN HAD

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
NEVER INTENTION TO VOTE FOR THE

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
BILL, WHICH IS GOVERNOR LOVES.

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
LET ARIZONA DOWN AND THEN'S WENT

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
ON TO SAY, DEMOCRATS ARE

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
LAUGHINGLY SAME, A MOMENT OF

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
COURAGE.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
ARIZONA WHO RECEIVED 100%

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
INCREASE.

137
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THE PRESENT IS TALK ABOUT THE

138
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
HEALTH CARE COSTS.

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
>> Shepard: THIS HEALTH CARE
AND VOTE.

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE NUCLEAR CRISIS WITH

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
NORTH KOREA LIKE NOTHING WE HAVE

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SEEN SINCE THE COLD WAR.

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THERE'S CLEANUP AND RECOVERY IN

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
PUERTO RICO, AND IN TEXAS, AND

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
OF FLORIDA, AND A LONG, LONG

146
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
LIST COMING AT THE WHITE HOUSE

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

148
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
>> YES, AND THIS STARTED ON

149
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
FRIDAY NIGHT, SHEP, WHEN HE WAS

150
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
DOWN IN ALABAMA AT A RALLY FOR

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
SENATOR LUTHER STRANGE, WHO IS

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
IN THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
AND TOMORROW NIGHT'S PRIMARY.

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THE PRESIDENT ZEROING IN ON

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
RESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN FLAG

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
AND GOING ON TO SAY, HE WISHES

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THE SUM OF THESE NFL OWNERS, ANY

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
TIME THE PLAYER TAKES A KNEE

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
DURING A NATIONAL ANTHEM, WOULD

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
TELL THOSE SOBS THAT THEY ARE

161
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
FIRED.
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
ABOUT THE COMMENTS, WHETHER THEY

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WERE TOO STRIDENT AT THE

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
BRIEFING A SHORT TIME AGO, GIVEN

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
THE REACTION THAT THEY PROVOKED

166
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
OVER THE WEEKEND.
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
>> DID THE PRESIDENT GO TOO FAR?

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
>> I THINK IT IS ALWAYS

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

170
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THE UNITES STATES TO DEFEND OUR

171
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
FLAG, DEFEND THE

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND TO DEFEND

173
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
DIED TO DEFEND A.

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
>> AS HE SAID OVER THE WEEKEND,

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SOME 200 PLAYERS OUT OF 1600

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
EITHER TOOK A KNEE AT THE

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
VARIOUS GAME OR IN THE CASE OF

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS,

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, AND ONE OTHER

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
TEAM, AND ACTUALLY STAYED INSIDE

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE LOCKER ROOM RATHER THAN
COMING OUT.

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION, ALEJANDRO

185
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
VILLANUEVA FOR THE PITTSBURGH

186

243
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000

THE UNITED STATES OR DID NOT

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
TAKE ENOUGH SECURITY PRECAUTIONS

250
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
IN MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

251
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS IS ALL

252
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
ABOUT SECURITY.

253
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING, MAKING
AMERICA SAFE IS MY NUMBER ONE

254
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000

VENEZUELA ON THE LIST, THE STILL

266
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
AMOUNT TO A MUSLIM BAN.

267
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
SIX OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

268
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
TARGETED COUNTRIES ARE MUSLIM,

269
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS ADDED

270
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
NORTH KOREA, WITH FEW VISITORS,

271
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
AND
AND A FEW GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

272
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
FROM VENEZUELA, IS DOES NOT

273
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
CONCEAL THE REAL FACT THAT IT IS

274
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
STILL A MUSLIM BAN.

275
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORIGINAL STANCE

276
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
CANNOT BE CURED BY THROWING

277
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE ENEMY

278
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
LIST.
BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS AT THE

279
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WHITE HOUSE.
JOHN?
>> THE PRESIDENT, SHEP, BELIEVE

280
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THAT BY MODIFYING THE TRAVEL

281
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
BAN, IT WILL PASS MUSTER IN THE

282
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
COURTS.

283
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
YOU BET THEIR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE

284
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THE ACL YOU, WILL GO TO TRY TO

285
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
GET STOPPED AS WELL.

286
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT BY

287
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
WRITING THESE OUT TO INCLUDE

288
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
CHAD AND NORTH KOREA INSERTED

289
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
OFFICIALS FROM VENEZUELA, A GETS

290
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THEM OUT OF THAT IDEA THAT SO

291
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT.

292
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
YOU READ THAT STATEMENT FROM THE

293
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
ACLU, THIS IS SIMPLY MUSLIM BAN,

294
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IT'S HOPEFULLY ONE THAT CAN

295
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
MUSTER IN THE COURTS, BECAUSE

296
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THE RESTRICTIONS ARE TAILORED TO

297
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.

298
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
CERTAINLY, THE WATERFALL OF

299
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
CRITICISM CONTINUES TO BE AIMED

300
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
AT THE PRESIDENT WHETHER IT IS

301
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
ON CAPITOL HILL WITH THE

302
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FROM
CIVIL LIBERTARIAN GROUPS, YOU

303
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS IN

304
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THE COMING DAYS, SHEP, DESPITE

305
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME COURT

306
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
PUT ON HOLD THE HEARINGS THAT

307
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
WERE SCHEDULED FOR THE TENTH

308
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
SAYING, WITH THE NEW TROUBLE
BAND IN PLACE, THOSE HEARINGS

309
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ARE MOOT.

HEALTH CARE.
THAT OVER OR NOT?

314
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT

315
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
THINGS GOING ON WITH THE

316
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
WHITE HOUSE.

317
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THEY ARE PLANNING A NEW TAX

REFORM PLAN THIS WEEK AS WELL.

319
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THEY ARE ASPIRING TO MULTIPLE

THEY'RE CROSSING THE FINGERS

323
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
REALLY, REALLY HOPING THAT

324
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PULL A COUPLE

325
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
OF SENATORS OVER THE LINE AND

326
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
SAY THIS BILL.

327
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS

328
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
ACKNOWLEDGED HIS COMMENTS THAT

329
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN THIS TIME

330
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
AROUND.

331
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
>> Shepard: WHICH OF THOSE

332
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE

333
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
PULLOVER AS YOU DESCRIBED?

334
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> WE WILL HAVE TO SEE A REPORT

335
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SAYS TODAY, BUT IT IS NOT

336
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
LOOKING GOOD.

337
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
VIEWERS, THE REPORT WILL BE A

339
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000

340
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THEY'LL BE SOME GUIDANCE, IT

341
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000

THE NORTH KOREA BACK AND FORTH

347
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
REGARDING NUCLEAR WAR, IT SOUNDS

348
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
LIKE THE NORTH KOREANS ARE NOW

349
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
THREATENING -- THEY ARE

350
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THREATENING TO SHOOT DOWN OUR
JETS IN THAT REGION.

351
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THE WHITE HOUSE -- THEY PLAN TO

352
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
SEE MORE ON THIS?

353
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
>> IS ESCALATING TO A POINT THAT

354
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000

KOREA.

362
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THE PLAN RIGHT NOW NONETHELESS,

363
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
THESE ARE VERY SCARY WORDS

364
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
COMING FROM PERSONALITIES, WHO

365
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
REALLY SEEM TO BE ESCALATING THE

366
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000

AS ONE OF THE SITUATIONS, WHERE

392
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
THEY ARE VERY FEW GOOD OPTIONS,

393
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN

394
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
THINKING AND CONSIDERING WHAT

395
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
THEIR OPTIONS ARE INCLUDING

396
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
MILITARY OPTIONS.

397
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
>> Shepard: YOU WROTE ON THE

WILL GO THROUGH NOW OR IS THERE

400
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
MORE TO COME?

404
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WHAT IS DIFFERENT, ESPECIALLY

405
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
FROM THE FIRST ONE THAT THEY

406
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
PUSH THROUGH JANUARY, IS REALLY
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE HHS

407
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
AND STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE SPENT

408
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
COMING UP WITH A STANDARD THAT

409
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THEY USE TO PICK WHICH COUNTRY

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
POTENTIAL LEGAL CHALLENGES, AND

413
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THIS FOR

414
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
MONTHS AND MONTHS GOING THROUGH

415
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
ALL OF WHAT THEY THINK ARE THE

416
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WANT FROM

417
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
COUNTRIES.

418
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
AS PEOPLE COME TO THE

419
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
UNITED STATES, THINGS LIKE

420
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
WHETHER THOSE COUNTRIES GIVE

421
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THEIR CITIZENS PASSPORTS.

422
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
WHETHER THEY REPORTED STOLEN AND

COUNTERFEIT PASSPORTS TO

424
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000

THE GOVERNMENT SAID, THESE EIGHT

434
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
COUNTRIES OF THE EIGHT COUNTRIES

435
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000

I'm Val. The Orange Money
retirement squirrel from Voya.

447
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I represent the money you save
for the future. See?

448
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We're putting away acorns to
show the importance of being
organized.

449
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's smart. Who's he?

450
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He's the green money you can
spend now. What's up?

451

Oh you know, gonna pay some
bills, maybe buy a new tennis
racket.

452
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Tennis racket for a squirrel?

453
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He's got a killer backhand.

454
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
When it's time to get organized
for retirement, it's time to get
Voya.

SPILL IT MORE NOW ON REPUBLICANS

DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WILL VOTE NO.

466

UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES, IT

467
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
DOES NOT LOOK GOOD FOR THE

TO GET YES VOTES.

479
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
BOTTOM LINE IN THE HALLWAY HERE

OUTSIDE THE COMMITTEE, IT IS

481
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000

GO, BUT THEY'RE GIVING IT THEIR

502
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
BEST SHOT.

>> NOBODY HAS GOT TO BUY A LEMON

523
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE LAST CAR

THERE WERE LINED UP HERE ALL

544
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
DAY.

545
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
THEY REALLY GOT LOUD AROUND 2:00

546
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
OR SO, WHEN SENATORS WERE GOING

547
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
IN TO THE VERY ROOM FOR THIS

548
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000

IT DIED DOWN A LITTLE BIT WHEN

SOME WERE ARRESTED, DISPERSED BY

550
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
TRUMP ATTACKS THEM, AND ATTACKED

720
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
THE NFL, NEVER SINCE THEN, HE

721
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
RATCHETED IT UP SO YOU HAVE 200

725
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
IS AN UGLY DISPUTE RIGHT NOW.

726
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
PEOPLE IN GENERAL DO NOT LIKE IT

727
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000

NATIONAL ANTHEM.

729
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
PROTESTING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

730
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

731
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
>> IT HAS BECOME MORE ABOUT THE

732
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
FLAG, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE THE

733
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000

TO SEE YOU FROM "POLTICO."
KEEP IT UP.

740
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
MORE ON THE SHOWDOWN WITH

741
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
NORTH KOREA AFTER THE

742
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
WHITE HOUSE DISMISSES THE CLAIM

743
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
DECLARED WAR ON NORTH KOREA.

744
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THAT IS COMING UP IN 2 MINUTES

745
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
PAIRED WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE

746
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
MAN WHO POLICE SAY SHOT PEOPLE

747
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
INSIDE A CHURCH IN TENNESSEE.

748
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
IN THE USHER WHO RISKED HIS LIFE

749
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
TO TAKE DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.

750
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
THAT IS STRAIGHTAWAY.

751
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
♪

752
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and I know that we have
Accident Forgiveness.

753
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So the incredibly minor
accident that I had tonight...

754
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Four weeks
without the car.

755
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Okay, yep. Good night.

756
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
With Accident Forgiveness,

757
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
your rates won't go up
just because of an accident.

758
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Switching to Allstate
is worth it.

759
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
your rates won't go up
just because of an accident.
(AVO)
but you also have a higher risk
of heart attack or stroke.

760
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Non-insulin Victoza®
lowers A1C,

761
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
and now reduces
cardiovascular risk.

762
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Victoza® lowers my
A1C and blood sugar

763
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
better than
the leading
branded pill.

764
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
(AVO)
And for people with
type 2 diabetes

765
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
treating cardiovascular disease,
Victoza® is NOW approved

766
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
to lower the risk of major
cardiovascular events

767
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
such as heart attack,
stroke, or death.

768
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And while it isn't
for weight loss,

769
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Victoza® may
help you lose some weight.

770
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
(AVO)
Victoza® is not for people with
type 1 diabetes

771
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
or diabetic ketoacidosis.

772
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do not take Victoza® if you have
a personal or family history

773
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
of medullary thyroid cancer,

774

Multiple Endocrine
Neoplasia syndrome type 2,

775
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
or if you are allergic
to Victoza®

776
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
or any of its ingredients.

777
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Stop taking Victoza® and get
medical help right away

778
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
if you get symptoms of a serious
allergic reaction such as rash,

779
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
swelling, difficulty breathing
or swallowing.

780
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Serious side effects may happen,
including pancreatitis.

781
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So, stop taking Victoza®
and call your doctor right away

782
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
if you have severe pain
in your stomach area.

783
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Tell your doctor
your medical history.

784
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Gallbladder problems have
happened in some people.

785
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Tell your doctor right away
if you get symptoms.

786
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Taking Victoza® with
a sulfonylurea or insulin

787
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
may cause low blood sugar.

788
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Common side effects are nausea,
diarrhea, vomiting,

789
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
decreased appetite,
indigestion, and constipation.

790
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Side effects
can lead to dehydration,

791
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
which may cause kidney problems.

792
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Ask your doctor
about Victoza®.

00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
HE IS PUERTO REAGAN HIMSELF AND

1282
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
HIS LIVE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON.

1283
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
GERALDO, TELL US HOW IT IS FIRST

1284
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
AND?

1285
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
>> SHEP, LET ME WELCOME YOU TO

1286
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
PUERTO RICO ISLAND OF DESPAIR.

1287
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
THE ISLAND GOT RACKED BY

1288
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
HURRICANE IRMA TWO WEEKS AGO.

1289
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
THAT HURRICANE ACT OF 17% OF THE

1290
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
POWER GRID.

1291
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
THEN CAME THE MUCH MORE SAVAGE,

1292
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
POWERFUL HURRICANE MARIA, AND

1293
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED

1294
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
THIS ISLAND.

1295
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL

1296
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.

1297
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
80% OF THE CROPS HAD BEEN

1298
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
DESTROYED.
THERE IS NO ELECTRIC POWER SHEP,

1299
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
THE POLLS ARE DOWN EVERYWHERE.

1300
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
THE LARGE CONDUCTIVE POLLS, THE

1301
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
TELEPHONE POLES, THERE'S VERY

1302
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
LITTLE COMMUNICATION.
SO SERVICE, EXTREMELY SPOTTY.

1303
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
THERE IS NO SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS

1304
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
HAPPENING ON AN ISLAND WITH NO

1305
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
WATER AND NO FUEL THEN THE LINES

1306
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
AT THE SERVICE STATIONS.

1307
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF

1308
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT

1309
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME

1310
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS

1311
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS

1312
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
STATION IN PUERTO RICO.

1313
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
WITHOUT GAS, THEY CAN'T RUN THE

1314
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
GENERATORS THAT THE FEW HAVE TWO

1315
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
POWER THE WATER PUMPS THAT ALLOW
THEM NOT ONLY TO GET WATER TO

1316
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
BATHE AND DRINK, BUT ALSO TO RUN

1317
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
THE TOILET.

1318
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
THIS SITUATION IS AS DIRE AS YOU

1319
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

1320
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN

1321
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION,

1322
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET

1323
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
WORSE.

1324
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
THE MILLION AND A HALF GALLON

1325
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
ALREADY DELIVERED, A DROP IN THE

1326
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
BUCKET, IT IS NEEDED.

1327
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
>> Shepard: IN YOUR OPINION,

1328
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
GERALDO, WITH INTEREST AND A LOT

1329
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
OF LOVE THERE, ARE THEY GOING TO

1330
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
NEED AN AIRLIFT OR BOLT LEFT

1331
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
OUT OF THERE AND TO, OR CAN THEY

1332
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
GET THIS BACK UP AND RUNNING TO

1333
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
GET THIS FROM BEING A NECESSITY?

1334
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
>> SHEP, THERE HAS BEEN AN

1335
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
EXODUS FROM PUERTO RICO SINCE

1336
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.

1337
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
THIS U.S. COMMONWEALTH IS

1338
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
BANKRUPT.

1339
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT

1340
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
THE ISLAND.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE PEOPLE

1341
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
FORCED TO LIVE UNDER THE

1342
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS, THE YOUNG

1343
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
ONES WILL LEAVE.

1344
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
WHAT HAPPENS, THE OLD AND FEEBLE

1345
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
THEY STAY BEHIND, THEN YOU

1346
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
CANNOT LEAVE.

1347
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSER, BY THE WAY.

1348
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
BUSINESSES INCREDIBLY DISRUPTED.

1349
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
OF THE 3.4 MILLION, YOU'LL SEE A

1350
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
TREMENDOUS EXODUS TO FLORIDA,

1351
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
NEW YORK STATE, AND LESS THIS

1352
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
POWER GRID IS RESTORED.

1353
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
IT WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE BEFORE.

1354
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
IT WAS PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION, BY

1355
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
INCOMPETENCE, BY SCANDALOUS

1356
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE PURCHASING

1357
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
FUEL OIL, PURCHASED THE LOW

1358
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
WAS GREAT, IT SOLD FOR THE

1359
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
HIGHEST.
NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.

1360
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
TO BRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN

1361
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
AND THEY ARE NOBLE PEOPLE, AND

1362
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
ARE HELPING, BUT WITH THIS

1363
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
ISLAND NEEDS IS AN ENTIRE NEW

1364
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
POWER GRID.

1365
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A

1366
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
MANY STATES IN THE UNION.

1367
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE

1368
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
IS A.

1369
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
OF SEVERE DISRUPTION.
THEY ARE SAYING THAT 4-6 MONTHS

1370
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
BEFORE THEY GET THE POWER GRID

1371
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
UP AND RUNNING SO PEOPLE WOULD
GENERATORS, THIS WILL BECOME A

1372
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SYMBOL OF WHAT THEY BECOME

1373
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
TODAY.
WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE

1374
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF

1375
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
THE HURRICANES.

1376
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
THE TOURISM HERE ALSO SHREDDED.

1377
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.

1378
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
IT IS BECAUSE -- EIGHT HUGE

1379
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

1380
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL

1381
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE,

1382
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A

1383
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

1384
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
PEOPLE ARE IN DIRE STRAITS.

1385
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
THIS WILL BE A MARSHALL PLAN

1386
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
SCALE REBUILDING OF THE

1387
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
ELECTRICAL GRID BEFORE YOU CAN

1388
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
HAVE THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS

1389
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
WE KNOW IT IN PUERTO RICO.

1390
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
ARMED GUARDS ON THE GASOLINE.

1391
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK INTO THIS

1392
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
CRISIS.
IMAGINE A MONTH FROM NOW OR TWO

1393
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
MONTHS FROM NOW.

1394
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
KNOWING NO ONE HAD A HOT SHOWER,

1395
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
NO ONE CAN FLUSH THE TOILET BUT

1396
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
FOR THE COSTLY INCLUSION OF A

1397
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
GALLON OF GAS IN THE COMMODE.

1398
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO BE

1399
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
LIKE, SHEP.

1400
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
THERE IS NO OVERSTATING THE

1401
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
CRISIS HERE, THE PRESIDENT

1402
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
SHOULD COME.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR

1403
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
HIMSELF.
SEND MARCO RUBIO AND HEAD OF

1404
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
FEMA, THEY ARE HERE TODAY.

1405
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE

1406
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
CAME IN WITH THE PLANE.

1407
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
ALL THOSE GESTURES ARE VERY

1408
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
IMPORTANT, BUT YOU NEED IT

1409
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
SYSTEMIC REFORM, WAY TO BAIL

1410
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
THESE PEOPLE OUT.
IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.

1411
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
MY FAMILY, GOD KNOWS I LOVE

1412
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
THEM.
I LIVED IN THE VERY HOUSE WHEN I

1413
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
WAS A TEENAGER.

1414
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
THEY ARE HIGH-FUNCTIONING, THEIR

1415
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
CHILDREN HAVE BECOME DOCTORS.

1416
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL

1417
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE

1418
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.

1419
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR

1420
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN

1421
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT

1422
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY,

1423
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA

1424
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.

1425
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
SPILLED BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR

1426
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE OF

1427
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
PUERTO RICO
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

1428
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
>> Shepard: WALL STREET WILL

1429
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
BE SHUTTING DOWN FOR THE DAY AND

1430
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
JUST ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND 15

1431
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
SECONDS.

1432
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
IT HAS BEEN A DOWN DAY.

1433
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
THE TACK

1434
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
GOT WALLOPED TODAY, BUT THERE IS

1435
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
SOME BRIGHT SPOT.

1436
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
NO CAVUTO CAN ALWAYS FIND HIM.

1437
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
YOU'LL START LOOKING FOR THEM

1438
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
WHEN "YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL

1439
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
CAVUTO BEGINS RIGHT AFTER THIS

1440
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT, WHO IS

1441
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
READY FOR A LITTLE FOOTBALL

1442
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
TONIGHT?

1443
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
FOUR AND A HALF HOURS FROM
MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, AND IT

1444
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
COULD BE ONE FOR THE BOOKS.

1445

AT 8:30 P.M. AND AT GLENDALE,

1446
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
ARIZONA, THE ARIZONA CARDINALS

1447
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
ARE TAKING ON JERRY JONES AND

1448
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
THE DALLAS COWBOYS.

1449
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
JERRY JONES, OF COURSE, FAMOUS

1450
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
FOR SAYING, HE LIKES HIS PLAYERS

1451
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
TO RESPECT THE FLAG, NOT A FAN

1452
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
OF COLLIN KAEPERNICK LAST WEEK.

1453
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
SAY TO F THE END, A WEEK AGO

1454
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
, IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO

1455
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
ANYTHING THAN UNDER THE FLAG.

1456
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
THEY'LL BE TESTED TONIGHT.

1457
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000

1458
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
