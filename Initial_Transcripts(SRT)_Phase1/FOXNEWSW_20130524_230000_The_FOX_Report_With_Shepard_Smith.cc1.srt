POINT IF HE HAD BEEN IN THE

MIDDLE LANE HE LIKELY WOULD

113
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
HAVE CLEARED IT UP.

Why are twice as many people  choosing
Verizon  over any other carrier?

388
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Many choose us because we have  the

A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS JUST
RULED THAT SHERIFF JOE

418
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
ARPAIO USED HIS OFFICE IN

419
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
ARIZONA TO RACIALLY PROFILE

420
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
IMMIGRATION PATROLS.

421
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
IT'S THE FIRST TIME A JUDGE

422
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
HAS RULED ON THIS ISSUE

423
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
AGAINST A GUY WHO CALLS

424
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
HIMSELF THE TOUGHEST

425
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000

THE JUDGE RULED THE

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
DEPUTIES ALSO DRAGGED OUT

434
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THOSE TRAFFIC STOPS.

435
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
SO FAR NO RESPONSE FROM

436
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO.

437
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
JOEST ARIAS WAS NOT A GOOD

438

WITNESS.

439
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
THOSE WERE SOME OF THE

FIRST PUBLIC RARNTION FROM

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
THE JURY FOREMAN ONE DAY

442
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
AFTER JURORS REVEALED THEY

443
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
WERE HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED

444
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
OVER WHETHER SHE SHOULD

445
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
LIVE OR DIE.

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THE FOREMAN SPOKE TO ABC'S

GOOD MORNING AMERICA.

448
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
DID HE NOT COMMENT ON THE

449
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
FEJT PHASE OF HER MURDER

450
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
TRIAL ITSELF.
HE DID EXPLAIN WHY JODI

451
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
ARIAS MAY HAVE HURT HER OWN

452
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
CASE BY TAKING THE STAND.

453
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
>> WE'RE CHARGED WITH GOING

454
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
IN TO PRESUMING INNOCENCE

455
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
RIGHT?
BUT SHE WAS ON THE STAND

456
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
FOR SO LONG THERE WERE SO

457
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
MANY CONTRADICTING STORIES.

458
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
>> Shepard: PROSECUTORS SAY
JODI ARIAS STABBED HER

459
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
EX-BOYFRIEND 27 TIMES, SHOT

460
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
HIM AND SLIT HIS THROAT.

461
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
ARIAS INITIALLY SAID SHE

462
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE

463
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
MURDER.

464
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THEN SHE BLAMED IT ON

465
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
INTRUDERS WEARING MASKS AND

466
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THEN TESTIFIED THAT SHE DID

467
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
SHOOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE.

468
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OF COURSE, THE MURDER

469
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
CONVICTION STANDS.
BUT THE JUDGE SAYS IT'S NOW

470
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
UP TO A NEW JURY TO

471
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
DETERMINE WHETHER SHE GETS

472
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
THE DEATH PENALTY.

473
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
ADAM HOUSLEY IS LIVE IN OUR

474
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
WEST COAST NEWSROOM.

475
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THIS CAN'T BEGIN UNTIL,

476
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
WHAT, JULY AT THE VERY

477
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
EARLIEST.

478
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, SHEPARD.

479
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THE JUDGE SET DOWN JULY AS

480
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
THE DATE THAT A NEW JURY

481
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
WOULD BE IMPANELED

482
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
BASICALLY.

483
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO

484
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THROUGH THE ENTIRE JURY

485
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
SELECTION AGAIN.

486
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
CLIFF NOTES OF THE TRIAL TO

487
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT

488
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
JODI ARIAS WOULD GET THE

489
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
DEATH PENALTY OR NOT.

490
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THIS HAS HAPPENED FIVE

491
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
TIMES IN BEFORE IN ARIZONA

492
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A HUNG

493
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
JURY.

494
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
OF THOSE FIVE TIMES FOUR

495
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
TIMES THE D.A. HAS DECIDED

496
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
THEY WON GETTING THE DEATH

497
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
PENALTY VERDICT.

498
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
IF THE D.A. DOES STICK TO

499
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
HIS GUNS AND SAY HE IS

500
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
GOING TO TRY TO GO FOR THE

501
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
DEATH PENALTY AND CALL THIS

502
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
JURY AS THE JUDGE HAS

503
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
DIRECTED IN JULY IT MAY BE

504
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A GOOD SIGN FOR THE D.A.

505
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
AND A BAD SIGN FOR JODI

506
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
ARIAS.

507
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> THEY ARE GOING TO BE

508
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
TOLD THAT THEY NEED TO

509
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
ASSUME THAT THIS WAS

510
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
PLANNED, PREMEDITATED

511
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
MURDER.
HE THEY ARE GOING TO HEAR

512
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
HOW HEINOUS IT IS.

513
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
AND THIS JURY IS GOING TO

514
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
BE A LOT MORE LIKELY TO

515
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
HAVE NO AUTO FIN AT THIS OR

516
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
CONNECTION WITH JODY AND

517
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
JUST SAY THIS IS A

518
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
CALCULATED, PREMEDITATED

519
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
MASSACRE.

520
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AND THIS NEW JURY, SHEPARD,

521
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
AGAIN, IF IT DOES GO

522
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
FORWARD IN JULY ALSO

523
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
WOULDN'T HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE JODI

524
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
ARIAS ON TELEVISION.

525
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
WHY?

526
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
BECAUSE SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO

527
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
SAID NO MORE TV INTERVIEWS

528
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
FOR MS. ARIAS.

529
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
SHEPARD?

530
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
>> Shepard: TRAVIS

531
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
ALEXANDER'S FAMILY TOLD US

532
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
THE FAMILY DOES NOT WANT TO

533
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
GIVE UP ON DEATH PENALTY.

534
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
TODAY ON "STUDIO B" SHE

535
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
EXPLAINED WHY.

536
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
>> WHILE SHE IS ON THE

537
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
STAND FOR HER 18 DAYS,

538
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
THERE IS SEVERAL POINTS

539
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
THAT SHE MADE THAT A LOT OF

540
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
US WERE THERE FOR AND WE

541
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
KNOW SHE IS LYING.

542
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
IF THERE WAS A THIRD OPTION

543
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
TO HAVE HER ON DEATH ROW

544
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
AND IT WOULDN'T MATTER ONE

545
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
WAY OR ANOTHER WHETHER SHE

546
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
WAS PUT TO DEATH OR NOT BUT

547
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
SHE WAS IN THAT SECLUSION

548
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
WHERE SHE WAS ISOLATED

549
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
BUT IF THAT'S NOT AN

550
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OPTION, THEN DEATH IS THE

551
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
OPTION THAT THE FAMILY

552
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WANTS.
THEY WANT HER TO IT BE ON

553
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
DEATH ROW.

554
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
>> Shepard: SHE ADDED TODAY

555
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
THAT NOT SURPRISINGLY THE

556
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
VICTIM'S RELATIVES HAVE

557
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME.

558
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THE MAYOR OF TORONTO DOES

559
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
NOT SPOKE CRACK.

560
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
THAT'S THE WORD FROM THE
MAYOR OF TORONTO.

561
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
HE HELD A NEWS CONFERENCE A

562
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
WEEK AFTER STARTING -- WE

563
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
STARTED HEARING ABOUT A

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
KIND OF A WAY OF CUTTING

974
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000

975
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000

978
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS DEFENDED

979
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000

RUNNING INVESTIGATION FOR

983
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000

ANDY CARD TOLD US TODAY

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD

988
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
DO IS FIND SOME INDEPENDENT

989
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
PERSON EITHER WITHIN THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR

990
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
OUTSIDE TO COME IN AND

991
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
ACTUALLY LEAD THIS REVIEW.

992
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

993
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
>> WELL I HOPE THE

994
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD SAY

995
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I AM NOT GOING TO

996
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
INVESTIGATE MYSELF.

997
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'M GOING TO APPOINT THIS

998
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
PERSON WHO I AM NOT GOING

999
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
TO DIRECT TO TAKE A LOOK AT

1000
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
IT.

1001
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
>> NOW, SENIOR DEMOCRATS

1002
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
THOUGH TELL ME THAT'S NOT

1003
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1004
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
THEY BELIEVE INSIDE THE

1005
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
HOUSE THAT IN FACT THIS

1006
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
WILL BE A THOROUGH

1007
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
INVESTIGATION.
AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS I'M

1008
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
HEARING FROM DEMOCRATS

1009
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
CLOSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE

1010
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT HAPPY

1011
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
WITH WHAT WAS DONE WITH

1012
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
JAMES ROSEN.

1013
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE A

1014
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
CRIMINAL COCONSPIRATOR.

1015
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
THEY REALIZE THAT WAS A

1016
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
GOVERNMENT OVERREACH AND

1017
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT

1018
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
HAS DEMANDED THIS REVIEW

1019
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
SHEP.
>> Shepard: WHITE HOUSE

1020
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
OFFICIALS INSIST THEY WILL

1021
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
NOT PROTECT THE JUSTICE

1022
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
DEPARTMENT.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1023
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THEY SAY LOOK NO FURTHER

1024
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
THAN THE PRESIDENT'S OWN

1025
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
BLUNT WORDS YESTERDAY.

1026
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
WHEN HE GAVE THAT SPEECH

1027
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
ABOUT THE BALANCE IN TERMS

1028
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
OF DEALING WITH FIGHTING

1029
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
TERRORISM, WHETHER HE USED

1030
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
DRONES AND OTHER TOOLS, HE

1031
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
ALSO TALKED ABOUT THESE

1032
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
LEAK INVESTIGATIONS AND THE

1033
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
BALANCE THERE.

1034
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY

1035
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
DIRECT IN SAYING

1036
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
JOURNALISTS SHOULD NOT BE

1037
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
PROSECUTED AS HE SAID FOR

1038
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
DOING THEIR JOBS.

1039
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THEN HE SAID THIS:

1040
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
>> AND I HAVE RAISED THESE

1041
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
ISSUES WITH THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL WHO SHARES MY

1042
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
CONCERNS.
SO HE HAS AGREED TO REVIEW

1043
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
EXISTING DEPARTMENT OF

1044
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000

GOVERNING INVESTIGATIONS

1045
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
THAT INVOLVE REPORTERS.

1046
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
AND HE WILL CONVENE A GROUP

1047
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
OF MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS TO

1048
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
HEAR THEIR CONCERNS AS PART

1049
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
OF THAT REVIEW.

1050
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
>> AND THEY SAY INSIDE THE

1051
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
WHITE HOUSE THAT THIS IS

1052
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
SORT OF A MIDDLE STEP

1053
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT CAN'T

1054
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
JUST PICK UP THE PHONE EVEN

1055
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
IF HE HE DISAGREES WITH

1056
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000

1058
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THAT WOULD BE MET LING WITH

1059
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

1060
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THAT WOULD BE A BIGGER

1061
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
SCANDAL.

1062
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
>> Shepard: TRIBUTE TO FOUR

1063
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000

THREE OF THOSE GIRLS WERE

1123
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
BECAUSE FOR ONE THING I

1124
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
KNOW THAT WHAT HE SHE WILL

1125
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
DO IS REASSERT HER RIGHTS

THERE IS A 99.99 CHANCE

1129
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000

ON LEAVE.

1137
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
RECEIVING HER PAYCHECK.

1138
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLEAD

1139
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND YOU

1140
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000

APPEARS TO BE A FUNGAL

NEARLY 35 MILLION TRAVELERS

ALTHOUGH THAT NUMBER IS

1237
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
DOWN 1% FROM A YEAR AGO.

1238
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
PART OF THE REASON COULD BE

1239
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
HIGHER GAS PRICES ANALYSTS

1240
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000

1241
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
GAS HAS SOARED AS MUCH AS

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000

THEY SAY REFINERY ISSUES.

1245
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
OVERALL THOUGH FOLKS

1246
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE

1247
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000

HOW DO PEOPLE SAY THEY ARE

1256
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
CHANGING THEIR VACATION

1257
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
PLANS.
THE COAT ON MEMORIAL DAY

1258
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
MIGHT HAVE PART OF IT.

1259
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
>> YEAH.

1260
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
COLD FRONT CAME IN THROUGH

1261
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
HERE, SHEPARD.

1262
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO

1263
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
THE BEACH TOMORROW BUT IT

1264
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
IS THE OFFICIAL START OF

1265
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THE UNOFFICIAL START OF THE

1266
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
SUMMER HOLIDAY SEASON.

1267
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
AND IT IS STARTING WITH THE

1268
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
HIGHEST GAS PRICES FOR A

1269
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
MEMORIAL DAY IN TWO YEARS

1270
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
WITH PRICES FOR REGULAR

1271
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
GALLON OF GAS UP 15 CENTS

1272
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
JUST IN THE LAST MONTH

1273
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
ALONE.

1274
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
AND IN 8 STATES ACCORDING

1275
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
TO A.A.A. GAS IS ABOVE $4 A

1276
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
GALLON.

1277
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
PART OF THE REASON AS YOU

1278
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
MENTIONED, IS BECAUSE OF

1279
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
REFINERIES WITH MAINTENANCE

1280
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
AND REPAIR ISSUES.

1281
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
WHICH HAS HURT GASOLINE

1282
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
SUPPLIES.

1283
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
TRIPLE A SURVEYED DRIVERS

1284
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
ABOUT WHETHER HIGHER PRICES

1285
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
WOULD EFFECT THEIR MEMORIAL

1286
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
DAY TRAVEL PLANS.

1287
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE

1288
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
PEOPLE SAID NO, BUT THE

1289
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
REST SAID YES.

1290
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
27 PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD

1291
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
TRY TO SAVE MONEY IN OTHER

1292
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
AREAS ON THEIR MEMORIAL DAY

1293
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
VACATION.
8 PERCENT SAID THEY WOULD

1294
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
TAKE SHORTER TRIPS AND

1295
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
3 PERCENT SAID THEY

1296
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WOULDN'T DRIVE AT ALL.

1297
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
THEY WOULD FIND SOME

1298
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION

1299
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
SHEPARD.

1300
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
>> Shepard: SO GAS IS KIND

1301
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
OF HIGH.
WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK COMING

1302
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
UP?

1303
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
>> WELL TRIPLE A THINKS

1304
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
THAT PRICES WILL START

1305
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
FALLING SHORTLY.

1306
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
>> SO WE DO EXPECT PRICES

1307
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
SHOULD DROP IN THE COMING

1308
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
DAYS GIVEN THE FACT THAT

1309
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
SOME REFINERIES ARE COMING

1310
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
BACK ONLINE THAT'S

1311
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
RESULTING IN GAS INCREASE

1312
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
REDUCTION AND OIL PRICE

1313
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
DROP AS WELL.
OIL PRICES SHOULD DROP IN

1314
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
JUNE.
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO YOU

1315
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
ANY GOOD FOR MEMORIAL DAY.

1316
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
>> AND A STATE HARDEST HIT

1317
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
BY THOSE REFINERY PROBLEMS

1318
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
MINNESOTA WHERE PRICES ARE

1319
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
UP 80 CENTS A GALLON JUST

1320
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
IN THE LAST MONTH.

1321
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
SHEPARD?

1322
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000

BARNES LIVE IN CHEVY CHASE,

1324
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
MARYLAND TONIGHT.
THE WEATHER WILL NOT BE

1325
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
COOPERATING MUCH AT ALL FOR
THE EAST COAST WHERE IT IS

1326
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
EXPECTED TO FEEL MORE LIKE

1327
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
WINTER THAN THE START OF

1328
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
SUMMER.

1329
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
COLD, WET, EVEN WORD OF

1330
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
SNOW IN SOME PARS.

FOX 5.

1333
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
>> WHAT A HORRIBLE WAY TO

1334
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
START THE WEEKEND IN THE

1335
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
NORTHEAST.

1336
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
COLD AND RAINY ALL DAY

1337
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
LONG.
MORE TONIGHT AND EVEN INTO

1338
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
TOMORROW.

1339
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
WE HAVE AN AREA OF LOW

1340
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
PRESSURE THAT IS SITTING
JUST TO OUR EAST AND ON THE

1341
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
BACK SIDE OF IT COLD AIR IS

1342
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
BEING PULLED IN FROM CANADA

1343
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
AND RAINY WEATHER

1344
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
PERSISTENT AS THIS AIR IS

1345
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
GOING TO BE SLOW TO MOVE

1346
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
OUT OF THE REGION.

1347
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
THIS THE 30'S AND 40S IN

1348
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
THE GREAT LAKES ALL THE WAY

1349
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
INTO THE NEW ENGLAND AND

1350
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOUT

1351
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
2500 FEET WE COULD ACTUALLY

1352
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
SEE SOME WET SNOW COMING

1353
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
OUT OF THE SKIES TONIGHT.

1354
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
THAT'S RIGHT.

1355
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
SNOW.

1356
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
IT WON'T BE ACCUMULATING

1357
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
BUT ENOUGH TO CAUSE A MAJOR

1358
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
NUISANCE CONSIDERING THIS

1359
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
IS THE UNOFFICIAL START OF

1360
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
SUMMER AND STILL LOOKS LIKE

1361
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
WINTER OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW.

1362
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
ELSEWHERE AROUND THE NATION

1363
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
WE DO HAVE SOME RAIN COMING

1364
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
THROUGH MINNESOTA THERE IS

1365
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
THE POTENTIAL FOR SLIGHT

1366
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
RISK OF SEVERE

1367
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE

1368
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
WESTERN DAKOTAS AND WESTERN

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
NEBRASKA TOMORROW.

1370
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
FLOODING RAINS TO OUR SOUTH

1371
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
TEXAS TODAY AND THAT WET

1372
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
WEATHER IS GOING TO MOVE

1373
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
SLIGHTLY EASTWARD AS WE GET

1374
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
INTO THE DAY TOMORROW.

1375
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
OUT TOWARDS THE WEST

1376
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
SCATTERED SHOWERS IN

1377
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
SEATTLE.
NICE AND DRY ACROSS THE

1378
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
FOUR CORNER STATES.

1379
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
ALSO FINDING SOME BIG HEAT

1380
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
WITH THAT WILL ALSO COME

1381
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
THE POTENTIAL FOR FIRE

1382
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
DANGER ACROSS NORTHERN

1383
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
PARTS OF ARIZONA INTO THE

1384
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
FOUR CORNERS.

1385
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
BE AWARE OF THAT COOL IN

1386
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THE NORTHWEST BUT SEATTLE

1387
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
COMING IN THE LOW 60'S.

1388
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
IF YOU WANT SOME HOT NICE

1389
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000

GULF COAST IS GOING TO GET

1391
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THE BEST PART OF THE START

1392
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
OF THE MEMORIAL DAY

1393
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
WEEKEND.
THAT'S WHERE WE WILL FIND

1394
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
READINGS ACE FROM NEW

1395
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
ORLEANS TO SOUTH FLORIDA.

1396
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
TOMORROW MORNING START OFF

1397
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
WITH NEAR RECORD LOWS

1398
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
CAROLINAS.

1399
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
REBOUND NICELY IN THE
AFTERNOON WITH THE HIGH

1400
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
TEMPERATURES MOVING INTO

1401
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
THE 70s.

1402
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
SHEP, OVER TO YOU.

1403
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
>> Shepard: AUDREY, THANKS.

1404
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
JUST IN TIME FOR HURRICANE

1405
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
SEASON A KEY SATELLITE THAT

1406
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
TRACKS SEVERE WEATHER ALL
UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST

1407
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
HAS FAILED FOR THE SECOND

1408
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
TIME IN TWO YEARS.

1409
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
RESEARCHERS SAY THE

1410
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
SATELLITE STARTED HAVING

1411
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
ISSUES ON WEDNESDAY WHEN IT

1412
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
FAILED TO RELAY IMAGES BACK

1413
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
TO IRTD.

1414
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
IN THE MEANTIME SCIENTISTS

1415
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
SAY THEY HAVE ACTIVATED A

1416
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
SPARE SATELLITE WHERE WHILE

1417
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
THEY WORKED TO FIX THE ONE

1418
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
THAT'S UP THERE BROKEN.

1419
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
NO WORD ON WHEN THEY MIGHT

1420
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
GET THAT PRIMARY SATELLITE

1421
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
BACK UP AND RUNNING.

1422
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
WELL, YOU WOULD NOT THINK

1423
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
THAT A LITTLE WATER WOULD

1424
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
BE SUCH A BIG PROBLEM FOR

1425
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
FISH.

1426
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
BUT THE STORM SURGE FROM

1427
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
SUPER STORM SANDY CAUSED

1428
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
MAJOR DAMAGE AT THE NEW

1429
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
YORK AQUARIUM.

1430
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
TONIGHT, A LOOK AT ALL THE

1431
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
HARD WORK THAT'S GONE INTO

1432
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
THE CLEAN UP THERE AND TALK

1433
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
ABOUT A COME BACK.

1434
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
ONE OF THE AREAS IN SANDY'S

1435
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
PATH HAS JUST TAKEN THE TOP

1436
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
SPOT IN A NEW POLL OF THE

1437
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
NATION'S BEST BEACHES.

1438
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
SO WHERE IS THAT?

1439
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
IT'S COMING UP AS FOX

1440
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
REPORTS THIS FRIDAY FOR

1441
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
MEMORIAL DAY.

1442
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Why are twice as many people  choosing
Verizon  over any other carrier?

1443
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Many choose us because we have  the
largest 4GLTE network.

1444
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Others, because of our  reputation
for reliability.

1445
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Or maybe it's because  we've received

1446
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
JD Power

1447
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and Associates' customer service

1448
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
award 4X in a row.

1449
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
In the end  there are countless reasons.

1450
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But one choi.

1451
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000

HEIGHTS TO MARK THE

1463
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
RECOVERY OF THE STORM BY
CUTTING A RIVER MORE THAN 5

1464
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
AND A HALF MILES LONG.

1465
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
THE GUINNESS WORLD RECORD

1466
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000

VISITORS.

1470
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
NOW HE JUST NEEDS THE
WEATHER TO COOPERATE.

1471
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
MORE SIGNS OF PROGRESS

1472
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
TONIGHT IN THE RECOVERY
FROM THAT HURRICANE.

1473
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
THE NEW YORK AQUARIUM IS

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000

1476
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
IT IS JUST OFF CONEY

ISLAND, THE BOARD WALK

1478
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
THERE AND PLAYS AN
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

1479
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
COMMUNITY.
IT NORMALLY BRINGS IN

1480
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
TOURISTS AND SCHOOL GROUPS

1481
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.

1482
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000

SEVERE DAMAGE ACROSS THE

1486
