1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
THE BIG PICTURE HAS TO COME

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
FIRST.
TO MY MIND THAT'S

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
>> HERE WE ARE WATCHING

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
LADY EXIT AIR FORCE ONE AS THEY

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
COME TO MEET THE CHINESE

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
PRESIDENT.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'LL HAND IT OVER TO SHEPARD

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
SMITH.
>> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WEST COAST.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
3:00 ON THE EAST COAST.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
WE'RE WATCHING THREE MAJOR

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
BREAKING NEWS EVENTS.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
FIRST, SOUTH FLORIDA WHERE

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS JUST

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
ARRIVED.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
MOMENTS AGO, SECRETARY OF STATE

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
TILLERSON SAID THE SECOND MAJOR

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
SIGNAL OF AN AMERICAN POLICY

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
CHANGE TOWARDS SYRIA.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
HE SAID THE UNITED STATES IS

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
ORGANIZING AN INTERNATIONAL

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
COALITION TO RESPOND TO BASHAR

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AL-ASSAD'S CHEMICAL ATTACK ON

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
DOES THIS MEAN AMERICAN MILITARY

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
ACTION IN SYRIA?

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
IT'S BREAKING NOW.

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
ON CAPITOL HILL, WE JUST WATCHED

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
HISTORY UNFOLD.

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A MOVE ON THE SENATE FLOOR THAT

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
COULD FOREVER CHANGE CONGRESS

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
AND ALSO THE UNITED STATES

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
SUPREME COURT FOR MANY

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
GENERATIONS TO COME.

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE NUCLEAR

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
OPTION.

38
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
TODAY THE SENATE REPUBLICANS

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
BLEW IT UP.

40
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
THE FALL-OUT COULD BE

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
EXTRAORDINARY.
WE'LL EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT IT

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
MEANS AND WHY IT MATTERS SO

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
MUCH.
AND SHAKE-UP IN THE RUSSIA

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
INVESTIGATION.
THE REPUBLICAN CHAIR OF THE

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

46
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
AGREES TO STEP ASIDE AS HE IS

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
NOW UNDER INVESTIGATION.

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
DEVIN NUNES BLAMING WHAT HE

49
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
CALLS ACCUSATIONS FROM LEFT-WING

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
GROUPS.

51
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
AHEAD YOU'LL HEAR THE MAN WHO IS

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
TAKING OVER.

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
AND WHY THE IRS TOOK MILLIONS OF

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
DOLLARS FROM PEOPLE THAT DID

55
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG.

56
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
WHO ARE THE VICTIMS?

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
LET'S GET TO IT.

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
IT IS RARE TO HAVE THIS MANY

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
ENORMOUS STORIES BREAKING AT ONE

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
TIME.
WE ARE AT THAT TIME.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
WE'LL TAKE YOU TO THE FALL-OUT

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
FROM SECRETARY OF STATE

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
TILLERSON'S BLOCKBUSTER

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
ANNOUNCEMENT.

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
BUT FIRST, THE UNITED STATES

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
LEGISLATIVELY SPEAKING, THE

67
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ADULTS IN THE ROOM, WHEN THE

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
COUNTRY GOES TOO FAR LEFT OR

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
RIGHT, THE SENATE WOULD COOL

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THINGS OFF.

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
FIND SOMETHING CLOSER TO THE

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
MIDDLE SO THE NATION DOESN'T

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
SLIDE TO THE EXTREME.

74
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THE SENATE.
THE GUARDRAILS OF DEMOCRACY.

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
IF THE LEGISLATIVE BUS CAREENS

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OVER THE LEFT OR RIGHT, THE

77
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
GUARDRAILS BOUNCE THE BUS BACK

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TO THE MIDDLE.

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
IT SERVED OUR REPUBLIC WELL FOR

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A COUPLE CENTURIES.

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
ONLY A SORT OF LEGISLATIVE

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
NUCLEAR EXPLOSION COULD CHANGE

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
THAT.
FOR INSTANCE, SUSPEND THE RULES

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
TO CHANGE THE TRADITION SO THE

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
SENATE IS MORE LIKE THE HOUSE

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
AND ONLY NEEDS 51 VOTES INSTEAD

87
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OF 60 TO GET BIG THINGS DONE.

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN OPTION.

89
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
AT LEAST SINCE 1957 AFTER A

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THREAT IN 1917 AND TODAY THE

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
SENATE EXERCISED THAT NUCLEAR

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
OPTION.

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
AS OF LAST HOUR, WE'RE IN A NEW

94
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
LEGISLATIVE WORLD.
IT MARKS A HISTORIC CHANGE TO

95
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
SENATE NORMS THAT COULD AFFECT

96
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR REPUBLIC

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
BEYOND ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES.

98
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
THE MOVE LETS REPUBLICANS IN

99
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
THIS CASE ADVANCE PRESIDENT

100
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE,

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
NEIL GORSUCH WITH A SIMPLY

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
MAJORITY OF 51 VOTES INSTEAD OF

103
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
60.
IT SET AS PRECEDENT THAT

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
ANALYSTS SAY THAT WILL ALLOW ANY

105
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
PARTY TO CONTROL THE SENATE TO

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
APPROVE SUPREME COURT NOMINEES

107
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
WITHOUT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.

108
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH PARTIES ARE

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
BLAMING EACH OTHER.

110
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE TRUTH BE TOLD, THEY'RE ALL

111
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
TO BLAME.

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
REPUBLICANS SAY THEY HAD TO USE

113
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THE NUCLEAR OPTION BECAUSE

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
DEMOCRATS FILIBUSTERED JUST

115
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
GORSUCH'S NOMINATION.

116
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HIS NOMINATION VOTE IS SET FOR

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TOMORROW.

118
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
DEMOCRATS ARE BLAMING GOP

119
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
LEADERS BECAUSE THEY NEVER HELD

120
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
HEARINGS FOR MERRICK GARLAND.

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
MITCH McCONNELL SAID DEMOCRATS

122
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
OVER THE YEARS HAVE REPEATEDLY

123
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
RAISED THE STAKES IN

124
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
CONFIRMATION BATTLES.

125
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> THE OPPOSITION TO THIS

126
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
PARTICULAR NOMINEE IS MORE ABOUT

127
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THE MAN THAT NOMINATED HIM AND

128
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THE PARTY HE REPRESENTS THAN THE

129
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
NOMINEE HIMSELF.
IT'S PART OF A MUCH LARGER

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
STORY, ANOTHER EXTREME

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
ESCALATION IN THE LEFT'S

132
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
NEVER-ENDING DRIVE TO POLITICIZE

133
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THE COURTS AND THE CONFIRMATION

134
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
PROCESS.

135
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
>> THE REPUBLICANS SAY HARRY

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
REID STARTED ALL OF THIS IN 2013

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
WHEN HE ALLOWED THE SAME NUCLEAR

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
OPTION FOR OBAMA'S NOMINEES FOR

139
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
EVERYONE EXCEPT THE SUPREME

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
COURT.
AND THEN MITCH McCONNELL CALLED

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IT A DEMOCRATIC POWER GRAB AND A

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SAD DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE

143
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
SENATE.
THAT WAS 2013.

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE CURRENT SENATE MAJORITY

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER SAID

146
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
DEMOCRATS AT THE TIME HAD TO USE

147
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THE NUCLEAR OPTION BECAUSE

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
REPUBLICANS WERE USING THE

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
FILIBUSTER TO STONEWALL

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
NOMINEES.

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
>> THE TRUTH IS, OVER THE LONG

152
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
HISTORY OF PARTISAN COMBAT OVER

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS, THERE'S

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
BLAME ON BOTH SIDES.

155
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
WE BELIEVE THE BLAME SHOULD NOT

156
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
BE SHARED EQUALLY BETWEEN

157
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

158
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
WE BELIEVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
HAS BEEN FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THE ESCALATION OF TACTICS AND IN

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THE SELECTION OF EXTREME

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
JUDICIAL CANDIDATES WHILE

163
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
DEMOCRATS HAVE TENDED TO SELECT

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
JUDGES CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE.

165
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
>> OF COURSE HE DOES.

166
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
HE'S THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER.

167
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THE REPUBLICANS SAY THE SAME

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS.

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
MANY DEMOCRATS EVEN ADMITTED

170
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
LONG BEFORE TODAY THAT THEY

171
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT THEY

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
DID IN 2013 BECAUSE IT HAS HURT

173
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
THE BODY, BUT THEY DID.

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
SO NOW NO MORE SUPER MAJORITY

175
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
NECESSARY IN THE SENATE.

176
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
FOR JUDGES, SUPREME COURT

177
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
JUSTICES.

178
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
IF THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DOMINOES FALLING, FIRST JUDGES

180
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
IN 2013, NOW SUPREME COURT

181
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
JUSTICES, THE QUESTION IS WILL

182
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THERE COME A TIME THAT THE

183
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SENATE MIGHT SUSPEND THE RULES

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
TO CHANGE THE RULES FOR ALL

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
LEGISLATION?

186
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THAT IS POSSIBLE.
THAT IS SORT OF HOW FALLING

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
DOMINOES TEND TO WORK.

188
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

189
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
MAYBE WE'LL NEVER GET THERE.

190
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
STILL YOU COULD ARGUE OUR

191
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
POLITICS HAVE BEEN SO POLARIZED

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THAT THE RULES ARE JUST CATCHING

193
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
UP WITH THE STATE OF POLITICAL

194
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AFFAIRS.

195
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
ONE JUST CHANGED AND THE PROCESS

196
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
OF RUNNING OUR NATION CHANGED

197
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WITH IT.

198
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
MIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE ON CAPITOL

199
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HILL.
MIKE A DAY FOR THE HISTORY

200
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
BOOKS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, SHEP.

201
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE IMPACT.

202
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
MISSOURI SENATOR CLAIRE

203
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
McCASKILL QUESTIONED HER PARTY'S

204
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
STRATEGY.
SHE SUGGESTED IF THE NEXT

205
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
VACANCY HAPPENS TO BE JUSTICE

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
RUTH BADER GINSBERG, ANTHONY

207
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
KENNEDY OR STEPHEN BREYER,

208
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
DEMOCRATS WILL LIVE TO REGRET

209
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
NOT HAVING THE FILIBUSTER.

210
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
>> IT'S A BAD -- A VERY SAD DAY

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
FOR THE SENATE.

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOW DESTROYED

213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
200 YEARS OF TRADITION OF

214
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
REQUIRING 60 VOTES WHICH MEANING

215
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE BIPARTISAN

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
APPROACH TO THESE ISSUES AND

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
THESE APPOINTMENTS.

218
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I THINK WE'RE ON A SLIPPERY

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
SLOPE.
>> A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

220
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
OTHER REPUBLICANS WERE FURIOUS

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WITH CHUCK SCHUMER.

222
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THE SENATE CHAIRMAN ACCUSED OF

223
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
TREATING JUDGE GORSUCH UNFAIRLY.

224
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
>> THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, THE

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
MINORITY LED BY THEIR LEADER HAS

226
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BEEN DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR A

227
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR

228
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
PREPLANNED FILIBUSTER.
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
COUPLE MONTHS, THEY'VE TROTTED

230
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
OUT ONE EXCUSE AFTER ANOTHER.

231
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
BUT NOTHING WILL STICK.

232
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
>> THAT LEAVES 30 HOURS OF

233
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DEBATE.
ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT JUDGE

234
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
GORSUCH WILL BE CONFIRMED BY

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
TOMORROW EVENING.

236
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> WHAT ARE DEMOCRATS SAYING

237
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
TODAY, MIKE?

238
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
>> THEY'RE FURIOUS WITH MITCH

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
McCONNELL.

240
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THEY'RE SAYING THAT McCONNELL

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
DIDN'T TREAT NEIL GORSUCH'S

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
PREDECESSOR, JUDGE MERRICK

243
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
GARLAND, THE LAST NOMINEE

244
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
NOMINATED TO THE HIGH COURT.

245
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
DEMOCRATS VENTED THEIR ANGER AT

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
MITCH McCONNELL.

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THEY WERE HELPLESS TO STOP THE

248
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
SO-CALLED NUCLEAR OPTION AND

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
BLASTED McCONNELL.

250
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
>> SO THE SENATOR FROM KENTUCKY

251
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
HAS MADE HISTORY.

252
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
HE COMES TO THE FLOOR AND TELLS

253
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
US HISTORY.

254
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
HE MADE HISTORY IN THE NUMBER OF

255
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
FILIBUSTERS THAT HE USED ON THIS

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
FLOOR.
HE MADE HISTORY AND DENYING A

257
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE THE

258
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING AND A

259
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
VOTE, WHICH HAD NEVER, NEVER

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
HAPPENED BEFORE IN THE HISTORY

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
OF THE UNITED STATES.

262
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
TALK ABOUT PARTISANSHIP.

263
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> SOURCES ON BOTH SIDES SUGGEST

264
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THERES PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO

265
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
AROUND.

266
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
WE'RE IN AN ERA OF PARTISANSHIP.

267
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> Shepard: NO DOUBT.

268
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
MIKE EMANUEL ON THE HILL.

269
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THANKS.

270
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
LET'S GO TO GREGORY McGARIAN

271
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
FROM ST. LOUIS.

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
LOVE IT THERE.

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
THE BACKGROUND ON THIS IS IT'S

274
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ALL POLITICS.
THE LEFT IS MAD AT THE RIGHT,

275
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE RIGHT IS MAD AT THE LEFT.

276
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, WHAT DOES

277
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
THIS MEAN GOING FORWARD?

278
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> WELL, IT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR

279
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
THE SENATE AND FOR THE SUPREME

280
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
COURT.

281
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
FOR THE SENATE, AS YOU SAID,

282
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THIS IS SORT OF A STAGE IN A

283
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
PROCESS RATHER THAN MAYBE A

284
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
SINGLE DEFINING MOMENT.

285
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THE SENATE HAS BEEN MOVING

286
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
TOWARD MORE PARTISAN DIVISION.

287
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I THINK, AS YOU SUGGESTED,

288
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
REFLECTING THE POLITICS OF THE

289
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
NATION AND THE GREATER

290
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
DIFFICULTY OF FORGING CONSENSUS

291
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
WITHIN THE DELIBERATIVE BODY.

292
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
FOR THE SUPREME COURT, THIS MAY

293
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
WELL MEAN THAT OVER TIME BOTH

294
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
PARTIES ARE -- HAVE A GREATER

295
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
INCENTIVE TO PROMOTE JUDGES AND

296
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
JUSTICES WHO ARE MORE SHARPLY

297
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
IDEALOGICAL AND LEFT CENTRISTS.

298
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
>> Shepard: BECAUSE THEY

299
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WOULDN'T NEED TO REACH OUT TO

300
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THE OTHER SIDE TO GET HELP TO

301
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
PUSH THOSE THROUGH.

302
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
SO IF AS MANY PEOPLE SUSPECT,

303
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ABLE TO

304
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
APPOINT ANOTHER SUPREME COURT

305
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
JUSTICE.
MIGHT TILT WILDLY RIGHT.

306
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
IF THE NEXT PRESIDENT, IF IT

307
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
TAKES UNTIL THE NEXT PRESIDENT,

308
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
HE OR SHE IS A DEMOCRAT, IT

309
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
MIGHT TILT WIDELY LEFT.

310
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
THAT INCREASES THE PARTISANSHIP

311
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
ALL OVER THE LAND.

312
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
>> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
ACTUALLY, OVER THE LONG-TERM.

314
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I THINK THERE'S A GOOD

315
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
POSSIBILITY THAT THIS WILL

316
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
BENEFIT -- I WOULDN'T SAY

317
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
BENEFIT DEMOCRATS SO MUCH AS

318
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
BENEFIT THE LEFT MORE THAN THE

319
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
RIGHT.

320
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
>> Shepard: WHY IS THAT?

321
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
>> OVER THE PAST COUPLE

322
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
GENERATIONS, CONSERVATIVES HAVE

323
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
BEEN MUCH MORE ANIMATED

324
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
POLITICALLY ABOUT THE SUPREME

325
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
COURT.
AS A RESULT, CONSERVATIVE

326
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES HAVE

327
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
GENERALLY BEEN MORE STRONG IN

328
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
THEIR IDEALOGICAL CONVICTIONS.

329
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THERE'S BEEN SOME EXCEPTIONS

330
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
GOING BACK TO JUSTICE KENNEDY.

331
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
IF YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE THOMAS,

332
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
JUSTICE SCALIA, CHIEF JUSTICE

333
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ROBERTS, VERY STRONGLY COMMITTED

334
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
CONSERVATIVES.
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, YOU HAD

335
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
MORE NOMINATIONS OF JUSTICE

336
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
BREYER, JUSTICE KAGAN THAT ARE

337
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
ON THE LEFT SIDE, CERTAINLY TO

338
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THE LEFT OF THE REPUBLICAN

339
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
APPOINTEE COLLEAGUES.

340
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
BUT NOT NEARLY AS FAR TO THE

341
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
LEFT AS WARREN COURT GENERATION,

342
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
THE LEADERS OF THAT COURT IN THE

343
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
60s THAT WERE SEEN AS LIBERAL

344
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ACTIVISTS.

345
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
SO IF THERE IS FROM THIS LOSS OF

346
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THE FILIBUSTER A SORT OF

347
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
LIBERATION OF IDEALOGICAL

348
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
NOMINEES, THAT LIBERATION WOULD

349
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
HAVE A STRONGER EFFECT ON THE

350
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAN THE

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
REPUBLICAN SIDE.

352
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
>> Shepard: WHAT EFFECT DOES

353
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THIS HAVE ON FUTURE CHANGES THAT

354
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
COULD ALLOW FOR A 51-VOTE ON

355
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
REGULAR LEGISLATION?

356
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

357
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE LEADERS TODAY SAY THAT WON'T

358
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
HAPPEN.
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF THAT, IS

359
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THERE?

360
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
>> NO.

361
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
IT'S TRADITION AND SORT OF

362
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
SELF-CONTROL OR FUNNY THINGS.

363
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE

364
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SENATE AND THE HOUSE THE POWER

365
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
TO SET THEIR OWN RULES.

366
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, THOSE

367
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
BODIES HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE

368
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THEIR RULES.

369
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
SO IN ONE SENSE, THIS COULD BE A

370
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
HICCUP.

371
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
IT COULD BE A PARTISAN MOMENT.

372
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
IN THE FUTURE OF THE SENATE

373
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
COULD FULLBACK FROM THIS BRINK.

374
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
MORE THAN WHAT THIS CAUSES IS

375
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
WHAT IT REPRESENTS.

376
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
IT REPRESENTS THE GREATER

377
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
DIFFICULTY OF FORGING BIPARTISAN

378
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
CONSENSUS AND THE SENATE IS

379
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
ADJUSTING TO THE REALITY AND

380
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
HAPPENS TO BE AT A MOMENT WHEN

381
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN CONTROL

382
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
AND TRYING TO GET DONE WHAT THEY

383
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
WANT DON'T.
>> Shepard: THIS HAS SEEN AS A

384
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
TRADITION BEFORE TODAY.
THE SENATE, THE ONES THAT STEP

385
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
UP AND KEEPS THE COUNTRY FROM

386
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
GOING TOO FAR ONE WAY OR TOO FOR

387
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
THE OTHER.

388
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
IS THERE REASONS FOR PEOPLE THAT

389
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
HOPE THAT THE CENTER HOLDS IN

390
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THIS NATION IS THERE REAL REASON

391
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
FOR THEM TO BE VERY CONCERNED

392
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
TODAY OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER

393
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS THAT THE

394
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
SYSTEM CAN OVERCOME?

395
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
>> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE A

396
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
MOMENT THE SYSTEM COULD

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
OVERCOME.
SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON

398
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
PERSONALITIES AND POLITICS IN

399
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THE SENATE.

400
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
ANYONE THAT IS STRONGLY IN

401
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
BIPARTISAN COOPERATION HAS HAD A

402
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
LOT OF REASONS TO BUN HAPPY OVER

403
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THE PAST DECADE OR MORE.

404
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I THINK TODAY IS A CONTINUATION

405
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
OF THAT.

406
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
>> GREGORY MAGARIAN FROM

407
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, I

408
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

409
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
THANK YOU.

410
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

411
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
>> Shepard: IF YOU WATCHED IN

412
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO, YOU

413
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SAW WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE

414
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
SHIFT IN UNITED STATES POLICY
TOWARDS SYRIA.

415
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN IN THE

416
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR.

417
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THE SYRIAN LEADER, BASHAR

418
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
AL-ASSAD, BY ALL INTERNATIONAL

419
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
OBSERVATION HAS MURDERED

420
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN

421
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
PEOPLE BY USING BARREL BOMBS AND

422
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
ALL KINDS OF EXPLOSIONS THE LAST

423
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
MANY YEARS.

424
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THERE WAS

425
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
VIDEO OF A CHEMICAL ATTACK, A

426
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
SARIN GAS ATTACK, ONE

427
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
PERPETRATED BY BASHAR AL-ASSAD

428
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
HIMSELF AND IT APPEARS THE

429
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS

430
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
CHANGED IN AN ENORMOUS WAY.

431
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT

432
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER AN

433
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO

434
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
RESPOND.
IS MILITARY ACTION, BOOTS ON THE

435
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
GROUND AHEAD FOR THE UNITED

436
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
STATES IN SYRIA?

437
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

438
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
THE RUSSIANS AND THE IRANIANS

439
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

440
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
IT'S BREAKING NEWS AND IT'S

441
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
NEXT.

442
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

443
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

444
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
OR ADEMPAS® FOR
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,

445
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

446
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IN EXCESS.

447
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

448
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

449
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS OF HEARING OR VISION,

450
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
OR AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
STOP TAKING CIALIS

451
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

452
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CIALIS.

453
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You totaNobody's hurt, new car.

454
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but there will still be pain.

455
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It comes when your insurance
company says they'll only pay

456
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
three-quarters of what
it takes to replace it.

457
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What are you supposed to do?

458
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Drive three-quarters of a car?

459
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Now if you had Liberty Mutual
New Car Replacement™,

460
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you'd get your whole car back.

461
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I guess they don't want you
driving around on three wheels.

462
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Smart.

463
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
With Liberty Mutual
New Car Replacement™,

464
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
we'll replace the full
value of your car.

465
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Liberty Stands With You™.

466
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Liberty Mutual Insurance.

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
>> Shepard: THERE'S BREAKING

468
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
NEWS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

469
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY

470
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TO BASHAR

471
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
AL-ASSAD HAS CHANGED.

472
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES, ANOTHER

473
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
SIGN.

474
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON

475
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
ANNOUNCING THAT "STEPS ARE

476
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
UNDERWAY TO ORGANIZE AN

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO

478
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN

479
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, FROM

480
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
POWER FOLLOWING THIS WEEK'S

481
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK IN THE

482
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
WAR-TORN COUNTRY."

483
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
REGIME CHANGE.

484
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THAT'S BRAND NEW.

485
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THIS REPRESENTS AN ENORMOUS

486
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
DEPARTURE FROM DAYS AGAINST WHEN

487
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE SYRIANS

488
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
SHOULD DECIDE.

489
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
THEN IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO

490
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
TRY TO REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD

491
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
FROM POWER AND THAT THE FOCUS

492
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SHOULD BE ON DEFEATING ISIS.

493
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
NOW WE LEARNED THAT SYRIA'S

494
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
FOREIGN MINISTER HAS DENIED THAT

495
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
HIS GOVERNMENT USED CHEMICAL

496
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
WEAPONS

497
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
WEAPONS IN  ATTACKS.

498
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
86 PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING DOZENS

499
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

500
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THEY SAID THE POISON GAS ATTACK

501
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
INJURED HUNDREDS MORE.

502
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
RUSSIA IS A KEY ALLY OF

503
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
AL-ASSAD.
THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH

504
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THE SYRIANS.

505
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
THE IRANIANS ARE IN THE MIX

506
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
SUPPORTING HEZBOLLAH.

507
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
A SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A REBEL

508
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
FACTORY.
SO THE RUSSIANS SAY IT HAPPENED

509
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
THE OTHER WAY.

510
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THE AMERICANS SAY IT HAPPENED

511
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
ANOTHER.

512
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THIS SIDE,

513
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
THE AMERICANS ARE ON THE OTHER.

514
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
IN THE SENDER IS BASHAR

515
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
AL-ASSAD.
THE RUSSIANS HAVE PROPPED HIM

516
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
UP.

517
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
THE RUSSIANS SAY THAT BASHAR

518
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
AL-ASSAD SHOULD STAY IN POWER.

519
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
THE RUSSIANS ARE SUPPORTING HIM.

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THE AMERICANS JUST SAID WE'RE

521
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
ORGANIZING A COALITION TO TAKE

522
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
HIM OUT.
THAT MEANS THE UNITED STATES

523
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
WITH SYRIAN REBELS AGAINST THE

524
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
SYRIANS, THE RUSSIANS AND THE

525
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
IRANIANS THAT SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.

526
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
SO FAR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MANY

527
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
OTHER WORLD LEADERS SAY THE

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS FLATLY TO

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
BLAME.
THE TRUTH IS, THE SYRIAN

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MURDERING

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
ITS OWN PEOPLE FOR YEARS.

532
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

533
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THESE PICTURES ARE NEW.

534
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
THIS INCIDENT IS NEW.

535
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THIS SITUATION IS VERY OLD.

536
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
THEY DROPPED BARREL BOMBS FROM

537
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THE SKY AND MURDERS CHILDREN IN

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THEIR BEDS ON A DAILY BASIS.

539
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
BUT THESE PICTURES AND THIS

540
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
INCIDENT IS NEW ALONG WITH THIS

541
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
PRESIDENT AND HIS ENTOURAGE.

542
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE

543
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
HORRIBLE IMAGES FROM THIS WEEK'S

544
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
ATTACK MADE HIM CHANGE HIS

545
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD.

546
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
>> IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

547
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
YOU SEE BABIES DEAD FROM GAS AND

548
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
A VERY HEINOUS FORM OF GAS,

549
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE

550
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
ACCESS, TO IT'S BAD STUFF.

551
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
REALLY BAD.

552
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

553
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
SAID THAT THE AL-ASSAD REGIME'S

554
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
ACTIONS CANNOT BE TOLERATED.

555
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
AND NOW VLADIMIR PUTIN IS

556
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
ACCUSING PRESIDENT TRUMP OF

557
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

558
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
THE RUSSIANS SAYING ONE THING

559
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
AND THE AMERICANS SAYING

560
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
ANOTHER.
THE AMERICANS ORGANIZING A

561
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
COALITION TO SETTLE IT ALL.

562
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
HERE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE

563
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
REX TILLERSON SAID 30 MINUTES

564
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
AGO.

565
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
>> OBVIOUSLY THE EVENTS THAT

566
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
HAVE OCCURRED IN SYRIA WITH THE

567
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK HERE IN

568
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
THE PAST DAY HAVE JUST I THINK

569
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
HORRIFIED ALL OF US AND BROUGHT

570
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
TO THE FRONT PAGES INTO OUR

571
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
TELEVISION SCREENS AS WELL.

572
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THE TRAGEDY THAT IS PART OF THE

573
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
SYRIAN CONFLICT.

574
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS

575
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
AND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE

576
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
SUPPORTS THAT SYRIA, THE SYRIAN

577
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
REGIME ON ORDERS OF PRESIDENT

578
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
BASHAR AL-ASSAD ARE RESPONSIBLE

579
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
FOR THIS ATTACK.

580
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
AND I THINK FURTHER IT IS VERY

581
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
IMPORTANT THAT THE RUSSIAN

582
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
GOVERNMENT CONSIDER CAREFULLY

583
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE

584
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
ASSAD REGIME.

585
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> Shepard: TODAY A SPOKESMAN

586
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
FOR THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SAID

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
WE WOULD WELCOME A MORE

588
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
CONSIDERED APPROACH.

589
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
IT IS A PERILOUS SET OF

590
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
CIRCUMSTANCES NOW.

591
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN

592
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD FOR A LONG

593
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
TIME.

594
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
AL-ASSAD HAS BEEN MURDERING HIS

595
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
OWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME.

596
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS HAVE

597
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
BEEN IN ON THAT EFFORT FOR A

598
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
LONG TIME AS THE UNITED STATES

599
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
SUPPORTS THE REBELS.

600
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
NOW THE QUESTION IS, DO WE

601
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
LAUNCH WITH A COALITION THAT HAS

602
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
BEEN SUGGESTED A MILITARY STRIKE

603
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
TO REMOVE THE MURDEROUS DICTATOR

604
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
FROM THAT COUNTRY?

605
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
IF SO, WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS?

606
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
WHO FILLS THE VOID THAT BASHAR

607
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
AL-ASSAD HAS HELD.

608
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
THOSE ARE THE VERY BIG QUESTIONS

609
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
THAT HAVE JUST ARISEN ON AN

610
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
ENORMOUS NEWS DAY.

611
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
RICH EDSON WITH ANALYSIS WITH

612
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A.B. STODDARD.

613
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
THAT'S NEXT ON A THURSDAY ON THE

614
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
Crohn's disease,...

615
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
...I was always searching for
ways to manage my symptoms.

616
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I thought I had it covered.

617
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Then I realized managing was
all I was doing.

618
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
When I finally told my doctor,

619
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
he said HUMIRA was for people
like me

620
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
who have tried other
medications,...

621
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but still experience the
symptoms

622
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
of moderate to severe
Crohn's disease.

623
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
In clinical studies,

624
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the majority of patients
on HUMIRA

625
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
saw significant symptom
relief...

626
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
...and many achieved remission.

627
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability to
fight infections...

628
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
...including tuberculosis.

629
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,...

630
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
including lymphoma, have
happened;

631
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
as have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems,

632
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
serious allergic
reactions,...

633
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
...and new or worsening heart
failure.

634
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Before treatment, get tested
for TB.

635
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Tell your doctor if you've been
to areas

636
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
where certain fungal infections
are common,

637
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and if you've had TB,...

638
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
...hepatitis B, are prone to
infections,

639
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
...or have flu-like symptoms
or sores.

640
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't start HUMIRA if you have
an infection.

641
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If you're still just managing
your symptoms,

642
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
ask your gastroenterologist
about HUMIRA.

643
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
With HUMIRA, remission
is possible.

644
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
>> WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT

645
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FOR THIS

646
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK WHICH

647
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
VIOLATES ALL PREVIOUS U.N.

648
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
RESOLUTIONS, VIOLATES

649
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND

650
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
LONG-HELD AGREEMENTS BETWEEN

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
PARTIES INCLUDING SYRIAN REGIME,

652
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND ALL

653
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE U.N.

654
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
SECURITY COUNCIL.

655
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
IT'S A SERIOUS MATTER.

656
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
IT REQUIRES A SERIOUS RESPONSE.

657
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
>> Shepard: GASSING YOUR OWN

658
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
PEOPLE IS A WAR CRIME.

659
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE SYRIAN

660
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, HAS

661
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
BEEN MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE

662
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FOR YEARS.

663
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
NOW 30 MINUTES AGO WE LEARNED

664
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARING

665
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
TO TAKE ACTION.

666
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
IT'S BREAKING NEWS AND RICH

667
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
EDSON IS ON IT AT THE STATE

668
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
DEPARTMENT.
RICH?

669
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
THAT STEPS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE

670
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
UNITED STATES TO LEAD AN

671
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO

672
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD FROM

673
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
POWER.

674
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
JUST A WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY

675
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
OF STATE ASKED ABOUT THIS IN

676
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
TURKEY.
HIS RESPONSE TO THAT WAS THAT IT

677
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
IS UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO

678
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
DECIDE THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF

679
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

680
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000

TURKEY.
THIS IS AS THE SECRETARY SAYS

687
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
THERE'S NO DOUBT THE REGIME OF

688
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000

THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT

694
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
RUSSIA NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT ITS

695
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
SUPPORT FOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND

696
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
THIS IS ONE WEEK AHEAD OF

697
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000

PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVEN AS A

LARGELY.
WE'VE HAD VERY BAD RESULTS.

730
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
THERE'S NO QUESTIONING THIS.

731
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000

00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
LONG TIME.

737
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW THERE WERE

738
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN THE PAST,

739
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
THAT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS

740
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
PRESIDENT HAD BEEN BUTCHERING

741
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
HIS OWN CIVILIANS TO THE TUNE OF

742
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
500,000 PEOPLE OVER SEVEN YEARS.

743
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
RE LENTLESSLY.

744
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
THIS IS A VERY BIG CHANGE OF

745
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
MIND AFTER THE ATTACK.

746
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
ALTHOUGH THE IMAGES ARE

747
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
GRUESOME, THE ATTACKS HAVE NOT

748
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
CHANGED.

749
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
SO THE QUESTION IS NOT THAT

750
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
THERE'S JUST A RUSSIAN ANGLE

751
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
HERE, THE RUSSIAN PART IS

752
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
EVERYTHING.

753
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
TILLERSON GOES TO MOSCOW TO TRY

754
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
TO KEEP AN AVENUE OPEN ON ISSUES

755
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
THAT WE CAN WORK ON WITH THE

756
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
RUSSIANS.
THEY ARE BACKING THIS BRUTAL

757
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
DICTATOR WHO IS MURDERING HIS

758
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
PEOPLE AND DON'T INTEND TO BACK

759
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
DOWN.

760
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THEY'RE MAKING EQUIVOCATING

761
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
COMMENTS TODAY THAT IF IT WASN'T

762
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
REALLY AN ATTACK, A ACCIDENTAL

763
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
ATTACK ON A WEAPONS FACTORY RUN

764
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
BY THE REBELS, THAT WOULD BE OUT

765
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
OF THE NORMS.

766
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
THEY THINK THE U.N. SHOULD DO AN

767
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
INVESTIGATION.
WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN BACKING

768
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
THIS REGIME, FIGHTING ITS OWN

769
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
PEOPLE, NOT ISIS.

770
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
SO AT THIS POINT, WHAT IS

771
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTING OF THE

772
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
RUSSIANS?

773
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
ARE WE GOING TO GO TO WAR

774
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
AGAINST THEM OR ARE WE GOING TO

775
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
TRY TO COAX THE RUSSIANS INTO

776
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
DEPOSING AL-ASSAD WITH US?

777
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
THAT IS EVERYTHING IN THIS

778
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
EQUATION.

779
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE

780
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
RUSSIANS.
WHAT DO THE ADMINISTRATION

781
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
THINKS THEY CAN GET THE RUSSIANS

782
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
TO DO?

783
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
>> WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT THE

784
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF

785
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THE WEST TO BACK OFF ON THEIR

786
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
ANNEXATION, THEIR INVASION AND

787
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
ANNEXING OF CRIMEA.

788
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT NATO'S

789
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
FRONT NOT TO BE SO CLOSE TO THE

790
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
RUSSIANS.
THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF DESIRES.

791
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
IT'S A MATTER OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE

792
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
WILLING TO GIVE.

793
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
>> IF WE GAVE THEM ALL OF THOSE

794
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
CONCESSIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE,

795
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
THEY WOULD -- PUTIN IS ENJOYING

796
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
A SUPREMACY THAT HE'S NEVER HAD

797
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
BEFORE.
HE RESCUED PRESIDENT OBAMA IN

798
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
2013 SO THAT HE COULD RETREAT

799
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
FROM HIS THREAT OF AIR STRIKES

800
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
WITH THIS DEAL HE NEGOTIATED TO

801
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
GET ALL THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS OUT

802
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
OF SYRIA.

803
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
THAT IS A HOAX.

804
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BACK

805
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
AWAY FROM HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH

806
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THE IRANIAN REGIME AND THE

807
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
SYRIAN REGIME.

808
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
HE'S PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE

809
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
ANT I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY

810
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN OVER

811
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
WHAT CONCESSIONS WE GIVE.

812
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
>> Shepard: WE'RE STILL IN THE

813
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
WORDS CATEGORY.

814
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THIS IS NOTHING BUT TALK AT

815
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
LEAST AT THIS MOMENT.

816
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE PLANS

817
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
ARE BEING DRAWN UP.

818
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN PENTAGON

819
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
GAME PLANS.

820
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
HEZBOLLAH IS IN THERE AND THE

821
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
IRANIANS SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.

822
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
WE HAVE UNITED STATES FORCES ON

823
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
THE GROUND.
HOWEVER QUIETLY.

824
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
THEY ARE THERE FIGHTING AGAINST

825
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
ISIS.
THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE GROUND

826
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD.

827
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
YOU HAVE THIS TOXIC MIX OF ALL

828
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
OF THOSE PEOPLE AND TO REMOVE

829
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THIS MAN FROM POWER, REGIME

830
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
CHANGE, SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH

831
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RAILED FOR

832
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
YEARS.

833
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
COULD REALLY UPSET THE

834
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT REGION AND

835
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
AROUND THE WORLD.
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT I RAN HERE,

836
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
HEZBOLLAH, RUSSIA, THE UNITED

837
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
STATES AND SYRIA, THAT IS ALMOST

838
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
A WORLD WAR DEFINED OR AT LEAST

839
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
YOU RISK THAT POSSIBILITY.

840
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
>> RIGHT.

841
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THAT'S THE THING.

842
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
IF HE WANTS TO DO SOME AIR

843
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
STRIKES ON THE WEAPONS ARSENALS,

844
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
THAT'S ONE THING.

845
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
OBVIOUSLY REGIME CHANGE IS A

846
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
HUGE OCCUPATION OF SYRIA AND A

847
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
MASSIVE GROUND WAR IN WHICH YOU

848
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
MENTIONED THERE'S SO MANY SIDES

849
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
AND PROXY FIGHTS GOING ON.

850
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
AGAIN, ARE WE GOING TO DO IT

851
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
WITH THE RUSSIANS OR NOT?

852
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

853
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
WE'LL LEARN MORE IN WEEKS TO

854
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
COME.
>> Shepard: WE NEED TO DISCUSS

855
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THIS FURTHER.
THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT

856
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED,

857
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES.

858
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
A.B. WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

859
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL

860
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
BREAK.
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, WE HAVE A

861
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
MINUTE OF OTHER HEADLINES.

862
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK TO THIS.

863
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
ORGANIZING A COALITION FOR

864
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
SYRIA.

865
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But with added touches you can't
get everywhere else,

866
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
like Claim Free Rewards...

867
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
or Safe Driving Bonus Checks.

868
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh Yes....

869
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Even a Claim Satisfaction

870
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Guaranteeeeeeeeeee!

871
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
IN means protection
plus unique extras

872

only from an expert
Allstate agent.

873
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY OUT

924
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
STRATEGIC AIR STRIKES.

925
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
IN 2015, THE RUSSIANS WENT IN

926
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
AND OWNED THE AIR BASES.

927
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THAT I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT

928
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
BASES AND MISSILE DEFENSE

929
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
SYSTEMS THERE.

930
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
THE IDEA THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD

931
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
ALLOW US TO STRIKE THE SIX AIR

932
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
STRIKES THAT EXIST SEEMS AT THIS

933
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
MOMENT IMPLAUSIBLE.

934
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
>> RIGHT.
THERE'S RUSSIANS EVERYWHERE

935
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
THERE.

936
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
SO THE POTENTIAL FOR AN

937
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
ACCIDENT, WHICH WE ALMOST HAD IN

938
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
2015 WITH OUR MORE LIMITED AIR

939
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
STRIKES WITH THE RUSSIANS AND

940
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
STARTING WORLD WAR III WITH THEM

941
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
IS VERY HIGH.

942
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
SO I DON'T KNOW -- IT'S

943
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
INTERESTING THAT TRUMP SAID

944
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
UNTIL YESTERDAY THAT HE DOESN'T

945
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
TELEGRAPH WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO

946
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
AND HE LIKES TO DO THINGS

947
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
SECRETLY.

948
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN

949
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO TAKE

950
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OUT AL-ASSAD WITH ALL OF THESE

951
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
TERRIBLE OPTIONS.

952
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO

953
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SEE WHAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING,

954
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE WILLING

955
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
TO PUT GROUND FORCES ON.

956
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WE HAVE 900 SPECIAL FORCE

957
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
THERE'S ALREADY IN HARM'S WAY.

958
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
THE CONGRESS AT SOME POINT,

959
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
SHEP, IS GOING TO HAVE TO

960
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
WEIGH-IN ON THIS.

961
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THEY BACKED AWAY WHEN OBAMA

962
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
WANTED TO RENEW THE 2001

963
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF

964
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
MILITARY FORCE A FEW YEARS AGO.

965
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
THEY ABDICATED THE

966
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
RESPONSIBILITY.
I WAS CRITICAL AT THE TIME THEY

967
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
DID THAT.
THE PRESSURE WILL BE ON THEM TO

968
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
WEIGH-IN ON THIS.

969
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER POLITICAL

970
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
DEBATE AND WHOLE OTHER HURDLE.

971
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
>> Shepard: INTERESTING YOU SAY

972
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THAT BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP

973
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
SAID THE SAME THING BACK

974
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
REGARDING THIS MATTER EARLIER.

975
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
LOOK AT THE TWEET THAT PRESIDENT

976
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
TRUMP SENT BACK, BEFORE HE WAS

977
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
THIS WAS FROM 2013.

978
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
"WHAT WILL WE GET FOR BOMBING

979
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
SYRIA BESIDES MORE DEBT AND A

980
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
POSSIBLE LONG-TERM CONFLICT?

981
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL

982
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
APPROVAL ON THAT SAME LINE."

983
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
TODAY SENATOR RAND PAUL FROM

984
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
KENTUCKY SAID IF WE WANT TO

985
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
CARRY OUT STRIKES IN SYRIA,

986
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THERE SHOULD BE CONGRESSIONAL

987
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
APPROVAL.
THE CHANCES OF CONGRESS WEIGHING

988
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
IN ON THIS, A.B.?

989
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
>> THEY DON'T WANT TO.

990
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

991
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
THEY'LL BE FORCED.

992
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
AND IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT

993
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
THIS WAS A SARIN ATTACK, IT

994
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE

995
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
PUBLIC BEFORE THERE'S ANY

996
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
MILITARY INTERVENTION.

997
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
CONGRESS WILL BE ASKING AS THEY

998
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN 435

999
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AND THE
HOUSE, THEY'LL BE ASKING FOR

1000
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
HARD EVIDENCE TO LAY OUT THE

1001
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
CASE IF THEY ARE TO SUPPORT MORE

1002
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
AGGRESSIVE AIR STRIKES, LET

1003
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
ALONE GROUND OPERATIONS THE

1004
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
TOPPLE THE REGIME, THIS SOUNDS

1005
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
LIKE A LONG BATTLE.

1006
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ALTHOUGH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THEY'RE

1007
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
WORKING ON SOME PLAN TO DO

1008
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
SOMETHING EXTREMELY BOLD, AS A

1009
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
FEW DAYS AGO, THEY HAD NO PLAN

1010
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
IN PLACE AND NO INTENTIONS LIKE

1011
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THIS.
SO I THINK THEY'RE FLYING A BIT

1012
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
BY THE SEAT OF THEIR PANTS.

1013
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
NOBODY IN CONGRESS KNOW WHAT'S

1014
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1015
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
AGAIN THAT MEETING IN RUSSIA

1016
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
SAYS IT WILL BE SO PIVOTAL.

1017
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES GO IT

1018
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
ALONE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS

1019
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SUPPORTING ASSAD'S REGIME?

1020
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE.
>> Shepard: A.B. STODDARD WITH

1021
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
THE BREAKING NEWS.

1022
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

1023
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
>> THANK YOU.
>> Shepard: I JUST LEARNED THAT

1024
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SPOKEN ABOUT

1025
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
SYRIA AS HE HEADED ON AIR FORCE

1026
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
ONE DOWN TO FLOOR.

1027
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
JOHN ROBERTS IS ALREADY IN PALM

1028
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
BEACH.

1029
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
WHAT DID HE SAY, JOHN?

1030
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
>> GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.

1031
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK TO THE

1032
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
PRESS CABIN IN THE REAR RIGHT

1033
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
SIDE OF AIR FORCE ONE TO TALK

1034
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

1035
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THINGS.
HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE

1036
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
SUMMIT HE'S HAVING WITH

1037
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
XI JINPING, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO

1038
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
BE THE THEME OF THIS NEXT 24

1039
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
HOURS.

1040
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT IS GOING ON

1041
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
WITH SYRIA AND THE POTENTIAL

1042
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
THERE IS OVERSHADOWING THAT.

1043
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
A ROUTINE LEADER SUMMIT BETWEEN

1044
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS

1045
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE ALL

1046
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
TOGETHER.
THE PRESIDENT TALKING TO THE

1047
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
PRESS ABOUT SYRIA.

1048
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
HE WAS ASKING WHETHER BASHAR

1049
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
AL-ASSAD SHOULD GO.

1050
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
THIS IS ON CAMERA.

1051
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE.

1052
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
SO I'LL READ THE TRANSCRIPT.

1053
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT ASSAD

1054
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
DID IS TERRIBLE.

1055
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS ONE OF

1056
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THE TRULY EGREGIOUS CRIMES.

1057
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
AND WHEN ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT

1058
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WAS GOING TO TAKE TO PRESIDENT

1059
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
PUTIN, HE SAID I MAY.

1060
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
THERE WILL BE A RANGE OF OPTIONS

1061
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT ON

1062
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
HOW HE COULD RESPOND MILITARY.

1063
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DISCUSSING

1064
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S

1065
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
GOING TO HAPPEN.

1066
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
IF AN AIR STRIKE OR SOMETHING

1067
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
LIKE THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT

1068
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WOULD BE A TEST OF HOW GOOD A

1069
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT COULD

1070
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
HAVE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

1071
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
RUSSIA.
WHEN ASKED IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD

1072
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
SHOULD LEAVE POWER, HE SAID IT'S

1073
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

1074
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
HE'S THERE AND HE'S RUNNING

1075
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
THINGS BUT SOMETHING SHOULD

1076
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
HAPPEN.

1077
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
REX TILLERSON IN THE CAMP OF

1078
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
YES, HE NEEDS TO GO.

1079
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
THE UNITED STATES TRYING TO GET

1080
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
A COALITION FOR A POLITICAL

1081
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
FRAME WORK FOR THAT TO HAPPEN

1082
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD.

1083
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA

1084
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING AT

1085
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
WHICH CAME TO NOTHING.

1086
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
>> Shepard: IT DEED.

1087
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED

1088
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
TO STOP IT.
THE WORLD WANTS TO STOP IT.

1089
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY IS

1090
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE

1091
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THE

1092
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING

1093
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
BECAUSE ALL OF THE OPTIONS ARE

1094
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
BAD OPTIONS.
THAT WAS THE DECISION OF

1095
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1096
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
HE DIDN'T ACT.

1097
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
NOW THIS PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED

1098
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
TO ACT.

1099
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
HE'S TRYING TO FORM A COALITION.

1100
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

1101
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
OVERTHROW BASHAR AL-ASSAD?
WHO HOLDS THE LAND THEN?

1102
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
WHO IS IN CHARGE?

1103
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
HOW DO YOU COME TO SOME

1107
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
WOULD THE RUSSIANS ALLOW A NO

FLY ZONE?

1109
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
IT'S THE RUSSIAN'S AIRSPACE.

1110
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000

WHO SAID WHY WOULD I STEP DOWN?

1127
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
HE JUST STEPPED DOWN.

1128
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000

If their Alzheimer's
is getting worse,

1170
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
ask about once-a-day NAMZARIC.

1171
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
NAMZARIC is approved for

moderate to severe
Alzheimer's disease

1173
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
in patients who are
taking donepezil.

1174
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
It may improve cognition
and overall function,

1175
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
and may slow the worsening
of symptoms for a while.

1176

NAMZARIC does not change

1177
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000

disease progression.

1180
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
or any of the ingredients
in NAMZARIC.

1181
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Tell the doctor

1182
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000

kidney or liver problems,

1183

1185
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000

nausea, vomiting,
difficulty urinating,

00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
VERY TOUGH WAY THROUGHOUT THE

MANY, MANY YEARS BY CHINA.

ON ONE HAND YOU HAVE SYRIA, ON

1252
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
KOREA THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THESE

1253

CHINA ON THAT FRONT.

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
IT'S CHINA THAT HAS THE SWAY

1257
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
OVER NORTH KOREA.

1258
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
IT'S CHINA THAT ALLOWS FOR

1259
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
REALLY 90% OF EVERYTHING THAT

1260
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

1261
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000

PLAN TO USE AS LEVERAGE?

1265
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

1266
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
THERE'S SOME QUESTION MARKS

1267
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
THERE.
WHAT IS CLEAR THAT THE

1268
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000

00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
TRYING TO EXERT SOME PRESSURE ON

1270
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
CHINA TO TAKE A TOUGHER LINE ON

1271
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
NORTH KOREA.

1272
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000

1274
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
WEEK AHEAD OF THE MEETING.

1275
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT BEHIND

CLOSED DOORS YOU'LL SEE

1277
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000

1282
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
THIS MEETING WILL BE LESS ABOUT

1283
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
TRADE AND MORE ABOUT NORTH

1284
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
KOREA.
>> Shepard: AS WE TALK ABOUT

1285
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
NORTH KOREA, THERE'S A FEAR THAT

1286
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
NORTH KOREA WOULD TAKE ANOTHER

1287
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
AGGRESSIVE ACTION JUST AS IT DID

1288
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

1289
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I THINK THOSE THAT WATCH NORTH

1290
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
KOREA CLOSELY ARE CONCERNED THAT

1291
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
A MISTAKE ON THE PART OF THE

1292
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
NORTH KOREANS COULD START A

1293
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
SERIES OF EVENTS THAT COULD LEAD

1294
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
ANOTHER WAR AND UPSET THE ENTIRE

1295
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
WORLD.
I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT IS PART

1296
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
OF THIS DISCUSSION.

1297
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1298
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
LOOK, HOVERING OVER THIS ARE

1299
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
THESE QUESTIONS THAT WE DON'T

1300
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
HAVE ANSWERS TO, REALLY WHAT IS

1301
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
DONALD TRUMP'S RED LINE.

1302
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
WHERE IS THE POINT THAT HE WOULD

1303
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
BE INTERESTED IN MILITARY ACTION

1304
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
OF SOME KIND.

1305
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT

1306
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
AND WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER ON

1307
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
THAT YET ON NORTH KOREA EITHER.

1308
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
BUT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF

1309
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
THINGS THAT ARE REALLY TURNING

1310
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
INTO MAJOR HEADLINES AND THE

1311
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
FOCAL POINT OF THIS WEEKEND AS

1312
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
HE DEALS WITH THESE TWIN CRISES.

1313
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
>> Shepard: THE USE OF GOING IT

1314
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
ALONE AGAINST NORTH KOREA IS NOT

1315
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
OFF THE TABLE.

1316
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
ALEX, THANK YOU.

1317
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
>> THANK YOU.

1318
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
>> Shepard: AS THE NEWS

1319
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
CONTINUES TO BREAK ON A VERY

1320
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
BUSY THURSDAY, THE CHAIRMAN OF

1321
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
SAYS HE'S REMOVING HIMSELF FROM

1322
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AFTER

1323
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE

1324
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS THAT HE

1325
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
VIEWED AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1326
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
NOW HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION.

1327
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
THAT'S NEXT.

1328
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So much lobster, so little time.

1329
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
At Red Lobster's Lobsterfest

1330
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
any of these 9 lobster dishes
could be yours.

1331
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So don't resist delicious new
Lobster Mix and Match

1332
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
or Lobsterfest Surf and Turf

1333
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
because you won't have this
chance for long.

1334
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
>> Shepard: AFTER SAYING TO

1335
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
REPORTERS FOR WEEKS, WHY WOULD I

1336
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
STEP DOWN?

1337
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

1338
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES IS STEPPING

1339
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
DOWN FROM HIS PANEL'S

1340
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA'S

1341
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
MEDDLING IN THE 2016 CAMPAIGN

1342
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
ELECTION.
A TEMPORARY MOVE, HE SAYS.

1343
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
ALSO NEW, THE HOUSE ETHICS

1344
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
COMMITTEE IS INVESTIGATING

1345
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
WHETHER NUNES MISHANDLED

1346
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
HIS RESPONSE, SOUTHWEST

1347
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
LEFT-WING ACTIVISTS GROUPS HAVE

1348
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
FILED ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME

1349
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
WITH THE OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL

1350
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
ETHICS.

1351
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
THE CHARGES ARE POLITICALLY

1352
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
MOTIVATED AND LEVELLED JUST AS

1353
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE STARTING

1354
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
TO LEARN ABOUT UNMASKING OF

1355
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
CITIZENS AND ABUSE OF POWER.

1356
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE

1357
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
QUESTIONED WHETHER CONGRESSMAN

1358
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
NUNES COULD BE AT FAULT.

1359
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
SOME SAY HE'S A SHIELD FOR THE

1360
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
WHITE HOUSE.

1361
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
NUNES SHARED INFORMATION WITH

1362
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
THE PRESIDENT BEFORE HIS

1363
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
COMMITTEE.

1364
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
WAS HE GIVING THE PRESIDENT

1365
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
COVER?
CONGRESSMAN NUNES, THE WHITE

1366
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
HOUSE AND THEIR SUPPORTERS HAVE

1367
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
BEEN TRYING TO CHANGE THE

1368
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
NARRATIVE.

1369
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
OPPONENTS SAY THEY'RE TRYING TO

1370
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
DISTRACT FROM THE INVESTIGATION

1371
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
INTO WHETHER MEMBERS OF TEAM

1372
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
TRUMP WORKED WITH THE RUSSIANS

1373
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
TO TAKE DOWNHILL HILL AND GET

1374
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
THEM CANDIDATE TRUMP ELECTED.

1375
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
PETER DOOCY WITH THIS BACK AND

1376
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
FORTH.

1377
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
PETER?
>> SHEP, CONGRESSMAN NUNES HAS

1378
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
SENT A LAWYER TO THE HOUSE

1379
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
ETHICS COMMITTEE.

1380
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT EVIDENCE

1381
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
YOU HAVE ON THEM THAT SOMEBODY

1382
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
UNKNOWN, HE SAYS, A LEFT-LEANING

1383
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
OUTSIDE GROUP SUBMITTED THAT LED

1384
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
TO THIS INVESTIGATION.

1385
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
I SPOKE TO TEXAS CONGRESSMAN

1386
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
MIKE CONWAY, THE REPUBLICAN FROM

1387
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
THE COMMITTEE, WHO WILL TAKE

1388
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
OVER THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

1389
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
HE SAID HE GOT A CALL FROM NUNES

1390
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
LAST NIGHT ASKING HIM TO TAKE

1391
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
OVER, SO HE'S GOING TO DO IT.

1392
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
HE STILL HAS NOT SEEN THE

1393
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
DOCUMENTS THAT NUNES SAW ON THE

1394
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS THAT ALLEGED

1395
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

1396
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
IMPROPERLY UNMASKED THE IDENTITY

1397
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
OF TRUMP TRANSITION OFFICIALS IN

1398
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
U.S. INTELLIGENCE REPORTS.

1399
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
HE COULDN'T CONFIRM OR DENY

1400
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
WHETHER SUSAN RICE, THE OBAMA

1401
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL WHO IS

1402
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED WITH SOME OF

1403
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
THAT UNMASKING, IS GOING TO COME

1404
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
AND TESTIFY.
THE REASON HE WOULDN'T CONFIRM

1405
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
OR DENY AN INVITATION FOR THE

1406
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR IN THE

1407
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS BECAUSE

1408
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
HE SAYS HE DOESN'T WANT TO

1409
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
CONDUCT COMMITTEE BUSINESS IN

1410
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
THE PRESS.

1411
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
SHEP?

1412
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, PETER.

1413
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
BUSY NEWS DAY?

1414
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
LIKE FEW OTHERS.

1415
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
THE UNITED STATES PUTTING

1416
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
TOGETHER A COALITION FOR REGIME

1417
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
CHANGE IN SYRIA.

1418
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
NEIL CAVUTO PICKS UP AFTER THIS.

1419
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

1420
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
FORGET GOING NUCLEAR.

1421
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Z AND/OR TAX REFORM.

1422
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
YOU GET AN IDEA THAT NOT

1423
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE?

1424
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
MAYBE EVEN WITHIN THE WHITE

1425
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
HOUSE ITSELF?

1426
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'M CONFUSED.

1427
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S
