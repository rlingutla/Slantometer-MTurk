119
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:54,873
ON THE MAINLAND THAT IS NOT     
HAPPENING HERE.                 

120
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,443
PEOPLE WERE ON THE ISLAND BEFORE
THE HURRICANE, BEFORE, DURING   

121
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:03,315
AND AFTER MARIA.                
SO WE'VE BEEN HIT BY A HURRICANE

122
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,853
CAT 5 IN LESS THAN TEN DAYS, ONE
AFTER THE OTHER.                

123
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:12,090
SO IT'S NOT BY THE NAVY AND THE 
COAST GUARD.                    

124
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:17,863
THEY ARE RESCUING MORE THAN 800 
PEOPLE AND STILL ONGOING IN     

125
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:27,405
RESCUE MISSIONS.                
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,  

126
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,578
THE PUERTO RICAN HAS WORKED WITH
THE GOVERNOR, TO DEAL WITH THIS 

127
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,613
ISSUE.                          
WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE.           

128
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,115
WE'RE USED TO HAVING A HURRICANE
BUT NEVER LIKE THIS ONE.        

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,484
THIS IS A MAJOR ONE.            
DEVASTATION.                    

130
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:48,260
THANKS FOR ALL OF THE HELP AND  
ALL THE RESOURCES.              

131
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,430
ALL FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ON THE 
ISLAND BECAUSE OF YOU.          

132
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:59,504
>> THANK YOU.                   
>> THE POWER GRID WAS DEVASTATED

133
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,340
BEFORE THE HURRICANES EVEN HIT. 
THEN THE HURRICANES HIT.        

134
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,243
THEY WIPED THEM OUT.            
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF          

135
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,811
GENERATORS THAT HAVE BEEN       
BROUGHT TO THE ISLAND.          

136
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,983
MOST OF THE HOSPITALS ARE OPEN. 
AT LEAST PARTIALLY OPEN.        

137
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:16,988
MOST OF THEM NOW ARE OPEN.      
AGAIN, THE JOB DONE HERE IS     

138
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,925
NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.     
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE.           

139
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,930

STUFF FOR US.

WE AS THE MAYOR -- THIS IS A    
TEAM.                           

146
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,987
THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE AND THE   
HELPING OF THOUSANDS AND        

147
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,689
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.            
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.       

148
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,490
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,         
EVERYBODY.                      

149
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:58,096
>> WHAT DID YOU MEAN EARLIER    
THAT THEY COULD DO MORE?        

150
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,300
>> Shepard: NOW THE PRESIDENT   
WILL WALK IN THE BUILDING AND   

151
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,971
BEGIN THIS EFFORT OF            
DISTRIBUTING SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE 

152
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:23,888
WHO WERE THERE.                 
SO LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.        

153
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:41,239
[APPLAUSE]                      

154
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:59,718
[APPLAUSE]                      
>> THANK YOU.                   

155
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:17,068
THANK YOU.                      

156
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,790
>> Shepard: THERE YOU HAVE IT.  
LOTS OF PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THE    

157
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,759
PRESIDENT.                      
SOME WELL-WISHES, SOME CHEERS   

158
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,763
AND APPLAUSE AND SOME SUPPLIES  
TO BE HANDED OUT THERE.         

159
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,699
OF COURSE, THE REAL PROBLEM IN  
PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN WITH       

160
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,701
DISTRIBUTION.                   
SO MANY OF THE DRIVERS OF THE   

161
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,639
TRUCKS THAT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE 
THE PRODUCTS, THAT ARE NECESSARY

162
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,276
FOR SURVIVAL AROUND THE ISLAND, 
THOSE DRIVERS HAVE LOST IN MANY 

163
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,979
CASES THEIR HOMES OR THEIR      
ABILITY TO GET WHEREVER THEY    

164
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,614
NEED TO GO TO DRIVE THE         
VEHICLES.                       

165
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:13,618
SO THEY'RE HAVING A LOT OF      
PROBLEMS WITH DISTRIBUTION.     

166
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:18,156
HURTING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SMALL
TOWNS AND OUTSIDE OF SAN JUAN.  

167
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,259
TO HEAR IT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,
THEY'RE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY 

168
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,797
CAN TO GET THE DISTRIBUTION     
CHANNELS IN LINE SO THAT NO ONE 

169
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:30,702
ELSE LOSES THEIR LIVES IN THE   
HORROR THAT HAS BEEN PUERTO     

170

00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,788

00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,563
THEY'RE BEING TOLD NO.          
WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT EVERY CAR 

217
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,665
HAS TO MATCH UP TO A CERTAIN    
PERSON.                         

218
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,702

CARS WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY   

219
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,838
THEIR OWNERS.                   
THE FBI IS ON SCENE.            

220
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,807
THEY'RE MAPPING CARS OVER HERE. 
THERE'S A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.     

221
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:41,746
SOME OF THESE CARS TRIED TO GET 
OUT WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED   

222
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,419
AND RAN INTO A DEAD END.        
THE GREEN JEEP HAS BLOOD-STAINED

223
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:52,623
HAND PRINTS ON THE HOOD.

HERE.                           
THIS DOESN'T GIVE US MOTIVE BUT 

226
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,600
GIVES US AN IDEA HOW THE        
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO MAP

236
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,601
DIED IN A TERROR ATTACK IN THE  
FRENCH CAPITOL.                 

237
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,338
LAST NIGHT, THE ORIGINAL

LAS VEGAS HAS BEEN ON THE       

294
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:14,251
SHOOTER FOLLOWING THE MASSACRE. 
BUT STORIES AFTER HEROISM       

295
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,555
CONTINUE TO EMERGE.             
FOR INSTANCE, 30-YEAR-OLD COPY  

296
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,558
MACHINE REPAIR MAN JONATHAN     
SMITH.                          

297
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,495
ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON    
POST," THE FATHER OF THREE WAS  

298
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,331
SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY BUT   
STAYED BEHIND TO DIRECT DOZENS  

299
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,569
OF PEOPLE TO SAFETY.            
A BULLET STRUCK HIM IN THE NECK 

300
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:35,206
LEAVING HIM WITH A CRACKED RIB  
AND BRUISED LINK.               

301
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:41,111
THEN THERE'S 29-YEAR-OLD MARINE 
VETERAN TAYLOR WINSTON WHO SAID 

302
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,314
HE STOLE A TRUCK TO DRIVE PEOPLE
TO THE HOSPITAL.                

303
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:48,252
HE TRANSPORTED BETWEEN 20 AND 30
PEOPLE AND LATER RETURNED THE   

304
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:53,657
KEYS TO THE TRUCK'S OWNER AND   
THEN THERE'S TRAVIS PHIPPEN AN  

305
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,693
EMT.                            
HE STAYED BEHIND TO REVIVE HIS  

306
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,396
FATHER THAT WAS SHOT.           
ONE OF THE GUNMAN'S BULLETS HIT 

307
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,298
TRAVIS WHO IS EXPECTED TO       
SURVIVE.                        

308
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:05,035
HIS FATHER DID NOT MAKE IT OUT  
ALIVE.                          

309
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,138
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WENT TO      
HOSPITALS AFTER THE SHOOTING AND

310
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:13,110
SOME DOCTORS HAVE SAID IT WAS   
VERY TOUGH TO KEEP UP AS THE    

311

STILL LISTED AS CRITICAL?       

314
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,357
>> WELL, THERE'S TWO HOSPITALS  
WITH CRITICAL PATIENTS NOW.     

315
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,160
OVER AT SUNRISE MEDICAL, THEY   
HAVE 33 IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

CENTER, 20 REMAIN AT THIS POINT

00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,235

I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE SURGEONS  

318
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,170
WHO HAS BEEN WORKING DAY AND    
NIGHT HERE.                     

319
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:45,276
HE SAID MANY OF THE GUNSHOT     
WOUNDS WERE SO HORRIFIC, A LOT  

320
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,080
OF THE STAFF WILL LIKELY NEED   
PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.             

321
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:55,019
LISTEN HERE.                    
>> THERE WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY   

322
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:59,189
AND LOSS OF FOCUS.              
THAT CAN BE EASILY CORRECTED.   

323
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,893
THE UNCONSCIOUS FORMS OF STRESS 
ARE THINGS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE IN

324
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,263
THE SECOND AND THIRD DAY.       
WE HAVE DEBRIEFING TEAMS        

325
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:12,736
OFFERING SERVICE TO THE STAFF.  
>> A REMINDER, SHEP, AS WELL AS 

326
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:18,776
SO MANY PHYSICAL SCARS, THERE   
WILL BE MANY MENTAL SCARS THAT  

327
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,314
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL.  
>> TELL US HOW THE MURDERER     

328
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,350
MODIFIED THE WEAPONS TO SHOOT   
MORE BULLETS QUICKLY.           

329
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:32,790
>> YEAH,  WE TALKED TO AN ATF   
SERVICE THAT SAID SOME OF THE   

330
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:37,494
WEAPONS WERE MODIFIED AS WHAT IS
CALLED A SLIDE-FIRE MECHANISM.  

331
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:40,464
THE INFORMATION APPARENTLY AND  
THE COMPONENTS TO DO THAT EASILY

332
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,701
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.      
THIS VIDEO IS FROM ONE SUCH

00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,737
SITE.                           
WE DON'T KNOW THAT MR. PADDOCK  

334
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,973
USED THIS PARTICULAR SITE, OF   
COURSE, BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF  

335
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,243
WHAT IS OUT THERE.              
WHAT IT DOES, ACCORDING TO OUR  

336
00:26:53,378 --> 00:27:00,317
SOURCE, IS CHANGED THE SHOULDER 
REST AND EFFECTIVELY MAKE THE

TRIGGER MIMIC FULLY AUTOMATIC   
OPERATION.                      

338
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,958
OUR SOURCE SAYS THAT IT         
BASICALLY TURNS A SEMIAUTOMATIC 

339
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:13,464
RIFLE INTO A MACHINE GUN AND    
REMEMBER, PADDOCK WAS ARMED WITH

340
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:17,134
MORE THAN ONE MACHINE GUN.      
THAT'S THE KIND OF FIREPOWER    

341
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:24,174
THAT RAINED DOWN ON THOSE       
INNOCENT CONCERT GOERS.         

342
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,345
>> THANKS, JONATHAN.            
FIRST A LOOK AT MORE OF THE
