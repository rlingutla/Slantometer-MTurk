FIRE.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
AS CREWS FIGHT TO PROTECT THE

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
ANCIENT SEQUOIAS.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
THE HOMES ON THE PARK'S EDGE.

THE FIERCE WINDS NOW FUELING THE
FIRE, BURNING IN YOSEMITE

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
NATIONAL PARK.

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
WINDS EXPECTED THROUGH THE

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
EVENING AND TONIGHT, NOT ONLY

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
ARE FIRE CREWS TRYING TO KEEP
THE FLAMES FROM REACHING

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
THOUSANDS OF HOMES, THEY ARE

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
BATTING TO PROTECT THOSE FAMOUS

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
GIANT SEQUOIAS, THE ANCIENT

48

TREASURES OF THE PARK.

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THE FIRE HAS NOT REACHED THEM

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
YET, BUT SO MANY OTHER TREES THE
FIRE HAS REACHED.

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
133,000 ACRES, A HUGE PART OF

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THE PARK, ALREADY CHARRED.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
JUST LISTEN TO IT TONIGHT.

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THE SOUND OF THE BONE DRY TIMBER

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
GOING UP IN FLAMES.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
AND OUR TEAM, VISITING THAT

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
CRUCIAL RESERVOIR IN THE PARK,

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
WHERE SAN FRANCISCO GETS ITS
WATER SUPPLY.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
CONTRIBUTING TO THAT STATE OF

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
EMERGENCY NOW IN CALIFORNIA.

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000

INSIDE YOSEMITE IS HOT AND

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
INTENSE.

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
CREWS AREN'T JUST TRYING TO STOP

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THE FIRE -- THEY'RE TRYING TO

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
PROTECT A GROVE OF THE PARK'S

72
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
FAMED SEQUOIAS -- THREE DOZEN IN

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
ALL.
THE HUGE TREES ARE AMONG THE

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
OLDEST LIVING THINGS ON EARTH,

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
AND TEAMS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED
JUST TO THEM.

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
>> I'M FROM VIRGINIA, SO THE

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
FUEL TYPES HERE ARE DIFFERENT.

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY DRY, SO,

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THIS IS SOME PRETTY EXTREME FIRE

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE ENCOUNTERING

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
HERE.

AREA AROUND THE MASSIVE

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
HETCH HETCHY RESERVOIR.

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
WE SAW FIRST HAND, THE FIRE IS

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
CLOSE TO THE AREA THAT SUPPLIES

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
85% OF SAN FRANCISCO'S WATER.

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
CAUSE ENOUGH FOR THE GOVERNOR TO

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
PUT PUBLIC UTILITY CREWS ON

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
ALERT TO MONITOR THE WATER'S

93
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
QUALITY.

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
>> IT'S STILL ACTIVELY BURNING
AS WE SPEAK.

95
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
IT HAS AFFECTED OUR WATER AND

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
POWER SYSTEM.

97
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> Reporter: ON THE ROAD OUTSIDE

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THE PARK, CREWS ARE CUTTING DOWN

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
BURNED TREES THEY CALL "WIDOW

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
MAKERS," BECAUSE THEY FALL

101
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WITHOUT WARNING.

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
FURTHER TO THE NORTH, THE NOW

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
FAMILIAR SIGHT -- MORE FAMILIES
DISPLACED, EVACUATING AS THE

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
FIRE BURNS THEIR WAY.

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> 15 MINUTES TO BE OUT OF OUR

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
HOUSE.

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
SO WE ONLY GOT OUR KIDS, OUR

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ANIMALS AND A LITTLE BIT OF
PICTURES.

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
IT WAS HARD.
>> Reporter: ELSEWHERE, AIR

110
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
CHOKED WITH THICK SMOKE AND ASH

111
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
IS THE PROBLEM.
YOU CAN FEEL IT.

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
IT'S PRETTY BAD.

114
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'M ALL CONGESTED.

115
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
YOU GET THE SINUS INFECTION AND

116
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ALL THAT STUFF.

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT
FIREFIGHTERS ARE WORKING SO HARD

118
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
TO PROTECT.
THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN INSIDE

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
YOSEMITE ON SATURDAY BY TOURISTS

120
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
HERE FROM THE UK, AMAZED THAT

121
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
THE FIRE IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

122
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
INSIDE -- FOR NOW.

123
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WE'RE HERED A THE SIDE OF

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
OFF AND IS NOW BEING PROTECTED

126
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
BY FIREFIGHTERS.

127
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THIS FIRE REMAINS VERY INTENSE,

128
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
ONLY ABOUT 7% CONTAINED.

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
IT'S BURNING HOT, THEY'RE HAVING
A VERY HARD TIME GETTING AHOLD

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OF THIS ONE, DAVID.

131
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
>> ALL RIGHT, NEAL KARLINSKY
LEADING US OFF.

132
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
NEAL, OUR THANKS TO YOU.
I WANT TO BRING IN ABC

133
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE.

134
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
AND AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING HERE,

135
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THE MAJOR THREAT TONIGHT, THE

136
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WINDS.

137
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
>> RIGHT.
AND THAT IS GOING TO SUBSIDE

138
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
ONLY A LITTLE AS WE GET INTO THE

139
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
START OF THE WORK WEEK.

140
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU, DAVID,

141
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THE REAL PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THE HEAT AND, OF COURSE, THE DRY

143
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
CONDITIONS.

144
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HOTTER AND

145
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
DRIER AS WE START THIS WEEK IN

146
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT PART OF CALIFORNIA.

147
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
>> ALSO, THE FLOODING AND THE

148
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
HEAT YOU'RE WATCHING AS WE TURN

149
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
TO ANOTHER WEEK.
>> RIGHT.

150
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
HUGE HEADLINES COMING OUT.

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
AND WE'VE GOT FLASH FLOODING

152
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN

153
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THE SOUTHWEST.

154
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
YOU CAN SEE, SOME PICTURES,

155
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
FRESH IN FROM NEAR NEEDLES,

156
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CALIFORNIA, WHERE U.S. 95 MEETS

157
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
HIGHWAY 40, I-40, IT HAD TO SHUT

158
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
DOWN IN BOTH WAYS BECAUSE OF ALL

159
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
THAT RAIN.

160
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
GREATER THAN A HALF INCH IN JUST
15 MINUTES.

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU, IT'S NOT

162
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
OVER.

163
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AND THIS IS A TWO-DAY EVENT

164
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000

TOMORROW, YOU COULD GET TWO-PLUS

167
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
INCHES VERY QUICKLY.

168
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AND QUICKLY DAVID, I HAVE TO

169
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
TELL YOU, HEAT IN THE MIDWEST,

170
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
IT IS RECORD-BREAKING.

171
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
MINNEAPOLIS TODAY HIT 96.

172
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
THEY WILL STAY IN THE 90s.

173
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
LEGITIMATE HEAT WAVE FOR

174
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS AND KANSAS

175
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
CITY.

176

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, INTENDED

181
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.

182
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THERE IS

183
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS

184
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THE SYRIAN REGIME THAT USED

185
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ITS OWN

186
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000

187
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AND TONIGHT, MORE OF THOSE NEW

188
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH.

189
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
BELIEVED TO BE THE SINGLE

190
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
DEADLIEST ATTACK SO FAR THERE IN
SYRIA.

191
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SYRIA SAYS IT WILL ALLOW
INSPECTORS.

192
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THAT TIME

193
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
HAS PASSED.

194
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
AND SO TONIGHT HERE, WE ASK,

195
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WILL AMERICA ACT?

196
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

197
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

198
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000

SYRIA THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH

205
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
STRONG WORDS FROM U.S. OFFICIALS

206
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000

NAVY DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES

208
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
NOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA

209
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
COULD LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILES

210
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
INTO SYRIA WHENEVER ORDERED,

211
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
TARGETING SYRIAN REGIME COMMAND

212
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS,

213
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AIRFIELDS OR AIRCRAFT THAT MIGHT

214
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
BE USED TO CARRY CHEMICAL

215
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
WEAPONS.

216
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ANOTHER OPTION -- U.S. FIGHTER

217
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
JETS LAUNCHING WEAPONS FROM

218
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
OUTSIDE SYRIAN AIR SPACE.

219
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
>> THE SYRIANS HAVE CREATED THIS

220
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
SANCTUARY, WHERE THERE ARE

221
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES.

222
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
>> Reporter: IMAGES OF THE

223
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK HAVE

224
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OUTRAGED THE WORLD.

225
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED
IN THE MOST HORRIFIC WAY.

226
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL NOT

227
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
INTERVENE UNTIL THE ATTACK IS

228
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
VERIFIED, BUT ADMINISTRATION

229
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
OFFICIALS ARE TONIGHT SAYING

230
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
THERE IS A STRONG SUSPICION THAT

231
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THE ASSAD REGIME LAUNCHED THE

232
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE REBELS

233
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE KIND OF

234
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ROCKETS IN WHICH THE CHEMICALS

235
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
WERE BELIEVED TO BE DELIVERED.

236
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
TODAY, SYRIA SAID IT WOULD ALLOW
U.N. INSPECTORS TO VISIT THE

237
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SITE, BUT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY

238
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND

239
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THE EVIDENCE THEY WOULD PRESENT

240
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
IS LIKELY CORRUPTED.

241
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SO, HOW SOON COULD THIS HAPPEN?

242
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS, A

243
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
RESPONSE MUST BE TIMELY, DONE

244
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SOON ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANOTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

245
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
"WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

246
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
MONTHS."

247
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
>> I THINK THE BEST THAT WE

248
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
COULD HOPE FOR IS TO DETER MR.

249
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
ASSAD FROM USING CHEMICALS

250
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AGAIN.

251
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
AND WORST CASE, DRAG US INTO A

252
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
LARGER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT.

253
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
>> Reporter: DAVID, THE

254
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000

255
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
VERY CLEAR THEY DO NOT WANT TO

256
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
TAKE ANY KIND OF ACTION ALONE.

257
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
SO, THERE HAVE BEEN URGENT

258
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
MEETINGS WITH ALLIES HERE IN THE

259
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> MARTHA RADDATZ WITH US AGAIN

262
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
MARTHA, OUR THANKS TO YOU.

DARK SUNGLASSES THERE.
LAST WEEK, WE SHOWED YOU MUBARAK

KNOX IS BEING TRIED AGAIN FOR

290
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THE MURDER OF HER ROOMMATE BACK

SHE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON

292
