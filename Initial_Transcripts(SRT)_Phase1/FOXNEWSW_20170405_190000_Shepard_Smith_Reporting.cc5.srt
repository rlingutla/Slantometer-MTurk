1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR HAD

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
ALREADY MADE NORRIS AN HONORARY

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
TEXAS RANGER.
WHAT IS BETTER, A RANGER OR

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
CITIZEN?
HERE'S SHEP.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
>> Shepard: FIRST FROM THE FOX

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
NEWS DECK, A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THE UNITED STATES AND A WORLD.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A MAJOR SHIFT FROM PRESIDENT

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
TRUMP HIMSELF THIS AFTERNOON

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
DURING A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
WITH JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE LATEST

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
ACTS OF BARBER AL-ASSAD CAN'T BE

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
TOLERATED.
>> THAT ACT ON CHILDREN HAD A

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
BEEN IMPACT ON ME.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT AND SEEING

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
IT.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THAT.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY, AND

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE -- AND

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
HAPPENED -- THAT MY ATTITUDE

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
CHANGED VERY MUCH.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>> IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED, HIS

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
ATTITUDE AND SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
CHANGED.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
STATES WILL BECOME FOR ENGAGED

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
IN THE CONFLICT?

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT SPECIFIC.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
WHEN ADD IN SYRIA'S ACTIONS

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
CROSSED A RED LINE, HE SAID

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
THIS.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
ME.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
INNOCENT BABIES, BABY, LITTLE

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
BABIES, WITH A CHEMICAL GAS THAT

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
IS SO LETHAL THAT PEOPLE WERE

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT GAS IT WAS,

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
THAT CROSSES MANY, MANY LINES,

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
BEYOND A RED LINES.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
>> Shepard: BEYOND A RED LINE.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
THE BACKGROUND HERE IS

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
IMPORTANT.
YOU MAY REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
IN 2012 WARNED THAT BARBER

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
AL-ASSAD CROSSED A RED LINE

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
SHOULD HE USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THE DICTATOR DID USE THEM

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
ANYWAY.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED WITH

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
DIPLOMACY AND STEAD OF MILITARY

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
ACTION.
>> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
CRISIS WHEN HE SET THE RED LINE

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IN THE SAND.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WHEN HE DIDN'T CROSS THAT RED

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
LINE AFTER MAKING THE THREAT,

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THAT SET US BACK A LONG WAYS NOT

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
ONLY IN SYRIA BUT IN MANY OTHER

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
BECAUSE IT WAS A BLANK THREAT.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
WAS NOT ONE OF OUR BETTER DAYS

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
AS A COUNTRY.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
>> THAT WAS 2012.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
AND CITIZEN TRUMP URGED OBAMA

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
NOT TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HE TWEETED THIS.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
HE ALSO TWEETED --

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
>> Shepard: NOW THE PRESIDENT

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
SAYS HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
THAT IT'S NOW HIS

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT HE WILL

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
ACT.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
PRESIDENT HAS BLAMED BARBER

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
AL-ASSAD FOR KILLING HIS OWN

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
PEOPLE.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
YESTERDAY THE ATTACK WAS

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
LAUNCHED KILLING DOZENS OF

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN ASLEEP

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
IN THEIR BEDS.

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
RUSSIA HAS BLAMED IT ON THE

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SYRIAN REBELS.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
STATES.
OFFICIALS IN MOSCOW SAYS A

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A WEAPONS

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DUMP THAT RELEASED THE DEADLY

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
CHEMICALS.
HERE'S THE BIG PICTURE.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
THIS SORT OF THING HAS BEEN

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
HAPPENING FOR YEARS.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THE SYRIAN DICTATOR'S BARREL

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
BOMBS HAVE KILLED TENS OF

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
INCLUDING WOMEN AND BABIES IN

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THEIR BEDS.
THAT TOO IS A WAR CRIME.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
BUT IT'S A HORRIFIC VIDEO THAT

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID CHANGED HIS

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
MINDS AND THE NATION'S POLICY

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TOWARDS THIS CONFLICT.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
WE HAVE NO WAY TO KNOW WHETHER

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS SIGNALLING AN

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
IMMEDIATE MILITARY RESPONSE.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OF THIS WE'RE SURE.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
THE SYRIAN REGIME IS BACKED BY

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE RUSSIANS.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THEM AS ARE IRANIANS.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENTER

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THIS CONFLICT, SUPPORTING

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
MILITARILY THE REBELS, FIGHTING

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AGAINST THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD BE

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
FIGHTING THE RUSSIANS AND THE

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IRANIANS.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS IS

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
HE WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY AND

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CAREFULLY NOT SO.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
>> HE'S BEEN STUDIOUSLY

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
NONSPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE
WILL TAKE ACROSS THE WORLD.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
HE'S BEEN VERY STUDIOUS SAYING

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
TOO OFTEN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS TELEGRAPHING

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
WHAT SORT OF ACTION THEY WOULD

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
TAKE.

130
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
HE GOES BACK TO MOSUL.

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THEY TELEGRAPHED WHAT THEY WOULD

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
DO IN MOSUL TELLING LEADERS WHAT

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
THEY WOULD DO TO DIG IN OR GET

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
OUT.
IT'S CLEAR THIS ATTACK YESTERDAY

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
IN SYRIA HAS HAD A PROFOUND

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
IMPACT ON THE PRESIDENT.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMAGES OF

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE BABIES

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
DYING AND SUFFERING HORRIBLY IN

140
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THE WAKE OF IN GAS ATTACK.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
SAYING THAT IT HAS CROSSED A

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
NUMBER OF LINES, NOT JUST A RED

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
LINE, AND IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE SOME

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
SORT OF ACTION IN THE WAKE OF

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
ALL OF THIS.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE STRIDENT

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
TERMS THAT HE HAS BEEN, BUT

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
BEING DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
ABOUT WHAT THE UNITED STATES'

151
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
RESPONSE MIGHT BE.

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
HERE'S THE PRESIDENT.

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
NOTICED ABOUT ME IS MILITARILY,

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I DON'T LIKE TO SAY WHERE I'M

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
GOING, WHAT I'M DOING.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I WATCHED ATTACK ADMINISTRATIONS

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
SAYING WE WILL ATTACK SUCH AND

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
SUCH A DAY AND SUCH AND SUCH AN

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
HOUR.

161
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING ONE

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
THING.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU, AS

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
MUCH AS I RESPECT YOU.

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
>> THIS COULD BE A GAME CHANGER

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
IN THE POSTURE TOWARDS SYRIA.

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THAT

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
REGIME CHANGE WAS NOT A

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
PARTICULAR PRIORITY FOR THE U.S.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
MAY BE CHANGING HIS MIND, IF NOT

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ON REGIME CHANGE, AT LEAST IN

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THE UNITED STATES APPROACH TO

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
AL-ASSAD.

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A POWERFUL

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
ALLY WITH THE KING OF JORDAN

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
STANDING AT THE PRESIDENT'S

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
STRIDE WHO IS STRIDENT IN HIS

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CONDEMNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
SYRIA.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
>> AND THE PRESENCE OF KING

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
ABDULLAH GAVE THIS MORE GRAVITY.

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SPEAKING ON A WORLD STAGE AND

183
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
CERTAINLY ON LIVE TELEVISION.

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WHEN YOU CAN CONSIDER WHAT THE

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OPTICS OF THIS ARE, JORDAN, THE

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
UNITED STATES, SYRIAN REBELS

187
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
IRANIANS.
THAT'S WORLD WAR DEFINED.

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT IN FROM THE

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
30,000 FOOT LEVEL, IT'S CLEAR

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE LAST HOUR

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYTHING

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID IN THE

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
PAST, AS A CANDIDATE AND AS

197
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
PRESIDENT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
REGIME CHANGE.
THIS IS PURSUED BY.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM.

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
WHEN YOU HAVE A REGIME CHANGE,

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
YOU WIND UP IN A WORSE SPOT THAN

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
YOU DID BEFORE EXACTING A CHANGE

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
AT THE TOP.

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
HE SAID WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE

205
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
FIGHTING IN SYRIA?

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
WE DON'T FLOW WHO THEY ARE.

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
WHILE THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
APPROACH TO BASSER AL-ASSAD, IT

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
SHOWS HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TRUST

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
OF THE PLAYER THERE'S IN SYRIA.

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
UNCLEAR WHAT HE WILL DO.

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> JOHN ROBERTS, THANK YOU.

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
LET'S TURN TO JOSH LETTERMAN.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
HE'S A FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
FOR THE FOREIGN PRESS.

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WE'RE TO

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
TAKE HIM LITERALLY AND

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
SERIOUSLY, SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
FOREIGN POLICY SHIFT.

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
>> IF HE IS INDEED CHANGING THE

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
WAY HE VIEWS ASSAD AND CHANGING

222
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN

223
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
MULTIPLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING THAT IT
WAS NO LONGER A U.S. PRIORITY TO

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
GET RID OF ASSAD IN SYRIA, THAT

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WOULD BE A MAJOR SHIFT.

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET FROM

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
TRUMP, WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO

229
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ABOUT IT.

230
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THAT IS WHY THIS IS SUCH A

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIM.

232
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR

233
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
OVERSEAS CRISES THAT HE'S HAD TO

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
DEAL WITH AND THE FIRST TIME

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
HE'S HAD TO TRANSLATE THE TOUGH

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
TALK ABOUT DEALING WITH

237
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
ADVERSARIES AND DEALING WITH

238
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
DIFFICULT DECISIONS INTO ACTUAL

239
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
ACTION.

240
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING ALREADY

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ARE LOOKING TO THE U.S. FOR

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
LEADERSHIP.
ONE TO KNOW IF THIS IS A SIGNAL

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
OF A MILITARY RESPOND THE U.S.

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
CONSIDERING AS NIKKI HALEY

246
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SEEMED TO SUGGEST AT THE

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SECURITY COUNCIL OR IF IT'S

248
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
GOING TO BE MORE RHETORIC THAT

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
DOESN'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
TRUMP VERY RELUCTANT TO SHOW ANY

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
LEG ON THAT AT THE WHITE HOUSE

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
TODAY.

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
>> Shepard: JOSH, BASED ON YOUR

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
REPORTING, HUGH WOULD A

255
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
STATEMENT LIKE THIS IN THAT

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SETTING, ACCOMPANIED BY THAT

257
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WORLD LEADER, BE RECEIVED IN

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
TEHRAN, MOSCOW, DAMASCUS?

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> I THINK WITH SOME UN

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
CERTAINTY.
PEOPLE ARE HEARTENED TO HEAR THE

261
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
PRESIDENT SO FORCEFULLY, TALKING

262
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
IN EMOTIONAL TERMS ABOUT THE

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK.

264
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
BUT TALK IS TALK.

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE

266
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
IS THERE GOING TO BE A

267
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
DIFFERENCE FROM THE OBAMA

268
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
ADMINISTRATION IN WHAT ACTUALLY

269
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
HAPPENS ON THE GROUND.

270
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
IS THE U.S. GOING TO TRY TO

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
STRIKE ASSAD TO DEAL WITH HIS

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
ATTACKS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED,

274
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
HE'S BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO FIRE

275
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THE U.S. IN CONFLICTS IN THE

276
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
MIDDLE EAST BUT HE HAS SAID HIS

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
VIEW HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

278
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
IT'S EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER THIS

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
WILL AFFECT HOW TRUMP IS

280
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
AFFECTING THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN SYRIA,

283
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID

284
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
IS HIS TOP PRIORITY.

285
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
>> JOSH LEDDERMAN AT THE WHITE

286
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
HOUSE.
THANK YOU.

287
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
LET'S GO TO CHARLES HANDLEMAN

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
FROM THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE IN

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
WASHINGTON.
WHAT DOES THIS SIGNAL TO YOU AND

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
HOW WOULD THIS SIGNAL BE

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
RECEIVED IN YOUR MIND IN THOSE

292
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
CAPITOLS OF DAMASCUS, MOSCOW AND

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
BEYOND?
>> THERE ARE WAYS FOR.

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
TRUMP TO BE VERY TOUGH ON ASSAD

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WITHOUT CHANGING HIS PREVIOUS

296
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
POLICY.

297
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I AGREE WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT

298
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
YOU WERE JUST ENGAGED IN WITH

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS ON

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
WHETHER TRUMP HAS TAKEN A WHOLE

301
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
NEW PERSPECTIVE ON ASSAD.

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
CLEARLY HE HAS.

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN HE NEEDS TO

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
MAKE ASSAD THE FOCUS OPEN

305
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
AMERICAN REGIME CHANGE.

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WE HAVE ATTEMPTED THAT FOR SIX

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
YEARS.

308
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
IT HASN'T WORKED.

309
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
WE'VE HAD THAT AS OUR FORMAL

310
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
POLICY SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
ARTICULATED THAT IN 2007.

312
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD SAY,

313
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFE

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
HAVENS THAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT.

315
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
TURN THEM INTO AUTONOMOUS PARTS

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
OF SYRIA OVER TIME AND HELP THE

317
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
REGIONS IF WE EVER GET TO A

318
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
PEACEFUL PERIOD TO HELP

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
RECONSTRUCT THEMSELVES, HE

320
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY MONEY

321
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
OR DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT AND HOPE

322
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THAT SOME OTHER PROCESS PUSHES

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
HIM OUT OF POWER.

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
THAT MAY NOT WORK ANY TIME SOON

325
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UN PRECEDE

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
PRECEDENTED.
LIKE SERBIA AND BOSNIA AND

327
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
KOSOVO.

328
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
WE DID NOT MAKE REGIME CHANGE A

329
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
FOREIGN POLICY GOAL.

330
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
HIS OWN PEOPLE UNSEEDED HIM AND

331
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
ENDED UP IN A WAR TIMES TRIAL

332
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
BEFORE HIS DEATH.

333
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO

334
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
THINK THIS THROUGH THAT ALLOW

335
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
YOU TO BE TOUGH ON ASSAD AND

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
KNOW IT'S TOUGH TO OVERTHROW

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
HIM.

338
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
>> Shepard: IT'S HARD TO KNOW

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WHAT HAS CHANGED.

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE

341
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SYRIAN REGIMES TO USE BARREL

342
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
BOMBS TO KILL BABIES IN THEIR

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BEDS BY THE HUNDREDS OF

344
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
THOUSANDS IN WHAT IS

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
UNQUESTIONABLY A SERIES OF WAR

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
CRIMES.
NOW THERE'S VIDEO OF THIS AS

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
HORRIFIC AS IT IS, THERE IS NO

348
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
CHANGE IN ACTION AND ATTITUDE.

349
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A

350
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THEME.
>> I AGREE WITH THAT 100%.

351
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THE EDUCATION OF AN AMERICAN

353
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
PRESIDENT.
ALL OF US HAS BEEN HARDENED BY

354
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THE WARS OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO

355
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
THE POINT THAT IT WAS EASIER TO

356
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
FRANKLY TURN OFF THE TELEVISION

357
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THESE

358
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
TRAGEDIES BECAUSE WE BEGAN TO

359
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
DOUBT IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING

360
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
ABOUT THEM ANYWAY.

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
OF COURSE, FOR MANY REPUBLICANS,

362
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

363
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
POLICIES THAT WERE CAUSING THE

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
PROBLEMS PREVIOUSLY.

365
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
WE'VE HEARD SEAN SPICER SAY THAT

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THIS WEEK.

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
BUT TODAY OR YESTERDAY,

368
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO CONFRONT

369
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THIS VISUAL BEFORE HIS OWN EYES

370
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
ON HIS WATCH.

371
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I THINK IT'S GOT TO FEEL

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
THAT OVAL OFFICE THAN IT WOULD

374
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
HAVE EVER FELT AS A CONSUMER OF

375
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
THE NECESSARY.

376
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THAT'S WHAT'S CHANGED.

377
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH MR. TRUMP

378
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
HIMSELF HAS BECOME ENGAGED IN

379
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THE WHOLE PROCESS.

380
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, MICHAEL.

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I APPRECIATE IT.

382
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THE PRESIDENT NOW TELLS "THE NEW

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
YORK TIMES" WITH NO EVIDENCE TO

384
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
BACK IT UP THAT THE FORMER

385
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR SUSAN

386
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
RICE MAY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME.

387
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
THE IDENTITIES WERE REVEALED IN

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AFTER THEY

389
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
WERE MENTIONED IN INTERCEPTED

COMMUNICATIO

391
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
COMMUNICATIONS.
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT OFFER A

392
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
SLIVER OF EVIDENCE AND REFUSED

393
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
TO SAY IF HE'S SEEN ANY NEW

394
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
INTELLIGENCE THAT WOULD BACK

395
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
THIS UP.
THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX

396
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
NEWS DECK ON A WEDNESDAY

397
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000

Anyone can dream.

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Making it a reality
is the hard part.

406
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
From the B-2 to
the upcoming B-21,

407
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Northrop Grumman

408

America an advantage

And we're looking for a
few dreamers to join us.

HE THINKS THE FORMER NATIONAL

SECURITY ADVISERS SUSAN RICE MAY

413
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME WHEN SHE

414
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
ASKED FOR THE NAMES OF THE

415
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN FOREIGN

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
SURVEILLANCE.

THE NEW YORK TIMES BROKE THE

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
THE TIMES REPORTS THE PRESIDENT

420
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000

WITHIN TRUMP'S ORBIT SHOWED UP.

424
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
ANALYSTS SAY IT IS LEGAL FOR A

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO ASK

426
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
FOR THE NAMES OF AMERICANS

427
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
MENTIONED IN INTELLIGENCE

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
REPORTS.

429
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
SHE SAYS THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

430
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
RICE SAID SHE HAD TO DO THAT AS

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
PART OF HER JOB.

432
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
SHE DENIED SHE LEAKED ANY

433
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
INFORMATION TO ANYONE.

434
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SO FAR THERE IS NO PROOF OF ANY

435
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
KIND OF WHICH FOX NEWS IS AWARE

436
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
THAT SHE DID.

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
THE CHIEF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE

438
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
CORRESPONDENCE CATHERINE
HERRIDGE IS IN WASHINGTON.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
HOW DOES THIS UNMASKING WORK?

440
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
>> OKAY.

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
UNMASKING IS A SIMPLE PROCESS.

442
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
IN THIS CASE, THE NATIONAL

443
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
SECURITY ADVISER, SUSAN RICE,

444
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
WOULD HAVE CONTACTED THE NSA,

445
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THE AGENCY THAT RUNS

446
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
SURVEILLANCE AND ASKED TO HAVE

447
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
U.S. PERSON 1 OR AMERICAN 1

448
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
IDENTIFIED BY THEIR NAME.

449
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THE NSA WOULD HAVE TO BE

450
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
SATISFIED THAT THIS IS A

451
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
REASONABLE RE-QUEST AND HAS A

452
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
NATIONAL SECURITY FOUNDATION FOR

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
THEM TO IDENTIFY THAT AMERICAN.

454
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
WHAT IS ILLEGAL HERE IS IF THOSE

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
NAMES, ONCE THEY'RE IDENTIFIED,

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
ARE THEN GIVEN TO THE MEDIA OR

457
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T HAVE A

458
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
NEED TO KNOW.

459
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
THERE'S ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT ON

460
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
THIS, WHICH DOES RAISE QUESTIONS

461
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
ABOUT WHAT SUSAN RICE SAID TO

462
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
NBC YESTERDAY.

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
SHE SAID THIS WAS ALL IN THE

464
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
COURSE OF THE RUSSIA

465
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
INVESTIGATION.

466
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
WHILE WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY

467
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS,

468
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
CONGRESSMAN PETER KING, A

469
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
REPUBLICAN ON THE HOUSE

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS

471
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
BRIEFED ON THE DOCUMENTS AND HE

472
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
SAID NOTHING IN THEM RELATED TO

473
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
RUSSIA AND THE DETAILS WERE

474
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
HIGHLY PERSONAL IN NATURE.

475
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
>> THIS IS INFORMATION ABOUT

476
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
EVERYDAY LIVES, WHO THEY WERE

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
TALKING TO, MEETING TO EAT,

478
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
NOTHING OF ANY SUBSTANCE OF

479
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
VALUE UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO

480
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
LAY SOMETHING OUT ON SOMEBODY.

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH

482
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
CONCLUSIONS WHO HAS MORE MERIT

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
TO THE STORY UNTIL WE CAN SEE

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THE DOCUMENTS, IF THEY'RE EVER

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
DECLASSIFIED.

486
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
THIS SEEMS TO ME A CLASSIC CASE

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
OF THE GLASS BEING HALF FULL,

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
HALF EMPTY.

489
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
THOSE THAT SUPPORT THE OBAMA

490
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY WERE

491
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
DOING DUE DILIGENCE.

492
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
THOSE THAT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT

493
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
SAID IT AMOUNTED TO POLITICAL

494
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
SPYING.
>> Shepard: MIGHT SHE BE CALLED

495
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
AS A WITNESS?

496
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
>> IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY.

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
WE HEARD FROM A RANKING

498
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
DEMOCRAT.
HE WAS SPOKING TO CNN THIS

499
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
MORNING AND HE SAID THAT THEY

500
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
WOULD BE OPEN TO HAVING RICE

501
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
TESTIFY, BUT HE DIDN'T SPEAK TO

502
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THE MERITS OF WHAT HER TESTIMONY

503
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
WOULD BE.
>> THAT'S A FAR CRY FROM ANY

504
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
SUGGESTION THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS

505
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
WIRETAPPING DONALD TRUMP.

506
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO THROW UP THIS

507
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
SMOKE SCREEN IN AN EFFORT NOT

508
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
ONLY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF

509
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
OUR COMMITTEE FROM THE RUSSIAN

510
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
INVESTIGATION BUT TO SOMEHOW

511
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
JUSTIFY THESE UNJUSTIFIABLE

512
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
COMMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT.

513
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
>> THAT WASN'T THE SOUND BITE I

514
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WAS EXPECTING.

515
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
HE SAID THAT HE WAS OPEN TO

516
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
HAVING HER.

517
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
RIGHT THERE HE'S SAYING THIS IS

518
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
AN EFFORT BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO

519
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
CHANGE THE MEANING.

520
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
HE SAID HE WOULD BE OPEN TO

521
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
HAVING RICE TESTIFY BUT IT'S

522
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
GOING TO DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY

523
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
FIND IN THE COURSE OF THEIR

524
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
INVESTIGATION.

525
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
SUSAN RICE SAYS SHE NEEDS TO SEE

526
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
HOW THINGS DEVELOP BEFORE SHE

527
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
WOULD MAKE THAT KIND OF

528
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
COMMITMENT.
>> Shepard: CATHERINE HERRIDGE

529
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
IN WASHINGTON, THANK YOU.

530
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

531
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
>> Shepard: AT THE ROOT OF THIS,

532
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
THE RUSSIANS INTERFERED IN THE

533
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL

534
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
ELECTION.
THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION.

535
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
THEY WORKED TO HELP DONALD

536
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
TRUMP'S CHANCES OF BECOMING

537
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
QUESTION AND HURTING HILLARY

538
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
CLINTON'S CHANCES.

539
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
THERE'S THREE SEPARATE

540
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS NOW IN
THE HOUSE, THE SENATE AND BY THE

541
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
FBI ON A CRIMINAL LEVEL AND THE

542
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
QUESTION REMAINS WAS THERE

543
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
COLLUSION BETWEEN TEAM TRUMP AND

544
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
THE EFFORTS TO INTERFERE IN THE

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
ELECTION.

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THAT'S THE MATTER BEING

547
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
INVESTIGATED.
THE NEWS CONTINUES AFTER THIS.

548
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Umbrellas!!

549
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You need one of these.

550
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You wouldn't put up
with an umbrella

551
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that covers you part way,

552
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
so when it comes to
pain relievers,

553
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
why put up with
just part of a day?

554
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Aleve, live whole not part.

555
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Tell you what,

556

I'll give it to

557

558

then smash it into a tree.

559
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Your insurance company

560
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
raises your rates.

561
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Maybe you should've done

562
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
more research on them.

Liberty Mutual won't

566
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
raise your rates due to

567
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000

575
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
>> Shepard: IVANKA TRUMP SAYS

576
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
WHERE SHE'S DISAGREES WITH HER

577
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
FATHER, HE KNOWS IT.

578
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED TO

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
QUESTIONS WHY SHE HASN'T COME

580
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
OUT AGAINST SOME OF HER FATHER'S

581
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
AGENDA.

582
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
>> I RESPECT THE FACT THAT HE

583
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
ALWAYS LICENSE.

584
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
THAT'S HOW HE WAS IN BUSINESS,

585
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THAT'S HOW HE IS AS PRESIDENT.

586
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I SPEAK UP FREQUENTLY.

587
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
MY FATHER AGREES WITH ME ON SO

588
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
MANY ISSUES.

589
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
WHERE HE DOESN'T, HE KNOWS WHERE

590
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I STAND.

591
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
>> LAST WEEK IVANKA TRUMP TOOK

592
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
AN UNPAID ROLE IN THE WHITE

593
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
HOUSE.
AFTER THE ELECTION, SHE SAID SHE

594
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
WOULD NOT BE WORKING IN THE

595
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
ADMINISTRATION.
SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED HER

596
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
SAYING SHE WAS ADVISING THE

597
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
PRESIDENT WITHOUT HAVING

598
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
GOVERNMENT ETHIC RULES.

599
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SHE SAID SHE TOOK THE OFFICIAL

600
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
TITLE TO SHOW SHE'S HOLDING

601
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
HERSELF TO THE HIGHEST ETHICAL

602
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
STANDARDS.
JONATHAN HUNT WITH THIS.

603
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
WHAT ELSE DID THE FIRST DAUGHTER

604
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
HAVE TO SAY?

605
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
>> WELL, SHEP, THE MAIN FOCUS IS

606
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
THIS ISSUE OF NOT SPEAKING OUT

607
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
PUBLICLY.

608
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
IVANKA TRUMP SAID PUBLIC SILENCE

609
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S SILENT IN

610
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
PRIVATE.

611
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
>> I THINK THERE'S MULTIPLE WAYS

612
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
TO HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD.

613
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
IN SOME CASES, IT'S PROTEST,

614
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
GOING ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS AND

615
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
TALKING ABOUT OR DENOUNCING

616
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
EVERY ISSUE YOU DISAGREE WITH.

617
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
OTHER TIMES IT'S QUIETLY AND

618
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
DIRECTLY AN CANDIDLY.

619
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
>> SHE WAS ASKED IF SHE FELT

620
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
COMPLICIT AS SHE'S BEING

621
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
PARODIED AS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

622
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
HARSHER POLICIES.

623
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
>> IF BEING COMPLICIT IS WANTING

624
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD AND TO

625
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT, THEN I'M

626
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
COMPLICIT.

627
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CRITICS

628
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
THAT MAY SAY THAT OF ME, IF THEY

629
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
FOUND THEMSELVES IN THIS UNIQUE

630
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
AND UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION THAT

631
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'M NOW IN WOULD DO ANY

632
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
DIFFERENTLY THAN I'M DOING.

633
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
>> TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, SHEP,

634
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
THAT ANSWER IN PARTICULAR

635
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
SOUNDED LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN STILL

636
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
WORKING HER WAY THROUGH WHAT IS,

637
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
AS SHE PUT IT, AN UNPRECEDENTED

638
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
SITUATION.
SHEP?

639
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
>> Shepard: WHAT ABOUT ETHICAL

640
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
COMPLICATIONS OF KEEPING HER

641
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
BUSINESS WHILE WORKING AT THE

642
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
WHITE HOUSE?

643
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
>> WELL, SHE HAS OF COURSE PUT

644
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THAT BUSINESS IN TRUST.

645
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
IT'S RUN BY FAMILY MEMBERS.

646
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
SHE SAID IF HER AIM WAS TO MAKE

647
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
MONEY FROM HER FATHER'S

648
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
POSSESSION, THERE'S AN EASIER

649
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
WAY TO DO IT.
>> I WOULD ARGUE IF I HAD NOT

650
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
COME TO WASHINGTON D.C. AND IF I

651
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
WAS IN NEW YORK GROWING MY

652
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
BUSINESS, I WOULD BE DOING FAR

653
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
BETTER THAN BY PLACING A

654
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
RESTRICTIONS I'VE PLACED ON MY

655
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
TEAM AND ENSURING THAT ANY

656
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
GROWTH IS DONE WITH EXTREME

657
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
CAUTION.

658
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
>> NOW SHE ALSO GAVE A GLIMPSE

659
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
OF A NEW FAMILY LIFE IN D.C. AND

660
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SHE'S TAKEN HER FAMILY TO

661
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
MUSEUMS.

662
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
AND SHE HAS NOT SAID WHETHER

663
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
SHE'S DITCHING THE YANKEES FOR

664
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THE NATIONALS.

665
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
>> THANKS, JONATHAN.

666
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
MORE AHEAD ON THE MASSIVE

667
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
DEVELOPMENT OF THE U.S. FOREIGN

668
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
POLICY.
PRESIDENT TRUMP NORTH KOREA AND

669
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
ITS DICTATOR A BIG PROBLEM IN

670
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THE WAKE OF THE LATEST MISSILE

671
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
LAUNCH.

672
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
IT ALSO COMES AHEAD OF A VERY

673
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
IMPORTANT MEETING BETWEEN

674
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHINA'S

675
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
LEADER.
REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

676
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
THAT THE UNITED STATES IS READY

677
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
TO GO IT ALONE IN NORTH KOREA IF

678
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
NECESSARY.
SO WHAT TO EXPECT NOW?

679
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
WE'RE APPROACHING THE BOTTOM OF

680
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
THE HOUR AND THE TOP OF THE

681
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
NEWS.

682
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Ooh...

683
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Psst.
Hey...

684
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
...where you going?

685
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
We've got that thing!

686
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You know...Diarrhea?

687
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Abdominal pain?

688
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
But we said we'd be there...

689
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Woap, who makes the
decisions around here?

690
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's me.

691
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Don't think I'll make it.

692
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Stomach again...Send!

693
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
If you're living with frequent,

694
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
unpredictable diarrhea
and abdominal pain,

695
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
you may have Irritable Bowel
Syndrome with Diarrhea

696
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
or IBS-D - a condition that can
be really frustrating.

697
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Talk to your doctor
about VIBERZI...

698
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
a different way to treat IBS-D.

699
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
VIBERZI is a
prescription medication

700
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
you take every day

701
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that helps proactively manage

702
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
both diarrhea and abdominal pain

703
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
at the same time.

704
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So you stay ahead
of your symptoms.

705
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
VIBERZI can cause new or
worsening abdominal pain.

706
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do not take VIBERZI if you have
or may have had:

707
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
pancreas or
severe liver problems,

708
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
problems with alcohol abuse,

709
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
long-lasting or
severe constipation,

710
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
or a blockage of your bowel
or gallbladder.

711
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
If you are taking VIBERZI,

712
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
you should not take medicines
that cause constipation.

713
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The most common side effects of
VIBERZI include

714
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
constipation, nausea, and
abdominal pain.

715
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Stay ahead of IBS-D

716
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
with VIBERZI.

717
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
>> I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE

718
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
FOX REPORT.
AN UPDATE ON AN F-16 CRASH THAT

719
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

720
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
THE PILOT SAFELY EJECTED AFTER

721
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
HIS JET WENT DOWN IN A TRAINING

722
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
MISSION.

723
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THE CRASH HAPPENED IN THE WOODS

724
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
IN MARYLAND.

725
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
MILITARY OFFICIALS SAY THE PILOT

726
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
IS IN GOOD CONDITION WITH MINOR

727
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
INJURIES AND NOBODY ELSE WAS ON

728
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
BOARD THAT JET.

729
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
A WITNESS TOLD OUR LOCAL FOX

730
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
STATION THAT HE WAS SITTING ON

731
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
HIS PORCH WHEN HE HEARD AN

732
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
EXPLOSION.

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
>> I HEARD THIS LOUD NOISE.

734
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I LOOKED UP, THE JET WAS ON

735
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
FIRE.

736
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
AT THAT TIME IT BLEW UP.

737
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
THE PILOT EJECTED.

738
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT OF THE

739
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
PLANE.
THE BIGGEST FIREBALL I'VE EVER

740
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
>> THE WHITE HOUSE HAS ISSUED

925
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
TWO THREATS TO USE FORCE.

926
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
THE CLOCK RUNNING OUT, ALL

927
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.

928
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
THEY'RE A THREAT TO USE FORCE

929
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
NOW.
YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED

930
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
IN SYRIA.

931
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THAT THE

932
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
OBAMA'S FAIL RED LINE.

933
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
INDICATING HE SHOULD HAVE DONE

934
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
SOMETHING.
THAT IS A THREAT.

935
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
MAYBE MORE SUBTLE, BUT CLEARLY

936
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ASSAD UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE'S

937
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
TALKING ABOUT.

938
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
>> AND DOES KIM JONG-UN TAKE

939
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
SOMETHING FROM THAT?

940
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
DO WE HAVE A WAY TO KNOW?

941
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
>> Shepard: WHAT KIM JONG-UN

942
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
WOULD DO, HE HAS LINKS WITH IRAN

943
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
AND SYRIA WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED.

944
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
THAT I HAVE CHINA IN THE

945
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
BACKGROUND.

946
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF HE

947
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
THINKS THE U.S. IS GOING TO

948
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
COMMIT MILITARY FORCE IN THE

949
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
MIDDLE EAST, HE KNOWS THAT WE'RE

950
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
NOT GOING TO DO VERY MUCH IN

951
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
NORTH ASIA, WHICH MEANS HE COULD

952
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
STARTING A PROVOCATION AGAINST

953
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
SOUTH KOREA.
THAT'S HOW THESE THINGS REALLY

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
SORT OF SPREAD FROM ONE REGION

955
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
TO THE OTHER.

956
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
THIS LOOKS LIKE 1914 WHEN THINGS

957
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
GET OUT OF CONTROL.

958
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
>> Shepard: IS THAT HOW IT

959
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
FEELS?

960
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> VERY MUCH SO.

961
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
CLEARLY TWO PREDECESSORS DEALT

962
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HIM A BAD HAND.

963
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
YOU HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW

964
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THAT IS VOLATILE.

965
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

966
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
THAT IS THE REASON WRITE THE

967
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
CHINESE PRESIDENT IS

968
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
CONSEQUENTIAL.

969
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THEY'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

970
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
THE USE OF FORCE IN NORTH KOREA.

971
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
>> A KOREAN WAR, ANOTHER KOREAN

972
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
WAR, COULD BE THE DEATH OF

973
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
MILLIONS.

974
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
>> CLEARLY.

975
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
YOU HAVE 25 MILLION SOUTH

976
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
KOREANS THAT LIVE IN SEOUL.

977
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
NORTH KOREA HAS THE WORLD'S

978
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
FOURTH LARGEST ARMY.

979
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
ABOUT 70% OF THAT ARMY IS FOR

980
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
WARNED DEPLOYED BY THE DMZ.

981
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THEY HAVE HIGH EXPLOSIVES,

982
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, BIOLOGICAL

983
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
AGENTS AND NUKES.

984
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
THE CASUALTIES ON THE FIRST

985
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
HOURS WOULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS

986
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
OF THOUSANDS.

987
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
YOU TALK ABOUT A FULL SCARE WAR,

988
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

989
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
THIS BEFORE.

990
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
>> Shepard: AND CHINA CAN HELP

991
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
US HOW?

992
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> CHINA CAN HELP US.

993
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
THEY CAN CUT OFF NORTH KOREA'S

994
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
FLOWS OF CASH.

995
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
>> Shepard: MONEY.
>> BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT GOING

996
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

997
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
BEEN BEHIND NORTH KOREA.

998
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
THEY'VE GIVEN THEM MUCH OF THE

999
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
TECHNOLOGY.

1000
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
FOR INSTANCE, THEIR MOBILE

1001
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
MISSILES ARE RIDING ON CHINESE

1002
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
LAUNCHES AND THE MISSILES THAT

1003
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
NORTH KOREA TESTED LOOK SIMILAR

1004
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
TO THE JL-1.

1005
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
TRUMP NEEDS TO ASK THEM HOW THAT

1006
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
HAPPENED.

1007
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

1008
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
>> Shepard: MORE THAN 100 NAVY

1009
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
INSTRUCTOR PILOTS HAVE GONE ON

1010
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
STRIKE REFUSING TO FLY SINCE

1011
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
LATE LAST WEEK.

1012
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE

1013
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
EXCLUSIVE REPORTING OF OUR

1014
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
JENNIFER GRIFFIN.
THE NAVY IS NOW RESPONDED BY

1015
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
GROUNDING SOME TRAINING JETS.

1016
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
FOX REPORTS THE INSTRUCTOR

1017
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
PILOTS SAY THAT THEY'RE UPSET

1018
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
BECAUSE DEFENSE OFFICIALS HAVE

1019
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
FAILED TO FIX AN ISSUE WITH THE

1020
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
OXYGEN SYSTEMS ON THEIR TRAINING

1021
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
JETS.

1022
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
MULTIPLE FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS HAVE

1023
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
TOLD FOX NEWS THAT POISON IN THE

1024
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
OXYGEN SYSTEMS CAN STRIKE

1025
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
WITHOUT WARNING CAUSING THEM TO

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
BECOME DISORIENTED.

1027
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
NAVY OFFICIALS HAVE ADMITTED TO

1028
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
FOX NEWS THAT THE OXYGEN SYSTEMS

1029
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
ARE A PROBLEM AND THAT THEY ARE

1030
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
WORKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

1031
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
REPORTERS GRIFFIN AND TOMLINSON

1032
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
WERE ADVISING VICE PRESIDENT

1033
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
MIKE PENCE'S SON, THE MARINE

1034
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
FIRST LIEUTENANT, MICHAEL PENCE,

1035
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
IS AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF

1036
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
STUDENTS PILOTS THE STRIKE HAS

1037
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
AFFECTED.

1038
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
NOW FOR A LIVE LOOK AT THE DOW.

1039
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE EARLIER

1040
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
TODAY, THE DOW WAS UP ABOUT 160

1041
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
POINTS.
SINCE THEN, IT HAS NOSE DIVED

1042
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
AFTER A NEW REPORT THAT CLAIMED

1043
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
THAT AMERICAN BUSINESS ADDED

1044
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
263,000 JOBS LAST MONTH.

1045
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO ADP A

1046
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
COMPANY THAT PROCESSES PAYROLL.

1047
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
THAT'S NEARLY 80,000 MORE JOBS

1048
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THAN ANALYSTS PREDICTED.

1049
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
THAT'S WHY THE MARKET WENT UP

1050
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE

1051
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
AFTERNOON.

1052
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
THIS IS A GRAPH OF THE ADP'S JOB

1053
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
NUMBERS SINCE THE RECESSION.

1054
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S OFFICIAL

1055
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
MONTHLY JOBS REPORT CAME OUT

1056
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
FRIDAY.
IN THE PAST, THE ADP'S NUMBERS

1057
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
HAVE DIFFERENT FROM THE

1058
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL COUNT.

1059
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THE BIG NEWS HERE, WHAT HAS

1060
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
HAPPENED SINCE THE PRESIDENT

1061
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
SPOKE.

1062
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
JERRY WILLIS IS WITH US.

1063
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
THIS MOST RECENT REPORT IS AN

1064
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
INTERESTING ONE.
TO ME, GERRI, WHAT HAS HAPPENED

1065
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
SINCE THE PRESIDENT SPOKE, A

1066
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
180-POINT DIVE IS DIRECTLY

1067
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
RELATED, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, SOME RELATION.

1068
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
WE STARTED OUT 180 POINTS.

1069
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
A BIG GAIN DUE TO THE ADP

1070
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
REPORT.
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?

1071
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
IT'S REALLY THE CRYSTAL BALL

1072
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
FRIDAY'S JOB REPORT.
THE NUMBERS, THE BIGGEST GAINS

1073
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
SINCE DECEMBER 2014.

1074
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
ALL EYES ON THE REPORT TODAY.

1075
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
COULDN'T HOLD THE GAINS, NOT AT

1076
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
ALL.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SECTORS

1077
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
DOING WELL HERE.

1078
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.

1079
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
BY THAT, I MEAN WHITE COLLARED

1080
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
JOBS, BACK OFFICE JOBS, UP A

1081
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
BUNCH.
HOSPITALITY LOOKING GOOD HERE.

1082
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THAT SPEAKS WELL TO TOURISM.

1083
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
HEALTHCARE UP.

1084
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
TYPICALLY IS.

1085
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
TYPICALLY DOES WELL.

1086
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
THE SHOCKER.

1087
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
MANUFACTURING UP 30,000.

1088
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
THAT'S THE SECTOR THAT TRUMP

1089
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
TALKS ABOUT OVER AND OVER AND

1090
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
OVER AGAIN.

1091
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
OF COURSE, WE TALK ABOUT THE

1092
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
LEADING SECTORS, WE'LL SEE MORE

1093
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
DETAIL FRIDAY BECAUSE THAT'S

1094
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
WHEN WE GET PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

1095
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
SECTOR JOBS TOGETHER.

1096
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
WE'LL SEE BOTH COMING IN.

1097
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HANG ON TO

1098
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THE MEAGER GAINS AT THIS HOURS,

1099
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
WHICH ARE NOT AS GREAT.

1100
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SHEP,

1101
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS,

1102
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
EXPECTATIONS FOR FRIDAY, GAINS

1103
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
OF 180,000 JOBS AND WE WILL

1104
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
STICK AT 14.7%.

1105
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
THAT'S THE EXPECTATION OUT

1106
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THERE.
>> Shepard: YOU KNOW WHERE I'M

1107
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
GOING TO LOOK FOR YOU?

1108
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
>> WHERE'S THAT?

1109
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
>> Shepard: ON KENNEDY TONIGHT.

1110
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
FOR OUR VIEWERS THAT KNEW -- I

1111
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
WAS IN STUDIO JUST A FEW MINUTES

1112
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
AGO.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT.

1113
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
>> I DIDN'T.

1114
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
>> Shepard: GERRI'S IS KENNEDY'S

1115
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
GUEST TONIGHT ON THE FOX

1116
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
BUSINESS NETWORK.

1117
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
CANDY DEAD A PROGRAM EVERY NIGHT

1118
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
AT 8:00, RIGHT?

1119
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1120
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
>> Shepard: AND A WHOLE

1121
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
DIFFERENT GERRI WILLIS.

1122
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
OUR SURVIVOR AND HERO WILL BE

1123
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
THERE TALKING ABOUT HER LIFE.

1124
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.

1125
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I KNOW 8:00 IS A BUSY HOUR FOR

1126
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
EVERYBODY, BUT IF YOU CAN'T GO

1127
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SEE IT, DVR IT.

1128
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
>> TUNE IN.

1129
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
IT'S KENNEDY, KENNEDY, KENNEDY.

1130
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
>> Shepard: YOU CAN DVR WHATEVER

1131
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
ELSE IS GOING ON.

1132
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS.

1133
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
YOU GOT TO SEE IT.

1134
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
GERRI, GOD BLESS YOU.

1135
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
>> THANK YOU.

1136
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
>> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE

1137
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
TAKING ANOTHER WHACK AT

1138
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
HEALTHCARE.

1139
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
MIKE PENCE IS ON THE HILL WITH

1140
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
LAWMAKERS.

1141
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THIS BATTLE IS STARTING TO SOUND

1142
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
LIKE A BROKEN RECORD WITH THE

1143
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
SAME OLD PROBLEM.

1144
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,000
HEALTHCARE NEXT.

1145
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
>> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE

1146
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
TOUTING WHAT IT CALLS PROGRESS

1147
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
ON A NEW HEALTHCARE BILL AFTER

1148
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND

1149
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
MET WITH REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ON

1150
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
CAPITOL HILL LAST NIGHT.

1151
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
BUT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS

1152
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
WILL NOT PUT A TIMELINE ON ANY

1153
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
OF THIS.

1154
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
CONSERVATIVE FREEDOM CAUCUS

1155
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
CHAIRMAN MARK MEADOWS SAID

1156
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
REPUBLICANS LEFT WITHOUT AN

1157
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
AGREEMENT.
BUT BOTH CONSERVATIVE AND

1158
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
MODERATE REPUBLICANS SAID

1159
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS AND THAT

1160
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
IT WAS A GOOD TALK.

1161
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
BOTH SIDES ARE AT ODDS ABOUT

1162
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
REPEALING SOME OBAMACARE

1163
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
REGULATION.
MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS

1164
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
SAID THE LAST BILL DIDN'T GO FAR

1165
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
ENOUGH TO ROLL BACK REGULATIONS

1166
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
AND MODERATES SAY WE DON'T WANT

1167
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
TO LOSE THE BENEFITS, WHICH IS

1168
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID THIS DAY

1169
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
THIS STARTED.

1170
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
THE NATIONAL REPORTER FROM

1171
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
POLITICO IS OUT.

1172
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
PAUL RYAN SAID YEAH, WE'RE

1173
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
MAKING PROGRESS BUT NO TIME

1174
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
LINE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS NOT A

1175
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
REAL THING, DOESN'T IT?

1176
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
>> IT DOES.

1177
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
IT'S CONTINUING TO HAVE THE SAME

1178
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
SORTS OF CONVERSATION.

1179
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
IT'S PROGRESS AND THEY'RE MAKING

1180
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
PROGRESS.

1181
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY -- THE

1182
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
CONSERVATIVES IN THE HOUSE

1183
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
FREEDOM CAUCUS AND THE MODERATES

1184
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
IN THE TUESDAY GROUP REALLY HAVE

1185
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT GOALS

1186
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
HERE.

1187
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
THE MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM

1188
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
CAUCUS ARE PRIORITIZING

1189
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
STRIPPING BACK THE REGULATIONS

1190
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
IN THE OBAMACARE AND THEY THINK

1191
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
THE ORIGINAL BILL DIDN'T GO FAR

1192
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
ENOUGH.
THE MODERATES IN THE TUESDAY

1193
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
GROUP HAVE A DIFFERENT PRIORITY.

1194
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
THEY WANT TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH

1195
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
INSURANCE.

1196
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
THERE'S NOT A THEORETICAL

1197
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
PROCESS THAT ONE BILL CAN'T DO

1198
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
BOTH.
BUT WHITE HOUSE AT LEAST RIGHT

1199
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
NOW HASN'T PUT FORWARD A BILL

1200
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
THAT WOULD DO BOTH THINGS AND

1201
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
SATISFY BOTH GROUPS.

1202
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
>> SO THEY TALK AND THEY SAY

1203
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
THAT TALKING IS GOING WELL, BUT

1204
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
IT SOUNDS LIKE TO HEAR FROM PAUL

1205
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
RYAN, THEY'RE NOT GETTING

1206
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
ANYWHERE.
THIS COMPLICATES MATTERS FOR THE

1207
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
BUDGET.
THEY COULD HAVE SAVED $880

1208
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
BILLION.
NOW THEY CAN'T.

1209
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO BUDGET

1210
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
NOW.

1211
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
>> THAT WAS THE SPEAKER'S CASE

1212
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
FOR GOING HEALTHCARE FIRST.

1213
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
THAT BY SAVING MONEY, BY

1214
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
STRIKING A HEALTHCARE DEAL, IT
WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DO TAX

1215
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
REFORM AND DO A BUDGET.

1216
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
BECAUSE YOU WOULD MAKE PROGRESS

1217
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
IN CHIPPING AWAY AT THE SAVINGS

1218
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
YOU'D GET FROM DOING IT.

1219
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
ONE INTERESTING THING THAT

1220
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
EMERGED FROM THE TALKS IS THAT

1221
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
THE TUESDAY GROUP AND THE

1222
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
FREEDOM CAUCUS EMERGED WITH

1223
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT

1224
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
EXACTLY THIS BILL WOULD LOOK

1225
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
LIKE.

1226
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
>> Shepard: YOU KNOW HOW THAT

1227
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
HAPPENED.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE THROUGH MIKE

1228
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
PENCE PITCHED THEM TWO DIFFERENT

1229
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
BILLS OR IF THE MEMBERS HAD

1230
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS.

1231
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
BUT IF TWO DIFFERENT PIECES WERE

1232
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
PITCHED, THAT'S AN OVERSIGHT BY

1233
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> Shepard: WASN'T THIS A CASE

1234
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
OF WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT

1235
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
TO HEAR, DON'T LOOK?

1236
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
THEY TOLD THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE,

1237
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
YEAH, WE'RE SAVING MONEY.

1238
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
THEY TOLD THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU

1239
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
WANT IT, YOU CAN KEEP IT.

1240
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
NEITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE

1241
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
TRUE AND THEY READ IT AND WENT

1242
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
WOW.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE READ IT AND

1243
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
17% SUPPORTED.

1244
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE

1245
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
TALKING ABOUT IT BUT NOT DOING

1246
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
ANYTHING BUT TALKING ABOUT IT.

1247
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
IS THAT FAIR?

1248
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
WHAT IS THAT?

1249
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
>> AT THE VERY LEAST, THE

1250
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
MEMBERS OF TWO GROUPS HAD

1251
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS WHAT

1252
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
WOULD BE IN THE LEGISLATION.

1253
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
AS MY COLLEAGUE PUT IT, IT WAS

1254
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
EITHER A CASE OF THE

1255
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
ADMINISTRATION PITCHING TWO

1256
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE

1257
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
DIFFERENT GROUPS OR THE MEMBERS

1258
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
HEARING WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR

1259
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT.

1260
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
WHATEVER THE CASE, NO SUCCESSFUL

1261
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
COMPROMISE REACHED.

1262
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
SO WE'RE NO FURTHER ALONG THAN

1263
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
WHERE WE WERE AT DAY ONE.

1264
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
>> Shepard: GREAT TO TALK TO

1265
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
YOU.

1266
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
THANK YOU.

1267
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
ENJOY YOUR WEDNESDAY.

1268
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
JOINING MAN AND MACHINE.

1269
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR MEMORY SO

1270
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
YOU STOP FORGETTING BIRTHDAYS?

1271
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
HOW ABOUT ADDING ARTIFICIAL

1272
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
INTELLIGENCE TO MAKE MATH

1273
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
HOMEWORK EASIER?

1274
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
SCIENTISTS SAY NOT IF WE DO IT

1275
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
BUT WHEN WE DO IT.

1276
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
KENNEDY IS HERE NEXT.

1277
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
>> YOU CAN UPGRADE YOUR CAR,

1278
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
YOUR PHONE, YOUR HOUSE.

1279
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
YOU CAN SEEN UPGRADE YOURSELF.

1280
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
THAT'S WHAT MARKET WATCH SAYS.

1281
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
AS SOON AS 60 YEARS FROM NOW --

1282
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
THAT MAY BE A STRETCH -- PEOPLE

1283
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
WILL BE ABLE TO BUY THEMSELVES

1284
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
THE HUMAN EQUIVALENT OF

1285
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
PERFORMANCE ENHANCING APPs.

1286
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
A LARGER HARD DRIVE.

1287

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
>> WE ALREADY HAVE IT.

1291
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
IT'S AN EXTERNAL WAYS OF

1292
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
ACCESSING INFORMATION ALMOST

1293
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
IMMEDIATELY.

1294
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THERE'S STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT

1295
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
WE'RE COMPROMISING OUR OWN

1296
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
MEMORIES BY CONSTANTLY ACCESSING

1297
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THINGS ON THE WEB.

1298
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
>> Shepard: THERE'S NO DOUBT.

1299
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
>> SO WHY NOT CUT OUT THE

1300
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
MIDDLEMAN AND PUT THE HARDWARE

1301
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
INTO YOUR BRAIN TO BEGIN WITH.

1302
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
>> Shepard: YOU KNOW PHONE

1303
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
NUMBERS?
I USED TO KNOW 100 OF THEM.

1304
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I KNOW TWO NOW.

1305
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I KNOW TWO NUMBERS.

1306
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
>> UNFORTUNATELY ONE IS 911.

1307
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
YOU HAVE TO CALL THEM.

1308
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
YOU'RE ON FIRE TODAY.

1309
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU.
SO IF YOU PUT IT IN THERE,

1310
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
ATTACH THE PHONE LIKE -- THEN

1311
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
YOU HAVE IT IN THERE.

1312
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

1313
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
>> IT'S NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO

1314
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
ANYTHING.
THINK OF THE COOL STUFF THAT YOU

1315
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
CAN ACCESS AND THE INFORMATION

1316
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
YOU'LL HAVE.

1317
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
A VERY SHORT LEAP FROM HAVING

1318
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
SOME SORT OF A MECHANICAL HARD

1319
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
DRIVE IMPLANTED IN YOUR

1320
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
PHYSIOLOGY IS THE ABILITY TO

1321
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
FLY.
HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE?

1322
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
IT'S LIKE A LIVING, LUCID DREAM.

1323
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
YOU WON'T NEED THE MATRIX.

1324
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
YOU WON'T NEED TO BE PLUGGED IN

1325
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
TO A VIDEO GAME.

1326
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
YOU'LL FLY ALL OVER THE PLACE.

1327
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
TO THE GRAND CANYON NOW.

1328
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
>> WE'RE IN THE MATRIX NOW.

1329
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
>> WE COULD BE.

1330
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
THERE'S PHILOSOPHIES --

1331
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
>> Shepard: WE'RE AN ANT FARM.

1332
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
LIKE A CHILD ANT FARM SOMEWHERE

1333
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
IN ANOTHER WORLD.

1334
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I BET THAT KID IS LAUGHING.

1335
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE ONLY THING

1336
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
TO EXPLAIN IT ALL.

1337
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WE'RE AN ANT FARM OF SOME KID --

1338
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
>> AND THAT COULD BE AN

1339
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
EXPLANATION, THAT WE ARE PART OF

1340
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
A MASSIVE COMPUTER MODEL.

1341
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
WE'RE REALLY JUST -- WHAT DID

1342
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
SPENOZA CALL HIM?

1343
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
LIKE NOADS OR SOMETHING LIKE

1344
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
THAT.
THEY GO -- AND SET INTO MOTION

1345
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
AND WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER OUR

1346
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
LIVES.

1347
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
>> Shepard: IF WE WERE TO CALL

1348
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I.T., THEY'D SAY UNPLUG IT AND

1349
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
PLUG IT BACK IN.

1350
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
MAYBE THAT WOULD FIX IT.

1351
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
SEE YOU TONIGHT AT 8:00.

1352
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
>> OUR BRAINS AND COMPUTERS

1353
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
COMBINED.

1355
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000

1356
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Silence.

1357
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,000
It's good to be IN, Good Hands.

1358
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Pcountries thatk

1359

what is your
nationality and

1360
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I would always
answer Hispanic.

1361
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So when I got my Ancestry DNA

1362
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000

1363
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm everything.

1364
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I'm from all nations.

1365
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I would look at forms
now and wonder

1366
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
what do I mark?

1367
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Because I'm everything.

1368
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And I marked other.

1379
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
FOX WENT ON TO BECOME A POWER

1380

HOUSE WITH HITS LIKE "SIMPSONS",

1381
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
"X FILES" AND "AMERICAN IDOL."

1382
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000

BABIES, LITTLE BABIES, WITH A

1394
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
CHEMICAL GAS THAT IS SO LETHAL

1395
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
THAT PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR

1396
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
WHAT GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES

1397
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
MANY, MANY LINES BEYOND A RED

1398
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
LINE.

1399
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000

A LOT OF SELLING.

1402
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
NOT EXACTLY PEGGED TO THAT, BUT

1403
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
A TRIFECTA OF TRYING EVENTS FOR

1404
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
THIS MARKET THAT HAD BEEN UP

1405
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
ABOUT 180 POINTS, FINISHING DOWN

1406
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
ABOUT 41 POINTS.

1407
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT

1408
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
SYRIA AND THE LARGE UNKNOWN

1409
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,000
AROUND THAT WAS ONE THING.
