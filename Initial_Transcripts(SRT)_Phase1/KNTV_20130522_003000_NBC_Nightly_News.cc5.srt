00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THAT TWISTER HAD SPEEDS OF MORE

188
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
THAN 300 MILES PER HOUR, DAMAGED

189
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
MORE THAN 8,000 HOMES AND KILLED

190
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
AT LEAST 36.

191
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
THAT 1999 TORNADO TOOK DON

192
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
BESSINGER'S FENCE.

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THIS ONE TOOK HIS HOME.

194
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
HE RODE OUT THE ASSAULT IN A

195
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
NEIGHBOR'S STORM SHELTER.

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU WERE

197
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
IN THERE?

198
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
COULD YOU HEAR IT?
>> IT WAS LOUD.

199
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
EVERYTHING WAS BANGING AGAINST

200
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THE DOORS AND

201
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
IT WAS THE HOUSES BREAKING APART

202
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
HITTING THE DOOR.

203
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WE THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO

204
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
FLY OFF, AND THE MASSIVE DEBRIS

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
HIT.
SO WE MADE IT TO THE CORNER OF

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THE STORM SHELTER BECAUSE WE

207
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO
LEAVE.

208
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> Reporter: TODAY HOMEOWNERS

209
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
TRICKLED BACK INTO DESTROYED

210
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
NEIGHBORHOODS STARTING WITH THE

211
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
SMALL PIECES, AS THEY CONFRONTED

212
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THE BIG TASK OF PUTTING THEIR

213
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
LIVES BACK TOGETHER.

214
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
AND WE MENTION THAT FLUCTUATING

215
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
NUMBER OF CONFIRMED DEAD.

216
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD CHANGE

217
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
AGAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL

218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
THOSE UNACCOUNTED FOR, BRIAN, AS

219
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE SEARCH GOES ON.

220
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AND THEY POINT OUT

221
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
WE COULD SEE AS MANY AS 20,000

222
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
PEOPLE DISPLACED BY ALL THIS.

223
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

224
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
AND THERE'S SO MUCH OF THIS,

225
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG HAUL

226
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THAT BEGINS WITH A GRID AND

227
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
HOUSE-BY-HOUSE SEARCHES, WHICH

228
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
HAVE NOT YET ALL BEEN COMPLETED.
LESTER HOLT STARTING OFF OUR

THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THIS

233
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
TORNADO, THEN YOU KNOW IT TOOK

234
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO FOR A KIND

235
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
OF SICK FEELING TO ARRIVE IN

236
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

237
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
WHAT ABOUT THE ELEMENTARY

238
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
SCHOOL?

239
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THERE WAS THAT DIRE FIRST REPORT

240
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
THAT UPWARDS OF 75 STUDENTS AND

241
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
FACULTY MIGHT BE TRAPPED, MIGHT

242
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
BE UNACCOUNTED FOR.

243
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
LUCKILY THOSE DIRE NUMBERS DID

244
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
NOT MATERIALIZE, BUT SADLY THERE

245
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
HAS WELL BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH

246
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
BAD NEWS TO GO AROUND AT THAT

247
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SCHOOL.

248
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
KATE SNOW HAS BEEN THERE FOR US
TODAY.

249
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
KATE, GOOD EVENING.

250
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> Reporter: BRIAN, GOOD EVENING
TO YOU.

251
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
THERE WERE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WERE
ACTUALLY IN THE DIRECT PATH OF

252
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THIS TORNADO.

253
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
ONE OF THEM, LUCKILY, HAD NO

254
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF SO
FAR.

255
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
BUT THE OTHER, AT LEAST SEVEN

256
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF,
AND THIS WAS A WEEK THAT WAS

257
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED WITH

258
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
CELEBRATION.

259
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
LAST WEEK AT SCHOOL,

260
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
GRADUATION.

261
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
TOMORROW WAS SUPERKIDS DAY AT

262
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
THE SCHOOL.
INSTEAD THEY'RE MOURNING THEIR

263
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
CLASSMATES.

264
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 500

265
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
STUDENTS WERE COUNTING DOWN THE

266
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
DAYS IN THEIR FINAL WEEK OF

267
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
CLASS, BUT IN JUST A MATTER OF

268
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
MINUTES, THEIR CAMPUS WENT

269
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
FROM LOOKING LIKE THIS TO THIS.

270
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
CLASSROOMS COMPLETELY

271
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OBLITERATED, AN AUDITORIUM CAVED

272
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
IN.
PARENTS OF OTHER STUDENTS TELL

273
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
NBC NEWS CHILDREN WERE IN THAT
AUDITORIUM.

274
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> WE'VE SEEN IT FROM THE AIR.

275
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME

276
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
AS I STEP OUT OF THE WAY, AND

277
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
LET JOE ZOOM IN.

278
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THIS IS THE FRONT OF PLAZA

279
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

280
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.

281
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
>> Reporter: IN THE HOURS AFTER

282
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THE TORNADO, DRAMATIC IMAGES,

283
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
YOUNG CHILDREN WERE RESCUED, AND

284
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
WITH DARKNESS, THE SEARCH FOR

285
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SURVIVORS CONTINUED.

286
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
SOME CHILDREN HAD ESCAPED FROM
HARM.

287
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THEIR PARENTS HAD PICKED THEM UP

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
JUST BEFORE THE SCHOOL WENT ON
LOCKDOWN MONDAY, BUT THE

289
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
MAJORITY STAYED INSIDE AS THEY

290
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
PRACTICED IN DRILLS MANY TIMES.

291
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
MATH TEACHER RHONDA CROSSWHITE

292
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
WAS HELPING HER SIXTH GRADERS

293
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WITH AN END OF SCHOOL GAME WHEN

294
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
THE PRINCIPAL CAME OVER THE

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
LOUDSPEAKER AND TOLD THEM TO GO

296
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
TO THE HALLWAY.

297
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
DAMIAN KLINE IS A FOURTH GRADER.

298
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
>> SHE TOLD US ALL TO JUST GET

299
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
YOUR MATH BOOK OR YOUR BAG.

300
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I ALREADY HAD MY BAG.

301
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THEN WE WENT IN THE HALL.

302
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> Reporter: WHY DID SHE TELL
YOU TO GET A MATH BOOK OR A BAG?

303
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> SO WE COULD PUT IT OVER OUR

304
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
HEAD.
>> Reporter: A FIFTH GRADE

305
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
TEACHER SAW THE FUNNEL CLOUD

306
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
APPROACHING AND YELLED FOR

307
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
EVERYONE TO LEAVE THE HALLWAY
AND GET INTO CLOSETS OR

308
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
BATHROOMS.
>> HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GET

309
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THEM IN THERE.

310
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I SAID, OKAY, I'LL GET THEM IN.

311
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'LL STAY OUT HERE.

312
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
HE SAID, YOU'RE GETTING IN

313
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
THERE, TOO.

314
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
>> Reporter: SHE WAS IN A

315
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
BATHROOM STALL CROUCHED OVER

316
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
FOUR CHILDREN, AND SHE DID WHAT

317
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
TEACHERS DO.

318
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
>> I REMEMBER THE LITTLE BOY
SAYING I LOVE YOU, MISS

319
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
CROSSWHITE.
PLEASE DON'T LET ME DIE WITH

320
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
YOU.

321
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.

322
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.

323
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
QUIT SAYING THAT.

324
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
AND I DID THE TEACHER THING THAT
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO

325
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
DO, I PRAYED, AND I PRAYED OUT

326
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
LOUD.

327
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?

328
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
>> I SAID, GOD PLEASE DON'T TAKE

329
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
THESE KIDS TODAY.
>> Reporter: THE CEILING CRASHED

330
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
DOWN ON THEM, BUT THE WALLS

331
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
STILL STOOD.
WHEN IT WAS QUIET AGAIN, SHE

332
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
SENT A SMALL BOY TO CLIMB UP THE

333
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
BATHROOM WALL AND LOOK OUT.

334
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
>> AND HE GOT UP THERE, AND HE

335
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
LOOKED DOWN AT ME, AND HE SAID,

336
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

337
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SAME BATHROOM CROUCHED UNDER A

SINK.

340
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HOW LOUD WAS IT?

341
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> IT WAS PRETTY LOUD.

342
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
>> Reporter: WERE YOU SCARED?

343
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
>> MM-HMM.

344
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
SCREAMING.

345
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
WE COULD HEAR THEM FROM THE

346
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
GIRLS RESTROOM.

347
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000

ANXIOUS HOUR WONDERING IF HER

349
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
LITTLE BOY WAS STILL ALIVE, AND

350
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
NOW SHE WONDERS WHY THE SCHOOL

351
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER SHELTER

352
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
PLAN.

353
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
>> WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK

354
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
EVERY SCHOOL IN

355
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
OKLAHOMA SHOULD HAVE AN
UNDERGROUND SHELTER.

356
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A TORNADO THIS

357
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
SIZE AND THIS MANY KIDS HURT,

358
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
MISSING AND LOST THEIR LIVES TO

359
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
REALIZE THAT THEY NEED

360
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
UNDERGROUND SHELTERS.

361
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
>> Reporter: IT'S ACTUALLY

362
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
REMARKABLE HOW MANY CHILDREN DID

363
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
GET OUT OF THIS SCHOOL.

364
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
AND, BRIAN, MISS CROSSWHITE WAS

365
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
TELLING US THAT THEY HAD SORT OF
A FIREMEN'S BRIGADE GOING WITH

366
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
ADULTS HELPING SOME OF THE KIDS

367
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000

WALKING OVER A BOOKCASE, USING

369
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
IT AS STAIRS AND PASS THEM ALONG

370
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
FROM ONE ADULT TO THE NEXT TO
GET THEM TO SAFETY.

371
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
BUT WE'VE BEEN TOLD HOW HORRIBLE

372
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
THE SCENE WAS WITH CHILDREN

373
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
LYING EVERYWHERE, INJURED

374
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
CHILDREN, A LOT OF PARENTS COULD

375
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
BARELY TAKE IT.

376
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> TWO ISSUES EMERGED THERE, THE

377
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
BRAVERY OF THE TEACHERS AND,

378
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
SECOND, THIS ISSUE OF WHY THERE

379
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WASN'T A SHELTER THERE.

380
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE

381
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THAT ON LATER IN THE BROADCAST.

382
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
KATE, THANKS FOR YOUR REPORTING

383
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
HERE TODAY ON THE GROUND.

384
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
>>> AGAIN, IF YOU WERE WITH US

385
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
WHEN THIS NEWS FIRST BROKE

386
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
YESTERDAY RIGHT ON THROUGH "NBC

387
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
NIGHTLY NEWS" LAST NIGHT, YOU

388
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
HEARD OUR INTERVIEW, A VERY

389
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
EARLY TENTATIVE INTERVIEW

390
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
BY PHONE WITH THE MAYOR OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

391
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
WE ASKED HIM AT THE TIME A
QUESTION SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE,

392
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?

393
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
WELL, WE'RE HAPPY TO WELCOME

394
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE WITH US

395
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
TONIGHT.

396
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR MAKING

397
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
TIME.

398
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
LET'S USE THIS HOUSE AS AN

399
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
EXAMPLE.

400
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I FOUND A PHOTOGRAPH OF TWO

401
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
YOUNG WOMEN ON THE FRONT YARD,

402
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
BUT I ALSO KNOW -- I'VE COVERED

403
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A LOT OF THESE.

404
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THIS COULD BE FROM 12 MILES

405
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
AWAY.

406
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> RIGHT.
>> THIS WOMAN IS SAID TO HAVE

407
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME.

408
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
THEY THINK SHE GOT OUT.

409
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THEY'RE NOT SURE.

410
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
THIS IS ONE HOUSE IN YOUR TOWN.

411
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?

412
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
>> PROBABLY AT THE VERY

413
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
BEGINNING WHERE IT STARTED RIGHT

414
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
BACK OVER HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS.

415
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THAT'S KIND OF GROUND ZERO.

416
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
IT ACTUALLY STARTED ACROSS THE

417
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
STREET IN OKLAHOMA CITY.

418
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY IS IN

419
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
OKLAHOMA CITY.

420
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
AND IT'S JUST AS DEVASTATED AS

421
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
PLAZA TOWERS.

422
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THEY ACTUALLY HAD MORE OF A SAFE

423
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ROOM.

424
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
PLAZA TOWERS IS ONE OF THE OLDER

425
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SCHOOLS.
THE OLDER SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE

426
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
THEM.

427
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
ALL THE NEW SCHOOLS THAT ARE

428
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
BUILT HAVE SAFE ROOMS.

429
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ONE DIDN'T.

430
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
>> WE SHOULD PROBABLY -- FOR

431
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW

432
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WE SHOULD

433
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
PROBABLY EMPHASIZE IN PLAIN
ENGLISH, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF

434
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
PEOPLE GETTING RICH HERE.

435
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
THIS IS A WORKING CLASS TOWN.
>> YES, SIR.

436
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE

437
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SCHOOLTEACHERS OR STATE
EMPLOYEES OR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.

438
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
THEY WORK FOR THE FEDERAL

439
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
GOVERNMENT USUALLY AT
TINKERFIELD OR FAA.

440
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
>> THERE IS ALMOST A FAITH-BASED

441
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
FEMA HERE IN OKLAHOMA.
THERE'S ACTUAL FEMA HERE IN

442
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
OKLAHOMA.

443
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
THERE ARE PRIVATE DONORS, AND

444
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'VE BEEN ASSURED ALL DAY THAT

445
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
SO MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LINING UP

446
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
TO TAKE CARE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE

447
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
WHO HAVE BEEN HIT.

448
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
>> YES.

449
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
>> YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT ON THAT

450
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
TO REBUILD THIS CITY YET AGAIN

451
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
AFTER '99.

452
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
>> YES, SIR.

453
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THAT IS FOR A FACT.
WE WILL REBUILD IT.

454
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE PLANS.
WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE PROCESS.

455
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
IF YOU LOOK OVER ACROSS THE

456
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
STREET AT THE HOSPITAL OVER

457
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THERE, THEY'VE STARTED TO CLEAN

458
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
UP ALREADY.

459
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
WARREN PETERS ALREADY CLEANED UP

460
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THEIR PARKING LOT.

461
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.

462
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THERE'S SO MANY TRUCKS THEY

463
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
CAN'T GET TO IT.

464
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
WE'VE STARTED THE PROCESS

465
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
ALREADY.
WE STARTED PUTTING UP STREET

466
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
SIGNS.
THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE

467
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
TO DO.
PEOPLE SAY, WHY DO YOU DO STREET

468
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
SIGNS FIRST?

469
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
IT'S LIKE YOU TAKE

470
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

471
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
INJURED, THEN YOU START PUTTING

472
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
UP THE STREET SIGNS.

473
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
>> WHY?

474
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T FIND WHERE

475
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
YOU'RE AT.

476
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
IF YOU LIVED HERE FOR 30 YEARS,

477
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STREET IS.

478
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
>> IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HOME.

479
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
>> THE HOUSE DOESN'T LOOK THE

480
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
SAME EITHER.

481
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
>> I JUST WANTED TO JOIN

482
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
EVERYBODY WATCHING WISH YOU GOOD
LUCK.

483
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH
US TONIGHT.

484
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE IN MOORE,

485
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
OKLAHOMA.

486
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
>>> NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
WEATHER EVENT THAT CAUSED ALL

487
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THIS.
WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE

488
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
WRECKAGE OF JUST ONE OF THESE
RESIDENTIAL HOMES.

489
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST

490
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
OUR OLD FRIEND JIM CANTORE IS
HERE WITH US.

491
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
JIM, YOU AND I WERE TALKING

492
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
BEFORE ABOUT A STATISTIC

493
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THAT'S STARTING TO SURFACE TODAY

494
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
THAT THE SHEER ENERGY, THE

495
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
OUTPUT OF THIS STORM EQUALED THE

496
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
BOMB IGNITED IN HIROSHIMA.

497
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
>> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

498
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
BLAST, CERTAINLY THAT IS AN

499
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
AMAZING ANALOGY.

500
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TONS OF

501
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
DEBRIS EVERYWHERE.
BRIAN, UNRECOGNIZABLE.

502
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYONE

503
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
COULD SURVIVE IN THIS.

504
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
>> NOW, SAFE ROOMS.

505
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND LET'S

506
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS REGION
NEEDS TO DO.

507
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
>> THEY DO.
I MEAN, IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT

508
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
OUR KIDS IN A HALL AND TEACH

509
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
THEM HOW TO CROUCH AND HOLD

510
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEAD, WE
HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE THAT'S NOT

511
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
GOING TO BE BLOWN APART.

512
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WE HAVE TO HAVE BUILDINGS THAT

513
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
CAN SUSTAIN THE TYPE OF DAMAGE

514
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
THAT THEY'RE USED TO HERE,

515
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
OBVIOUSLY.

516
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

517
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
200-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.

518
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND

519
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
OBVIOUSLY A BIG THING THEY NEED

520
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
TO ADDRESS.
PEOPLE'S HOMES.

521
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I WAS DOWN IN TUSCALOOSA, AS

522
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
WERE YOU, AND AFTER THE 27,
APRIL 2011 OUTBREAK, WE SAW THEM

523
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
BUILD BACK HOMES FOR $75,000

524
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
WITH SAFE ROOMS.

525
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
>> WITH SHELTERS.

526
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
>> WITH SAFE ROOMS IN THEM.

527
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
SO THIS IS NOT AN UNDOABLE

528
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
THING.

529
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
>> NOW, BRING US UP TO DATE.

530
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
WE MENTIONED SEVEN DIFFERENT

531
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
STATES HAVE WATCHES AND
WARNINGS.

532
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
TONIGHT AS WE STAND HERE

533
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
TALKING --

534
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
>> A WEEK AND A HALF AGO THE

535
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
ATMOSPHERE DECIDED

536
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
WE'RE GOING TO PULL A SWITCH,

537
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

538
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THE TORNADO DROUGHT IS OVER AND

539
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
YOU'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TONIGHT IS

540
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THUNDERSTORMS ALL THE WAY REALLY

541
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
FROM NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT ON

542
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
DOWN THROUGH TENNESSEE.

543
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
SHREVEPORT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO

544
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
FACE SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS

545
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TONIGHT, AUSTIN, TEXAS, MEMPHIS

546
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
TENNESSEE, AS WELL.

547
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
TORNADO WATCHES.
>> JIM CANTORE, THANK YOU FOR

548
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
BEING PART OF THE COVERAGE.

549

MORE WAYS THAN ONE.

561
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000

566
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THIS WEATHER IS A SURPRISE TO NO

567
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
ONE, AND FOR THE MOST PART
THEY'RE READY FOR IT WHEN IT

568
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
COMES.

569
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
BUT NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY

570
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
PEOPLE ON BOTH COASTS ARE ASKING
WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SHELTERS,

571
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
CELLARS, BASEMENTS?

572
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SAFE
HOUSES WITHIN HOUSES ACROSS THIS

573
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000

TORNADO ALLEY, AND WHY AREN'T

582

STARTED SLAMMING ON US.

588

WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE

589
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
HONEST.

SOIL, HEAVY WITH CLAY AND WATER,

593
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
MAKES ANYTHING UNDERGROUND PRONE

TO FLOODING AND MOLD.

595
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
SO MOST HOMES ARE BUILT ON A

CONCRETE SLAB.

597
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
AND MOST HOMES CAN ONLY

598
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
WITHSTAND 90-MILE-PER-HOUR

599
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
WINDS, NOT 200.

600
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000

ITSELF.

610
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000

613
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
8,000 TO $10,000 EACH.

614
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
OKLAHOMA HAS A LOTTERY TO DECIDE

615

WHO GETS STATE HELP TO PAY FOR

616
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
THEM.

617
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
LAST YEAR 500 HOMEOWNERS WERE

618
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
CHOSEN OUT OF 16,000 APPLICANTS.

SEPARATELY, THE CITY OF MOORE

620
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000

623
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
COMPLAINED THAT THE PROGRAM WAS

624
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
DELAYED BECAUSE FEMA STANDARDS

625
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000

FEMA SAYS IT'S LOOKING INTO WHAT

628
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
CAUSED THE DELAY.

629
