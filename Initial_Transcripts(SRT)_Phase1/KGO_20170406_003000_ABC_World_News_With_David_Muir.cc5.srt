THE UNITED STATES SEES

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AS A DISGRACE

186
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

187
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
AN ASSURANCE THAT HUMANITY MEANS

188
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
NOTHING TO THE SYRIAN

189
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
GOVERNMENT.

190
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS

191
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
CONSISTENTLY FAILS IN ITS DUTY

192
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
TO ACT COLLECTIVELY, THERE ARE

193
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
TIMES WHERE WE ARE COMPELLED TO

194
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.

195
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA

196
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
RADDATZ, WITH US TONIGHT.

197
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE

198
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA

199
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
HAS CHANGED.

200
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
WE JUST HEARD AMBASSADOR HALEY

201
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
SAY, AT TIMES WE'RE QUOTE,

202
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN
ACTION.

203
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
FOR AMERICANS AT HOME TONIGHT
WONDERING WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN,

204
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WHAT'S NEXT?

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
>> WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE?

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
DO THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER
ATTACKS?

207
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
DO THEY JUST WANT TO PUNISH OR

208
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
BASHAR AL ASSAD?

209
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

210
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
IN 2013, THERE WERE ARRAY OF AIR

211
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
STRIKES WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
SAID THEY CROSSED THE RED LINE.
THEY DIDN'T USE THEM.

213
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
THEY STILL HAD THAT

214
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
INTELLIGENCE.

215
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
BUT MOST OF THOSE CHEMICAL

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WEAPONS, THE STOCKPILES, ARE

217
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
GONE SO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
USED HERE WERE HIDDEN.

218
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

219
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
>> AND AS WE HEARD, THEY MET

220
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000

TODAY.

221
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000

503
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A once daily pill for adults

504
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
with moderate to severe RA

505
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
for whom methotrexate did not
work well.

506
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
XELJANZ XR can reduce pain,

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
including tuberculosis.

511
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Serious, sometimes fatal

happened.

513
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't start XELJANZ XR if you
have an infection.

517
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Your doctor should perform blood
tests before you

518
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
start and while taking XELJANZ
XR, and monitor

519
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
certain liver tests. Tell your
doctor if you were

520
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
in a region where fungal
infections are common

521
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and if you have had TB,
hepatitis B or C,

522
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
or are prone to infections.

523
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000

But for you, one pill a day may
provide symptom relief.
