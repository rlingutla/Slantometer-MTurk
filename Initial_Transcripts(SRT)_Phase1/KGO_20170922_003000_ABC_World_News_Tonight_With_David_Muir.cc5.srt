237
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AND YOUR FORECAST TAKES IT A LOT

238
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FARTHER NORTH AND INTO THE OPEN
OCEAN, AND LIKELY KEEPS IT

239
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000

WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT IT WILL GO
OUT TO SEA.

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
CERTAINLY HOPE THAT FORECAST

323
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
WHAT EXACTLY DID HE MEAN?

324
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD
HE CONSIDER TOTALLY DESTROYING

325
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
NORTH KOREA?

326
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
>> WELL, I THINK THAT'S JUST
COMMON SENSE.

DERANGED AND SAID THAT HE WILL

338
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000

AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU,

341
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
THERE'S A REAL EFFORT BY THE

TEMPERATURE DOWN HERE.

343
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000

I did.

574
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't pay for anything.

575
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You never do.

576

I mean, You did find money
to buy those boots.

579
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Are you serious?

580
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is that why
you don't like them?

581
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Those boots could
make a unicorn cry.

582
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, tears of joy.

583
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000

it can seem like triggers
pop up everywhere.

586
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Luckily there's Powerful,
24-hour, non-drowsy Claritin.

587
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It provides relief

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that can be triggered by over
200 different allergens.

597
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Before I hadburning,oting,

598
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
pins-and-needles

599
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
of diabetic nerve pain,

600
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
these feet...

601
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Grew into a free-wheeling kid...

602
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Loved every step
of fatherhood...

603
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And made old cars
good as new.

604
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But I couldn't bear

605
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
my diabetic nerve pain
any longer.

606
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So I talked to my doctor

607
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and he prescribed LYRICA.

608
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Nerve damage from diabetes

609
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
causes diabetic nerve pain.

610
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
LYRICA is FDA approved

611
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to treat this pain,

612
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
from moderate

613
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
to even severe
diabetic nerve pain.

614
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
LYRICA may cause serious
allergic reactions,

615
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
suicidal thoughts or actions.

616
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tell your doctor right away

617
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
if you have these,

618
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
new or worse depression,

619
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
unusual changes
in mood or behavior,

620
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
swelling,
trouble breathing,

621
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
rash, hives, blisters,

622
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
muscle pain with fever,

623
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
tired feeling or blurry vision.

624
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Common side effects:

625
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
dizziness, sleepiness,
weight gain,

626
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
swelling of hands,
legs, and feet.

627
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Don't drink alcohol
while taking LYRICA.

628
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't drive or use machinery

629
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
until you know how
LYRICA affects you.

630
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Those who've had a
drug or alcohol problem

631
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
may be more likely
to misuse LYRICA.

632
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Now I have less
diabetic nerve pain.

633
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And I love smoothing the road
ahead for others.

634
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Ask your doctor about LYRICA.

that's most meaningful to you.

Ask a financial advisor
about Pacific Life.

700
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
my doctor recommended I
switch laxatives.

701
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Stimulant Laxatives
make your body go

702
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
by forcefully stimulating the
nerves in your colon.

703
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
MiraLAX is different.

704
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It works with the
water in your body

705
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
to hydrate and soften.

Pneumococcal pneumonia.

711
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's a serious disease.

712
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
My doctor said the risk is
greater now that I'm over 50!

713

Yeah...ya-ha...

720
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
prevent infections from
13 strains of the bacteria that

721
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
cause pneumococcal pneumonia.

722
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You should not receive
PREVNAR 13® if you have had

723
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
a severe allergic reaction to
the vaccine or its ingredients.

724
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you have a weakened
immune system,

725
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
you may have a lower
response to the vaccine.

726
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The most common side effects
were pain, redness,

727
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and swelling at
the injection site,

728
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
limited arm movement, fatigue,

729
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
headache, muscle pain,
joint pain, less appetite,

730
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
vomiting, fever, chills,
and rash.

731
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Get this one done!

732
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Ask about PREVNAR 13®
at your next visit to your

733
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
doctor's office or pharmacy.

734
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
83% try to eat healthy,

735
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
yet up to 90% fall short
on getting key nutrients.

736
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's do more.

737
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
One-A-Day 50 plus.

738
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Complete with 100% daily value

739
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
of more than 15 key nutrients.

740
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
One-A-Day 50 plus.

741
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
with moderate to severe
rheumatoid arthritis?
How do you chase what you love

742
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Do what I did.
Ask your doctor about HUMIRA.

743
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's proven to help relieve pain
and protect joints

744
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
from further irreversible damage
in many adults.

745
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
HUMIRA works by targeting
and helping to block

746
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
a specific source
of inflammation

747
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
that contributes to RA symptoms.

748
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
HUMIRA has been clinically
studied for over 20 years.

749
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability
to fight infections,

750
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
including tuberculosis.

751
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

752
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
including lymphoma, have
happened; as have blood, liver,

753
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and nervous system problems,
serious allergic reactions,

754
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
and new or worsening
heart failure.

755
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

756
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Tell your doctor
if you've been to areas

757
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
where certain fungal infections
are common,

758
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and if you've had TB,
hepatitis B,

759
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
are prone to infections, or have
flu-like symptoms or sores.

760
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Don't start HUMIRA if
you have an infection.

761
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Ready for a new chapter?

762
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Talk to your rheumatologist
about HUMIRA.

763
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This is HUMIRA at work.

797
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
BUT WHAT HAPPENED IN ONE STADIUM
THAT SUDDENLY HAD EVERYONE

798
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
LOOKING UP.

799
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Growing up, we were German.

800
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
We danced in a German dance
group. I wore lederhosen.

801
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
When I first got on Ancestry

802
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I was really surprised that

803
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I wasn't finding all of
these Germans in my tree.

804
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I decided to have my DNA
tested through Ancestry DNA.

805
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The big surprise was
we're not German at all.

806
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
52% of my DNA comes from
Scotland and Ireland.

807
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So, I traded in my
lederhosen for a kilt.

808
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000

I tabut with my back paines,

811
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I couldn't sleep
and get up in time.

812
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Then I found Aleve PM.

813
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Aleve PM is the only one to
combine a safe sleep aid plus

814
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
the 12 hour pain relieving
strength of Aleve.

815
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm back.

816
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Aleve PM for a better AM.

(Con artists...)

818
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They'll try anything to get your
Medicare card number.

819
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So they can steal your identity,

820
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
commit Medicare Fraud.

Just like your credit card.

825
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Nobody gets my number, unless I
know they should have it.

826
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
To protect your identity,

Social Security numbers
