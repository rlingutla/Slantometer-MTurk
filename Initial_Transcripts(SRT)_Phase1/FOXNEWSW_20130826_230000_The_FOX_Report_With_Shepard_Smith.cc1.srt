JOHN, THAN THE U.N. WEAPON
INSPECTORS ARE IN SYRIA.

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
BUT U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
ALREADY MADE THEIR OWN

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
CONCLUSIONS.
>> YEAH, THEY MAY HAVE

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
DECIDED TO DO THAT JON,

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
DIFFICULTY THOSE YATIONS

80
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE

81
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
FACED IN DOING THEIR JOB

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
INSIDE SYRIA.

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
TODAY FOR INSTANCE THEIR

WEAPONS ATTACK FOR THE

88
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
FIRST TIME AND THE CONVOY

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
WAS FIRED ON BY AT LEAST

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
ONE SNIPER.

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
ONE VEHICLE WAS HIT.

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
NO INJURIES REPORTED.

93
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
AND THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS

94
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
DID THEN GO ON TO THE

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
HOSPITAL WHERE THEY

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
INTERVIEWED SOME OF THE

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
ALLEGED VICTIMS OF THE

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
ATTACK AND SOME DOCTORS WHO

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
HAD TREATED THEM.

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
BUT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

101
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
KERRY WAS QUICK TO POINT

102
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
OUT TODAY THAT THE SYRIAN

103
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

104
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ANYTHING BUT HELPFUL TO

105
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THOSE INSPECTORS.

106
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
LISTEN.

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
INSTEAD FOR FIVE DAYS THEY

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
REFUSED INVESTIGATORS TO
THE SITE OF THE ATTACK THAT

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
WOULD ALLEGEDLY EXONERATE

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THEM.
INSTEAD IT ATTACKED THE

111
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
AREA FURTHER SHELLING IT

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
AND SYSTEMATICALLY

113
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.
THAT'S NOT THE BEHAVIOR OF

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS

115
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
NOTHING TO HIDE.

116
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
>> NOW, THERE IS NO

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
INDICATION AT THIS MOMENT

118
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
WHEN THOSE UNITED NATIONS

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
INSPECTORS MIGHT LEAVE

120
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
SYRIA FOR ANYONE READING

121
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
THE TEA LEAVES THAT ACT

122
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
MIGHT BE ANOTHER IMPENDING

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
MILITARY ACTION.

124
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
DEFIANT AS EVER?

126
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000

INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THEM.

134
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IN THE INTERVIEW PRESIDENT

135
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000

139
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SPREAD OR HOW IT WILL END.

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
ASKED HOW HE BELIEVES IT

141
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000

143
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
ALL ITS WARS FROM VIETNAM

144
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
UNTIL NOW FAILURE.

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THOSE QUOTES APPEAR TO BE

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
AFFIRMATION OF WHAT WE HAVE

147
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000

APPEARS TO BE SOLELY

250
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
MOTIVATED BY THE ROBBERY

251
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000

FAMILY BELIEVES HE WAS

261
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
TARGETED FOR HIS AGE AND

262
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THE FACT THAT HE WAS JUST

263
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OVER 5 FEET TALL.

264
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
POLICE SAY HE THOUGHT BACK

265
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
AND THAT MAY HAVE

266
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEVERITY

267
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000

268
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000

HAS PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT

982
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
WITH ONE PLAN THAT WOULD

983
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
INCLUDE GROUND TROOPS,

984
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
MILLION U.S. GROUND TROOPS,

986
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS.

987
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY

988
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
OPTION THE PRESIDENT HAS

989
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000

HE WOULD NOT COMMIT U.S.

992
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
GROUND TROOPS.

993
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION

994
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000

FIRED FROM AIRPLANES THAT

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
SYRIAN RADAR.

1000
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE

1001
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
TABLE.
IT COULD VERY WELL BE ONE

1002
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
OF THE OPTIONS THE

1003
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000

FROM REPUBLICANS TO ACT.

1007
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT, JON IT WAS

1008
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
ONE YEAR AGO THIS MONTH AT

CONSEQUENCES IF THAT LINE

1020

TAKE A LISTEN.

1024
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000

STANDS BY AND DOESN'T TAKE

1026
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
VERY SERIOUS ACTION.

1027
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
NOT JUST LAUNCHING CREWS

1028
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
MISSILES, THEN AGAIN OUR

1029
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
CREDIBILITY IN THE WORLD IS

1030
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
DIMINISHED EVEN MORE IF

1031
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THERE IS ANY LEFT.

1032
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000

Max and Penny kept our bookstoreexciting

1692
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and would always me  to my rescue.

1693
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But as time passed, I stted to  notice

1694
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Max just wasn't himself.

1695
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And I knew he'd feel better if  heost

1696
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
a little weight.

1697
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
So I switched to Purina Cat ow  Healthy

1698
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Weight formula.

1699
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I just fed the recommended  amount...

1700
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And they both loved the taste.

1701
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
After a few months Max's  "speal powers"
returned...

1702
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And I got my hero back.
