      Essential for vinyl,      

345
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,226
 but maybe not for people with  
     rheumatoid arthritis.      

346
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:43,778
   Because there are options.   

347

349
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,865
  A once daily pill for adults  

350
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,517
   with moderate to severe RA   

351
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,568
     for whom methotrexate      

352
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,569
       did not work well.       

353
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:53,687
  XELJANZ XR can reduce pain,   

354
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,540
      swelling and further      
         joint damage,          

355
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,158
   even without methotrexate.   

356
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,161
   XELJANZ XR can lower your    
  ability to fight infections,  

357
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:01,712
    including tuberculosis.     

358

    Serious, sometimes fatal    
      infections, lymphoma

360
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,503
     Don't start XELJANZ XR     
   if you have an infection.    

361
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:10,254
      Tears in the stomach      
         or intestines,         

362
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:11,472
     low blood cell counts      

363
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,557

364
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,342

         have happened.         

365
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:16,877
Your doctor should perform blood
     tests before you start     

366
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,712
  and while taking XELJANZ XR,  

367
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,548
and monitor certain liver tests.

368
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,066
    Tell your doctor if you     
        were in a region        

369
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,684

           are common           

370
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:24,852
    and if you have had TB,     

371
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,070
       hepatitis B or C,

         one pill a day         

377
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,111
  may provide symptom relief.   

378
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,530
        Ask your doctor         
       about XELJANZ XR.

The rest is up to you.          

454
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,523
So think about an AARP Medicare 
Supplement Insurance Plan,      

455
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,109
insured by UnitedHealthcare     
Insurance Company.              

456
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:34,995
Like any standardized Medicare  
Supplement insurance plans,     

457
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:37,998
they help cover some of what    
Medicare doesn't pay.           

458
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:39,566
So don't wait.

REVEALED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO,

IN A MOMENT.                    

488
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,352
     Woman: We demand a lot     

489
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,753

490
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:23,787
         I should know.         

491
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,439
     I have Chronic Dry Eye     

492
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,208
       caused by reduced

493

498

        and clearer skin.       

552
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:29,296
 This is my body of proof that I
      can take on psoriatic     

553
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,298
     arthritis with HUMIRA.     

554
00:27:31,934 --> 00:27:34,952
  HUMIRA works by targeting and 
   helping to block a specific  

555
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,655
   source of inflammation that  
  contributes to both joint and 

556
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:38,939
         skin symptoms.         

557
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:42,076
   It's proven to help relieve  
pain, stop further joint damage,

558
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,661
 and clear skin in many adults. 

559
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,812
        HUMIRA is the #1        
       prescribed biologic      

560
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,781
    for psoriatic arthritis.    

561
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,950
HUMIRA can lower your ability to
        fight infections,       

562
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,001
     including tuberculosis.    

563
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,671
    Serious, sometimes fatal    
     infections and cancers,    

564
00:27:53,789 --> 00:27:55,873
    including lymphoma, have    
 happened; as have blood, liver,

565
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:57,875
  and nervous system problems,  
   serious allergic reactions,  

566
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,927
   and new or worsening heart   
            failure.            

567
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,679
Before treatment, get tested for
               TB.              

568
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:03,797
 Tell your doctor if you've been
     to areas where certain     

569
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,099
  fungal infections are common, 

570
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,667
      and if you've had TB,     
          hepatitis B,          

571
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,220
are prone to infections, or have
   flu-like symptoms or sores.  

572
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:11,605
 Don't start HUMIRA if you have 
          an infection.         

573
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:15,225
    Want more proof? Ask your   
  rheumatologist about HUMIRA.
