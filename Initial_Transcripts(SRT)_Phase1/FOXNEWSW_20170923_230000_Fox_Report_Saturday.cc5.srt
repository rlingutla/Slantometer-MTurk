DRAW ATTENTION TAKING A KNEE

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN POURING OUT

[CHEERING]

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000

THE NFL COMMISSIONER TO WEIGH

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000

BIGGEST STARS IN THE NBA FROM

SAID YESTERDAY THAT HE WAS

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
HESITANT TO GO TO THE WHITE

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
POLITICS.

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID FINE YOU

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THE ENTIRE TEAM IS NOT GOING AND

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
INSTEAD THE TEAM PUT OUT AS

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000

CELEBRATING QUALITY, DIVERSION

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
WHITE HOUSE.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
RICK: REMARKABLE STUFF AND WILL

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
HAVE MORE ON THIS IN A MINUTE.

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
PRESIDENT JUST HASN'T BEEN

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
TWEETING ABOUT SPORTS BUT ALSO

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
ABOUT HEALTHCARE AND AREA.

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
REPORTER: THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OF POLITICAL TALK AS WELL ON

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
TWITTER FROM THE PRESIDENT

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
TODAY.
IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE, YOU HAVE

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
THIS THIRD ATTEMPT FROM

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
REPUBLICANS TO REPEAL AND
REPLACE OBAMACARE AND THERE ARE

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
THREE SENATORS THAT ARE GOING TO

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
BE MAKE OR BREAK VOTE AND

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SPENT TODAY
CALLING OUT ALL THREE OF THEM ON

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
TWITTER BUT NONE MORE SO THAN

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN.
HE HAS RESERVED FOR TWEETS FOR

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
SENATOR MCCAIN TODAY AND HERE IS

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
ONE OF THEM.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THIS CAME MOMENTS AGO.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ARIZONA WERE DECEIVED 116%

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
INCREASE.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I CAN REMEMBER MCCAIN VOTED

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
AGAINST THE LAST REPUBLICAN

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
EFFORT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE
OBAMACARE BACK IN JULY AND HE

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
DID SO AGAIN JUST YESTERDAY

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
PASS THE BILL WITHOUT KNOWING

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST IN WITH

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THE CBO SCORE WAS IN WITHOUT

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
SECURING SOME KIND OF BIPARTISAN

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
SUPPORT.
AS FOR IRAN, ANOTHER TWEET FROM

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST TESTED

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
ANOTHER BALLISTIC MISSILE.

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED WITH

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
QUOTE:  SO, YOU'RE THIS

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
HAPPENING IN IRAN AND NORTH

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
KOREA THREATENING TO TEST

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
ANOTHER NUCLEAR WEAPON BUT

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
ACCORDING TO AMERICANS ON

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA THE

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THING THAT IS DOMINATING THE

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
CONVERSATION THERE IS THIS

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
GROWING FEUD BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST ATHLETES

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000

IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

127
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
AND WE WANT TO GET INTO MORE ON

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THIS NFL, NBA CONTROVERSY.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WILL GO TO LEGENDARY TV

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
SPORTSCASTER WARNER WOLF.

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TONIGHT.
>> THANK YOU, RICK.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I ALWAYS ENJOY YOUR WORK IN THE

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
FIELD FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
RICK: I APPRECIATE THAT, WARNER.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO WHAT IS

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
GOING ON BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE

138
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
AND THESE PRO SPORTS LEAGUES

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
COURSEWORK.
>> FIRST OF ALL, IT IS OKAY TO

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
PROTEST.

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THE PROBLEM IS WHERE.

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
IT IS WHERE.
YOU DON'T PROTEST USING A STAGE

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
EXPLOITING THE PLACE WHERE YOU

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
WORK.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THEY WANT TO PROTEST, FINE, GO

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
AHEAD BUT DO IT ON YOUR OWN TIME

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
AND IN YOUR OWN FACILITY.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
NOT THE STAGE AND PLATFORM WHERE

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
YOU WORK.
THESE GUYS ARE BEING PAID

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PLAY AND

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
NOT TO USE IT FOR ANOTHER

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
ASPECT.
THAT IS WRONG.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
RICK: WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
LEAGUE OF THESE KIND OF PROTESTS

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
CONTINUE?
IS THERE A RISK TO THE LEAGUE?

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE FANS.

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
IF THE FANS WALK OUT AND IT ALSO

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
DEPENDS ON THE TV RATINGS AND IF

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THEY GO DOWN, WELL, MAYBE ROGER

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
COULD OUT WILL TAKE A STAND.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
HE HAS CERTAINLY DIDN'T TODAY,

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THAT'S FOR SURE.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
RICK: BACK TO THE NBA FOR A

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
MOMENT, THE WARRIORS RELEASED A

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
STATEMENT THAT READ:  CLEARLY,

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THE TEAM IS STANDING TOGETHER ON

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THIS POINT AND REAL QUICK LEBRON

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
JAMES ALSO WEIGHED IN AMONG

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
OTHER ATHLETES AND HE CALLED THE

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
PRESIDENT A BUM.

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
HE SAID YOU BOMB, HE ALREADY

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SAID HE AIN'T GOING SO EIGHT NO

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
INVITE.
GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS AN

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
HONOR UNTIL YOU SHOWED UP.

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SPEAKING OF COURSE, ABOUT THE

177
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
PRESIDENT.
>> FIRST OF ALL, THE LAWYERS HAD

178
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THE SUPPORT OF A STEPH CURRY

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
STANDS.
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE NOT GOING.

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
IF STEPH CURRY HAD SAID HE GO,

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THEY ALL WOULD HAVE GONE.

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
IT WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
TOM BRADY DIDN'T SHOW UP WHEN

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OBAMA WAS THE PRESIDENT.

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SO WHAT?

186
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THEY ARE JUST BALLPLAYERS.

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
TO ME, THE INTERESTING AND AS

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
FAR AS BEING INVITED AND THEN

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
WITHDRAWN, IF YOU INVITED

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
SOMEONE TO A PARTY AND THEY SAID

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
WE DON'T WANT TO COME SO YOU SAY

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
DON'T COME, I'LL TAKE THE INVITE

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
BACK.

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
LOOK, WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
THE OTHER THING IS -- YEAH.

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
RICK: I HAVE TO BELIEVE ALL

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THESE YEARS OF PRESIDENTS

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
INVITING TEAMS TO THE WHITE

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
HOUSE THAT THERE WERE PLAYERS ON

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THIS TEAM THAT DIDN'T SUPPORT

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THAT PARTICULAR PRESIDENT BUT

203
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THEY SHOWED UP ANYWAY AND NOW

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
THIS THING HAS BEEN TURNED ON

205
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
ITS HEAD.

206
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> YES, TO ME, RICK, THE

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
INTERESTING THING IS THAT THE

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PLAYERS WHO DISRESPECT THE FLAG

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
AND THE INCOME THOSE ARE THE TWO

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
SYMBOLS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
TO FREE SPEECH AND DISRESPECT

212
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
AND SAY WHAT THEY WANT.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
THEY ARE STEPPING ON THE HAND

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THAT FEEDS THEM.

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I WAS IN THE SERVICE AS HUNDREDS

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE AND

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SOMEWHERE IN COMBAT, FORCE.

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
HEY, THE FLAG AND THE ANTHEM

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
WERE VERY IMPORTANT.

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THEY REPRESENTED THE COUNTRY

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
AND, AS I SAID, THE RIGHT TO

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THESE GUYS ARE COMPLAINING AND

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
THAT IS THE RIGHT TO GIVE THEM

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THE SPEECH AGAIN, TO ME, THEY

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ARE QUICK.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN A

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
PROTEST FINE, NOTHING WRONG WITH

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
THAT BUT DON'T DO IT ON MY TIME

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
IN MY PLACE.
RICK: WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000

I even accept I have a

ELIQUIS.

392

ELIQUIS reduced
the risk of stroke

393
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
better than warfarin,

394
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000

major bleeding

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000

ELIQUIS had both.

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Don't stop taking ELIQUIS

398

unless your doctor
tells you to,

399
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
as stopping increases your
risk of having a stroke.

400
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

401
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you
have an artificial heart valve

402
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
or abnormal bleeding.

403
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
While taking ELIQUIS,

404
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you may bruise more easily...

405
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
...and it may take
longer than usual

406
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
for any bleeding to stop.

407
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Seek immediate
medical care

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
for sudden signs
of bleeding,

409
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
like unusual bruising.

410
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
ELIQUIS may increase
your bleeding risk

411
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
if you take
certain medicines.

412
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Tell your doctor about

Who we paired with a Humana team
member to help address his

568
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
THREAT THAN THE VIOLENT REMARKS

569
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
SUCH AS FIRE AND FURY, TOTAL

570
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000

578
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
RICK: HOW MUCH HIGHER CAN THIS

579
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
BE RATCHETED UP?

580
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
>> ACTUALLY, YOU NO, I THINK IT

581
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
HAS BEEN RATCHETED UP FOR

582
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
DECADES.
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE IN

583
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
2017 AND AT THE UNITED NATIONS

584
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
IN HIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TALK WAS

585
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
REALLY TO MAKE CLAIM FOR THE

586
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
REST OF THE WORLD HOW DANGEROUS

587
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME HAS BEEN

588
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT WE HAVE

589
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
ALLOWED THE WORLD TO BE HIJACKED

590
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS
OF THAT REGIME AND WHAT THE US

591
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
PRESIDENT SAYING WE WILL NOT

592
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN ANYMORE, I

593
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THINK, WERE SEEN THE ERRATIC AND

594
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
DESPERATE NATURE OF THAT REGIME.

595
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
IT'S NOT RATCHETED UP MORE BUT I

596
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
THINK IT IS GETTING CLARIFIED

597
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
FOR EVERYONE HOW DANGEROUS THIS

598
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
REGIME HAS BEEN FOR A VERY LONG

599
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
TIME.
RICK: THE UN KEEPS PASSING

600
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
STRICTER AND STRICTER SANCTIONS

601
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
IN THE PRESIDENT IS SQUEEZING
THE REGIME ECONOMICALLY AND SO

602
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
FAR THAT HASN'T SEEMED TO

603
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
MATTER.
>> GIVE IT SOME TIME AND THE

604
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
NORTH KOREANS ARE USED TO THE

605
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
WORLD NOT RESPONDING TO

606
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
SANCTIONS BUT WE HAVE THE

607
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
CHINESE MORE ON BOARD THAT AT

608
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
ANY POINT DURING THIS NUCLEAR

609
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
CRISIS AND MISSILE CRISIS THEN

610
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR MANY

611
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
YEARS.
IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT.

612
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW IT AND

613
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THE PATHWAY TO DENUCLEARIZE IN

614
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
THE PENINSULA HAS TO START WITH

615
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THE ECONOMIC WEAPON.

616
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE

617
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
STATEMENT ISSUED BY SENATOR BEN

618
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
SASS IN RECENT DAYS IN WHICH HE

619
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
IS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE
BANKING SUBCOMMITTEE SAID THE

620
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
ECONOMIC WEAPON IS AN IMPORTANT

621
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
WEAPON FOR THE NORTH KOREANS AND

622
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
FOR THE CHINESE AND FOR OTHERS

623
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE DON'T WANT

624
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE IN THE

625
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
REGION.
THERE IS A KIND OF COALESCING

626
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION
BOTH IN WASHINGTON AND AMONG

627
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND THAT
WAS DEMONSTRATED AT THE UNITED

628
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
NATIONS.
RICK: SURE, BUT NORTH KOREA IS

629
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
NOW PROMISING TO TEST A HYDROGEN

630
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
BOMB OVER THE OCEAN AND IT

631
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
SAYING THAT THE PENTAGON THROUGH

632
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
BOMBERS AND JETS WELL NORTH OF

633
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
THE PENINSULA AND IT SEEMS AS IF

634
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WE ARE STILL ON A COLLISION

635
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
COURSE FOR SOME KIND OF MILITARY

636
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ACTION.

637
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
>> YES, WE DON'T WANT TO GO IN

638
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THAT DIRECTION AND WE KNOW THAT

639
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM,

640
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, HAS SAID

641
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
IT IS PREPARED FOR THE WHOLE

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
RANGE OF RESPONSES AND OUR

643
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DOES NOT

644
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
WANT TO SEE MILITARY RETALIATION

645
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
BUT WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND I

646
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE MILITARY

647
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
AND THE AGGRESSIVE MILITARY

648
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
ACTIVITY OF THE NORTH KOREAN

649
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
REGIME AND KIM JONG-UN ARE A

650
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
RESPONSE OR DUE TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

651
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THIS HAS BEEN COMING FOR A LONG

652
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
TIME.
IN FACT, WE COULD ARGUE THAT HE

653
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
HAS BEEN, HE HAS BEEN SO

654
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CONDITIONED TO A LACK OF

655
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
RESPONSE BY THE WEST IN THE

656
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
UNITED STATES THAT HE HAS GOT TO

657
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
RECALIBRATE TO THE REALITY OF A

658
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
MUCH MORE AND DEEPLY RESOLVED
REGIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND

659
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING.

660
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
RICK: EVEN IF THESE LUNCHES WERE

661
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
PLANNED, WITH ALL OF THESE

662
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
WARNINGS AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS

663
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
BEING PUT IN PLACE, WHY WOULDN'T

664
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
HE CANCEL THEM?

665
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
>> I THINK HE IS STILL TESTING,

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
FRANKLY.
HE HAS TO UNDERSTAND THAT BOTH,

667
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
IN THE ASIAN REGION AND AROUND

668
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THE WORLD, HE HAS BEEN ISOLATED

669
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
AND SEEN AS THE BIG FORCE OF

670
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
TENSION IN HIS OWN REGION, ON

671
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
THE PENINSULA OR CHINA FOR

672
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
EVERYONE.
HE'S NOT HAD TO THINK LIKE THAT

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
BEFORE.
THIS IS A REAL PARADIGM CHANGE,

674
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
BOTH FOR THE WORLD, FOR NORTH

675
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
KOREA, FOR THE CHINESE AND AN

676
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000

679
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I DON'T THINK THE LEADERSHIP IN

680
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
NORTH KOREA UNDERSTANDS THAT WE

681
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
REALLY DO MEAN BUSINESS AND

682
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
WE'VE GOT THE WORLD BEHIND US.

00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
REPEAL OBAMACARE WILL CARRY A

912
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
POLITICAL COST.

913
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
RICK: THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

914
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR BETTER

915
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
CONTROL IN MANAGEMENT IN

916
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
HEALTHCARE BUT MCCAIN IS

917
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
APPARENTLY NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO

918
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
DISAGREES WITH THAT.

919
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
>> YES, THAT IS RIGHT.
THERE IS CLEARLY SOME CONCERN.

920
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MENTIONED IN

921
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
THE REPORT THAT SENATOR FROM

922
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
ALASKA IS ON THE FENCE AND HER

923
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
GOVERNOR HAS COME OUT AGAINST

924
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
THIS BILL.

925
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
RAND PAUL, SENATOR FROM
KENTUCKY, IS AGAINST IT AND

926
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
THERE ARE CONCERNS AND BEYOND

927
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
THE POLITICAL REALM THERE ARE

928
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
CONCERNS FROM ALL KINDS OF

929
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
MEDICAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE

930
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
ALSO OPPOSED TO THIS CURRENT

931
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
PROPOSAL.
RICK: DESPITE KNOWING THAT THEY

932
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
HAVE THESE ISSUES -- AND HAVING

933
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
THE TIME TO PUT A BILL TOGETHER

934
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO

935
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
DO IT AND NOW WE ARE HEARING

936
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
FROM SENATOR MCCAIN THE RUBBLE

937
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
CAN THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO WORK

938
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
TOGETHER ON A BETTER BILL BUT WE

939
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY INDICATION THAT

940
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THAT IS REMOTELY POSSIBLE.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY CORRECT.

941
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
THERE IS NO WAY THAT DEMOCRATS

942
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
ARE GOING TO WORK FOR A FULL

943
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
REPEAL OF WHAT THEY SEE AS

944
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
PRESIDENT BUT OBAMA'S SIGNATURE

945
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
ACHIEVEMENT.
THERE MAY BE SOME TINKERING

946
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
AROUND THE EDGES BUT TO CIRCLE

947
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000

OVER THE SECOND FLOOR AND MALL

1093
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
MANAGEMENT DECIDED THEY HAD TO

1094
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
LEAVE.

1095
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
THE COUNTY POLICE WERE CALLED

1096

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
ULTIMATELY THEY WERE ZIP TIED

1100
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000

1101
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
TWENTY-TWO OF THEM ACCORDING TO

1103
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000

1107
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000

RICK.
RICK: THERE WERE ARREST LESLIE

WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

1113
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
REPORTER: IT WAS INTERESTING

1114
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
BECAUSE IT WAS THE OPPONENTS OR

1115
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
HECKLERS IF YOU WILL.
YOU CAN'T SAY OPPONENTS BECAUSE

1116
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
THERE WASN'T ANY KIND OF

1117
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
ORGANIZED OPPOSITION BUT THE

1118
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
BLACK LIFE MATTER DEMONSTRATORS

1119
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
WANT TO ST. CHARLES WHERE

1120
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
OKTOBERFEST WAS IN FULL SWING.

1121
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
A LOT OF BEER WAS BLOWING IN THE

THE OKTOBERFEST TENT.

1125
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
CLEARLY, SOME PEOPLE IN THAT

1126
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
PARTICULAR TOWN ARE TIRED OF THE

1127
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
DEMONSTRATIONS AND TIRED OF THE
VANDALISM.

1128
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SOME OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND

1129
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
STARTED THINGS LIKE BLUE LIGHTS

1130
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
MATTER, GET OUT OF OUR TOWN.

1131
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THERE WAS A PUSHING AND SHOVING

1132
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
AND THE POLICE WERE PRETTY QUICK

1133
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
TO ZIP UP THE AGITATORS WHO WERE

1134
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
OPPONENTS OF THE BLACK LIFE

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
MATTER DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHILE

1136
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
THAT WAS HAPPENING THE POLICE

1137
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
WEREN'T VERY GENTLE ABOUT IT IN

1138
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
THE BLACK LIFE MATTER

1139
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
DEMONSTRATORS SHOUTED IN SUPPORT

1140
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
OF THE POLICE.

1141
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
RICK: THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR

1142
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
DAYS.
ANY SIGN THINGS ARE COMING DOWN?

1143
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
REPORTER: IT SEEMS EVERY DAY

1144
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THERE IS A NEW DEMONSTRATION.

1145
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
AT SOME POINT THESE
DEMONSTRATIONS WILL CROSS THE

1146
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
LINE AND THE POLICE WILL SHUT

1147
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THEM DOWN AND IT'S A MATTER OF

1148
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
JUST HOW OUT OF HAND THESE

1149
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
THINGS GET OR CROSS THE LINE.

1150
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
LIKE THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR,

1151
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
THEY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED AND IT

1152
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE ARE MILLING
AWAY.

1153
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
RICK: MICAH TOBIN, WE APPRECIATE

1154
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000

A DIRE CRISIS GROWING IN PUERTO

1155
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA

1156
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
DEVASTATING THAT ISLAND LEAVING

1157
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
MILLIONS WITHOUT POWER AND NOW

1158
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
OFFICIALS ARE RACING AGAINST THE

1159
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
CLOCK TO SAVE RESIDENCE FROM A

1160
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
FAILING DAM.

1161
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
PLUS, WE ARE TRACKING HURRICANE

1162
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
MARIA'S DEADLY PATH AND WE WILL

1163
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
TELL YOU WHERE THE STORM IS

1164
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
HEADED NEXT.

1165
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
th.

1166
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It could save your life.

1167
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Cigna. Together, all the way.

1168
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It could save your life.

1169
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and life's beautiful moments.ns
get between you

1170
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Flonase outperforms the #1
non-drowsy allergy pill.

1171
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It helps block 6 key
inflammatory substances

1172
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
that cause symptoms.

1173
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Pills block one

1174
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and 6 is greater than 1.

1175
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Flonase changes
everything.

1176
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm lucky to get through a
shift without a disaster.

1177
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Heads up!

1178
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
You know what, don't
worry about it.

1179
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
My bargain detergent
couldn't keep up.

1180
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It was mostly water.

1181
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So, I switched to Tide PODs.

1182
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
They're super concentrated,
so I get a better clean.

1183
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I mean, I give away
water for free.

1184
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm not about to pay for
it in my detergent.

1185
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Number one trusted.
Number one awarded.

1186
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's got to be Tide

1187
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Endless Shrimp is back

1188
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
at Red Lobster.

1189
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
And we went all out

1190
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
to bring you even more
incredible shrimp

1191
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
and new flavors.

1192
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Like new
Nashville Hot Shrimp,

1193
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
drizzled with
sweet amber honey,

1194
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and new grilled
Mediterranean Shrimp

1195
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
finished with a savory blend

1196
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
of green onions,
tomatoes, and herbs.

1197
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Feeling hungry yet?

1198
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Good, 'cause there's plenty
more where these came from.

1199
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Like Garlic Shrimp Scampi,

1200
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
and other classics you love.

1201
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
As much as you want,
however you want them.

1202
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But hurry, Endless Shrimp
won't be here long.

1203
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
83% try to eat healthy,
however you want them.

1204
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
yet up to 90% fall short
on getting key nutrients.

1205
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Let's do more.

1206
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
One-A-Day 50 plus.

1207
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Complete with 100% daily value

1208
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
of more than 15 key nutrients.

1209
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
One-A-Day 50 plus.

1210
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Upeace of mind.s

1211
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
We had a power outage
for five days total.

1212
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
We lost a lot of food.

1213
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
We actually filed
a claim with USAA

1214
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
to replace that spoiled food.

1215
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And we really appreciated that

1216
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We're the Webber family and

1217
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
we are USAA members for life.

1218
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE TO
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,

1219
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
DOES PSORIASIS EVER GET IN
THE WAY OF A TOUCHING MOMENT?

1220
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
IF YOU HAVE MODERATE TO SEVERE
PSORIASIS, YOU CAN EMBRACE

1221
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
THE CHANCE OF COMPLETELY
CLEAR SKIN WITH TALTZ.

1222
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
TALTZ IS PROVEN TO GIVE YOU A
CHANCE AT COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

1223
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
WITH TALTZ, UP TO
90% OF PATIENTS

1224
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
OF THEIR PSORIASIS PLAQUES.

1225
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
IN FACT, 4 OUT OF 10 EVEN
ACHIEVED COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

1226
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO TALTZ.

1227
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
BEFORE STARTING YOU
SHOULD BE CHECKED
FOR TUBERCULOSIS.

1228
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
TALTZ MAY INCREASE YOUR
RISK OF INFECTIONS

1229
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
AND LOWER YOUR ABILITY
TO FIGHT THEM.

1230
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
YOU ARE BEING TREATED

1231
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
FOR AN INFECTION
OR HAVE SYMPTOMS.

1232
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
OR IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED
A VACCINE OR PLAN TO.

1233
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
CAN HAPPEN WITH TALTZ.

1234
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
INCLUDING WORSENING OF SYMPTOMS.

1235
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
SERIOUS ALLERGIC
REACTIONS CAN OCCUR.

1236
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE AT
COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

1237
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,000
JUST ASK YOUR
DOCTOR ABOUT TALTZ.

1238
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
RICK: NEARLY THE ENTIRE ISLAND

OFFICIALS SAY THE DAM IS ON THE

VERGE OF COLLAPSE UNABLE TO

HANDLE THE WEIGHT OF THOSE HEAVY

1249
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000

BAD SITUATION COULD GET MUCH

00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
WORSE SOON.

1256
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS THAT THE

1257
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
MAJOR DAM COULD BREAK.

1258
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
THERE IS ALREADY 15-20 FEET OF

00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
FLOODING AND THEY HAVE EVACUATED

1260

70000 PEOPLE IN FEAR THAT THIS

1261
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
