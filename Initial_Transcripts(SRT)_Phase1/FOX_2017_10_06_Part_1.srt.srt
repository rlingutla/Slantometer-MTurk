1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:07,339
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DROPPED   
AND WORK FORCE IS AT A 3 1/2    

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,375
YEAR HIGH.                      
THIS UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR   

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,745
CONGRESS TO WORK WITH US TO GROW
THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS.    

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,349
THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING TAX   
RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND 

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:20,786
BUSINESS CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.  
WE HAVE A ONCE IN A GENERATION  

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,290
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A TAX CODE
THAT IS SIMPLE, FAIR AND EASY TO

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:30,763
UNDERSTAND.                     
THAT MEANS GETTING RID OF THE   

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:36,001
LOOP HOLES THAT BENEFIT THE     
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND        

9
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,738
LOWERING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE    
AMERICANS AND BUY THE GREAT     

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,875
PRODUCTS MADE BY AMERICAN       
MANUFACTURERS.                  

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,879
TODAY THE PRESIDENT SIGNED A    
PROCLAMATION DECLARING OCTOBER 6

12
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,248
NATIONAL MANUFACTURING DAY.     
THIS HONORS THE MEN AND WOMEN   

13
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:53,385
THAT CREATE THE PRODUCTS THAT   
POWER OUR COMMUNITIES, IMPROVE  

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,955
OUR LIVES AND DEFEND OUR NATION.
THE PEOPLE WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,691
SAYS BELIEVE IN THOSE BEAUTIFUL 
WORDS "MADE IN THE U.S.A."      

16
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,028
IN ADDITION TO THE 14 WORKERS   
THE PRESIDENT HOSTED IN THE OVAL

17
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:07,366
OFFICE DURING TODAY'S           
PROCLAMATION SIGNING, MORE THAN 

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,235
500,000 PEOPLE AROUND THE       
COUNTRY ARE PARTICIPATING IN    

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,005
THOUSANDS OF EVENTS RELATED TO  
MANUFACTURING DAY.              

20
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:20,813
AMONG THEM, NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF 
THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET AND     

21
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,348
OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS.         
OUR TAX PLAN WOULD LEAD TO A    

22
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,052
GREAT MANUFACTURING BOON.       
WE WOULD CUT TAXES ON BUSINESSES

23
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:30,823
OF ALL SIZES AND RESTORE THEIR  
COMPETITIVE EDGE TO CREATE MORE 

24
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,794
JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES FOR OUR   
WORKERS.                        

25
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,298
OUR PLAN WOULD ALLOW THEM TO    
BRING BACK TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

26
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,499
OVERSEAS.                       
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE BACK OUT  

27
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,268
ON THE ROAD BUILDING SUPPORT FOR
THIS PLAN, WHICH IS REALLY A    

28
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,870
JOBS BILL.                      
HE WILL BE IN PENNSYLVANIA      

29
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,807
MONDAY AND WE'LL HAVE MORE      
DETAILS COMING SOON.            

30
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:55,814
WITH THAT, WE'LL KICKOFF FRIDAY 
WITH QUESTIONS.                 

31
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,550
WE'LL START NOW IS.             
KIND OF FUN.                    

32
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,920
WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN AND
NOT JUST SAVE IT FOR FRIDAYS.   

33
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,256
JOHN DECKER.                    
>> THANK YOU, SARAH.            

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,495
THE BODY OF ANOTHER U.S. SOLDIER
HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED BY     

35
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:16,068
LOCAL FORCES IN NIGER WHICH     
BRINGS TO FOUR THE TOTAL NUMBER 

36
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,806
OF GREEN BERETS THAT WERE KILLED
WEDNESDAY IN NIGER.             

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,209
SO FAR THERE'S NO RESPONSE TO   
THIS BY THE PRESIDENT, NO TWEET 

38
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:29,248
FROM THE PRESIDENT, NO STATEMENT
FROM THE PRESIDENT.             

39
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:33,352
CAN WE EXPECT SOME SORT OF      
REPRISAL BY THE U.S. MILITARY IN

40
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,355
NIGER AS RELATES TO WHAT        
HAPPENED WEDNESDAY?             

41
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,592
>> I MADE A STATEMENT ON BEHALF 
OF THE ADMINISTRATION YESTERDAY 

42
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:44,463
IN THE OPENING.                 
OBVIOUSLY ANY TIME ONE OF THE   

43
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:50,969
MEMBERS OF OUR GREAT MILITARY   
ARE INJURED, WOUNDED OR KILLED  

44
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:57,876
IN ACTION, THAT IT'S CERTAINLY  
SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY     

45
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,778
SERIOUSLY.                      
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE    

46
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,713
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS.         
WE'RE CONTINUING TO REVIEW AND  

47
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,950
LOOK INTO THIS.                 
AS WE HAVE MORE DETAILS, WE'LL  

48
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,585
LET YOU KNOW.                   
CECILIA?                        

49
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,520
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY THE          
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS?           

50
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,357
WAS HE REFERRING TO MILITARY    
ACTION WHEN HE SAID "CALM BEFORE

51
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,194
THE STORM?"                     
>> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,

52
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,264
THE PRESIDENT HAS AS I HAVE FROM
THIS PODIUM ON QUITE A FEW      

53
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,701
OCCASIONS, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO 
SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT THE         

54
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,304
PRESIDENT WILL DO.              
AS HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN        

55
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,840
ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS, YOU'LL
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.           

56
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,779
>> HOW SERIOUSLY SHOULD AMERICAN
ADVERSARIES FOR THAT MATTER TAKE

57
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:37,516
THESE COMMENTS?                 
>> I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE     

58
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,519
PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE        
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY

59
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,387
SERIOUS.                        
HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S

60
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:45,891
HIS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY.          
IF HE FEELS THAT ACTION IS      

61
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,993
NECESSARY, HE WILL TAKE IT.     
STEVE?                          

62
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,862
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID HE   
WANTS HIS MILITARY LEADERS TO   

63
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:54,132
GIVE THEM MILITARY OPTIONS      
FASTER, DOES HE FEELS LIKE      

64
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,569
THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY           
SLOW-WALKING THESE OPTIONS TO   

65
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,338
HIM?                            
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.              

66
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,709
AS YOU KNOW, HE'S A PERSON THAT 
LIKES TO TAKE ACTION AND TAKE IT

67
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,812
QUICKLY.                        
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD READ   

68
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,816
INTO ANYTHING BEYOND THAT.      
HE WANTS OPTIONS ON THE TABLE SO

69
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,153
HE CAN MAKE QUICK DECISIONS.    
>> IS THAT A GENERAL COMMENT OR 

70
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:19,324
DID HE MEAN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY? 
>> A GENERAL COMMENT.           

71
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,760
NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT WAS IN    
REFERENCE TO.                   

72
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,497
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.        
ONE ON THE SOLDIER THAT WAS     

73
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,533
KILLED IN NIGER AND THE OTHER ON
DACA.                           

74
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,536
WHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT MADE     
AWARE THERE WAS A FOURTH SOLDIER

75
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,439
MISSING IN ACTION?              
WHEN DID HE BECOME AWARE THAT   

76
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,876
THAT SOLDIER HAD BEEN KILLED AND
DISCOVERED BY LOCAL FORCES?     

77
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,711
>> I BELIEVE THE NOTIFICATION   
WAS YESTERDAY.                  

78
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,282
I'D HAVE TO GET CLARIFICATION ON
THE SPECIFIC TIMING OF WHEN THAT

79
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,050
TOOK PLACE.                     
>> WHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT MADE  

80
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,387
AWARE THAT THAT SOLDIER'S BODY  
WAS FOUND?                      

81
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:55,093
AGAIN, I KNOW THAT IT WAS PRETTY
SOON AFTER THAT HAD BEEN        

82
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,496
DISCOVERED.                     
AS FAR AS AN EXACT TIME, I CAN'T

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,732
GIVE YOU THAT.                  
I KNOW CHIEF KELLY KEPT HIM     

84
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,201
UPDATED ON THAT SITUATION AS IT 
EVOLVED.                        

85
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,505
>> AND ON DACA, THE PRESIDENT   
WELCOMED HISPANIC AMERICAN      

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,108
LEADERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE.     
HE DID NOT MENTION HIS POSITION 

87
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,578
TO END DACA DURING HIS REMARKS  
THERE.                          

88
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,616
HE DID NOT RENEW HIS CALL FOR   
CONGRESS TO PROTECT THOSE THAT  

89
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,085
WILL BE VULNERABLE FOR          
DEPORTATION IN MARCH.           

90
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,756
WHY DID HE NOT BRING THAT UP?   
>> LOOK, HE'S BEEN CLEAR.       

91
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,926
THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE TO
REITERATE THE SAME POSITION THAT

92
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,961
HE'S HELD.                      
HE CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ACT ON 

93
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,531
IT.                             
YOU CAN EXPECT IN THE COMING    

94
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,668
DAYS THAT HE WILL LAY OUT HIS   
RESPONSIBLE IMMIGRATION REFORM. 

95
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:43,475
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT TO HAPPEN 
VERY SOON.                      

96
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,710
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE PROCESS  
MOVING FORWARD.                 

97
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,612
HE HASN'T BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT    
WHAT HIS POSITION IS ON THAT    

98
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:48,480
FRONT.                          
APRIL?                          

99
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:55,487
>> SARAH, GOING BACK TO THE CALM
BEFORE THE STORM, WHEN THE      

100
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,724
PRESIDENT DEALS WITH WORLD      
MATTERS LIKE THIS, ALL OPTIONS  

101
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:05,664
ARE ON THE TABLE.               
HAS THIS WHITE HOUSE EXHAUSTED  

102
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,432
DIPLOMACY?                      
FOR HIM TO SAY THE CALM BEFORE  

103
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,068
THE STORM, LISTENING TO WHAT HE 
HAD TO SAY.                     

104
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,171
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUT      
MAXIMUM ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC 

105
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,073
PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH
KOREA.                          

106
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,376
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO   
THAT.                           

107
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,145
AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT 
WILL KEEP ALL OF HIS OPTIONS ON 

108
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,281
THE TABLE.                      
OUR POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED.   

109
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,717
IT'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT.      
>> IS NORTH KOREA THE STORM?    

110
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,421
>> THAT'S AN EXAMPLE.           
WE HAVE A LOT OF BAD ACTORS.    

111
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:35,394
NORTH KOREA, IRAN.              
SEVERAL EXAMPLE THERE'S.        

112
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,130
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE  
CONTRACEPTION WAIVER.           

113
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:45,404
THE ACLU ANNOUNCED A LAWSUIT.   
THEY SAID THE TRUMP             

114
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,808
ADMINISTRATION IS PAYING FOR    
WOMEN TO PAY FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS

115
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,978
BELIEFS.                        
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT   

116
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:58,750
AUTHORIZE DISCRIMINATION IN THE 
NAME OF RELIGION OR OTHERWISE.  

117
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,455
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE?          
>> I WOULD NEVER GET THE ACLU TO

118
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:07,793
TAKE ANY OF MY TALKING POINTS.  
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THE      

119
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,930
REASON TO PRACTICE ONE'S FAITH  
IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS  

120
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,099
COUNTRY.                        
THAT'S ALL TODAY WAS ABOUT.     

121
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,268
OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD   
PROTECT THAT RIGHT.             

122
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,004
AS LONG AS DONALD TRUMP IS      
PRESIDENT, HE WILL.             

123
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:23,275
>> FOR THE ACLU, WHAT WOULD YOU 
SAY TO THE WOMEN OUT THERE OR   

124
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,878
THE FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT NOW 
HAVE TO PAY MORE OUT OF THEIR   

125
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,849
POCKET TO GET CONTRACEPTION     
COVERAGE THAT THEY CHOOSE AND   

126
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,286
THAT THEY DESIRE?               
>> THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT     

127
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,355
SUPPORTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT,   
SUPPORTS THE FREEDOM OF         

128
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,490
RELIGION.                       
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT     

129
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:44,129
SHOULD BE AN ISSUE.             
THE SUPREME COURT HAS VALIDATED 

130
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,098
THIS DECISION ON MANY TIMES     
OVER.                           

131
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,535
THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEBODY THAT  
BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION.   

132
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,674
IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHAT THE   
CONSTITUTION SAYS, TALK TO      

133
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:02,914
CONGRESS ABOUT CHANGING IT.     
>> GIVEN THE LAWSUITS THAT THE  

134
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,784
ACLU HAS FIRED, IS THE          
ADMINISTRATION PREPARED TO      

135
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,119
DEFENSE THIS CONTRACEPTION      
MANDATE BACK TO THE SUPREME     

136
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,322
COURT IF NEED BE?               
>> THE SUPREME COURT MADE CLEAR 

137
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,391
WHAT THE POSITION IS.           
IT SUPPORT WHAT'S THIS          

138
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,494
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE.        
>> BUT THIS WILL BE A LEGAL     

139
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,029
FIGHT --                        
>> IF IT DOES, IT SHOWS THAT    

140
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,499
THIS STRAIGHT IS ON THE RIGHT   
SIDE OF THE LAW.                

141
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,467
>> AND ON THE CALM BEFORE THE   
STORM ISSUE.                    

142
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,603
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO          
PRESERVE --                     

143
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,372
>> AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ASK THE 
SAME QUESTION.                  

144
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,242
>> IT'S A FOLLOW UP.            
YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO 

145
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,745
PRESERVE AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
IF HE WANTS TO PRESERVE AN      

146
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,915
ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, WHY WOULD  
HE DANGLE HINTS ABOUT HIS       

147
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:42,287
ACTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.     
>> I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID.      

148
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,323
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY        
SPECIFIC ACTIONS AT ALL.        

149
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,191
MATTHEW?                        
>> TWO QUESTIONS.               

150
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,094
FIRST FOLLOWING UP ON THE HHS   
CHANGE.                         

151
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,631
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE ANY   
ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE    

152
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,633
COULD LOSE ACCESS TO BIRTH      
CONTROL UNDER THIS CHANGE?      

153
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,169
>> I'M NOT AWARE.               
I'D REFER YOU TO HHS FOR        

154
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,739
                                
SPECIFICS.                      

155
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,441
>> THE PRESIDENT REPEATED       
EARLIER TODAY THAT THE U.S. IS  

156
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,143
THE HIGHEST TAX NATION IN THE   
WORLD.                          

157
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,079
IT'S NOT TRUE.                  
SO WHY DOES HE KEEP MAKING THAT 

158
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,048
STATEMENT?                      
WHY DOES HE STICK TO THAT       

159
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,217
TALKING POINT?                  
>> THERE ARE SPECIFIC SECTORS IN

160
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,087
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE AMONG THE  
HIGHEST TAXED IN THE WORLD AND  

161
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,258
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT  
DATA.                           

162
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:28,433
JOHN?                           
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS, SARAH. 

163
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,770
THERE'S RUMORS THAT PRIME       
MINISTER SABRIS WILL COME HERE  

164
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,040
ON THE 17th, MEET WITH THE      
PRESIDENT AND THEN MEET WITH THE

165
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,776
VICE PRESIDENT ON THE 18th.     
WE'VE HAD NO CONFIRMATION.      

166
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,546
IS THE PRIME MINISTER INVITED   
AND IS HE COMING TO MEET THE    

167
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,214
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT?   
>> HE IS.                       

168
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,551
I BELIEVE THAT DATE IS CORRECT. 
THE 17th, I BELIEVE, THAT HE    

169
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:53,391
WILL BE HERE.                   
>> THE OTHER THING, THE         

170
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:57,295
ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD A VACANCY
WITHOUT A PERMANENT SECRETARY OF

171
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,498
HOMELAND SECURITY FOR TWO       
MONTHS, WHICH IS A RECORD FOR   

172
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,436
THAT POSITION NOT OPERATING WITH
A PERMANENT SECRETARY.          

173
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,641
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE AN         
ANNOUNCEMENT ON A CHOICE FOR    

174
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,777
PERMANENT SECRETARY WITHIN DAYS 
NEXT WEEK PERHAPS?              

175
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:18,216
AND RUMORS ARE CONSISTENT, HE   
WILL MAKE ELAINE DUKE THE       

176
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,818
PERMANENT SECRETARY.            
TRUE OR FALSE?                  

177
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,121
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
ANY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE       

178
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,358
PRESIDENT MAY MAKE ABOUT A      
PERMANENT PERSON.               

179
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:34,165
I WILL SAY ACTING SECRETARY DUKE
IS VERY COMPETENT, HAS MANAGED  

180
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,803
THE DEPARTMENT WELL IN A TOUGH  
AND TRYING TIME GIVEN THE       

181
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,072
HURRICANE SEASON WE'VE HAD AND  
CERTAINLY HAVE NOT WANTED TO    

182
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,342
MAKE BIG SHIFTS IN LEADERSHIP   
DURING THIS TIME.               

183
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,512
WHILE THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON  
THERE, IN TERMS OF A TIMETABLE, 

184
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,683
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED WHEN WE   
HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.           

185
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,620
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID    
ABOUT SECRETARY DUKE, THE       

186
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,756
TESTIMONY YOU GAVE AS THE       
PRESIDENT'S OPINION OF HER AS   

187
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,723
WELL.                           
>> YES.                         

188
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:03,161
HE'S HAPPY WITH THE JOB THAT    
SHE'S DONE AS THE ACTING        

189
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,401
SECRETARY.                      
>> SENAOR CORNYN SAID THE       

190
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,438
IMMIGRATION PRINCIPLES WOULD BE 
HARMFUL TO DACA.                

191
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,007
DACA SHOULD BE KEPT SEPARATE    
ABOUT ANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.  

192
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,009
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE'S       
RESPONSE TO THAT?               

193
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,847
ARE YOU GUYS COMMITTED TO       
ATTACHING LEGAL IMMIGRATION TO  

194
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,184
THE DACA DEBATE?                
>> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER

195
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,254
WE PUT FORWARD IS A RESPONSIBLE 
IMMIGRATION REFORM AND NOT ONE  

196
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,623
PIECE OF THIS PROCESS DEALT WITH
SEPARATELY.                     

197
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,459
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE 
ADDRESSING ALL THE PROBLEMS SO  

198
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,029
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THIS     
AGAIN IN TWO, FOUR, FIVE, SIX   

199
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:42,667
YEARS BUT PUTTING FORWARD A VERY
THOROUGH AND FULL PLAN.         

200
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,870
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE COMING   
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IN VERY 

201
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,005
SHORT ORDER.                    
FRED?                           

202
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,443
>> THANK YOU, SARAH.            
TWO WEEKS.                      

203
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:58,149
FIRST, THERE'S A VIEW ON PAYDAY 
LENDING.                        

204
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:03,988
>> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.       
>> JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT    

205
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,524
TOPIC.                          
THERE'S BEEN SOME HOUSE         

206
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:10,895
REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE THAT    
THERE'S ALREADY CAUSE FOR FIRING

207
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,532
RICHARD.                        
GOING BACK TO HIS HANDLING OF   

208
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,303
THE WELLS FARGO CASE.           
WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT -- HAS 

209
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:21,072
HE APPROVED OF THE JOB HE'S DONE
SO FAR?                         

210
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:24,743
>> WHEN WE HAVE PERSONNEL       
ANNOUNCEMENTS, WE'LL KEEP YOU   

211
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,643
POSTED.                         
THAT'S TWO ALREADY.             

212
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,780
I'M MOVING ON.                  
MARGARET?                       

213
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,650
>> TWO QUICK QUESTIONS.         
THERE'S BEEN SOME RUMORS ABOUT  

214
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,686
THE FUTURE OF SECRETARY REX     
TILLERSON TODAY.                

215
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,455
CAN YOU CONTINUE TO SAY THE     
PRESIDENT REMAINS CONFIDENT IN  

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,891
HIM AS SECRETARY OF STATE?      
>> HE DOES.                     

217
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,262
AS HE SAID YESTERDAY OR TWO DAYS
AGO AS I SAID YESTERDAY, NOTHING

218
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,600
HAS CHANGED DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY
READ IN THE MEDIA OR WATCH ON   

219
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,669
TV.                             
I WOULD CERTAINLY TRUST THE     

220
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:55,039
PRESIDENT IN MY COMMENTS FAR    
ABOVE THOSE OF OTHER REPORTERS. 

221
00:12:55,174 --> 00:13:04,682
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, THE       
PRESIDENT CAN MOVE MARKETS,     

222
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:14,826
CAUSE MISCALCULATIONS.          
YOU MENTIONED NORTH KOREA, IRAN 

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,631
WITH CALM BEFORE THE STORM.     
AN IMPLICATION THAT THERE'S SOME

224
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,433
SORT OF FORECASTING OF A        
MILITARY ACTION.                

225
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,503
CAN YOU CLARIFY IF WE'RE        
INTERPRETING THINGS CORRECTLY?  

226
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,772
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN SPECIFIC ABOUT
ANYTHING.                       

227
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,542
I'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT 
THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUT    

228
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,412
MAXIMUM ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC 
PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH

229
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,148
KOREA.                          
I'M SAYING THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE 

230
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,251
ON THE TABLE AS THEY HAVE BEEN  
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANNOUNCE 

231
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,021
WHAT ACTIONS WE'LL BE TAKING    
UNTIL THAT MOMENT COMES.        

232
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,492
>> WHY DID HE SAY THAT?         
>> CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC     

233
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,862
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING OPEN  
TO LEGISLATION BANNING BUMP     

234
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,630
STOCKS?                         
>> AS I SAID YESTERDAY, WE WANT 

235
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,333
TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.
WE WANT MORE INFORMATION.       

236
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:59,270
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO   
THAT OVER THE COMING DAYS.      

237
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,407
THAT'S THE CURRENT POSITION.    
HASN'T CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY. 

238
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,376
>> THANK YOU, SARAH.            
TWO QUESTIONS IF I CAN.         

239
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,380
>> WHY NOT?                     
>> I ASKED YOU ABOUT SENATOR    

240
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,481
CORKER.                         
>> JUST NOT THREE.              

241
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,051
>> JUST TWO.                    
I ASKED YOU ABOUT SENATOR CORKER

242
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,788
AND THE COMMENTS HE MADE A FEW  
WEEKS BACK.                     

243
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,791
EARLIER THIS WEEK HE SAID THAT  
SECRETARY TILLERSON, MATTIS AND 

244
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,194
KELLY ARE BASICALLY WHAT IS     
KEEPING THE COUNTRY SEPARATED   

245
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,599
FROM CHAOS AND HE SAID THERE'S  
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE 

246
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:33,304
THAT AREN'T PUTTING FORTH       
POLICIES IN A COHERENT FASHION. 

247
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,940
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE?       
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS THE 

248
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,977
ONE THAT IS KEEPING THE WORLD   
FROM CHAOS.                     

249
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,914
HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE TEAM AROUND
HIM HELPING LEAD THAT EFFORT.   

250
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,652
HE'S HAD TREMENDOUS             
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE          

251
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,688
INTERNATIONAL STAGE BY WORKING  
WITH ALLIES AND CONFRONTING     

252
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,257
ENEMIES.                        
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO   

253
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:57,328
THAT WITH THE TEAM AS THE       
PRESIDENT LEADING THAT EFFORT.  

254
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:02,600
>> IS GENERAL KELLY --          
>> I'M COME BACK.               

255
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,204
>> GETTING BACK TO THE CALM     
BEFORE THE STORM COMMENTS.      

256
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,240
THERE'S A THEORY IN WASHINGTON  
AND FORGIVE ME IF YOU'VE BEEN   

257
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:14,212
ASKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SUBSCRIBES TO THIS MAD

258
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:19,050
MAN THEORY, THAT IF HE MAKES A  
LOT OF UNSETTLING OFF-PUTTING   

259
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,587
COMMENTS THAT SORT OF THROW     
PEOPLE OFF, THAT HE LIKES TO    

260
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:26,824
KEEP HIS ADVERSARIES GUESSING.  
THAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING      

261
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,294
COMMENTS LIKE CALM BEFORE THE   
STORM AND SO FORTH.             

262
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,164
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF THAT?     
IS THERE ANYTHING TO THAT?      

263
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,134
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT        
ADDRESSED THIS HIMSELF.         

264
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:43,274
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LAY OUT HIS  
GAME PLAN FOR OUR ENEENEMIES.   

265
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,979
IF YOU'RE ASKING, IS THE        
PRESIDENT TRYING TO DO THAT?    

266
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,514
ABSOLUTELY.                     
>> HE'S TRYING TO THROW PEOPLE  

267
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,182
OFF?                            
>> I WON'T SAY HE'S TRYING TO   

268
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,886
THROW PEOPLE OFF BUT HE'S NOT   
TRYING TO BROADCAST OR TELEGRAPH

269
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,089
HIS EXACT ACTIONS.              
I THINK WE'VE SEEN WHAT A       

270
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,924
FAILURE IT IS WHEN AN           
ADMINISTRATION DOES THAT AND    

271
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,860
THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT WILL DO
IT DIFFERENTLY AND DO IT BETTER.

272
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,564
>> JUST A FOLLOW UP.            
SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE -- THEY SORT 

273
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,434
OF CATCH THEIR BREATH IN THIS   
TOWN, WHEN THEY SORT OF HOLD    

274
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,271
THEIR BREATH IN THIS TOWN, WHEN 
HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU

275
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,974
HAVE A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.      
IS THAT SOMEWHAT SATISFY        

276
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:16,708
SOMETHING.                      
>> NO.                          

277
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,978
I PICTURE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN   
HOLDING THEIR BREATH.           

278
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,080
THAT MIGHT BE A WELCOME SURPRISE
FOR MOST OF AMERICA.            

279
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:25,216
GO AHEAD.                       
>> SARAH, ONE MORE THING TO PICK

280
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,719
UP ON WHAT MARGARET WAS TRYING  
TO GET AT.                      

281
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,755
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY.  
CAN YOU EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY 

282
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,425
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ACTUALLY 
JUST BEING MISCHIEVOUS?         

283
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,228
THAT HE WAS MESSING WITH THE    
PRESS A LITTLE BIT WHEN HE MADE 

284
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,731
THAT COMMENT.                   
>> I WOULDN'T SAY HE'S MESSING  

285
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,868
WITH THE PRESS.                 
I SAY WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS WORLD

286
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,471
ISSUES HERE.                    
I THINK NORTH KOREA, IRAN BOTH  

287
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,273
CONTINUE TO BE BAD ACTORS AND   
THE PRESIDENT IS SOMETHING THAT 

288
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,477
WILL ALWAYS LOOK FOR WAYS TO    
PROTECT AMERICANS.              

289
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,280
HE'S NOT GOING TO DICTATE WHAT  
THOSE ACTIONS MAY LOOK LIKE.    

290
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,816
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING  
BEYOND THAT THAT I CAN ADD ON   

291
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,719
THAT FRONT.                     
>> AND ANOTHER QUESTION ON IRAN.

292
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:08,359
A COUPLE DAYS AGO SENATOR TOM   
COTTON GAVE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE

293
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:14,132
SAYS THEY BELIEVES THE BEST     
OUTCOME WOULD BE TO HAVE        

294
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:19,103
CONGRESS REIMPOSE SANCTIONS.    
WE WOULD USE THIS PERIOD OF 120,

295
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,940
90 DAYS TO RENEGOTIATE SEVERAL  
TERMS OF THE DEAL.              

296
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,910
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK THAT 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE APPLAUSABLE AND

297
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,012
GOOD WAY TO DO WITH THE IRAN    
NUCLEAR DEAL?                   

298
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,349
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON 

299
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,685
THE DECISION HE HAS.            
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, THE        

300
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,623
PRESIDENT ISN'T LOOKING AT ONE  
PIECE OF THIS.                  

301
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:43,361
HE'S LOOKING AT ALL OF THE BAD  
BEHAVIOR OF IRAN, NOT JUST THE  

302
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,498
NUCLEAR DEAL AS BAD BEHAVIOR.   
THE BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING,  

303
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:52,070
DESTABILIZING OF THE REGION,    
NUMBER 1 STATE SPONSOR OF       

304
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,474
TERROR, ELICIT NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
HE WANTS TO LOOK FOR A BROAD    

305
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,543
STRATEGY THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF  
THOSE PROBLEMS.                 

306
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,879
THAT'S WHAT HIS TEAM IS FOCUSED 
ON AND THAT'S WHAT HE WILL ROLL 

307
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:06,417
OUT TO ADDRESS THAT AS A WHOLE  
IN THE COMING DAYS.             

308
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,620
STEVE?                          
>> IS IT THE PRESIDENT'S WISH --

309
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:15,893
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET  
INTO THE DETAILS OF THE         

310
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,462
PRESIDENT'S DECISION UNTIL HE   
MAKES THAT.                     

311
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,299
>> SARAH, ABOUT CUBA.           
CBS NEWS IS REPORTING THAT THE  

312
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,968
STORY IS GOING TO A NEW LEVEL.  
THERE'S AMERICANS THAT DON'T    

313
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,539
WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT    
SAYING THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THESE 

314
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,174
ATTACKS.                        
THERE'S A HANDFUL OF AMERICANS  

315
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,542
THAT HAVE REPORTED THESE        
SYMPTOMS.                       

316
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,978
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?          
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE VIEWING  

317
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,314
THIS?                           
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET TO THE  

318
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,249
BOTTOM OF IT?                   
>> SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE       

319
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,384
SERIOUSLY.                      
WE'RE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE.

320
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,353
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING  
THE LEAD ON THIS EFFORT AND     

321
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:47,325
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK 
INTO THIS UNTIL WE GET SOME REAL

322
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,495
ANSWERS.                        
>> JUST TO DRILL DOWN ON WHAT   

323
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,330
YOU SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE    
PRESS.                          

324
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:57,135
SAYING THAT WE OWE IT -- I DON'T
THINK ANYBODY DISAGREES THAT WE 

325
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,204
SHOULD BE ACCURATE.             
BUT DO YOU AND THE PRESIDENT    

326
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:04,408
BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS A     
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AS TRUTHFUL

327
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:11,949
AND HONEST AND HAS HE DONE IT   
AND THOSE SURROGATES THAT HAVE  

328
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,453
USED ALTERNATIVE FACTS AND WOULD
THEY NOT DO THAT?               

329
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,889
>> ABSOLUTELY.                  
WE ALL COME HERE EVERY DAY TO   

330
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:21,859
GIVE YOU THE BEST AND MOST      
ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT WE    

331
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,561
CAN.                            
APRIL?                          

332
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:28,733
>> GOING BACK TO THE ANSWER     
ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND THE        

333
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,003
PRESIDENT.                      
IS GENERAL KELLY PART OF THAT   

334
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,172
LEADERSHIP TEAM WITH THE        
PRESIDENT AS HE'S LEADING IN    

335
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,307
THIS WHITE HOUSE?               
>> ABSOLUTELY.                  

336
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,843
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE      
CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL KELLY?    

337
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,545
>> ABSOLUTELY.                  
>> TODAY IS FRIDAY.             

338
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,414
CAN WE EXPECT A RESIGNATION     
TODAY?                          

339
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:48,753
>> I DON'T THINK SO, APRIL.     
DAVID?                          

340
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:53,491
>> SINCE WE LAST HEARD FROM YOU,
THE FORM PRODUCER HARVEY        

341
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,262
WINESTEIN HAS BECOME THE SUBJECT
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT            

342
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,399
ALLEGATIONS.                    
AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DEMOCRATS 

343
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:07,972
THAT HAVE HAD DONATIONS.        
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT LATINOS

344
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:12,810
IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD BE DEPORTED  
IF THE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED.    

345
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,179
DOES THE PRESIDENT THESE THE    
DONATIONS SHOULD GO BACK?       

346
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,481
>> THAT'S A DECISION FOR THE    
INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE.            

347
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,284
WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS MONEY    
THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE, THAT'S  

348
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,587
UP TO THEM.                     
THAT'S NOT A DECISION FOR US TO 

349
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,457
MAKE.                           
>> ONE MORE -- I'M SORRY.       

350
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,995
WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT FIRED  
THE IRS HEAD?                   

351
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,798
HE TALKED ABOUT THE SCANDAL.    
WHY DOES HE STILL HAVE A JOB?   

352
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:38,903
>> I'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM AND GET 
BACK TO YOU.                    

353
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:44,108
>> LAS VEGAS QUESTION.          
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE  

354
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:50,881
POLICE AND THEIR RESPONSE AFTER 
THE MASS SHOOTINGS.             

355
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,353
NEVADA --                       
>> CAN YOU SPEAK UP A LITTLE    

356
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,989
BIT?                            
>> NEVADIANS CREDIT FEDERAL     

357
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,559
MONDAY PROGRAMS TO TRAIN THEM TO
DEAL WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS TO  

358
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,529
DEAL WITH THE GREAT RESPONSE.   
YOU HAVE CUTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS 

359
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,933
IN YOUR BUDGET PLANS?           
ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT?        

360
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,970
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE  
CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD.     

361
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,673
IF THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE WE    
FEEL LIKE THE SAFETY AND        

362
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,477
SECURITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS   
MAY BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF CUTS, 

363
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,079
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO        
RE-VISIT IT AT THAT TIME.       

364
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,750
JIM?                            
>> SARAH, THE NATION LOST 33,000

365
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,719
JOBS IN SEPTEMBER.              
I WAS CURIOUS WHAT THE          

366
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:33,758
PRESIDENT -- HOW THE PRESIDENT  
FEELS ABOUT THAT AND HE'S       

367
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:38,162
STEPPING UP HIS EFFORTS TO      
CONVINCE CONGRESS TO PASS MAJOR 

368
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,165
TAX RETURNS BECAUSE OF THIS     
SURPRISING JOB LOSS IN          

369
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,334
SEPTEMBER.                      
>> I THINK TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS 

370
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,039
THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE   
HURRICANE SEASON.               

371
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,342
WHILE MANY DISPLACED WEREN'T    
ABLE TO WORK, THE ECONOMY       

372
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,544
REMAINS EXTREMELY STRONG.       
THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE     

373
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,381
JOBS, WHICH IS WHY THE          
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL.         

374
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,917
I THINK ONE THING TO REALLY KNOW
AND SOMETHING THAT THIS         

375
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,653
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO FOCUS ON
CERTAINLY MOVING INTO THE       

376
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,756
FUTURE, I THINK TAX REFORM PLAY 
AS BIG ROLE IN THIS.            

377
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,226
ONE OF THE BIG IDENTIFIERS THAT 
I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IS THE

378
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,264
DROP IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE,  
INCLUDING NEW LOADS FOR AFRICAN 

379
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,601
AMERICANS, TEENS AND WOMEN,     
WHICH IS CERTAINLY A GREAT STEP 

380
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:25,743
FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS.        
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS          

381
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,144
REPEATEDLY SAID THAT WE SHOULD  
LET OBAMACARE IMPLODE.          

382
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,181
THERE'S A NEW REPORT IN "THE    
WASHINGTON POST" THAT SET THAT  

383
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,916
PRESIDENT TRUMP PERSONALLY      
DIRECTED ADMINISTRATION         

384
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,486
OFFICIALS TO DENY A REQUEST FROM
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF IOWA TO  

385
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,221
FIX THE OBAMACARE MARKET IN THAT
STATE.                          

386
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,958
IS THAT TRUE?                   
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT        

387
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:43,794
SPECIFIC DIRECTIVE.             
SO I'D HAVE TO CHECK INTO THAT  

388
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,464
AND GET BACK TO YOU.            
>> IF IT IS TRUE --             

389
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:51,302
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON  
HYPOTHETICALS WHERE I DON'T HAVE

390
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:54,505
THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE  

391
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:58,642
IRAN RECERTIFICATION PROCESS.   
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

392
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,979
DECIDES, WHEN HE MAKES THIS     
DECISION NEXT WEEK, WOULD YOU   

393
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,783
RATHER NOT HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY
90 DAYS AFTER THAT?             

394
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:10,287
>> AGAIN, AS I SAID EARLIER,    
WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT 

395
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:15,559
IS A BROAD STRATEGY, DOESN'T    
JUST ADDRESS ONE PART OF I RAN'S

396
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,497
BAD BEHAVIOR AND ADDRESSES A    
WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES.           

397
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,634
SO THAT WOULD BE OUR FOCUS.     
HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD BEGIN TO   

398
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:28,305
NOT BE A BAD ACTOR AROUND WE    
WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS AT ALL.

399
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,742
OUR GOAL WOULD BE TO ADDRESS A  
NUMBER OF FACTORS, NOTICE JUST  

400
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,012
ONE OR TWO THING.               
PETER?                          

401
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:39,583
>> A SECOND QUESTION.           
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT HE 

402
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:48,359
WANTED PAKISTAN TO GO AGAINST   
AGENTS OF CHAOS.                

403
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,462
THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS HERE IN
THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WEEK TO    

404
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:56,867
MEET GENERAL McMASTER.          
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY CHANGE IN     

405
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,337
PAKISTANI BEHAVIOR?             
>> NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT I CAN  

406
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:04,141
WEIGH INTO AT THIS TIME.        
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.          

407
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,113
>> WILL THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN  
FOR THE CANDIDATE IN VIRGINIA?  

408
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,949
>> I'M NOT GROG TO WAY INTO     
SPECIFIC RACES AND THE ACTIONS  

409
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:16,287
WE MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE.         
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO END THIS

410
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,656
FOR FRIDAY.                     
I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT    

411
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,894
REST OF THE FRIDAY AND A GOOD   
WEEKEND.                        

412
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,931
THANKS, GUYS.                   
>> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE     

413
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:32,069
PRESS SECRETARY, SARAH SANDERS  
WRAPPED UP THE BRIEFING.        

414
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:37,808
THAT STARTED AFTER PRESIDENT    
TRUMP WITH A WINK AND A WARNING 

415
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,879
AFTER REMAINING WHAT HE MEANT   
WHEN HE CALLED A MEETING WITH   

416
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:48,552
THE MILITARY LITERS THE CALM    
BEFORE THE STORM.               

417
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:52,323
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.         
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?      

418
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,493
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.             
>> THANK YOU.                   

419
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,829
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT MADE  
THE ORIGINAL COMMENT LAST NIGHT 

420
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,498
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.             
AT THAT TIME HE WAS MEETING WITH

421
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:06,003
HIS MILITARY LEADERS TO TALK    
ABOUT MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY      

422
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:12,443
ISSUES, INCLUING IRAN, NORTH    
KOREA AND ISIS.                 

423
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:16,146
LISTEN.                         
>> THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE  

424
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:25,623
STORM.                          
>> WHAT STORM IS THAT,          

425
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:32,830
MR. PRESIDENT?                  
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.    

426
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,766
>> WHAT STORM, MR. PRESIDENT?   
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.             

427
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,502
>> Shepard: YOU'LL FIND OUT.    
WE WERE HOPING TO FIND OUT MORE 

428
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,471
AT THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING     
TODAY.                          

429
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,773
KRISTIN FISHER IS LIVE IN THE   
BRIEFING ROOM.                  

430
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,777
WE DID NOT.                     
>> WE DID NOT FIND OUT ANY      

431
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,380
ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION.       
THAT HAS BEEN THE MILLION DOLLAR

432
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,883
QUESTION ALL DAY HERE IN        
WASHINGTON AND AROUND THE WORLD.

433
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,486
WHAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP        
REFERRING TO WHEN HE SAID THAT  

434
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,254
THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE     
STORM.                          

435
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:01,125
YOU KNOW, REPORTERS IN THIS ROOM
ASK THAT QUESTION ABOUT AS MANY 

436
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,961
TIMES AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY ASK 
THE PRESS SECRETARY.            

437
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:08,732
THEY ASKED HER, YOU KNOW, WAS   
THIS INTENDED TO KEEP OUR       

438
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,035
ADVERSARIES GUESSING?           
PERHAPS WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP     

439
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,372
BEING MISCHIEVOUS OR MAYBE HE   
JUST MESSING WITH THE PRESS.    

440
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,475
HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.   
LISTEN TO THIS.                 

441
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,546
>> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS, AS I  

442
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,450
HAVE FROM THIS PODIUM ON QUITE A
FEW OCCASIONS, WE'RE NEVER GOING

443
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,954
TO SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT THE      
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DO.       

444
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,823
AS HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN        
ADDITION TO THOSE COMMENTS,     

445
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:38,195
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.    
I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE        

446
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,597
PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE        
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY

447
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:43,133
SERIOUS.                        
HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT'S HIS 

448
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,003
NUMBER 1 PRIORITY.              
IF HE FEELS THAT ACTION IS      

449
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,706
NECESSARY, HE WILL TAKE IT.     
>> WAS HE REFERRING TO NORTH    

450
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,141
KOREA?                          
WAS HE REFERRING TO SUPERIOR IS 

451

OF GREEN BERETS THIS WEEK OR    

452
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,781
MAYBE IRAN?                     
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.             

453
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:02,586
AS THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS        
SECRETARY MADE CLEAR, SHE'S NOT 

454
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:05,723
GOING TO GIVE MORE DETAILS.     
SHE WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO HIM,  

455
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:06,824
SHEP.                           
>> Shepard: KRISTIN, THE WHITE

MANDATORY BIRTH CONTROL COVERAGE
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR

00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,768
OBAMACARE.                      
THE NEW POLICY LETS EMPLOYERS   

459
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:26,644
REFUSE FREE CONTRACEPTIVES BY   
CLAIMING A RELIGIOUS OR MORAL   

460

THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES    

461
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,649
UNION HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AND   
OTHERS ARE PLANNING TO DO THE   

462
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,118
SAME THING.                     
BACK TO KRISTIN FISHER, A TOUCHY

463
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,686
SUBJECT THERE TODAY.            
>> RIGHT.

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,859
SO BEFORE THESE EXEMPTIONS WERE 
STRICTLY LIMITED TO RELIGIOUS   

465
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,895
BELIEFS.                        
NOW THEY'VE BEEN EXPANDED TO    

466
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,964
INCLUDE MORAL OBJECTIONS AS     
WELL.                           

467
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,901
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHAT CONSTITUTES A MORAL        

468
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,603
OBJECTION, HOW WILL THAT BE     
DETERMINED.                     

469
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,638
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT WILL  
BE DETERMINED BY THE STATE.     

470
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:58,942
THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT    
ROLL BACK OF THE CONTRACEPTION  

471
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,347
MANDATE BY THIS WHITE HOUSE AND 
THE ACLU HAS NOW THREATENED TO  

472
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,183
FILE A LAWSUIT.                 
JUST A MOMENT AGO, THE PRESS    

473
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,052
SECRETARY WAS ASKED WHAT DOES   
THE WHITE HOUSE THINK ABOUT     

474
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,721
THIS?                           
COULD IT GO TO THE SUPREME      

475
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,289
COURT?                          
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID.           

476
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:17,695
>> I WOULD PROBABLY NEVER USE   
THE ACLU TO GET MY TALKING      

477
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,364
POINTS.                         
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE FREEDOM  

478
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,267
TO PRACTICE ONE'S FAITH IS A    
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS       

479
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,902
COUNTRY.                        
ALL OF US DO.                   

480
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,006
THAT'S ALL THAT TODAY WAS ABOUT.
OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD   

481
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,142
PROTECT THAT RIGHT.             
AS LONG AS DONALD TRUMP IS      

482
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,978
PRESIDENT, HE WILL.             
>> THE FLIP SIDE IS COMING FROM 

483
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,481
DEMOCRATS.                      
NANCY PELOSI CALLED THIS NEW    

484
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:41,318
RULE DESPICABLE BECAUSE WHAT    
THIS MEANS IS NOW THAT          

485
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,555
POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF         
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ACROSS THIS  

486
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:49,760
COUNTRY WILL NO LONGER HAVE     
ACCESS TO FREE BIRTH CONTROL IF 

487
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,596
THIS RULE GOES FORWARD, SHEP.   
>> Shepard: THANK YOU, KRISTIN. 

488
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,700
LET'S TURN TO CHRIS WALLACE NOW,
THE ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY" 

489
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:03,440
LIVE WITH US IN D.C.            
WITH A SMILE THE PRESIDENT SAYS,

490
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,611
YOU CAN TAKE THIS MEETING TO BE 
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.      

491
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:13,016
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO THINK?  
>> WELL -- LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW  

492
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:18,856
IS THE ANSWER.                  
THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TO ANSWER.

493
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,658
YOU SAW SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, 
HIS CHIEF SPOKESPERSON REFUSED  

494
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,595
TO ANSWER.                      
MY GUESS IS THE PRESIDENT IS    

495
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:28,499
SITTING THERE WITH A TOP BRASS  
OF THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY ON

496
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,801
EARTH EVER AND SAYING IT'S THE  
CALM BEFORE THE STORM.          

497
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,304
HE'S NOT SAYING WE'RE ABOUT TO  
STRIKE NORTH KOREA, WE'RE ABOUT 

498
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,374
TO STRIKE IRAN.                 
HE'S NOT GOING TO TIP HIS HAND  

499
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,745
ON IMMINENT MILITARY ACTION.    
HE'S SAYING, WE HAVE THE MOST   

500
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,580
POWERFUL MILITARY AND DON'T MESS
WITH US.                        

501
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,217
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.     
DO I THINK HE'S LAYING OUT A    

502
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,321
SPECIFIC -- SOMETHING THAT WILL 
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT DAYS, WEEKS, 

503
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,456
HOURS, MONTHS?                  
NO.                             

504
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,426
I THINK HE'S SAYING WE HAVE THAT
CAPABILITY.                     

505
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,496
THERE WAS A VERY GOOD QUESTION  
ASKED IN THE BR
