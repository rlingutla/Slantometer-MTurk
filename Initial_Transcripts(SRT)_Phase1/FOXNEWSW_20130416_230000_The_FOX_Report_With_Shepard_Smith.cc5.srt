FIRST IMAGES OF WHAT APPEARS TO

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
BE ONE OF THE BOMBS THAT

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
EXPLODED IN THE BOSTON MARATHON

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
YESTERDAY.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
THIS IS BRAND-NEW.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
YOU ARE LOOKING AT PHOTOS WE

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
RECEIVED JUST MINUTES AGO.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
OUR FOX STATION FOX 5 IN ATLANTA

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
OBTAINED THIS IMAGE.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
IT'S ONE OF THE PRESSURE BOMBS

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
AFTER IT EXPLODED.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
ON THERE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
AN F.B.I. TAG.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF WHAT

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
CAUSED THE CHAOS IN BOSTON.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
GAIL RUSSELL REPORTER BROKE THIS

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
NEWS AND DALE, HOW DO YOU KNOW

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
WHAT THIS IS AND HOW DID YOU GET

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
IT?

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
>> SHEPARD, WE GOT THIS THROUGH

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SOURCES WHO VERIFIED FOR US THAT

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
THESE ARE ACTUAL CRIME SCENE

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
PHOTOS FROM THE FIRST BOMB FROM

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
MONDAY'S BOSTON MARATHON

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
BOMBING.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
>> Shep: TELL ME WHAT WE'RE

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
LOOKING AT HERE.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
WHETHER I LOOK AT IT, I CAN'T

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
TELL WHAT IT IS?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
>> WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS AN

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
ORDINARY, EVERYDAY PRESSURE

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
COOKER.
THEY ARE VERY COMMON IN THE

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
STORES, BUT ALSO THEY ARE COMMON

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
FOR BOMB MAKING.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
YOU ALSO SEE A BLACK PADDED

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
EITHER KNAPSACK OR DUFFEL BAG

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THAT MY SOURCES SAY THE BOMB WAS

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
CARRIED IN.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THERE IS ALSO SMALL BEARING TYPE

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
PELLETS, AND SOME SORT OF PUT AT

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
THIS HOLDING THEM TOGETHER.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
IT WAS PART OF THE SHRAPNEL THAT

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
MATES IT DEADLY.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
>> SO INVESTIGATORS HAD THIS

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
FROM THE EARLY MINUTES.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THE PEOPLE TOOK THE PICTURES.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THEY TOOK

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
PICTURES OF THIS.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
SINCE THEN THEY HAVE BEEN

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
ANALYZING IT.
LOOKING AT ALL THE MATERIALS,

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
TRYING TO TRACE THEM BACK TO THE

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
SOURCE AND HELPING THEM TRACE TO

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
WHOEVER BOUGHT THEM AND PUT THEM

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TOGETHER.

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
WHERE WERE THEY MANUFACTURED AND

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WHERE WERE THEY SOLD.

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THEY ARE VERY COMMON EVERYDAY

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
PIECES.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
THE KEY IS WHEN THEY GET TO

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
THESE PIECES, THEY GET THEM INTO

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
THE LABORATORY.
THAT IS WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
FIND WHETHER THERE IS A SIMPLE

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
LITTLE PIECE OF DNA OH A SLICE

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
OF SCOTCH TAPE OR FINGERPRINT

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
LEFT OVER ON A DEVICE THAT THE

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
BOMBER DOESN'T KNOW THEY LEFT

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
BEHIND.
>> Shep: WE'VE SCROLLED THROUGH

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THE PICTURES AGAIN.

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
ARE THESE SERIAL NUMBERS ON THE

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
PRESSURE COOKER IS THAT WHAT

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THEY ARE LOOKING AT WHEN THEY

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
ZOOM IN?

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
>> WE ARE EXAMINING THAT TO TRY

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THOSE

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
NUMBERS ARE.
WE TALKED TO WHO WE BELIEVE IS

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THE MANUFACTURER, BUT WE'RE

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
STILL WORKING ON THAT.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I THINK THERE IS SOME

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
UNDERWRITING LABORATORY NUMBERS

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
ON THERE.

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
THERE IS SOME NUMBERS THAT MAY

92
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
BE, AS YOU SAY, SERIAL NUMBERS.

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
THE SAME THING THE F.B.I. AND

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
ATF, WHO MANUFACTURED THIS

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
PIECE.

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
THEY GOT ENOUGH TO WORK WITH.

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
TAKE THAT AND FIND OUT WHO

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
MANUFACTURED IT, WHO SOLD IT AND

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
WHERE.

101
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
>> Shep: SO DALE, WHAT YOU ARE

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SAYING, AFTER THE BOMB EXPLODED

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THIS IS A LARGE CHUNK THAT ENDED

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
UP AT THE CRIME SCENE AND THE

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
REST OF IT CAUSED THE MAIMING

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AND DESTRUCTION.

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WHAT ARE YOUR SOUTH, FOREIGN?

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
>> WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
REMINDED OF, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
OF THE BOMBER?

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO SAY?

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
SORT IS THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY LOOK AT

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
IS THE LOCATION, BOSTON MARATHON

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THE DATE ON TAX DAY, ON PATRIOTS

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
DAY, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BEFORE

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE ANNIVERSARY OF WACO.

119
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
THESE ARE ALL IMAGES AND SYMBOLS

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE SIFTING

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THROUGH TO SEE IF THAT HAD

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MESSAGE

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THAT WAS PUT HERE WITH THESE TWO

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
BOMBS AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THEY CAN'T RULE OUT OVERSEAS,

126
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
FOREIGN TERRORISM AND THEY

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT TRYING TO

128
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
DETERMINE WHO WAS BEHIND THIS

129
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
AND WHY.

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
>> Shep: YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
IN THE MOMENTS AFTER THIS

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
BOMBING THAT WHEN THESE PRESSURE

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
COOKERS EXPLODED THEY WOULD HAVE

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
EXPLODED IN A LOT OF PIECES.

135
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WHAT THESE PICTURES SEEM TO

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
INDICATE, VERY LARGE PIECES HELD

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
TOGETHER.

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WE SEE NUMBERS IDENTIFYING

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
MARKS.

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WE SEE MATERIALS THAT ARE

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
CLEARLY, ACCORDING TO YOUR

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SOURCES, THE MATERIALS THAT HELD

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THIS BOMB AS IT SAT EITHER IN A

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
TRASH CAN OR SIDE 56 CURB.

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THESE ARE VERY VALUABLE PIECES

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
OF EVIDENCE WHICH I'M GETTING

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
WILL BE ICONIC PIECES.

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'M GETTING THERE ARE REPORTERS

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ALL OVER BOSTON ARE WONDERING

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HOW IN ATLANTA CAME ACROSS THIS?

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
>> I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU,

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SHEPARD, I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION OFF AIR.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
>> Shep: UNDERSTOOD.

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
DALE, PLEASE STAY WITH US.

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WE'RE BRINGING IN KATHERINE

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
HERITAGE.

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
KATHERINE, THE FIRST PICTURES OF

159
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
THE REMAINS OF THIS BOMB, WHAT

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
SOURCES ARE SEE SAYING WHAT SORT

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OF EVIDENTIARY VALUE.

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
>> THEY HAVE A HIGH EVIDENTIARY

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
VALUE, BUT WE KNOW TONIGHT AND

164
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
HAD CONFIRMATION WITHIN THE LAST

165
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
COUPLE OF HOURS, THESE BOMB

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
COMPONENTS, THEY ARE BEING

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
GATHERED UP AND SHIPPED DOWN TO

168
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WASHINGTON, D.C. AS TO WHAT IS

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
KNOWN AS F.B.I. LAB DOWN IN

170
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
QUANTICO.

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THEY PAINSTAKINGLY RECONSTRUCTED

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
KIND OF WHAT YOU SEE WITH

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ARCHAEOLOGIST.

174
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
THEY PIECE IT BACK TOGETHER AND

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THAT IS HOW THEY UNDERSTAND, THE

176
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
MODEL AND MAKE AND THAT KIND OF

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
INFORMATION THAT CAN ALLOW THEM

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY THE

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
SOURCE OF PURCHASE.

180
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THAT IS THE KEY BECAUSE

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A WITNESS WHO

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
CAN IDENTIFY A SUSPECT, SOMEONE

183
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
WHO IS AGENTS GO A LITTLE

184
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
STRANGE OR THEY MAY HAVE VIDEO

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
IN THE STORE THAT CAN LOOK AT A

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SPECIFIC TIME FRAME AND FIND

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THAT INDIVIDUAL.

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
SO WHAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT HERE IS

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
THE FIRST PICTURES OF THE PUZZLE

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PIECES OF PUZZLE AND CRIME

191
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SCENE.
NOW THEY ARE COMING DOWN TO

192
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
WASHINGTON, GOING TO THAT CRIME

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
LAB.

194
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THEY WILL BE RECEMENT BLD WITH A

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
BROKEN PIECE OF HISTORY AND PUT

196
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
IT TOGETHER.

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THEY IDENTIFY THE SOURCE AND

198
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THEN TRY AND IDENTIFY WHO

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
PURCHASED IT.

200
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
FROM THAT, VERY POSSIBLE LEADS.

201
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
>> Shep: MORE QUICKLY YOU CAN DO

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
THAT THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES OF

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
GETTING AT WHOEVER PLACED IT.

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
HOW QUICKLY THEY WERE ABLE TO

205
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
PUT THIS TOGETHER AND WHETHER

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THEY ARE ON THE TRAIL OF

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ANYTHING AS A RESULT?

208
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
>> WHAT WAYS TOLD BY VETERANS,

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THEY KNOW HOW THE BOMB WAS

210
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
BUILT.

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
THEY KNOW THIS GAME SO WELL.

212
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THEY HAVE SEEN SO MANY BOMBS.

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THEY HAVE DATABASES WITH ALL THE

214
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
COMPONENTS WE'VE SEEN HERE IN

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
THE PICTURES AND MORE.

216
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
WE ONLY HAVE SOME OF THE

217
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
PICTURES AND NOT ALL OF THEM.

218
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST BOMB.

219
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THEY'VE GOT ALL THIS EVIDENCE

220
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TOGETHER AND ALL THIS

221
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
EXPERIENCE.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
NOW, IT'S A MATTER AS WE HEARD

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
GOING OUT AND FINDING IT.

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> Shep: KATHERINE, IT'S MY

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
GUESS THAT THAT PROCESS HAPPENED

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
VERY QUICKLY.
THEY WERE ABLE TO CLEAR THAT

227
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
AREA RIGHT AWAY, ALL THE AREA

228
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
WAS SEALED AND TAGGED.

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS, I

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
THE REALM OF THE OBVIOUS THEY

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WOULD SEND THIS RIGHT THERE AND

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BEGIN THE PROCESS ALMOST

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
IMMEDIATELY.

235
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
>> Reporter: THEY WILL BEGIN

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BUT WHAT I

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
WOULD ADD AND WHAT JUMPED OUT TO

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS ON

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
COMMITTEES THAT ARE BEING

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
BRIEFED ON THE INVESTIGATION WAS

241
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THE WAY IN WHICH THE F.B.I.

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
SEEMED TO ISSUE ALMOST A CRY FOR

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
HELP FROM THE PUBLIC FOR VIDEO

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
AND FOR STILL PICTURES THAT WILL

245
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
HELP THEM TRY AND PUT AN

246
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
INDIVIDUAL AT THAT SCENE MOMENTS

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
BEFORE THE BLAST WHEN THE BAG

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
WAS PLACED.
THAT IS THE KEY.

249
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR

250
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
IT HAD TO BE PLACED, WE HAVE

252
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
SEEN A NUMBER OF IMAGES WITH A

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
BAG IN FRONT OF THOSE

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
BARRICADES.

255
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THAT VIDEO

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
AND THE INDIVIDUALS.

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
FINDING A PIECE OF EVIDENCE LIKE

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THIS THAT YOU CAN PIECE TOGETHER

259
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
YOU'VE GOT TWO TRACKS IN THE

260
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
INVESTIGATION.

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
YOU HAVE THIS WHERE IT CAME FROM

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
WHO MADE IT THE TIME FRAME,

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
MAYBE IT WAS MADE TWO OR THREE

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
YEARS AGO AND THE PERSON HAS

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
BEEN HANGING ON FOR THAT LONG.

266
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT A HAS

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
TO BE ANSWERED.

268
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
IS THERE DNA, THERE ARE

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE LEFT.

270
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
HAIR OR RESIDUE IN THE

271
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
EXPLOSIVES THEMSELVES.

272
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
>> Shep: WE CAN ONLY PRESUME IF

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
THERE IS A DNA ON THERE, THEY

274
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
KNOW IT.

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
IF THERE IS DNA ON THERE THEY

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
ARE ACTING ON IT.

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000

THE F.B.I. HAS PICTURES WHAT

281
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE BOMB THAT

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
BLEW UPRIGHT THERE AT THE FINISH

283
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000

ALL THE DAMAGE THAT IT DID AND

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
THE LIVES THAT IT TOOK ON THE

289
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
STREETS AT THE FINISH LINE.

290
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
YET THESE LARGE PIECES OF THAT

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
BOMB REMAIN.

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
HAD JUST HUGGED HIS DAD WHEN IS

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED.

305
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
MOURNERS LEFT CANDLES AND

306
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
FLOWERS AND ON THIS DRIVEWAY

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
SOMEONE WROTE THE WORD PEACE.

308

MOTHER AND SISTER ARE STILL IN

309
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SERIOUS CONDITION AND THE FATHER

THE CAR.

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I SAID -- OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU

314
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
OKAY?

315
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
>> HE DIDN'T EVEN ANSWER ME.

316
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
HIS FRIEND TOLD ME WHAT HAD

317
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000

318
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
OF MANUFACTURERS IN THE STATE OF

744
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
NOT TO TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
DALE RUSSELL BUT JUST WAY OF

747
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
THEORY, THEY MAY HAVE SENT TO

748
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN

749

GEORGIA.

750
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THE GOOGLE SEARCH LOOKS AT

751
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
MULTIPLE HITS FROM PRESSURE

752
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
COOKER MANUFACTURERS AND

753
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
POSSIBLE EVIDENCE FROM OTHER

754
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
PHOTOS, AS WELL?

755
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
>> JUST ONE OTHER NOTE.

756
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
WHAT IS REMARKABLE, YOU CAN SEE

757
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
THE STAMP FROM THE MANUFACTURER,

758
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CLEAR

759
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
SERIAL NUMBER ON THAT PRESSURE

760
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
COOKER.

761
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
THEY CAN FOLLOW THAT UP.

762
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT

763
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
UNIT WAS SENT AND POSSIBLY WHAT

764
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
STORE IT WAS SOLD AND WHO MAY

765
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
HAVE BOUGHT IT.

766
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
WE SAW TWO COMPELLING PHOTOS

767
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
FROM BOSTON AFFILIATE WHAT MAY

768
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
BE THE SECOND BOMB THAT WENT

769
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
OFF.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PHOTO, THE

770
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
FIRST PICTURE SHOWS WHAT LOOKS

771
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
LIKE A BAG OR A BOX ON THE

772
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
STREET SIDE OF A METAL BARRICADE

773
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
SITTING ON THE CURB.

774
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
SECOND PHOTO SHOWS THE SAME AREA

775
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
SHORTLY AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

776
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
CLEARLY WHERE THE BOX OR BAG WAS

777
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THAT IS WHERE THE AREA WAS WORSE

778
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
AFFECTED.

779
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
THEY BLURRED IT OUT BECAUSE IT'S

780
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
VERY GRAPHIC PHOTO.

781
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THEY SAW NOTHING LEFT OF THAT

782
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
BOX.

783
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THAT BOX OR BAG WAS THE SOURCE

784
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
OF THE SECOND EXPLOSION.

785
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THOSE PHOTOS HAVE BEEN FORWARDED

786
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

788
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
PICTURES WE'RE SEEN THAT

789
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
ILLUSTRATED PERHAPS MANY

HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE

GO OFF HERE IN BOSTON.

799

800
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
FROM THOSE THAT WERE THERE WHEN

801
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
THE BOMBS WENT OFF.

802
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
RUNNERS AND SUPPORTERS TELLING

803

WHAT THEY SAW AND HEARD IN FIRST

804
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
MOMENTS OF HORROR.

806
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000

807
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE AND

808
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
EVERYTHING WENT CHAOTIC.

809
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
>> THE GROUND SHOOK, BIGGEST

810
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
EARTHQUAKE.

811
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
PEOPLE WERE CONGRATULATING --

812
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
PICKING UP OUR MEDALS AND ALL OF

813
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
A SUDDEN, JUST KABOOM.

814
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
THIS LOUD BLAST.

815
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WE ALL STOPPED AND TURNED.

816
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WE LOOKED TOWARD THE FINISH

817
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
LINE.
YOU COULD SEE A BIG CLOUD OF

818
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SMOKE.

819
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
>> THERE WAS A SECOND ONE.

820
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
EVERYBODY SAID YOU NEED TO RUN.

821
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
BASICALLY EVERYONE STARTED

822
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
RUNNING AS MUCH AS THEY COULD.

823
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
>> I SAW A FIREBALL WHICH IS NOT

824
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

825
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
YOU SEE IT AN INSTANT BEFORE YOU

826
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
HEAR IT.

827

828
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
WAY.

THIRD FLOOR OF A BUILDING

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
OPPOSITE THE FINISH LINE.

833
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I WAS SITTING ON THE COUCH.

834
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THE BLAST BLEW ME OFF THE COUCH

835
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
ONTO THE GROUND.

836
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I RAN DOWN THE STAIRS AND I RAN

837
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
ON TO A CARPET OF GLASS AND

838
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
BLOOD STREAKS.

839
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000

840
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
PEOPLE THAT WERE AT THE PARTY

841
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
AND WE'RE BONDED.

842
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000

BOMBING HAPPENED AND I DON'T

THE BOMBING WHEN IT HAPPENED.

852
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000

IN DISBELIEF.

875
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
BOTH HIS LEGS WERE GONE.

876
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
