MYRIAD'S MONOPOLY MADE THE TEST

NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A PATENT

379
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
BECAUSE IT DID NOT CREATE

380
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
ANYTHING.

381
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A HUMAN GENE, THE COURT SAID, IS

382
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
A PRODUCT OF NATURE AND CANNOT

383
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
BE PATENTED.

384
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
IN RESPONSE, MYRIAD SAYS ENOUGH

385
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
OF ITS OTHER PATENTS SURVIVED TO

386

PROTECT ITS TESTS FROM

387
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
COMPETITION, BUT THE DECISION

388
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
FREES UP GENES FOR MORE RESEARCH

389
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000

>>> THE CENSUS IS TELLING US A

551
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
LOT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE

552
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
AND THE RAPIDLY CHANGING MAKEUP

553
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
OF OUR POPULATION.

554
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
WE LEARNED TODAY THAT LAST YEAR,

555
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
MORE NON-HISPANIC WHITE

556
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000

557
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
THAT GROUP IS STILL THE NATION'S

558
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
LARGEST, BUT IT HAS BEEN

559
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
SHRINKING FOR YEARS.

560
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, MINORITY

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
HALF OF AMERICAN CHILDREN UNDER

563
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THE AGE OF 5.

564
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
IN 2012, THE HISPANIC POPULATION

565
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
GREW THE MOST IN SHEER NUMBERS.

566
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
BUT THE ASIAN POPULATION FOR THE

567
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
FIRST TIME IS NOW THE FASTEST

AND AMONG AIRPORTS, PASSENGERS

583
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE DELAYED

584
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
