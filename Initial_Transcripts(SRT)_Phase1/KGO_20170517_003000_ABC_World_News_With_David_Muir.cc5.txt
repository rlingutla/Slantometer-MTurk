[000:00:21;371] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER WHO
[000:00:21;971] SURVIVED JUST 24 DAYS ON THE
[000:00:22;572] JOB.
[000:00:23;973] "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTING
[000:00:26;109] MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT SAID
[000:00:27;610] TO COMEY, "I HOPE YOU CAN LET
[000:00:28;211] THIS GO."
[000:00:30;580] COMEY WAS FIRED LAST WEEK.
[000:00:33;883] >>> ALSO TONIGHT, THE WHITE
[000:00:34;451] HOUSE, REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER
[000:00:35;085] PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE THE
[000:00:35;919] RUSSIANS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[000:00:38;021] TONIGHT, WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS

[000:00:53;103] COME ON TONIGHT.
[000:00:53;470] ONE ON THE GROUND JUST A SHORT
[000:00:54;571] TIME AGO.
[000:00:55;071] MILLIONS IN THE PATH OF THE
[000:00:57;240] STORMS TONIGHT.
[000:00:57;607] >>> AND THE NEW CAFFEINE
[000:00:58;575] CONCERN.
[000:00:59;309] THE 16-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD A
[000:01:00;877] COFFEE, AND SEVERAL OTHER DRINKS
[000:01:02;445] WITH CAFFEINE, THE CORONER WHO
[000:01:04;013] SAYS IT KILLED HIM.
[000:01:05;548] THE NEW WARNING, HOW MUCH
[000:01:06;082] CAFFEINE IS TOO MUCH.
[000:01:14;557] >>> GOOD EVENING.
[000:01:15;992] AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH
[000:01:16;626] US HERE ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.
[000:01:18;027] >>> AND WE BEGIN WITH THAT
[000:01:18;595] BREAKING HEADLINE AS WE COME ON
[000:01:19;229] THE AIR.
[000:01:20;130] TONIGHT, OUR TEAM NOW CONFIRMING
[000:01:24;300] A REPORT LATE TODAY IN "THE NEW
[000:01:24;934] YORK TIMES" THAT FIRED FBI
[000:01:25;869] DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY WROTE A
[000:01:27;971] MEMO, DOCUMENTING SOME OF HIS
[000:01:28;972] INTERACTION WITH PRESIDENT
[000:01:30;573] TRUMP.
[000:01:31;040] AND TONIGHT, THIS QUESTION, DID
[000:01:32;642] THE PRESIDENT ASK JAMES COMEY
[000:01:34;677] TO, QUOTE, LET THIS GO, WHILE
[000:01:36;279] TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION
[000:01:37;814] INTO THIS MAN, RETIRED GENERAL
[000:01:39;349] MICHAEL FLYNN, AND RUSSIA.
[000:01:46;589] FLYNN OF COURSE RESIGNED JUST A
[000:01:47;223] FEW DAYS INTO THE
[000:01:48;958] ADMINISTRATION.
[000:01:50;293] COMEY WAS FIRED ONE WEEK AGO
[000:01:50;894] TONIGHT.
[000:01:51;928] ABC'S SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
[000:01:52;896] CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA
[000:01:53;463] LEADING US OFF.
[000:01:54;564] >> Reporter: TONIGHT, ANOTHER
[000:01:55;532] BOMBSHELL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:01:56;566] ABC NEWS CONFIRMS PRESIDENT
[000:01:57;600] TRUMP ALLEGEDLY SUGGESTED FORMER
[000:01:58;601] FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SHUT
[000:02:00;170] DOWN HIS INVESTIGATION INTO
[000:02:00;937] FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
[000:02:02;238] MICHAEL FLYNN.
[000:02:06;442] A SOURCE CLOSE TO COMEY TELLS
[000:02:07;043] ABC NEWS, COMEY WROTE A MEMO IN
[000:02:11;080] FEBRUARY THE DAY AFTER FLYNN WAS
[000:02:11;714] FIRED.
[000:02:12;148] I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS GO, THE
[000:02:14;551] PRESIDENT ALLEGEDLY TOLD COMEY.
[000:02:15;752] ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, HE IS A
[000:02:17;353] GOOD GUY, I HOPE YOU CAN LET
[000:02:18;621] THIS GO.
[000:02:22;525] "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHO FIRST
[000:02:23;159] REPORTED THE MEMO SAYS IT WAS
[000:02:27;730] PART OF A PAPER TRAIL COMEY
[000:02:28;798] WANTED TO LEAVE BEHIND AS
[000:02:29;899] EVIDENCE INTO WHAT HE CALLED
[000:02:30;500] IMPROPER INFLUENCE INTO HIS
[000:02:31;067] INVESTIGATION.
[000:02:31;901] THE TIMES DIDN'T VIEW A COPY OF
[000:02:34;571] THAT MEMO.
[000:02:36;573] BUT SAYS ASSOCIATES OF COMEY
[000:02:37;173] READ IT TO A REPORTER.
[000:02:37;640] TONIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE IS
[000:02:38;208] DISPUTING THE STORY.
[000:02:39;142] SAYING IN STATEMENT, THE
[000:02:42;278] PRESIDENT HAS NEVER ASKED MR.
[000:02:42;879] COMEY OR ANYONE ELSE TO END ANY
[000:02:49;052] INVESTIGATION,
[000:02:51;688] INCLUDING ANY INVESTIGATION
[000:02:54;224] INVOLVING GENERAL FLYNN.
[000:02:55;291] THIS IS NOT A TRUTHFUL OR
[000:02:56;259] ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF THE
[000:02:58;428] CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE
[000:02:58;962] PRESIDENT AND MR. COMEY.
[000:03:01;030] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID COMEY WAS
[000:03:01;664] FIRED BECAUSE HE WAS NOT
[000:03:02;532] COMPETENT, CALLING HIM A
[000:03:03;600] SHOWBOAT.
[000:03:05;134] THIS GALVANIZED MANY IN THE FBI.
[000:03:06;703] THE ACTING DIRECTOR COMING TO
[000:03:07;737] COMEY'S DEFENSE LAST WEEK.
[000:03:09;806] >> IS IT ACCURATE THAT THE RANK
[000:03:11;875] AND FILE NO LONGER SUPPORTED
[000:03:12;976] DIRECTOR COMEY?
[000:03:14;577] >> NO SIR, THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.
[000:03:16;079] >> Reporter: BUT HE ALSO SAID
[000:03:19;682] YOU CANNOT STOP THE FBI FROM
[000:03:22;552] DOING THE RIGHT THING.
[000:03:23;019] >> SO THERE HAS BEEN NO EFFORT
[000:03:25;889] TO IMPEDE OUR INVESTIGATION TO
[000:03:26;923] DATE.
[000:03:27;991] >> LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA.
[000:03:32;695] THE WHITE HOUSE I KNOW IS
[000:03:33;229] DENYING THIS.
[000:03:34;597] BUT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT,
[000:03:38;935] IS BASED IN PART LATE TODAY ON
[000:03:41;004] TWO PEOPLE THEY SAY READ THE
[000:03:41;604] JAMES COMEY MEMO.
[000:03:42;038] PART OF A PAPER TRAIL THAT COMEY
[000:03:43;072] DOCUMENTED AS THE TIMES PUT IT,
[000:03:43;706] "IMPROPER EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE
[000:03:44;674] THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO
[000:03:45;708] FLYNN AND RUSSIA."
[000:03:49;846] >> Reporter: AND, DAVID, THE
[000:03:54;584] TIMES SAID THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS
[000:03:58;554] MEMO THEMSELVES BUT THEY SOURCED
[000:03:59;722] THESE TWO PEOPLE THEY SAY THEY
[000:04:00;356] READ IT.
[000:04:00;990] THE REACTION HAS BEEN POURING
[000:04:01;591] IN.
[000:04:02;358] DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY TALKING
[000:04:03;359] ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY -- RAISING
[000:04:03;993] THE POSSIBILITY OF OBSTRUCTION
[000:04:05;995] OF JUSTICE.
[000:04:06;562] THAT'S OF COURSE A FEDERAL
[000:04:07;130] CRIME.
[000:04:10;133] ONE SENATOR SAID THAT WE MAY BE
[000:04:10;767] TALKING ABOUT AN IMPEACHMENT
[000:04:11;367] PROCESS.
[000:04:12;969] DAVID, I WAS JUST SPEAKING WITH
[000:04:14;570] A SOURCE ON CAPITOL HILL.
[000:04:15;872] THIS JUST CAME IN, "I DON'T
[000:04:18;574] THINK WE COULD BE STUNNED
[000:04:23;680] ANYMORE GIVEN THE PAST WEEK.
[000:04:24;714] THIS BLEW THAT OUT OF THE
[000:04:25;248] WATER."
[000:04:25;748] THE SAME REACTION AT THE WHITE
[000:04:26;582] HOUSE TONIGHT.
[000:04:26;916] >> ANOTHER LONG NIGHT AHEAD FOR
[000:04:27;550] YOU, CECILIA.
[000:04:28;851] >>> I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE
[000:04:29;886] THOMAS, WHO COVERS THE FBI.
[000:04:30;453] PIERRE, YOU ACTUALLY CONFIRMED
[000:04:31;454] THIS EVENING THAT COMEY DID
[000:04:33;523] WRITE A MEMO TO DOCUMENT HIS
[000:04:34;557] INTERACTIONS WITH PRESIDENT
[000:04:35;625] TRUMP.
[000:04:35;825] THE SOURCE TOLD YOU THAT THE
[000:04:37;026] PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLEGEDLY ASKED
[000:04:37;727] HIM TO GO EASY ON FLYNN.
[000:04:38;594] >> DAVID, THE SOURCE SAID HE'S
[000:04:40;263] SEEN THE COMEY MEMO, AND HE
[000:04:40;830] CONFIRMED THE QUOTES IN "THE NEW
[000:04:46;502] YORK TIMES" SPECIFICALLY,
[000:04:47;036] PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLEGEDLY
[000:04:48;104] SAYING, I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS
[000:04:49;005] GO, HE'S A GOOD GUY.
[000:04:49;639] DAVID, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS A
[000:04:50;573] LOT OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE
[000:04:53;810] DEFENSE OF COMEY WHO BELIEVE
[000:04:54;410] HE'S A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND
[000:04:54;978] HONOR, NOT PERFECT.
[000:04:55;411] BUT A MAN OF INTEGRITY.
[000:04:56;946] AS FOR THE MOOD AT THE FBI
[000:04:57;513] THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS AND
[000:05:00;984] THEY'RE CARRYING ON THEIR WORK.
[000:05:02;485] BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE,
[000:05:03;553] A NUMBER OF FORMER FBI AGENTS I
[000:05:05;621] TALKED WITH ARE EXTREMELY ANGRY
[000:05:06;255] AT THE WAY COMEY WAS FIRED.
[000:05:09;225] DAVID.
[000:05:09;459] >> PIERRE THOMAS WITH US
[000:05:10;293] TONIGHT.
[000:05:10;526] PIERRE, THANK YOU.
[000:05:12;595] >>> ALL OF THIS COMES AS THE
[000:05:15;198] WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO SAY
[000:05:17;500] WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:24;574] THE PRESIDENT GAVE CLASSIFIED
[000:05:25;174] INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS.
[000:05:25;908] THAT HEADLINE BROKE LAST NIGHT
[000:05:26;642] AS WE CAME ON.
[000:05:28;511] OUR TEAM COULD HEAR THE YELLING
[000:05:29;145] BEHIND THE WALLS OF THE WEST
[000:05:29;746] WING.
[000:05:30;079] THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY
[000:05:31;114] REVEALING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
[000:05:33;216] ABOUT AN ISIS PLOT.
[000:05:33;649] THAT INFORMATION COMING FROM AN
[000:05:34;283] U.S. ALLY WHO HAD NOT GIVEN
[000:05:37;020] PERMISSION TO SHARE IT.
[000:05:40;490] TONIGHT, DID THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:05:41;557] REVEAL PUT ANY SOURCES ALREADY
[000:05:42;191] IN HARM'S WAY AT GREATER RISK?
[000:05:42;792] HERE'S ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:43;426] CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL.
[000:05:44;694] >> Reporter: AS PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:05:46;195] MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY
[000:05:46;829] TODAY, HE WAS HOUNDED WITH
[000:05:48;965] QUESTIONS --
[000:05:53;469] >> DID YOU REVEAL CLASSIFIED
[000:05:54;070] INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH
[000:05:54;670] THE RUSSIANS?
[000:05:55;571] >> MR. PRESIDENT, DID YOU SHARE
[000:05:57;140] CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE
[000:05:58;141] INFORMATION WITH THE RUSSIANS?
[000:05:59;742] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:06:00;243] >> Reporter: BUT A LITTLE LATER,
[000:06:00;877] HE TOUTED HIS MEETING WITH THE
[000:06:01;511] RUSSIANS AS A SUCCESS.
[000:06:02;578] >> WE HAD A VERY, VERY
[000:06:03;379] SUCCESSFUL MEETING WITH THE
[000:06:05;948] FOREIGN MINISTER OF RUSSIA.
[000:06:06;516] OUR FIGHT IS AGAINST ISIS.
[000:06:07;517] >> Reporter: AT ISSUE, WHAT THE
[000:06:10;586] PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE MET WITH
[000:06:11;220] THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND
[000:06:11;854] AMBASSADOR IN THE OVAL OFFICE
[000:06:12;989] LAST WEEK.
[000:06:16;359] THE "WASHINGTON POST" FIRST
[000:06:17;927] REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:18;594] SHARED HIGHLY SENSITIVE
[000:06:19;095] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ABOUT AN
[000:06:21;064] ISIS PLOT TO TARGET CIVILIAN
[000:06:25;001] AIRPLANES WITH LAPTOP BOMBS --
[000:06:26;269] SECRET INFORMATION, ABC NEWS HAS
[000:06:27;303] LEARNED, GIVEN TO THE UNITED
[000:06:28;337] STATES BY ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE.
[000:06:30;406] LESS THAN TWO HOURS AFTER THE
[000:06:31;974] STORY BROKE, THE NATIONAL
[000:06:33;543] SECURITY ADVISER EMERGED FROM
[000:06:36;646] THE WEST WING TO SHOOT IT DOWN.
[000:06:37;280] >> THE STORY THAT CAME OUT
[000:06:37;847] TONIGHT AS REPORTED IS FALSE.
[000:06:40;850] >> Reporter: THIS MORNING, THE
[000:06:41;851] PRESIDENT SEEMED TO CONFIRM HE
[000:06:42;485] SHARED SENSITIVE INFORMATION
[000:06:44;454] WITH THE RUSSIANS, TWEETING --
[000:06:46;022] "AS PRESIDENT I WANTED TO SHARE
[000:06:48;124] WITH RUSSIA, AT AN OPENLY
[000:06:49;659] SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE MEETING,
[000:06:54;564] WHICH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT
[000:06:55;198] TO DO, FACTS PRETRAINING TO
[000:06:58;501] TERRORISM AND AIRLINE FLIGHT
[000:06:59;102] SAFETY.
[000:07:00;570] TODAY McMASTER WAS BACK,
[000:07:01;104] CONFIRMING MANY OF THE DETAILS
[000:07:02;171] IN THE "POST" STORY AND NOT
[000:07:02;738] DENYING THE INFORMATION SHARED
[000:07:05;775] WAS CLASSIFIED.
[000:07:06;142] >> GENERAL, WHEN YOU CAME OUT
[000:07:09;412] AFTER THE STORY BROKE, YOU SAID
[000:07:10;046] THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT
[000:07:10;613] DISCLOSE ANY SOURCES OR METHODS.
[000:07:12;048] HE DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT
[000:07:13;049] MILITARY OPERATIONS.
[000:07:16;719] WHY WERE YOU DENYING THINGS THAT
[000:07:18;588] WERE NOT EVEN REPORTED?
[000:07:19;088] WHAT THE REPORT SAID IS THAT THE
[000:07:22;558] PRESIDENT REVEALED CLASSIFIED
[000:07:24;494] INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN SHARED
[000:07:25;128] BY ONE OF OUR ALLIES IN THE
[000:07:25;695] MIDDLE EAST.
[000:07:28;631] SO THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY A YES
[000:07:29;265] OR NO QUESTION HERE.
[000:07:30;566] DID THE PRESIDENT SHARE
[000:07:32;268] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH THE
[000:07:34;370] RUSSIANS IN THAT MEETING?
[000:07:34;904] >> AS I MENTIONED ALREADY, WE
[000:07:36;973] DON'T SAY WHAT'S CLASSIFIED,
[000:07:37;573] WHAT'S NOT CLASSIFIED.
[000:07:40;610] WHAT I WILL TELL YOU AGAIN IS
[000:07:41;210] THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHARED
[000:07:41;844] WAS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.
[000:07:44;247] THE STORY COMBINED WHAT WAS
[000:07:45;815] LEAKED WITH OTHER INFORMATION,
[000:07:50;586] AND THEN INSINUATED ABOUT
[000:07:51;521] SOURCES AND METHODS, SO I WANTED
[000:07:54;557] TO MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYBODY THAT
[000:07:57;760] THE PRESIDENT IN NO WAY
[000:07:58;261] COMPROMISED ANY SOURCES OR
[000:07:58;828] METHODS IN THE COURSE OF THIS
[000:07:59;428] CONVERSATION.
[000:08:02;565] >> Reporter: THE STORY IS A
[000:08:03;499] POLITICAL NIGHTMARE FOR THE
[000:08:04;066] TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY
[000:08:05;601] BECAUSE, AS A CANDIDATE, DONALD
[000:08:07;069] TRUMP MADE SUCH AN ISSUE OUT OF
[000:08:09;305] HILLARY CLINTON'S HANDLING OF
[000:08:10;606] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[000:08:13;075] >> WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE IN THE
[000:08:14;410] OVAL OFFICE WHO DOESN'T
[000:08:15;978] UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE
[000:08:18;047] WORD CONFIDENTIAL OR CLASSIFIED.
[000:08:21;717] >> Reporter: PRESIDENTS HAVE THE
[000:08:22;718] AUTHORITY TO DECLASSIFY
[000:08:25;321] ANYTHING, THE QUESTION IS, WHY
[000:08:26;589] HE WOULD SHARE IT WITH AN
[000:08:27;123] ADVERSARY?
[000:08:28;457] THE WHITE HOUSE INSISTS HE WAS
[000:08:30;026] SOLICITING RUSSIAN HELP IN THE
[000:08:30;660] FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.
[000:08:34;564] THE "POST" STORY SUGGESTS TRUMP
[000:08:36;232] WAS TRYING TO SHOW OFF, QUOTING
[000:08:36;866] HIM TELLING THE RUSSIANS, "I GET
[000:08:37;500] GREAT INTEL.
[000:08:38;334] I HAVE PEOPLE BRIEF ME ON GREAT
[000:08:39;402] INTEL EVERY DAY."
[000:08:42;038] McMASTER SAID THE PRESIDENT
[000:08:43;005] COULD NOT HAVE TOLD THE RUSSIANS
[000:08:44;040] THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION
[000:08:45;608] BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW THE
[000:08:46;175] SOURCE.
[000:08:49;078] >> THE PRESIDENT WASN'T EVEN
[000:08:51;847] AWARE OF WHERE THIS INFORMATION
[000:08:52;481] CAME FROM.
[000:08:53;416] HE WASN'T BRIEFED ON THE SOURCE
[000:08:54;450] OR METHOD OF THE INFORMATION
[000:08:55;051] EITHER.
[000:08:56;552] >> WASN'T AWARE OF WHERE THE
[000:08:58;588] INFORMATION CAME FROM.
[000:08:59;655] JONATHAN KARL LIVE WITH US AS
[000:09:01;157] WELL.

[000:19:06;628] SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WAS

[000:19:44;800] DISAPPEARING IN THE BERMUDA
[000:19:46;335] TRIANGLE.
[000:19:48;437] THE NEW DETAILS COMING IN.
[000:19:49;371] >>> AND THE EXPLOSION AT
[000:19:51;373] IN A PRESCHOOL.
[000:19:52;541] THE SCIENCE EXPERIMENT GONE
[000:19:53;108] WRONG.
[000:19:55;043] THE CHILDREN WHO WERE JUST
[000:19:55;611] 3-YEAR-OLDS, THEY WERE RACED
[000:19:56;211] AWAY WITH BURNS.
[000:19:56;578] BACK IN A MOMENT.
[000:19:57;713] after a DVT blood clot,
[000:19:59;348] I sure had a lot
[000:19:59;348] to think about.
[000:20:01;049] What about the
[000:20:01;049] people I care about?
[000:20:02;985] ...including this little girl.
[000:20:04;786] And what if this
[000:20:04;786] happened again?
[000:20:07;055] I was given warfarin
[000:20:07;055] in the hospital,
[000:20:08;857] but wondered, was this the
[000:20:08;857] best treatment for me?
[000:20:11;493] So I asked my doctor.
[000:20:12;828] And he recommended ELIQUIS.
[000:20:14;596] ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:20:14;596] and PE blood clots
[000:20:17;332] and reduces the risk of
[000:20:17;332] them happening again.
[000:20:19;902] Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:20:19;902] and PE blood clots.
[000:20:22;938] ELIQUIS also had
[000:20:24;239] significantly
[000:20:24;239] less major
[000:20:24;239] bleeding
[000:20:26;141] than the
[000:20:26;141] standard
[000:20:26;141] treatment.
[000:20:27;709] Both made me
[000:20:27;709] turn around my
[000:20:27;709] thinking.
[000:20:30;178] Don't stop ELIQUIS
[000:20:30;178] unless your doctor tells you to.
[000:20:32;247] ELIQUIS can cause serious and
[000:20:32;247] in rare cases fatal bleeding.
[000:20:35;450] Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
[000:20:35;450] an artificial heart valve
[000:20:37;653] or abnormal bleeding.
[000:20:39;121] If you had a spinal injection
[000:20:39;121] while on ELIQUIS
[000:20:41;189] call your doctor right away
[000:20:42;391] if you have tingling,
[000:20:42;391] numbness, or muscle weakness.
[000:20:44;493] While taking ELIQUIS,
[000:20:44;493] you may bruise more easily
[000:20:47;029] ...and it may take longer
[000:20:47;029] than usual for bleeding to stop.
[000:20:49;398] Seek immediate medical care
[000:20:49;398] for sudden signs of bleeding,
[000:20:51;733] like unusual bruising.
[000:20:53;068] ELIQUIS may increase
[000:20:53;068] your bleeding risk
[000:20:55;037] if you take
[000:20:55;037] certain medicines.
[000:20:56;271] Tell your doctor
[000:20:56;271] about all planned
[000:20:58;273] medical or dental
[000:20:58;273] procedures.
[000:20:59;741] ELIQUIS treats
[000:20:59;741] DVT and PE
[000:20:59;741] blood clots.
[000:21:02;678] Plus had
[000:21:02;678] less major
[000:21:02;678] bleeding.
[000:21:04;746] Both made ELIQUIS
[000:21:04;746] the right treatment for me.
[000:21:07;349] Ask your doctor if switching
[000:21:07;349] to ELIQUIS is right for you.
[000:21:12;521] How do you become America's
[000:21:12;521] best-selling brand?

[000:25:01;516] (VO)
[000:25:01;516] If you've had enough,
[000:25:02;751] tell your doctor
[000:25:02;751] what you've tried
[000:25:04;119] and how long you've been at it.
[000:25:05;754] LINZESS works differently
[000:25:05;754] from laxatives.
[000:25:07;923] LINZESS treats adults with IBS
[000:25:09;925] with Constipation
[000:25:09;925] or Chronic Constipation.
[000:25:11;927] It can help relieve
[000:25:11;927] your belly pain,
[000:25:13;762] and lets you have more frequent
[000:25:13;762] and complete bowel movements
[000:25:16;031] that are easier to pass.
[000:25:17;599] Do not give LINZESS
[000:25:17;599] to children less than six,
[000:25:19;935] and it should not be given
[000:25:19;935] to children six to less than 18.
[000:25:22;337] It may harm them.
[000:25:23;939] Don't take LINZESS
[000:25:23;939] if you have a bowel blockage.
[000:25:26;274] Get immediate help
[000:25:26;274] if you develop
[000:25:27;475] unusual or severe stomach pain,
[000:25:29;311] especially with bloody
[000:25:29;311] or black stools.
[000:25:31;313] The most common side effect
[000:25:31;313] is diarrhea, sometimes severe.
[000:25:34;616] If it's severe,
[000:25:34;616] stop taking LINZESS
[000:25:36;518] and call your doctor
[000:25:36;518] right away.
[000:25:38;286] Other side effects include gas,
[000:25:39;688] stomach-area pain,
[000:25:39;688] and swelling.
