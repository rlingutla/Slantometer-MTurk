[000:00:20;020] THE HOMES ON THE PARK'S EDGE.
[000:00:21;054] AND THE RESERVOIR WHERE SAN

[000:01:13;406] AND WE DO BEGIN WITH THE NEW
[000:01:14;507] THREAT THIS EVENING.
[000:01:16;142] THE FIERCE WINDS NOW FUELING THE
[000:01:16;876] FIRE, BURNING IN YOSEMITE
[000:01:17;710] NATIONAL PARK.
[000:01:22;082] WINDS EXPECTED THROUGH THE
[000:01:23;716] EVENING AND TONIGHT, NOT ONLY
[000:01:25;285] ARE FIRE CREWS TRYING TO KEEP
[000:01:25;985] THE FLAMES FROM REACHING
[000:01:26;619] THOUSANDS OF HOMES, THEY ARE
[000:01:27;287] BATTING TO PROTECT THOSE FAMOUS
[000:01:28;021] GIANT SEQUOIAS, THE ANCIENT
[000:01:29;055] TREASURES OF THE PARK.
[000:01:30;623] THE FIRE HAS NOT REACHED THEM
[000:01:33;293] YET, BUT SO MANY OTHER TREES THE
[000:01:33;993] FIRE HAS REACHED.
[000:01:35;428] 133,000 ACRES, A HUGE PART OF
[000:01:36;463] THE PARK, ALREADY CHARRED.
[000:01:41;267] JUST LISTEN TO IT TONIGHT.
[000:01:42;836] THE SOUND OF THE BONE DRY TIMBER
[000:01:43;903] GOING UP IN FLAMES.
[000:01:44;971] AND OUR TEAM, VISITING THAT
[000:01:46;573] CRUCIAL RESERVOIR IN THE PARK,
[000:01:48;174] WHERE SAN FRANCISCO GETS ITS
[000:01:48;875] WATER SUPPLY.
[000:01:50;877] CONTRIBUTING TO THAT STATE OF
[000:01:53;012] EMERGENCY NOW IN CALIFORNIA.

[000:01:58;418] FIGHT IS RIGHT THERE AT YOSEMITE
[000:01:59;152] AND THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN WITH
[000:02:02;122] ABC'S NEAL KARLINSKY AGAIN
[000:02:02;789] TONIGHT.
[000:02:05;859] >> Reporter: TONIGHT, THE FIGHT
[000:02:06;559] INSIDE YOSEMITE IS HOT AND
[000:02:07;393] INTENSE.
[000:02:09;562] CREWS AREN'T JUST TRYING TO STOP
[000:02:11;664] THE FIRE -- THEY'RE TRYING TO
[000:02:12;365] PROTECT A GROVE OF THE PARK'S
[000:02:14;300] FAMED SEQUOIAS -- THREE DOZEN IN
[000:02:15;034] ALL.
[000:02:15;935] THE HUGE TREES ARE AMONG THE
[000:02:17;504] OLDEST LIVING THINGS ON EARTH,
[000:02:19;072] AND TEAMS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED
[000:02:19;806] JUST TO THEM.
[000:02:22;308] >> I'M FROM VIRGINIA, SO THE
[000:02:23;877] FUEL TYPES HERE ARE DIFFERENT.
[000:02:25;512] AND THIS IS DEFINITELY DRY, SO,
[000:02:28;148] THIS IS SOME PRETTY EXTREME FIRE
[000:02:29;749] BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE ENCOUNTERING
[000:02:30;450] HERE.
[000:02:32;952] >> Reporter: MORE TEAMS ARE
[000:02:33;620] INSIDE THE PARK TO PROTECT THE
[000:02:34;320] AREA AROUND THE MASSIVE
[000:02:35;588] HETCH HETCHY RESERVOIR.
[000:02:37;690] WE SAW FIRST HAND, THE FIRE IS
[000:02:38;791] CLOSE TO THE AREA THAT SUPPLIES
[000:02:41;427] 85% OF SAN FRANCISCO'S WATER.
[000:02:43;530] CAUSE ENOUGH FOR THE GOVERNOR TO
[000:02:44;597] DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND
[000:02:46;733] PUT PUBLIC UTILITY CREWS ON
[000:02:47;800] ALERT TO MONITOR THE WATER'S
[000:02:48;468] QUALITY.
[000:02:51;004] >> IT'S STILL ACTIVELY BURNING
[000:02:51;704] AS WE SPEAK.
[000:02:54;707] IT HAS AFFECTED OUR WATER AND
[000:02:55;375] POWER SYSTEM.
[000:02:56;809] >> Reporter: ON THE ROAD OUTSIDE
[000:03:01;214] THE PARK, CREWS ARE CUTTING DOWN
[000:03:04;050] BURNED TREES THEY CALL "WIDOW
[000:03:07;387] MAKERS," BECAUSE THEY FALL
[000:03:08;521] WITHOUT WARNING.
[000:03:09;522] FURTHER TO THE NORTH, THE NOW
[000:03:11;124] FAMILIAR SIGHT -- MORE FAMILIES
[000:03:11;858] DISPLACED, EVACUATING AS THE
[000:03:12;525] FIRE BURNS THEIR WAY.
[000:03:14;327] >> 15 MINUTES TO BE OUT OF OUR
[000:03:15;028] HOUSE.
[000:03:17;463] SO WE ONLY GOT OUR KIDS, OUR
[000:03:18;164] ANIMALS AND A LITTLE BIT OF
[000:03:18;831] PICTURES.
[000:03:19;299] IT WAS HARD.
[000:03:19;766] >> Reporter: ELSEWHERE, AIR
[000:03:21;701] CHOKED WITH THICK SMOKE AND ASH
[000:03:22;435] IS THE PROBLEM.
[000:03:22;969] YOU CAN FEEL IT.
[000:03:23;870] >> YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD.
[000:03:25;471] IT'S PRETTY BAD.
[000:03:26;539] I'M ALL CONGESTED.
[000:03:30;443] YOU GET THE SINUS INFECTION AND
[000:03:33;112] ALL THAT STUFF.
[000:03:35;081] >> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT
[000:03:35;715] FIREFIGHTERS ARE WORKING SO HARD
[000:03:36;449] TO PROTECT.
[000:03:36;950] THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN INSIDE
[000:03:37;650] YOSEMITE ON SATURDAY BY TOURISTS
[000:03:38;384] HERE FROM THE UK, AMAZED THAT
[000:03:39;052] THE FIRE IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
[000:03:40;420] INSIDE -- FOR NOW.
[000:03:46;125] WE'RE HERED A THE SIDE OF
[000:03:49;996] YOSEMITE THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED
[000:03:51;364] OFF AND IS NOW BEING PROTECTED
[000:03:52;665] BY FIREFIGHTERS.
[000:03:54;701] THIS FIRE REMAINS VERY INTENSE,
[000:03:55;435] ONLY ABOUT 7% CONTAINED.
[000:03:56;069] IT'S BURNING HOT, THEY'RE HAVING
[000:03:56;769] A VERY HARD TIME GETTING AHOLD
[000:03:57;503] OF THIS ONE, DAVID.
[000:03:58;071] >> ALL RIGHT, NEAL KARLINSKY
[000:03:58;738] LEADING US OFF.
[000:03:59;272] NEAL, OUR THANKS TO YOU.
[000:03:59;872] I WANT TO BRING IN ABC
[000:04:00;473] METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE.
[000:04:02;242] AND AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING HERE,
[000:04:03;509] THE MAJOR THREAT TONIGHT, THE
[000:04:04;210] WINDS.
[000:04:05;511] >> RIGHT.
[000:04:05;979] AND THAT IS GOING TO SUBSIDE
[000:04:06;679] ONLY A LITTLE AS WE GET INTO THE
[000:04:08;248] START OF THE WORK WEEK.
[000:04:09;315] I HAVE TO SHOW YOU, DAVID,
[000:04:10;450] THE REAL PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE
[000:04:11;517] THE HEAT AND, OF COURSE, THE DRY
[000:04:12;252] CONDITIONS.
[000:04:13;119] IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HOTTER AND
[000:04:14;721] DRIER AS WE START THIS WEEK IN
[000:04:17;590] THAT PART OF CALIFORNIA.
[000:04:19;726] >> ALSO, THE FLOODING AND THE
[000:04:20;393] HEAT YOU'RE WATCHING AS WE TURN
[000:04:21;127] TO ANOTHER WEEK.
[000:04:21;628] >> RIGHT.
[000:04:22;095] HUGE HEADLINES COMING OUT.
[000:04:23;296] AND WE'VE GOT FLASH FLOODING
[000:04:24;797] THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN
[000:04:25;932] THE SOUTHWEST.
[000:04:26;432] YOU CAN SEE, SOME PICTURES,
[000:04:28;368] FRESH IN FROM NEAR NEEDLES,
[000:04:30;670] CALIFORNIA, WHERE U.S. 95 MEETS
[000:04:32;472] HIGHWAY 40, I-40, IT HAD TO SHUT
[000:04:34;974] DOWN IN BOTH WAYS BECAUSE OF ALL
[000:04:35;775] THAT RAIN.
[000:04:38;278] GREATER THAN A HALF INCH IN JUST
[000:04:38;978] 15 MINUTES.
[000:04:39;445] I HAVE TO SHOW YOU, IT'S NOT
[000:04:40;079] OVER.
[000:04:41;080] AND THIS IS A TWO-DAY EVENT
[000:04:42;749] HERE.
[000:04:43;182] REALLY MOSTLY TONIGHT INTO EARLY
[000:04:44;517] TOMORROW, YOU COULD GET TWO-PLUS
[000:04:45;852] INCHES VERY QUICKLY.
[000:04:46;886] AND QUICKLY DAVID, I HAVE TO
[000:04:47;954] TELL YOU, HEAT IN THE MIDWEST,
[000:04:49;555] IT IS RECORD-BREAKING.
[000:04:51;124] MINNEAPOLIS TODAY HIT 96.
[000:04:52;759] THEY WILL STAY IN THE 90s.
[000:04:53;793] LEGITIMATE HEAT WAVE FOR
[000:04:54;894] CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS AND KANSAS
[000:04:55;528] CITY.
[000:04:57;430] >> ALL RIGHT, TRACKING IT ALL.

[000:05:00;266] GINGER, THANK YOU.
[000:05:00;800] >>> NOW TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA
[000:05:01;534] THIS EVENING, AND TO A MESSAGE
[000:05:02;235] FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, INTENDED
[000:05:04;003] FOR THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.
[000:05:05;071] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THERE IS
[000:05:06;139] VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS
[000:05:07;674] THE SYRIAN REGIME THAT USED
[000:05:10;209] CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ITS OWN
[000:05:12;111] PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.
[000:05:13;313] AND TONIGHT, MORE OF THOSE NEW
[000:05:14;380] IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH.
[000:05:15;014] BELIEVED TO BE THE SINGLE
[000:05:17;050] DEADLIEST ATTACK SO FAR THERE IN
[000:05:17;717] SYRIA.
[000:05:18;117] SYRIA SAYS IT WILL ALLOW
[000:05:18;785] INSPECTORS.
[000:05:20;787] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THAT TIME
[000:05:21;487] HAS PASSED.
[000:05:22;922] AND SO TONIGHT HERE, WE ASK,
[000:05:23;589] WILL AMERICA ACT?
[000:05:24;157] WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?
[000:05:25;058] AND IF SO, HOW SOON?
[000:05:27;694] ABC'S CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS
[000:05:28;394] CORRESPONDENT, MARTHA RADDATZ,
[000:05:29;295] REPORTING IN FROM THE REGION
[000:05:29;996] AGAIN TONIGHT.
[000:05:30;930] MARTHA?
[000:05:35;101] >> Reporter: DAVID, IT APPEARS
[000:05:35;835] TONIGHT THAT THE U.S. IS CLOSER
[000:05:36;569] TO TAKING MILITARY ACTION IN
[000:05:38;304] SYRIA THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH
[000:05:40;406] STRONG WORDS FROM U.S. OFFICIALS
[000:05:43;076] TODAY AND WARSHIPS AT THE READY.
[000:05:47;347] NAVY DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES
[000:05:48;948] NOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
[000:05:50;516] COULD LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILES
[000:05:52;652] INTO SYRIA WHENEVER ORDERED,
[000:05:54;787] TARGETING SYRIAN REGIME COMMAND
[000:05:56;889] AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS,
[000:05:58;491] AIRFIELDS OR AIRCRAFT THAT MIGHT
[000:05:59;525] BE USED TO CARRY CHEMICAL
[000:06:00;193] WEAPONS.
[000:06:05;898] ANOTHER OPTION -- U.S. FIGHTER
[000:06:06;666] JETS LAUNCHING WEAPONS FROM
[000:06:07;333] OUTSIDE SYRIAN AIR SPACE.
[000:06:08;267] >> THE SYRIANS HAVE CREATED THIS
[000:06:11;771] SANCTUARY, WHERE THERE ARE
[000:06:12;739] SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES.
[000:06:13;873] >> Reporter: IMAGES OF THE
[000:06:14;907] SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK HAVE
[000:06:16;542] OUTRAGED THE WORLD.
[000:06:17;110] MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED
[000:06:17;810] IN THE MOST HORRIFIC WAY.
[000:06:20;246] PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL NOT
[000:06:21;280] INTERVENE UNTIL THE ATTACK IS
[000:06:23;416] VERIFIED, BUT ADMINISTRATION
[000:06:27;587] OFFICIALS ARE TONIGHT SAYING
[000:06:28;588] THERE IS A STRONG SUSPICION THAT
[000:06:30;790] THE ASSAD REGIME LAUNCHED THE
[000:06:33;226] ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE REBELS
[000:06:34;427] DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE KIND OF
[000:06:35;862] ROCKETS IN WHICH THE CHEMICALS
[000:06:37;196] WERE BELIEVED TO BE DELIVERED.
[000:06:40;133] TODAY, SYRIA SAID IT WOULD ALLOW
[000:06:40;867] U.N. INSPECTORS TO VISIT THE
[000:06:41;734] SITE, BUT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY
[000:06:43;870] IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND
[000:06:44;904] THE EVIDENCE THEY WOULD PRESENT
[000:06:45;972] IS LIKELY CORRUPTED.
[000:06:48;107] SO, HOW SOON COULD THIS HAPPEN?
[000:06:53;946] U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS, A
[000:06:56;482] RESPONSE MUST BE TIMELY, DONE
[000:06:57;183] SOON ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANOTHER
[000:06:57;884] CHEMICAL ATTACK.
[000:06:58;384] "WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
[000:06:59;051] MONTHS."
[000:07:00;787] >> I THINK THE BEST THAT WE
[000:07:01;454] COULD HOPE FOR IS TO DETER MR.
[000:07:03;423] ASSAD FROM USING CHEMICALS
[000:07:04;490] AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AGAIN.
[000:07:07;693] AND WORST CASE, DRAG US INTO A
[000:07:08;694] LARGER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT.
[000:07:09;762] >> Reporter: DAVID, THE
[000:07:13;966] ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO MADE
[000:07:15;067] VERY CLEAR THEY DO NOT WANT TO
[000:07:17;003] TAKE ANY KIND OF ACTION ALONE.
[000:07:18;604] SO, THERE HAVE BEEN URGENT
[000:07:21;040] MEETINGS WITH ALLIES HERE IN THE
[000:07:22;408] REGION AND ELSEWHERE.
[000:07:24;577] DAVID?
[000:07:25;011] >> MARTHA RADDATZ WITH US AGAIN
[000:07:25;745] TONIGHT.
[000:07:26;179] MARTHA, OUR THANKS TO YOU.
[000:07:26;813] >>> AND NOW TO EGYPT THIS
[000:07:27;447] EVENING, WHERE IT'S BEEN HARD TO
[000:07:28;314] KEEP TRACK OF WHICH LEADERS ARE

[000:07:42;228] ARAB SPRING.
[000:07:45;498] INSIDE, HE SAT IN A WHEELCHAIR
[000:07:46;299] IN THE DEFENDANT'S CAGE, WEARING
[000:07:47;033] DARK SUNGLASSES THERE.
[000:07:47;867] LAST WEEK, WE SHOWED YOU MUBARAK
[000:07:49;735] BEING FREED AFTER THE CURRENT
[000:07:51;637] PRESIDENT, MOHAMED MORSI, WAS
[000:07:53;639] JAILED INSTEAD.
[000:07:55;675] >>> TO ANOTHER CASE OVERSEAS
[000:07:56;375] INVOLVING AMERICAN COLLEGE
[000:07:57;009] STUDENT AMANDA KNOX, WHO NOW
[000:08:00;480] SAYS SHE WILL NOT BE ATTENDING
[000:08:01;214] THE SECOND TRIAL IN HER CASE IN
[000:08:01;914] ITALY.
[000:08:02;615] HER LAWYERS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT
[000:08:03;349] SHE WILL NOT GOT BACK FOR THE
[000:08:04;016] PROCEEDINGS.
[000:08:06;319] KNOX IS BEING TRIED AGAIN FOR
[000:08:07;019] THE MURDER OF HER ROOMMATE BACK
[000:08:07;720] IN 2007.
[000:08:08;988] SHE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON
[000:08:09;722] FOR THAT CRIME BEFORE HE
[000:08:11;123] CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED.
[000:08:13;226] HER LAWYERS WILL REPRESENT HER
[000:08:14;260] AT THE RETRIAL, WHICH BEGINS
[000:08:15;328] NEXT MONTH.
[000:08:17;463] >>> AND TO AUSTRALIA TONIGHT,
[000:08:19;065] WHERE THERE IS A SEARCH UNDER

[000:08:21;200] AFTER A VERY RARE ATTACK THERE.
[000:08:22;802] A YOUNG MAN VANISHING AFTER
[000:08:24;403] BEING ATTACKED BY A CROCODILE IN
[000:08:26;506] AN AREA WHERE THE ONCE
