TO DELIVER ON SOMETHING EVEN    
MORE AMBITIOUS -- A MASSIVE NEW

TAX CUT.

>> Reporter: DETAILS ARE STILL  

37
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,595
SKETCHY, BUT THE PLAN CALLS FOR 
SLASHING THE TAX ON             

38
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,931
CORPORATIONS, NOW 35%, TO 20%.

THREE.                          
DOUBLING THE STANDARD DEDUCTION 

41
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:22,040

THAT WOULD MEAN NO INCOME TAX

00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,810
WHATSOEVER ON THE FIRST $24,000 
OF INCOME.                      

43
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,448
THE PRESIDENT INSISTS HIS PLAN  
WILL BENEFIT THE WORKING CLASS, 

44
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,616
AND NOT THE WEALTHY.

>> Reporter: OF COURSE, IT'S    

48
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,761
IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW HOW ANY PLAN 
WILL AFFECT THE PRESIDENT       

49
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,797
BECAUSE HE STILL HAS NOT        
RELEASED HIS TAX RETURNS.       

50
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:49,268
BUT THERE'S ONE BIG PROVISION   
THAT WOULD CLEARLY BENEFIT THE

WEALTHY.

MILLION FOR INDIVIDUALS, $11    

54
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,980
MILLION FOR COUPLES.            
WHILE CONGRESS WILL SURELY MAKE 

55
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:06,852
CHANGES IN THE PLAN, THE        
PRESIDENT INSISTS THERE'S ONE   

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,088
THING HE WON'T BUDGE ON -- THAT 
HUGE TAX CUT FOR CORPORATIONS.  

57
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,325
>> 20 IS MY NUMBER.             
SO, I'M NOT NEGOTIATING THAT    

58
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,327
NUMBER.                         
20 IS A PERFECT NUMBER.         

59
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,063
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT      
DOESN'T EXPLAIN HOW TO PAY FOR

CAKE.                           

63
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,742

   After a DVT blood clot...    

517
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,910
  I sure had a lot on my mind.  

518
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,795
     My 30-year marriage...     

519
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,630
 ...my 3-month old business...  

520
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:51,916
      Plus...what if this       
        happened again?         

521
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,700
      I was given warfarin      
        in the hospital,        

522
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,220
     but wondered, was this     
   the best treatment for me?   

523
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,372
      So I made a point to      
       talk to my doctor.       

524
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,391
   He told me about ELIQUIS.    

525
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:02,509
       ELIQUIS treats DVT       
       and PE blood clots       

526
00:26:02,544 --> 00:26:05,012
      and reduces the risk      
    of them happening again.    

527
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:08,382
  Not only does ELIQUIS treat   
    DVT and PE blood clots.     

528
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,402
               ELIQUIS also had 
              significantly less
                major bleeding  

529
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,603
               than the standard
                  treatment.    

530
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,488
                       ELIQUIS  
                     had both...

531
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,357
                  ...and that   
                turned around my
                   thinking.    

532
00:26:16,392 --> 00:26:18,776
   <i> Don't stop ELIQUIS unless</i>   
   <i> your doctor tells you to.</i>   

533
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:22,162
 <i> ELIQUIS can cause serious and</i> 
 <i> in rare cases fatal bleeding.</i> 

534
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,365

     <i> or abnormal bleeding.</i>     

536
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:28,085
      <i> If you had a spinal</i>      
   <i> injection while on ELIQUIS</i>  

537
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,286
  <i> call your doctor right away</i>

 <i> numbness, or muscle weakness.</i> 

539
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,907

 <i> you may bruise more easily...</i> 

540
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,410
  <i> and it may take longer than</i>  
  <i> usual for bleeding to stop.</i>  

541
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,745
  <i> Seek immediate medical care</i>  
 <i> for sudden signs of bleeding,</i>

543
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,882
      <i> ELIQUIS may increase</i>     
       <i> your bleeding risk</i>      

544
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,350
 <i> if you take certain medicines.</i>

545
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:45,052
     <i> Tell your doctor about</i>

     <i> or dental procedures.</i>     

547
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,189
              ELIQUIS treats DVT
             and PE blood clots.

548
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:51,075
                  Plus had less 
                 major bleeding.

549
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,977
       Both made ELIQUIS        
         right for me.          

550
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:56,563
  Ask your doctor if switching  
  to ELIQUIS is right for you.
