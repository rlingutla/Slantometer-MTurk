TRANSFORMED INTO A SCENE OF

THIS IS THE BACK BAY OF BOSTON.

106
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
IT IS A POPULAR AREA.

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
IT IS A BUSY AREA ON A NORMAL

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
IT IS CHAOTIC HERE DURING THE

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THE BARS ARE OPEN.

113
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
PEOPLE ARE OUT.

114
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE.

115
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING
ON.

116
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I GUESS THEY ARE TRYING NOT TO

117
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
CONGREGATE.

118
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
FOR THE MOST PART IT'S QUIET FOR
THIS AREA.

119
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
AFTER THE EXPLOSION THERE WERE

120
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
STREAMS OF PEOPLE WALKING THE

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
STREETS.

122
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THE SUBWAYS WERE SHUT DOWN AND

123
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
BECAUSE OF THAT, PEOPLE HAD TO

124
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WALK FOR MILES IN SOME CASES TO

125
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THEIR DESTINATION.

126
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
IN FACT, WE ARE TWO BLOCKS FROM

127
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
THE FINISH LINE.

128
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE THE
EXPLOSIONS HAPPENED.

129
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
WE SAW A WOMAN RIGHT OVER HERE,

130
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
WITNESSES SAW HER STUMBLING TO

131
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THIS BLOCK WITH SHRAPNEL WOUNDS.

132
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
NBC HAS CONFIRMED SHRAPNEL WAS

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PART OF THEEGS -- THESE

134
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
EXPLOSIONS.

135
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
THAT'S WHY THERE WERE LOWER LIMB
INJURIES.

136
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING

137
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
TOURNIQUETS APPLIED ON THE
RACEWAY.

138
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
BACK BAY IS NORMALLY A BUSY

139
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
AREA.

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THE STREETS ARE CLOSED RIGHT
NOW.

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

142
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
ROADBLOCKS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.

143
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THERE WAS A GROUND STOP AT LOGAN

144
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AIRPORT.

145
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
WE HAD TO CIRCLE OVER PROVIDENCE

146
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
FOR QUITE A WHILE BEFORE THEY

147
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
ALLOWED US TO LAND.

148
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE, A VERY

149
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE HERE.

150
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THE NATIONAL GUARD IS HERE AND

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
PEOPLE ARE ON ALERT.

152
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING

153
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
ON.

154
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THE POLICE COMMISSIONER ASKED

155
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
EVERYBODY TO STAY INSIDE,
EVERYBODY TO GO HOME IF THEY

156
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
CAN.

157
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
FROM WHAT YOU CAN TELL ALTHOUGH

158
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT HERE, MOST

159
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000

160
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AT LEAST AROUND HERE.

161
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BRIAN?

THE FINISH LINE THE DIGITAL

163
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
SEEMS TO SAY THIS WAS THE 4:09,

164
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
FOUR HOUR, NINE MINUTE FINISHING

165
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
MARK.

166
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
IF YOU ARE CROSSING THE FINISH
LINE AT THAT POINT IN THIS RACE

167
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL.

168
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
TO FINISH AT ALL YOU HAVE DONE

169
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
VERY WELL.

170
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
BUT PEOPLE THOUGHT, AND YOU

171
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
CAN'T BLAME THEM, THAT THIS WAS

172
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
SOME KIND OF CANNON, A PLANNED

173
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
THING.

174
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I HAD ONE EYEWITNESS DESCRIBE IT

175
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
IN TERMS OF WORLD TRADE.

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THAT ONCE THE SECOND BUILDING

177
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WAS HIT THAT DAY WE KNEW IT WAS

178
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

179
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
WELL ONCE THE SECONDARY

180
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
EXPLOSION WENT OFF, THEY KNEW IT

181
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT OF THE

182
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
CONSTRUCTION OF THE CITY LIKE A

YOU'RE AT A MARATHON, ESPECIALLY

186

IN BOSTON WHERE THEY HAVEN'T HAD

189
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.

190
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
INITIALLY NOBODY THOUGHT -- THEY
WEREN'T SURE IF IT WAS EVEN AN

191
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
ACCIDENT, A GAS MAIN BREAK.

192
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS

193
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
GOING ON.
WHEN THE SECOND EXPLOSION

194
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
HAPPENED 15 SECONDS LATER PEOPLE

195
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
STARTED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS

196
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
SOMETHING FISHY, SOMETHING BAD.

197
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO

198
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
GET SCARED, RUN AWAY.
A BIT OF A CHAOTIC SCENE OUT

199
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
HERE.
BRIAN?

200
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
>> KATY TUR ON THE STREETS OF

201
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
BOSTON TONIGHT.

202
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
FOR A 15-BLOCK AREA PEOPLE

203
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
AREN'T ALLOWED.

204
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WILL
BE ALLOWED BACK IN.

205
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>>> TO WASHINGTON WE GO.
OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE

206
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
WILLIAMS HAS BEEN WORKING THIS

207
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
STORY ALL DAY.
PETE, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US

208
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TONIGHT?

209
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
>> TONIGHT AUTHORITIES CONFIRM

210
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THAT THERE WERE TWO BOMBS.

211
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
WE KNOW THAT MUCH.

212
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY OTHERS

213
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
WERE PLANTED.

214
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
THEY SAY THERE WERE OTHER

215
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.

216
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
AND THE WORD, OF COURSE, OF

217
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ANOTHER BOMB ELSEWHERE PLACED AT

218
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THE JFK LIBRARY IS APPARENTLY

219
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
TURNING OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.

220
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
AT LEAST FIVE OTHER PACKAGES

221
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE STREET,

222
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
HAVE BEEN DEEMED SUSPICIOUS AND
ARE BEING DESTROYED.

223
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
BUT THERE IS NO FIRM

224
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
CONFIRMATION OF WHETHER THEY

225
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
WERE ACTUALLY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
ALTHOUGH SOME OFFICIALS TONIGHT

226
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SAY THERE IS REASON TO THINK

227
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THAT SOME OF THEM WERE.

228
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
WE ARE TOLD, BY THE WAY, THAT

229
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
ONE OF THE TWO VICTIMS KILLED IN

230
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE EXPLOSION WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

231
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
BOSTON POLICE SAY THERE WAS NO

232
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE WARNING OF

233
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ANY KIND OF ATTACK.

234
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
FEDERAL OFFICIALS TONIGHT SAY

235
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT

236
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
THIS IS PART OF ANY LARGER

237
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THREAT.

238
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AT THIS POINT THEY BELIEVE IT IS

239
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
CONFINED TO BOSTON.

240
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BUT A MEETING TONIGHT WILL

241
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
DECIDE WHETHER ANY KIND OF

242
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
NATIONAL ALERT WILL BE SENT OUT.

243
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THERE IS NO SUSPECT IN CUSTODY,

244
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AUTHORITIES SAY.

245
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING

246
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
QUESTIONED INCLUDING SOME WITH

247
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
INJURIES WHO WERE TAKEN TO
BOSTON HOSPITALS.

248
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
ONE OF THOSE, A PERSON IN WHOM

249
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THERE IS SOME INTEREST IS A
YOUNG PERSON WHO WAS HERE ON A

250
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
STUDENT VISA.

251
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BRIAN?

252
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
>> PETE WILLIAMS IN OUR

WASHINGTON NEWSROOM.

254
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WE'LL LOOK FOR FURTHER DETAILS

255
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
FROM THERE.
PETE, THANKS.

IN WASHINGTON.

261
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
MICHAEL, TWO THINGS.

262
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
OVERSEAS VETERANS OF THE WARS

263
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THE PAST TEN YEARS AND THOSE OF

264

US WHO SPENT TIME THERE, NUMBER

265
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
ONE, THE PRIMARY EXPLOSION, THEN

266
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THE SECONDARY EXPLOSION AS

267
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING TO THE FIRST.

268
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
AND NUMBER TWO, THE NATURE OF

269
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THESE INJURIES.

270
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE APPARENTLY

271
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
WITH ADDED SHRAPNEL.

272
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
THAT HAUNTS EVERYBODY

273
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
INVOLVED.

274
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
>> YES, BRIAN.

275
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
THE IDEA OF USING TWO EXPLOSIVE

276
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
DEVICES, THE FIRST CHARGE WHICH

277
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
ATTRACTS TO SOME EXTENT THE

278
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
FIRST RESPONDERS -- POLICE,

279
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
FIRE, MEDICAL -- AND THEN HAVE A

280
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
SECOND CHARGE GO OFF THAT'S

281
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
TARGETING THOSE RESPONDERS

282
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
POTENTIALLY IS THE SIGN OF A

283
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACK.

284
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
AS YOU NOTED, THE SHRAPNEL, THE

285
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
IDEA THERE COULD HAVE BEEN BALL

286
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
BEARINGS OR SOMETHING ELSE IN

287
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000

TRYING TO KILL OR MAIM, NOT JUST

289
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
TRYING TO HAVE A SMALL EXPLOSION

290
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
AND GET SOME ATTRACTION.

291
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THE SIGN OF A TERRORIST

292
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
ORGANIZATION THAT'S TRYING TO
KILL PEOPLE.

293
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> HERE WE ARE IN THE POST 9/11

294
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
ERA.

295
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WHILE IT'S FAMILIAR NOW TO US IN

296
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
A KIND OF HIDEOUS WAY, IT ALSO

297
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
ISN'T.

298
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE

299
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN BIG CITIES
AND ESPECIALLY ON THE EAST

300
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
COAST, ARE GOING TO SEE

301
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
PRECAUTIONS AT TRAIN STATIONS

302
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AND AIRPORTS AND PERHAPS BIG
OBVIOUS MOVEMENT OF LAW

ENFORCEMENT, THERE IS NO REASON

304
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
TO FEAR THAT THIS IS ANY, AT

305
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
THIS HOUR, PART OF ANY WIDER

306
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
PLAN.

307
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
CORRECT?

308
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

309
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
PEOPLE SHOULD VIEW THE

310
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PRECAUTIONS IN WASHINGTON, NEW
YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES

311
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
MERELY AS PRECAUTIONS.

312
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL

313
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
GOVERNMENT AND STATES AND CITIES

314
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
PREPARE FOR IN THE EVENT OF AN

315
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
ATTACK.

316
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
HEIGHTENING BASIC PREPAREDNESS,

317
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
PUTTING MORE POLICE ON THE

318
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
SCENE.

319
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW

320
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

321
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
IT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS TO
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SHOW

322
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
OF FORCE AND SHOULD SOMETHING

323
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
ELSE ARISE THAT THEY ARE IN A

324
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
GOOD POSITION TO RESPOND.
BUT IT IS NOT THE SIGN OF A

325
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
SPECIFIC THREAT NECESSARILY.

>>> ACROSS TOWN WE GO TO THE

329
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
WHITE HOUSE.

330
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
CHUCK TODD WAS STANDING IN THE

331
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
BRIEFING ROOM WHEN THE PRESIDENT
ENTERED AT ABOUT 6:10 TONIGHT TO

332
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
GIVE HIS REMARKS ON WHAT THE

333
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
WHITE HOUSE WAS SAYING SO FAR.

334
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
CHUCK?

335
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
>> I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

336
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT

337
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
DID NOT SAY IS HE DID NOT CALL

338
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THIS TERRORISM.

339
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I CAN TELL YOU FROM TALKING TO

340
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
SOURCES THIS WAS DISCUSSED AND
THE DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO

341
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
HAVE THE PRESIDENT USE THAT

342
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
SPECIFIC WORD.

343
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
A NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL

344
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
E-MAILS AND SAYS THIS.

345
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
ANY EVENT WITH MULTIPLE

346
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AS THIS

347
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
APPEARS TO BE IS CLEARLY AN ACT

348
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
OF TERROR AND WILL BE APPROACHED

349
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
AS AN ACT OF TERROR.

350
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
HOWEVER WE DO NOT KNOW WHO

351
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK.

352
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WILL

353
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS PLANNED

354
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
AND CARRIED OUT BY A TERRORIST

355
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
GROUP, FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC.

356
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
THEY ARE CAREFUL WITH THEIR

357
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
LANGUAGE.

358
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

359
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
BRIEFED ALL DAY FROM THE FBI

360
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY

361
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
DIRECTOR, CHIEF TERRORISM

362
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
ADVISER.

363
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN GIVING

364
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
BRIEFINGS TO THE LEADERSHIP IN

365
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
CONGRESS.

366
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
BUT I CAN TELL YOU IN TALKING TO

367
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
OFFICIALS AROUND HERE, BRIAN,

368
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF

369
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
FRUSTRATION OF HOW LITTLE THEY

370
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
DO KNOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME

371
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS
CLEARLY BEING VERY CAREFUL WITH

372
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK

376
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
ABOUT THE NATION'S NEED TO

Outdoors, or in.

Transitions® lenses
automatically filter

383
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
just the right amount of light.

384
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So you see everything
the way it's meant to be seen.

385
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Maybe even a little better.

393
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
SOME LAXATIVES LIKE Dulcolax
CAN CAUSE CRAMPS.

394
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
BUT Phillips' Caplets
DON'T.

395
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
THEY HAVE MAGNESIUM.

396
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
FOR EFFECTIVE RELIEF
OF OCCASIONAL CONSTIPATION.

397

I'LL HAVE
MORE AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS

403
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THAN I'M EQUIPPED FOR,

404
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
BECAUSE I'M RAISING TWO GIRLS

405
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
ON MY OWN.

406
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE ECONOMY

MORE THAN A FEW TIMES
BEFORE THEY'RE GROWN.

408

BUT IT'S FOR THEM,

409
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
SO I'VE FOUND A WAY.

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000

[ Male Announcer ]
YOU'VE REACHED THE AGE

416
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
WHERE YOU DON'T BACK DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE.

417
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THIS IS THE AGE OF KNOWING
HOW TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

418
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
SO, WHY LET
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION

419
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
GET IN YOUR WAY?

420
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT VIAGRA.

421
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
20 MILLION MEN ALREADY HAVE.

422
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOUR HEART
IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

423
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA IF YOU TAKE
NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN;

424
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
IT MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE DROP
IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

425
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
HEADACHE, FLUSHING,

426
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
UPSET STOMACH,
AND ABNORMAL VISION.

427
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
FOR AN ERECTION
LASTING MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

429
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
STOP TAKING VIAGRA
AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

430
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
IF YOU EXPERIENCE
A SUDDEN DECREASE OR LOSS

431
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
IN VISION OR HEARING.

432
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
THIS IS THE AGE
OF TAKING ACTION.

VIAGRA.

434
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.

435
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
>>> WE ARE BACK TONIGHT.

436
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THIS IS THE SCENE AS IT

437
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
HAPPENED.
2:50 P.M. THIS AFTERNOON IN

438
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
BOSTON DURING THE MARATHON.

439
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
THERE IS THE EXPLOSION.

440
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
ONE RUNNER HIT BY SHRAPNEL GOES

441
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
DOWN.

442
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE.

443
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
BETWEEN THE POINT OF THE

444
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
EXPLOSION AND THE CROWD POLICE,

445
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
BOSTON EMS, RACE VOLUNTEERS WERE

446
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
CAUGHT UP IN IT.

447
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THEY WERE AMONG THE TARGETS.

448
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
SO HAVING SEEN THIS, HAVING

449
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
WITNESSED THIS, THE QUESTION

450
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
BECOMES HOW CAN WE EVER KEEP OUR

451
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
PUBLIC EVENTS SAFE IF SOMEONE

452
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
WAS ALLOWED TO GET TWO DEVICES

453
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
THIS CLOSE TO THIS CLASSIC A DAY

454
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS?

455
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
NBC'S TOM COSTELLO HAS BEEN

456
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
LOOKING AT THIS CONUNDRUM FOR

457
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
SECURITY PERSONNEL ALL DAY.

458
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
TOM, EVENING.
>> Reporter: HI, BRIAN.

459
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
WE TALK ABOUT HOW SECURITY

460
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
CHANGED AFTER 9/11.

461
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
AND IT DID.

462
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
BUT SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE BEEN

463
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
DEALING WITH TERRORIST THREATS

464
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
AT BIG GATHERINGS SINCE THE

465
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
MUNICH GAMES IN 1972.

466
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
TRYING TO ENSURE EVERYONE'S

467
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
SAFETY IS A HERCULEAN CHALLENGE.

468
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
FOR ANY POLICE AGENCY PLANNING

469
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
FOR BIG CROWDS MEANS MONTHS OF

470
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
NIGHTMARES.

471
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
SECURES AND STEALING A COURSE

472
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
LIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON WITH

473
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
20,000 RUNNERS AND HALF A

474
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
MILLION SPECTATORS IS ALMOST AN

475
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE.
BILL BRATTON WAS THE BOSTON

476
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000

477
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
LEADING THE NYPD AND THE LAPD.

478
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
>> IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY

479
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
DIFFICULT, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE,

480
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
THAT 26-MILE ROUTE.

481
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
DOUBLE IT, 52 THE MILES BECAUSE

482
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
YOU HAVE TWO SIDES OF THE

483
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
STREET.
MOST OF THE SECURITY WOULD BE

484
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
FOCUSED ON THE FINISH LINE AREA

485
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
WHERE THE ACTUAL BOMBING

486
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
OCCURRED.

IT WASN'T UNTIL 2003 THAT POLICE

492
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000

BEEN HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT.

>> YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING.

512
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
YOU REDUCE THE PROBABILITY TO

BIG SPORTING EVENTS LIKE THE

SUPER BOWL ORGANIZE OHHERS ARE

PUBLIC EVENT THAT COULD INVITE

535
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
AN ATTACK IS RESPOND REASONABLE.

GATHERING.

543
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE TERRORISTS

544
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
HAVE.
THEY CAN LOOK FOR THE SOFTEST,

545
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
LEAST DEFENDED AREA.

546
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000

REMOVED, EVEN THE MANHOLE COVERS

549
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
SCREWED DOWN.
THAT'S THE KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY

550
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
SECURITY YOU GET IN A

551
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
