[000:08:31;17] RICK, I WANT TO MENTION  
[000:08:32;09] THIS TO YOU.  
[000:08:33;06] MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE  
[000:08:33;29] A SHORT TIME AGO TWEETED  
[000:08:34;25] THE FOLLOWING.  
[000:08:35;16] AND THEY TALKED ABOUT  
[000:08:36;20] SUSPECT NUMBER 2 THAT YOU  
[000:08:39;08] WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.  
[000:08:40;10] SUSPECT NUMBER 2  
[000:08:41;22] HIGHLIGHTED AND PROFILED  
[000:08:43;09] THE TWEET READS NOTE  
[000:08:46;15] PRONOUNCED JAW NOSE, DARK  
[000:08:47;22] HAIR AND THEN 1-800-CALL  
[000:08:50;07] FBI WITH INFO.  
[000:08:54;23] THE POINT TO BE MADE HERE,  
[000:08:56;03] RICK, IS THAT THEY CANNOT  
[000:08:57;14] SOLVE THIS CASE WITHOUT  
[000:08:58;10] HELP FROM THE PUBLIC NOW  
[000:08:59;09] CAN THEY?  
[000:09:01;11] >> BY THE FACT THAT THEY  
[000:09:02;14] RELEASED THESE IMAGES AND  
[000:09:04;02] ARE ASKING FOR HELP.  
[000:09:05;13] OBVIOUSLY ANYONE WHO MAY  
[000:09:06;29] RECOGNIZE THEM SHOULD CALL  
[000:09:07;22] THE FBI.  
[000:09:08;06] THEY ARE GOING TO BE  
[000:09:09;04] GETTING A LOT OF FALSE  
[000:09:10;07] LEADS, BILL.  
[000:09:11;02] THEY HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH  
[000:09:12;01] THOSE OVER THE LAST FEW  
[000:09:13;20] DAYS.  
[000:09:14;03] THAT'S COMMON IN ANY  
[000:09:15;09] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:09:15;26] ESPECIALLY ONE THAT'S THIS  
[000:09:17;02] HIGH PROFILE.  
[000:09:18;17] BUT, YOU CAN SEE THESE  
[000:09:20;10] MEN'S FACES.  
[000:09:21;15] CAN YOU GET A PRETTY GOOD  
[000:09:22;08] LOOK AT THEM.  
[000:09:22;27] IF THEY SPENT ANY TIME IN  
[000:09:24;02] THE BOSTON AREA, OR ANY  
[000:09:25;28] TIME IN THE UNITED STATES,  
[000:09:30;09] THEN SOMEONE INTERACTED  
[000:09:31;06] WITH THEM.  
[000:09:32;00] ANY NUMBER OF PEOPLE MIGHT  
[000:09:33;05] RECOGNIZE THEM OR THINK  
[000:09:34;04] THEY KNOW THEM AND THAT'S  
[000:09:35;11] HOT FBI IS HOPING TO TALK  
[000:09:37;03] TO.  
[000:09:37;15] >> Bill: YEAH WITH  
[000:09:38;04] CATHERINE WORKING THE  
[000:09:38;25] STORY, TOO THROUGH HER  
[000:09:40;01] SOURCES IN WASHINGTON.  
[000:09:41;10] CATHERINE, IN SOME OF THESE  
[000:09:42;16] IMAGES, IT'S CLEAR THAT AT  
[000:09:44;13] LEAST SUSPECT NUMBER 2 IS  
[000:09:45;19] TALKING ON A PHONE.  
[000:09:46;16] ONE OF THE IMAGES IT LOOKS  
[000:09:48;01] LIKE SUSPECT NUMBER 1 IS  
[000:09:50;06] EAR PHONES IN HIS EARS AS  
[000:09:51;17] HE WALKS DOWN THAT  
[000:09:52;22] SIDEWALK.  
[000:09:53;07] BUT SPECIFICALLY ON THE  
[000:09:54;07] CELL PHONE EVIDENCE, IS IT  
[000:09:58;18] TRUE THEY CAN PIN POINT  
[000:09:59;21] EVERY CALL OF EVERY MOMENT  
[000:10:00;23] AT THAT HOUR OF THE DAY  
[000:10:02;04] FROM 2:00 TO 3:00 ON MONDAY  
[000:10:03;21] AFTERNOON AND IF THEY CAN  
[000:10:04;26] CAN THEY TRACE IT?  
[000:10:09;04] >>  
[000:10:09;15] >> WHAT WE REPORTED EARLIER  
[000:10:10;17] HERE AT FOX IS THAT THE FBI  
[000:10:11;27] WAS SCRUBBING OR SCANNING  
[000:10:13;07] THE CELL PHONE TOWER  
[000:10:14;11] RECORDS LOOKING FOR  
[000:10:15;26] POSITIVE HITS AT THE POINT  
[000:10:18;00] OF DETONATION.  
[000:10:19;01] IN OTHER WORDS WERE THERE  
[000:10:21;11] PHONE CALLS GOING THROUGH  
[000:10:22;14] CELL PHONE TOWERS AT THE  
[000:10:23;18] VERY MOMENTS THAT THEY KNOW  
[000:10:24;15] THE BOMBS WERE BEING  
[000:10:26;18] DETONATED, THEY CAN USE  
[000:10:27;12] THAT INFORMATION TO TRACE  
[000:10:28;05] IT BACK TO A PHONE NUMBER.  
[000:10:29;25] BUT ANY TERRORIST BECAUSE  
[000:10:30;25] THAT'S WHAT THESE TWO  
[000:10:31;23] PEOPLE ARE WORTH THEIR  
[000:10:34;14] SAWLTD SALT, IF THEY ARE  
[000:10:35;29] USING CELL PHONES FOR  
[000:10:38;11] DETONATION WOULD BE USING  
[000:10:40;10] DISPOSABLE CELL PHONES THAT  
[000:10:41;04] THEY PURCHASED AT  
[000:10:42;06] CONVENIENCE STORE.  
[000:10:42;25] EVEN FINDING THAT NUMBER IF  
[000:10:43;26] THAT WAS THE METHOD OF  
[000:10:45;12] DETONATION IS NOT  
[000:10:46;12] NECESSARILY GOING TO LEAD  
[000:10:47;05] BACK TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN  
[000:10:47;27] THIS CASE UNLESS YOU HAVE A  
[000:10:48;26] SUPER ALERT CONVENIENCE  
[000:10:50;21] STORE CLERK WHO MAY  
[000:10:51;21] REMEMBER THESE GUYS.  
[000:10:54;08] >> YEAH.  
[000:10:55;05] AND THE INVESTIGATION AS IT  
[000:10:56;16] MOVES FORWARD, YOU WONDER,  
[000:10:58;06] CATHERINE, WHY THE FBI WAS  
[000:11:00;10] QUIET FOR TWO DAYS.  
[000:11:02;13] IS THERE A REASONABLE  
[000:11:04;04] EXPLANATION OR WHAT ARE WE  
[000:11:05;05] HEARING ABOUT WHAT EXPLAINS  
[000:11:06;15] THAT OVER THE PAST 48  
[000:11:09;13] HOURS?  
[000:11:09;27] >> THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED AN  
[000:11:11;17] EXPLANATION.  
[000:11:12;03] BUT I THINK RICK WOULD  
[000:11:12;28] AGREE WITH ME THAT OUR  
[000:11:14;01] EXPERIENCE WOULD TELL YOU  
[000:11:14;24] THAT THINGS WERE MOVING AT  
[000:11:16;10] A VERY FAST PACE AND IT WAS  
[000:11:18;14] EXTREMELY FLUID.  
[000:11:19;02] THE DECISION TO RELEASE THE  
[000:11:21;02] PICTURES HAS BENEFITS.  
[000:11:22;24] IF THE SUBJECTS ARE  
[000:11:23;29] IDENTIFIED, BUT THEY ARE  
[000:11:24;25] ALSO RISKS BECAUSE IT TIPS  
[000:11:26;24] THE FBI'S HAT TO THESE  
[000:11:28;14] INDIVIDUALS AND IT MAKE  
[000:11:31;07] CAUSE SOME TO FLEE.  
[000:11:32;18] BUT IF WE WANT TO SORT OF  
[000:11:34;07] LOOK AT WHAT I THINK IS THE  
[000:11:35;15] LEADING EDGE OF THIS STORY  
[000:11:36;19] NOW IS THAT THERE ARE TWO  
[000:11:38;22] INDIVIDUALS, BUT THEY HAD  
[000:11:39;15] TO HAVE SOME KIND OF HELP.  
[000:11:41;18] IT WOULD BE CALLED A  
[000:11:42;21] SUPPORT NETWORK FOR THEIR  
[000:11:44;24] OPERATIONS IN BOSTON.  
[000:11:46;14] WERE THESE PEOPLE PART OF  
[000:11:48;09] THE CONSPIRACY OR WAS --  
[000:11:49;27] WERE THEY SORT OF  
[000:11:53;02] UNWITTINGLY HELPING THESE  
[000:11:54;03] INDIVIDUALS, BILL?  
[000:11:55;10] >> Bill: TO THAT POINT  
[000:11:56;08] CATHERINE, THE FBI AGENT IN  
[000:11:57;16] CHARGE, AND I WILL BRING  
[000:11:58;25] RICK IN FOR A COMMENT ON  
[000:11:59;23] THIS AS WELL.  
[000:12:00;25] BE  
[000:12:01;29] DIFFICULT BUT PLEASE COME  
[000:12:02;29] FORWARD.  
[000:12:03;13] ESSENTIALLY, RICK, THAT WAS  
[000:12:04;13] AN APPEAL TO FAMILY OR  
[000:12:05;18] FRIENDS THAT YOU MAY KNOW  
[000:12:06;26] THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT WE  
[000:12:07;20] NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY'RE  
[000:12:09;02] AND DON'T HOLD BACK.  
[000:12:11;24] >> AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE  
[000:12:13;08] REMINDED OF THE HORRORS OF  
[000:12:14;15] THAT DAY AND THE PAIN AND  
[000:12:17;27] ANGUISH AND AWFUL INJURIES  
[000:12:18;24] THAT THESE TWO SUSPECTS  
[000:12:20;25] ALLEGEDLY INFLICTED.  
[000:12:21;15] I MEAN SOMEBODY PUT THESE  
[000:12:22;21] BOMBS DOWN THERE AND THE  
[000:12:23;21] FBI SEEMS PRETTY SURE THAT  
[000:12:25;12] IT'S THESE TWO GUYS.  
[000:12:26;25] BILL, ONE OTHER THING, A  
[000:12:27;26] LOT OF-LY TO HAS BEEN A LOT  
[000:12:29;06] OF CRITICISM ABOUT ALL OF  
[000:12:30;09] THESE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS  
[000:12:31;15] POSTED AROUND ALL OF THESE  
[000:12:32;17] BIG CITIES IN AMERICA.  
[000:12:33;26] IF THOSE CAMERAS WEREN'T  
[000:12:36;01] THERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE  
[000:12:36;26] THE IMAGES OF THESE TWO  
[000:12:38;04] GUYS AND IT WOULD BE A LOT  
[000:12:39;19] HARDER TO TRACK THEM DOWN.  
[000:12:40;26] >> RICK, THANK YOU FOR  
[000:12:42;08] THAT.  
[000:12:42;21] RICK LEVENTHAL.

[000:13:04;07] MARATHON ATTACKS THAT LEFT  
[000:13:05;21] THREE PEOPLE DEAD, MORE  
[000:13:08;22] THAN 170 WOUNDED AND A CITY  
[000:13:10;21] AND A NATION THAT IS

[000:16:34;29] WITH ME NOW TERRY FORMER

[000:17:05;22] PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN.  
[000:17:06;22] SO IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO  
[000:17:07;18] THE PUBLIC.

[000:17:25;13] BOSTON LAW ENFORCEMENT.  
[000:17:26;06] NOW THE FOCUS IS ON THESE  
[000:17:27;14] FACES AND THESE TWO PEOPLE.  
[000:17:29;25] AND THE THEY KEPT STRESSING  
[000:17:31;15] THAT THINK ABOUT THESE TWO  
[000:17:32;19] PEOPLE AND IF YOU WERE IN  
[000:17:34;23] TOWN, IF YOU WERE ON ROADS  
[000:17:36;03] HIGHWAYS LEADING INTO TOWN,  
[000:17:38;01] LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE, IF  
[000:17:39;01] YOU WERE LEASING ROOMS TO  
[000:17:42;28] PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THESE  
[000:17:44;17] FACES.  
[000:17:45;00] ABOUT D. THESE PEOPLE STAY  
[000:17:45;24] WITH YOU IN A ROOM.  
[000:17:46;20] RENT A ROOM MAYBE TWICE IN  
[000:17:47;15] THE LAST FEW WEEKS.  
[000:17:49;00] IF THEY DID CALL.  
[000:17:51;19] WHEN WE WENT BACK AND  
[000:17:53;00] STARTING INVESTIGATED THE  
[000:17:54;04] "U.S.S. COLE" BOMBING, THE  
[000:17:55;06] BAD GUYS HAD LEASED A ROOM  
[000:17:56;15] HAD A SAFE HOUSE NOT FARM  
[000:17:58;26] FROM THE HARBOR.  
[000:17:59;22] WE KNOW THESE KIND OF  
[000:18:00;25] THINGS OCCUR.  
[000:18:01;16] IF YOU ARE A BUS DRIVER, IF  
[000:18:03;10] YOU RENT CARS, IF YOU WORK  
[000:18:04;13] AT A GAS STATION OR A  
[000:18:05;23] COFFEE SHOP, WE KNOW THAT  
[000:18:09;13] THEODORE KOSINSKI GOT ON A  
[000:18:10;24] BUS WITH UNSTABLE BOMBS AND  
[000:18:12;15] WENT FROM POINT A TO POINT  
[000:18:14;15] B.  
[000:18:14;26] ERIC RUDOLPH TOOK HIS CAR  
[000:18:15;25] AND LEFT THE SCENE OF THE  
[000:18:18;02] CRIME.  
[000:18:18;15] WE KNOW WHAT THESE PEOPLE  
[000:18:19;12] DO.  
[000:18:19;24] NOW WE HAVE TO FOCUS THE  
[000:18:21;10] PUBLIC AND FOCUS THEM ON A  
[000:18:23;10] MAN'S DAILY ROUTINE AND A  
[000:18:25;02] MAN'S DAILY BEHAVIOR.  
[000:18:27;16] EVEN THOUGH THESE TERRIBLE  
[000:18:29;15] CRIMES COMMITTED.  
[000:18:31;04] THESE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN  
[000:18:32;03] CRIMES BEFORE THEY CAME TO  
[000:18:33;15] BOSTON.  
[000:18:33;29] LOOK AT THESE FACES LOOK  
[000:18:35;26] AT THESE PEOPLE.  
[000:18:36;15] LOOK AT THESE CAPS.  
[000:18:37;12] I THINK I HEARD EARLIER ONE  
[000:18:39;01] OF YOUR REPORTERS EARLIER  
[000:18:40;25] MENTIONED THINK ABOUT THE  
[000:18:42;00] CAPS.  
[000:18:42;13] THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BOUGHT  
[000:18:43;06] IN THE VICINITY.  
[000:18:44;05] MAYBE IN THE VICINITY OF A  
[000:18:45;02] HOTEL WHERE THESE GUYS  
[000:18:46;17] STAYED.  
[000:18:47;01] IF YOU ARE IN ANY OF THOSE  
[000:18:48;04] PROFESSIONS OR OCCUPATIONS

[000:19:00;18] THESE IMAGES ARE OUT THERE  
[000:19:02;10] NOW OR PERHAPS THE BETTER  
[000:19:03;12] PART OF THAT QUESTION IS  
[000:19:04;25] WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT  
[000:19:08;00] WHERE THEY ARE IN THIS  
[000:19:08;29] INVESTIGATION?  
[000:19:09;16] >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL I AM

[000:19:20;01] WAS WORKING ON UNIBOMB  
[000:19:22;00] THEY ARE INTO AND  
[000:19:23;02] UNDERSTAND HOW TO UTILIZE  
[000:19:25;08] AND COMMUNICATE TO THE  
[000:19:26;09] PUBLIC THROUGH THE MEDIA.  
[000:19:27;17] AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A  
[000:19:29;16] LOT OF CONSTERNATION OVER  
[000:19:31;24] WHY NOW OR WHATEVER.  
[000:19:33;05] LOOK, THEY HAD THESE  
[000:19:34;28] PICTURES.  
[000:19:35;13] THEY DEVELOPED THEM AND NOW  
[000:19:36;07] THEY ARE TRYING TO FOCUS  
[000:19:37;14] PEOPLE ON TAKING THEM DOWN  
[000:19:38;18] THE TRAIL OF WHERE THESE  
[000:19:39;22] PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE COME FROM AND WHERE
[000:19:40;27] HO THEY MIGHTE.  
[000:19:43;27] >> Bill: UNDERSTOOD.  
[000:19:44;17] SOMEONE FROM THE PUBLIC HAS  
[000:19:45;12] TO COME FORWARD NOW.  
[000:19:46;05] IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY STILL  
[000:19:47;07] NEED THE PUBLIC'S HELP IN  
[000:19:49;24] .

[000:22:38;20] THERE IN NEW YORK.  
[000:22:39;16] IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS  
[000:22:40;12] HOW CRITICAL AND VITAL AT  
[000:22:41;27] THIS POINT IN THE

[000:23:07;05] THAT IS INCOWERFUL  
[000:23:09;01] CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

[000:23:13;15] BILL.  
[000:23:13;28] >> Bill: WELL, THAT IS  
[000:23:14;25] INTERESTING.  
[000:23:15;07] BECAUSE THE FBI SAID THAT  
[000:23:16;29] COMMENT TONIGHT ABOUT  
[000:23:18;01] SUSPECT NUMBER 2.  
[000:23:18;20] AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE  
[000:23:21;19] VIDEOTAPE EVIDENCE OF H
[000:23:22;10] LEAVING THAT BOMB AT THE  
[000:23:23;15] SCENE.  
[000:23:24;01] NOW, WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE  
[000:23:25;04] COULD BE IMPORTANT HERE,  
[000:23:28;19] GREG?  
[000:23:29;02] >> Greg: THE DEBRIS FIELD  
[000:23:29;25] IS A WEALTH OF DIRECT  
[000:23:34;04] EVIDENCE BECAUSE IN  
[000:23:34;27] PARTICULAR THEY MAY BE AGE  
[000:23:36;05] TO IDENTIFY THE LABORATORY  
[000:23:38;21] UNDERWRITER ON ONE OR MORE  
[000:23:39;23] OF THE PRESSURE COOKERS  
[000:23:40;29] THAT COULD LEAD TO WHERE IT   THE
[000:23:42;21] PEOPLE WHO  
[000:23:43;15] PURCHASED IT.  
[000:23:44;14] 1993 IN THE WORLD TRADE  
[000:23:45;16] CENTER BOMBING, IT WAS A  
[000:23:47;03] SMALL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

[000:23:57;04] THEY NABBED THE KILLERS.  
[000:23:59;01] >> Bill: AS WE MOVE  
[000:23:59;27] FORWARD, IF THERE IS AN  
[000:24:01;03] ARREST, IF THERE IS AN  
[000:24:02;23] APPREHENSION, WH  
[000:24:03;15] CHARGES COULD BE FILED IN A  
[000:24:06;07] CASE LIKE THIS?  
[000:24:07;00] >> THE FEDS COULD FILE  
[000:24:08;19] TERRORISM CHARGES AGAINST  
[000:24:09;22] THESE SUSPECTS.  
[000:24:11;02] THAT IS, YOU KNOW, AN ACT  
[000:24:12;12] OF VIOLENCE INTENDED TO  
[000:24:14;02] COERCE THE GOVERNMENT OR  
[000:24:15;22] INTIMIDATE THE GENERAL  
[000:24:17;11] POPULATION.  
[000:24:17;28] THAT CARRIES THE DEATH  
[000:24:20;06] PENALTY AS WELL AS  
[000:24:20;28] EXPLODING A WEAPON OF MASS  
[000:24:23;10] DESTRUCTION.  
[000:24:23;26] THE STATE COULD CHARGE,  
[000:24:26;25] MURDER CHARGES UP TO 200  
[000:24:28;28] ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES  
[000:24:29;20] BUT, REMEMBER,  
[000:24:31;12] MASSACHUSETTS ABOLISHED THE  
[000:24:32;14] DEATH PENALTY IN 1984, SO  
[000:24:34;15] ONLY THE FEDS CAN SEEK  
[000:24:36;06] DEATH.

[000:31:14;24] PUBLIC, ARE THEY NOT?  
[000:31:16;28] >> THEY ARE.  
[000:31:17;16] AND THE BAD NEWS WHEN YOU  
[000:31:18;18] HEAR THEM GOING PUBLIC,

[000:31:21;09] HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THE  
[000:31:22;22] LEADS THEY HAD TO THIS  
[000:31:23;19] POINT AND THEY DON'T KNOW  
[000:31:24;27] EXACTLY WHO THESE  
[000:31:25;20] INDIVIDUALS ARE.  
[000:31:26;22] BUT YOU HEARD FROM THE FEDS  
[000:31:27;16] VERY CLEARLY IN THIS PRESS  
[000:31:29;05] CONFERENCE THAT SOMEONE OUT  
[000:31:30;08] THERE KNOWS WHO THESE  
[000:31:31;15] INDIVIDUALS ARE.  
[000:31:32;19] THE IMAGES ARE VERY CLEAR  
[000:31:35;02] THAT THEY HAVE DISPLAYED.

[000:31:37;27] WITH THE PROLIFERATION WITH  
[000:31:40;06] CAMERAS, SECURITY CAMERAS  
[000:31:41;24] iPHONE CAMERAS THAT ARE

[000:31:45;28] THESE PEOPLE.  
[000:31:50;21] WHEN THAT KIND OF THING  
[000:31:51;20] COMES OUT.  
[000:31:52;05] SOMEONE KNOWS WHO THEY'RE.  
[000:31:53;20] THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT YOU  
[000:31:54;20] NOW HAVE TO COMPETE WITH  
[000:31:56;19] ALL OF THE BAD IMAGES  
[000:31:58;19] FLOATING AROUND ON THE  
[000:31:59;11] INTERNET.  
[000:32:01;28] FOR CLARITY THESE IMAGES

[000:32:12;26] THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION IN  
[000:32:13;25] THE WRONG DIRECTION AND  
[000:32:17;02] CREATE UNDUE WORK FOR VITAL  
[000:32:19;03] RESOURCES.  
[000:32:19;18] >> THE BLAST LOCATION HERE

[000:32:23;11] VERY MUCH AN ACTIVE CRIME  
[000:32:25;04] SCENE.  
[000:32:25;17] INVESTIGATORS COULD BE

[000:32:29;23] WEARING THE WHITE SUITS.  
[000:32:30;25] PULLING UP PIECES OF THE  
[000:32:32;24] ASPHALT.  
[000:32:33;08] THE LITTLE BITS OF EVIDENCE  
[000:32:34;05] THEY PULL FROM THAT BECOME  
[000:32:36;00] PIECES TO THE PUZZLE.  
[000:32:36;28] ONCE YOU HAVE THE SUSPECTS,  
[000:32:38;06] THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE  
[000:32:39;10] FALL TOGETHER.

[000:32:44;11] THAT COMMENT THAT WAS MADE  
[000:32:45;22] BY THE FBI I THINK IS SO  
[000:32:49;08] TELLING.  
[000:32:49;22] WE HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF  
[000:32:50;25] SUSPECT NUMBER 2 LEAVING A  
[000:32:52;16] BACKPACK AT THE SCENE OF  
[000:32:53;08] HIS SECOND EXPLOSION YOU  
[000:33:02;15] THINK ABOUT THE COMMENT AND  
[000:33:03;10] WHERE THE PRESS CONFERENCE  
[000:33:04;21] STARTED.  
[000:33:05;05] WE HAD A SINGLE PERSON OF  
[000:33:06;07] INTEREST AND WE WERE  
[000:33:07;02] WORKING TO CONFIRM WHETHER  
[000:33:07;29] OR NOT THIS PERSON WAS  
[000:33:08;28] WORKING BY HIMSELF OR WITH  
[000:33:10;02] SOMEONE ELSE.  
[000:33:10;23] MAYBE ANOTHER PERSON MAYBE  
[000:33:15;06] A THIRD PERSON AT THE  
[000:33:16;04] SCENE.  
[000:33:16;17] IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE  
[000:33:17;17] INVESTIGATION WORKED FROM  
[000:33:18;10] THE POINT OF THE EXPLOSION  
[000:33:19;03] AND WORKED ITS OUTWARD.  
[000:33:21;05] AND NOW WE HAVE TWO IMAGES  
[000:33:22;27] THAT ARE NOW PUBLIC.  
[000:33:25;15] MIKE?

[000:33:31;20] PUBLIC APPEAL, HAVE YOU  
[000:33:32;20] IMAGES THIS GOOD.

[000:33:35;13] THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS  
[000:33:36;19] SAY.  
[000:33:37;01] SOMEONE OUT THERE KNOWS WHO  
[000:33:37;25] THEY ARE.  
[000:33:38;14] THEY PUT OUT A WORD OF  
[000:33:39;17] CAUTION AS THEY HAVE TO AN  
[000:33:41;18] EXTENT.  
[000:33:42;02] DEPOSIT PEW ADVERTISE THE

[000:33:45;13] KILLED THUS FAR.

[000:33:49;01] THEY INDEED ARE  
[000:33:50;06] RESPONSIBLE.  
[000:33:50;22] THEY ARE VIOLENT.  
[000:33:51;12] YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THEY'RE  
[000:33:52;06] VIOLENT AND THE FEDERAL  
[000:33:53;29] INVESTIGATORS WANT TO GET  
[000:33:54;22] INFORMATION ABOUT THESE

[000:34:50;12] OF 2010.  
[000:34:50;28] POLICE HAVE VIDEO OF HIM.  
[000:34:52;05] THEY HAD AN I.D.  
[000:34:53;10] THEY DID NOT FEEL IT  
[000:34:56;02] NECESSARY TO PUT THAT OUT  
[000:34:57;19] PUBLICLY.  
[000:34:58;04] THEY SIMPLY TAILED HIM.  
[000:34:59;00] HE THEY PUT HIM ON A NO FLY

[000:41:46;29] >> Bill: PEOPLE SAY THEY  
[000:41:47;21] HEARD AND FELT THE  
[000:41:49;13] EXPLOSION ABOUT 50 MILES  
[000:41:50;20] AWAY.  
[000:41:51;03] JUST THINK ABOUT THAT  
[000:41:51;27] NEIGHBORS SAY IT BLEW THEM  
[000:41:52;29] RIGHT OFF THEIR FEET,  
[000:41:54;11] LEVELING HOMES AND  
[000:41:55;00] BUSINESSES IN A FOUR BLOCK  
[000:41:56;18] AREA SURROUNDING THAT  
[000:41:57;09] PLANT.  
[000:41:58;01] >> IT PICKED US UP AND  
[000:42:00;09] THREW US DOWN ON THE  
[000:42:01;23] GROUND.  
[000:42:02;07] IT BLEW THE SHRUBS THAT I  
[000:42:03;09] HAVE DOWN ON MY HOUSE  
[000:42:08;15] PARALLEL.  
[000:42:09;00] IT UP SOUND THE LIKE  
[000:42:10;09] PEBBLES BEING THROWN  
[000:42:11;29] THROUGH THE AIR IT WAS  
[000:42:13;27] HORRIFIC.  
[000:42:14;12] >> I WAS PICKED UP AND  
[000:42:16;00] THROWN.  
[000:42:16;14] I WENT UPSTAIRS.  
[000:42:17;07] IF I HADN'T, THE COUCH THAT  
[000:42:18;01] I HAD BEEN ON WHEN I CAME  
[000:42:19;08] DOWN, I LOOKED AT IT, THE  
[000:42:20;20] COUCH WASN'T THERE.  
[000:42:23;21] IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF A  
[000:42:24;25] BIG BAY WINDOW AND IT WAS  
[000:42:26;11] SHREDDED FROM THE GLASS  
[000:42:27;03] FROM THE BAY WINDOW.  
[000:42:27;24] IF I HAD BEEN ON THAT  
[000:42:28;27] COUCH, I WOULD BE DEAD.  
[000:42:30;19] >> HE IS ONE LUCKY MAN.  
[000:42:32;02] HERE IS A LOOK AT HOW FAR  
[000:42:34;05] THE DEVASTATION EXTENDED.  
[000:42:35;16] POLICE SAY THE BLAST

[000:43:45;11] EMERGENCY SERVICES AND HOW  
[000:43:46;11] THEY RESPONDED IN THE  
[000:43:48;11] IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE  
[000:43:49;04] NEWS OF THE EXPLOSION  
[000:43:51;27] TAKING PLACE THE  
[000:43:54;27] AUTHORITIES HERE SAYING  
[000:43:55;20] THEY ARE DOING ABSOLUTELY  
[000:43:56;28] EVERYTHING THEY CAN.  
[000:43:57;18] A FOUR BLOCK AREA.  
[000:43:58;10] A LARGE AREA FOR THEM TO  
[000:43:59;11] HAVE TO DEAL WITH.  
[000:44:00;11] THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE  
[000:44:02;04] BELIEVED TO BE EITHER  
[000:44:03;12] BURIED ALIVE OR MANY OF  
[000:44:04;08] THEM SUSPECTED NOW AFTER  
[000:44:06;08] THIS AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE  
[000:44:07;16] DEAD BILL.  
[000:44:09;00] >> Bill: WOW, YOU LOOK AT  
[000:44:09;23] THESE HOMES AND YOU HOW  
[000:44:10;27] THEY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED AND  
[000:44:11;25] YOU IMAGINE THE FORCE OF  
[000:44:12;23] THAT BLAST AND THE HEAT  
[000:44:13;18] THAT CAME OFF THAT PLANT AS  
[000:44:15;11] WELL.  
[000:44:15;24] WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT  
[000:44:16;17] WHAT CAUSED THIS.  
[000:44:17;21] DO WE KNOW AT THIS POINT?  
[000:44:19;25] ARE WE ANY CLOSER TO THAT  
[000:44:21;12] ANSWER DOMINIC?  
[000:44:23;03] >> WHAT CAUSED THE BLAST  
[000:44:24;16] WELL IT APPEARS THAT WHEN  
[000:44:26;11] FIREFIGHTERS ATTENDED A  
[000:44:27;04] FIRE AT THE SCENE EARLIER  
[000:44:28;05] IN THE EVENING.  
[000:44:28;28] THEY STARTED POURING WATER.  
[000:44:30;11] THIS WAS AMMONIUM FACTORY.  
[000:44:34;15] WHEN AMMONIUM IS MIXED WITH  
[000:44:36;08] WATER IT BECOMES VERY  
[000:44:37;26] HAZARDOUS, THAT'S VERY MUCH  
[000:44:38;27] KNOWN.  
[000:44:39;10] THE SUSPICION AT THIS TIME  
[000:44:40;03] IS THAT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF  
[000:44:40;27] THE EXPLOSION.  
[000:44:41;18] WHAT WAS CAUSE OF THE  
[000:44:42;19] ORIGINAL FIRE, WE DON'T  
[000:44:43;15] ACTUALLY KNOW.  
[000:44:44;03] BACK IN JANUARY THERE WAS A  
[000:44:45;07] REPORT THAT THERE HAD BEEN  
[000:44:47;17] THE FACT THE PLANT HAD BEEN  
[000:44:49;17] BURNING PALLETS AND BRUSH  
[000:44:50;29] AND THEY HADN'T NOTIFIED  
[000:44:51;29] THE AUTHORITIES AND THAT A  
[000:44:53;00] LOCAL SCHOOL WAS EVACUATED  
[000:44:54;07] AS A RESULT OF THAT NO  
[000:44:55;05] DOUBT THE AUTHORITIES  
[000:44:56;01] LOOKING INTO WHETHER THERE  
[000:44:57;01] IS ANYTHING IN THAT AT ALL.  
[000:44:58;21] AT THIS TIME THEY STILL  
[000:44:59;13] DON'T KNOW.  
[000:44:59;29] BACK TO YOU, BILL.  
[000:45:01;11] >> Bill: THAT IS A  
[000:45:02;04] NIGHTMARE OF LIVING HELL  
[000:45:02;27] LAST NIGHT.  
[000:45:04;25] DOMINIC DI-NATALE, THANK

[000:45:20;12] INDIVIDUALIAN CULT DIED  
[000:45:21;04] THERE IN A HIGHLY  
[000:45:23;24] CONTROVERSIAL STANDOFF WITH  
[000:45:24;27] FEDERAL AGENTS.  
[000:45:25;15] THEY ATTEMPTED TO CARRY OUT  
[000:45:26;26] A SEARCH WARRANT.  
[000:45:27;15] WHAT FOLLOWED WAS A 50 DAY  
[000:45:29;01] SIEGE THAT ENDED WHEN THE  
[000:45:29;26] FEDS RAIDED THE PLACE AND  
[000:45:31;23] THE CULT'S COMPOUND BURNED  
[000:45:33;25] TO THE GROUND.  
[000:45:35;04] ALMOST EVERYONE INSIDE DIED  
[000:45:36;28] INCLUDING 20 CHILDREN.  
[000:45:37;19] THIS WEEK ALSO MARKS 66  
[000:45:39;09] YEARS SINCE THE DEADLIEST  
[000:45:41;13] INDUSTRIAL DISASTER IN OUR  
[000:45:42;24] NATION'S HISTORY.  
[000:45:43;20] IT ALSO HAPPENED IN THE  
[000:45:44;17] STATE OF TEXAS OUTSIDE OF  
[000:45:46;18] HOUSTON.  
[000:45:47;02] A FIRE ON BOARD A SHIP FULL  
[000:45:48;15] OF FERTILIZER KILLED NEAR  
[000:45:50;18] 600 THERE.  
[000:45:51;12] THAT BLAST ALSO BLEW TWO  
[000:45:53;04] SMALL PLANES OUT OF THE SKY  
[000:45:55;10] AND CAUSED A 15-FOOT TITLED  
[000:45:59;18] TIDAL WAVE.  
[000:46:00;07] MANY OF THE VICTIMS OUTSIDE  
[000:46:01;01] OF HOUSTON THAT DAY WERE  
[000:46:02;05] NEVER FOUND.  
[000:46:03;18] BACK TO THE BREAKING NEWS  
[000:46:04;11] OF THE DAY HERE IN BOSTON.  
[000:46:05;18] THE HUNT FOR THE TWO  
[000:46:06;21] SUSPECTS FROM THE BOMBING  
[000:46:08;22] HERE.  
[000:46:09;05] AND IN A MOMENT WE WILL  
[000:46:09;28] TALK WITH ONE FORMER FBI  
[000:46:11;10] MAN WHO KNOWS A WHOLE ABOUT  
[000:46:13;11] TRACKING DOWN TERRORIST  
[000:46:14;21] SUSPECTS.  
[000:46:15;06] ONE TIME TOP AGENT IN NEW  
[000:46:16;11] YORK CITY.  
[000:46:17;20] THAT'S NEXT AS FOX REPORTS  
[000:46:19;20] LIVE TONIGHT AGAIN ON THIS  
[000:46:21;28] THURSDAY NIGHT IN BOSTON.
[000:48:55;27] >> Bill: CONTINUING  
[000:48:57;13] COVERAGE NOW THE BREAKING  
[000:48:58;06] NEWS WE ARE WATCHING  
[000:48:58;26] TONIGHT IN BOSTON.  
[000:48:59;15] THE FBI ASKING FOR HELP NOW  
[000:49:00;09] TRACKING DOWN TWO SUSPECTS  
[000:49:01;09] IN MONDAY'S BOMBINGS AT THE  
[000:49:03;00] MARATHON HERE IN BOSTON.  
[000:49:04;07] BILL GOOD AFTERNOON FORMER  
[000:49:06;12] ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN  
[000:49:07;03] CHARGE THE FBI IN NEW YORK  
[000:49:08;12] NOW MAKES HIM HOME HERE IN  
[000:49:11;02] NEW YORK.  
[000:49:11;23] WE SPOKE 11 HOURS AGO IN  
[000:49:13;17] AMERICA'S NEWSROOM ABOUT  
[000:49:14;09] WHAT COULD COME NEXT FROM  
[000:49:15;03] THE FBI.  
[000:49:15;25] IS THIS WHAT YOU EXPECTED?  
[000:49:18;05] >> YES BILL, IT IS WHAT I  
[000:49:20;04] EXPECTED THAT THE PHOTOS  
[000:49:20;26] WOULD BE RELEASED BECAUSE  
[000:49:24;23] IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG TO  
[000:49:26;04] SIFT THROUGH THE WHOLE  
[000:49:27;27] CO-LODGE OF PHOTOS THEY HAD  
[000:49:29;00] AND FILM ALL THE WAY BEFORE  
[000:49:31;04] THE FINISH LINE TO THE  
[000:49:32;01] FINISH LINE.  
[000:49:32;23] BILL, THE IMPORTANT THING  
[000:49:33;19] RIGHT NOW IS THAT ANYBODY  
[000:49:34;16] THAT WAS IN THE AREA AFTER  
[000:49:36;06] THE FINISH LINE OUGHT TO BE  
[000:49:38;04] LOOKING AT THEIR FILM THAT  
[000:49:39;17] THEY THOUGHT WAS IRRELEVANT  
[000:49:40;25] PRIOR TO THIS EVENT BECAUSE  
[000:49:42;26] THESE INDIVIDUALS DROPPED  
[000:49:44;17] THE BOMBS ON THE STREET AND  
[000:49:45;27] KEPT ON WALKING.  
[000:49:47;11] SO, RIGHT BEYOND THEM DOWN  
[000:49:49;03] BOYLSTON STREET WE HAVE  
[000:49:50;28] SUBWAY ENTRANCES TO TWO  
[000:49:52;04] DIFFERENT SUBWAY STATIONS  
[000:49:52;27] AND PEOPLE COULD HAVE SEEN  
[000:49:54;05] THEM GOING INTO THE SUBWAY  
[000:49:57;24] STATION PEOPLE COULD HAVE  
[000:49:58;23] BEEN TAKING PICTURES FROM  
[000:49:59;20] BEYOND THE FINISH LINE AND  
[000:50:01;06] SEEN THESE FOLKS THERE.  
[000:50:02;13] THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR  
[000:50:03;06] THEM TO LOOK AT THE FILM  
[000:50:04;19] AGAIN IF THEY HAD ANYTHING.  
[000:50:06;24] >> Bill: THAT'S A GREAT  
[000:50:07;16] POINT THERE IS A SUBWAY  
[000:50:10;02] STOP 30 YARDS WHERE WE ARE  
[000:50:11;00] GOING TONIGHT IN BOYLSTON  
[000:50:12;09] STREET.  
[000:50:14;14] BILL, YOU HAVE WORKED THESE  
[000:50:15;10] STORIES AND BEEN IN THOSE  
[000:50:16;16] INVESTIGATIVE ROOMS.  
[000:50:17;07] WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE THAT  
[000:50:18;01] WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN?  
[000:50:19;11] >> WELL, I THINK BILL,  
[000:50:21;00] PROBABLY YOU ARE NOT GOING  
[000:50:21;23] TO COME OUT AND TELL THE  
[000:50:23;08] PUBLIC EVERYTHING THAT YOU  
[000:50:24;05] HAVE.  
[000:50:24;18] YOU NORTH GOING TO HIDE  
[000:50:26;01] EVERYTHING TO TRY TO FOOL  
[000:50:27;00] THE PUBLIC BUT WHAT YOU ARE  
[000:50:28;07] GOING TO DO IS KEEP SOME  
[000:50:30;05] THINGS IN RESERVE THAT ONLY  
[000:50:32;04] SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW WHO HAD  
[000:50:33;21] BEEN THERE.  
[000:50:34;16] THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN  
[000:50:36;09] IS, THEY NEED TO -- THEY  
[000:50:38;01] NEED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING  
[000:50:40;08] THAT IS THERE.  
[000:50:41;03] AND SOME OF THESE THINGS  
[000:50:42;04] THEY ARE USING TO FILTER  
[000:50:44;18] SOME OF THE CALLS THAT ARE  
[000:50:45;14] COMING IN.  
[000:50:46;06] THEY ARE GETTING THOUSANDS  
[000:50:46;29] OF CALLS RIGHT NOW.  
[000:50:47;27] THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT  
[000:50:48;23] THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVEN'T  
[000:50:51;15] PUT OUT WHEREBY THEY COULD  
[000:51:03;09] DISCOUNT SOME THE CALLS  
[000:51:04;04] THEY THAT THEY ARE  
[000:51:05;26] RECEIVING.  
[000:51:06;11] >> Bill: THEY HAD TO BE RED  
[000:51:07;05] JR. TO THE ENACT THAT THEY  
[000:51:07;28] COULD GET AN ABSOLUTE AFTER  
[000:51:12;16] LANCASTER OF -- AFTER    --  
[000:51:18;17] AVALANCHE.  
[000:51:19;02] HAVE YOU BEEN THERE SINCE  
[000:51:19;27] THE BEGINNING LIKE THE  
[000:51:22;07] ENERGIZER BUNNY.  
[000:51:22;25] THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY  
[000:51:23;18] HAVE A TO BE OF PEOPLE IN  
[000:51:24;21] RESERVE AND HAVE THESE  
[000:51:26;01] ELECTRONIC THINGS SET UP.  
[000:51:26;27] THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE  
[000:51:27;29] TO TAKE THE CALLS IN THE  
[000:51:29;14] BOSTON AREA.  
[000:51:30;07] THEY CAN TAKE THEM ANY  
[000:51:31;11] PLACE IN THE COUNTRY  
[000:51:32;04] THAT'S HOW THEY ARE GOING  
[000:51:32;27] TO HANDLE IT.  
[000:51:34;19] >> Bill: BILL, THANK YOU.

[000:51:48;07] ONES THAT WE HAVE BEEN  
[000:51:49;11] WAITING DAYS FOR.  
[000:51:50;02] THE FBI NOW SEARCHING FOR  
[000:51:51;04] TWO SUSPECTS.  
[000:51:52;15] AND THEY ARE ASKING FOR
