00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
AN AUTO ASSEMBLY LINE SUDDENLY

374
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
STOPPED BECAUSE COMPUTERS HAD

375
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000

or dt

636
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and diarrhea.

637
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I tried lifestyle changes

638
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and over-the-counter treatments,

639
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
but my symptoms keep
coming back.

640
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It turns out I have

641
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Irritable Bowel Syndrome
with Diarrhea,

642
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
or IBS-D.

643
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
A condition that's really
frustrating.

644
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's why I talked to my
doctor about VIBERZI...

645
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
...a different way
to treat IBS-D.

646
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
VIBERZI is a
prescription medication

647
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you take every day

648
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that helps proactively manage

649
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
both abdominal pain and

650
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
diarrhea at the same time.

651
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I can stay ahead of
my symptoms.

652
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
VIBERZI can cause new or
worsening abdominal pain.

653
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Do not take VIBERZI
if you have no gallbladder,

654
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
have pancreas or
severe liver problems,

655
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
problems with alcohol abuse,

656
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
long-lasting or
severe constipation,

657
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
or a bowel or
gallbladder blockage.

658
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Pancreatitis may occur

659
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
and can lead to
hospitalization and death.

660
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If you are taking VIBERZI,

661
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you should not take medicines
that cause constipation.

662
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The most common side effects of
VIBERZI include constipation,

663
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
nausea, and abdominal pain.

664
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Stay ahead of IBS-D
with VIBERZI.

665
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I was in the
military for 18 years.rian,

666
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But, I smoked and
I got heart disease.

667
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
My tip is;

668
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
it's hard to
serve your country

669
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
when you're to weak
to put on your uniform.

670
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
(Announcer) You can quit.

671
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
For free help,

672
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
call 1-800-QUIT-NOW.

673

Oscar MaWe went back toig
the drawing board...

674
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And the cutting board.

675
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We removed the added nitrates
and nitrites,

676
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
by-products,

677
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and artificial preservatives
in all of our meat.

678
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Every. Single. One.

679
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Why? For the love of hot dogs.

680
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
when they thought they should
Westart saving for retirement.le

681
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Then we asked some older people

682
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
when they actually
did start saving.

683
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This gap between when
we should start saving

684
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and when we actually
do is one of the reasons

685
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
why too many of us aren't
prepared for retirement.

686
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Just start as early as you can.

687
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's going to pay
off in the future.

688
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If we all start saving
a little more today,

689
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
we'll all be better
prepared tomorrow.

707
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Microsoft and its partners are

708
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000

711
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There are over 100 million

712

pieces of DNA in every sample.

713
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
With the Microsoft Cloud,

714
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
we can analyze the data

715

faster than ever before.

716
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If we can detect new viruses

before they spread,

718
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
we may someday prevent outbreaks

Bburning of diabetic nerve pain

798
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000

799
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000

...and liked to help others
in need.

802
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But I couldn't bear my diabetic
nerve pain any longer.

803
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So I talked to my doctor

804
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and he prescribed LYRICA.

805
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Nerve damage from diabetes

806
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
causes diabetic nerve pain.

807
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
LYRICA is FDA approved

808
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
to treat this pain.

809
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
LYRICA may cause serious
allergic reactions

810
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
or suicidal thoughts
or actions.

811
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Tell your doctor right away

812
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
if you have these,

813
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
new or worsening depression,

814
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
or unusual changes in mood
or behavior.

815
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Or swelling, trouble breathing,

816
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
rash, hives, blisters, muscle
pain with fever,

817
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
tired feeling or blurry vision.

818
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Common side effects are
dizziness, sleepiness,

819
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
weight gain and swelling
of hands, legs, and feet.

820
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Don't drink alcohol while
taking LYRICA.

821
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't drive or use machinery

822
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
until you know how LYRICA
affects you.

823
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Those who have had a drug or
alcohol problem

824
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
may be more likely
to misuse LYRICA.

825
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Now I have less diabetic
nerve pain.

826
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And it's great to help others
get back on their feet.

827
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Ask your doctor about
LYRICA.

828
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If you're eligible,

829
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
you could pay as little as $25
dollars a month.
