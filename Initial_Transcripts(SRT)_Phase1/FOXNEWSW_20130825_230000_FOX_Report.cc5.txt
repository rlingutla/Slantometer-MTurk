[000:00:23;723] AMERICAN WAR SHIPS SITTING NOT
[000:00:25;392] FAR FROM SYRIA.
[000:00:26;926] HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.
[000:00:30;096] THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT SYRIA IS
[000:00:31;798] USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS
[000:00:33;700] OWN PEOPLE, FROM A SENIOR OBAMA
[000:00:40;974] ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.
[000:00:42;075] IS IT TIME TO FIRE AWAY?
[000:00:56;823] >> I CERTAINLY WOULD DO CRUISE
[000:00:58;758] MISSILE STRIKES.
[000:00:59;459] I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT
[000:01:01;828] BOOTS ON THE GROUND, WITHOUT
[000:01:03;430] HAVING AMERICANS IN HARM'S WAY.
[000:01:06;900] >> IF THE MILITARY ADVISES, THIS
[000:01:11;871] COULD DESTROY THE CHEMICAL
[000:01:13;339] WEAPON STOCKPILE, I WOULD
[000:01:14;574] SUPPORT THAT.
[000:01:15;175] >> FOX REPORT, THE LATEST
[000:01:17;043] RESPONSE HERE AND OVERSEAS TO
[000:01:18;578] NEW TALKS OF MILITARY
[000:01:20;814] INTERVENTION AGAINST THE ASSAD
[000:01:25;351] REGIME.
[000:01:25;952] ALSO BUGGING, THE UNITED
[000:01:28;521] NATIONS?
[000:01:28;855] A NEW REPORT SAYS AMERICA'S SPY
[000:01:31;825] AGENCY, THE NSA, TARGETED U.N.
[000:01:34;894] HEADQUARTERS.
[000:01:35;328] IN MINUTES, WHAT THE LATEST
[000:01:37;097] ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE NSA
[000:01:38;364] COULD MEAN FOR WASHINGTON AND
[000:01:43;470] OUR ALLIES.
[000:01:44;904] AND WHEN YOU RUN WITH THE BULLS,
[000:01:46;706] YOU WANT TO DODGE THE HORNS.
[000:01:49;542] BUT THERE'S ANOTHER DANGER
[000:01:51;010] LURKING IN AMERICA'S NEWEST PAST
[000:01:53;379] TIME, THE DRONES OVER THE SAND.
[000:01:55;849] NO REALLY, YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT
[000:01:57;684] FOR THOSE, TOO, APPARENTLY.
[000:02:01;221] I AM HARRIS FAULKNER.
[000:02:02;689] THE POPE, LEADER OF ONE BILLION
[000:02:05;625] CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD HAS
[000:02:07;193] SPOKEN ABOUT SYRIA.
[000:02:08;528] AS YOU KNOW, WORLD GOVERNMENTS,
[000:02:09;929] INCLUDING OUR OWN, ARE PONDERING
[000:02:12;565] WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR
[000:02:14;300] IN SYRIA CREATING MILLIONS OF
[000:02:16;603] REFUGEES, PUTTING PRESSURE ON
[000:02:18;404] NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND
[000:02:20;073] POTENTIALLY PUNCHING HOLES IN AN
[000:02:22;642] ALREADY FRAGILE IMBALANCE THERE.
[000:02:24;511] IT COULD BE THE OPENING FOR
[000:02:25;678] TERRORISTS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE
[000:02:27;113] CHAOS IN SYRIA.
[000:02:29;015] ASIDE FROM THE WRANGLING BY THE
[000:02:30;550] POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS,
[000:02:32;285] TODAY, POPE FRANCIS CALLED FOR
[000:02:34;354] ACTION, URGING THE INTERNATIONAL
[000:02:35;522] COMMUNITY TO STEP UP EFFORTS TO
[000:02:37;056] HELP SYRIA END THE WAR.
[000:02:38;691] THE POPE ADDRESSED TENS OF
[000:02:40;160] THOUSANDS OF WORSHIPPERS IN ST.
[000:02:43;496] PETER'S SQUARE, SPEAKING ABOUT
[000:02:45;932] THE TERRIBLE IMAGES SHOWING
[000:02:47;333] INNOCENT CIVILIANS UNDER ATTACK.
[000:02:48;701] HE RENEWED CALLS FOR THE SYRIAN
[000:02:50;537] GOVERNMENT AND REBELS TO PUT
[000:02:51;871] DOWN ARMS AND START TALKING.
[000:02:53;540] POPE FRANCIS ALSO EXPRESSING
[000:02:55;708] LOVE WITH PRAYERS AND SOLIDARITY
[000:02:56;976] TO VICTIMS OF THE CONFLICT AND
[000:02:59;045] THOSE SUFFERING, ESPECIALLY THE
[000:03:00;146] CHILDREN.
[000:03:00;513] NOW TO THE NEW REACTION IN
[000:03:03;316] WASHINGTON.
[000:03:03;716] JUST HOURS AGO, LAWMAKERS FROM
[000:03:05;385] BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES CALLING
[000:03:06;619] FOR A LIMITED MILITARY RESPONSE.
[000:03:10;223] THE REPORTED CHEMICAL ATTACK IN
[000:03:13;159] SYRIA'S CAPITAL CITY, KILLING
[000:03:14;827] HUNDREDS.
[000:03:15;195] THE U.N. ANNOUNCING SYRIA IS
[000:03:16;963] CLAIMING IT WILL ALLOW A TEAM OF
[000:03:19;999] INSPECTORS TO EXAMINE THE SITE.
[000:03:22;135] THAT'S SET TO BEGIN TOMORROW.
[000:03:24;003] A SENIOR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
[000:03:25;271] OFFICIAL SAYING THERE'S VERY
[000:03:26;172] LITTLE DOUBT PEOPLE WERE GASSED.
[000:03:27;774] SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE,
[000:03:30;043] RANKING MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN
[000:03:31;477] RELATIONS COMMITTEE IS AMONG THE
[000:03:32;645] LAWMAKERS GOING ON THE RECORD
[000:03:35;348] TODAY.
[000:03:35;682] >> I THINK WE WILL RESPOND IN A
[000:03:37;250] SURGICAL WAY AND I HOPE THE
[000:03:38;785] PRESIDENT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK
[000:03:40;587] TO WASHINGTON WILL ASK FOR
[000:03:43;323] AUTHORIZATION FROM CONGRESS TO
[000:03:44;057] DO SOMETHING IN A VERY SURGICAL
[000:03:45;858] AND PROPORTIONAL WAY, SOMETHING
[000:03:48;328] THAT GETS THEIR ATTENTION, THAT
[000:03:50;129] CAUSES THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT
[000:03:51;197] WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH
[000:03:52;899] THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY.
[000:03:54;033] WE HAVE TO VERIFY IT WAS
[000:03:59;772] DIRECTED BY THE ASSAD REGIME.
[000:04:01;307] THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD AN
[000:04:03;376] INTERNATIONAL COALITION AND THAT
[000:04:04;811] IS NECESSARY TO TAKE FURTHER
[000:04:06;079] STEPS IN SYRIA, ALSO WILL HELP
[000:04:08;448] DIFFUSE SOME OF THE COUNTRIES
[000:04:09;482] LIKE IRAN, RUSSIA, TRYING TO
[000:04:11;351] PAWN THIS OFF ON THE REBELS.
[000:04:13;486] >> AND THE SECOND LAWMAKER, OF
[000:04:15;154] COURSE, YOU SAW THERE WAS
[000:04:17;724] SENATOR JACK REED WHO TALKED
[000:04:19;492] ABOUT DIFFUSING COUNTRIES LIKE
[000:04:21;160] IRAN AND HE MENTIONED RUSSIA,
[000:04:22;762] LONG TIME ALLY OF THE SYRIAN
[000:04:26;232] PRESIDENT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.
[000:04:29;869] THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY
[000:04:32;839] SAYS ANY BILATERAL ACTIONS THAT
[000:04:34;741] BYPASSES UNITED NATIONS WOULD
[000:04:35;441] HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON
[000:04:36;743] SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
[000:04:39;779] ELIZABETH PRAN WITH MORE.
[000:04:41;781] >> WE HEARD FROM THE
[000:04:42;782] ADMINISTRATION OVER THE WEEKEND,
[000:04:43;983] THE NAVY STATION DESTROYERS IN
[000:04:46;886] THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEE,
[000:04:48;955] BUT NO WORD ON PLANS FOR THE
[000:04:51;257] SHIPS.
[000:04:51;557] THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS A QUICK
[000:04:53;192] INTERVENTION WOULD BE
[000:04:54;494] PROBLEMATIC, WHILE SOME
[000:04:55;161] LAWMAKERS THINK LEADERS SHOULD
[000:04:55;995] BE ACTING OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF
[000:04:58;331] CAUTION, OTHERS SAY THERE SHOULD
[000:05:00;600] BE MORE ACTIVITY.
[000:05:01;467] >> WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR WAR
[000:05:04;170] SHIPS, AGAIN, OFF THE COAST OF
[000:05:07;540] SYRIA, MISSILES ARE AN OPTION TO
[000:05:10;410] TRY TO TAKE OUT THE CHEMICAL
[000:05:11;911] STOCK PILES.
[000:05:12;512] >> JUST STANDING OFF, THROWING A
[000:05:14;547] FEW MISSILES, DROPPING A FEW
[000:05:18;384] BOMBS ON KEY TARGETS ARE WHAT WE
[000:05:20;586] IN THE MILITARY CALL A FEEL GOOD
[000:05:22;622] BOMBING.
[000:05:22;955] IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE
[000:05:24;123] ABILITY TO SAY HE'S DONE
[000:05:26;592] SOMETHING, PERHAPS SOME IN
[000:05:27;360] AMERICA FEEL BETTER, BUT IN
[000:05:28;528] TERMS OF DEGRADING THE ABILITY
[000:05:30;063] OF THE SYRIAN ARMY TO ATTACK ITS
[000:05:32;298] OWN PEOPLE IN THIS CIVIL WAR, I
[000:05:35;268] DON'T THINK MUCH IS GOING TO
[000:05:36;102] COME OUT OF IT.
[000:05:37;403] >> SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
[000:05:38;905] HAS ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
[000:05:42;175] DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COLLEAGUES
[000:05:42;909] OVER THE WEEKEND.
[000:05:44;110] HARRIS?
[000:05:44;444] >> A COUPLE HOURS AGO, WE
[000:05:45;778] LEARNED THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH
[000:05:46;813] THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE TODAY.
[000:05:48;314] WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT THEY
[000:05:49;482] SAID?
[000:05:49;782] >> WE KNOW HE SPOKE WITH THE
[000:05:53;453] FRENCH PRESIDENT TODAY.
[000:05:54;487] ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION,
[000:05:55;755] THEY DISCUSSED POSSIBLE FUTURE
[000:05:57;957] RESPONSES BY THE INTERNATIONAL
[000:05:59;225] COMMUNITY AND AGREED TO STAY IN
[000:06:01;728] CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.
[000:06:02;428] JUST YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:03;863] SPENT MORE THAN 40 MINUTES
[000:06:05;598] SPEAKING WITH THE BRITISH PRIME
[000:06:08;568] MINISTER DAVID CAMERON.
[000:06:10;136] THEY AGREE THE CRISIS IS
[000:06:12;004] UPGRADED, WARRANTS SERIOUS
[000:06:13;506] RESPONSE.
[000:06:13;873] TWO LEADERS AGREE ALL OPTIONS TO
[000:06:15;141] BE ON THE TABLE.
[000:06:15;908] OF COURSE, HARRIS, ALL OF THE
[000:06:20;680] MEN EXPRESS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT
[000:06:21;414] THE ALLEGED USE OF CHEMICAL
[000:06:23;816] WEAPONS.
[000:06:24;150] >> ELIZABETH PRANN, THANK YOU.
[000:06:27;253] INSPECTORS ARE SET TO VISIT THE
[000:06:29;455] SITE OF THE ALLEGED CHEMICAL
[000:06:31;591] ATTACK.
[000:06:31;924] THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO
[000:06:36;929] ALLOW THEM TO GO IN.
[000:06:38;297] THEY WILL BEGIN FACT-FINDING IN
[000:06:39;465] SYRIA IN A FEW HOURS.
[000:06:41;734] IT IS ALREADY MONDAY THERE.
[000:06:44;070] SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY IT MAY
[000:06:46;239] BE TOO LATE TO FIND ANYTHING.
[000:06:47;707] IF THE SYRIANS HAD NOTHING TO
[000:06:49;675] HIDE, WOULD HAVE LET THEM IN
[000:06:51;077] FIVE DAYS AGO.
[000:06:52;845] BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY SAYS
[000:06:53;713] EVIDENCE OF THAT ATTACK MAY BE
[000:06:55;882] GONE.
[000:06:56;182] >>> COMING UP, INSIDE THE FOX
[000:06:58;351] REPORT, YOU HEARD US SO FAR
[000:06:59;852] REPORT TWO THREATS, ONE FROM
[000:07:01;387] IRAN, ONE FROM RUSSIA.
[000:07:02;822] IF OUR MILITARY WERE TO MAKE A
[000:07:04;457] MOVE IN SYRIA OUTSIDE THE UNITED
[000:07:06;826] NATIONS.
[000:07:07;160] TO GET A BETTER IDEA WHAT THE
[000:07:08;961] THREATS MEAN AND WHETHER THEY
[000:07:10;196] WOULD ACTUALLY DETER US MAKING A
[000:07:12;198] MOVE, WE BRING IN FORMER U.S.
[000:07:14;500] AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS,
[000:07:15;968] JOHN BOLTON.
[000:07:16;569] I'LL ASK HIM ABOUT IT.
[000:07:21;941] >>> AN INFERNO BURNING NEAR THE
[000:07:24;043] NORTHERN BORDER OF YOSEMITE
[000:07:26;212] NATIONAL PARK COVERS WELL OVER
[000:07:27;480] 200 SQUARE MILES.
[000:07:28;648] THAT BREAKING DEVELOPMENT JUST
[000:07:29;816] HOURS AGO.
[000:07:30;550] IT IS NOW THE SIZE OF THE CITY
[000:07:32;452] OF CHICAGO.
[000:07:33;286] JUST OVERNIGHT IT GREW BY MORE
[000:07:34;821] THAN SEVEN SQUARE MILES IN SIZE.
[000:07:36;722] FIREFIGHTERS FACED WITH STRONG
[000:07:38;024] WINDS IN THE FORECAST FOR
[000:07:39;826] TONIGHT.
[000:07:40;827] FOREST LAND, HOMES, LIVES, ALL
[000:07:42;361] IN THE PATH OF THE SO-CALLED RIM
[000:07:46;432] FIRE.
[000:07:46;732] >> 15 MINUTES TO BE OUT OF OUR
[000:07:48;468] HOUSE.
[000:07:49;068] WE ONLY GOT OUR KIDS, OUR
[000:07:50;970] ANIMALS, A LITTLE BIT OF
[000:07:53;406] PICTURES AND OF PAPERWORK WE
[000:07:54;774] REALLY NEEDED.
[000:07:55;475] IT WAS HARD.
[000:07:56;075] >> IT IS A LOT NOW.
[000:07:57;844] JUST MOVED IN THREE MONTHS AGO.
[000:07:59;879] WE'RE JUST GETTING ON OUR FEET,
[000:08:02;148] GETTING STABLE.
[000:08:02;748] >> ADDING TO THE SENSE OF ALARM,
[000:08:05;151] CREWS ONLY ABLE TO CONTAIN THE
[000:08:07;119] FIRE BY ABOUT 7%.
[000:08:08;421] AS YOU MAY KNOW.
[000:08:09;455] IT HAS BEEN A VERY ACTIVE
[000:08:11;791] WILDFIRE SEASON WITH 50 BURNING
[000:08:13;860] CURRENTLY ACROSS WESTERN STATES,
[000:08:15;228] YOU SEE ON THE MAP.
[000:08:17;763] REPORTS DENSE SMOKE FROM SOME
[000:08:19;198] FIRES IS POURING INTO RENO,
[000:08:21;400] NEVADA, CREATING MAJOR HEALTH
[000:08:23;903] CONCERNS.
[000:08:24;537] VISIBILITY SO BAD THERE THEY
[000:08:26;472] CAN'T CARE FLIGHT AMBULANCES IN
[000:08:31;344] THE AIR.
[000:08:34;981] DOMINIC DID I NA TALLY HAS MORE.
[000:08:37;683] >> Reporter: YOU'RE LOOKING AT A
[000:08:45;958] MASSIVE VOLUME OF SMOKE.
[000:08:47;126] IT BURST OUT IN THE PAST FEW
[000:08:48;861] MOMENTS.
[000:08:49;262] WE WERE SEEING THE ORANGE GLOW
[000:08:50;429] OF THE FIRE ON THE EDGE OF THE
[000:08:52;131] CITY.
[000:08:52;632] THIS IS THE MOMENT THE FIRE
[000:08:54;634] CRUCIAL HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY
[000:08:57;136] DREADING THE PAST 48 HOURS.
[000:08:58;204] THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING MAKE OR
[000:08:59;505] BREAK EFFORTS TO PROTECT THIS
[000:09:00;840] CITY FROM THE FIRE AS IT COMES
[000:09:03;042] IN.
[000:09:03;309] THE FIRE IS BURNING TWO
[000:09:04;510] DIFFERENT COLORS, WHITE IS FUEL,
[000:09:07;613] SO HOT.
[000:09:08;548] THE GREEN FUEL IS PUTTING BLACK
[000:09:10;750] WAVES INTO THE AIR.
[000:09:12;285] AIR VURZ IS GOING OVER.
[000:09:13;920] HAD A MASSIVE AIR TANKER, FOUR
[000:09:16;289] PROP PLANE LOOKING TO SEE WHERE
[000:09:21;894] IT SHOULD PUT RETARDANT.
[000:09:23;462] ABOUT 16,000 HOMES HERE OR
[000:09:25;398] SORRY, 1600 HOMES THAT NEED
[000:09:27;366] PROTECTING.
[000:09:28;134] 2,000 FIRE CREW.
[000:09:29;101] SOME MEMBERS OF THE CREW FROM
[000:09:31;671] SUNNYVALE AND PALO ALTO ARE
[000:09:33;873] LOOKING AT THAT COLUMN OF SMOKE,
[000:09:36;008] EXTREMELY WORRIED.
[000:09:37;243] A FEW COLLEAGUES MOMENTS BEFORE
[000:09:38;911] WE CAME ON AIR LEFT IN THE FIRE
[000:09:41;047] TRUCK, HEADED IN THEIR
[000:09:44;116] DIRECTION.
[000:09:44;483] YOU KNOW AN EXTRA 2,000
[000:09:45;885] FIREFIGHTERS WERE BROUGHT IN
[000:09:47;453] YESTERDAY TO PROTECT THIS TOWN.
[000:09:49;689] ALMOST 8 FIREFIGHTERS PER HOME.
[000:09:52;592] WITH EASTERLY WINDS COMING IN
[000:09:54;393] AND PUSHING IN THIS DIRECTION,
[000:09:56;796] THIS REALLY IS NOT WHAT THEY
[000:09:57;730] WANTED TO SEE.
[000:09:58;898] BUT THEY KNEW WINDS WOULD BE A
[000:10:01;734] RISK, GOING ANYTHING FROM 10 TO
[000:10:03;736] 40 MILES PER HOUR GOING OVER THE
[000:10:05;871] HILLSIDE.
[000:10:06;238] THAT KIND OF WIND GUARANTEES HOW
[000:10:09;842] MANY LINES THEY CREATE, THE FIRE
[000:10:12;678] CAN JUMP THE LINES AND THAT WILL
[000:10:14;080] BE DEVASTATING FOR THE TOWN.
[000:10:15;748] BACK TO YOU.
[000:10:16;215] >> THE FIRST IMAGE WAS FROM YOUR
[000:10:17;683] OWN CAMERA.
[000:10:19;585] I KNEW FROM MY NOTES YOU WOULD
[000:10:24;256] BE LIVE NEAR IT.
[000:10:25;391] YOU'RE FAIRLY CLOSE TO IT.
[000:10:27;059] CAN YOU SMELL THE SMOKE?
[000:10:29;195] >> OH, YES.
[000:10:30;429] IT HAS BEEN THICK THROUGH THE
[000:10:31;597] DAY.
[000:10:31;864] YOU CAN FEEL IT ON THE BACK OF
[000:10:33;432] OUR THROAT, COATING LIKE A
[000:10:35;701] POWDER, IN OUR NOSTRILS.
[000:10:37;503] IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT.
[000:10:38;704] BLUE SKY ABOVE IT ONE SIDE AND
[000:10:41;107] SMOKE KEEPS WASPING IN.
[000:10:42;842] I HAVE TO SAY THIS DOES NOT LOOK
[000:10:44;176] GOOD FOR THE TOWN.
[000:10:45;911] THERE'S ALREADY ADVISORY,
[000:10:51;751] EVACUATION.
[000:10:52;151] LOOKS LIKE ANY TIME SOON A
[000:10:53;819] MANDATORY EVACUATION.
[000:10:54;820] WE WERE TIPPED OFF BY CAL FIRE
[000:10:56;989] SAYING THAT PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN
[000:10:58;391] TODAY.
[000:10:59;659] LOOKING AT THE SIZE AND THE RACE
[000:11:00;993] IT IS APPROACHING, I WOULDN'T BE
[000:11:02;595] SURPRISED IF EVACUATION WAS PUT
[000:11:03;929] IN IN MINUTES, CERTAINLY IN A

[000:34:16;521] REPUBLICAN OUT OF TEXAS, WHO
[000:34:18;723] TALKS ABOUT THAT TENUOUS
[000:34:19;857] RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH RUSSIA.
[000:34:21;659] LET'S WATCH THAT AND THEN WE'LL
[000:34:22;994] TALK MORE.
[000:34:23;628] >> THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
[000:34:26;264] WHITE HOUSE AND THE PUTIN
[000:34:28;299] ADMINISTRATION IS SO BAD AND
[000:34:30;134] LACKS SO MUCH CREDIBILITY THAT I
[000:34:31;135] THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.
[000:34:32;937] WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST.
[000:34:34;439] I BELIEVE THE RUGS DON'T WANT
[000:34:36;274] CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED, AS DOES
[000:34:37;875] THE UNITED STATES, SO WE DO HAVE
[000:34:41;879] AN OPPORTUNITY, I HOPE THE
[000:34:43;915] PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO TAKE
[000:34:47;685] ADVANTAGE OF.
[000:34:49;821] >> AND THE COULD YOU TELL
[000:34:52;623] COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN THERE.
[000:34:54;792] CURIOUS OF YOUR THOUGHTS.
[000:34:57;829] >> I THINK THEY THINK OBAMA IS
[000:34:59;097] WEAK AND CAN BULLY HIM, PUSHING
[000:35:01;699] ON ONE OTHER BUTTON THAT THE
[000:35:03;935] PRESIDENT HIGHLIGHTED LAST WEEK
[000:35:05;169] WHEN HE WONDERED WHAT HIS
[000:35:07;238] INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY WAS TO
[000:35:08;873] LAUNCH MILITARY ACTION.
[000:35:10;808] AND THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE
[000:35:13;511] U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL WHERE
[000:35:14;712] RUSSIA HAS A VETO.
[000:35:17;115] FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK THE
[000:35:17;882] UNITED STATES SHOULD CARE ONE
[000:35:19;083] WIT WHETHER WE HAVE A SECURITY
[000:35:21;452] COUNCIL RESOLUTION OR NOT.
[000:35:22;353] THIS IS THINKING IN A EUROPEAN
[000:35:25;490] WAY, WHO HAS AUTHORIZED ME TO DO
[000:35:26;791] THIS, AS OPPOSED TO THINKING IN
[000:35:28;493] THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WAY,
[000:35:29;927] WHO IS PROHIBITING ME FROM DOING
[000:35:32;930] THIS.
[000:35:33;231] WHILE I THINK WE OUGHT TO
[000:35:34;565] DISREGARD IT, I THINK THE
[000:35:36;567] RUSSIANS KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:35:37;768] PSYCHOLOGY AND THAT'S WHAT
[000:35:41;873] THEY'RE TRYING TO EFFECT.
[000:35:45;276] >> CHAT ROOMS, THEY'RE SAYING
[000:35:46;244] OUR NATION SHOULDN'T BE
[000:35:47;111] INVOLVED, SOME OF THEM.
[000:35:48;146] YOU ALSO SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE
[000:35:49;514] INVOLVED THERE THE WAY WE ARE,
[000:35:51;782] SYRIA IS A SECONDARY ISSUE.
[000:35:53;251] WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
[000:35:53;985] >> AS I SAID, THE ASSAD REGIME
[000:35:56;354] WOULD NOT BE IN POWER BUT FOR
[000:35:58;656] IRAN, AND WHILE PEOPLE SAY THIS
[000:36:00;158] IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN DEFEAT
[000:36:02;560] IRAN, THIS IS EFFECTIVELY MUCH
[000:36:04;462] LESS IMPORTANT THAN IRAN'S
[000:36:06;898] NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.
[000:36:08;232] AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
[000:36:09;634] RIGHT NOW.
[000:36:10;501] IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T ACT
[000:36:11;636] WITH MASSIVE FORCE IN SYRIA, IF
[000:36:14;138] IT IS JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST
[000:36:16;240] TO THE ASSAD REGIME, WHICH MANY
[000:36:18;609] ARE PREDICTING, I THINK THE
[000:36:20;611] LESSON IRAN DRAWS FROM THAT WE
[000:36:23;447] BETTER GET OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
[000:36:25;583] CAPABILITY IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE
[000:36:26;517] THEN WE WILL BE IMMUNE TO AN
[000:36:28;686] AMERICAN SLAP ON THE WRIST.
[000:36:29;887] ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE
[000:36:32;023] PRESIDENT DOES USE MASSIVE FORCE
[000:36:34;258] TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF FORCES
[000:36:35;760] WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF, IT COULD
[000:36:37;628] WELL RESULT IN THE OPPOSITION
[000:36:39;463] TAKING POWER, WHICH I DON'T
[000:36:40;598] THINK IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST
[000:36:42;767] EITHER.
[000:36:43;100] THAT'S WHY I STRESS I DON'T
[000:36:44;468] THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HIS
[000:36:46;537] OWN MIND.
[000:36:46;904] I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HIS
[000:36:48;105] STRATEGY IS.
[000:36:48;739] I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THE
[000:36:50;641] AGONIZING IS ABOUT.
[000:36:52;810] >> VERY INTERESTING.
[000:36:54;078] YOU PAINT SUCH DIFFERENT
[000:36:56;013] SCENARIOS THERE.
[000:36:56;614] AND I'LL CHANGE TOPICS JUST
[000:36:58;416] SLIGHTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK
[000:36:59;750] YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS.
[000:37:01;619] SAMANTHA POWER HAS TAKEN YOUR
[000:37:04;555] OLD POST AS U.S. AMBASSADOR AT
[000:37:05;690] THE U.N.
[000:37:06;958] SHE WAS AWAY FOR PERSONAL
[000:37:08;392] REASONS WE READ THIS WEEK,
[000:37:10;528] MISSED THAT VERY IMPORTANT
[000:37:12;263] EMERGENCY MEETING AT THE UNITED
[000:37:13;497] NATIONS.
[000:37:13;931] IT WAS ON SYRIA.
[000:37:15;800] HOW UNUSUAL IS IT THAT THE
[000:37:16;934] AMBASSADOR WOULD MISS A MEETING
[000:37:18;202] LIKE THAT?
[000:37:18;970] >> WELL, I THINK IT IS OKAY FOR
[000:37:20;871] PEOPLE TO TAKE VACATIONS.
[000:37:22;440] I THINK THAT'S FINE.
[000:37:23;608] I DIDN'T TAKE A VACATION WHEN I
[000:37:25;243] STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF
[000:37:27;245] AUGUST OF 2005, BUT MAYBE I'M A
[000:37:29;847] WORKAHOLIC.
[000:37:30;248] I THINK SHE WILL BE BACK IN TIME
[000:37:31;816] FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS,
[000:37:33;451] GIVEN THAT PUBLICITY.
[000:37:34;986] >> SO NO SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS
[000:37:36;554] OF HOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD OR
[000:37:38;155] ANYTHING LIKE THAT?
[000:37:39;056] >> NOTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE ON
[000:37:41;492] SYRIA IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE
[000:37:43;094] UNITED NATIONS ANYWAY.
[000:37:43;894] SHE PROBABLY COULD STAY IN
[000:37:47;064] IRELAND ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS
[000:37:47;765] FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE.
[000:37:48;466] >> THAT IS BLUNT.
[000:37:49;667] LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
[000:37:51;035] ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.
[000:37:51;969] CHANGING TOPICS TO NEW
[000:37:53;037] INFORMATION WE HAVE GOTTEN ABOUT
[000:37:54;238] THE NSA SPYING, NOT JUST ON
[000:37:55;640] MILLIONS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS AS
[000:37:58;109] WE LEARNED ABOUT FROM EDWARD
[000:37:59;477] SNOWDEN, THE U.S. CONTRACTOR NOW
[000:38:01;012] A FUGITIVE INSIDE RUSSIA, BUT
[000:38:03;447] THE UNITED NATIONS, THAT THEY
[000:38:04;782] WERE BEING BUGGED.
[000:38:05;850] UP TO 80 EMBASSIES AROUND THE
[000:38:08;486] WORLD.
[000:38:08;786] THAT'S GOT TO POSE SOME QUESTION
[000:38:10;221] I WOULD IMAGINE THE MINDS OF OUR
[000:38:12;056] ALLIES.
[000:38:12;390] YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT?
[000:38:15;459] >> THE DER SPIEGEL ARTICLE SAYS
[000:38:18;663] ESPIONAGE AGAINST THE UNITED
[000:38:19;497] NATIONS TOOK PLACE IN 2012,
[000:38:20;898] WHICH I FIND DELICIOUSLY IRONIC
[000:38:23;567] THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS
[000:38:25;269] SPYING ON THE UNITED NATIONS.
[000:38:26;304] HERE IS WHAT I THINK.
[000:38:28;673] ANY GATHERING OF FOREIGNERS IS A
[000:38:32;343] LEGITIMATE TARGET FOR AMERICAN
[000:38:33;878] ESPIONAGE, UNLESS WE HAVE
[000:38:34;679] AGREEMENT THAT PRECLUDES US FROM
[000:38:36;047] DOING IT.
[000:38:36;914] AND ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
[000:38:38;316] ABSENT SUCH AN AGREEMENT THAT
[000:38:39;583] DOESN'T THINK WE MAY BE SPYING
[000:38:41;452] ON THEM DOESN'T LIVE IN THE REAL
[000:38:44;789] WORLD.
[000:38:45;523] THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, DOESN'T
[000:38:46;991] BOTHER ME AT ALL.
[000:38:48;459] I THINK THIS SHOWS A FUNDAMENTAL
[000:38:50;594] POINT THAT SNOWDEN AND HIS MEDIA
[000:38:56;167] FRIENDS ARE TRYING TO PROVE.
[000:38:57;335] NOT TO AWAKEN AMERICANS ABOUT
[000:38:59;036] POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF PRIVACY
[000:39:00;671] BUT TO HURT THE UNITED STATES
[000:39:05;176] INTERNATIONALLY.
[000:39:05;643] WHILE MOST AMERICANS COULDN'T
[000:39:06;344] CARE LESS IF WE'RE SPYING ON THE
[000:39:09;213] U.N., IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES,
[000:39:11;449] THAT'S ALMOST SACK RIL AJ.
[000:39:12;850] THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS COMING
[000:39:13;984] OUT IN GERMANY.
[000:39:16;153] >> AMBASSADOR BOLTON, WE
[000:39:18;255] APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR AND

[001:00:21;818] HIS SIGNATURE LEGISLATION
[001:00:22;986] BROKEN, THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES
[001:00:24;053] TO BLAME REPUBLICANS.
[001:00:25;121] >> THE ONE UNIFYING PRINCIPLE IN
[001:00:27;757] THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THE
[001:00:29;258] MOMENT IS MAKING SURE THAT 30
[001:00:31;961] MILLION PEOPLE DON'T HAVE HEALTH
[001:00:33;096] CARE.
[001:00:33;396] >> BUT IT IS NOT JUST THE GOP
[001:00:35;932] THAT DOESN'T LIKE OBAMA CARE.

[001:00:39;435] COMING DOWN.
[001:00:40;169] >> I'M OF THE BELIEF THE ACA IS
[001:00:43;906] PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLEX PIECE
[001:00:45;341] OF LEGISLATION EVER PASSED BY
[001:00:47;276] THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.
[001:00:48;011] >> DEMOCRATS, THE IRS, AND EVEN
[001:00:50;246] UNIONS HAVE MAJOR ISSUES WITH

[001:00:55;618] BETTER PLAN.
