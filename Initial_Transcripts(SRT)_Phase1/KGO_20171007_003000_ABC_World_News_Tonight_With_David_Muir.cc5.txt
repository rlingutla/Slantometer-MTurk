[000:18:38;667] I didn't even want to go.
[000:18:39;902] Ahh, your diary!
[000:18:42;237] "Mom says it is
[000:18:42;237] totally natural..."
[000:18:46;141] $25 is nothing.
[000:18:48;110] (Alert beep)
[000:18:49;411] Abracadabra, bro.
[000:18:51;680] Settle up with your friends
[000:18:51;680] on October 17th
[000:18:53;715] with the Bank of America
[000:18:53;715] Mobile Banking App.
[000:18:56;118] Settle up with your friends
[000:18:56;118] on October 17th
[000:18:57;319] When it comes to strong bones,
[000:18:57;319] are you on the right path?
[000:19:00;556] We have postmenopausal
[000:19:00;556] osteoporosis...
[000:19:02;891] ..and a high risk for fracture,
[000:19:02;891] so with our doctors...
[000:19:05;727] ...we chose Prolia®...
[000:19:07;095] ...to help make our bones
[000:19:07;095] stronger.
[000:19:08;897] Only Prolia® helps strengthen
[000:19:08;897] bones...
[000:19:11;099] ...by stopping cells that damage
[000:19:11;099] them...
[000:19:13;101] ...with 1 shot every 6 months.
[000:19:14;937] Do not take Prolia® if you have
[000:19:14;937] low blood calcium, are pregnant,
[000:19:17;873] are allergic to it, or take
[000:19:17;873] XGEVA®.
[000:19:20;209] Serious allergic reactions, like
[000:19:20;209] low blood pressure; trouble
[000:19:20;209] breathing;
[000:19:23;178] throat tightness; face, lip or
[000:19:23;178] tongue swelling...
[000:19:25;614] ...rash, itching or hives have
[000:19:25;614] happened.
[000:19:27;416] Tell your doctor about dental
[000:19:27;416] problems, as severe jaw bone...
[000:19:29;751] ...problems may happen or new or
[000:19:29;751] unusual pain in your hip groin,
[000:19:29;751] or thigh,
[000:19:33;288] as unusual thigh bone fractures
[000:19:33;288] have occurred.
[000:19:35;757] peak to your doctor before
[000:19:35;757] stopping Prolia®,
[000:19:37;793] as spine and other bone
[000:19:37;793] fractures have occurred.
[000:19:39;962] Prolia® can cause serious side
[000:19:39;962] effects, like low blood calcium;
[000:19:43;031] serious infections, which could
[000:19:43;031] need hospitalization;
[000:19:45;400] ...skin problems; and severe
[000:19:45;400] bone, joint, or muscle pain.
[000:19:48;470] If your bones aren't getting
[000:19:48;470] stronger...
[000:19:50;739] ...isn't it time for a new
[000:19:50;739] direction?
[000:19:53;308] Why wait? Ask your doctor about
[000:19:53;308] Prolia®.
[000:19:58;146] eight hundred dollars whenlmost
[000:19:59;147] we switched our auto and
[000:19:59;147] home insurance.
[000:20:00;749] Liberty did what?
[000:20:02;050] Yeah, they saved us a ton,
[000:20:03;385] which gave us a little wiggle
[000:20:03;385] room in our budget.
[000:20:06;188] Wish our insurance did that.
[000:20:07;456] Then we could get a real
[000:20:08;323] babysitter instead of
[000:20:08;323] your brother.
[000:20:09;791] Hey, welcome back.
[000:20:11;093] This guy... right?
[000:20:12;828] Yes.
[000:20:13;562] Ellen.
[000:20:16;932] That's my robe.
[000:20:19;001] You could save seven hundred
[000:20:19;001] eighty two dollars
[000:20:20;669] when Liberty stands with you.
[000:20:23;105] LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE.
[000:20:28;944] I even accept I have a higher
[000:20:28;944] risk of stroke due to AFib,
[000:20:28;944] I accept I take easier trails
[000:20:28;944] than I used to.
[000:20:32;180] a type of irregular heartbeat
[000:20:32;180] not caused
[000:20:34;116] by a heart valve problem.
[000:20:35;484] But no matter what path I take,
[000:20:35;484] I go for my best.
[000:20:39;121] So if there's something better
[000:20:39;121] than warfarin,
[000:20:41;423] I'll go for that too. ELIQUIS.
[000:20:43;992] ELIQUIS reduced the risk of
[000:20:43;992] stroke better than warfarin,
[000:20:47;396] plus had less
[000:20:47;396] major bleeding
[000:20:47;396] than warfarin.
[000:20:50;232] ELIQUIS had both.
[000:20:51;533] Don't stop taking ELIQUIS unless
[000:20:51;533] your doctor tells you to,
[000:20:54;236] as stopping increases your risk
[000:20:54;236] of having a stroke.
[000:20:56;672] ELIQUIS can cause serious and in
[000:20:56;672] rare cases fatal bleeding.
[000:20:59;708] Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
[000:20:59;708] an artificial heart valve
[000:21:02;244] or abnormal bleeding.
[000:21:03;545] While taking ELIQUIS, you may
[000:21:03;545] bruise more easily...
[000:21:06;048] ...and it may take longer than
[000:21:06;048] usual for any bleeding to stop.
[000:21:08;717] Seek immediate medical care for
[000:21:08;717] sudden signs of bleeding,
[000:21:11;486] like unusual bruising.
[000:21:12;788] ELIQUIS may increase your
[000:21:12;788] bleeding risk
[000:21:14;489] if you take certain medicines.
[000:21:15;857] Tell your doctor about all
[000:21:15;857] planned medical
[000:21:17;960] or dental procedures.
[000:21:19;161] I'm still going
[000:21:19;161] for my best.
[000:21:21;263] And for ELIQUIS.
[000:21:22;631] Ask your doctor about ELIQUIS.
