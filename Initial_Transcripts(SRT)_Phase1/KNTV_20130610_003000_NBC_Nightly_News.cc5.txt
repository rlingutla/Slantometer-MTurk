[000:08:37;350] SQUARE.
[000:08:38;284] THE PROTESTS WERE TRIGGERED BY
[000:08:40;019] PLANS TO BULLDOZE A PARK.
[000:08:47;393] BUT WHEN POLICE MOVED IN IN
[000:08:48;794] FORCE, PROTESTS GREW WAY BEYOND
[000:08:49;662] THE DISPUTE OVER URBAN PLANNING.
[000:08:50;796] PROTESTERS HERE SAY ERDOWAN IS
[000:08:54;233] TRYING TO IMPOSE AN ISLAMIC

[000:08:59;071] SECULAR GOVERNMENT IN THIS
[000:08:59;739] COUNTRY.
[000:09:00;806] IT IS A DEMONSTRATION ABOUT THE
[000:09:01;541] VERY NATURE OF TURKEY AND A
[000:09:02;775] REJECTION OF ERDOWAN'S VISION
[000:09:05;444] OF A ISLAMIC DEMOCRACY.

[000:09:30;870] OF ALCOHOL.
[000:09:39;078] ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO HAVE LARGE

[000:09:41;380] THE PROTESTERS SAID ENOUGH IS
[000:09:42;081] ENOUGH.
[000:09:42;415] BUT ERDOWAN HAS HIS SUPPORTERS,
[000:09:43;649] TOO.
[000:09:43;950] HE WAS, AFTER ALL, ELECTED THREE
