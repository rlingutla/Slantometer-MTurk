A THREAT.

THE STUDENT SAID HE SAW HIM IN

A PARTY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND HE

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WAS JUST RELAXED.

255
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
RELAXED DAYS AFTER HE WAS SAID

256
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
TO HAVE ATTACKED THE BOSTON

257
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
MARATHON.
THOUSANDS OF INVESTIGATORS

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
HUNTED FOR HIS BROTHER AND

259
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
HIM.
THE SCHOOL EVACUATED THE

260
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
CAMPUS AFTER THE SCHOOL

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
REALIZED THAT THE SUSPECT WAS

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A STUDENT.

263
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OFFICERS WERE VERY CAREFUL

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
WITH APPROACHING THE BOAT.

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
DEADLY ARSNIL AS THE TWO

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
DESPERATE ESCAPE.

Thats's great.

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It won't take long,
will it?

273
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Nah.
Ok!

274
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This won't take long,
will it?

275
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No, not at all.

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How many of these can
we do on our budget?

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
More than you think.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That didn't take
very long did it!

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This spring, dig in and save.

SHE LIKES A MAN
WITH A LITTLE HAIR ON HIS CHEST.

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
BUT DEFINITELY NOT ON HIS BACK.

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
THIS IS HANNAH.

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SHE LIKES A GUY
WITH A SMOOTH STOMACH

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
SHE LIKES MEN
COMPLETELY HAIRLESS

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
AND, NO, SHE DOESN'T
THINK THAT'S WEIRD.

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I DON'T.

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THE PROGLIDE STYLER.

00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
TRIM, SHAVE AND EDGE.

THE ONE TOOL YOU NEED
TO GET THE LOOK SHE WANTS.

298
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000

TALK LONG TO GET THE GUY.

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
ABLE TO DO MUCH MOVING AT ALL.

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
DO YOU KNOW IF HE ALL DAY OR

OUR 20 BLOCK PERIMETER.

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
WHAT WE HAD SET UP AND THOUGHT

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WE HAD HIM PINNED DOWN 1:30

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A.M. THAT MORNING, WE JUST

MISSED IT AND DIDN'T GET THE

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
PERIMETER AS WIDE AS WE NEEDED

329
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
TO DO .

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THAT

331
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
SHOT.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000

HAVE FOUND HIM ALIVE?

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
YOU KNOW, WE HAD ASKED OUR

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000

PINNED DOWN.

350
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
WEMENTED TO MAKE SURE WE DID

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
IT SAFELY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALL OF THE

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
OFFICERS INVOLVED.
>> LAST THING YOU NEEDED WAS

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
COMMUNICATE IN ANY WAY?

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
>> NO.

357
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
WE TRIED TO TALK TO HIM AND WE

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WERE IN 15 OR 20 MINUTES OF

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
HARD NEGOTIATION AND MAKING

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
DEMANDS OF HIM AND HE DID NOT

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
RESPOND.

362
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
WE HAD PUT SOME FLASH BANGS IN

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
TO THE BOAT TO GET HIM TO

364
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
COOPERATE AND ALL HE ENDED UP

365
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
DOING IN THE END MEETING OUR

LIFTING HIS SHIRT.

369
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
>> SO HE WAS ABLE TO LIFT HIS

370
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
SHURT -- SHIRT.

371
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
HE WAS NOT UNCUSHIOUS.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
>> RIGHT.

373
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
HUM.
WELL, BECAUSE OF THAT, I

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THOUGHT HE WAS IN?

376
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000

377
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
INJURIES FROM THE GUN FIGHT AT

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
12:30 A.M..
THE CAR HE ABANDONED HAD BLOOD

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
STAINS AND WE DID A SEARCH

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
INSIDE OF THE PERIMETER.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
WE FOUND APE HOUSE WHERE THERE

382
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
A POOL OF BLOOD OR A CIRCLE OF

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000

THE LAST THING YOU WOULD HAVE

THOUGHT WAS THIS.

391
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000

GROUP, AND WHAT IS YOUR SENSE

748
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
OF WHAT WENT WRONG TWO YEARS

749
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
AGO.
>> FIRST QUESTION, WHAT DO I

750
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
KNOW ABOUT THE GROUP, VERY

751
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
LITTLE.

752
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
EVERYBODY WHO WORKED COUNTER

753
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
TERRORISM IS FULLY AWARE OF

754
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON

755
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
IN THE CAUCUS OF DAGIS STAN

756
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
AND CHECHNYA AND THERE IS A

757
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
LOT THERE.
BUT MOST OF THEIR HISTORIC

758
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE

759
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
RUSSIAN ENTITIES.

760
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT

761
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES.

762
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
THAT IS TO ESTABLISH A LEVEL

763
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
OF AUTONNY FOR CHECHNYA AND

764
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
THEY ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL

765
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
JIHADIST AND SEES UNITED

766
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
STATES AS A PRIMARY ENEMY.

767
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I AM NOT SURED THAT THEY WOULD

768
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
COME TO TARGET US.

769

770
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
HOW THESE TWO SEPARATED AND

771
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
ACCOMPLISH, IS IT SENSE IT WAS

772
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
A TRAINING THING OR WOULD THEY

773
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
HAVE HAD HELP WITH THIS.

774
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
>> THAT IS DIFFICULT TO

775
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
ANSWER.

776
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
IT WOULD SEEM THERE A NUMBER

777
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
MUCH IED'S BUILT .

778
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
IT WOULD SEEM GENERALLY THEY

779
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
WORKED AND ACCORDINGLY I THINK

780
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THEY CERTAINLY HAD TRAINING TO

781
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
DO THAT .

782
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
FURTHER MORE WHEN I WATCHED

783
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THEM MARCH INTO THE SCENE

784
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WHERE THEY LAID DOWN THE

785
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
IED'S.

786
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
THEY WERE PREPARE ALMOST LIKE

787
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
TWO SOLDIERS WALKING DOWN BOL

788
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
STON STREET TO DO THAT.

789
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THEY HAD

790
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
TRAINING ON HOW TO LAY OUT AN

791
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ATTACK PLAN AND FOLLOW THROUGH

792
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
WITH IT.

793
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
>> SINCE THE ATTACKS OF 9/11

794
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
IN 2001, IT A CONCERN THAT

795
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
THIS SORT OF THING WOULD

796
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
HAPPEN, AND THAT JUST A COUPLE

801
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
IS OUR CONCERN GREATER TODAY

802
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000

803
