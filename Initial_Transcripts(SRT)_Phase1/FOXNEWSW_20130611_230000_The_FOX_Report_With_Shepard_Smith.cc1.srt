TONIGHT, PROTESTS.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A POLICE CRACKDOWN.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
MAJOR CHAOS ON THE STREETS

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
OF A MAJOR U.S. ALLY.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
WHAT DOES PRESIDENT OBAMA

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THINK OF HIS FRIENDS NOW?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
PLUS THE MAN BEHIND THE

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
BIGGEST INTELLIGENCE LEAK

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
IN A GENERATION.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
BUT HE MAY NOT BE THROUGH

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
TALKING.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
THERE IS WORD ED SNOWDEN

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
HAS MORE SECRETS TO EXPOSE.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
REVELATIONS.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
>> NOW, THE RUSSIANS SAY

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
THEY MAY GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
AND WE'RE LEARNING MORE

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
ACROBATIC PERFORMER

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
GIRLFRIEND HE LEFT BEHIND.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
PLUS, THE FEDS SAY

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
OVERDRAFT PROTECTION

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
PROGRAMS ARE COSTING US

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BANK

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
SO YOU MIGHT BE BETTER OFF
WITH NO PROTECTION AT ALL.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
AND WHAT'S MORE STRESSFUL?

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
DRIVING OR SKY DIVING?

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
THE ANSWER.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
TUESDAY NIGHT, A WORLDWIDE

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
MANHUNT FOR THE NSA LEAKER

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
AND THE LAWYERS ARE ALREADY

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
HARD AT WORK.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
NOW FACING TWO LAWSUITS FOR

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
MONITORING THE PHONE

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
AMERICANS.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
THE AMERICAN CIVIL

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
LIBERTIES UNION REPORTS IT

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE
ARGUING THE PROGRAM

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
VIOLATES BOTH FREEDOM OF

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
SPEECH AND PRIVACY RIGHTS.

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
ACCORDING TO THE ACLU, IT

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
REQUIRING EVERY AMERICAN TO

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
FILE A DAILY REPORT WITH

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
EVERY PERSON THEY TALKED TO

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ON THE PHONE, THE TIME OF

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
EACH CALL, AND THE LENGTH

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
OF EVERY CONVERSATION.

66
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
IT'S FOX TOP STORY AND

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
TRACE GALLAGHER IS ON IT

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
OUR WEST COAST NEWS HUB.

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
WHAT ARE THE OTHER

71
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
ARGUMENTS OF THIS LAWSUIT

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
TRACE.
>> THE ACLU LAWSUIT SHEP,

73
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
GOES EVEN A STEP FURTHER

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAN WHAT YOU SAID

75
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF

76
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
VIOLATING OUR VERY RIGHT OF

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
ASSOCIATION.

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE HANG

79
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
OUT WITH, SAYING AND I'M

80
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
QUOTING HERE IT GIVES

81
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
GOVERNMENT COMPREHENSIVE

82
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000

WEALTH OF DETAIL ABOUT OUR

INTIMATE ASSOCIATIONS.

86
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THE SECOND LAWSUIT WAS

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
FILED BY A FORMER DOJ

88
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
PROSECUTOR WHO HAS SUED THE

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

90
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
BEFORE.

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
BUT ALSO BY THE PARENTS OF

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
MICHAEL STRANGE.

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
HE WAS AMONG 25 NAVY SEALS

94
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
AND FIVE OTHER AMERICANS

95
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
KILLED IN A HELICOPTER

CRASH IN AFGHANISTAN BACK

97
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
IN 2011.

98
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THE PARENTS ALLEGE THE

99
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE

100
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
ACCESSED THEIR PHONE

101
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
RECORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE

102
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT FOR

103
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THE CRASH THAT KILLED THEIR

104
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
SON.

105
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS YET

106
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
TO COMMENT, SHEP, ON EITHER

107
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
ONE OF THESE LAWSUITS.

108
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
>> Shepard: IN ADDITION, WE

109
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
ARE TO BELIEVE THAT THE

110
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRACKS

111
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO,

112
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
YET, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

113
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
CANNOT LOCATE A 29-YEAR-OLD

114
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

115
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
>> AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

116
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS

117
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
LEFT HONG KONG.

118
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
7 MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT

119
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
CITY, 65,000 HOTEL ROOMS.

120
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
AND NOW THERE IS WORD THAT

121
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
RUSSIA MIGHT BE WILLING TO

122
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

123
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS IF THE

124
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
REQUEST IS MADE IT WILL BE

125
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
CONSIDERED.

126
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM, HE

127
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO GO TO

128
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN

129
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HONG KONG SNOWDEN WOULD

130
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
HAVE TO APPLY.

131
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
HE ONCE TOLD THE GUARDIAN

132
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
NEWSPAPER THAT HE DOES NOT

133
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
EXPECT TO BE FREE FOREVER

134
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
THOUGH, LISTEN.

135
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
>> YOU CAN'T COME FORWARD

136
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
AGAINST THE WORLD'S MOST

137
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE

138
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AGENCY AND BE COMPLETELY

139
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FREE FROM RISK BECAUSE THEY

140
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
ARE SUCH POWERFUL

141
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ADVERSARIES THAT NO ONE CAN

142
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
MEANINGFULLY OPPOSE THEM.

143
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
IF THEY WANT TO GET YOU

144
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THEY WILL GET NEW TIME.

145
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
>> SNOWDEN LEFT THE HAWAII

146
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HOME HE SHARED WITH HIS

147
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
GIRLFRIEND LINDSEY MILLS

148
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
THE SELF-PROCLAIMED POLE

149

DANCER.

150
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
HE LEFT THREE WEEKS AGO.
AS PART OF THIS

151
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
INVESTIGATION THAT HOME

152
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WILL BE SEARCHED AND HIS

153
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
GIRLFRIEND WILL BE

154
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
QUESTIONED.

155
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SHEP?

156
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
>> Shepard: TRACE, THE NSA

157
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
LEAKER HAS A LOT MORE TO

158
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
LEAK.
THAT'S THE WORD FROM ONE OF

159
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
THE COLUMNISTS WHO

160
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
PRESENTED HIS STORY.

161
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

162
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT

163
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000

NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, A

166
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
MONTH, HOW FAST WE GET THE

167
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
NEXT ONE OUT IS SOMETHING

168
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WE ARE DECIDING NOW.

169
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
BUT THERE ARE DOZENS OF

170
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
STORIES GENERATED BY THE

171
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000

172
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
AND WE INTEND TO PURSUE

173
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

174
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> Shepard: HE ALSO SAYS

175
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
SNOWDEN IS READY TO FACE

176
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
THE CONSEQUENCES AND

177
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WHATEVER IS COMING HIS WAY.

178
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000

RELEASE ALL GOVERNMENT

SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS.
THEY SAY THAT WILL PROVE

183
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE

AT DEMONSTRATORS.

946
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
THOSE DEMONSTRATORS IN TURN

THROWING STONES AND SETTING

948
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000

950
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
UNHAPPY ABOUT A NUMBER OF

FREEDOMS.

955
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS

956
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000

TEED BY UPHOLDING PEOPLE'S

958
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
RIGHTS.
TURKEY IS, OF COURSE, A KEY

959
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
ALLY.
SHARING BORDERS WITH SYRIA,

960
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
IRAQ AND IRAN.

961
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000

SPREAD TO 78 CITIES THERE.

963
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
BUT THE MOST VIOLENT SCENES

964
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
ARE PLAYING OUT IN ISTANBUL

965
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE

966
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
CITY IN AN AREA KNOWN AS

968
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE SEEING
IMAGES OF THE

969
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
CONFRONTATION.

970
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
WHERE FIRES RAGING AND BOTH
SIDES CONTINUE TO STAND

971
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
THEIR GROUND.

972
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE

973
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
HOUSE WITH REACTION

974
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
SPOKESWOMAN FROM THE

SECURITY COUNSEL KATELYN

976
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
HAYDEN WHO SAYS THERE IS

977
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
CONCERN IT ABOUT THE WHITE

978
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000

979
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
VIOLENCE.
SHE GOES ON TO SAY QUOTE WE

980
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT ANY

981
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
WE BELIEVE TODAY'S EVENTS

987
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
REINFORCE THE NEED TO

988
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
RESOLVE THIS SITUATION

989
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THROUGH I DO DOG AS WE HAVE

990

LONG-TERM STABILITY,
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY IS

992
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
BEST GUARANTEED BY

993
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
UPHOLDING THE FUNDAMENTAL

994
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
FREEDOMS OF EXPRESSION,

995
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ASSEMBLY ASSOCIATION AND A

996
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
FREE AND INDEPENDENT MEDIA

997
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
YOU CAN SEE THE DEEP

998
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
CONCERN THE WHITE HOUSE IS

999
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
EXPRESSING TONIGHT ABOUT

1000
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THESE PICTURES AND

1001
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
IMPORTANT TO NOTE IT WAS

1002
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
JUST LAST MONTH THAT THE

1003
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
PRIME MINISTER OF TURKEY,

1004
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
PRIME MINISTER WAS HERE AT

1005
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING

1006
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.

1007
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
REMEMBER, THEY HAD THAT

1008
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
NEWS CONFERENCE IN THE ROSE

1009
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
GARDEN IN THE RAIN WHERE

1010
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
THE MARINE WAS HOLDING UP

1011
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
THE UMBRELLA FOR THE
PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT

1012
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
AT THAT POINT WAS ENGULFED

1013
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
IN AWFUL THESE

1014
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
CONTROVERSIES ABOUT THE IRS

1015
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
AND BENGHAZI, ET CETERA.

1016
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
LOST IN ALL OF THAT

1017
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
ATTENTION ON THOSE OTHER

1018
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
CONTROVERSIES, IS THE FACT

1019
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THAT BOTH PRIME MINISTER

1020
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD

1021
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
VERY SERIOUS SUBSTANTIVE

1022
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
TALKS ABOUT THE U.S. MAYBE

1023
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
GETTING MORE AGGRESSIVE IN

1024
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
SYRIA SINCE THAT IS RIGHT

1025
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
ON THE TURKISH BORDER.

1026
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
NOW, THE IDEA THOUGH THAT

1027
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
TURKEY MIGHT PLAY A

1028
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN

1029
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
HELPING THE U.S. AND SYRIA

1030
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
IS ALL BUT LOST, GIVEN THE

1031
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
FACT THAT HE HAS HIS OWN

1032
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
PROBLEMS INSIDE THE BORDERS

1033
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
OF TURKEY.

1034
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
THE LAST THING HE IS GOING

1035
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
TO BE FOCUSING ON RIGHT NOW

1036
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
IS HELPING THE U.S. WITH

1037
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
THIS SITUATION IN SYRIA,

1038
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
SHEP.

1039
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
>> Shepard: WIDELY SEEN AS
POORLY HANDLED IN THE EARLY

1040
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
GOING HAVE THE PRESIDENT

1041
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF
TURKEY BEEN IN CONTACT

1042
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
SINCE ALL OF THIS STARTED?

1043
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
>> U.S. OFFICIALS SAY SO

1044
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
FAR THERE HAS NOT BEEN

1045
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE

1046
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
PRESIDENT AND PRIME

1047
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
MINISTER.
INTERESTING THAT WHEN THEY

1048
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
HAD THOSE TALKS HERE IN MID

1049
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
PLAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE

1050
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
ONE OF THE CONCESSIONS

1051
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT FROM

1052
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
THE PRIME MINISTER, PRIME

1053
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
MINISTER WAS TO GET TURKISH

1054
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
SUPPORT FOR A UPCOMING

1055
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
CONFERENCE IN GENEVA TO TRY

1056
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
AND DEAL WITH THE FUTURE OF

1057
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
SYRIA.

1058
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE

1059
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THAT IF ASSAD DOES GO,

1060
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
PRESIDENT ASSAD DOES GO IN

1061
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
SYRIA, THERE WILL BE SOME

1062
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
SORT OF PEACEFUL

1063
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
TRANSITION AGAIN THE IDEA

1064
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
THAT PRIME MINISTER WILL

1065
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
NOW BE FOCUSED ON A

1066
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
PEACEFUL TRANSITION IN
SYRIA IS LOST IN THE FACT

1067
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
HE HAS GOT MAJOR PROBLEMS

1068
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
ON HIS OWN HANDS RIGHT NOW.

1069
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THIS IS A BIG CONCERN FOR

1070
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT

1071
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SHEP, BECAUSE THEY HAVE

1072
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
ALREADY GOT THIS

1073
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
INSTABILITY IN SYRIA.

1074
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
INSTABILITY, INSTABILITY

1075
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
SPREADING INTO TURKEY, A

1076
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
KEY U.S. AL FLY THAT REGION

1077
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
IS A DESPERATE SITUATION

1078
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

1079
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
TONIGHT SHEP.

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
>> Shepard: INDEED IT IS,

1081
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
ED HENRY AT THE WHITE

1082

1083
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK LIVE

1084
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
THIS IS TAKSIM A LARGE

1085
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
SQUARE IN THE CENTER OF THE

1086
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
CITY.
ANOTHER SQUARE NEAR WHERE

1087
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
ALL OF THIS BEGAN.

1088
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST A VERY

1089
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
SMALL PARK.

1090
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
AND IT WAS VERY CLOSE TO

1091
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
THIS AND HAD WHAT AMOUNTED

1092
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
TO THE LAST GREEN SPACE IN

1093
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
ALL OF THIS PART OF THE

1094
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
CITY.
THAT'S HOW ALL OF THIS

1095
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
BEGAN WITH A GROUP OF

1096
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
PROTESTERS WHO WANTED TO

1097
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
SAVE THE TREES.

1098
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS

1099
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
ASKED TO MEET WITH THEM

THIS WILL NOW SPREAD AND IT

1109
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
WILL GROW.

1110
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
JOINING US NOW FROM CONTEXT

1111
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000

SIR, WITH WHAT DEGREE OF

1116
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
CONCERN DO YOU WATCH THIS?

1117
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S

1118
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
OBVIOUSLY VERY TROUBLING.

1119
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
BUT THIS IS REALLY WHAT

1120
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
BEGAN AS A DEMONSTRATION

1121
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
ABOUT URBAN REDEVELOPMENT

1122
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
AND THEE TREES IS REALLY

1123
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
NOW A PROXY FOR THE FIFTH%

1124
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
OF THE POPULATION OF TURKEY

1125
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
THAT DOESN'T FEEL THAT THE

1126
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
PRIME MINISTER REPRESENTS

1127
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
THEIR INTERESTS.

1128
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
AND I THINK IT'S ALL GOING

1129
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
TO BE IN HOW THE PRIME

1130
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
MINISTER HANDLES THIS AND

1131
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
SO FAR HE HAS GONE BACK AND

1132
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
FORTH BETWEEN BEING

1133
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
CONCILIATORY AND BEING

1134
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
TOUGH.
IN TURKEY, ULTIMATELY THE

1135
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
TOUGH CENTRAL GOVERNMENT

1136
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
RESPONSE IS GOING TO CARRY

1137
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THE DAY.

1138
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
>> RIGHT NOW, THERE THERE

1139
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
IS -- THEY ARE STILL

1140
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
ALLOWING THE PROTESTERS TO

1141
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
BE IN THIS SMALLER PARK.

1142
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
GIZY PARK I BELIEVE IT'S

1143
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
PRONOUNCED.
THEY ARE ALLOWING THE

1144
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
PROTESTS TO CONTINUE THERE

1145
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THE CONCERN IS IF POLICE

1146
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
MOVE IN ON THAT AND SHOULD

1147
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
ANYBODY BE INJURED, FOUR

1148
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BEEN

1149
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
KILLED.

1150
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THIS COULD CAN HE IS LATE
TO SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT

1151
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO

1152
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
CONTROL.

1153
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
IS THAT YOUR TAKE ON IT.

1154
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
>> RIGHT NOW THE MAJORITY

1155
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
OF PEOPLE WHEN I SAY THAT I

1156
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
MEAN THE PEOPLE OUT IN THE

1157
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
RURAL AREAS, THE SILENT

1158
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
SUPPORT THE PRIME MINISTER.

1159
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE ASIAN

1160
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
SIDE OF THE -- THEY SUPPORT

1161
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
THE POLICE.

1162
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
BUT, IF THERE IS ANY

1163
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
FURTHER VIOLENCE OR

1164
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
ESCALATION OF THIS, IT

1165
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
COULD TRIGGER A BACK FIRE

1166
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
FOR THE PRIME MINISTER.

1167
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HE HAS GOT TO BE VERY VERY

1168
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CAREFUL ABOUT HOW HE

1169
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
HANDLES THIS IN THE COMING

1170
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
24 HOUR PEOPLE.

1171
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
>> Shepard: HE NEEDS

1172
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
DIALOGUE AND SO FAR THE

1173
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
PROTESTERS HAVE DENIED IT?

1174
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
HE DOES NEED TO SHOW THAT

1175
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
HE IS WILLING TO REACH OUT.

1176
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
HE HAS DEVELOPED THIS

1177
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
REPUTATION, A VERY TOUGH

1178
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
LEADER BUT FOR HIM, IS HE

1179
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

1180
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
AND HE WANTS TO BE THE

1181
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
FIRST POPULARLY ELECTED

1182
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
PRESIDENT IN TURKISH

1183
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HISTORY IN 2014.

1184
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
FOR HIM, HE IS GOING TO

1185
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
NEED TO HANDLE THIS VERY

1186
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
CAREFULLY.
>> AMBASSADOR STEWART

1187
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
HOLIDAY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

1188
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
THAT HE HAS ALREADY TRIED

1189
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
TO PUT MORE POWERS TO THAT

1190
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY AN

1191
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
OFFICE TO WHICH HE WANTS TO

1192
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
MOVE.
WE SHALL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS

1193
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000

1194
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000

NIGHT AND THE WEEKS AHEAD.

ZIMMERMAN'S DRAMATIC WEIGHT

1204
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
GAIN.
PLUS, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO

1205
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
STAY AWAKE AT WORK.

1206
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE

1207
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
HANDLING SOMEBODY'S MONEY.

1208
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT ONE

1209
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
WORKER'S NAP ON HIS

1210
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
COMPUTER KEYBOARD THAT

1211
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
NEARLY COST HIS BANK

1212
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

1213
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000

to sleep comfortably together

1233
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000

TRAVON MARTIN SUPPORTERS

HE HAS HIS OWN SUPPORTERS

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
CLAIMING THAT HE WAS ACTING

1274
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

1275
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
TODAY TRAVON MARTIN'S

1279
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
ZIMMERMAN.
MAN, HE LOOKS DIFFERENT.

1280
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
WAY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE

1281
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000

1287
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
HEALTHY.

1288
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I THINK THE STRESS IS

1289
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
UNCANNY.
I THINK EVERYBODY RESPONDS

1290
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
TO STRESS IN A DIFFERENT

1291
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
WAY.

1292
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
