1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP DEALS WITH

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
THE FALL OUT FROM HIS DECISION

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TO FIRE JAMES COMEY AND THE

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
WAR OF WORDS THAT FOLLOW.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, I'M

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
JULIE AND THIS IS THE FOX
REPORT.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
JULIE: THE PRESIDENT

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
DELIVERING HIS FIRST
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH SINCE

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
TAKING OFFICE.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
TO GRADUATES AT LIBERTY

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
UNIVERSITY HE REFLECTED ON THE

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
FIRST FEW MONTHS OF HIS

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
PRESIDENCY AND SHARED LESSONS

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
THAT HE HAS LEARNED AND
OFFERED ADVICE TO THE

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
GRADUATES, CALLING THEM THE

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
NEXT GENERATION OF AMERICAN
LEADERS.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
MEANWHILE BACK IN DC, AT LEAST

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
EIGHT CANDIDATES TO LEAD THE

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
FBI VISITED THE JUSTICE

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
DEPARTMENT FOR INTERVIEWS

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
TODAY IN THE SEARCH TO REPLACE

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
FIRED DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
WHO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
WILL RERE: PLACE BY NEXT
FRIDAY.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
NOW, THE NEW YORK TIMES IS

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
REPORTING THIS WEEK PRESIDENT

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
TRUMP DEMANDED A PLEDGE OF

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
LOYALTY FROM COMEY SHORTLY

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
AFTER TAKING OFFICE.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE
DENIES.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
MEANTIME SAID SUCH A QUESTION

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
WOULDN'T BE INAPPROPRIATE IN A

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
CONVERSATION WITH JUDGE, WHICH

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
CAN BE SEEN LATER TONIGHT.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
BUT WE'VE GOT A PREVIEW.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
WATCH.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
>> PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT THE

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
QUESTION THAT APPARENTLY THE

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
NEW YORK ASKED COMEY WHETHER

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
OR NOT YOU HAD HIS LOYALTY WAS

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
POSSIBLY INAPPROPRIATE.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
COULD YOU SEE HOW THEY WOULD

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THINK THAT?

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
>> NO.  I READ THAT ARTICLE.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I DON'T THINK IT'S

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
INAPPROPRIATE, NUMBER ONE.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
>> DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
>> NO.
NO, I DIDN'T.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
BAD QUESTION TO ASK.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I THINK LOYALTY TO THE

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
COUNTRY.
LOYALTY TO THE UNITED STATES

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
IS IMPORTANT.  YOU KNOW, I

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
MEAN, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
DEFINE LOYALTY.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
NUMBER ONE.

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
NUMBER TWO, I DON'T KNOW HOW

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THAT GOT THERE BECAUSE I

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
DIDN'T ASK THAT QUESTION.

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IN

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A TWEET YOU SAID THAT THERE

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
MIGHT BE TAPE-RECORDINGS?

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
TRUMP: THAT, I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT.

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
ALL I WANT IS FOR COMEY TO BE

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
HONEST, AND I HOPE HE WILL BE,

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I HOPE.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
JULIE: ALL OF THIS IN THE

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
SHADOW OF A REPORT NOW

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
BREAKING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
TEST FIRED YET ANOTHER

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
BALLISTIC MISSILE, AND WE HAVE

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
FOX NEWS TEAM COVERAGE FOR YOU

76
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
TONIGHT.

77
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
ELLISON BARBER WATCHING THE

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SEARCH FOR FBI DIRECTOR, BUT

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
WE BEGIN WITH CAROLINE WHO

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
JOINS US NOW LIVE AT THE WHITE

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
HOUSE WITH THE LATEST ON THE

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO

83
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
DISMISS JAMES COMEY.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
WHAT IS THE FALLOUT TODAY?

85
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
>> I THINK THE CALLS FOR THE

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONER

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
GETTING LOUDER THIS WEEKEND.
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
INVESTIGATE IF THERE WERE ANY

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
TIES BETWEEN THE TRUMP

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
CAMPAIGN OR TRUMP SURROGATES

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AND RUSSIA.

92
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
THE FBI WAS LEADING ONE OF THE

93
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
MAIN INVESTIGATIONS ALREADY IN

94
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
PLACE IN WASHINGTON WHEN

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
MR. TRUMP FIRED COMEY THIS

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
WEEK.

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
THAT INVESTIGATION CONTINUES

98
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
STRONGLY THIS WEEKEND.

99
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
HERE'S WHAT MR. TRUMP TOLD

100
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
JENIN PIRO.

101
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A

102
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
POSITION WHERE IT'S NOT DONE

103
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
CORRECTLY.

104
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SO LET THEM DO IT CORRECTLY.

105
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
LET THEM TAKE THEIR TIME.

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
LET THEM DO IT CORRECTLY.

107
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSE,

108
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THE SENATE, THE FBI.

109
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
>> SO, NO, INDEPENDENT
COMMISSION?

110
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
TRUMP: I DON'T THINK YOU NEED

111
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
IT.

112
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I MEAN, HONESTLY, WHATEVER'S

113
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
GOING TO DO THE BEST.

114
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
>> BUT IT'S CONGRESS THAT

115
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
WOULD MAKE THE DECISION ON

116
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
WHETHER OR NOT AN INDEPENDENT

117
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
COUNSEL IS NEEDED IN THIS

118
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
CASE.

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
MR. TRUMP ALSO CAUSED

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
CONTROVERSY THIS WEEK WHEN HE

121
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
TWEETED, AND MR. COMEY TWEETED

122
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
TO THE PRESS HE BETTER HOPE

123
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THERE ARE NO TAPES OF THE

124
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
CONVERSATIONS.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS FAILED TO

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ELABORATE ON THAT THIS
WEEKEND.

127
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
BUT WE ARE TOLD BY SENATOR

128
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
MARK WARNER IF THOSE TAPES DO

129
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
INDEED EXIST, CONGRESS WANTS

130
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THEM.
JULIE.

131
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
JULIE: VERY INTERESTING.

132
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT

133
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE LAUNCH?

134
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?

135
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN.

136
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
SOUTH KOREA'S REPORTING THAT

137
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THIS LAUNCH WENT ABOUT

138
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
435 MILES.

139
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
IF THAT'S TRUE, IT WOULD BE

140
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
CONSIDERED A SUCCESS.
A PENTAGON OFFICIAL CONFIRMS

141
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
THE FOX NEWS THAT NORTH KOREA

142
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
LAUNCHED SOME TYPE OF

143
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
BALLISTIC MISSILE THAT

144
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
OFFICIAL SAYS THE U.S. PACIFIC

145
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
COMMAND AND STRATEGIC COMMAND

146
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ARE STILL SATISFYING.

147
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IF THIS INITIAL REPORTING

148
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
BEARS OUT, THIS WOULD BE

149
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
KIM JONG-UN'S FIFTH ATTEMPT AT

150
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
THE BALLISTIC LAUNCH THIS PAST

151
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
MONTH AND HIS SUCCESSFUL ONE.

152
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM HAS

153
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
BEGIN OVER THE DETAILS WITH

154
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
MR. TRUMP HERE AT THE WHITE

155
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
HOUSE.

156
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE TIMING, THOUGH, JULIE, IS

157
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
VERY CURIOUS ON THIS.

158
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
THIS COMES ON THE SAME DAY

159
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THAT A NORTH KOREAN SENIOR

160
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
DIPLOMAT SAID THAT THE NORTH

161
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SITTING

162
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
DOWN WITH U.S. OFFICIALS IF

163
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CONDITIONS WERE SET RIGHT.

164
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
JULIE.
.

165
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
JULIE: ALL RIGHT, CAROLINE,

166
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

167
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
AND FOR MORE ON ALL OF THIS,

168
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
TUNE IN LATER TONIGHT TO JUDGE

169
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
JENIN PIRO'S CONVERSATION WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHERE HE ALSO

170
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
ADDRESSES HIS REMARKS ABOUT

171
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
ENDING LIVE WHITE HOUSE PRESS

172
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
BRIEFINGS.

173
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TRUMP: WHEN WE HAVE THOSE

174
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
PRESS CONFERENCES, I ACTUALLY

175
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
SAID WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM

176
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
BECAUSE SARAH HUCKABEE --

177
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
>> 100 YEARS WE'VE BEEN

178
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
DOING.

179
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
YOU CAN'T PUT AN END TO THAT.

180
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
>> THERE'S NEVER BEEN ACTION
LIKE THIS.

181
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THIS IS CRAZY.

182
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING HIGHER

183
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
RATINGS -- THEY'RE GETTING

184
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
HIGHER RATINGS ON THIS PRESS
CONFERENCES.

185
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
>> WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY

186
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
CONSIDER STOPPING THESE PRESS
SESSIONS?

187
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
>> NO, WE WOULD DO IT IN A

188
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
DIFFERENT WAY.

189
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
JULIE: YOU CAN SEE THE REST OF

190
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000

EIGHT NAMES TOSSED IN THE

THIS AFTER THE FIRING OF JAMES

203
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR.

204
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THE

205
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
WHITE HOUSE COULD NAME COMEY'S

206
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
REPLACEMENT AS EARLY AS

207
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
FRIDAY.

ALLISON, EIGHT INTERVIEWEES.

212
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS IT.

213
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
THERE WILL BE NONE TOMORROW.

214
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ANYONE TALKING AS THEY LEAVE?

215
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> NO.

216
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
MOST OF THEM AREN'T EVEN

217
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
STOPPING THEIR CARS.

218
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AT BEST, THEY ARE SAYING NO

219
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
COMMENT IN THE LAST HOUR,

220
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
THOUGH, WE HAVE HAD TWO LAST

221
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000

222
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000

MICHIGAN CONGRESSMAN MIKE

226
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
RODGERS, WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE

227
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
CAP FOR TODAY.

228
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
AS YOU SAID, THAT WOULD PUT US

229
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AT EIGHT.

230
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
SOURCES ARE DESCRIBING THESE

231
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
MEETINGS AS SUBSTANTIVE

232
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
DISCUSSIONS.

233
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
GREAT CANDIDATES, SUPREMELY

234
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
WELL-QUALIFIED.

235
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
NOW, THE ADMINISTRATION IS

236
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING ABOUT A

237
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
DOZEN CANDIDATES FOR THIS

238
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
JOB.

239
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A

240
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

241
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
ALREADY INTERVIEWED A HANDFUL

242
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
OF THEM TODAY, INCLUDING

243
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ACTING FBI DIRECTOR ANDREW

244
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
MCCABE, MICHAEL GARCIA, WHO

245
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
WAS A JUDGE FROM NEW YORK,

246
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SITTING TEXAS GOVERNOR, ALEX

247
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000

250
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
NOW, THE LAST INTERVIEW WE'RE

251
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
EXPECTING TO SEE TODAY IS MIKE

252
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
RODGERS.

253
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
HE SHOULD BE HERE WITHIN THE
HOUR.

254
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HE RECEIVED A VERY BIG

255
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
ENDORSEMENT TODAY FROM THE FBI

256
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
AGENTS ASSOCIATION.

257
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
THEY REPRESENT A LOT OF ACTIVE

258
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
AND A FORMER FBI AGENT MIKE

259
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
RODGERS WAS IN THE FBI HIMSELF

260
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
BEFORE HE LEFT TO GO INTO

261
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
POLITICS.

262
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
JULIE.
.
JULIE: ALL RIGHT.  AND WHAT IS

263
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
THE TIMETABLE FOR ALL OF

264
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THIS?

265
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
COULD THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE

266
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A DECISION SOON?

267
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>> WELL, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

268
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THERE COULD

269
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BE A DECISION AS EARLY AS THIS

270
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WEEK.

271
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID

272
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
ON AIR FORCE ONE.

273
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
>> ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE VERY

274
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
WELL KNOWN.  YOU KNOW, THEY'VE

275
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
BEEN VETTED OVER THEIR

276
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
LIFETIME, ESSENTIALLY.

277
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
BUT VERY WELL KNOWN.

278
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
HIGHLY RESPECTED.

279
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE.

280
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT OF THE

281
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
FBI.

282
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
>> THE FBI DIRECTOR IS A

283
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
POSITION THAT TYPICALLY LASTS

284
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
FOR TEN YEARS AND BEFORE THAT

285
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TENURE CAN BEGIN, THE

286
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
CANDIDATE WOULD NEED SENATE

287
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
CONFIRMATION.
JULIE, BACK TO YOU.

288
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
JULIE: ALL RIGHT, ELLISON,

289
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

290
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
A FOX NEWS ALERT WITH THE

291
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
PENTAGON CONFIRMING RIGHT NOW

292
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
NORTH KOREA HAS LAUNCHED SOME

293
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
KIND OF BALLISTIC MISSILE.

294
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
THEY APPARENTLY TEST FIRED IT

295
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
EARLY SUNDAY MORNING FROM A
PROVINCE IN THE WESTERN PART

296
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OF THE COUNTRY.

297
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
WE ARE AWAITING THE PENTAGON'S

298
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
RESPONSE AND ASSESSMENT.

299
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WE ARE ALSO AWAITING A

300
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
RESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

301
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ON ALL OF THIS.

302
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THIS LATEST LAUNCH COMES AMID

303
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
HEIGHTENED TENSIONS BETWEEN

304
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THE U.S. AND KIM JONG-UN AFTER

305
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A SERIES OF FAILED LAUNCH

306
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
ATTEMPTS.

307
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S, IN

308
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ESSENCEPRESIDENTPRESIDENT

309
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
TRUMP'S INSISTENCE ALL OPTIONS

310
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ARE ON THE TABLE.

311
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WOULD BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN

312
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
DIALOGUE WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IF THE

313
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT.

314
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
JOINING ME NOW WITH ANALYSIS

315
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
ON ALL OF THIS, JORDAN, AN

316
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
EXPERT ON ASIA, AUTHOR OF

317
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA
TAKES ON THE WORLD.

318
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

319
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
TALKING TO US.

320
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD

321
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
TO TALK HERE UNDER THESE SORT

322
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
OF CONDITIONS IN THAT NORTH,

323
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
ONCE AGAIN, HAS TEST FIRED

324
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
ANOTHER MISSILE IN THE PAST

325
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
AND, IN FACT, IN THE LAST

326
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
MONTH, YOU THOUGHT PERHAPS IT

327
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
WAS A FAILED LAUNCH THAT WAS

328
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
BEING REPORTED BUT YOU, IN

329
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
FACT, THOUGHT IT WAS

330
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
INTENTIONAL FOR IT TO LAND ON

331
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
NORTH KOREA'S SOIL SO THAT THE

332
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
EVIDENCE WOULDN'T BE

333
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ACCESSIBLE TO OTHERS.

334
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED

335
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
HERE?

336
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>> WELL, 435 MILES IS A

337
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
SUCCESSFUL TEST, AND I THINK

338
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN'S ARE

339
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
DOING IS BY THE TIMING OF THIS

340
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
LAUNCH, THEY ARE THINKING THAT

341
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THAT IS GOING TO HELP THEM GET

342
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
THESE NEGOTIATIONS STARTED.

343
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THE ONE THING NORTH KOREA

344
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SEEMS TO WANT, BECAUSE WE'VE

345
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
SEEN IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE

346
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
DAYS A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES

347
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
IN THIS REGARD, THEY SEEM TO

348
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
WANT RELIEF FROM SANCTIONS.

349
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
AND OF COURSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP

350
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
IS GOING THE OTHER WAY WANTING

351
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
TO PUT ON TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON

352
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
NORTH KOREA, SO THIS IS COMING

353
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
TO A HEAD.

354
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
AND I THINK THE MISSILE LAUNCH

355
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WAS AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE

356
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND MOON,

357
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
THE NEW PRESIDENT OF

358
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
SOUTH KOREA TO THE BARGAINING

359
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
TABLE.

360
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
JULIE: SO YOU THINK THIS WAS

361
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AN INTENTIONAL MESSAGE?

362
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THIS TEST LAUNCH TODAY WAS AN

363
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
INTENTIONAL MESSAGE TO

364
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

365
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
>> YES.  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE

366
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
DIDN'T SEE A MISSILE LAUNCH IN

367
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
THE RUN-UP TO THE SOUTH KOREAN
ELECTIONS.

368
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
AND THE REASON IS THAT THE

369
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
CANDIDATE THAT NORTH KOREA

370
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
WANTED WHO EVENTUALLY WON WAS

371
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
LEADING.

372
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
AND I THINK THEY WANTED TO

373
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
PREVENT ANYTHING FROM

374
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HAPPENING THAT WOULD DERAIL

375
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HIS CANDIDACY.

376
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
NOW THAT MOON IS ACTUALLY

377
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA, WE

378
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
KNOW THAT MOON WANTS TO START

379
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA.

380
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
HE ALSO WANTS TO PROVIDE AIDE

381
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TO THE NORTH KOREAN'S.

382
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
SO I THINK THE NORTH KOREAN'S

383
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
RIGHT NOW THINK THAT THIS IS A

384
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
PERFECT TIME FOR THEM TO

385
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
REALLY CORRAL THE

386
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,

387
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.

388
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
GET THEM TO SIT DOWN AND DO

389
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
WHAT NORTH KOREA WANTS.

390
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
JULIE: IN LATE APRIL, THE

391
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD

392
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
WARNED IN AN INTERVIEW TO

393
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
REUTERS THAT A QUOTE MAJOR,

394
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
MAJOR CONFLICT WITH THE NORTH

395
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WAS POSSIBLE, BUT THAT HE

396
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
WOULD PREFER A DIPLOMATIC

397
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
OUTCOME TO THE DISPUTE OVER

398
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
ITS NUCLEAR MISSILE PROGRAMS.

399
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
AND THEN WE HEAR ABOUT THIS

400
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
PERSON FROM THE REGION FROM

401
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THAT REGION SAYING THEY WOULD

402
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
CONSIDER SITTING DOWN WITH THE

403
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
U.S.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD

404
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
IF THE CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT.

405
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?
>> WELL, I THINK ALL OF THIS

406
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
RIGHT NOW IS REALLY CONFUSION

407
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
ON EVERYONE'S PART.

408
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION

409
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
RIGHT NOW CONSUMED BY THE

410
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
COMEY CRISIS.

411
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THE NORTH KOREAN'S SEE THAT,

412
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
AND I THINK THAT THEY BELIEVE

413
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THAT THEY CAN GIVE PRESIDENT

414
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TRUMP AN OUT TO SORT OF GIVE

415
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
HIM HEADLINES THAT HE WOULD

416
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
PREFER TO HAVE.

417
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
NOW, I THINK THE

418
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
NORTH KOREAN'S ARE TIMING THIS
WRONG.

419
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
BUT NONETHELESS, THAT'S THE

420
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
WAY THEY THINK.

421
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
THEY THINK IN WAYS WHICH ARE

422
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAYS

423
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
WE DO, AND SO I THINK

424
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
SOMETIMES THEY GET THEMSELVES

425
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
INTO TROUBLE.

426
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
BUT NONETHELESS, IN THEIR WAY

427
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
OF THINKING, THEY BELIEVE THIS

428
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
IS A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW TO

429
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
PUT THE U.S. ON THE BACK FEET.

430
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
JULIE: YOU HAVE SAID TO ME IN

431
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
THE PAST THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

432
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
HAS TRIED TO COAX THE CHINESE

433
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
TO HELP ON NORTH KOREA.

434
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
TRIED TO FLATTER THE CHINESE,

435
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
PRESIDENT PING, AND HE'S

436
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
IGNORED BLATANT CHINESE
SUPPORT.

437
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
WHAT DO WE DO WITH CHINA?

438
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
WHAT MESSAGE DO WE SEND TO

439
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
THEM?

440
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
AND WAS OUR MESSAGE THAT WE

441
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
SENT TO SYRIA STRONG ENOUGH TO

442
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
SEND A MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA

443
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS?
>> YEAH.  I THINK PRESIDENT

444
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
TRUMP NEEDS TO GIVE THE

445
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
CHINESE A DEADLINE.

446
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
AS YOU POINT OUT, THEY

447
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
FLATTERED THE CHINESE RULER

448
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
AND ALSO HAS FLATTERED

449
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
KIM JONG-UN LAST WEEK SAYING

450
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THAT KIM IS A SMART COOKIE,

451
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THAT TRUMP WOULD BE HONORED TO

452
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
TALK TO THE NORTH KOREAN
LEADER.

453
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SO CLEARLY, THIS IS AN ATTEMPT

454
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I THINK TO AT LEAST ESTABLISH

455
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A DIALOGUE PATH.

456
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP

457
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
HAS SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT IF

458
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
THE CHINESE DON'T HELP THAT IF

459
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THE NORTH KOREAN'S DON'T

460
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
DISARM, THAT HE WILL DO THIS

461
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
ON HIS OWN AND THAT THE UNITED

462
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
STATES HAS THE ABILITY TO DO
THAT.

463
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THAT'S A THREAT, OF COURSE,

464
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
AND THAT'S HANGING OVER THE

465
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
HEADS OF THE NORTH KOREAN'S

466
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
WHO OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PREVENT

467
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
THAT EVENTUALITY.
SO I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO

468
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
SEE RIGHT NOW IF THEY CAN

469
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK.

470
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
YOU KNOW, THE CHINESE HAVE

471
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
ALWAYS WANTED TO TALK.

472
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
NOW THE SOUTH KOREANS WANT TO

473
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
TALK.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS OPEN TO THE

474
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
IDEA OF TALKING.

475
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
SO IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT FOR

476
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
NEGOTIATIONS.

477
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I THINK NEGOTIATIONS ARE
PREMATURE.

478
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
YOU WON'T TALK TO THE

479
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
NORTH KOREANS UNTIL THEY KNOW

480
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THEY'RE DEFEATED.

481
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM THAT.

482
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
JULIE: IT'S INTERESTING YOU

483
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
MENTION SOUTH KOREA WITH THE

484
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
FIRST LIBERAL PRESIDENT TO BE

485
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
ELECTED RECENTLY AND THAT

486
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
PRESIDENT WANTING TO TALK TO

487
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
NORTH KOREA, WE HAVEN'T SEEN
THAT.

488
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
SO YOU HAVE THESE THREE

489
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
NATIONS, POTENTIALLY, IN FOR

490
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
TALKS.

491
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
OF COURSE, THAT WILL TAKE A

492
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
LOT OF TIME AND NOT HAVING TO

493
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
SEE THESE SORT OF BLATANT

494
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
DISRESPECT SLAP IN THE FACE TO

495
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THE WEST EACH TIME TEST FIRES

496
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
A MISSILE.

497
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000

NEXT TIME.

500
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
NOT TO A LAUNCH BUT TO OUR

501
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
INTERVIEW.
>> THANK YOU.

502
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
JULIE: THANK YOU.

Dear Predictable,

There's no other
way to say this.

517
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's over.

518
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I've found a permanent
escape from monotony.

519
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Together, we are
perfectly balanced,

520
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
our senses awake,

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
our hearts racing as one.

522
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I know this is sudden,

523
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
but they say: If you
love something...

524
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
set it free.

547
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And we came up with a plan

548
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to help reduce

549
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000

the National Eye

555
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000

THE U.S. HAS STEPPED UP RECON

HIT.

594
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000

TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

614
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
THIS ATTACK BECAUSE IT WAS

615
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
VERY FAR REACHING.

616
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
>> I MEAN, THIS IS AN

617
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK, JULIE,

618
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER
SEEN.

619
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
IT IS THE LARGEST ATTACK OF

620
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
THIS TYPE AND HACKERS USED

621
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
MESSAGES THAT WERE FIRST

622
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
DEPLOYED BY THE NATIONAL

623
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
SECURITY AGENCY IN SECRET BUT

624
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
OF COURSE THESE MESSAGES WERE

625
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
LEAKED ON THE INTERNET WHICH

626
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
ALLOWED HACKERS TO THEN USE

627
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
IT.

628
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
AND AMONG THE TOOLS USED WAS A

629
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
MICROSOFT WINDOWS FLAW THE NSA

630
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
KNEW ABOUT.

631
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
HACKERS EXPLOITED THIS FLAW TO

632
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
INFECT COMPUTERS WITH
RANSOMWARE.

633
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
IT GETS INTO SPAM E-MAIL OR

634
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000

DATA HOSTAGE UNTIL USER HAS TO
PAY RANSOM.

637
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
THIS IS A SCREENSHOT OF WHAT

638
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
THE VIRUS DUBBED WANT TO CRY.

639
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
IN THIS CASE USERS HAD TO PAY

640
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
UP TO $600 TO GET ACCESS

641
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
AGAIN.

642
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THE SIDE AND SPEED HITTING

644
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000

MEDICAL CENTERS.

650
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
MANY WERE FORCED TO CANCEL OR

651
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000

652
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000

654
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.

655
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
BUT AS FOR, SAY, IT'S NOT

656
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
LIKELY TO BE A GOVERNMENT.

657
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE

658
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
TO OFTEN GROUND OURSELVES IN

659
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000

THE REALITY IS 80% OF WHAT

PROTECT THEMSELVES?

677

678
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000

and a high risk for fracture...
I can tell you

723
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Prolia® is proven to help
protect bones from fracture.

724
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But the real proof?

725
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
My doctor said Prolia® helped my
bones get stronger.

726
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Are your bones getting stronger?

727
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Do not take Prolia® if you have
low blood calcium, are pregnant,

728
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
are allergic to it, or take
XGEVA®.

729
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Serious allergic reactions, like
low blood pressure;

730
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
trouble breathing; throat
tightness; face, lip,

731
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
or tongue swelling; rash;
itching or hives have happened.

732
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Tell your doctor about dental
problems,

733
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
as severe jaw bone problems may
happen,

734
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
or new or unusual pain in your
hip, groin or thigh,

735
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
as unusual thigh bone fractures
have occurred.

736
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Speak to your doctor before
stopping Prolia®,

737
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
as spine and other bone
fractures have occurred.

738
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Prolia® can cause serious side
effects, like low blood calcium;

739
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
serious infections, which could
need hospitalization skin
problems;

740
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and severe bone, joint or muscle
pain.

741
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Only Prolia® helps strengthen
and protect bones

742
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
with 2 shots a year.

743

80 percent of recurrent
ischemic strokes

848

could be prevented
with the right steps.

849
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And take it from me,
every step counts.

850
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
A Bayer aspirin regimen
is one of those steps

851

in helping prevent
another stroke.

852

to your doctor

Needles.

930
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Fine for some.

931
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
But for you, one pill a day may
provide symptom relief.

932
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Ask your doctor about XELJANZ
XR. An "Unjection™".

LISTEN.

990
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
>> YOUR AGENDA IS NOT GETTING

991
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000

992
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
UP ON THE COMEY ISSUE AND
RIDICULOUS --

993
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
TRUMP: I AGREE.
I AGREE.

994
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
>> HOW DO YOU GET RID OF

995
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
COMEY --

996
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
TRUMP: I THINK.
>> WHO IN THE PRESS OFFICE

997
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SAYS ONE THING, THE VICE

998
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
PRESIDENT SAYS ANOTHER THING.

999
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
HOW DO WE RESOLVE THAT?
TRUMP: WELL, THAT'S AN

1000
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
INTERESTING SITUATION.

1001
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I ACTUALLY SAID TODAY, LET'S

1002
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
NOT DO ANY MORE PRESS

1003
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
BRIEFINGS.  YOU KNOW, THEY'RE

1004
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
GETTING TREMENDOUS RATINGS AND

1005
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
ESPECIALLY THE FAKE MEDIA.

1006
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
THEY'RE GOING CRAZY.
THEY ARE GOING CRAZY.

1007
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
AND THEY'LL BE IN THE ROOM,

1008
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
AND YOU HAVE TO SEE THE WAY

1009
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THEY ASK QUESTIONS, I WANT.

1010
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I WANT.

1011
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
SCREAMING AND THERE'S NEVER

1012
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

1013
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SEAN AND

1014
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SARAH HUCKABEE AND ANYBODY WHO

1015
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
STOOD UP THERE.

1016
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
THEY DON'T KNOW ME.

1017
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'M A VERY ACTIVE PRESIDENT.

1018
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'M DEALING WITH CHINA.  I'M

1019
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
DEALING WITH JAPAN.

1020
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'M DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA.

1021
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I'M DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE

1022
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
DIFFERENT THINGS.

1023
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
RUSSIA CAME TO SEE ME, THE
FOREIGN MINISTER THE OTHER DAY

1024
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
AND RIGHT AFTER THAT, THEY

1025
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
DIDN'T SAY THIS BUT RIGHT

1026
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
AFTER THAT, THE FOREIGN

1027
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
MINISTER FROM UKRAINE CAME

1028
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
IN.

1029
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I SAID FELLAS, YOU'VE GOT TO

1030
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
MAKE PEACE.

1031
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
YOU'VE GOT TO GET PEACE.

1032
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
THEY ONLY TALKED ABOUT RUSSIA

1033
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
COMING IN.  OKAY?  AND WE TOOK

1034
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
PICTURES, THEY TOOK PICTURES.

1035
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
WE RELEASED THE PICTURES.

1036
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
THEY MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT
IT.

1037
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS COMING,

1038
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
AND HE WAS SCHEDULED TO COME.

1039
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
BUT THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

1040
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
UKRAINE.

1041
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
THE POINT IS THIS:  WHEN WE

1042
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
HAVE THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES,

1043
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I ACTUALLY SAY WE SHOULDN'T

1044
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
HAVE THEM BECAUSE SARAH

1045
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
HUCKABEE.
>> 100 YEARS WE'VE BEEN

1046
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
DOING.
TRUMP: NO.  NO.

1047
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ACTION

1048
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
LIKE THIS.

1049
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THIS IS CRAZY.

1050
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING HIGHER

1051
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
RATINGS -- THEY'RE GETTING

1052
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
HIRE RATINGS ON THOSE PRESS
CONFERENCES --

1053
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
>> WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY

1054
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
CONSIDER STOPPING THESE PRESS

1055
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SESSIONS?

1056
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
TRUMP: NO, WE DO IT IN A

1057
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
DIFFERENT WAY.

1058
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
>> HOW?

1059
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
TRUMP: WE DO IT THROUGH A

1060
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
PIECE OF PAPER WITH A

1061
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
PERFECTLY, ACCURATE, BEAUTIFUL

1062
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
ANSWER.

1063
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.

1064
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
>> IN WRITING?

1065
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
TRUMP: THEY ASK 100 QUESTIONS

1066
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
OR 50 QUESTIONS OR 20

1067
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
QUESTIONS.

1068
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
IF THEY GET ONE OUT OF 50,

1069
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF, 5%,

1070
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
10%, 20%, IT'S THE NEXT DAY

1071
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
IT'S A FRONT-PAGE STORY IN

1072
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
EVERY NEWSPAPER.

1073
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
>> RIGHT.
SO?

1074
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
TRUMP: PRESS CONFERENCES

1075
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
WEREN'T EVEN COVERED FOR

1076
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
OBAMA, PRACTICAL.

1077
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
THEY WERE ON C-SPAN AND

1078
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
C-SPAN2 AND, YOU KNOW, THERE

1079
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
WAS NOTHING GOING ON.

1080
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
>> BUT WILL YOU PUT AN END TO

1081
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
THEM?
TRUMP: THESE PRESS CONFERENCES

1082
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
ARE, LIKE, THE BIGGEST THING

1083
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
ON DAYTIME TELEVISION.
>> THEY ARE.

1084
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
TRUMP: OKAY?  YOU SEE THE

1085
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
RATINGS.

1086
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
THEY'RE BLOWING AWAY

1087
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
EVERYTHING ON JUST ABOUT I

1088
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
THINK EVERYTHING ON DAYTIME

1089
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
TELEVISION.

1090
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
WHAT I LOVE TO DO IS STOP

1091
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
THEM.

1092
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE PEOPLE.

1093
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'LL GIVE YOU -- LOOK, I AM A

1094
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
VERY ACTIVE PERSON.

1095
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I HAVE A LOT OF VERY POSITIVE

1096
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
THINGS GOING ON RIGHT UP HERE

1097
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
FOR THIS COUNTRY.

1098
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON

1099
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
OR TWO PEOPLE OR THREE PEOPLE

1100
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
WHO ARE PRESS PEOPLE TO COVER

1101
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
EVERY ASPECT OF WHAT I'M

1102
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
THINKING AND WHAT I'M DOING.

1103
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
AND I THINK IT'S UNFAIR.

1104
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
AND IF THEY GET JUST A LITTLE

1105
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
BIT WRONG, THEY DON'T MEAN TO,

1106
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THEY'RE LIARS.

1107
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
THEY'RE HORRIBLE PEOPLE.

1108
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THEY'RE LIARS, THE PRESS

1109
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
GOES.

1110
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
AND IT BECOMES A BIG STORY FOR

1111
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
TWO OR THREE DAYS.

1112
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
AND IT'S VERY, VERY UNFAIR TO

1113
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
A PERSON IN THAT JOB.

1114
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I THINK THAT'S REALLY A TOUGH

1115
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
JOB, TO BE HONEST.

1116
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
ESPECIALLY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M

1117
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
HAVING MEETING AFTER MEETING.

1118
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'M CUTTING THE PRICE OF THE

1119
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
AIRPLANES WITH LOCKHEED.

1120
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'M CUTTING THE PRICE OF

1121
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
AIRPLANES WITH BOEING.

1122
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'M DOING ALL OF THESE

1123
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
THINGS.

1124
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'M MAKING DEALS WITH CHINA.

1125
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'M TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM

1126
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
IN NORTH KOREA, WHICH IS A

1127
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
REALLY BIG PROBLEM.

1128
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
>> ARE YOU MOVING SO QUICKLY

1129
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS

1130
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
DEPARTMENT CANNOT KEEP UP WITH
YOU?

1131
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TRUMP: YES.
THAT'S TRUE.

1132
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
>> SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT

1133
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
THAT?

1134
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
TRUMP: WE DON'T HAVE PRESS

1135
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
CONFERENCES, AND WE DO.

1136
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
>> YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

1137
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
TRUMP: WELL, JUST DON'T HAVE

1138
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
THEM UNLESS I HAVE THEM EVERY

1139
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
TWO WEEKS, AND I DO THEM
MYSELF.

1140
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
WE DON'T HAVE THEM.

1141
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

1142
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE A LEVEL

1143
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
OF HOSTILITY THAT'S

1144
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
INCREDIBLE, AND IT'S VERY

1145
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
UNFAIR.

1146
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
SARAH HUCKABEE IS A LOVELY

1147
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
YOUNG WOMAN.

1148
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
YOU KNOW SEAN SPICER.

1149
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
HE IS A LOVELY HUMAN BEING.

1150
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
HE'S A NICE MAN.

1151
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
>> IS HE YOUR PRESS SECRETARY

1152
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
TODAY AND TOMORROW?

1153
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
TRUMP: YEAH, HE IS.

1154
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
>> WILL HE BE HERE TOMORROW?

1155
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
TRUMP: WELL, HE'S DOING A GOOD

1156
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
JOB, BUT HE'S GETTING BEAT

1157
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
UP.

1158
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
>> WILL HE BE THERE TOMORROW?

1159
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
TRUMP: HE'S BEEN THERE FROM

1160
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THE BEGINNING.

1161
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
>> IS HE --

1162
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
TRUMP: HE JUST GETS BEAT UP BY

1163
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
THESE PEOPLE.

1164
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
JULIE: REMEMBER TO WATCH JUDGE

1165
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
JENIN'S INTERVIEW WITH

1166
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT HERE ON

1167
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
FOX NEWS CHANNEL TONIGHT AT

1168
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
9:00 P.M. EASTERN.

1169
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I HAVE A FEELING IT WILL BE A

1170
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN MOST

1171
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
INTERVIEWS YOU'VE SEEN HIM

1172
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
DO.
PRETTY ENTERTAINING.

1173
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
THAT WAS GOOD STUFF.

1174
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THANK YOU.  WELL, PRESIDENT

1175
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
TRUMP GIVING HIS FIRST

1176
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AS

1177
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
PRESIDENT IN FRONT OF A RECORD

1178
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
CROWD.

1179
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
IN FRONT OF ABOUT 50,000

1180
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
PEOPLE TELLING GRADUATES NEVER

1181
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
GIVE UP TO THEIR DREAMS AND TO

1182
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO.

1183
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
KEVIN HAS MORE FROM LYNCHBURG,

1184
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
VIRGINIA.

1185
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
>> JULIE, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU

1186
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
HERE IN THE PICTURESQUE

1187
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
PENNSYLVANIA.

1188
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
THE PRESIDENT'S VERY FIRST

1189
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AS

1190
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

1191
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
IT'S ACTUALLY, BY THE WAY, HIS

1192
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
THIRD VISIT HERE TO THIS

1193
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
CAMPUS.

1194
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
YOU MAY RECALL HE WAS HERE NOT

1195
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
THAT MANY MONTHS AGO AS A

1196
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
CANDIDATE FOR THE HIGHEST

1197
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
OFFICE IN THE LAND.

1198
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
AND TODAY, HE DREW FROM THAT

1199
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO

1200
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
ENCOURAGE THE STUDENTS TO BE

1201
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THEMSELVES, TO BE BOLD.

1202
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS

1203
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
AND THE NAYSAYERS, ESPECIALLY

1204
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
NOW AS THEY LOOK FORWARD TO

1205
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WRITING THEIR OWN NARRATIVE AS

1206
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
YOUNG ADULTS.

1207
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
>> NOTHING IS EASIER OR MORE

1208
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PATHETIC THAN BEING A CRITIC.

1209
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

1210
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE.

1211
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
BUT THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THE

1212
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
DREAMERS.

1213
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
NOT TO THE CRITICS.

1214
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
>> WE MENTION THE OVERWHELMING

1215
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED

1216
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
HERE AMONG THE CROWD.

1217
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
ABOUT 50,000 PEOPLE IN ALL IN

1218
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
THE STADIUM AND AROUND IT

1219
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
TAKING IN THE PRESIDENT'S

1220
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON.

1221
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
HE ALSO TOLD THE STUDENTS

1222
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
HERE, AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS

1223
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
AN IMPORTANT NOTE.

1224
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE THE

1225
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
OUTSIDER BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL

1226
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
ALWAYS TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN'T
DO.

1227
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
BUT DON'T LET THAT SLOW YOU

1228
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
DOWN.

1229
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
>> CARRY YOURSELF WITH DIGNITY

1230
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
AND PRIDE.

1231
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
DEMAND THE BEST FROM YOURSELF

1232
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
AND BE TOTALLY UNAFRAID TO

1233
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
CHALLENGE ENTRENCHED INTEREST

1234
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
IN FAILED POWER STRUCTURES.

1235
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR, BY

1236
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THE WAY?

1237
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
THE MORE PEOPLE TELL YOU IT'S

1238
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
NOT POSSIBLE, THAT IT CAN'T BE

1239
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
DONE, THE MORE YOU SHOULD BE

1240
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO PROVE

1241
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
THEM WRONG.

1242
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
>> AMONG THE SHOUTOUTS, THE

1243
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
PRESIDENT OFFERED TODAY, HE

1244
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THANKED VETERANS FOR THEIR

1245
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
SUPPORT.

1246
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
AND, BY THE WAY, THERE WERE

1247
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THOUSANDS OF THEM GRADUATING

1248
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
TODAY HERE AS WELL.

1249
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
HE ALSO SAID, HEY, DON'T

1250
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FORGET.
IT'S SUNDAY COMING UP.

1251
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
THAT'S MOTHER'S DAY.

1252
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THANK YOU TO THE MOMS FOR

1253
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
BEING SO SUPPORTIVE AND

1254
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
GETTING THOSE STUDENTS TO THIS

1255
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
POINT.

1256
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
BUT IN PARTICULAR, THERE WAS A

1257
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONS TO

1258
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
JIM KELLY.

1259
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
YOU MAY REMEMBER HE WAS A

1260
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
QUARTERBACK OF THE BUFFALO
BILLS.

1261
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
OH, THOSE MANY YEARS AGO

1262
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
MAKING IT TO SUPER BOWL AFTER

1263
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
SUPER BOWL.

1264
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
HE'S BEATEN CANCER TWICE.

1265
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
HIS DAUGHTER AMONG THE

1266
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
GRADUATING CLASS OF 2017.

1267
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A DAY SHE WON'T SOON FORGET,

1268
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
AND I THINK THAT WILL

1269
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
CERTAINLY BE THE CASE FOR THE

1270
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
MANY THOUSANDS WHO WERE HERE

1271
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
IN ATTENDANCE.

1272
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
JULIE.

1273
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
JULIE: KEVIN, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.  WELL, FEDERAL

1274
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
PROSECUTORS ARE NOW UNDER

1275
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
ORDERS TO GO AFTER THE MOST

1276
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
SERIOUS CHARGES POSSIBLE FOR

1277
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
MOST ACCUSED CRIMINALS.

1278
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
NOW, THE MOVE REVERSES SOME

1279
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
POLICIES FROM THE OBAMA

1280
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WERE

1281
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
MEANT TO FIGHT PRISON

1282
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
OVERCROWDING.

1283
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
EXPERTS SAY IT WILL LIKELY PUT

1284
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
MORE PEOPLE BEHIND BARS FOR
LONGER.

1285
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS

1286
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
PROMISED TO MAKE CRACKING DOWN

1287
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
ON DRUGS AND VIOLENCE A TOP

1288
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
PRIORITY AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.

1289
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
HE SAYS THE NEW POLICY WILL

1290
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
PRODUCE MORE QUOTE CONSISTENCY

1291
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
IN SENTENCING.

1292
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
BUT CRITICS SAY LOWER LEVEL

1293
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
CRIMINALS WILL INSTEAD NOW

1294
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
FACE UNFAIR MANDATORY MINIMUM

1295
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
SENTENCES.

1296
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
PETER DUCEY HAS MORE.

1297
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> YOU DRUG DEALERS ARE GOING
TO PRISON.

1298
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> AND WITH THAT, A TRUMP

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
ORDER BECAME AN INSTRUCTION

1301
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
FOR AMERICA'S LAW
ENFORCEMENT.

1302
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
A TWO-PAGE MEMO FROM THE

1303
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO U.S.

1304
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
ATTORNEYS WARNS CRIMINALS.

1305
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
PROSECUTORS WILL NOW ALMOST

1306
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
ALWAYS PURSUE CHARGES WITH THE

1307
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
LONGEST POSSIBLE SENTENCES.

1308
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
AND IT'S MANDATORY MINIMUM

1309
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
SENTENCES WILL EVEN APPLY TO

1310
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
DRUG OFFENSES WITH WHICH THE

1311
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
LAST ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO

1312
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
BE LEANT AND CONSIDERED
NONVIOLENT.

1313
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
>> WE'RE RETURNING TO THE

1314
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW AS

1315
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
PASSED BY CONGRESS, PLANE AND

1316
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
SIMPLE.

1317
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
IF YOU ARE A DRUG TRAFFICKER,

1318
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
WE WILL NOT LOOK THE OTHER

1319
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
WAY.

1320
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
>> THAT'S A MAJOR CHANGE FROM

1321
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
A OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

1322
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
APPROACH DESIGNED TO REDUCE

1323
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
PRISON POPULATIONS.

1324
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
>> A PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS

1325
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
MASS INCARCERATION PHENOMENON

1326
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
IS -- OUR DRUG LAWS ARE

1327
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING
AROUND DRUG LAWS.

1328
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
>> ONE OF OBAMA'S ATTORNEY

1329
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
GENERALS ERIC HOLDER NOW SAYS

1330
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
QUOTE THE POLICY ANNOUNCED

1331
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
TODAY IS NOT TOUGH ON CRIME,

1332
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
IT IS DUMB ON CRIME.

1333
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
BUT THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE SAYS

1334
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
THE CHANGE WAS CAREFULLY
CRAFTED.

1335
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
>> THIS POLICY WAS FORMULATED
AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION

1336
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
WITH THE PROSECUTORS THAT

1337
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
HANDLE THESE CASES EACH AND

1338
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
EVERY DAY AROUND THE COUNTRY.

1339
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
>> PRISON REFORM ADVOCATES ARE

1340
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF A

1341
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
RETURN TO THE WAR ON DRUGS.

1342
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
>> THE PROBLEM WITH THE WAR ON

1343
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
DRUGS WAS THAT IT SWEPT UP NOT

1344
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
JUST PEOPLE ENGAGED IN HIGH

1345
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
LEVEL DRUG OFFENDING BUT LOTS

1346
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
OF PEOPLE IN THE LOWER LEVELS

1347
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
OF THE DRUG TRADE.

1348
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
THAT HAD VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON

1349
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
DRUG USE AND ABUSE.

1350
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
>> ON CAPITOL HILL, DEMOCRATS

1351
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
AND AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN

1352
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ARE SCOFFING AT THIS NEW

1353
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
POLICY TOO.

1354
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
SENATOR RAND PAUL SAYS QUOTE

1355
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES

1356
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
HAVE UNFAIRLY AND

1357
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
DISPROPORTIONALLY INCARCERATED

1358
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
TOO MANY MINORITIES FOR TOO

1359
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
LONG.

1360
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
A FORMER FEDERAL DRUG SEES

1361
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THINGS DIFFERENTLY.
>> WHEN THEY SAY A HOLDER IN

1362
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
THE CROWD AND PRESIDENT OBAMA

1363
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
SAY GO EASY ON THIS STUFF,
THEY WANT YOU TO THINK WHAT

1364
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOME

1365
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
GUY SITTING IN HIS ROOM TOKING

1366
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
UP ON A JOINT.

1367
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF CASES

1368
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1369
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
THEY DIDN'T PROSECUTE MAJOR

1370
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
DRUG DEALING CASES.

1371
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
AND THIS HAS CREATED MORE OF A
PROBLEM.

1372
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
>> I WAS WITH THE ATTORNEY

1373
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
GENERAL IN WEST VIRGINIA

1374
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
YESTERDAY WHEN HE ANNOUNCED A

1375
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO

1376
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
ROUNDING UP DRUG DEALERS.

1377
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
AND NOW HE'S SAYING WHAT HE

1378
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
WANTS TO DO ONCE THEY ARE IN

1379
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
CUSTODY.

1380
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
SESSIONS IS NOT PROPOSING ANY

1381
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
NEW LAWS, JUST SAYING THAT

1382
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
THIS DEPARTMENT WILL NO LONGER

1383
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH ONES TO

1384
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
ENFORCE.

JULIE: PETER DUCEY, THANK YOU

1386
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
VERY MUCH.

COMING UP RIGHT AFTER THIS

1394
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
BREAK.
STAY WITH US
Thank you!

1395
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Imagine if the things you
bought every day

1396
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
earned you miles to
get to the places

1397
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
you really want to go.

1398
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
With the United MileagePlus
Explorer Card,

1399
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
you'll get a free checked bag,

and 50,000 bonus miles.

Everything you need

1406
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Imagine where it will take you.

1407
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But with my back pain I couldn't
sleep or get up in time.

1408
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Then I found Aleve PM.

1409
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
The only one to combine
a safe sleep aid

1410
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
plus the 12 hour pain
relieving strength of Aleve.

1411
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And now. I'm back!

1412
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Aleve PM for a better AM.

Businesses count on
communication, and communication
counts on CenturyLink.

1415
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
gave us the power to turn this

1416
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
enemy into an ally?

1417
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Microsoft and its partners are

1418
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
using smart traps to capture

1419
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
mosquitoes and sequence their

1420
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
DNA to fight disease.

1421
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
There are over 100 million

1422
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
pieces of DNA in every sample.

1423
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
With the Microsoft Cloud,

1424
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
we can analyze the data

1425
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
faster than ever before.

1426
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
If we can detect new viruses

1427
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
before they spread,

1428
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
we may someday prevent outbreaks

1429
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
before they begin.

1437
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
LAUNCHED FROM THE WESTERN PART

1438
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
OF THE NATION AND LANDING IN

1439
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
THE SEA OF JAPAN.

1440
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000

THE CENTER OF COMMAND SAYS IT

1446
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH

1447
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN TO
MAINTAIN SECURITY.

1448
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
NOW, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES

1449
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
SAY THE LAUNCH POSED NO THREAT

1450
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000

ON THE TABLE, WE ARE WAITING

1459
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO RELEASE

1460
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
A STATEMENT.

1461
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE

THE SITUATION.

THE POCKET HAS ALSO CONFIRMED
ALL OF THIS.

WHAT IT MEANS NEXT.

WE SOON FIND OUT MORE AS WE
GET IT.

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
REALLY WANTED TO START THIS

1483
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
DURING THE DOWN HOURS

1484
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000

WHY SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

1546
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
THAT AS MORE CABLE SUBSCRIBERS

Dear Predictable,

1548
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
There's no other
way to say this.

1549
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It's over.

1550
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I've found a permanent
escape from monotony.

1551
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Together, we are
perfectly balanced,

1552

I know this is sudden,

but they say: If you
love something...

1556
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
set it free.

1557
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000

For fast-acting, long-lasting
relief,

try doctor recommended Gaviscon.

acid

Yeah, our insurance
