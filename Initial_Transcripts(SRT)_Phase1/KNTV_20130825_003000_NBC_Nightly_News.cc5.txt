[000:03:43;056] THESE FORESTS AT ABOUT 2,000
[000:03:45;325] DEGREES, INCINERATING ALL THE

[000:05:25;024] THAT PERHAPS CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:05:25;725] WERE ACTUALLY USED.
[000:05:28;461] THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED
[000:05:29;195] ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND DENIED
[000:05:31;597] THAT IT USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS,
[000:05:32;432] MORE IMPORTANTLY TODAY ON SYRIAN
[000:05:33;566] STATE TELEVISION THEY SHOWED
[000:05:35;835] IMAGES OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT
[000:05:37;837] WERE ALLEGEDLY FOUND IN AREAS

[000:05:58;024] DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
[000:06:00;593] AS THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES
[000:06:01;994] WEIGH A POSSIBLE MILITARY OPTION
[000:06:03;429] AGAINST SYRIA, A SENIOR IRANIAN
[000:06:05;164] LAWMAKER TODAY WARNED THAT ANY
[000:06:06;265] MILITARY INTERVENTION INSIDE

[000:06:27;353] >> WHAT'S CLEAR, LESTER, THERE
[000:06:28;755] IS A NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE
[000:06:31;591] WHITE HOUSE AFTER THIS ATTACK.
[000:06:32;291] THE HUMAN COSTS IN SYRIA HAVE
[000:06:33;326] BECOME JUST TOO HIGH TO BEAR.
[000:06:35;294] DESPITE THAT, THERE IS

[000:06:37;563] AMONG THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS
[000:06:38;297] ABOUT WHAT SHOULD COME NEXT.
[000:06:40;433] AMONG THE QUESTIONS, WHAT IS THE
[000:06:41;834] LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR MILITARY
[000:06:43;536] ACTION AND WHAT WOULD AN ATTACK
[000:06:44;270] ACCOMPLISH?
[000:06:48;941] THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS
[000:06:51;778] TRYING TO VERIFY FACTS ON THE
[000:06:52;478] GROUND AND AT THIS POINT THE
[000:06:54;080] WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING LITTLE,
[000:06:55;214] ONLY STRESSING THAT WHILE THE
[000:06:57;483] U.S. HAS A RANGE OF OPTIONS
[000:06:58;151] AVAILABLE, THE PRESIDENT WILL
[000:07:00;052] MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN A
[000:07:00;787] DELIBERATE WAY RATHER THAN
[000:07:03;189] PURSUE QUICK ACTION BEFORE ALL
[000:07:03;923] THE FACTS ARE KNOWN.

[000:07:20;973] TO DISCUSS ANY SPECIFIC FORCED
[000:07:23;075] MOVEMENTS, BUT HE LEFT LITTLE
[000:07:25;378] DOUBT HE THINKS CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:07:26;779] WERE INVOLVED SAYING, "IT
[000:07:27;413] APPEARS TO BE WHAT HAPPENED, USE
[000:07:30;483] OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS."
