00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
AND ALSO, THE DISCOVERY AT HIS

538
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
HOME HERE IN NEVADA.

539
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
LEARNING ABOUT THAT LATE TODAY.

540
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
>>> AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

541
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
FIRST LADY WITH A MOMENT OF
SILENCE OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.

542
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
AFTER THE PRESIDENT CALLED THIS

543
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
AN ACT OF PURE EVIL.

544
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
OUR TEAM COVERAGE CONTINUES HERE
IN JUST A MOMENT.
When you have a cold...

545
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
stuff happens.

546
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Shut down cold symptoms fast

547
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
with Maximum
Strength Alka Seltzer

548
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Plus Liquid Gels.
Only have a sore throat?

549
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Get long-lasting
relief for up to 6 hours

550
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
with New Alka Seltzer
Plus Sore Throat Relief.

551
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
how much money do you
think you'll need in retirement?

552
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then we found out how many years
that money would last them.

553
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
How long do you
think we'll keep --

554
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oooooohhh! You stopped!

555
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're gonna leave me
back here at year 9?

556
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
How did this happen?

557
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It turned out, a lot
of people fell short,

558
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of even the average
length of retirement.

559
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We have to think about
not when we expect to live to,

560
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
but when we could live to.

561
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's plan for income that lasts
all our years in retirement.

562
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Prudential.
Bring your challenges.

563
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Essential for vinyl,

564
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but maybe not for people with
rheumatoid arthritis.

565
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because there are options.

566
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like an "Unjection™".

567
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
XELJANZ XR.

568
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A once daily pill for adults

569
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
with moderate to severe RA

570
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
for whom methotrexate

571
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
did not work well.

572
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
XELJANZ XR can reduce pain,

573
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
swelling and further
joint damage,

574
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
even without methotrexate.

575
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
XELJANZ XR can lower your
ability to fight infections,

576
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
including tuberculosis.

577
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections, lymphoma

578
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and other cancers have happened.

579
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't start XELJANZ XR
if you have an infection.

580
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Tears in the stomach
or intestines,

581
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
low blood cell counts

582
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and higher liver tests

583
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and cholesterol levels
have happened.

584
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Your doctor should perform blood
tests before you start

585
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and while taking XELJANZ XR,

586
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and monitor certain liver tests.

587
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Tell your doctor if you
were in a region

588
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
where fungal infections
are common

589
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and if you have had TB,

590
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
hepatitis B or C,

591
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
or are prone to infections.

592
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Needles.

593
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
A must for vinyl.

594
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But for you,

595
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
one pill a day

596
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
may provide symptom relief.

597
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Ask your doctor
about XELJANZ XR.

598
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
An "Unjection™".

58,007 ste

674
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's the height of
Mount Everest.

675
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Because each day she
chooses to take the stairs.

676
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
At work, at home...

677
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
even on the escalator.

678
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That can be hard on
her lower body,

679
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
so now she does it
with Dr. Scholl's orthotics.

680

Clinically proven to
relieve and prevent

by reducing
the shock and stress

683

that travel up her body
with every step she takes.

684
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So keep on climbing, Sarah.

685
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000

Do I use ...one that'sthat
wgood for my teeth? ..

694

Now I don't have to choose!

of your Part B medical expenses.

The rest is up to you.

703
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So think about an AARP Medicare
Supplement Insurance Plan,

704
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
insured by UnitedHealthcare
Insurance Company.

705
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Like any standardized Medicare
Supplement insurance plans,

706
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
they help cover some of what
Medicare doesn't pay.

707

717
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THE NATION TODAY, PRESIDENT
TRUMP STRIKING A SOMBER TONE.

718
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
>> IT WAS AN ACT OF PURE EVIL.

719
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
>> Reporter: HE NEVER SAID THE

720
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
GUNMAN'S NAME, INSTEAD FOCUSING

721
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
ON THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS.

722
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
>> WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU, AND

723
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
WE ARE HERE FOR YOU, AND WE ASK

724
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
GOD TO HELP SEE YOU THROUGH THIS

725
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
VERY DARK PERIOD.
>> Reporter: AND HE CALLED FOR

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
UNITY.

727
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
>> IT IS OUR LOVE THAT DEFINES

US TODAY, AND ALWAYS WILL,

729
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
FOREVER.

730
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT

731
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
LEADING A MOMENT OF SILENCE,

732
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
ORDERING FLAGS FLOWN AT HALF

733
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
STAFF AND PERSONALLY CALLING THE

734
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
LAS VEGAS SHERIFF.

735
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
>> THE FAST RESPONSE THAT YOU

736
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
GAVE SAVED HUNDREDS OF

737
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE FROM BEING

738
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
KILLED.
>> Reporter: BUT WAS THIS

739
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
TERRORISM?
THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T SAY.

740
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT
WHAT HAPPENED AMOUNTS TO AN ACT

741
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM?

742
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
>> WE ARE STILL IN A
FACT-FINDING MISSION.

743
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO WEIGH

744
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
IN ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE
WE HAVE ANY MORE FACTS.

745
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
>> AND THE PRESIDENT HEADS TO

746
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
LAS VEGAS ON WEDNESDAY, WHERE HE

747
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
WILL THANK FIRST RESPONDERS.

748
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
HE WILL MEET WITH VICTIM'S

749
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
FAMILY MEMBERS, BUT FIRST, THAT

750
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
TRIP TO PUERTO RICO TO SURVEY

751
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THE DAMAGE THERE, DAVID.

752
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
THAT HAPPENS TOMORROW.

753
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
>> CECILIA, THANK YOU.
>>> AND WHAT THE SHERIFF HERE

754
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
REVEALED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO,

755
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
IN A MOMENT.

756
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
ot

757
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
from our eyes every day.

758
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I should know.

759
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I have Chronic Dry Eye

760
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
caused by reduced
tear production

761
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
due to inflammation.

762
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So I use RESTASIS MultiDose®.

763
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It helps me make more
of my own tears,

764
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
with continued use,

765
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
twice a day, every day.

766
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's also what I prescribe
to my patients

767
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
who have this condition.

768
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
RESTASIS MultiDose®

769
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
helps increase your
eyes' natural ability

770
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to produce tears,

771
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
which may be reduced
by inflammation

772
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
due to Chronic Dry Eye.

773
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
RESTASIS MultiDose® did
not increase tear production

774
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
in patients using
anti-inflammatory eye drops

775
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
or tear duct plugs.

776
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
To help avoid eye injury
and contamination,

777
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
do not touch the bottle tip
to your eye or other surfaces.

778
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Wait 15 minutes after use

779
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
before inserting
contact lenses.

780
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The most common side effect

781
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
is a temporary
burning sensation.

782
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Ask your eye doctor about
RESTASIS MultiDose®.

783
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Savings Card

little as $0

Only one name really matters

811
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because shoulders were made for

This is my body of proof.

814
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Proof of less joint pain

815
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and clearer skin.

816
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This is my body of proof that I
can take on psoriatic

817
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
arthritis with HUMIRA.

818
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
HUMIRA works by targeting and
helping to block a specific

819
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
source of inflammation that
contributes to both joint and

820
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
skin symptoms.

821
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It's proven to help relieve
pain, stop further joint damage,

822
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and clear skin in many adults.

823
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
HUMIRA is the #1
prescribed biologic

824
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
for psoriatic arthritis.

825
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability to
fight infections,

826
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
including tuberculosis.

827
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

828
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
including lymphoma, have
happened; as have blood, liver,

829
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
and nervous system problems,
serious allergic reactions,

830
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and new or worsening heart
failure.

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Before treatment, get tested for
TB.

832
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Tell your doctor if you've been
to areas where certain

833
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
fungal infections are common,

834
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and if you've had TB,
hepatitis B,

835
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
are prone to infections, or have
flu-like symptoms or sores.

836
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Don't start HUMIRA if you have
an infection.

837
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Want more proof? Ask your
rheumatologist about HUMIRA.
