[000:23:44;790] THE 11-OUNCE CANS MAY CONTAIN
[000:23:46;091] BOTULISM, A POTENTIALLY FATAL
[000:23:47;659] FOOD POISONING.
[000:23:49;361] MAKERS OF THE COFFEE, WHICH HAS
[000:23:53;865] ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE TIMES THE
[000:23:54;900] CAFFEINE OF A REGULAR CUP, SAY
[000:23:55;534] THROW IT AWAY OR RETURN IT FOR A
[000:23:56;168] REFUND.
[000:23:56;802] THEY SAY THEY ARE HALTING
[000:23:57;335] PRODUCTION UNTIL THEY ADJUST
[000:23:57;936] THEIR MANUFACTURING PROCESS.
[000:24:00;105] >>> AND UP NEXT, WHEN WE COME
[000:24:00;705] BACK, THE INVICTUS GAMES CLOSE
[000:24:01;339] UP.
[000:24:02;674] ONE COMPETITOR WHO REFUSED TO
[000:24:03;275] GIVE UP.
[000:24:04;810] THE AMAZING COMEBACK.
[000:24:05;377] STAY WITH US.
[000:24:08;814] d constipation,
[000:24:08;814] and you're overwhelmed
[000:24:09;948] by everything you've tried--
[000:24:11;516] all those laxatives,
[000:24:11;516] daily probiotics,
[000:24:14;586] endless fiber--
[000:24:14;586] it could be wearing on you.
[000:24:17;589] Tell your doctor
[000:24:17;589] what you've tried,
[000:24:19;090] and how long you've been at it.
[000:24:20;392] LINZESS works differently
[000:24:20;392] from laxatives.
[000:24:22;894] LINZESS treats adults
[000:24:22;894] with IBS
[000:24:24;729] with Constipation
[000:24:24;729] or Chronic Constipation.
[000:24:29;167] It can help relieve
[000:24:29;167] your belly pain
[000:24:31;837] and lets you have more frequent
[000:24:31;837] and complete bowel movements
[000:24:37;776] that are easier to pass.e NZESS
[000:24:37;776] to children less than six
[000:24:40;111] and it should not be given
[000:24:40;111] to children
[000:24:41;446] six to less than eighteen.
[000:24:41;446] It may harm them.
[000:24:43;682] Don't take LINZESS
[000:24:43;682] if you have a bowel blockage.
[000:24:46;351] Get immediate help
[000:24:46;351] if you develop
[000:24:47;919] unusual or severe
[000:24:47;919] stomach pain,
[000:24:49;855] especially with
[000:24:49;855] bloody or black stools.
[000:24:51;890] The most common side effect
[000:24:51;890] is diarrhea, sometimes severe.
[000:24:55;060] If it's severe,
[000:24:55;060] stop taking LINZESS
[000:24:57;229] and call your doctor
[000:24:57;229] right away.
[000:24:58;897] Other side effects
[000:24:58;897] include gas,
[000:25:00;398] stomach-area pain
[000:25:00;398] and swelling.
[000:25:02;067] Talk to your doctor about
[000:25:03;568] managing your symptoms
[000:25:04;736] proactively with LINZESS.

[000:25:39;504] with moderate to severe
[000:25:39;504] rheumatoid arthritis?
[000:25:39;504] How do you chase what you love
[000:25:42;440] Do what I did.
[000:25:43;375] Ask your doctor about HUMIRA.
[000:25:46;778] It's proven to help relieve pain
[000:25:46;778] and protect joints
[000:25:49;247] from further irreversible damage
[000:25:49;247] in many adults.
[000:25:52;450] HUMIRA works by targeting
[000:25:52;450] and helping to block
[000:25:55;086] a specific source
[000:25:55;086] of inflammation
[000:25:57;088] that contributes to RA symptoms.
[000:25:59;090] HUMIRA has been clinically
[000:25:59;090] studied for over 20 years.
[000:26:02;827] HUMIRA can lower your ability
[000:26:02;827] to fight infections,
[000:26:04;963] including tuberculosis.
[000:26:06;765] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:26:06;765] infections and cancers,
[000:26:09;034] including lymphoma, have
[000:26:09;034] happened; as have blood, liver,
[000:26:11;770] d nervousyst proems,   rioualle,
[000:26:14;406] and new or worsening
[000:26:14;406] heart failure.
[000:26:17;592] Before treatment,
[000:26:17;592] get tested for TB.
[000:26:18;944] Tell your doctor
[000:26:18;944] if you've been to areas
[000:26:20;278] where certain fungal infections
[000:26:20;278] are common,
[000:26:22;414] and if you've had TB,
[000:26:22;414] hepatitis B,
[000:26:24;883] are prone to infections, or have
[000:26:24;883] flu-like symptoms or sores.
[000:26:28;320] Don't start HUMIRA if
[000:26:28;320] you have an infection.
[000:26:30;422] Ready for a new chapter?
[000:26:31;957] Talk to your rheumatologist
[000:26:31;957] about HUMIRA.
[000:26:34;326] This is HUMIRA at work.
[000:26:40;131] when you switch to Progressive.
[000:26:42;367] Winds stirring.
[000:26:43;702] Too treacherous for a selfie.
[000:26:43;702] [ Camera shutter clicks ]
[000:26:46;538] Sure, I've taken discounts
[000:26:46;538] to new heights
[000:26:48;840] with safe driver
[000:26:48;840] and paperless billing.
[000:26:50;875] But the prize at the top
[000:26:50;875] is worth every last breath.
[000:26:55;513] Here we go.
[000:26:55;513] [ Grunts ]
[000:26:57;949] Got 'em.
[000:26:59;150] Ahh.

[000:29:47;185] THANKS FOR JOINING US.

[000:29:51;055] OUT WITH LITTLE TO NO
[000:29:53;324] RESISTANCE.
[000:29:53;625] BUT AS TIFFANY WILSON TELLS US,

[000:29:58;096] SHE JOINS US LIVE FROM BERKELEY.
[000:30:00;131] >> Reporter: WE SAW INTERESTING
[000:30:02;567] INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN WHAT WE

[000:30:05;303] STATEMENT THAT MILO
[000:30:07;672] YIANNOPOULOUS RELEASED.
[000:30:08;706] HE SAYS THAT PROTESTERS STORMED
[000:30:10;441] THE BARRICADES AND THAT HE HAD
[000:30:12;343] TO BE RUSHED OUT OF UC

[000:30:21;419] IN FACT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY
[000:30:22;654] DIFFICULT TO DO SO BECAUSE THERE
[000:30:23;454] WERE POLICE OFFICERS EVERY FEW
[000:30:26;257] FEET ALONG THE PERIMETER.

[000:30:39;671] LEFT WHEN HE DID, BUT IT WAS HIS
[000:30:41;773] CHOICE.
[000:30:42;006] HIS UNSANCTIONED AND UNSPONSORED
[000:30:44;509] APPEARANCE ON UC BERKELEY'S
[000:30:46;277] CAMPUS CREATED HOURS OF
[000:30:48;313] DISRUPTION AND DISCORD.
[000:30:49;247] AND IT COST THE UNIVERSITY AT
[000:30:50;815] LEAST $800,000 IN SECURITY.
