1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I DON'T SEE SMOKE AND I DON'T

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
SMELL SMOKE.
>> ONE MORE THING.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
HOW DID THEY COME AT THE HOUSE?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ARE MOST OF THE VEHICLES IN THE

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
DRIVEWAY OR DID THEY COME AT IT

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
THROUGH A BACK WAY?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
>> THIS WHOLE AREA IS FIVE

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
STREETS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
THEY WENT DOWN EVERY SIDE

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
STREET.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
THERE ARE FLASHING LIGHTS AT

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
EVERY END AND OFFICERS WITH

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
RIFLES BY THEIR SIDES AT EVERY

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
SINGLE END.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
>> THERE IS A PARADE OF TRAFFIC

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
HAPPENING NOW.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A BUNCH OF LIGHTS FLASHING GOING

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
UP MY STREET TOWARD FRANKLIN.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
THERE ARE FIVE CARS HEADED UP.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
>> OKAY.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
YEAH.
WE JUST SAW KIND OF A SECOND

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
WAVE OF SUVs, POLICE CARS

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
ARRIVE.
THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
IT'S GETTING TOUGHER BECAUSE THE

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
CAMERA LENS IS OVERWHELMED BY

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THE STROBES.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
IT'S HARD FOR US TO SEE, PICK

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
OUT INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENT EXCEPT

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
THAT VEHICLES KEEP COMING AND

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
GOING.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'M NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR OF

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
MORE OF THEM COMING DOWN WHERE

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
YOU ARE.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I COULD BE CONVINCED THAT WE

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
HAVE SEEN MORE ACTIVITY.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A LIGHT TRUCK JUST ARRIVED IN

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
THE FOREGROUND THERE ON THE

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
RIGHT.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
THOSE ARE ERECTABLE SPOTLIGHTS

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
THEY CAN PUT UP.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
ONCE THE SCENE IS COLD, LET'S

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
SAY THE SUSPECT WAS TAKEN OUT OF

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
THERE.
THEY WOULD STILL WANT TO GET AT

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
TONIGHT, SEE WHAT THEY ARE

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
DEALING WITH.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
EVEN THOUGH, AS KERRY AND I AND

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
PETE WILLIAMS AND I HAVE BEEN

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
THEORIZING IT'S LIKELY, KNOWING

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
HOW THESE GUYS WORK, THEY WILL

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
NOT USE LIGHT FOR THE TAKEDOWN

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
ITSELF.
YOU SEE AN FBI AGENT GETTING OUT

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
OF THE LATEST CAR TO ARRIVE.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
THIS FLASH-BANG TECHNOLOGY, IF

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
THAT EXPLAINS POPS PEOPLE HEARD

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
OTHER THAN GUNFIRE, THEY ARE A

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
BRIEFLY DEVASTATING WEAPON THAT

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
CAN JUST TAKE HOLD OF YOUR

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
SENSES AND LEAVE THE SUSPECT

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
BLINDED AND DEAFENED MOMENTARILY

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
WHILE PEOPLE MOVE IN.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
CLOSED SPACE.
I HAVE SEEN THEM USED OUTDOORS

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
IN A COURTYARD, A WARTIME

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
BACKDROP IN AFGHANISTAN.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
JUST TOLD WE HAVE ANOTHER GUEST.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
CLINT VAN ZANT, FBI VETERAN

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
PROFILER.
WHAT CAN YOU ADD, CLINT?

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
>> WELL, AS YOU KNOW MY

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
BACKGROUND IS AS A HOSTAGE

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
NEGOTIATOR.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
HAVING BEEN IN SIMILAR

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WORKING

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
WITH TACTICAL TEAMS, THIS IS A

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
HAND IN GLOVE OPERATION.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THE NEGOTIATOR IS ON THE SCENE.

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
HE OR SHE WILL BE WORKING HARD

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
TO EXTEND A HAND AND ALLOWS THIS

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
INDIVIDUAL TO COME OUT.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
WITH THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
DEVICE OF SOMETHING INSIDE THE

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
BEST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE FOR

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
THE NEGOTIATOR TO GET THE

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SUBJECT TO COME OVER THE SIDE OF

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE BOAT, CROP TO THE GROUND SO

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THAT THE TACTICAL TEAM.

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THEN THEY CAN CLOSE, MAKE THE

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
ARREST AND THEN ADMINISTER FIRST

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
AID.
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK LIKE

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THAT.
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ENDANGER A

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
POLICE OFFICER OR AGENT IN THE

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
ARREST AND HAVE THIS GUY TRY TO

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
BLOW HIMSELF UP AT THE LAST

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
SECOND.
>> WE HAVE BEEN CIRCUMSPECT

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
REPORTED WRONG OVER THE PAST

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
COUPLE OF DAYS ABOUT PASSING

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THINGS ALONG.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THIS DOES MAKE SENSE THOUGH.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
BOSTON GLOBE IS TWEETING OUT

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THAT ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS IS

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IN CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
HEAR COPS SAY, YOU KNOW, THE

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
CLASSIC MOVIE LINE "COME OUT ON

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
YOUR OWN TERMS, COME OUT WITH

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
YOUR HANDS UP."

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
IT WOULD INDICATE -- THE

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SURPRISE HERE -- IT WOULD

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
INDICATE THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE,

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND ABLE TO

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
MOVE.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
CLINT, AFTER TWO VOLLEYS OF

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
GUNFIRE AND WELL OUTNUMBERED

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
IT'S SURPRISING TO A LOT OF US.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
>> HE WAS PROBABLY WOUNDED LAST

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
NIGHT IN THE EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
IN WHICH HIS BROTHER WAS KILLED.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
HE WAS PROBABLY SHOT AT THAT

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
TIME.
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE BLOOD THAT

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE SCENE

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WHEN HE GOT ON TO THE BOAT OR

124
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
AS WE HEARD THE VOLLEY OF

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
GUNFIRE IT SOUNDED LIKE AT LEAST

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
ONE IF NOT TWO 30-ROUND

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
MAGAZINES FROM THE TACTICAL

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
OFFICER'S WEAPON.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
IF THEY SHOT RIGHT AT THE BOAT

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED THE

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BOAT INTO SWISS CHEESE.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
REALIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT, I'M

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
SURE AS A GROUP HAS AN

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
LIKE IN ANY OTHER SITUATION.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
INDIVIDUAL EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
SURRENDER.
WE NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HE HAS INFORMATION WE NEED.

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
BUT THERE ARE RULES OF

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
ENGAGEMENT THAT WILL SUGGEST IF

144
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER, THE LIFE

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
OF SOMEBODY ELSE DO WHAT YOU

146
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
HAVE TO DO.
TRY TO TAKE HIM ALIVE.

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DON'T PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE

148
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
TO DO IT.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
>> BOSTON P.D. CAR COMING OUT.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
VEHICLES COMING AND GOING.

151
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
WE HAVE SEEN THIS ALL NIGHT

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
LONG.
HERE ARE FOLKS TOLD A HALF HOUR

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
BEFORE THE GUNSHOTS IT'S OKAY TO

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
COME OUT.

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
FOLK IN WATERTOWN WHO WERE

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ALL DAY

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AND ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN SEEING

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
THE KIDS LOOKING AT THE

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
GROWN-UPS IN THEIR LIVES AND THE

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
GROWN-UPS WERE TOLD DON'T COME

161
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
TO THE DOOR UNLESS YOU ARE

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
CERTAIN IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
WE SAW HOUSE-TO-HOUSE SEARCHES

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
TAKING PLACE WITH LAW

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ENFORCEMENT IN MILITARY DRESS.

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS DRAWN.

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
CAME TO THE HOUSE.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
EMPTIED THE HOUSE OF OCCUPANTS

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
AND WENT IN TO SEARCH IT.

170
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THIS IS SOME OF THE DOOR-TO-DOOR

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
SEARCHES.

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE WE ARE

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SHOWING THE RESIDENTS WERE ASKED

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
TO COME OUT FIRST BEFORE THEY

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
WENT IN.

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
TYPICAL TO WANT TO CLEAR IT

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BEFORE YOU SEARCH.

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
AGAIN, THIS IS -- THIS WAS THE

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
STANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL

180
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
DAY.
THOSE WEAPONS ARE THE SAME

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
ISSUED TO THE ARMED FORCES

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OVERSEAS.

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THAT'S A BASIC M-4

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
SEMI-AUTOMATIC LONG BARRELLED

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
WEAPON.
THEY WERE NOT FOOLING AROUND.

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
THEY HAD AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
OUR REPORTS ARE RICOCHETTING

372
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
AROUND AND PEOPLE VIA BROADCAST

373
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
OR SOCIAL MEDIA OR TELEVISION

374
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
CREWS, PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK IN

375
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
NEWTOWN ARE REACTING WITH

376
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
CHEERS.
PETE WILLIAMS?

377
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
>> WE HAVE CONFIRMED HERE,

378
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
BRIAN, AS WELL THAT THE SUSPECT

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
IS IN CUSTODY.

380
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
WE DON'T KNOW PRECISELY HIS
CONDITION.

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
NOW THE QUESTION IS, OF COURSE,

382
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

383
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
HE'LL BE IN FEDERAL CUSTODY HERE

384
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE

385
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
INVESTIGATION SINCE THE BOMBING

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
HAS BEEN UNDER THE FBI'S

387
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
JURISDICTION BECAUSE OF A

388
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
FEDERAL LAW, A TERRORISM ATTACK

389
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
IS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE

390
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
FBI.
THEY WILL TAKE HIM NOW.

391
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
IF HE'S GRAVELY WOUNDED OR NEEDS

392
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
MEDICAL ATTENTION HE WILL BE

393
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE

394
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
WILL BE GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION.

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCENARIO

396
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
INVOLVING UMAR ABDEL MUTALLAB,

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
THE SO-CALLED CHRISTMAS DAY

398
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
BOMBER, SIMILAR SITUATION.

399
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
HE WAS BADLY HURT, TAKEN TO THE

400
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
HOSPITAL, GIVEN TREATMENT.

401
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
THEN THE FBI PROCEEDED TO

402
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
QUESTION HIM AT LENGTH.

403
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
THAT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL THING

404
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
AT THE TIME.

405
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
PEOPLE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE

406
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
BEEN NOT GIVEN A MIRANDA

407
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
WARNING.
IT TURNED OUT HE WAS QUESTIONED

408
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
FOR A TIME AND THEN GIVEN HIS

409
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
MIRANDA WARNING AND THE POLICE

410
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
SAID HE KEPT TALKING.

411
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
THEY USED IT AS A TEXTBOOK

412
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
EXAMPLE.
THIS WILL REMAIN A CONTROVERSIAL

413
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
DECISION.

414
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
IT IS THE STATED POLICY OF THE

415
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE

416
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
ANYONE LIKE THIS WHO CREATES A

417
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND

418
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
TREAT THEM IN THE REGULAR

419
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
CIVILIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM.

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
THEY WILL TAKE HIM AWAY.

421
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME COMES,

422
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
BEGIN TO QUESTION HIM.

423
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> PETE, I GOT AN E-MAIL USING A

424
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
TERM OF ART IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

425
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
SOMEBODY SAID, REMEMBER, THIS IS
A FEDERAL SHOW.

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
>> MEANING THE FBI IS IN CHARGE.

427
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD SOME

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE SAY THIS

429
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
PERSON SHOULD BE DECLARED AN

430
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
ENEMY COMBATANT, NOT GIVEN

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
MIRANDA WARNING AND SHOULD BE

432
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
SUBJECT TO A MILITARY-STYLE

433
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
INTERROGATION.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL

434
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
NEVER GO FOR THAT.

435
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
THEY BELIEVE SUSPECTS WHO COMMIT

436
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
CRIMES HERE SHOULD BE TREATED IN

437
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL INTEND TO

439
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
DO.
>> MICHAEL LEITER WHO WAS, AMONG

440
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OTHER THINGS, IN THE ROOM THE

441
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
NIGHT OF THE BIN LADEN RAID WHEN

442
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
IT WAS PLANNED AND ORDERS

443
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
CARRIED OUT FROM THE SITUATION

444
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
ROOM.
FORMER HEAD OF COUNTER TERRORISM

445
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
FOR THIS COUNTRY, MICHAEL, WALK

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
US THROUGH WHAT IS LIKELY TO

447
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
HAPPEN NOW.
WHAT'S THE FIRST SET OF OFFICIAL

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
EYEBALLS THAT WILL SIT DOWN

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
ACROSS FROM OR RIDE WITH THIS

450
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
SUSPECT.

451
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO

452
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT

453
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
IT TAKES FOR A 19-YEAR-OLD TO BE

454
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
CONVINCED THAT PUTTING A BOMB

455
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
DOWN NEXT TO LITTLE KIDS IS A

456
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
GOOD IDEA.

457
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
>> BRIAN, AS PETE MENTIONED

458
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
DURING THE CHRISTMAS DAY BOMBER

459
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
IN 2009, WE HADN'T FULLY

460
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
ESTABLISHED A PROTOCOL AND

461
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW A TERROR

462
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
SUSPECT WOULD BE INTERROGATED.

463
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
WE WORKED THROUGH THE PROBLEM

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
MORE.

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
THERE WILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN

466
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
PRETHIS ARREST A VERY EXTENSIVE

467
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE FBI AND

468
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THE REST OF THE INTELLIGENCE

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW SUCH AN

470
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
INTERROGATION WILL OCCUR AND

471
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
WHAT THE KEY ISSUES ARE.

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
THE FBI IS IN CHARGE AS THE LAW

473
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY FOR THE

474
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF

475
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
THE INVESTIGATION.

476
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
BUT THEY WILL HAVE ALREADY HAVE

477
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
WORKED WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE

478
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY AND

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
THE LIKE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

480
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
SORTS OF QUESTIONS NEED TO BE

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
ASKED ABOUT FOREIGN CONTACTS AND

482
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
THE LIKE.

483
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE IS THEY

484
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
WILL TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY.

485
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THERE IS, OF COURSE, THE

486
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL

487
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
MIRANDAIZE HIM RIGHT AWAY.

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
THEY WILL LIKELY USE WHAT'S

489
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
KNOWN AS THE PUBLIC SAFETY

490
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
EXCEPTION.

491
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
THAT GIVES THEM LEGAL AUTHORITY

492
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
TO QUESTION HIM INITIALLY ABOUT

493
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
THINGS WHICH POSE AN IMMEDIATE

494
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

495
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THEY CAN ASK, ARE THERE MORE

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
ANYWHERE?

498
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THAT CAN TAKE SOME TIME.

499
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
THEY CAN GET ALL OF THAT

500
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
INFORMATION FROM HIM BEFORE THEY

501
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
ACTUALLY MIRANDAIZE HIM.

502
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
ONCE THEY MIRANDAIZE HIM, THEY

503
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THE

504
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
THINGS THEY NEED TO KNOW.

505
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
THAT WILL BE DONE BY FBI AGENTS

506
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
BUT, AGAIN, SUPPORTED BY THE

507
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
REST OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY

508
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
COMMUNITY.
IN MY VIEW, THEY WILL WANT TO

509
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
KNOW, AGAIN, ANY WEAPONS OUT

510
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
THERE.

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
MOTIVATION, ANY OTHER

512
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ASSOCIATES, ARE THERE FURTHER

513
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
DANGERS.
THESE ARE THE KEY ISSUES THEY

514
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
WILL PURSUE.

515
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THEN THEY WILL START MOVING OUT

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
TOWARDS MOTIVATION, MORE DISTANT

517
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
NETWORKS, THINGS LIKE THAT.

518
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
>> MICHAEL, ALREADY THIS THING

519
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
IS REICH SPIDER CRACKS WHEN A

520
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
ROCK HITS THE WINDSHIELD.

521
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THIS HAS GONE IN ALL DIRECTIONS

522
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
ALREADY TODAY.

523
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM WHDH IN NEW

524
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
BEDFORD, MASS, THREE PEOPLE HAVE

525
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

526
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
ALL EXPECTED TO BE ROOMMATES

527
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
PRESENTLY OR AT ONE TIME WITH
SUSPECT TWO.

528
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
THIS KIND OF THING WILL HA.

529
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS KID'S

530
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
COMPUTER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

531
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
THEY HAVE GOTTEN ALL RETRIEVABLE

532
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
EVIDENCE FROM THE HOUSE HE SARED

533
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
WITH HIS BROTHER FOR HOWEVER

534
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
LONG.

535
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
PETE WILLIAMS, YOU HAVE

536
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
SOMETHING NEW?

537
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
>> WELL, YES.

538
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

539
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
OFFICIALS CONFIRMED HE'S ALIVE,

540
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
IN CUSTODY.

541
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
UNBELIEVABLE, AS ONE SAID WHO'S

542
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
BEEN FOLLOWING THIS.

543
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT SORT

544
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
OF CONDITION IS HE IN.

545
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
IS HE GRAVELY WOUNDED, WALKING?

546
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
WE DON'T KNOW.

547
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT NOW.

548
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
>> A BIG NIGHT IN WATERTOWN,

549
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
MASS.
I WILL TELL YOU, WHAT A 24 HOURS

550
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED.

551
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
THESE ARE JUST CITIZENS OF A

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
TOWN IN EASTERN MASS.

553
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
THIS WAS VISITED UPON THEM AFTER

554
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
THEY WITNESSED THE HORRIBLE

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
BOMBING AT THE FINISH LINE OF

556
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
THE BOSTON MARATHON.

557
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THERE IS YOUR SUSPECT, IN

558
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
CUSTODY AND ALIVE.

559
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
WE BELIEVE HE SURVIVED ONE OR

560
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
MORE BULLET WOUNDS LAST NIGHT IN

561
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A HAIL OF GUNFIRE.

562
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
LESTER HOLT IS AT STREET LEVEL,

563
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
AS WE HAVE SEEN.

564
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
ACROSS FROM THE TOWN DINER IN

565
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
THIS TOWN THAT CAN NOW START TO

566
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
BREATHE AND LIVE A LITTLE BIT.

567
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
LESTER?
>> WE HEARD 30 SECONDS OF

568
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
SUSTAINED APPLAUSE FROM THE

569
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
CROWD WHEN WORD GOT OUT THAT HE

570
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
WAS IN CUSTODY.

571
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
THESE FOLKS HAVE LIVED THROUGH

572
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
HELL WITH THE SHOTS AND

573
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
EXPLOSIONS.

574
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'M WITH RITA WHO LIVES IN THE

575
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.
WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THE FACT

576
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
THAT THEY HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY.

577
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
>> I'M RELIEVED.

578
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN WATCHING A

579
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
BAD MOVIE I COULDN'T TURN OFF.

580
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'LL BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

581
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
>> THE HELICOPTER CAME OVER AND

582
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
YOU SAID, I WILL BE GLAD WHEN

583
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
THAT'S OVER.

584
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
>> I WILL BE.

585
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
BE IN A WAR ZONE.

587
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
LISTENING TO THEM MADE IT FEEL

588
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
LIKE THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.

589
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
VERY UNSETTLING.

590
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
>> Reporter: GRATEFUL FOR YOU

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
AND THE COMMUNITY.

592
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TALKING

593
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
TO US.

594
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
BIG RELIEF, BRIAN, FOR FOLKS

595
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
THAT WERE POTENTIALLY GOING TO

596
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
FACE ANOTHER NIGHT OF

597
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
UNCERTAINTY THAT THIS PERSON

598
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
COULD BE OUT THERE, A PERSON

599
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
WHO'S SHOWN WILLINGNESS TO DO

600
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
GREAT HARM.

601
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
FOLKS HAVE BEEN OUT ALL DAY.

602
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
THEY WILL REST WELL TONIGHT HERE

603
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
IN WATERTOWN.

604
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
>> LESTER, THANKS.

605
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
IF MICHAEL LEITER CAN STILL HEAR

606
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
US IN WASHINGTON -- ARE YOU WITH

607
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
US?

608
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
>> I AM, BRIAN.

609
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
>> I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL DAY AS

610
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
LONG AS WE KEEP THE BALANCE MORE

611
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
GOOD GUYS THAN BAD WE'LL BE ALL

612
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
RIGHT.

613
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THE OTHER LESSON IS ABOUT LAW

614
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
ENFORCEMENT, TRAILS PEOPLE LEAVE

615
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
BEHIND.
THE LEAPS AND BOUNDS TECHNOLOGY

616
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
HAS TAKEN.

617
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES IN THE

618
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

619
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
FOLLOWING OKLAHOMA CITY WE WERE
IN ROUGH SHAPE IN TERMS OF THE

620
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE THIS TYPE

621
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
OF THING.

622
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
NOW THE SWEEP OF TECHNOLOGY.

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
IT'S HARD TO GET AWAY WITH

624
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
SOMETHING BAD IN THIS COUNTRY.

625
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
>> IT IS.

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THIS IS A SILVER LINING ON A

627
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
DARK CLOUD GOING BACK TO 1996

628
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
WITH OKLAHOMA CITY, 1998 WITH

629
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
KENYA AND TANZANIA, THE FIRST

630
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING

631
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
THROUGH 9/11.

632
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
WHAT THE LAST 12 YEARS HAVE

633
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
GIVEN US IS INCREDIBLE HUMAN

634
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
CAPITAL.

635
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
INCREDIBLE TALENT WITHIN

636
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FBI AND

637
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
CIA.

638
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
INCREDIBLE COORDINATION BETWEEN

639
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

640
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY WOULDN'T

641
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
HAVE HAPPENED IN 2000.

642
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
AND THE TECHNOLOGY TO PULL IT

643
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
TOGETHER.

644
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
FIVE YEARS AGO IT COULD HAVE

645
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
OCCURRED AND WE MIGHT NOT HAVE

646
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
HAD NEARLY THE DIGITAL RECORD

647
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THIS CASE.

648
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE HAD THERE

649
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
NOT BEEN THE VIDEO AND

650
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF THE

651
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
PERPETRATORS.

GUNSHOT WOUND AND BLOOD LOSS.

655
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
NOT KNOWN IF THEY ARE FRESH

656
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
WOUNDS FROM TONIGHT'S EXCHANGE

657
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000

659
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
HOSPITAL IN CAMBRIDGE.

660
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
THE SAME HOSPITAL WHERE TRANSIT

661
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
POLICE OFFICER IS RECOVERING

662
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000

COMMITTED HIS LIFE TO DO --

677
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
ASK THAT THE MEDIA RESPECT OUR

684
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
YOU SEE THE M. P I.T. MARKINGS

685
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
ON HIS LAPELS.

686
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
CAMPUS POLICE OFFICER.

687
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
DID NOT EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO DO

688
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
HIS JOB.

689
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
THE ACCOUNTS ARE HE WAS, SADLY

690
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
BASICALLY EXECUTED BY ONE OR

691
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
BOTH OF THESE SUSPECTS.

692
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
OLDER BROTHER AND YOUNGER.

693
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
YOUNGER BROTHER STILL ALIVE

694
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
BEING TRANSPORTED TO A HOSPITAL.

695
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
WHAT'S GOING TO START HAPPENING

696
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
THERE IN WATERTOWN, AND YOU CAN

697
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
TELL THIS ALREADY, YOU SAW ONE

698
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
TACTICAL OFFICER COME OUT TOWARD

699
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
THE WAITING CROWD.

700
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
IT WILL BE A KIND OF GAUNTLET.

701
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
PEOPLE ARE SO ANXIOUS TO EXPRESS

702
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THEIR THANKS.

703
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
YOU WILL HEAR EVERY ENTERING AND

704
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
EXITING VEHICLE APPLAUDED NOW

705
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
AND HERE IS MY PREDICTION COMING

706
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
TRUE.
THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN ALL

707
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
NIGHT LONG.

708
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO

709
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
LIBERATED THEIR TOWN IN EFFECT.

710
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
GONE THROUGH 24 HOURS OF HELL IN

711
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
WATERTOWN, MASS.

712
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
HEY, LESTER.

713
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
>> YOU'RE SEEING THE AMBULANCE

714
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
JUST WENT BY THE CROWD.

715
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A BIG

716
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
APPLAUSE FROM THE CROWD AS IT

717
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
PARTED AND THE AMBULANCE WENT

718
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
BY.

719
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
WHETHER THE SUSPECT IS TRULY IN

720
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
THERE IS NOT CLEAR.

721
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
WE BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

722
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THAT'S QUITE A REACTION FROM THE

723
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
CROWD.

724
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
THESE FOLKS HAVE HAD A REALLY

725
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
TOUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

726
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
FACING ANOTHER TOUGH NIGHT.

727
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THEY HAVE BEEN STANDING HERE

728
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
WITH US LISTENING TO THE BEST

729
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THEY CAN.

730
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
THEY HEARD HE WAS IN CUSTODY AND

731
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
FOLKS ARE OBVIOUSLY JOYOUS.

732
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
VERY GOOD REASON.

733
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
WE ARE ALL HAPPY THERE WAS NO

734
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
FURTHER BLOODSHED HERE.

735
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
AND THAT THIS IS OVER.

736
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
>> YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE

737
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
HAPPIEST CORNER IN THE

738
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.

739
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL THE

740
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
VEHICLES, FIRST RESPONDERS, LAW

741
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
