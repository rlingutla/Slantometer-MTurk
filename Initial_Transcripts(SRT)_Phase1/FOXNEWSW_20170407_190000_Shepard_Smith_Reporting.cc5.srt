A STARK WARNING FROM RUSSIA.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER IS

INSTEAD OF A OVERWORKED

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
STATEMENT ABOUT A JOINT FIGHT

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
BETWEEN THE ENEMY, ISIS, THE

THEY WILL FIGHT THE LEGITIMATE

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN A TOUGH

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CONTRADICTION WITH INTERNATIONAL

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
AN ATTACK WHICH THE PRESIDENT

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000

STRIKES.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
THIS IS RUSSIAN DEFENSE VIDEO

00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THIS TIME IN COLOR.
ACCORDING TO THE U.S. MILITARY,

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE TARGETS INCLUDING RUNWAY,

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
THE AIRCRAFT THEMSELVES, HANGERS

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
AND FUEL.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'LL SHOW YOU ON SATELLITE

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000

TELEVISION REPORTED THERE FROM

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
NEAR THAT VERY BASE.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
IF YOU LOOK IN THE DISTINCTION

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
ANSWER THE, YOU CAN SEE SMOKE A

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
ON THE HORIZON.

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS IS

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
CLEARLY HIS MOST DRAMATIC

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
MILITARY ORDER SINCE TAKING

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
OFFICE.

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, PROBABLY

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
AS A NATION, IT'S A SIGNIFICANT

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
CHANGE FROM THE U.S. APPROACH IN

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THAT WAR-TORN NATION AND DEALING

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
WITH THE TYRANT HIMSELF WHO FOR

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
YEARS HAS BEEN SLAUGHTERING HIS

104
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
OWN PEOPLE.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
AL-ASSAD CALLED THE STRIKES

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
RECKLESS AND ACCUSED THE UNITED

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
STATES OF HELPING ISIS.

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
>> THE AGGRESSION OF THE U.S. ON

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
SYRIAN AIR FORCE TODAY IS A

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
PROOF THAT THE UNITED STATES IS

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
NOT INTENT ON FIGHTING TERRORISM

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
BUT HELPING TERRORISTS.

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> BEYOND SYRIA, THE WHITE HOUSE

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IS IN A NEW WORLD WITH RUSSIA,

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
IT WOULD APPEAR, ALONG WITH

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
IRAN, AL-ASSAD'S BIGGEST BACKER

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
ALONG WITH THE RUSSIANS.

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
FOX LEARNED THAT A RUSSIAN

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
WARSHIP IS MAKING ITS WAY TO THE

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
AREA AND THIS IS NO LONGER A

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
CONFLICT BY PROXY.

122
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID THAT THE

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
PRESIDENT ORDERED THE STRIKES

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
UNDER A FAR-FETCHED PRETEXT.

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
PUTIN SAYS THEY WILL REDUCE

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
STATES AND REINFORCE AL-ASSAD'S

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
AIR DEFENSES.

129
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE THE

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
AIR STRIKES TARGETED.

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
HERE'S A SATELLITE IMAGE OF THAT

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SYRIAN BASE.
IT'S A PRETTY EXPANSIVE PLACE.

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
YOU CAN SEE THE RUNWAYS AND THE

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ACCESS LANES.

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
THEY'RE FROM IMAGE SAT

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
INTERNATIONAL.

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A PRIVATE COMPANY.

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
LET'S ADD SOME COLOR TO THIS

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
MAP.
THIS WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
OF WHAT EVERYTHING IS.

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
LET'S WATCH THE COLORS.

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
IN THE YELLOW OVER HERE, THOSE

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ARE DESCRIBED AS DOUBLE HASHENED

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AIR CRAFT HANGERS.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
THERE'S 13 IN YELLOW.

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY, THEY

147
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HIT ALL 13.

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
IN ORANGE, THOSE ARE WORKSHOPS.

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THE ONE DOT THERE.

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE.

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
IF YOU LOOK IN THE BLUE DOWN

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
HERE, ALL OF THIS, THESE ARE

153
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
AMMO STORAGE AREAS.

154
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S ROADS

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT LEAD TO THEM FOR STORING

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
AMMO IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
PLACES.
WHERE EACH BLUE CIRCLE IS,

158
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
THAT'S WHERE A TOMAHAWK MISSILE

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
STRIKES.
WE'RE TOLD ALL TEN STORAGE AREAS

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
WERE TAKEN OUT.

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
LET'S LOOK IN RED.

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
THE RED DOTS HERE AGAINST THESE

163
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
ROADS, THEY'RE DEFENSE AND

164
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
CONTROL SYSTEMS.

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
SO IN THESE AREAS, THEY'RE ABLE

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
TO CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

167
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
FLIGHT PATTERN HERE.

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
IN GREEN, FUEL AND STORIES

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
RESERVOIRS.
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S THREE HERE.

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
OFFICIALS SAY THE STRIKES WIPED

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
OUT MOST OF THEM, BUT THEY SAY A

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
COUPLE ARE LEFT.

173
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
WE'LL HAVE COMPREHENSIVE

174
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
JENNIFER GRIFFIN HAS MORE.

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THE PENTAGON IS INVESTIGATING

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
WHETHER MOSCOW WAS INVOLVED IN

178
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THE STRIKE ON THE SYRIAN PEOPLE

179
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WITH THE SARIN GAS.

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
>> WE WERE JUST TOLD THIS BY TWO

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
US IS SENIOR MILITARY

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
COMMANDERS.

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
LAST NIGHT ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS TOLD FOX NEWS THAT

185
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIANS

186
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
WERE PRESENT WHEN THE SYRIANS

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
LOADED THOSE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
TO THAT WAR PLANE.

189
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
U.S. OFFICIALS TELL US A RUSSIAN

190
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
OR SYRIAN DRONE WAS SEEN FLYING

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
OVER A HOSPITAL WHERE THE

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
VICTIMS WERE TAKEN ON TUESDAY

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
SHORTLY BEFORE THAT HOSPITAL WAS

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BOMBED.
THE RUSSIANS OR THE SYRIAN

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
REGIME WAS TRYING TO DESTROY AND

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
COVER UP EVIDENCE OF THE

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
LAST NIGHT THERE WERE 12 TO 100

199
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
RUSSIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL AT

200
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THE SYRIAN AIR BASE WHEN THE

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
U.S. MILITARY STRUCK.

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THAT ACCORDING TO THOSE DEFENSE

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
OFFICIALS THAT JUST BRIEFED HERE

204
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
AT THE PENTAGON.

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THE ALL IS MILITARY TOOK EFFORTS

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
NOT TO HIT THE BARRACKS.

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
ANY RUSSIANS KILLED.

209
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THE U.S. SAID THEY GAVE RUSSIA

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
AN HOUR HEADS-UP.

211
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
ABOUT 20 SYRIAN AIRCRAFT WERE

212
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
DESTROYED AT THE BASE, SHEP.

213
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
>> Shepard: WHAT DO WE KNOW

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
ABOUT THE TIMING ON WHEN THE

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO TAKE THE

216
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
STRIKE?

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> WE'RE TOLD YESTERDAY AT 4:30

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
EASTERN TIME AFTER BEING BRIEFED

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
BUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM

220
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
AT MAR-A-LARGO, HE TOOK THE

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
DECISION.
GENERAL MATTIS AND HIS NATIONAL

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SECURITY ADVISER FLEW DOWN

223
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
SEPARATELY FROM THEIR BOSS WITH

224
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THE PLAN.

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
60 TOM HOUSE MISSILES WERE

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
LAUNCHED FROM THE EASTERN M

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
MEREDETARIAN SEA.

228
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IT TOOKES 30 MINUTES TO LAUNCH

229
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
THE TOMAHAWKS.

230
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SOME CIRCLED OVERHEAD AND THEN

231
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AN HOUR LATER AT 8:40 P.M.

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
EASTERN, ALL 59 MISSILES HIT

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
WITHIN TWO TO THREE MINUTES WITH

234
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID

235
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
THE NERVE AGENTS WERE LOADED ON

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
TO A RUSSIAN-MADE WAR PLANE.

237
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
WE JUST LEARNED THAT THAT

238
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HOTLINE SET UP BETWEEN THE

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
RUSSIAN AND U.S. MILITARY TO

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
PREVENT MILITARY MISHAPS IN

241
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SYRIA, THAT IS BEING SHUT DOWN

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
BY THE RUSSIANS.

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
BACK TO YOU.
>> Shepard: JENNIFER GRIFFIN

244
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
WITH THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
THANK YOU.

246
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
LET'S TURN TO GENERAL JACK KEANE

247
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMY.

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THANKS FOR BEING HERE LAST NIGHT

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
AND TODAY.

250
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
>> GLAD TO BE HERE, SHEP.

251
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> Shepard: A COUPLE THINGS.

252
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
THIS RUSSIAN SHIP, THE RUSSIAN

253
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
DESTROYER ON THE MOVE TOWARD OUR

254
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
SHIPS, WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF

255
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THAT?
AND THE BLUSTER FROM VLADIMIR

256
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
PUTIN AND HIS SPOKESPEOPLE?

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE

258
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
RUSSIAN SHIP IS STAYING IN

259
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
INTERNATIONAL WATERS.

260
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
HAS A RIGHT TO BE THERE.

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I DON'T THINK OUR MILITARY

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
LEADERS ARE ALL THAT CONCERNED

263
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ABOUT IT.

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
RUSSIA DOES NOT WANT TO GO TO

265
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
RUSSIA HAS BEEN POUNDING OUR

267
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
PROXIES INSIDE OF SYRIA, THE

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
SYRIAN MONITORS.

269
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THE C.I.A. WAS THE FIRST ONE

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
THAT THEY BOMBED WITH THEIR AIR

271
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
CAMPAIGN.

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO MORE,

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THAT IT USE THEIR OWN BOMBERS.

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
SO UNLIKELY ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND RUSSIAN

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
SHIPS.

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
IN TERMS OF PUTIN'S BLUSTER,

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
WE'RE USED TO IT AND WE'LL HEAR

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
MORE OF IT.

280
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
FRANKLY, RUSSIA AND IRAN IS IN A

281
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
GOOD SPOT.

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
LET'S FACE IT.

283
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THEY BEAT BACK THE OPPOSITE

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
FORCES OUT OF ALEPPO.

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
THEY CONSOLIDATED THE REGIME'S

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HOLDING.
RUSSIA WAS ABLE TO SUCCEED AND

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY INTENDED TO

288
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
DO, PROP UP THE REGIME WHEN THEY

289
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
WERE IN DANGER OF BEING

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
OVERTHROWN IN 2015.

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
THEY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
WANTED.

293
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I THINK FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING

294
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
THAT WOULD AGGRAVATE THE

295
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
SITUATION FURTHER DOESN'T MAKE A

296
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

297
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
>> AFTER 37 YEARS IN SERVICE AND

298
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
WE THANK YOU.

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CONTACTS.

300
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I WONDER WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING

301
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
IS OF THE NEXT STEPS.

302
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
>> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY AS

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
SAD IS CONTROLLING FATE HERE.

304
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO USE

305
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
WMD, WE'LL TAKE DOWN THOSE OTHER

306
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
FIVE AIR FIELDS AND MAKE CERTAIN

307
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THAT ALL OF HIS AIRCRAFT ARE

308
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
GROUNDED PERMANENTLY.

309
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SO HE HOLDS THAT FATE.

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
WILL DO ANYTHING TO AGGRAVATE

312
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
THE SITUATION WITH THE UNITED

313
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
STATES.

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
THEY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
CONFRONTATION OR CONFLICT WITH

316
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE UNITED STATES.

317
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE,

318
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON TAKING

319
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
ISIS DOWN.
THE PENTAGON HAS SUBMITTED PLANS

320
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
FOR THAT.

321
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS APPROVED THE

322
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
PLANS.

323
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WE'LL SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF

324
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THAT UNFOLD IN THE NEXT NUMBER

325
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
OF WEEKS.
HE'S NOT GOING TO TELL US HOW OR

326
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
WHEN HE'S DOING IT.

327
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
IT WILL UNFOLD AND THE MEDIA

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
WILL START REPORTING ON IT.

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY

330
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
OBJECT SYRIA, LET'S BE FRANK

331
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
ABOUT IT.
THERE'S NOTHING EASY HERE.

332
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
THIS IS BY AND LARGE AN

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
INTRACTABLE SITUATION.

334
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
WE SQUANDERED ALL THE

335
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
OPPORTUNITIES, SHEP, TO DO
SOMETHING FAVORABLE HERE FOR THE

336
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
SYRIAN PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FIVE

337
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
OR SIX YEARS.

338
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WE ARE OUT OF OPTIONS.

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I THINK SAFE ZONES STILL MAKE

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A

341
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
WAY TO GET SOME OF THESE SYRIAN

342
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
PEOPLE AWAY FROM THESE BOMBS

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THAT ARE GOING TO FALL ON THEM,

344
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
CONVENTIONAL BOMBS AND

345
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
ARTILLERY.
WE CAN PROTECT THEM WITH

346
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO DO

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
SOMETHING.

348
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
SHOULD WORK -- IT'S WORTH DOING.

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> Shepard: GENERAL JACK KEANE,

351
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.

352
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
>> THANKS, SHEP.

353
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> Shepard: THE STRIKE IN SYRIA

354
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
WAS A MESSAGE.

355
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
NOT ONLY TO THE SYRIAN DICTATOR

356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
BUT TO OTHERS.

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
THE MISSILE MAY HAVE SENT A

358
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
POWERFUL WARNING TO NORTH KOREA.

359
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
ONE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
WILLING TO GO IT ALONE.

361
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR

362
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP?
AS HE MEETS WITH THE LEADER OF

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
CHINA.
AN ALLY OF NORTH KOREA.

364
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
HOW IMPORTANT A MEETING THAT NOW

365
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
IS AS THE NEWS CONTINUES ON A

366
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
FRIDAY AFTERNOON FROM THE FOX

367

NEWS CHANNEL.

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So much lobster, so little time.

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
At Red Lobster's Lobsterfest

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
any of these 9 lobster dishes
could be yours.

371

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
or Lobsterfest Surf and Turf

373
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
because you won't have this
chance for long.

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
.

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
>> AFTER ORDING THE STRIKE ON

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
SYRIA, THE PRESIDENT HAD DINNER

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
WITH XI JINPING.

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
THAT HAD ABOUT 30 GUESTS AT THE

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
PRESIDENT'S RESORT IN SOUTH

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
FLORIDA.

381
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
AN ANALYST SENT THE MESSAGE THAT

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING TO GO

383
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
IT ALONE WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING

384
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
ON DANGEROUS DICTATORS, POSSIBLY

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
EVEN CHINA'S ALLY IN NORTH

386
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
KOREA.
JOHN ROBERTS IS LIVE IN

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
MAR-A-LARGO IN SOUTH FLORIDA.

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
EXPLAIN HOW THIS DECISION CAME

389
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
ABOUT, JOHN.

390
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
>> SHEP, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
CLEARLY A LOT CHANGED FOR

392
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

393
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
BACK IN 2013, DONALD TRUMP URGED

394
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT TO TAKE

395
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
MILITARY ACTION IN SYRIA IN

396
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
RESPONSE TO THAT AUGUST OF 2013

397
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
SARIN GAS ATTACK THAT KILLED 14.

398
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
BUT NOW HE LAUNCHED ATTACK HE

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
DID LAST NIGHT.

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
WHAT CHANGED?

401
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
HAVING TO WEIGHT OF COMMAND ON

402
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
HIS SHOULDERS, NOW HE'S

403
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
PRESIDENT PLAYED A LOT INTO IT.

404
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
SEEING THE HORRIFIC

405
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
CHILDREN DEAD, DYING OR

406
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
SUFFERING SO HORRIBLY PLAYED

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
INTO IT AND THEN THERE'S THIS

408
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
IDEA THAT IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
WERE TO GET AWAY WITH IT, THE

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS MIGHT

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
BECOME SOMEWHAT NORMALIZED AND

412
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
THEY WOULD BE USED AGAINST THE

414
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
UNITED STATES, WHICH PRESENTS

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THAT URGENT NATIONAL SECURITY

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THREAT THAT THE PRESIDENT CITED

417
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
LAST NIGHT.
THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

418
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
UNFOLDED OVER THE COURSE OF 24

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
HOURS AT FOUR MEETINGS WITH THE

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
PRESIDENT AT 10:00 ON TUESDAY

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
MORNING CULMINATING WITH THE

422
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
MEETING HERE AT MAR-A-LARGO ON

423
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN WHICH THE

424
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION TO

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
GO AHEAD AND DO IT AT 4:00 P.M.

426
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'M TOLD THE PRESIDENT IS VERY

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE ATTACK

428
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
WAS CARRIED OUT, PRAISING THE

429
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
PERFORMANCE OF THE MILITARY

430
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
AMONG MEMBERS OF HIS STAFF AND

431
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
AS WELL, VERY HAPPY WITH THE

432
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THIS, WHICH

433
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
MANY OF AMERICA'S ALLIES AND

434
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
MOST OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES OF

435
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
REGION OFFERING WORDS FOR

436
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
SUPPORT FOR THE ACTION TAKEN IN

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
SYRIA.
>> Shepard: JOHN, ONE COUNTRY

438
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
NOT SUPPORTING THIS IS RUSSIA.

439
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT

440
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
RELATIONSHIP?
>> AS JENNIFER GRIFFIN

441
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
MENTIONED, THIS DEACONFLICTION

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
LINE WILL BE TAKEN DOWN.

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND DESPITE ALL THIS PUBLIC

444
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
BLUSTER AND STATEMENTS, I'M TOLD

445
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
BY SOURCES THAT ALONG OFFICIAL

446
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
DIPLOMATIC LINES THERE'S VERY

447
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
LITTLE BLOW-BACK FROM THE

448
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
RUSSIANS.
SEAN SPICER WAS HERE.

449
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT.

450
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
>> THERE WAS NO CONTACT WITH

451
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
RUSSIA.
THE REST OF THE WORLD

452
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
UNDERSTANDS THAT WE TOOK

453
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
JUSTIFIABLE ACTION BASED ON THE

454
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
TRAGIC ACTIONS THAT THE ASSAD

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
REGIME TOOK.
THIS IS AN ACTION THAT CANNOT BE

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
TOLERATED.
>> HERE'S WHERE THE TALE WILL BE

457
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
TOLD.
REX TILLERSON IS HEADED TO

458
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
MOSCOW NEXT WEEK WHERE HE WILL

459
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
MEET WITH HIS RUSSIAN COUNTER

460
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
PART.
TALK ABOUT BEING A FLY ON THE

461
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
WALL, THAT WILL BE AN

462
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
INTERESTING ONE TO BE A

463
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
PARTICIPANT IN.

464
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
SHEP?
>> Shepard: STAY WARM, JOHN.

465
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
LOOKS NICE THERE, DOESN'T IT?

466
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THE MISSILE STRIKE ON SYRIA WAS

467
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
A MEASURED STEP.

468
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
WE COULD SEE MORE OF IT.

469
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THOSE WORDS FROM THE UNITED

470
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
NATIONS AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY

471
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
TODAY.
I'LL SPEAK WITH CHRIS WALLACE

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT.

473
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
WE'LL HAVE LAWMAKERS LIVE HERE

474
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
TO DISCUSSION THEIR REACTIONS

475
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
AND HOW THIS COULD UNFOLD.

476
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
IT'S A BUSY NEWS DAY.

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
GLAD YOU'RE IN.

478
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm Thomas and
I quit smoking

479
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
with CHANTIX.

480
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I was very grateful
to have CHANTIX.

481
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
At times when I would
normally go smoke,

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I just didn't.

483
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's kind of like
"Wait a minute,

484
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I would normally
be running out

485
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
the door to go grab
a cigarette."

486
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Along with support,

487
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
CHANTIX (varenicline) is proven
to help people quit smoking.

488
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
CHANTIX
reduced my urge to smoke.

489
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Some people had changes
in behavior, thinking or mood,

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
hostility, agitation, depressed
mood and suicidal thoughts

491
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
or actions while taking or
after stopping CHANTIX.

492
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Some reported seizures or
sleepwalking with CHANTIX.

493
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
If you have any of these,

494
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
stop CHANTIX and call your
doctor right away.

495
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Tell your doctor about any

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
history of
mental health problems,

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
which could get worse
or of seizures.

498
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't take CHANTIX
if you've had a serious

499
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
allergic or skin reaction to it.

500
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If you have these, stop CHANTIX
and call your doctor right away

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
as some can be life-threatening.

502
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Tell your doctor if you have
heart or blood vessel problems,

503
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
or develop new
or worse symptoms.

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Get medical help right away
if you have symptoms

505
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
of a heart attack or stroke.

506
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Decrease alcohol use
while taking CHANTIX.

507
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Use caution driving
or operating machinery.

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Most common side effect
is nausea.

509
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Thank you CHANTIX.

510
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ask your doctor if CHANTIX
is right for you.

511
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
>> Shepard: IF YOU'RE GOING TO

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
SUPPORT A BLOODY DICTATOR, THE

513
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
WHOLE WORLD SHOULD KNOW IT.

514
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
THAT'S WHAT NIKKI HALEY TOLD

515
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
BOLIVIA.

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
SHE SAYS BOLIVIA'S AMBASSADOR

517
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
CALLED FOR A CLOSED DOOR MEETING

518
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
AFTER THE STRIKE.

519
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
BUT AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL,

520
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
SHE'S A DECIDER.

521
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
NIKKI HALEY IS HOLDING AN OPEN

522
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
DOOR MEETING INSTEAD.

523
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
ANY COUNTRY THAT CHOOSES TO

524
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
DEFEND THE ATROCITIES OF THE

525
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
REGIME WILL HAVE TO DO SO IN

526
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
PUBLIC VIEW FOR THE WORLD TO

527
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
HEAR.

528
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THE BOLIVIAN AMBASSADOR WELCOMED

529
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
THE MEETING.

530
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
>> THE UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY

531
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
WE'RE PREPARED TO DO MORE.

533
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
BUT WE HELP THAT WILL NOT BE

534
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
NECESSARY.
IT IS TIME FOR ALL CIVILIZED

535
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
NATIONS TO STOP THE HORRORS THAT

536
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ARE TAKING PLACE IN SYRIA AND

537
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
DEMAND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.

538
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
>> AMBASSADOR HALEY CALLED OUT

539
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MOSCOW SAYING THE RUSSIANS HAVE

540
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
STOOD BESIDE SYRIA EVERY TIME

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS CROSSED THE

542
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
LINE OF HUMAN DECENCY.

543
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
LET'S TURN TO CHRIS WALLACE.

544
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
A LOT GOING ON AT THE U.N.

545
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
>> WELL, A LOT IS GOING ON WITH

546
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THE TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY.

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
THINK ABOUT WHAT A DRAMATIC

548
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
STATEMENT THIS IS.

549
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO RAN

550
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
SAYING HE WASN'T GOING TO GET

551
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
INVOLVED AND THIS IS A PRESIDENT

552
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000

555
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 24,

556
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
48 HOURS, ALL THAT HAS GONE OUT

557

558
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS

559
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000

INVOLVEMENT AND COMPLICITY WITH

THE AL-ASSAD REGIME AND ATTACKS

568
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
ON CIVILIANS, A DRAMATIC

569
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
TURN-AROUND IN TRUMP FOREIGN

570
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
POLICY THIS WEEK.

571
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
>> Shepard: HAVE YOU LEARNED

572
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS?

573
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
THE IF THEN POSSIBILITY.

574
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
IF ASSAD CARRIES OUT ANOTHER

575
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
ATTACK LIKE THIS, THEN WHAT?

576
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
>> I'M TOLD THERE'S QUITE A

577
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
SPLIT.
I'M TOLD BY A TOP U.S. OFFICIAL,

578
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THERE'S QUITE A SPLIT INSIDE THE

579
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THAT

580
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
GENERAL MATTIS, SECRETARY OF

581
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
DEFENSE IS ONE OF THE HAWKS ON

582
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
THIS.

583
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
IN FACT, WANTED TO TAKE EVEN

584
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
MORE ACTION IN THIS ATTACK

585
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
YESTERDAY.
THIS IS A VERY MEASURED ATTACK.

586
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
YES, THEY FIRED 59 CRUISE

587
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
MISSILES BUT IT'S ALL AT ONE AIR

588
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
BASE AS GENERAL KEANE MENTIONED.

589
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
ASSAD HAS SIX AIR BASES AND

590
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
COULD HAVE GONE AT AFTER COMMAND

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND CONTROL AND THE PRESIDENT

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
PERSONALLY.

593
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THE PRESIDENT JUST DECIDED TO GO

594
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
AFTER THE ONE BASE SPECIFICALLY

595
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
TIED TO THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN

596
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
NORTHERN IRAQ AND THE CIVILIANS

597
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
THERE.

598
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
MATTIS IS ONE OF THE HAWKS IN

599
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
THIS REGARD AND STEVE BANNON,

600
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
ONE OF THE AMERICAN FIRSTERS AND

601
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
WHO IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE PUSHING

602
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE IDEA

603
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
THAT WE SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED

604
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, WE SHOULD

605
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
BE LOOKING TO THIS COUNTRY, HAS

606
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
BEEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE PUSHING

607
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
FOR RESTRAINT, SEEMS THAT IN HIS

608
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
DECISION YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT

609
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
TRUMP TOOK THE KIND OF HALF

610
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
STEP.
I THINK IT'S EASY TO ANSWER PART

611
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

612
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
IF THERE WERE ANOTHER CHEMICAL

613
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
WEAPONS ATTACK, THERE'S NO DOUBT

614
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD

615
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
RESPOND AND ESCALATE HIS ATTACK.

616
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
THE MORE INTERESTING QUESTION

617
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
IS, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO AFTER

618
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
THE REGIME, HE DIDN'T GET

619
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL WAR, HE

620
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT CHEMICAL

621
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
WEAPONS, WHAT HAPPENS IF ASSAD

622
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
GOES AFTER CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN

623
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
IRAQ WITH CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS?

624
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
THEN WHAT DOESPRESIDENT TRUMP

625
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
DO?

626
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE OVER THE

627
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
LINE BUT SLAUGHTERS THOUSANDS

628
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
WITH CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS ISN'T?

629
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
THAT AND MORE.

LAWMAKER FROM EACH PARTY AND

EACH PARTY'S ROLE IN THIS AND

654
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD

655
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
HAVE TO GO TO CONGRESS FOR

656
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
APPROVAL AS PRESIDENT TRUMP

657
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
SUGGESTED THAT BARACK OBAMA

658
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
SHOULD BACK IN THE DAY.

659
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
BUT FIRST, WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN

660
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
OUR TOP STORY ON ANY OTHER DAY?

661
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
THE NATION GETTING A NEW SUPREME

662
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
COURT JUSTICE.

663
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
IT'S NOT UNTIL THE BOTTOM OF THE

664
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
HOUR.
IT'S THE TOP OF THE NEWS THEN

665
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
AND WE'LL HAVE IT NEXT.

666
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
There's only one egg

667
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that just tastes better.

668
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Fresher.

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
More flavorful.

670
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Delicious.

671
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Only one egg

672
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
with better nutrition-

673
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
like more vitamins

674
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
D, E, and Omega 3s.

675
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And 25% less saturated fat.

676
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Only one egg good enough

677
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
for my family.

678
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Because why have ordinary

679
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
when you can have the best.

680
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Eggland's Best.

681
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The only egg that

682
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
gives you so much more:

683
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Better taste.

684
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Better nutrition.

685
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Better eggs.

686
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
America's veterans are

687
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
on the tour of their lives.

688
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
At DAV we're on a mission

689
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000

CONFIRMATION OF PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT NOMINEE.

SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

698
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
JUDGE GORSUCH'S CONFIRMATION WAS

699
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
PROMPTED BY THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

700
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THE HISTORIC MOVE COULD CHANGE

701
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THE SUPREME COURT AND THE SENATE

702
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

703
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PROTESTED

704
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
SAYING IT WILL ONLY MAKE THE

705
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
SENATE MORE PARTISAN.

706
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
REPUBLICANS SAY DEMOCRATS DIDN'T

707
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
GIVE THEM A CHOICE.

708
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
MOST DEMOCRATS DID OPPOSE THE

709
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
NOMINATION.
SOME SAID IT WAS PARTLY BECAUSE

710
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
REPUBLICANS REFUSED TO HOLD A

711
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000

I need to shave
my A1C

716
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm always on call.

717
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
An insulin
that fits my
schedule is key.

718
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
♪ Tresiba® ready ♪

719
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
(announcer) Tresiba® is used
to control high blood sugar

720
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
in adults with diabetes.

721
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Don't use Tresiba® to treat
diabetic ketoacidosis,

722
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
during episodes
of low blood sugar,

723
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
or if you are allergic to any
of its ingredients.

724
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Don't share needles

725
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
or insulin pens.

726
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Don't reuse needles.

727
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The most common side effect
is low blood sugar,

728
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
which may cause dizziness,

729
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
swtiting, confusion,
and headache.

730
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Check your blood sugar.

731
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Low blood sugar can be serious
and may be life-threatening.

732

Injection site reactions
may occur.

733

and all your medical
conditions.

735

Taking TZDs
with insulins like Tresiba®

736
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
may cause serious side effects
like heart failure.

737

>> Shepard: THE TOP DEMOCRAT IN

749
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

750
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
NANCY PELOSI, IS DEMANDING THAT

751
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
PAUL RYAN IS CALLING THE

752
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
REPRESENTATIVES BACK AFTER THE

753
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
AIR STRIKES LAST NIGHT.

754
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
SHE SAID CONGRESS MUST DEBATE AN

755
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
AUTHORIZATION OF USE OF MILITARY

756
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
FORCE AGAINST A SOVEREIGN

757
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
NATION.

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AN AIDE SAID THE PRESIDENT'S

759
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
ACTIONS WERE WITHIN HIS

760
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
AUTHORITY BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE

761
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
TO CONSULT WITH CONGRESS WHEN

762
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THEY CONSIDER NEXT STEPS FOR THE

763
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
CRISIS IN SYRIA.

764
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES ARE

765
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

766
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
DECISION TO STRIKE IN SYRIA

767
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
WITHOUT FIRST GOING TO CONGRESS.

768
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
IS OTHERS ARE PRAISING HIM FOR

769
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
TAKING THE ACTION.

770
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT SAID

771
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
THE AIR STRIKES WERE IN THE

772
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST

773
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
OF THE UNITED STATES.

774
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
TWO CONGRESSMEN COMING NOW,

775
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
FIRST A DEMOCRAT, GREGORY MEEKS

776
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
OF NEW YORK.
HE'S A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE

777
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE

778
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
AND RANKING MEMBER OF THE

779
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
EUROPE, EURASIA SUBCOMMITTEE.

780
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

781
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
>> THANKS TO BE HERE.

782
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
>> SHOULD THE PRESIDENT HAVE

783
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
CONSULTED CONGRESS?
>> THE ACTS OF MR. ASSAD, THERE

784
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
NEEDS TO BE A RESPONSE.

785
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE

786
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

787
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
HAD HE COME TO CONGRESS FIRST,

788
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
WE WOULD KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS

789
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
BECAUSE A RESPONSE IS NOT A

790
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
STRATEGY.

791
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
YOU WHETHER IT

792
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO

793
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
OR NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT

794
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THE STRATEGY IS.

795
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
THE PRESIDENT JUST A WEEK AGO

796
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN OR AT LEAST

797
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
WHAT HE SAID HOW -- WHAT HE WAS

798
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
TALKING ABOUT.

799
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS -- IT

800
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESIDENT

801
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
NOW TO COME TO CONGRESS WITH

802
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WHAT THAT STRATEGY IS AND IF

803
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL USE OF

804
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
MILITARY FORCE, THEN IT SHOULD

805
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
BE FIRST VOTED ON AND DEBATED BY

806
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES

807
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
CONGRESS.
>> Shepard: SHOULD BASHAR

808
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
AL-ASSAD LAUNCH ANOTHER SARIN

809
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
GAS ATTACK ON HIS OWN PEOPLE

810
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THIS EVENING KILLING WOMEN AND

811
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
BABIES, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO

812
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
TO CONGRESS BEFORE RETALIATING?

813
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
>> I WISH HE CAME BEFORE.

814
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I BELIEVE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

815
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
TO VOTE WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON

816
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
DECIDED TO DO AIR STRIKES ON

817
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
BOSNIA.
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.

818
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH WENT INTO

819
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, I HAD ANT

820
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.

821
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
THAT'S HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

822
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
HAVE THEIR VOICE AND THAT IS

823
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
WHAT THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDS.

824
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
>> Shepard: CONGRESSMAN, DID THE

825
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
PRESIDENT DO THE RIGHT THING

826
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
LAST NIGHT?
>> AGAIN, I SAID THAT IF THERE

827
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
IS A STRATEGY TO GO ALONG

828
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
WITH --
>> Shepard: JUST ON THE SURFACE

829
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
OF IT.

830
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
RETALIATING IN THAT WAY, IN THAT

831
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
MEASURED WAY.
>> IF IT'S JUST A RETALIATION,

832
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
IF IT'S JUST A MESSAGE WITH

833
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
NOTHING ELSE BEHIND IT, THEN I

834
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
WILL SAY NO.

835
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
IF IT IS AND THERE IS A STRATEGY

836
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THAT IS BEHIND IT, THEN WE --

837
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
LET'S TALK.

838
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'M WILLING TO HAVE THAT

839
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
DIALOGUE.
I NEED TO KNOW THE FACTS.

840
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
THAT'S WHAT THE CONSTITUTION

841
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
DEMANDS.

842
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
THE HEAVIEST VOTE THAT A MEMBER

843
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
OF CONGRESS HAS IS TO DETERMINE

844
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
WHETHER OR NOT THAT WE ARE TO

845
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
AUTHORIZE MILITARY FORCE.

846
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I DON'T WANT TO AVOID THAT

847
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
SITUATION.

848
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I ASKED FOR IT ALSO WHEN

849
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS

850
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
CONTEMPLATING UTILIZING MILITARY

851
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
FORCE.
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO CONGRESS

852
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
ASKING THEM TO YOU'D LIES -- TO

853
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY AND
CONGRESS DECIDED NOT TO STEP UP

854
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
TO THE PLATE.

855
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
WE SHOULD STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

856
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S THIS

857
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
PRESIDENT OR ANY PRESIDENT, WE

858
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
SHOULD NOT SHARE WHAT OUR

859
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UNDER THE

860
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.

861
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
>> Shepard: WHAT ALLY DO YOU

862
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
EXPECT TO SEE INVOLVED NOW?

863
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
>> I WOULD HOPE WE HAVE ALL OF

864
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
OUR ALLIES IN THE GULF REGION,

865
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
BECAUSE AS INDICATED IN THE PAST

866
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
BY SECRETARY POWELL, ONCE YOU

867
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
BREAK SOMETHING, YOU OWN IT.

868
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

869
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
OF OUR ALLIES IN THE GULF STATES

870
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
ARE THERE AS WELL AS OUR

871
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
EUROPEAN ALLIES AND ALLIES

872
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
AROUND THE WORLD.

873
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHEN YOU

874
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
TALK ABOUT THE VIOLATION OF THE

875
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS PARTICULARLY,

876
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
IT IS A VIOLATION OF

877
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

878
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I THINK THAT IS CLEAR.

879
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
WE ALL NEED TO STOP AND TRY TO

880
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
FIGHT TOGETHER TO PREVENT THE

881
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT SYRIA

882
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
HAS BEGUN.

883
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WHICH INCLUDES MAKING SURE THAT

884
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
THOSE THAT ARE PROPERLY VETTED

885
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
AND THOSE THAT FOR SAFETY, KIDS

886
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
AND WOMEN AND ET CETERA, THOSE

887
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
PROPERLY VETTED AS THEY'RE GOING

888
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
TO GERMANY, WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM

889
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF

890
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
AMERICA.

891
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
>> THAT WAS PART OF YOUR SHORT

892
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
STATEMENT ON THIS MATTER.

893
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
YOU BELIEVE THAT SYRIAN REFUGEES

894
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE UNITED

895
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
STATES AS THEY ARE IN SO MANY

896
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
OTHER COUNTRIES.

897
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
IS THE VETTING IN PLACE, A

898
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
TWO-YEAR VETTING PROCESS FOR

899
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
REFUGEES, WAS THAT NOT STRONG

900
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
ENOUGH IN YOUR MIND FOR THE

901
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
COUNTRIES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

902
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
DESIGNATED?
>> THE VETTING PROCESS AND HAS

903
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

904
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
ARBITRARILY, DETERMINE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO STOP THOSE THAT

905
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
HAD BEEN VETTEDED FOR TWO YEARS

906
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
AND MAKE THE DETERMINATION AND

907
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE

908
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HELPED US

909
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
IN THE WAR.

910
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN MEMBERS

911
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
OF -- HAD FAMILY MEMBERS HERE

912
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
BUT THEY HAD BEEN VETTED FOR TWO

913
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
YEARS.
FOR US TO ARBITRARILY SAY THAT

914
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
WE'RE NOT GO ALLOW THEM IN I

915
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
THINK IS A MISTAKE.

916
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
IT HURTS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO

917
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WOULD HELP US WITH INTELLIGENCE

918
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
ON THE GROUND FROM GIVING US

919
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THAT INTELLIGENCE.

920
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
>> CONGRESSMAN, GREAT FOR YOU TO

921
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
BE HERE.
THANK YOU.

922
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> MY PLEASURE.

923
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
>> Shepard: AND NOW TO RON JOHN

924
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
ON OF WISCONSIN.

925
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
HE'S A MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN

926
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND THE

927
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
CHAIRMAN OF HOMELAND SECURITY

928
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
COMMITTEE.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

929
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

930
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT MADE

931
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THIS DECISION AFTER SEEING THE

932
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
PICTURES OF THE BABIES

933
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SLAUGHTERED.

934
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
YOU KNOW THAT THIS SLAUGHTER HAS

935
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVEN YEARS.

936
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
THE ACTION OF THIS BRUTAL

937
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
DICTATOR DIDN'T CHANGE.
OUR ACTIONS CHANGED.

938
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
WAS IT WARRANTED AND IF SO WHAT

939
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THE IS WARRANTED GOING FORWARD?

940
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> I DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS AN

941
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

942
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
IT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD

943
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
HAVE DONE AFTER THE FIRST USE OF

944
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS OF THE SYRIAN

945
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
PEOPLE.
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SWIFT AND

946
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
DECISIVE AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY

947
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
MADE A DIFFERENCE.

948
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THE PRESIDENT DITHERED.

949
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HE DIDN'T ASK FOR AN

950
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
AUTHORIZATION.

951
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT ALLOW

952
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
THE MOMENT TO PASS, SO I SUPPORT

953
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
HIS VERY MEASURED RESPONSE TO

954
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THIS ATROCITY.

955
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
>> SHOULD THE SYRIAN DICTATOR

956
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
STRIKE AGAIN ON HIS OWN PEOPLE

957
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS, SHOULD

958
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
THE PRESIDENT TAKE OUT HIS AIR

959
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
FORCE?
>> WE SHOULD RESPOND IN KIND

960
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
PROPORTIONATE WITH WHATEVER

961
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
MEASURES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

962
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
WOULD DEEM APPROPRIATE.

963
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE A

964
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
STEPPED UP RESPONSE.

965
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
>> HE'S BEEN USING BARREL BOMBS

966
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST

967
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
FIVE YEARS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

968
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
VERY CRUDE BOMBS THAT ARE TOSSED

969
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
FROM HELICOPTERS OR FIXED-WING

970
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
PLANES.
THEY KILL EVERY ONE IN THE

971
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
VICINITY THE SAME WAY THESE DO.

972
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
IF WE RESPOND TO THIS SARIN GAS

973
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
ATTACK, SHOULD WE RESPOND TO   N

974
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
CONVENTIONAL ATTACKS?

975
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
>> WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

976
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
THIS GENOCIDE IS CONTINUING

977
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WITHOUT A RESPONSE.

978
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
BUT THAT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S

979
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
CHOICE NOT TO RESPOND, NOT TO

980
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
COME TO CONGRESS WITH ROBUST

981
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
AUTHORIZATION.

982
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
SOMETHING THAT DID NOT TIE THE
HANDS OF THE FUTURE PRESIDENT.

983
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD

984
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
GET AN AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF

985
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
MILITARY FORCE.
IT WAS TOO WEAK.

986
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
HE NEVER TOLD THE AMERICAN

987
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
PUBLIC WHY SYRIA IS IN AMERICA'S

988
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
NATIONAL INTEREST.

989
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
WE'VE SEEN THE MIGRANT FLOW AND

990
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

991
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
FLOWING TO EUROPE DETABLIZING

992
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THOSE COUNTRIES AND PUTTING INTO

993
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
RISK THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM.

994
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE'RE REACTING.

995
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
IT'S IN RESPONSE TO ILLEGAL WAR

996
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
CRIME TYPES OF ACTIONS.

997
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I GUESS WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER

998
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
MEASURES WE SHOULD IN ANSWER TO

999
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
THAT PROVOCATION.

1000
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
>> Shepard: WHAT SHOULD THE

1001
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
LIMIT OF OUR RESPONSE BE IN THE

1002
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
SYRIAN WAR?

1003
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
>> FROM MY STANDPOINT, IF WE'RE

1004
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
GOING TO GET EMBROILED MORE IN

1005
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
THE WAR, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

1006
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME TO THE

1007
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS TO

1008
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
LOOK FOR AN AUTHORIZATION.

1009
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
BY PRESENT, I DO NOT BELIEVE HE

1010
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
NEEDS AUTHORIZATION IN TERMS OF

1011
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
DEFEATING ISIS, WHICH IS NOW IN

1012
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
SYRIA.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO

1013
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SITUATIONS HERE.
THIS RESPONSE WAS A ONE-TIME

1014
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
RESPONSE HOPEFULLY TO DETER

1015
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
FUTURE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

1016
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE

1017
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
SYRIAN SITUATION, OUR FIRST STEP

1018
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
IS TO DEFEAT ISISLE NOW WE HAVE

1019
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
TO ASK OUR SAYS QUESTION.

1020
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
WHO WILL DEFEAT ISIS FORCES IN

1021
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
RAQQA AND WHO WILL HOLD THE

1022
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
GROUND.

1023
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
THAT COULD MAKE A DIPLOMATIC

1024
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
SOLUTION POSSIBLE.

1025
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
>> BACK TO AL-ASSAD.

1026
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
SHOULD THERE BE A REGIME CHANGE?

1027
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
>> I DON'T SEE HOW A DICTATOR, A

1028
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
LEADER OF A COUNTRY WHO HAS

1029
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
SLAUGHTERED 500,000 CITIZENS

1030
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
WILL LAST LONG-TERM.

1031
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
THE SAD FACT, BECAUSE OF OUR

1032
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
LACK OF INVOLVEMENT, WEAKNESS,

1033
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
WE CREATED A VACUUM.

1034
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
IRAN AND RUSSIA HAS FILLED THE

1035
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
VACUUM.
THEY HAVE SOLIDIFIED THEIR

1036
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
POSITION IN WESTERN SYRIA.

1037
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE FACTS ON

1038
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
THE GROUND AND MIGHT ALLOW FOR A

1039
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.

1040
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,000
>> IRAN, RUSSIA AND HEZBOLLAH

1041
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
ARE ALL BACKING THE SYRIANS.

1042
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENGAGE

1043
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
IN THAT FIGHT, YOU'VE SAID HERE

1044
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
THAT WE SHOULD RESPOND IN KIND

1045
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
IF THERE IS BARREL BOMBING AND

1046
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
THE LIKE.

1047
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES PIT

1048
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
ITSELF AGAINST THOSE THREE

1049
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
POWERS AT THE SAME TIME AND DO

1050
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT

1051
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
SPREAD SOMETHING.
>> THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS

1052
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
IS OUTLAWED INTERNATIONALLY.

1053
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
THAT ALLOW AS CERTAIN RESPONSE.

1054
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
>> BARREL BOMBING IS AS WELL.

1055
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
>> I UNDERSTAND.

1056
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
AGAIN, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE

1057
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WORLD DIDN'T RESPONSE.

1058
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
WE'RE RESPONDING NOW.

1059
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR RUSSIA AND

1060
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
IRAN TO DEFEND THE USE OF

1061
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

1062
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
IT WAS RUSSIA INVOLVED IN

1063
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
PRECISION BOMBING OF HOSPITALS

1064
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
AND HUMANITARIAN ENVOYS.

1065
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID

1066
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
NOTHING OTHER THAN TALK ABOUT

1067
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.

1068
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
THIS PRESIDENT PRODUCED REAL

1069
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
CONSEQUENCES.

1070
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
A VERY MEASURED AND VERY

1071
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
DIRECTED APPROACH TO TRY TO

1072
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
DETER FURTHER USE OF CHEMICAL

1073
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
WEAPONS.
I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT GOES FROM

1074
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
HERE.

1075
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
MY STANDPOINT, THE TRUMP

1076
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD LAY OUT A

1077
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
STRATEGY, SHOULD ESTABLISH SOME

1078
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
GOALS.
COME TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,

1079
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
COME TO CONGRESS FOR

1080
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AUTHORIZATION IF HE DECIDES TO

1081
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
DO SOMETHING MORE ROBUST.

1082
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
>> DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICANS

1083
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
AGREEING ON THAT.

1084
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
SENATOR RON JOHNSON, THE

1085
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
REPUBLICAN OF WISCONSIN.

1086
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
GRADE TO BE HERE.

1087
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
>> HAVE A GREAT DAY.
>> Shepard: ONE ANALYST SAID THE

1088
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
STRIKE COULD LEAD TO A POLITICAL

1089
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
SOLUTION AND THERE'S A CLEAR

1090
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
PATH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GET

1091
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THERE.
WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?

1092
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I'LL SPEAK WITH THAT ANALYST

1093
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
NEXT.

1094
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
REMEMBER HERE AT ALLY,

1095
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
NOTHING STOPS US FROM DOING
RIGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS.

1096
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
WHO'S WITH ME?

1097
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
WE'RE LIKE A BASKETBALL
TEAM HERE AT ALLY.

1098
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
IF A BASKETBALL
TEAM HAD OVER 7...

1099
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I'M IN.

1100
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
7,000 PLAYERS.

1101
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
OUR PLAYS ARE A
LITTLE UNORTHODOX.

1102
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
BUT TO BEAT THE BIG BOYS,

1103
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
YOU NEED SMARTER WAYS
TO SAVE PEOPLE MONEY.

1104

>> I THINK SO FAR VERY LITTLE.

1220

PUNISHMENT THAT HE RECEIVED

1222
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
YESTERDAY WAS VERY MINOR

1223

COMPARED TO WHAT WE COULD DO.

1224
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000

1230

OTHERWISE, IT'S FREE GAME FOR

1232
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000

1233
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
KEEP FIGHTING THE WAR WITHOUT

CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

1235
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
AFTER ALL, 99% OF THE KILLING

1236
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
HE'S DONE IS WITH BARREL BOMBS

1237
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000

1282
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
THE SWEDISH MINISTER CALLING IT

1283
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
AN ATTACK OF TERROR.

1284
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
IT HAPPENED IN STOCKHOLM.

1285
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
OFFICIALS SAY THEY STOPPED ALL

1286
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE TRAINS OUT OF THE STATION.

1287
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
TWO LARGE SHOPPING MALLS ALSO

1288
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
SHUT DOWN.

1289
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
POLICE SAY THIS IS AN IMAGE OF

1290
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
MAN THEY ARRESTED.

1291
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THEY RELEASED A PHOTO EARLIER

1292
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
TODAY.
NO WORD ON WHETHER THEY'RE

1293
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
LOOKING FOR OTHER SUSPECTS.

1294
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
THIS IS RIGHT AFTER THE CRASH.

1295
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
SEAR HERE IN THE BACK?

1296
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
THAT IS THE VEHICLE THAT BEER

1297
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
TRUCK THAT RAMMED INTO THE

1298
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
DEPARTMENT STORE.
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO

1299
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
RUN THERE.

1300
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
THE TRUCK STICKING OUT OF THE

1301
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
BUILDING.
FLAMES BURNING IN THE SPOT WHERE

1302
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
IT HIT.

1303
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
HERE'S PEOPLE BEING TREATED ON

1304
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
THE PAVEMENT, THE COBBLESTONE.

1305
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
THE TRUCK ATTACKS ARE ALL TOO

1306
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
FAMILIAR.
POLICE ARE TAKING EXTRA

1307
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
PRECAUTION.

1308
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
AFGHANISTAN IS THE SITE OF

1309
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
AMERICA'S LARGEST WAR.
IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE

1310
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
TO BE MIRED IN FIGHTING THERE,

1311
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
IT'S THE RUSSIANS.

1312
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
BUT THE RUSSIANS CALLED IT QUITS

1313
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY.

1314
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Hey, ready for the big meeting?

1315
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah.

1316
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Uh, hello!?

1317
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
A meeting?

1318
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's a big one.

1319
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Too bad.
We are double booked:

1320
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
diarrhea and
abdominal pain.

1321
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Why don't you start
without me?

1322
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh. Yeah.

1323
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
If you're living with frequent,

1324
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
unpredictable diarrhea
and abdominal pain,

1325
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
you may have...

1326
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
...Irritable Bowel Syndrome
with Diarrhea,

1327
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
or IBS-D.

1328
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
A condition that can
be really frustrating.

1329
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Talk to your doctor
about VIBERZI,

1330
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
a different way to treat IBS-D.

1331
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
VIBERZI is a
prescription medication

1332
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
you take every day

1333
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
that helps proactively manage

1334
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
both diarrhea and abdominal pain

1335
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
at the same time.

1336
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So you stay ahead of
your symptoms.

1337
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
VIBERZI can cause new or
worsening abdominal pain.

1338
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Do not take VIBERZI if you have
or may have had:

1339
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
pancreas or
severe liver problems,

1340
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
problems with alcohol abuse,

1341
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
long-lasting or
severe constipation,

1342
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
or a blockage of your bowel
or gallbladder.

1343
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
If you are taking VIBERZI,

1344
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
you should not take medicines
that cause constipation.

1345
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The most common side effects of
VIBERZI include

1346
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
constipation, nausea, and
abdominal pain.

1347
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Stay ahead of IBS-D...

1348
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
...with VIBERZI.

1349
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
>> Shepard: ON THIS DAY IN 1988,

1350
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
THE SOVIETS DECIDED IT WAS TIME

THE UNITED STATES.

1363
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
IT WOULD TAKE NEARLY A YEAR

1364
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
UNTIL THE LAST SOVIET SOLDIERS

1365
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
