1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,303
THE FREIGHTING BEARING          
COMMERCIAL SIZE GENERATORS?     

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,573
YOU SAW HOW THE FOLKS IN THE    
HOSPITAL RESPONDED WHEN THE U.S.

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:17,783
MARINES AND THE CBs GOT THE     
EMERGENCY GENERATOR WORKING.    

4
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:21,553
THAT BROUGHT POWER AND LIGHT    
BACK AND VENTILATORS IN THE     

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,990
URGENT CARE UNITS AND THE       
INTENSIVE CARE UNITS.           

6
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,193
POWER IS EVERYTHING.            
POWER IS THE BUILDING BLOCK OF  

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,396
MODERN LIFE.                    
WITHOUT IT, PUERTO RICO IS      

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,033
ALREADY IN THE THIRD WORLD THE  
WAY THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW.       

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,602
IT WILL SINK AND SINK UNLESS    
THERE'S MASSIVE AID.            

10
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,773
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT CAN RALLY  
THAT WITH HIS VISIT TUESDAY.    

11
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,475
>> Shepard: THANKS, GERALDO.    
THANKS SO MUCH.                 

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,046
THE PRESIDENT, BY THE WAY,      
CONSIDERING THAT ACT WHICH WOULD

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:59,391
ALLOW OTHER SHIPS TO COME IN    
EVEN THOSE OF A FOREIGN FLAG.   

14
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,893
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.            
STAY WITH US.                   

15
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,265
>> Shepard: GOOD AFTERNOON.     
I'M SHEPARD SMITH.              

16
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:17,736
THE PRESIDENT IS NOW BEGINNING  
TO SPEAK IN INDIANAPOLIS.       

17
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,340
HE'S LAYING OUT HIS PLAN FOR    
CHANGES IN THE TAX CODE.        

18
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,610
WE'RE HOPING FOR SOME SPECIFICS,
SO WE'LL LEARN ABOUT WHAT WILL  

19
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,881
HAPPEN WITH YOUR FAMILY IN MIND.
LET'S LISTEN IN.                

20
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:34,453
LIVE FROM INDIANAPOLIS.         
>> YOU WANT TAX CUTS.           

21
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,255
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE   
GOING SO WILD.                  

22
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,027
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE BACK IN THE
GREAT STATE OF INDIANA.         

23
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,797
WHAT A PLACE.                   
I WANT TO THANK SENATOR TODAY   

24
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:52,171
YOUNG, SENATOR JOE DONNELLY,    
REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE WARLARSKI,

25
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,540
REPRESENTATIVE SUSAN BROOKS AND 
REPRESENTATIVE MIKE MESSER FOR  

26
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,441
JOINING US TODAY.               
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.            

27
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,944
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.       
I APPRECIATE IT.                

28
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,415
[APPLAUSE]                      
I ALSO WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF 

29
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,587
MY ECONOMIC TEAM, SECRETARY     
STEVEN MNUCHIN AND DIRECTOR GARY

30
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:14,626
COHN FOR JOINING US AS WELL.    
WE APPRECIATE IT.               

31
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,895
[APPLAUSE]                      
LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT OUR 

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,433
HEARTS AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO THE
PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO AND THE   

33
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:26,605
VIRGIN ISLANDS THAT ARE         
SUFFERING IN THE WAKE OF ANOTHER

34
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,875
CATASTROPHIC HURRICANE.         
THEIR ISLAND WAS VIRTUALLY      

35
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,377
DESTROYED.                      
FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE WORKING    

36
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,315
CLOSELY WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO  
HELP THESE COMMUNITIES GET BACK 

37
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,051
ON THEIR FEET AS SOON AS        
POSSIBLE.                       

38
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:45,090
TEXAS, FLORIDA, LOUISIANA ARE   
DOING GREAT AND THE RECOVERY    

39
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,725
PROCESS IS HAPPENING VERY       
QUICKLY.                        

40
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,529
I WILL BE GOING DOWN TO PUERTO  
RICO NEXT WEEK TO GET AN        

41
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:54,600
ON-THE-GROUND BRIEFING ABOUT THE
DISASTER RECOVERY AND TO SEE ALL

42
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,837
OF OUR GREAT FIRST RESPONDERS   
AND TO MEET A LOT OF THE PEOPLE 

43
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,406
WHO ARE SO AFFECTED BY THESE    
STORMS.                         

44
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,510
WE ARE WITH YOU NOW, I TELL     
THEM, AND WE WILL BE THERE EVERY

45
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,380
STEP OF THE WAY UNTIL THIS JOB  
IS DONE.                        

46
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:12,217
IT IS TRULY CATASTROPHIC WHAT   
HAPPENED IN PUERTO RICO.        

47
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:20,359
[APPLAUSE]                      
AND MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF WATER,   

48
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:26,498
FOOD AND SUPPLIES, BY THE WAY,  
ARE BEING DELIVERED ON AN HOURLY

49
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,700
BASIS.                          
IT'S SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAS  

50
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,602
EVER SEEN BEFORE FROM THIS      
COUNTRY.                        

51
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,006
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.            
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF ALL OF THE

52
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,377
FOLKS THAT HAVE WORKED SO HARD  
IN FEMA, ALL OF OUR FIRST       

53
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,014
RESPONDERS, ALL OF OUR POLICE   
THAT HAVE GONE TO THE ISLAND    

54
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,883
BECAUSE THEIR POLICE FORCE HAS  
BEEN SO BADLY AFFECTED.         

55
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:49,755
MANY OF THEIR POLICEMEN -- MOST 
OF THEIR POLICE PEOPLE HAVE LOST

56
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,424
THEIR HOMES.                    
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH GO.           

57
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:59,131
BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET IT BACK.
BEFORE WE GO ON TO DISCUSS THE  

58
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:03,535
LARGEST TAX CUT IN OUR COUNTRY'S
HISTORY, I ALSO WANT TO PROVIDE 

59
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:11,943
A BRIEF UPDATE ON HEALTHCARE.   
WE HAVE THE VOTES ON            

60
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,246
GRAHAM-CASSIDY.                 
BUT WITH THE RULES OF           

61
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,917
RECONCILIATION, WE'RE UP AGAINST
A DEADLINE OF FRIDAY, TWO DAYS. 

62
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:24,356
THAT'S JUST TWO DAYS.           
A YES VOTE SENATOR, WE HAVE A   

63
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,795
WONDERFUL SENATOR, GREAT, GREAT 
SENATOR, WHO IS A YES VOTE, BUT 

64
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:37,069
HE'S HOME RECOVERING FROM A     
PRETTY TOUGH SITUATION.         

65
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:42,140
WITH SO MANY GREAT FEATURES,    
INCLUDING THE BLOCK GRANTING,   

66
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,877
THE MONEY TO THE STATES,        
ET CETERA, ET CETERA, OUR       

67
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,014
HEALTHCARE PLAN IS REALLY GOING 
TO BE SOMETHING EXCELLENT.      

68
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:54,553
IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER MANAGED 
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT IT SERVES.  

69
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,322
HAVING LOCAL HEALTHCARE         
REPRESENTATIVES IS FAR BETTER   

70
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:03,895
THAN HAVING HEALTHCARE MANAGED  
FROM WASHINGTON D.C.            

71
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,165
NOT EVEN A CONTEST.             
[APPLAUSE]                      

72
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,336
AND MANY, MANY GOVERNORS, AS YOU
ALSO SEE, HAVE AGREED WITH US   

73
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,107
AND APPROVED IT AND REALLY LOOK 
FORWARD TO RUNNING IT PROPERLY. 

74
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,378
BUT AGAIN, BECAUSE THE          
RECONCILIATION WINDOW IS ABOUT  

75
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,915
TO CLOSE, WE HAVE TO WAIT A FEW 
MONTHS UNTIL IT REOPENS BEFORE  

76
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,485
WE TAKE A VOTE.                 
SO WE'RE GETTING ALL OF THE GOOD

77
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,523
SIGNS FROM ALASKA AND THE OTHERS
TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.

78
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,694
I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE PUT  
ON MY DESK AFTER WE WON THE     

79
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:40,332
ELECTION, AND I'D COME IN AND   
SIGN BUT DIDN'T WORK THAT WAY.  

80
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:44,336
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT I WON'T 
SAY ANYTHING.                   

81
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,407
BUT EARLY NEXT WE'RE WHEN       
RECONCILIATION KICKS BACK IN, IN

82
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:53,278
ANY EVENT, LONG BEFORE THE      
ELECTION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A  

83
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,383
VOTE AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THAT
THROUGH AND I THINK WE'LL GET IT

84
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,721
THROUGH EASILY.                 
BUT SPEAKING OF RECONCILIATION, 

85
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,858
THE REPUBLICAN SENATE NEEDS TO  
GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER RULE, 

86
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,462
WHICH IS BLOCKING SO MANY GREAT 
LEGISLATIVE REFORMS.            

87
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,366
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BADLY WANT  
AND DESERVE IT.                 

88
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,636
BY THE WAY, THE DEMOCRATS, THEY 
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY, WHICH      

89
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,838
HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T FOR MANY,  
MANY YEARS.                     

90
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,941
THEY WOULD GET RID OF IT ON DAY 
ONE.                            

91
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,111
MOST OF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT   
I'M TALKING ABOUT.              

92
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,749
WE'RE HERE TODAY IN INDIANA TO  
ANNOUNCE OUR FRAME WORK TO      

93
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,953
DELIVER HISTORIC TAX RELIEF TO  
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.            

94
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:50,535
[APPLAUSE]                      
THIS IS A ONCE IN A GENERATION  

95
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,137
OPPORTUNITY.                    
I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING 

96
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,740
THAT I CAN SAY THAT I'M VERY    
GOOD AT.                        

97
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,943
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A
LONG TIME.                      

98
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:03,248
WE'RE GOING TO CUT TAXES FOR THE
MIDDLE CLASS, MAYBE THE TAX CODE

99
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:08,320
SIMPLER AND MORE FAIR FOR       
EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND WE'RE    

100
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:12,457
GOING TO BRING BACK THE JOBS AND
WEALTH THAT HAVE LEFT OUR       

101
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,961
COUNTRY AND MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT 
LEFT OUR COUNTRY FOR GOOD.      

102
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:27,205
[APPLAUSE]                      
WE WANT TAX REFORM THAT IS PRO  

103
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:34,079
GROWTH, PRO JOBS, PRO WORKER,   
PRO FAMILY AND YES, TAX REFORM  

104
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:43,555
THAT IS PRO AMERICAN.           
[APPLAUSE]                      

105
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:49,461
IT'S TIME TO TAKE CARE OF OUR   
PEOPLE, TO REBUILD OUR NATION   

106
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,062
AND TO FIGHT FOR OUR GREAT      
AMERICAN WORKERS.               

107
00:08:51,197 --> 00:09:02,941
[APPLAUSE]                      
INDIANA IS A TREMENDOUS EXAMPLE 

108
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:07,379
OF THE PROSPERITY THAT IS       
UNLEASHED WHEN WE CUT TAXES AND 

109
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:11,149
SET FREE THE DREAMS OF OUR      
CITIZENS.                       

110
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:15,720
THIS STATE HAS CLAIMED A        
POWERFUL COMPETITIVE EDGE BUILT 

111
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,925
ON LOW TAXES AND LESS           
REGULATION, AND ARE WE CUTTING  

112
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:29,167
REGULATION.                     
[APPLAUSE]                      

113
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,671
AND BUSINESSES ALL ACROSS THE   
COUNTRY HAVE TAKEN NOTICE.      

114
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:37,342
IN RECENT YEARS, INDIANA HAS    
WELCOMED DOZENS OF COMPANIES    

115
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,846
FLEEING HIGH TAXES AND HIGH TAX 
STATES.                         

116
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,383
THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND MASSIVE   
CAPITAL INVESTMENT HAVE FOLLOWED

117
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,653
MEANING A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE
FOR THE PEOPLE OF INDIANA.      

118
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:53,959
ALL OF THIS IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE 
THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE HAVE   

119
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,964
MADE A DECISION.                
THEY CHOSE TO MAKE INDIANA      

120
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,601
COMPETITIVE AGAIN.              
THEY CHOSE AND THEIR CHOICE WAS 

121
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:08,273
SO IMPORTANT, IT INCLUDED       
ELECTING A GOVERNOR WHO YOU MAY 

122
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:13,945
HAVE HEARD OF, WHO SIGNED THE   
LARGEST INCOME TAX CUT IN THE   

123
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,817
STATE'S HISTORY, OUR VERY       
TERRIFIC PERSON AND TERRIFIC    

124
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:34,299
VICE PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE.     
[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]             

125
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:39,371
IT'S TIME FOR WASHINGTON TO     
LEARN FROM THE WISDOM OF        

126
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:43,141
INDIANA.                        
WE NEED WASHINGTON TO PROMOTE   

127
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,378
AMERICAN JOBS INSTEAD OF        
OBSTRUCTING THEM.               

128
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,482
THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING
TO ACHIEVE EVERY DAY SINCE I    

129
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,918
TOOK OFFICE.                    
THAT IS WHAT I TALKED ABOUT ON  

130
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:58,156
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.             
ALREADY WE'RE SEEING THE RESULTS

131
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,960
OF AN ECONOMIC POLICY THAT      
FINALLY PUTS AMERICA FIRST.     

132
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:13,905
[APPLAUSE]                      
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT A 16-YEAR    

133
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,608
LOW.                            
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AFRICAN        

134
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:21,479
AMERICANS IS NEAR ITS LOWEST    
POINT SINCE THE TURN OF THE     

135
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,748
MILLENNIUM.                     
REALLY A FANTASTIC THING TO SEE.

136
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:31,156
[APPLAUSE]                      
WAGES ARE RISING.               

137
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:38,730
OPTIMISM AMONG MANUFACTURERS HAS
REACHED ALL-TIME HIGHS.         

138
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:44,169
GDP GROWTH LAST QUARTER REACHED 
3% WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.       

139
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,971
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WOULD HAPPEN
FOR A LONG TIME.                

140
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:51,309
[APPLAUSE]                      
AND THIS QUARTER I BELIEVE WOULD

141
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:56,514
HAVE BEEN BETTER, BUT THE       
HURRICANES WILL HAVE AN IMPACT. 

142
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,718
OTHER THAN THAT, IT WOULD HAVE  
BEEN IN MY OPINION EVEN BETTER. 

143
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,289
YOUR GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR  
YOU ONCE AGAIN, NOT FOR THE     

144
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,959
DONORS, NOT THE SPECIAL         
INTERESTS, BUT THE HARD-WORKING 

145
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:08,960
TAX-PAYING CITIZENS OF OUR      
COUNTRY.                        

146
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:18,303
[APPLAUSE]                      
AMERICA IS BACK ON THE RIGHT    

147
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,607
TRACK, AND I SEE SO MANY RED    
HATS "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."

148
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,978
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.        
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.       

149
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:32,884
[APPLAUSE]                      
OUR COUNTRY AND OUR ECONOMY     

150
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:38,523
CANNOT TAKE OFF LIKE THEY SHOULD
UNLESS WE DRAMATICALLY REFORM   

151
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:44,095
AMERICA'S OUTDATED COMPLEX AND  
EXTREMELY BURDENSOME TAX CODE.  

152
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,366
IT'S A RELIC.                   
HAVE TO CHANGE IT.              

153
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,569
WE HAVE TO COMPETE.             
COMPETE WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.   

154
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:56,040
THE CURRENT TAX SYSTEM IS A     
BARRIER STANDING IN THE WAY OF  

155
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,244
AMERICA'S ECONOMIC COMEBACK.    
BECAUSE IT CAN BE FAR GREATER   

156
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,046
THAN IT'S EVER BEEN.            
WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THAT      

157
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:07,485
BARRIER TO CREATE THE TAX SYSTEM
THAT OUR PEOPLE FINALLY,        

158
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,189
FINALLY, FINALLY WANT AND       
DESERVE.                        

159
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,025
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, MY          
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN WORKING 

160
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,829
CLOSELY WITH CONGRESS TO DEVELOP
A FRAME WORK FOR TAX REFORM.    

161
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,266
OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, THE   
HOUSE AND SENATE WILL BUILD ON  

162
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,803
THIS FRAME WORK AND PRODUCE     
LEGISLATION THAT WILL DELIVER   

163
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:30,041
MORE JOBS, HIGHER PAY AND LOWER 
TAXES FOR MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES 

164
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:34,445
FOR THE WORKING MAN AND WOMAN   
AND FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES.

165
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:44,322
I LOOK FORWARD --               
[APPLAUSE]                      

166
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:49,260
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH  
CONGRESS TO DELIVER THESE       

167
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:54,632
HISTORIC TAX CUTS AND REFORMS TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.            

168
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,903
THESE TAX CUTS ARE SIGNIFICANT. 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN TAX CUTS LIKE

169
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:04,876
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.       
OUR FRAME WORK IS BASED ON FOUR 

170
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,048
KEY IDEAS.                      
FIRST, WE WILL CUT TAXES FOR THE

171
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:14,185
EVERYDAY HARD-WORKING AMERICANS.
PEOPLE THAT WORK SO LONG, SO    

172
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,487
HARD AND THEY HAVE BEEN         
FORGOTTEN.                      

173
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,156
BUT THEY'RE NOT FORGOTTEN       
ANYMORE.                        

174
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,557
I THINK WE PROVED THAT ON       
NOVEMBER 8.                     

175
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:32,904
[APPLAUSE]                      
UNDER THIS FRAME WORK, THE FIRST

176
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,842
$12,000 OF INCOME EARNED BY A   
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WILL BE       

177
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:43,615
TAX-FREE.                       
[APPLAUSE]                      

178
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:48,753
AND A MARRIED COUPLE WON'T PAY A
DIME IN TAXES ON THEIR FIRST    

179
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:53,424
$24,000 OF INCOME.              
SO A MARRIED COUPLE UP TO       

180
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,895
$24,000 CAN SPEND THEIR MONEY ON
THEIR FAMILY, ON THEIR CHILDREN,

181
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,531
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO.           
SO MUCH BETTER.                 

182
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,702
IN OTHER WORDS, MORE INCOME FOR 
MORE PEOPLE WILL BE TAXED AT A  

183
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:14,479
RATE OF ZERO.                   
[APPLAUSE]                      

184
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:20,618
AT THIS 0% RATE, TAXABLE INCOME 
WILL BE SUBJECT TO JUST THREE   

185
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:30,028
TAX RATES OF 12%, 25% AND 35%.  
JONATHAN BLANTON AND HIS WIFE,  

186
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,963
JAMIE, FROM GREENTOWN ARE WITH  
US HERE TODAY.                  

187
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,065
WHERE ARE THEY?                 
HELLO, JONATHAN.                

188
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:39,904
HOW ARE YOU?                    
[APPLAUSE]                      

189
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,207
JONATHAN DOES INDUSTRIAL        
JANITORIAL WORK AND JAMIE WORKS 

190
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,844
AT AN AUTO COMPANY.             
TOGETHER THEY'RE RAISING FOUR   

191
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,715
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.             
LAST YEAR THEY EARNED LESS THAN 

192
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,085
$90,000.                        
UNDER OUR TAX PLAN, THEY WOULD  

193
00:15:54,219 --> 00:16:00,959
HAVE SAVED MORE THAN $1,000 AND 
COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE, AND

194
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:05,330
THAT'S JUST ON FEDERAL TAXES.   
SO THEY WOULD HAVE SAVED AT     

195
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,132
LEAST $1,000.                   
MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES WILL SAVE

196
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:11,803
MORE MONEY WITH AN INCREASED    
CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDREN   

197
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,939
UNDER THE AGE OF 17, WHICH SO   
MANY FAMILIES HAVE BEEN CALLING 

198
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:21,946
FOR.                            
[APPLAUSE]                      

199
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,884
WE WILL ELIMINATE THE MARRIAGE  
PENALTY IN THE EXISTING CREDIT  

200
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,055
AND EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO       
INCLUDE EVEN MORE MIDDLE INCOME 

201
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,790
FAMILIES.                       
GREATLY EXPANDED.               

202
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:37,128
WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING THE CHILD  
TAX CREDIT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE   

203
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:42,467
THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT   
OUR COUNTRY CAN MAKE IS IN OUR  

204
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:48,306
CHILDREN.                       
[APPLAUSE]                      

205
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,611
AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE       
CRITICAL WAY THAT WE'RE         

206
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,615
TARGETING RELIEF TO WORKING     
FAMILIES.                       

207
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,886
IN ADDITION UNDER THE FRAME     
WORK, THOSE CARING FOR THE      

208
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:07,525
ELDERLY LOVED AND WE LOVE THESE 
PEOPLE, BUT WE'RE CARING AND WE 

209
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:13,331
TAKE SUCH CARE OF THE ELDERLY.  
OTHER ADULT DEPENDENTS WILL     

210
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:16,100
RECEIVE FINANCIAL RELIEF IN THE 
FORM OF A $500 TAX CREDIT.      

211
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:25,510
[APPLAUSE]                      
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

212
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:30,548
REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN ON YOU AND
YOUR FAMILY BY ELIMINATING TAX  

213
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,484
BREAKS AND LOOP HOLES.          
WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS

214
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:39,891
ARE FOCUSED ON THE MIDDLE CLASS,
THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN, NOT  

215
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:49,534
THE HIGHEST INCOME EARNERS.     
[APPLAUSE]                      

216
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:55,473
OUR FRAME WORK INCLUDES OUR     
COMMITMENT THAT TAX REFORM WILL 

217
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,242
PROTECT LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE   
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.              

218
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,778
NOT THE WEALTHY AND             
WELL-CONNECTED.                 

219
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,947
THEY CAN CALL ME ALL THEY WANT. 
IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP.         

220
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,051
I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING.      
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME, BELIEVE   

221
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:11,856
ME.                             
[APPLAUSE]                      

222
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,128
BUT WHAT IS GOOD FOR ME, NOT    
ONLY AS PRESIDENT AND LEGACY,   

223
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,532
WHAT IS GOOD FOR ME IS IF       
EVERYTHING TAKES OFF LIKE A     

224
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,602
ROCKET SHIP LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE 
FOR 20 YEARS.                   

225
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,938
THAT'S GOOD FOR ME.             
THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONE.       

226
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:31,309
[APPLAUSE]                      
THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO 

227
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,912
HAPPEN.                         
A LOT OF VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE    

228
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:39,951
FEEL THE SAME WAY, BELIEVE ME.  
IN FACT, WE'RE ELIMINATING MOST 

229
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:44,689
ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS THAT        
PRIMARILY BENEFIT THE WEALTHIEST

230
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,625
TAXPAYERS.                      
WE'VE ALSO GIVEN CONGRESS THE   

231
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,329
FLEXIBILITY TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL
TOP RATE ON THE VERY HIGHEST    

232
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,700
INCOME EARNERS TO PROVIDE EVEN  
MORE TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING     

233
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,003
PEOPLE.                         
SECOND, OUR FRAME WORK WILL MAKE

234
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,575
THE TAX CODE SIMPLE, FAIR AND   
EASY TO UNDERSTAND.             

235
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,877
FINALLY.                        
AMERICANS WASTE MONEY --        

236
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:17,688
[APPLAUSE]                      
AMERICANS WASTE A MUCH MONEY.   

237
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,726
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
AND MANY HOURS EACH YEAR TO     

238
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,263
COMPLY WITH OUR RIDICULOUSLY    
COMPLEX TAX CODE.               

239
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:30,535
MORE THAN 90% OF AMERICANS USE  
ASSISTANCE TO PREPARE THEIR     

240
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,770
TAXES.                          
UNDER OUR FRAME WORK, THE VAST  

241
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:38,109
MAJORITY OF FAMILIES WILL BE    
ABLE TO FILE THEIR TAXES ON A   

242
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:51,889
SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER.          
[APPLAUSE]                      

243
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:58,462
WE ARE ALSO REPEALING THE       
ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX OR AMT. 

244
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,831
IT'S ABOUT TIME.                
[APPLAUSE]                      

245
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:07,004
THE AMT IS ACTUALLY A SHADOW TAX
SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES MANY PEOPLE

246
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,909
TO CALCULATE THEIR TAXES TWO    
DIFFERENT WAYS AND PAY THE      

247
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,979
HIGHER OF THE TWO AMOUNTS.      
YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH IT.    

248
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,950
UNDER OUR FRAME WORK, THE AMT   
WILL MAKE EVEN LESSENS BECAUSE  

249
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:23,154
WE'RE REPEALING MANY OF THE     
SPECIAL INTERESTS TAX BREAKS    

250
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,823
THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO DEAL    
WITH.                           

251
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,793
WE'RE MAKING OUR TAXES SIMPLE   
AGAIN.                          

252
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,195
WE'RE SIMPLIFYING OUR TAX       
SYSTEM.                         

253
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,067
TO PROTECT MILLIONS OF SMALL    
BUSINESSES AND THE AMERICAN     

254
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:41,973
FARMER, WE ARE FINALLY ENDING   
THE CRUSHING, THE HORRIBLE, THE 

255
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:46,510
UNFAIR ESTATE TAX OR AS IT IS   
OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE DEATH  

256
00:20:46,645 --> 00:21:04,295
TAX.                            
[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]             

257
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,936
THAT MEANS ESPECIALLY FOR ALL OF
YOU WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THAT  

258
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,772
ARE REALLY TREMENDOUS           
BUSINESSES, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO   

259
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:19,410
LEAVE THEM TO YOUR FAMILY AND   
YOUR FAMILY WON'T HAVE TO RUN   

260
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:23,314
OUT AND DO A FIRE SALE TO TRY TO
GET THE MONEY TO PAY THE TAX.   

261
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,284
LOSE THE BUSINESS.              
ENDS UP GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.  

262
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:30,988
ALL OF THOSE JOBS ARE LOST.     
THE FARMERS IN PARTICULAR ARE   

263
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,757
AFFECTED.                       
THEY HAVE WONDERFUL FARMS, BUT  

264
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,060
THEY CAN'T PAY THE TAX.         
SO THEY HAVE TO SELL THE FARM TO

265
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,696
PEOPLE THAT BUY IT.             
DON'T RUN IT WITH LOVE.         

266
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,932
THEY CAN'T RUN IT THE SAME WAY. 
IT GOES OUT.                    

267
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:46,137
SO THAT DEATH TAX IS A DISASTER 
FOR THIS COUNTRY AND A DISASTER 

268
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:51,842
FOR SO MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND
FARMERS AND WE'RE GETTING RID OF

269
00:21:51,977 --> 00:22:01,752
IT.                             
[APPLAUSE]                      

270
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,423
NOW IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR      
FAMILY, IT WON'T MATTER.        

271
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:10,795
BUT FOR THOSE THAT LOVE YOUR    
FAMILY, IT MATTERS A LOT.       

272
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:17,668
WITH US TODAY IS KIP THOM, A    
FAMILY FARMER FROM LEESBURG.    

273
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:23,074
HI, KIP.                        
WHO FEARS THAT HIS FAMILY'S     

274
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,010
FARMING HERITAGE, BEEN A LONG   
TIME.                           

275
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,013
HOW LONG, KIP?                  
187 YEARS.                      

276
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:32,750
THAT'S PEANUTS.                 
[APPLAUSE]                      

277
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,151
WOW.                            
THAT'S A LONG TIME.             

278
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:38,856
BUT THAT GREAT HERITAGE COULD   
COME TO AN END BECAUSE OF THE   

279
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,893
DEATH TAX OR THE ESTATE TAX AND 
COULD MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM

280
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,996
TO PASS THAT LEGACY TO HIS      
WONDERFUL FAMILY.               

281
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,532
WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT     
HAPPEN.                         

282
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:54,338
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE   
DEATH TAX TO STEAL AWAY THE     

283
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,475
AMERICAN DREAM FROM THESE GREAT,
GREAT FAMILIES.                 

284
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:01,612
MANY OF WHICH ARE IN THIS ROOM  
TODAY.                          

285
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:09,053
[APPLAUSE]                      
WE WILL PROTECT OUR FARMERS, OUR

286
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:13,057
RANCHERS AND OUR SMALL          
BUSINESSES, AND WE WILL MAKE    

287
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,827
TAXES SIMPLE, EASY AND FAIR FOR 
ALL AMERICANS.                  

288
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:24,101
OKAY?                           
[APPLAUSE]                      

289
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,239
30, WE WILL CUT TAXES ON        
AMERICAN BUSINESSES TO RESTORE  

290
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:34,078
OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE AND CREATE 
MORE JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES FOR  

291
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:41,952
AMERICAN WORKERS.               
[APPLAUSE]                      

292
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,956
IN INDIANA YOU HAVE SEEN FIRST  
HAND THAT CUTTING TAXES ON      

293
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,560
BUSINESSES MAKES YOUR STATE MORE
COMPETITIVE AND LEADS TO MORE   

294
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,596
JOBS AND HIGHER PAYCHECKS FOR   
YOUR WORKERS.                   

295
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:59,837
NOW WE WANT TO DO THE SAME THING
FOR AMERICA, MAKING OUR COUNTRY 

296
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,872
MORE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER     
NATIONS.                        

297
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:07,478
IN MANY CASES, THOSE OTHER      
NATIONS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 

298
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,748
NEWS SO MANY WAYS.              
THEY SAY THEY'RE FRIENDS.       

299
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,818
PERHAPS THEY ARE.               
BELIEVE ME, I'M RENEGOTIATING   

300
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,521
OUR TRADE DEALS, INCLUDING      
NAFTA, INCLUDING MANY OTHER     

301
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:23,794
TRADE DEALS.                    
[APPLAUSE]                      

302
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,966
THROUGH REGULATION, ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS LOOK AT THE MASSIVE    

303
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,503
PIPELINES, DAKOTA ACCESS.       
YOU TAKE A LOOK.                

304
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,105
48,000 JOBS IMMEDIATELY         
APPROVED.                       

305
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,677
SO WE'RE LETTING THAT HAPPEN.   
BUT IN TERMS OF THE TAX AND THE 

306
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:44,815
TAX STRATEGY THAT RONALD REAGAN 
USED TO CREATE AN ECONOMIC BOOM 

307
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,554
IN THE 80s WHEN OUR ECONOMY TOOK
OFF, THE MIDDLE CLASS THRIVED   

308
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:55,759
AND THE FAMILY INCOME, ALL      
FAMILIES, WAS INCREASING MORE   

309
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,096
AND MORE AND WAS A BEAUTIFUL    
SIGHT TO BEHOLD.                

310
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:04,969
SINCE THEN OTHER NATIONS HAVE A 
CONTINUED UNFORTUNATELY OUR     

311
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,805
PLAYBOOK.                       
RAN IT EVEN BETTER THAN WE DID. 

312
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,408
I SHOULDN'T SAY EVEN BETTER,    
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T RUN IT WELL AT

313
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:15,012
ALL AND WE LET OTHER NATIONS    
COME IN AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US

314
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,648
AND TAKE OUR JOBS AWAY AND OUR  
BUSINESSES OUT.                 

315
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:21,619
WE'RE STOPPING THAT.            
YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE WHAT  

316
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,655
WE'VE DONE.                     
TODAY OUR TOTAL BUSINESS TAX    

317
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:31,295
RATE IS 60% HIGHER THAN OUR     
AVERAGE FOREIGN COMPETITOR IN   

318
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,564
THE DEVELOPED WORLD.            
THAT'S NOT GOOD.                

319
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,734
WE HAVE SURRENDERED OUR         
COMPETITIVE EDGE TO OTHER       

320
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,436
COUNTRIES BUT WE'RE NOT         
SURRENDERING ANYMORE.           

321
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:43,941
UNDER OUR FRAME WORK, WE WILL   
DRAMATICALLY CUT THE BUSINESS   

322
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,578
TAX RATE SO THAT AMERICAN       
COMPANIES AND AMERICAN WORKERS  

323
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,549
CAN BEAT OUR FOREIGN COMPETITORS
AND START WINNING AGAIN.        

324
00:25:51,683 --> 00:26:09,233
[APPLAUSE]                      
WE WILL REDUCE THE CORPORATE TAX

325
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,803
RATE TO NO HIGHER THAN 20%.     
WAY DOWN FROM 35 AND 39.        

326
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:20,244
[APPLAUSE]                      
WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE

327
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,914
AVERAGE OF OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED 
NATIONS.                        

328
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,118
THIS IS A REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE  
AND THE BIGGEST WINNERS WILL BE 

329
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:33,857
THE EVERYDAY AMERICAN WORKERS AS
JOBS STARTS POURING INTO OUR    

330
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:38,495
COUNTRY AS COMPANIES START      
COMPETING FOR AMERICAN LABOR AND

331
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,901
AS WAGES START GOING UP AT      
LEVELS THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN 

332
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:50,174
MANY YEARS.                     
[APPLAUSE]                      

333
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:54,178
WHEN OUR COMPANIES MOVED TO     
OTHER COUNTRIES, IT'S OUR LOYAL 

334
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:59,383
AMERICAN WORKERS THAT GET HURT. 
WHEN COMPANIES STAY IN AMERICA  

335
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:04,855
AND COME TO AMERICA, IT'S OUR   
WONDERFUL WORKERS THAT REAP THE 

336
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,459
REWARDS.                        
I JUST LEFT THE UNITED NATIONS  

337
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,162
LAST WEEK AND I WAS TOLD BY ONE 
OF THE MOST POWERFUL LEADERS OF 

338
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,700
THE WORLD THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 
BE ANNOUNCING IN THE NOT TOO    

339
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:21,639
DISTANCE FUTURE FIVE MAJOR      
FACTORIES IN THE UNITED STATES  

340
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:26,243
BETWEEN INCREASING AND NEW.     
FIVE.                           

341
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:31,281
YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THAT    
VERY SOON.                      

342
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,619
AND I SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
HE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT?         

343
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,088
IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN IN THE  
UNITED STATES.                  

344
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,492
IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN.        
SO I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW  

345
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,894
THAT.

AGREE THAT WE NEED A TAX CODE

363
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:17,221
TAKE DEDUCTIONS AND DEDUCT THE  
COST OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
