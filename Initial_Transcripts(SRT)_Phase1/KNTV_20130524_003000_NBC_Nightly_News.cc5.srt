AS MOORE BURIED THE FIRST OF ITS

370
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
24 VICTIMS.

BY WHAT THEY SAW MONDAY, WHO

380
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
THEY DIDN'T SEE TODAY.

381
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
>> PARENTS JUST NEED TO SPEAK

382
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
HONESTLY WITH THEIR CHILDREN BUT

383
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
TO ALSO REASSURE THEM THAT THERE

384
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ARE PEOPLE WORKING THAT THEY

385
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
DON'T EVEN SEE TO MAKE SURE THAT

386
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000

CLEANUP ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE EARLY

TRASH HAULERS WERE ABLE TO GET

392
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000

393
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
FOR A COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERED A

394
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
LIFETIME OF HEARTACHE, IN ONLY

395
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
DAYS, ONE CHILD'S WORDS MAY SUM

396
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
UP MOORE'S RESILIENT SPIRIT.

397
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
>> IT MAKES ME REAL GLAD BECAUSE

398
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
SOME OF MY HOUSE GOT RIPPED

399
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
DOWN, AND IT MAKES ME GLAD TO

400
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
SEE MY FRIENDS AND THAT THEY'RE

401
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
ALIVE AND THAT I'M ALIVE AND

402
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000

403
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
