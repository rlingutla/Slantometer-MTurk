 at risk of serious infection,  

268
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,579
      which could lead to

 of infection from 17% to 1%...

 deliver Neulasta the next day, 

274

 receiving strong chemotherapy. 

277
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,165
      Do not take Neulasta

    fatal crises can occur.     

289
