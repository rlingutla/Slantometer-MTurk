PROSECUTORS MAKE THEIR CASE

FOR VICTIMS.

>> THE DEFENSE IS VOWING TO

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
CLEAR HIS NAME.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000

THE REVOLUTION THAT TOPPLED HIM.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000

PROSECUTORS SAY HE SHOT AND

OUR PRODUCENER THE COURTROOM

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
SAYS HERNANDEZ APPEARED TO SMIRK

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WENT

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
THROUGH THE INDICTMENT, WHICH

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
ALSO INCLUDES CHARGES RELATED TO

AFTER THAT SHOOTING HAPPENED,

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
BUT HIS DEFENSE LAWYER SAYS

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
PROSECUTORS STILL DO NOT HAVE

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THEIR CASE

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
>> WE BELIEVE THAT BURDEN WILL

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
NOT BE CARRIED.

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
AARON HERNANDEZ IS AN INNOCENT

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
MAN AS WE STAND HERE TODAY.

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
>> WE WANTED TO PRESENT AS MUCH

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
EVIDENCE TO THE GRAND JURY AS WE

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
COULD BEFORE WE ASKED FOR THE

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
VOTE.

69
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID.

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
>> Shepard: KEEP IN MIND, THE

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
FORMER NEW ENGLAND PATRIOT'S

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
LEGAL TROUBLES MAY BE JUST

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000

INVESTIGATORS ARE REPORTEDLY
TRYING TO LINK AARON HERNANDEZ

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
HERNANDEZ WILL GO FORTH IN

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
SUPERIOR COURT, BUT TODAY HE

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
FACED A DISTRICT COURT JUDGE, A

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
COURTROOM FULL OF REPORTERS, AND

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ALSO THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
MAN HE'S ALLEGED TO HAVE KILLED.

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THE BODY OF 27-YEAR-OLD ODIN

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
HIS MOTHER AND NUMEROUS OTHER

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
RELATIVES WORE PINS TODAY IN HIS

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
MEMORY.
>> I DON'T THINK HAPPY IS THE

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
RIGHT WORD.

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
THIS WAS A VERY GRAVE CASE.

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE LLOYD

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
FAMILY.
I JUST MET WITH SOMEWHERE AROUND

100
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
10 OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS.

101
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THIS IS A GRIM PROFESSION.

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
>> AN ATTORNEY REPRESENTING

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
HERNANDEZ INSISTED HE'S INNOCENT

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
TODAY.

105
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
>> THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
RUSH TO JUDGMENT IN THIS CASE.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
IT HAS BEEN BASED ON INNUENDO,

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
MISREPRESENTATION OF FACTS,

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
HEARSAY AND OPINION HAS BEEN

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
REPRESENTED AS FACT AND AS

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
EVIDENCE, AND IT IS NOT.

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000

SHEP?

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
>> Shepard: MOLLY, THERE MAY BE
SEVERAL IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
THIS CASE.

124
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
FROM FRIENDS OF AARON HERNANDEZ

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TO HIS RELATIVES.

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000

DEFENSE ATTORNEY HEATHER HANSON

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
EXPLAINED HOW PROSECUTORS MAY BE

129
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
TRYING TO GET ONE OR MORE OF

130
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
THOSE PEOPLE TO TURN ON

131
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
HERNANDEZ.

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
>> THE COUSIN WAS ALSO INDICTED

133
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
TODAY, BECAUSE SHE REFUSED TO

134
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
TESTIFY AT THE GRANDURY.

135
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
WALLACE, ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO

136
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
WERE WITH HIM, WAS INDICTED

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
TODAY AS AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
FACT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

139
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
INVOLVED IN THIS.

140
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THE FIANCEE WILL HAVE MORE

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
INVESTIGATION AFTER HER, BECAUSE

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THERE'S THOUGHT HE HAD HELPED TO

143
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
GET RID OF THE GUN.

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

145
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
COULD BE INVOLVED, A LOT OF

146
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO BE AFRAID OF

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
HIM.

148
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
>> Shepard: THE FIANCEE LEFT THE

149
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
COURTHOUSE IN TEARS TODAY.

150
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
SO FAR SHE DOES NOT FACE CHARGES

151
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHOOTING.

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
MINUTES AGO WE GOT WORD THAT

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
JURORS DECIDING THE CASE OF THE

154
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ACCUSED FORT HOOD SHOOTER ARE

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HEADED HOME TONIGHT, NO VERDICT

156
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
TODAY.
JURORS SPENT FOUR HOURS TEED

157
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
DELIBERATING THE FATE OF ARMY

158
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
MAJOR NIDAL HASSAN.

159
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
JURORS RETURNED TO COURT ABOUT

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
15 MINUTES AGO TO ASK A COUPLE

161
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
OF QUESTIONS, BUT AGAIN NO

162
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
VERDICT TONIGHT.
PROSECUTORS SAY THERE IS NO

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
QUESTION THAT MAJOR HASSAN

164
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT THE

165
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
ATTACK IN 2009 AT THAT POST IN

166
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
TEXAS.
HE'S NEVER EVEN DISPUTED IT.

167
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
WHILE HE'S BEEN REPRESENTING

168
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL,

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HE'S HAD VERY LITTLE TO SAY, PUT

170
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
UP NO DEFENSE VIRTUALLY, JUST

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ABOUT THE ONLY WORDS SPOKEN

172
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
TODAY WERE, "THE DEFENSE CHOOSES

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
NOT TO MAKE A CLOSING

174
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
STATEMENT."
THE 13-MEMBER JURY NEEDS ONLY

175
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A 2/3 MAJORITY TO FIND MAJOR

176
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
HASSAN GUILTY OF THE CHARGES,

177
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
BUT IF THEY WANT THE MILITARY TO

178
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
EXECUTE HIM THEY WILL HAVE TO

179
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
ALL BE ON BOARD.

180
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
CASEY STEGALL WITH THE NEWS

181
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
TONIGHT.
CASEY?
>> EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THAT

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PANEL IS A SENIOR RANKING ARMY

183
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OFFICIAL, AN OFFICER, A RANK IN

184
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
FACT OF MAJOR OR HIGHER.

185
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000

NO WOUNDS, JUST LYING DEAD.

831
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
SOME NATIONS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS

832
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000

THAT IF INDEED IT IS

839
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED THIS WAS

CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED BY THE

841
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000

842
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
BE A REACTION OF FORCE AS HE PUT

843
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000

HE SAID 100% THIS IS THE WORK OF

850
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
HE SAID ASSAD TRIES TO CREATE A

851
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
NEW BALANCE OF FEAR WITH THE BYF

852
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
GAS AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

853
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
HE FEELS HE CAN DO IT.

854
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
THIS IS WHERE STRONG AMERICAN

855
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
