00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
HAS THE BOMBER BEEN SPOTTED

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
AS WE'VE HEARD THERE WAS

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000

OF UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000

BUT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE

77
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
FORCED A POSTPONEMENT OF A NEWS

CONFERENCE WHERE OFFICIALS HAD

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
