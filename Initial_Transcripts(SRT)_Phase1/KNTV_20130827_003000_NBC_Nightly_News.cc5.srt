BY CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A MORAL

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
OBSCENITY.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
BY ANY STANDARD IT IS

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
INEXCUSABLE AND DESPITE THE

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
SOME WESTERN OFFICIALS BELIEVE

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THAT PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
PERSONALLY ORDERED THE USE OF

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000

SO AMERICA IS ONCE AGAIN

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
BUILDING A CASE FOR MILITARY
ACTION.

91

GROUND THEY SAY A MILITARY

184
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000

IF RUSSIA HAD CHANGED ITS POLICY

186
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
OR SYRIA ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT IT

187

WE WERE LIKE SISTERS.

430
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
AND IT WAS AN INSTANT

AGE OF 43.

436
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
IT IS A DISEASE NOTORIOUSLY

437
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AT AN
EARLY STAGE.

438
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
SO IN LINDA'S MEMORY, LIZ JOINED

439

AND ROUTINELY TRACKING THE

447
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000

EARLY STAGES OF THE DISEASE WITH

449

RESULTS, SOME WOMEN HAD

CANCEROUS MASS, AND IF

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
NECESSARY, SURGERY.

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
WERE UP, AND SHE WAS DIAGNOSED

462
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
WITH EARLY STAGE OVARIAN CANCER.
>> I JUST THOUGHT I WAS TIRED.

463
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I HAD SOME PAIN, DIFFERENT

464

BASIS.

466
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
>> Reporter: THAT IS COMMON.

467
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
THE REASON SO MANY WOMEN AREN'T

468
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
DIAGNOSED UNTIL THE CANCER HAS

469
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
SPREAD.

470
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
THE PROBLEM, SYMPTOMS ARE OFTEN

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
THEY MAY INCLUDE ABDOMINAL

DISCOMFORT, INCLUDING BLOATING,

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
CRAMPS, CHANGES IN BOWEL HABITS,

476
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
BACK PAIN AND ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

477
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
DOCTORS SAY THERE MAY BE CAUSE

478
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
FOR CONCERN IF ANY OF THESE LAST

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
FOR MORE THAN A FEW WEEKS.

480
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING LIZ'S

PROGRESS THE PAST FEW YEARS.

482
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
SHE HAS HAD SURGERY AND
CHEMOTHERAPY AND NOW IS CANCER

FREE.

484
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
IF YOU ARE WONDERING IF THIS

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
TEST SHOULD BECOME PART OF YOUR

486
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
ROUTINE CHECKUP, THE ANSWER FOR

487
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
RIGHT NOW IS NO.

488
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000

TWO YEARS WHEN THOSE RESULTS ARE

491
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
DUE THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY

492
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
IS CA-125 SPECIFIC ENOUGH FOR

493
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000

AND I THINK OVER AND OVER AGAIN

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
AS YOU AND I HAVE TALKED, IT'S

498
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
