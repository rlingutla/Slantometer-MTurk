[000:03:16;863] IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
[000:03:19;399] >> IT LOOKS LIKE A WAR ZONE AND
[000:03:21;668] IT WAS, IN FACT, A FOG OF WAR.
[000:03:24;037] THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION OF THOSE
[000:03:25;004] EARLY HOURS OF A HECTIC SEARCH

[000:04:02;008] DOGS, TODAY'S SEARCHERS WENT
[000:04:03;509] DOOR TO DOOR.
[000:04:04;410] THE TWISTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
[000:04:05;245] AT LEAST 24 DEATHS INCLUDING 9
[000:04:06;045] CHILDREN.
[000:04:12;252] 7 OF THEM WERE STILL INSIDE
[000:04:12;952] PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
[000:04:13;686] AMONG THEM 9-YEAR-OLD JANAE
[000:04:14;787] HORNSBY.
[000:04:16;222] THESE SISTERS TOOK THEIR OWN
[000:04:17;657] CHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL JUST
[000:04:18;591] MINUTES BEFORE THE TORNADO HIT.
[000:04:22;295] >> WE HAD TURNED ON THE RADIO IN
[000:04:24;297] THE CAR, AND THEY SAID SOMETHING
[000:04:25;431] ABOUT A CHILD.
[000:04:26;366] I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HER NAME.
[000:04:28;167] THAT SHE'S ALIVE.
[000:04:30;236] SHE'S AT A HOSPITAL IN NORMAN.
[000:04:32;472] AND I TOLD MY DAUGHTER, MIA, IS
[000:04:36;276] THAT YOUR FRIEND?
[000:04:36;776] SHE STARTED CRYING.
[000:04:37;310] MOM, THAT'S MY FRIEND.
[000:04:37;877] BUT SHE'S ALIVE?
[000:04:38;344] SHE'S ALIVE.
[000:04:40;947] >> Reporter: IN 40 PETRIFYING
[000:04:42;181] MINUTES THE LANDSCAPE OF THIS
[000:04:45;051] SUBURBAN TOWN WAS CHANGED
[000:04:45;718] FOREVER.
[000:04:47;120] >> I HAVE BLOOD IN MY HAIR FROM
[000:04:49;088] MY FRIEND.
[000:04:50;089] SHE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

[000:04:52;458] HIT PRETTY HARD.
[000:04:52;959] >> Reporter: AT THIS 7-ELEVEN,
[000:04:53;826] FOUR BODIES WERE RECOVERED TODAY

[000:04:57;597] THE MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, WHERE
[000:05:00;366] PATIENTS WERE EVACUATED, NOW
[000:05:01;067] LOOKS LIKE THIS.
[000:05:02;969] ENTRANCES BLOCKED WITH CRUMBLED
[000:05:04;270] CARS TOSSED DURING THE STORM.
[000:05:05;872] THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE DOTTED
[000:05:07;740] WITH TREES, SWIMMING POOLS AND
[000:05:09;676] CUL-DE-SACS NOW COMPLETELY
[000:05:11;778] OBLITERATED, UNRECOGNIZABLE.
[000:05:14;080] THE TWISTER'S DEVASTATING PATH
[000:05:16;215] 17 MILES LONG.
[000:05:17;950] >> THE STREETS ARE JUST GONE.
[000:05:18;918] THE SIGNS ARE JUST GONE.
[000:05:20;653] SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD
[000:05:22;755] TO IDENTIFY VARIOUS AREAS OF
[000:05:23;456] NEED.
[000:05:24;991] >> THERE IT IS.
[000:05:28;227] IT'S A MILE RIGHT THERE.

[000:05:35;201] WATCHED THE HORROR UNFOLD.
[000:05:35;868] >> LOOK AT THAT.
[000:05:38;571] IT'S JUST LIKE A LAWN MOWER WENT
[000:05:39;339] RIGHT THROUGH.
[000:05:40;306] >> Reporter: TODAY WE SURVEYED
[000:05:41;040] THE DAMAGE.
[000:05:41;441] >> THIS WAS THE HEART OF THE
[000:05:42;375] SEARCH YESTERDAY.
[000:05:43;343] >> Reporter: ITS PATH WAS EERILY
[000:05:44;744] REMINISCENT OF THAT TAKEN BY A
[000:05:46;346] RECORD-SETTING TORNADO THAT HIT
[000:05:47;580] HERE 14 YEARS AGO.
[000:05:49;549] THAT TWISTER HAD SPEEDS OF MORE
[000:05:51;918] THAN 300 MILES PER HOUR, DAMAGED
[000:05:54;120] MORE THAN 8,000 HOMES AND KILLED
[000:05:55;688] AT LEAST 36.
[000:05:58;157] THAT 1999 TORNADO TOOK DON
[000:06:00;226] BESSINGER'S FENCE.
[000:06:01;561] THIS ONE TOOK HIS HOME.
[000:06:02;995] HE RODE OUT THE ASSAULT IN A
[000:06:04;664] NEIGHBOR'S STORM SHELTER.
[000:06:05;865] WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU WERE
[000:06:06;599] IN THERE?
[000:06:07;066] COULD YOU HEAR IT?
[000:06:07;734] >> IT WAS LOUD.
[000:06:09;235] EVERYTHING WAS BANGING AGAINST
[000:06:15;041] THE DOORS AND
[000:06:16;642] IT WAS THE HOUSES BREAKING APART
[000:06:19;979] HITTING THE DOOR.
[000:06:20;513] WE THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO
[000:06:21;414] FLY OFF, AND THE MASSIVE DEBRIS
[000:06:22;148] HIT.
[000:06:22;749] SO WE MADE IT TO THE CORNER OF
[000:06:23;483] THE STORM SHELTER BECAUSE WE
[000:06:24;183] THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO
[000:06:24;884] LEAVE.
[000:06:25;251] >> Reporter: TODAY HOMEOWNERS
[000:06:27;019] TRICKLED BACK INTO DESTROYED
[000:06:28;588] NEIGHBORHOODS STARTING WITH THE
[000:06:30;823] SMALL PIECES, AS THEY CONFRONTED
[000:06:32;325] THE BIG TASK OF PUTTING THEIR
[000:06:33;426] LIVES BACK TOGETHER.
[000:06:37;163] AND WE MENTION THAT FLUCTUATING
[000:06:38;798] NUMBER OF CONFIRMED DEAD.
[000:06:40;700] OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD CHANGE
[000:06:42;101] AGAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL
[000:06:43;870] THOSE UNACCOUNTED FOR, BRIAN, AS
[000:06:44;604] THE SEARCH GOES ON.
[000:06:46;773] AND THEY POINT OUT
[000:06:47;273] WE COULD SEE AS MANY AS 20,000
[000:06:48;007] PEOPLE DISPLACED BY ALL THIS.
[000:06:49;275] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:06:51;511] AND THERE'S SO MUCH OF THIS,
[000:06:52;745] THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG HAUL
[000:06:55;248] THAT BEGINS WITH A GRID AND
[000:06:59;519] HOUSE-BY-HOUSE SEARCHES, WHICH
[000:07:00;253] HAVE NOT YET ALL BEEN COMPLETED.
[000:07:00;987] LESTER HOLT STARTING OFF OUR
[000:07:01;687] COVERAGE HERE TONIGHT.
[000:07:02;255] LESTER, THANKS.
[000:07:02;722] >>> IF YOU WERE WATCHING OUR
[000:07:03;556] SPECIAL COVERAGE YESTERDAY IN
[000:07:05;558] THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THIS
[000:07:07;360] TORNADO, THEN YOU KNOW IT TOOK
[000:07:09;629] ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO FOR A KIND
[000:07:11;330] OF SICK FEELING TO ARRIVE IN
[000:07:12;131] THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:07:13;566] WHAT ABOUT THE ELEMENTARY
[000:07:14;300] SCHOOL?
[000:07:16;269] THERE WAS THAT DIRE FIRST REPORT
[000:07:18;704] THAT UPWARDS OF 75 STUDENTS AND
[000:07:20;840] FACULTY MIGHT BE TRAPPED, MIGHT
[000:07:21;808] BE UNACCOUNTED FOR.
[000:07:23;743] LUCKILY THOSE DIRE NUMBERS DID
[000:07:26;612] NOT MATERIALIZE, BUT SADLY THERE
[000:07:29;816] HAS WELL BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH
[000:07:30;917] BAD NEWS TO GO AROUND AT THAT
[000:07:31;617] SCHOOL.
[000:07:33;019] KATE SNOW HAS BEEN THERE FOR US
[000:07:33;753] TODAY.
[000:07:36;222] KATE, GOOD EVENING.
[000:07:37;190] >> Reporter: BRIAN, GOOD EVENING
[000:07:37;924] TO YOU.
[000:07:39;158] THERE WERE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WERE
[000:07:39;892] ACTUALLY IN THE DIRECT PATH OF
[000:07:40;626] THIS TORNADO.
[000:07:41;260] ONE OF THEM, LUCKILY, HAD NO
[000:07:42;295] FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF SO
[000:07:42;995] FAR.
[000:07:46;599] BUT THE OTHER, AT LEAST SEVEN
[000:07:49;302] FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF,
[000:07:49;969] AND THIS WAS A WEEK THAT WAS
[000:07:50;670] SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED WITH
[000:07:51;337] CELEBRATION.
[000:07:52;138] LAST WEEK AT SCHOOL,
[000:07:57;743] GRADUATION.
[000:07:58;678] TOMORROW WAS SUPERKIDS DAY AT
[000:07:59;378] THE SCHOOL.
[000:07:59;946] INSTEAD THEY'RE MOURNING THEIR
[000:08:00;680] CLASSMATES.
[000:08:01;180] INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE PLAZA
[000:08:01;881] TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 500
[000:08:02;582] STUDENTS WERE COUNTING DOWN THE
[000:08:06;419] DAYS IN THEIR FINAL WEEK OF
[000:08:08;454] CLASS, BUT IN JUST A MATTER OF
[000:08:10;256] MINUTES, THEIR CAMPUS WENT
[000:08:11;958] FROM LOOKING LIKE THIS TO THIS.
[000:08:12;692] CLASSROOMS COMPLETELY
[000:08:13;292] OBLITERATED, AN AUDITORIUM CAVED
[000:08:14;026] IN.
[000:08:14;660] PARENTS OF OTHER STUDENTS TELL
[000:08:16;229] NBC NEWS CHILDREN WERE IN THAT
[000:08:16;963] AUDITORIUM.
[000:08:18;431] >> WE'VE SEEN IT FROM THE AIR.
[000:08:20;066] THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME
[000:08:21;501] AS I STEP OUT OF THE WAY, AND
[000:08:22;869] LET JOE ZOOM IN.
[000:08:24;170] THIS IS THE FRONT OF PLAZA
[000:08:25;705] TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
[000:08:28;641] THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.
[000:08:30;076] >> Reporter: IN THE HOURS AFTER
[000:08:31;677] THE TORNADO, DRAMATIC IMAGES,
[000:08:33;613] YOUNG CHILDREN WERE RESCUED, AND
[000:08:35;047] WITH DARKNESS, THE SEARCH FOR
[000:08:36;015] SURVIVORS CONTINUED.
[000:08:38;017] SOME CHILDREN HAD ESCAPED FROM
[000:08:38;985] HARM.
[000:08:42;355] THEIR PARENTS HAD PICKED THEM UP
[000:08:43;089] JUST BEFORE THE SCHOOL WENT ON
[000:08:43;823] LOCKDOWN MONDAY, BUT THE
[000:08:45;358] MAJORITY STAYED INSIDE AS THEY
[000:08:47;059] PRACTICED IN DRILLS MANY TIMES.
[000:08:50;029] MATH TEACHER RHONDA CROSSWHITE
[000:08:51;397] WAS HELPING HER SIXTH GRADERS
[000:08:52;732] WITH AN END OF SCHOOL GAME WHEN
[000:08:53;966] THE PRINCIPAL CAME OVER THE
[000:08:55;268] LOUDSPEAKER AND TOLD THEM TO GO
[000:08:56;002] TO THE HALLWAY.
[000:08:57;803] DAMIAN KLINE IS A FOURTH GRADER.
[000:09:04;410] >> SHE TOLD US ALL TO JUST GET
[000:09:05;811] YOUR MATH BOOK OR YOUR BAG.
[000:09:06;512] I ALREADY HAD MY BAG.
[000:09:07;113] THEN WE WENT IN THE HALL.
[000:09:08;014] >> Reporter: WHY DID SHE TELL
[000:09:08;948] YOU TO GET A MATH BOOK OR A BAG?
[000:09:11;584] >> SO WE COULD PUT IT OVER OUR
[000:09:12;318] HEAD.
[000:09:12;718] >> Reporter: A FIFTH GRADE
[000:09:13;653] TEACHER SAW THE FUNNEL CLOUD
[000:09:14;787] APPROACHING AND YELLED FOR
[000:09:16;055] EVERYONE TO LEAVE THE HALLWAY
[000:09:16;756] AND GET INTO CLOSETS OR
[000:09:18;057] BATHROOMS.
[000:09:18;758] >> HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GET
[000:09:19;692] THEM IN THERE.
[000:09:21;861] I SAID, OKAY, I'LL GET THEM IN.
[000:09:24;797] I'LL STAY OUT HERE.
[000:09:25;798] HE SAID, YOU'RE GETTING IN
[000:09:26;465] THERE, TOO.
[000:09:27;366] >> Reporter: SHE WAS IN A
[000:09:30;036] BATHROOM STALL CROUCHED OVER
[000:09:32;271] FOUR CHILDREN, AND SHE DID WHAT
[000:09:33;339] TEACHERS DO.
[000:09:34;073] >> I REMEMBER THE LITTLE BOY
[000:09:34;774] SAYING I LOVE YOU, MISS
[000:09:35;374] CROSSWHITE.
[000:09:35;775] PLEASE DON'T LET ME DIE WITH
[000:09:36;475] YOU.
[000:09:37;009] WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.
[000:09:38;911] WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.
[000:09:39;512] QUIT SAYING THAT.
[000:09:40;146] AND I DID THE TEACHER THING THAT
[000:09:40;880] WE'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO
[000:09:44;951] DO, I PRAYED, AND I PRAYED OUT
[000:09:46;385] LOUD.
[000:09:48;487] >> WHAT DID YOU SAY?
[000:09:49;855] >> I SAID, GOD PLEASE DON'T TAKE
[000:09:51;490] THESE KIDS TODAY.
[000:09:51;991] >> Reporter: THE CEILING CRASHED
[000:09:52;725] DOWN ON THEM, BUT THE WALLS
[000:09:53;392] STILL STOOD.
[000:09:53;793] WHEN IT WAS QUIET AGAIN, SHE
[000:09:54;493] SENT A SMALL BOY TO CLIMB UP THE
[000:09:55;595] BATHROOM WALL AND LOOK OUT.
[000:09:59;565] >> AND HE GOT UP THERE, AND HE
[000:10:00;299] LOOKED DOWN AT ME, AND HE SAID,
[000:10:01;033] THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.
[000:10:02;234] >> Reporter: DAMIAN WAS IN THE
[000:10:03;502] SAME BATHROOM CROUCHED UNDER A
[000:10:04;236] SINK.
[000:10:05;204] HOW LOUD WAS IT?
[000:10:07;039] >> IT WAS PRETTY LOUD.
[000:10:08;608] >> Reporter: WERE YOU SCARED?
[000:10:09;375] >> MM-HMM.
[000:10:14;213] THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
[000:10:14;914] SCREAMING.
[000:10:16;515] WE COULD HEAR THEM FROM THE
[000:10:17;550] GIRLS RESTROOM.
[000:10:18;584] >> Reporter: HIS MOM SPENT AN
[000:10:19;285] ANXIOUS HOUR WONDERING IF HER
[000:10:20;987] LITTLE BOY WAS STILL ALIVE, AND
[000:10:21;954] NOW SHE WONDERS WHY THE SCHOOL
[000:10:23;756] DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER SHELTER
[000:10:24;457] PLAN.
[000:10:26;525] >> WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK
[000:10:30;529] EVERY SCHOOL IN
[000:10:31;330] OKLAHOMA SHOULD HAVE AN
[000:10:31;931] UNDERGROUND SHELTER.
[000:10:32;732] IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A TORNADO THIS
[000:10:34;634] SIZE AND THIS MANY KIDS HURT,
[000:10:36;902] MISSING AND LOST THEIR LIVES TO
[000:10:38;871] REALIZE THAT THEY NEED
[000:10:39;538] UNDERGROUND SHELTERS.
[000:10:42;208] >> Reporter: IT'S ACTUALLY
[000:10:43;576] REMARKABLE HOW MANY CHILDREN DID
[000:10:44;710] GET OUT OF THIS SCHOOL.
[000:10:48;247] AND, BRIAN, MISS CROSSWHITE WAS
[000:10:49;115] TELLING US THAT THEY HAD SORT OF
[000:10:49;849] A FIREMEN'S BRIGADE GOING WITH
[000:10:53;753] ADULTS HELPING SOME OF THE KIDS
[000:10:55;421] OUT OF THE SCHOOL,
[000:10:57;790] WALKING OVER A BOOKCASE, USING
[000:10:58;524] IT AS STAIRS AND PASS THEM ALONG
[000:10:59;258] FROM ONE ADULT TO THE NEXT TO
[000:10:59;959] GET THEM TO SAFETY.
[000:11:00;493] BUT WE'VE BEEN TOLD HOW HORRIBLE
[000:11:01;227] THE SCENE WAS WITH CHILDREN
[000:11:02;695] LYING EVERYWHERE, INJURED
[000:11:04;497] CHILDREN, A LOT OF PARENTS COULD
[000:11:05;231] BARELY TAKE IT.
[000:11:09;835] >> TWO ISSUES EMERGED THERE, THE
[000:11:10;569] BRAVERY OF THE TEACHERS AND,
[000:11:11;270] SECOND, THIS ISSUE OF WHY THERE
[000:11:12;004] WASN'T A SHELTER THERE.
[000:11:14;507] AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE
[000:11:16;475] THAT ON LATER IN THE BROADCAST.
[000:11:17;543] KATE, THANKS FOR YOUR REPORTING
[000:11:18;277] HERE TODAY ON THE GROUND.
[000:11:19;211] >>> AGAIN, IF YOU WERE WITH US
[000:11:20;112] WHEN THIS NEWS FIRST BROKE
[000:11:21;681] YESTERDAY RIGHT ON THROUGH "NBC
[000:11:23;482] NIGHTLY NEWS" LAST NIGHT, YOU
[000:11:28;454] HEARD OUR INTERVIEW, A VERY
[000:11:30;423] EARLY TENTATIVE INTERVIEW
[000:11:32;124] BY PHONE WITH THE MAYOR OF
[000:11:32;792] MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
[000:11:33;292] WE ASKED HIM AT THE TIME A
[000:11:33;959] QUESTION SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE,
[000:11:35;127] WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?
[000:11:36;162] WELL, WE'RE HAPPY TO WELCOME
[000:11:38;531] MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE WITH US
[000:11:39;265] TONIGHT.
[000:11:40;099] MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR MAKING
[000:11:41;033] TIME.
[000:11:42;468] LET'S USE THIS HOUSE AS AN
[000:11:43;135] EXAMPLE.
[000:11:45;471] I FOUND A PHOTOGRAPH OF TWO
[000:11:47;673] YOUNG WOMEN ON THE FRONT YARD,
[000:11:49;775] BUT I ALSO KNOW -- I'VE COVERED
[000:11:50;609] A LOT OF THESE.
[000:11:51;711] THIS COULD BE FROM 12 MILES
[000:11:52;545] AWAY.
[000:11:55;381] >> RIGHT.
[000:11:55;881] >> THIS WOMAN IS SAID TO HAVE
[000:11:57;850] SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME.
[000:11:58;984] THEY THINK SHE GOT OUT.
[000:11:59;685] THEY'RE NOT SURE.
[000:12:01;654] THIS IS ONE HOUSE IN YOUR TOWN.
[000:12:02;922] WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?
[000:12:05;558] >> PROBABLY AT THE VERY
[000:12:06;959] BEGINNING WHERE IT STARTED RIGHT
[000:12:08;561] BACK OVER HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS.
[000:12:09;662] THAT'S KIND OF GROUND ZERO.
[000:12:11;931] IT ACTUALLY STARTED ACROSS THE
[000:12:13;733] STREET IN OKLAHOMA CITY.
[000:12:15;668] BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY IS IN
[000:12:16;736] OKLAHOMA CITY.
[000:12:18;237] AND IT'S JUST AS DEVASTATED AS
[000:12:19;171] PLAZA TOWERS.
[000:12:21;340] THEY ACTUALLY HAD MORE OF A SAFE
[000:12:22;074] ROOM.
[000:12:23;309] PLAZA TOWERS IS ONE OF THE OLDER
[000:12:24;043] SCHOOLS.
[000:12:24;944] THE OLDER SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE
[000:12:25;644] THEM.
[000:12:26;779] ALL THE NEW SCHOOLS THAT ARE
[000:12:27;913] BUILT HAVE SAFE ROOMS.
[000:12:29;215] UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ONE DIDN'T.
[000:12:31;817] >> WE SHOULD PROBABLY -- FOR
[000:12:35;654] PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
[000:12:37;590] MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WE SHOULD
[000:12:38;257] PROBABLY EMPHASIZE IN PLAIN
[000:12:38;924] ENGLISH, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF
[000:12:39;592] PEOPLE GETTING RICH HERE.
[000:12:40;226] THIS IS A WORKING CLASS TOWN.
[000:12:40;926] >> YES, SIR.
[000:12:42;728] MOST OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE
[000:12:43;395] SCHOOLTEACHERS OR STATE
[000:12:43;996] EMPLOYEES OR FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.
[000:12:45;698] THEY WORK FOR THE FEDERAL
[000:12:46;332] GOVERNMENT USUALLY AT
[000:12:46;899] TINKERFIELD OR FAA.
[000:12:49;668] >> THERE IS ALMOST A FAITH-BASED
[000:12:51;370] FEMA HERE IN OKLAHOMA.
[000:12:51;937] THERE'S ACTUAL FEMA HERE IN
[000:12:52;838] OKLAHOMA.
[000:12:55;274] THERE ARE PRIVATE DONORS, AND
[000:12:56;575] I'VE BEEN ASSURED ALL DAY THAT
[000:12:57;943] SO MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LINING UP
[000:12:59;779] TO TAKE CARE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE
[000:13:01;080] WHO HAVE BEEN HIT.
[000:13:03;716] >> YES.
[000:13:04;049] >> YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT ON THAT
[000:13:05;618] TO REBUILD THIS CITY YET AGAIN
[000:13:07;086] AFTER '99.
[000:13:08;788] >> YES, SIR.
[000:13:10;022] THAT IS FOR A FACT.
[000:13:10;556] WE WILL REBUILD IT.
[000:13:11;090] WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE PLANS.
[000:13:11;824] WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE PROCESS.
[000:13:12;591] IF YOU LOOK OVER ACROSS THE
[000:13:17;696] STREET AT THE HOSPITAL OVER
[000:13:18;364] THERE, THEY'VE STARTED TO CLEAN
[000:13:19;098] UP ALREADY.
[000:13:20;633] WARREN PETERS ALREADY CLEANED UP
[000:13:22;034] THEIR PARKING LOT.
[000:13:23;035] THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.
[000:13:25;805] THERE'S SO MANY TRUCKS THEY
[000:13:26;839] CAN'T GET TO IT.
[000:13:27;540] WE'VE STARTED THE PROCESS
[000:13:28;174] ALREADY.
[000:13:28;541] WE STARTED PUTTING UP STREET
[000:13:29;241] SIGNS.
[000:13:29;675] THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE
[000:13:30;409] TO DO.
[000:13:30;709] PEOPLE SAY, WHY DO YOU DO STREET
[000:13:31;610] SIGNS FIRST?
[000:13:33;479] IT'S LIKE YOU TAKE
[000:13:34;613] CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
[000:13:35;281] INJURED, THEN YOU START PUTTING
[000:13:36;015] UP THE STREET SIGNS.
[000:13:37;583] >> WHY?
[000:13:38;083] >> WELL, YOU CAN'T FIND WHERE
[000:13:39;518] YOU'RE AT.
[000:13:40;319] IF YOU LIVED HERE FOR 30 YEARS,
[000:13:41;053] YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STREET IS.
[000:13:44;824] >> IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HOME.
[000:13:46;492] >> THE HOUSE DOESN'T LOOK THE
[000:13:47;193] SAME EITHER.
[000:13:48;060] >> I JUST WANTED TO JOIN
[000:13:51;163] EVERYBODY WATCHING WISH YOU GOOD
[000:13:51;897] LUCK.
[000:13:52;198] THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH
[000:13:52;932] US TONIGHT.
[000:13:53;332] MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE IN MOORE,
[000:13:54;066] OKLAHOMA.
[000:13:56;268] >>> NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
[000:13:56;969] WEATHER EVENT THAT CAUSED ALL
[000:13:57;670] THIS.
[000:13:57;970] WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE
[000:14:00;039] WRECKAGE OF JUST ONE OF THESE
[000:14:00;739] RESIDENTIAL HOMES.
[000:14:01;240] WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST
[000:14:02;174] OUR OLD FRIEND JIM CANTORE IS
[000:14:02;942] HERE WITH US.
[000:14:04;777] JIM, YOU AND I WERE TALKING
[000:14:06;212] BEFORE ABOUT A STATISTIC
[000:14:08;848] THAT'S STARTING TO SURFACE TODAY
[000:14:09;582] THAT THE SHEER ENERGY, THE
[000:14:12;885] OUTPUT OF THIS STORM EQUALED THE
[000:14:13;619] BOMB IGNITED IN HIROSHIMA.
[000:14:14;954] >> WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
[000:14:17;056] BLAST, CERTAINLY THAT IS AN
[000:14:18;257] AMAZING ANALOGY.
[000:14:21;727] I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TONS OF
[000:14:22;428] DEBRIS EVERYWHERE.
[000:14:22;928] BRIAN, UNRECOGNIZABLE.
[000:14:24;730] IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYONE
[000:14:26;131] COULD SURVIVE IN THIS.
[000:14:27;233] >> NOW, SAFE ROOMS.
[000:14:31;570] LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND LET'S
[000:14:32;271] TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS REGION
[000:14:32;938] NEEDS TO DO.
[000:14:33;372] >> THEY DO.
[000:14:33;873] I MEAN, IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT
[000:14:34;573] OUR KIDS IN A HALL AND TEACH
[000:14:35;908] THEM HOW TO CROUCH AND HOLD
[000:14:38;043] THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEAD, WE
[000:14:38;878] HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE THAT'S NOT
[000:14:39;778] GOING TO BE BLOWN APART.
[000:14:41;046] WE HAVE TO HAVE BUILDINGS THAT
[000:14:42;248] CAN SUSTAIN THE TYPE OF DAMAGE
[000:14:43;349] THAT THEY'RE USED TO HERE,
[000:14:44;116] OBVIOUSLY.
[000:14:49;622] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[000:14:50;155] 200-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.
[000:14:51;790] THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND
[000:14:52;424] OBVIOUSLY A BIG THING THEY NEED
[000:14:53;158] TO ADDRESS.
[000:14:53;559] PEOPLE'S HOMES.
[000:14:54;026] I WAS DOWN IN TUSCALOOSA, AS
[000:14:58;063] WERE YOU, AND AFTER THE 27,
[000:14:58;731] APRIL 2011 OUTBREAK, WE SAW THEM
[000:15:00;499] BUILD BACK HOMES FOR $75,000
[000:15:01;800] WITH SAFE ROOMS.
[000:15:02;301] >> WITH SHELTERS.
[000:15:03;469] >> WITH SAFE ROOMS IN THEM.
[000:15:04;904] SO THIS IS NOT AN UNDOABLE
[000:15:05;571] THING.
[000:15:07;606] >> NOW, BRING US UP TO DATE.
[000:15:09;675] WE MENTIONED SEVEN DIFFERENT
[000:15:10;376] STATES HAVE WATCHES AND
[000:15:10;976] WARNINGS.
[000:15:11;377] TONIGHT AS WE STAND HERE
[000:15:12;611] TALKING --
[000:15:13;545] >> A WEEK AND A HALF AGO THE
[000:15:17;883] ATMOSPHERE DECIDED
[000:15:19;585] WE'RE GOING TO PULL A SWITCH,
[000:15:20;819] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
[000:15:22;421] THE TORNADO DROUGHT IS OVER AND
[000:15:23;155] YOU'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT.
[000:15:23;889] WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TONIGHT IS
[000:15:27;660] THUNDERSTORMS ALL THE WAY REALLY
[000:15:28;394] FROM NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT ON
[000:15:29;128] DOWN THROUGH TENNESSEE.
[000:15:31;297] SHREVEPORT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO
[000:15:33;699] FACE SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS
[000:15:35;200] TONIGHT, AUSTIN, TEXAS, MEMPHIS
[000:15:37;736] TENNESSEE, AS WELL.
[000:15:38;270] TORNADO WATCHES.
[000:15:38;737] >> JIM CANTORE, THANK YOU FOR
[000:15:39;438] BEING PART OF THE COVERAGE.
[000:15:40;139] >> ALWAYS, ALWAYS.
[000:15:40;673] >> WE'LL TAKE A BREAK IN OUR
[000:15:41;373] COVERAGE.
[000:15:43;108] WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING
[000:15:44;443] TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS BUILDING
[000:15:45;778] CODE AND SHELTER ISSUE HERE IN
[000:15:47;980] THIS DEVASTATED TOWN OF MOORE,
[000:15:48;714] OKLAHOMA.
[000:17:59;878] >>> WELCOME BACK.
[000:18:00;779] HERE IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA,
[000:18:02;147] THE EXPRESSION "THIS HARD LAND"
[000:18:03;749] COMES TO MIND, AND IT'S TRUE IN
[000:18:05;150] MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
[000:18:06;585] WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE
[000:18:10;122] NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF TORNADO
[000:18:12;124] PREPARATION IS HELD IN OKLAHOMA
[000:18:14;159] CITY, AND THEY DO THAT EVERY
[000:18:16;595] YEAR FOR A REASON.
[000:18:17;996] THIS WEATHER IS A SURPRISE TO NO
[000:18:21;033] ONE, AND FOR THE MOST PART
[000:18:21;700] THEY'RE READY FOR IT WHEN IT
[000:18:22;401] COMES.
[000:18:23;235] BUT NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY
[000:18:31;043] PEOPLE ON BOTH COASTS ARE ASKING
[000:18:31;777] WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SHELTERS,
[000:18:32;511] CELLARS, BASEMENTS?
[000:18:33;045] WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SAFE
[000:18:33;979] HOUSES WITHIN HOUSES ACROSS THIS
[000:18:35;047] REGION GIVEN THE WEATHER HERE?
[000:18:36;715] OUR REPORT ON THAT TONIGHT FROM
[000:18:37;916] NBC'S TOM COSTELLO.
[000:18:41;353] >> Reporter: YET ANOTHER
[000:18:43;088] DEVASTATING TORNADO, AND SO MANY
[000:18:46;625] PEOPLE ARE ASKING, WHY AREN'T
[000:18:47;326] THERE MORE BASEMENTS IN THE VERY
[000:18:48;861] PLACE THEY NEED THEM MOST,
[000:18:49;528] TORNADO ALLEY, AND WHY AREN'T
[000:18:51;330] THERE MORE TORNADO SHELTERS?
[000:18:52;998] MANY OF THOSE WHO MANAGED TO GET
[000:18:53;932] UNDERGROUND SURVIVED.
[000:18:55;601] >> IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR, AND
[000:19:00;906] IT -- JUST GLASS AND DEBRIS
[000:19:01;573] STARTED SLAMMING ON US.
[000:19:02;674] WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE
[000:19:03;408] HONEST.
[000:19:04;176] >> Reporter: BASEMENTS ARE NOT
[000:19:05;744] COMMON IN OKLAHOMA BECAUSE THE
[000:19:07;713] SOIL, HEAVY WITH CLAY AND WATER,
[000:19:09;948] MAKES ANYTHING UNDERGROUND PRONE
[000:19:10;716] TO FLOODING AND MOLD.
[000:19:12;718] SO MOST HOMES ARE BUILT ON A
[000:19:14;353] CONCRETE SLAB.
[000:19:15;420] AND MOST HOMES CAN ONLY
[000:19:17;589] WITHSTAND 90-MILE-PER-HOUR
[000:19:19;091] WINDS, NOT 200.
[000:19:21;059] >> WE JUST DON'T DESIGN HOMES ON
[000:19:22;694] THE INTERIOR OF THIS COUNTRY TO
[000:19:25;264] WITHSTAND THE WINDS THE SAME WAY
[000:19:26;698] THEY WOULD DO ALONG THE COAST.
[000:19:27;866] >> Reporter: BUT BUILDING A SAFE
[000:19:28;600] ROOM FOR A SHELTER IS A
[000:19:29;201] DIFFERENT MATTER.
[000:19:31;103] A RESIDENTIAL
[000:19:33;005] SAFE ROOM CAN BE INSTALLED IN
[000:19:33;705] THE GROUND OR INSIDE THE HOME
[000:19:34;406] ITSELF.
[000:19:35;174] A REINFORCED BOX ALMOST LIKE A
