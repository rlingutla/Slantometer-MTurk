[000:00:00;400] BACKPACK.
[000:00:02;736] THE OTHER MAN IS WEARING A BLACK
[000:00:05;705] BASEBALL CAP WITH WHITE BANDS ON
[000:00:07;707] THE BILL AND A WHITE LETTER ON
[000:00:09;342] THE FRONT.
[000:00:10;176] HE'S WEARING A WHITE V-NECK
[000:00:11;177] T-SHIRT, BEIGE PANTS, A BLACK
[000:00:11;878] HOODED COAT.
[000:00:15;582] HE'S CARRYING A DARK BACKPACK.
[000:00:17;150] THIS VIDEO SHOWS THE MEN WALKING
[000:00:18;418] TOGETHER TOWARD THE FINISH LINE.
[000:00:20;286] THE FBI SAYS THE MAN IN THE
[000:00:22;122] WHITE BASEBALL CAP FIRST
[000:00:23;556] ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION
[000:00:25;392] BECAUSE HE APPEARED TO BE
[000:00:31;931] PLACING ONE OF THE BOMBS.
[000:00:33;666] >> THE ONLY ONE OBSERVED TO BE
[000:00:34;401] PLANTING WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE
[000:00:35;135] DEVICE IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO
[000:00:37;637] WITH THE WHITE CAP.
[000:00:38;171] >> WHAT TIME DID THEY PUT THE
[000:00:38;938] DEVICES DOWN?
[000:00:39;372] >> I DON'T HAVE THE PRECISE TIME
[000:00:40;106] IN FRONT OF ME.
[000:00:40;573] IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE THE BOMB
[000:00:41;307] BLASTS WENT OFF.
[000:00:41;775] >> Reporter: INVESTIGATORS SAY
[000:00:42;509] THEIR ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED ON
[000:00:43;243] THE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAT.
[000:00:44;344] AS THEY ANALYZED MORE PICTURES
[000:00:46;146] THEY REALIZED THE TWO SPENT TIME
[000:00:48;014] TOGETHER.
[000:00:48;381] THEY SAY THEY DID NOT SEE THE
[000:00:50;417] OTHER MAN ACTUALLY PLANTING A
[000:00:51;117] BOMB.
[000:00:54;020] >> SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS
[000:00:55;522] THESE INDIVIDUALS AS FRIENDS,
[000:00:57;657] NEIGHBORS, CO-WORKERS OR FAMILY
[000:00:59;292] MEMBERS OF THE SUSPECTS.
[000:01:00;660] IT MAY BE DIFFICULT BUT THE
[000:01:01;795] NATION IS COUNTING ON THOSE WITH
[000:01:04;130] INFORMATION TO COME FORWARD AND
[000:01:04;864] PROVIDE IT TO US.
[000:01:05;498] >> Reporter: AS FOR THE BOMBS
[000:01:08;935] THEMSELVES INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE
[000:01:10;336] BOTH WERE LIKELY DETONATED BY
[000:01:11;337] ELECTRONIC REMOTE CONTROLS.
[000:01:12;972] FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN
[000:01:14;307] CANVASSING HOBBY STORES IN THE
[000:01:15;742] BOSTON AREA ASKING ABOUT RECENT
[000:01:17;744] PURCHASES OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED
[000:01:18;478] DEVICES.
[000:01:20;280] THE FBI'S HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE
[000:01:22;148] WILL SEARCH THEIR MEMORIES TO
[000:01:23;416] SEE IF THEY CAN SHED LIGHT ON
[000:01:24;851] WHAT'S NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT
[000:01:25;552] QUESTION.
[000:01:27;720] WHO ARE THESE TWO MEN?
[000:01:28;288] BRIAN?
[000:01:31;324] >> SO, PETE, THE VIDEO AND
[000:01:33;326] STILLS HAVE ONLY BEEN IN OUR
[000:01:34;661] HANDS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR NOW.
[000:01:35;795] LOOKING AT IT, WHAT CAN WE GLEAN
[000:01:36;930] FROM PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, POSSIBLE
[000:01:38;064] RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO
[000:01:39;232] MEN?
[000:01:40;033] I HAVE LOOKED AT THE WEB
[000:01:41;334] TONIGHT.
[000:01:41;768] THERE IS ALREADY A SLEW OF
[000:01:42;769] THEORIES AS TO WHAT THE
[000:01:44;771] ICONOGRAPHY IS ON BOTH HATS.
[000:01:46;873] LEADING THEORY IS IT'S A
[000:01:48;174] BRIDGESTONE GOLF LOGO ON THE
[000:01:50;310] DARKER OF THE TWO.
[000:01:52;278] WHAT CAN BE LEARNED?
[000:01:55;615] >> Reporter: AS FOR THE
[000:01:57;317] BRIDGESTONE LOGO, THAT'S WHAT WE
[000:02:00;253] ARE TOLD BY FEDERAL
[000:02:01;788] INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE SEEN
[000:02:02;655] THESE PICTURES FOR A WHILE BASED
[000:02:04;557] ON THEIR OWN ANALYSIS.
[000:02:06;126] ONE THING THE FBI SAID TONIGHT
[000:02:06;860] IS THAT THIS IS IN ESSENCE A
[000:02:07;560] STARTER SET OF PHOTOS.
[000:02:08;128] THEY HOPE TO KEEP LOOKING
[000:02:09;362] THROUGH THE PICTURES AND AS THEY
[000:02:10;797] COME UP WITH PICTURES THAT SHOW
[000:02:11;931] PERHAPS BETTER VIEWS AND BETTER
[000:02:13;199] RESOLUTION, THEY WILL RELEASE
[000:02:14;334] THOSE, TOO.
[000:02:14;767] THIS ISN'T IT.
[000:02:17;470] THEY HOPE TO HAVE MORE.
[000:02:19;305] >> AFTER ALL THE TALK ABOUT ALL
[000:02:21;574] THE GOOD DIGITAL IMAGES OF THE
[000:02:23;776] FINISH LINE, THE VIDEO THAT'S
[000:02:25;178] BEEN RELEASED IS SO FAR PRETTY
[000:02:27;413] STANDARD SURVEILLANCE CAMERA,
[000:02:28;681] BUILDING-MOUNTED.
[000:02:30;817] >> Reporter: RIGHT.
[000:02:32;552] HIGHEST QUALITY IN ONE SENSE AND
[000:02:33;953] ALSO A BIRD'S EYE VIEW.
[000:02:35;522] BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
[000:02:37;790] THE GROUND, THEIR VISIBILITY IS
[000:02:39;125] GOING TO BE LIMITED AS THE CROWD
[000:02:39;926] IN FRONT OF THEM BLOCKS THEIR
[000:02:40;627] VIEW.
[000:02:41;661] SECONDLY, IT'S THE SURVEILLANCE
[000:02:43;062] CAMERA THAT GIVES THEM THE
[000:02:44;898] STRATEGIC LOOK AT WHAT THESE MEN
[000:02:45;632] WERE DOING.
[000:02:46;933] IT'S MOTION VIDEO SO THEY CAN
[000:02:48;034] WATCH THEIR MOVEMENTS.

[000:03:26;272] FEW HOURS BEFORE WE LEARNED OF

[000:03:28;007] WHETHER HE KNEW ABOUT THEM OR
[000:03:28;708] NOT IS UNCLEAR.

[000:26:53;378] IN FOR RAJ MATHAI.
[000:26:55;947] >> WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE FIRST
[000:26:58;283] LADY'S VISIT WITH THE LOCAL
[000:26:59;584] VICTIM ON THE ATTACK.
[000:27:00;485] >>> AND WE BEGIN WITH THE
[000:27:02;621] INVESTIGATION, FREE TIME OFF FOR
[000:27:03;955] THE SELECTIVE EMPLOYEES IN THE
[000:27:05;457] DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
[000:27:06;925] OUR INVESTIGATIVE UNIT FIRST
[000:27:08;627] BROKE THE STORY THIS MONTH.
[000:27:11;896] SANTA CLARA DISTRICT ATTORNEY
[000:27:12;530] JEFF ROSEN GIVING TIME OFF TO
[000:27:14;199] THE STAFF, TO MAKE UP FOR THE 5%
[000:27:17;736] BONUS CUT.
[000:27:18;436] >> WE HAVE JUST LEARNED COUNTY
[000:27:20;438] COUNCIL HAS ISSUED ITS OPINION
[000:27:22;273] ON THE LEGALITY OF THE DISTRICT
[000:27:24;442] ATTORNEY GIVING FREE TIME OFF.
[000:27:26;011] IT IS A CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT
[000:27:28;546] DELIVERED TO THE BOARD OF
[000:27:30;382] SUPERVISORS.
[000:27:30;682] THE SOURCES CLOSE TO THE
[000:27:32;917] COUNTY'S INVESTIGATION SAYS IT
[000:27:35;820] DOES NOT LOOK GOOD FOR THE DA.
[000:27:38;223] ONE PROBLEM IS HOW IT COULD OPEN
[000:27:40;025] UP FOR OTHERS IN A BIG WAY.
[000:27:43;094] OTHERS CALL IT THE ME-TOO
[000:27:46;464] CLAUSE.
[000:27:46;731] >> Reporter: LETTER AFTER
[000:27:47;298] LETTER.
[000:27:47;532] >> THERE IS A LOT OF ANIMOSITY
[000:27:50;568] TOWARDS MR. ROSEN RIGHT NOW.
[000:27:52;404] >> Reporter: DIFFERENT UNIONS,
[000:27:53;638] SAME CONCERNS.
[000:27:54;372] >> WE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING, A
[000:27:56;541] TRUST, AN AGREEMENT.
[000:28:00;045] A CONTRACT.
[000:28:01;246] AND WE DID NOT EXPEC TO BE
[000:28:03;081] SITTING HERE TODAY.
[000:28:03;748] >> Reporter: IT COMES AFTER OUR
[000:28:07;485] INVESTIGATION EXPOSES THE
[000:28:08;753] DISTRICT ATTORNEY, JEFF ROSEN,
[000:28:12;190] SUGGEST THAT TIME SHEETS BE
[000:28:13;324] ALTER
[000:28:13;825] ALTERED, ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO
[000:28:15;560] BANK VACATION AND SICK TIME
[000:28:19;097] WHICH THEY CAN LATER USE.
[000:28:20;165] HE MADE UP FOR A 5% BONUS CUT IN
[000:28:23;334] THE MIDDLE OF THE BUDGET CRISIS.
[000:28:24;703] >> SO YES, I BROUGHT IN
[000:28:26;304] ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE TO TRY TO
[000:28:28;373] COMPENSATE THEM IN SOME WAY FOR
[000:28:30;041] THAT.
[000:28:30;275] >> Reporter: THAT ANSWER WOULD
[000:28:30;909] BE A COSTLY ONE FOR THE COUNTY.
[000:28:32;444] >> IT IS A PUBLIC GIFT THAT THE
[000:28:34;946] PUBLIC DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE
[000:28:36;014] GIVING AWAY.
[000:28:36;981] >> Reporter: THE SANTA CLARA
[000:28:38;349] COUNTY PEACE OFFICER'S
[000:28:39;184] ASSOCIATION HAD TO MAKE DRASTIC
[000:28:41;186] CUTS TO HELP THE COUNTY.
[000:28:42;353] >> FOR US IT IS A HUGE SLAP IN
[000:28:44;923] THE CASE.
[000:28:45;323] >> Reporter: UNIONS ARE NOW
[000:28:47;192] POINTING TO THE ME-TOO CLAUSE IN
[000:28:49;260] THEIR COUNTY CONTRACTS.
[000:28:50;762] IT MEANS IF ONE COUNTY DIDN'T
[000:28:52;497] TAKE THE CUTS PROMISED, OTHERS
[000:28:54;299] DON'T HAVE TO EITHER.
[000:28:55;333] >> ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR MYSELF
[000:28:56;935] AND THE ASSOCIATION IS TO BE
[000:28:58;303] TREATED FAIRLY.
[000:28:58;870] THAT MEANS THAT THE COUNTY HAS
[000:29:00;538] TO COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON
[000:29:06;277] JEFF ROSEN AND WHAT HE IS DOING,
[000:29:06;911] IS TO GET THINGS CORRECTED AND
[000:29:07;545] THAT IT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN.
[000:29:08;546] >> BUT IF THE COUNTY IS NOT
[000:29:09;948] GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE HE IS
[000:29:11;516] AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THEN THEY
[000:29:13;017] HAVE NO OTHER MEANS OTHER THAN
[000:29:14;686] TO MAKE EVERYBODY WHOLE.
[000:29:16;488] WHICH MEANS FAIR SHARE FOR
[000:29:20;592] EVERYBODY ELSE.
[000:29:20;959] >> Reporter: SERGEANT DENNIS
[000:29:21;993] MOSER IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
[000:29:23;995] ASSOCIATION.
[000:29:24;329] >> BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ELECTED
[000:29:25;430] OFFICIAL DOESN'T PUT YOU ABOVE
[000:29:26;731] THE LAW.
[000:29:26;998] >> Reporter: OTHER UNIONS ARE
[000:29:28;666] ALSO DEMANDING ANSWERS.
[000:29:30;602] THE REGISTERED NURSE'S UNION
[000:29:33;238] SAYS THEY INTENTIONALLY VIOLATED
[000:29:35;373] THE AGREEMENTS.
[000:29:36;574] THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION
[000:29:37;976] TRADE WRITES IT IS WRONG
[000:29:43;481] REGARDING THE ASSOCIATION.
[000:29:44;616] OTHERS TALK ABOUT HOW IT COULD
[000:29:46;117] IMPACT THE BUDGET.
[000:29:46;818] >> IT IS VERY IMPORTANT HOW WE
[000:29:48;720] GET THE CONTRACTS BUTTONED UP
[000:29:50;722] AND THAT NOBODY DID SOMETHING
[000:29:51;823] LIKE THAT.
[000:29:52;323] >> Reporter: ROSEN STILL STANDS
[000:29:53;591] BY HIS DECISION, CALLING THE 5%
[000:29:56;261] BONUS CUT UNFAIR.
[000:29:57;395] >> THAT IS NOT FAIR TO P
