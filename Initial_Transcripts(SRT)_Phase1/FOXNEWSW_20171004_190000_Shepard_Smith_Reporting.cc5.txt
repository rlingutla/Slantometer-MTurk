[000:05:34;183] THEY WERE FULL THE NIGHT THAT IT
[000:05:36;252] HAPPENED BEFORE IT HAPPENED.
[000:05:37;720] AND THEY FOUND ROOM FOR MANY

[000:06:00;243] AREA WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE
[000:06:02;178] MEDICAL COMMUNITY PITCHED IN.
[000:06:03;713] THEIR STORIES OF PEDIATRIC
[000:06:05;448] SURGEONS OPERATING ON ADULTING,
[000:06:08;351] OB-GYNS THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT
[000:06:09;852] IN THE TRAUMA CENTER MANNING THE

[000:06:12;655] SO MANY PEOPLE COMING IN, SHEP,
[000:06:15;558] THAT IT WAS JUST KIND OF FULL TO
[000:06:18;761] OVERFLOWING.

[000:06:37;647] CIVILIANS, SOME OF WHO GAVE
[000:06:38;581] THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT OTHER
[000:06:39;816] PEOPLE AND STORIES OF PEOPLE
[000:06:42;518] GRABBING PICKUPS OFF OF THE
[000:06:44;854] STREETS, FILLING THE BEDS WITH
[000:06:46;823] THE WOUNDED AND TAKING THEM TO
[000:06:48;558] THE HOSPITAL.
[000:06:49;725] A LOT OF PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:51;494] WANTS TO THANK.
[000:06:52;361] >> Shepard: AND JOHN, HE GOT A
[000:06:54;263] QUESTION ABOUT GUN CONTROL AFTER
[000:06:55;531] DOING THAT.
[000:06:56;265] >> HE DID.
[000:07:00;703] THE PRESIDENT HAS RECEIVED A
[000:07:01;437] NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT GUN
[000:07:02;205] CONTROL.
[000:07:02;538] HE GOT A COUPLE FROM YESTERDAY.
[000:07:05;942] THE PRESIDENT DEFERRING THE TALK
[000:07:07;110] OF THE DISCUSSION OF GUN CONTROL
[000:07:08;544] FOR THE MOMENT.
[000:07:09;545] HE SAID THERE WILL BE TIME FOR
[000:07:12;715] THAT.
[000:07:13;015] NOT NOW.
[000:07:13;382] I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SILENCER
[000:07:16;219] BILL THAT APPEARED TO BE
[000:07:17;553] SHELVED.
[000:07:18;020] HE SAID WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
[000:07:20;123] LATER.
[000:07:20;423] A LOT OF TALK FOR THE NEED FOR
[000:07:22;391] MORE GUN CONTROL.
[000:07:23;192] DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING THAT.
[000:07:24;427] SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE
[000:07:25;728] REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT ARE SAYING,
[000:07:27;396] WE DON'T NEED MORE GUN CONTROL
[000:07:28;998] MEASURES.
[000:07:33;369] THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE SO-CALLED
[000:07:34;203] BUMP OR SLIDE STOCKS THAT THE
[000:07:34;937] SHOOTER HAD INSTALLED ON A FEW
[000:07:36;939] RIFLES, MIGHT AS BE AS MANY AS
[000:07:39;208] 12, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO FIRE A
[000:07:43;179] SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE AT ALMOST
[000:07:45;481] AUTOMATIC SPEED.
[000:07:46;115] THESE WERE THINGS APPROVED IN
[000:07:47;850] 2010 BY THE ATF DURING THE OBAMA
[000:07:50;553] ADMINISTRATION.
[000:07:51;020] NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN CORNYN
[000:07:53;156] SAYING MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT
[000:07:56;058] BANNING THESE.
[000:07:56;526] NEWT GINGRICH WAS ON THE AIR,
[000:07:59;295] MAYBE YOU LUMP THEM IN WITH THE
[000:08:06;369] 1934 LAW THAT BANS AUTOMATIC
[000:08:07;103] WEAPONS BY CIVILIANS.
[000:08:09;238] TOM COLE ON ANOTHER NETWORK
[000:08:11;073] SAID, THIS.
[000:08:11;474] >> NO QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK
[000:08:12;942] INTO THAT.
[000:08:13;509] AUTOMATIC WEAPONSES -- WHEN I
[000:08:15;311] SAW THE CLIPS AND HEARD THE
[000:08:17;046] FIRE, I ASSUMED HE HAD AN
[000:08:18;915] AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
[000:08:19;815] I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS
[000:08:22;718] TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE THAT CHEAPLY
[000:08:23;786] OF TRANSFORMING A SEMIAUTOMATIC
[000:08:26;189] INTO AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
[000:08:28;424] YEAH, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
[000:08:30;459] QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT
[000:08:32;795] THAT.
[000:08:33;296] >> EVEN REPUBLICANS ARE
[000:08:55;384] DESCRIBING THIS AS A LOOP HOLE,
[000:08:56;185] ONE THAT THEY CAN CLOSE QUICKLY.
[000:08:56;919] DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE LIKE JOHN
[000:08:57;587] LEWIS OUT THERE ON THE STEPS OF
[000:08:58;321] THE CAPITOL SAYING HOW MANY MORE
[000:08:59;055] PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED
[000:08:59;755] BEFORE WE GET MORE GUN CONTROL
[000:09:00;489] MEASURES?
[000:09:00;856] THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A
[000:09:01;591] CLASH IN CONGRESS OVER HOW FAR
[000:09:02;325] TO GO IN THE WAKE OF THIS
[000:09:02;959] INCIDENTS.
[000:09:03;326] AGAIN, SHEP, THE PRESIDENT
[000:09:03;993] SAYING LET'S MOURN THE DEAD,
[000:09:04;694] TEND TO THE BOUNDED AND THEN
[000:09:05;394] LET'S HAVE THE POLITICAL
[000:09:06;028] DISCUSSION, SHEP.
[000:09:06;529] >> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE IN
[000:09:07;263] MANDALAY BAY.
[000:09:07;697] THANK YOU.
[000:09:08;064] THE SECRETARY OF STATE REX
[000:09:08;731] TILLERSON IS NOT DENYING THAT HE
[000:09:09;465] CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP A
[000:09:11;500] BLANKING MORON.
[000:09:12;001] THE SECRETARY IS INSISTING THAT
[000:09:12;868] HE NEVER THREATENED TO QUIT.
[000:09:13;569] HE'S RESPONDING TO AN NBC NEWS
[000:09:14;337] REPORT THAT MIKE PENCE HAD TO
[000:09:15;972] CONVINCE SECRETARY TILLERSON NOT
[000:09:17;773] TO STEP DOWN.
[000:09:18;574] >> THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER
[000:09:19;775] HAD TO PERSUADE ME TO REMAIN THE
[000:09:23;412] SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE I
[000:09:24;180] HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED LEAVING
[000:09:25;548] THIS POST.
[000:09:27;016] I'M NEW TO WASHINGTON.
[000:09:28;851] I HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE'S SOME
[000:09:30;987] THAT TRY TO SOW DISSENSION TO
[000:09:33;656] ADVANCE THEIR OWN AGENDA BY
[000:09:35;057] TEARING OTHERS APART AND AN
[000:09:37;760] UNDERSTOOD TO UNDERMINE THE
[000:09:55;911] PRESIDENT'S OWN AGENDA.
[000:09:56;545] I DO NOT AND I WILL NOT OPERATE
[000:09:57;313] THAT WAY.
[000:09:57;680] >> WHEN A REPORTER ASKED
[000:09:58;314] SPECIFICALLY WHETHER SECRETARY
[000:09:59;048] TILLERSON CALLED THE PRESIDENT A
[000:09:59;782] MORON, HE RESPONDED THAT HE
[000:10:00;449] WASN'T GOING TO DEAL WITH PETTY
[000:10:01;183] STUFF LIKE THAT.
[000:10:01;651] RICH EDSON IS AT THE STATE
[000:10:02;318] DEPARTMENT.

[000:10:03;586] HEATHER NAUERT HAS COME FORWARD
[000:10:04;320] TO DENY THAT CLAIM.
[000:10:04;854] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:10:05;354] THE DAILY PRESS BRIEFING JUST
[000:10:07;857] WRAPPED UP.
[000:10:08;791] HEATHER DENIED THAT THE
[000:10:10;092] SECRETARY OF STATE CALLED THE
[000:10:12;361] PRESIDENT A MORON.
[000:10:17;266] >> THE SECRETARY DOES NOT USE
[000:10:18;000] THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE.
[000:10:18;834] THE SECRETARY DID NOT USE THAT
[000:10:20;403] TYPE OF LANGUAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT
[000:10:22;538] THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[000:10:23;739] STATES.
[000:10:24;140] HE DOES NOT USE THAT LANGUAGE TO
[000:10:25;675] SPEAK ABOUT ANYONE.
[000:10:26;575] I HOPE THAT THAT CLARIFIES IT.
[000:10:28;277] >> HE NEVER SAID THAT?
[000:10:29;812] >> HE DID NOT SAY THAT.
[000:10:31;514] >> Shepard: SO THERE YOU HAVE
[000:10:33;649] IT.
[000:10:33;916] THE PRESIDENT NOW LIVE WITH
[000:10:34;817] FIRST RESPONDERS.
[000:10:36;319] WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.
[000:10:39;021] LET'S LISTEN LIVE.

[000:10:44;727] ARE GOOD BUT YOU PROVED IT.
[000:10:50;666] HE'S A SICK, DEMENTED MAN.
[000:10:51;400] HAVE THEY FOUND OUT ANYTHING
[000:10:52;802] ELSE?
[000:10:53;102] >> STILL A LITTLE BIT SOON.
[000:10:54;537] WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD LEADS.
[000:10:57;773] WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH
[000:10:59;342] THAT.
[000:10:59;642] WE'RE GOING TO GET THE ANSWERS.
[000:11:02;311] >> MIGHT BE SOMEBODY THERE.
[000:11:03;846] THE WIRES ARE SCREWED UP.
[000:11:06;549] MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE.
[000:11:07;416] I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO
[000:11:09;118] YOUR GROUP.
[000:11:09;618] I WANTED TO SAY HELLO AND
[000:11:12;555] CONGRATULATE YOU.
[000:11:13;356] I WAS A FAN BEFORE THIS.
[000:11:14;690] YOU KNOW THAT.
[000:11:15;825] EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS
[000:11:18;894] THAT.
[000:11:19;195] A BIG FAN BEFORE THIS.
[000:11:23;733] YOU CAN BE MORE OF A FAN, I'M
[000:11:24;467] MORE OF A FAN NOW.
[000:11:25;000] YOU SHOWED THE WORLD AROUND THE
[000:11:25;801] WORLD WAS WATCHING AND YOU
[000:11:27;069] SHOWED WHAT PROFESSIONALISM IS
[000:11:30;272] ALL ABOUT.
[000:11:32;141] SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN TAKE
[000:11:33;509] PLACE FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND
[000:11:35;344] HOURS.
[000:11:36;212] YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
[000:11:39;348] YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.
[000:11:41;250] >> A MATTER OF IDENTIFICATION,
[000:11:43;185] OFFICER HANCOCK AT THE END TO
[000:11:45;020] YOUR RIGHT THERE, HE WAS THE
[000:11:47;089] FIRST SWAT OFFICER TO ENGAGE THE
[000:11:50;459] INDIVIDUAL.
[000:11:50;960] OFFICER DRISCOLL THERE, THE K-9
[000:11:56;365] OFFICER ASSISTED.
[000:11:58;434] OFFICER MORRIS WAS ONE OF THE
[000:12:00;369] TWO I DESCRIBED PARTNERED WITH
[000:12:03;939] THE SECURITY GUARDS.
[000:12:05;808] >> THEY DID A GOOD JOB.
[000:12:07;376] YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
[000:12:08;711] HIS OPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO
[000:12:11;080] IT HIMSELF.
[000:12:12;214] IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU WOULDN'T
[000:12:13;649] HAVE HAD THE INFORMATION MAYBE,
[000:12:15;050] RIGHT?
[000:12:15;351] HE DID THE RIGHT THING?
[000:12:16;819] >> HE DID.
[000:12:18;888] WE RELIED ON THE INFORMATION.
[000:12:20;523] >> THAT'S GREAT.
[000:12:22;024] >> EVERYONE ELSE SEATED IN AND
[000:12:25;561] BEHIND THE PRESS THERE WERE
[000:12:27;129] INTEGRAL IN SAVING NUMEROUS
[000:12:28;931] LIVES.
[000:12:29;298] THE GENTLEMAN TO YOUR LEFT, THAT
[000:12:31;167] FIREFIGHTER RIGHT THERE WAS OFF
[000:12:34;036] DUTY WATCHING THE CONCERT AND
[000:12:37;873] SAVED SEVERAL LIVES.
[000:12:40;009] IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW
[000:12:41;644] THAT EVERY PERSON IN HERE WAS
[000:12:45;181] INSTRUMENTAL IN LIFE SAVING
[000:12:49;518] MEASURES.
[000:12:49;885] THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES HERE ARE
[000:12:52;455] DISPATCHERS.
[000:12:53;055] PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
[000:12:53;823] PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.
[000:12:54;990] IF YOU EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
[000:12:56;292] TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO TRAFFIC,
[000:13:02;064] THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES ARE
[000:13:02;765] AMAZING.
[000:13:03;098] THERE WAS A THIRD YOUNG LADY.
[000:13:03;833] SHE DECIDED TO GO TO COLLEGE.
[000:13:05;000] >> Shepard: PARDON THE
[000:13:07;870] INTERVENTION WHILE OUR FOX
[000:13:09;605] TELEVISION STATIONS JOIN US.
[000:13:11;373] GOOD AFTERNOON FROM FOX NEWS IN

[000:13:14;977] OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE

[000:13:38;801] WHITE HOUSE POOL HAS WALKED OUT.
[000:13:39;602] THE PRESIDENT SHARING

[000:13:41;570] FIRST RESPONDERS.
[000:13:43;639] OUR AUDIENCE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL
[000:13:46;175] JUST A MOMENT AGO MET THE FIRST
[000:13:48;177] POLICE OFFICERS CREDITED WITH
[000:13:49;578] ENGAGING THE SUSPECT INSIDE THE
[000:13:52;815] ROOM.
[000:13:53;315] WE'VE HEARD THE 911 CALLS, THE
[000:13:55;985] DIFFERENT POLICE RESPONDERS, THE
[000:13:59;355] DISPATCH FROM POLICE
[000:13:59;955] HEADQUARTE
[000:14:10;432] HEADQUARTERS.
[000:14:10;866] IT'S BEEN A VERY GOOD DAY FOR
[000:14:11;634] THANK YOUS TO THE FIRST
[000:14:12;234] RESPONDERS AND EVERYDAY FOLKS
[000:14:13;669] THAT HELPED OUTSIDE THE LUXOR
[000:14:14;403] AND MANDALAY BAY ON THE
[000:14:15;070] LAS VEGAS STRIP.
[000:14:16;038] WE'RE WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT
[000:14:17;306] TO APPEAR AGAIN IN JUST A
[000:14:18;974] MOMENT.
[000:14:19;308] THAT WAS SORT OF AN UNSCHEDULED
[000:14:21;310] PHOTO OP, MEET AND GREET WITH
[000:14:22;811] SOME OF THE FIRST RESPONDER
[000:14:24;380] THERE'S.
[000:14:24;747] YOU CAN SEE A LIVE LOOK NOW IN
[000:14:26;782] LAS VEGAS AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS
[000:14:28;083] WHERE THE PRESIDENT WILL BE
[000:14:29;418] MEETING WITH -- AND THE FIRST
[000:14:31;687] LADY TO MEET WITH FIRST
[000:14:33;355] RESPONDERS AND HEROS OF THE
[000:14:35;424] ATTACK IN JUST A MOMENT.
[000:14:36;158] JOHN ROBERTS FOLLOWING ALONG
[000:14:40;896] WITH THE PRESIDENT OUT IN
[000:14:41;564] LAS VEGAS TODAY.
[000:14:42;031] THEY HAVE MADE A REAL EFFORT,
[000:14:42;831] JOHN, TO PUT THESE HEROS OF THIS
[000:14:45;200] TRAGEDY FRONT AND CENTER AND
[000:14:46;936] THESE MEET AND GREETS.
[000:14:48;604] FOR THOSE JOINING US ON FOX
[000:14:50;239] TELEVISION STATIONS, HE GAVE AN
[000:14:52;207] INVITATION TO THOSE IN THE
[000:14:53;609] HOSPITAL ROOMS, THE O.R.s.
[000:14:55;077] IF YOU'RE EVER IN WASHINGTON
[000:14:56;245] D.C., COME SEE ME AT THE WHITE
[000:14:57;680] HOUSE.
[000:14:57;980] I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.
[000:14:59;014] A CONCERTED EFFORT ON THE PART
[000:15:00;583] OF THIS WHITE HOUSE.
[000:15:02;217] GREAT TO SEE.
[000:15:03;052] >> ALL THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN AND
[000:15:05;120] AS PRESIDENT, SHEP, PRESIDENT
[000:15:06;689] TRUMP REALLY WAS A CHAMPION OF
[000:15:32;748] LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[000:15:33;248] SO MANY CAMPAIGNED EVENTS ACROSS
[000:15:34;016] THE COUNTRY, HE WOULD ALWAYS
[000:15:34;717] HOLD THEM UP FOR PRAISE.
[000:15:35;317] HE'S DONE THAT AGAIN AS
[000:15:35;918] PRESIDENT.
[000:15:36;285] ANY TIME HE GETS IN THE SAME
[000:15:36;986] ROOM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR
[000:15:37;686] MILITARY FOR THAT MATTER, HE
[000:15:38;387] ALWAYS HAS THE HIGHEST PRAISE.
[000:15:39;088] I KNOW THAT HE WAS VERY TAKEN,
[000:15:39;822] NOT ONLY WITH THE SCOPE AND THE
[000:15:40;556] DEPTH OF THIS TRAGEDY AND THE
[000:15:41;256] HORRIBLE FACT THAT SO MANY
[000:15:41;924] PEOPLE WERE KILLED.
[000:15:42;458] WHEN THERE WERE BULLETS RAINING
[000:15:43;192] DOWN FROM THE WINDOWS BEHIND ME,
[000:15:43;926] 50, 75 AT A TIME BECAUSE HE HAD
[000:15:46;729] BIG MAGAZINES, THE OFFICERS TOOK
[000:15:49;798] COVER BUT MOVED TOWARD THE
[000:15:51;867] DANGER.
[000:15:52;468] THEY WERE BLOWING THE DOOR OPEN
[000:15:53;669] WITHIN MINUTES TO GET INSIDE AND
[000:15:55;938] CLEARLY HAD CORNERED THIS GUY,
[000:15:57;573] THE SHOOTER.
[000:15:58;507] HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE WHEN HE
[000:15:59;942] KNEW THEY WERE COMING IN THROUGH
[000:16:01;010] THE DOOR.
[000:16:01;710] THE FACT THAT AS YOU POINTED
[000:16:03;545] OUT, SO MANY CIVILIANS DOVE ON
[000:16:08;784] THEIR LOVED ONES OR SACRIFICED
[000:16:11;654] THEIR OWN LIVES OR STOLE PICKUP
[000:16:19;161] TRUCKS TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE BEDS
[000:16:19;995] BECAUSE THE AMBULANCES WERE SO
[000:16:20;763] OVERWHELMED.
[000:16:21;163] WHEN THEY GOT TO THE HOSPITALS,
[000:16:22;031] THE DOCTORS AND NURSES ON STAFF
[000:16:23;265] AND ALL OF THE MEDICAL STAFF
[000:16:24;633] FROM ACROSS THE VALLEY HERE THAT
[000:16:26;735] CAME IN TO THE TRAUMA CENTERS
[000:16:28;937] AND THE HOSPITALS EVEN THOUGH
[000:16:30;572] THEY WERE OFF DUTY.
[000:16:31;640] JUST DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO PICK UP
[000:16:33;208] THE PHONE.
[000:16:34;410] RAN IN TO HELP WHEN THE SCOPE
[000:16:36;645] BECAME CLEAR.
[000:16:37;346] THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO TAKE
[000:16:38;480] TIME TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THOSE
[000:16:40;749] PEOPLE.
[000:16:41;216] HE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE DONE AN
[000:16:42;918] INCREDIBLE SERVICE FOR THEIR
[000:16:44;420] COMMUNITY.
[000:16:44;787] IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE WANTS TO
[000:16:46;789] HOLD UP AS AN EXAMPLE NOT ONLY
[000:16:52;027] TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT
[000:16:52;828] THE WORLD AS WELL TO SAY THIS IS
[000:16:53;595] HOW WE RESPOND TO TRAGEDY IN
[000:16:54;363] AMERICA AND HOPEFULLY TAKE STEPS
[000:16:55;631] TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
[000:16:56;765] NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.
[000:16:57;766] THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET
[000:16:59;301] INTO A REAL TUSSLE OF A DEBATE
[000:17:01;336] IN CAPITOL HILL.
[000:17:02;471] THERE'S GOING TO BE PEOPLE ON
[000:17:03;906] ONE SAID THAT SAY WE NEED MORE
[000:17:05;174] GUN CONTROL MEASURES, PEOPLE ON
[000:17:07;376] THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS THERE'S
[000:17:09;078] SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT
[000:17:12;314] THESE SO-CALLED PUMP STOCKS OR
[000:17:15;284] SLIDE STOCKS THAT ALLOW
[000:17:16;852] SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO BE
[000:17:18;387] FIRED AT A HIGH RATE OR OTHER
[000:17:24;326] MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO STOP
[000:17:25;127] PEOPLE FROM CONVERTING THESE WE
[000:17:25;894] POPS INTO A HIGH RATE OF FIRE.
[000:17:26;695] WE DON'T NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN
[000:17:28;263] THAT.
[000:17:29;865] WE NEED TO ENFORCE EXISTING
[000:17:33;702] LAWS.
[000:17:34;803] EVERYTHING THAT THIS FELLOW
[000:17:35;671] SEEMED TO DO SHORT OF WHAT HE
[000:17:37;706] DID SUNDAY NIGHT WAS WITHIN THE
[000:17:39;675] LETTER OF THE LAW.
[000:17:40;876] IT'S A DILEMMA HOW THAT DEBATE
[000:17:42;945] WILL GO FORWARD AS TO WHAT LAW
[000:17:46;181] COULD BE CRAFTED TO STOP WHAT
[000:17:47;816] HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT.
[000:17:48;717] ALL OF THIS STUFF IS
[000:17:50;519] RETROSPECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO
[000:17:52;921] PROSPECTIVE.
[000:17:57;326] YOU'RE ALWAYS REACTING TO THE
[000:17:58;093] LAST INCIDENT.
[000:17:58;560] IT'S DIFFICULT AND A HEATED
[000:17:59;261] DEBATE GOING FORWARD, SHEP.
[000:18:00;796] >> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN.
[000:18:06;468] LET'S GO TO A.B. STODDARD.
[000:18:08;871] GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:18:10;005] >> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP.
[000:18:11;406] >> Shepard: THIS DEBATE WILL
[000:18:12;474] COME, THOSE ON THE GUN CONTROL
[000:18:15;511] SIDE, ARE PUSHING FOR IT TODAY.
[000:18:19;548] THEIR ARGUMENT IS THERE'S NO
[000:18:20;549] TIME LIKE ON THE HEELS OF A
[000:18:22;584] TRAGEDY TO KEEP ANOTHER TRAGEDY
[000:18:23;952] FROM HAPPENING.
[000:18:24;520] THAT'S THEIR POSITION.
[000:18:25;554] >> THEY'RE MAKING AN ARGUMENT
[000:18:30;626] THAT IS REASONABLE THAT THE TIME
[000:18:31;426] TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS
[000:18:32;127] WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND VICTIMS
[000:18:32;828] FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND WANT
[000:18:34;296] SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.
[000:18:35;631] IF THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK,
[000:18:37;432] WE TALK ABOUT WAYS TO KEEP THE
[000:18:40;636] HOMELAND SAFE FROM TERRORISTS.
[000:18:42;104] SO GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES TALK
[000:18:44;606] ABOUT THE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN
[000:18:46;241] SHOW LOOP HOLE AND LOOK AT THE
[000:18:49;344] ACCESSORIES LIKE THE BUMP STOP
[000:18:52;781] MECHANISM TO MAKE A
[000:18:55;250] SEMIAUTOMATIC TO AN AUTOMATIC
[000:19:06;428] WEAPON.
[000:19:06;762] I THINK IT'S INTERESTING IN THIS
[000:19:07;563] INCREDIBLY POLARIZED TIME, SHEP,
[000:19:08;330] WITH THIS DEBATE THAT NEVER GOES
[000:19:09;064] ANYWHERE, THAT THERE'S SOME
[000:19:09;731] REPUBLICANS WILLING TO LOOK
[000:19:10;432] AT -- YOU PLAYED CLIPS FROM TOM
[000:19:13;135] COLE, THE REPUBLICAN, REPORTS
[000:19:15;037] THAT SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, THE
[000:19:16;538] NUMBER 2 IN LEADERSHIP ON THE
[000:19:18;173] SENATE SIDE IS INTERESTED.
[000:19:20;709] I READ THAT CONGRESSMAN BILL
[000:19:22;144] FLORES FROM TEXAS IS INTERESTED
[000:19:24;012] IN IT.
[000:19:24;746] SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME
[000:19:27;349] INCREMENTAL PATH FORWARD TO SOME
[000:19:29;985] KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING
[000:19:32;254] TO DO THIS KIND OF WEAPONRY
[000:19:34;523] WHERE 800 ROUNDS CAN GO OFF IN A
[000:19:37;092] MINUTE AND KILL SO MANY
[000:19:38;527] PEOPLING.
[000:19:39;061] GENERALLY SPEAKING, I'LL BE
[000:19:40;829] SURPRISED IF IT DOES BECAUSE
[000:19:41;797] THEY BREAK DOWN SO QUICKLY IN
[000:19:44;199] ALL OF THIS POLARIZING AND ALL
[000:19:45;901] OF THE DIFFERENCES AND IF DEBATE
[000:19:47;536] GOES NOWHERE BECAUSE OF THE
[000:19:48;770] VOTES AND THE WAY THEY'RE SET UP
[000:19:51;807] IN CONGRESS NOW.
[000:19:53;508] >> Shepard: ALL RIGHT, A.B.
[000:19:55;177] STODDARD LIVE FROM WASHINGTON.
[000:19:56;745] GREAT TO SEE YOU.
[000:19:57;679] WE'RE WATCHING ANOTHER LIVE
[000:19:58;714] EVENT AS WELL.
[000:19:59;581] THE PRESIDENT ABOUT TO COME INTO

[000:20:02;885] WITH ANOTHER SET OF FIRST
[000:20:04;686] RESPONDERS.
[000:20:10;459] THIS IS THE THIRD SET WE'VE SEEN
[000:20:11;226] ON CAMERA.
[000:20:11;593] FOLKS SITTING AROUND, WAITING TO
[000:20:12;327] MEET THE PRESIDENT,
[000:20:12;861] COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AS HE MAKES
[000:20:14;529] THE ROUNDS THERE IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:20:15;264] WE'LL HAVE COVERAGE OF THAT ON
[000:20:15;998] FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:20:16;498] THOSE OF YOU WATCHING ON FOX

[000:20:18;533] NATION, MUCH MORE ON THIS A

[000:20:25;173] I'M SHEPARD SMITH.

[000:20:29;244] AS WE CONTINUE HERE ON FOX NEWS
[000:20:30;846] CHANNEL, WE'RE WAITING FOR THESE
[000:20:32;014] FIRST RESPONDERS TO MEET WITH
[000:20:33;448] THE PRESIDENT AND WE'LL HAVE
[000:20:34;516] THAT LIVE FOR YOU IN JUST A
[000:20:35;851] MOMENT.
[000:20:36;184] TO MEET THE HEROS OF LAS VEGAS
[000:20:41;323] THIS HELPED SAVE LIVES DURING
[000:20:42;057] THE SHOOTING.
[000:20:42;491] FIRST, THE LATEST FROM THE
[000:20:43;358] INVESTIGATORS ON SCENE AND THE
[000:20:45;327] PICTURES NOW THAT SHOW THE
[000:20:47;663] INSIDE OF THE MURDER'S SWEET.
[000:20:52;868] THAT'S COMING UP ON THE FOX NEWS
[000:20:53;869] DECK THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:20:58;373] I was always
[000:20:58;373] "the girl with psoriasis."
[000:21:01;610] People don't stare anymore.
[000:21:03;145] I never joined in.
[000:21:05;247] That wasn't fair to any of us.
[000:21:07;316] I was covered.
[000:21:08;517] I tried lots of things
[000:21:08;517] over the years.
[000:21:10;786] But I didn't give up.
[000:21:12;120] I kept on fighting.
[000:21:13;722] I found something that worked.
[000:21:15;424] That still works.
[000:21:16;892] Now?
[000:21:17;759] SEE ME.
[000:21:18;593] SEE ME.
[000:21:19;795] I found clear skin that lasts.
[000:21:21;530] See if COSENTYX could make a
[000:21:21;530] difference for you-
[000:21:23;932] COSENTYX is proven to help
[000:21:23;932] people with moderate
[000:21:26;068] to severe plaque psoriasis...
[000:21:27;502] ...find clear skin that
[000:21:27;502] can last.
[000:21:29;805] Don't use if you're allergic
[000:21:29;805] to COSENTYX.
[000:21:31;673] Before starting COSENTYX,
[000:21:32;808] you should be checked
[000:21:32;808] for tuberculosis.
[000:21:34;576] An increased risk of infections
[000:21:34;576] and lowered ability
[000:21:36;678] to fight them may occur.

[000:24:14;870] OF THE MASSACRE AND FIRST
[000:24:16;471] RESPONDERS AND ORDINARY PEOPLE
[000:24:18;106] THAT HELPED AFTER THE SHOOTING
[000:24:20;008] STARTED.
[000:24:20;542] EARLIER, THE PRESIDENT AND THE
[000:24:21;843] FIRST LADY MET VICTIMS AND MED
[000:24:23;512] CAT WORKERS AT A HOSPITAL IN
[000:24:26;114] LAS VEGAS.
[000:24:26;648] LET'S LISTEN.
[000:24:27;682] WE'LL HAVE -- WELL, I THOUGHT WE
[000:24:29;584] WOULD LISTEN TO SOUND FROM THAT
[000:24:31;086] TIME.
[000:24:31;520] APPARENTLY NOT.
[000:24:32;087] WHEN THIS BEGINS, WE'LL TAKE YOU
[000:24:35;357] THERE.
[000:24:35;690] THE LAS VEGAS GUNMAN ENCOURAGED
[000:24:38;160] HIS GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY,
[000:24:39;494] TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR THE
[000:24:41;196] MASSACRE.
[000:24:41;563] THAT'S WHAT DANLEY'S SISTER TOLD
[000:24:43;298] A TV SISTER IN AUSTRALIA.
[000:24:45;600] HE SENT HER AWAY AT ONE POINT.
[000:24:47;702] THEY SAY THE MURDERER BROUGHT
[000:24:49;638] DANLEY A PLANE TICKET TO THE
[000:24:51;740] PHILIPPINES SO SHE WOULDN'T GET
[000:24:52;674] IN THE WAY OF HIS PLANS.
[000:24:54;776] WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THEY KNOW
[000:24:56;344] THAT.
[000:24:56;645] THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL US.
[000:24:58;046] IN THE INTERVIEW, THEIR FACES
[000:24:59;514] ARE BLURRED TO PROTECT THEIR
[000:25:04;953] IDENTITIES.
[000:25:05;353] HERE, LOOK.
[000:25:05;787] >> I KNOW THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW
[000:25:07;155] ANYTHING AS WELL LIKE US.
[000:25:08;924] SHE WAS SENT AWAY.
[000:25:11;593] SHE WAS SENT AWAY SO THAT SHE
[000:25:16;665] WOULD NOT BE THERE.
[000:25:18;066] >> Shepard: WE DON'T KNOW IF
[000:25:19;267] THEY KNOW THAT OR IF SHE'S
[000:25:21;036] SPECULATING ON THAT MATTER.
[000:25:23;171] INVESTIGATORS QUESTIONING DANLEY
[000:25:24;606] RIGHT NOW WE'RE TOLD THE FBI
[000:25:27;576] HEADQUARTERS IN LOS ANGELES SAY
[000:25:28;677] THEY HOPE SHE CAN GIVE THEM ANY
[000:25:30;612] CLUES ABOUT WHAT DROVE PADDOCK
[000:25:32;681] TO COMMIT MASS MURDER.
[000:25:36;318] TRACE GALLAGHER ON THE CASE IN
[000:25:37;052] LAS VEGAS.
[000:25:37;419] LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
[000:25:38;086] SHOOTER'S ARSENAL TODAY, TRACE.
[000:25:40;155] >> THEY RECOVERED SOME 47
[000:25:41;690] WEAPONS FROM THREE LOCATIONS.
[000:25:42;824] ONE FROM THE MANDALAY BAY BEHIND
[000:25:43;959] ME AND HIS TWO HOMES, ONE IN
[000:25:46;161] MESQUITE, NEVADA AND THE OTHER
[000:25:47;329] ONE IN RENO, NEVADA.
[000:25:52;601] THOSE GUNS WORTH BETWEEN
[000:25:55;370] $100,000 AND $110,000.
[000:25:57;439] THE SEMIAUTOMATICS ARE WORTH
[000:26:01;576] BETWEEN $1,500 AND $3,000.
[000:26:03;912] THESE PICTURES ARE FROM THE
[000:26:05;447] DAILY MAIL.
[000:26:06;248] THEY WERE PUT ON THE FLOOR OF
[000:26:11;019] THE HOTEL SWEEP IN MANDALAY BAY.
[000:26:11;820] WE SHOULD KNOW THAT STEPHEN
[000:26:13;922] PADDOCK HAS BEEN COLLECTING GUNS
[000:26:15;090] FOR YEARS.
[000:26:15;690] BUT IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE, HE
[000:26:18;727] HAS AMASSED SOME 30-PLUS
[000:26:21;863] WEAPONS, A GUN SHOP OWNER IN
[000:26:23;231] MESQUITE WHERE HE HAD A HOME
[000:26:24;733] SAID THAT ON SEPTEMBER 28th,
[000:26:28;336] PADDOCK BOUGHT A WEAPON AND THAT
[000:26:29;971] IS THE SAME DAY THAT HE CHECKED
[000:26:33;008] IN TO THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL.
[000:26:34;709] LISTEN TO THE GUN SHOP OWNER.
[000:26:37;679] >> I WAS ILL.
[000:26:38;680] MADE ME ILL TO THINK THAT WE HAD
[000:26:43;752] INTERACTED WITH HIM AND HE
[000:26:44;586] COMMITTED A TRAGEDY.
[000:26:45;453] >> HE WENT ON THE SAY THAT HE
[000:26:48;290] DID NOT SELL STEPHEN PADDOCK ANY
[000:26:49;824] AMMUNITION OR ANY OF THOSE BUMP
[000:26:51;960] STOCKS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL
[000:26:52;894] DAY LONG.
[000:26:54;629] THAT'S WHAT KIND OF MAKES THE
[000:26:56;931] TRIGGER TURN INTO AUTOMATICALLY
[000:26:58;300] ENGAGED WEAPON, SHEP.
[000:26:59;934] HE ALSO POINTS OUT AND WE SHOULD
[000:27:02;671] POINT THIS OUT, THE REASON THE
[000:27:06;274] BUMP STOPS ARE LEGAL IN NEVADA
[000:27:09;077] IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY
[000:27:10;645] ALTER THE WEAPON.
[000:27:11;613] IT'S TAKEN ON AND TAKEN OFF.
[000:27:17;452] SO IT'S LEGAL NOW.
[000:27:17;986] >> Shepard: WHAT ELSE ARE WE
[000:27:18;687] LEARNING FROM INVESTIGATORS
[000:27:19;387] ABOUT THE GIRLFRIEND?
[000:27:19;988] >> WE KNOW THAT MARILOU DANLEY
[000:27:22;223] IS IN HER THIRD HOUR OF
[000:27:24;059] QUESTIONING IN LOS ANGELES.
[000:27:24;893] SHE FLEW IN TO LOS ANGELES FROM
[000:27:27;028] THE PHILIPPINES LAST NIGHT.
[000:27:30;231] THEY CLEARLY WANT INFORMATION
[000:27:31;499] ABOUT STEPHEN PADDOCK'S MENTAL
[000:27:32;934] STATE, HIS RELIGIOUS BELIEFS,
[000:27:34;469] HIS POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND
[000:27:36;204] ANYTHING THAT COULD LEAD THEM TO
[000:27:37;972] A POSSIBLE MOTIVE.
[000:27:38;940] THE BIG TICKET ITEM FOR A LOT OF
[000:27:41;409] INVESTIGATORS WHAT SHE KNEW
[000:27:42;277] ABOUT THIS ARSENAL OF WEAPONS
[000:27:44;479] AND HIS INTENT.
[000:27:49;517] REMEMBER, THEY FOUND DOZENS AND
[000:27:50;318] DOZENS OF WEAPONS INSIDE THE
[000:27:51;019] HOMES THAT SHE LIVED IN WITH HIM
[000:27:51;853] ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVES AND
[000:27:53;755] SUITCASES OF AMMUNITION.
[000:27:55;190] THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT
[000:27:56;591] SHE KNEW ABOUT THAT.
[000:27:58;560] HER FAMILY SAYS THAT THE REASON
[000:28:00;161] HE SENT HER TO THE PHILIPPINES
[000:28:01;796] IS BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT
[000:28:03;431] SHE WOULD STOP HIM FROM COMMITS
[000:28:04;899] THIS CRIME.
[000:28:07;102] LISTEN TO THE FAMILY AGAIN.
[000:28:11;940] >> NOBODY CAN PUT IT TOGETHER
[000:28:15;243] EXCEPT MARILOU.
[000:28:17;545] ONLY MARILOU CAN MAYBE HELP.
[000:28:21;583] >> INVESTIGATORS ARE INTERESTED
[000:28:23;051] IN THE $100,000 THAT STEPHEN
[000:28:25;286] PADDOCK SENT TO PHILIPPINES IN
[000:28:27;122] RECENT WEEKS.
[000:28:27;655] THE SPIC YOULATION IS THAT HE
[000:28:28;957] SENT IT TO HER BECAUSE HE KNEW
[000:28:30;592] AS SOON AS HE COMMITTED THE
[000:28:31;926] CRIME THAT ALL OF HIS ASSETS
[000:28:33;728] WOULD BE LOCKED DOWN POSSIBLY
[000:28:35;230] FOREVER AND SHE WOULDN'T GET ANY
[000:28:36;331] KIND OF MONEY OUT OF THAT AT
[000:28:38;633] ALL.
[000:28:38;900] WE SHOULD KNOW THIS FBI
[000:28:40;468] INTERVIEW IN LOS ANGELES COULD
[000:28:41;736] GO FOR SEVERAL MORE HOURS.
[000:28:43;104] THERE'S A NEWS CONFERENCE COMING
[000:28:44;773] UP.
[000:28:45;039] WE HOPE TO GET MORE INFORMATION
[000:28:46;174] ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GLEANING FROM
[000:28:47;442] THE INTERVIEW IN THE NEXT HOUR
[000:28:48;743] OR SO.
[000:28:49;310] >> Shepard: WE'LL CHECK IN FOR
[000:28:50;378] YOU ON THAT.
[000:28:55;183] TRACE, THANKS VERY MUCH.
[000:28:55;884] COMING UP HERE, ANDREW
[000:28:56;484] NAPOLITANO, THE JUDGE, ON WHERE
[000:28:57;285] THE INVESTIGATION GOES FROM HERE
[000:28:58;086] AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
[000:28:59;187] SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND STOPS
[000:29:00;789] COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS?
[000:29:01;956] THAT AND WE'RE WAITING FOR
[000:29:03;224] PRESIDENT TRUMP TO COME IN AND
[000:29:04;259] MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS,
[000:29:06;327] POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS
[000:29:07;095] THAT WILL MEET WITH HIM SHORTLY.
[000:29:08;630] WE'LL BE THERE LIVE FOR THAT AS
[000:29:11;499] THE NEWS ROLLS ON ON THIS
[000:29:12;167] WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.
[000:29:12;867] RLY... OR T.
[000:29:17;539] RLY... OR T.
[000:29:17;539] OR MAKE ME FEEL LIKE
[000:29:17;539] I'M NOT REALLY "THERE."
[000:29:20;475] TALK TO
[000:29:20;475] YOUR DOCTOR,
[000:29:21;876] AND CALL
[000:29:21;876] 844-234-2424.
[000:30:56;971] It's OK
[000:30:58;006] that everybody
[000:30:58;006] ignores me
[000:30:58;006] when I drive.
[000:30:59;474] It's fine, 'cause I get
[000:30:59;474] a Safe Driving Bonus Check
[000:31:01;409] every six months
[000:31:01;409] I'm accident-free.
[000:31:02;911] And I don't share it
[000:31:02;911] with Mom. Right, Mom?
[000:31:05;346] Right.
[000:31:06;381] Safe Driving Bonus Checks,
[000:31:07;749] only from Allstate.
[000:31:08;917] Switching to Allstate
[000:31:08;917] is worth it.
[000:31:16;824] >> I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH A FOX

[000:35:24;972] THIS INCREASINGLY LOUD VOICES ON
[000:35:29;844] CAPITOL HILL.
[000:35:30;311] BUT HE HAD A LOT OF COMPANY WITH
[000:35:31;112] HIM ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE.
[000:35:32;713] KEVIN McCARTHY WAS WITH HIM,
[000:35:36;250] SENATOR HELLER AND HIS WIFE,
[000:35:41;088] MELANIA WAS THERE WITH HIM.
[000:35:43;057] SO THE PRESIDENT STAYED IN THE
[000:35:44;525] FORWARD CABIN.
[000:35:45;326] YOU CAN SEE THE BREAK-UP.
[000:35:46;894] IT'S A UNIT THAT OPERATES ON
[000:35:49;564] CELL SERVICE.
[000:35:50;765] HOOKS IN TO A DIFFERENT OF CELL
[000:35:53;835] NODES.
[000:35:54;569] IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE, YOU GET
[000:35:57;371] PRETTY GOOD RECEPTION.
[000:36:02;009] SOMETIMES INSIDE, YOU LOSE
[000:36:02;743] CONNECTIVITY AND THE PICTURE
[000:36:03;477] GOES FUZZY LIKE THAT.
[000:36:04;645] IT'S A WAY TO BRING YOU
[000:36:07;582] IMMEDIATE PICTURES FROM
[000:36:08;649] SOMETHING THAT NORMALLY WE
[000:36:10;685] WOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS TOO.
[000:36:12;320] LATER ON WHEN WE GET THE
[000:36:14;255] FEEDBACK OVER THE SATELLITE,
[000:36:15;356] YOU'LL SEE THE PICTURES IN THE
[000:36:17;124] ENTIRETY AND CLARITY.
[000:36:18;559] THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE
[000:36:19;627] SPECIAL MENTION, SHEP, I'M TOLD
[000:36:24;031] BY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WHO
[000:36:24;932] SAW IT ON THE WAY HERE BEFORE WE
[000:36:27;034] LANDED, WANTS TO MAKE SPECIAL
[000:36:28;870] MENTION OF THE CIVILIANS WHO AT
[000:36:34;842] RISK TO THEIR OWN LIVES AND SOME
[000:36:35;643] OF THEM DID DIE DOING THIS,
[000:36:36;377] PROTECTED OTHER PEOPLE,
[000:36:37;511] PROTECTED LOVED ONES, TRIED TO
[000:36:39;247] GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE AREA, DID
[000:36:41;282] WHATEVER THEY COULD TO GET
[000:36:42;183] PEOPLE TO THE HOSPITALS.
[000:36:43;384] THESE ARE CITIZEN HEROS, SHEP
[000:36:45;152] THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
[000:36:46;754] HONOR.
[000:36:47;188] WE'LL SEE THEM IN A COUPLE
[000:36:49;891] MINUTES.
[000:36:50;258] HE'S TOURING THE COMMAND CENTER
[000:36:52;693] THERE WITH THE SHERIFF WHO HAS
[000:36:53;895] DONE AMAZING WORK IN THE WAKE OF
[000:36:56;898] THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.
[000:36:58;132] YOU CAN IMAGINE, YOU CAN
[000:37:01;168] PROBABLY COUNT ON ONE HAND THE
[000:37:19;186] NUMBER OF HOURS OF SLEEP HE'S
[000:37:19;954] HAD.
[000:37:20;221] THE PRESIDENT TAKING THE TOUR OF
[000:37:20;955] THE COMMAND CENTER, MEETING WITH
[000:37:21;689] THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE'LL
[000:37:22;423] HEAR FROM HIM SHORTLY WHERE HE
[000:37:23;157] WILL PAY TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE
[000:37:23;858] MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
[000:37:24;592] THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE
[000:37:25;326] AND THE CIVILIANS THAT DID THE
[000:37:26;060] SAME THING SUNDAY NIGHT.
[000:37:26;661] SHEP?
[000:37:26;961] >> Shepard: JOHN, THANKS SO
[000:37:27;628] MUCH.
[000:37:27;929] THE ROOM BEGINNING TO FILL WHERE
[000:37:28;696] THE PRESIDENT WILL GREET THOSE
[000:37:29;497] FOLKS.
[000:37:29;797] THEY'VE BEEN FILLING IN THE DOOR
[000:37:30;598] ON THE LEFT TO OUR LEFT SIDE OF
[000:37:33;868] THAT -- THE BLUE WALL BACK
[000:37:35;703] THERE, THE BLUE CURTAIN.
[000:37:41;042] YOU'LL SEE MORE COMING IN NOW.
[000:37:41;776] IT'S OUR BELIEF THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:37:42;543] ON HIS WAY RIGHT NOW.
[000:37:43;144] THE OTHER STORY OF THE DAY HAS
[000:37:43;978] BEEN THE REPORTS ON SECRETARY
[000:37:46;080] TILLERSON.
[000:37:46;747] IT WAS BACK IN THE SUMMER THAT
[000:37:48;783] CNN REPORTED AND NBC REPORTED
[000:37:50;885] OVERNIGHT AND INTO THIS MORNING,
[000:37:54;422] I THINK THEY DEBUTED IT ON
[000:38:00;695] MORNING JOE, THAT REX TILLERSON
[000:38:02;430] SAID I'M DONE, I'M GOING TO
[000:38:04;398] TEXAS.
[000:38:04;699] BUT THE PRESIDENT INTERVENED IN
[000:38:06;400] SOME WAY AND IT NEVER HAPPENED.
[000:38:08;602] NOW SECRETARY TILLERSON HAS SAID
[000:38:13;908] NONE OF THAT HAPPENED, IT'S FAKE
[000:38:14;742] NEWS.
[000:38:15;042] NBC NEWS STANDS BY ITS
[000:38:15;643] REPORTING.
[000:38:16;010] WITH THAT, WE RETURNED TO A.B.
[000:38:20;314] STODDARD.
[000:38:23;784] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF
[000:38:25;186] THIS.
[000:38:25;486] I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I
[000:38:27;455] TRIED TO QUIT AROUND HERE.
[000:38:29;290] EVERYBODY HAS BAD DAYS.
[000:38:31;325] I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF
[000:38:33;928] THIS.
[000:38:35;963] SECRETARY TILLERSON SAYS IT'S
[000:38:39;133] FAKE NEWS.
[000:38:39;700] NBC NEWS STANDS BY IT.
[000:38:40;935] I DON'T KNOW WHO TO MAKE OF IT.
[000:38:46;340] >> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
[000:38:47;008] REPORTING BETWEEN THE TENSION OF
[000:38:47;775] THE WEST WING AND THE WHITE
[000:38:48;609] HOUSE.
[000:38:49;043] REX TILLERSON WAS THE MOST
[000:38:50;044] POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD, HEAD
[000:38:51;479] OF EXXON MOBIL.
[000:38:56;650] HE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE REPORTERS
[000:38:59;020] FOLLOWING HIM AROUND ASKING HIM
[000:39:01;322] QUESTIONS IN HIS OLD LIFE ABOUT
[000:39:02;423] GLOBAL CONFRONTATIONS, HAVING TO
[000:39:04;225] DO WITH NATIONAL SECURITY.
[000:39:05;359] HE'S NOT TOTALLY AT EASE IN ALL
[000:39:07;161] THE ASPECTS OF THE JOB BUT HE
[000:39:10;464] MADE COMMENTS TODAY THAT WERE
[000:39:12;133] VERY COMPELLING ABOUT HIS
[000:39:13;901] COMMITMENT TO THE PRESIDENT AND
[000:39:14;869] THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND THAT
[000:39:19;774] AS A TEAM THEY'LL STICK
[000:39:20;441] TOGETHER.
[000:39:20;808] THEY'VE HAD SUCCESS.
[000:39:23;310] HE COMPLIMENTED NIKKI HALEY THAT
[000:39:26;180] SAID WOULD REPLACE HIM IF HE
[000:39:28;149] LEFT.
[000:39:28;682] THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT
[000:39:30;117] WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS BEEN
[000:39:32;153] PERFORMING A JOB THAT PRESIDENT
[000:39:33;187] TRUMP APPROVES OF.
[000:39:34;755] THAT HE'S BEEN SLOW TO HIRE --
[000:39:36;690] >> Shepard: THAT WAS THE POINT.
[000:39:38;893] >> HE'S NOT DOING THINGS THE WAY
[000:39:42;329] THAT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS HIM
[000:39:43;931] TO BE DOING THEM.
[000:39:45;499] BUT ALL THIS GOSSIP ABOUT WHAT
[000:39:47;034] HE'S CALLED THE PRESIDENT AND
[000:39:52;206] ALL OF THAT STUFF OBVIOUSLY GETS
[000:39:53;040] TO THE TOP OF THE HEADLINES.
[000:39:53;707] THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY
[000:39:54;408] SITUATION.
[000:39:55;643] ALSO BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SENT
[000:39:58;312] OUT A TWEET UNDERMINING HIM
[000:40:01;148] SAYING HIS WASTING HIS TIME IN
[000:40:02;850] CHINA TALKING ABOUT HOW WE HAVE
[000:40:04;685] PASSIVE NEGOTIATION OR DIALOGUE
[000:40:06;287] WITH THE NORTH KOREANS.
[000:40:07;655] HE'S WORKING ON A DIPLOMATIC
[000:40:10;224] SOLUTION TO A GRAVE CRISIS.
[000:40:13;360] MANY PEOPLE SAID ON SUNDAY LIKE
[000:40:16;230] RICHARD HAAS, REPUBLICAN FOREIGN
[000:40:17;565] POLICY EXPERT WITH EXPERIENCE,
[000:40:19;266] THAT REX TILLERSON SHOULD RESIGN
[000:40:24;572] AFTER THE WAY THE PRESIDENT
[000:40:25;306] SPOKE ABOUT HIM.
[000:40:27;041] IT'S OBVIOUSLY FILLED WITH
[000:40:29;543] TENSION AND THEY BOTH SOUNDED
[000:40:31;512] LIKE THEY WANT TO WORK.
[000:40:32;813] THE VERY UPBEAT IS HONORED BY
[000:40:35;683] TILLERSON'S COMMENTS, BUT
[000:40:36;584] THERE'S MORE BEHIND THE SCENES
[000:40:38;419] THAN WE UNDERSTOOD.
[000:40:39;186] >> Shepard: THERE'S A LOT THERE.
[000:40:40;387] WE HEAR FROM THE STATE
[000:40:42;790] DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS THAT
[000:40:45;059] THERE'S GREAT CONCERN AND GREAT
[000:40:47;628] FRUSTRATIONS THAT THE POSITIONS
[000:40:48;496] HAVE NOT BEEN FILLED.
[000:40:49;330] ON THE MATTER OF THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:40:52;733] TWEET REGARDING SECRETARY
[000:40:57;505] TILLERSON IN NORTH KOREA, THE
[000:40:58;305] PRESIDENT SAID DON'T WASTE YOUR
[000:40:59;073] TIME, SECRETARY TILLERSON.
[000:40:59;773] WE'RE GOING TO NEED WHAT NEEDS
[000:41:00;574] TO BE DONE.
[000:41:01;775] IN OTHER WORDS, STOP YOUR
[000:41:03;777] DIPLOMACY.
[000:41:04;145] IT'S HIS JOB TO HEAD UP THE
[000:41:05;613] DIPLOMACY.
[000:41:05;980] A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE
[000:41:08;349] VERY UPSET ABOUT WHAT IT WAS
[000:41:10;084] THAT THE PRESIDENT TWEETED
[000:41:11;485] BECAUSE IF HE MEANT IT, IT'S
[000:41:13;120] HARD TO SAY THAT HE MEANT
[000:41:14;421] ANYTHING OTHER THAN WE'RE GOING
[000:41:16;023] DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
[000:41:17;491] SOUNDS LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT
[000:41:19;026] SOMETHING AGGRESSIVE.
[000:41:20;194] >> ALSO JUST WHAT IT SHOWS TO
[000:41:22;263] THE CHINESE WHEN REX TILLERSON
[000:41:23;230] AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IS
[000:41:25;132] OVER IN CHINA DOING THIS VERY
[000:41:30;171] DIFFICULT WORK.
[000:41:30;671] THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE WORK.
[000:41:31;338] WHAT IT SHOWS WITH THE PRESIDENT
[000:41:34;108] UNDERMINING HIM AND THROWING HIM
[000:41:35;576] UNDER THE BUS AND UNDERMINING
[000:41:38;913] THE IMPORTANCE OF DIPLOMACY
[000:41:41;582] SENDS A WORRISOME SIGNAL ABOUT
[000:41:43;484] HOW HE'S TREATING REX TILLERSON
[000:41:44;518] AND HOW HE'S HANDLING THE
[000:41:45;653] PROCESS IN TERMS OF WHAT HE'S
[000:41:47;588] ASKING THE CHINESE TO DO TO TRY
[000:41:50;758] TO MITIGATE THE THREAT OF NORTH
[000:41:52;860] KOREA.
[000:41:53;160] WE VERY MUCH OBVIOUSLY DEPEND ON
[000:41:54;728] THE CHINESE IN THIS SITUATION.
[000:41:56;463] PRESIDENT TRUMP TO HIS CREDIT
[000:41:58;065] HAS GOTTEN THE CHINESE
[000:42:02;803] GOVERNMENT TO STOP ALL CENTRAL
[000:42:03;604] BANK ACTIVITY WITH THE NORTH
[000:42:04;338] KOREANS.
[000:42:04;705] THAT'S A HUGE STEP.
[000:42:05;272] IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE
[000:42:06;207] GREAT -- COULD BE CONSEQUENTIAL
[000:42:08;475] IF THEY ACTUALLY ENFORCE IT.
[000:42:11;445] BUT IT'S A REAL QUESTION ABOUT
[000:42:12;947] NOT ONLY TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP WHEN
[000:42:14;848] HE DOES SOMETHING LIKE THAT
[000:42:16;884] TWEET, BUT HOW LONG PEOPLE THAT
[000:42:19;587] WORK UNDERNEATH HIM AND REPORT
[000:42:21;255] TO HIM CAN ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO
[000:42:24;058] DO THEIR JOBS IF THEY'RE TREATED
[000:42:25;926] THAT WAY.
[000:42:26;327] THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL JOB.
[000:42:28;128] BEING SECRETARY OF STATE AND
[000:42:28;996] TRYING TO HANDLE THE NORTH KOREA
[000:42:30;397] CRISIS IS AT THE TOP OF THE
[000:42:35;202] LIST.
[000:42:35;502] >> Shepard: THERE'S A LOT ON THE
[000:42:36;270] PLATE TODAY.
[000:42:36;670] NOW THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE
[000:42:37;404] ROUNDS OUT IN LAS VEGAS AND
[000:42:38;138] SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS
[000:42:40;541] GUN CONTROL AT A LATER DAY.
[000:42:41;709] THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
[000:42:43;677] SUGGESTED OVER TIME PRESIDENT
[000:42:45;312] TRUMP THAT USED TO BE MUCH MORE
[000:42:48;616] LIBERAL IN MANHATTAN WAS --
[000:42:50;417] MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE FOR GUN
[000:42:51;619] CONTROL AT A TIME BEFORE HIS
[000:42:54;121] PRESIDENCY.
[000:42:54;521] I KNOW BECAUSE I READ THE MAIL
[000:42:55;889] AND STUFF THAT THERE'S A LOT OF
[000:42:59;727] CONSERVATIVES CONCERNED THAT HE
[000:43:00;995] MIGHT BECOME MORE PRO GUN
[000:43:01;929] CONTROL IN THE DAYS AHEAD.
[000:43:08;002] >> THE SUPPORTERS THAT PUT
[000:43:08;702] PRESIDENT TRUMP IN OFFICE ARE
[000:43:09;470] LITTLE CONCERNED THAT HE'S NOT
[000:43:10;638] GOTTEN OUT OF THE TRADE
[000:43:12;239] AGREEMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE TRANS
[000:43:13;607] PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP.
[000:43:14;708] HE'S PUT MORE TROOPS IN
[000:43:17;111] AFGHANISTAN.
[000:43:17;578] AND THAT HE WAS WILLING TO TALK
[000:43:20;481] ABOUT DOING AN AGREEMENT ON
[000:43:22;349] IMMIGRATION WITH THE DEMOCRATIC
[000:43:24;852] LEADERS IN CONGRESS.
[000:43:25;686] SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN
[000:43:27;288] ABOUT HIS UNPREDICTABILITY AND
[000:43:29;990] WHETHER OR NOT HE IS MORE TO A
[000:43:31;959] SET OF IDEALOGICAL PRINCIPLES
[000:43:33;294] THAT HE WILL STICK TO AS
[000:43:35;329] PRESIDENT.
[000:43:35;696] HE'S ON THE RECORD IN THE PAST
[000:43:40;634] BEING SUPPORTING GUN CONTROL.
[000:43:41;669] HE'S A WILD CARD, SHEP.
[000:43:43;304] I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL
[000:43:44;138] HAPPEN WITH HIM.
[000:43:45;172] IF HE CREATES A BRIDGE,
[000:43:48;876] SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN.
[000:43:49;543] >> Shepard: WE'LL SEE.
[000:43:50;277] HE SAYS HE WILL DISCUSS IT IN
[000:43:51;945] THE DAYS AHEAD.
[000:43:53;447] AS THAT HAPPENS, WE'LL FOLLOW
[000:43:55;416] THE DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY COME.
[000:43:57;017] IN ONCE AGAIN, FOX TELEVISION
[000:43:59;286] STATIONS ACROSS THE NATION WILL
[000:44:00;554] JOIN US RIGHT NOW.
[000:44:01;789] GOOD AFTERNOON FROM FOX NEWS IN
[000:44:03;757] NEW YORK.
[000:44:04;892] I'M SHEPARD SMITH.
[000:44:06;226] THE PRESIDENT THIS AFTERNOON IS
[000:44:17;237] IN LAS VEGAS WHERE HE'S ABOUT TO
[000:44:18;038] MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS.
[000:44:18;706] THESE ARE POLICE CHIEFS, FIRE
[000:44:19;406] OFFICIALS AND OTHERS THAT WERE
[000:44:20;140] INSTRUMENTAL IN ENDING THE
[000:44:20;808] MASSACRE THAT HAPPENED OUTSIDE
[000:44:21;542] THE MANDALAY BAY AND LUXOR
[000:44:22;209] HOTELS ON THE STRIP DURING THE
[000:44:23;744] COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL.
[000:44:25;979] 59 KILLED.
[000:44:27;081] A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DEATH
[000:44:28;549] TOLL.
[000:44:29;049] THE GUNMAN DIED, ACCORDING TO
[000:44:32;453] AUTHORITIES, KILLED HIMSELF.
[000:44:33;587] THERE'S 59 OTHERS THAT HAVE DIED
[000:44:36;824] AS ANOTHER DIED IN THE HOSPITAL.
[000:44:38;992] THAT BRINGS THE DEATH TOLL TO
[000:44:41;228] 59.
[000:44:45;432] MORE THAN 540 INJURED.
[000:44:46;133] THE PRESIDENT SPREADING THE LOVE
[000:44:46;900] OF THE PEOPLE AND THANKS FROM
[000:44:47;601] THE WHITE HOUSE AND FROM THE
[000:44:48;335] AMERICAN FEEL IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:44:49;103] ABOUT A MINUTE AGO, WE GOT A
[000:44:50;938] TWO-MINUTE WARNING ON THIS.
[000:44:52;639] OUR VIEWERS ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL
[000:44:54;641] HAVE BEEN LISTENING DELONG AS WE
[000:44:56;510] DISCUSS THE OTHER NEWS ITEMS OF
[000:44:58;512] THE DAY.
[000:44:59;546] THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR.
[000:45:00;848] WE'VE SEEN HIM AT THREE
[000:45:02;082] DIFFERENT APPEARANCES IN
[000:45:03;183] LAS VEGAS SINCE HE ARRIVED A FEW
[000:45:06;220] SHORT HOURS AGO.
[000:45:07;454] HE AND THE FIRST LADY ARE THERE.
[000:45:08;789] THE ORDER OF THE DAY HAS BEEN TO
[000:45:10;791] THANK PEOPLE TO ALLOW THEM TO
[000:45:12;526] TELL THEIR STORIES OF WHAT
[000:45:14;161] HAPPENED DURING THE MASSACRE.
[000:45:16;397] WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ORDINARY
[000:45:18;432] PEOPLE STEP FORWARD AND BECOME
[000:45:20;200] EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS OR WE
[000:45:22;202] LEARNED OF THEIR EXTRAORDINARY
[000:45:23;971] FORTITUDE AS THEY HELPED PEOPLE
[000:45:25;406] OUT, STORIES OF PEOPLE PUTTING
[000:45:27;608] FOLKS IN THE BACK OF THEIR
[000:45:28;909] TRUCKS TO TAKE THEM TO
[000:45:31;078] HOSPITALS.
[000:45:31;745] PEOPLE PLUGGING WOUNDS, STOPPING
[000:45:33;180] BLOOD FROM FLOWING OUT OF
[000:45:34;748] PEOPLE'S BODIES.
[000:45:37;251] THERE'S NO TELLING SPECIFICALLY
[000:45:39;887] HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SAVED AS A
[000:45:40;954] RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE
[000:45:42;389] THAT WERE NOT DOCTORS.
[000:45:44;124] THEY WERE JUST PEOPLE THAT
[000:45:44;892] STEPPED IN TO TRY TO HELP AT A
[000:45:51;198] MOMENT'S NOTICE.
[000:45:51;698] JOHN ROBERTS IS THERE.
[000:45:52;299] HE'S THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:45:53;233] CORRESPONDENT.
[000:45:53;734] JOHN, A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED
[000:45:55;068] REST IN THAT CITY, ESPECIALLY
[000:45:56;537] THE ONES WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO
[000:45:59;973] HAVE BEEN MIGHTY GLAD TO SEE THE
[000:46:02;743] PRESIDENT.
[000:46:03;110] >> IT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL
[000:46:04;711] FATIGUE, EITHER.
[000:46:06;814] THE MENTAL FATIGUE AS WELL.
[000:46:10;517] LIVING EVERY DAY WITH WHAT
[000:46:12;186] HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT AND IT
[000:46:13;253] SPREADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
[000:46:14;755] THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD
[000:46:16;457] HAVE BEEN VISITORS FROM OUT OF
[000:46:17;925] TOWN HERE FOR THE WEEKEND AND
[000:46:22;663] JUST WANTED TO ENJOY SOME
[000:46:23;397] COUNTRY MUSIC AND JASON ALDEAN
[000:46:25;399] PACKING IN A CROWD OF 22,000
[000:46:27;434] PEOPLE.
[000:46:27;935] YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT WAS GOING
[000:46:29;269] ON IN THE CONCERT WHEN FROM THE
[000:46:32;272] 32nd FLOOR WINDOWS BEHIND ME,
[000:46:37;878] THIS GUY PADDOCK TOOK THE
[000:46:40;214] SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS THAT WERE
[000:46:43;217] CONVERTED TO FEAR NEW HAMPSHIRE
[000:46:44;418] AUTOMATIC RATE OF FIRE AND START
[000:46:47;387] RAINING HELLFIRE DOWN UPON
[000:46:48;388] PEOPLE THERE JUST LISTENING TO
[000:46:49;723] MUSIC.
[000:46:50;023] SO MANY OF THEM RAN FOR THE EXIT
[000:46:51;892] AS YOU WOULD EXPECT AS MANY
[000:46:56;897] PEOPLE WOULD.
[000:46:57;364] MANY OF THEM FELL TO THE GROUND
[000:46:59;600] MORE TALLY WOUNDED OR SERIALLY
[000:47:04;705] WOUNDED.
[000:47:05;072] AND MANY DECIDED THEY WOULD
[000:47:08;375] STAND AND HELP PEOPLE.
[000:47:10;944] YOU CAN IMAGINE IN A STATE OF
[000:47:13;380] FEAR AND SHOCK THAT THEY WOULD
[000:47:15;249] DO THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY.
[000:47:18;385] THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL
[000:47:20;220] PAY TRIBUTE TOO.
[000:47:21;955] >> Shepard: WE'RE WATCHING THE
[000:47:22;756] CROWD MAKE ITS WAY IN THE ROOM.
[000:47:24;491] THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TOURING
[000:47:29;763] THE COMMAND FACILITY THERE.
[000:47:30;464] THIS IS A LAS VEGAS POLICE
[000:47:31;164] DEPARTMENT COMMAND FACILITY.
[000:47:32;599] IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE
[000:47:34;101] INFORMATION FROM LAS VEGAS
[000:47:35;435] POLICE, AND THEY CALL THEM METRO
[000:47:36;870] THERE, THAT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
[000:47:38;138] ABOUT, THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE
[000:47:39;206] THE CALLS WERE INCOMING.
[000:47:41;008] IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT ON
[000:47:42;643] THE PHONE CALLING THE POLICE
[000:47:43;777] DEPARTMENT.
[000:47:44;711] AND THEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
[000:47:46;680] ITSELF TRYING TO ORGANIZE ALL OF
[000:47:48;215] THE FIRST RESPONDERS COMING.
[000:47:50;083] AT ONE POINT WE HEARD ON POLICE
[000:47:53;620] RADIOS THEM TELLING PEOPLE TO
[000:47:56;957] GET OFF OF NORTH LAS VEGAS
[000:48:01;695] BOULEVARD BECAUSE THEY REALIZED
[000:48:02;496] WHERE THE SHOTS WERE COMING FROM
[000:48:03;297] IN THE NORTH TOWER OF MANDALAY
[000:48:05;132] BAY.
[000:48:05;432] BUT THE POLICE AT THE TIME SAID,
[000:48:06;567] YOU KNOW, DON'T USE THAT HIGHWAY
[000:48:09;536] BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SIGHT OF HIM.
[000:48:12;406] THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT
[000:48:13;273] AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS ARRIVING
[000:48:14;841] TO HELP IN THIS SITUATION WOULD
[000:48:15;809] BECOME VICTIMS.
[000:48:17;177] WE KNOW A NUMBER OF LAW
[000:48:19;046] ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT WERE
[000:48:20;314] OFF DUTY AND AT THAT CONCERT
[000:48:22;683] WERE INJURED IN ONE WAY OR
[000:48:25;852] ANOTHER.
[000:48:26;253] EIGHT I BELIEVE FROM THE STATE
[000:48:35;195] OF CALIFORNIA FROM DIFFERENT
[000:48:37;564] JURISDICTIONS.
[000:48:38;465] DIFFERENT POLICE DEPARTMENTS
[000:48:39;199] WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE INJURED.
[000:48:40;167] THE AUTHORITIES TOLD US THIS
[000:48:41;768] MORNING THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE
[000:48:42;769] TO IDENTIFY ALL BUT THREE OF THE
[000:48:46;540] VICTIMS.
[000:48:47;274] SADLY THEY REPORTED TO US SOME
[000:48:48;675] OF THE VICTIMS WITH REALLY --
[000:48:54;548] WERE LEFT IN A POSITION TO
[000:48:56;116] IDENTIFY THEM.
[000:48:56;650] AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING ON
[000:48:58;218] IDENTIFYING THREE OF THEM WHO
[000:48:59;152] DIED ON THAT FATEFUL NIGHT.
[000:49:01;421] IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL
[000:49:06;326] WORKERS WERE CONGRATULATED BY
[000:49:07;060] THE PRESIDENT AND THANKED BY THE
[000:49:07;828] PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF THE
[000:49:08;528] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:49:09;429] THEY DISCUSS HOW THE HALLWAYS,
[000:49:11;164] THE TRAUMA CENTER AND THE OTHER
[000:49:13;734] HOSPITALS IN THE AREA WERE JUST
[000:49:16;503] LITERALLY OVERFLOWING WITH
[000:49:17;804] PEOPLE.
[000:49:18;138] MEDICAL -- SOME PEOPLE GETTING
[000:49:20;507] OUT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BEDS TO
[000:49:21;642] MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS THAT WERE
[000:49:24;211] MORE GRAVELY WOUNDED.
[000:49:25;545] THE SAME IN AMBULANCES AS THEY
[000:49:27;814] WERE LOADING PEOPLE IN
[000:49:29;149] AMBULANCES TO TAKE THEM TO
[000:49:30;517] HOSPITALS FROM THE SHOOTING
[000:49:32;819] SCENE.
[000:49:33;120] WE GOT WORD OF I DON'T KNOW HOW
[000:49:42;362] MANY DOZENS OF PEOPLE THAT
[000:49:43;063] TRANSPORTED VICTIMS TO THE
[000:49:43;764] HOSPITALS IN VANS, TRUCKS.
[000:49:44;431] SOME PEOPLE INJURED THEMSELVES
[000:49:45;165] HELPING TO STOP THE BLEEDING OF
[000:49:45;966] OTHER PEOPLE.
[000:49:46;433] THE STORIES ARE ENDLESS OF MAN
[000:49:48;001] AND WOMAN HELPING MAN AND WOMAN.
[000:49:50;504] THERE WERE TEENAGERS INVOLVED
[000:49:52;239] THERE AS WELL.
[000:49:52;839] A MATT RUSH TO TRY TO GET OUT.
[000:49:56;176] DIFFERENT PEOPLE TELLING STORIES
[000:49:57;811] OF IF I DIDN'T KNOW TO CROUCH
[000:49:59;613] DOWN AND WAIT AND WAIT FOR
[000:50:01;048] INSTRUCTIONS OR BE RUNNING FOR
[000:50:03;050] THE EXITS WHERE THE HUGE CROWDS.
[000:50:04;685] THINK OF WHEN YOU EXIT A CONCERT
[000:50:12;192] VENUE HOW LONG YOU HAVE TO STAND
[000:50:12;993] AND WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET UP
[000:50:13;794] THE AISLES IN CASES LIKE THAT
[000:50:15;495] WHERE THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER
[000:50:17;130] SHOOTING DOWN FROM THE 32nd
[000:50:19;366] FLOOR.
[000:50:19;700] WELL, THEY WERE IN MANY CASES
[000:50:21;702] JUST DEFENSELESS AND OUT IN THE
[000:50:23;303] WIDE OPEN.
[000:50:24;104] CLAUDIA COWAN IS IN LAS VEGAS
[000:50:25;372] WITH THE STORY WITH SOME OF
[000:50:26;773] THESE VICTIMS.
[000:50:29;843] CLAUDIA?
[000:50:31;378] >> WELL, WITH SHEPARD, EVERY
[000:50:36;183] STORY OF A VICTIM IS A LIFE CUT
[000:50:38;752] SHORT.
[000:50:39;152] THERE WAS A MEMORIAL LAST NIGHT
[000:50:44;925] IN MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA FOR
[000:50:45;726] 50-YEAR-OLD STACY ECHABAR.
[000:50:52;165] VINCENT PUT HIS WIFE IN A PLACE
[000:50:54;234] THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE SAFE
[000:50:56;737] FOR HER WHILE HE HELPED OTHER
[000:50:59;506] PEOPLE TO SCRAMBLE FOR SAFETY.
[000:51:01;475] ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT SHE HAD
[000:51:04;344] DIED.
[000:51:04;644] I CAN TELL YOU A LAS VEGAS
[000:51:06;213] POLICE OFFICER THAT WAS OFF DUTY
[000:51:08;248] OUT ENJOYING THE MUSIC SUNDAY
[000:51:10;283] NIGHT, HE PASSED AWAY AS WELL
[000:51:13;987] AND A VIGIL SUNDAY NIGHT.
[000:51:16;223] BACK TO YOU.
[000:51:16;790] >> Shepard: THANKS.
[000:51:17;390] THE GOVERNOR IS INTRODUCING THE
[000:51:18;925] PRESIDENT.
[000:51:19;326] LET'S LISTEN IN.
[000:51:19;860] >> THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND HOW
[000:51:22;729] THEY REACTED TO THIS SITUATION
[000:51:24;631] PROVIDED SO MANY LOVE AND CARE
[000:51:26;600] FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HARMED
[000:51:28;535] BY THIS HORRIBLE INCIDENT.
[000:51:31;571] THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY, THOSE
[000:51:33;907] THAT CAME TO THE AID OF THESE
[000:51:35;776] PEOPLE.
[000:51:36;409] THE EMPLOYEES AT MGM RESORTS AND
[000:51:38;411] HOW THEY RESPONDED AS WELL.
[000:51:40;947] AND EVERYONE ELSE, PERFECT
[000:51:43;216] STRANGERS AND HOW THEY RESPONDED
[000:51:45;018] TO THIS AND GAVE LOVE AND
[000:51:48;688] ASSISTANCE TO THEIR FELLOW MAN.
[000:51:49;689] I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE
[000:51:51;124] FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND
[000:51:53;093] ACROSS THE WORLD FOR THEIR
[000:51:55;996] OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT AND
[000:51:57;531] GENEROSITY THAT HAS COME HERE.
[000:51:58;965] IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR
[000:52:01;568] HISTORY.
[000:52:01;902] MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT
[000:52:05;071] ALONE AND GIVES US STRENGTH.
[000:52:06;540] BRIEFLY I ATTENDED A CANDLELIGHT
[000:52:09;242] VIGIL LAST NIGHT AT THE
[000:52:10;477] UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA.
[000:52:13;914] IT WAS AN IMPROMPTU EVENT.
[000:52:15;816] OVER 1,500 PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON
[000:52:18;118] SHORT NOTICE.
[000:52:22;689] WE ALL HELD CANDLES, WE ALL
[000:52:23;423] HUGGED ONE ANOTHER.
[000:52:23;990] WE HELD HANDS.
[000:52:24;724] WE HELD THOSE FLAMES OUT IN
[000:52:25;892] FRONT OF US TO SHOW TRIBUTE TO
[000:52:28;128] THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES
[000:52:32;299] OF THIS HORRIBLE EVENT.
[000:52:34;568] AND TO -- AT THAT MOMENT,
[000:52:39;773] DESPITE HOW DARK AND COLD IT WAS
[000:52:42;909] I SAW AND WE ALL SAW THE
[000:52:44;811] GREATEST DARKNESS CAN'T PUT OUT
[000:52:46;479] THE SMALLEST LIGHT.
[000:52:48;081] WE COLLECTIVELY FELT FOR THE
[000:52:55;222] FIRST TIME THE FIRST PANES OF
[000:52:55;989] HOPE.
[000:52:56;289] WE SAW DESPITE THE SADNESS AND
[000:52:57;023] GRIEF AROUND US THAT WE'RE
[000:52:58;458] RESILIENT AND THAT WE'RE
[000:53:00;227] COMMITTED TO FIGHT AND RECOVER
[000:53:01;094] AND BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF
[000:53:03;864] HEALING.
[000:53:04;331] WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF
[000:53:07;500] PULLING TOGETHER.
[000:53:08;902] YES, WE'RE HURT, WE'RE HURT
[000:53:12;372] BADLY, BUT WE'RE NOT BROKEN.
[000:53:14;608] AS I SAID, WE'VE SEEN GENEROSITY
[000:53:16;276] ON A SCALE THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED
[000:53:19;479] IN NEVADA HISTORY.
[000:53:20;714] WE KNOW THAT WE WILL NEVER EVER
[000:53:22;849] FORGET THIS HORRIFIC EVENT.
[000:53:27;587] WE WILL MARCH FORWARD AS A
[000:53:28;288] FAMILY, GIVING EACH OTHER
[000:53:30;590] COMFORT, SUPPORT AND LOVE.
[000:53:33;059] FUTURE WILL COME ONE DAY AT A
[000:53:36;529] TIME.
[000:53:36;830] WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE HOW WE'RE
[000:53:40;033] GOING TO LIVE EACH DAY.
[000:53:42;702] WE MUST BE GLAD, WE MUST BE
[000:53:46;339] GOOD, WE MUST BE BRAVE.
[000:53:48;575] WE MUST HAVE FAITH.
[000:53:50;310] WE WILL EMERGE AS A STRONGER,
[000:53:54;814] KINDER, BETTER STATE AND NATION.
[000:54:00;387] GOD BLESS THE VICTIMS AND THEIR
[000:54:02;455] FAMILIES.
[000:54:02;822] MAY THEY GIVE THEM PEACE, GOD
[000:54:06;326] BLESS OUR STATE AND THE NATION,
[000:54:08;828] THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.
[000:54:10;230] WITH THAT, I'M VERY PRIVILEGED
[000:54:12;699] AND HONORED TO INTRODUCE THE
[000:54:14;567] FIRST LADY AND THE PRESIDENT OF
[000:54:17;837] THE UNITED STATES.

[000:56:12;919] IN THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO RISK
[000:56:16;089] THEIR LIVES FOR OURS.
[000:56:18;858] THE MASS MURDER TOOK PLACE
[000:56:20;860] SUNDAY NIGHT FILLS AMERICA'S
[000:56:23;129] HEART WITH GRIEF.
[000:56:26;132] AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN
[000:56:30;437] MOURNING.
[000:56:31;471] I VISITED THE HOSPITAL EARLIER
[000:56:33;506] TODAY WHERE MANY VICTIMS ARE
[000:56:36;409] STILL RECOVERS FROM THEIR
[000:56:38;178] WOUNDS.
[000:56:42;515] WE ASK GOD TO EASE THEIR

[000:56:44;751] WE PRAY FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE

[000:56:54;260] CALLED.
[000:56:54;594] AND WE GRIEVE THE LOSS OF THE
[000:56:57;530] LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL WHO
[000:57:01;401] WERE KILLED IN THIS VICIOUS
[000:57:04;304] ATTACK.
[000:57:04;637] MANY FAMILIES TONIGHT WILL GO TO
[000:57:06;473] BED IN A WORLD THAT IS SUDDENLY
[000:57:10;777] EMPTY, THE PEOPLE THEY SO DEARLY
[000:57:15;582] LOVE WERE TORN AWAY FROM THEM
[000:57:18;151] FOREVER.
[000:57:18;885] OUR SOULS ARE STRIKEN WITH GRIEF
[000:57:21;554] FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO LOST A
[000:57:23;323] HUSBAND OR A WIFE, A MOTHER OR A

[000:57:31;431] ENDLESS.
[000:57:31;764] WE STAND TOGETHER TO HELP YOU

[000:57:36;136] YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

[000:57:42;642] HERE AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
[000:57:48;581] WE REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN WHO
[000:57:49;349] DIED THIS WEEK, CHARLES
[000:57:52;051] HARTFIELD.
[000:57:52;418] HE WAS A VERY, VERY SPECIAL
[000:57:55;288] PERSON.
[000:57:55;822] OFFICER HARTFIELD WAS A PROUD
[000:57:58;825] VETERAN, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, A
[000:58:01;828] LOVING FATHER.
[000:58:03;696] HIS DEATH IS A TRAGIC LOSS FOR
[000:58:05;932] THIS POLICE FORCE, FOR THIS CITY
[000:58:09;502] AND FOR OUR GREAT NATION.
[000:58:10;870] WE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORDS TO
[000:58:12;605] EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN HOW SUCH
[000:58:15;508] EVIL CAN EXIST, HOW THERE CAN BE
[000:58:20;914] SUCH CRUELTY AND SUCH SUFFERING.
[000:58:21;848] WE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE EVIL
[000:58:24;083] THAT THREATENINGS US OR THE
[000:58:26;252] VIOLENCE THAT INCITES SUCH
[000:58:29;455] TERROR.
[000:58:29;856] WE'RE DEFINED BY THE LOVE, OUR
[000:58:32;825] CARING AND OUR COURAGE.
[000:58:35;461] IN THE DARKEST MOMENTS, WHAT
[000:58:38;198] SHINES MOST BRIGHTLY IS THE
[000:58:41;000] GOODNESS THAT THRIVES IN THE
[000:58:43;469] HEARTS OF OUR PEOPLE.
[000:58:44;971] THAT GOODNESS IS OUR LIGHT HOUSE
[000:58:48;174] AND OUR SOLACE.
[000:58:53;046] IS KNOWLEDGE.
[000:58:53;513] THAT THE SOULS OF THOSE THAT
[000:58:54;247] PASSED ARE NOW AT PEACE IN
[000:58:57;584] HEAVEN.
[000:58:57;917] HERE ON EARTH, WE'RE BLESSED TO
[000:58:59;686] BE SURROUNDED BY HEROS.
[000:59:03;556] AS ONE EYE WITNESS RECOUNTED
[000:59:05;291] THIS WEEK, WHILE EVERYONE ELSE
[000:59:08;161] WAS CROUCHING, POLICE OFFICERS
[000:59:09;696] WERE STANDING UP AS TARGETS JUST
[000:59:12;699] TRYING TO DISTRICT PEOPLE AND
[000:59:14;601] TELL THEM WHERE TO GO.
[000:59:16;169] THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING UP IN
[000:59:19;405] THE LINE OF FIRE TO HELP THOSE
[000:59:24;877] IN DANGER AND TO FIND OUT WHERE
[000:59:25;678] THOSE HORRIBLE SHOTS WERE COMING
[000:59:28;047] FROM.
[000:59:28;348] WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE
[000:59:31;451] BRAVERY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
[000:59:33;853] WITNESSED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.
[000:59:37;724] AMERICANS DENIED DEATH AND
[000:59:40;994] HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH
[000:59:44;731] COURAGE.
[000:59:46;132] WHEN THE WORD AND WORST OF
[001:00:17;964] HUMANITY STRIKES, THE BEST OF
[001:00:18;731] HUMANITY RESPONDS.
[001:00:19;265] PARENTS AND SPOUSES USED THEIR
[001:00:19;999] OWN BODIES AS SHIELDS TO PROTECT
[001:00:20;733] LOVES ONES.
[001:00:21;134] AMERICANS DASHED INTO A HAIL OF
[001:00:21;868] BULLETS TO RESCUE TOTAL
[001:00:22;468] STRANGERS.
[001:00:22;835] JOINING US TODAY ARE MANY OF THE
[001:00:23;569] HEROS THAT WERE HERE DURING THAT
[001:00:24;304] HORRIBLE MOMENT, THAT HORRIBLE
[001:00:25;038] NIGHT.
[001:00:25;338] INCLUDING LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN
[001:00:28;641] POLICE OFFICE
[001:00:31;644] POLICE OFFICERS.
[001:00:32;178] OFFICER PETERSON WAS ON HIS
[001:00:33;513] SECOND DAY ON THE JOB WHEN THE
[001:00:36;783] SHOOTING BEGAN.
[001:00:38;785] I JUST VISITED HIM IN THE
[001:00:42;221] HOSPITAL.
[001:00:42;689] WITHIN MINUTES, HE JOINED A
[001:00:44;290] GROUP OF OFFICERS RUSHING
[001:00:46;359] BETWEEN FLYING BULLETS TO CLEAR
[001:00:49;662] THE FAIR GROUNDS AND SAVE LIVES.
[001:00:53;166] OFFICER GURLET WAS OFF DUTY
[001:00:56;669] ATTENDING THE CONCERT.
[001:00:58;137] ALL THOSE S
