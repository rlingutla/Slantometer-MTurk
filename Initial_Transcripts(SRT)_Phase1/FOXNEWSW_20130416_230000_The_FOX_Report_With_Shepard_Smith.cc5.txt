[000:00:01;718] RUNNING THE MARATHON AND
[000:00:03;486] DEHYDRATED, HE CAME BACK.
[000:00:06;790] >> THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON AND
[000:00:09;025] PEOPLE COMING OUT FROM
[000:00:11;094] RESTAURANTS TO GET TRASH BAGS
[000:00:15;565] AND WATER....
[000:00:17;801] >> Shep: BREAKING NEWS ON FOX
[000:00:19;469] NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:00:20;303] THESE, I AM TOLD, ARE VIDEOTAPE
[000:00:22;672] FIRST IMAGES OF WHAT APPEARS TO
[000:00:24;441] BE ONE OF THE BOMBS THAT
[000:00:26;042] EXPLODED IN THE BOSTON MARATHON
[000:00:27;977] YESTERDAY.
[000:00:28;745] THIS IS BRAND-NEW.
[000:00:30;113] YOU ARE LOOKING AT PHOTOS WE
[000:00:31;748] RECEIVED JUST MINUTES AGO.
[000:00:33;483] OUR FOX STATION FOX 5 IN ATLANTA
[000:00:39;022] OBTAINED THIS IMAGE.
[000:00:40;323] IT'S ONE OF THE PRESSURE BOMBS
[000:00:42;258] AFTER IT EXPLODED.
[000:00:43;593] ON THERE YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE
[000:00:45;862] AN F.B.I. TAG.
[000:00:46;996] THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF WHAT
[000:00:50;567] CAUSED THE CHAOS IN BOSTON.
[000:00:54;604] GAIL RUSSELL REPORTER BROKE THIS
[000:00:57;407] NEWS AND DALE, HOW DO YOU KNOW
[000:00:59;743] WHAT THIS IS AND HOW DID YOU GET
[000:01:01;978] IT?
[000:01:03;213] >> SHEPARD, WE GOT THIS THROUGH
[000:01:05;281] SOURCES WHO VERIFIED FOR US THAT
[000:01:07;283] THESE ARE ACTUAL CRIME SCENE
[000:01:09;319] PHOTOS FROM THE FIRST BOMB FROM
[000:01:12;455] MONDAY'S BOSTON MARATHON
[000:01:15;792] BOMBING.
[000:01:16;292] >> Shep: TELL ME WHAT WE'RE
[000:01:17;727] LOOKING AT HERE.
[000:01:18;495] WHETHER I LOOK AT IT, I CAN'T
[000:01:20;163] TELL WHAT IT IS?
[000:01:21;097] >> WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS AN
[000:01:23;700] ORDINARY, EVERYDAY PRESSURE
[000:01:26;202] COOKER.
[000:01:26;703] THEY ARE VERY COMMON IN THE
[000:01:28;171] STORES, BUT ALSO THEY ARE COMMON
[000:01:30;306] FOR BOMB MAKING.
[000:01:31;341] YOU ALSO SEE A BLACK PADDED
[000:01:34;043] EITHER KNAPSACK OR DUFFEL BAG
[000:01:36;913] THAT MY SOURCES SAY THE BOMB WAS
[000:01:38;748] CARRIED IN.
[000:01:39;349] THERE IS ALSO SMALL BEARING TYPE
[000:01:45;421] PELLETS, AND SOME SORT OF PUT AT
[000:01:49;425] THIS HOLDING THEM TOGETHER.
[000:01:50;894] IT WAS PART OF THE SHRAPNEL THAT
[000:01:55;431] MATES IT DEADLY.
[000:01:57;901] >> SO INVESTIGATORS HAD THIS
[000:01:59;803] FROM THE EARLY MINUTES.
[000:02:01;404] THE PEOPLE TOOK THE PICTURES.
[000:02:02;705] WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THEY TOOK
[000:02:03;973] PICTURES OF THIS.
[000:02:05;141] SINCE THEN THEY HAVE BEEN
[000:02:08;011] ANALYZING IT.
[000:02:08;878] LOOKING AT ALL THE MATERIALS,
[000:02:10;346] TRYING TO TRACE THEM BACK TO THE
[000:02:12;081] SOURCE AND HELPING THEM TRACE TO
[000:02:14;250] WHOEVER BOUGHT THEM AND PUT THEM
[000:02:17;720] TOGETHER.
[000:02:18;388] >> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO.
[000:02:21;357] WHERE WERE THEY MANUFACTURED AND
[000:02:24;093] WHERE WERE THEY SOLD.
[000:02:25;795] THEY ARE VERY COMMON EVERYDAY
[000:02:28;331] PIECES.
[000:02:29;032] THE KEY IS WHEN THEY GET TO
[000:02:30;600] THESE PIECES, THEY GET THEM INTO
[000:02:32;135] THE LABORATORY.
[000:02:32;669] THAT IS WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO
[000:02:34;103] FIND WHETHER THERE IS A SIMPLE
[000:02:36;573] LITTLE PIECE OF DNA OH A SLICE
[000:02:39;709] OF SCOTCH TAPE OR FINGERPRINT
[000:02:41;911] LEFT OVER ON A DEVICE THAT THE
[000:02:43;479] BOMBER DOESN'T KNOW THEY LEFT
[000:02:47;050] BEHIND.
[000:02:47;517] >> Shep: WE'VE SCROLLED THROUGH
[000:02:49;352] THE PICTURES AGAIN.
[000:02:50;553] ARE THESE SERIAL NUMBERS ON THE
[000:02:52;422] PRESSURE COOKER IS THAT WHAT
[000:02:54;057] THEY ARE LOOKING AT WHEN THEY
[000:02:55;558] ZOOM IN?
[000:02:56;259] >> WE ARE EXAMINING THAT TO TRY
[000:02:57;694] TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THOSE
[000:02:59;195] NUMBERS ARE.
[000:02:59;896] WE TALKED TO WHO WE BELIEVE IS
[000:03:01;731] THE MANUFACTURER, BUT WE'RE
[000:03:02;966] STILL WORKING ON THAT.
[000:03:03;867] I THINK THERE IS SOME
[000:03:05;535] UNDERWRITING LABORATORY NUMBERS
[000:03:06;669] ON THERE.
[000:03:07;036] THERE IS SOME NUMBERS THAT MAY
[000:03:08;671] BE, AS YOU SAY, SERIAL NUMBERS.
[000:03:14;244] THE SAME THING THE F.B.I. AND
[000:03:17;247] ATF, WHO MANUFACTURED THIS
[000:03:18;781] PIECE.
[000:03:19;148] THEY GOT ENOUGH TO WORK WITH.
[000:03:20;583] THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
[000:03:21;818] TAKE THAT AND FIND OUT WHO
[000:03:23;152] MANUFACTURED IT, WHO SOLD IT AND
[000:03:27;390] WHERE.
[000:03:29;459] >> Shep: SO DALE, WHAT YOU ARE
[000:03:32;262] SAYING, AFTER THE BOMB EXPLODED
[000:03:35;231] THIS IS A LARGE CHUNK THAT ENDED
[000:03:37;467] UP AT THE CRIME SCENE AND THE
[000:03:39;836] REST OF IT CAUSED THE MAIMING
[000:03:43;606] AND DESTRUCTION.
[000:03:45;441] WHAT ARE YOUR SOUTH, FOREIGN?
[000:03:48;511] >> WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS
[000:03:51;915] REMINDED OF, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE
[000:03:53;483] OF THE BOMBER?
[000:03:54;417] WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO SAY?
[000:03:56;486] THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO
[000:03:58;087] SORT IS THROUGH RIGHT NOW.
[000:03:59;489] ONE OF THE THINGS THEY LOOK AT
[000:04:00;890] IS THE LOCATION, BOSTON MARATHON
[000:04:03;126] THE DATE ON TAX DAY, ON PATRIOTS
[000:04:05;662] DAY, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BEFORE
[000:04:07;297] THE ANNIVERSARY OF WACO.
[000:04:08;731] THESE ARE ALL IMAGES AND SYMBOLS
[000:04:11;801] THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE SIFTING
[000:04:13;403] THROUGH TO SEE IF THAT HAD
[000:04:15;204] ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MESSAGE
[000:04:16;572] THAT WAS PUT HERE WITH THESE TWO
[000:04:19;442] BOMBS AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.
[000:04:21;010] THEY CAN'T RULE OUT OVERSEAS,
[000:04:25;081] FOREIGN TERRORISM AND THEY
[000:04:26;849] LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT TRYING TO
[000:04:28;418] DETERMINE WHO WAS BEHIND THIS
[000:04:30;653] AND WHY.
[000:04:32;021] >> Shep: YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
[000:04:33;356] IN THE MOMENTS AFTER THIS
[000:04:34;757] BOMBING THAT WHEN THESE PRESSURE
[000:04:37;226] COOKERS EXPLODED THEY WOULD HAVE
[000:04:39;195] EXPLODED IN A LOT OF PIECES.
[000:04:40;563] WHAT THESE PICTURES SEEM TO
[000:04:43;166] INDICATE, VERY LARGE PIECES HELD
[000:04:44;834] TOGETHER.
[000:04:45;601] WE SEE NUMBERS IDENTIFYING
[000:04:47;737] MARKS.
[000:04:48;371] WE SEE MATERIALS THAT ARE
[000:04:49;505] CLEARLY, ACCORDING TO YOUR
[000:04:51;040] SOURCES, THE MATERIALS THAT HELD
[000:04:53;009] THIS BOMB AS IT SAT EITHER IN A
[000:04:56;646] TRASH CAN OR SIDE 56 CURB.
[000:04:58;748] THESE ARE VERY VALUABLE PIECES
[000:05:00;850] OF EVIDENCE WHICH I'M GETTING
[000:05:03;386] WILL BE ICONIC PIECES.
[000:05:06;689] I'M GETTING THERE ARE REPORTERS
[000:05:08;591] ALL OVER BOSTON ARE WONDERING
[000:05:11;194] HOW IN ATLANTA CAME ACROSS THIS?
[000:05:15;398] >> I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU,
[000:05:17;934] SHEPARD, I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO
[000:05:20;436] HAVE THAT CONVERSATION OFF AIR.
[000:05:22;739] >> Shep: UNDERSTOOD.
[000:05:25;975] DALE, PLEASE STAY WITH US.
[000:05:31;547] WE'RE BRINGING IN KATHERINE
[000:05:33;616] HERITAGE.
[000:05:34;484] KATHERINE, THE FIRST PICTURES OF
[000:05:36;819] THE REMAINS OF THIS BOMB, WHAT
[000:05:39;989] SOURCES ARE SEE SAYING WHAT SORT
[000:05:42;325] OF EVIDENTIARY VALUE.
[000:05:44;560] >> THEY HAVE A HIGH EVIDENTIARY
[000:05:47;030] VALUE, BUT WE KNOW TONIGHT AND
[000:05:48;631] HAD CONFIRMATION WITHIN THE LAST
[000:05:50;266] COUPLE OF HOURS, THESE BOMB
[000:05:53;069] COMPONENTS, THEY ARE BEING
[000:05:55;171] GATHERED UP AND SHIPPED DOWN TO
[000:05:58;341] WASHINGTON, D.C. AS TO WHAT IS
[000:06:01;411] KNOWN AS F.B.I. LAB DOWN IN
[000:06:04;914] QUANTICO.
[000:06:06;049] THEY PAINSTAKINGLY RECONSTRUCTED
[000:06:09;519] KIND OF WHAT YOU SEE WITH
[000:06:11;554] ARCHAEOLOGIST.
[000:06:12;455] THEY PIECE IT BACK TOGETHER AND
[000:06:15;291] THAT IS HOW THEY UNDERSTAND, THE
[000:06:18;127] MODEL AND MAKE AND THAT KIND OF
[000:06:20;129] INFORMATION THAT CAN ALLOW THEM
[000:06:21;564] TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY THE
[000:06:24;567] SOURCE OF PURCHASE.
[000:06:26;569] THAT IS THE KEY BECAUSE
[000:06:27;937] SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A WITNESS WHO
[000:06:29;906] CAN IDENTIFY A SUSPECT, SOMEONE
[000:06:31;541] WHO IS AGENTS GO A LITTLE
[000:06:33;076] STRANGE OR THEY MAY HAVE VIDEO
[000:06:35;111] IN THE STORE THAT CAN LOOK AT A
[000:06:37;480] SPECIFIC TIME FRAME AND FIND
[000:06:39;148] THAT INDIVIDUAL.
[000:06:40;149] SO WHAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT HERE IS
[000:06:41;417] THE FIRST PICTURES OF THE PUZZLE
[000:06:43;920] PIECES OF PUZZLE AND CRIME
[000:06:46;122] SCENE.
[000:06:46;823] NOW THEY ARE COMING DOWN TO
[000:06:48;024] WASHINGTON, GOING TO THAT CRIME
[000:06:49;926] LAB.
[000:06:50;693] THEY WILL BE RECEMENT BLD WITH A
[000:06:54;664] BROKEN PIECE OF HISTORY AND PUT
[000:06:56;232] IT TOGETHER.
[000:06:57;200] THEY IDENTIFY THE SOURCE AND
[000:06:58;201] THEN TRY AND IDENTIFY WHO
[000:06:59;769] PURCHASED IT.
[000:07:02;038] FROM THAT, VERY POSSIBLE LEADS.
[000:07:06;476] >> Shep: MORE QUICKLY YOU CAN DO
[000:07:08;444] THAT THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES OF
[000:07:09;946] GETTING AT WHOEVER PLACED IT.
[000:07:13;716] HOW QUICKLY THEY WERE ABLE TO
[000:07:16;285] PUT THIS TOGETHER AND WHETHER
[000:07:17;553] THEY ARE ON THE TRAIL OF
[000:07:19;455] ANYTHING AS A RESULT?
[000:07:20;857] >> WHAT WAYS TOLD BY VETERANS,
[000:07:23;059] THEY KNOW HOW THE BOMB WAS
[000:07:24;594] BUILT.
[000:07:25;361] THEY KNOW THIS GAME SO WELL.
[000:07:26;562] THEY HAVE SEEN SO MANY BOMBS.
[000:07:27;930] THEY HAVE DATABASES WITH ALL THE
[000:07:30;299] COMPONENTS WE'VE SEEN HERE IN
[000:07:31;701] THE PICTURES AND MORE.
[000:07:32;702] WE ONLY HAVE SOME OF THE
[000:07:33;870] PICTURES AND NOT ALL OF THEM.
[000:07:35;138] THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST BOMB.
[000:07:37;640] THEY'VE GOT ALL THIS EVIDENCE
[000:07:39;075] TOGETHER AND ALL THIS
[000:07:40;576] EXPERIENCE.
[000:07:41;477] NOW, IT'S A MATTER AS WE HEARD
[000:07:43;479] GOING OUT AND FINDING IT.
[000:07:46;749] >> Shep: KATHERINE, IT'S MY
[000:07:49;285] GUESS THAT THAT PROCESS HAPPENED
[000:07:51;020] VERY QUICKLY.
[000:07:51;621] THEY WERE ABLE TO CLEAR THAT
[000:07:54;423] AREA RIGHT AWAY, ALL THE AREA
[000:07:56;425] WAS SEALED AND TAGGED.
[000:07:57;760] YOU GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS, I
[000:07:59;695] DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE OUTSIDE
[000:08:01;597] THE REALM OF THE OBVIOUS THEY
[000:08:03;332] WOULD SEND THIS RIGHT THERE AND
[000:08:04;800] BEGIN THE PROCESS ALMOST
[000:08:07;803] IMMEDIATELY.
[000:08:08;671] >> Reporter: THEY WILL BEGIN
[000:08:09;805] ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BUT WHAT I
[000:08:11;807] WOULD ADD AND WHAT JUMPED OUT TO
[000:08:14;377] SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS ON
[000:08:15;578] COMMITTEES THAT ARE BEING
[000:08:16;546] BRIEFED ON THE INVESTIGATION WAS
[000:08:18;047] THE WAY IN WHICH THE F.B.I.
[000:08:19;282] SEEMED TO ISSUE ALMOST A CRY FOR
[000:08:21;384] HELP FROM THE PUBLIC FOR VIDEO
[000:08:23;519] AND FOR STILL PICTURES THAT WILL
[000:08:26;289] HELP THEM TRY AND PUT AN
[000:08:28;991] INDIVIDUAL AT THAT SCENE MOMENTS
[000:08:31;127] BEFORE THE BLAST WHEN THE BAG
[000:08:33;162] WAS PLACED.
[000:08:33;963] THAT IS THE KEY.
[000:08:34;730] IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR
[000:08:36;232] A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
[000:08:37;600] IT HAD TO BE PLACED, WE HAVE
[000:08:42;638] SEEN A NUMBER OF IMAGES WITH A
[000:08:44;740] BAG IN FRONT OF THOSE
[000:08:47;543] BARRICADES.
[000:08:48;477] YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THAT VIDEO
[000:08:49;812] AND THE INDIVIDUALS.
[000:08:51;247] FINDING A PIECE OF EVIDENCE LIKE
[000:08:53;149] THIS THAT YOU CAN PIECE TOGETHER
[000:08:56;619] YOU'VE GOT TWO TRACKS IN THE
[000:08:58;854] INVESTIGATION.
[000:08:59;655] YOU HAVE THIS WHERE IT CAME FROM
[000:09:01;791] WHO MADE IT THE TIME FRAME,
[000:09:03;826] MAYBE IT WAS MADE TWO OR THREE
[000:09:05;461] YEARS AGO AND THE PERSON HAS
[000:09:07;330] BEEN HANGING ON FOR THAT LONG.
[000:09:08;998] THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT A HAS
[000:09:11;067] TO BE ANSWERED.
[000:09:12;034] IS THERE DNA, THERE ARE
[000:09:15;404] FINGERPRINTS THAT ARE LEFT.
[000:09:16;606] HAIR OR RESIDUE IN THE
[000:09:20;509] EXPLOSIVES THEMSELVES.
[000:09:24;513] >> Shep: WE CAN ONLY PRESUME IF
[000:09:29;151] THERE IS A DNA ON THERE, THEY
[000:09:30;586] KNOW IT.
[000:09:31;387] IF THERE IS DNA ON THERE THEY
[000:09:33;189] ARE ACTING ON IT.
[000:09:35;191] KATHERINE, AND DALE FROM FOX 5
[000:09:39;028] IN ATLANTA WITH THE SCOOP OF THE
[000:09:43;766] DAY AND OF THIS STORY.
[000:09:45;001] THE F.B.I. HAS PICTURES WHAT
[000:09:46;469] THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE BOMB THAT
[000:09:49;038] BLEW UPRIGHT THERE AT THE FINISH
[000:09:50;906] LINE OFF THE BOSTON MARATHON.
[000:09:52;875] PICTURES WITH NUMBERS AND
[000:09:54;610] ETCHINGS WITH THE MATERIAL STILL
[000:09:55;978] AROUND THEM IN SOME PARTS.
[000:09:57;747] ALL THE DAMAGE THAT IT DID AND
[000:09:59;215] THE LIVES THAT IT TOOK ON THE
[000:10:01;450] STREETS AT THE FINISH LINE.
[000:10:02;585] YET THESE LARGE PIECES OF THAT
[000:10:05;721] BOMB REMAIN.
[000:10:07;056] COURTESY OF FOX 5 IN ATLANTA.
[000:10:09;959] DALE RUSSELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[000:10:12;094] WE'LL BE BACK TO YOU.
[000:10:14;997] A GUT-WRENCHING LOOK AT THE
[000:10:18;200] YOUNGEST VICTIM KILL IN THE
[000:10:19;568] ATTACK.

[000:10:21;637] PHOTOGRAPH HOLDING A POSTER
[000:10:22;972] READING, NO MORE HURTING PEOPLE,
[000:10:25;274] PLEASE.
[000:10:26;475] ACCORDING TO BOSTON GLOBE, HE
[000:10:29;578] HAD JUST HUGGED HIS DAD WHEN IS
[000:10:31;347] THE FIRST BOMB EXPLODED.
[000:10:34;383] MOURNERS LEFT CANDLES AND
[000:10:36;752] FLOWERS AND ON THIS DRIVEWAY
[000:10:39;255] SOMEONE WROTE THE WORD PEACE.
[000:10:43;993] MOTHER AND SISTER ARE STILL IN
[000:10:46;896] SERIOUS CONDITION AND THE FATHER
[000:10:49;432] IS IN SHOCK.
[000:10:51;200] >> I SAW HIM GETTING GET OUT OF
[000:10:52;568] THE CAR.
[000:10:53;002] I SAID -- OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU
[000:10:56;572] OKAY?
[000:10:57;073] >> HE DIDN'T EVEN ANSWER ME.
[000:10:58;474] HIS FRIEND TOLD ME WHAT HAD
[000:11:00;676] HAPPENED.
[000:11:01;277] I WAS IN SHOCK AND HORRIFIED.
[000:11:04;513] >> Shep: THAT DAD RELEASED A
[000:11:07;049] STATEMENT, I QUOTE, WE THANK OUR
[000:11:08;951] FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
[000:11:10;086] THOSE WE KNOW AND THOSE WE HAVE

[000:11:16;192] PRAYERS.
[000:11:16;625] PRAY FOR MY FAMILY AS WE
[000:11:18;060] REMEMBER MARTIN.
[000:11:20;062] MEANTIME, WE'RE HEARING MORE

[000:11:23;599] FATALITY.
[000:11:24;700] CRYSTAL CAMPBELL.
[000:11:28;204] >> OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN.
[000:11:36;479] EVERYBODY THAT KNEW HER LOVED
[000:11:40;316] HER.
[000:11:44;053] SHE LOVED EVERYBODY.
[000:11:45;755] >> SHE HAD A HEART OF GOLD.
[000:11:48;023] WE ARE LEARNING THAT MOM THOUGHT

[000:35:21;202] ONTO THE GROUND.
[000:35:22;236] I RAN DOWN THE STAIRS AND I RAN
[000:35:23;905] ON TO A CARPET OF GLASS AND
