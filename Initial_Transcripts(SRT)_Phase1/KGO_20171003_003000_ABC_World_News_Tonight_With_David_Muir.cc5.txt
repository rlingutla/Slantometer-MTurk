[000:17:22;458] of people fell short,
[000:17:24;493] of even the average
[000:17:24;493] length of retirement.
[000:17:26;495] We have to think about
[000:17:26;495] not when we expect to live to,
[000:17:29;732] but when we could live to.
[000:17:31;166] Let's plan for income that lasts
[000:17:31;166] all our years in retirement.
[000:17:35;337] Prudential.
[000:17:35;337] Bring your challenges.
[000:17:38;941] Essential for vinyl,
[000:17:40;442] but maybe not for people with
[000:17:40;442] rheumatoid arthritis.
[000:17:43;312] Because there are options.
[000:17:44;847] Like an "Unjection™".
[000:17:46;281] XELJANZ XR.
[000:17:47;516] A once daily pill for adults
[000:17:48;951] with moderate to severe RA
[000:17:50;586] for whom methotrexate
[000:17:51;653] did not work well.
[000:17:52;654] XELJANZ XR can reduce pain,
[000:17:54;757] swelling and further
[000:17:54;757] joint damage,
[000:17:56;625] even without methotrexate.
[000:17:58;227] XELJANZ XR can lower your
[000:17:58;227] ability to fight infections,
[000:18:01;230] including tuberculosis.
[000:18:02;798] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:18:02;798] infections, lymphoma
[000:18:05;234] and other cancers have happened.
[000:18:06;935] Don't start XELJANZ XR
[000:18:06;935] if you have an infection.
[000:18:09;571] Tears in the stomach
[000:18:09;571] or intestines,
[000:18:11;340] low blood cell counts
[000:18:12;541] and higher liver tests
[000:18:13;642] and cholesterol levels
[000:18:13;642] have happened.
[000:18:15;410] Your doctor should perform blood
[000:18:15;410] tests before you start
[000:18:17;946] and while taking XELJANZ XR,
[000:18:19;782] and monitor certain liver tests.
[000:18:21;617] Tell your doctor if you
[000:18:21;617] were in a region
[000:18:23;152] where fungal infections
[000:18:23;152] are common
[000:18:24;753] and if you have had TB,
[000:18:25;921] hepatitis B or C,
[000:18:27;156] or are prone to infections.
[000:18:28;857] Needles.
[000:18:29;558] A must for vinyl.
[000:18:30;826] But for you,
[000:18:31;693] one pill a day
[000:18:32;561] may provide symptom relief.
[000:18:34;196] Ask your doctor
[000:18:34;196] about XELJANZ XR.
[000:18:36;598] An "Unjection™".

[000:20:53;201] At work, at home...
[000:20:54;636] even on the escalator.
[000:20:55;804] That can be hard on

[000:20:58;073] so now she does it
[000:20:58;073] with Dr. Scholl's orthotics.

[000:25:18;600] >>> AND WHAT THE SHERIFF HERE
[000:25:19;201] REVEALED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO,
[000:25:20;936] IN A MOMENT.
[000:25:21;269] ot
[000:25:22;437] from our eyes every day.
[000:25:23;838] I should know.
[000:25:24;873] I have Chronic Dry Eye
[000:25:26;508] caused by reduced
[000:25:26;508] tear production
[000:25:28;276] due to inflammation.
[000:25:29;511] So I use RESTASIS MultiDose®.
[000:25:31;813] It helps me make more
[000:25:31;813] of my own tears,
[000:25:34;282] with continued use,
[000:25:35;717] twice a day, every day.
[000:25:37;652] It's also what I prescribe
[000:25:37;652] to my patients
[000:25:39;955] who have this condition.
[000:25:41;256] RESTASIS MultiDose®
[000:25:42;624] helps increase your
[000:25:42;624] eyes' natural ability
[000:25:44;292] to produce tears,
[000:25:45;493] which may be reduced
[000:25:45;493] by inflammation
[000:25:47;362] due to Chronic Dry Eye.
[000:25:49;030] RESTASIS MultiDose® did
[000:25:49;030] not increase tear production
[000:25:51;399] in patients using
[000:25:51;399] anti-inflammatory eye drops
[000:25:53;868] or tear duct plugs.
[000:25:55;337] To help avoid eye injury
[000:25:55;337] and contamination,
[000:25:57;672] do not touch the bottle tip
[000:25:57;672] to your eye or other surfaces.
[000:26:00;976] Wait 15 minutes after use
[000:26:02;577] before inserting
[000:26:02;577] contact lenses.
[000:26:04;713] The most common side effect
[000:26:05;947] is a temporary
[000:26:05;947] burning sensation.
[000:26:09;417] Ask your eye doctor about

[000:26:55;964] Yeah, my dad says our

[000:27:06;241] Some I deserve
[000:27:07;542] Others I don't
[000:27:08;877] But in the end

[000:27:23;058] Proof of less joint pain
[000:27:25;827] and clearer skin.
[000:27:27;429] This is my body of proof that I
[000:27:27;429] can take on psoriatic
[000:27:30;465] arthritis with HUMIRA.
[000:27:33;001] HUMIRA works by targeting and
[000:27:33;001] helping to block a specific
[000:27:36;137] source of inflammation that
[000:27:36;137] contributes to both joint and
[000:27:38;840] skin symptoms.
[000:27:40;141] It's proven to help relieve
[000:27:40;141] pain, stop further joint damage,
[000:27:43;244] and clear skin in many adults.
[000:27:44;846] HUMIRA is the #1
[000:27:44;846] prescribed biologic
[000:27:46;981] for psoriatic arthritis.
[000:27:48;950] HUMIRA can lower your ability to
[000:27:48;950] fight infections,
[000:27:51;119] including tuberculosis.
[000:27:52;220] Serious, sometimes fatal
[000:27:52;220] infections and cancers,
[000:27:54;856] including lymphoma, have
[000:27:54;856] happened; as have blood, liver,
[000:27:57;058] and nervous system problems,
[000:27:57;058] serious allergic reactions,
[000:27:59;060] and new or worsening heart
[000:27:59;060] failure.
[000:28:01;096] Before treatment, get tested for
