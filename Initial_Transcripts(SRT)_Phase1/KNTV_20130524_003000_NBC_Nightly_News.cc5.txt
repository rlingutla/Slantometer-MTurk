[000:01:12;038] I'M ANN CURRY, IN TONIGHT FOR
[000:01:12;806] BRIAN.
[000:01:13;807] THERE WAS A MAJOR TURNING POINT
[000:01:14;607] LATE TODAY IN THE AMERICAN
[000:01:15;275] INSTITUTION THAT'S BEEN AROUND
[000:01:18;812] FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS AND A
[000:01:20;780] PART OF THE LIVES OF MORE THAN
[000:01:22;582] 100 MILLION AMERICAN CHILDREN.
[000:01:24;484] AFTER MONTHS OF CONSIDERATION,
[000:01:25;351] ABOUT AN INITIATIVE THAT DIVIDED
[000:01:28;054] ITS RANKS DURING A PASSIONATE
[000:01:29;823] DEBATE, TONIGHT THE BOY SCOUTS
[000:01:30;790] OF AMERICA HAS VOTED TO ALLOW
[000:01:32;358] OPENLY GAY MEMBERS.
[000:01:33;927] NBC'S PETE WILLIAMS BROKE THE
[000:01:34;928] NEWS BACK IN JANUARY THAT THE

[000:01:40;266] PETE, GOOD EVENING.
[000:01:44;938] >> Reporter: ANN, GOOD EVENING.
[000:01:46;439] THIS IS A BIG CHANGE FOR AN
[000:01:47;107] ORGANIZATION THAT HAS FOUGHT FOR
[000:01:47;841] DECADES TO PRESERVE THE STRICT
[000:01:49;542] BAN ON ADMITTING GAY SCOUTS AND
[000:01:50;977] SCOUTING OFFICIALS SAY TONIGHT
[000:01:53;046] IT PASSED HANDILY WITH 60% OF
[000:01:54;447] THE VOTE OF ITS NATIONAL
[000:01:55;548] COUNCIL.
[000:01:55;882] SO, THIS MEANS THE LONG-STANDING
[000:01:59;886] POLICY WILL BE LIFTED THAT HAD
[000:02:02;856] BANNED GAY SCOUTS, BUT IT
[000:02:03;990] REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR BANNING
[000:02:05;024] GAY SCOUT LEADERS.
[000:02:07;193] THE VOTE ENDS A WRENCHING
[000:02:08;328] PROCESS THAT STARTED FOUR MONTHS
[000:02:09;062] AGO WHEN BOY SCOUT LEADERS
[000:02:10;029] REVEALED THEY WERE CONSIDERING A
[000:02:11;164] CHANGE.
[000:02:11;998] >> THIS ISSUE IS A DEFINING
[000:02:13;733] ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY AND OUR
[000:02:16;002] STATE AND OUR SOCIETY.
[000:02:17;403] >> Reporter: THE DECISION CAME
[000:02:18;271] TODAY AT THIS CONFERENCE CENTER
[000:02:21;241] NEAR DALLAS, A MEETING OF
[000:02:23;676] SCOUTING'S 1,400-MEMBER NATIONAL
[000:02:26;312] COUNCIL, AFTER THE BOY SCOUTS
[000:02:27;447] PROPOSED IN JANUARY TO LET LOCAL
[000:02:29;516] TROOPS DECIDE THE ISSUE FOR
[000:02:30;717] THEMSELVES, GENERATING A STORM
[000:02:31;718] OF PETITIONS FROM SOME PARENTS
[000:02:33;019] WHO THOUGHT THAT WENT TOO FAR
[000:02:34;621] AND OTHERS NOT FAR ENOUGH.
[000:02:38;525] TODAY THEY VOTED TO END THE BAN
[000:02:41;594] ON GAY SCOUTS BUT CONTINUED THE
[000:02:43;163] BAN ON GAY ADULTS AS SCOUT
[000:02:44;731] LEADERS.
[000:02:45;064] >> THIS IS A CHALLENGING COMPLEX
[000:02:47;500] AREA.
[000:02:47;800] IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR A
[000:02:48;668] LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT WE'RE MOVING
[000:02:50;803] FORWARD TOGETHER, AND WITHIN OUR
[000:02:52;338] MOVEMENT, EVERYONE AGREES ONE
[000:02:54;140] THING -- NO MATTER HOW YOU FEEL
[000:02:55;441] ABOUT THIS ISSUE, KIDS ARE
[000:02:56;209] BETTER OFF IN SCOUTING.
[000:02:59;546] >> Reporter: CHURCH GROUPS
[000:03:00;313] SPONSOR 70% OF ALL LOCAL SCOUT
[000:03:02;348] UNITS, AND MANY FOUGHT TO KEEP
[000:03:03;616] THE BAN.
[000:03:05;118] >> AND FOCUSING ON BUILDING
[000:03:05;818] STRONG, YOUNG MEN AND NOT
[000:03:07;153] GETTING AN ORGANIZATION TURNED
[000:03:08;588] INTO A SEXUAL AGENDA ITEM OF A
[000:03:11;191] SPECIAL INTEREST ORGANIZATION.
[000:03:11;958] >> Reporter: BUT THE MORMON
[000:03:14;227] CHURCH, IT SPONSORS ONE-QUARTER
[000:03:16;095] OF THE NATION'S SCOUTING UNITS,
[000:03:17;664] SIGNALED IT WOULD NOT OPPOSE THE
[000:03:18;898] ADMISSION OF GAY SCOUTS.
[000:03:19;732] A SURVEY CONDUCTED FOR THE BOY
[000:03:21;334] SCOUTS FOUND THAT 48% OF PARENTS
[000:03:23;303] OF CURRENT SCOUTS SUPPORT THE
[000:03:25;104] BAN, DOWN FROM 57% THREE YEARS
[000:03:27;874] AGO.
[000:03:28;141] BUT A MAJORITY OF BOY SCOUTS
[000:03:30;577] THEMSELVES, 56%, OPPOSE THE BAN
[000:03:32;111] ON ADMITTING GAY SCOUTS.
[000:03:34;247] 42% OPPOSING IT STRONGLY.
[000:03:36;282] CHUCK AND RHONDA MONTERA OF
[000:03:39;185] DENVER ARE AMONG PARENTS IN
[000:03:40;086] FAVOR OF A CHANGE.
[000:03:41;387] THEY HAVE TWO SONS IN THE CUB
[000:03:43;656] SCOUTS.
[000:03:43;990] >> WHEN WE LOOK 50 YEARS IN THE
[000:03:45;258] FUTURE, IT WILL BE LIKE CIVIL
[000:03:46;559] RIGHTS, AND IT'S LIKE, WHAT TOOK
[000:03:47;327] US SO LONG?
[000:03:49;696] >> Reporter: THE SCOUTS SAY THE
[000:03:50;897] NEW POLICY TAKES EFFECT JANUARY
[000:03:52;632] 1st OF 2014, WHICH SCOUTING
[000:03:55;001] OFFICIALS SAY WILL GIVE LOCAL
[000:03:56;102] UNITS THE TIME TO ADJUST.
[000:03:57;437] NOW, AS FOR CONSIDERING A CHANGE
[000:03:58;605] IN THE BAN ON GAY SCOUT LEADERS,
[000:04:02;508] THE ORGANIZATION SAYS THIS WAS A
[000:04:04;010] LENGTHY PROCESS AND IT HAS NO
[000:04:05;411] PLANS FOR FURTHER REVIEW.
[000:04:06;479] ANN?
[000:04:06;746] >> ALL RIGHT, PETE WILLIAMS

[000:04:16;923] AGAIN, FAIR WARNING, THESE
[000:04:17;624] IMAGES ARE DIFFICULT TO TAKE.
[000:04:19;025] A BRITISH SOLDIER WAS ATTACKED
[000:04:20;994] AND KILLED IN THE STREETS AS WE
[000:04:24;697] NOW KNOW, HE WAS A YOUNG HUSBAND
[000:04:25;598] AND FATHER.
[000:04:26;466] WE'RE ALSO HEARING FROM THE
[000:04:27;300] BRAVE WOMAN WHO STARED DOWN THE
[000:04:28;034] MAN WITH THE KNIFE.
[000:04:28;701] WE GET THE LATEST NOW FROM
[000:04:31;237] NBC'S MICHELLE KOSINSKI IN

[000:04:37;977] DAY-LONG PROCESSION, TRIBUTES
[000:04:38;711] AND RAW EMOTION.
[000:04:44;017] THE VICTIM, VICIOUSLY HACKED TO
[000:04:47;487] DEATH ON THE STREET, HAS NOW
[000:04:48;221] BEEN IDENTIFIED.
[000:04:49;889] 25-YEAR-OLD BRITISH SOLDIER LEE
[000:04:51;591] RIGBY SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN, THE
[000:04:53;326] FATHER OF A 2-YEAR-OLD SON.
[000:04:55;161] IN A STATEMENT, HIS FAMILY SAID
[000:04:57;297] "LEE WAS LOVELY.
[000:04:58;064] HE WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR
[000:04:59;332] ANYBODY.
[000:04:59;666] ALL HE WANTED TO DO FROM WHEN HE
[000:05:02;835] WAS A LITTLE BOY WAS BE IN THE
[000:05:04;671] ARMY."
[000:05:04;971] AND THAT IS WHY, ONE OF THE TWO
[000:05:06;806] SUSPECTS TOLD ONLOOKERS, THEY
[000:05:08;107] TARGETED HIM.
[000:05:09;275] >> WE MUST FIGHT THEM AS THEY
[000:05:10;643] FIGHT US, AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A
[000:05:12;278] TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.
[000:05:16;616] >> Reporter: THIS SUSPECT HAS
[000:05:18;017] BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WAS BORN IN

[000:05:25;892] OF A LONDON POLICE STATION IN
[000:05:26;592] 2007.
[000:05:30;530] TODAY IT EMERGED THAT BOTH
[000:05:31;597] SUSPECTS WERE KNOWN TO BRITISH
[000:05:32;832] SECURITY SERVICES PRIOR TO NOW,
[000:05:33;966] BUT SOURCES SAY THERE WAS NO
[000:05:35;268] INDICATION THEY WERE PLANNING
[000:05:36;269] ANY ATTACK.
[000:05:37;103] TERROR ANALYSTS SAY LONE
[000:05:39;105] WOLF-STYLE OPERATIONS ARE
[000:05:40;006] BECOMING THE NEW FACE OF AL
[000:05:40;773] QAEDA-INSPIRED ATTACKS.
[000:05:42;542] >> NO LONGER THE LARGE-SCALE,
[000:05:45;144] SOPHISTICATED PLOTS FROM
[000:05:46;846] OVERSEAS, BUT INSTEAD, VERY
[000:05:49;248] UNSOPHISTICATED AND SIMPLE
[000:05:50;650] ATTACKS, WHICH CAN STILL VERY
[000:05:52;218] MUCH AFFECT THE PSYCHE OF CITIES

[000:06:04;063] ONE EXTRAORDINARY CITIZEN WHO
[000:06:05;765] WAS UNAFRAID, SEEN HERE TRYING

[000:06:13;106] >> JUST KEEPING HIM CALM.

[000:06:37;864] THE PRESIDENT TODAY ISSUED NEW
[000:06:38;731] GUIDELINES FOR DRONE STRIKES
[000:06:39;899] AGAINST SUSPECTED TERRORISTS
[000:06:43;136] WHILE MAKING AN IMPASSIONED

[000:06:48;574] >> Reporter: ANN, GOOD EVENING
[000:06:49;475] TO YOU.
[000:06:50;276] TODAY THE PRESIDENT REFINED HIS
[000:06:51;444] IDEA THAT THE SO-CALLED WAR ON
[000:06:52;578] TERROR LAUNCHED BY THE BUSH
[000:06:53;713] ADMINISTRATION IS NO LONGER
[000:06:56;449] RELEVANT, INSTEAD PRESENTING A
[000:06:57;650] MUCH MORE NARROW DEFINITION OF
[000:06:58;684] AMERICAN COUNTERTERRORISM.
[000:07:01;154] DECLARING AMERICA AT A
[000:07:02;889] CROSSROADS, PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:07:04;023] TODAY REFRAMED THE FIGHT AGAINST
[000:07:05;158] TERRORISM AND THE EVOLVING
[000:07:07;160] THREAT NOW FACING THE U.S.
[000:07:08;561] >> WE MUST DEFINE OUR EFFORT NOT
[000:07:13;466] AS A BOUNDLESS, GLOBAL WAR ON
[000:07:15;535] TERROR, BUT RATHER AS A SERIES
[000:07:16;969] OF PERSISTENT, TARGETED EFFORTS
[000:07:19;572] TO DISMANTLE SPECIFIC NETWORKS
[000:07:21;307] OF VIOLENT EXTREMISTS THAT
[000:07:21;974] THREATEN AMERICA.
[000:07:23;709] OUR NATION IS STILL THREATENED
[000:07:29;081] BY TERRORISTS.
[000:07:30;049] FROM BENGHAZI TO BOSTON, WE HAVE
[000:07:31;784] BEEN TRAGICALLY REMINDED OF THAT
[000:07:35;354] TRUTH.

[000:07:39;292] THOROUGH DEFENSE OF AMERICA'S
[000:07:41;394] SECRET WAR, THE PRESIDENT LAID
[000:07:42;829] OUT CLEAR AND NARROW GUIDELINES
[000:07:43;596] FOR DRONE STRIKES, ARGUING THEY
[000:07:47;233] ARE LEGAL AND CAREFULLY
[000:07:47;834] CONSIDERED.
[000:07:48;367] >> BEFORE ANY STRIKE IS TAKEN
[000:07:49;502] THERE MUST BE NEAR CERTAINTY
[000:07:50;203] THAT NO CIVILIANS WILL BE KILLED
[000:07:52;839] OR INJURED, THE HIGHEST STANDARD
[000:07:53;706] WE CAN SET.
[000:07:54;407] >> Reporter: BUT THERE'S A CHECK
[000:08:00;179] ON THE PRESIDENT'S POWER BY
[000:08:00;847] CONGRESS.
[000:08:01;547] >> IT'S BRIEFED ON EVERY STRIKE
[000:08:02;281] THAT AMERICA TAKES.
[000:08:02;982] EVERY STRIKE.
[000:08:03;816] >> Reporter: AND THAT THEY WORK.
[000:08:05;618] >> SIMPLY PUT, THESE STRIKES
[000:08:07;053] HAVE SAVED LIVES.
[000:08:08;254] >> Reporter: TO MAKE HIS
[000:08:11;190] POLICIES MORE TRANSPARENT, THE
[000:08:11;991] PRESIDENT IS TRANSFERRING MORE
[000:08:13;125] CONTROL OF THE DRONE PROGRAM
[000:08:15;461] HE ALSO RENEWED HIS PLEDGE TO
[000:08:18;531] SHUT DOWN GUANTANAMO BAY,
[000:08:20;066] ANNOUNCING AN END ON THE BAN TO
[000:08:21;767] SEND DETAINEES TO YEMEN, CALLING
[000:08:23;336] ON SOME INMATES TO BE MOVED TO
[000:08:25;071] U.S. PRISONS AND TRIED IN
[000:08:26;405] CIVILIAN COURTS.
[000:08:27;306] THE MOVE WOULD SAVE THE U.S.
[000:08:28;441] NEARLY $1 MILLION A YEAR FOR
[000:08:29;909] EACH OF THE 166 INMATES, 103 OF
[000:08:32;578] THEM NOW STAGING AN EXTENDED
[000:08:34;280] HUNGER STRIKE.

[000:08:37;650] WITH WHERE HE WAS IN THE
[000:08:38;618] NATIONAL DEBATE, WANTEDED TO
[000:08:40;486] TAKE CONTROL OF THE NARRATIVE
[000:08:41;854] AND THEN CONSOLIDATE THESE
[000:08:43;956] ISSUES OVER GUANTANAMO AND
[000:08:45;358] DRONES AND PUT HIMSELF WHERE HE
[000:08:46;659] WANTS TO BE.
[000:08:47;093] >> I KNOW THE POLITICS ARE HARD,
[000:08:50;930] BUT HISTORY WILL CAST A HARSH
[000:08:53;366] JUDGMENT ON THIS ASPECT OF OUR
[000:08:55;535] FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND
[000:08:56;235] THOSE OF US WHO FAIL TO END IT.
[000:08:58;204] >> Reporter: THAT JUDGMENT
[000:08:58;971] VOICED BY AN ANTIWAR ACTIVIST,
[000:09:00;840] WHO REPEATEDLY DISRUPTED THE
[000:09:02;842] PRESIDENT.
[000:09:03;242] >> WHY WAS HE KILLED?

[000:09:05;511] RENDERING THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
[000:09:07;847] SPEECHLESS FOR 30 SECONDS.
[000:09:08;848] >> THE VOICE OF THAT WOMAN IS
[000:09:11;484] WORTH PAYING ATTENTION TO.
[000:09:13;452] THESE ARE TOUGH ISSUES, AND THE
[000:09:17;590] SUGGESTION THAT WE CAN GLOSS
[000:09:19;325] OVER THEM IS WRONG.
