[000:01:17;043] TONIGHT, THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW
[000:01:18;044] DEVELOPMENTS TO REPORT.
[000:01:19;712] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL
[000:01:20;914] RELEASE SOLID EVIDENCE THAT THE
[000:01:22;615] SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ORDERED A MASS
[000:01:25;051] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK ON ITS
[000:01:25;885] OWN PEOPLE LAST WEEK.
[000:01:27;320] ON THE DIPLOMATIC SIDE,
[000:01:28;922] INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR AN
[000:01:29;622] ATTACK IS GROWING.
[000:01:32;559] AND FROM THE PENTAGON, WORD THAT

[000:01:35;929] READY TO LAUNCH WHEN THE ORDER
[000:01:36;663] IS GIVEN.
[000:01:41;367] THIS FAST MOVING CHAIN OF EVENTS
[000:01:42;102] ALL TOUCHED OFF BY THOSE
[000:01:42;735] HORRIFIC IMAGES OF DEAD AND
[000:01:43;436] DYING CIVILIANS THAT SHOCKED THE

[000:02:08;194] AND LESTER, FAIR WARNING, THESE
[000:02:08;962] LATEST PICTURES ARE VERY HARD TO
[000:02:09;696] WATCH.
[000:02:11;731] THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR.
[000:02:13;766] A WAR THAT KILLS BABIES
[000:02:15;702] SILENTLY, SUDDENLY, BATHING THEM
[000:02:18;238] NOT IN BLOOD, BUT IN THE TEARS
[000:02:18;972] OF A DOCTOR.
[000:02:21;274] GHASTLY IMAGES OF LAST WEEK'S
[000:02:21;975] ATTACK.

[000:02:52;972] CONTINUED THE DRUM BEAT TO
[000:02:54;073] PUNISH BASHAR AL ASSAD.
[000:02:55;041] >> THERE'S NO DOUBT WHO IS
[000:02:56;009] RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS USE
[000:02:57;110] OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.
[000:02:59;512] THE SYRIAN REGIME.

[000:03:14;761] TYING THE ATTACK TO THE REGIME.
[000:03:15;495] PLUS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.
[000:03:16;095] >> WE KNOW THAT THE REGIME
[000:03:17;030] MAINTAINS CUSTODY OF THE
[000:03:18;331] CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA, AND
[000:03:21;634] USES THE TYPES OF ROCKETS THAT
[000:03:23;069] WERE USED TO DELIVER CHEMICAL
[000:03:24;170] WEAPONS ON AUGUST 21st.

[000:03:38;451] CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE ASSAD
[000:03:39;319] REGIME.

[000:03:46;926] TAKE A CALL FROM THE BRITISH

[000:03:49;128] PUTIN IS STILL BLOCKING U.N.

[000:03:54;567] ASSAD GOVERNMENT FOR THE
[000:03:55;301] CHEMICAL ATTACK.
[000:03:56;603] WHEN THE ORDER COMES, THE

[000:04:19;993] WE'LL TRY TO HIT PLANES ON THE
[000:04:20;727] TARMAC.
[000:04:21;060] >> Reporter: WHAT ABOUT
[000:04:21;661] UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES?
[000:04:22;428] THE U.S. MILITARY PLAN IS NOT TO
[000:04:23;630] GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIVIL
[000:04:25;798] WAR AND TRY TO TOPPLE ASSAD.
[000:04:32;171] BUT OPPOSITION LEADER GENERAL

[000:04:36;542] WILL SEIZE THE CHANCE TO TRY TO

[000:05:14;947] FOCUSED ON OTHER THINGS, LIKE
[000:05:16;249] THE DWINDLING DAYS OF SUMMER.
[000:05:22;188] BUT IS THERE SUPPORT FOR A
[000:05:22;855] MILITARY STRIKE?
[000:05:23;456] NBC'S KEVIN TIBBLES WENT TO THE
[000:05:24;524] MINNESOTA STATE FAIR TODAY TO
[000:05:25;358] SEE HOW ALL THIS IS PLAYING FAR
[000:05:26;125] FROM WASHINGTON.

[000:05:55;388] ABOUT ALLEGED CHEMICAL ATTACKS
[000:05:56;122] IN SYRIA.

[000:05:57;623] THAT'S THE QUESTION NOBODY HAS
[000:05:58;358] THE ANSWER.
[000:05:58;758] >> CHEMICAL WEAPONS?
[000:05:59;292] >> THAT'S AWFUL.
[000:05:59;759] NOBODY SHOULD USE THAT.
[000:06:00;360] >> Reporter: SHOULD THE UNITED
[000:06:01;094] STATES DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
[000:06:01;794] >> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DO
[000:06:02;528] SOMETHING, BECAUSE I THINK IF WE
[000:06:03;262] DON'T DO SOMETHING, IT'S GOING
[000:06:03;996] TO CONTINUE.
[000:06:04;397] >> SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO
[000:06:04;997] SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
[000:06:05;965] >> TO ME IT SHOULD BE WITH THE
[000:06:07;533] ALLIES, OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO
[000:06:08;868] GET INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING WE
[000:06:09;969] DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN.
[000:06:12;605] >> Reporter: MANY FAIR GOERS SAY
[000:06:14;207] THEY'RE TORN ABOUT WHAT AMERICA
[000:06:14;974] SHOULD DO.
[000:06:16;609] >> WE GET INVOLVED IN SO MANY
[000:06:22;382] PLACES WE REALLY DON'T BELONG.
[000:06:23;349] >> Reporter: OTHERS ARE DEAD SET
[000:06:24;117] AGAINST ANY INVOLVEMENT.
[000:06:24;717] >> WE HAVE PLENTY OF OUR OWN
[000:06:25;418] BATTLES TO BE FOUGHT.

[000:06:29;655] MIDDLE EASTERN CONFLICT RIGHT
[000:06:30;390] NOW.
[000:06:32;558] >> I THINK WE'RE INVOLVED IN
[000:06:33;659] ENOUGH STUFF OVERSEAS, YOU KNOW?
[000:06:36;329] TRYING TO BRING THE TROOPS HOME
[000:06:38;030] AND LET SOMEONE ELSE DEAL WITH
[000:06:38;765] IT.

[000:06:54;046] OVERSEAS.
[000:06:55;681] THEY ARE PATRIOTIC, BUT THEY ARE

[000:06:58;217] MILITARY CONFLICT.
[000:07:00;052] LESTER?
[000:07:00;787] >> KEVIN TIBBLES, THANK YOU.
[000:07:02;455] >>> NOW TO THE MASSIVE AIR AND
[000:07:04;657] GROUND WAR IN THE WEST AGAINST
[000:07:05;625] ONE OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN
[000:07:06;959] THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA,
[000:07:09;228] CONTINUING TO EXPLODE OUT OF
[000:07:09;929] CONTROL TONIGHT.
[000:07:11;931] NBC'S MIGUEL ALMAGUER SPENT MUCH
[000:07:13;966] OF THE DAY IN A HELICOPTER HIGH
[000:07:15;568] ABOVE THAT BATTLE GAINING A
[000:07:17;270] UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE IN JUST HOW
[000:07:18;704] HIGHLY COORDINATED THIS
[000:07:19;305] FIREFIGHT IS.
[000:07:23;075] >> Reporter: SO WE'RE ABOUT 15
[000:07:24;544] MILES AWAY FROM THE HEART OF THE
[000:07:25;311] FIRE.
[000:07:26;946] WE'RE DOWN WIND, SO THE SMOKE
[000:07:28;748] HERE IS SOCKING IN THE AIRPORT,
[000:07:29;615] WE'RE NOT ABLE TO LEAVE THE
[000:07:31;184] AIRPORT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO
[000:07:31;918] FLY.
[000:07:33;219] AS SOON AS WE FIND A POCKET OF
[000:07:38;191] STRONG WINDS THAT CLEARS OUT
[000:07:39;225] SOME OF THIS SMOKE, WE'LL TAKE
[000:07:39;959] OFF.
[000:07:40;226] SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A
[000:07:40;893] WINDOW HERE, AND WE'RE GOING TO
[000:07:41;627] TAKE OFF.
[000:07:42;628] HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE IT UP
[000:07:43;329] BEFORE THE SMOKE COMES BACK INTO
[000:07:44;063] THE AIRPORT.
[000:07:44;464] >> LOOKS GOOD TO GO, WE'RE SAFE.
[000:07:48;401] WE'RE GOOD TO GO.
[000:07:49;435] >> Reporter: THIS FIRE IS
[000:07:50;503] ROUGHLY 230 SQUARE MILES BIGGER
[000:07:51;270] THAN THE SIZE OF THE CITY OF
[000:07:51;971] CHICAGO.
[000:07:52;839] AND ALL ALONG THESE RIDGES WE
[000:07:53;773] CAN SEE FIRES.
[000:07:56;442] THERE'S NO DOUBT THIS FIRE IS
[000:07:57;910] GROWING, IT'S CERTAINLY QUICKLY
[000:07:58;644] ON THE MOVE.
[000:08:00;680] YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FUEL LOAD
[000:08:02;882] DOWN HERE, THERE'S JUST HUNDREDS
[000:08:04;450] OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES THAT CAN
[000:08:05;284] STILL BURN.
[000:08:06;385] >> WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR WAY
[000:08:07;220] DOWN TO THE SOUTH SIDE.
[000:08:12;291] FOR BETTER VISIBILITY.
[000:08:13;025] IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING IS
[000:08:13;759] BLOWN UP TO THE NORTH.
[000:08:14;360] >> Reporter: THIS FIRE HAS BEEN
[000:08:15;194] BURNING FOR A WEEK AND A HALF.
[000:08:15;928] AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THIS FIRE
[000:08:16;662] COULD BURN FOR WEEKS LONGER.
[000:08:17;630] CREWS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT
[000:08:22;568] ACCESS SO MUCH OF THIS TERRAIN
[000:08:23;302] DOWN THERE.
[000:08:23;803] IT IS VERY RUGGED, IT IS VERY
[000:08:24;537] ROCKY BELOW.
[000:08:25;371] FROM THE AIR HERE, YOU GET THAT
[000:08:27;673] UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE.
[000:08:30;176] YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
[000:08:31;177] CAN'T DROP FIREFIGHTERS INTO THE
[000:08:31;911] BURN ZONE.
[000:08:32;545] IF THEY PUT CREWS DOWN ON THE
[000:08:33;379] GROUND DOWN THERE, THERE'S
[000:08:34;046] NOWHERE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO
[000:08:34;747] RUN.
[000:08:35;014] THERE ARE NO ESCAPE ROUTES.
[000:08:37;250] SO ON THIS FLANK OF THE FIRE,
[000:08:38;584] THEY SIMPLY HAVE TO ATTACK IT
[000:08:39;318] FROM THE AIR.
[000:08:41;621] THE DC-10 IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST
[000:08:43;923] ASSETS CREWS HAVE ON THE GROUND.
[000:08:45;224] THIS PLANE CAN DROP NEARLY
[000:08:47;527] 12,000 GALLONS OF FIRE
[000:08:48;127] RETARDANT.
[000:08:50;196] IT CAN STOP FLAMES DEAD IN ITS
[000:08:50;930] TRACKS.
[000:08:52;865] YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW HOT THIS
[000:08:53;599] FIRE IS BURNING.
[000:08:56;769] BEHIND ALL OF THIS SMOKE AND ASH
[000:08:57;703] IN THE AIR, YOU CAN SEE THERE
[000:08:59;772] ARE HOTSPOTS, THERE ARE FLAMES

[000:24:07;112] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[000:27:00;385] >>> OUR FINAL STORY TONIGHT IS
[000:27:01;453] ABOUT A SMALL BUT EXTRAORDINARY
[000:27:02;687] RAY OF HOPE IN A PLACE WHERE
[000:27:03;888] THERE'S FAR TOO LITTLE HOPE.
[000:27:06;324] THAT SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN
[000:27:07;158] JORDAN.
[000:27:08;994] NBC'S ANN CURRY HAS THE STORY OF
[000:27:10;795] ONE YOUNG BOY IN DESPERATE NEED
[000:27:12;864] OF MEDICAL ATTENTION, AND A
[000:27:13;932] DOCTOR WHO'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE
[000:27:14;699] TO HELP HIM.
[000:27:25;577] >> Reporter: ON THE MOVE THROUGH
[000:27:29;314] ZAATARI CAMP, A DOCTOR LEADS US
[000:27:31;082] TO ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
[000:27:31;816] HERE.
[000:27:32;450] SULEMAN, A REFUGEE HIMSELF, WAS
[000:27:33;184] DETERMINED TO GET HELP FOR A BOY
[000:27:33;918] WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED IT.
[000:27:34;552] >> WHEN I SAW HIM, THE LIFE IN
[000:27:35;286] MY EYES DIED.
[000:27:35;720] >> Reporter: THE LIFE IN YOUR
[000:27:36;488] EYES DIED WHEN YOU SAW HIM?
[000:27:37;155] >> WHEN I SAW HIM.
[000:27:37;922] >> Reporter: SULEMAN TOOK US TO
[000:27:38;757] THE BOY'S MOTHER.
[000:27:40;091] MAY WE SEE YOUR SON?
[000:27:41;893] SHE LED US DOWN UNMARKED ROADS
[000:27:43;595] TO A PLACE WE COULD NOT HAVE
[000:27:48;833] FOUND BY OURSELVES, INTO HER
[000:27:49;567] SMALL SHELTER.
[000:27:50;301] AND THERE HE WAS, HIS FACE
[000:27:51;136] GAUNT, HIS ARMS LIKE TWIGS.
[000:27:52;704] HIS NAME IS IBRAHIM.
[000:27:59;044] HE IS 10 YEARS OLD, BORN IN
[000:28:00;445] SYRIA WITH A CONDITION THAT
[000:28:01;179] CAUSES HIS MUSCLES TO ATROPHY.
[000:28:01;880] PHYSICAL THERAPY HAD HELPED HIM
[000:28:02;614] WALK, HIS MOTHER SAYS, BUT
[000:28:03;281] SYRIA'S WAR HAS CHANGED THAT.
[000:28:05;050] IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, HE'S
[000:28:06;718] LOST MORE THAN 20% OF HIS BODY
[000:28:09;421] WEIGHT, CAN NO LONGER STAND, AND
[000:28:10;188] WON'T EAT.
[000:28:12;323] WHY CAN'T YOU EAT?
[000:28:19;164] HE SAYS "MY STOMACH FEELS
[000:28:19;831] FUNNY."
[000:28:20;999] HIS MOTHER FEARS FOR HIS LIFE.
[000:28:21;700] SHE SAYS, I'M VERY SAD ABOUT MY
[000:28:22;434] SON.
[000:28:22;701] HIS FATHER WAS KILLED.
[000:28:24;002] SINCE THEY FLED HERE, SHE'S
[000:28:25;570] TRYING TO GET HELP AS HER SON'S
[000:28:26;438] CONDITION WORSENS.
[000:28:31;710] BUT SHE SAYS LOCAL CLINICS
[000:28:32;410] TURNED HER AWAY.
[000:28:33;211] WE SUGGESTED A CLINIC SHE DIDN'T
[000:28:34;045] KNOW ABOUT, IN THIS SPRAWLING
[000:28:35;013] CAMP AND OFFERED HER AND IBRAHIM
[000:28:35;780] A RIDE THERE.
[000:28:38;149] 15 MINUTES LATER, AT THE GATES
[000:28:39;617] OF DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, A
[000:28:43;955] YOUNG PHYSICIAN ADMITTED
[000:28:45;557] IBRAHIM, AND SOON DOCTORS WERE
[000:28:46;424] GIVING HIM A CHECKUP.
[000:28:47;726] THEY SAY THEY'LL REFER HIM TO A
[000:28:48;493] SPECIALIST WHO MIGHT ONE DAY
[000:28:49;194] HELP HIM WALK AGAIN.
[000:28:50;662] IN THE MEANTIME, THEY OFFER
[000:28:51;996] NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND
[000:28:53;698] WEEKLY CHECKUPS TO HELP HIM GAIN
[000:28:55;867] WEIGHT AND GET STRONGER.
[000:28:58;169] TODAY, THAT'S ENOUGH TO GIVE A
[000:28:59;237] WORRIED MOTHER AND HER SON HOPE
[000:29:01;339] FAR FROM HOME.
[000:29:03;341] ANN CURRY, NBC NEWS JORDAN.

[000:29:28;967] OVER FAIRFIELD, A NEIGHBORHOOD
[000:29:31;236] RAVAGED BY FIRE.
[000:29:32;403] THE PD TELLS US AT LEAST FIVE
[000:29:35;106] HOMES HAVE BURNED, AND AT ONE
[000:29:39;277] POINT AT LEAST TEN OTHERS WERE

[000:29:47;619] EVACUATED.
[000:29:47;986] THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE JUST
[000:29:50;155] AFTER IT BROKE OUT AROUND 3:30
[000:29:52;257] THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:29:53;358] ROOFS ON FIRE, INTENSE FLAMES
[000:29:55;426] SHOOTING OUT, AND THICK, BLACK
[000:29:57;595] SMOKE.
[000:29:57;929] NOW CREWS AT THIS MOMENT ARE
[000:29:59;197] STILL WORKING TO CONTAIN THE
[000:30:00;431] FIRE, BUT IT LOOKS AS IF THEY'VE
[000:30:02;433] GOTTEN A HANDLE ON IT.
[000:30:03;802] WANT TO SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE
[000:30:05;303] THAT FIRE WAS BURNING.
[000:30:06;704] IT'S IN FAIRFIELD, NOT FAR FROM

[000:30:32;397] SMOKE HAS BEEN GOING THE OTHER
[000:30:35;066] WAY INTO THE COMMUNITY AND AWAY
[000:30:35;733] FROM 80.
[000:30:37;135] SO THE COMMUTE, THOUGH IT'S
[000:30:39;504] SLUGGISH, 80 REMAINS OPEN.
