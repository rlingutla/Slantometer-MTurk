1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
CALLED FOR HOME THE LAST SIX

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
YEARS."
ABC SAYS THE MOVE WAS PURELY

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
BUSINESS DECISION BY THE NETWORK

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
TO STOP SCHEDULING COMEDIES ON

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
FRIDAY NIGHT.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'M MELISSA FRANCIS.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
HERE'S SHEP.
>> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THECOA.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
3:00 AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FACING THE

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
MORE SERIOUS ALLEGATION SINCE HE

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
TOOK OFFICE.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
TURNING OVER CLASSIFIED SECRETS

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
SINCE BECOMING PRESIDENT.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
HE SAYS HE DID NOTHING WRONG.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
SOME REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
DEMAND ANSWERS.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
NEW CLUES IN THE WORLDWIDE HACK

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
ATTACK POINTING TO NORTH KOREA.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
COULD THE ROGUE NATION HAVE THE

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
POWER TO CRIPPLE COMPUTERS

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AROUND THE GLOBE?

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
HELD HOSTAGE.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
CYBER CRIMINALS SAY THEY STOLE A

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
COPY OF THE BLOCKBUSTER BEFORE

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
ITS RELEASE AND DEMANDING DISNEY

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
PAY UP OR ELSE.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
LET'S GET TO IT.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK,

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
THE WHITE HOUSE IS REFUSING TO

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
CONFIRM WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
SHARED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSING

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
ON LEAKS RATHER THAN THE

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
SUBSTANCE.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
THIS TIME, THE PRESIDENT IS

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
ACCUSED OF THE ORIGINAL LEAK.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
TAKING INTELLIGENCE, SHARING IT

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
WITH AN ADVERSARY IN THE OVAL

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
OFFICE WHILE ONLY THAT COUNTRY'S

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
MEDIA WERE IN THE ROOM.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
NO AMERICANS.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
AS CONGRESS AND THE FBI ARE

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION AND

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
POSSIBLE TEAM TRUMP COLLUSION

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
SO FAR NO REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
HAS COME TO HIS DEFENSE.

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
SOME ARE SILENT.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
SOME ARE EXPRESSING CONCERN.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
PAUL RYAN THROUGH A SPOKESMAN IS

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
ASKING FOR A FULL EXPLANATION.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
SAYS SHE HAS NOT BEEN INFORMED

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
AND THAT "IT'S VERY SERIOUS" AND

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
SHE WANTS TO "FIND OUT WHAT THE

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
FACTS ARE."

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
REPRESENTATIVE BARBARA COMSTOCK

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
REPUBLICAN OF VERY ISSUED A

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
STATEMENT SAYING "ONCE AGAIN

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
WE'RE FACED WITH STORIES COMING

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ARE

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
HIGHLY TROUBLING.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
WE NEED IMMEDIATE CLASSIFIED

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
BRIEFINGS SO THAT CONGRESS CAN

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
KNOW AS MUCH AS RUSSIAN

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
LEADERS".
MOST STRIKING OF ALL, BOB CORKER

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
FROM TENNESSEE SAYS THE WHITE

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
HOUSE IS IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
AND THAT IT "HAS GOT TO DO

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
SOMETHING SOON TO BRING ITSELF

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
UNDER CONTROL AND IN ORDER."

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
THEN THERE'S THE PRESIDENT'S

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
CABINET.
SEVERAL HOURS AGO, H.R. McMASTER

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
SAID THE INFORMATION PRESIDENT

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
TRUMP SHARED WITH THE RUSSIANS

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WAS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
HE WOULDN'T SAY IF THE

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
INFORMATION WAS CLASSIFIED.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
>> WE DON'T SAY WHAT IS

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
CLASSIFIED AND WHAT IS NOT

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
CLASSIFIED.
I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HE SHARED

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
IS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THE STORY COMBINED WHAT WAS

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
LEAKED WITH OTHER INFORMATION

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
AND THEN INSINUATED ABOUT

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
SOURCES AND METHODS.

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR TO

91
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
EVERYBODY THAT THE PRESIDENT IN

92
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
NO WAY COMPROMISED ANY SOURCES

93
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
OR METHODS IN THE COURSE OF THIS

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
CONVERSATION.

95
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
>> Shepard: "WHOLLY APPROPRIATE"

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
USED NINE TIMES.

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THIS COMES FROM BUZZ FEED AND

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND OTHERS,

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
REPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
REVEALED HIGHLY CLASSIFIED

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
MATERIAL.
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, THE

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
PRESIDENT REVEALED SENSITIVE

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
DETAILS THAT MAY HAVE QUOTED

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISLAMIC

105
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
STATES.

106
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OUR COUSINS AT THE "WALL STREET

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
JOURNAL" ARE REPORTING THAT

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
INTELLIGENCE SOURCE WAS ISRAEL,

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
AND THAT ISRAEL WAS NOT INFORMED

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
ANYONE MUCH LESS THE RUSSIANS.

113
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
AS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000

INVOLVING LAPTOP COMPUTERS ON

AIR LANES.

120

THE "WASHINGTON POST" TOLD THE

I HAVE PEOPLE BRIEF ME ON GREAT

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS MORNING

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
LASHED OUT ON TWITTER POSTING AS

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
PRESIDENT, I WANTED TO SHARE

128
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
WITH RUSSIAN AT AN OPENLY

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE MEETING

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
WHICH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT

131
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
TO DO FACTS PERTAINING TO

132
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
TERRORISM AND AIRLINE FLIGHT

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
SAFETY.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
HUMANITARIAN REASONS.

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
PLUS, I WANT RUSSIA TO STEP UP

136
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THEIR FIGHT AGAINST ISIS AND

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
TERRORISM.

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'VE BEEN ASKING DIRECTOR COMEY

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
TO FIND MY LEAKERS IN THE

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
OF COURSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS CAME

143
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
JUST HOURS AFTER HE FIRED THE

144
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW ADMITTED

146
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WAS AT

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
LEAST ON HIS MIND WHEN HE MADE

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THE DECISION TO FIRE HIM.

149
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNED FORMER

150
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
DIRECTOR COMEY NOT TO LEAK THEIR

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
CONVERSATIONS AND SUGGESTED

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THERE MIGHT BE TAPES THEREOF.

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
NOW THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
ACCUSATIONS THAT HE LEAKED SENSE

155
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
TY INFORMATION.
CANDIDATE TRUMP BASHED HILLARY

156
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
CLINTON FOR LEAKING CLASSIFIED

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
INFORMATION.

158
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
IN THE MONTH OF JULY, HE

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
TWEETED, "CROOKED HILLARY

160
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000

LATER THAT MONTH, CANDIDATE

164
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
TRUMP TREATED "HILLARY CLINTON

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN SENSITIVE

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
BRIEFINGS BECAUSE SHE'S A LOOSE

167
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
CANNON AND BAD INSTINCTS."

168
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
NOW THE SITTING PRESIDENT IS

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
ACCUSED OF ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE

170
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
DANGEROUS.

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
ANDREW NAPOLITANO SAYS THESE ARE

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THE MOST SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
LEVELS AGAINST A SITTING

174
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
PRESIDENT IN THE MODERN ERA.

175
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM SHORTLY.

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
FIRST, JOHN ROBERTS LIVE FROM

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THE NORTH LAWN.

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
JOHN?
>> GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'M BEING TOLD WHILE SINCE OF

180
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THIS INFORMATION MAY HAVE BEEN

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
DEVELOPED BY ISRAEL, IT WASN'T

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
IN THE FORM OF A SPECIFIC

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
DOCUMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT

184
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
PULLED OUT AND PRESENTED TO THE

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
RUSSIANS AND SAID THIS IS WHAT

186
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
WE'RE LEARNING.
MORE IT WAS THERE WAS

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
INFORMATION THAT WAS DEVELOPED

188
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
IN ONE REGION AND THE PRESIDENT

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
HAD A CONVERSATION IN GENERAL

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ABOUT THE THREATS THAT SOME OF

191
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
THAT INFORMATION DESCRIBED AND

192
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
THAT IT'S WRONG TO COMPLETELY

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN THE TWO

194
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
THINGS.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
TO THE RUSSIANS ABOUT IS THREATS

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
TO AVIATION.

197
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
THAT GOES BEYOND JUST THE LAPTOP

198
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
BAN.
A SECURITY OFFICIAL TOLD ME A

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SHORT TIME AGO THAT EVERY DAY WE

200
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HEAR NO END OF DIFFERENT WAYS

201
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
AND CREATIVE WAYS THAT PEOPLE

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WANT TO BLOW UP AIRPLANES

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT AL-QUAIDA

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
AND ISIS ARE STILL CONSUMED WITH

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THE IDEA OF BRINGING DOWN

206
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
AIRLINERS.
DON'T FORGET THAT RUSSIAN HAD

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THAT ATTACK ON OCTOBER 21, 2015

208
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
IN WHICH 224 PEOPLE DIED WHEN

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
ISIS BROUGHT DOWN A RUSSIAN

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
AIRLINER THAT WAS TAKING OFF IN

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
THE SINAI PART OF EGYPT.

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
SO THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
METING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

214
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
TURKEY SAID THAT HE BELIEVED

215
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO SHARE

216
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
INFORMATION ANT A COMMON THREAT

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WITH A COUNTRY THAT HE WANTS TO

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
BRING ON AS AN ALLY IN THE FIGHT

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
OF ISIS.

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID.

221
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
>> WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL

222
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
MEETING WITH TRUSSIA.

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
GENERAL McMASTERS SAID AND I

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
KNOW HE FEELS WE HAD A GREAT

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
MEETING WITH THE FOREIGN

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
MINISTER.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREAT

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
SUCCESS THE NEXT COMING YEARS

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AND WE WANT TO GET AS MANY TO

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
HELP FIGHT TERRORISM AS

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
POSSIBLE.

231
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
>> WE'RE ALSO TOLD IN AN OFF

232
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
CAMERA BRIEFING BY SEAN SPICER

233
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS VERY UPSET

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ABOUT THIS LATEST LEAK,

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

236
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
IT'S THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE

237
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
OF LEAKS.

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
HERE'S SOME AUDIO WITHOUT

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
PICTURES BECAUSE THIS IS AN OFF

240
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
CAMERA BRIEFING WITH SEAN

241
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
SPICER.

242
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> WHAT HAS OCCURRED TODAY OR

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
THE LAST LITTLE WHILE IN TERMS

244
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
OF THESE LEAKS IS FRANKLY

245
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
DANGEROUS.

246
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS

247
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION

248
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
IS PUSHING THAT INFORMATION OUT

249
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
INTO THE MEDIA, UNDERMINES OUR

250
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
NATIONAL SECURITY AND I DON'T

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
THINK THERE'S ANY OTHER WAY TO

252
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
SAY IT THAT IT IS FRANKLY

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
DANGEROUS.
>> WE HEARD THE SAME THING FROM

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
GENERAL H.R. McMASTER WHEN HE

255
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
SAID THAT WHAT REALLY IS A

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
ISN'T WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHARED

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
WITH RUSSIANS BUT IT'S IN THE

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
PUBLIC DOMAIN.

260
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
SO I PRESSED THE NATIONAL PUBLIC

261
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
SECURITY ADVISER SAID WHAT THE

262
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
NSD IS DOING TO CURB SUCH

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
THINGS.
>> WHAT STEPS ARE YOU TAKING BY

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
VIRTUAL OF DISCOVERING THIS AS

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
YOU DID TO TRY TO LIMIT THE

266
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
POTENTIAL FOR ANY MORE LEAKS OF

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION?

268
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> I THINK NATIONAL SECURITY IS

269
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
AT RISK BY THIS LEAK AND LEAKS

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
LIKE THIS.

271
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
THERE'S A NUMBER OF INSTANCES

272
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WHERE THIS HAS OCCURRED AND I

273
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
INVESTIGATE THESE SORT OF THINGS

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

276
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TRUSTED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS OUR

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
FREE SHARING OF INFORMATION AND

279
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
COLLABORATION.
>> OF COURSE, THE NATIONAL

280
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
SECURITY APPARATUS BELIEVES

281
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
THESE LEAKS ARE BAD.

282
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
OTHERS SAY THEY LIKE THE

283
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE
PRESIDENT IS DOING IS GETTING

284
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
OUT THERE.
I SPOKE WITH ERIC ERICSON, A FOX

285
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
HE SAYS HE KNOWS ONE OF THE

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
PEOPLE THAT LEAKED THIS

288
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
INFORMATION, HAS TALKED TO THAT

289
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
PERSON ABOUT IT.

290
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THE REASON IS, THIS PERSON IS A

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
TRUMP SUPPORTER, DOESN'T LIKE

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THE WAY THE PRESIDENT ISN'T

293
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
LISTENING TO HIS AIDES.

294
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
AND THOUGHT BY GETTING THIS

295
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
INFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
DOMAIN, THE BLOW BACK MAY

297
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENT TO

298
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
CHANGE HIS WAYS.

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
SHEP?

300
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
>> Shepard: ANYTHING FROM THE

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
ISRAELIS?
>> THIS FALLS INTO A NARRATIVE

302
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
THAT WAS CREATED IN THE INITIAL

303
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
STORY BY GIVING THIS INFORMATION

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
TO THE RUSSIANS DEVELOPED BY A

305
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THIRD PARTNER, THE PRESIDENT MAY

306
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
BE JEOPARDIZING THE INFORMATION

307
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SHARING PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE

308
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
HAVE AROUND THE WORLD.

309
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
BUT LISTENING TO THE ISRAELI

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES,

311
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
THE RELATIONSHIP WHEN IT COMES

312
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
TO INTELLIGENCE SHARING BETWEEN

313
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THE U.S. AND ISRAEL IS ON A FIRM

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
FOOTING.
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD.

315
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
SO ANY IDEA THAT THIS HAS

316
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
DAMAGED ISRAELI-U.S. RELATIONS

317
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE

318
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SHARING, SHEP, APPEARS TO BE

319
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
KNOCKED DOWN BY THIS PARTICULAR

320
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
STATEMENT.
BUT THERE'S OTHER ISSUES THAT WE

321
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT

322
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
THAT DO HAVE ISRAEL WORKED UP IN

323
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
TERMS OF WHAT THE U.S. IS

324
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SAYING.
>> Shepard: INDEED.

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
THANKS, JOHN ROBERTS.

326
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH PARTIES ARE

327
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
CALLING THE REPORT THAT

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHARED

329
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH

330
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS DISSERVING.

331
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
MIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE ON CAPITOL

332
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
HILL.

333
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I GAVE THE REPORT FROM SOME

334
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING A BOB

335
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
CORKER, THE REPUBLICAN OF

336
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
TENNESSEE THAT SAYS -- HAD HARSH

337
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
WORDS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

338
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GETTING?

339
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
>> SHEP, SOME REPUBLICANS SOUND

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
ALARMS SAYING THEY WANT MORE

341
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
ANSWERS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

342
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE CONCERNED

343
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
ABOUT THE DISTRACTION ASPECT

344
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
KEEPING THEM FROM WHAT THEY WANT

345
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
TO GET DONE.

346
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A SPOKESMAN FROM PAUL RYAN SAYS

347
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
PROTECTING AMERICAN'S SECRETS

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
ARE PARAMOUNT.
THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
WEIGHED IN BRIEFLY A SHORT TIME

350
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
AGO.
>> LET ME JUST REPEAT WHAT I

351
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
SAID IN AN EARLIER INTERVIEW

352
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
THIS MORNING.

353
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE LESS

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
DRAMA EMANATING FROM THE WHITE

355
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
HOUSE.

356
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
>> McCONNELL SAID HE WOULD

357
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
PREFER TO BE TALKING ABOUT LESS

358
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
REGULATION, REPEALING AND

359
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
REPLACING OBAMACARE AND TAX

360
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
REFORM RATHER THAN THE CRISIS AT

361
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
THE MOMENT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

362
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
>> Shepard: WHAT ARE YOU HEARING

363
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
FROM DEMOCRATS?

364
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
>> CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS HE WANTS

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
TO SEE TRANSCRIPTS OF WHAT THE

366
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
PRESIDENT SAID TO THE RUSHES.

367
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
NANCY PELOSI SAID WE CAN'T HAVE

368
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
THE PRESIDENT LOOSE LIP PED TO N

369
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
ADVERSARIAL DOMAIN.
>> WITH REGARD TO THE COMPROMISE

370
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
OF CODE-WORDED INFORMATION, IT

371
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
COMPROMISES OUR INTELLIGENCE

372
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000

373
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, ANNA.

561
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
>> THANK YOU.

562
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
>> Shepard: JUDGE ANDREW

563
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
NAPOLITANO SAID IT WAS PERFECTLY

564
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
LEGAL FOR THE PRESIDENT TO SHARE

565
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH THE

566
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
RUSSIANS.
BUT STILL, JUDGE ANDREW

567
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
NAPOLITANO IS CALLING THE

568
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
ACTIONS GRAY AND PROFOUND.

569
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
HE'S HERE TO EXPLAIN NEXT.

570
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THIS IS BILL'S YARD.

571
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
AND BILL HAS A "NO-WEEDS,
NOT IN MY YARD" POLICY.

572
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
BUT WITH SCOTTS TURF
BUILDER WEED & FEED,

573
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
BILL HAS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

574
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
IT KILLS WEEDS

575
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
AND GREENS GRASS, GUARANTEED.

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
THIS IS A SCOTTS YARD.

577
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If you have moderate to severe
rheumatoid arthritis like me,
and you're talking
AND Gto your rheumatologistD.

578
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
about a medication...

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
...this is HUMIRA.

580
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This is HUMIRA helping
to relieve my pain...

581
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
...and protect my joints
from further damage.

582
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
HUMIRA has been clinically
studied for over 18 years.

583
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
HUMIRA works by targeting
and helping to...

584
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
...block a
specific source...

585
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
...of inflammation that
contributes to RA symptoms.

586
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's proven to help
relieve pain and...

587
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
...stop further joint
damage in many adults.

588
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
HUMIRA can lower your
ability to fight infections,

589
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
including tuberculosis.

590
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

591
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
including lymphoma,
have happened,

592
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
as have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems,

593
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
serious allergic
reactions,

594
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and new or worsening
heart failure.

595
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

596
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Tell your doctor
if you've been to areas...

597
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
...where certain fungal
infections are common

598
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and if you've had TB,

599
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
hepatitis B,
are prone to infections,

600
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
or have flulike
symptoms or sores.

601
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't start HUMIRA
if you have an infection.

602
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Talk to your doctor
and visit HUMIRA.com

603
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is HUMIRA at work.

604
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
REMEMBER HERE AT ALLY,

605
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
NOTHING STOPS US FROM DOING
RIGHT BY OUR CUSTOMERS.

606
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
WHO'S WITH ME?

607
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
WE'RE LIKE A SPORTS
TEAM HERE AT ALLY.

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
IF A SPORTS TEAM HAD OVER 7...

609
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'M IN.

610
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
7,000 PLAYERS.

611
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
OUR PLAYS ARE A
LITTLE UNORTHODOX.

612
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
BUT TO BEAT THE BIG BOYS,

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
YOU NEED SMARTER WAYS
TO SAVE PEOPLE MONEY.

614
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
WE KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
FROM A FINANCIAL COMPANY

615
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
AND WE'LL STOP AT...

616
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
NOTHING TO MAKE SURE YOU GET IT.

617
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
ONE, TWO...

618
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
AND WE MEAN NOTHING.

619

620

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
OF THE STOP STORY OF THE DAY.

622
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
SEAN SPICER CALLING LEAKS ABOUT

623
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SHARING

624
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
INTELLIGENCE FRANKLY DANGEROUS

625
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
AND THE THREAT TO NATIONAL

626
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
SECURITY.

627
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
THE WHITE HOUSE CALLING THE

628
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
INFORMATION THE PRESIDENT SHARED

629
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
WHOLLY A ROPE WHY IT AND

630
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS

631
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
CLASSIFIED.

632
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
JUDGE NAPOLITANO IS HERE.

633
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
IF YOU COULD ENCAPSULATE AS YOU

634
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
DID FOR ME WHAT THE ACCUSATION

635
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
HERE AND EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE

636
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT.

637
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
>> THE PRESIDENT CAN DECLASSIFY

638
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
ANYTHING.
HE CAN WHISPER IT INTO YOUR EAR,

639
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
IN WHICH CASE IT'S DECLASSIFIED

640
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
JUST FOR YOU OR REMOVE IT FROM

641
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THE CATEGORY OF CLASSIFICATION,

642
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
IN WHICH CASE IT BECOMES PUBLIC.

643
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
IN THIS CASE HE DIDN'T WHISPER

644
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
IT IN THEIR EAR BUT SAID IT TO

645
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
THOSE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

646
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
AMONG THEM WITH THE FOREIGN

647
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
MINISTER TO RUSSIA AND THE

648
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA.

649
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
SO ONE WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IS,

650
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
BY NAMING THE CITY FROM WHICH

651
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
THE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION IN

652
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
SYRIA CAME, THE PRESIDENT OF THE

653
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
UNITED STATES TOLD OUR

654
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
ADVERSARY, RUSSIA, WHERE OUR

655
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
ALLIES, THE ISRAELIS HAVE THEIR

656
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
SPIES LOCATED IN SYRIA.

657
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

658
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
BECAUSE IN SYRIA THE RUSSIAN

659
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
INTEREST IS ADVERSE TO THE

660
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AMERICAN INTEREST AND THE

661
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
ISRAELIS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE

662
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
AMERICANS.
>> Shepard: SO WHAT YOU'RE

663
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
SAYING THE PRESIDENT TOLD THE

664
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
RUSSIAN SPY IN THE OVAL OFFICE,

665
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
WE GOT INFORMATION FROM ISRAEL

666
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
INSIDE SYRIA AND HERE'S WHERE

667
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
THE SPIES ARE INSIDE IN SYRIA.

668
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
>> HE APPARENTLY DID THAT

669
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WITHOUT USING THE NAME ISRAEL OR

670
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
THE WORD "ISRAELI" BUT THESE

671
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
GUYS KNEW OR COULD EASILY

672
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
CALCULATE WHAT FOREIGN POWER HAD

673
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
ENOUGH RESOURCES LOCATED IN

674
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
SYRIA TO PRODUCE THE KIND OF

675
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
INFORMATION THAT THE PRESIDENT

676
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

677
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
AGAIN, HE DIDN'T BREAK ANY LAW.

678
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
OBVIOUSLY THE ALLEGATION THAT AN

679
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
AMERICAN PRESIDENT GAVE TOP

680
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
SECRET INFORMATION TO AN

681
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
ADVERSARY IS GRAVE AND NEVER

682
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
BEEN CHARGED BEFORE IN THE

683
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
MODERN ERA.

684
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
THE QUESTION IS HOW HARMFUL IS

685
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
THIS AND WHAT THE CONCERN ABOUT

686
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
IT IN THE FEATURE.

687
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
>> Shepard: LEGALLY SPEAKING FOR

688
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
THE PRESIDENT.
>> ABSOLUTELY SAFE.

689
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
THE STATUTE IS VERY CLEAR.

690
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
THE PRESIDENT CAN CLASSIFY

691
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
ANYTHING AND HE CAN DECLASSIFY

692
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
ANYTHING.
WHEN HE SAID I HAD THE RIGHT TO

693
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
DO IT, HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
>> Shepard: THE BIGGER PICTURE

695
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
QUESTION IS FOR SOMEONE WITH A

696
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
DIFFERENT EXPERTISE THAN MINE OR

697
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
YOURS AND THIS WOULD BE HOW THAT

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
WOULD AFFECT OTHERS.

699
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
FOR INSTANCE, JORDAN, WHO IS

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
ALWAYS KNOWN TO BE A VERY GOOD

701
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR NEWS

702
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THE WAR ON TERROR.

703
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
WOULD SOME OF OUR ALLIES LIKE

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
JORDAN BE CONCERNED ABOUT

705
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
SHARING INFORMATION WITH US IF

706
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
THEY THOUGHT THE INFORMATION

707
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
MIGHT FIND ITS WAY TO THE

708
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
RUSSIANS?
>> THAT'S THE $64,000 QUESTION.

709
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'M SURE GENERAL McMASTER AND

710
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
HIS TEAM ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

711
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THAT.
BECAUSE THEY RELY ON THE

712
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
JORDANIANS AS THE JORDANIANS

713
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
RELY ON US.

714
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THEY THINK THE EXCHANGE WOULDN'T

715
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
BE GOOD.

716
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS WE HAVE A

717
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
COMMON ENEMY.

718
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
ISIS DESTROYED ONE OF THEIR

719
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
FLIGHTS AROUND SEVERAL HUNDRED

720
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
RUSSIAN CIVILIANS WERE MURDERED

721
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
AND HE WANTED TO HELP THEM FIND

722
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
OUT WHAT ISIS WAS UP TO AND

723
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED.

724
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'M SURE IF GENERAL McMASTER

725
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
AHEAD OF TIME, HE WOULD HAVE

726
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
SUGGESTED THE PRESIDENT USE

727
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
DIFFERENT WORDS.

728
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

729
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
>> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP

730
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
MEETING FACE TO FACE WITH THE

731
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
TURKISH PRESIDENT AFTER ANGERING

732
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THEM WITH ARMING KURDISH

733
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
FIGHTERS.

734
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THE KURDS AND THE TURK

735
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
GOVERNMENT ARE WILDLY OPPOSED

736
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
AND FIGHT ALONG THE BORDER.

737
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
DETAILS IN TODAY'S MEETING.

738
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN NORTH
KOREA AND THE MASSIVE GLOBAL

739
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
CYBER ATTACK.

740
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
WHAT RESEARCHERS SAY THEY FOUND

741
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000

IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S A

926
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
SHOOTING WAR THAT HAPPENS ON THE

927
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
KOREAN PENINSULA, THEY CAN DO

928
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
MORE DAMAGE.
IS IT A MONEY-MAKING ENTERPRISE

929
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OR MORE?

930
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
IT'S IN THE EARLY DAYS AND CAN'T

931
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

932
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
>> Shepard: HELP US UNDERSTAND

933
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
THAT SOMEONE MIGHT DRAW THE

934
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE NORTH

935
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
KOREANS?
WE KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE

936
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
WHATEVER THEY DO LOOK LIKE

937
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
SOMEBODY ELSE DID IT?

938
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
>> WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

939
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
ATTRIBUTION.
WE SAW, WE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

940
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
BUT COMPANIES LIKE SAMANTAC AND

941
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
SOME LABS IN RUSSIA, THEY SAW

942
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
BITS AND PIECES OF THIS ATTACK

943
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THAT WAS USED IN PREVIOUS

944
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
ATTACKS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS

945
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
HAD A HAND IN.

946
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SONY

947
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
PICTURES DEBACLE.
WE THINK THE NORTH KOREANS WERE

948
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
INVOLVED IN THE BANGLADESH

949
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
SENTRA BANK ATTACK AND ANOTHER

950
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
POLAND BANK ATTACK.

951
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, YOU

952
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
SEE THE SAME FINGERPRINT,

953
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
USUALLY LEADS YOU TO THE SAME

954
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
CONCLUSION.
PEOPLE CAN FAKE DATA AND CHANGE

955
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THINGS AROUND AROUND MAKE THINGS

956
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
LOOK LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.

957
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
BUT ENOUGH DATA POINTS SUGGEST

958
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAD SOME

959
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
HAND IN THIS.

960
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> Shepard: IF THEY HAD DONE

961
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
THIS IN A PHYSICAL WAY, IN OTHER

962
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
WORDS, USING HUMANS, GOING TO

963
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO DO

964
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
WHAT THEY'RE ALLEGED TO HAVE

965
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
DONE IN A CYBER WAY, THAT MIGHT

966
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
BE CONSIDERED AN ACT OF PRETTY

967
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
EXTREME AGGRESSION.

968
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
SOME MIGHT TREND TOWARDS AN ACT

969
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
OF WAR.

970
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WHY IS THIS NOT?

971
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> WELL, BECAUSE CYBER IS A

972
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
STRANGE THING.
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD THE

973
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
INTERNET FOR SEVERAL DECADES

974
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
NOW, WE DON'T THINK OF IT IN WAR

975
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
CONCEPT.
WE TALK NORTH KOREA AND THEIR

976
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS, THE

977
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
MISSILE CAPABILITIES.

978
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEIR

979
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

980
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
ALL AIMED AT SOUTH KOREA.

981
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THE THING ABOUT CYBER IS,

982
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THERE'S NO DISTANT ISSUE HERE.

983
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
IF YOU FIRE A MISSILE, YOU HAVE

984
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
TO MAKE TO IT JAPAN OR SOUTH

985
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
KOREA.
ON CYBER, THEY'RE INSIDE THE

986
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
GATE.
DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HERE IN

987
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
THE UNITED STATES OR DOING

988
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
THINGS ELSEWHERE.

989
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
YOU ARE HERE.

990
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, AKI.

991
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

992
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
>> Shepard: TURKEY'S PRESIDENT

993
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
SAYS HIS COUNTRY IS LOOKING FOR

994
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
A NEW BEGINNING TO RELATIONS

995
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

996
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THE COMMENTS CAME DURING THE

997
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
TURKISH PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH

998
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE

999
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
HOUSE AND COMES AFTER THE

1000
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
PENTAGON WENT AGAINST OBJECTIONS

1001
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
TO ARM KURDISH FIGHTERS.

1002
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
TURKEY SAYS THEY HAVE LINKS TO

1003
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
TERRORISM.

1004
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
THE TURKS CALLED THE KURDS

1005
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
TERRORIST.

1006
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THEY NEED

1007
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
HELP FROM THE KURDS TO TAKE OVER

1008
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
RAQQA.
IN OTHER WORDS, ONE COUNTRY'S

1009
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
TERRORISTS IS ANOTHER COUNTRY'S

1010
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
ALLIES.

1011
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
SO IT IS WITH THE KURDS AND WITH

1012
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
THE TURKS.

1013
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED

1014
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
TO EXTRA DIET A TURKISH CLERIC

1015
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
IN PENNSYLVANIA WHO THE TURKISH

1016
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
PRESIDENT SAID WAS BEHIND A COUP

1017
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
LAST YEAR.

1018
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
RICH EDSON HAS MORE.

1019
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
>> THE PRESIDENT CONGRATULATED

1020
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR WHAT HE SAID

1021
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
WAS A LEGENDARY TRIUMPH THAT HE

1022
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
GARNERED IN THE AFTERER MATH OF

1023
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THE ELECTION.

1024
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
DESPITE THE PRICE, THE

1025
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
COMPLIMENTS AND THE LONG WORKING

1026
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY AND THE

1027
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
UNITED STATES, THE ALLIANCE IS

1028
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
SHOWING STRESS LATELY.

1029
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
THE U.S.'S REFUSAL TO EXTRADITE

1030
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THE CLERIC THAT TURKEY HOLDS

1031
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COUP ATTEMPT

1032
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
AND THE U.S.'S COUNTED SUPPORT

1033
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
OF THE KURDS FIGHTING ISIS.

1034
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,000
>>  TURKEY IS ALSO TRYING TO

1035
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
NEGOTIATE A PEACE IN SYRIA AND

1036
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
DOING SO WITH IRAN AND RUSSIA.

1037
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
THE UNITED STATES IS OBSERVING

1038
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THE TALKS AND VIEWS THEM WITH

1039
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
SKEPTICISM.
PRESIDENT TRUMP RECEIVED

1040
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
CRITICISM FROM HUMAN RIGHTS

1041
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
GROUPS FROM THE INVITATION OF

1042
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
PRESIDENT TO HOST HIM AT THE

1043
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
WHITE HOUSE.
HE SAID HE'S IMPRISONED HIS

1044
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

1045
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE CRITICIZED THE

1046
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
PRESIDENT FOR A MEETING LAST

1047
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
MIGHT WITH EGYPTIAN.

1048
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
SISI AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1049
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD MEET

1050
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
WITH KIM JONG-UN, THE NORTH

1051
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
KOREAN DICTATOR AND ALSO INVITED

1052
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
DUTARTE FROM PHILIPPINES.

1053
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, RICH.

1054
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
THE NEXT "PIRATES OF THE

1055
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
CARIBBEAN" MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO

1056
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
COME OUT NEXT WEEK.

1057
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
BUT PIRATES ARE HOLDING THE

1058
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
MOVIE HOSTAGE.

1059
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
THEIR DEMANDS TO DISNEY COMING
UP.
CONTROL MY TYPE 2 DIABETES.

1060
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
MY A1C WASN'T WERE
IT NEEDED TO BE.

1061
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
SO I LIKED WHEN
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME

1062
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
THAT I MAY REACH MY BLOOD
SUGAR AND A1C GOALS

1063
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
BY ACTIVATING WHAT'S WITHIN ME

1064
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

1065
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

1066
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO
DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO DO,

1067
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.

1068
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
AND IT WORKS 24/7.

1069
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN

1070
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

1071
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

1072
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN
ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

1073
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
WHEN USED WITH
DIET AND EXERCISE.

1074
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

1075
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST
MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,

1076
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES

1077
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.

1078
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY
IF YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER

1079
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
HAS HAD MEDULLARY
THYROID CANCER,

1080
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
IF YOU'VE HAD MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2,

1081
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
OR IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY.

1082
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

1083
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
IF YOU HAVE A LUMP OR
SWELLING IN YOUR NECK,

1084
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
SEVERE PAIN IN
YOUR STOMACH,

1085
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
OR SYMPTOMS SUCH AS ITCHING,
RASH, OR TROUBLE BREATHING.

1086
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY
INCLUDE PANCREATITIS,

1087
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WHICH CAN BE FATAL.

1088
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN,

1089
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
INCREASES YOUR RISK
FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

1090
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,

1091
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
DECREASED APPETITE
AND INDIGESTION.

1092
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,

1093
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
WHICH MAY MAKE EXISTING
KIDNEY PROBLEMS WORSE.

1094
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY MAY HELP
ME REACH MY BLOOD SUGAR GOALS.

1095
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
WITH TRULICITY, I CLICK TO
ACTIVATE WHAT'S WITHIN ME.

YOUR A1C AND BLOOD SUGAR,

00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
>> YEAH, IT IS.

1283
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
SIX MILES LONG, THREE MILES WIDE

1284
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
AND COVERED IN TRASH.

1285
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
38 MILLION PEOPLES IS WHAT

1286
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
RESEARCHERS ARE ESTIMATING.

1287
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THEY SAY MORE WASHES UP

1288
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
DAY.

1289
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
>> Shepard: WHY HERE?

1290
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
>> THE OCEAN CURRENTING CONVERGE

1291
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
IN THAT AREA.

1292
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
IT ACTS LIKE A SONG.

1293
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
THE FLOATING PIECES OF PLASTIC

1294
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
GET STUCK.
THERE'S A HIGHER DENSITY OF

1295
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
TRASH HERE MORE THAN ANYWHERE IN

1296
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
THE WORLD.

1297
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
THIS HAS HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT

1298
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
ON THE WILDLIFE THERE.

1299
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
THE POOR CRAB HERE.

1300
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHOULD THEY LOOK

1301
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
LIKE.
>> Shepard: YEAH.
SHOULD LOOK LIKE DINNER.

1302
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
THAT ABE RIGHT.

1303
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
>> Shepard: ANYTHING OTHER THAN

1304
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
PLASTIC TO EAT SAID CRAB DINNER.

1305
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
SOMEBODY SHOULD CLEAN IT UP.

1306
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
>> IT'S HARD TO DO.

1307
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
IT'S SO FAR AWAY.

1308
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
IT'S ABOUT 3,000 MILES TO THE

1309
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
NEXT POPULATED CITY.

1310
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
SO IT'S TOUGH TO GET SUPPLIES

1311
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
THERE AND THEN TO GET SUPPLIES

1312
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
OFF OF THERE.

1313
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
>> Shepard: RISING SEE WILL

1314
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
PROBABLY WATCH IT AWAY.

1315
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
>> AND THEN GO TO THE ARCTIC,

1316
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
WHICH IS ALSO A MESS?

1317
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
THANKS, LILLY.

1318
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
WE'LL BE BACK WITH A FIRST LOOK

1319
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000

1320
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000

1322
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
(VO) Gentlemen,

1323
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Beggin' Skinny Strips or
Beggin' Black Label?

1324
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
There's two?!

1325
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Now this is a delicious dilemma!

1326
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Introducing New Beggin' Strips
Premium Edition.

1327
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
TWWWOOOOOO?!?!

1328
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
With real meat as
ingredient one.

1329
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Everything to your liking?

1330
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Mmm Mmmmm...

1331
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000

1332
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Becaussssseeee Beggin'!

1333
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000

WITH MIKE POMPEO.

1338
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000

00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
COMING UP MOMENTS FROM NOW.

1344
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
ON THIS DAY IN 1975, THE FIRST

WOMAN CONQUERED MOUNT EVEREST AT

1346
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
30,000 FEET.

1347
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
SHE WAS FIVE FEET TALL AND 90

1348
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
POUNDS.
ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE

1349
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
MOUNTAIN, AN AVALANCHE KNOCKED

1350
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
HER OUT FOR A WHILE AND BURIED

1351
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
THE GROUP'S CAMP.

1352
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
SHE LEFT THE TEAM AT THE CAMP

1353
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
AND 12 DAYS LATER REACHED THE

1354
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
SUMMIT STANDING ON TOP OF THE

SHOULD NEWS BREAK OUT, WE'LL

1357
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
BREAK IN.

1358
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
BREAKING NEWS CHANGES EVERYTHING

1359
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

1360
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
"YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL CAVUTO IS

01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
COMING UP WITH BREAKING NEW

1362

>> WHAT THE PRESIDENT DISCUSSED

1364
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS

1365
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.

1366
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
>> WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS

1367
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS.

1368
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
>> YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS

1369
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
PRESIDENT, MAY NOT LIKE WHAT

1370
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
HE'S DOING.

1371
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
>> RUSSIA IS NOT OUR FRIEND.

1372
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO EXERCISE

1373
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
DISCIPLINE WHEN TALKING TO

1374
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
LEADERS.
>> THE PRESIDENT IN NO WAY

1375
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
COMPROMISED ANY SOURCES OR

1376
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
METHODS IN THE COURSE OF THIS

1377
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
CONVERSATION.

1378
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
>> IT'S EXTREMELY CONCERNING.

1379
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
A REASON WHY INFORMATION IS

1380
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
CLASSIFIED.
>> NATIONAL SECURITY IS AT RISK.

1381
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
BY THIS LEAK AND LEAKS LIKE IT.

1382
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
