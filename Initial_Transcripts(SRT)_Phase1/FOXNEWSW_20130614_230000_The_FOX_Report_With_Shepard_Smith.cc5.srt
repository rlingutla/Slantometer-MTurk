1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
THAT'S IT FOR THE SPECIAL REPORT

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
FROM WASHINGTON WHERE WE REMAIN

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
PROUD AND FEARLESS.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
HAVE A GREAT FATHER'S DAY
WEEKEND.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
>>> THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
NO WORD FROM THE COMMANDER IN

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
CHIEF AS THE UNITED STATES GETS

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
READY TO STEP INTO ANOTHER WAR.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
INSTEAD, THE PRESIDENT'S

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
STAFFERS LAY OUT A VAGUE PLAN TO

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
ARM THE REBELS IN SYRIA.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
>> THERE NEEDS TO BE A

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
CONSEQUENCE FOR A REGIME THAT

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
USES CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
>> NOW THE UNITED STATES IS

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
PLANNING TO SEND MILITARY

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
ASSISTANCE.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
CRITICS SAY WE NEED TO DO MORE.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GIVING

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THEM MORE LIGHT WEAPONS?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
IT IS INSANE.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
>> AND WHY THIS IS NOT ABOUT

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ONLY SYRIA BUT AN ENTIRE REGION

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
THREATENING TO BLOW UP WITH HELP

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
FROM THE TERRORIST GROUP

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
AMERICAN INTERESTS AT STAKE AND

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THE PRESIDENT'S NEXT MOVE.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
>>> A SPORTS BAR DECK COLLAPSES.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
DOZENS OF PEOPLE PLUNGE INTO THE

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
WATER.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
>> WE JUST SAW THE BAR FALLING

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
INTO THE BAY.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
TONIGHT A LOOK AT THE FIRST

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
FRANTIC MOMENTS AFTER THE DECK

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
CAME CRASHING DOWN AT CHECKERS.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS FRIDAY

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
NIGHT, OUR NATION IS ABOUT TO

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
GET INVOLVED IN A CIVIL WAR IN

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
THE MIDDLE EAST.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
THINK OF IT.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
MAKE NO MISTAKE, IT IS A PROXY

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
WAR.
THE PLAYERS INCLUDE HEZBOLLAH,

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
LEBANON, RUSSIA AND THE SYRIAN

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
GOVERNMENT ON ONE SIDE WITH THE

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
SYRIAN REBELS AND NOW THE UNITED

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
STATES ON THE OTHER.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
SO WHAT'S THE GOAL?

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
WHAT'S THE END GAME?

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
WHAT ARE THE LIMITS?

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
WHAT IF WE HELP THE REBELS AND

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THE IRAN AND THE OTHER SIDE

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
WINS?
WHAT THEN?

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
IF THE WHITE HOUSE KNOWS OR HAS

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A PLAN, IT IS NOT TELLING THE

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
AMERICAN PEEL.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
LAST NIGHT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THE PRESIDENT, ANNOUNCED THE

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
U.S. NOW HAS HIGH CONFIDENCE

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THAT THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS USED

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO KILL AT

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
LEAST 100 PEOPLE.

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID THAT

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
WOULD CROSS A RED LINE AND HIS

65
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING MOVES

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
TO START ARMING SYRIAN

67
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
OPPOSITION FORCES.

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
WHAT KIND OF MOVES?

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A GOOD QUESTION.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
>> I'M NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
DETAILS OF WHAT WE WILL PROVIDE

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT SCALE AND

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
SCOPE OF WHAT WE'VE PROVIDED IN
THE PAST.

74
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
>> SHE DOES SAY THE OPTIONS DO

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
NOT INCLUDE PUTTING AMERICAN

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
TROOPS ON THE GROUND.
THE UNITED NATIONS ESTIMATES AT

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
LEAST 93,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
SYRIA'S TWO-YEAR CIVIL WAR.

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS SAY WE

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP THE

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
CIVILIANS DYING AT THE HANDS OF

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
A DICTATOR.

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
MARCO RUBIO RELEASE AD STATEMENT

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
WHICH READS IN PART, THERE IS NO

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
MORE TIME FOR HALF MEASURES.

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
OF COURSE, SYRIA IS SO

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
IMPORTANT, LARGELY BECAUSE OF

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
ITS LOCATION.

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
ALREADY VERY TENSE REGION.

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
TO THE EAST, JUST PAST IRAQ IS

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
IRAN.

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
AND AN ALLY THAT HAS BEEN

94
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
SENDING SUPPLIES TO THE SYRIAN

95
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
REGIME.

96
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
ON THE SYRIA'S WESTERN BORDER,

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
LEBANON WHERE THE TERRORIST

98
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
GROUP HEZBOLLAH RENEWED ITS

99
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
PLEDGE OF ASSISTANCE TO SYRIA'S

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
LEADER.
AND SOUTH OF THAT IS ISRAEL.

101
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A NATION WHICH RECENTLY TARGETED

102
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SUSPECTED WEAPONS SHIPMENTS NEAR

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
DAMASCUS AND TO SYRIA'S NORTH,

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
TURKEY WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS

105
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
ENGAGED IN A CRACKDOWN OF ITS

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
OWN AGAINST PROTESTERS.

107
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
MORE CONTEXT ON ALL OF THAT IN A

108
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
MOMENT ALONG WITH SYRIA'S

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
REACTION.
FIRST LET'S GET TO ED HENRY AT

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.
IF YOU CAN, PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IN THE

112
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
BUILDING BEHIND YOU.

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
>> Reporter: THEY'RE BEING AS

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
VAGUE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AS YOU

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SAID A MOMENT AGO IN TERMS OF

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHAT THE U.S.

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
MILITARY IS GOING TO DO.

118
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIECE

119
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TOGETHER ARE INDICATIONS THAT
WE'RE GOING TO BE SENDING SMALL

120
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
ARMS.

121
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
NOT THE HEAVY ARMS.

122
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
NOT THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
THAT SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND

124
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAYING YOU

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
REALLY NEED TO HELP THE REBELS

126
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TURN THE TIDE AGAINST PRESIDENT

127
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
ASSAD.
ABOUT ALL THEY ARE SAYING

128
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
DIRECTLY IS THAT THEY IN NO WAY

129
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
PLAN TO SEND U.S. GROUND TROOPS

130
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TO HAVE A DIRECT WAR INSIDE

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
SYRIA.

132
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
TAKE A LISTEN TO BEN RHODES.

133
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
>> WE DON'T THINK IT IS IN OUR

134
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
NAL NATIONAL INTERESTS TO SEND

135
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
TROOPS.

136
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
WE NEED TO BE HUMBLE ABOUT OUR

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
ABILITY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SYRIA.
CERTAINLY ON OUR OWN.

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
>> Reporter: AND THE OTHER THING

140
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THEY'RE BASICALLY RULING OUT AT

141
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM IS A

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
NO-FLY ZONE OVERSEER I CAN'T.

143
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
YOU'LL REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
ADVOCATED THAT.

145
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THAT WORKED IN 2011 HELPED GET

146
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
GADHAFI OUT OF POWER.

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
THEY'RE SAYING AT THE WHITE

148
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
HOUSE, IT WILL BE MUCH MORE

149
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED TO

150
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT OVERSEER

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I CAN'T SO THEY'RE NOT PLANNING

152
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
TO DO THAT.

153
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
>> WE ENDED UP IN IRAQ FOR

154
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ANOTHER DECADE.

155
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THAT DIDN'T WORK ANY WAY.

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
ONE MORE THING.

157
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
90,000 PLUS PEOPLE DID.

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
YET THE FOCUS STILL SEEMS TO BE

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

160
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
>> Reporter: RIGHT.

161
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THE WHITE HOUSE TRIED TO PUSH

162
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
BACK ON THAT DICHOTOMY OF SAYING

163
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
OF COURSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE

164
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
90,000 WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED.

165
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE RED

166
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
LINE OVER THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS

167
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
THAT APPARENTLY KILL 150 PEOPLE

168
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
IN SYRIA.

169
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THEY SAY THEY CARE ENOUGH ABOUT

170
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THE TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT THAT

171
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
IS WHY THEY SAID ASSAD SHOULD GO

172
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
MONTHS AGO.

173
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THAT'S WHY THEY IMPLEMENTED

174
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
SANCTIONS TO TRY TO PUSH HIM OUT

175
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
OF POWER.
BUT JOHN McCAIN SAID THAT IS NOT

176
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
GOOD ENOUGH.
HE SAID THE PROBLEM HERE IS

177
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH FOCUS ON

178
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THAT RED LINE.

179
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
NOT ENOUGH ON THE FOCUS ON THE

180
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
SLAUGHTER OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.

181
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
TAKE A LISTEN.

182
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
>> WE'VE DETERMINED THAT ASSAD

183
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
HAS KILLED ABOUT 100 TO 150

184
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
PEOPLE WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
HOW DID HE KILL THE OTHER

186
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
93,000?
IT IS JUST, WHAT THE PRESIDENT

187
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
DID WAS HE GAVE THEM A RED LINE

188
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
BUT GAVE THEM A GREEN LIGHT TO

189
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
DO EVERYTHING ELSE.

190
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
>> YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE NOT

191
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT IN ALL

192
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000

HE'LL BE MEETING WITH ALLIES

197
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
LIKE THE BRITS AND THE FRENCH

198
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
WHO HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE ON

199
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
THIS ISSUE.

200
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
BUT ALSO INTERESTING, THE

201
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
PRESIDENT ON MONDAY WILL HAVE A

202
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000

PUTIN.
RUSSIA HAS NOT BEEN AN ALLY ON

205
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
THIS.

206
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
RUSSIA IS HELPING ASSAD IN

207
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
SYRIA.
THAT WILL BE A PIVOTAL MEETING

208
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
ON MONDAY.

209

>> THE SYRIAN REGIME IS NOW

210
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
ACCUSING THE UNITED STATES OF

211
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
USING CHEAP TACTICS IN PUTTING

212
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OUT A STATEMENT THAT WAS FULL OF

213
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
LIES.

214
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
IN RUSSIA A TOP FOREIGN AFFAIRS

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT SAID

216
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THE CLAIMS DID NOT LOOK

217
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
CONVINCING.
LET'S GET TO THE FOX REPORT'S

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
CHIEF CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN

219
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000

220
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THERE IS A LITTLE MORE GOING ON

221
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ON SYRIA.

222
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
>> IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO ANSWER

223
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
THE QUESTION WHY NOW FOR U.S.

224
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ACTION, THE DEPUTY NATIONAL

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
SECURITY ADVISER BEN RHODES

226
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ADMITTED THAT REBEL LOSSES

227
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THE GROUND IN SYRIA HAD AT LEAST

228
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AS MUCH TO DO WITH CHANGING

229
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CALCULUS AS

230
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
DID THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

231
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
>> PARTICULARLY URGENT RIGHT NOW

232

IN TERMS OF THE SITUATION ON THE

233
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
GROUND IN SOME RESPECT, BECAUSE

234
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WE HAVE SEEN HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN

235
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
INCREASE THEIR OWN INVOLVEMENT

236
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
IN THE CONFLICT.

237
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
>> AND HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS HAVE

238
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MADE A VERY REAL DIFFERENCE.

239
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
JOINING PRESIDENT ASSAD'S FORCES

240
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
IN THE RECENT BATTLE FOR THE

241
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TOWN OF

242
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
QUSAIR AND WINNING ALONGSIDE THE

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
EARL OF PRESIDENT ASSAD.

244
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
THAT BY THE WAY WAS A CITY THAT

245
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THE REBELS HAD HELD FOR ONE

246
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
YEAR.
>> THE VIEWERS WILL REMEMBER

247
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
THAT HEZBOLLAH FOUGHT ISRAEL IN

248
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
THE SOUTH OF LEBANON AND

249
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
ACCORDING TO MANY OBSERVERS,

250
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
ISRAEL LOST.

251
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
NOW HEZBOLLAH'S LEADER IS

252
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
SPEAKING OUT ON THIS.

253
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> YEAH.

254
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
HE GAVE A SPEECH IN ONE OF HIS

255
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
STRONGHOLDS AT BEIRUT, LEBANON.

256
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
HE SAID THAT HEZBOLLAH HAS MADE

257
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A CALCULATED DECISION TO SUPPORT

258
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
PRESIDENT ASSAD OF SYRIA AND

259
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.

260
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
ACCORDING TO DAVID SHENKER OF

261
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE, THAT

262
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SORT OF SUPPORT MAKES A REAL

263
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
DIFFERENCE.

264
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
LISTEN.

265
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
>> THEY ARE GETTING THE SUPPORT

266
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
FROM RUSSIA, HEZBOLLAH, THEY CAN

267
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
REVERSE THE MOMENTUM ENTIRELY

268
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AND WIN.

269
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
THIS IS NOT IN OUR INTERESTS

270
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
EITHER.

271
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> NOW YOU HAVE HEZBOLLAH, IRAN

272
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AND FOR THE MOMENT, AT LEAST,

273
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
RUSSIA ON ONE SIDE OF THIS

274
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000

277
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
YOU HAVE THIS MAJOR SPLIT

278
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
BETWEEN SUNNI AND SHIA MUSLIMS.

279
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
THIS WHATEVER PATH WE CHOOSE

280
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
WILL NOT BE EASY.

281
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000

[ Female Announcer ] CALTRATE'S
DONEVEN MORE TO MOVE US.

554
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
BECAUSE VITAMIN D3 HELPS BONES
ABSORB CALCIUM,

555
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
CALTRATE HAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OF VITAMIN D3.

556
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
MORE THAN
ANY OTHER BRAND,

557
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
TO HELP MAXIMIZE
CALCIUM ABSORPTION.

558
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
SO CALTRATE WOMEN
CAN MOVE THE WORLD.

559
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
>>> CREWS ARE BATTLING TO HOLD

560
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THE LINE AGAINST THE MOST

561
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE EVER IN

562
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
COLORADO AN AREA LARGER THAN

563
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
MANHATTAN.
SINCE IT BROKE OUT ON TUESDAY

564
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
NORTH AND EAST COLORADO SPRINGS.

565
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
WE LEARNED YESTERDAY THAT THE

566
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
FIRE TURNED DEADLY.

567
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
OFFICIAL SAY THEY'VE ORDERED A

568
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AFTER

569
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
THEY FOUND TWO BODIES INSIDE A

570
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
GARAGE IN THE HEAVILY WOODED

571
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
AREA.

572
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
HOURS AGO, AUTHORITIES LIFTED

573
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
THE MANDATORY EVACUATIONS AROUND

574
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
THE CITY BUT THEY SAY THE FLAMES

575
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
HAVE DESTROYED 400 HOMES.

576
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
LOOK AT THE PATH OF THIS

577
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
DESTRUCTION IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD.

578
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
THE BLACK AREAS MARK WHERE SOME

579
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
HOUSES ONCE STOOD WHILE OTHERS

580
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
WITHIN THAT CHARRED LANDSCAPE

581
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

582
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF A

584
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
BRIEFING RIGHT NOW.

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
APPLAUSE BROKE OUT BECAUSE THEY

586
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
SAID THEY HAD A VERY GOOD DAY.

587
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
AND LATER IN THE AFTERNOON, LOOK

588
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
AT THIS.

589
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.

590
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
RAIN.
A LOT OF IT WHICH IS MUCH, IT

591
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
WAS EXACTLY WHAT FIREFIGHTERS

592
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
NEEDED.

593
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
THEY SAID THEY HAD A TREMENDOUS

594
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
DAY TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS RAIN.

595
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
THIS IS WHAT THE SHERIFF

596
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
DESCRIBES.

597
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
LISTEN.
>> SOME THINGS FINALLY TURNED IN

598
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
OUR FAVOR.

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT IT AS A

600
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
FIGHT, WE GOT OUR TAILS KICKED

601
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

602
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I THINK YESTERDAY WITH THE

603
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
AGREEMENT, WE SAW IT AS A DRAW.

604
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I THINK TODAY WE DELIVERED SOME

605
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000

LEAK MORE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
BASED ON THIS SEARCH IS SEEN AS

747
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
CREDIBLE.

748
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
>> NOW SOME SENATORS SAY THEY'RE

749
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TRYING TO LIMIT THE

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
SURVEILLANCE.

751
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000

752
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
BOTH EARLY CRITICS ARE NOW

753
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000

AMERICANS WHERE THERE IS NO,

755
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
WHAT THEY CALL, DEMONSTRABLE OR

756
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
VERIFIABLE LINK TO TERRORISM OR

757
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
ESPIONAGE.

DISCLOSURES OF THE LAST WEEK

760
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
HAVE MADE CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN

761
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
PEOPLE THE LAW IS BEING

762
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
INTERPRETED IN A WAY THAT

763
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
DAMAGES THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES

764
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
AND THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET

765
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
UP TO KEEP AMERICANS UNAWARE OF

766
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
THE INTRUSION.

767
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
NSA WHISTLE BLOWERS ARE RAISING

768
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A PROGRAM

769
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
PUBLICLY DESCRIBED BY THE FBI

770
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
DIRECTOR DURING CONGRESSIONAL

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
TESTIMONY TWO YEARS AGO.

772
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
IN THE WAKE OF THE FT. HOOD

773
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
TERRORIST ATTACK WHICH ALLOWS

774
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
FOR THE COLLECTION OF E-MAIL

775
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
FROM A U.S. CITIZEN ON U.S. SOIL

776
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
IN REAL-TIME.

777
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
WE PUT IN PLACE TECHNOLOGICAL

778
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE

779
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
CAPABILITIES OF A DATABASE TO

780
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
PULL TOGETHER PAST E-MAILS AND

781
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
FUTURE ONES AS THEY COME IN.

782
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
SO THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN

783
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
INDIVIDUALIZED SEARCH.

784
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
THE DATABASE IS SEPARATE FROM

785
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
THE P.R.I.S.M. PROGRAM, THE NSA

786
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
REFERRED FOX TO THE FBI AND

787
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT

788
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
BY THE BUREAU WHERE THEY WERE

789
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
STUDYING THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE

790
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
TESTIMONY.

791
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
>> THANK YOU, MA'AM.

792
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000

NOT LET ED SNOWDEN ON ANY

795
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.

796
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL

797
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
NOT ALLOW HIM INTO THE COUNTRY.

798
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
AND THEY'RE THREATENING TO FINE

799
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
AIRLINES MORE THAN $3,000 IF HE

800
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
DOES GO INTO THE U.K.

801
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
THAT WILL DO IT.

802
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I MEAN, $3,000.

803
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THAT WILL BRING THE AIRLINE

804
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
DOWN.
NOW ONE COMMUNIST BACKED

WHAT THEY CAN.
>> EXACTLY.

811
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
MILK HIM OF ALL HIS INFORMATION

812
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
AND THEN SEND HIM BACK TO THE

813
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
UNITED STATES.

814
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
THEY BELIEVE THE SECRETS HE HAS

815
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
ARE VITAL TO CHINESE NATIONAL

816
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000

ON HONG KONG AND CHINESE

821
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000

IT READS IN PART, QUOTING HERE,

823
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
MAYBE HE HAS MORE EVIDENCE.

824
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD

825
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
LET HIM SPEAK OUT AND ACCORDING

826
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
TO WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS

827
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000

NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITED STATES

829
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000

LISTEN.
>> CLEARLY, BEIJING IS NOW IN A

837
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
CAT BIRD SEAT.
IT CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP

838
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000

839
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000

842
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I THINK THAT GLOBAL TIMES

EDITORIAL THAT YOU REFERRED TO

844
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
IS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING THE

845
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
PRICE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

846
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
TO PAY TO GET SNOWDEN BACK.

847
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
WHEN WE GET HIM BACK, HE WILL

848
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
HAVE DISCLOSED EVERYTHING TO

849
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
BEIJING.

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
LATITUDE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF

MORE MODERATE VOTERS COULD SHOW

887
