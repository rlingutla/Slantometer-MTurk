>> THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TARGET

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
HIM PERSONALLY.
THEY HAVE MADE A POINT OF THAT

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BUT CERTAINLY MILITARY TARGETS

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
IN HIS REGIME.

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
NEXT?

112

CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THIS IS A LIMITED STRIKE.

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IT'S ONLY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
IN THIS CIVIL WAR BUT IT MUST BE

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000

IN REDUCING THE RISK OF STROKE.

724
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
XARELTO® IS JUST ONE PILL A DAY
TAKEN WITH THE EVENING MEAL.

725
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
PLUS, WITH NO KNOWN
DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,

726
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
JIM CAN EAT
THE HEALTHY FOODS HE LIKES.

727
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
DO NOT STOP TAKING XARELTO®,
RIVAROXABAN,

728
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
WITHOUT TALKING TO THE DOCTOR
WHO PRESCRIBES IT

729
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
AS THIS MAY INCREASE THE RISK
OF HAVING A STROKE.

730
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
GET HELP RIGHT AWAY

731
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
IF YOU DEVELOP ANY SYMPTOMS

732
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
LIKE BLEEDING,
UNUSUAL BRUISING,

733
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
OR TINGLING.

734
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
YOU MAY HAVE
A HIGHER RISK OF BLEEDING

735
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
IF YOU TAKE XARELTO®
WITH ASPIRIN PRODUCTS,

736
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
NSAIDS OR BLOOD THINNERS.

737
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
BEFORE TAKING XARELTO®

738
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
IF YOU HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING.

739
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
XARELTO® CAN CAUSE BLEEDING,
WHICH CAN BE SERIOUS,

740
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
AND RARELY MAY LEAD TO DEATH.

741
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
YOU ARE LIKELY TO BRUISE
MORE EASILY ON XARELTO®

742
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
AND IT MAY TAKE LONGER
FOR BLEEDING TO STOP.

743
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
TELL YOUR DOCTORS
YOU ARE TAKING XARELTO®

744
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
BEFORE ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
OR DENTAL PROCEDURES.

745
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
BEFORE STARTING XARELTO®,

746
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT ANY CONDITIONS

747
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
SUCH AS KIDNEY, LIVER,
OR BLEEDING PROBLEMS.

748
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
XARELTO® IS NOT FOR PATIENTS
WITH ARTIFICIAL HEART VALVES.

749
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
JIM CHANGED HIS ROUTINE.

750
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT XARELTO®.

751
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
ONCE A DAY XARELTO® MEANS
NO REGULAR BLOOD MONITORING --

752
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
NO KNOWN DIETARY RESTRICTIONS.
