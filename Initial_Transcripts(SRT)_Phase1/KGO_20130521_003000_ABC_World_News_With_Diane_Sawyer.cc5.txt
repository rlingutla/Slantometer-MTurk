[000:03:18;364] BUT THE GYM, TORN APART.
[000:03:20;567] >> IT JUST TORE THROUGH IT LIKE
[000:03:22;635] A TRUCK RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE
[000:03:24;037] CENTER OF IT.

[000:03:56;569] SOME KIDS WERE NOT FOLLOWING
[000:03:58;137] DIRECTIONS OF STAYING AWAY FROM

[000:04:24;464] HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO
[000:04:26;199] YOUR MOM?

[000:04:46;085] FROM THE DANGEROUS ZONES IN
[000:04:48;588] AFGHANISTAN.
[000:04:49;088] HE REPORTS IN TO US NOW.
[000:04:53;226] >> DIANE AS THE SUN SETS OVER
[000:04:54;961] THIS MASSIVE SCENE OF
[000:04:55;962] DESTRUCTION IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
[000:04:57;330] THE FOCUS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
[000:04:58;731] I'M IN HAS SHIFTED FROM
[000:05:00;600] BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
[000:05:03;169] WHICH WAS HIT BY THE TORNADO, TO
[000:05:06;339] THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AS THEY SEARCH
[000:05:07;240] UNDER PILES OF WOOD AND BRICK
[000:05:08;808] AND STONE THAT USED TO BE
[000:05:10;677] HOUSES, LOOKING FOR, EITHER
[000:05:13;313] SURVIVORS, OR FOR THE DEAD.
[000:05:17;917] THE GOOD NEWS NOW IS THAT
[000:05:19;986] STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL AND
[000:05:20;853] ADULTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
[000:05:21;954] SCHOOL, TELL US THAT NO CHILDREN
[000:05:25;658] DIED.
[000:05:26;092] THAT TORNADO PASSED RIGHT OVER
[000:05:27;960] THAT SCHOOL.
[000:05:28;928] WE WERE LESS THAN A MILE FROM IT
[000:05:30;897] WHEN IT HIT THE SCHOOL, AND YOU
[000:05:32;932] COULD SEE THE EXPLOSION AND THE
[000:05:35;535] DEBRIS WHEN IT HIT THAT LARGE
[000:05:38;471] STONE STRUCTURE.
[000:05:40;740] BUT A LITTLE 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL
[000:05:42;075] PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, I WAS
[000:05:44;110] IN THAT SCHOOL.
[000:05:46;245] AND OUR TEACHER GRABBED ME, AND
[000:05:47;847] THE REST OF THE STUDENTS, AND
[000:05:49;515] SAID, WE'RE GOING TO THE SAFE
[000:05:50;950] ROOM, AND WE ALL GOT THERE, AND
[000:05:52;919] WE WERE QUIET.
[000:05:54;053] AND THE TORNADO CAME, AND IT
[000:05:55;855] PASSED.
[000:05:56;322] AND WE WALKED OUT, AND WE WERE
[000:05:58;991] ALL ALIVE.
[000:06:00;059] THAT WAS HER QUOTE.
[000:06:01;461] SHE WAS TAKING IT IN STRIDE
[000:06:03;763] BECAUSE SHE WAS SITTING IN FRONT
[000:06:05;465] OF WHAT USED TO BE HER HOME,
[000:06:07;100] WHICH NO LONGER EXISTED.
[000:06:10;236] SO THIS SEARCH AND RESCUE IN
[000:06:14;941] THIS IMMENSE OF A DISASTER WILL
[000:06:17;543] TAKE DAYS BEFORE THERE'S A FINAL
[000:06:20;012] TOLL OF THE DEAD, AND ALL OF THE
[000:06:21;881] LIVING ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.

[000:06:39;298] HOSPITAL 12 MILES FROM MOORE,
[000:06:41;167] OKLAHOMA, WHERE THE INJURED ARE

[000:06:55;181] LITERALLY, MINUTE BY MINUTE.
[000:06:56;215] AT LAST CHECK, WE RECEIVED A
[000:06:59;152] TOTAL OF 37 PATIENTS.

[000:07:10;963] >> WE'RE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM
[000:07:12;999] JUST MINOR LACERATIONS TO SEVERE
[000:07:16;836] HEAD INJURIES AND ABDOMINAL
[000:07:18;871] WOUNDS.
[000:07:19;372] MOST LIKELY FROM PUNCTURES FROM
[000:07:21;340] FLYING DEBRIS.
[000:07:22;642] >> WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT
[000:07:24;544] THOSE CHILDREN IN THE TWO
[000:07:27;780] SCHOOLS, WHO WERE INSIDE.
[000:07:29;148] ANY OF YOUR CHILDREN FROM THOSE
[000:07:31;551] SCHOOLS, AND WHAT ABOUT THEIR
[000:07:33;786] CONDITION?
[000:07:34;287] >> WE RECEIVED A TOTAL OF FIVE
[000:07:36;923] CHILDREN OF THOSE 37.
[000:07:37;924] I KNOW THAT TWO OF THE 37 WERE
[000:07:40;927] FROM THAT SCHOOL.
[000:07:42;395] >> AND IS IT POSSIBLE, WITH
[000:07:43;863] PRIVACY, TO GIVE US ANY SENSE OF
[000:07:45;731] THEIR CONDITION?
[000:07:46;933] >> WELL, THANKFULLY NONE OF THE

[000:07:50;136] NOW ARE LISTED IN CRITICAL.
[000:07:52;738] ONE IN SERIOUS AND THE OTHERS
[000:07:54;140] ARE FAIR OR GOOD.
[000:07:56;342] SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
[000:07:58;010] >> THAT'S REALLY GREAT NEWS.
[000:07:59;612] HOW MANY MORE PATIENTS CAN YOU
[000:08:01;481] RECEIVE?
[000:08:01;948] HOW MUCH ARE YOU EQUIPPED TO
[000:08:03;883] RECEIVE?
[000:08:04;350] >> WELL, WE DO RUN THE BUSIEST
[000:08:06;953] ER IN THE STATE, SO WE ARE
[000:08:09;889] ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH VOLUME.
[000:08:12;124] MAYBE NOT TO THE EMOTIONAL
[000:08:13;960] EXTENT OF THIS TRAGEDY, BUT WITH

[000:08:20;333] WE'RE CAPABLE OF HANDLING

[000:08:25;738] YOU'RE HEARING AROUND TOWN.
[000:08:26;873] ARE THERE AMBULANCES GOING OUT
[000:08:28;207] ALL OVER TOWN, OR ARE YOU STILL
[000:08:30;743] LOOKING FOR REINFORCEMENTS?
[000:08:32;545] >> WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THE
[000:08:33;813] ROADS ARE STILL IMPASSABLE IN
[000:08:35;448] THAT AREA, SO IT'S TAKING A
[000:08:37;216] SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO
[000:08:39;252] GET OUT OF THE AREA AND TO OUR
[000:08:42;622] HOSPITAL.
[000:08:43;089] THE AMBULANCES ARE SHOWING UP,
[000:08:44;657] INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PATIENT AT A
[000:08:46;192] TIME, THEY'RE BRINGING THREE AND
[000:08:47;627] FOUR PATIENTS AT A TIME.
[000:08:51;430] MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST ARRIVING BY
[000:08:53;099] PRIVATE VEHICLE AS WELL.

[000:09:43;382] LATER, WE WERE HIT.
[000:09:45;551] OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS COVERED IN

[000:09:53;125] ALL ACROSS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:09:54;226] SOME HOMES COMPLETELY GONE.
[000:09:56;495] IT'S DEVASTATING.

[000:10:00;733] THROUGH PEOPLE'S ROOFS LIKE
[000:10:04;337] PROJECTILE OBJECTS.
[000:10:06;572] HEARING THE STORM GOING OVER MY
[000:10:10;710] HOUSE, WHICH ROARING, WHIRLING
[000:10:11;877] SOUND, IT WAS SO LOUD.

[000:10:14;447] JUST SHAKING, BLESS THEIR
[000:10:15;948] HEARTS.
[000:10:16;415] IT WAS A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.
[000:10:17;883] THANK GOD WE HAD A SHELTER.
[000:10:19;418] >> AND SO MANY HAD SHELTERS.

[000:10:45;111] SHE KNEW SHE WAS OKAY, BUT STILL

[000:12:15;768] PRELIMINARY CATEGORY HERE AS AN
[000:12:18;237] EF-4, THIS IS RARIFIED TERRITORY
[000:12:20;473] FOR TORNADOES.
[000:12:21;240] THERE ARE SOME REPORTS IT WAS ON
[000:12:23;709] THE GROUND FOR 40 MINUTES,
[000:12:24;443] COVERING 12 MILES IN THAT TIME.
[000:12:25;878] THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT SAY
[000:12:28;147] ON THE GROUND, THIS TORNADO WAS
[000:12:30;182] ABOUT TWO MILES WIDE.

[000:12:35;421] YOU CAN SEE THE TORNADO FILLING

[000:12:38;924] ANOTHER AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS
[000:12:40;159] TORNADO IS ON THE RADAR, WHEN IT
[000:12:41;927] FIRST POPPED OUT IN NEWCASTLE,
[000:12:43;162] BY THE WAY, THIS IS BEING CALLED
[000:12:45;231] THE NEWCASTLE-MOORE TORNADO, BUT
[000:12:49;268] WHEN IT DROPPED DOWN, IT WAS
[000:12:50;569] JUST A FINGER OF A TORNADO,
[000:12:52;538] BARELY A FUNNEL CLOUD.
[000:12:53;806] WITHIN AN HOUR, IT WAS A MONSTER

[000:13:16;262] HEARD REPORTS THAT SOME OF THE
[000:13:18;297] FOUNDATIONS WERE COMPLETELY
[000:13:19;632] CLEARED.
[000:13:20;099] THAT PUTS IT DEFINITELY IN THAT
[000:13:21;834] EF-4 AND MAYBE EVEN HIGHER
[000:13:25;137] CATEGORY, THE STORM THAT'S
[000:13:25;871] CAPABLE OF TAKING A FOUNDATION
[000:13:28;340] AND CLEARING IT OF DEBRIS, AS
[000:13:30;209] THE STORM LEAVES THE AREA.
[000:13:31;377] SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN SWEPT
[000:13:33;145] ALREADY BY A BIG TRACTOR.
[000:13:34;747] BUT IT HASN'T BEEN YET.
[000:13:35;881] IT WAS JUST THE STORM THAT DID
[000:13:37;983] THAT DAMAGE.
[000:13:38;484] AND IN OTHER AREAS, BUILDINGS
[000:13:40;085] JUST SHATTERED.
[000:13:40;686] THEN YOU LOOK AT MAJOR
[000:13:42;855] CONSTRUCTION.
[000:13:43;389] YOU SEE MAJOR CEMENT
[000:13:45;157] CONSTRUCTION ALSO BEING DAMAGED.
[000:13:46;959] THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL AND THE
[000:13:48;627] SIGNATURE OF A VERY LARGE AND
[000:13:50;896] VERY POWERFUL TORNADO.
[000:13:51;964] FOLKS HAVE BEEN DIGGING THROUGH
[000:13:54;333] THE DEBRIS AND LIFTING UP THESE
[000:13:56;969] HEAVY PIECES OF DEBRIS, WHETHER

[000:14:05;044] TO FIND ANYONE WHO MIGHT STILL
[000:14:06;111] BE IN THE RUBBLE.
[000:14:06;846] ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON, BECAUSE
[000:14:08;314] THIS IS STILL A VERY LARGE AREA.
[000:14:09;949] FROM THE SKY, YOU CAN SEE IT'S
