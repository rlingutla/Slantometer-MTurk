00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
SERVICE AT GUANTANAMO BAY AND

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
SURPRISED HIS DAUGHTER.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
100 MILITARY OFFICERS WERE

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
SENT HOME RECENTLY.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP DOUBLING

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
DOWN AFTER A NEW WAVE OF NFL

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
PROTEST, CRITICIZING PLAYERS

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
WHO REFUSED TO STAND FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'M RICK LEVENTHAL.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
MORE THAN 130 PLAYERS AND

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
COUNTING, SITTING, KNEELING OR

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
RAISING THEIR FIST DURING THE

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
ONE TEAM, THE PITTSBURGH

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
STEELERS STAYED IN THERE

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
LOCKER ROOM.
SOME LOCKED ARMS IN SOLIDARITY

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
BUT SOME TEAM OWNERS WERE

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
JOINING THEM.
MANY ARE CONDEMNING THE

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
PRESIDENT FOR COMMENTS THEY

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
SAY ARE DIVISIVE.
THE PRESIDENT ISN'T BACKING

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
DOWN.
A SHORT TIME AGO HE SAID

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
SPORTS FAN SHOULD NEVER

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
CONDONE PLAYERS THAT DO NOT
STAND PROUD FOR THE NATIONAL

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
ANTHEM WEATHER COUNTRY.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
NFL SHOULD CHANGE POLICY.
KRISTIN FISHER IS REPORTING

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
FROM SOMERSET NEW JERSEY NEAR

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
THE PRESIDENTS PRIVATE GOLF
CLUB.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH
REPORTERS LAST HOUR.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
WHAT IS HE SAYING NOW.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
>> IN SOME WAYS HE IS DIGGING
IN AND IN SOME WAYS HE'S

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
TAKING A STEP BACK.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THIS MORNING ON TWITTER, HE

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
ENCOURAGE SOME FANS TO GO TO

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
GAMES AND HE RETWEETED SOMEONE

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
WHO SAID THEY SHOULD BOYCOTT

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THE NFL.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED
DIRECTLY, ARE YOU CALLING ON

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
YOUR SUPPORTERS TO BOYCOTT THE

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
NFL.
HE SAID NO.
HE IS DIGGING IN HIS CRITICISM

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OF THE NFL PLAYERS WHO
CONTINUE TO TAKE ANY DURING

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
HE SAYS THIS IS ABOUT RESPECT
FOR OUR FLAG AND RESPECT FOR

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OUR COUNTRY AND NOTHING ELSE.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
>> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
RACE.
I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
RACE.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
RACE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THIS HAS TO DO WITH RESPECT

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
FOR OUR COUNTRY AND RESPECT

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
FOR OUR PLAYERS.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
>> THIS MORNING THE TREASURY

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
SECRETARY STEVE HIT THE SUNDAY
SHOWS TO TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
EMMA BUT HE WAS ALSO ASKED

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
THIS SITE WITH THESE POPULAR

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
PLAYERS NOW.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
>> THE NFL HAS ALL DIFFERENT
TYPES OF ROLES.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
YOU CAN HAVE STICKERS ON YOUR

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
HELMET, YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
JERSEYS TUCKED IN, I THINK

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
IS THAT THE OWNER SHOULD HAVE

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A ROLE THAT PLAYERS SHOULD

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
HAVE TO STAND AND RESPECT FOR

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DEMOCRATS OR

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
REPUBLICANS, IT'S NOT ABOUT

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
RACE, IT'S NOT ABOUT FREE

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
SPEECH.
THEY CAN DO FREE SPEECH ON

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THEIR OWN TIME.
THIS IS ABOUT RESPECT FOR THE

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
MILITARY AND THE FIRST

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
RESPONDERS IN THE CONCRETE.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
PEOPLE OUT THERE TONIGHT WHO

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
SAY THIS IS ONE BIG
DISTRACTION TO TAKE AWAY FROM

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
DAY.
RICK, IF THIS IS A

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
DISTRACTION, IT CERTAINLY IS

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WORKING.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
>> NO DOUBT.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
IT'S NOT JUST PROFESSIONAL

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
FOOTBALL.
HE ALSO HAS SOME A PROBLEM

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
WITH SOME OF THE PLAYERS IN

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
THE NBA.

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
THERE IS AN INVITATION TO THE

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
WHITE HOUSE BEING RESCINDED.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
WHERE DOES THAT CONTROVERSY

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
STAND.
>> WE ARE SEEING THE SPREAD TO

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
OTHER TEAMS IN OTHER SPORTS.

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
JUST BRING US UP TO SPEED, HE

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SAID HE WAS HESITANT TO GO TO

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WINNING

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP ARE THE

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
PRESIDENT CALLED YESTERDAY AND

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
SAID FINE, I'M RESCINDING MY

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
INVITATION AND NOW THE ENTIRE

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TEAM ISN'T GOING.
PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY, HE

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
PRAISED THE DIFFERENT TEAM IN

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A DIFFERENT SPEED AND

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
TRANSPORT.
THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS JUST

104
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
ONE THE CUP.

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
STATEMENT.
THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
PRESIDENT AND THE LONG

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
TRADITION OF CHAMPIONSHIP
TEAMS VISITING THE WHITE

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
HOUSE.
ANY AGREEMENT OR DISAGREEMENT

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
WITH THE POLITICS, POLICY OR

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
AGENDA CAN BE EXPRESSED IN

113
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
OTHER WAYS.
WE ARE CERTAINLY SEEING

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
PLAYERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
ACROSS THE NFL, OWNERS
INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP OWN

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
FRIEND AND DONOR, THE OWNER OF

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
COMING OUT THINK THEY ARE
DISAPPOINTED IN THE

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
PRESIDENTIAL REMARKS THIS

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
WEEKEND.
>> KRISTIN FISHER, THANK YOU

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
SO MUCH.
FOR MORE LET'S GO TO JIM

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
GRAY.

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE FORECASTER AT FOX NEWS

124
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SPORTS.

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
THEY MUST BE CRINGING OVER

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
THIS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THIS IS NOTHING THEY WANTED,
AND NOW THEY ARE IN RESPONSE

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
MODE AND THEY KNOW THE

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
HAS A TREMENDOUS FOLLOWING AND
CAN BE VERY DAMAGING TO THEIR

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
GAME.
THEY HAVE GALVANIZED.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THEY HAVE UNIFIED UNDER THESE

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
DIVISIVE COMMENTS AND I THINK
WHAT STRUCK THE MOST IS WHEN

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY SHOULD

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
BE FIRED.

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THE NFL PLAYERS BELIEVE THIS

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
IS SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT THEY

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ARE TRYING TO CHANGE AND NOT

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
TRYING TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE THEM IN

141
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THE MILITARY.

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
THEY SEND A VERY MIXED MESSAGE

143
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
, AND MANY OF THE FANS, 70% OF

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THE FANS ARE AGAINST THE

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
KNEELING.
THEY LOOK AT IT AS VERY

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
DISRESPECTFUL AND THAT'S WHAT

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THE PRESIDENT IS COMMENTING
ON.

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
THEY SEE THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
STOP.
THIS HAS BROUGHT THE ENTIRE

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

151
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
TOGETHER.
>> WE SAW THAT EARLIER TODAY

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
WHEN A LARGE GROUP OF PATRIOTS

153
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
WERE AMONG THE PLAYERS TAKING
A KNEE IN FOXBORO.

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
SOME PEOPLE WERE YELLING STAND
UP AT THEIR OWN TEAM.

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> BOTH TEAMS WERE ALSO BOOED

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
IN TENNESSEE.

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
THE SEAHAWKS AND THE TITANS

158
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
DID NOT COME OUT.
THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS DID

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
NOT COME OUT BECAUSE THEIR

160
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
HEAD COACH THAT OUR PLAYERS
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE.

161
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PICK
SIDES SO I'M GOING TO KEEP ALL

162
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
OF THEM INSIDE THE LOCKER

163
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
ROOM.
THERE WAS ONE PLAYER WHO DID

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
COME OUT FOR THE NATIONAL

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
ANTHE ANTHEM.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OF COURSE HE WAS AN ARMY
RANGER AND HAD THREE TOURS IN

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
AFGHANISTAN SO HE WAS THE LONE

168
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
STEELER, BUT MIKE JUST SAID

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THIS IS NOT ABOUT FOOTBALL AND

170
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'M NOT PUTTING MY GUYS IN THE

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
CENTER OF THIS DIVISIVE
POLITICS.

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
>> THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST
POWERFUL IMAGE OF THE DAY.

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
HE'S ONE OF MAYBE ONLY THREE

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
MEMBERS ARE PLAYERS IN THE NFL

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
PRIOR TO PLAYING FOOTBALL, AND

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
THERE HE IS, NOT STANDING WITH

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
HIS TEAM BUT COMING OUT TO

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
SHOW RESPECT FOR THE FLAG
DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> YES, IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
MOMENT.
>> THE FANS DON'T LIKE THIS AT

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ALL.

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
LOOK, THIS IS ONE OF THE
PLACES WHERE FANS GO TO ESCAPE

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
ALL THIS, WHERE PEOPLE CAN SIT

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
DOWN ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON OR

186
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
SATURDAY NIGHT AND WATCH

187
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
FOOTBALL GAMES AND REALLY GET

188
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
AWAY FROM ALL THIS, AND NOW,

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THIS IS FRAYING THE VERY
FABRIC OF THIS WEB THAT WE

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
HAVE AND THE SOCIETY IS NOW

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SHREDDED, BUT ONE OF THE LAST

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
REFUGE, ONE OF THE LAST PLACES

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WE CAN GO.
WE CAN'T TALK POLITICS OR RACE

194
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
OR RELIGION AND NOW IT'S GOING

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
CAN'T TALK SPORT.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
>> THE TRUTH OF IT IS, EVEN
THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED

198
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THAT THE TEAM OWNER SHOULD

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
FIRE THE PLAYERS, IN MOST

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
CASES THEY CAN'T FIRE THEM

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
BECAUSE OF THE UNION RULES IN

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
THE CONTRACT THEY SIGNED.

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
>> FORGET ABOUT THAT, THEY

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
COULDN'T WITHSTAND THE

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
BACKLASH IN THE COMMUNITY.

206
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
PEOPLE ARE NOT AGAIN SOCIAL

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
JUSTICE.

208
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
SO WHILE IT MAY BE THE WRONG

209
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
TIME TO BE SENDING THIS

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
MESSAGE, THEY ARE USING THE

211
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
PLATFORM.
THEY ARE USING A PLACE WHERE

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
THEY CAN GET THE ATTENTION

213
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY AND

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
WARRANTED, WHERE THEY CAN

215
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
BRING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
SEE AS WRONGS OF SOCIETY.
A LOT OF THIS HAD DIED DOWN.

217
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A LOT OF IT WAS ON THE BACK

218
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
BURNER.

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THERE IS A HANDFUL OF GUYS WHO

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS AND

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS SPEECH

222
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ALABAMA BROUGHT THIS ISSUE
BACK TO THE FOREFRONT.

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
HERE HAS BEEN THE RESULT.
WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS UNLIKE ANY

224
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
OTHER TIME IN OUR COUNTRY.

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
WE'VE HAD GUYS GOING FOR

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
SOCIAL CHANGE.
TOMMY SMITH AND JOHN CARLOS,

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
THE 1968 OLYMPICS WHEN THEY
ROSE THEIR FISTS UP IN THE AIR

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ON THE VICTORY PLATFORM,

229
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
MUHAMMAD ALI THROUGHOUT HIS

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
CAREER IN THE 60s AND 70s

231
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
AND 80s, BUT NEVER HAVE WE
EVER SEEN AN ENTIRE LEAGUE

232
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
VIRTUALLY IN UNISON SPEAK OUT

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IN THE WAY THEY SPOKE TODAY.

234
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
>> AND CLEARLY THIS IS NOT
OVER YET.

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

236
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
>> THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING
AFTER A SHOOTING IN A CHURCH

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
IN TENNESSEE, SOUTHEAST OF

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
NASHVILLE.
A WOMAN IS DEAD.

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
AS MANY AS SIX OTHERS ARE
INJURED.

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
AUTHORITIES SAY A MASKED

241
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
GUNMAN OPENED FIRE JUST AFTER

242
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
SERVICES LET OUT.

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
AND USHER AT THE CHURCH TRIED

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
TO INTERVENE.
>> HE CONFRONTED THE GUY, WAS

245
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
PISTOL WHIPPED AND HE WENT
AFTER HIS CAR.

246
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
WE SEIZED THE WEAPON, CAME

247
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
BACK INSIDE AND THEN THE

248
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
GUNMEN SHOT HIMSELF.

249
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
>> THE VICTIMS WERE ADULTS,

250
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
MANY OVER THE AGE OF 60.

251
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
JONATHAN IS REPORTING LIVE

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
FROM TENNESSEE.

253
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
FBI INVESTIGATING WHETHER RACE
MAY HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE.

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
>> YES, AS FAR AS LOCAL

255
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
POLICE, THEY ARE PURSUING

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
SEVERAL LEADS.
THEY WON'T SPECULATE PUBLICLY

257
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
ON ANY MOTIVE.
FEDERAL OFFICIALS HAVE

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
CONFIRMED THAT THE FBI WILL BE

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
LAUNCHING A CIVIL RIGHTS

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
INVESTIGATION WITH THE

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
SHOOTING.

262
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED
THEM AS EMMANUEL SAMPSON.

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
HE IS A 25-YEAR-OLD

264
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE.
HE HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM

265
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HOSPITAL AND WILL BE CHARGED

266
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
WITH MURDER AND ATTEMPTED

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
MURDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE

268
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
SHOOTING SPREE.
THE GUNMAN FATALLY SHOT

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
39-YEAR-OLD MELANIE SMITH IN

270
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
THE CHURCH PARKING LOT AND

271
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WENT INSIDE THE CHURCH
BUILDING, OPENING FIRE,

272
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
INJURING SIX OTHERS.

273
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THE MAYOR
ISSUED A STATEMENT

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
SAYING THIS IS A TERRIBLE

275
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
TRAGEDY FOR OUR CITY.
MY HEART ACHES FOR THE FRIENDS

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
AND FAMILY AS WELL AS THE

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
WOUNDED VICTIMS AND THEIR

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
LOVED ONES.
SHE WENT ON TO PLEDGE HER

279
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT FOR
CRIME-FIGHTING EFFORTS IN THE

280
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
COMMUNITY, PREVENTING VIOLENCE

281
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AND PROMOTING PEACEFUL
RESOLUTION TO CONFLICTS.

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
REMEMBER, THIS IS A RULE

283
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
SUBURB JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY
OF NASHVILLE.

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
A QUIET COUNTRY CHURCH.
IT'S TERRIBLE IF THIS HAPPENS

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
ANYWHERE, BUT HERE IS ONE OF

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THE LAST PLACES YOU WOULD

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
EXPECT IT.
>> IT COULD'VE BEEN A LOT

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
WORSE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT
CHURCH USHER WHO STEPPED IN.

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
THAT CHURCH USHER IS ONLY 22
YEARS OLD.

291
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
HIS NAME IS ROBERT INGLE.
HE ACTUALLY CONFRONTED THE

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
GUNMEN ACCORDING TO WITNESSES

293
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
DURING THE SCUFFLE.
HIS GUN WENT OFF INJURING THE

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
GUNMEN.
WHAT'S UNCLEAR, AUTHORITIES

295
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AREN'T SURE WHETHER THE

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
SUSPECT WANTED TO SHOOT

297
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
HIMSELF OR WHETHER THE GUN

298
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
ACCIDENTALLY WENT OFF INJURING

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
THE GUNMEN.
EITHER WAY, IT STOP THE

300
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SHOOTING SPREE IN ITS TRACKS

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AND POLICE ARE CALLING THIS

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
YOUNG MAN A HERO.
>> THANK YOU.

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
WEIGHING ITS OPTIONS ON A NEW

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
VERSION OF THE TRAVEL BAN.
WHAT THAT NEW ORDER MIGHT LOOK

305
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
LIKE.

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
PLUS, THE GRAND CASSIDY HEALTH

307
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
CARE BILL COULD BE ON LIFE

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
SUPPORT WITH TO MORE GOP

309
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SENATORS SAYING THEY ARE ON

310
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THE FENCE.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID IT IS NOT

311
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
READY TO PULL THE PLUG.

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
>> WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING

313
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
AS WE ARE TAKING DOLLARS OUT

314
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
OF WASHINGTON D.C. AND SENDING

315
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
IT TO THE STATE.

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
HOW EACH STATE GETS THOSE

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
RESOURCES IS BEING CONTINUED

318
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
TO TRY TO PROTECT PERFECT THAT

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Cigna. Together, all the way.

320
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
3 toddlers won't stop him..

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And neither will lower
back pain.

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because at a Dr. Scholl's Kiosk

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
he got a recommendation for
our Custom Fit Orthotic

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to relieve his foot,
knee, or lower back pain,

325
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
from being on his feet.

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Dr. Scholl's.
Born to Move.

327
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I have age-related maculare
degeneration, AMD,

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
he told me to look at this
grid every day.

329
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And we came up with a plan

330
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to help reduce

331
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
my risk
of progression,

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
including PreserVision
AREDS 2.

333
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
My doctor said

334
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
PreserVision
AREDS 2

335
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
has the exact
nutrient formula

336
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the National Eye
Institute recommends

337
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to help reduce

338
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
the risk of progression of
moderate to advanced AMD

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
after 15 years
of clinical studies.

340
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
PreserVision
AREDS 2.

341
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because my eyes
are everything.

342
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the toothpaste that helps

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
prevent bleeding gums.

344
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you spit blood

345
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
when you brush or floss

346
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you may have gum problems

347
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and could be on the journey

348
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to much worse.

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Help stop the journey

350
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
of gum disease.

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Try parodontax
toothpaste.

353
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000

it's ok to crave.

541
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SIGNAL

542
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
ON OUR CELL PHONE WHICH HAD

543
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
PREVIOUSLY BEEN NONEXISTENT.

544
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

545
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
TOUGHEST, MOST CHALLENGING

546
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
PART FOR PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO

547
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
AS WELL IS BACK IN THE

548
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
STATES.

549
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
THAT DISCONNECT, NOT BEING

550
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOUR LOVED

551
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
ONES AND LET THEM KNOW HOW
YOU'RE DOING.

552
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
IN FACT, FOLKS HAVE DRIVEN AS

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
FAR AS 40 OR 50 MILES TO TRY

554
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
TO FIND CELL PHONE SIGNAL TO

555
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
BE ABLE TO PLACE A CALL OR

556
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
MAKE A TEXT OR JUST SEND THAT

557
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
MESSAGE OUT.
ALONG THE HIGHWAY IS ONE OF

558
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
THE FEW PLACES THAT HAS
SIGNAL.

559
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
YOU CAN SEE LONG LINES OF CARS

560
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
STOPPING TO TRY TO CONNECT

561
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
WITH THEIR LOVED ONE.

562
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
THEY HAVE SLOWLY STARTED TO

563
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
COME INTO THE COUNTRY.

564
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, AFTER

565
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
LOSING THEIR HOME, THE LONG

566
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
LINES FOR FUEL, FOOD AND
WATER, ALONG WITH THE PROSPECT

567
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
OF GOING MONTHS WITHOUT POWER

568
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
IS JUST TOO MUCH AND HUNDREDS

569
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
OF THEM ARE NOW TRYING TO FIND

570
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A WAY.

571
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
>> IT'S TERRIBLE.

572
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
EVERYONE IS FIGHTING FOR
GASOLINE.

573
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
MY HUSBAND GOES OUT AT FOUR IN
THE MORNING EVERY DAY TO GET

574
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
GASOLINE FOR THE GENERATOR.

575
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
GETS BACK AT TWO OR

576
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
WITH TEN DOLLARS AT THE MOST.

577
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
WE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE.

578
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
WE CAN SURVIVE THAT WE HAVE A

579
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
LITTLE GIRL AND IT'S

580
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
COMPLICATED.

581
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
THIS IS CRAZY.

582
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
>> IN WESTERN PUERTO RICO, THE

583
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
THREAT OF A COLLAPSING DAM HAS

584
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
FORCED 8000 PEOPLE TO
EVACUATE.

585
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
OFFICIALS SAY THAT DAM COULD
STILL BREAK AT ANY MOMENT.

586
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
AFTER RECEIVING MORE RAIN

587
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
TODAY, THE NATIONAL WEATHER

588
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
SERVICE EXTENDED A FLASH FLOOD

589
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
WARNING UNTIL 815 TONIGHT.

590
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
OFFICIALS ACROSS THE TERRITORY

591
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
ARE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS

592
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
JUST WHAT HOW WIDESPREAD THE

593
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
DAMAGES AND HOW BAD IT IS IN

594
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
SOME AREAS, PARTICULARLY THOSE

595
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
SMALL TOWNS ALONG THE WESTERN

596
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
AND SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS
OF THE TERRITORY WHERE THE

597
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
STORM REALLY DAMAGED

598
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
SEVERELY.

599
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THEY ARE TRYING TO REESTABLISH

600
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
COMMUNICATION THERE.

601
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
TODAY THE GOVERNOR SAID THE

602
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
DEATH TOLL REMAINED AT TEN.

603
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
THAT NUMBER COULD STILL RISE

604
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
AS THE INDICATIONS ARE

605
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
REESTABLISHED.

606
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
THIS WEEKEND PUERTO RICO

607
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
CONGRESSWOMAN SAID FEMA

608
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
ADMINISTRATOR AS WELL AS

609
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO
WILL BE MAKING THEIR WAY TO

610
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THE ISLAND TOMORROW TO SURVEY

611
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THE DAMAGE FOR THEMSELVES.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID HE

612
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
PLANS TO VISIT THE ISLAND.

613
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
NO DATE OR TIME HAS BEEN

614
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
SCHEDULED FOR THAT VISIT.

615
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
>> A SHOW SOLIDARITY ACROSS
THE NFL.

616
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
PLAYERS AND OWNERS STAND UP
FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

617
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
THIS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

618
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
CALL FOR PLAYERS AND PROTEST

619
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
TO BE FIRED.

620
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
WHAT DO THE FANS THINK?
WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM.

621
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
AN INFAMOUS FIGURE IN POLITICS

622
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
NOW EYEING A POLITICAL COME

623
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
BACK AFTER A REMARKABLE FALL
FROM GRACE.

624
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
>> HAD I BEEN GIVEN A CIVIL

625
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
FINE WITH THEY STILL FEEL I

626
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
SHOULDN'T REPRESENT THEM IS

627
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
MARK I HEAR OVERWHELMING

628
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY

629
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
YES.

630
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Upeace of mind.s

631
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
We had a power outage
for five days total.

632
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We lost a lot of food.

633
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We actually filed
a claim with USAA

634
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
to replace that spoiled food.

635
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And we really appreciated that

636
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We're the Webber family and

637
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
we are USAA members for life.

638
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I AM TOTALLY BLIND.

639
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
AND NON-24 CAN THROW MY
DAYS AND NIGHTS OUT OF SYNC,

640
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
KEEPING ME FROM THE
THINGS I LOVE TO DO.

641
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR,

642
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
AND CALL
844-214-2424.

643
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Endless Shrimp is back

644
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
at Red Lobster.

645
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And we went all out

646
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
to bring you even more
incredible shrimp

647
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and new flavors.

648
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Like new
Nashville Hot Shrimp,

649
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
drizzled with
sweet amber honey,

650
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and new grilled
Mediterranean Shrimp

651
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
finished with a savory blend

652
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
of green onions,
tomatoes, and herbs.

653
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Feeling hungry yet?

654
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Good, 'cause there's plenty
more where these came from.

655
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Like Garlic Shrimp Scampi,

656
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and other classics you love.

657
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
As much as you want,
however you want them.

658
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But hurry, Endless Shrimp
won't be here long.

659
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
If you have moderate to severe
plaque psoriasis,...t them.

660
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
...isn't it time to let the real
you shine through?

661
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Maybe it's time for Otezla
(apremilast).

662
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Otezla is not an injection or a
cream.

663
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's a pill that treats plaque
psoriasis differently.

664
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
With Otezla, 75% clearer skin
is achievable after just 4
months,...

665
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
...with reduced redness,...

666
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
...thickness, and scaliness of
plaques.

667
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And the Otezla prescribing
information has...

668
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
...no requirement for routine
lab monitoring.

669
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Don't use if you're allergic to
Otezla.

670
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Otezla may cause severe
diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.

671
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Tell your doctor if these occur.

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Otezla is associated with an
increased...

673
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
...risk of depression. Tell your
doctor if you have...

674
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
...a history of depression...

675
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
...or suicidal thoughts,...

676
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
...or if these feelings develop.
Some people taking Otezla...

677
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
...reported weight loss.

678
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Your doctor should monitor your
weight and may stop treatment.

679
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Other side effects include
upper...

680
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
...respiratory tract infection
and headache.

681
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Tell your doctor about all the
medicines you take...

682
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
...and if you're pregnant or
planning to be.

683
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Ask your dermatologist
about Otezla today.

684
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Otezla. Show more of you.

685
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
This iNot this John Smith.Smith.

686
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Or this John Smith.

687
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Or any of the other hundreds of
John Smiths that are

688
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Humana Medicare Advantage
members.

689
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No, it's this John Smith.

690
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Who we paired with a Humana team
member to help address his

691
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
own specific health needs.

692
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
At Humana, we take a personal
approach to your health,

693
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
to provide care that's just as
unique as you are.

694
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
No matter what your name is.

695
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I'M RICK LEVENTHAL.

696
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED BACK

697
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER A

698
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
WEEKEND OF CONTROVERSY.
THE PRESIDENT WENT ON THE

699
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
ATTACK AGAINST NFL PLAYERS WHO

700
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
REFUSE TO STAND FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

701
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
HE CALLED THEM AS OB AND SAID

702
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
TEAM OWNER SHOULD FIRE THEM.
THAT IGNITED A WAVE OF PROTEST

703
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
ACROSS THE LEAGUE.

704
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
MORE THAN 130 PLAYERS AND
COUNTING SITTING, KNEELING OR

705
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
RAISING THEIR FIST DURING THE

706
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
THE PITTSBURGH PLAYERS STAYED

707
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
IN THE LOCKER ROOM WHILE THE

708
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
ANTHEM WAS PLAYED.

709
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
BRIAN, HOW ARE FANS REACTING
TO TODAY'S PROTEST.

710
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
>> WE ARE AT RED'S RESTAURANT

711
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
AND BAR WHERE THE JETS BEAT

712
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THE DOLPHINS.

713
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
THE PEOPLE HERE LOVE TO WIN.
IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

714
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
LOOK, SOME PEOPLE SAY

715
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
GENERALLY THEY DO NOT LIKE THE

716
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE USING THE

717
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
NATIONAL ANTHEM TO PROTEST.

718
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
IN FACT MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE

719
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
THAT.

720
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER OR

721
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BOYCOTT

722
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THE SPORT OR HOW FAR THEY'RE
WILLING TO GO TO SUPPORT THAT

723
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
OR GO AGAINST IT, THEY ARE NOT

724
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
WILLING TO BOYCOTT.

725
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE FOLKS

726
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
SAID TO US.

727
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
>> I THINK OUR YOUNG MEN AND

728
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
WOMEN FOUGHT FOR US TO HAVE

729
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
THE RIGHT TO EITHER STAND UP

730
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
OR TAKE THAT KNEE.

731
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
IT'S JUST WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.

732
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
IF IT'S A WAY TO GET THE

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
MESSAGE ACROSS IN TERMS OF
WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR.

734
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
WHY NOT.
YOU JUST HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM

735
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
NO MATTER WHAT.

736
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
>> CAN WE JUST HAVE OUR
SUNDAYS WITH FOOTBALL.

737
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
LOOK.

738
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'M TRYING TO ENJOY SUNDAY

739
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
WITH MY WIFE.

740
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
WERE TALKING ABOUT POLITICS

741
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
NOW.
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

742
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
>> LISTEN, I'M A VETERAN.

743
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
THOSE GUYS ARE GETTING PAID

744
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I
USED
TO GET A PAYCHECK OF $750 IN

745
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
THE MILITARY.

746
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
IF YOU CAN'T STAND FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEN GET OFF

747
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THE FIELD.

748
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
>> I THINK IT TURNED THE WHOLE
THING FROM AWFUL.

749
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
IT WAS A GREAT MOVE ON

750
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DO IT.

751
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
>> THAT WAS JUST SOME OF THE

752
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
OPINIONS WE GOT HERE TODAY.

753
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST TELLING

754
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
US THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE

755
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
FACT THAT POLITICS ARE GETTING
INVOLVED WITH THEIR NFL

756
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
SUNDAY.
IN FACT, A LOT OF

757
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
CONVERSATIONS WERE
UNCOMFORTABLE.

758
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

759
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET PEOPLE

760
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
WHO WANTED TO SPEAK BECAUSE

761
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
IT'S NOT A GOOD MIX FOR THESE

762
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
FOLKS.
THEY JUST WANT TO SEE THE

763
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
GAME.

764
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
>> SOME FANS SAY THEY ARE

765
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
GOING TO STOP WATCHING BECAUSE
OF HIS PROTEST?

766
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
>> WE SPOKE TO A COUPLE FANS

767
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
WHO SAY THEY KNOW OF PEOPLE

768
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
WHO WILL STOP WATCHING BECAUSE

769
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
OF THIS.
OR WHO HAVE STOPPED WATCHING.

770
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
IN FACT THERE WAS A SURVEY

771
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
DONE FROM JD POWER IN JULY AND

772
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
IT SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER ONE

773
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
REASON THAT PEOPLE STOPPED

774
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
WATCHING FOOTBALL RECENTLY IS

775
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
BECAUSE OF THESE NATIONAL

776
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
ANTHEM PROTEST.

777
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
BEHIND THAT WERE THE

778
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
COMMERCIALS ARE GAME DELAYS
AND EVEN THE PRESIDENTIAL

779
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
ELECTION.
BUT THAT'S AN INTERESTING POLL

780
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW WITH THE

781
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
PRESIDENT WAS SAYING IN TERMS

782
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
OF FANS NOT NECESSARILY LIKING
THE WAY THE GAME IS OR NOT

783
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
LIKING THE ANTHEM, I GUESS

784
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THAT WOULD SORT OF SUPPORT

785
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
THAT.
IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF FANS

786
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
WE SPOKE TO TODAY THAT WERE

787
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
WILLING TO BOYCOTT, WE DID NOT

788
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
FIND THAT TODAY.
WE WILL SEE HOW THEY FEEL.

789
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
THIS IS THE FIRST WEEK IN

790
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
WHICH WE'VE SEEN THIS AT THIS

791
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
LEVEL IN TERMS OF PRESIDENT

792
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
TRUMP GETTING INVOLVED.

793
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW
WILL THIS AFFECT THE SPORT.

794
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
>> YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE NAME

795
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
AND YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT
INTERVIEW THAT ONE OFF THE

796
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
RAIL.

797
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
MICHAEL GRAHAM WENT TO THE BIG

798
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
HOUSE BUT NOW HE'S BACK AND HE

799
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
TALKS TO US ABOUT HIS PLANS

800
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
FOR THE FUTURE.

801
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
MICHAEL GRAHAM WAS THE RIGHT

802
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
RISING STAR IN THE REPUBLICAN

803
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
PARTY.
HE WAS THE ONLY ELECTED

804
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS
REPRESENTING NEW YORK CITY

805
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
FROM 2011 UNTIL 2015.

806
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO A
RESTAURANT HE ONCE OWNED LED

807
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
THE CHARGES OF FRAUD AND TAX

808
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
EVASION AND THEN THIS

809
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
HAPPENS.

810
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
>> OF PEOPLE SAID WHAT ARE

811
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
YOUR BIGGEST REGRETS, IT'S NOT

812
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
HAVING CHILDREN IS PROBABLY

813
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
NUMBER ONE BUT WITHIN THE TOP

814
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
THREE IS THAT INTERVIEW.

815
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
>> THE REPORTER AND LOCAL
NETWORK HAD AGREED TO STAY ON

816
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
TOPIC BUT DIDN'T.
HE LOST HIS COOL AND THEN WENT

817
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
HOME.
>> I WALK IN AND I SAID MOM, I

818
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
KNOW.
DON'T SAY IT.

819
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
SHE SAID NO, YOU DON'T KNOW.

820
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
YOU KNOW WE LOOK LIKE?

821
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I SAID NO, WHO DO I LOOK

822
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
LIKE.

823
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
SHE SAID YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR
FATHER.

824
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I SAID WHY MY FATHER SON.

825
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
SHE SAID BUT YOUR FATHER COULD

826
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
GET A WE AWAY WITH IT.

827
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
YOUR CONGRESSMAN, YOU CAN'T.

828
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
IT HIT ME LIKE A TON OF

829
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
BRICKS.

830
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
>> HE PLED GUILTY TO A SINGLE

831
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
COUNT OF TAX FRAUD FOR PAYING

832
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
ILLEGAL WORKERS OFF THE
BOOKS.
HE RESIGNED FROM CONGRESS AND

833
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
SERVED SEVEN MONTHS IN PRISON.

834
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
>> WHAT WAS THAT LIKE FOR

835
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
YOU.
>> HORRIBLE.

836
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
ONE OF THE WORST EXPENSES OF

837
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
MY LIFE.
I WOULDN'T WISH IT ON MY

838
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
ENEMY.
HE SAID HIS CASE WAS POLITICAL

839
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
HE MOTIVATED AND HIS CRIME
DESERVE NO TIME.

840
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
>> IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF

841
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
NEW YORK CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVIL

842
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
FINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

843
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
LABOR TO RESTAURANT OWNERS FOR

844
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
THIS EXACT SAME CONDUCT.

845
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'M THE FIRST TO BE CRIMINALLY

846
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
CHARGED.
MICHAEL GRAHAM SAYS HE IS

847
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
READY TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE

848
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
AGAIN.

849
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
>> SHOULD I RUN?

850
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
>> IF YOU DO, YOU'VE GOT MY

851
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
VOTE.

852
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
>> I APPRECIATE THAT.

853
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I DON'T RUN UNLESS I KNOW I

854
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
CAN WIN.

855
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
WHEN I GO OUT AND I SHAKE

856
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THESE HANDS AND PEOPLE HUG ME

857
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
AND THEY TELL ME YOU HAVE NO

858
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

859
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
BEHIND YOU, I JUST KNOW IT.
I FEEL IN MY HEART.

860
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
RICK: JOINING ME NOW, MICHAEL

861
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
GRAHAM.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

862
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
LET'S GET IT OUT OF THE WAY,

863
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
MAKE IT FO OFFICIAL.

864
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
ARE YOU RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.
>> I THINK IT'S A DECISION

865
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
THAT THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

866
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
DECIDE.
I HAVE A BIG RALLY COMING UP

867
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
SUNDAY OCTOBER 1 AND IF THE

868
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
PEOPLE REALLY WANT ME TO RUN

869
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
THEN YES I'M GOING TO RUN.

870
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
>> BASED ON THE PEOPLE WHO WE

871
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
SAW IN THE DINER THAT DAY,

872
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THEY WANT YOU TO RUN.

873
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
>> PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE I'VE

874
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
BEEN, WHAT I'M GETTING

875
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
CONSISTENC CONSISTENTLY IS

876
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,

877
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
WE'VE MISSED YOU.

878
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN I WAS

879
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
THE CONGRESSMAN, WHEN I WAS

880
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
REPRESENTING THESE PEOPLE, I

881
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
GAVE MY HEART MY SOUL.

882
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I WAS EVERYWHERE.
I WAS WITH THEM.

883
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
THERE WERE DAYS WHERE

884
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
LITERALLY I WOULD SHOW UP AT

885
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
SOMEONE'S HOUSE BECAUSE I KNOW

886
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH REALLY

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
DIFFICULT TIMES.
I WOULD HUG THEM AND THERE WAS

888
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
A TIME WHERE WE ACTUALLY CRIED

889
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
TOGETHER.

890
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I REALLY KNEW MY

891
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
CONSTITUENTS.
THEY GOT TO KNOW ME AND IT WAS

892
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
VERY PERSONAL.

893
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
>> YOU HAVE A COUPLE HURDLES

894
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
HERE.
I KNOW YOU WANT TO FOCUS NOT

895
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
TO BE ON THAT ONE INTERVIEW OR

896
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THAT ONE REPORT, OR THE TIME

897
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
THAT YOU SPENT IN A FEDERAL

898
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
LOCKUP.
YOU WANTED TO BE ON YOUR

899
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
NEARLY 20 YEARS OF PUBLIC

900
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
SERVICE.

901
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
>> YOUR TIME IN THE GULF WAR,

902
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
YOUR TIME IS AN UNDER

903
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
UNDERCOVER AGENT.
>> FIRST OF ALL YES.

904
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
DO I HAVE THREE DELIVERY BOYS

905
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
AND A KITCHEN WORKER OFF THE

906
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
BOOKS FOR A COUPLE YEARS,

907
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
MYSELF AND TWO OTHER PARTNERS,
YES I DID AND I OWN THAT.

908
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT

909
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
OR HIDING.

910
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
THAT'S A CIVIL MATTER.
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.

911
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
EVERYONE BUT ME.
I FOUND OUT 14 MONTHS BEFORE

912
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
THE INDICTMENT THAT A DEAL WAS

913
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
MADE WITH LORETTA LYNCH.
I KNEW SHE WAS CORRUPT.

914
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I WAS TOLD IF SHE TOOK ME DOWN

915
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
SHE WOULD BE THE NEXT ATTORNEY

916
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

917
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
FOR TWO MONTHS AFTER WHAT I

918
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
WOULD CALL A SHAM INDICTMENT,
SHE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

919
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
OF THE UNITED STATES.

920
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
>> YOU'RE SAYING SHE TARGETED

921
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
YOU TO ADVANCE HER OWN
CAREER.

922
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
>> THERE IS NO QUESTION.
>> WILDS WHAT I WOULD BE THE

923
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
FIRST AND ONLY PERSON IN THE

924
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
HISTORY OF NEW YORK CITY TO
NOT GET A CIVIL FINE.

925
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
>> YOU MADE THAT POINT IN THE

926
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
CASE THAT SOME PEOPLE DO

927
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
THIS.

928
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
YOUR POINT WAS THAT YOU

929
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
WEREN'T TAKING MONEY AND PUT

930
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
IT IN YOUR POCKET.
YOU ARE TAKING MONEY TO PAY

931
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T PAY ON

932
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
THE BOOKS.

933
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
>> AND I NEVER TOOK THE RIGHT
AFTER THE REALITY IS, ANY

934
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
ACCOUNT WOULD TELL YOU, I

935
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
WASN'T DOING IT TO MAKE MONEY,

936
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
YOU CAN'T GET IT DISHWASHER

937
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
UNDER THE BOOKS.

938
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
SO MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A

939
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
KIT ON THE BICYCLE TO

940
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
DELIVER.

941
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

942
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I WAS WRONG PRODUCTION OF DONE

943
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
IT.
I SHOULD'VE HAD THE COURAGE TO

944
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
FAIL, CLOSE THE RESTAURANT AND
POSSIBLY EVEN LOSE MY HOUSE.

945
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE

946
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
AND I REGRET THAT FOR THE REST

947
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
OF MY LIFE.
>> I KNOW YOU BELIEVE YOUR

948
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
FOREIGN-POLICY EXPENSE CAN

949
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
HELP ON CAPITOL HILL,

950
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
INCLUDING YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH

951
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
NORTH KOREA.

952
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION.

953
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I THINK MY FOREIGN-POLICY
EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO MY

954
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
LOYALTY.
I'M A MARINE THROUGH AND

955
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
THROUGH.

956
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I ALMOST GOT KILLED IN THE

957
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
GULF WAR.

958
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
MY HUMMER HIT A TANK AND BY

959
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
THE GRACE OF GOD I SURVIVED.

960
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
AND THEN I WALKED THAT VERY

961
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
NIGHT DOWN THAT MINEFIELD TO

962
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
BRING PRISONERS BACK TO

963
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
SAFETY.

964
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
SO, I HAVE A SPINE.

965
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THERE'S A LOT OF MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS WITH A VERY WEAK

966
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
SPINE THAT HAVE TURNED THEIR

967
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
BACK ON OUR PRESIDENT AND HAS

968
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
UNDERMINED THE AGENDA THAT

969
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
EVERYONE VOTED FOR.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WOULD BE

970
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
THERE TO HAVE OUR PRESIDENT'S

971
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
BACKPACK THAT'S NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER TWO, YES, WE HAVE A

972
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
VERY PRECARIOUS, VERY

973
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
DIFFICULT SITUATION WITH NORTH

974
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
KOREA AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.

975
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
WE HAD THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION THAT TRIED TO

976
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
BRIBE THEM.
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

977
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
FAST-FORWARD AND YOU HAVE
EIGHT YEARS OF AN APPEASEMENT

978
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
POLICY BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.

979
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
NOW WHAT WE HAVE?
NOW HAVE A LUNATIC WITH THE

980
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
CAPABILITY, VERY SOON, ICBMS

981
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT CAN

982
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
POSSIBLY STRIKE NOT ONLY THE

983
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
UNITED STATES BUT OUR ALLIES.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS

984
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
TAKEN SUCH A HARSH STANCE, BUT

985
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
THAT'S BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE

986
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

987
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
NORTH KOREA, AND MAYBE HE'S

988
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
NOT MENTALLY STABLE TO HEAR

989
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
IT, BUT ALLIES NEED TO KNOW

990
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
THAT OUR RESOLVING COMMITMENT

991
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
IS UNWAVERING.
THAT MEANS JAPAN, WE REALLY

992
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
HAVE TO MAKE SURE ARE UNDE

993
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
ALLIES UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE

994
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
HERE FOR THEM.
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT

995
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
SITUATION.
>> NOT TO SWITCH TOPICS BUT

996
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOOK A

997
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
HARSH STANCE AGAINST NFL
PLAYERS.

998
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
AS A VETERAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT PLAYERS KNEELING DURING

999
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

1000
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
>> I THINK THERE ARE TWO
ISSUES.
NUMBER ONE, AS SOMEONE WHO

1001
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
WATCHES THE FOOTBALL GAMES,

1002
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
THIS IS MY ESCAPE.
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

1003
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
POLITICS.
I WANT TO WATCH A GAME AND GET

1004
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
AWAY FROM THAT.

1005
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
THAT'S THE FIRST THING.
THE SECOND THING, NOT ONLY AS

1006
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
A VETERAN BUT AS SOMEONE WHO

1007
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HAS SHARED THE BLOOD SWEAT AND

1008
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
TEARS WITH THOSE THAT HAVE

1009
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
GIVEN THEIR LIVES AND THEIR
LIMBS, ABOUT THE FAMILIES OF

1010
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
SOMEONE WHO LOST A SON OR

1011
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
DAUGHTER OR LOVED ONE IN

1012
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
COMBAT AND THEY HAVE TO SEE,

1013
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
PEOPLE WHO WE SHOULD BE

1014
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
LOOKING UP TO, SPORTS FIGURES,

1015
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
PEOPLE THAT OUR CHILDREN LOOK

1016
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
UP TO, THEY MAKE MILLIONS OF

1017
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
DOLLARS IN A VERY TALENTED.
TO TURN YOUR BACK ON THE

1018
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND OUR FLAG,

1019
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT I

1020
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
THINK STRIKES AT THE HEART OF

1021
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS.

1022
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
AS A VETERAN, IT'S OFFENSIVE.

1023
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
>> MICHAEL GRAHAM, TELL US,

1024
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
YOU'RE RUNNING.
JUST TELL US LIVE ON TV.

1025
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
>> I WILL SAY THIS.

1026
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN

1027
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
OVERWHELMING, I'M ENERGIZED,

1028
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'M VERY EXCITED, EVERYONE

1029
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'VE SPOKEN TO IS EXTREMELY

1030
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
ENTHUSIASTIC AND I THINK THAT

1031
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
ON SUNDAY, IF WE HAVE A HUGE

1032
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
TURNOUT YOU WILL GET THE

1033
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
ANSWER YOU WANT.

1034
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
>> THAT'S WHEN IT'S OFFICIAL.

1035
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US

1036
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000

CAMP IN LIBYA.

1039
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
U.S. MILITARY OFFICIALS SAY
THEY WERE TO CARRY OUT SIX

1040
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000

1043
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000

TERRORIST FROM FINDING SAFE

1065
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I NEEDED SOMETHING MORE TO HELP
CONTROL MY TYPE 2 DIABETES.

1066
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
MY A1C WASN'T WERE
IT NEEDED TO BE.

1067
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
SO I LIKED WHEN
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME

1068
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
THAT I MAY REACH MY BLOOD
SUGAR AND A1C GOALS

1069
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
BY ACTIVATING WHAT'S WITHIN ME

WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

1071
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

1072
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO
DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO DO,

1073
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.

1074
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
AND IT WORKS 24/7.

1075
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN

1076
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

1077
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

1078
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN
ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

1079
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
WHEN USED WITH
DIET AND EXERCISE.

1080
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

1081
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST
MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,

1082
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES

1083
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.

1084
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY
IF YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER

1085
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
HAS HAD MEDULLARY
THYROID CANCER,

1086
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
IF YOU'VE HAD MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2,

1087
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
OR IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY.

1088
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

1089
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
IF YOU HAVE A LUMP OR
SWELLING IN YOUR NECK,

1090
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
SEVERE PAIN IN
YOUR STOMACH,

1091
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
OR SYMPTOMS SUCH AS ITCHING,
RASH, OR TROUBLE BREATHING.

1092
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY
INCLUDE PANCREATITIS,

1093
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
WHICH CAN BE FATAL.

1094
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN,

1095
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
INCREASES YOUR RISK
FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

1096
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,

1097
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
DECREASED APPETITE
AND INDIGESTION.

1098
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,

1099
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WHICH MAY MAKE EXISTING
KIDNEY PROBLEMS WORSE.

1100
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY MAY HELP
ME REACH MY BLOOD SUGAR GOALS.

1101
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
WITH TRULICITY, I CLICK TO
ACTIVATE WHAT'S WITHIN ME.

1102
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
IF YOU WANT HELP IMPROVING
YOUR A1C AND BLOOD SUGAR,

1103
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
ACTIVATE YOUR WITHIN.

1104
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

1105
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
>> WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND

1106
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
WHEN THIS TAPE CAME OUT?

1107
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
>> WHEN I DO THAT WAS COMING

1108
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
OUT, ALL THE LAWYERS SAID IF

1109
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
YOU WANT TO STOP, STOP.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FORWARD.

1110
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY

1111
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
BEING OFFERED.
THIS WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT

1112
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
OF DAY.
I SAID I CAN'T DO THAT.

1113
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
>> OF THIS TAPE WASN'T LEAKED,

1114
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
SUPPOSE THERE IS NO.

1115
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
[INAUDIBLE]

1116
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
>> THAT'S A PREVIEW OF
TONIGHT'S EPISODE OF OBJECTIVE

1117
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
FIGHT.
HARVEY LEVIN SITTING DOWN WITH

1118
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
HULK HOGAN FOR THAT WIDE

1119
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
RAISING INTERVIEW.

1120
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
HIS USE OF A RACIAL SLUR, AND

1121
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
ALSO THE LOW POINT IN HIS LIFE

1122
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
WHEN HE CONSIDERED SUICIDE.

1123
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
JOINING ME NOW TO TALK MORE

1124
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
ABOUT IT IS THE EXECUTIVE

1125
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
PRODUCER.
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US

1126
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
EVERY.
>> AS SOMEONE WHO COVERS

1127
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
CELEBRITIES AND PROFESSIONAL

1128
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
ATHLETES, I HAVE TO ASK YOU
FIRST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN

1129
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
THE NFL.

1130
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
YOUR REACTION TO THE PROTEST.

1131
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
>> LOOK.

1132
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I AM REALLY UPSET WITH WHAT

1133
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE HERE.

1134
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I THINK IT'S REALLY WRONG FOR

1135
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
SOMEONE IN HIS POSITION TO GET

1136
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
PERSONAL LIKE THAT AND TO CALL

1137
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
THEM SOP.

1138
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
WHAT HE HAS DONE IS HE HAS NOW

1139
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
MADE THIS PARTISAN, POLITICAL,

1140
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
AND THERE ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE

1141
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
WHO WOULD'VE NEVER TAKEN ANY

1142
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE A KNEE.

1143
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
NOW IT DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO DO

1144
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
WITH BLACK LIVES MATTER, IT

1145
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,000
HAS TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.
IN A WAY DIDN'T DO HIMSELF A

1146
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
FAVOR.
I'M PRETTY UPSET BY IT.

1147
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
>> YOU SAT DOWN WITH HIM.

1148
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
YOUR FIRST SHOW WAS ABOUT THE
PRESIDENT.

1149
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
WERE YOU SURPRISED?

1150
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
OR DOES THIS FIT INTO THE

1151
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
PRESIDENT THAT YOU KNOW?

1152
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
>> THERE IS A BIGGER

1153
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
DISCUSSION HERE, BUT I'M NOT

1154
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
SURE I KNOW THE MAN THAT I'M

1155
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
SEEING NOW BECAUSE IT'S
DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSON I

1156
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
KNEW BEFORE.
>> TELL US ABOUT THE SHOW,

1157
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
THERE'S A PRETTY UNIQUE

1158
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
CONCEPT BEHIND IT.

1159
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
>> THE IDEA RICK, IS THAT WE

1160
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
TAKE OBJECTS THAT PEOPLE

1161
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
CHOOSE TO KEEP OVER A

1162
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
LIFETIME, FROM CHILDHOOD ON,

1163
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
AND WE USE THOSE OBJECTS AS

1164
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
KIND OF A JUMPING OFF POINT.

1165
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO CHOOSE

1166
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
THE OBJECT.
THEY ARE INVESTED IN IT AND

1167
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
THEY HAVE CONTROL AT THE

1168
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
BEGINNING.
I THINK IT OPENS THEM UP MORE

1169
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
THAN IF YOU ARE JUST SITTING
ON A SOFA TALKING TO THEM.

1170
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
WE'VE DONE THIS NOW WITH A

1171
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
BUNCH OF PEOPLE, FROM BUSINESS

1172
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
AND SPORTS PEOPLE AND WORLD

1173
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
LEADERS.
IT JUST OPENS PEOPLE UP AND

1174
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS MORE

1175
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
CANDIDLY THAN THEY GENERALLY
DO.

1176
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
>> THE STUFF THAT THEY HAVE

1177
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
SAVED, THEY TALK ABOUT THAT

1178
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
AND RELATE TO THAT AND THAT

1179
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
LEADS THEM INTO MORE PERSONAL

1180
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
STUFF.
>> YES, AND I WILL SAY, THIS

1181
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
IS NOT JUST EXPENSIVE STUFF

1182
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
THAT THEY KEEP.

1183
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
THERE IS ONE ITEM, IT'S IRAQ.

1184
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
IT HAS REAL MEANING TO HIM.

1185
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
WAS PASSED ON TO HIS SON AND

1186
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
BACK TO HIM AND THERE IS

1187
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
MEANING IN THINGS.

1188
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
TYLER HAS A PAIR OF WALMART

1189
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
PAJAMAS THAT REALLY MEAN

1190
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
SOMETHING TO HIM.
THIS IS A VERY RICH MAN.

1191
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
THESE PAJAMAS MEAN SOMETHING

1192
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
TO HIM.
IT'S NOT JUST THE EXPENSIVE

1193
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
STUFF.

1194
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
>> WHAT IS HIS THING THAT HE

1195
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
IDENTIFIES WITH THE MOST.

1196
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
CAN YOU TELL US?

1197
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
>> I WANT TO SAY WHIP CREAM,

1198
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
BUT THERE'S A STORY BEHIND

1199
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
THAT.

1200
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I WILL SAY THIS, THE THING

1201
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
ABOUT MARK, WHO IS JUST A

1202
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
FANTASTIC GUY, MARK, I TALKED

1203
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
TO HIM ABOUT POLITICS AND

1204
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
ABOUT RUNNING AND I CALLED BS

1205
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
ON HIM BECAUSE I DIDN'T

1206
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SAYING,

1207
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
AND HE OPENED UP SOME.
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF

1208
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
MARK MAKES A RUN FOR
PRESIDENT.

1209
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
>> ON THE GUIDE BE SURPRISED
EITHER.

1210
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
THAT WOULD BE SOME SHOWDOWN.

1211
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
>> HE TALKS ABOUT IT AND HE

1212
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
GETS VERY SPECIFIC.

1213
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE

1214
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
SURPRISED.
>> IF SOMEONE WAS DOING IN A

1215
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
AND OBJECTIFY ABOUT YOU, WHAT

1216
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
WOULD BE THAT ONE OBJECT YOU

1217
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
WOULD TALK ABOUT.

1218
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
>> HE PROBABLY INNOCENTLY
WALKED INTO SOMETHING THAT IS

1219
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
SO SUPER EMBARRASSING FOR ME,

1220
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
BUT I WILL TELL YOU RICK.

1221
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
WHEN I PITCHED THE SHOW, WHEN

1222
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I WAS TRYING TO SELL IT, I

1223
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
THOUGHT I HAVE TO HAVE AN

1224
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
OBJECT THAT I CAN BRING IN SO

1225
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I CAN EXPLAIN IT.
WHEN IN TO MY OFFICE IN MY

1226
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
HOME AND THERE WAS A GLOBE
THAT I KEPT SINCE I WAS SIX

1227
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
YEARS OLD.
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

1228
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
SO I PULLED THE GLOBE OFF THE

1229
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
SHELF AND I TOOK IT INTO THE

1230
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
ROOM AND AS I WAS TRYING TO

1231
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
FILM THE SHOW, I LOOK AT THE

1232
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
GLOBE.
THE UNITED STATES ONLY HAD 48

1233
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
STATES.

1234
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
>> WOW.
YOU REALLY DATING YOURSELF.

1235
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
>> WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME

1236
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
TONIGHT.
GOOD LUCK WITH THE SHOW.

1237
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
BE SURE TO WATCH OBJECTIVE

1238
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
FIGHT.
IT AIRS TONIGHT RIGHT AFTER

1239
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
FOX REPORT AT 8:00 P.M.

1240
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
EASTERN.

1241
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
A REPUBLICAN RUNOFF FOR AN

1242
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
ALABAMA SENATE SEAT IS
CAPTURING THE NATION'S

1243
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
ATTENTION.
THE INCUMBENT CANDIDATE HAS

1244
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
THE SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

1245
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
BUT HIS COMPETITION IS PUTTING

1246
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
UP A FIGHT.
THIS RACE COULD COME DOWN TO

1247
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,000
THE WIRE.

1248
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
put under a microscope,

1249
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
we could see all the

1250
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
bacteria that still exists.

1251
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Polident's unique

1252
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
micro clean formula

1253
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
works in just 3 minutes,

1254
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
killing 99.99% of

1255
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
odor causing bacteria.

1256
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
For a cleaner,
fresher,

1257
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
brighter denture
every day.

1258
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
For a cleaner,
fresher,
3 toddlers won't stop him..

1259
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And neither will lower
back pain.

1260
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Because at a Dr. Scholl's Kiosk

1261
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
he got a recommendation for
our Custom Fit Orthotic

1262
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
to relieve his foot,
knee, or lower back pain,

1263
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
from being on his feet.

1264
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Dr. Scholl's.
Born to Move.

1265
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
When food is good
and clean and real,

1266
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
it's ok to crave.

1267
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And with Panera catering,
there's more to go around.

1268
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Panera.
Food as it should be.

1269
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED A
PROCLAMATION IMPLEMENTING

1270
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON EIGHT

1271
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
COUNTRIES.
THIS REPLACES THE EMBATTLED

1272
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
TRAVEL PLAN WHICH JUST EXPIRED
TODAY.

1273
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
SOME OF THE AFFECTED COUNTRIES

1274
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
VENEZUELA AS WELL AS SIX

1275
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
OTHERS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST
AND AFRICA.

1276
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,000
SECRETARY OF STATE REX
TILLERSON SANG WITH THIS

1277
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
PROCLAMATION, THE PRESIDENT IS
CARRYING OUT HIS DUTY TO

1278
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1279
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT WILL
COORDINATE WITH OTHER FEDERAL

1280
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THESE IN

1281
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
AN ORDERLY MATTER.

1282
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
WE CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LOOMING

1288
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
LARGER THAN OTHER.

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
DOES HE THINK THE NFL

1291
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
CRITICISM AT HIS EVENT WILL
CHANGE THIS RACE AT ALL?

1292
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
>> YES HE DOES.

1293
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
HE ACTUALLY THANKS IT WILL
HELP HIM.

1294
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
HE THANKS BEING ASSOCIATED
WITH THAT KIND OF CONDEMNATION

1295
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
OF KNEELING NFL PLAYERS ONLY

1296
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
HOPE HELPS HIS CHANCES.
HE DOES NOT MIND THAT THE BIG

1297
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
HEADLINE FROM HIS OWN CAMPAIGN

1298
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
EVENT WITH SOMETHING OTHER

1299
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
THAN THE PRESIDENT'S

1300
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
ENDORSEMENT.

1301
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
>> I LOVE THAT HEADLINE.

1302
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST

1303
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
PATRIOTIC CITIES IN THE
COUNTRY, HUNTSVILLE AND A

1304
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
PATRIOTIC STATE.

1305
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
WE RESPECT THE FLAG.
EVERYBODY HAS GOT THE RIGHT TO

1306
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
DO WHAT THEY WANT THE COUNTRY

1307
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
BUT THEY OUGHT TO RESPECT THE

1308
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
FLAG AND I THINK IT WAS WELL

1309
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
RECEIVED.
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH THE

1310
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
PRESIDENT MORE.

1311
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000

ALABAMA, THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT

1313
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000

IN ALABAMA, VOTERS REALLY WANT

1314
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
THE PRESIDENT TO SUCCEED AND

1315
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
HE IS OUT OF THIS RUNOFF.

1316
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000

1317
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000

1318
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000

INCLUDING SENATOR MCCONNELL.

1321
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
EVEN THOUGH THESE ARE FROM THE
SAME PARTY, THEY ARE TOTALLY

1322
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
DIFFERENT.
>> WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF

1323
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA WILL

1324
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
GIVE UP THEIR VOTE TO AN

1325
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
ESTABLISHMENT IN WASHINGTON

1326
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
THAT DOES NOT WANT TO MOVE

1327
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
THIS COUNTRY FORWARD.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO MAKE

1328
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
PROGRESS OR STOP ILLEGAL

1329
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000

PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON CAN HOLD

PRESTIGE AND THEIR POSITION.

1334
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
>> SENATOR STRANGE INSISTED

1335
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
THAT HE IS PART OF AN OUTSIDER

1336
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
MOVEMENT AND WAS JUST AS

1337
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
FRUSTRATED WITH MITCH

1338
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
MCCONNELL OVER THE LACK OF

1339
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
PROGRESS DURING THE LAST

1340
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000

1341
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
TURNOUT TOMORROW.

1342
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000

RALLIE RALLIES, STATEWIDE,

1344
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,000
SMALL TURNOUT BUT WHICHEVER
SIDE IS MOST EXCITED BY THEN

1345
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
WILL OBVIOUSLY BE THERE.

1346
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
>> WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

1347
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK

1348
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000

plot twists.

Dad!

1351
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
We also know
you can avoid drama

1352
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
by getting
an annual check-up.

1353
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So we're partnering
with Cigna

1354
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
to remind you to go
see a real doctor.

1355
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Go, know, and take
control of your health.

1356
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It could save
your life.

1357

prevent bleeding gums.

1363
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
If you spit blood

1364
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
when you brush or floss

1365
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
you may have gum problems

1366
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
and could be on the journey

1367
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
to much worse.

1368
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Help stop the journey

1369
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
of gum disease.

1370

chronic, widespread pain.like
most people.

1394
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Fibromyalgia may be invisible to
others, but my pain is real.

1395
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Fibromyalgia is thought to be
caused by overactive nerves.

1396
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
LYRICA is believed to calm these
nerves.

1397
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'm glad my doctor prescribed
LYRICA.

1398
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
For some, LYRICA delivers
effective relief

1399
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
for moderate to even severe
Fibromyalgia pain.

1400
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And improves function.

1401
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
LYRICA may cause serious
allergic reactions,

1402
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
suicidal thoughts or actions.

1403
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000

you have these,

Those who've had a drug or
alcohol problem

1415

LYRICA.
