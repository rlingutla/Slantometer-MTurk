[000:01:18;311] AND SEVERAL FALSE REPORTS, IT
[000:01:19;579] APPEARS THAT FROM A MOUNTAIN OF
[000:01:20;313] EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED AN IMAGE, A
[000:01:21;047] SERIES OF IMAGES THAT LIKELY
[000:01:21;748] SHOW THE BOMBER THAT POLICE ARE
[000:01:25;318] LOOKING FOR.
[000:01:27;420] PARTS OF BOSTON ARE STILL SHUT
[000:01:29;689] DOWN.
[000:01:31;224] IT WAS ANOTHER JITTERY DAY THERE
[000:01:34;828] AFTER A BOMB THREAT AT THE
[000:01:35;495] FEDERAL COURTHOUSE THIS
[000:01:36;930] AFTERNOON.
[000:01:37;363] THIS IS THE BOMBING SCENE

[000:01:40;800] AS WE SAID, NOW PICKS UP SPEED.
[000:01:41;534] WHILE THE FBI IS URGING CAUTION

[000:02:00;186] PROMISING LEADS.
[000:02:01;287] ONE IN PARTICULAR TONIGHT THANKS
[000:02:02;689] TO THE ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES AND
[000:02:03;990] VIDEOS ROUNDED UP IN THE TWO
[000:02:04;958] DAYS SINCE THE BOMBING.
[000:02:07;660] WE ARE GETTING A CLOSE-UP LOOK
[000:02:08;394] AT HOW THE BOMBS WERE MADE.
[000:02:12;198] >> GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.
[000:02:13;900] NO WAY.
[000:02:17;036] >> Reporter: THE FBI SAYS IT IS
[000:02:20;306] GETTING EXACTLY WHAT IT ASKED
[000:02:21;040] FOR.
[000:02:22;041] PICTURES FROM SEVERAL SOURCES
[000:02:22;742] SHOWING SOMEONE CARRYING A HEAVY
[000:02:24;744] BACKPACK OR DUFFEL BAG AND
[000:02:25;411] PLACING IT AT THE SPOT WHERE ONE
[000:02:26;279] BOMB WENT OFF.
[000:02:26;713] ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING
[000:02:27;347] IMAGES, THEY SAY, COMES FROM A
[000:02:28;081] DEPARTMENT STORE SURVEILLANCE
[000:02:29;149] CAMERA HIGH UP ON A BUILDING,
[000:02:30;550] ABLE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE CROWD.
[000:02:33;119] ON A DAY WHEN INCORRECT NEWS
[000:02:34;821] REPORTS OF AN ARREST DISTRACTED
[000:02:36;523] OFFICIALS, INVESTIGATORS WERE
[000:02:37;690] WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO
[000:02:38;391] DISCOVER, FIND, AND INTERVIEW
[000:02:39;092] THAT PERSON.
[000:02:46;199] THAT'S AT THE SCENE OF THE
[000:02:49;035] SECOND BOMBING FOLLOWING THE
[000:02:51;171] FIRST BY ABOUT 15 SECONDS.
[000:02:51;804] IT'S THAT SECOND SPOT SHOWN ON
[000:02:52;539] THIS PICTURE SENT TO NBC STATION
[000:02:55;942] WHDH SHOWING A GARBAGE BAG NEXT
[000:02:58;745] TO A TRASH CAN.
[000:02:59;212] WHILE INVESTIGATORS CANNOT BE
[000:02:59;913] SURE THAT BAG CONTAINED THE BOMB
[000:03:00;647] FEDERAL OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS
[000:03:01;381] THAT IS THE SPOT WHERE THE
[000:03:02;048] SECOND BOMB WENT OFF.
[000:03:02;615] FORMER ATF BOMB INVESTIGATOR JIM
[000:03:03;683] CAVANAUGH SAID IT IS OBVIOUS TO
[000:03:04;984] HIM LOOKING AT THE PICTURES.
[000:03:06;853] >> LARGE INJURIES WERE ON THE
[000:03:08;221] SIDE OF IT.
[000:03:09;389] DEBRIS FIELD TO THE LEFT.
[000:03:11;524] SOME PROTECTED AREAS OVER ON THE
[000:03:13;526] RIGHT SIDE THAT INDICATE THE
[000:03:15;628] BLAST WAS TO ONE SIDE OF THE
[000:03:17;230] TRASH RECEPTACLE.
[000:03:17;730] THIS WAS THE SCENE OF THE BLAST.
[000:03:19;199] >> Reporter: WE ARE ALSO SEEING
[000:03:19;933] CLOSE-UP PHOTOS OF THE ACTUAL
[000:03:29;909] PIECES OF THE BOMB.
[000:03:30;443] SHOWING THE PRESSURE COOKER
[000:03:31;578] DEFORMED BY THE BLAST, ONE OF
[000:03:32;278] ITS LIDS BLOWN TO THE TOP OF A
[000:03:33;012] NEARBY BUILDING.
[000:03:33;479] THEY ARE A FAVORITE OF BOMB
[000:03:34;147] MAKERS BECAUSE EXPLOSIVE
[000:03:34;781] PRESSURE BUILDS UP BEFORE IT IS
[000:03:35;515] RELEASED.
[000:03:35;882] INVESTIGATORS CAN NOW BEGIN TO
[000:03:36;616] TRACE DOWN WHERE COMPONENTS WERE
[000:03:37;350] BOUGHT SINCE THEY KNOW THE MAKER
[000:03:39;152] OF THE PRESSURE COOKER, THE
[000:03:41;888] TYPE OF RECHARGEABLE FLASHLIGHT
[000:03:44;224] BATTERIES USED -- MADE IN CHINA,
[000:03:46;159] BUT WIDELY AVAILABLE --
[000:03:47;760] AND EVEN THE TYPE OF WIRE --
[000:03:48;461] ALSO MADE IN CHINA -- USED TO
[000:03:49;162] HOOK THE MAIN COMPONENTS
[000:03:49;796] TOGETHER.
[000:03:50;230] BOMB TECHNICIANS ARE EXAMINING
[000:03:51;331] TWO ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
[000:03:56;002] INCLUDED IN THE BOMBS TO SEE
[000:03:56;903] WHETHER THEY WERE PARTS OF
[000:03:57;570] TIMERS OR RECEIVERS FOR A REMOTE
[000:03:58;304] DETONATION SIGNAL.
[000:03:59;339] ALL POTENTIALLY PROMISING LEADS,
[000:04:00;073] SAYS A BOMB EXPERT.
[000:04:02;842] >> IT DEPENDS ON HOW UNIQUE THE
[000:04:04;210] BOMB COMPONENTS ARE, HOW
[000:04:05;578] IDENTIFIABLE THE CHARACTERISTICS
[000:04:07;847] ARE, WHAT OTHER FORENSICS
[000:04:09;983] INVOLVED IN THAT, WHETHER IT BE
[000:04:11;818] FINGERPRINTS, DNA, ET CETERA.
[000:04:13;553] >> Reporter: INVESTIGATORS ARE
[000:04:15;521] OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY ARE CLOSE
[000:04:18;758] TO THE ANSWER OF WHO DID THIS
[000:04:20;393] AND WHY IN AN INVESTIGATION
[000:04:21;060] THAT'S MOVING VERY RAPIDLY ON
[000:04:21;761] SEVERAL FRONTS.
[000:04:26;332] >> ABOUT THAT RAPID SPEED AND
[000:04:27;166] OPTIMISM, PETE WILLIAMS, THANKS.
[000:04:27;900] WE WANT TO BRING IN THE FORMER
[000:04:28;635] DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

[000:04:33;706] MICHAEL LEITER IS OUR NBC NEWS
[000:04:35;141] COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST.
[000:04:39;145] YOU RECEIVED FROM YOUR SOURCES A
[000:04:40;313] CAUTION TODAY THAT THIS PERHAPS
[000:04:43;416] WAS RUNNING ON AHEAD OF ITSELF.
[000:04:44;817] AND THIS CAN HAVE A BAD EFFECT
[000:04:46;352] ON AN INVESTIGATION.
[000:04:46;953] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:04:48;421] WITH ALL THE MEDIA REPORTING
[000:04:49;122] ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ARRESTS, THEY
[000:04:49;922] ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE
[000:04:51;190] PERSON OR PEOPLE BEING SPOOKED
[000:04:53;926] AND THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT
[000:04:54;794] EXPECTATIONS AT THIS POINT.
[000:04:56;062] FOR A WHILE PEOPLE WERE SAYING
[000:04:56;796] IT'S NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH.
[000:05:01;901] NOW PEOPLE EXPECT AN ARREST IN
[000:05:07;573] THE NEAR HOURS AND THE FACT IS
[000:05:08;308] KNOWING THE PERSON IT CAN STILL
[000:05:09;042] TAKE SOME TIME.
[000:05:10;576] >> NOW ABOUT THE EVIDENCE.
[000:05:13;246] WE HAVE A BIG HAYSTACK HERE.
[000:05:13;913] SO FAR WE HAVE FOUND SOME OF THE
[000:05:14;647] NEEDLES DOWN TO THE ZIPPER PULL
[000:05:15;381] ON WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE BAG
[000:05:16;115] AND THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY.
[000:05:16;816] WE ALSO HAVE IMAGERY -- TONS OF
[000:05:17;950] IT -- AND THAT HAS TO BE A BIG
[000:05:19;218] EARLY HELP.
[000:05:20;520] >> THAT IS INVALUABLE.
[000:05:24;490] IT'S SOMETHING EVEN THREE OR
[000:05:25;191] FOUR YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE
[000:05:26;626] HAD.
[000:05:27;760] ALL OF THAT IMAGERY FROM THE
[000:05:29;329] STORES, THE POLICE AND PEOPLE,
[000:05:30;296] YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE
[000:05:32;732] FORENSIC EVIDENCE AND THE SECRET
[000:05:33;466] INTELLIGENCE WE ARE NOT HEARING
[000:05:37;737] ABOUT FROM HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
[000:05:38;438] SOURCES, CELL PHONE RECORDS,
[000:05:39;138] THINGS LIKE THAT.
[000:05:39;639] THAT PAINTS THE MOSAIC FROM
[000:05:42;875] WHICH THEY FIND THEIR SUSPECT.
[000:05:43;609] >> YESTERDAY AT THE AIRPORT,
[000:05:44;310] LOGAN AIRPORT IN BOSTON, THEY
[000:05:46;079] WERE TELLING PEOPLE, BEFORE YOU
[000:05:46;813] LEAVE OUR CITY, DO YOU HAVE
[000:05:47;480] ANYTHING, DO YOU REMEMBER
[000:05:48;114] ANYTHING?
[000:05:52;085] ALL OF THAT HELPS.
[000:05:53;720] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:05:57;323] EVERY BIT OF IT.
[000:05:57;790] IT DOES ONE MORE THING.
[000:05:58;391] IT SHOWS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO
[000:06:00;760] BE INVOLVED IN THIS.
[000:06:01;294] IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT SAYING FBI
[000:06:02;028] WILL GO GET THEM.
[000:06:02;528] PEOPLE BEFORE AN ATTACK, AFTER
[000:06:03;262] AN ATTACK, THE PUBLIC HAS A HUGE
[000:06:03;996] ROLE TO PLAY IN HELPING THEM
[000:06:04;697] FIND SOMEONE AND BEING RESILIENT
[000:06:05;431] AFTER.
[000:06:05;765] >> THE DEFINITION OF SOCIAL
[000:06:06;432] MEDIA.
[000:06:06;733] MICHAEL LEITER, THANK YOU FOR
[000:06:07;600] YOUR REPORTING ALL DAY.
[000:06:09;502] >>> AS WE SAID IT'S BEEN A DAY
[000:06:10;436] OF RAPIDLY MOVING DEVELOPMENTS.
[000:06:12;171] AS INVESTIGATORS CONTINUE TO DO
[000:06:14;707] THEIR WORK, DOCTORS CONTINUE TO
[000:06:21;414] DO THEIRS IN BOSTON.
[000:06:23;316] AFTER SAVING SO MANY LIVES,
[000:06:25;918] AFTER DEALING, REMEMBER, WITH
[000:06:27;954] WHAT LOOKED LIKE COMBAT
[000:06:29;722] INJURIES, SOME VICTIMS ARE NOW
[000:06:31;357] LEAVING THE HOSPITAL TELLING
[000:06:32;892] THEIR STORIES FOR THE FIRST

[000:10:29;128] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:10:32;398] WE CAN STILL BRING ABOUT
[000:10:34;266] MEANINGFUL CHANGES THAT REDUCE
[000:10:35;801] GUN VIOLENCE SO LONG AS THE

[000:16:40;032] QUOTE, TO SEE A WRONG AND NOT
[000:16:43;869] EXPOSE IT IS TO BECOME A SILENT
[000:16:45;571] PARTNER TO ITS CONTINUANCE.
[000:16:46;705] A PHRASE OFTEN USED BY RADICAL
[000:16:48;173] GROUPS.
[000:16:52;244] BOTH LETTERS ARE SIGNED, I AM KC
[000:16:53;946] AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE.
