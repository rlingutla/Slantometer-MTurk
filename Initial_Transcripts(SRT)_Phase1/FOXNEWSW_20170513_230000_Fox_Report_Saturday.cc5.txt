[000:00:20;820] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP DEALS WITH
[000:00:23;156] THE FALL OUT FROM HIS DECISION
[000:00:24;657] TO FIRE JAMES COMEY AND THE
[000:00:26;593] WAR OF WORDS THAT FOLLOW.
[000:00:30;397] GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, I'M
[000:00:32;032] JULIE AND THIS IS THE FOX
[000:00:32;832] REPORT.
[000:00:33;800] JULIE: THE PRESIDENT
[000:00:35;135] DELIVERING HIS FIRST
[000:00:35;668] COMMENCEMENT SPEECH SINCE
[000:00:37;070] TAKING OFFICE.
[000:00:39;372] TO GRADUATES AT LIBERTY
[000:00:41;674] UNIVERSITY HE REFLECTED ON THE
[000:00:42;909] FIRST FEW MONTHS OF HIS
[000:00:44;177] PRESIDENCY AND SHARED LESSONS
[000:00:45;378] THAT HE HAS LEARNED AND
[000:00:45;979] OFFERED ADVICE TO THE
[000:00:47;313] GRADUATES, CALLING THEM THE
[000:00:48;114] NEXT GENERATION OF AMERICAN
[000:00:48;782] LEADERS.
[000:00:50;550] MEANWHILE BACK IN DC, AT LEAST
[000:00:52;052] EIGHT CANDIDATES TO LEAD THE
[000:00:53;953] FBI VISITED THE JUSTICE
[000:00:55;388] DEPARTMENT FOR INTERVIEWS
[000:00:58;391] TODAY IN THE SEARCH TO REPLACE
[000:01:00;293] FIRED DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY,
[000:01:01;795] WHO PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE
[000:01:03;096] WILL RERE: PLACE BY NEXT
[000:01:03;696] FRIDAY.
[000:01:05;432] NOW, THE NEW YORK TIMES IS
[000:01:06;733] REPORTING THIS WEEK PRESIDENT
[000:01:08;435] TRUMP DEMANDED A PLEDGE OF
[000:01:10;370] LOYALTY FROM COMEY SHORTLY
[000:01:11;438] AFTER TAKING OFFICE.
[000:01:13;273] SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:01:13;907] DENIES.
[000:01:14;240] PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE
[000:01:15;875] MEANTIME SAID SUCH A QUESTION
[000:01:18;011] WOULDN'T BE INAPPROPRIATE IN A
[000:01:20;814] CONVERSATION WITH JUDGE, WHICH
[000:01:22;015] CAN BE SEEN LATER TONIGHT.
[000:01:23;650] BUT WE'VE GOT A PREVIEW.
[000:01:24;250] WATCH.
[000:01:25;718] >> PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT THE
[000:01:29;289] QUESTION THAT APPARENTLY THE
[000:01:31;691] NEW YORK ASKED COMEY WHETHER
[000:01:33;893] OR NOT YOU HAD HIS LOYALTY WAS
[000:01:34;994] POSSIBLY INAPPROPRIATE.
[000:01:35;829] COULD YOU SEE HOW THEY WOULD
[000:01:36;496] THINK THAT?
[000:01:37;864] >> NO.  I READ THAT ARTICLE.
[000:01:38;932] I DON'T THINK IT'S
[000:01:39;899] INAPPROPRIATE, NUMBER ONE.
[000:01:41;534] >> DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?
[000:01:42;302] >> NO.
[000:01:42;602] NO, I DIDN'T.
[000:01:43;770] BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A
[000:01:44;637] BAD QUESTION TO ASK.
[000:01:45;772] I THINK LOYALTY TO THE
[000:01:46;339] COUNTRY.
[000:01:46;773] LOYALTY TO THE UNITED STATES
[000:01:49;008] IS IMPORTANT.  YOU KNOW, I
[000:01:50;510] MEAN, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU
[000:01:51;177] DEFINE LOYALTY.
[000:01:52;679] NUMBER ONE.
[000:01:54;080] NUMBER TWO, I DON'T KNOW HOW
[000:01:55;315] THAT GOT THERE BECAUSE I
[000:01:57;450] DIDN'T ASK THAT QUESTION.
[000:01:59;352] >> WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT IN
[000:02:00;987] A TWEET YOU SAID THAT THERE
[000:02:02;388] MIGHT BE TAPE-RECORDINGS?
[000:02:04;357] TRUMP: THAT, I CAN'T TALK
[000:02:04;991] ABOUT.
[000:02:05;291] I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.
[000:02:07;594] ALL I WANT IS FOR COMEY TO BE
[000:02:08;595] HONEST, AND I HOPE HE WILL BE,
[000:02:10;096] AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE.
[000:02:11;097] I HOPE.
[000:02:12;098] JULIE: ALL OF THIS IN THE
[000:02:13;933] SHADOW OF A REPORT NOW
[000:02:15;535] BREAKING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS
[000:02:17;137] TEST FIRED YET ANOTHER
[000:02:18;238] BALLISTIC MISSILE, AND WE HAVE
[000:02:20;673] FOX NEWS TEAM COVERAGE FOR YOU
[000:02:22;542] TONIGHT.
[000:02:24;310] ELLISON BARBER WATCHING THE
[000:02:25;512] SEARCH FOR FBI DIRECTOR, BUT
[000:02:26;913] WE BEGIN WITH CAROLINE WHO
[000:02:28;548] JOINS US NOW LIVE AT THE WHITE
[000:02:30;950] HOUSE WITH THE LATEST ON THE
[000:02:33;153] PRESIDENT'S DECISION TO
[000:02:34;020] DISMISS JAMES COMEY.
[000:02:35;288] WHAT IS THE FALLOUT TODAY?
[000:02:36;856] >> I THINK THE CALLS FOR THE
[000:02:37;590] INDEPENDENT COMMISSIONER
[000:02:39;159] GETTING LOUDER THIS WEEKEND.
[000:02:39;993] THAT COULD POTENTIALLY
[000:02:41;494] INVESTIGATE IF THERE WERE ANY
[000:02:42;428] TIES BETWEEN THE TRUMP
[000:02:43;830] CAMPAIGN OR TRUMP SURROGATES
[000:02:44;998] AND RUSSIA.
[000:02:47;167] THE FBI WAS LEADING ONE OF THE
[000:02:48;234] MAIN INVESTIGATIONS ALREADY IN
[000:02:49;736] PLACE IN WASHINGTON WHEN
[000:02:51;671] MR. TRUMP FIRED COMEY THIS
[000:02:52;305] WEEK.
[000:02:53;072] THAT INVESTIGATION CONTINUES
[000:02:54;073] STRONGLY THIS WEEKEND.
[000:02:56;943] HERE'S WHAT MR. TRUMP TOLD
[000:02:58;411] JENIN PIRO.
[000:02:59;879] >> I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A
[000:03:01;648] POSITION WHERE IT'S NOT DONE
[000:03:02;315] CORRECTLY.
[000:03:03;449] SO LET THEM DO IT CORRECTLY.
[000:03:05;218] LET THEM TAKE THEIR TIME.
[000:03:07;153] LET THEM DO IT CORRECTLY.
[000:03:08;454] I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSE,
[000:03:10;356] THE SENATE, THE FBI.
[000:03:12;358] >> SO, NO, INDEPENDENT
[000:03:12;926] COMMISSION?
[000:03:13;893] TRUMP: I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
[000:03:14;594] IT.
[000:03:16;296] I MEAN, HONESTLY, WHATEVER'S
[000:03:18;331] GOING TO DO THE BEST.
[000:03:19;098] >> BUT IT'S CONGRESS THAT
[000:03:20;633] WOULD MAKE THE DECISION ON
[000:03:21;834] WHETHER OR NOT AN INDEPENDENT
[000:03:22;835] COUNSEL IS NEEDED IN THIS
[000:03:23;836] CASE.
[000:03:24;637] MR. TRUMP ALSO CAUSED
[000:03:26;406] CONTROVERSY THIS WEEK WHEN HE
[000:03:27;574] TWEETED, AND MR. COMEY TWEETED
[000:03:29;209] TO THE PRESS HE BETTER HOPE
[000:03:30;710] THERE ARE NO TAPES OF THE
[000:03:31;344] CONVERSATIONS.
[000:03:32;412] THE WHITE HOUSE HAS FAILED TO
[000:03:33;213] ELABORATE ON THAT THIS
[000:03:33;780] WEEKEND.
[000:03:36;249] BUT WE ARE TOLD BY SENATOR
[000:03:38;651] MARK WARNER IF THOSE TAPES DO
[000:03:39;852] INDEED EXIST, CONGRESS WANTS
[000:03:40;520] THEM.
[000:03:40;853] JULIE.
[000:03:41;754] JULIE: VERY INTERESTING.
[000:03:43;890] WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT
[000:03:45;291] NORTH KOREA'S MISSILE LAUNCH?
[000:03:46;192] WAS IT SUCCESSFUL?
[000:03:47;994] IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN.
[000:03:48;728] SOUTH KOREA'S REPORTING THAT
[000:03:50;797] THIS LAUNCH WENT ABOUT
[000:03:51;364] 435 MILES.
[000:03:52;899] IF THAT'S TRUE, IT WOULD BE
[000:03:55;101] CONSIDERED A SUCCESS.
[000:03:55;735] A PENTAGON OFFICIAL CONFIRMS
[000:03:57;770] THE FOX NEWS THAT NORTH KOREA
[000:03:59;472] LAUNCHED SOME TYPE OF
[000:04:00;039] BALLISTIC MISSILE THAT
[000:04:02;175] OFFICIAL SAYS THE U.S. PACIFIC
[000:04:03;309] COMMAND AND STRATEGIC COMMAND
[000:04:04;711] ARE STILL SATISFYING.
[000:04:06;112] IF THIS INITIAL REPORTING
[000:04:08;448] BEARS OUT, THIS WOULD BE
[000:04:10;350] KIM JONG-UN'S FIFTH ATTEMPT AT
[000:04:11;818] THE BALLISTIC LAUNCH THIS PAST
[000:04:13;987] MONTH AND HIS SUCCESSFUL ONE.
[000:04:15;888] A NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM HAS
[000:04:17;490] BEGIN OVER THE DETAILS WITH
[000:04:18;491] MR. TRUMP HERE AT THE WHITE
[000:04:19;158] HOUSE.
[000:04:20;426] THE TIMING, THOUGH, JULIE, IS
[000:04:21;327] VERY CURIOUS ON THIS.
[000:04:22;895] THIS COMES ON THE SAME DAY
[000:04:24;731] THAT A NORTH KOREAN SENIOR
[000:04:26;032] DIPLOMAT SAID THAT THE NORTH
[000:04:27;767] WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SITTING
[000:04:29;135] DOWN WITH U.S. OFFICIALS IF
[000:04:31;471] CONDITIONS WERE SET RIGHT.
[000:04:32;105] JULIE.
[000:04:32;405] .
[000:04:33;039] JULIE: ALL RIGHT, CAROLINE,
[000:04:34;374] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:04:35;908] AND FOR MORE ON ALL OF THIS,
[000:04:38;411] TUNE IN LATER TONIGHT TO JUDGE
[000:04:41;247] JENIN PIRO'S CONVERSATION WITH
[000:04:41;948] PRESIDENT TRUMP WHERE HE ALSO
[000:04:43;549] ADDRESSES HIS REMARKS ABOUT
[000:04:46;286] ENDING LIVE WHITE HOUSE PRESS
[000:04:47;854] BRIEFINGS.
[000:04:49;055] TRUMP: WHEN WE HAVE THOSE
[000:04:50;056] PRESS CONFERENCES, I ACTUALLY
[000:04:51;190] SAID WE SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM
[000:04:52;892] BECAUSE SARAH HUCKABEE --
[000:04:53;860] >> 100 YEARS WE'VE BEEN
[000:04:54;460] DOING.
[000:04:55;428] YOU CAN'T PUT AN END TO THAT.
[000:04:56;195] >> THERE'S NEVER BEEN ACTION
[000:04:56;863] LIKE THIS.
[000:04:57;230] THIS IS CRAZY.
[000:04:59;432] I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING HIGHER
[000:05:00;466] RATINGS -- THEY'RE GETTING
[000:05:02;068] HIGHER RATINGS ON THIS PRESS
[000:05:02;735] CONFERENCES.
[000:05:03;303] >> WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY
[000:05:05;104] CONSIDER STOPPING THESE PRESS
[000:05:05;805] SESSIONS?
[000:05:06;873] >> NO, WE WOULD DO IT IN A
[000:05:07;507] DIFFERENT WAY.
[000:05:08;374] JULIE: YOU CAN SEE THE REST OF
[000:05:09;509] THAT CONVERSATION TONIGHT ON
[000:05:10;843] JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JENIN, IT
[000:05:14;247] AIRS 9:00 P.M. EASTERN RIGHT
[000:05:15;982] HERE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:05:17;650] SO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS
[000:05:18;318] INTERVIEWING CANDIDATES.
[000:05:19;852] THAT'S GOING ON ALL DAY TODAY
[000:05:20;887] TO TAKE OVER THE REIGNS OF THE
[000:05:21;587] FBI.
[000:05:23;489] AND THERE ARE NOW AT LEAST
[000:05:24;891] EIGHT NAMES TOSSED IN THE
[000:05:25;525] MIX.
[000:05:26;592] THIS AFTER THE FIRING OF JAMES
[000:05:28;628] COMEY, THE FBI DIRECTOR.
[000:05:29;529] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THE
[000:05:31;297] WHITE HOUSE COULD NAME COMEY'S
[000:05:34;100] REPLACEMENT AS EARLY AS
[000:05:35;468] FRIDAY.
[000:05:37;203] ALLISON BARBER JOINS US LIVE
[000:05:38;104] FROM WASHINGTON OUTSIDE OF THE
[000:05:39;706] DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
[000:05:42;308] ALLISON, EIGHT INTERVIEWEES.
[000:05:43;309] WE UNDERSTAND THAT IS IT.
[000:05:45;111] THERE WILL BE NONE TOMORROW.
[000:05:46;446] ANYONE TALKING AS THEY LEAVE?
[000:05:48;448] >> NO.
[000:05:49;849] MOST OF THEM AREN'T EVEN
[000:05:50;750] STOPPING THEIR CARS.
[000:05:52;852] AT BEST, THEY ARE SAYING NO
[000:05:54;420] COMMENT IN THE LAST HOUR,
[000:05:56;522] THOUGH, WE HAVE HAD TWO LAST
[000:05:57;590] MINUTE INTERVIEW ADDITIONS.
[000:05:59;625] ONE IS A FORMER HOMELAND
[000:06:00;927] SECURITY ADVISER TO GEORGE W.
[000:06:04;864] BUSH AND THE OTHER IS A FORMER
[000:06:06;866] MICHIGAN CONGRESSMAN MIKE
[000:06:07;667] RODGERS, WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE
[000:06:08;368] CAP FOR TODAY.
[000:06:09;769] AS YOU SAID, THAT WOULD PUT US
[000:06:10;636] AT EIGHT.
[000:06:12;772] SOURCES ARE DESCRIBING THESE
[000:06:13;940] MEETINGS AS SUBSTANTIVE
[000:06:14;540] DISCUSSIONS.
[000:06:16;709] GREAT CANDIDATES, SUPREMELY
[000:06:17;377] WELL-QUALIFIED.
[000:06:19;445] NOW, THE ADMINISTRATION IS
[000:06:20;713] REPORTEDLY CONSIDERING ABOUT A
[000:06:21;948] DOZEN CANDIDATES FOR THIS
[000:06:22;849] JOB.
[000:06:24;650] THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A
[000:06:25;718] DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
[000:06:27;320] ALREADY INTERVIEWED A HANDFUL
[000:06:29;288] OF THEM TODAY, INCLUDING
[000:06:31;190] ACTING FBI DIRECTOR ANDREW
[000:06:32;692] MCCABE, MICHAEL GARCIA, WHO
[000:06:34;527] WAS A JUDGE FROM NEW YORK,
[000:06:37;330] SITTING TEXAS GOVERNOR, ALEX
[000:06:39;365] FISHER, HENRY HUDSON, A
[000:06:41;267] VIRGINIA JUDGE, AND SPECIAL
[000:06:42;268] AGENT ADAM LEE.
[000:06:43;736] NOW, THE LAST INTERVIEW WE'RE
[000:06:45;471] EXPECTING TO SEE TODAY IS MIKE
[000:06:46;172] RODGERS.
[000:06:47;006] HE SHOULD BE HERE WITHIN THE
[000:06:47;673] HOUR.
[000:06:49;242] HE RECEIVED A VERY BIG
[000:06:51;210] ENDORSEMENT TODAY FROM THE FBI
[000:06:52;545] AGENTS ASSOCIATION.
[000:06:54;247] THEY REPRESENT A LOT OF ACTIVE
[000:06:56;449] AND A FORMER FBI AGENT MIKE
[000:06:58;251] RODGERS WAS IN THE FBI HIMSELF
[000:06:59;552] BEFORE HE LEFT TO GO INTO
[000:07:00;920] POLITICS.
[000:07:01;320] JULIE.
[000:07:01;621] .
[000:07:01;988] JULIE: ALL RIGHT.  AND WHAT IS
[000:07:03;623] THE TIMETABLE FOR ALL OF
[000:07:04;223] THIS?
[000:07:05;091] COULD THE ADMINISTRATION MAKE
[000:07:07;226] A DECISION SOON?
[000:07:08;594] >> WELL, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
[000:07:09;529] THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THERE COULD
[000:07:11;764] BE A DECISION AS EARLY AS THIS
[000:07:12;465] WEEK.
[000:07:13;566] TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID
[000:07:15;001] ON AIR FORCE ONE.
[000:07:20;273] >> ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE VERY
[000:07:21;674] WELL KNOWN.  YOU KNOW, THEY'VE
[000:07:23;443] BEEN VETTED OVER THEIR
[000:07:24;444] LIFETIME, ESSENTIALLY.
[000:07:25;678] BUT VERY WELL KNOWN.
[000:07:27;146] HIGHLY RESPECTED.
[000:07:28;548] REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE.
[000:07:29;982] AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT OF THE
[000:07:32;218] FBI.
[000:07:34;053] >> THE FBI DIRECTOR IS A
[000:07:35;087] POSITION THAT TYPICALLY LASTS
[000:07:37;323] FOR TEN YEARS AND BEFORE THAT
[000:07:39;125] TENURE CAN BEGIN, THE
[000:07:40;326] CANDIDATE WOULD NEED SENATE
[000:07:41;227] CONFIRMATION.
[000:07:41;894] JULIE, BACK TO YOU.
[000:07:43;596] JULIE: ALL RIGHT, ELLISON,
[000:07:44;964] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:07:49;702] A FOX NEWS ALERT WITH THE
[000:07:52;605] PENTAGON CONFIRMING RIGHT NOW
[000:07:54;207] NORTH KOREA HAS LAUNCHED SOME
[000:07:55;741] KIND OF BALLISTIC MISSILE.
[000:07:57;844] THEY APPARENTLY TEST FIRED IT

[000:08:00;546] OF THE COUNTRY.
[000:08:02;482] WE ARE AWAITING THE PENTAGON'S
[000:08:04;083] RESPONSE AND ASSESSMENT.
[000:08:06;118] WE ARE ALSO AWAITING A
[000:08:07;186] RESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:08:08;621] ON ALL OF THIS.
[000:08:10;790] THIS LATEST LAUNCH COMES AMID
[000:08:12;024] HEIGHTENED TENSIONS BETWEEN
[000:08:14;260] THE U.S. AND KIM JONG-UN AFTER
[000:08:16;662] A SERIES OF FAILED LAUNCH
[000:08:17;663] ATTEMPTS.
[000:08:18;664] AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S, IN
[000:08:21;801] ESSENCEPRESIDENTPRESIDENT
[000:08:26;005] TRUMP'S INSISTENCE ALL OPTIONS
[000:08:27;373] ARE ON THE TABLE.
[000:08:31;444] WOULD BE WILLING TO ENGAGE IN
[000:08:32;245] DIALOGUE WITH THE TRUMP
[000:08:32;945] ADMINISTRATION IF THE
[000:08:34;747] CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT.
[000:08:36;148] JOINING ME NOW WITH ANALYSIS
[000:08:37;250] ON ALL OF THIS, JORDAN, AN
[000:08:38;885] EXPERT ON ASIA, AUTHOR OF
[000:08:40;286] NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA
[000:08:40;987] TAKES ON THE WORLD.
[000:08:41;687] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
[000:08:42;288] TALKING TO US.
[000:08:43;723] NOT THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD
[000:08:46;225] TO TALK HERE UNDER THESE SORT
[000:08:47;426] OF CONDITIONS IN THAT NORTH,
[000:08:48;961] ONCE AGAIN, HAS TEST FIRED
[000:08:49;962] ANOTHER MISSILE IN THE PAST
[000:08:51;864] AND, IN FACT, IN THE LAST
[000:08:53;666] MONTH, YOU THOUGHT PERHAPS IT
[000:08:55;701] WAS A FAILED LAUNCH THAT WAS
[000:08:56;769] BEING REPORTED BUT YOU, IN
[000:08:58;204] FACT, THOUGHT IT WAS
[000:09:01;240] INTENTIONAL FOR IT TO LAND ON
[000:09:02;008] NORTH KOREA'S SOIL SO THAT THE
[000:09:03;042] EVIDENCE WOULDN'T BE
[000:09:04;377] ACCESSIBLE TO OTHERS.
[000:09:06;012] WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED
[000:09:07;079] HERE?
[000:09:08;447] >> WELL, 435 MILES IS A
[000:09:09;549] SUCCESSFUL TEST, AND I THINK
[000:09:11;083] WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN'S ARE
[000:09:13;519] DOING IS BY THE TIMING OF THIS
[000:09:14;620] LAUNCH, THEY ARE THINKING THAT
[000:09:16;923] THAT IS GOING TO HELP THEM GET
[000:09:18;224] THESE NEGOTIATIONS STARTED.
[000:09:20;326] THE ONE THING NORTH KOREA
[000:09:21;460] SEEMS TO WANT, BECAUSE WE'VE
[000:09:22;862] SEEN IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE
[000:09:23;863] DAYS A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES
[000:09:26;098] IN THIS REGARD, THEY SEEM TO
[000:09:27;600] WANT RELIEF FROM SANCTIONS.
[000:09:29;101] AND OF COURSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:09:30;803] IS GOING THE OTHER WAY WANTING
[000:09:33;139] TO PUT ON TOUGHER SANCTIONS ON
[000:09:34;440] NORTH KOREA, SO THIS IS COMING
[000:09:35;341] TO A HEAD.
[000:09:37;143] AND I THINK THE MISSILE LAUNCH
[000:09:39;679] WAS AN ATTEMPT AGAINST THE
[000:09:42;381] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND MOON,
[000:09:43;583] THE NEW PRESIDENT OF
[000:09:44;984] SOUTH KOREA TO THE BARGAINING
[000:09:45;685] TABLE.
[000:09:46;485] JULIE: SO YOU THINK THIS WAS
[000:09:47;553] AN INTENTIONAL MESSAGE?
[000:09:49;255] THIS TEST LAUNCH TODAY WAS AN
[000:09:50;957] INTENTIONAL MESSAGE TO
[000:09:52;058] PRESIDENT TRUMP?
[000:09:53;025] >> YES.  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE
[000:09:54;460] DIDN'T SEE A MISSILE LAUNCH IN
[000:09:57;063] THE RUN-UP TO THE SOUTH KOREAN
[000:09:57;763] ELECTIONS.
[000:09:59;599] AND THE REASON IS THAT THE
[000:10:00;967] CANDIDATE THAT NORTH KOREA
[000:10:03;402] WANTED WHO EVENTUALLY WON WAS
[000:10:04;103] LEADING.
[000:10:05;805] AND I THINK THEY WANTED TO
[000:10:07;139] PREVENT ANYTHING FROM
[000:10:08;841] HAPPENING THAT WOULD DERAIL
[000:10:10;176] HIS CANDIDACY.
[000:10:11;577] NOW THAT MOON IS ACTUALLY
[000:10:13;279] PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA, WE
[000:10:15;381] KNOW THAT MOON WANTS TO START
[000:10:16;382] TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:10:17;917] HE ALSO WANTS TO PROVIDE AIDE
[000:10:21;787] TO THE NORTH KOREAN'S.
[000:10:22;421] SO I THINK THE NORTH KOREAN'S
[000:10:24;624] RIGHT NOW THINK THAT THIS IS A
[000:10:26;859] PERFECT TIME FOR THEM TO
[000:10:27;660] REALLY CORRAL THE
[000:10:28;394] INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
[000:10:29;161] INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.
[000:10:30;663] GET THEM TO SIT DOWN AND DO
[000:10:32;398] WHAT NORTH KOREA WANTS.
[000:10:33;866] JULIE: IN LATE APRIL, THE
[000:10:34;867] PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD
[000:10:37;637] WARNED IN AN INTERVIEW TO
[000:10:39;705] REUTERS THAT A QUOTE MAJOR,
[000:10:40;740] MAJOR CONFLICT WITH THE NORTH
[000:10:41;741] WAS POSSIBLE, BUT THAT HE
[000:10:43;442] WOULD PREFER A DIPLOMATIC
[000:10:45;244] OUTCOME TO THE DISPUTE OVER
[000:10:47;380] ITS NUCLEAR MISSILE PROGRAMS.
[000:10:50;850] AND THEN WE HEAR ABOUT THIS
[000:10:52;818] PERSON FROM THE REGION FROM
[000:10:55;221] THAT REGION SAYING THEY WOULD
[000:10:57;590] CONSIDER SITTING DOWN WITH THE
[000:10:58;290] U.S.
[000:10:58;557] PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WOULD
[000:11:00;226] IF THE CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT.
[000:11:02;261] WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?
[000:11:02;862] >> WELL, I THINK ALL OF THIS
[000:11:04;096] RIGHT NOW IS REALLY CONFUSION
[000:11:05;431] ON EVERYONE'S PART.
[000:11:08;100] YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION
[000:11:09;502] RIGHT NOW CONSUMED BY THE
[000:11:10;836] COMEY CRISIS.
[000:11:12;138] THE NORTH KOREAN'S SEE THAT,
[000:11:15;141] AND I THINK THAT THEY BELIEVE
[000:11:16;008] THAT THEY CAN GIVE PRESIDENT
[000:11:17;977] TRUMP AN OUT TO SORT OF GIVE
[000:11:18;778] HIM HEADLINES THAT HE WOULD
[000:11:19;679] PREFER TO HAVE.
[000:11:20;613] NOW, I THINK THE
[000:11:22;214] NORTH KOREAN'S ARE TIMING THIS
[000:11:22;915] WRONG.
[000:11:23;582] BUT NONETHELESS, THAT'S THE
[000:11:24;250] WAY THEY THINK.
[000:11:25;718] THEY THINK IN WAYS WHICH ARE
[000:11:27;420] VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE WAYS
[000:11:29;622] WE DO, AND SO I THINK
[000:11:30;556] SOMETIMES THEY GET THEMSELVES
[000:11:31;257] INTO TROUBLE.
[000:11:32;558] BUT NONETHELESS, IN THEIR WAY
[000:11:33;459] OF THINKING, THEY BELIEVE THIS
[000:11:34;760] IS A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW TO
[000:11:37;196] PUT THE U.S. ON THE BACK FEET.
[000:11:38;364] JULIE: YOU HAVE SAID TO ME IN
[000:11:39;532] THE PAST THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:11:40;833] HAS TRIED TO COAX THE CHINESE
[000:11:42;134] TO HELP ON NORTH KOREA.
[000:11:43;536] TRIED TO FLATTER THE CHINESE,
[000:11:48;374] PRESIDENT PING, AND HE'S
[000:11:52;078] IGNORED BLATANT CHINESE
[000:11:52;678] SUPPORT.
[000:11:54;080] WHAT DO WE DO WITH CHINA?
[000:11:55;581] WHAT MESSAGE DO WE SEND TO
[000:11:56;215] THEM?
[000:11:57;950] AND WAS OUR MESSAGE THAT WE
[000:11:59;218] SENT TO SYRIA STRONG ENOUGH TO
[000:12:00;386] SEND A MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA
[000:12:02;021] THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS?
[000:12:02;655] >> YEAH.  I THINK PRESIDENT
[000:12:03;756] TRUMP NEEDS TO GIVE THE
[000:12:04;623] CHINESE A DEADLINE.
[000:12:07;693] AS YOU POINT OUT, THEY
[000:12:09;195] FLATTERED THE CHINESE RULER
[000:12:13;866] AND ALSO HAS FLATTERED
[000:12:16;235] KIM JONG-UN LAST WEEK SAYING
[000:12:18;037] THAT KIM IS A SMART COOKIE,
[000:12:19;205] THAT TRUMP WOULD BE HONORED TO
[000:12:20;005] TALK TO THE NORTH KOREAN
[000:12:20;606] LEADER.
[000:12:22;975] SO CLEARLY, THIS IS AN ATTEMPT
[000:12:24;110] I THINK TO AT LEAST ESTABLISH
[000:12:25;478] A DIALOGUE PATH.
[000:12:26;345] BUT, YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:12:27;580] HAS SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT IF
[000:12:29;281] THE CHINESE DON'T HELP THAT IF
[000:12:30;316] THE NORTH KOREAN'S DON'T
[000:12:31;217] DISARM, THAT HE WILL DO THIS
[000:12:32;518] ON HIS OWN AND THAT THE UNITED
[000:12:34;220] STATES HAS THE ABILITY TO DO
[000:12:34;887] THAT.
[000:12:36;522] THAT'S A THREAT, OF COURSE,
[000:12:38;257] AND THAT'S HANGING OVER THE
[000:12:39;024] HEADS OF THE NORTH KOREAN'S
[000:12:41;794] WHO OBVIOUSLY WANT TO PREVENT
[000:12:43;095] THAT EVENTUALITY.
[000:12:43;863] SO I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO
[000:12:45;564] SEE RIGHT NOW IF THEY CAN
[000:12:46;198] ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND TALK.
[000:12:47;800] YOU KNOW, THE CHINESE HAVE
[000:12:49;635] ALWAYS WANTED TO TALK.
[000:12:51;403] NOW THE SOUTH KOREANS WANT TO
[000:12:53;172] TALK.
[000:12:53;906] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS OPEN TO THE
[000:12:55;241] IDEA OF TALKING.
[000:12:56;742] SO IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT FOR
[000:12:57;443] NEGOTIATIONS.
[000:12:59;378] I THINK NEGOTIATIONS ARE
[000:12:59;979] PREMATURE.
[000:13:01;881] YOU WON'T TALK TO THE
[000:13:02;782] NORTH KOREANS UNTIL THEY KNOW
[000:13:03;482] THEY'RE DEFEATED.
[000:13:05;718] WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM THAT.
[000:13:06;552] JULIE: IT'S INTERESTING YOU
[000:13:07;219] MENTION SOUTH KOREA WITH THE
[000:13:08;621] FIRST LIBERAL PRESIDENT TO BE
[000:13:09;688] ELECTED RECENTLY AND THAT
[000:13:11;023] PRESIDENT WANTING TO TALK TO
[000:13:12;124] NORTH KOREA, WE HAVEN'T SEEN
[000:13:12;792] THAT.
[000:13:13;459] SO YOU HAVE THESE THREE
[000:13:15;628] NATIONS, POTENTIALLY, IN FOR
[000:13:16;295] TALKS.
[000:13:17;096] OF COURSE, THAT WILL TAKE A
[000:13:19;365] LOT OF TIME AND NOT HAVING TO
[000:13:20;699] SEE THESE SORT OF BLATANT
[000:13:24;103] DISRESPECT SLAP IN THE FACE TO
[000:13:25;437] THE WEST EACH TIME TEST FIRES
[000:13:27;706] A MISSILE.

[000:13:30;776] AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE
[000:13:32;144] NEXT TIME.
[000:13:34;079] NOT TO A LAUNCH BUT TO OUR
[000:13:36;515] INTERVIEW.
[000:13:36;949] >> THANK YOU.

[000:17:11;597] THEY SAY IT HAPPENED FRIDAY
[000:17:13;966] MORNING ABOUT 30 MILES FROM
[000:17:14;767] THE RUSSIAN BORDER OVER THE
[000:17:15;501] BLACK SEA.

[000:17:48;567] WAS ONE OF THE VERY HARDEST

[000:18:35;781] UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK, JULIE,
[000:18:38;083] UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER
[000:18:38;717] SEEN.
[000:18:39;918] IT IS THE LARGEST ATTACK OF
[000:18:42;121] THIS TYPE AND HACKERS USED
[000:18:43;122] MESSAGES THAT WERE FIRST
[000:18:44;022] DEPLOYED BY THE NATIONAL
[000:18:45;724] SECURITY AGENCY IN SECRET BUT
[000:18:47;226] OF COURSE THESE MESSAGES WERE

[000:30:44;809] Needles.
[000:30:46;044] Fine for some.
[000:30:47;178] But for you, one pill a day may
[000:30:47;178] provide symptom relief.

[000:32:16;968] TRUMP.
[000:32:17;969] THEY SAT DOWN AT THE WHITE

[000:32:24;208] MINUTES HERE ONLY ON THE FOX

[000:32:30;648] A NEW FBI DIRECTOR, AND THE
[000:32:31;316] PRESIDENT'S FRUSTRATIONS WITH
[000:32:32;850] THE NEWS MEDIA.
[000:32:37;355] LISTEN.
[000:32:38;556] >> YOUR AGENDA IS NOT GETTING
[000:32:39;290] OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CAUGHT
[000:32:42;093] UP ON THE COMEY ISSUE AND
[000:32:42;727] RIDICULOUS --
[000:32:43;227] TRUMP: I AGREE.
[000:32:43;695] I AGREE.
[000:32:45;396] >> HOW DO YOU GET RID OF
[000:32:46;597] COMEY --
[000:32:47;065] TRUMP: I THINK.
[000:32:47;899] >> WHO IN THE PRESS OFFICE
[000:32:49;000] SAYS ONE THING, THE VICE
[000:32:50;435] PRESIDENT SAYS ANOTHER THING.
[000:32:52;236] HOW DO WE RESOLVE THAT?
[000:32:52;904] TRUMP: WELL, THAT'S AN
[000:32:53;638] INTERESTING SITUATION.
[000:32:56;307] I ACTUALLY SAID TODAY, LET'S
[000:32:57;575] NOT DO ANY MORE PRESS
[000:32:58;810] BRIEFINGS.  YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
[000:32:59;711] GETTING TREMENDOUS RATINGS AND
[000:33:01;012] ESPECIALLY THE FAKE MEDIA.
[000:33:02;113] THEY'RE GOING CRAZY.
[000:33:02;947] THEY ARE GOING CRAZY.
[000:33:04;615] AND THEY'LL BE IN THE ROOM,
[000:33:05;750] AND YOU HAVE TO SEE THE WAY
[000:33:07;485] THEY ASK QUESTIONS, I WANT.
[000:33:08;152] I WANT.
[000:33:10;488] SCREAMING AND THERE'S NEVER
[000:33:13;191] BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
[000:33:19;230] IN ALL FAIRNESS TO SEAN AND
[000:33:21;232] SARAH HUCKABEE AND ANYBODY WHO
[000:33:22;333] STOOD UP THERE.
[000:33:23;568] THEY DON'T KNOW ME.
[000:33:24;635] I'M A VERY ACTIVE PRESIDENT.
[000:33:26;971] I'M DEALING WITH CHINA.  I'M
[000:33:27;772] DEALING WITH JAPAN.
[000:33:28;773] I'M DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA.
[000:33:29;907] I'M DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE
[000:33:30;608] DIFFERENT THINGS.
[000:33:32;076] RUSSIA CAME TO SEE ME, THE
[000:33:32;977] FOREIGN MINISTER THE OTHER DAY
[000:33:34;012] AND RIGHT AFTER THAT, THEY
[000:33:35;313] DIDN'T SAY THIS BUT RIGHT
[000:33:36;514] AFTER THAT, THE FOREIGN
[000:33:37;548] MINISTER FROM UKRAINE CAME
[000:33:38;182] IN.
[000:33:39;650] I SAID FELLAS, YOU'VE GOT TO
[000:33:40;351] MAKE PEACE.
[000:33:41;586] YOU'VE GOT TO GET PEACE.
[000:33:42;553] THEY ONLY TALKED ABOUT RUSSIA
[000:33:44;022] COMING IN.  OKAY?  AND WE TOOK
[000:33:45;289] PICTURES, THEY TOOK PICTURES.
[000:33:46;491] WE RELEASED THE PICTURES.
[000:33:48;292] THEY MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT
[000:33:48;926] IT.
[000:33:49;927] EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS COMING,
[000:33:51;396] AND HE WAS SCHEDULED TO COME.
[000:33:52;730] BUT THEY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT
[000:33:53;364] UKRAINE.
[000:33:54;665] THE POINT IS THIS:  WHEN WE
[000:33:56;134] HAVE THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES,
[000:33:57;902] I ACTUALLY SAY WE SHOULDN'T
[000:33:59;470] HAVE THEM BECAUSE SARAH
[000:34:00;071] HUCKABEE.
[000:34:00;938] >> 100 YEARS WE'VE BEEN
[000:34:01;539] DOING.
[000:34:01;939] TRUMP: NO.  NO.
[000:34:02;874] BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ACTION
[000:34:03;574] LIKE THIS.
[000:34:04;008] THIS IS CRAZY.
[000:34:06;310] I MEAN, WE'RE GETTING HIGHER
[000:34:07;245] RATINGS -- THEY'RE GETTING
[000:34:09;113] HIRE RATINGS ON THOSE PRESS
[000:34:09;781] CONFERENCES --
[000:34:10;381] >> WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY
[000:34:11;949] CONSIDER STOPPING THESE PRESS
[000:34:12;650] SESSIONS?
[000:34:13;084] TRUMP: NO, WE DO IT IN A
[000:34:14;752] DIFFERENT WAY.
[000:34:15;253] >> HOW?
[000:34:16;621] TRUMP: WE DO IT THROUGH A
[000:34:17;455] PIECE OF PAPER WITH A
[000:34:18;689] PERFECTLY, ACCURATE, BEAUTIFUL
[000:34:19;390] ANSWER.
[000:34:20;391] I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER.
[000:34:21;859] >> IN WRITING?
[000:34:23;061] TRUMP: THEY ASK 100 QUESTIONS
[000:34:24;695] OR 50 QUESTIONS OR 20
[000:34:25;263] QUESTIONS.
[000:34:27;632] IF THEY GET ONE OUT OF 50,
[000:34:30;802] JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF, 5%,
[000:34:32;770] 10%, 20%, IT'S THE NEXT DAY
[000:34:34;672] IT'S A FRONT-PAGE STORY IN
[000:34:36;174] EVERY NEWSPAPER.
[000:34:37;341] >> RIGHT.
[000:34:37;708] SO?
[000:34:38;543] TRUMP: PRESS CONFERENCES
[000:34:39;510] WEREN'T EVEN COVERED FOR
[000:34:40;211] OBAMA, PRACTICAL.
[000:34:42;213] THEY WERE ON C-SPAN AND
[000:34:43;948] C-SPAN2 AND, YOU KNOW, THERE
[000:34:45;349] WAS NOTHING GOING ON.
[000:34:47;518] >> BUT WILL YOU PUT AN END TO
[000:34:48;219] THEM?
[000:34:48;619] TRUMP: THESE PRESS CONFERENCES
[000:34:49;387] ARE, LIKE, THE BIGGEST THING
[000:34:51;289] ON DAYTIME TELEVISION.
[000:34:51;923] >> THEY ARE.
[000:34:52;824] TRUMP: OKAY?  YOU SEE THE
[000:34:53;458] RATINGS.
[000:34:54;092] THEY'RE BLOWING AWAY
[000:34:55;626] EVERYTHING ON JUST ABOUT I
[000:34:57;395] THINK EVERYTHING ON DAYTIME
[000:34:58;062] TELEVISION.
[000:34:59;430] WHAT I LOVE TO DO IS STOP
[000:35:00;064] THEM.
[000:35:01;365] IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE PEOPLE.
[000:35:03;267] I'LL GIVE YOU -- LOOK, I AM A
[000:35:07;972] VERY ACTIVE PERSON.
[000:35:10;108] I HAVE A LOT OF VERY POSITIVE
[000:35:11;175] THINGS GOING ON RIGHT UP HERE
[000:35:12;610] FOR THIS COUNTRY.
[000:35:14;412] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON
[000:35:16;114] OR TWO PEOPLE OR THREE PEOPLE
[000:35:18;850] WHO ARE PRESS PEOPLE TO COVER
[000:35:19;984] EVERY ASPECT OF WHAT I'M
[000:35:22;553] THINKING AND WHAT I'M DOING.
[000:35:23;955] AND I THINK IT'S UNFAIR.
[000:35:25;523] AND IF THEY GET JUST A LITTLE
[000:35:26;791] BIT WRONG, THEY DON'T MEAN TO,
[000:35:29;794] THEY'RE LIARS.
[000:35:31;195] THEY'RE HORRIBLE PEOPLE.
[000:35:32;530] THEY'RE LIARS, THE PRESS
[000:35:33;131] GOES.
[000:35:34;832] AND IT BECOMES A BIG STORY FOR
[000:35:35;533] TWO OR THREE DAYS.
[000:35:36;801] AND IT'S VERY, VERY UNFAIR TO
[000:35:37;869] A PERSON IN THAT JOB.
[000:35:39;103] I THINK THAT'S REALLY A TOUGH
[000:35:40;071] JOB, TO BE HONEST.
[000:35:41;272] ESPECIALLY FOR ME BECAUSE I'M
[000:35:42;373] HAVING MEETING AFTER MEETING.
[000:35:44;308] I'M CUTTING THE PRICE OF THE
[000:35:46;511] AIRPLANES WITH LOCKHEED.
[000:35:47;612] I'M CUTTING THE PRICE OF
[000:35:48;513] AIRPLANES WITH BOEING.
[000:35:50;114] I'M DOING ALL OF THESE
[000:35:51;015] THINGS.
[000:35:53;050] I'M MAKING DEALS WITH CHINA.
[000:35:55;887] I'M TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM
[000:35:57;188] IN NORTH KOREA, WHICH IS A
[000:35:59;290] REALLY BIG PROBLEM.
[000:36:00;958] >> ARE YOU MOVING SO QUICKLY
[000:36:01;626] THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS
[000:36:03;027] DEPARTMENT CANNOT KEEP UP WITH
[000:36:03;728] YOU?
[000:36:04;061] TRUMP: YES.
[000:36:04;462] THAT'S TRUE.
[000:36:06;998] >> SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT
[000:36:07;632] THAT?
[000:36:09;033] TRUMP: WE DON'T HAVE PRESS
[000:36:10;835] CONFERENCES, AND WE DO.
[000:36:11;836] >> YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
[000:36:12;970] TRUMP: WELL, JUST DON'T HAVE
[000:36:14;071] THEM UNLESS I HAVE THEM EVERY
[000:36:15;273] TWO WEEKS, AND I DO THEM
[000:36:15;873] MYSELF.
[000:36:16;207] WE DON'T HAVE THEM.
[000:36:17;508] I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
[000:36:18;609] FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE A LEVEL
[000:36:19;710] OF HOSTILITY THAT'S
[000:36:21;412] INCREDIBLE, AND IT'S VERY
[000:36:22;046] UNFAIR.
[000:36:24;215] SARAH HUCKABEE IS A LOVELY
[000:36:25;750] YOUNG WOMAN.
[000:36:27;552] YOU KNOW SEAN SPICER.
[000:36:28;953] HE IS A LOVELY HUMAN BEING.
[000:36:29;754] HE'S A NICE MAN.
[000:36:31;222] >> IS HE YOUR PRESS SECRETARY
[000:36:32;657] TODAY AND TOMORROW?
[000:36:33;257] TRUMP: YEAH, HE IS.
[000:36:34;992] >> WILL HE BE HERE TOMORROW?
[000:36:37;195] TRUMP: WELL, HE'S DOING A GOOD
[000:36:38;396] JOB, BUT HE'S GETTING BEAT
[000:36:39;030] UP.
[000:36:40;097] >> WILL HE BE THERE TOMORROW?
[000:36:41;299] TRUMP: HE'S BEEN THERE FROM
[000:36:42;867] THE BEGINNING.
[000:36:44;302] >> IS HE --
[000:36:45;536] TRUMP: HE JUST GETS BEAT UP BY
[000:36:47;471] THESE PEOPLE.
[000:36:49;740] JULIE: REMEMBER TO WATCH JUDGE
[000:36:50;441] JENIN'S INTERVIEW WITH
[000:36:51;576] PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT HERE ON
[000:36:52;310] FOX NEWS CHANNEL TONIGHT AT
[000:36:53;711] 9:00 P.M. EASTERN.
[000:36:54;512] I HAVE A FEELING IT WILL BE A
[000:36:55;846] LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN MOST
[000:36:56;747] INTERVIEWS YOU'VE SEEN HIM
[000:36:57;381] DO.
[000:36:57;648] PRETTY ENTERTAINING.
[000:36:58;749] THAT WAS GOOD STUFF.
[000:37:00;151] THANK YOU.  WELL, PRESIDENT
[000:37:01;285] TRUMP GIVING HIS FIRST
[000:37:02;486] COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AS
[000:37:04;222] PRESIDENT IN FRONT OF A RECORD
[000:37:08;192] CROWD.
[000:37:09;627] IN FRONT OF ABOUT 50,000
[000:37:11;128] PEOPLE TELLING GRADUATES NEVER
[000:37:12;530] GIVE UP TO THEIR DREAMS AND TO
[000:37:13;965] CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO.
[000:37:16;067] KEVIN HAS MORE FROM LYNCHBURG,
[000:37:20;605] VIRGINIA.
[000:37:23;541] >> JULIE, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU
[000:37:25;142] HERE IN THE PICTURESQUE
[000:37:27;478] PENNSYLVANIA.
[000:37:29;447] THE PRESIDENT'S VERY FIRST
[000:37:30;448] COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS AS
[000:37:31;048] COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[000:37:32;350] IT'S ACTUALLY, BY THE WAY, HIS
[000:37:33;451] THIRD VISIT HERE TO THIS
[000:37:34;051] CAMPUS.
[000:37:35;586] YOU MAY RECALL HE WAS HERE NOT
[000:37:38;422] THAT MANY MONTHS AGO AS A
[000:37:39;290] CANDIDATE FOR THE HIGHEST
[000:37:40;091] OFFICE IN THE LAND.
[000:37:43;327] AND TODAY, HE DREW FROM THAT
[000:37:44;328] PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO
[000:37:45;863] ENCOURAGE THE STUDENTS TO BE
[000:37:46;964] THEMSELVES, TO BE BOLD.
[000:37:47;832] DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS
[000:37:49;166] AND THE NAYSAYERS, ESPECIALLY
[000:37:51;769] NOW AS THEY LOOK FORWARD TO
[000:37:53;304] WRITING THEIR OWN NARRATIVE AS
[000:37:54;605] YOUNG ADULTS.
[000:37:57;808] >> NOTHING IS EASIER OR MORE
[000:38:00;011] PATHETIC THAN BEING A CRITIC.
[000:38:03;748] BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
[000:38:05;683] CAN'T GET THE JOB DONE.
[000:38:08;853] BUT THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THE
[000:38:09;553] DREAMERS.
[000:38:11;088] NOT TO THE CRITICS.
[000:38:13;090] >> WE MENTION THE OVERWHELMING
[000:38:14;158] SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED
[000:38:15;426] HERE AMONG THE CROWD.
[000:38:17;728] ABOUT 50,000 PEOPLE IN ALL IN
[000:38:19;563] THE STADIUM AND AROUND IT
[000:38:20;765] TAKING IN THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:38:21;966] REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:38:23;668] HE ALSO TOLD THE STUDENTS
[000:38:24;769] HERE, AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS
[000:38:25;803] AN IMPORTANT NOTE.
[000:38:27;772] DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE THE
[000:38:29;540] OUTSIDER BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL
[000:38:31;008] ALWAYS TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN'T
[000:38:31;709] DO.
[000:38:33;944] BUT DON'T LET THAT SLOW YOU
[000:38:34;612] DOWN.
[000:38:36;314] >> CARRY YOURSELF WITH DIGNITY
[000:38:37;014] AND PRIDE.
[000:38:38;349] DEMAND THE BEST FROM YOURSELF
[000:38:40;618] AND BE TOTALLY UNAFRAID TO
[000:38:45;323] CHALLENGE ENTRENCHED INTEREST
[000:38:46;757] IN FAILED POWER STRUCTURES.
[000:38:48;025] DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR, BY
[000:38:49;427] THE WAY?
[000:38:52;363] THE MORE PEOPLE TELL YOU IT'S
[000:38:54;665] NOT POSSIBLE, THAT IT CAN'T BE
[000:38:57;268] DONE, THE MORE YOU SHOULD BE
[000:38:58;402] ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO PROVE
[000:38:59;270] THEM WRONG.
[000:39:01;272] >> AMONG THE SHOUTOUTS, THE
[000:39:02;506] PRESIDENT OFFERED TODAY, HE
[000:39:03;441] THANKED VETERANS FOR THEIR
[000:39:04;075] SUPPORT.
[000:39:05;009] AND, BY THE WAY, THERE WERE
[000:39:06;210] THOUSANDS OF THEM GRADUATING
[000:39:07;011] TODAY HERE AS WELL.
[000:39:08;546] HE ALSO SAID, HEY, DON'T
[000:39:09;146] FORGET.
[000:39:09;914] IT'S SUNDAY COMING UP.
[000:39:10;781] THAT'S MOTHER'S DAY.
[000:39:11;882] THANK YOU TO THE MOMS FOR
[000:39:13;250] BEING SO SUPPORTIVE AND
[000:39:14;618] GETTING THOSE STUDENTS TO THIS
[000:39:15;319] POINT.
[000:39:17;822] BUT IN PARTICULAR, THERE WAS A
[000:39:18;522] HEARTFELT CONGRATULATIONS TO
[000:39:19;523] JIM KELLY.
[000:39:20;758] YOU MAY REMEMBER HE WAS A
[000:39:22;059] QUARTERBACK OF THE BUFFALO
[000:39:22;693] BILLS.
[000:39:23;427] OH, THOSE MANY YEARS AGO
[000:39:24;795] MAKING IT TO SUPER BOWL AFTER
[000:39:25;996] SUPER BOWL.
[000:39:27;565] HE'S BEATEN CANCER TWICE.
[000:39:28;599] HIS DAUGHTER AMONG THE
[000:39:29;867] GRADUATING CLASS OF 2017.
[000:39:33;504] A DAY SHE WON'T SOON FORGET,
[000:39:34;171] AND I THINK THAT WILL
[000:39:35;106] CERTAINLY BE THE CASE FOR THE
[000:39:36;507] MANY THOUSANDS WHO WERE HERE
[000:39:37;908] IN ATTENDANCE.
[000:39:39;243] JULIE.
[000:39:41;045] JULIE: KEVIN, THANK YOU VERY
[000:39:41;846] MUCH.  WELL, FEDERAL
[000:39:43;080] PROSECUTORS ARE NOW UNDER
[000:39:45;282] ORDERS TO GO AFTER THE MOST
[000:39:47;218] SERIOUS CHARGES POSSIBLE FOR
[000:39:48;886] MOST ACCUSED CRIMINALS.
[000:39:50;321] NOW, THE MOVE REVERSES SOME
[000:39:51;522] POLICIES FROM THE OBAMA
[000:39:52;423] ADMINISTRATION, WHICH WERE
[000:39:54;458] MEANT TO FIGHT PRISON
[000:39:55;025] OVERCROWDING.
[000:39:56;360] EXPERTS SAY IT WILL LIKELY PUT
[000:39:58;028] MORE PEOPLE BEHIND BARS FOR
[000:39:58;696] LONGER.
[000:39:59;997] ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS
[000:40:01;298] PROMISED TO MAKE CRACKING DOWN
[000:40:02;967] ON DRUGS AND VIOLENCE A TOP
[000:40:04;201] PRIORITY AT THE JUSTICE
[000:40:04;802] DEPARTMENT.
[000:40:07;037] HE SAYS THE NEW POLICY WILL
[000:40:08;305] PRODUCE MORE QUOTE CONSISTENCY
[000:40:11;442] IN SENTENCING.
[000:40:12;843] BUT CRITICS SAY LOWER LEVEL
[000:40:14;979] CRIMINALS WILL INSTEAD NOW
[000:40:16;881] FACE UNFAIR MANDATORY MINIMUM
[000:40:18;549] SENTENCES.
[000:40:19;984] PETER DUCEY HAS MORE.
[000:40:24;088] >> YOU DRUG DEALERS ARE GOING
[000:40:24;789] TO PRISON.
[000:40:25;689] >> AND WITH THAT, A TRUMP
[000:40:26;724] CAMPAIGN PROMISE OF LAW AND
[000:40:28;125] ORDER BECAME AN INSTRUCTION
[000:40:29;160] FOR AMERICA'S LAW
[000:40:29;660] ENFORCEMENT.
[000:40:31;362] A TWO-PAGE MEMO FROM THE
[000:40:33;364] ATTORNEY GENERAL TO U.S.
[000:40:34;799] ATTORNEYS WARNS CRIMINALS.
[000:40:36;000] PROSECUTORS WILL NOW ALMOST
[000:40:37;902] ALWAYS PURSUE CHARGES WITH THE
[000:40:40;104] LONGEST POSSIBLE SENTENCES.
[000:40:41;539] AND IT'S MANDATORY MINIMUM
[000:40:43;040] SENTENCES WILL EVEN APPLY TO
[000:40:44;942] DRUG OFFENSES WITH WHICH THE
[000:40:45;843] LAST ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO
[000:40:48;245] BE LEANT AND CONSIDERED
[000:40:48;846] NONVIOLENT.
[000:40:50;648] >> WE'RE RETURNING TO THE
[000:40:52;316] ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW AS
[000:40:53;984] PASSED BY CONGRESS, PLANE AND
[000:40:54;685] SIMPLE.
[000:40:56;787] IF YOU ARE A DRUG TRAFFICKER,
[000:40:58;556] WE WILL NOT LOOK THE OTHER
[000:40:59;190] WAY.
[000:41:01;525] >> THAT'S A MAJOR CHANGE FROM
[000:41:02;226] A OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
[000:41:04;061] APPROACH DESIGNED TO REDUCE
[000:41:06;197] PRISON POPULATIONS.
[000:41:09;033] >> A PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS
[000:41:13;103] MASS INCARCERATION PHENOMENON
[000:41:15;239] IS -- OUR DRUG LAWS ARE
[000:41:16;040] MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING
[000:41:16;941] AROUND DRUG LAWS.
[000:41:18;809] >> ONE OF OBAMA'S ATTORNEY
[000:41:20;544] GENERALS ERIC HOLDER NOW SAYS
[000:41:22;780] QUOTE THE POLICY ANNOUNCED
[000:41:24;682] TODAY IS NOT TOUGH ON CRIME,
[000:41:26;283] IT IS DUMB ON CRIME.
[000:41:27;251] BUT THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE SAYS
[000:41:28;285] THE CHANGE WAS CAREFULLY
[000:41:28;886] CRAFTED.
[000:41:30;287] >> THIS POLICY WAS FORMULATED
[000:41:30;988] AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION
[000:41:32;323] WITH THE PROSECUTORS THAT
[000:41:33;491] HANDLE THESE CASES EACH AND
[000:41:36;160] EVERY DAY AROUND THE COUNTRY.
[000:41:37;728] >> PRISON REFORM ADVOCATES ARE
[000:41:39;430] ALARMED BY THE PROSPECT OF A
[000:41:40;698] RETURN TO THE WAR ON DRUGS.
[000:41:42;867] >> THE PROBLEM WITH THE WAR ON
[000:41:44;635] DRUGS WAS THAT IT SWEPT UP NOT
[000:41:46;303] JUST PEOPLE ENGAGED IN HIGH
[000:41:47;404] LEVEL DRUG OFFENDING BUT LOTS
[000:41:48;839] OF PEOPLE IN THE LOWER LEVELS
[000:41:50;341] OF THE DRUG TRADE.
[000:41:52;476] THAT HAD VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON
[000:41:53;844] DRUG USE AND ABUSE.
[000:41:55;746] >> ON CAPITOL HILL, DEMOCRATS
[000:41:57;581] AND AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN
[000:41:58;682] ARE SCOFFING AT THIS NEW
[000:41:59;383] POLICY TOO.
[000:42:01;619] SENATOR RAND PAUL SAYS QUOTE
[000:42:03;521] MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES
[000:42:05;823] HAVE UNFAIRLY AND
[000:42:09;460] DISPROPORTIONALLY INCARCERATED
[000:42:12;062] TOO MANY MINORITIES FOR TOO
[000:42:13;497] LONG.
[000:42:14;999] A FORMER FEDERAL DRUG SEES
[000:42:19;103] THINGS DIFFERENTLY.
[000:42:19;970] >> WHEN THEY SAY A HOLDER IN
[000:42:21;505] THE CROWD AND PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:42:23;040] SAY GO EASY ON THIS STUFF,
[000:42:23;974] THEY WANT YOU TO THINK WHAT
[000:42:24;942] THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOME
[000:42:26;944] GUY SITTING IN HIS ROOM TOKING
[000:42:27;745] UP ON A JOINT.
[000:42:29;780] THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF CASES
[000:42:31;282] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
[000:42:33;584] THEY DIDN'T PROSECUTE MAJOR
[000:42:34;685] DRUG DEALING CASES.
[000:42:36;220] AND THIS HAS CREATED MORE OF A
[000:42:36;921] PROBLEM.
[000:42:37;354] >> I WAS WITH THE ATTORNEY
[000:42:38;622] GENERAL IN WEST VIRGINIA
[000:42:39;857] YESTERDAY WHEN HE ANNOUNCED A
[000:42:41;125] MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO
[000:42:42;259] ROUNDING UP DRUG DEALERS.
[000:42:43;427] AND NOW HE'S SAYING WHAT HE
[000:42:45;796] WANTS TO DO ONCE THEY ARE IN
[000:42:46;463] CUSTODY.
[000:42:47;865] SESSIONS IS NOT PROPOSING ANY
[000:42:49;199] NEW LAWS, JUST SAYING THAT
[000:42:50;501] THIS DEPARTMENT WILL NO LONGER
[000:42:52;836] PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH ONES TO
[000:42:54;638] ENFORCE.
[000:42:55;039] >> .
[000:42:55;773] JULIE: PETER DUCEY, THANK YOU
[000:42:56;473] VERY MUCH.
[000:42:57;408] REPORTING FROM WASHINGTON.
[000:42:59;543] NEW DETAILS JUST IN ABOUT
[000:43:01;245] NORTH KOREA'S LATEST MISSILE
[000:43:02;846] LAUNCH COMING IN FROM U.S.
[000:43:03;881] PACIFIC COMMAND.
[000:43:05;683] WE WILL HAVE THE VERY LATEST
[000:43:08;185] ON THIS BREAKING NEWS STORY
[000:43:08;986] COMING UP RIGHT AFTER THIS
[000:43:09;620] BREAK.
[000:43:09;920] STAY WITH US
[000:43:09;920] Thank you!
[000:43:12;890] Imagine if the things you
[000:43:12;890] bought every day
[000:43:15;526] earned you miles to
[000:43:15;526] get to the places
[000:43:17;194] you really want to go.
[000:43:18;729] With the United MileagePlus
[000:43:18;729] Explorer Card,
[000:43:21;198] you'll get a free checked bag,
[000:43:23;567] 2 United Club passes...
[000:43:26;236] Priority boarding...
[000:43:28;305] and 50,000 bonus miles.
[000:43:30;975] Everything you need
[000:43:32;576] for an unforgettable vacation.
[000:43:34;745] The United MileagePlus
[000:43:34;745] Explorer Card.
[000:43:36;914] Imagine where it will take you.
[000:43:41;619] But with my back pain I couldn't
[000:43:41;619] sleep or get up in time.
[000:43:44;088] Then I found Aleve PM.
[000:43:45;956] The only one to combine
[000:43:45;956] a safe sleep aid
[000:43:47;958] plus the 12 hour pain
[000:43:47;958] relieving strength of Aleve.
[000:43:50;194] And now. I'm back!
[000:43:52;062] Aleve PM for a better AM.
[000:43:59;503] Whether it's connecting one of
[000:43:59;503] Or bringing WiFi to 65,000 fans.
[000:43:59;503] campuses.
[000:44:02;673] Businesses count on
[000:44:02;673] communication, and communication
[000:44:02;673] counts on CenturyLink.
[000:44:11;181] gave us the power to turn this
[000:44:12;783] enemy into an ally?
[000:44:14;818] Microsoft and its partners are
[000:44:16;320] using smart traps to capture
[000:44:18;389] mosquitoes and sequence their
[000:44:19;890] DNA to fight disease.
[000:44:22;292] There are over 100 million
[000:44:23;861] pieces of DNA in every sample.
[000:44:26;897] With the Microsoft Cloud,
[000:44:28;198] we can analyze the data
[000:44:29;800] faster than ever before.
[000:44:31;902] If we can detect new viruses
[000:44:33;470] before they spread,
[000:44:34;505] we may someday prevent outbreaks
[000:44:36;640] before they begin.
[000:46:27;317] .
[000:46:27;951] JULIE: THIS IS A FOX NEWS
[000:46:29;086] ALERT AND BREAKING NEWS WITH
[000:46:30;621] AN UPDATE ON THE LAUNCH OF A
[000:46:32;322] MISSILE BY NORTH KOREA.
[000:46:35;125] THE U.S. PACIFIC COMMAND
[000:46:37;027] SAYING IT DID DETECT AND TRACK
[000:46:39;296] THIS MISSILE THIS MORNING.
[000:46:40;063] LAUNCHED FROM THE WESTERN PART
[000:46:41;865] OF THE NATION AND LANDING IN
[000:46:43;200] THE SEA OF JAPAN.
[000:46:45;702] THE MILITARY SAYS IT IS
[000:46:48;038] SATISFYIN ASSESSING THE
[000:46:51;175] MISSILE LAUNCH, AND ITS FLIGHT
[000:46:52;876] WAS NOT CONSISTENT OF THAT OF
[000:46:54;044] A INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
[000:46:54;711] MISSILE.
[000:46:55;779] THE CENTER OF COMMAND SAYS IT
[000:46:57;181] IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH
[000:46:58;282] SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN TO
[000:46:58;982] MAINTAIN SECURITY.
[000:47:00;184] NOW, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOES
[000:47:02;619] SAY THE LAUNCH POSED NO THREAT
[000:47:04;021] TO NORTH AMERICA.
[000:47:06;924] THIS LATEST LAUNCH COMES AMID
[000:47:08;859] HEIGHTENED ATTENTION WITH THE
[000:47:10;661] U.S. AND KIM JONG-UN AFTER A
[000:47:12;262] SERIES OF FAILED LAUNCH
[000:47:13;664] ATTEMPTS THIS PAST MONTH.
[000:47:15;532] IN FACT, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S, IN
[000:47:16;466] ESSENCE, THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE
[000:47:17;801] ON THE TABLE, WE ARE WAITING
[000:47:22;806] FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO RELEASE
[000:47:23;707] A STATEMENT.
[000:47:24;541] WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE
[000:47:25;976] PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON
[000:47:28;178] THE SITUATION.
[000:47:31;081] THE POCKET HAS ALSO CONFIRMED
[000:47:31;882] ALL OF THIS.
[000:47:32;883] WHAT IT MEANS NEXT.
[000:47:34;017] WE SOON FIND OUT MORE AS WE
[000:47:34;718] GET IT.
[000:47:37;254] IN THE MEANTIME, ONE OF THE
[000:47:39;323] COUNTRY'S BUSIEST AIRPORTS IS
[000:47:40;691] GETTING A MAKEOVER.
[000:47:43;260] LAX IS SHUFFLING AROUND A
[000:47:45;162] THIRD OF ITS TERMINALS THIS
[000:47:45;829] WEEKEND.
[000:47:46;797] NOW PASSENGERS ARE EXPECTING
[000:47:49;600] POSSIBLE DELAYS.
[000:47:51;802] THIS SOUNDS LIKE A MESS IN THE
[000:47:52;703] WAITING.
[000:47:53;337] WILL.
[000:47:55;339] >> YEAH.  JULIE, THIS IS A
[000:47:56;373] MAJOR TRANSITION AT THE SECOND
[000:47:57;574] BUSIEST AIRPORT IN THE
[000:47:58;141] COUNTRY.
[000:47:59;776] IT OPERATES 24/7, SO THEY
[000:48:01;178] REALLY WANTED TO START THIS
[000:48:02;980] DURING THE DOWN HOURS
[000:48:04;181] OVERNIGHT, SO THEY STARTED THE
[000:48:05;315] MOVE JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT.
[000:48:07;017] THEY BROUGHT IN BIG BOXES AND
[000:48:08;218] MOVING TRUCKS AND OVER THE
[000:48:10;254] NEXT FIVE TO SIX DAYS, 21
[000:48:15;392] AIRLINES WILL BE OPEN FOR
[000:48:18;061] BUSINESS IN NEW TERMINALS, AND
[000:48:20;898] IF YOU'VE EVER THROWN INTO
[000:48:22;065] LAX, YOU KNOW IT CAN BE BUSY.
[000:48:24;501] THEY HAVE PUT IN A FULL COURT
[000:48:26;003] COMMUNICATIONS PRESS
[000:48:27;704] CONTACTING PASSENGERS VIA
[000:48:29;039] E-MAIL, TEMECULA, AND SOCIAL
[000:48:30;340] MEDIA, AND PASSENGERS TELL US
[000:48:31;742] IT'S WORKING.
[000:48:33;810] >> WELL, EVERYBODY WARNED US,
[000:48:35;679] AND THEY TEXT THE US EVEN THIS
[000:48:37;481] MORNING SAYING YOU SHOULD GET
[000:48:38;482] AHERE THREE OR FOUR HOURS IN
[000:48:39;816] ADVANCE, DEPENDING ON THE
[000:48:41;585] FLIGHT, SO WE EXPECTED IT TO
[000:48:42;819] BE THREE HOURS, AND IT REALLY
[000:48:43;520] WASN'T A PROBLEM.
[000:48:44;988] >> TO HELP, DELTA, WHICH IS
[000:48:47;057] FINANCING THE RELOCATION, HAS
[000:48:49;359] MORE THAN 200 STAFF MEMBERS ON
[000:48:51;795] THE PREMISES.
[000:48:53;096] THEY'RE ANSWERING QUESTIONS
[000:48:54;131] AND HELPING WITH ANY
[000:48:54;665] CONFUSION.
[000:48:55;699] SO FAR THERE ARE NO PLANE
[000:48:57;434] DELAYS, BUT EVERYONE IS STILL
[000:49:00;037] URGING PASSENGERS TO SHOW UP
[000:49:01;138] AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.
[000:49:02;205] >> WE ARE TRYING TO BE AS
[000:49:05;442] PROACTIVE AS WE CAN, WHETHER
[000:49:07;277] IT'S RADIO SPOTS WORKING WITH
[000:49:09;279] UBER AND LYFT, ALL SORTS OF
[000:49:10;080] WAYS TO COMMUNICATE.
[000:49:12;115] IS AND SO FAR, IT SEEMS TO BE
[000:49:12;816] WORKING.
[000:49:14;117] PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP IN THE
[000:49:15;619] RIGHT PLACE.
[000:49:17;487] >> AND THE REASON FOR THE
[000:49:18;622] RELOCATION IS THAT DELTA
[000:49:20;257] WANTED TO GET INTO TWO
[000:49:21;558] TERMINALS SET FOR EXPANSION IN
[000:49:23;760] THE COMING YEARS.
[000:49:25;662] IF THERE'S ANY INCONVENIENCE
[000:49:27;097] IN THE COMING DAYS, JULIE, IT
[000:49:33;003] WILL BE WELL WORTH IT.
[000:49:34;171] JULIE: WILL CARR, THANK YOU
[000:49:35;339] VERY MUCH.
[000:49:37;140] A WORLD WAR II VETERAN IS
[000:49:38;842] STILL LOOKING FOR A WAY TO
[000:49:40;177] GIVE BACK DECADES AFTER
[000:49:41;678] LEAVING THE BATTLEFIELD.
[000:49:43;180] HOW HE'S USING HIS RETIREMENT
[000:49:44;681] TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE
[000:49:45;816] LIVES OF OTHERS.
[000:49:47;217] PLUS PUTTING A TAX ON YOUR
[000:49:48;518] NETFLIX ACCOUNT.
[000:49:49;519] WHY SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE
[000:49:51;054] CONSIDERING A PLAN TO DO JUST
[000:49:53;056] THAT AS MORE CABLE SUBSCRIBERS
[000:49:55;359] CUT THE CORD.
[000:49:55;592] Dear Predictable,
[000:49:58;495] There's no other
[000:49:58;495] way to say this.
[000:50:00;664] It's over.
[000:50:01;898] I've found a permanent
[000:50:01;898] escape from monotony.
[000:50:05;569] Together, we are
[000:50:05;569] perfectly balanced,
[000:50:08;972] our senses awake,
[000:50:11;208] our hearts racing as one.
[000:50:14;177] I know this is sudden,
[000:50:16;079] but they say: If you
[000:50:16;079] love something...
[000:50:19;416] set it free.
[000:50:21;585] See you around, Giulia
