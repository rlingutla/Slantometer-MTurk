hard it can be to breathe

and man, you know
how that feels.

708

COPD includes emphysema
and chronic bronchitis.

SPIRIVA is a once-daily inhaled
COPD maintenance treatment

airways for a full 24 hours.

me breathe easier.

SPIRIVA HandiHaler Tiotropium
Bromide Inhalation Powder

713
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
does not replace fast-acting
inhalers for sudden symptoms.

714
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Tell your doctor if you
have kidney problems,

715
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
glaucoma, trouble urinating,
or an enlarged prostate.

716
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
These may worsen with SPIRIVA.

717
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Discuss all medicines you
take, even eye drops.

718
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Stop taking SPIRIVA and seek
immediate medical help

719
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
if your breathing
suddenly worsens,

720
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
your throat or tongue swells,
you get hives, vision changes

721
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
or eye pain, or problems
passing urine.

722
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Other side effects include
dry mouth and constipation.

723
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Nothing can reverse COPD.

724
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
SPIRIVA helps me
breathe better.

725
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Does breathing with
COPD weigh you down?

726
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Don't wait to ask your
doctor about SPIRIVA.

727
