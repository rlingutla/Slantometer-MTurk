[000:06:34;17] UP AND WATCH THEM MOVE INTO  
[000:06:36;00] YOUR TOWN.  
[000:06:36;21] WHEN YOU SEE THIS, IT RARELY  
[000:06:38;22] HITS THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE  
[000:06:40;19] TALL BUILDINGS AND SO MANY  
[000:06:42;17] STRUCTURES.

[000:37:04;01] PEOPLE THAT KNOW THIS, NORMAN  
[000:37:05;17] IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF  
[000:37:07;01] OKLAHOMA A UNIVERSITY OF MORE  
[000:37:08;04] THAN 30,000 STUDENTS AND THE

[000:37:12;16] FACT EVEN HAS AN OFFICE IN  
[000:37:14;00] NORMAN.  
[000:37:14;16] I SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE  
[000:37:15;24] THERE NOT VERY LONG AGO AND  
[000:37:16;27] THEY HE SAID THAT THEY WERE  
[000:37:17;27] STARTING TO SEE SOME CLIMATIC

[000:37:25;23] MENTIONED THAT IS ACTUALLY  
[000:37:28;05] SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY  
[000:37:29;17] BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT THESE TWO  
[000:37:31;28] MAJOR CELLS IF YOU LOOK AT THE  
[000:37:33;12] RADAR THAT ARE SPAWNING THE  
[000:37:36;16] TORNADOES.  
[000:37:37;09] NORTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY AND  
[000:37:39;09] THEN SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA  
[000:37:40;15] CITY.  
[000:37:41;01] AND RIGHT NOW ALL EYES ARE ON  
[000:37:43;19] THE AREA AS JANICE DEAN WAS  
[000:37:45;28] SAYING PINK, OKLAHOMA, THAT IS  
[000:37:48;02] SOUTHEAST OF NORMAN.  
[000:37:49;08] SO WE HAVE THESE TWO GUIDANCE  
[000:37:51;18] TICK CELLS.  
[000:37:52;05] IN FACT SOME OF THE EARLY  
[000:37:53;13] REPORTS FROM THE WEATHER  
[000:37:54;23] SPOTTERS ON THE GROUND IS THAT  
[000:37:56;04] IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA ALONE  
[000:37:58;29] 14 DIFFERENT TORNADOES HAVE  
[000:38:00;13] BEEN GENERATED IN THE LAST FOUR  
[000:38:02;18] HOURS OR SO.  
[000:38:03;24] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT  
[000:38:04;20] FORECASTERS HAD TALKED ABOUT  
[000:38:05;26] FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  
[000:38:06;28] I CAN TELL YOU WE WERE DOWN IN  
[000:38:11;01] NORTH TEXAS ON THE GROUND LAST  
[000:38:12;04] WEEK RIGHT AFTER THOSE STORMS

[000:38:23;01] EVER SINCE THE SYSTEM MOVE  
[000:38:23;25] THROUGH IT HAS BEEN AN EERY  
[000:38:31;16] HUMID UNNATURAL FEELING THE  
[000:38:32;21] LAST FEW DAYS.  
[000:38:33;22] IT IS NOT NORMALLY HUMID IN  
[000:38:37;13] NORTH TEXAS AND THE SOUTHERN  
[000:38:38;14] PART OF OKLAHOMA.  
[000:38:39;04] THE AIR JUST KIND OF FELT  
[000:38:40;15] WEIRD.  
[000:38:41;02] IT WAS MUGGY AND STIFLING.  
[000:38:43;09] THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN TO A  
[000:38:45;05] LOT OF THE FORECASTERS AND  
[000:38:47;00] METEOROLOGISTS BECAUSE AS  
[000:38:48;27] JANICE DEAN WAS SAYING EARLIER  
[000:38:51;04] THIS HAS REALLY SORT OF BEEN  
[000:38:52;15] TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WEATHER  
[000:38:54;22] THAT SETS UP FOR THE SUPERCELLS  
[000:38:56;20] AND CELLS THAT PRODUCE THE  
[000:38:58;06] TORNADOES.  
[000:38:59;00] AT THIS POINT WE ARE SAFE.  
[000:38:59;24] I MEAN WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES AS  
[000:39:04;29] I SAID SOUTH OF NORMAN AND IT  
[000:39:07;01] IS SUNNY.  
[000:39:08;00] THAT IS THE WEIRD THING ABOUT

[000:39:18;17] ISOLATED WITH TORNADOES.  
[000:39:20;00] SO DIFFERENT THAN A HURRICANE.  
[000:39:21;25] THE HURRICANE IS WIDESPREAD FOR  
[000:39:22;28] MILES AND MILES AND MILES AND  
[000:39:24;22] MILES YOU ARE HAVING THE STRONG  
[000:39:27;04] WINDS AND THE POURINGTHE  
[000:39:29;15] DOWNPOURS IN THE RAIN.  
[000:39:30;18] WITH THE TORNADOES IT CAN BE  
[000:39:32;29] SUNNY IN ONE AREA AND TEN MILES  
[000:39:34;17] TO THE EAST OF YOU TORNADOES ON  
[000:39:38;01] THE GROUND DOING LOTS AND LOTS  
[000:39:40;13] OF DAMAGE.  
[000:39:41;04] THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY ALARMING  
[000:39:43;04] WITH THESE.  
[000:39:43;26] EVEN THOUGH FORECASTERS WERE  
[000:39:45;10] PREDICTING THIS, THESE DROP  
[000:39:46;19] DOWN OUT OF THE SKY.  
[000:39:47;16] THEY ARE ON THE GROUND FOR A  
[000:39:48;19] FEW MINUTES.  
[000:39:50;00] DO A TON OF DAMAGE AND THEN  
[000:39:52;19] ASCEND BACK UP INTO THE CLOUDS  
[000:39:54;06] AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING  
[000:39:55;22] THROUGHOUT THE PORTIONS OF  
[000:39:56;26] OKLAHOMA THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER
