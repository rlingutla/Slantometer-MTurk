[000:01:41;684] SAYS HERNANDEZ APPEARED TO SMIRK

[000:01:47;690] ALSO INCLUDES CHARGES RELATED TO

[000:02:01;037] HIM CARRYING A GUN JUST MOMENTS
[000:02:02;772] AFTER THAT SHOOTING HAPPENED,

[000:02:07;811] THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE THEIR CASE
[000:02:09;879] BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.
[000:02:11;314] >> WE BELIEVE THAT BURDEN WILL
[000:02:13;483] NOT BE CARRIED.
[000:02:14;284] AARON HERNANDEZ IS AN INNOCENT

[000:03:15;545] I JUST MET WITH SOMEWHERE AROUND

[000:04:14;504] THOSE PEOPLE TO TURN ON
[000:04:15;738] HERNANDEZ.
[000:04:16;105] >> THE COUSIN WAS ALSO INDICTED
[000:04:18;441] TODAY, BECAUSE SHE REFUSED TO
[000:04:19;409] TESTIFY AT THE GRANDURY.
[000:04:20;743] WALLACE, ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO
[000:04:21;911] WERE WITH HIM, WAS INDICTED
[000:04:23;813] TODAY AS AN ACCESSORY AFTER THE
[000:04:25;281] FACT.
[000:04:25;581] THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
[000:04:26;215] INVOLVED IN THIS.
[000:04:28;418] THE FIANCEE WILL HAVE MORE
[000:04:29;585] INVESTIGATION AFTER HER, BECAUSE
[000:04:31;120] THERE'S THOUGHT HE HAD HELPED TO
[000:04:32;322] GET RID OF THE GUN.
[000:04:33;423] THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
[000:04:34;424] COULD BE INVOLVED, A LOT OF
[000:04:35;525] PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO BE AFRAID OF
[000:04:37;860] HIM.
[000:04:38;194] >> Shepard: THE FIANCEE LEFT THE
[000:04:39;128] COURTHOUSE IN TEARS TODAY.
[000:04:40;430] SO FAR SHE DOES NOT FACE CHARGES
[000:04:42;699] IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHOOTING.
[000:04:43;833] MINUTES AGO WE GOT WORD THAT
[000:04:45;234] JURORS DECIDING THE CASE OF THE
[000:04:47;971] ACCUSED FORT HOOD SHOOTER ARE
[000:04:49;505] HEADED HOME TONIGHT, NO VERDICT

[000:05:01;751] JURORS RETURNED TO COURT ABOUT
[000:05:03;152] 15 MINUTES AGO TO ASK A COUPLE
[000:05:04;420] OF QUESTIONS, BUT AGAIN NO
[000:05:06;055] VERDICT TONIGHT.
[000:05:06;522] PROSECUTORS SAY THERE IS NO
[000:05:07;991] QUESTION THAT MAJOR HASSAN
[000:05:09;759] PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT THE
[000:05:10;793] ATTACK IN 2009 AT THAT POST IN
[000:05:13;162] TEXAS.
[000:05:13;563] HE'S NEVER EVEN DISPUTED IT.
[000:05:15;331] WHILE HE'S BEEN REPRESENTING
[000:05:17;066] HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL,
[000:05:19;369] HE'S HAD VERY LITTLE TO SAY, PUT
[000:05:21;237] UP NO DEFENSE VIRTUALLY, JUST
[000:05:22;638] ABOUT THE ONLY WORDS SPOKEN
[000:05:24;640] TODAY WERE, "THE DEFENSE CHOOSES
[000:05:26;376] NOT TO MAKE A CLOSING
[000:05:28;077] STATEMENT."
[000:05:28;578] THE 13-MEMBER JURY NEEDS ONLY
[000:05:30;446] A 2/3 MAJORITY TO FIND MAJOR
[000:05:32;515] HASSAN GUILTY OF THE CHARGES,
[000:05:33;950] BUT IF THEY WANT THE MILITARY TO
[000:05:35;151] EXECUTE HIM THEY WILL HAVE TO
[000:05:36;119] ALL BE ON BOARD.

[000:06:38;281] 13 VICTIMS WILL SPEAK ABOUT WHAT
[000:06:40;249] THIS TRAGIC ACT DID TO THEIR
[000:06:42;018] LIVES.
[000:06:42;318] MEANTIME THE U.S. SOLDIER WHO
[000:06:43;319] PLEADED GUILTY TO MURDERING 16
[000:06:45;488] VILLAGERS IN AFGHANISTAN LAST
[000:06:46;489] YEAR SAID TODAY IN COURT, I'M
[000:06:49;759] TRULY, TRULY SORRY.
[000:06:50;626] REMEMBER A JURY IS WORKING TO
[000:06:52;495] DETERMINE WHETHER THE STAFF
[000:06:54;464] SERGEANT ROBERT BALES SHOULD
[000:06:55;531] HAVE ANY CHANCE OF PAROLE.
[000:06:57;200] HE ALREADY FACES LIFE IN PRISON
[000:06:58;234] AS A RESULT OF HIS PLEA DEAL.
[000:06:59;802] TODAY IN COURT, THE SOLDIER
[000:07:01;437] CALLED HIS PREDAWN MASSACRE AN
[000:07:03;739] ACT OF COWARDICE AND ADDED
[000:07:09;078] NOTHING MAKES IT RIGHT.
[000:07:10;847] "SO MANY TIMES I'VE ASKED
[000:07:12;482] MYSELF, I DON'T KNOW WHY, SORRY
[000:07:14;317] ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH."
[000:07:15;351] HE HOPES SOMEBODY WILL TRANSLATE
[000:07:16;953] HIS REMARKS FOR THE AFGHAN
[000:07:18;988] VILLAGERS WHOSE LOVED ONES DIED.
[000:07:20;323] SOME OF THOSE SURVIVORS FACED
[000:07:21;757] HIM IN COURT THIS WEEK AND SAID
[000:07:24;260] THEY, TOO, STILL WISH TO KNOW
[000:07:25;895] WHY HE WENT ON THE RAMPAGE.

[000:22:38;840] FIVE WHITE PEOPLE SINCE THE
[000:22:40;375] VERDICT WAS READ.
[000:22:41;810] WHEN WE SPOKE TO THE DISTRICT
[000:22:42;611] ATTORNEY THIS AFTERNOON, THOUGH,
[000:22:43;445] HE SAID AS OF RIGHT NOW THEY ARE
[000:22:45;514] NOT FOCUSING ON THE CRIME --
[000:22:47;149] FOCUSING ON THE MURDER RATHER AS
[000:22:48;283] A HATE CRIME, BUT INSTEAD AS A
[000:22:51;787] HOMICIDE.
[000:22:52;154] WHILE POLICE ARE STILL SEARCHING
[000:22:53;288] FOR THE MURDER WEAPON, SCHOOLS

[000:37:04;171] AND EVEN LEAD TO FEDERAL PRICE
[000:37:05;806] CONTROLS.

[000:37:06;841] ALREADY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO
[000:37:08;809] PUBLISH THESE SCHOOL VALUE
[000:37:10;144] RATINGS, BUT TO TIE THEM TO
[000:37:11;445] FEDERAL FUNDING, THAT TAKES AN
[000:37:13;514] OKAY FROM CONGRESS.
[000:37:15;216] SHEP?

[000:43:35;663] HAVE BEEN POSTPONED.
[000:43:36;430] ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS,
[000:43:37;665] I BELIEVE, IS THE FACT THAT WE
[000:43:39;433] RAMPED UP, AND PRECAUTIONS WERE
[000:43:41;402] TAKEN, AND THAT THE OPPORTUNITY
[000:43:43;504] THEY THOUGHT THEY MAY HAVE HAD

[000:58:28;488] GUN ANYWAY, BUT THE DEFENSE
[000:58:29;689] CLAIMS THE PROSECUTION HAS NOT
[000:58:31;424] PRODUCED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO
[000:58:32;959] PROVE ITS CASE BEYOND A
[000:58:34;928] REASONABLE DOUBT.
[000:58:35;428] >>> AND WEIRDNESS ON WALL STREET
[000:58:37;931] TODAY.
[000:58:38;231] ACTUALLY NOT WALL STREET,
[000:58:39;766] BECAUSE IT'S NASDAQ, DOESN'T
[000:58:41;034] BELONG ON THE STREET, JUST IN
[000:58:42;802] THE DIGITAL WORLD.
[000:58:43;303] THEY'RE BLAMING A TECHNICAL
[000:58:45;271] GLITCH FOR A THREE-HOUR TRADING
[000:58:46;940] FREEZE TODAY.
[000:58:47;373] BY THE END OF THE SESSION, THE
[000:58:48;841] NASDAQ WAS UP 38 POINTS, MORE
[000:58:50;910] THAN A WHOLE PERCENTAGE POINT.
[000:58:53;413] THE DOW UP 66, S&P 15 WITH
[000:58:59;752] POSITIVE SIGNS FROM TRADERS IN
[000:59:01;387] EUROPE AND ASIA.
[000:59:02;055] >>> ON THIS DAY IN 1950, A
[000:59:07;093] TENNIS PHENOM NAME ALTHEA GIBSON
[000:59:09;929] BECAME THE FIRST AFRICAN
[000:59:10;530] AMERICAN PLAYER TO PLAY IN A
[000:59:11;931] U.S. NATIONAL COMPETITION.
[000:59:13;866] ALTHEA CAME FROM HARLEM, A
[000:59:15;835] NATIVE THERE, SHOWING A NATURAL
[000:59:18;004] TALENT FROM THE VERY START.
[000:59:19;572] AT 15 YEARS OLD, ALTHEA WON HER
[000:59:22;175] FIRST STATE TITLE.
[000:59:24;777] THEN 10 MORE CHAMPIONSHIPS.
[000:59:26;212] BUT OFFICIALS STILL REJECTED HER
[000:59:28;615] ENTRY INTO THE NATIONAL GRASS
[000:59:31;451] COURT CHAMPIONSHIPS, BECAUSE,
[000:59:32;552] AFTER ALL, SHE WAS BLACK.
[000:59:34;220] A TENNIS CHAMPION WROTE AN ESSAY
[000:59:35;989] SUPPORTING GIBSON.
[000:59:36;756] IN ADDITION, THE ASSOCIATION
[000:59:39;158] INVITED HER TO QUALIFY, WHICH
[000:59:40;793] SHE DID, AND EARNED A SPOT IN
[000:59:42;328] THE BIG TOURNAMENT.
[000:59:44;297] ALTHEA GIBSON WOULD VIL WIN
[000:59:46;699] MAJOR EVENTS THROUGHOUT HER
[000:59:48;434] CAREER, INCLUDING WIMBLEDON AND
[000:59:49;969] THE FRENCH AND U.S. OPENS, BUT
[000:59:52;038] SHE ACED THE TENNIS COLOR
[000:59:56;643] BARRIER 63 YEARS AGO TODAY.
[000:59:59;812] AND NOW YOU KNOW THE NEWS FOR
[001:00:01;881] THIS THURSDAY, AUGUST 22nd,
[001:00:05;184] 2013.
[001:00:05;485] I'M STO SHEPARD SMITH.

[001:00:17;764] "O'REILLY" COMES ON NOW.
[001:00:21;701] >> Bill: TONIGHT --
[001:00:22;235] >> THEY DON'T HAVE MALE FIGURES
[001:00:23;569] IN THEIR LIVES.
[001:00:24;971] YOU CAN'T GIVE KIDS LIBERTY TO
[001:00:26;939] DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH NO
[001:00:29;375] RESTRAINTS WHATSOEVER.
[001:00:30;977] >> Bill: THE THREE TEENAGERS

[001:00:34;280] AUSTRALIAN MAN IN OKLAHOMA ARE

[001:00:42;522] STATE DINNER NEXT WEEK.

[001:00:45;692] I'M INVITING YOU AS A GUEST.
[001:00:47;760] >> SOME CONSERVATIVES WANT
[001:00:51;931] MOVIEGOERS TO BOYCOTT "THE
[001:00:55;201] BUTLER" BECAUSE JASON FONDA
[001:00:56;836] POSTERIOR TRACES NANCY REAGAN.
[001:00:57;870] IS THAT FAIR?
[001:00:58;738] >>
