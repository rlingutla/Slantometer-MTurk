[000:00:31;13] WE WILL SHOW YOU THE  
[000:00:32;05] DAMAGE, THE DESTRUCTION,  
[000:00:33;02] THE RECOVERY EFFORTS AND  
[000:00:34;18] YOU WILL MEET THE PEOPLE IN  
[000:00:35;20] THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL.  
[000:00:36;23] THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.  
[000:00:38;03] AND THE NEWS BEGINS NOW.
[000:00:43;10] >> Shepard: LIVE ON THE  
[000:00:44;02] GROUND NOW, MOORE  
[000:00:44;27] OKLAHOMA, WHERE TODAY THE  
[000:00:46;01] MEDICAL EXAMINER ANNOUNCED  
[000:00:47;13] HIS OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED  
[000:00:49;06] ALMOST ALL OF THE 24 PEOPLE  
[000:00:50;13] WHO DIED IN THE TORNADO  
[000:00:51;21] MONDAY.  
[000:00:52;12] 10 OF THOSE VICTIMS,  
[000:00:54;04] CHILDREN.  
[000:00:54;19] TWO OF THOSE INFANTS, LESS  
[000:00:56;03] THAN A YEAR OLD.  
[000:00:57;08] ONE MAN WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS  
[000:00:58;18] AMONG THOSE KILLED AT PLAZA  
[000:01:00;03] HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  
[000:01:01;08] SAYS HE ARRIVED THERE 10  
[000:01:03;05] MINUTES AFTER THE TWISTER  
[000:01:04;11] HIT AND HE SAYS WHEN HE  
[000:01:05;28] FINALLY RETURNED TO HIS  
[000:01:08;00] HOUSE, WITHOUT HIS CHILD  
[000:01:09;11] HIS HOME WAS GONE.  
[000:01:11;13] THE LATEST OFFICIAL  
[000:01:13;09] ESTIMATES INDICATE THIS  
[000:01:14;02] TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR  
[000:01:15;25] DESTROYED UP TO 13,000  
[000:01:18;09] HOMES.  
[000:01:18;23] I MENTIONED EARLIER WE GOT  
[000:01:19;28] A LOOK FROM THE SKY AND A  
[000:01:21;04] LENGTHY ONE.  
[000:01:21;21] WE WERE UP FOR HOURS  
[000:01:23;02] LOOKING AT THE DESTRUCTION  
[000:01:23;27] THE TORNADO INFLICTED.  
[000:01:26;19] IT IS A BROKEN LINE OF  
[000:01:28;11] OBLITERATION.  
[000:01:28;28] A SCAR ACROSS AMERICA'S  
[000:01:30;00] HEART LAND.  
[000:01:30;23] ONE THAT STRETCHES FOR MANY  
[000:01:32;09] MILES.  
[000:01:32;23] >> WE'RE STARTING IN PLAZA  
[000:01:33;29] TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  
[000:01:35;05] THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE THE  
[000:01:36;18] SEVEN CHILDREN DIED.  
[000:01:37;24] AND THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE  
[000:01:39;20] WE WATCHED FROM THE  
[000:01:41;03] HELICOPTER TWO DAYS AGO AS  
[000:01:43;05] RESCUE WORKERS AND  
[000:01:44;14] NEIGHBORS WERE PULLING AWAY  
[000:01:45;24] ALL OF THE -- WHAT WAS LEFT  
[000:01:46;29] OF THE SCHOOL TO TRY TO GET  
[000:01:48;05] TO THE CHILDREN.  
[000:01:49;12] IN HOPES, IN HOPES THAT  
[000:01:50;13] THEY COULD GET SOME OUT  
[000:01:52;12] ALIVE.  
[000:01:52;25] AS IT TURNED OUT, IT WAS AN  
[000:01:54;04] AWFUL SCENE THERE.  
[000:01:55;15] BUT THEY ARE HARD AT WORK  
[000:01:57;07] TODAY, TRYING TO REMOVE  
[000:01:58;04] WHAT'S THERE.  
[000:01:58;23] BECAUSE THE GOAL NOW IS TO  
[000:02:00;15] GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES.  
[000:02:02;11] OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES  
[000:02:03;26] WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU  
[000:02:04;28] ALONG THE PATH OF THE  
[000:02:05;27] STORM.  
[000:02:06;11] I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM  
[000:02:07;16] THE SCHOOL ACROSS ABOUT A  
[000:02:09;06] FOUR TO FIVE MILE AREA OF  
[000:02:10;21] THE WORST OF DESTRUCTION.  
[000:02:13;01] YOU WILL SEE HOW THE WIDTH  
[000:02:14;19] OF THE STORM THE WIDTH OF  
[000:02:16;11] THIS TORNADO CHANGES AS WE  
[000:02:17;21] MOVE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.  
[000:02:19;09] SCOTT, TAKE US OUT THERE IF  
[000:02:20;13] YOU COULD.  
[000:02:21;06] AND THIS -- WE'RE IN THE  
[000:02:22;11] SCHOOL AREA NOW AND AS HE  
[000:02:24;08] ZOOMS, IN YOU WILL BE ABLE  
[000:02:25;08] TO SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR  
[000:02:26;23] AREA HOMES WERE REDUCED TO  
[000:02:31;04] ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  
[000:02:38;06] THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS  
[000:02:39;00] WHERE THE STORM WAS AT ITS  
[000:02:40;27] WIDEST.  
[000:02:41;12] THINK OF THIS AS A FUNNEL  
[000:02:42;27] LIKE YOU WOULD USE IN YOUR  
[000:02:45;08] KITCHEN.  
[000:02:45;23] THE TIP OF THE FUNNEL IS  
[000:02:46;22] VERY THIN.  
[000:02:47;24] THE TOP IS VERY WIDE.  
[000:02:49;02] BUT IF YOU COULD PUSH THAT  
[000:02:50;17] FUNNEL DOWN INTO THE  
[000:02:52;10] GROUND, THE AREA WHICH IS  
[000:02:54;23] CONCENTRATED ON THE GROUND,  
[000:02:55;29] IT'S WIDER.  
[000:02:56;23] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.  
[000:02:57;17] THAT'S WHY IN THIS AREA  
[000:02:58;24] THE WIDTH OF THE STORM THE  
[000:03:01;00] WIDTH OF THE TORNADO WAS  
[000:03:01;28] ABOUT TWO MILES.  
[000:03:02;24] SO THE AREA OF DESTRUCTION  
[000:03:05;27] IS MASSIVE AND THE DENSITY  
[000:03:07;08] OF IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.  
[000:03:09;03] YOU DON'T SEE A BUNCH OF  
[000:03:11;05] HOUSES STILL THAT MIGHT BE  
[000:03:12;08] ABLE TO BUILD AROUND.  
[000:03:13;10] YOU SEE NOTHING BUT DEBRIS.  
[000:03:15;22] IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY -- AS  
[000:03:17;04] IF A GIANT CAME IN AND  
[000:03:18;19] SQUISHED IT IN HIS HAND AND  
[000:03:20;14] DROPPED IT IT ON THE  
[000:03:21;18] GROUND.  
[000:03:22;02] THROUGHOUT THIS AREA, NOW  
[000:03:24;05] THE PATH OF THE DESTRUCTION  
[000:03:25;13] IS THINNER.  
[000:03:26;20] THE CLOUDS LIFTED UP SOME.  
[000:03:28;12] AND THE AREA OF THE FUNNEL  
[000:03:29;16] CLOUD THAT WAS TOUCHING THE  
[000:03:31;03] GROUND IS SMALLER.  
[000:03:31;29] YOU WILL SEE SOME THE  
[000:03:33;12] DESTRUCTION ISN'T QUITE AS  
[000:03:34;25] SEVERE.  
[000:03:35;10] IN SOME OF THESE AREAS YOU  
[000:03:36;11] WILL SEE BLUE TARPS ON TOP  
[000:03:37;22] OF HOUSE AFTER HOUSE.  
[000:03:39;00] THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE THEY  
[000:03:39;28] ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO  
[000:03:41;20] SALVAGE THE HOME.  
[000:03:42;13] BUT, BEHIND US, IT WASN'T  
[000:03:43;17] LIKE THAT AT ALL.  
[000:03:44;23] SCOTT, PULL OUT AND SHOW  
[000:03:45;29] FORWARD IF YOU WOULD, AND  
[000:03:46;26] YOU WILL SEE AHEAD OF US  
[000:03:48;06] THE PATH OF THE STORM WAS  
[000:03:49;24] MUCH THINNER, MEANING THE  
[000:03:52;19] CLOUDS HAD LIFTED HIGHER  
[000:03:54;00] AND THE PART OF THE CONE  
[000:03:55;07] THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE  
[000:03:56;00] GROUND IS MUCH SMALLER.  
[000:03:57;12] THE WINDS GET STRONGER AND  
[000:03:58;27] WEAKER AS THE STORM MOVES  
[000:04:00;16] ALONG LIKE ANYTHING ELSE  
[000:04:01;15] IT PICKS UP ENERGY AND IN  
[000:04:06;14] SPURTS IT WILL BE STRONGER  
[000:04:07;17] THAN IT WAS BEFORE.  
[000:04:08;16] WE ARE A LITTLE MORE THAN  
[000:04:09;24] HALFWAY THROUGH THE  
[000:04:10;14] DESTRUCTION OF THIS NOW.  
[000:04:11;08] AND YOU CAN SEE AGAIN I'M  
[000:04:13;00] TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA  
[000:04:14;15] OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS.  
[000:04:16;07] WE ARE FLYING ALONG A  
[000:04:17;03] STRAIGHT LINE.  
[000:04:17;27] AND AS YOU LOOK ALONG THAT  
[000:04:19;08] STRAIGHT LINE.  
[000:04:20;12] NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER  
[000:04:21;03] NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE AFTER  
[000:04:22;24] HOUSE, JUST COMPLETELY  
[000:04:24;29] OBLITERATED.  
[000:04:25;16] IF HE PULLS OUT JUST A  
[000:04:26;08] LITTLE BIT, YOU WILL SEE  
[000:04:27;09] THAT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT  
[000:04:28;07] OF THE SHOT, THERE ARE  
[000:04:29;16] HOUSES THAT ARE JUST FINE.  
[000:04:30;27] THIS ISN'T A TWO MILE WIDE  
[000:04:32;10] PATH IN THIS AREA.  
[000:04:33;18] IT'S MUCH THINNER THAN THAT  
[000:04:35;04] IN SOME AREAS IT'S JUST A  
[000:04:36;16] FEW HUNDRED YARDS WIDE.  
[000:04:37;27] BUT IF YOUR HOME WAS IN  
[000:04:39;05] THAT AREA, YOUR HOME IS  
[000:04:41;28] DESTROYED.  
[000:04:42;14] IF YOU WERE JUST TO THE  
[000:04:43;08] LEFT OR RIGHT OF IT YOU  
[000:04:44;02] MIGHT HAVE SOME ROOF DAMAGE  
[000:04:45;09] AND THEN THE NEXT SERIES OF  
[000:04:46;26] HOUSES OVER, THERE MIGHT BE  
[000:04:48;06] DEBRIS FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR'S  
[000:04:50;00] HOME, WHAT USED TO BE YOUR  
[000:04:51;12] NEIGHBOR'S HOME ON TOP OF  
[000:04:52;14] YOUR HOUSE OR IN YOUR YARD.  
[000:04:54;20] BUT YOUR HOUSE ITSELF IS  
[000:04:56;17] FINE.  
[000:04:57;00] THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS  
[000:04:58;06] STORM.  
[000:04:58;19] NOW, BACK TO THE PATH OF IT  
[000:05:00;08] ITSELF.  
[000:05:00;22] AND WE ARE COMING INTO AN  
[000:05:01;21] AREA THAT'S MORE -- THAT'S  
[000:05:03;08] LESS POPULATED.  
[000:05:04;05] YOU WILL SEE AN AREA WHERE  
[000:05:05;22] IT JUST SORT OF DUG UP THE  
[000:05:08;06] DIRT AND REPLACED THE GRASS  
[000:05:09;18] WITH DIRT.  
[000:05:10;09] AND THEN THERE WILL BE A  
[000:05:11;19] HOME HERE AND A HOME THERE.  
[000:05:12;26] AND JUST AHEAD OF US IS THE  
[000:05:14;13] SPOT WHERE THE TORNADO  
[000:05:15;21] ACTUALLY LIFTED BACK INTO  
[000:05:17;19] THE SKY.  
[000:05:19;05] LIFTED BACK NOT TO BE SEEN  
[000:05:21;03] AGAIN AND THEN THE  
[000:05:22;01] RESIDENTS CAME BACK TO TRY  
[000:05:23;11] TO ASSESS WHAT HAD  
[000:05:24;21] HAPPENED.  
[000:05:25;06] THE DAMAGE WAS EXTENSIVE.  
[000:05:26;19] THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE  
[000:05:28;02] AHEAD IS WEEKS AND MONTHS.  
[000:05:30;17] BUT THEY HAVE VOWED THEY  
[000:05:31;16] WILL REBUILD AND WHEN YOU  
[000:05:32;18] LOOK DOWN BELOW, YOU WONDER  
[000:05:34;26] CAN THOSE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE  
[000:05:36;16] IN THE YEARS TO COME?  
[000:05:40;19] OKLAHOMANS TELL US THEY  
[000:05:41;11] CAN.  
[000:05:43;03] >> Shepard: OUR THANKS TO  
[000:05:44;06] JIM JOHNSON WHO GAVE US

[000:05:53;05] FLYING THAT SAME PATH WHEN  
[000:05:54;11] THE LAST HUGE STORM HIT  
[000:05:55;26] HERE.  
[000:05:56;09] HE SAYS IN AREAS THE  
[000:05:57;03] DESTRUCTION IS WORSE, BUT  
[000:05:58;11] THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF THE  
[000:06:00;02] DESTRUCTION IN 1999 WAS  
[000:06:01;19] LONGER.  
[000:06:03;19] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS  
[000:06:04;11] PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL HEAD  
[000:06:05;06] HERE ON SUNDAY TO SEAT  
[000:06:06;04] DAMAGE FOR HIMSELF.

[000:23:12;09] PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE AREAS

[000:23:20;07] HOMES, GET TO THEIR  
[000:23:21;13] BELONGINGS AND TRY TO

[000:23:30;23] TODAY.  
[000:23:31;06] PEOPLE STANDING ON PILES OF

[000:29:20;01] INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OVER  
[000:29:20;26] THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT  
[000:29:22;05] FEW TO ME HAVE BEEN AS  
[000:29:23;24] INSPIRING AS THAT OF  
[000:29:25;18] THERESA MOSIER.  
[000:29:26;06] SHE IS A FOURTH GRADE  
[000:29:28;13] TEACHER AT BRIAR WOOD  
[000:29:30;15] ELEMENTARY.  
[000:29:31;01] WHEN THE TORNADO WARNINGS  
[000:29:31;24] CAME, IN SEVERAL OF THE  
[000:29:32;28] PARENTS OF HER CHILDREN  
[000:29:33;26] RUSHED TO THAT SCHOOL, GOT  
[000:29:35;23] THEIR KIDS, TOOK THEM AWAY.  
[000:29:37;23] BUT WHEN THE TORNADO HIT  
[000:29:39;05] SHE STILL HAD 10 CHILDREN  
[000:29:42;28] THERE.  
[000:29:43;11] THEIR LIVES IN HER HANDS.  
[000:29:45;22] HERE IS THERESA MOSIER.  
[000:29:47;15] >> YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN UP  
[000:29:49;03] AGAINST THE INSIDE WALL.  
[000:29:50;18] YOU HAVE THEM GET DOWN ON  
[000:29:51;25] THEIR KNEES.  
[000:29:52;21] PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR  
[000:29:54;12] HEAD AND PUT THEIR HEADS  
[000:29:55;16] YOU KNOW, DOWN.  
[000:29:56;13] AND THEN AS WE HEARD IT  
[000:29:58;02] APPROACHING, BECAUSE YOU  
[000:29:58;25] COULD HEAR IT IT WAS LIKE  
[000:30:01;12] 10 FREIGHT TRAINS.  
[000:30:02;07] AND AS IT APPROACHED, YOU  
[000:30:03;23] KNOW, I JUST PUT MY ARMS  
[000:30:05;20] OVER THE CHILDREN.  
[000:30:07;05] I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING IS  
[000:30:08;13] GOING TO BE OKAY.  
[000:30:09;20] KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, YOU  
[000:30:11;17] KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE SO  
[000:30:13;09] CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR  
[000:30:16;01] SAFETY.  
[000:30:16;16] THERE IS NOT A ONE OF US IN  
[000:30:17;20] THAT BUILDING THAT WOULD  
[000:30:18;25] NOT HAVE LAID DOWN OUR  
[000:30:20;02] LIVES FOR THOSE KIDS.  
[000:30:21;17] AND THEY WERE SCARED.  
[000:30:23;10] THEY ARE CRYING THEY ARE  
[000:30:25;02] UPSET.  
[000:30:25;15] BUT THOSE ARE THE BRAVEST  
[000:30:27;18] LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE  
[000:30:28;13] WORLD.  
[000:30:29;18] >> I THINK THEY WOULD SAY  
[000:30:30;19] YOU ARE THE BRAVEST TEACHER  
[000:30:32;00] IN THE WORLD.  
[000:30:33;14] WELL, WHEN IT HAD HAD  
[000:30:35;15] PASSED OVER THROUGH THEIR  
[000:30:36;18] TEARS, THROUGH EVERYTHING,  
[000:30:37;24] THEY GOT UP THEY HELPED  
[000:30:40;03] TAKE CINDER BLOCKS OFF  
[000:30:41;13] THEIR CLASSMATES' LEGS.  
[000:30:42;23] THEY HELPED TO UNWIND WIRES  
[000:30:45;01] AND METAL THAT HAD WRAPPED  
[000:30:46;11] AROUND ANOTHER STUDENT'S  
[000:30:48;29] LEGS.  
[000:30:49;12] EVEN IN THAT THEY STILL  
[000:30:51;27] KNEW TO HELP THEIR  
[000:30:53;01] CO-WORKERS AND SO I'M SO  
[000:30:54;06] PROUD OF THEM.  
[000:30:55;08] I'M SO PROUD TO BE THEIR  
[000:30:57;12] TEACHER BECAUSE THEY ARE  
[000:30:59;18] REMARKABLE AND RESILIENT  
[000:31:02;00] CHILDREN.  
[000:31:02;19] >> THERE IS A LOT OF  
[000:31:03;25] FAMILIES THANKING YOU FOR  
[000:31:05;03] KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN  
[000:31:05;25] ALIVE TODAY.  
[000:31:06;12] >> WELL, THERE WASN'T AN  
[000:31:07;26] OPTION.  
[000:31:08;10] THAT'S NOT AN OPTION NOT TO  
[000:31:09;15] KEEP THEM ALIVE.  
[000:31:10;13] I HAVE CHILDREN OF MY OWN.  
[000:31:12;01] AND I KNOW THAT ANY TEACHER  
[000:31:14;24] IN THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE  
[000:31:15;25] DONE THE SAME EXACT THING.  
[000:31:17;08] AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE  
[000:31:18;19] SURE THOSE CHILDREN SAW  
[000:31:19;24] THEIR PARENTS AGAIN.  
[000:31:20;22] AND THEIR PARENTS SAW THEM.  
[000:31:22;28] >> SHE CALLED THOSE FOURTH  
[000:31:25;10] GRADERS BRAVE AND  
[000:31:26;25] REMARKABLE.  
[000:31:27;11] SHEP.  
[000:31:27;24] I'M NOT SURE I HAVE MET  
[000:31:29;05] ANYBODY AS BRAVE OR AS  
[000:31:30;14] REMARKABLE AS THERESA  
[000:31:31;16] MOSIER HERSELF.  
[000:31:32;16] EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.  
[000:31:33;27] >> Shepard: VERY  
[000:31:34;17] IMPRESSIVE.  
[000:31:35;03] JONATHAN, THANKS FOR HER  
[000:31:35;29] STORY.  
[000:31:36;13] WELL, FOR THE FIRST TIME  
[000:31:37;08] THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS NOW  
[000:31:38;25] CONFIRMING FOUR AMERICAN  
[000:31:39;22] CITIZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED  
[000:31:40;22] IN WHAT IT CALLS SENSITIVE  
[000:31:44;19] COUNTER TERRORISM  
[000:31:45;12] OPERATIONS.  
[000:31:45;28] WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?  
[000:31:46;19] IT MEANS THE GOVERNMENT  
[000:31:47;26] DRONED THEM.  
[000:31:48;26] THE FEDS ARE ALSO ADMITTING  
[000:31:50;13] THAT THEY MEANT TO KILL  
[000:31:52;00] ONLY ONE OF THOSE  
[000:31:53;27] AMERICANS.  
[000:31:54;12] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS  
[000:31:55;04] PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTED TO  
[000:31:55;28] RELEASE THE LIST BEFORE HE  
[000:31:56;27] GIVES A SPEECH ON NATIONAL  
[000:31:58;01] SECURITY.  
[000:31:58;16] THAT'S SET FOR TOMORROW.  
[000:31:59;21] JENNIFER GRIFFIN IS AT THE  
[000:32:00;23] PENTAGON FOR US TONIGHT.  
[000:32:02;11] WHO ARE THESE FOUR  
[000:32:03;09] AMERICANS WHOM OUR  
[000:32:04;03] GOVERNMENT KILLED?  
[000:32:05;09] >> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING  
[000:32:06;26] SHEPARD.  
[000:32:07;10] IN HIS LETTER TO CONGRESS  
[000:32:09;14] ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC  
[000:32:10;14] HOLDER DID NOT ACTUALLY USE  
[000:32:12;10] THE WORD DRONE OR UNMANNED  
[000:32:14;19] AERIAL VEHICLE AS SOME NEWS  
[000:32:16;10] REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED.  
[000:32:17;12] BUT INSTEAD, AS YOU  
[000:32:18;24] MENTIONED, HE USED THE  
[000:32:20;18] PHRASE SENSITIVE COUNTER  
[000:32:22;06] TERRORISM OPERATIONS TO  
[000:32:24;04] DESCRIBE HOW THESE FOUR  
[000:32:25;06] AMERICANS WERE KILLED.  
[000:32:26;04] IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE  
[000:32:27;29] ADMINISTRATION HAS ADMITTED  
[000:32:28;25] THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR  
[000:32:30;13] KILLING THESE AMERICANS.  
[000:32:31;17] WHO WERE THEY?  
[000:32:32;10] WHO WERE THESE AMERICANS?  
[000:32:35;09] ANWAR AL-AWLAKI WAS ONE OF  
[000:32:36;04] THEM.  
[000:32:36;17] HE INTENDED TO BRING DOWN A  
[000:32:38;03] U.S. PLANE WITH THE  
[000:32:39;10] UNDERWEAR BOMBER.  
[000:32:40;23] YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT AL  
[000:32:42;20] AWLAKI'S 16-YEAR-OLD SON  
[000:32:43;13] WAS ALSO KILLED.  
[000:32:45;23] IRAQMAN.  
[000:32:46;08] THEN THERE WAS SAMIR KHAN.  
[000:32:49;04] THE EDITOR OF INSPIRE  
[000:32:52;20] MAGAZINE AND -- NORTH  
[000:32:53;22] KOREAN WHO LEFT FOR  
[000:32:54;24] PAKISTAN IN 2008 AND  
[000:32:56;03] INDICTED FOR A PLOT TO BLOW  
[000:32:57;18] UP BRIDGES AND TUNNELS IN  
[000:32:58;15] THE UNITED STATES.  
[000:32:59;12] HOLDER SAYS ONLY AL AWLAKI,  
[000:33:02;13] ANWAR AL-AWLAKI WAS  
[000:33:03;04] TARGETED DIRECTLY, SHEPARD.  
[000:33:05;01] >> YOU KNOW, IT'S MY  
[000:33:06;07] UNDERSTANDING JENNIFER  
[000:33:07;01] THAT THE PRESIDENT IS  
[000:33:07;23] EXPECTED TO MAKE SOME VERY  
[000:33:08;22] BIG NEWS ON GUANTANAMO BAY  
[000:33:11;02] HIS SPEECH TOMORROW.  
[000:33:12;11] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:33:13;00] IN FACT THE PRESIDENT  
[000:33:13;28] DURING HIS SPEECH TOMORROW  
[000:33:15;25] PLANS TO ANNOUNCE WE KNOW  
[000:33:18;00] ACCORDING TO SOURCES, PLANS  
[000:33:19;16] TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS  
[000:33:20;28] LIFTING RESTRICTIONS ON THE  
[000:33:22;28] TRANSFER OF DETAINEES FROM  
[000:33:24;19] GUANTANAMO BAY TO YEMEN.  
[000:33:26;25] THAT PROCESS HAD BEEN  
[000:33:29;05] FROZEN.  
[000:33:29;19] THE TRANSFER OF THOSE  
[000:33:30;23] DETAI YEMEN HAD BEEN  
[000:33:32;17] FROZEN FOR SOME TIME.  
[000:33:33;18] THE RENEWED COOPERATION  
[000:33:35;17] WITH YEMEN IS LIKELY TO  
[000:33:37;23] DECREASE THE GITMO DETAINEE  
[000:33:39;19] POPULATION WE'RE TOLD WHICH  
[000:33:40;22] CURRENTLY STANDS AT 166  
[000:33:42;29] PRISONERS.  
[000:33:43;15] 103 OF THOSE PRISONERS ARE  
[000:33:45;06] CURRENTLY ON HUNGER STRIKE.  
[000:33:46;12] THEY ARE BEING FORCE FED  
[000:33:47;17] FOR THE PAST 100 DAYS.  
[000:33:49;11] THE PRESIDENT, AS YOU WILL  
[000:33:51;11] REMEMBER, PROMISED TO CLOSE  
[000:33:52;17] GITMO WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE.  
[000:33:53;16] BUT HE HAS BEEN STYMIED IN  
[000:33:55;05] DOING SO SHEPARD.  
[000:33:57;23] >> Shepard: JENNIFER  
[000:33:58;17] GRIFFIN REPORTING FROM THE

[000:34:08;01] LOIS LERNER IS THE HEAD OF  
[000:34:09;12] THE AGENCY'S TAX EXEMPT  
[000:34:11;23] DIVISION.  
[000:34:12;13] SHE HAS APOLOGIZED FOR  
[000:34:14;07] STAFFERS TARGETING  
[000:34:14;27] CONSERVATIVE GROUPS THAT  
[000:34:15;24] APPLIED FOR TAX EXEMPT

[000:34:17;20] TODAY SHE REFUSED TO ANSWER  
[000:34:18;16] ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE  
[000:34:19;23] SCANDAL.  
[000:34:20;07] BUT ONE REPUBLICAN SAYS  
[000:34:21;11] LERNER TRIED TO HAVE IT  
[000:34:22;12] BOTH WAYS.  
[000:34:23;13] BY ALSO PLEADING HER CASE  
[000:34:24;24] IN AN OPENING STATEMENT.  
[000:34:26;22] >> I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING  
[000:34:29;15] WRONG.  
[000:34:31;11] I HAVE NOT BROKEN ANY LAWS.  
[000:34:34;03] I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW MY

[000:34:40;22] >> SHE JUST TESTIFIED.  
[000:34:41;28] SHE JUST WAIVED HER FIFTH  
[000:34:43;13] AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

[000:34:44;20] YOU DON'T GET TO TELL YOUR  
[000:34:45;20] SIDE OF THE STORY AND THEN  
[000:34:46;21] NOT BE SUBJECTED TO  
[000:34:48;23] CROSS-EXAMINATION.  
[000:34:49;18] >> THE GENTLE LADY WHO HAS  
[000:34:51;26] DEPARTED WAS ENTITLED TO  
[000:34:52;26] ASSERT HER FIFTH AMENDMENT  
[000:34:54;19] ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME  
[000:34:55;16] QUESTIONS HOW IT WAS DONE  
[000:34:57;02] IT THERE COULD BE NO  
[000:34:58;03] QUESTION THAT WE HAVE TO  
[000:34:59;10] RESPECT IT.  
[000:35:00;06] >> WELL, THAT'S CHAIRMAN  
[000:35:02;00] DARRELL ISSA.  
[000:35:02;18] HE SAYS THE COMMITTEE WILL  
[000:35:03;14] CALL LERNER BACK TO TESTIFY  
[000:35:04;26] IF THE LAWYERS DECIDE SHE  
[000:35:05;27] DID BREAK ANY RULES.

[000:35:09;11] FROM WASHINGTON TONIGHT.

[000:35:11;23] CLAIMS THE FIFTH THEY  
[000:35:12;19] USUALLY DO SOUGHT WITHOUT  
[000:35:14;22] EQUIVOCATION.  
[000:35:15;09] THEY STATE IT, AND THEN  
[000:35:16;02] THEY SHUT UP.  
[000:35:17;04] NOT SO LOIS LERNER.  
[000:35:19;02] REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN TREY  
[000:35:20;15] GOWDY HIMSELF A FORMER  
[000:35:21;28] PROSECUTOR JUMPED ON IT AS

[000:35:32;29] WAS ABSOLUTELY NO TARGETING  
[000:35:34;07] TAKING PLACE.

[000:35:48;21] >> I'M SORRY THAT'S SIMPLY  
[000:35:50;12] NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  
[000:35:51;03] YOU PERSONALLY KNEW THERE  
[000:35:52;28] WAS A TARGET LIST.  
[000:35:57;02] >> THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO  
[000:35:58;16] KNOW HOW HIGH KNOWLEDGE OF  
[000:35:59;17] THE TARGETING WENT AND WHO  
[000:36:01;08] ORDERED IT.  
[000:36:03;05] SHULMAN ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE

[000:46:37;00] Others, because of our  reputation
[000:46:37;20] for reliability.
[000:46:40;20] Or maybe it's because  we've received
