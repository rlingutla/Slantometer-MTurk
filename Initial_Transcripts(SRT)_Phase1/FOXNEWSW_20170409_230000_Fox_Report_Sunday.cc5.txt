[000:14:53;042] CARSON RETURNED TO THE DETROIT
[000:14:55;010] NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:14:58;213] THAT TRIP TO SHOW, THEN
[000:14:58;814] CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP TO SHOW
[000:15:00;249] THE MORE IMPOVERISHED AREAS.
[000:15:01;283] NOW, HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DO MORE
[000:15:03;152] THAN JUST PUT ROOFTOPS OVER THE
[000:15:04;720] HEADS OF AMERICANS.
[000:15:07;623] HE HOPES TO EMPOWER THEM AS
[000:15:09;725] WELL.
[000:15:12;261] SECRETARY CARSON IS HERE TO TELL
[000:15:12;995] US ABOUT THE PLAN.
[000:15:14;263] IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:15:22;071] THANKS FOR JOINING US.
[000:15:22;972] MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU HAS TO
[000:15:23;706] DO WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO
[000:15:24;406] GATHER INFORMATION.
[000:15:24;940] YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
[000:15:25;541] LISTENING TO HER.
[000:15:26;041] I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE YOU
[000:15:27;276] HAVE GOTTEN WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD.
[000:15:32;982] >> THE FIRST PLACE I STARTED WAS
[000:15:33;716] IN THE HUD BUILDING.
[000:15:34;817] PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE
[000:15:36;919] FROM 10 - OF 40 YEARS AND THEY
[000:15:43;692] HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT
[000:15:44;293] INFORMATION.
[000:15:44;693] I'M STILL GETTING INFORMATION
[000:15:45;394] FROM THEM.
[000:15:45;761] AS I HAVE GONE TO SOME OF THE
[000:15:46;462] CITIES, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
[000:15:47;162] HAS IMPRESSED ME AND WORKED
[000:15:47;830] EXTRAORDINARY WHILE WAS THE
[000:15:49;264] PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND
[000:15:52;968] THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL
[000:15:54;870] DOLLARS IN SOME PLACES LIKE
[000:15:58;107] DETROIT, AT A RATE OF 8 - 1.
[000:16:02;311] THIS GETS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY
[000:16:06;582] INVESTED IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVE
[000:16:08;050] A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE
[000:16:09;685] THE PROJECT SUCCEEDS.
[000:16:14;390] SO YOU DON'T HAVE JUST THESE
[000:16:15;057] FEDERAL PEOPLE LOOKING OVER
[000:16:15;724] EVERYBODY'S SHOULDER.
[000:16:16;959] I THINK THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
[000:16:21;530] >> YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING?
[000:16:22;231] WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOREIGN
[000:16:23;065] POLICY THAT WE HAVE NOT TALKED
[000:16:24;366] AS MUCH ABOUT DOMESTIC POLICY
[000:16:29;104] THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEN
[000:16:31;573] CANDIDATE WANTED TO FOCUS ON IN
[000:16:32;307] URBAN AREAS.
[000:16:32;708] CREATING JOBS IS AN AREA HE
[000:16:34;143] THOUGHT HE COULD WIN VICTORY.
[000:16:35;911] GOING FORWARD, WHAT YOU SEE IS
[000:16:37;146] THE PLAN?
[000:16:40;015] I HAVE BEEN READING THAT YOU
[000:16:41;517] WILL BE LEANING ON RICH URBAN
[000:16:43;552] HOMEOWNERS TO BE HELPING OUT
[000:16:48;357] THEIR NEIGHBORS.
[000:16:49;191] HAVE YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT
[000:16:50;826] TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
[000:16:52;861] THAT?
[000:16:55;998] >> THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE VERY
[000:16:56;732] WELL ALIGNED.
[000:16:57;166] WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS ALREADY
[000:16:58;867] IN PLACE, LIKE SECTION THREE
[000:17:01;336] WHICH REQUIRES THOSE PEOPLE
[000:17:02;771] RECEIVING HOUSING FUNDS TO
[000:17:05;374] EMPLOY SOME OF THE LOW INCOME
[000:17:06;909] PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:17:09;478] IT HAS BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED
[000:17:11;080] ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE
[000:17:13;482] PEOPLE FREQUENTLY DO NOT HAVE
[000:17:15;017] THE SKILLS.
[000:17:24;026] WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS A WAY
[000:17:24;760] TO, AHEAD OF TIME, MAYBE A YEAR
[000:17:25;494] AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE MAJOR
[000:17:26;161] PROJECT, GO IN AND TRAIN PEOPLE.
[000:17:27;529] NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT EXCUSE.
[000:17:30;599] WE HAVE MORE EMPLOYMENT OF
[000:17:31;366] PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP WITH
[000:17:31;967] INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.
[000:17:33;602] NOW THEY HAVE A SKILL THAT
[000:17:36;205] TRAINS THEM.
[000:17:38;107] THESE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO DO
[000:17:42;077] WITH TO DEVELOP OUR PEOPLE.
[000:17:48;083] NOT JUST PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR
[000:17:48;784] HEAD.
[000:17:49;084] DEVELOPING THE WHOLE PERSON.
[000:17:49;752] THAT MEANS WORKING WITH THE
[000:17:50;419] DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THE
[000:17:51;086] DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,
[000:17:51;620] TRANSPORTATION, HHS, A NUMBER OF
[000:17:52;588] THINGS TO CREATE VIBRANT
[000:17:54;356] COMMUNITIES.
[000:17:55;758] >> YOU MENTIONED THAT 8 - 1 WHEN
[000:17:58;460] YOU LOOK AT THE PRIVATE PUBLIC
[000:18:03;465] PARTNERSHIP AND HOW FAR PUBLIC
[000:18:04;166] DOLLARS WOULD GO.
[000:18:04;666] I IMAGINE THAT'S IMPORTANT.
[000:18:06;068] PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE BUDGET
[000:18:06;869] PROPOSAL WOULD CUT THE
[000:18:08;570] DEPARTMENT AT HUD BY MORE THAN
[000:18:11;073] 13%.
[000:18:13;308] WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO HAVING
[000:18:14;309] TO DO THE JOB ON LESS MONEY FOR
[000:18:15;611] YOUR DEPARTMENT?
[000:18:20;048] >> WE ARE LOOKING AT
[000:18:21;116] EFFICIENCIES.
[000:18:22;251] HOW DO WE CARVE OUT AND GET THE
[000:18:25;554] BANK FOR OUR BUCK.
[000:18:31;493] ALSO, THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT
[000:18:34;062] INTERESTED IN HURTING PEOPLE AND
[000:18:34;897] PUTTING PEOPLE OUT ON THE
[000:18:35;531] STREET.
[000:18:36;532] WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING
[000:18:39;735] SURE THAT WE ARE EFFICIENT AND
[000:18:41;136] THAT WE ARE COMPASSIONATE, NOT
[000:18:42;337] ONLY TO THE PEOPLE TODAY BUT THE
[000:18:43;772] PEOPLE TOMORROW.
[000:18:45;674] EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN OWES
[000:18:51;713] $60000 IN TERMS OF OUR NATIONAL
[000:18:53;215] DEBT.
[000:18:53;715] WE HAVE TO START LOOKING OUT FOR
[000:18:54;917] THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING AFTER
[000:18:55;651] US.
[000:18:56;718] WE CANNOT JUST IGNORE THAT.
[000:18:59;154] MANY NATIONS HAVE TRIED THAT IN
[000:19:01;523] THE PAST AND IT HAS BEEN
[000:19:05;928] DETRIMENTAL TO THEM.
[000:19:06;628] >> THE VIDEO WE SHOWED AT THE
[000:19:07;563] TOP WAS YOU AND YOUR FORMER HOME
[000:19:08;931] OF DETROIT.
[000:19:09;631] WE KNOW THE STATE OF MICHIGAN
[000:19:11;400] HOW MUCH THEY HAVE SUFFERED BOTH
[000:19:13;435] ECONOMICALLY AND EVEN IN TERMS
[000:19:14;136] OF WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT WITH
[000:19:15;270] THE DRINKING WATER AND SOME OF
[000:19:18;106] THE PROBLEMS THERE.
[000:19:20;742] OVER YEARS AND DECADES OF
[000:19:25;247] LIBERAL LEADERSHIP AND DEMOCRATS
[000:19:28;283] IN OFFICE.
[000:19:28;750] POLITICS COME UP IN YOUR
[000:19:30;185] LISTENING TO HER?
[000:19:34;923] >> NOT VERY MUCH.
[000:19:35;557] I HAVE DEALT WITH BOTH
[000:19:36;124] REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
[000:19:36;792] THE ISSUES THAT FACE US ARE NOT
[000:19:37;526] REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT ISSUES.
[000:19:38;594] WE HAVE 3 - 4 TIMES THE NUMBER
[000:19:42;464] OF PEOPLE WHO NEED AFFORDABLE
[000:19:43;165] HOUSING THE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE.
[000:19:44;867] WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION,
[000:19:48;570] BABY BOOMERS WHO NEED TO RETIRE
[000:19:50;272] BUT DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO
[000:19:52;507] DO SO BECAUSE THEIR 4O1 KAYS
[000:19:54;276] HAVE NOT DONE MUCH IN THE PAST
[000:19:55;611] TEN YEARS.
[000:19:57;980] WE HAVE GOT TO BE CREATIVE AND
[000:19:59;448] THINK OUT-OF-THE-BOX IN ORDER TO
[000:20:03;018] MAINTAIN A REASONABLE LIFESTYLE
[000:20:04;553] FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.
[000:20:11;727] THIS CERTAINLY CANNOT BE A PART
[000:20:12;461] OF SOMETHING.
[000:20:12;961] >> REAL QUICK, BEFORE I LET YOU
[000:20:13;695] GO YOU SEEM TO BE RIGHT ON
[000:20:14;730] TARGET WITH THIS I KNOW YOU TO
[000:20:20;302] CRITICISM EARLY ON, BUT THIS IS
[000:20:21;036] IN YOUR WHEELHOUSE, YOU'VE GONE
[000:20:21;770] BACK TO THE URBAN AREAS.
[000:20:22;771] I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST
[000:20:24;072] WORD.
[000:20:24;539] >> OKAY.
[000:20:25;874] THE LAST WORD IS THAT WE ONLY
[000:20:29;945] HAVE 330 MILLI- PEOPLE IN
[000:20:32;347] AMERICA.
[000:20:32;681] ONE QUARTER WHAT CHINA HAS, ONE
[000:20:35;117] QUARTER OF WHAT INDIA HAS.
[000:20:36;351] WE HAVE GOT TO DEVELOP ALL OF
[000:20:37;286] OUR PEOPLE IF WE ARE GOING TO
[000:20:38;887] COMPETE IN THE FUTURE.
[000:20:40;923] THAT MEANS TAKING A HOLISTIC
[000:20:41;590] APPROACH.
[000:20:42;858] >> NEXT, WHERE YOU GOING?
[000:20:47;296] >> HEADING OFF TO MIAMI.
[000:20:48;997] I WILL BE GOING THERE THIS WEEK.
[000:20:50;732] I'M SURE WE'LL SEE A LOT OF
[000:20:51;400] GREAT THINGS THERE.
[000:20:52;801] WERE LOOKING NOT ONLY THE
[000:20:56;505] POSITIVE THINGS BUT THE NEGATIVE
[000:20:57;239] THINGS BECAUSE WE CAN LEARN FROM
[000:20:57;973] BOTH.
[000:20:59;074] >> YOU HEARD IT HERE HERE FIRST.
[000:21:03;345] THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR
[000:21:05;447] CARSON.

[000:21:14;690] WHY POLICE SAY HE WAS ALREADY
[000:21:15;390] BEING SOUGHT.
[000:21:15;824] HE WAS ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH
[000:21:16;491] THEIR FINGERS.
[000:21:20;228] Make sure the germs they
[000:21:20;228] bring home don't stick around.
[000:21:22;564] Use Clorox
[000:21:22;564] disinfecting products.
[000:21:25;334] Because no one kills germs
[000:21:25;334] better than Clorox.
[000:21:30;639] I USE WHAT'S
[000:21:30;639] ALREADY INSIDE ME
[000:21:32;574] TO REACH MY GOALS.
[000:21:35;444] SO I LIKED WHEN
[000:21:35;444] MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
[000:21:36;778] THAT I MAY REACH
[000:21:36;778] MY BLOOD SUGAR

[000:21:47;589] TRULICITY IS
[000:21:47;589] NOT INSULIN.
[000:21:49;558] IT HELPS ACTIVATE
[000:21:49;558] MY BODY TO DO WHAT
[000:21:49;558] IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO
[000:21:52;627] RELEASE ITS
[000:21:52;627] OWN INSULIN.
[000:21:54;162] TRULICITY RESPONDS WHEN
[000:21:54;162] MY BLOOD SUGAR RISES.
[000:21:57;232] I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
[000:21:57;232] AND IT WORKS 24/7.
[000:22:00;802] IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN.
[000:22:02;604] AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
[000:22:02;604] A LITTLE WEIGHT.
[000:22:04;706] TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY

[000:22:13;515] TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.
[000:22:14;883] IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST

[000:22:17;486] TYPE 1 DIABETES
[000:22:19;454] OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.
[000:22:21;156] DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY

[000:22:44;212] SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN
[000:22:47;115] INCREASES YOUR RISK
[000:22:47;115] FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

[000:22:52;921] AND INDIGESTION.
[000:22:54;956] SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN

[000:25:32;214] >> NOW THAT THE SENATE HAS
[000:25:33;048] CONFIRMED NEIL GORSUCH TO BE THE
[000:25:33;782] NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
[000:25:34;416] REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE
[000:25:35;250] WAITING TO SEE HOW GORSUCH VOTES
[000:25:37;652] ON THE BET.
[000:25:38;286] HOW CLOSELY HE FALLS IN LINE
[000:25:39;554] WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SUMMI IDEA.
[000:25:46;728] >> THE NOMINATION OF NEIL M
[000:25:47;395] GORSUCH OF COLORADO TO BE AN
[000:25:48;063] ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME

[000:25:59;140] NUMBER OF CASES IN THE FALL
[000:25:59;808] TERM.
[000:26:00;108] THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE OF
[000:26:01;476] MONTHS IN THE CURRENT TERM FOR
[000:26:03;411] THE COURT WHICH ENDS IN JUNE.
[000:26:06;147] HE FEELS THE CONSERVATIVE SEAT
[000:26:10;585] LEFT VACANT BY THE LATE JUSTICE
[000:26:14;256] ANTONIN SCALIA.
[000:26:15;056] HIS NEW VOICE COULD BE THE

[000:26:16;157] UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE
[000:26:16;791] HIGHEST COURT WHETHER OR NOT TO

[000:26:35;243] GETTING GORSUCH ON THE BENCH HAS
[000:26:35;977] NOT BEEN EASY FOR THE PRESIDENT
[000:26:37;512] OR GOP LEADERS.
[000:26:40;615] AFTER BETTER CONFIRMATION BATTLE
[000:26:41;349] IN THE SENATE WHICH PRONTO
[000:26:42;917] REPUBLICANS TO USE THE NUCLEAR

[000:26:54;129] >> BOTH DEMOCRATS AND
[000:26:54;696] REPUBLICANS HAVE BLAME.
[000:26:55;297] BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
[000:26:55;997] HAVE HANDLED THINGS IN A WAY
[000:26:56;698] THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE.
[000:27:00;402] WE SHOULD CHANGE OUR RULES BY
[000:27:01;102] BIPARTISAN.

[000:27:21;423] WE'LL BRING A COMPLETE COVERAGE
[000:27:22;157] OF THE CEREMONY, AND WE WILL LET
[000:27:23;858] YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST HEARD
[000:27:25;427] LAUREN TALKING ABOUT, THE
[000:27:26;861] PRIVATE ONE AS WELL.
[000:27:34;102] THE COUNTRY WILL BE ABLE TO
[000:27:34;769] WATCH THAT PLAY OUT THAT IS
[000:27:35;437] PUBLIC.
[000:27:35;770] STAY WITH THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL
[000:27:36;471] AT 9:00 A.M. EASTERN.
[000:27:37;038] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION
[000:27:37;772] ON FORM POLICY.
[000:27:42;010] WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT
[000:27:42;711] THIS HOUR.
[000:27:43;078] SCREEN LEFT, THE AIRSTRIKE ON
[000:27:44;646] THE SYRIAN AIRBASE IN RESPONSE
[000:27:46;014] TO THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.
[000:27:52;987] THE RIGHT SCREEN, THE AIRCRAFT
[000:27:53;688] CARRIER, THE PINNACLE OF
[000:27:54;989] AMERICAN FORCE PROJECTION,
[000:27:57;325] 100,000 TONS OF DIPLOMACY AS WE
[000:27:59;060] HAVE HEARD AN EARLIER GUEST
[000:28:01;229] STAY.
[000:28:06;968] IT IS STEAMING TOWARD THE KOREAN
[000:28:07;702] PENINSULA TO SEND A STRONG
[000:28:08;336] MESSAGE.
[000:28:08;670] WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS
[000:28:09;371] FOR THE PRESIDENT, THE NATION,
[000:28:10;171] AND WHAT COMES NEXT.
[000:28:12;173] CONGRESSMAN SCOTT TAYLOR FROM
[000:28:13;875] VIRGINIA IS COMING UP NEXT.
[000:28:20;515] I was given warfarin
[000:28:20;515] in the hospital,
[000:28:22;317] but wondered, was this the
[000:28:22;317] best treatment for me?
[000:28:24;953] So I asked my doctor.
[000:28:26;287] And he recommended ELIQUIS.
[000:28:28;056] ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:28:28;056] and PE blood clots
[000:28:30;792] and reduces the risk of
[000:28:30;792] them happening again.
[000:28:33;361] Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:28:33;361] and PE blood clots.
[000:28:36;398] ELIQUIS also had
[000:28:37;699] significantly
[000:28:37;699] less major
[000:28:37;699] bleeding
[000:28:39;601] than the
[000:28:39;601] standard
[000:28:39;601] treatment.
[000:28:41;169] Both made me
[000:28:41;169] turn around my
[000:28:41;169] thinking.
[000:28:43;638] Don't stop ELIQUIS
[000:28:43;638] unless your doctor tells you to.
[000:28:45;707] ELIQUIS can cause serious and
[000:28:45;707] in rare cases fatal bleeding.
[000:28:48;910] Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
[000:28:48;910] an artificial heart valve
[000:28:51;112] or abnormal bleeding.
[000:28:52;580] If you had a spinal injection
[000:28:52;580] while on ELIQUIS
[000:28:54;649] call your doctor right away
[000:28:55;850] if you have tingling,
[000:28:55;850] numbness, or muscle weakness.
[000:28:57;952] While taking ELIQUIS,
[000:28:57;952] you may bruise more easily
[000:29:00;488] ...and it may take longer
[000:29:00;488] than usual for bleeding to stop.
[000:29:02;857] Seek immediate medical care
[000:29:02;857] for sudden signs of bleeding,
[000:29:05;193] like unusual bruising.
[000:29:06;528] ELIQUIS may increase
[000:29:06;528] your bleeding risk
[000:29:08;496] if you take
[000:29:08;496] certain medicines.
[000:29:09;731] Tell your doctor
[000:29:09;731] about all planned
[000:29:11;733] medical or dental
[000:29:11;733] procedures.
[000:29:13;201] ELIQUIS treats
[000:29:13;201] DVT and PE
[000:29:13;201] blood clots.
[000:29:16;137] Plus had
[000:29:16;137] less major
[000:29:16;137] bleeding.
[000:29:18;206] Both made ELIQUIS
[000:29:18;206] the right treatment for me.
[000:29:20;809] Ask your doctor if switching
[000:29:20;809] to ELIQUIS is right for you.
[000:29:25;747] Various: (Shouting) Heigh!

[000:29:31;920] Woman:
[000:29:31;920] On the Gulf Coast,
[000:29:32;987] new ExxonMobil projects
[000:29:34;355] are expected to create
[000:29:34;355] over 45,000 jobs.
[000:29:37;392] And each job created
[000:29:37;392] by the energy industry
[000:29:39;928] supports two others
[000:29:39;928] in the community.
[000:29:41;963] Altogether,
[000:29:43;164] the industry supports over
[000:29:43;164] 9 million jobs nationwide.
[000:29:46;634] These are jobs that natural
[000:29:46;634] gas is helping make happen,
[000:29:49;437] all while reducing
[000:29:49;437] America's emissions.

[000:31:50;925] >> Harris: THE U.S. MISSILE
[000:31:51;659] STRIKES IN SYRIA ARE RAISING
[000:31:53;361] QUESTIONS AMONG LAWMAKERS IN
[000:31:55;797] WASHINGTON OVER WHAT ROLE WE
[000:31:56;664] SHOULD PLAY IN THE SIX YEARS
[000:31:57;966] CIVIL WAR GOING FORWARD.
[000:32:01;703] ONE SURVIVOR OF THE CHEMICAL
[000:32:02;570] ATTACK THAT SPURRED THAT
[000:32:03;171] OPERATION SAID PEOPLE SHOULD
[000:32:04;172] FORGET THE POLITICS.
[000:32:09;611] THAT MAN LOST HIS WIFE.
[000:32:10;211] YOU PROBABLY SEEN THE PICTURE
[000:32:10;912] GONE VIRAL OF HIM HOLDING HIS
[000:32:12;380] TWIN BABIES.
[000:32:13;214] THE ASSAD REGIME TOOK THEM OUT
[000:32:14;582] WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:32:18;519] HE SAID THE U.S. SHOULD DO MORE
[000:32:19;253] NOW, NOT JUST ONE STRIKE.
[000:32:20;388] NOT ALL SYRIANS AGREE.
[000:32:22;890] ENGINEMEN HALL HAS THE STORY
[000:32:23;558] FROM TURKEY.
[000:32:24;993] >> IT WAS WATCHING VIDEOS OF
[000:32:26;628] THIS HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK
[000:32:27;929] WHICH DROVE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO
[000:32:29;364] INTERVENE.
[000:32:30;732] WHILE SPEAKING TODAY PEOPLE ARE
[000:32:34;636] DIVIDED UP IT IS EASY TO
[000:32:39;073] UNDERSTAND WHAT DROVE HIM.
[000:32:39;707] IT WAS ALSO AN INCREDIBLY
[000:32:40;341] SOBERING MOMENT.
[000:32:41;709] AMONG THE FAMILIES WE SPOKE TO
[000:32:48;549] WAS ABDUL, HE HAS BECOME THE
[000:32:49;217] FACE OF THE TRAGEDY.
[000:32:49;751] HE WAS REUNITED WITH FAMILY
[000:32:50;418] MEMBERS WHO DID SURVIVE, THOUGH
[000:32:51;619] HE LOST 22.
[000:32:55;690] HE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS
[000:32:56;424] HE SAW.
[000:32:56;824] >> AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE, THE
[000:32:57;925] WHOLE FAMILY WAS DEAD.
[000:32:59;293] GROWN-UPS, DEAD.
[000:33:00;628] FAMILY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
[000:33:03;264] MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, MY
[000:33:05;266] BROTHER, HIS WIFE, THEIR
[000:33:08;269] CHILDREN, MY NIECES, ALL OF THEM
[000:33:23;818] DEAD.
[000:33:24;452] AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I FAINTED.
[000:33:25;253] >> AMONG THE DEAD, HIS 11 MONTH
[000:33:25;987] OLD TWINS.
[000:33:26;354] HE BURIED THEM IN HIS WIFE WITH
[000:33:27;121] HIS OWN HANDS, BUT CANNOT BEAR
[000:33:27;822] TO PUT THEM IN THE GROUND,
[000:33:28;523] GRIPPING THEM TILL THE BITTER
[000:33:29;223] END.
[000:33:29;490] HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT THE
[000:33:30;091] AMERICAN STRIKES.
[000:33:30;692] >> I WANT TO TELL PRESIDENT
[000:33:31;359] TRUMP, THE FIRST STRIKE WAS
[000:33:32;760] GOOD, IT SAVED US.
[000:33:44;313] BUT JUST A FEW HOURS LATER THE
[000:33:45;014] AIRBAGS CONTINUED WORKING, IT'S
[000:33:45;748] LIKE A CHALLENGE FROM ASSAD.
[000:33:46;616] I CAN STILL ATTACK FROM THE SAME
[000:33:47;350] BASE YOU ATTACKED.
[000:33:48;618] >> NOT ONLY A PLANE STILL TAKING
[000:34:00;897] OFF FROM THE AIRBASE, THERE
[000:34:01;564] STILL BOMBING THE TOWN.
[000:34:02;165] APPARENTLY ADD A GREATER PACE
[000:34:02;865] THAN BEFORE, WITH NOBODY TO STOP
[000:34:03;599] THEM.
[000:34:03;966] >> ASSAD IS A CRIMINAL.
[000:34:04;567] HE IS KILLING NOT ONLY HUMAN
[000:34:05;234] BEINGS AND CHILDREN, BUT ANIMALS
[000:34:05;968] AS IF THEY WERE THE SAME.
[000:34:06;602] HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL.
[000:34:07;236] >> THE FEELING IS ONE OF
[000:34:08;004] GRATITUDE TOWARD THE U.S.
[000:34:10;039] THE STRIKES GIVE THE SYRIAN BITE
[000:34:10;973] AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND
[000:34:12;675] OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE.
[000:34:16;179] BUT THE LESS THEY HAVE DONE TO
[000:34:17;914] BACK UP THE ASSAD REGIME, HE
[000:34:21;651] WILL CONTINUE TO KILL HIS PEOPLE
[000:34:22;585] LIKE HE HAS DONE FOR THE LAST
[000:34:24;053] SIX YEARS.
[000:34:26;456] >> Harris: MY NEXT GUEST,
[000:34:45;541] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO
[000:34:46;242] LAUNCH THE MISSILE STRIKE ON
[000:34:46;909] SYRIA.
[000:34:47;210] HE OPPOSES THE LEGAL BASIS ON
[000:34:47;910] WHICH YOU ORDER THAT MISSION.
[000:34:48;611] VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN,
[000:34:49;345] SCOTT TAYLOR IS A MEMBER OF THE
[000:34:50;079] HOUSE APPROPRIATION ON HOMELAND
[000:34:50;813] SECURITY.
[000:34:51;180] THE U.S. NAVY SEAL, HE HAS
[000:34:51;814] SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN THAT WAY.
[000:34:52;548] THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
[000:34:54;617] I WANT TO START WITH WHERE YOU
[000:34:55;318] ARE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE
[000:34:56;018] PRESIDENT AND WHY YOU SAY
[000:34:56;719] CONGRESS NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY
[000:34:58;054] GET INVOLVED NOW?
[000:35:00;022] >> LET'S BE CLEAR.
[000:35:01;591] OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY
[000:35:11;100] SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND
[000:35:11;767] FLEXIBILITY AS A PRESIDENT THAT
[000:35:12;668] HE OR SHE SEE SOMETHING AS A
[000:35:13;336] THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:35:14;070] TOWARD TROOPS AND INTEREST THEY
[000:35:15;471] HAVE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO
[000:35:16;139] ASK.
[000:35:17;173] WITH THAT BEING SAID, CONGRESS
[000:35:19;008] DECLARES WAR OR CREATE STATUTORY
[000:35:21;511] LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR USE OF
[000:35:23;379] FORCE.
[000:35:28;484] THIS PRESIDENT, AND THE PREVIOUS
[000:35:29;218] PRESIDENT, TWO ADMINISTRATIONS
[000:35:29;919] OPERATING OFF USE OF MILITARY
[000:35:30;620] FORCE FROM 16 YEARS AGO FROM A
[000:35:32;021] THIRD ADMINISTRATION.
[000:35:37;860] CONGRESS DOES NEED TO LEAD AND
[000:35:38;561] THAT NEED TO HAVE A VOICE IN
[000:35:39;228] THIS.
[000:35:40;396] I'VE SEEN MANY CONGRESSMEN AND
[000:35:44;534] WOMEN ON NATIONAL NEWS IN THE
[000:35:46;736] PAST FEW DAYS BECAUSE OF THE
[000:35:47;403] STRIKE.
[000:35:47;970] THE BEST THING WE CAN DO AS
[000:35:48;638] LEADERS IN CONGRESS IS TO TAKE
[000:35:49;338] IT UP IN DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT
[000:35:50;039] IT.
[000:35:50;306] THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE THE
[000:35:51;374] ABILITY TO ACT.
[000:35:52;542] HE HAS THAT TIME AND FLEXIBILITY
[000:35:54;043] TO DO SO.
[000:36:01;884] UNDER THE UN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:36:02;785] TREATY, YOU CANNOT PRODUCE,
[000:36:03;452] DEVELOP, OR USE CHEMICAL
[000:36:04;053] WEAPONS, I DO SUPPORT THE
[000:36:05;388] PRESIDENT AND HIS ACTION.
[000:36:06;022] I THINK THE WORLD WAS WATCHING
[000:36:07;690] WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND I SUPPORT
[000:36:11;827] HIS DECISION TO TAKE ACTION AND
[000:36:24;574] SAY THAT WILL NOT STAND.
[000:36:25;541] >> Harris: PEOPLE HERE YOU AND I
[000:36:26;275] CAN SEE EYES GLAZING OVER.
[000:36:26;909] CONGRESS CUT SEEM TO AGREE ON
[000:36:27;610] ANYTHING.
[000:36:27;977] I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,
[000:36:28;711] THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU
[000:36:29;445] ARE WORKING OFF A 16-YEAR-OLD
[000:36:30;146] AUTHORIZATION OF MILITARY FORCE
[000:36:30;880] TO GET THIS DONE.
[000:36:31;647] DO YOU REALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE
[000:36:34;884] THAT IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER YOU
[000:36:35;618] CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GIVE THE
[000:36:36;986] PRESIDENT SUPPORT HE NEEDS?
[000:36:41;857] >> THAT THE NEXT ONE QUESTION.
[000:36:42;558] BECAUSE CONGRESS IS SLOW TO
[000:36:43;226] DEBATE AND THERE'S DIVERGING
[000:36:43;893] INTEREST THERE, THERE THE
[000:36:45;127] PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVE.
[000:36:48;097] THAT'S WHEN EXECUTIVE HAS
[000:36:48;731] FLEXIBILITY IN TIME TO TAKE
[000:36:50;433] ACTION IF THEY DEEM FIT.
[000:36:53;002] BUT, LEADERS MUST ACT.
[000:36:53;569] LEADERS MUST LEAVE.
[000:36:54;971] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE
[000:36:56;372] A SAY IN USE OF MILITARY FORCE
[000:36:57;673] AROUND THE WORLD.
[000:37:01;043] THAT BEING SAID, HOW TO HAVE A
[000:37:01;744] SAY?
[000:37:03;145] TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN

[000:37:14;890] BIPARTISAN AND SAY WHAT WERE
[000:37:15;558] GOING TO DO.
[000:37:16;158] IF WERE GOING TO AUTHORIZE THE

[000:37:21;230] THAT HAS BEEN LINGERING, THAT IS
[000:37:25;167] OUR COMPLETE MISSION.
[000:37:28;037] AS A FORMER NAVY SEAL YOU KNOW
[000:37:28;738] WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENDGAME IT
[000:37:29;405] SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES AND KEEPS
[000:37:30;206] OUR VISION CRISP.
[000:37:30;706] IT KEEPS THINGS FROM VEERING UP
[000:37:32;208] AND BECOMING OTHER THINGS.
[000:37:34;176] WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE?
[000:37:35;811] TO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS?
[000:37:42;818] >> THAT'S NEXT LINE POINT.
[000:37:43;452] WERE NOT GOOD TO BE TALKING
[000:37:44;120] ABOUT TACTICS, STRATEGY -WISE
[000:37:45;454] IT'S IMPORTANT.
[000:37:49;125] THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD COME
[000:37:50;126] TO CONGRESS AND TALK ABOUT THE
[000:37:51;427] INTELLIGENCE, THE GOALS, THE END
[000:37:52;428] STATE.
[000:37:52;862] I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYRIA, IT'S
[000:37:55;164] A POWDER CAKE, ANYTHING THAT I'M
[000:37:57;199] AWARE OF SINCE WORLD WAR II YOU
[000:38:02;071] HAVE TURKEY, US, ISRAEL, RUSSIA,
[000:38:03;172] OTHERS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL.
[000:38:08;377] IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
[000:38:09;078] I RAN AS WELL, HEZBOLLAH.
[000:38:09;779] YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL
[000:38:11;080] FOR FLASHPOINT.
[000:38:13;215] AND NOT ENOUGH TO COMPLEXION A
[000:38:14;216] POTENTIALLY GREATER CONFLICT.
[000:38:15;551] IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT
[000:38:22;024] PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ENDGAME
[000:38:22;958] AND THE STRATEGY AND THE GOAL OF
[000:38:24;427] THE UNITED STATES.
[000:38:30;933] >> Harris: WE ARE WAITING TO
[000:38:31;600] HEAR THAT IS GOING TO BE.

[000:38:32;935] WHO LOST HIS TWINS, AMERICA DO
[000:38:33;836] MORE THAN ONE STRIKE.
[000:38:34;403] ARE YOU CONCERNED THE EMOTION
[000:38:35;771] BASED UPON THE NEED FOR POLICY?
[000:38:37;573] HOW DO YOU KEEP THEM SEPARATE?
[000:38:42;745] >> IT IS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND
[000:38:43;479] WATCHING THE IMAGES AND
[000:38:44;480] LISTENING TO THAT FAMILY.
[000:38:46;215] IT DOES TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.
[000:38:49;118] IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LEADERS TO
[000:38:50;820] BE ABLE TO SEE CLARITY THROUGH
[000:38:51;520] CHAOS.
[000:38:52;355] UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGY AND
[000:38:53;556] THE GOALS ARE.
[000:38:56;158] WE CANNOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM
[000:38:57;460] BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVEN
[000:39:00;429] SYRIA SIGNED ONTO THE CHEMICAL
[000:39:02;164] WEAPONS CONVENTION AS WELL.
[000:39:03;299] IT'S IMPORTANT THE WORLD'S LEAD
[000:39:04;934] AND THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
[000:39:12;441] CANNOT AND WILL NOT STAND.
[000:39:13;075] THE PRESIDENT TOOK DECISIVE
[000:39:13;743] ACTION AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY
[000:39:14;477] DIFFERENT PRESIDENT THAN THE
[000:39:15;144] LAST ONE.
[000:39:15;711] WHEN YOU HAVE DIPLOMACY THAT THE
[000:39:20;216] WORLD AGREES WITH YOU HAVE TO
[000:39:21;884] BACK IT UP WITH FORCE.
[000:39:23;986] THAT'S IMPORTANT.
[000:39:36;399] >> Harris: YOU SAY YOU ARE READY
[000:39:37;133] TO STEP UP AND BEGIN THAT
[000:39:37;767] LEADING IN CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE
[000:39:38;501] YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT
[000:39:39;201] HE NEEDS.
[000:39:39;568] WHEN YOU COME BACK, I WANT TO
[000:39:40;269] TALK ABOUT VETERANS AFFAIRS.
[000:39:40;936] YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS
[000:39:41;604] DONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
[000:39:42;371] WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT
[000:39:43;105] PART OF DOMESTIC POLICY.
[000:39:43;706] WE'LL BRING YOU BACK.

[000:44:04;533] SPEAK OUT OF AGAINST PRESIDENT
[000:44:08;037] TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY.
[000:44:08;737] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING

[000:44:17;513] HALTED AND THE DEMONSTRATION.
[000:44:18;781] THEY EXPECT ABOUT 100,000
[000:44:20;749] PEOPLE.
[000:44:22;184] THEY DID THAT BEFORE IN 2006, I
[000:44:23;419] THINK IT WAS.
[000:44:33;629] BACK TO WASHINGTON WHERE
[000:44:34;229] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LOOKING TO
[000:44:35;164] MOVE ON WITH HIS DOMESTIC
[000:44:35;798] AGENDA.
[000:44:36;131] AFTER FAILING TO REPEAL OBAMA
[000:44:36;832] CARE, HE AND CONGRESS ARE
[000:44:37;466] GEARING UP TO TACKLE TAX REFORM.
[000:44:38;200] EARLY SIGNS INDICATE A TOUGH
[000:44:38;867] FIGHT AHEAD.
[000:44:44;073] WITH EVEN REPUBLICANS
[000:44:44;907] DISAGREEING OVER KEY PARTS OF A
[000:44:45;641] PROPOSED PLAN.
[000:44:46;075] CAN PRESIDENT TRUMP GET
[000:44:47;109] DEMOCRATS ON HIS SIDE?
[000:44:49;778] MY NEXT GUEST HAS EXPERIENCE
[000:44:50;446] WORKING WITH THE OTHER SIDE OF
[000:44:52;014] THE POLITICAL AISLE FROM THE

[000:45:00;489] HE SPENT SIX YEARS WITH
[000:45:01;190] PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON IN THE
[000:45:01;890] 1990s, DOUG SHOWING.
[000:45:02;424] FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL CLINTON
[000:45:03;125] AND A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND
[000:45:04;293] FRIEND, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:45:04;893] YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ABOUT
[000:45:06;428] GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.
[000:45:09;331] PRESIDENT CLINTON PROBABLY
[000:45:10;733] TEACHES A FEW THINGS ABOUT
[000:45:13;435] DEALING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE,
[000:45:14;136] RIGHT?
[000:45:15;237] HE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT
[000:45:18;474] CONGRESSES, THE FIRST ALL
[000:45:19;341] DEMOCRAT, THE NEXT THREE FOR THE
[000:45:20;776] REST OF HIS PRESIDENCIES HE WAS
[000:45:26;849] STACKED AGAINST REPUBLICANS.
[000:45:27;516] WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?
[000:45:28;150] >> BIPARTISANSHIP.
[000:45:28;984] WHAT WAS I CALL TRIANGULATION.
[000:45:30;452] CANDIDLY, WITH DONALD TRUMP
[000:45:31;987] FIGHTING WITH REPUBLICANS, HE
[000:45:34;757] HAS TO IF HE IS GOING TO
[000:45:36;158] SUCCEED, BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF
[000:45:41;463] LAST WEEK'S RAID AND BEGIN
[000:45:43;298] BIPARTISAN OUTREACH TO THE
[000:45:44;933] DEMOCRATS.
[000:45:45;367] >> Harris: LAST WEEK'S RAID?
[000:45:46;635] WHAT YOU MEAN?
[000:45:48;771] >> THE ATTACK ON SYRIA FOLLOWI
[000:46:01;450] FOLLOWING.
[000:46:01;884] >> BECAUSE HE HAS BIPARTISAN
[000:46:02;551] SUPPORT ON THAT.
[000:46:03;085] >> YES, NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK
[000:46:03;786] SCHUMER.
[000:46:04;119] NOW, GIVEN THE FACT THAT
[000:46:04;720] REPUBLICANS ON HEALTHCARE ARE
[000:46:05;420] DIVIDED BETWEEN THE FREEDOM
[000:46:06;088] CAUCUS, THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE
[000:46:06;789] REPUBLICANS AND MODERATES, HE
[000:46:14;630] REALLY HAS TO IF HE IS GOING TO
[000:46:15;364] SUCCEED.
[000:46:15;697] WHETHER IT BE A TAX REFORM,
[000:46:16;365] HEALTHCARE, OR INFRASTRUCTURE.
[000:46:17;132] >> Harris: LET'S STAY WITH TAX
[000:46:17;833] REFORM NOW.
[000:46:18;233] THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT PRESIDENT
[000:46:18;967] CLINT OUT WITH.
[000:46:19;434] I WANT TO DO APPLES AND APPLES.
[000:46:21;403] WHO DOES THE PRESIDENT REALLY
[000:46:23;071] NEED TO REACH OUT TO?
[000:46:25;674] >> THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT WE
[000:46:27;176] NEED TO DO CORPORATE TAX REFORM.
[000:46:29;244] WE NEED TO REPATRIATE THE MONEY
[000:46:32;881] THAT MAY BE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
[000:46:34;616] THAT ARE OVERSEAS AND LOWER THE
[000:46:38;720] RATE.
[000:46:39;855] >> Harris: AND HE HAS SAID THAT,
[000:46:40;589] HUNDRED DEMOCRATS FEEL?
[000:46:41;256] >> DEMOCRATS FEEL FINE ABOUT IT.
[000:46:41;990] THEY DON'T WANT TO REDUCE TAXES
[000:46:42;991] ON THE WEALTHY WHICH IS ONE OF
[000:46:46;228] HIS SIGNATURE INITIATIVES AS
[000:46:48;063] WELL.
[000:46:57;639] IF THEY CAN BE BROKEN UP AND BE
[000:46:58;373] DONE AS BITE-SIZE INITIATIVES
[000:46:59;074] MAYBE WE CAN GET SUCCESS.
[000:46:59;775] >> Harris: WHO TAKES A BITE IN
[000:47:00;475] TERMS EVERY PETRI MONEY
[000:47:01;076] OVERSEAS?
[000:47:01;577] >> IF THE PRESIDENT GOES TO
[000:47:03;378] CHUCK SCHUMER AND SAID CHUCK, WE
[000:47:08;650] HAVE TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON
[000:47:09;351] CORPORATE TAX REFORM BEFORE WE
[000:47:10;285] DO INDIVIDUAL TAX REFORM.
[000:47:12;054] JUST MAYBE WE CAN BEGIN TO GET
[000:47:14;223] SOME MOMENTUM TO GET OTHER
[000:47:18;727] ISSUES.
[000:47:19;795] >> Harris: CAN ASK YOU, WHY DOES
[000:47:20;529] THE PRESIDENT HAVE TO GO TO
[000:47:21;196] SENATOR SCHUMER?
[000:47:21;663] WHY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?
[000:47:22;598] AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
[000:47:23;765] YOU SAW WITH THE NOMINATION OF
[000:47:31;406] NEIL GORSUCH, YOU SAW THAT
[000:47:32;441] DEMOCRATS DO WANT TO PLAY BALL,
[000:47:33;175] THEY WANTED TO FILIBUSTER.
[000:47:34;476] WE BASICALLY GOT TWO SIDES NOT
[000:47:38;647] WINNING BUT WE GOT A SUPREME
[000:47:41;316] COURT JUSTICE WHICH I THOUGHT
[000:47:42;017] EVERYBODY AGREED ON UNTIL CAME
[000:47:42;718] TO POLITICS.
[000:47:43;118] THAT MIGHT BE GREAT FOR THE
[000:47:43;785] AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT AWFUL FOR
[000:47:44;486] CAPITOL HILL.
[000:47:45;220] MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS, WHY
[000:47:52;294] CAN'T DEMOCRATS OFFER SOMETHING?
[000:47:53;128] DOESN'T MAKE THEM LOOK WEAK?
[000:47:53;862] >> ONE WORD, POLITICS.
[000:47:54;863] THE DEMOCRATIC POLITIC PARTY ITS
[000:48:00;769] DIVIDED.
[000:48:01;103] THE ONLY THING THEY AGREE ON IS
[000:48:01;837] OPPOSING DONALD TRUMP.
[000:48:02;404] THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
[000:48:03;272] STRATEGY AS WE JUST SAW,
[000:48:04;673] DEMONSTRATIONS, RESISTANCE,
[000:48:06;842] OPPOSITION.
[000:48:08;977] THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WHO
[000:48:09;678] HASN'T SPOKEN TO SCHUMER IN
[000:48:10;779] ABOUT TWO MONTHS HAS TO REACH
[000:48:13;181] OUT.
[000:48:14;116] >> Harris: THIS ISN'T A WINNING
[000:48:14;850] STRATEGY FOR DEMOCRATS.
[000:48:15;684] YOU HAVE LOST 1000 SEATS BETWEEN
[000:48:18;186] HOUSES, PRESIDENCY, CONGRESS,
[000:48:19;788] IT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU.
[000:48:23;759] >> RIGHT.
[000:48:24;426] THAT IS THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATS
[000:48:25;827] HAVE COME TO THIS.
[000:48:30;465] ADVOCACY OF IDEAS.
[000:48:31;033] WE SOUGHT WAS SECRETARY CLINTON,
[000:48:32;968] WE SOUGHT IN STATE AFTER STATE,
[000:48:34;970] DOES NOT WORK.

[000:49:09;738] THE CAUSE THEY WERE WORKING ON.
[000:49:23;785] THEY HAVE SOME HISTORY TOGETHER.
[000:49:24;586] DOES THAT GIVE YOU SOME HOPE
[000:49:25;487] THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH SOME
[000:49:26;221] SORT OF BIPARTISANSHIP?
[000:49:26;888] >> IT DOES GIVE ME HOPE.
[000:49:27;489] SENATOR SCHUMER HAS MOVED AWAY
[000:49:28;190] FROM WHERE HE WAS IN DECEMBER
[000:49:28;890] WHICH WAS TO WORK WITH THE
