342
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,609
     But why go back there,     
   when you can stay home...    

343

    ...with Neulasta Onpro?     

344

    Strong chemo can put you    
 at risk of serious infection.  

345

         Neulasta helps         
     reduce infection risk      

346
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,017

347
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,585

349
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:19,290
   Neulasta reduced the risk    
 of infection from 17% to 1%...

00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,359
       ...a 94% decrease.

        Neulasta is for         
    certain cancer patients     

354

 receiving strong chemotherapy. 

355
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,868
      Do not take Neulasta

356

366
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,986
       serious, sometimes       
    fatal crises can occur.     

367
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,289
  The most common side effect   
    is bone and muscle ache.
