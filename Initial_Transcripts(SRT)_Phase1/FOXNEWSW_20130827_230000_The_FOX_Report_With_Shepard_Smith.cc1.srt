OFFICIAL TELLS FOX THAT ANY

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
STRIKE ON SYRIA IS LIKELY

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
TO LAST HOURS, NOT DAYS.

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
ACCORDING TO U.S. MILITARY

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
SOURCES, THERE ARE NO PLANS

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
IN THIS INITIAL MISSION SET

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
TO GO AFTER ASSAD'S

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CARRY
OUT A SURGICAL STRIKE ON

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS STORAGE

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
FACILITIES, ASSAD IS

90
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ESTIMATED TO HAVE

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
1,000 TONS OF THOSE

92
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
MATERIALS.
SUCH A STRIKE COULD UNLEASH

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THOSE CHEMICALS AND LEAD TO

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A LOT OF DEATH AND

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
DESTRUCTION, SOURCES SAY.

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
ANY PLANS TO SECURE ASSAD'S

97
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
REQUIRE SPECIAL OPERATIONS

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
AND BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
THAT IS NOT ON THE TABLE

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
RIGHT NOW.

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE U.S. IS PLANNING A

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
LIMITED STRIKE.

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
FOUR NAVY DESTROYERS IN

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
POSITION AND AT LEAST ONE

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINE.

107
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE BRITISH COULD PROVIDE

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
ANOTHER SUBMARINE IF

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
PARLIAMENT VOTE SLATED LATE

JENNIFER.

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
>> NOT BEFORE NATO MEETS

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
BRUSSELS TOMORROW AND WE'RE

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
TOLD IT WOULD OCCUR MOST

116
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
LIKELY THIS WEEKEND.

117
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
CHUCK HAGEL SPOKE TO HIS

118
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
BRITISH AND FRENCH COUNTER

120
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
BBC, HAGEL SAID U.S.

122
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WARSHIPS ARE STANDING BY

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
AWAITING ORDERS.

124
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
>> LET'S GET THE FACTS.

125
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
LET'S GET THE INTELLIGENCE.

126
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
AND THEN A DECISION WILL BE

127
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
MADE ON WHETHER ACTION

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
SHOULD BE TAKEN, IF ACTION

129
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
SHOULD BE TAKEN, WHAT

130
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
ACTION.
OR NO ACTION.

131
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
BUT IF YOU COME YOU ARE

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

133
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
>> WE ARE READY TO GO LIKE

134
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
THAT.
>> AGAIN THE PLAN AT THIS

135
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
POINT IS TO DETER ASSAD AND

136
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
DEGRADE HIS ABILITIES.

137
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
MULTIPLE PENTAGON SOURCES

138
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SUGGEST THE STRIKE WILL BE

139
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
LIMITED.

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
BILL?
>> Bill: THANK YOU

141
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000

SECRETARY HAGEL SAYS IF THE

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
U.S. MILITARY DOES TAKE

146
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ACTION, WE WILL NOT BE

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
GOING IT ALONE.

148
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
OUR TEAM FOX COVERAGE

149
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000

JONATHAN HUNT JOINS US.

152
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
IT LOOKS LIKE WE SEE A

153
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
COALITION FORMING.

154
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
>> FORMING AND IN PLACE.

155
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT

156
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
COALITION EVEN IF

157
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
UNOFFICIALLY MAY WELL BE

158
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
THE ARAB LEAGUE.

159
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THE ARAB LEAGUE MET TODAY

160
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
AND ISSUED A STATEMENT

161
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
BACKING U.S. CONCLUSIONS

162
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
OVER THE USE OF CHEMICAL

163
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
WEAPONS IN SYRIA LAST WEEK

164
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ON THE WESTERN FRONT BOTH

165
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE FRENCH AND BRITISH

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
PRIME MINISTERS TALKING

167
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
VERY MUCH ABOUT THE NEED

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
FOR MILITARY ACTION.

169
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BRITISH PRIME MINISTER

170
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
DAVID CAMMERON SAYS IT IS

171
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

172
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
BUT THERE MUST BE A CLEAR

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
GOAL.
LISTEN.

174
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
>> IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

175
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
SPECIFICALLY TO DETER AND

176
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
DEGRADE THE FUTURE USE OF

177
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
LET ME STRESS TO PEOPLE.

178
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
THIS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING

179
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
INVOLVED IN A MIDDLE

180
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
EASTERN WAR OR CHANGING OUR

181
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
STAFFS IN SYRIA OR GOING

182
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
FURTHER INTO THAT CONFLICT.

183
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH

184
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
THAT IT'S ABOUT CHEMICAL

185
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WEAPONS, THEIR USE IS

186
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
WRONG.
AND THE WORLD SHUNNED

187
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
DISTANT IDOLLY BY.

188
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO
PRIME MINISTER DAVID

189
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
CAMMERON TODAY.

190
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
ALSO WORTH NOTING BILL

LEAVES ON TIMING, THAT

198
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
COULD ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT,

199
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
BILL.
>> BUT SYRIA REMAINS

200
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000

SAYS DIPLOMACY IS STILL BY

227
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
FAR THE PREFERRED MEANS OF

228
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
ENDING THIS CRISIS.

229
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
LISTEN.

230
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
>> OUR FOCUS IS AWAY FROM

231
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
ANY MILITARY SOLUTION AND

232
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
TOWARDS A DIPLOMATIC

233
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
SOLUTION AND WE CONTINUE TO

TRY TO GET A DIPLOMATIC

236
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
SOLUTION GOING.

237
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
WE REMAIN COMBINED THAT
THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN FAR

238
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
TOO MUCH BLOOD SHED IN

239
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
SYRIA.
>> BUT, WITH THE RUSSIANS

240
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000

RESOLUTION, IT APPEARS

243
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
BILL, THAT THE U.S. HAS
ALREADY MADE THE DECISION

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
TO GO AHEAD WITH ANY

245
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
MILITARY OPTION UNDER THE

DAMASCUS.

256
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
BUT, SOME LAWMAKERS FROM

257
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
BOTH PARTIES CLAIM THAT IS

258
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
NOT ENOUGH.
THEY SAY CONGRESS HAS TO

259
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
APPROVE ANY MILITARY

260
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
IN THE MEANTIME THERE WERE

265
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
TEARS AND A LOT OF THEM

266
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000

SHOT HER BABY DEAD.

270
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
THAT MOTHER BROKE DOWN

271
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
SAYING THE SUSPECT DEMANDED

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
MONEY WHEN SHE TOLD HIM SHE

273
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DID NOT HAVE ANY MONEY.

274
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
SHE SAYS THE TEEN'S

275
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
ATTENTION TURNED IT TO HER

276
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
BABY, SOUND ASLEEP IN A

277
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
STROLLER.

278
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> HE ASKED ME IF I WANTED

279
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
HIM TO SHOOT MY BABY I SAID

280
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT MY BABY.

281
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
HE SHOT A WARNING SHOT TO

282
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
THE GROUND.

283
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I ASKED HIM WHY ARE YOU

284
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
DOING THIS?

285
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

286
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
IT FELT LIKE HE SHOT ME IN

287
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THE EAR.
>> WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

288
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
>> THEN HE SHOT ME IN THE

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
LEG.

290
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000

291
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
THAT?

292
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> HE WALKED OVER AND SHOT

293
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
MY BABY.

294
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
>> HE SHOT YOUR BABY?

295
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> YES.

296
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I TRIED TO STOP HIM I PUT

297
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
MY ARMS OVER MY BABY BUT HE

298
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
STILL SHOT HIM.

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
THIS WAS JUST HOURS AFTER

303
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE BABY'S MURDER.

304
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
THE MOTHER LIMPED AROUND

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
STATEMENTS SHE MADE TO THE

POLICE IN THE AFTERMATH.

326
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
EVEN SUGGESTING THAT SHE OR

THE CHILD'S FATHER, LUIS

328
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
SANTIAGO MAY HAVE HAD SOME

ILLNESS.

334

>> ONE THE MENTAL ILLNESSES

335
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
FROM WHICH YOU SUFFER IS

336
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
WHAT'S KNOWN AS BIPOLAR

337
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
DISORDER OR MANIC

338
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
DEPRESSION?
>> BIPOLAR ANOTHER IS MOST

339
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

340
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000

>> YES.

345
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AS THE JURY WATCHED THAT

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
MOMENTS AGO IN THE

COURTROOM GUFF SUGGESTED

353
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
THAT WEST WAS SUCH A BAD

354
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
MOTHER THAT THE MURDER OF

355
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
HER CHILD MAY HAVE BEEN

356
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
QUOTE MERCIFUL.

357
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
THE DEFENSE IS WALKING A

358
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
VERY FINE LINE HERE BETWEEN

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000

JON, THE SAME JURY WILL

INNOCENCE OF THE TEENAGE

368
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000

WHEN THE FORT HOOD SHOOTER

374

CARRIED OUT HIS MASSACRE,

375
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HE LEFT BODIES BEHIND AND

551
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
THEN THE PROSECUTION WILL

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
GIVE CLOSING ARGUMENTS, AND

553
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000

POLICE ARRESTED THE BROTHER

927
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
OF A MURDER VICTIM AFTER HE

928
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
TRIED TO BULL RUSSIA

929
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
SUSPECTED KILLER INSIDE OF
A COURTROOM.

930
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
WATCH HERE.

931
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
[SHOUTING]

932
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
>> Bill: THAT GUY RAN

933
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
TOWARD THE PRISONER BOXES

934
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
AS PROSECUTORS READ OUT THE

935
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
DETAILS OF THE APPARENT

936
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
HOMICIDE NEAR BOSTON.
THE SUSPECT ON SATURDAY

937
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
STABBED THE VICTIM ALMOST

938
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
70 TIMES AT A TRAILER PARK.

939
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
AUTHORITIES FOUND THE

940
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
SUSPECT' AT A NEARBY TRAIN

941
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
STATION WITH BLOODY CLOTHES

942
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
AND A CUT ON HIS HAND.

943
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
SOON AFTER THEY DISCOVERED

944
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
THE VICTIM INSIDE OF A

945
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
BLOOD SPATTERED MOBILE

946
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000

HIS BROTHER FACES CHARGES

947
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
OF DISRUPTING COURT

948
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
PROCEEDINGS AND RESISTING

949
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
ARREST.

950
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'M BILL HEMMER IN TONIGHT

951
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
FOR SHEPARD SMITH.

952
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
THIS IS "THE FOX REPORT."

953
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S

954
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
PREPOSTEROUS TO SUGGEST

955
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
THAT SYRIA WAS NOT BEHIND

956
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL

957
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
WEAPONS ATTACK.

958
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED

959
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
HUNDREDS THERE.

960
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
NOW THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS

961
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
THERE IS NO DOUBT THE U.S.

962
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
WILL RESPOND.

963
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN

964
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
AND HOW THE U.S. HAS

965
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
FOUR WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST

966
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
OF MILITARY.

967
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THE MILITARY IS READY TO

968
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
STRIKE WHENEVER PRESIDENT

969
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
OBAMA GIVES THAT ORDER.

970
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
BUT DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK

971
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
HAGEL STRESSING THE U.S.

972
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
WILL COORDINATE ANY ACTION

973
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL

974
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
PARTNERS.

975
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE

976
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HOUSE TONIGHT.
ED, GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

977
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WOULD THE THE

978
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
ADMINISTRATION GET

979
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY OR

980
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
IS THIS A DECISION THE

981
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE ON HIS

982
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
OWN.

983
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
>> GOOD EVENING, BILL.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT

984
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
IS GOING TO OPERATE

985
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
UNILATERALLY WITHOUT

986
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
CONGRESS.

987
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
INTERESTING BECAUSE VICE

988
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TODAY

989
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
ADDED HIS NAME TO THE

990
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
COURSE OF TOP OFFICIALS

991
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
SAYING THAT ASSAD AND SYRIA

992
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
NEEDS TO BE HELD

993
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
ACCOUNTABLE.

994
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THAT HE DID, IN FACT, USE

995
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

996
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
BUT SOME DEMOCRATS ON

997
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
CAPITOL HILL LIKE

998
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE,

999
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
THE ONLY MEMBER OF CONGRESS

1000
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
TO VOTE AGAINST THE WAR IN

1001
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
AFGHANISTAN DEMANDING A

1002
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
DEBATE AND VOTE IN

1003
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
CONGRESS.
OFFICIALS HERE AT THE WHITE

1004
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
HOUSE TELLING ME THAT IS

1005
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN BEFORE

1006
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS

1007
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
DECISION ON WHETHER TO MOVE

1008
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
FORWARD ON U.S. MILITARY

1009
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
ACTION.

1010
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
EVEN THOUGH IN THE 2008

1011
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
CAMPAIGN, HE SLAMMED THE

1012
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR

1013
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
ACTING UNILATERALLY, TAKE A

1014
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
LISTEN TO HOW I PRESSED JAY

1015
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
CARNEY ABOUT THIS AND

1016
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
LISTEN TO THE VICE

1017
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
PRESIDENT AS WELL.

1018
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
>> 2007, CANDIDATE OBAMA

1019
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
WAS AN ACTUAL OR IMMINENT

1020
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
THREAT TO THE NATION.

1021
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EXISTS

1022
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
RIGHT NOW AN ACTUAL OR

1023
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
IMMINENT THREAT TO THE

1024
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
UNITED STATES?

1025
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
>> I BELIEVE THAT

1026
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
ABSOLUTELY ALLOWING THE USE

1027
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A

1028
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
SIGNIFICANT STALE TO TAKE

1029
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
PLACE WITHOUT A RESPONSE

1030
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
WOULD PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

1031
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
THREAT TO UNITED STATES

1032
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST.

1033
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
>> NATIONAL SECURITY IS

1034
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
STRENGTHENED WHEN WE HOLD

1035
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO

1036
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL
NORMS.

1037
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
>> NOW THE WOWS JUST

1038
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
REVEALED IN THE LAST FEW

1039
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
MOMENTS AND THE PRESIDENT

1040
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH

1041
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER

1042
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
DAVID CAMMERON.
WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT

1043
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
THAT SECOND TIMED THEY HAVE

1044
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
SPOKEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW

1045
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
DAYS.
CONSULTING WITH ALLIES LIKE

1046
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
THAT SUGGEST WE ARE EDGING

1047
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
CLOSER TO U.S. MILITARY

1048
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
ACTION.

1049
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
BILL?

1050
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
>> Bill: WE ARE HEARING
FROM MANY PRODUCTION AT

1051
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
LEAST SOME OF THEM ANY WAY

1052
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD NOT

1053
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
BE SOME SORT OF SYMBOLIC

1054
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
HIT OR ATTACK, ED?

1055
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1056
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN

1057
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
MCCAIN SAYING TONIGHT LOOK,

1058
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
IF THERE IS GOING TO BE

1059
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
MILITARY ACTION, FINE.

1060
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO

1061
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
EXPLAIN THE MISSION TO THE

1062
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MCCAIN

1063
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
SAYING TONIGHT HE CAN'T

1064
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
JUST BE SOME SYMBOLIC MOVE

1065
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
TO BACK UP THE PRESIDENT'S

1066
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
RHETORIC FROM LAST SUMMER

1067
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
ABOUT A RED LINE ON

1068
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

1069
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
MCCAIN SAYING IT'S GOT TO

1070
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
BE A SERIOUS MILITARY

1071
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
ACTION THAT ACTUALLY

1072
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
DEGRADES ASSAD'S FORCES.

1073
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
TAKE LAFN.

1074
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
>> IF IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE

1075
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
LAUNCH SOME CREWS MISSILES

1076
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
AND DO THAT FOR THREE DAYS

1077
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
AND NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT

1078
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
EFFECT ON THE MOMENTUM ON

1079
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
THE BATTLEFIELD IT WILL

1080
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
HAVE AN UNHELPFUL EFFECT.

1081
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
IF WE DO IT RIGHT.

1082
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
AND WE GET THE MOMENTUM

1083
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
BACK ON SHIFTED TO OUR

1084
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
FREEDOM FIGHTERS --

1085
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
>> NOW, THE NEXT STEP IN

1086
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THE CASE FOR MILITARY

1087
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
ACTION WE'RE EXPECTING THE

1088
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
WHITE HOUSE AS EARLY AS

1089
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
TOMORROW TO DECLASSIFY SOME

1090
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY SAY

1091
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
WILL SHOW THAT ASSAD DID

1092
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

1093
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
THAT WILL MOVE THEM ONE

1094
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
STEP CLOSER TO ACTUAL

1095
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
MILITARY ACTION,  (A  8GBm&n;<@&E}lK

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
TOMORROW.

1099
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
ED HENRY THANKS FROM THE

1101
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
WILDFIRE ALERT NOW.

1102
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
NEARLY 4,000 FIREFIGHTERS

1103
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE
FIGHTING A MASSIVE BLAZE IN

1104
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
CALIFORNIA.
SO FAR THE RIM FIRE HAS

1105
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
SPREAD TO COVER AN AREA OF

1106
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
SOME 200 AND 80 SQUARE

1107
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
MILES.
IT'S THE STATE'S SEVENTH

1108
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
LARGEST FIRE ON RECORD.

1109
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000

1110
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
