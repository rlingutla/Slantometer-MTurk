[000:00:09;426] IT WILL COST ABOUT $42 MILLION
[000:00:10;960] WILL TAKE HALF A YEAR JUST TO
[000:00:11;861] PUT UP THE SCAFFOLDING.
[000:00:12;462] THE CLOCK WILL BE STOPPED FOR
[000:00:13;697] THREE MONTHS TO DO THE

[000:00:28;044] AS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS
[000:00:30;280] ADVISERS -- I'M JULIE BANDERAS
[000:00:34;484] AND THIS IS "THE FOX REPORT".
[000:00:38;121] AMERICAN TOMAHAWK MISSILES
[000:00:39;422] NEARLY LEVELING A SYRIAN AIRBASE
[000:00:42;459] HANGER.
[000:00:43;993] >> DEMOLISHED AND RUNWAYS DAMAGE
[000:00:46;362] THE SYRIAN FORCES ARE LASHING
[000:00:47;764] OUT AT REBEL TARGETS.
[000:00:51;601] WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE
[000:00:52;302] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THE
[000:00:53;470] GLOBAL REACTION POURS IN?
[000:00:55;038] THE MAN WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN
[000:00:57;607] LADEN SAYS DIPLOMACY MUST BE A
[000:01:00;243] FACTOR.
[000:01:02;645] >> THEIR PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON
[000:01:04;380] PLANNING THIS SINCE 2003.
[000:01:08;184] THE PLAN WILL BE THERE BUT AGAIN
[000:01:10;086] IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAR COME IS
[000:01:10;820] GOING TO BE DIPLOMACY.
[000:01:11;387] JULIE: WE HAVE TO "FOX NEWS"
[000:01:12;622] TEAM COVERAGE.
[000:01:17;627] WE BEGIN WITH KRISTIN FISHER WHO
[000:01:18;561] IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
[000:01:19;963] THIS WEEKEND AT MAR-A-LAGO IN
[000:01:21;798] FLORIDA AND KRISTIN IT'S BEEN
[000:01:23;800] OVER 48 HOURS SINCE HE TOOK HIS
[000:01:25;368] VERY FIRST BIG MILITARY ACTION
[000:01:28;238] AS PRESIDENT.
[000:01:29;005] ANY INDICATION OF HOW HE'S DOING
[000:01:30;340] TONIGHT?
[000:01:33;076] >> BY ALL ACCOUNTS PRESIDENT
[000:01:33;743] TRUMP'S VERY PLEASED THAT HIS
[000:01:34;844] DECISION TO STRIKE AND WITH HOW
[000:01:38;014] IT'S PLAYING OUT.
[000:01:38;515] HIS DECISION TO STRIKE HAS
[000:01:39;883] RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PRAISE FROM
[000:01:41;518] OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION.
[000:01:46;923] THE SAUDI TEAM CALLED A
[000:01:48;158] COURAGEOUS ACT AND SPRAYS BY
[000:01:49;659] REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON
[000:01:50;460] CAPITOL HILL.
[000:01:51;861] THE ONE AREA WHERE PRESIDENT
[000:01:52;695] TRUMP HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM
[000:01:54;063] THAT WAS HIS DECISION TO ACT
[000:01:56;299] WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING
[000:01:58;701] CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BUT EVEN
[000:01:59;435] ON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED
[000:02:00;170] THAT DECISION TODAY IN A LETTER
[000:02:00;904] TO CONGRESS.
[000:02:01;704] HE WROTE THAT I ACTED IN THE
[000:02:06;476] VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND
[000:02:07;143] FOREIGN-POLICY INTERESTS OF THE
[000:02:07;877] UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO MY
[000:02:08;745] CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO
[000:02:12;482] CONDUCT FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AS
[000:02:13;216] THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND CHIEF
[000:02:13;950] EXECUTIVE.
[000:02:14;784] THE U.S. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL
[000:02:16;419] ACTION AS NECESSARY AND
[000:02:17;921] APPROPRIATE TO FURTHER ITS
[000:02:19;322] IMPORTANT NATIONAL INTERESTS.
[000:02:21;925] THE TWO BIG TAKEAWAYS THERE ARE
[000:02:24;060] THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATING
[000:02:29;299] WHAT THE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.
[000:02:30;033] NIKKI HALEY SAID YESTERDAY, THAT
[000:02:30;867] THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO TAKE
[000:02:32;268] FURTHER ACTION IF NECESSARY IF
[000:02:36;606] ASSAD DOES NOT STOP THE CHEMICAL
[000:02:37;340] WEAPONS ATTACKS AGAINST HIS OWN
[000:02:38;708] PEOPLE AND THEN IT ALSO, THEY
[000:02:40;510] SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES HE
[000:02:42;078] CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WITHOUT
[000:02:43;780] RECEIVING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
[000:02:45;181] TO DO SO.
[000:02:46;249] I AM SURE A LOT OF FOLKS ON
[000:02:47;684] CAPITOL HILL WOULD DISAGREE WITH
[000:02:50;019] THAT.
[000:02:50;920] JULIE: WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
[000:02:51;588] KRISTIN ABOUT ALL THESE REPORTS
[000:02:52;522] OF A SHAKEUP WITH SENIOR WHITE
[000:02:56;626] HOUSE STAFF?
[000:02:57;627] ANY TRUTH TO THEM?
[000:02:58;428] >> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO TRUTH
[000:02:59;662] THAT THIS HAS KIND HAVE BEEN
[000:03:02;098] BREWING FOR SOME TIME.
[000:03:02;899] THE MAIN SOURCE OF CONFLICT IS
[000:03:05;401] BETWEEN SENIOR ADVISER JARED
[000:03:07;403] KUSHNER AND STEVE BANNON.
[000:03:10;206] AND THEN OF COURSE IS A
[000:03:10;807] NONINTERVENTIONIST.
[000:03:11;541] HE BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD NOT
[000:03:12;942] INTERVENE IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA
[000:03:16;279] AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE
[000:03:16;980] ARGUED AGAINST THE STRIKE.
[000:03:17;847] LAST NIGHT AT THE PRESIDENTS
[000:03:20;884] REQUEST THE TWO SAT DOWN AT
[000:03:23;286] MAR-A-LAGO BUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL
[000:03:28;625] DIVISIONS REMAIN.
[000:03:29;125] WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
[000:03:30;226] FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER COREY
[000:03:34;230] LEWANDOWSKI PUTS IT IN
[000:03:34;797] PERSPECTIVE.
[000:03:35;932] >> ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PRETEND
[000:03:39;903] TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE
[000:03:40;570] PRESIDENT MAY FIND THEMSELVES
[000:03:41;271] BACKTRACKING VERY QUICKLY WHAT
[000:03:42;505] WE KNOW IS THE PRESIDENT IS THE
[000:03:44;240] ONE WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS IN
[000:03:45;408] THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHO IS
[000:03:46;943] GOING TO LEAD.
[000:03:52;081] >> THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING
[000:03:52;782] ANY REPORTS OF A STAFF SHAKEUP
[000:03:54;784] IS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM
[000:03:55;718] THE GOOD WEEK THE PRESIDENT
[000:03:57;620] TRUMP'S HAD.
[000:04:00;757] JULIE: TO SERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH
[000:04:04;360] SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE TRUMP
[000:04:05;028] ADMINISTRATION?
[000:04:06;129] >> I THINK THIS RIFT BETWEEN
[000:04:08;197] BANNON AND KUSHNER IS INDICATIVE
[000:04:09;365] OF THE CROSSROADS THAT PRESIDENT
[000:04:10;500] TRUMP IS AT.
[000:04:11;901] IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING TO
[000:04:17;674] CONTINUE ON WITH HIS AMERICA
[000:04:18;441] FIRST THEME INSTEAD OF COUNTRIES
[000:04:20;243] LIKE SYRIA OR IS HE BECOMING A
[000:04:20;977] BIT MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN
[000:04:21;611] INTERVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT
[000:04:22;312] HE WARNED AGAINST ON THE
[000:04:22;912] CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
[000:04:23;846] ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS HE NOW
[000:04:26;082] TURNING ON RUSSIA A COUNTRY THAT
[000:04:30;086] STRONGLY SUPPORTED BASHAR
[000:04:31;621] AL-ASSAD ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE
[000:04:33;923] HAVE BEEN ALL THESE REPORTS BY
[000:04:38;227] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS HIS
[000:04:39;662] ASSOCIATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOO
[000:04:40;396] COZY WITH RUSSIA AND THERE ARE
[000:04:41;097] SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO
[000:04:41;798] WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF HIS
[000:04:43;800] ASSOCIATES BROKE THE LAW.
[000:04:45;468] ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH AND
[000:04:47;737] THAT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
[000:04:50;440] WILLING TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE.
[000:04:51;341] HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE HIS MIND
[000:04:52;542] TO DEFAULT.
[000:04:53;977] THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS
[000:04:56;179] EVOLVE INTO WHAT?
[000:04:59;182] EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF POLICIES HE
[000:04:59;916] GOING TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AND
[000:05:01;217] WILL IT ALIGN WITH THE JARED
[000:05:05;655] KUSHNER BRANCH OF THE WEST WING
[000:05:07;256] OR WHAT SIDE MORE WITH STEVE
[000:05:07;924] BANNON?
[000:05:08;925] JULIE: KRISTIN FISHER FOR
[000:05:10;460] TONIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
[000:05:14;230] THE U.S. ATTACK APPARENTLY HAS
[000:05:15;698] NOT SLOWED SYRIA DOWN MUCH.
[000:05:17;800] THAT IS THE WORD.
[000:05:20;036] JUST HOURS LATER SYRIAN
[000:05:21;437] WARPLANES FROM OTHER BASES
[000:05:23;172] APPARENTLY STRUCK OPPOSITION
[000:05:24;574] TARGETS INCLUDING ONE NEAR THE
[000:05:26;476] SITE OF A DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
[000:05:27;977] WHICH PROVOKED THE U.S. RESPONSE
[000:05:30;380] OF THE VERY FIRST PLACE.
[000:05:32;982] THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
[000:05:33;649] ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE JOHN
[000:05:35;018] McCAIN SEEN THE AMERICAN
[000:05:37;987] STRIKE WAS A GOOD START BUT MORE
[000:05:38;721] NEEDS TO BE DONE.
[000:05:39;222] LISTEN.
[000:05:40;590] >> I WOULD ARGUE FOR A NO-FLY
[000:05:41;924] ZONE AND ARMING AND TRAINING THE
[000:05:44;060] FREE SYRIAN ARMY.
[000:05:47;363] AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST
[000:05:48;998] CONTINUE TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQA
[000:05:51;734] AND STOP THIS FLOW THAT IS
[000:05:54;103] COMING OUT OF RAQQA AND BEING
[000:05:57;440] SENT TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED
[000:05:58;841] STATES TO PREVENT TERROR.
[000:06:03;413] SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE
[000:06:04;881] THE RIGHT FIRST STEP AND I THINK
[000:06:07;183] HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE
[000:06:08;484] AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:06:12;922] JULIE: PENTAGON PRODUCER LUKE IS
[000:06:13;656] THOMAS AND IS LIVE WITH THE VERY
[000:06:14;390] LATEST.
[000:06:15;525] WHAT ELSE WOULD I GUESS WE LIKE
[000:06:18;161] TO SEE AS FAR AS AIRSTRIKES INTO
[000:06:22;632] SYRIA, WHAT MORE THEY TALKING
[000:06:24;000] ABOUT?
[000:06:25;468] >> JULIE TODAY AN OLD ARCH ENEMY
[000:06:29;105] OF THE ASSAD REGIME TURKISH
[000:06:30;706] FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THIS EARLY
[000:06:32;241] TODAY IN TURKEY.
[000:06:36;312] >> WE SEE THE U.S. INTERVENTION
[000:06:38;481] AS APPROPRIATE.
[000:06:39;882] THIS IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER.
[000:06:41;417] DEFENSE INTERVENTION OF AN
[000:06:43;953] AIRBASE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE
[000:06:44;921] IF WE DON'T REMOVE THE REGIME
[000:06:46;322] FROM POWER AND THIS REMAINS A
[000:06:49;025] COSMETIC INTERVENTION.
[000:06:51;127] ANIMOSITY BETWEEN TURKEY AND
[000:06:52;695] ASSAD REGIME GOES BACK DECADES.
[000:06:55;264] 1939 TURKEY ANNEXED LAND AT
[000:06:56;699] NORTHWEST AREA WHICH TODAY IS
[000:07:01;337] TURKEY'S SOUTHERNMOST PROVINCE.
[000:07:03;439] SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS HELPED
[000:07:07;276] A RUSSIAN DRONES SEEN OVER A
[000:07:07;944] HOSPITAL WHERE VICTIMS OF
[000:07:08;578] TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:07:10;179] ATTACK WERE TAKEN AND FIVE HOURS
[000:07:11;280] LATER RUSSIAN AND SYRIAN JETS
[000:07:12;682] BOMBED IT IN AN EFFORT TO KILL
[000:07:16;519] MORE PEOPLE AND DESTROY THE
[000:07:17;220] EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
[000:07:18;654] RADIOS OFFICIALS SAY RUSSIA HAS
[000:07:21;691] CHEMICAL WEAPONS EXPERTS INSIDE
[000:07:23;960] SYRIA INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINAL
[000:07:25;995] ROLE -- A LITERAL PRE-TWO DAYS
[000:07:27;396] AFTER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
[000:07:29;966] MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA "FOX
[000:07:31;300] NEWS" HAS LEARNED THE U.S.
[000:07:33;803] MILITARY IS RAMPING UP EFFORTS
[000:07:34;504] TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 1000
[000:07:35;872] AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN
[000:07:38;441] SYRIA OR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE
[000:07:39;175] COALITION IS CUT BACK ON SOME OF
[000:07:40;143] ITS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ISIS
[000:07:41;477] THERE BECAUSE U.S. AIR FORCE
[000:07:45;982] F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER JETS FROM
[000:07:50;620] THE AIRBASE IN TURKEY NOT FAR
[000:07:51;320] FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER ARE
[000:07:52;655] CONDUCTING IN CREASED AIR
[000:07:55;558] PATROLS A CASE OF SYRIAN OR
[000:07:56;225] RUSSIAN MILITARY TRIES TO ATTACK
[000:07:58;327] AMERICAN FORCES ON THE GROUND.
[000:08:02;398] FOR THIS MOMENT JULIE U.S.
[000:08:03;032] OFFICIALS SAY THE ASSAD REGIME
[000:08:03;733] HAS NOT BEEN MAKING ANY
[000:08:04;400] THREATENING MOVES THE KEEP IN
[000:08:06;903] MIND IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS
[000:08:07;637] OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES ON
[000:08:10;039] THE GROUND YOU HAVE A U.S.
[000:08:11;240] MARINE CORPS ARTILLERY BATTERY
[000:08:12;642] OUTSIDE OF RAQQA SUPPORTING
[000:08:14;977] U.S.-BACKED FORCES AS THEY TRY
[000:08:16;379] TO RECAPTURE.
[000:08:21;217] JULIE: AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
[000:08:22;618] EXPECT MORE AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES
[000:08:23;352] AGAINST ASSAD REGIME BECAUSE IT
[000:08:24;086] SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:08:25;021] HAS HINTED THAT THERE ARE MORE
[000:08:26;689] TO COME AND OF COURSE THEIR
[000:08:27;957] POLICY AT THIS POINT AT LEAST
[000:08:30;793] WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE
[000:08:32;995] CLEAR IS THAT HE DOESN'T PLAN ON
[000:08:35;264] MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
[000:08:35;865] OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[000:08:37;400] HEAR WHAT THEIR PLAN IS UNTIL IT
[000:08:39;502] HAPPENS.
[000:08:40;570] >> THAT'S RIGHT IN OFFICIALS
[000:08:41;237] I'VE SPOKEN TODAY SAID NOT TO
[000:08:42;838] EXPECT ANY MORE AIRSTRIKES ON
[000:08:45;274] THE ASSAD REGIME ANYTIME SOON.
[000:08:46;642] AS WAS ALLUDED TO THIS WEEK
[000:08:47;977] PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED MORE
[000:08:49;979] PLANTS TO STRIKE THE ASSAD
[000:08:54;083] REGIME.
[000:08:54;817] MADE THE DECISION IN FOUR HOURS
[000:08:55;551] LATER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
[000:08:56;452] MISSILES LEFT THE RAIL.
[000:08:59;655] YESTERDAY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR
[000:09:01;057] THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI HALEY
[000:09:02;692] SAID THE UNITED STATES COULD
[000:09:03;993] STRIKE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.
[000:09:08;331] >> UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
[000:09:09;699] MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.
[000:09:11;500] WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE BUT
[000:09:14;136] WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE
[000:09:17;240] NECESSARY.
[000:09:19;842] >> JULIE ONE OF THOSE U.S.
[000:09:21;677] WARSHIPS THAT FIRED THE TOMAHAWK
[000:09:25;681] CRUISE MISSILES INTO SERIOUS
[000:09:26;849] HEADING TO AN UNDISCLOSED
[000:09:27;617] LOCATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO
[000:09:28;351] REARM.
[000:09:28;651] I JUST RECEIVED NEWS A FEW
[000:09:29;385] MINUTES AGO THE USS CARL VINSON
[000:09:31;254] AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAD BEEN
[000:09:33;589] PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED IN A PORTED
[000:09:37;159] AUSTRALIA HAS TURNED AROUND AND
[000:09:38;561] WILL BE PROCEEDING OUT THE
[000:09:40;496] KOREAN PENINSULA IN THE WAKE OF
[000:09:43;699] RECENT NORTH KOREAN
[000:09:45;735] PROVOCATIONS.
[000:09:47;236] JULIE: VERY INTERESTING.
[000:09:48;971] LUCAS TOMLINSON THANK YOU VERY
[000:09:49;839] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOVE TO STRIKE
[000:09:51;140] THE SYRIAN AIRBASE WINNING
[000:09:52;842] PRAISE FROM OUR ALLIES AROUND
[000:09:54;176] THE WORLD WHILE RUSSIA AND IRAN
[000:09:56;979] ARE PREVENTING THE ATTACK --
[000:09:57;780] CONDEMNING THE ATTACK.
[000:09:59;315] PROTESTERS LINING THE STREETS OF
[000:10:00;716] DAMASCUS CALLING THE ATTACK AND
[000:10:04;820] AGGRESSION AGAINST THE ENTIRE
[000:10:05;721] NATION BUT RUSSIA REMAINS THE
[000:10:07;023] MOST CRITICAL.
[000:10:07;890] KATIE LOGAN HAS MORE FROM OUR
[000:10:09;358] LONDON BUREAU.
[000:10:13;396] >> UK, THE STRONGEST OBJECTIONS
[000:10:18;534] ARE COMING FROM RUSSIA.
[000:10:20;936] THEY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.
[000:10:22;538] ACTION IN SYRIA IS THE SAUDIS
[000:10:29;679] CALLING IT A COURAGEOUS DECISION
[000:10:32;715] BUT REFLECTING A REGION OVER
[000:10:34;684] SYRIA IRANIAN PRESIDENT A STRONG
[000:10:40;356] ALLY OF ASSAD HAS BEEN CRITICAL
[000:10:41;090] OF U.S. DECISION.
[000:10:41;590] IT WAS THESE IMAGES OF THE
[000:10:42;558] HORRIFIC CHEMICAL STRIKE IN
