[000:00:06;473] SECONDS.

[000:00:08;274] >>> THERE IS BREAKING NEWS
[000:00:09;509] TONIGHT.
[000:00:11;945] A MASSIVE TORNADO JUST OUTSIDE
[000:00:13;513] OKLAHOMA CITY.
[000:00:14;481] AN ENORMOUS, PERHAPS HISTORIC
[000:00:16;082] PATH OF DESTRUCTION AFTER A
[000:00:19;753] DIRECT HIT FROM A TORNADO
[000:00:20;920] ESTIMATED AT A MILE WIDE.
[000:00:23;757] MUCH OF THE CITY OF MOORE,
[000:00:25;892] OKLAHOMA, HAS BEEN WIPED OUT.
[000:00:28;862] ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GONE,
[000:00:29;996] INCLUDING TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
[000:00:32;332] WHERE CHILDREN HAD TO BE PULLED
[000:00:33;333] OUT OF THE WRECKAGE.
[000:00:37;871] TONIGHT, A MASSIVE SEARCH FOR
[000:00:40;006] SURVIVORS IS JUST GETTING UNDER
[000:00:44;411] WAY.
[000:00:45;278] OUR TEAM IS THERE ON THE GROUND.
[000:00:45;879] WAY.
[000:00:45;879] OUR TEAM IS THERE ON THE GROUND.
[000:00:45;879] "NBC NIGHTLY NEWS" BEGINS NOW.
[000:00:51;684] CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
[000:00:51;684] NBC-UNIVERSAL TELEVISION
[000:00:55;321] >>> A SPECIAL GOOD EVENING TO
[000:00:56;256] OUR VIEWERS IN THE WESTERN PART
[000:00:58;591] OF THE UNITED STATES THIS
[000:00:59;559] EVENING.
[000:00:59;893] IT APPEARS WE ARE COVERING A
[000:01:02;028] HISTORY-MAKING TORNADO IN
[000:01:02;662] OKLAHOMA THIS EVENING.
[000:01:05;398] IT'S EARLY YET.
[000:01:06;399] IT HAPPENED JUST A FEW HOURS AGO
[000:01:08;168] IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, JUST TO THE
[000:01:09;836] SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY.
[000:01:11;171] BUT SO FAR THE STATE MEDICAL
[000:01:13;973] EXAMINER HAS TOLD THE ASSOCIATED
[000:01:16;443] PRESS THE INITIAL DEATH TOLL IS
[000:01:19;446] 37 FROM THIS ONE TORNADO.
[000:01:21;614] FROM THE AIR, IT IS HARD TO KNOW
[000:01:23;583] AT TIMES JUST WHAT IT IS WE ARE
[000:01:24;717] LOOKING AT.
[000:01:27;320] BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EITHER AN
[000:01:30;957] F4 OR F5, THE STRONGEST
[000:01:33;293] INTENSITY ON EARTH, IT WAS OVER
[000:01:34;594] A MILE WIDE AT THE BASE OF THE
[000:01:36;963] STORM.
[000:01:37;363] IT WAS IN THIS SAME TOWN --
[000:01:40;366] MOORE, OKLAHOMA -- BACK IN 1999
[000:01:42;402] WHEN THE HIGHEST EVER TORNADO
[000:01:44;137] WINDS WERE RECORDED, 302 MILES
[000:01:47;340] AN HOUR.
[000:01:48;041] AGAIN, EARLY PICTURES FROM MOORE
[000:01:50;610] SHOW SCHOOL CHILDREN STAGGERING
[000:01:51;711] INTO THE ARMS OF TEACHERS AND
[000:01:54;214] PARENTS.
[000:01:54;581] THERE ARE FIRES BURNING FROM
[000:01:56;149] OPEN GAS LINES.
[000:01:57;684] THERE ARE MILES OF DEVASTATION.
[000:02:00;420] IT HAS BEEN HARD TO LISTEN TO,
[000:02:02;422] BUT LOCAL REPORTERS HAVE BEEN
[000:02:04;757] BREAKING UP ON THE AIR TODAY,
[000:02:06;860] OVERCOME WITH EMOTION BECAUSE,
[000:02:08;161] AFTER ALL, THEY ARE COVERING
[000:02:09;462] THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.
[000:02:10;930] ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE REPORT
[000:02:12;499] THAT MANY SCHOOL CHILDREN MAY
[000:02:13;733] HAVE BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE ONE
[000:02:15;835] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
[000:02:16;469] HERE NOW IS SOME OF THE EARLY
[000:02:18;838] REPORTING FROM THAT SCHOOL, OUR
[000:02:20;807] FIRST INDICATION WE MAY HAVE HAD
[000:02:22;175] A DEVASTATING SITUATION THERE.
[000:02:24;043] THIS IS JESSE WELLS FROM OUR NBC
[000:02:26;880] TELEVISION STATION KFOR.
[000:02:30;550] >> Reporter: THIS IS THE FRONT
[000:02:31;484] OF PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
[000:02:33;319] SCHOOL.
[000:02:33;653] YOU CAN SEE AGAIN -- WE HAVE
[000:02:34;854] SAID IT BEFORE FROM THE AIR --
[000:02:36;322] THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.
[000:02:38;191] IT'S TOTALLY DESTROYED.
[000:02:42;095] MOST OF THE WALLS COLLAPSED.
[000:02:44;063] AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A
[000:02:46;132] NUMBER OF CARS THAT WERE THROWN
[000:02:47;834] INTO THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.
[000:02:50;236] IT'S AN OFFICE ON THE FRONT OF
[000:02:51;838] THIS SCHOOL.
[000:02:52;505] THERE IS A TRUCK, SUV OF SOME
[000:02:54;641] KIND THROWN INTO THE FRONT OF
[000:02:55;909] THE SCHOOL.
[000:02:56;342] OVER HERE TO THE SOUTH EMERGENCY
[000:02:58;611] CREWS HAVE BEEN CONTINUING TO
[000:02:59;579] WORK ON GETTING KIDS OUT OF THE
[000:03:01;314] SCHOOL BUILDING.
[000:03:02;348] AGAIN, I TOLD YOU A FEW MINUTES
[000:03:03;850] I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF KIDS
[000:03:05;752] THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL AT THE
[000:03:07;120] TIME.
[000:03:07;420] THEY WERE LITERALLY HUGGING THE
[000:03:10;590] WALLS OF THE INTERIOR HALLWAYS
[000:03:13;026] AS THAT TORNADO WENT OVERHEAD,
[000:03:14;861] TRYING TO SURVIVE.
[000:03:15;962] THEY WERE BEING PROTECTED BY
[000:03:17;263] SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT WORKED
[000:03:19;132] IN THIS SCHOOL BUILDING.
[000:03:20;800] AGAIN, RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW
[000:03:22;535] HOW MANY KIDS WERE INSIDE OR ARE
[000:03:24;938] STILL INSIDE.
[000:03:25;838] AGAIN, APPARENTLY THERE MAY
[000:03:28;074] STILL BE KIDS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.
[000:03:29;609] WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.
[000:03:30;777] THE INFORMATION IS VERY SPARSE
[000:03:32;612] DOWN HERE.
[000:03:33;479] YOU CAN SEE SEARCH AND RESCUE
[000:03:35;048] CREWS CONTINUING TO TREAT THE
[000:03:36;950] KIDS THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL.
[000:03:39;752] THE SEARCH FOR KIDS, THERE MAY
[000:03:42;589] STILL BE KIDS INSIDE.
[000:03:44;257] HONESTLY IT'S NOT JUST THE
[000:03:45;758] SCHOOL THAT GOT HIT.
[000:03:47;126] AS WE PAN AROUND FURTHER YOU
[000:03:48;728] WILL BE ABLE TO SEE ALL AROUND,
[000:03:52;232] 360 DEGREES AROUND WHERE I'M
[000:03:53;566] STANDING ALL OF THE HOMES
[000:03:55;668] LITERALLY LEVELLED TO THE
[000:03:59;038] GROUND.
[000:03:59;372] >> THERE WAS STILL DAYLIGHT
[000:04:00;473] THERE.
[000:04:01;407] JESSE WELLS FOR KFOR FOR THAT
[000:04:04;744] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE WE MAY
[000:04:05;745] HAVE A VERY, VERY GRIM SITUATION
[000:04:07;447] AS THE SEARCH AND RESCUE GOES
[000:04:11;184] ON.
[000:04:11;451] WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST
[000:04:12;185] MIKE BETTES MADE HIS WAY TO
[000:04:14;087] MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
[000:04:15;555] MIKE, WHAT DO YOU SEE AROUND
[000:04:17;957] YOU?
[000:04:18;224] >> Reporter: BRIAN, THE SCENE IS
[000:04:19;726] AS DEVASTATING AS IT GETS FROM A
[000:04:22;328] HISTORY-MAKING TORNADO IN MOORE,
[000:04:23;930] OKLAHOMA.
[000:04:24;364] I CAN GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE OF
[000:04:26;833] WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE
[000:04:30;603] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
[000:04:31;170] AT LEAST SIX CHILDREN HAVE
[000:04:33;273] DROWNED IN THE BASEMENT.
[000:04:34;574] AS MANY NOW AS 30 SCHOOL
[000:04:36;342] CHILDREN UNACCOUNTED FOR AND MAY
[000:04:38;244] HAVE INDEED PERISHED IN THE
[000:04:40;179] SCHOOL AS IT WAS DIRECTLY STRUCK
[000:04:41;414] BY THE TORNADO.
[000:04:42;415] I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE
[000:04:44;117] PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED
[000:04:46;286] HERE.
[000:04:46;586] WE BELIEVE ABOUT A MILE-WIDE
[000:04:48;521] TORNADO HAS JUST LEVELLED THE
[000:04:50;657] COMMUNITIES IN MOORE.
[000:04:53;092] THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE
[000:04:55;361] OUTSIDE OF MOORE.
[000:04:55;862] THESE ARE WELL BUILT FRAME
[000:04:57;230] HOMES, BRICK HOMES.
[000:04:58;731] THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.
[000:05:00;500] THESE HOMES ARE FLATTENED.
[000:05:02;335] CARS ON TOP OF HOMES.
[000:05:04;037] CARS ON TOP OF CARS.
[000:05:05;672] THEY ARE MANGLED BEYOND BELIEF.
[000:05:08;007] SEARCH AND RESCUE IS ONGOING AT
[000:05:10;610] THIS POINT.
[000:05:11;010] THEY ARE GATHERING RIGHT NOW,
[000:05:13;946] SETTING UP COMMAND POSTS, TRYING
[000:05:15;281] TO BE ORDERLY IN HOW THEY
[000:05:16;883] RESPOND TO THIS.
[000:05:17;850] THEY ARE GOING TO NEED TO GO
[000:05:19;419] HOME TO HOME TO HOME AND MAKE
[000:05:21;154] SURE EVERYONE IS ACCOUNTED FOR.
[000:05:22;388] WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME HERE IS
[000:05:25;024] THEM ESTABLISHING A COMMAND POST
[000:05:26;693] AT THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
[000:05:28;127] THIS IS BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY
[000:05:29;796] SCHOOL THAT ALSO TOOK A DIRECT
[000:05:31;097] HIT FROM THE TORNADO.
[000:05:31;898] WE TALKED TO ONE SCHOOL TEACHER
[000:05:34;434] A LITTLE BIT AGO.
[000:05:35;301] HE SAID THE TEACHERS TOOK ALL
[000:05:37;904] THE SCHOOL KIDS INTO THE MIDDLE,
[000:05:40;006] THE CENTER PART OF THE SCHOOL,
[000:05:43;009] PUT THEM ON INTERIOR WALLS AND
[000:05:44;344] AS FAR AS HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE
[000:05:46;179] TEACHER AND STUDENT IS ACCOUNTED
[000:05:47;880] FOR.
[000:05:48;147] THAT IS GREAT NEWS.
[000:05:49;148] SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL STILL GO
[000:05:51;117] THROUGH THE BUILDING THROUGH
[000:05:53;252] NIGHT, WE ARE TOLD BY
[000:05:54;554] FIREFIGHTERS, TO MAKE SURE
[000:05:55;321] EVERYTHING IS OKAY.
[000:05:56;122] WE SPOKE WITH A YOUNG WOMAN THAT
[000:05:57;790] LIVES IN THIS HOME.
[000:05:59;225] SHE WAS NOT HOME AT THE TIME,
[000:06:00;526] THANK GOODNESS.
[000:06:01;494] SHE'S OKAY.
[000:06:02;362] HER FAMILY IS OKAY.
[000:06:03;496] HER NEIGHBORS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.
[000:06:05;198] NOW IT IS THE HARD TASK OF
[000:06:06;799] TRYING TO PUT YOUR LIFE BACK
[000:06:08;234] TOGETHER AND TRYING TO FIGURE
[000:06:10;370] OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SO MUCH
[000:06:11;637] CHANGED FOR YOU IN AN INSTANT.
[000:06:14;006] WE ARE WITH DR. GREG FORBES, AN
[000:06:15;875] EXPERT IN SURVEYING DAMAGE.
[000:06:17;710] HE'S DONE HUNDREDS OF DAMAGE
[000:06:19;712] SURVEYS IN HIS LONG CAREER.
[000:06:21;280] DR. FORBES, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
[000:06:22;582] ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?
[000:06:23;549] >> NO.
[000:06:24;550] THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER
[000:06:26;252] SEEN.
[000:06:26;552] THE EXPANSE OF THE DAMAGE,
[000:06:28;187] PROBABLY THREE BLOCKS IN THIS
[000:06:30;156] NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:06:30;590] IT GOES ON AT LEAST A MILE DOWN
[000:06:33;092] THERE.
[000:06:33;393] I HAVE NEVER SEEN DESTRUCTION SO
[000:06:35;228] TOTAL OVER SUCH AN EXPANSIVE
[000:06:38;431] AREA.
[000:06:38;731] >> Reporter: DR. FORBES, IS
[000:06:40;032] THERE A QUESTION IN YOUR MIND
[000:06:41;367] SINCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS MORE
[000:06:43;836] THAN ANYBODY ON THE TALENT THAT
[000:06:45;772] THIS TORNADO WILL NOT BE AN
[000:06:48;541] EF-5?
[000:06:48;841] >> I WOULD GIVE IT AN EF-5
[000:06:51;310] RATING.
[000:06:53;446] WE HAVE TREES DEBARKED, CARS
[000:06:56;115] TOSSED LONG DISTANCE.
[000:06:57;116] STRUCTURES BROKEN INTO PIECES,
[000:06:59;852] UNRECOGNIZABLE AND TOSSED AS
[000:07:01;687] DEBRIS DOWNWIND.
[000:07:02;655] IT IS A SCENE OF UTTER
[000:07:04;357] DESTRUCTION, ALMOST BEYOND
[000:07:05;725] WORDS.
[000:07:06;058] >> Reporter: BRIAN, YOU KNOW,
[000:07:06;959] THESE ARE THE TYPES OF STORIES
[000:07:08;628] WE HATE TO COME TO YOU WITH.
[000:07:10;430] WE KNOW THIS IS A SCENE THAT'S
[000:07:12;064] HAPPENED BEFORE.
[000:07:12;799] WE SAW THIS TWO YEARS AGO IN
[000:07:15;501] JOPLIN, MISSOURI.
[000:07:16;569] CONJECTURE IS SOMETHING WE DON'T
[000:07:17;703] LIKE TO DO.
[000:07:19;172] AT THAT TIME EARLY ON IN THAT
[000:07:21;240] TORNADO THE FATALITY COUNT WAS
[000:07:23;976] 29.
[000:07:24;243] OVERNIGHT IT WENT TO 92.
[000:07:26;245] RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CONFIRMED
[000:07:28;581] FATALITY OF 37.
[000:07:29;682] THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S
[000:07:31;717] BEEN FLATTENED.
[000:07:33;052] I'M AFRAID OF WHAT WE'LL END UP
[000:07:35;121] SEEING TOMORROW WHEN MORE
[000:07:36;189] NUMBERS COME OUT, WHEN THERE IS
[000:07:37;690] A MORE COMPREHENSIVE TALLY OF
[000:07:39;725] WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.
[000:07:41;294] SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL GO ON
[000:07:43;029] THROUGH THE NIGHT.
[000:07:43;729] THERE IS A PUNGENT ODOR TO HAVE
[000:07:47;900] NATURAL GAS AND GASOLINE.
[000:07:49;268] WE ARE JUST HOURS INTO THIS.
[000:07:50;570] I'M TRULY STUNNED BY WHAT I SEE.
[000:07:52;905] >> MIKE BETTES ALONG WITH DR.
[000:07:55;741] GREG FORBES IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
[000:07:57;577] AS MIKE SAYS, IT IS EARLY YET.
[000:08:00;246] WE COULD BE IN FOR SOME DARK
[000:08:02;114] HOURS AND DARK DAYS AHEAD FOR
[000:08:04;550] THAT COMMUNITY AS THEY COME TO
[000:08:08;654] GRIPS WITH WHAT'S BEEN LOST
[000:08:09;956] HERE.
[000:08:10;356] MIKE, THANK YOU.
[000:08:11;357] OUR THANKS TO DR. FORBES AS
[000:08:14;560] WELL.
[000:08:14;861] >>> WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A
[000:08:17;296] SURVIVOR, SOMEONE WHO WAS
[000:08:18;464] EVACUATED AND MADE IT THROUGH
[000:08:20;366] THIS STORM IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
[000:08:22;201] I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN GET TO
[000:08:25;905] THAT NOW.
[000:08:26;539] >> WE THOUGHT WE DIED.
[000:08:28;407] WE WERE INSIDE THE CELLAR DOOR.
[000:08:30;209] LOCKED THE CELLAR DOOR WHEN WE
[000:08:32;278] SAW IT COMING.
[000:08:33;379] IT GOT LOUDER AND NEXT THING YOU
[000:08:36;649] KNOW, YOU SEE THE LATCH COMING
[000:08:38;618] UNDONE.
[000:08:38;951] WE COULDN'T REACH FOR IT.
[000:08:40;920] IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR AND JUST
[000:08:43;789] GLASS AND DEBRIS STARTED
[000:08:45;258] SLAMMING ON US.
[000:08:46;192] WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE
[000:08:48;227] HONEST.
[000:08:48;561] >> AGAIN, WHEN YOU HEAR A
[000:08:50;930] SURVIVOR STORY IT MEANS, ALMOST
[000:08:52;899] BY DEFINITION IN THE HEART OF
[000:08:56;302] THIS STORM THAT THEY HAD
[000:08:56;936] SOMEWHERE TO GO.
[000:08:58;104] LOCAL WEATHER AUTHORITIES WERE
[000:08:59;405] SAYING THE ONLY WAY THIS WAS
[000:09:01;607] SURVIVABLE WAS TO BE UNDER
[000:09:03;676] GROUND AT A SECURE UNDER GROUND
[000:09:07;179] SHELTER.
[000:09:07;513] IT MAY FIGURE THAT SOME OF THE
[000:09:09;315] PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THIS WERE
[000:09:11;551] INDEED ABLE TO GET TO SHELTERS
[000:09:14;520] AND THE OPPOSITE WAS NOT TRUE.
[000:09:17;890] JANET SHAMLIAN HAS MADE HER WAY
[000:09:19;492] TO MOORE, OKLAHOMA, THIS
[000:09:20;993] EVENING.
[000:09:21;594] JANET, GOOD EVENING.
[000:09:22;328] >> Reporter: BRIAN, GOOD EVENING
[000:09:23;262] TO YOU.
[000:09:23;896] WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MOORE HAS
[000:09:25;765] BASICALLY PARALYZED EVERYTHING
[000:09:27;533] NEAR AND AROUND IT.
[000:09:28;534] WHAT YOU SEE OVER MY SHOULDER IS
[000:09:29;902] THE AGONIZING WAIT OF PEOPLE
[000:09:32;672] TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE
[000:09:34;840] COMMUNITY.
[000:09:35;207] WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, MOST OF
[000:09:36;642] THEM ARE BEING TURNED AWAY.
[000:09:38;644] JUST TO GET TO THIS POINT, THIS
[000:09:40;413] ROAD GOES ABOUT TWO MILES TO THE
[000:09:43;215] INTERSTATE.
[000:09:43;616] IT IS ABOUT AN HOUR TO GET THOSE
[000:09:45;117] TWO MILES.
[000:09:46;218] MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT
[000:09:47;787] BEING ALLOWED BACK INTO THEIR
[000:09:49;822] HOMES.
[000:09:50;122] MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN TRYING
[000:09:51;591] FOR HOURS.
[000:09:53;759] THEY REPORT COMMUTES OF TWO OR
[000:09:55;194] THREE HOURS TO GET 12 OR 14
[000:09:57;597] MILES.
[000:09:57;897] THE ONLY VEHICLES WE ARE SEEING

[000:10:02;568] TROOPERS, POLICE, UTILITY
[000:10:04;704] COMPANIES.
[000:10:05;071] AND THE ONLY ONES WE HAVE SEEN
[000:10:06;706] COME OUT ARE TWO AMBULANCES WITH
[000:10:08;874] THEIR SIRENS FLASHI INING ABOUT
[000:10:14;113] HOUR AGO.
[000:10:15;081] THAT BROUGHT HOPE TO US HERE.
[000:10:17;350] SPEAKING OF THE PARALYSIS, THE
[000:10:19;085] USAGE OF CELL PHONES HAS MADE
[000:10:20;820] TRYING TO USE THE CELL PHONES
[000:10:22;622] BASICALLY USELESS.
[000:10:24;624] YOU CANNOT GET A CELL CALL IN OR
[000:10:27;560] OUT.
[000:10:27;827] PEOPLE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE ARE
[000:10:29;595] STRUGGLING IN THAT WAY AS WELL.
[000:10:31;163] AS WE SEE THE AERIALS OF THE
[000:10:32;999] SEARCH CREWS GOING HOUSE TO
[000:10:34;467] HOUSE TO HOUSE THEY ARE
[000:10:35;701] DEFINITELY TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE

[000:10:52;585] THEY WILL DIVIDE UP THE
[000:10:53;953] COMMUNITY INTO GRIDS.
[000:10:55;054] IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO
[000:10:57;156] BEGIN.
[000:10:57;456] YOU HAVE TO SET UP SOME
[000:10:59;225] STRUCTURE AND SEARCH PROPERTY BY
[000:11:01;427] PROPERTY.
[000:11:01;794] IN SOME CASES IT WILL BE
[000:11:03;763] IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ADDRESSES.
[000:11:06;232] >> YEAH.
[000:11:07;166] YOU KNOW, WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN
[000:11:08;834] ABLE TO TALK TO ANYBODY COMING
[000:11:10;536] OUT.
[000:11:10;803] PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE CALLS
[000:11:12;538] IN NOW ASKING US, DO OUR PHONES
[000:11:14;940] WORK, AND THEY DON'T EITHER.
[000:11:16;676] WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET
[000:11:17;943] MUCH COMMUNICATION.
[000:11:19;278] WE KNOW EVERYONE IS AFFECTED IN
[000:11:20;546] THE SAME WAY AT THIS POINT.
[000:11:21;614] >> JANET SHAMLIAN PART OF OUR

[000:11:32;291] TO BE HONEST.
[000:11:34;794] WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND --
[000:11:39;165] WE HAD A LONG WIND-UP ON SEVERE
[000:11:41;667] WEATHER.
[000:11:42;001] WE KNEW THIS SYSTEM WAS COMING.
[000:11:44;103] AT LEAST IT STRUCK DURING THE
[000:11:44;970] DAY AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
[000:11:47;073] NIGHT.
[000:11:47;373] SO I'M HOPING THAT SIRENS WERE
[000:11:49;542] BLARING FOR A GOOD, LONG TILE.

[000:12:04;590] JUST NORTH OF WHERE THIS ONE
[000:12:06;759] TRACKED ACROSS THE CITY OF
[000:12:08;728] MOORE.
[000:12:09;095] THAT ONE WAS MEASURED AT 302
[000:12:14;533] MILES PER HOUR.
[000:12:15;000] THE STRONGEST WINDS EVER
[000:12:16;402] MEASURED ON THE PLANET BECAUSE

[000:12:19;839] TECHNOLOGY CAME INTO PLAY THAT
[000:12:21;540] ALLOWED US TO MEASURE TORNADOES.
[000:12:25;644] WE DON'T KNOW.
[000:12:26;479] IN FACT, I DOUBT IT WAS.
[000:12:27;913] LET ME SHOW YOU THIS AS IT WENT.

[000:12:43;796] INTENSI
[000:12:44;830] INTENSIFYING.
[000:12:45;264] IT JUST INTENSIFIED TO ITS WORST
[000:12:46;265] AT THE TIME THAT IT CROSSED NEAR
[000:12:48;367] THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEN
[000:12:50;536] MOVED ACROSS I-35 AND WEAKENED
[000:12:53;105] AS IT WENT ON THROUGH MOORE.
[000:12:55;074] THE LIFETIME OF THE TORNADO,
[000:12:57;009] BRIAN, WAS ONLY ABOUT 40 MINUTES
[000:12:59;445] AND THE CORE PEAK TIME WAS ABOUT
[000:13:01;480] 15 MINUTES AND IT WAS IN THAT
[000:13:04;049] PERIOD IN THE POPULATED PART OF

[000:22:37;222] HOSPITALS ARE TREATING MORE THAN
[000:22:39;991] 120 PATIENTS AFTER THIS TORNADO

[000:22:52;704] TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE UNABLE TO
[000:22:54;706] FIND ADDRESSES, UNABLE TO LOCATE
[000:22:57;075] WHERE THEY ONCE LIVED.
[000:22:58;643] IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE IT, BUT
[000:23:00;812] THIS IS, I THINK YOU WILL AGREE,
[000:23:03;782] THE MOST INTENSE WEATHER SYSTEM
[000:23:06;218] THE EARTH CAN PRODUCE.
[000:23:07;619] >> IT IS, BRIAN.
[000:23:08;620] IT'S THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.
[000:23:11;189] I WAS NOT IN JOPLIN, BUT AS FAR
[000:23:12;991] AS I CAN SEE LEFT AND RIGHT,
[000:23:14;893] ABOUT 150 TO 200 YARDS, THERE IS
[000:23:17;496] NOTHING LEFT.
[000:23:18;263] ALL YOU SEE IS CONCRETE SLABS.
[000:23:20;966] OUT OF EVERY CONCRETE SLAB YOU
[000:23:23;034] SEE WATER GEYSERS.
[000:23:24;936] THERE IS STILL GAS.
[000:23:25;737] I WALKED FROM THE SCHOOL OVER
[000:23:28;106] HERE AND I HEAR A HISSING SOUND
[000:23:29;941] AND REALIZE, LET'S GET OUT OF
[000:23:32;077] HERE.
[000:23:32;377] THERE ARE A LOT OF GAS LEAKS.
[000:23:33;912] I'M LOOKING AT THE PLAZA TOWERS
[000:23:36;381] ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE LATEST
[000:23:37;582] I GOT FROM NURSES AND DOCTORS AT
[000:23:40;752] TRIAGE ARE AT LEAST 24 CHILDREN
[000:23:42;154] ARE STILL MISSING.
[000:23:44;823] THERE ARE ABOUT 150 RESPONDERS
[000:23:48;059] OVER THERE TRYING TO COMB
[000:23:48;860] THROUGH THE WRECKAGE.
[000:23:50;529] THEY HAVE ALREADY SET UP THE
[000:23:53;131] LIGHTS.
[000:23:53;465] YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING WELL INTO
[000:23:54;232] THE NIGHT.
[000:23:54;800] THERE ARE SEVEN OR EIGHT
[000:23:56;835] AMBULANCES WAITING.
[000:23:57;936] MORE THAN LIKELY WE ARE GOING TO
[000:23:59;671] HAVE MORE FATALITIES.
[000:24:01;072] THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE RUBBLE.
[000:24:02;941] THE SCHOOL IS JUST BLOWN APART.
[000:24:05;343] SOME OF THE CONCRETE WALLS,
[000:24:06;945] BRICK WALLS ARE STANDING.
[000:24:08;346] AS I WALKED THROUGH MOORE I SAW
[000:24:10;649] PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREETS
[000:24:11;917] WITH THEIR PETS, BLOODIES.
[000:24:14;619] ONE GIRL CAME BACK TO SAVE HER
[000:24:16;988] DOG AND GOT INTO THE BATHTUB.
[000:24:18;990] SHE SHOWED US WHERE SHE WAS.
[000:24:20;559] IT'S A PURE MIRACLE SHE WAS ABLE
[000:24:22;294] TO SAVE HERSELF AND THE DOG AND
[000:24:24;129] GET OUT OF THAT TUB.
[000:24:26;097] WE'VE GOT THE PICTURES.
[000:24:27;532] WE'LL SHOW YOU LATER.
[000:24:29;000] I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE E MADE IT.
[000:24:31;903] SHE'S BANGED UP PRETTY GOOD.
[000:24:34;573] SHE'S GOT BLOOD ALL OVER HER,
[000:24:35;974] BUT SHE'S OKAY AND HER DOG IS
[000:24:37;742] OKAY, TOO.
[000:24:38;677] IT'S TOTAL DEVASTATION.
[000:24:40;779] THE TORNADO CAME THROUGH LIKE A
[000:24:42;814] BUZZ SAW AND SCRAPED THE EARTH
[000:24:44;449] CLEAN.
[000:24:44;749] IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT WE SAW
[000:24:47;052] AFTER KATRINA WHEN THE 25-FOOT
[000:24:51;289] STORM SURGE HIT THE COAST.
[000:24:52;991] NOTHING WAS LEFT EXCEPT BIG
[000:24:55;160] TREES AND STEEL GIRDERS.
[000:24:56;394] THAT'S ALL WE SEE HERE.
[000:24:58;063] TREES DEBARKED.
[000:24:59;531] AS DR. FORBES MENTIONED, AND
[000:25:01;099] HE'S THE EXPERT, BUT THIS HAS TO
[000:25:03;068] BE EF-5 DAMAGE.
[000:25:04;636] WIND EASILY OVER 200 MILES PER
[000:25:06;771] HOUR.
[000:25:07;639] THE GRIM SITUATION CONTINUES AT
[000:25:09;241] THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE
[000:25:10;509] FROM THE NURSES AND DOCTORS AT
[000:25:12;310] THE TRIAGE, THEY ARE TELLING US
[000:25:14;479] THAT THE COUNT NOW IS 24 MISSING
[000:25:18;016] CHILDREN.
[000:25:18;450] BRIAN, AS THE SUN GOES DOWN,
[000:25:20;886] IT'S GOING TO GET DARK AND MAKE
[000:25:22;888] IT TOUGH TO FIND ANYTHING.
[000:25:24;556] YOU'RE RIGHT.
[000:25:26;224] YOU JUST CAN'T FIND ADDRESSES
[000:25:27;726] OUT HERE.
[000:25:28;260] EVERYTHING IS GONE.
[000:25:29;227] PILES OF RUBBLE.
[000:25:30;862] WITH THE HOUSES WHERE I'M
[000:25:32;531] STANDING THERE'S NOTHING.
[000:25:33;365] THE RUBBLE IS GONE.
[000:25:35;300] WE PROBABLY WALKED A MILE AND A
[000:25:37;335] HALF.
[000:25:37;936] EVEN OUT WHERE WE PARKED ON THE
[000:25:39;938] FRINGE NEAR I-35 IT'S NOT BIG
[000:25:42;774] DEBRIS, BUT THERE IS DEBRIS
