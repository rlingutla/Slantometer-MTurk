Like you do sometimes, Grandpa? 

360
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,480
   Well, when you have COPD,    

361
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,933
   it can be hard to breathe.   

362
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,834
 It can be hard to get air out, 

363
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,054
     which can make it hard     
         to get air in.         

364
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:24,438
   So I talked to my doctor.    

365
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,473
          She said...           

366
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:27,024
      SYMBICORT could help      
      you breathe better,       

367
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,726
   starting within 5 minutes.   

368
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:30,561
       SYMBICORT doesn't        
    replace a rescue inhaler    

369
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,196
      for sudden symptoms.      

370
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,232
    SYMBICORT helps provide     
    significant improvement     

371
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:35,483
     of your lung function.     

372
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,017
     SYMBICORT is for COPD,     

373
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,370
  including chronic bronchitis  
         and emphysema.         

374
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,689
     It should not be taken     
     more than twice a day.     

375
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,207
 SYMBICORT contains formoterol. 

376
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,126
   Medicines like formoterol    
      increase the risk of      

377
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,744
  death from asthma problems.   

378
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,879
  SYMBICORT may increase your   
    risk of lung infections,    

379
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,998
     osteoporosis, and some     
         eye problems.          

380
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,800
 You should tell your doctor if 
   you have a heart condition   

381
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,585
     or high blood pressure     
       before taking it.        

382
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:57,705
   SYMBICORT could mean a day   
     with better breathing.     

383
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:58,706
      Watch out, piggies!

434
