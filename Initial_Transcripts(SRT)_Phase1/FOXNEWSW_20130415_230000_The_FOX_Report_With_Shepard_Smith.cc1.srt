I'M SHEPARD SMITH.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
SAYS THE EXPLOSIONS IN

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
BOSTON ARE QUOTE:  CLEARLY

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
AN ACT OF TERROR.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
NOW, FROM THAT SAME

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
SPOKESMAN TO LEARN WHETHER

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
THE PERPETRATORS ARE

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN AND

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
WHETHER THOSE PERPETRATORS

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
ARE MEMBERS OF A TERRORIST

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
ORGANIZATION.

26
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
TO THOSE QUESTIONS AT THIS

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
MOMENT WE HAVE NO ANSWERS.

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
RIGHT NOW AWAITING ANOTHER

29
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
BRIEFING FROM OFFICIALS IN

BOSTON WITH THE LATEST

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
INFORMATION.

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
IT'S SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT
THIS MOMENT.

33
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE WHEN

34
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
IT DOES.

35
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT

36
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
NOW.
AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE ARE

37
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
CONFIRMED DEAD, 70 HURT

38
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
AFTER TWO BOMBS EXPLODED AT

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
THE FINISH LINE OF THE

40
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
BOSTON MARATHON.

41
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
ONE WITNESS SAYS HE WATCHED

42
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A TRASH CAN EXPLODE.

43
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
HERE IS VIDEO OF THE FIRST

44
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
WOMAN AND AND -- BOMB AND

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
MOMENTS OF CHAOS THAT

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
FOLLOWED.

[EXPLOSION]

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> Shepard: AND ANOTHER

50
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
CAMERA CAPTURED THE SCENE

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
MOMENTS RIGHT AFTER THE

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
FIRST BLAST ALONG WITH THE

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
SECOND EXPLOSION.

54
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
BOTH BLASTS CAME JUST

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
BEFORE 3:00 BOSTON TIME.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
THE LAST RUNNERS FINISHED

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
TIME IN THE MARATHON IS

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
LISTED OFFICIALLY AT

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
2:57 P.M.
THEN THE SECOND ONE WENT

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OFF, JUST DOWN THE STREET

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
FROM THE FIRST ONE.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
POLICE SAY ABOUT 100 YARDS

63
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
AWAY.
IT DETONATED APPROXIMATELY

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
12 TO 14 SECONDS AFTER THE

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
FIRST.
PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE SAY

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
THEY HAD NO IDEA EXACTLY

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
>> WE WERE COMING DOWN

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
BOYLSTON STREET AND

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
LITERALLY I HEARD A CANNON

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
GO OFF.
I SAW A WHOLE BUNCH OF

72
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
SMOKE.
IT KNOCKED ME TO THE

73
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
GROUND, AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
EVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING.

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
EVERYONE, ALL THE RUNNERS

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
STARTED SAYING RUN.

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AT US.

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
>> YOU START LOOKING AT ALL

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THE INJURIES AND YOU SEE

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
PEOPLE COMING OUT WITH NO

83
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
LEGS.

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
PEOPLE WERE NO ARMS.

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
PEOPLE, FACES AND BODIES

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
COVERED IN BLOOD.

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
>> Shepard: A SOURCE TELLS

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FOX NEWS THAT INVESTIGATORS

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
IN BOSTON ARE NOW GUARDING

90
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
A MAN THEY HAVE CALLED A

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
PERSON OF INTEREST.

92
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
GUARDING THIS PERSON AT A

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
HOSPITAL.

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONE.

95
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
WE'RE TOLD THAT PERSON HAS

96
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
SEVERE BURNS BUT

97
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY

98
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
CANNOT DETERMINE WITH

99
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CERTAINTY WHETHER HE WAS A

100
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
VICTIM OR AN ATTACKER.

101
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
AGAIN, AT THIS MOMENT, A

102
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
PERSON OF INTEREST IN A

103
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
HOSPITAL.

104
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AND POLICE SAY NOBODY HAS

105
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A

106
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SUSPECT.

107
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
IN THE LAST HOUR, PRESIDENT

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
OBAMA SAID THE COUNTRY WILL

109
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
FIND OUT WHO DID THIS.

110
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.

111
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
HERE IS ANOTHER ANGLE OF

112
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
THE FIRST EXPLOSION.

113
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
CAN YOU SEE ONE RUN ARER

114
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
FALL AS THE SMOKE FILLED

115
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
INTO THE AIR.

116
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
BOSTON POLICE SAY THERE WAS

117
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ALSO A FIRE AT JFK LIBRARY

118
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
IN THE DOOR CHESTER

119
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
POLICE NOW SAY AS OF THIS

121
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
MOMENT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
TO CONNECT IT TO THE

122
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
BOMBINGS.

123
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
THEY THINK IT WAS A FIRE,

124
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
UNRELATED.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THEY ARE STILL

126
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
INVESTIGATING.

127
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
NOBODY WAS HURT THAT -- IN

128
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
THAT FIRE.

129
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP OF

130
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THE AREA NOW SO YOU CAN GET

131
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED.

132
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THE BLASTS 200 FEET APART.

133
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
TWIN EXPLOSIONS ON

134
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
PATRIOT'S DAY IN BOSTON

135
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
WHEN PEOPLE WERE RUNNING

136
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THE MARATHON, FAMILIES AND

137
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
FRIENDS CHEERING THEM ON.

138
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
THOUSANDS PACKING THE

139
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
STREETS ON A HOLIDAY THERE.

140
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
AND IN AN INSTANT

141
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

142
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
"THE FOX REPORT'S"

143
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT
WAS ON AIR WITH US WHEN

144
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THIS HAPPENED AND HAS THE

145
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
LATEST INFORMATION FROM OUR

146
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
NEWSROOM.
JONATHAN?

147
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
>> SHEP, FIRST THE TIMING

148
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OF THIS.

149
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
THE LAST RUNNERS ACTUALLY

150
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
WERE RECORDED CROSSING THE

151
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
FINISH LINE AT 2:57 EASTERN

152
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
TIME THAT GIVES YOU A

153
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
PRETTY ACCURATE PICTURE OF

154
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
EXACTLY WHEN THOSE TWO

155
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
EXPLOSIONS RIPPED THROUGH

156
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
THE SCENE.

157
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
ONE FIRST, THEN ANOTHER.

158
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
ABOUT 14 SECONDS APART BY

159
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OUR COUNT AS WE LISTENED TO

160
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THE EXPLOSIONS ON THE VIDEO

161
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
THAT YOU SAW.

162
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
NOW, IT APPEARS ACCORDING

163
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
TO ALL THE EXPERTS THAT

164
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THEY WERE ON SOME SORT OF

165
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
TIMER DEVICE.

166
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
NOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN A

167
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TIMER ATTACHED TO EACH OF

168
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
THOSE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES BUT

169
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
MORE LIKELY, ACCORDING TO

170
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE EXPERTS I SPOKEN TO

171
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
THEY WERE REMOTELY

172
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
DETONATED, POSSIBLY USING

173
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
CELL PHONES.

174
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THAT IS WHY WE WERE TOLD AT

175
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THE TIME THAT CELL PHONE

176
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
TRAFFIC HAD BEEN SHUTDOWN.

177
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
ALTHOUGH A COUPLE OF THE

178
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
CELL PHONE COMPANIES SAID

179
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THAT THEY WERE NOT

180
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
REQUESTED TO DO SO.

181
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
BUT IT APPEARED TO A LOT OF

182
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
PEOPLE THAT CELL PHONES HAD

183
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BEEN BLOCKED.

184
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF

185
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.
THESE WERE NOT HUGE DEVICES

186
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
IN THAT SENSE.
BUT THEY WERE CLEARLY ABLE

187
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
TO DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO

188
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE PEOPLE MANY OF THEM

189
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
GATHERED THERE.

190
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THIS WAS THE FOUR HOUR MARK

191
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
OF THE MARATHON.

192
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THAT'S A TYPICALLY BUSY

193
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
TIME AT THE FINISH LINE,

194
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF

195
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
PEOPLE STILL CROWDED AROUND

196
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THE FINISH LINE.

197
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SPECTATORS AND THOSE WHO

198
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
HAD ALREADY COMPLETED THE

199
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
RACE AND WERE SIMPLY

200
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
WAITING FOR FRIENDS OR

201
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
RELATIVES TO COME IN.
WE HAVE HAD SOME WORD THAT

202
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THE BOMBS MAY HAVE BEEN

203
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
PACKED WITH BALL BEARINGS.

204
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

205
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THAT DOES A GREAT DEAL OF

206
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
DAMAGE TO HUMAN FLESH.

207
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THAT WOULD BE WHY WE ARE

208
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
HEARING THE REPORTS OF

209
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
HORRIFIC INJURIES,

210
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
INCLUDING MANY PEOPLE

211
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
LOSING THEIR LIMBS.

212
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
SO NOW THE INVESTIGATION

213
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
BEGINS.

214
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
THERE ARE THREE BASIC

215
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
QUESTIONS HERE.

216
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
WHO DID IT, HOW THEY DID

217
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
IT WHY THEY DID IT.

218
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE,

219
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
SHEP, AS YOU LOOK AT THE

220
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
SCENE OF THE EXPLOSIONS

221
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AGAIN IS TWO EXPLOSIONS,

222
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
TWO PEOPLE DEAD, MORE THAN

223
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
100 WOUNDED.

224
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AMONG THEM, CHILDREN WHO

225
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEIR

226
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
PARENTS TO SEE A SUPPORTING

227
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
EVENT ON THIS HOLIDAY IN

228
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
BOSTON SHEP.

229
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> Shepard: JONATHAN WHDH

230
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
TELEVISION, CHANNEL 7, THE

231
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
NBC STATION IN BOSTON IS

232
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
REPORTING THAT AMONG THE

233
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
TWO CONFIRMED DEAD IS AN

234
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
8-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

235
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY

236
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
CONFIRM THIS AND WE HAVEN'T

237
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
LEARNED TOO MUCH ABOUT THE

238
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
REST OF THE VICTIMS.

239
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
>> YEAH.
WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY

240
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
CONFIRM THAT, SHEP.

241
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WE HAD HEARD THAT REPORT.

242
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
WE ARE ALSO SEEING REPORTS

243
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL

244
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
MEDIA THERE.

245
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THAT THE CHILDREN'S

246
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
HOSPITAL IN BOSTON

247
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN

248
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
PATIENTS IT IS TREATING

249
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
FROM THIS.
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF

250
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
THEIR INJURIES.

251
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THERE ARE REPORTS OF

252
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
CHILDREN AT SOME OF THE

253
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OTHER HOSPITALS INVOLVED

254
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
HERE.
AS I SAY A TOTAL, WE ARE

255
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
TOLD, OF SOMETHING LIKE 105

256
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
PEOPLE TAKEN TO THE LOCAL

257
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
HOSPITALS AS A RESULT OF

258
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
THIS WHICH JUST SHOWS YOU

259
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
THE FORCE OF THOSE

260
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
EXPLOSIONS AND WHATEVER

261
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
SHRAPNEL THEY WERE PACKED

262
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WITH RIPPING THROUGH

263
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
EVERYBODY WHO WAS CROWDED

264
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
IN THAT AREA AT THAT TIME.

265
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
SHEP?

266
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
>> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW

267
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
THAN, I MENTIONED AT THE
TOP OF THIS NEWSCAST WE ARE

268
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WAITING FOR A BRIEFING FROM

269
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
OFFICIALS IN BOSTON.

270
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE

271
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
PODIUM WHERE THEY WILL BE

272
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
SPEAKING.
IT WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN

273
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
AT 7:00.

274
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
SO JUST ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES

275
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
AGO NOW.

276
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
AND WE ARE EXPECTING THAT

277
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
SHOULD BEGIN SHORTLY.

278
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
IN THE MEANTIME, JONATHAN,

279
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THE OBVIOUS BECAME CLEAR

280
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THESE

281
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
WERE SEPARATE EXPLOSIONS

282
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
WHEN WE KNEW THEY WERE

283
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
DEVICES THAT THIS WAS WHAT

284
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
AUTHORITIES IN THE WHITE

285
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
HOUSE IS NOW CALLING A

286
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
TERROR ATTACK.

287
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THE QUESTION IS, WHO AND

288
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
WITH WHAT MOTIVE AS YOU

289
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
JUST SAID.
WE DON'T YET HAVE ANSWERS

290
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
TO ANY OF THAT.

291
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
BUT SPECULATION HAS BEEN

292
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
RAMPANT BUT NOTHING FIRM AT

293
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
ALL.

294
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

295
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
FIRM WHATSOEVER.

296
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
AND THERE ARE THESE REPORTS

297
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THAT A PERSON OF INTEREST

298
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
MAY BE BEING GUARDED BY THE

299
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT IN

300
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
ONE OF THE HOSPITALS.

301
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WE DO NOT HAVE INDEPENDENT

302
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
CONFIRMATION OF WHO THIS

303
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
PERSON MIGHT BE.

304
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
OR EVEN WHETHER IT IS A MAN

305
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
OR A WOMAN AT THIS POINT.

306
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
BUT, OBVIOUSLY THE

307
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
INVESTIGATION ALREADY IN

308
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
HIGH GEAR.

309
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT

310
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
AGENCY INVOLVED RIGHT NOW.

311
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR

312
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ANSWERS.

313
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING

314
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
FIRST IS LOOKING AT THE

315
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

316
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
THEY WILL BE TAKING THEM

317
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
APART, SEEING HOW THEY WERE

318
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
PUT TOGETHER, WITH WHAT

319
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
MATERIALS THEY WERE PUT

320
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
TOGETHER.
THAT WILL GIVE

321
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
INVESTIGATORS A LOT OF

322
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
CLUES.
REMEMBER, WHEN THEY LOOK AT

323
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THESE THINGS, THEY TEND TO

324
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
SEE WHAT THEY CALL A

325
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
SIGNATURE OF A BOMB MAKER.

326
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THAT WILL LEAD THEM IN ONE

327
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
DIRECTION.
WE'LL FIND OUT IN GOOD

328
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
TIME SHEP.

329
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> Shepard: JONATHAN, THANK

330
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
YOU.
WE WILL BE BACK TO YOU AS

331
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
NEWS WARRANTS.

332
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
CATHERINE HERITAGE WORKS

333
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
INTELLIGENCE FOR US AND

334
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
LIVE IN OUR D.C. BUREAU.

335
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
IT'S MY STANDING THERE ARE

336
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
NO CREDIBLE CLAIMS OF

337
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
RESPONSIBILITY HERE.

338
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

339
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH

340
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
VARIOUS GROUPS SHEP.

341
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
THEY MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS

342
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
TO MONITOR THESE EXTREMIST

343
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
WEB SITES AND SO FAR THERE

344
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HAS BEEN NO CLAIM OF

345
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S

346
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
HAPPENED IN BOSTON.

347
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
JONATHAN, THOUGH, IS

348
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
TOUCHING ON AN IMPORTANT
POINT BECAUSE THE FORENSIC

349
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
INFORMATION, THIS BOSTON
MARATHON IS NOW A CRIME

350
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
SCENE.

351
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
AND I'M TOLD THE FBI

352
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
FOCUSES VERY MUCH ON TAKING

353
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THE RESIDUE FROM THESE

354
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
DEVICES, IDENTIFYING THE

355
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
EXPLOSIVES, THEN FINDING

356
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THE ORIGIN OF THOSE

357
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
EXPLOSIVES AND THEN LOOKING

358
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
FOR THAT BOMB MAKER'S

359
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
SIGNATURE.
EACH ONE OF THESE BOMB

360
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
MAKERS MAKES THESE DEVICES

361
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
IN A CERTAIN WAY.

362
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THE TYPE OF DETONATOR.

363
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
AND THEN SPECIFICALLY

364
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WHETHER THERE WAS SHRAPNEL.

365
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
A SHORT TIME AGO WE HEARD

366
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
FROM THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE

367
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE

368
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MIKE

369
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
MCCALL WHO CONFIRMED THAT

370
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HE IS GETTING REPORTS THAT

371
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THE DEVICES CONTAINED BALL

372
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
BEARINGS, SO SHRAPNEL.

373
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
THAT IS A CRITICAL MARKER

374
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
HERE.

375
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THE OTHER THING I WOULD

376
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS

377
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
THE FACT THAT THE

378
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
EXPLOSIONS WERE NEARLY

379
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
SIMULTANEOUS AND ABOUT 50

380
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
TO 100 YARDS APART.

381
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
WHAT HAS THE INTENTION OF

382
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
AT LEAST ONE SOURCE WHO IS

383
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION

384
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
IS THAT IT IS A STANDARD

385
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
PRACTICE TO HAVE THAT

386
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
INITIAL EXPLOSION WITH THE

387
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
IDEA THAT YOU WILL DRIVE

388
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
THE PUBLIC TOWARDS THE

389
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SECONDARY SITE WHICH IS, IN

390
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
FACT, A LARGER DEVICE SO

391
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
THAT CAN MAXIMIZE THE

392
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
CASUALTIES IN AN EVENT LIKE

393
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
THIS.
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE

394
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
DISCUSSING THIS AS AN ACT

395
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
OF TERRORISM FIRST

396
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
PRIVATELY AND NOW MORE

397
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
PUBLICLY WITH

398
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.

399
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A FINAL POINT WE JUST HAD

400
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
CONFIRMATION IN THE LAST
FEW MINUTES THAT THE FBI

401
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
AS WELL AS THE NCTC, THIS

402
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
IS THE NATIONAL COUNTER

403
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
TERRORISM CENTER, THIS IS

404
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
THE GROUP THAT WAS CREATED

405
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
AFTER 9/11 TO MONITOR

406
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
THREATS AGAINST THE UNITED

407
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
STATES WILL BE BRIEFING

408
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

409
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AS

410
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
EARLY AS TOMORROW.

411
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
SO WHAT THAT TIMING TELLS

412
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
YOU, SHEP FROM MY

413
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
EXPERIENCE, IS THAT THIS

414
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
THING IS REALLY ON FIRE,

415
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
THIS IS A PRESSING ACTIVE

416
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
INVESTIGATION.

417
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
IF THEIR GONNA HAVE

418
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
HEARINGS ON THE HILL AS

419
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
EARLY AS TOMORROW MORNING

420
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
SHEP.
>> Shepard: CATHERINE, JUST

421
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
FOR CLARITY, IS IT PROPER

422
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
TO SAY THAT IN THE EARLY

423
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
GOING, FROM YOUR REPORTING

424
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS

425
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
WAS SOME SORT OF TERRORIST

426
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
ORGANIZATION --

427
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
>> -- THAT'S CORRECT.

428
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
>> Shepard: WEATHER --

429
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
WHETHER IT WAS ONE PERSON

430
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
WITH A BEEF WITH A LOCAL

431
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
ISSUE IN BOSTON.

432
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
FRANKLY AT THIS MOMENT WE

433
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
KNOW THERE WAS AN ACT OF

434
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
TERROR BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK

435
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY AND

436
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THIS FITS THE DEFINITION
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER

437
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
QUOTE TERRORISTS WERE

438
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
INVOLVED.

439
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
>> THE DEFINITION OF

440
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
TERRORISM IS AN ACT OF

441
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
VIOLENCE TO PROMOTE A

442
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
POLITICAL END.
WHAT IS NOT CLEAR IS THAT

443
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
IS IT AN INDIVIDUAL?

444
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
IS IT A SMALL CELL OF

445
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
INDIVIDUALS?
ARE THEY DOMESTIC?

446
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
OR IS THERE AN

447
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT?

448
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE

449
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS THEY

450
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
MEET THAT THRESHOLD

451
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
DEFINITION OF TERRORISM.

452
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
SO YOU ARE CORRECT.

453
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
>> Shepard: EARLIER,
CATHERINE, AS THIS WAS

454
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
BREAKING.

455
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER

456
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THERE HAD BEEN UNUSUAL

457
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
SIGNS OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

458
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ABOUT WHETHER THE BOSTON

459
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
MARATHON MIGHT BE A TARGET.

460
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
AT THE TIME, THE ANSWER WAS

461
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
NO, THERE HADN'T BEEN.

462
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
IS THAT STILL THE CASE?

463
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> THAT IS STILL THE CASE.

464
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I HAVE SPOKEN TO A HALF

465
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
DOZEN PEOPLE SHEPARD WHO

466
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
WORK THIS ISSUE ON CAPITOL

467
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
HILL OR THEY ARE IN FEDERAL

468
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

469
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
SENSE I HAD FROM EVERY

470
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
CONVERSATION IS THAT THERE

471
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WAS NOTHING SPECIFIC OR

472
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
CREDIBLE AT LEAST INITIALLY

473
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THEY WERE SAYING TO ME THAT

474
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
THERE WAS A THREAT TO THE

475
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
BOSTON MARATHON.

476
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
HOWEVER, ONE OF THE THINGS

477
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

478
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
IS THEY ARE GOING BACK TO

479
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
THAT THREAD INFORMATION TO

480
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
SEE IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN

481
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
MISSED.
BUT, AGAIN, YOU HAVE THE

482
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
SENSE THAT PEOPLE WERE

483
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
SOMEWHAT BLINDSIDED BY WHAT

484
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
HAPPENED IN BOSTON TODAY

485
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
SHEPARD.
>> Shepard: ALL RIGHT,

486
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
CATHERINE.
WHEN YOU SAY BLINDSIDED,

487
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
SOMETIMES WHEN THEY ARE

488
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
BLINDSIDED, THAT COULD MEAN

489
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
THAT THIS ISN'T SOME BIG

490
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
GRAND -- THIS COULD BE A

491
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
COUPLE OF FOLKS OR A PERSON

492
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WITH A BACKPACK OR TWO.

493
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
>> UM-HUH.

494
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THIS

495
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
INFORMATION YET WHETHER WE

496
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL OR

497
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
INDIVIDUAL'S ASSOCIATION.
BUT TO SPEAK MORE BROADLY

498
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
ONE WITH OF THE ISSUES THE

499
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS

500
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
BEEN WRESTLING WITH,

501
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST TWO

502
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
TO THREE YEARS IS THE

503
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
EMERGENCE OF WHAT THEY CALL

504
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
THE INDIVIDUAL ACTOR OR

505
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
SMALL CELLS.

506
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

507
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO

508
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONS.

509
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY USE

510
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
THE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF

511
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
TALKING TO EACH OTHER

512
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO

513
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
INTERCEPT OR TO BLOCK THESES OF EVENTS

514
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
IN THE

515
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
PAST.
SO, I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN

516
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
ONE ROAD AS TO A SPECIFIC

517
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
GROUP.

518
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
BUT THIS HAS BEEN SEEN AS

519
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
THE EMERGING THREAT.

520
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THE INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL

521
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
CELL WHICH IS VERY HARD TO

522
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
INFILTRATE BY LAW

523
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ENFORCEMENT.

524
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
IN THIS CASE THE FBI

525
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
SHEPARD.

526
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
>> Shepard: CATHERINE
HERRIDGE, OUR INTELLIGENCE

527
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
CORRESPONDENT LIVE IN

528
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
WASHINGTON.

529
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
WE WILL BE BACK TO HER AS

530
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
EVENTS WARRANT.

531
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF
YOUR SCREEN THE WESTIN

532
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
HOTEL ADVERTISEMENT THERE

533
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
IS ACTUALLY THE SCENE OF A

534
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
NEWS CONFERENCE WHICH WILL

535
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HAPPEN CLEARLY AT THE

536
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WESTIN AT COPLY PLACE IN

537
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
BOSTON WHICH FRANKLY ISN'T

538
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ALL

539
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
OF THIS HAPPENED.

540
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
AUTHORITIES WERE TO BRIEF

541
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
US 13 MINUTES AGO.

542
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
THAT'S BEEN DISPLAYED FOR A

543
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
FEW MINUTES.

544
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WE

545
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
WILL TAKE YOU THERE WHEN IT

546
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
STARTS.

547
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
JOE DEFAZZIO WAS WORKING ON

548
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
COMMUNICATIONS AT THE RACE

549
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
AND WAS WORKING ON IT WHEN

550
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED

551
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THERE WAS ONE AS WE

552
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
REPORTED AND ANOTHER WHAT

553
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
APPEARED TO HIM TO BE THE

554
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
SAME INTENSITY.

555
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
SIR, IT'S NICE TO SPEAK

556
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
WITH YOU.

557
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THANK YOU.
>> HI, SHEPARD, HOW ARE

558
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
YOU?

559
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
>> Shepard: I'M DOING

560
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
PRETTY WELL.

561
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'M CURIOUS THOUGH ABOUT

562
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
WHAT THAT SCENE WAS LIKE IN

563
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
THE SECONDS BETWEEN AND IN

564
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
THE SECONDS AFTER THE

565
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
SECOND.

566
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
>> OH, IT WAS JUST -- THIS

567
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
IS A UNIQUE BOSTON EVENT

568
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
MARATHON, RED SOX GAME UP

569
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
THE STREET.

570
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
AND WENT FROM A GREAT I DO

571
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
HORRIFIC DAY IN MOMENTS TO

572
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
BE HONEST WITH YOU.

573
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I WAS 20 YARDS AWAY FROM

574
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION

575
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
WENT OFF WAITING FOR

576
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
FRIENDS OF MINE.

577
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
LOOKING FOR THEM.
YOU HEARD THE FIRST

578
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
EXPLOSION.
IT SOUNDED LIKE A CANNON

579
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
WENT OFF.

580
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

581
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
BEING PATRIOT'S DAY I

582
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE FIRED

583
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
A MUSKET AND I SAW THE

584
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
PLUME OF SMOKE AND I KNEW

585
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
SOMETHING WAS UP.

586
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S A GAS

587
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
EXPLOSION AND THEN MAYBE, I

588
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
DON'T KNOW, 10 TO 12

589
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
SECONDS LATER THE OTHER

590
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
EXPLOSION HAPPENED.

591
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I KNEW -- YOU KNOW, I KNEW

592
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
IT WASN'T -- I KIND OF HAD

593
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
AN IDEA IT WAS A TERRORIST

594
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
ACT AT THAT POINT.

595
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
>> Shepard: JOE, WE WERE IN

596
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
THE MIDDLE OF "STUDIO B"
WHEN THIS HAPPENED THIS

597
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
AFTERNOON AND THE FIRST

598
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
VIDEO CAME IN.

599
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
WE SAW THE KIND OF PICTURES

600
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND ON THE

601
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
INTERNET NOW.

602
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
BUT TO WHICH WE ARE NOT

603
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
GOING TO SUBJECT FAMILIES

604
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
AT FAMILY HOUR.

605
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
BUT I READ WITH INTEREST

606
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
YOUR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT
YOU WERE SEEING, THE

607
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
SPECIFICS THEREOF OF THOSE

608
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
WOUNDED.
IT SEEMS TO ME TO ELIMINATE

609
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
THAT FROM OUR REPORTING NOW

610
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THOUGH WE WON'T SHOW THE

611
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
PICTURES WOULD DO

612
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
DISSERVICE TO THE FACTS.

613
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD TELL

614
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
US WHAT YOU WITNESSED.

615
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
>> WELL, WHEN THE INCIDENT

616
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, A CREW

617
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
OF US WORKING AND I WAS THE

618
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
ONLY ONE THAT WAS OUTSIDE.

619
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I RACED BACK TOWARDS THE

620
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
PUBLIC LIBRARY WHERE WE HAD

621
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
ALL OUR EQUIPMENT TO MAKE

622
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
SURE THAT THE GUYS WERE

623
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
OKAY.
AND THE POLICE RUSHING US

624
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
OUT OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE

625
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE

626
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A DEVICE INSIDE THE

627
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
LIBRARY.

628
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
AND I LOOKED ACROSS THE

629
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
STREET AT THAT POINT AND IT

630
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
WAS JUST -- THE SIDEWALK

631
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
WAS, AGAIN WAS LIKE A SEA

632
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
OF BLOOD.

633
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
AND, I HUNG AROUND FOR A

634
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
FEW MOMENTS TO SEE IF I

635
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
COULD DO ANYTHING.

636
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
AND THE PROBLEM WAS HE --

637
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
THEY COULDN'T GET ANY

638
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
VEHICLES IN THERE BECAUSE

639
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
IT WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED

640
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
OFF AS IT USUALLY IS

641
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
BECAUSE OF THE MASS OF

642
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
RUNNERS.
>> Shepard: THAT'S WHY WE

643
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
SAW SOME PEOPLE BEING

644
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WHEELED AROUND IN

645
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
WHEELCHAIRS WITHOUT

646
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
AMBULANCES.

647
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
>> CORRECT.
THE RECOVERY TENT, WHICH

648
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
WAS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT MAYBE

649
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
100 YARDS DOWN THE ROAD,

650
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
YOU KNOW, USED AS A

651
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
RECOVERY TENT AND BEING

652
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
USED AS ALMOST A MAKESHIFT

653
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
HOSPITAL AND THEY COULDN'T

654
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
GET VEHICLES IN THERE.

655
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
SO IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT

656
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
PEOPLE THAT WAS INJURED TO

657
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
GET THEM OUT OF THE AREA

658
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
THEY HAD TO, EXACTLY USE

659
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THE WHEELCHAIR THAT THEY

660
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
USUALLY USE FOR RUNNERS

661
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM

662
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
FATIGUE OR WHATEVER I MEAN,

663
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
YOU KNOW, JUST HORRIFIC

664
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
INJURIES.

665
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
MOST OF THEM WERE LOWER

666
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
BODY INJURIES TO BE HONEST

667
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT

668
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
SHRAPNEL WAS THERE BUT IT

669
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
WAS AN UGLY SCENE.

670
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT WAS OUR

671
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SENSE IN WATCHING THIS THAT

672
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE

673
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
TRYING TO RISE ABOVE AND

674
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
GIVE A HAND THERE AT THE

675
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
TIME.
IT WAS REMARKABLE TO WATCH.

676
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I DID

677
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
THAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE AN

678
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE.

679
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
STUFF HAPPENS ALL OVER THE

680
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
WORLD AND YOU DON'T EXPECT

681
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
IT TO HAPPEN IN A CITY LIKE

682
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
BOSTON.

683
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
BUT IT CAN.
A GUY CAN JUST WALK DOWN

684
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
THE STREET AND PUT A

685
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
BACKPACK AND TRASH BARREL

686
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT AN

687
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
ENTIRE REGION IS JUST

688
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
BROUGHT TO GRIPS.

689
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
IT'S PRETTY SAD.

690
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
>> IT WAS CONFIRMED TO ADD

691
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
TO YOUR POINT WHAT WE HAVE

692
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000

GET ON TO GET ON A SUBWAY

695
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
BUSY STREET CORNER YOU KNOW

696
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
SECURITY IS TIGHT AND THEY

697
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN DO.

698
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000

TODAY IT HAS.

708
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
WE KNEW IT COULD AND NOW IT

709
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
HAS.
>> NO QUESTION.

710
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS AND I

711
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
THINK WE ALL LET OUR GUARD

712
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000

HIGH POLICE PRESENCE THERE.

717
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
IT JUST DOESN'T MATTER.

718
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000

ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, LIKE

TO GET TO THE SCENE OF THIS

794
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
HORROR.

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE

800
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
AROUND AT ALL.

801
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
SECURITY IS EXTREMELY

802
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
TIGHT.

803
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
THERE IS NO WAY REALLY TO

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
GET VEHICLES IN AND OUT OF

805
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
THERE, AT LEAST IN THE

806
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
EARLY GOING.
SO THEY ENDED UP USING

807
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
WHEELCHAIRS.
BUT PEOPLE BEGAN MAKING

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
DID THIS OR WHY.

818
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
AND PEOPLE SHOULDN'T JUMP

819
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
TO CONCLUSIONS BEFORE WE

820
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000

00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
BUT, MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
DID THIS.

825
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY THEY DID

826
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THIS.

827
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
ANY RESPONSIBLE

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
RESPONSIBLE GROUPS WILL
FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF

830
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
JUSTICE.

836
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000

ACT OF TERRORISM.

878

THE PRESIDENT DELIBERATELY

879
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
DID NOT USE THAT WORD IN

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
EXPLOSIONS GOING OFF IN

948
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
BOSTON.

949
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
JUST AS PRECAUTIONARY

950
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
MEASURES BUT THEY ARE ON

951
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
HIGHER GUARD.

952
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
>> PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES

953
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY AS

954
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
WELL.
IS IT YOUR SENSE THAT THIS

955
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
THIS NIGHT IS JUST

956
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
BEGINNING THERE.
>> YES.

957
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
>> Shepard: WE WILL HEAR

958
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
MORE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

959
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
ITSELF?

960
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
>> I DON'T THINK WE WILL

961
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
HEAR FROM WHITE HOUSE

962
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
OFFICIALS PUBLICLY.

963
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
YOU ARE RIGHT THAT IT'S

964
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
DOUBTFUL THE PRESIDENT

965
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
WOULD COME OUT A SECOND

966
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TIME UNLESS THERE WAS SOME

967
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENT.

968
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I THINK THEY ARE CONTENT

969
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
TONIGHT TO LETTED

970
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
INVESTIGATION GO FORWARD.

971
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
LET PEOPLE AROUND BOSTON

972
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
AND THE WORLD TO GRIEVE

973
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
TONIGHT.
WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY

974
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
THAT THE ENTIRE NATION IS

975
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
PRAYING TONIGHT FOR BOSTON.

976
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
THAT IS FOR SURE,

977
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
OBVIOUSLY.
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS

978
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
HAPPENING HERE, YES THEY

979
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
WILL BE TELLING ME THE

980
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
QUARTERBACK OF THIS

981
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
INVESTIGATION COORDINATING

982
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
IT INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE

983
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
AGAINST COORDINATING THE

984
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
FACT THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE

985
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE

986
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000

LEVEL NOT TO MENTION THE

990
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
FACT THAT YOU HAVE HAVE

991
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW

992
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
ENFORCEMENT AS WELL.
THIS IS A MASSIVE

993
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
INVESTIGATION.

994
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
AND THE LAST THING THE
WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO DO IS

995
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
INTERFERE WITH THAT THEY

996
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
WANT TO COORDINATE AS WELL

997
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
AS THEY CAN TO GET TO THE

998
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
BOTTOM OF THIS NUMBER ONE

999
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000

SHEP.
>> Shepard: ED HENRY AT THE

1004
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
WHITE HOUSE.

1005
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
ED, WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU

1006
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
AS UPDATES WARRANT
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

1007
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
WE NOW KNOW MEMBERS OF THE

1008
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
MILITARY ARE NOW INVOLVED

1009
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

1010
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THIS IS BREAKING NOW.

1011

1012
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
INFORMATION FROM THE

1013
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
NEWSROOM.
>> THE NAVY SENDING ONE OF

1014
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
ITS BOMB DISPOSAL UNITS TO

1015
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
ASSIST LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN

1016

THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY.

1021
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM

1022
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
BOSTON THEY WANT TO NOW GO

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE

MARATHON ROUTE 26.2 MILES

1025
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
TO CHECK OUT EVERY SINGLE

1026
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
PACKAGE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT

1027
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
ON THE SECRETS AROUND

1028
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
BOSTON.
WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOLD

1029
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
THAT THEY MAY HAVE FOUND

1030
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
SEVERAL UNEXPLODED DEVICES

1031
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
A COUPLE OF THOSE, ONE

1032
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
REPORT SAYS THREE

1033
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
UNEXPLODED DEVICES HAVE

1034
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
BEEN FOUND.

1035
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
NOW, IF THAT IS TRUE

1036
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
OBVIOUSLY, THAT WILL BE A

1037
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
TREASURE TROVE OF

1038
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000

1039
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
INVESTIGATORS.

1040
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE
SO MANY REPORTS OF SO MANY

1041
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
SUSPICIOUS DEVICES IN THE

1042
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
HOURS AND PERHAPS DAYS TO

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
COME THAT THE LOCAL

1044
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000

1045
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
HELP THEY CAN GET SO THE

1046
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
U.S. NAVY AS I SAY NOW

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
SENDING A BOMB DISPOSAL

1048
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
UNIT TO BOSTON TO HELP

1049
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
LOCAL AUTHORITIES THERE.

1050
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
SHEP?
>> Shepard: JONATHAN, THE

1051
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
OFFICIAL NUMBERS ARE AT THE

1052
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND

1053
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT THE

1054
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

1055
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
THOUGH THE FINE NEWS

1056
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
ORGANIZATION IN BOSTON AND
ASSOCIATED PRESS ARE WELL

1057
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
AHEAD OF THIS.
THE A.P. HAS 100.

1058
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
BOSTON.COM OR THE BOSTON

1059
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
HERALD -- I MEAN THE

1060
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
"BOSTON GLOBE," I'M SORRY

1061
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
IS AT 115 WITH TWO DEAD.

1062
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'M NOT SURE WE'RE POSITIVE

1063
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
YET OF EXACTLY HOW MANY

1064
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
INJURED AND OTHERWISE WE

1065
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
HAVE.

1066
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S

1067
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
COMPLETELY RELEVANT AT THE

1068
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
MOMENT ANYWAY.

1069
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
>> NO.

1070
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
IT SEEMS TO BE WE ARE IN

1071
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THE REGION OF 100 INJURED

1072
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
IN THIS.
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE

1073
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
SAFEST WAY TO PUT IT RIGHT

1074
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
NOW, SHEP.

1075
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
ONCE YOU GET TO THE LOWER

1076
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
END OF INJURIES, NOT EVERY

1077
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
ONE ACCOUNTED BY SOME

1078
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
ORGANIZATION.
THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT GET

1079
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
SOME DISCREPANCY 98 AND

1080
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
SEEING UP TO 115,000.

1081
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
IN TERMS OF THE DEAD, WE

1082
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
HAVE TWO CONFIRMED AND THE

1083
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE NEWS

1084
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
TONIGHT THAT WE ARE GETTING

1085
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE

1086
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
CONFIRMED DEAD IS AN

1087
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
8-YEAR-OLD BOY SHEP.

1088
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
WE HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT THE

1089
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
YOUNGEST VICTIM INJURED IN

1090
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
THIS WAS A 3-YEAR-OLD.

1091
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
JUST KIDS WHO AS I WAS

1092
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
SAYING EARLIER WERE TAKEN

1093
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
BY THEIR PARENTS TO SEE

1094
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A

1095
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
JOYFUL SPORTING EVENT ON A

1096
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
HOLIDAY IN BOSTON.

1097
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN BOSTON

1098
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
AND THIS AS YOU SEE THERE

1099
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
WAS THE TRAGIC SCENE THAT

1100
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
WE ENDED UP WITH.

1101
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
CHILDREN ABOUT HALF A DOZEN

1102
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WE ARE HEARING AT THE

1103
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
MOMENT AMONGS INJURED AS I

1104
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
SAY ONE 8-YEAR-OLD BOY

1105
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
CONFIRMED DEAD TONIGHT

1106
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
SHEP.

YOU.
WE WILL BE BACK TO YOU

1108
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
SHORTLY.

1109
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
HAPPENED TODAY AND GIVE YOU

1110
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
COMPLEX.

1111
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
THESE HAPPENED A FEW
SECONDS APART AND THEN A

1112
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
LITTLE MORE THAN 1 HOUR AND

1113
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
20 MINUTES LATER THERE WAS

1114
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
THIS FIRE AND SOMETHING

1115
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
THAT WENT BOOM AT THE JFK

1116
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
LIBRARY IN THE DOOR CHESTER

1117
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
SECTION.

1118
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
WE HAVE MORE CLARITY ON
THAT NOW.

1119
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
WE HAVE MORE SPECIFICS.

1120
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY WAS

1121
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
FINE THERE.

1122
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THE FIRE STARTED ACTUALLY

1123
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
JUST AFTER 3:00 P.M.

1124
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
SO JUST MINUTES LATER

1125
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
FRANKLY.
IN THE VICINITY OF H HAVE

1126
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
BUILDING OPENED IN 2011

1127
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
THAT HOUSES OFFICES IN THE

1128
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
CLASSROOM AND THE REST.

1129
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THERE WAS A FIRE.

1130
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
PEOPLE THERE SOUNDED LIKE

1131
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
AN EXPLOSION SO WE REPORTED

WE WILL GET PEOPLE OUT OF
THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS.

1375
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
>> Shepard: THAT IS HOW IT

1376
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
ALL WENT DOWN WITH THE

1377
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
FINAL WORD OF EXACTLY HOW

1378
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
THINGS WERE GOING TO

1379
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
PROCEED.

1380
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
HANG WITH ME.
THOSE RECORDINGS WERE FROM

1381
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
POLICE DISPATCH CHANNELS

1382
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000

1383
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
CLEAR THAT RESPONDERS WERE

1384
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
DEALING WITH AN ACT OF

1385
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
TERROR.
THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH

1386
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
NUMEROUS DRILLS TO THEY

1387
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
TELL US TO PREPARE FOR THIS

1388
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
SORT OF THING.
SO FOR THOSE FIRST

1389
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
RESPONDERS AND THE REST,

1390
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
THIS WAS PART OF A ROUTINE

1391
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
THAT HAS COME THROUGH THE

1392
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
DRILLS.

1393
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
WE SPOKE WITH PEOPLE AT

KNEW WHAT WOULD GO DOWN.

1403
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
WE EXPECTED THESE SORTS OF

1404
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
THINGS.

1405
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
WE WERE READY FOR THIS.

1406
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
IN FACT, AT MASS GENERAL.

1407
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
BOSTON'S MASS GENERAL

1408
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
HOSPITAL THEY SAID THEY

1409
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
WERE READY FOR MORE WOUNDED

1410
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
THAT THE OPERATING ROOMS

1411
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
WERE KEPT OPEN THAT THIS

1412
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
WENT ACCORDING TO PLAN FROM

1413
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
THE TERROR DRILLS THAT HAD

1414
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
TAKEN PLACE IN THE WAKE OF

1415
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
THE ATTACKS ON OUR COUNTRY

1416
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
AND OTHERWISE.

1417
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
FOR THE BOSTON MARATHON

1418
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
THEY HAD PREPARED WELL WITH

1419
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
THE HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY

1420
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
MANAGERS.
THEY GOT PEOPLE TO THOSE

1421
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
HOSPITALS WHICH WE HOPE

1422
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
WILL RESULT IN VERY FEW

1423
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
NUMBERS OF LOSS OF LIFE.

1424
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
OF COURSE, IF IT'S SOMEONE

1425
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
YOU KNOW, THE NUMBER IS

1426
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
ALREADY WAY TOO HIGH.

1427
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
OF COURSE, THE DEADLY

1428
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
TERROR ATTACK THERE IN
BOSTON IS RAISING CONCERNS

1429
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
ABOUT SECURITY ACROSS THE

1430
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
NATION.

1431
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE
PREPARING AND HAVE ALREADY

1432
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
BEGUN TO RAISE SECURITY.

1433
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
WILY IS A FORMER DIRECTOR

1434
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
FOR THE NATIONAL THREATS ON

1435
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THE NATIONAL SECURITY

1436
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
COUNCIL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

1437
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
HE IS THE PRESIDENT UNDER

1438
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
PRESIDENT CLINTON AND

1439
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
GEORGE W. BUSH AND HE IS

1440
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
WITH US NOW ON THE PHONE.

1441
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
LEE, FOLKS LIKE YOU ARE

1442
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
BUSY RIGHT NOW.

1443
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
>> YES, GOOD EVENING SHEP.

1444
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
>> Shepard: WHERE ARE WE IN

1445
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
THE PROCESS?

1446
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE

1447
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
FIRST STEP IS TO CARE FOR

1448
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
THE INJURED AND TO CARE FOR

1449
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
THEIR FAMILIES OF THE

1450
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
CASUALTY TODAY.
AND THE SECOND STEP IS TO

1451
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
TURN TOWARDS THE

1452
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
INVESTIGATION AND FIGURE
OUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

1453
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
>> Shepard: IT'S MY

1454
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
STANDING FROM SECURITY

1455
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
TYPES THAT THERE ARE

1456
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
SIGNATURES THAT THEY WILL

1457
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
KNOW QUICKLY IF THEY DON'T

1458
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
ALREADY WHETHER THIS IS
SOME ORGANIZED GROUP WHO

1459
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
DOES THIS FOR A LIVING OR

1460
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
SOMETHING HIS.

1461
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
>> RIGHT.
I MEAN, I THINK HA THERE IS

1462
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
SOME INDICATIONS THAT THERE

1463
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
IS PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE I

1464
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
HAD INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF

1465
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
MULTIPLICITY OF GUYS THE

1466
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
FACT THAT THEY HAD TO BE

1467
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
PLACED AT DIFFERENT

1468
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
LOCATIONS THAT REQUIRED

1469
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
SOME COORDINATION.

1470
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
WHO ARE THEY?
ARE THEY PURELY DOMESTIC?

1471
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
ARE THEY DOE MESS STWIK

1472
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT?

1473
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?

1474
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
ORGANIZED INTERNATIONAL

1475
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
ATTACK?
I THINK THE CHANCES OF THAT

1476
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
LAST POSSIBILITY ARE
PROBABLY PRETTY SLIM AND IT

1477
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
PROBABLY ONE OF TWO FLAVORS

1478
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
OF DOMESTIC ATTACK.

1479
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
PURELY DOMESTIC SUCH AS THE

1480
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
OLYMPICS IN 1996 OR EVEN

1481
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
OKLAHOMA CITY IN 1995.

1482
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
OR DOMESTIC WITH AN

1483
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT IE

1484
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
SOMEBODY WHO IS BORN HERE

1485
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
AND LIVED HERE AND

1486
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
RADICALIZED ABROAD.

1487
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
>> Shepard: LEE, I WONDER

1488
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE

1489
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
SOME NUT JOB WHO JUST

1490
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
WANTED TO CAUSE A BIG SHOW?

1491
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY

1492
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
CLARITY IN THIS MATTER.

1493
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1494
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
ANOTHER MATTER TO POINT OUT

1495
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
IT'S A LOCAL HOLIDAY IN

1496
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
MASSACHUSETTS AND CERTAIN

1497
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND

1498
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
PATRIOTS DAY.
THAT HOLIDAY COMMON RATES

1499
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
THE BATTLES OF LEXINGTON

1500
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
AND CONQUERORS FIRST

1501
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
REVOLUTIONARY WAR 1775.

1502
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
IT'S POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH

1503
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

1504
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
SPECULATION THAT IT IS --

1505
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
HARD TO KNOW BUT IT IS

1506
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
THAT -- IT DOES HAVE

1507
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
SIGNIFICANCE IN THE REGION

1508
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
IN BOSTON.

1509
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
>> Shepard: REALLY, WHEN WE

1510
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
WENT THROUGH THE TRIAL, I

1511
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
COVERED THE OKLAHOMA CITY

1512
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
BOMBING AND THEN THE TRIAL

1513
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
OF TIMOTHY MCVEIGH WHICH

1514
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
FOLLOWED, AND THERE IS NO

1515
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
QUESTION THAT THE REASON

1516
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
THAT THAT HAPPENED AT THAT

1517
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
TIME HAD SOMETHING TO DO

1518
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
WITH THE ATTACKS AT WACO

1519
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
AND BEYOND.
TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE

1520
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
TALKING ABOUT THIS DATE, IT

1521
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
IS JUST IN A VACUUM WITHOUT

1522
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
HISTORICAL CONTEXT IS
REALLY TO MISS THE FACTS

1523
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
HERE.
IN THE PAST THAT HAS

1524
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
HAPPENED.
IT'S NOT TO SAY IT HAS

1525
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
HAPPENED AT THIS TIME BUT
IN THE PAST IT HAS.

1526
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

1527
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
OBVIOUSLY THE TARGET, THE

1528
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
BOSTON MARATHON IS A

1529
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
SIGNIFICANT EVENT FOR
BOSTON AND IT IS AN

1530
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
INTERNATIONAL EVENT IN THE

1531
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
SENSE THAT IT DRAWS

1532
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS

1533
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
AND VERY IMPORTANT RACE.

1534
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
BUT IT IS NOT A TARGET OF

1535
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL

1536
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
SIGNIFICANCE SUCH AS A --

1537
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER OR

1538
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
EVEN THE OLYMPIC GAMES.

1539
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
>> Shepard: RIGHT.
IF I MIGHT GO ONE FARTHER

1540
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS

1541
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
THE REASON FOR ANYTHING.

1542
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
ONE REASON WE KNOW ABOUT

1543
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
THE BOSTON MARATHON IS

1544
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THERE WILL BE CAMERAS

1545
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
EVERYWHERE.

1546
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT

1547
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
NEWS EVENTS IS TO MAKE THEM

1548
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
HAVE IMPACT YOU NEED TO

1549
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
HAVE VIDEO OF IT HAPPENING.

1550
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
AS IT SO HAPPENS OR BY

1551
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
DESIGN, ONE OR THE OTHER

1552
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
THESE EXPLOSIONS HAPPENED

1553
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
AS CAMERAS WERE RUNNING ON

1554
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
THE SIDELINES AND AS

1555
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
CHOPPERS FLEW IN THE AIR.

1556
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
>> RIGHT.

1557
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
RIGHT.

1558
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
CLEARLY IT WAS A

1559
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
WELL-PLANNED ATTACK, AS I

1560
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
SAID, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.

1561
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I WANT TO CONTINUE WITH

1562
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THESE PICTURES.

1563
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

1564
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
REMEMBER.
IF YOU ARE PLANNING AN

1565
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
EVENT OF ANY KIND, YOU HAVE

1566
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
SOME SORT OF GOAL IN MIND.

1567
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
PLANNING AN EVENT WHICH

1568
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
WAS A BOMBING AND YOU WANT

1569
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED, THEN

1570
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
YOU WOULD DO THAT THEN YOU

1571
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
WILL BE POSITIVE THERE WERE

1572
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
CAMERAS THERE TO RECORD IT,

1573
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
RIGHT?

1574
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
THAT'S NOT A MATTER OF

1575
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
SPECULATION.

1576
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

1577
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
AND TODAY TO HAVE IT AT

1578
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
THE FINISH LINE OF THE

1579
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
BOSTON MARATHON.

1580
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
WHOEVER PUT THOSE BOMBS

1581
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
THERE WAS -- COULD SAY WITH

1582
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
GREAT CERTAINTY THAT THERE

1583
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
WOULD BE CAMERAS ON THIS

1584
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
EVENT.
AND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY

1585
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
QUICK AND EASY TO GET LIVE

1586
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
COVERAGE AFTERWARDS AND

1587
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THAT THERE WOULD BE A

1588
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
RECORD OF WHAT YOU DID THAT

1589
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
WOULD LAST FOR GENERATIONS

1590
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
BEYOND ANY OF US.

1591
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
THIS PICTURE RIGHT NOW IS

1592
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
FOREVER WHAT HAPPENED ON --

1593
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
IN BOSTON ON PATRIOTS DAY

1594
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
IN 2013.

1595
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WERE

1596
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
THERE AND RECORDED IT

1597
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
HAPPEN.

1598
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
WERE I TELLING YOU ABOUT IT

1599
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
NOW, AND EXPLAINING TO YOU

1600
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
THAT THERE WERE MASS

1601
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
CASUALTIES AND THE SCENE

1602
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
WAS CHAOTIC WOULD NOT HAVE

1603
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
NEARLY THE IMPACT ON THE

1604
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
COLLECTIVE PSYCHE THAT THIS

1605
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
VIDEO DOES.

1606
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

1607
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
THERE BUT NOT FOR THE REST

1608
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
OF US.

1609
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
IF THERE HADN'T BEEN VIDEO

1610
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER

1611
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
ATTACK AS A SEPARATE AND

1612
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
NOT RELATED IN ANYWAY WE

1613
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT

1614
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
COLLECTIVE MEMORIES.

1615
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE AND

1616
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
THEY CAME FROM THE

1617
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
TELEVISION IMAGES.

1618
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
THIS IS WHAT WE WILL
REMEMBER FROM HERE.

1619
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
WHOEVER PLANTED THOSE

1620
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
BOMBS, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION
KNEW THAT ON THE PHONE WITH

1621
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
US NOW THE RUNNER DEMI

1622
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
CLARK, SHE WAS RUNNING THE

1623
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
MARATHON, SAYS SHE WAS JUST

1624
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
CROSSING THE FINISH LINE AS

1625
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
THE BOMB BLAST ROCKED THE

1626
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
STREET.
DEMI, HOW ARE YOU?

1627
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
ARE YOU SAFE?

1628
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
>> YES WE'RE AT OUR HOTEL

1629
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW.

1630
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
>> Shepard: SO YOU ARE

1631
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
CROSSING THE FINISH LINE.

1632
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
AND, AS YOU DID WAS PART

1633
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
OF YOUR THINKING THAT MAYBE

1634
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
THIS IS PART OF A PATRIOTS

1635
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
DAY CELEBRATION OR BECAUSE

1636
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
YOU HAD CROSSED IT WAS

1637
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
CLEARLY BEHIND YOU, WHAT

1638
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
WAS YOUR THINKING?

1639
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
>> HONESTLY, IT WAS.

1640
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I THINK -- I LITERALLY HIT

1641
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
THE FINISH LINE AS IT

1642
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
HAPPENED AND LOOKED AT AN

1643
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
OFFICIAL WHO WAS FACING

1644
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
THAT WAY AND HE HAD THIS

1645
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
LOOK OF HORROR ON HIS FACE.

1646
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
AND SO I KNEW IT WASN'T

1647
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
RIGHT.

1648
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
IT JUST KIND OF EXPLODED

1649
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
ALL OUR EARDRUMS, TOO.

1650
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
SO IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

1651
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
WE KNEW IT WASN'T RIGHT.

1652
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
>> Shepard: HUH.
AND AFTER THAT HAPPENED,

1653
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
THE MOMENTS AFTER THE FIRST

1654
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
BLAST, WHAT DID YOU DO AND

1655
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE

1656
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
SECOND HIT?

1657
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
>> I WAS LOOKING TO THE

1658
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
LEFT AND SAW JUST CARNAGE.

1659
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I MEAN SOMETHING OUT OF A

1660
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
WAR ZONE.
IT WAS PEOPLE UP AGAINST

1661
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
FENCES.

1662
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
BLOOD EVERYWHERE.
RUN ARERS DOWN TO MY LEFT.

1663
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
AND GLASS AND THEN THE

1664
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
OTHER EXPLOSION WENT OF

1665
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
OFF.

1666
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
MY FAMILY WAS IN THE

1667
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
BLEACHER SECTION.

1668
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
MY THREE OUTCOME DAUGHTERS

1669
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
AND MY HUSBAND.

1670
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OH MY

1671
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
GOODNESS ANOTHER ONE COULD

1672
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
GO OFF.

1673
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
HOW DO I GET THEM OUT OF

1674
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?

1675
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
>> Shepard: AND THEN

1676
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
ANOTHER ONE DID?

1677
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
>> YES.

1678
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
AND AWAY FROM US BUT

1679
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
IMMEDIATELY I JUST THOUGHT

1680
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WAS

1681
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
MOTHER'S INSTINCT IS WHAT

1682
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
CAN I DO TO GET MY KIDS OUT

1683
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
OF HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE

1684
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
SEVEN AND NINE AND DON'T

1685

1864
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
CERTAINLY IN THIS CASE IT

1865
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
SOUNDS LIKE THE SHRAPNEL

1866
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
WAS ALL INCLUDED.

1867
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
THE THING WITH THESE BOMBS

1868
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS SO

1869
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
MUCH ENERGY CONTAINED IN

1870
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
SUCH A TINY AMOUNT OF

1871
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
CHEMICAL THAT YOU CAN DO

1872
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE WITH

1873
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,
ESSENTIALLY THE SIZE OF A

1874
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
TENNIS BALL.

1875
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
>> Shepard: AND NOW A
MATTER TO PUT IT ALL BACK

1876
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
TOGETHER.
THANK YOU.

1877
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I NEED TO GET --
>> -- OF COURSE.

1878
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
FINDING OUT WHAT IT WAS

1879
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
ISN'T REALLY THE GOAL.

1880
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
THE GOAL IS FINDING OUT WHO

1881
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
DID IT AND WHY.

1882
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
>> Shepard: AND FROM

1883
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
FINDING OUT WHAT IT WAS YOU

1884
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
CAN FIND OUT THE SIGNATURE

1885
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
OF SOME GROUPS, AT LEAST

1886
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TOLD

1887
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
US FROM THE FBI TODAY.

1888
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
WE HAVE TO HIT A QUICK

1889
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
COMMERCIAL BREAK.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK

1890
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000

Verizon innovators  are building a
world of

1899
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
medical treatment data  in the cloud.

1900
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So doctors can make  a more informed

1901
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000

1903
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
rather than months.

1904
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Because the world's  biggest challenges

1905
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
deserve even  bigger solutions.

1906
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Powerful answers.

WHERE WE JUST CAME FROM IS

1959
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
STUNNING.

1960
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND

1961
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
THOUSANDS OF YELLOW BAGS.

1962
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
THESE ARE BAGS OF PERSONAL

1963
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
POSSESSIONS THAT BELONG TO

1964
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
EACH OF THE THEY'RE NONE

1965
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
RUNNERS.
WHAT THEY WILL DO AT THESE

1966
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
RACES AND S. PREPOSITION

1967
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
THEIR PERSONAL BELONGINGS

1968
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
SO WHEN THEY FINISH THE

1969
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
RACE THEY HAVE SOMETHING IT

1970
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
TO RETURN TO.

1971
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
SOMETHING TO PUT ON A

1972
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
CHANGE OF CLOTHES.
THERE ARE THOUSANDS

1973
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
STRANDED WITHOUT THOSE

1974
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
POSSESSIONS TONIGHT.
THEY TRICKLE IN ONE AFTER

1975
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
ANOTHER.
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

1976
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
CLEARLY WILL NOT BE TAKEN

1977
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
CARE OF TONIGHT SHEPARD.

1978
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I TALKED TO ONE YOUNG MAN

1979
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
WHO CAME IN FROM ST. LOUIS

1980
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
MISSOURI.
HE WAS A QUARTER MILE

1981
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
BEHIND THE FINISH LINE,

1982
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
FINISHING HIMSELF WHEN THE

1983
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
EXPLOSION OCCURRED BUT HE

1984
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
NEVER HEARD THE EXPLOSION.

1985
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
HE SAID THERE WERE

1986
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ON BOTH

1987
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
SIDES OF THE STREETS AND

1988
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
THEIR CHEERING WAS SO LOUD

1989
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
IT DROWNED OUT THE SOUND OF

1990
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
THE EXPLOSION A QUARTER

1991
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
MILE DOWN THE ROAD.

1992
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
WHAT HE DESCRIBED IS IS THE

1993
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
ENTIRE RACE JUST STOPPED IN

1994
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
FRONT OF HIM AND HE STOPPED

1995
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
TOO AND THEY WERE TOLD THE

1996
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
RACE WILL NOT GO ON ANY

1997
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
LONGER.
A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM

1998
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THE FINISH.

1999
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
TONIGHT, I ASKED HIM WHAT

2000
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE NEWS

2001
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
AFTER IT WENT OUT

2002
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND

2003
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HE

2004
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
TALKED ABOUT HIS OWN

2005
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO

2006
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
WANTED TO BE HERE AT THE

2007
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
