[000:01:14;007] OPTIONS TO RESPOND TO THIS
[000:01:16;309] WEEK'S ATROCITIES IN SYRIA, AS
[000:01:19;379] THE WHITE HOUSE COMES UNDER
[000:01:20;046] INCREASING PRESSURE TO ACT.
[000:01:21;981] THOSE HORRIBLE IMAGES OF
[000:01:24;751] LIFELESS CIVILIANS KILLED BY
[000:01:26;553] WHAT THE REBELS SAY WERE
[000:01:28;455] CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:01:30;123] HAS SPARKED INTERNATIONAL
[000:01:31;224] OUTRAGE.
[000:01:31;558] AS THE U.S. OFFICIALS ARE TRYING
[000:01:32;292] TO CONFIRM THE NATURE OF THE
[000:01:33;827] ATTACK, NBC NEWS HAS SPOKEN TO
[000:01:34;561] ONE OF THE DOCTORS ON THE GROUND
[000:01:36;196] TREATING THE VICTIMS.
[000:01:36;763] HE SAYS THE WORLD IS IGNORING
[000:01:37;464] THEM.

[000:01:41;534] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:01:43;636] CHUCK, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN.
[000:01:45;972] IS AMERICA ABOUT TO GET INVOLVED
[000:01:46;706] IN SYRIA?
[000:01:48;608] >> Reporter: WELL, LESTER, IT
[000:01:50;643] LOOKS LIKE IN SOME FORM.
[000:01:53;880] THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE
[000:01:56;249] LEANING EVERY ON SENDING SOME
[000:01:58;885] SORT OF STRIKE.
[000:01:59;986] THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES THAT
[000:02:00;854] MILITARY OPTION LOOK LIKE?
[000:02:03;623] RIGHT NOW THAT'S UNCLEAR AND THE
[000:02:05;592] PRESIDENT'S CLOSEST ADVISERS
[000:02:07;760] ARE DIVIDED ON THE OPTIONS THAT
[000:02:08;495] ARE IN FRONT OF THEM.
[000:02:09;062] IT IS THESE HEART-WRENCHING
[000:02:11;664] IMAGES OUT OF SYRIA,
[000:02:13;633] LIFELESS BODIES, MANY OF THEM
[000:02:15;635] CHILDREN, ALLEGEDLY
[000:02:16;536] VICTIMS OF BRUTAL CHEMICAL
[000:02:18;538] WEAPON ATTACKS THAT ACCELERATED
[000:02:19;272] THE DEBATE IN WASHINGTON.
[000:02:20;840] >> WE ARE RIGHT NOW GATHERING
[000:02:22;242] INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
[000:02:22;842] PARTICULAR EVENT.
[000:02:27;013] WHAT WE HAVE SEEN INDICATES THAT
[000:02:27;747] THIS IS CLEARLY A BIG EVENT OF
[000:02:28;481] GRAVE CONCERN.
[000:02:29;682] >> Reporter: JUST HOW GRAVE
[000:02:30;884] BECOMING MORE CLEAR TONIGHT.

[000:02:34;821] INSIDE SYRIA TREATING SOME OF
[000:02:36;356] THOSE VICTIMS.
[000:02:38;958] FEARING FOR HIS OWN LIFE, HE
[000:02:39;826] WOULD NOT GO ON CAMERA.
[000:02:43;596] >> DIED VIOLENTLY WHILE SLEEPING
[000:02:46;799] AND DIED HUNGRY.
[000:02:48;101] >> DOCTOR, AFTER THIS
[000:02:49;135] EXPERIENCE, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE
[000:02:49;869] TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD?
[000:02:53;239] >> CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A SHAME
[000:02:56;509] ON THE FACE OF HUMANITY.
[000:03:00;113] I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE
[000:03:03;249] INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CANNOT
[000:03:06;920] DO ANYTHING EXCEPT MEETING AND
[000:03:07;654] PROMISING.
[000:03:10;723] IS THIS THE TRUTH?
[000:03:11;457] IS THIS REAL?
[000:03:12;659] >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:03:14;994] CONSIDERING A VERY NARROW RANGE
[000:03:16;229] OF MILITARY OPTIONS.
[000:03:17;830] BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR A NO-FLY
[000:03:18;932] ZONE, BOTH ARE OUT OF THE
[000:03:19;899] QUESTION.
[000:03:23;736] WHAT IS ON THE TABLE, LIMITED
[000:03:24;537] AIR STRIKES, MOST LIKELY CRUISE
[000:03:25;838] MISSILES LAUNCHED FROM NAVY
[000:03:28;942] DESTROYERS TARGETING
[000:03:30;210] KEY ASSAD MILITARY
[000:03:32;078] COMMAND POSTS AND WHILE THE U.S.
[000:03:33;980] AND WHILE THE U.S.
[000:03:34;514] IS STILL GATHERING EVIDENCE,
[000:03:35;215] EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.
[000:03:37;116] >> THIS IS QUITE POWERFUL AND
[000:03:39;052] CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS
[000:03:42;989] NOT BEEN FAKED.
[000:03:44;857] RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT
[000:03:46;859] SAID REPEATEDLY THE USE OF
[000:03:47;994] CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY BASHAR
[000:03:50;430] AL ASSAD WOULD CROSS THE RED
[000:03:51;130] LINE.
[000:03:51;497] AND IT IS THE PUBLIC PLEDGE
[000:03:52;165] COUPLED WITH THE HORRIFIC
[000:03:53;433] PICTURES THAT PROMPTED SENIOR
[000:03:54;133] OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER SPECIFIC
[000:03:56;669] MILITARY RESPONSES, EVEN AS THE
[000:03:57;403] PRESIDENT PREACHES CAUTION.
[000:03:58;371] >> SOMETIMES WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
[000:04:02;709] IS THAT FOLKS WILL CALL FOR
[000:04:07;880] IMMEDIATE ACTION, JUMPING INTO
[000:04:08;615] STUFF THAT DOES NOT TURN OUT
[000:04:09;315] WELL.
[000:04:10;016] >> Reporter: BUT DEMAND TO DO
[000:04:10;717] SOMETHING IS GROWING.
[000:04:13;152] >> WHEN DOES THE UNITED STATES,
[000:04:15;722] WITH VERY LITTLE COST, STAND UP
[000:04:16;589] FOR THESE PEOPLE?
[000:04:18;057] >> Reporter: ONE PENTAGON
[000:04:19;659] OFFICIAL TOLD NBC'S JIM
[000:04:20;693] MIKLASZEWSKI, IF THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:22;161] WANTS TO SEND A MESSAGE, WE ARE
[000:04:23;363] GOOD AT SENDING MESSAGES.
[000:04:25;665] BUT IF HE WANTS REGIME CHANGE,
[000:04:27;700] WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
[000:04:28;368] EASILY.
[000:04:28;901] KEY PRESIDENTIAL AIDES ARE SPLIT
[000:04:29;636] OF HOW TO RESPOND.
[000:04:33;039] AS THE INTERNAL DEBATE
[000:04:34;807] ABOUT SYRIA HAS
[000:04:37;010] DEVELOPED OVER MONTH,
[000:04:38;278] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
[000:04:40;647] SUSAN RICE AND
[000:04:43;516] AND DENIS McDONOUGH HAVE URGED
[000:04:44;951] AGGRESSIVE ACTION.
[000:04:48;921] DEMPSEY EXPRESSED RELUCTANCE.
[000:04:49;922] SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
[000:04:50;623] INITIALLY AGGRESSIVE AND
[000:04:51;357] SOFTENED UNTIL THE LATEST
[000:04:51;991] PICTURES EMERGED AND TODAY IS
[000:04:52;692] ADVOCATING AN AGGRESSIVE
[000:04:53;326] RESPONSE.
[000:04:53;793] BUT NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL THERE
[000:04:54;527] ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE
[000:04:55;128] DETERMINED.
[000:04:58;931] NUMBER ONE, THAT THE U.S. GETS
[000:04:59;732] ACTUAL PROOF THAT ASSAD USED
[000:05:00;433] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:05:02;869] THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND,
[000:05:04;504] SECOND, THEY NEED TO HAVE A
[000:05:05;405] LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.
[000:05:06;806] LESTER, FOR INSTANCE, IN LIBYA,
[000:05:08;274] THERE WAS A U.N. RESOLUTION TO
[000:05:09;442] ENFORCE.
[000:05:11;544] HERE IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW, THERE
[000:05:12;278] IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ON THE
[000:05:12;945] TABLE.
[000:05:13;413] >> ALL RIGHT.
[000:05:14;080] CHUCK TODD LEADING US OFF

[000:05:15;348] THANKS.
[000:05:16;783] >>> NOW TO THE WAR AT HOME AND
[000:05:18;251] THE SHIFTING BATTLE FRONT IN
[000:05:19;585] THIS SEASON OF WILDFIRES.
[000:05:20;853] TONIGHT, THE MASSIVE
[000:05:22;522] MOBILIZATION OF EQUIPMENT AND
[000:05:24;357] MANPOWER WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING
[000:05:25;625] ACROSS THE WEST THE LAST FEW
[000:05:27;160] WEEKS IS ON THE MOVE TO
[000:05:31;197] CALIFORNIA AND WHAT HAS NOW
[000:05:31;964] BECOME THE COUNTRY'S MOST
[000:05:32;765] DANGEROUS WILDFIRE.
[000:05:36;269] OFFICIALS SAY THE BLAZE BEING
[000:05:36;969] FOUGHT AT THE EDGE OF YOSEMITE
[000:05:37;704] HAS TAKEN TOP PRIORITY HAVING

[000:05:51;250] THE MOONSCAPE HERE SPREADS FOR
[000:05:51;984] MILES.
[000:05:55;722] THIS FIRE IS MASSIVE.
[000:05:58;291] SO FAR MORE THAN 106,000 ACRES
[000:06:00;159] HAVE BEEN CHARRED, AND THE FIRE
[000:06:00;893] IS GROWING LARGER AND LARGER
[000:06:02;995] LIVE
[000:06:06;232] TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE THE
[000:06:06;966] BURN ZONE IS THREE TIMES THE
[000:06:07;667] CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
[000:06:10;970] AND TODAY THE BLAZE IS MOVING IN
[000:06:11;704] MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS.
[000:06:12;238] THE INFERNO HAS ALREADY CREPT IN
[000:06:12;972] TO YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK.

[000:06:18;711] TREASURES.
[000:06:25;284] A WALL OF FLAMES, THE RIM FIRE
[000:06:26;018] IS ON THE RUN IN NEARLY
[000:06:26;619] INACCESSIBLE TERRAIN.
[000:06:27;186] IT SHOWS NO SIGN OF SLOWING
[000:06:28;454] DOWN.
[000:06:30;823] OVERNIGHT, QUADRUPLING IN SIZE,
[000:06:33;192] THE INFERNO IS NOW CLOSING IN ON
[000:06:37;830] 165 SQUARE MILES.
[000:06:38;831] >> THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS THE
[000:06:39;565] FIRE ITSELF.
[000:06:41;267] I MEAN, IT'S MAKING ITS OWN
[000:06:41;934] WEATHER.
[000:06:44;737] THE 40,000-FOOT COLUMNS ARE
[000:06:45;571] JUST UNREAL.

[000:07:08;428] ARE LOSING GROUND.
[000:07:08;928] EVEN THE AIR ATTACKS CAN'T SLOW
[000:07:09;662] THIS BLAZE.
[000:07:10;596] >> IF YOU WATCH THOSE TREES

[000:09:17;957] IT WON'T GET IN THE FIRE ZONES,
[000:09:18;925] UNFORTUNATELY.
[000:09:19;358] IT MAY HELP A COUPLE OF THESE,
[000:09:20;092] BUT WE DON'T THINK IT WILL HELP
[000:09:20;826] MANY.
[000:09:21;127] LOOK AT THIS.
[000:09:26;232] LOCALLY 2 TO 3 INCHES OF RAIN.
[000:09:26;933] YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT IS MUCH
[000:09:27;967] BUT THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN
[000:09:28;668] CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA THAT GET
[000:09:30;670] 2 TO 3 INCHES IN A YEAR, SO
[000:09:32;638] THIS IS A TREMENDOUS FLOOD
[000:09:33;306] THREAT FOR THE WEST.
[000:09:33;839] LET ME SHOW YOU THE KIND OF
[000:09:34;507] WEATHER THAT ACCOMPANIES
[000:09:36;642] MOISTURE ONCE YOU GET IT INTO

[000:09:39;679] LITTLETON, COLORADO, THIS
[000:09:41;647] IS A STORM THAT GOT
[000:09:43;282] UP TO EIGHT TO TEN MILES HIGH.
[000:09:44;083] INSTEAD OF PRODUCING RAIN, WHEN
[000:09:46;919] IT COLLAPSED, IT PRODUCED HAIL
[000:09:47;853] AND TONS OF HAIL, ENOUGH IT HAD
[000:09:48;588] TO BE REMOVED BY SNOWPLOWS IN
[000:09:49;288] LITTLETON, COLORADO.
[000:09:50;723] OFF TO YUMA, ARIZONA, NO RAIN OR
[000:09:53;025] NO HAIL HERE.
[000:09:54;860] WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING
[000:09:56;762] ABOUT DUST THAT FELL AND WAS
[000:09:57;463] PUSHED FROM THESE STORMS BECAUSE
[000:09:58;197] BASICALLY AS THESE STORMS
[000:10:01;934] COLLAPSE, THE AIR BELOW IT IS
[000:10:02;635] TOO DRY.
[000:10:03;035] SO AS WE GO HURRICANELESS IN THE
[000:10:03;836] ATLANTIC BASIN, A SERIOUS

[000:10:39;538] THE TRIAL THAT WAS EMOTIONAL FOR
[000:10:43;109] THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES TOOK THREE
[000:10:43;843] WEEKS.

[000:10:44;877] JURY FOUND NIDAL HASAN GUILTY OF
[000:10:45;611] ALL CHARGES.
[000:10:46;078] [ SIRENS ]

[000:10:56;522] COUNTS OF PREMEDITATED ATTEMPTED
[000:10:57;256] MURDER.
[000:11:01;293] AS THE VERDICT WAS READ IN
[000:11:01;961] COURT, HASAN, ACTING AS HIS OWN
[000:11:06;799] LAWYER, SHOWED NO EMOTION.
[000:11:08;200] PROSECUTORS ARE SEEKING THE
[000:11:08;868] DEATH PENALTY.

[000:11:15;741] HASAN.
[000:11:16;108] >> I THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT

[000:11:26;619] INFLICTED ON THEM AND THE WAY HE
[000:11:27;353] DESTROYED THEIR LIVES.

[000:11:37;229] SIDES TO PROTECT ISLAM AND
[000:11:37;897] LEADERS OF THE TALIBAN.
[000:11:39;665] >> THERE IS A RELIGIOUS,
[000:11:43;836] AND A POLITICAL COMPONENT TO IT
[000:11:47;139] AND IN HIS CASE,
[000:11:48;441] A PERSONAL, MORAL COMPONENT TO

[000:12:07;993] CAREFULLY PLANNED THE ATTACK AND
[000:12:09;729] FIRED 150 ROUNDS INSIDE THE ARMY
[000:12:10;463] MEDICAL BUILDING.
[000:12:11;330] IF HASAN IS SENTENCED TO DIE AND
[000:12:14;700] HIS CASE SURVIVES THE LENGTHY

[000:12:19;071] EXECUTED BY THE MILITARY IN MORE
[000:12:19;805] THAN 50 YEARS.
