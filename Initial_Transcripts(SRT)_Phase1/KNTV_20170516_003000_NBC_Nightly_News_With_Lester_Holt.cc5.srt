196
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
>> THAT'S CORRECT

197
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000

199
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THE PROBLEM IS GROWING

200
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
BY THE DAY.

201
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
LOSSES TOTALED A

202
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000

203
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
FAST FORWARD TO 2016

204
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
AN IBM SECURITY STUDY

AN URGENT PATCH.

210
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT

211
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THING IS TO

212
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
IMMEDIATELY DOWNLOAD

213
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THE SECURITY PATCH AND

214
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MAKE SURE YOUR SYSTEM

215
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
IS SECURE.

216
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
>> TO PROTECT YOURSELF

217
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
FROM AN ATTACK, KEEP

218
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM

219
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000

220
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000

BACK UP YOUR DATA ON

USER CONTROL ACCESS.

228
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
IF YOUR COMPUTER IS

229
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
HELD HOSTAGE, SHOULD

230
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
YOU PAY THE RANSOM?

231
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
>> SOME SOME CASES,

232
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
PEOPLE HAVE DECIDED

233
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THEY HAVE TO PAY THE

234
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
RANSOM.
THE COST OF LOSING

235
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
THAT DATA FOREVER OR

236
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
NOT HAVING ACCESS TO

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THAT DATA IS TOO

238
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
GREAT.
>> IT'S A GAMBLE, BUT

239
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
PERHAPS THE ONLY WAY

240
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
TO RECLAIM YOUR

252
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
DISNEY IS NOT

RELEASING THE NAME OF

255
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000

UNLIKE ANY THEY'VE

266
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
TRIED BEFORE.

267
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THERE ARE FEARS IT

268
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
COULD REACH A U.S.

269
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
TERRITORY.
WE GET LATE DETAILS

IT WAS A BIG SUCCESS.

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
LAST TWO THEY TESTED,

283
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
FLEW 1200 MILES IN THE

284
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
AIR AND DIDN'T BLOW

285
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
UP.

286
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
NORTH KOREA CLAIMED

287
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THE MISSILE CAN CARRY

288
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
A NUCLEAR WARHEAD.

289
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
NO PROOF THAT IT CAN,

290
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
BUT IT COULD

291
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
POTENTIALLY PUT U.S.

292
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000

AGGRESSIVE, HE'S

298
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
UNPREDICTABLE.

299
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I THINK THE ANSWER IS,

300
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
WE HAVE TO ENGAGE.

301
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
THERE HAS TO BE SOME

302
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
DIPLOMACY.
CHINA HAS TO HELP US

303
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
MORE THAN THEY HAVE.

IF IT WAS A CONTROLLED

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
SHOCKING.
IT'S REALLY SHOCKING.

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
ANYONE ON THE GROUND

404
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
TIMES.

485
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000

THEY THREW WATER IN
HIS FACE, THEY SAT ON

A STERNUM RUB WAS, AND

494
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
KNEW IF HE DIDN'T

495
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
REACT TO IT, THERE'S A

496
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.

497
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THEY DID NOTHING ABOUT

498
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
IT.

499
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
>> NEARLY 12 HOURS

500
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000

00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
FELL, SOMEONE FINALLY

502
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000

TIMOTHY'S OLDER

504
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
BROTHER MICHAEL WAS

505
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THE FIRST TO LEARN

506
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THAT SOMETHING WAS

507
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
WRONG.

508
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
>> ONE OF HIS
ROOMMATES CALLED ME TO

509
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
SEE IF I KNEW WHERE HE

510
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
WAS, BECAUSE HE HADN'T
COME HOME.

511
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
SO I CALLED THE

512
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
HOSPITAL JUST TO SEE.

513
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000

IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM,

516
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
AND WHEN I GOT THERE,

517
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I FOUND OUT PRETTY

518
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
QUICKLY HOW SERIOUS IT

519
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
WAS.
>> DID YOU ASK ANY OF

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> YES.

524
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> AN HOUR, TWO HOURS,

525
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
FOUR HOURS, SIX HOURS,

526
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
WOULD THE OUTCOME HAVE

527
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
BEEN DIFFERENT?

528
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
>> I SAID THOSE EXACT

529
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
WORDS?

530
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
AND THE DOCTOR SAID

531
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
YEAH.
>> SO THOSE 12 HOURS,

532
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
THAT IS WHAT MADE THE

533
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
DIFFERENCE?
>> YES.

534
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
>> YEAH.

535
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000

TOO MUCH FOR YOUR
