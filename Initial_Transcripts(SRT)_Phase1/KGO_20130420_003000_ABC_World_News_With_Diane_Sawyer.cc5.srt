1
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
FACT THAT HE WENT BACK TO

2
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
COLLEGE THE NEXT DAY.

3
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
THAT THEY WENT ON WITH LIFE.

4
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
AND THAT ALMOST MAKES YOU THINK

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
THAT THEY WERE PLANNING

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
SOMETHING ELSE, THIS THEY WERE

7
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
JUST GOING TO GO BACK TO THEIR

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
REGULAR LIFE.

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO RUN.

10
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
THEY WEREN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY.

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THEY WOULD PERHAPS TRY THIS KIND

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
OF THING AGAIN.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
WE GO BACK HERE TO THE SNIPER IN

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
2002, AND HOW TERRIFYING THAT

15
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WHEN THAT SNIPER WAS PICKING OFF

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
PEOPLE AND PART OF THAT TERROR

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
IS, YOUR LIFE JUST KIND OF WENT

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ON EVERY DAY, YOU DIDN'T KNOW

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
WHAT THESE PEOPLE WERE DOING,
YOU HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS AFTER

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
TERROR.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
IF YOU REALLY HAVE NO IDEA AND

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
NOBODY MADE ANY CLAIMS IN

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
MONDAY'S BOMBING, SO, THAT

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
TERROR REALLY, REALLY -- THE

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU'RE TALKING

29

ABOUT, IMAGINE WHAT THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN THROUGH

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
TODAY.
IMAGINE WHAT THIS CITY HAS BEEN

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
TERRIBLE BOMBINGS.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I WAS TALKING TO A YOUNG WOMAN

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHO HAD A

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'M CALLING HER AND TELLING HER,

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, THE SUSPECT

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
WE CAN ONLY HOPE WE GET

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
RESOLUTION TONIGHT.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> ALL RIGHT, MARTHA.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
AND FOR ANYONE WHO HAPPENED TO

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000

SUSPECT, I WANT TO REPLAY IT,

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BECAUSE HIS FRIEND, DAVE

HANNEBURY, FROM TWO DOORS DOWN,

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
WAS IN HIS HOUSE BEING

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
INTERVIEWED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
HERE HE IS AGAIN.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
GEORGE PIZZUTO.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
>> BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS, AFTER

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THEY LIFTED THE BAN, MY

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
NEIGHBORHOOD, DAVID

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
NEIGHBOR, HE WENT OUTSIDE TO GET

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
SOME FRESH AIR AND HE HAD HIS

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
24-FOOT BOAT ON A TRAILER WITH A

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
WINTER COVER, A SHRINK WRAP

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
COVER OVER IT.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
HE NOTICED SOMETHING WAS OFF.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SO, HE GOT A LADDER AND PUT IT

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
UP AGAINST THE SIDE AND HE HAS A

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
ZIP COVER.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
HE LIFTED UP THE ZIP COVER AND

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
HE -- AND AS HE WENT UP TO THE

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
LADDER, HE NOTICED BLOOD AND

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THEN HE THOUGHT HE SAW WHAT

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
LOOKED LIKE A BODY LAYING IN THE

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BOAT.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SO, HE GOT OUT OF THE BOAT FAST

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
AND CALLED THE POLICE AND THAT'S

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WHEN -- THAT'S WHEN EVERYONE

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
ASCENDED, DESCENDED, WHATEVER

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
BEING INTERVIEWED.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
IS, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SHOTS

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
FIRED AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SOME EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHETHER

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
THEY THREW THEM IN THE BOAT OR

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
THEY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
BOAT, I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HAVEN'T POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
THE PERSON, I'M PRETTY SURE

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
THAT'S WHO IT IS, BUT THEY DON'T

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
WANT TO GO -- THEY HAVEN'T GONE

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
IN YET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
IF HE IS WIRED FOR EXPLOSIVES.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
>> YES, THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
ALL ONG.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
THIS IS A STAGGERINGRY

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
YOU'RE TELLING US.
>> SO, ANYW, WHAT'S GOING ON

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
T NOW  THEY'RE -- THEY

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
JUST SHUT THE POWER OFF TO THE

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT AIR

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
ALL STILL HERE.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
EVERYONE IS STILL HERE.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
>> BUT TO GO BACK OVER IT ONCE

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
DAVE HANNEBURY, SYOU SAY?

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
>> YEAH, HE'S THE ONE THAT OWNS

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THE HOUSE.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
AND, LIKE I SAY, HE JUST

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
HAPPENED TO NOTICE, IT DIDN'T

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
LOOK RIGHT AND HE LOOKED INSIDE

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AND THAT'S WHERE HE SAW THE

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
BLOOD AND THE BODY AND THAT'S --

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE
PERSON NOW.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
>> AND AGAIN --

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
>> I DON'T KNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
HOW, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO OTHER

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
INFORMATION.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STILL HERE.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
>> HE WENT OUT IN HIS YARD AFTER

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HE WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO EXIT,

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
SO, THIS WAS VERY RECENTLY THIS

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
EVENING.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
>> YES, WE'VE BEEN IN ALL DAY

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
CAN -- WE'RE LIFTING THE BAN,

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BUT WE SUGGEST YOU DON'T GO TOO

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
FAR AND HE JUST WENT OUT TO HIS

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
YARD AND RIGHT IN HIS YARD,

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS BACK DOOR IS

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
HIS BOAT AND LIKE I SAID, I TOLD

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
YOUR FRIEND?
>> THEY'RE JUST WAITING.

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
>> YES.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FRIEND DAVE.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
WE'RE ALL IMAGINING WHAT HE IS

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
LIKE.

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW HE'S -- HE'S

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
PRETTY MUCH IN SHOCK.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
HE'S ONLY TALKING TO WHOEVER HE

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
HAS.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
COMMISSIONER DAVIS HAS BEEN IN

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
HE'S JUST TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
AND HIS WIFE, WHO IS SUFFERING

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
SOME MAJOR MEDICAL PROBLEMS, IS,

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000

THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHE

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
COULDN'T -- THEY COULDN'T TAKE
ANYTHING WITH THEM.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
>> AND AS WE SAID EARLIER, THE

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
VULNERABILITY OF THAT COUPLE IN

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
VULNERABILITY, SO CLOSE TO THEIR

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
HOUSE, TO CLOSE TO THEIR LIVES

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000

WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> YES, AS MY NEIGHBOR SAID,

176
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
WHEN THEY TOLD US WE COULD GO

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000

00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
PLASTIC, THAT SHRINK WRAP, ON

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
THE BOAT.

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
AND LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
TO, YOU KNOW, ASSESS WHAT WAS

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
GOING ON, SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
AROUND HIM.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
>> SO, LET ME UNDERSTAND.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO POKE

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HOLES OR THE SUSPECT WAS INSIDE?

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
>> THE SUSPECT.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
HE WAS IN THE BOAT, POKING HOMES

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
TO TRY TO SEE OUT.

196
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
>> THIS IS WHAT YOU HEARD POLICE
SAY?

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
>> YES.

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> WHICH WOULD INDICATE AND WE

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
HAD NOT HEARD THIS BEFORE, THAT

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
HE MIGHT HAVE STILL BEEN ALIVE

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
WHEN THEY CAME UP.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
AND WE KNOW THERE WAS THAT

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
EXCHANGE OF GUN FIRE.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
ANYTHING ELSE YOU SAW OR HEARD

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ABOUT THAT MOMENT?
>> NO, REALLY, IT WAS JUST

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
OVERHEARING THEM.
WE TRIED TO HEAR WHAT THE POLICE

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
RADIOS ARE SAYING, BUT IT'S A

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT.

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GUN

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
FIRE, WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENED

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
BEFORE WE OVERHEARD THE POLICE

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
OFFICERS TALKING.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
YOU KNOW, THE -- THERE WAS JUST

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
A RUSH DOWN THE STREET OF ALL

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THE VEHICLES AND JUST NOW THEY

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
ACTUALLY BROUGHT AN AMBULANCE

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
DOWN THE STREET AND AN ENORMOUS

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
BLACK SPECIAL UNIT TRUCK.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
BUT INITIALLY, THEY ALL CAME

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
RUSHING DOWN THE STREET AND THEN

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GUN

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
FIRE.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THEN THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
WE HEARD THE POLICE OFFICERS

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
SPEAKING AND THEN A LITTLE

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
WHILE -- WELL, QUITE AWHILE

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
LATER, THERE WERE SEVERAL

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
EXPLOSIONS AND THEN SOME MORE

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
GUN FIRE.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AND NOW, REALLY, FOR THE LAST

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
LITTLE WHILE, NOT MUCH SEEMS TO

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
BE GOING ON.

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
THE HELICOPTERS HAVE LEFT.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
BUT THESE LARGER, WELL, ONE

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
AMBULANCE AND A LARGER BIG BLACK

236
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
TRUCK JUST CAME DOWN THE STREET.

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, SUCH VIVID

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
DETAIL THAT YOU ARE ALL GIVING

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
US FROM PHONING IN AND WE THANK

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
YOU.

241
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
BUT LET ME GO THROUGH THAT

242
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
AGAIN.
YOU SAID THERE WAS GUN FIRE,

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
THEN SOMETHING SOUNDED EXPLOSIVE

244
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
AND THEN GUN FIRE AGAIN?

245
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
>> INITIALLY THERE WAS A LOT OF

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
GUN FIRE, SO, WE WERE TOLD, GO

247
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
OUTSIDE, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE DID.

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I WOULD SAY ABOUT FOUR MINUTES

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
LATER, THE POLICE CAME RUSHING

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
DOWN THE STREET.

251
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
THEN THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
GUN FIRE RIGHT WHEN THEY ALL

253
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
ARRIVED.
THEN, REALLY NOT MUCH OF

254
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
ANYTHING FOR AWHILE.

255
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
WE THEN OVERHEARD THE POLICE

256
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OFFICERS IN OUR BACKYARD TALKING

257
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
ABOUT THIS POKING HOLES THROUGH

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
THE PLASTIC.

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
AND THEN I WOULD SAY A GOOD 45

260
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
MINUTES, HOUR LATER, THERE WAS

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
MORE GUN FIRE AND WHAT SOUNDED

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
LIKE THREE SMALL EXPLOSIONS, I

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
MEAN, WE'RE ABOUT FOUR HOUSES

264
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AWAY, THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED

265
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
LIKE TO ME.

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
AND NOW THERE'S REALLY -- I

267
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EXPLOSIONS OR

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
GUN FIRE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
FOR, I'D SAY ABOUT ANOTHER 45

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
MINUTES, HOUR AT THIS INT.

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, IT RAISES THE

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
QUESTION, IF THERE WAS ANY

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
EXPLOSIVE AROUND THAT POLICE

274
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
WERE TRYING TO DETONATE.

275
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
WE OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE THIS

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
CLARIFIED AS TIME GOES ON.

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THERE WAS FEAR ENOUGH IN YOUR

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
HOUSE.
WHEN ALL OF THIS STARTS

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
HAPPENING, HOW AFRAID WERE YOU?

280
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
>> IT WAS -- IT ACTUALLY STARTED

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
LAST NIGHT AT ABOUT 1:45 A.M.,

282
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
THERE WERE -- IT'S A VERY QUIET

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE HELICOPTERS

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
CAME OVER AND I THOUGHT, OKAY,

285
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
FINE, THERE'S A HELICOPTER, BUT

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING MUCH

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
MORE THAN THAT.

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
WHEN I WENT TO THE WINDOW, I

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
COULD SEE OFFICERS MOVING

290
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
FLASHLIGHTS.
IT WAS VERY, VERY UNNERVING.

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
AND I REALLY DIDN'T FALL ASLEEP

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
AFTER THAT.

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
WE'VE ALL ACTUALLY BEEN UP SINCE

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THAT TIME AND OVER THE COURSE OF

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
THE DAY TODAY IT KIND OF WANED.

297
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT FELT

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
MORE STRESSFUL AND OTHER TIMES

299
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
WHEN PEOPLE SEEMED TO BACK OFF A
BIT.

300
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
THIS HAS HEIGHTENED THE STRESS

301
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
AND, YOU KNOW, BUT IT IS -- IT

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
IS -- IT'S KIND OF JUST A

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
WEARING, STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE.

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A LOT OF

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
BARNS, OLD OUTBUILDINGS,

306
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
GARAGES, SHEDS AND SUCH AND I

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
HAVE TO ADMIT, EVEN WHEN I HEARD

308
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THE POLICE SAYING THEY FELT

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
CONFIDENT THEY'VE DONE A

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
THOROUGH SEARCH, I HAD

311
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
QUESTIONS, JUST BECAUSE I KNOW

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
THE NATURE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
AND ALL THESE OUT BUILDINGS AND

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
WONDERED, REALLY, IF THEY HAD

315
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
MANAGED TO GO INTO THE NOOKS AND

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
CRANNIES.

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
>> I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT

318
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS JUST

319
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
LIKE THAT TOMORROW.

320
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
AND ONE OF THOSE INDELIBLE

321
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
DETAILS ABOUT THE HUMANITY

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
INVOLVED IN WHAT HAS BEEN

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
HAPPENING IS, YOU SAY THE

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
NEIGHBORS HAD JUST BROUGHT HOME

325
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
A FOUR-DAY OLD INFANT?

326
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
>> YES, MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS

327
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
HAVE A NEWBORN, HE CAME HOME ON

328
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
ZSH I KIND OF LOST TRACK OF

329
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
TIME, IT WAS EITHER WEDNESDAY OR

330
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
THURSDAY.
HE'S JUST NEW TO THE WORLD AND,

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
SO, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO DOUBT --

332
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
WE'VE BEEN TEXTING BACK AND

333
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
FORTH, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS, BUT YOU

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
KNOW, I'M JUST IMAGINING IT'S A

336
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
PRETTY STRESSFUL SITUATION TO

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
HAVE A BABY AND TO HAVE ALL OF

338
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THIS GOING ON, YOU KNOW, JUST

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
OUTSIDE.

340
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> AND YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE

341
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
HANNEBURYS?

342
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM TONIGHT?

343
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
>> NO, I MEAN, I MEAN -- WE ALL

344
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
KNOW -- I MEAN, I HAVE TO ADMIT,

345
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW ALL MY

346
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
NEIGHBORS LAST NAMES, WE ALL

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
KNOW EACH OTHER BY FIRST NAME.

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
IT'S A VERY CLOSE KNIT

349
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
THERE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
HERE, AS THEY HAVE, FOR A VERY

352
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
LONG TIME AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
ABOUT 11 YEARS, WE ALL KNOW EACH

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
OTHER VERY WELL.

355
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND --

356
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
>> DAVE IS HIS FIRST NAME.

357
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW THE FAMILY

358
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
AND I KNOW -- I MEAN, MY

359
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
14-YEAR-OLD SAID, OH, MY GOSH,

360
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT BOAT.

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
AND, YOU KNOW, AND I HAD EVEN

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
SAID EARLIER TODAY, NOT ABOUT

363
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
THAT BOAT, BUT WE LIVE RIGHT

364
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
NEAR THE CHARLES RIVER AND THERE

365
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
IS A YACHT CLUB THAT HAS ALL THE

366
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
BOATS SHRINK WRAPPED AND I SAID,

367
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
THINKING OUT LOUD THIS MORNING,

368
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I SAID, DO YOU THINK THEY'VE

369
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
GONE THROUGH ALL THOSE BOATS?

370
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
THERE ARE 50 OR 60 OF THEM.

371
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
IF I WAS RUNNING AWAY, I'D THINK

372
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND HIDE

373
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
THERE.
SO, IT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

374
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
INTERESTING THAT THAT'S WHERE HE

375
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
WAS, NOT AT THE YACHT CLUB, BUT

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
JUST DOWN THE STREET.

377
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
>> WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS

378
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
THE FOG OF INFORMATION RIGHT NOW

379
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
BUT YOU DID THINK THAT YOU

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
OVERHEARD POLICE IN THE BACKYARD

381
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
TALKING ABOUT THE SUSPECT,

382
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
PERHAPS, TRYING TO LOOK OUT OF

383
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THIS COVERING THAT WAS ON THAT

384
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
BOAT AND WE WILL TRY TO VERIFY

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
THAT THROUGHOUT THIS EVENING.

386
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I ALSO READ A QUOTE FROM YOU,

387
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
YOU SAID, I'VE NEVER FELT SAFER

388
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
IN MY LIFE.

389
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
EVERY OFFICER IN THE UNIVERSE.

390
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
>> AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, MY

391
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
PARENTS, YOU KNOW, FRIENDS,

392
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IS TEXTING

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
AND CALLING, EVEN PEOPLE I

394
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM IN YEARS, AND

395
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I DID SAY, KIDDINGLY, YOU KNOW,

396
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
HOW COULD YOU NOT FEEL SAFE, OUR

397
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY SURROUNDED

398
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
BY EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

399
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
IN THE UNIVERSE, SO, I WAS -- IT

400
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
WAS A LITTLE TONGUE IN CHEEK.

401
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I THINK I'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER

402
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
ONCE WE KNOW, YOU KNOW, THIS IS

403
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
OVER.

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
>> ROBIN, STAY IN TOUCH WITH IT.

405
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
CALL BACK IN.

406
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

407
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
>> AND A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN

408
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
ASKING ONLINE ABOUT SOMETHING

409
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
ALL DAY, THE OLDER BROTHER, THE

410
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
DECEASED BROTHER, HAD A WIFE OR

411
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
AT LEAST A GIRLFRIEND, WE'RE NOT

412
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
SURE IF THEY WERE MARRIED, BUT

413
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
THEY HAVE A 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

414
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
AS WELL.

415
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
AND A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN

416
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
ASKING, WHERE IS SHE?

417
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
DO THEY HAVE HER IN CUSTODY

418
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
TONIGHT?
BRIAN ROSS, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME

419
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
NOW, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

420
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
THAT?

421
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE

422
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
OLDER BROTHER'S WIFE IS IN

423
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
CUSTODY NOW, DO WE KNOW

424
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
ANYTHING?

425
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
SOUNDS AS IF BRIAN IS DEBRIEFING

426
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
SOMEBODY ON SCENE THERE, I'LL GO

427
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
TO PIERRE THOMAS WITH THE SAME

428
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
QUESTION?

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
HE IS DOING THE SAME THING.

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000

THIS IS WHAT WE DO, SEEKING OUT
EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF

435
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
SO, WE'RE DOING IT WITH YOU, YOU

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
ARE PART OF OUR NEWS ROOM, IN A

437
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
SENSE HERE ONLINE.

438
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
AND WE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE ON THE

439
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
TELEPHONE?

440
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
IRENE SANTORO.

441
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
IRENE, HELLO, IT'S DIANE.

442
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

443
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
>> HELLO, DIANE.

444
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
YES, WELL, WE'VE BEEN HERE ON

445
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
FRANKLIN STREET, WELL, ALL DAY,

446
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING

447
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
EVERYTHING ALL NIGHT, AS WELL.

448
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
WITH HALL CONTINUERS AND LIGHTS,

449
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
ET SET THAT HERE.

450
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
BUT PRESENTLY, WE HAVE ABOUT,

451
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
OH, MAYBE ABOUT 70 POLICE

452
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
VEHICLES LINING OF WASHBURN

453
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
STREET.

454
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
THAT'S PERPENDICULAR TO FRANKLIN

455
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
STREET, WHICH IS RIGHT IN FRONT

456
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
OF OUR HOUSE.

457
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT, IT'S A

458
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
LITTLE IRONIC, BECAUSE AS SOON

459
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
AS THE GOVERNOR LIFTED THE BAN

460
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
THAT WE COULD LEAVE OUR HOME IS

461
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT SEEMS

462
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
HELL BROKE LOOSE.

463
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I GUESS THERE'S A FEW LOUD WORDS

464
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
HERE, LOUD VOICES AND THEN I

465
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
STARTED TO SEE POLICE RUSH DOWN

466
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
WITH GUNS, WITH RIFLES, TOWARD

467
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
THE CURVE OF FRANKLIN STREET.

468
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
SO, A FEW POLICEMEN AND THEN

469
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
CAME BECAME IN DROVES, EVERYBODY

470
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
WAS COMING.

471
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
THE VEHICLES WERE PARKING ALONG

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
ANY WHICH WAY ON THE SIDEWALK.

473
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D SEE ON

474
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
TELEVISION OR A MOVIE.

475
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
MY HEART STARTED TO PALPITATE

476
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
HERE AND I'M STILL PALPITATING.

477
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THEN THE

478
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
S.W.A.T. TEAM CAME.
THERE ARE ABOUT TEN INDIVIDUALS

479
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THAT CAME ALL IN THEIR DARK

480
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
UNIFORMS HERE WITH RIFLES, ET

481
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
CETERA.
WALKING, RUNNING DOWN TO THE

482
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
CORNER OF FRANKLIN, AS WELL.

483
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
>> ALL RIGHT.

484
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
IRENE, I'M GOING TO STOP YOU FOR

485
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
A MINUTE BECAUSE WE HAVE A

486
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
FLASH.
WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS RIGHT

487
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
NOW, WANT EVERYBODY TO SIT UP

488
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
AND PAY ATTENTION.

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
WE HAVE PIERRE THOMAS.

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
PIERRE, WHAT DID YOU LEARN?

491
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
>> Reporter: WE HAVE THREE

492
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES

493
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
TELLING US THAT THE SUSPECT IS

494
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
IN CUSTODY.

495
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
CONDITION UNKNOWN.

496
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
CONDITION UNKNOWN, DIANE, BUT

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
OUR GUIDANCE IS THAT THE SUSPECT

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
IS IN CUSTODY.

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
>> IN CUSTODY.

500
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
AND AGAIN, IT SEEMED

501
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
INCONCEIVABLE AFTER ALL THESE

502
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
REPORTS OF THAT GUN FIRE AND THE

503
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
WAY HE WAS SURROUNDED, PIERRE?

504
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
>> Reporter: AGAIN, WE ARE

505
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
UNCLEAR ON WHAT EXACTLY HIS

506
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
CONDITION IS, DIANE.

507
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'M TRYING TO GET SOME CLARITY

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
ON THAT, BUT THE GUIDANCE WE

509
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
HAVE, A SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY

510
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING FURTHER

511
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
INFORMATION FROM THE BOSTON AND

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
LOCAL AUTHORITIES VERY SOON.

513
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
>> AND AGAIN, WE HAD HEARD THAT

514
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
THE HANNEBURYS, SAW THE BOAT,

515
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
SAW BLOOD IN IT, WHICH INDICATED

516
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED,

517
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
MAYBE IN SERIOUS CONDITION IN

518
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
THAT BOAT, BUT BRIAN ROSS, ARE

519
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
YOU HEARING THE SAME THING?

520
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
>> Reporter: I AM, DIANE.

521
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I JUST TALKED TO WITH THE STATE

522
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS AREA.

523
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
HE CONFIRMED THAT THAT WAS THE

524
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
SUSPECT NUMBER TWO IN THE BOAT.

525
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
THAT HE, IN FACT, FIRED OFF A

526
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
NUMBER OF ROUNDS AT POLICE.

527
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THEY DID NOT RETURN FIRE.

528
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
AND THAT THEY SENT IN ROBOTS TO

529
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
LOOK AT HIM AND A SPECIAL

530
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
MACHINE THAT COULD TIP THE BOAT

531
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
AND TIP IT OVER.

532
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
SO, HE HAS CONFIRMED TO ABC NEWS

533
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
THAT IT IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO IN

534
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
THE BOAT AND THAT HE WAS

535
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
BLEEDING AND THEY PLANNED TO

536
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
JUST LET HIM BLEED OUT OR WAIT

537
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
UNTIL HE WAS IN THEY WHEN THEY

538
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
COULDN'T RESPOND BECAUSE THEY

539
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
WEREN'T SURE IF HE HAD A SUICIDE

540
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
VEST ON.
THAT'S FROM STATE REPRESENTATIVE

541
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
JOHN LONG.
>> AGAIN, HE SAYS TO YOU THAT

542
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
THE SUSPECT FIRED AT THEM?

543
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.

544
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
THE SUSPECT FIRED AT THEM.

545
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
THEY WERE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS NOT

546
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
TO RETURN FIRE.

547
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
HE FIRED OFF AT THEM AND THAT

548
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
THE EXPLOSIONS THAT WERE HEARD

549
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN STUN GRENADES.

550
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
>> AH, WE DID HEAR THAT REPORT

551
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
OF SOME EXPLOSION.W, TELL ME AB

552
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
BOAT AGAIN AND THE PURPOSE OF
THAT?

553
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE SEVERAL

554
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
ROBOTS THEY SENT DOWN, SOME TO

555
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
TAKE A LOOK INSIDE THE BOAT, BUT

556
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THERE WAS ANOTHER MACHINE,

557
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
ACCORDING TO REPRESENTATIVE

558
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
LONG, THAT COULD ACTUALLY TIP

559
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
THE BOAT, TIP HIM OUT OF THE

560
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
BOAT.

561
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
>> I WANT TO BRING IN DICK

562
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
CLARK, BECAUSEHIIS STUNNING

563
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
NEWS, DICK.

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
THEY APPARENTLY WERE STANDING

565
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
THERE, HE WAS FIRING ON THEM AND

566
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
THEY SOME HOW COULD TIP THE BOAT

567
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
TO TRY TO DISABLE AT LEAST HIS

568
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN FIRING AT

569
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
THEM?

570
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
>> WELL, IF THEY HAVE A ROBOT

571
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH AND

572
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
CERTAINLY, THEY EXIST, AND THEY

573
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
HAVE ARMS THAT GO UP TO

574
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
MANIPULATE BOMBS, THEY COULD

575
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
HAVE USED ARMS TO RIP THE SHRINK

576
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
WRAP AND THEN TO PULL ALONG ONE

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
SIDE OF THE BOAT, HAVE HIM FALL

578
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
OUT.
AND THAT MAY BE WHAT HAPPENED.

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
>> AGAIN, WE HEARD THIS REPORT

580
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
FROM AN EYEWITNESS AND IT WAS SO

581
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
EARLY AND WE WERE ALL TRYING TO

582
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL, THAT THE

583
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
POLICE HAD BEEN OVERHEARD SAYING

584
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM SNEAKING

585
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
A LOOK OUT FROM UNDER THAT COVER

586
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
ON THE BOAT.

587
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
THIS SEEMS TO GIVE NEW VALIDITY

588
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
TO THAT, BRIAN.

589
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
>> Reporter: WELL, INDEED, AND

590
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
REPRESENTATIVE LONG SAYS, YOU

591
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
KNOW, IT'S OVER.

592
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
THERE'S NOT A QUESTION NOW.

593
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
WHEN HE CAME TO SPEAK WITH ME,

594
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
HE SAID IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF

595
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
MAKING SURE THAT HE IS

596
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
INCAPACITATED SO THAT IF HE HAS

597
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
A SUICIDE VEST, HE COULD NOT

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
DETONATE IT AND HARM ANY OF THE
OFFICERS.

599
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
>> AND, AGAIN --

600
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
>> Reporter: HE ALSO TOLD ME,

601
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
DIANE, HE MENTIONED THAT THE

602
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
GOVERNOR IS ALREADY HERE AT THE

603
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
COMMAND CENTER AND WE SHOULD SEE

604
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
HIM SHORTLY.

605
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
>> ALL RIGHT, PIERRE?

606
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
>> Reporter: DIANE, I CAN NOW

607
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
TALK ABOUT AN EARLIER

608
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
CONVERSATION THAT I COULD NOT

609
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
DISCLOSE.

610
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
AT ONE POINT, A LAW ENFORCEMENT

611
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
OFFICIAL HERE IN WASHINGTON WAS

612
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
LISTENING TO THE POLICE SCANNER

613
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
TRAFFIC AND THERE WAS A MOMENT

614
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS NOT MOVING

615
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
AND THEN APPARENTLY SAT UP IN

616
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
THE BOAT.

617
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
AND THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, A

618
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN IT BECAME

619
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
CLEAR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT

620
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
THE SUSPECT WAS, IN FACT, ALIVE.

621
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
AND SO IT'S REMARKABLE, AFTER

622
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
ALL OF THIS, THAT IS SUSPECT WAS

623
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
ALIVE AT THIS POINT.

624
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
AGAIN, WE DO NOT KNOW HIS

625
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
CONDITION AT PRESENT.

626
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
>> THIS IS BEYOND ANY DRAMA THAT

627
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
CAN BE WRITTEN, PIERRE.

628
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
AND, AGAIN, WHEN WE HEAR THAT HE

629
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
IS IN CUSTODY, WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?

630
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
>> Reporter: THAT MEANS THAT LAW

631
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TAKEN

632
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
HIM.
HE IS IN POLICE CUSTODY, DIANE.

633
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
>> IT COULD MEAN HOSPITAL, IT

634
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
COULD MEAN --

635
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
>> Reporter: WELL, WE KNOW THAT

636
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
THEY SENT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL,

637
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO THE SCENE,

638
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
WHICH WOULD BE TYPICAL IN A

639
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
SITUATION LIKE THIS, NOT ONLY

640
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
FOR THE SUSPECT, BUT ALSO FOR

641
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
POTENTIAL INJURIES TO POLICE, AS

642
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
WELL.

643
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
>> ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO GO BACK

644
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
TO BRIAN ROSS, BECAUSE, BRIAN,

645
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
ON THE SCENE, DO THEY NOW

646
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
BELIEVE, AND I KNOW YOU DO NOT

647
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
KNOW HIS CONDITION YET, COULD BE

648
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
A SPECTRUM OF THINGS, BUT HAS

649
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
ANYBODY SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT

650
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THEY BELIEVE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

651
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
GET SOME INFORMATION FROM HIM

652
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
ABOUT HOW MANY INVOLVED, WHAT

653
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
ELSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED?

654
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
>> Reporter: CERTAINLY IF HE'S

655
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
TAKEN ALIVE, THEN THAT SETS HIM

656
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
UP FOR A TRIAL ON CHARGES, MOST

657
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
LIKELY, OF PREMEDITATED MURDER

658
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
UNDER FEDERAL LAW, AS I

659
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
UNDERSTAND IT, THAT WOULD BE THE

660
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
PLAN, TO TRY HIM UNDER FEDERAL

661
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
TERRORISM CHARGES, NOT STATE

662
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MURDER CHARGES.
BUT THAT DOES OPEN THE

663
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD BE

664
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
ABLE TO BE QUESTIONED AND REVEAL

665
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
WHETHER IT WAS JUST HE AND HIS

666
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
BROTHER OR IF THERE WAS A LARGER

667
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
ORGANIZATION HE WAS PART OF.

668
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY

669
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
IMPORTANT TO STOP HIM, BUT IT'S

670
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER

671
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
HE REPRESENTED SOMETHING THAT

672
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
WAS DEEPER AND MORE TROUBLING.

673
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
>> I WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY

674
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
ABOUT A TWEET FROM MAYOR TOM

675
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
MENINO OF BOSTON.

676
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
HE TWEETED OUT, "WE GOT HIM."

677
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
"WE GOT HIM."

678
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
AND BRIAN, WHEN YOU SAY THAT

679
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
THEY ARE BRINGING HIM IN UNDER

680
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES, WHAT

681
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
IS THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING

682
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
THERE?

683
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
>> Reporter: AS I UNDERSTAND IT,

684
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
THE PLAN WAS TO CHARGE HIM WITH

685
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES AS

686
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OPPOSED TO STATE MURDER CHARGES.

687
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
NOW, ONE DISTINCTION IS THAT IN

688
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
MASSACHUSETTS, THERE IS NO DEATH
PENALTY.

689
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
UNDER FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES,
THERE COULD BE.

690
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
BUT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING

691
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THAT THIS WAS A CASE, BEING

692
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
HANDLED BY THE FBI, BY THE

693
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
FEDERAL GOTT, AND THE

694
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
JURISDICTION WOULD BE WITH THE

695
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
U.S. ATTORNEY HERE IN

696
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
MASSACHUSETTS.

697
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
>> I WANT TO BRING BACK IN EVAN

698
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
GOODMAN, WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A

699
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
GREAT REPORTER, CITIZEN REPORTER

700
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
FOR US TONIGHT.

701
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
EVAN, YOU ARE RIGHT THERE, CLOSE

702
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
TO THE SCENE AND YOU HEARD A

703
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
CHEER GO UP?

704
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
>> HI, DIANE, YES.

705
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SO, BASICALLY, A COUPLE OF US

706
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
WERE OUTSIDE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

707
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
WE HEARD A PRETTY SIZABLE CHEER

708
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
DOWN THE ROAD, SO

709
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
CLOSE, AND WE WALKED OUT TO THE

710
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
FRONT AND WE INTERCEPTED A

711
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
POLICE OFFICER AND, YOU KNOW, WE

712
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
ASKED IF HE WAS ALIVE OR NOT AND

713
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THEY SAID, HE'S IN CUSTODY, HE'S

714
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
ALIVE AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING

715
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
TO PROSECUTE HIM AND BRING TIME

716
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
THE JUSTICE.

717
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
>> SO, NO INDICATION THAT HE WAS

718
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
IN SUCH GRAVE CONDITION THEY HAD

719
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
A DOUBT IF HE'D SURVIVE?

720
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
>> WELL, I BELIEVE SO -- I'M

721
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
LOOKING OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW AND I

722
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
SAW A COUPLE OF AMBULANCES GO

723
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
BY, I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE FOR THE

724
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
SUSPECT.
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE WAS

725
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
INJURED, YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY

726
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
ELSE WAS INJURED.

727
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
BUT YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE HE

728
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
WAS BLEEDING OUT PRETTY BADLY.

729
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
YOU KNOW, JUDGING FROM HIS

730
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
WOUNDS EARLIER ON TODAY AND

731
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
PROBABLY FROM THE FIRE FIGHT

732
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
THAT WENT ON.

733
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
BUT I DO BELIEVE HE IS ALIVE   D

734
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO

735
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
GET SOME ANSWERS, WHICH IS

736
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTING

737
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
FEELING, YOU KNOW, THROUGH ALL

738
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
THIS.

739
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
>> AND FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE

740
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
INJURED AND IN THE HOSPITAL AND,

741
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
OF COURSE, FOR THE FAMILIES OF

742
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
THOSE WHO DIED AND WHO HAVE BEEN

743
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
SO SERIOUSLY INJURED, I KNOW, AT

744
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
THIS POINT, ANSWERS ARE

745
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS, VITALLY

746
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
TO THEM.

747
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
AND, AGAIN, WE -- YOU ARE RIGHT

748
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BLEEDING

749
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
ENOUGH, THAT DAVE, WHO WENT BACK

750
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT, SAW IT

751
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
PRETTY QUICKLY.

752
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, DIANE.

753
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU GUYS A

754
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
QUICK, WHAT'S GOING ON IN FRONT

755
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OF ME, BASIC LICK.

756
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Y

757
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
RESIDENTS ARE ON THE STREET

758
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
RIGHT NOW, I'M LESS THAN A BLOCK

759
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
AWAY.

760
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
THERE ARE FLIFR POLICE OFFICERS

761
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
WALKING UP, PEOPLE ARE

762
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
CONGRATULATING THEM, GIVING THEM

763
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
PATS ON THE BACK AND, YOU KNOW,

764
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
ASKING QUESTIONS, SO, IT'S MORE

765
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
OF A LESS TENSE SCENARIO RIGHT

766
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
NOW AND PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE AND

767
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
WALKING AROUND, SO, IT SEEMS

768
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

769
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
LENIENT, YOU KNOW, AS IT WAS

770
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
EARLIER IN THE DAY.

771
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
>> YES END AND, AGAIN, WE WERE

772
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
TOLD EARLIER THAT THE GUN FIRE

773
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
SEEMS TO BEEN COMING FROM INSIDE

774
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
THE BOAT OUT AT POLICE, THAT

775
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
POLICE APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN,

776
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THEY HAD SOME DEVICE, A ROBOTIC

777
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
DEVICE THAT COULD BE TIPPING THE

778
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
BOAT.

779
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A

780
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
SUICIDE VEST AND, DICK CLARK,

781
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
HOW WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

782
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
DETERMINE, ULTIMATELY, IF HE HAD

783
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ONE ON OR NOT IF THEY COULDN'T

784
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
APPROACH THE BOAT?

785
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
>> WELL, I THINK THEY PROBABLY

786
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
DID APPROACH THE BOAT WITH THE

787
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
ROBOT.

788
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
AND THE ROBOT PROBABLY HAD A

789
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
CAMERA IN IT AND THEY WERE

790
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
PROBABLY ABLE TO TELL THAT WAY

791
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
THAT THERE WAS NO -- THERE WAS

792
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
NO SUICIDE BELT.

793
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
>> I WANT TO PLAY THE SOUND.

794
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
APPARENTLY NOW WE HAVE AUDIO OF

795
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
THE POLICE SCANNER AND YOU CAN

796
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
HEAR, "WE GOT HIM.
LISTEN."

797
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
>> SUSPECT'S IN CUSTODY, BUT

798
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
NOBODY INSIDE THE PERIMETER.

799
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
PUT THAT OUT ON CHANNEL ONE.

800
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
>> SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.

801
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
AND ONLINE, OK, NOT JUST AMONG

802
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
POLICE, NOT JUST AMONG THE

803
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
PEOPLE OF BOSTON, BUT ALL ACROSS

804
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE SAYING,

805
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
HE'S IN CUSTODY, WE NEED

806
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
ANSWERS, AND SOMEONE SAID,

807
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
"VICTORY, WE ARE STRONG."

808
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
LET'S GO BACK TO LINSEY DAVIS,

809
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
ON THE SCENE THERE IN WATERTOWN

810
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
TONIGHT.

811
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
LINSEY?

812
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
>> Reporter: DIANE, IF YOU GUYS

813
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
CAN SEE THAT AMBULANCE GOING

814
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
DOWN THE STREET, WE BELIEVE THAT

815
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
THE SUSPECT WAS INSIDE THAT

816
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
AMBULANCE.
YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE CHEERING.

817
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
PEOPLE APPLAUDING.

818
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
THESE SAME RESIDENTS, MANY OF

819
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THEM -- YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE

820
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
HUGGING RIGHT HERE.

821
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
VERY JUBILANT ON THE SCENE.

822
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
MANY OF THESE SAME PEOPLE WERE

823
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
STANDING ON THE CORNER WHEN THE

824
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
POLICE WENT IN AND THEY WERE

825
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
CHEERING THEN AND YELLING.

826
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
MOMENTS AGO, WE HEARD THEM SAY,

827
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
"WE GOT HIM" AND THEY WERE

828
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
CHEERING AGAIN.
ONE LITTLE BOY SAID TO HIS DAD,

829
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
"IT IS OVER?"

830
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
AND HE SAID, "YEAH, SON, IT'S

831
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
OVER."
AND THEY HUGGED.

832
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED.

833
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
CERTAINLY, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,

834
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
VERY RELIEVED.
>> AND MORE FROM THE MAYOR OF

835
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
BOSTON.

836
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
"I HAVE NEVER LOVED THIS CITY

837
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
AND ITS PEOPLE MORE THAN I DO

838
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
TODAY.
NOTHING CAN DEFEAT THE HEART OF

839
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
THIS CITY, NOTHING."

840
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
AND HIS EARLIER TWEET, "WE GOT

841
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
HIM."
CANNOT HELP BUT ECHO IN THE MIND

842
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
OF EVERYBODY WHEN SOMEONE SAID

843
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
THAT ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN AND

844
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
OBAMA, AS WEL0

845
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
BAM OSAMA, AS WELL.

846
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
POLICE SAY THEY HAVE HIM IN

847
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
CUSTODY.

848
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I WANT TO SEE IF YOU HAVE

849
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
ANYTHING FROM THE SOURCES THAT

850
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL NIGHT.

851
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
>> Reporter: DIANE, WE CAN

852
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
CONFIRM THAT THE SUSPECT IS

853
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
ALIVE.
HE'S IN THAT AMBULANCE.

854
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
ONE OF OUR OFFICIALS GOT A TEXT

855
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
FROM THE SCENE SAYING SUSPECT IS

856
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
ALIVE IN THE AMBULANCE.
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO JON

857
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
KARL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

858
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
JON, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THERE

859
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT

860
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, IMMEDIATELY
IN THE NEXT HOURS?

861
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
>> Reporter: WELL, DIANE,

862
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION OF

863
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THE SUSPECT, THE NEXT THING YOU

864
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
CAN EXPECT TO HAPPEN WILL BE THE

865
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
ACTIVATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S

866
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
HIGH VALUE INTERROGATION GROUP.

867
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
THIS IS A GROUP MADE UP OF THE

868
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
CIA, THE DIA AND THE FBI.

869
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
THIS WAS SET UP BY PRESIDENT

870
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
OBAMA IN 2009 AFTER THEY DID

871
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AWAY WITH THE CIA'S

872
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
INTERROGATION PROGRAM AND IT IS

873
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
DESIGNED FOR EXACTLY THIS

874
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
SITUATION.
TO GO IN AND TO INTERROGATE

875
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IMMEDIATELY

876
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
AFTER THEIR APPREHENSION.

877
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I HAVE BEEN TOLD PRIOR TO THIS

878
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
THAT THIS GROUP WAS ON STAND-BY

879
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
AND READY TO GO.

880
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
THAT'S THE NEXT THING WE'RE

881
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
LOOKING FOR.

882
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
TRYING TO GET INTELLIGENCE AND

883
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
INFORMATION OUT OF THIS

884
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THE BIG

885
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
QUESTION HERE, DIANE, THAT THE

886
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

887
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON IS WHETHER

888
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
OR NOT THESE BROTHERS WERE

889
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
ACTING ALONE OR WHETHER OR NOT

890
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
THEY WERE PART OF A LARGER GROUP

891
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
AND THERE COULD BE OTHER

892
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
PLOTTERS OUT THERE.

893
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
>> AGAIN, MARTHA RADDATZ, WE

894
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
KNOW HIS OLDER BROTHER HAD GONE

895
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
BACK TO RUSSIA.

896
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
WE HAVE A KIND OF DARK AGE IN

897
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHEN HE

898
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
WAS BACK IN RUSSIA.

899
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE WENT.

900
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
>> Reporter: WE HAVE NO IDEA.

901
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
HE WAS THERE SIX MONTHS.

902
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
SO, THAT'S A PERIOD THEY'RE

903
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
REALLY GOING TO LOOK AT AND IF

904
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
THEY CAN INTERROGATE THIS

905
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
SUSPECT, THEY WILL DO THAT, THE

906
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
YOUNGER BROTHER.

907
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THEY WILL ASK HIM WHATEVER THEY
