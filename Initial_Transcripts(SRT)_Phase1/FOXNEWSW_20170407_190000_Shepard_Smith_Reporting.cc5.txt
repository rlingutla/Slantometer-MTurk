[000:00:03;887] JUDGE GORSUCH REPLACES THE LATE
[000:00:07;857] ANTONIN SCALIA.
[000:00:08;925] I'M MELISSA FRANCIS.
[000:00:14;998] HERE'S SHEP.
[000:00:15;465] >> IT'S NOON ON THE WEST COAST,
[000:00:17;801] 3:00 IN WASHINGTON.
[000:00:20;270] 10:00 P.M. IN DAMASCUS.
[000:00:23;306] WE'RE WAITING TO HERE HOW BASHAR
[000:00:25;141] AL-ASSAD WILL RESPOND TO
[000:00:26;342] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MISSILE
[000:00:28;311] STRIKES.
[000:00:28;745] AL-ASSAD IS NOT THE ONLY ONE
[000:00:30;847] WATCHING NOW.
[000:00:31;314] FOX NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT A
[000:00:35;085] RUSSIAN NAVAL SHIP IS HEADING TO
[000:00:36;920] THE REGION.
[000:00:37;954] EXPERTS SAY IT'S OF NO CONCERN.
[000:00:39;789] WE'LL HERE FROM GENERAL JACK
[000:00:45;628] KEANE AND CHRIS WALLACE.
[000:00:47;964] THE PRESIDENT IS MONITORING THE
[000:00:49;999] AFTERMATH.
[000:00:50;533] WE'LL GET REACTION FROM AROUND
[000:00:51;968] THE WORLD AND HEAR WHAT
[000:00:53;536] LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH SIDES HAVE
[000:00:56;473] TO SAY.
[000:00:57;073] TWO OTHER MAJOR STORIES.
[000:00:59;342] THE CONFIRMATION VOTED FOR NEIL
[000:01:05;048] GORSUCH AND ATTACKS IN SWEDEN.
[000:01:09;285] A DRIVER PLOWING HIS TRUCK INTO
[000:01:10;887] A DEPARTMENT STORE, A LOT OF
[000:01:12;956] NEWS.
[000:01:13;256] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:16;359] AND FIRST FROM THE DECK THIS
[000:01:17;727] FRIDAY AFTERNOON, WE BEGIN WITH
[000:01:19;329] A STARK WARNING FROM RUSSIA.
[000:01:22;932] THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER IS
[000:01:24;467] NOW SAYING THAT THE SYRIAN
[000:01:26;402] STRIKES HAVE PUT THE UNITED
[000:01:27;637] STATES ON THE VERGE OF A
[000:01:30;774] MILITARY CLASH.
[000:01:31;608] QUOTING HERE "THE LAST REMAINING
[000:01:34;644] ELECTION FOG HAS LIFT.
[000:01:36;479] INSTEAD OF A OVERWORKED
[000:01:38;815] STATEMENT ABOUT A JOINT FIGHT
[000:01:40;216] BETWEEN THE ENEMY, ISIS, THE
[000:01:43;453] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROVED THAT
[000:01:44;387] THEY WILL FIGHT THE LEGITIMATE
[000:01:46;890] SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN A TOUGH
[000:01:48;691] CONTRADICTION WITH INTERNATIONAL
[000:01:50;093] LAW AND WITHOUT U.N. APPROVAL.
[000:01:52;028] HE WRITES THE STRIKES HAVE PUT
[000:01:53;530] THE UNITED STATES ON THE VERGE
[000:01:54;531] OF A MILITARY CLASH WITH RUSSIA.
[000:01:59;102] THAT AS WE GET WORD THAT A
[000:02:03;540] RUSSIAN WARSHIP IS HEADED TOWARD
[000:02:06;242] THE TWO UNITED STATES NAVY
[000:02:07;644] DESTROYERS USED IN THE STRIKES
[000:02:12;448] ON SYRIA.
[000:02:13;616] WE'RE NEARING 24 HOURS NOW SINCE
[000:02:15;418] THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THE
[000:02:17;554] STRIKES ON THAT AIR BASE IN
[000:02:19;055] SYRIA.
[000:02:19;355] A RESPONSE HE SAYS TO THIS
[000:02:20;990] WEEK'S DEADLY GAS ATTACK IN
[000:02:22;992] SYRIA THAT KILLED DOZENS,
[000:02:24;994] INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
[000:02:26;129] AN ATTACK WHICH THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:28;097] SAYS THERE'S NO DOUBT THE
[000:02:30;834] MURDEROUS SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR
[000:02:32;368] AL-ASSAD ORDERED.
[000:02:33;036] THE STRIKES HITTING OVERNIGHT IN
[000:02:35;471] SYRIA.
[000:02:35;772] THE U.S. NAVY FIRING 60 TOMAHAWK
[000:02:40;076] CRUISE MISSILES FROM TWO WAR
[000:02:42;912] SHIPS.
[000:02:43;313] SYRIA CLAIMS SEVEN ARE DEAD AND
[000:02:44;480] WE'RE GETTING OUR FIRST APPARENT
[000:02:45;949] LOOK AT THE BASE AFTER THE
[000:02:48;718] STRIKES.
[000:02:49;052] THIS IS RUSSIAN DEFENSE VIDEO
[000:02:50;787] TAKEN FROM THE COCKPIT OF A
[000:02:53;790] DRONE.
[000:02:54;090] MORE DRONE FOOTAGE FROM RUSSIAN
[000:02:55;792] TELEVISION.
[000:02:56;192] THIS TIME IN COLOR.
[000:02:56;759] ACCORDING TO THE U.S. MILITARY,
[000:02:58;394] THE TARGETS INCLUDING RUNWAY,
[000:03:01;297] THE AIRCRAFT THEMSELVES, HANGERS
[000:03:04;467] AND FUEL.
[000:03:05;301] I'LL SHOW YOU ON SATELLITE
[000:03:07;704] IMAGES.
[000:03:08;037] AND THIS VIDEO FROM SYRIAN STATE
[000:03:10;473] TELEVISION REPORTED THERE FROM
[000:03:12;175] NEAR THAT VERY BASE.
[000:03:13;877] IF YOU LOOK IN THE DISTINCTION
[000:03:15;011] ANSWER THE, YOU CAN SEE SMOKE A
[000:03:17;380] ON THE HORIZON.
[000:03:18;681] FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS IS
[000:03:21;050] CLEARLY HIS MOST DRAMATIC
[000:03:22;819] MILITARY ORDER SINCE TAKING
[000:03:27;790] OFFICE.
[000:03:28;124] AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, PROBABLY
[000:03:29;392] AS A NATION, IT'S A SIGNIFICANT
[000:03:31;294] CHANGE FROM THE U.S. APPROACH IN
[000:03:35;865] THAT WAR-TORN NATION AND DEALING
[000:03:37;567] WITH THE TYRANT HIMSELF WHO FOR
[000:03:41;571] YEARS HAS BEEN SLAUGHTERING HIS
[000:03:44;440] OWN PEOPLE.
[000:03:45;308] AL-ASSAD CALLED THE STRIKES
[000:03:46;376] RECKLESS AND ACCUSED THE UNITED
[000:03:47;443] STATES OF HELPING ISIS.
[000:03:49;045] >> THE AGGRESSION OF THE U.S. ON
[000:03:52;148] SYRIAN AIR FORCE TODAY IS A
[000:03:55;518] PROOF THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
[000:03:58;488] NOT INTENT ON FIGHTING TERRORISM
[000:04:02;458] BUT HELPING TERRORISTS.
[000:04:03;626] >> BEYOND SYRIA, THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:04:05;328] IS IN A NEW WORLD WITH RUSSIA,
[000:04:07;563] IT WOULD APPEAR, ALONG WITH
[000:04:10;667] IRAN, AL-ASSAD'S BIGGEST BACKER
[000:04:13;236] ALONG WITH THE RUSSIANS.
[000:04:16;039] FOX LEARNED THAT A RUSSIAN
[000:04:18;207] WARSHIP IS MAKING ITS WAY TO THE
[000:04:20;443] AREA AND THIS IS NO LONGER A
[000:04:30;053] CONFLICT BY PROXY.
[000:04:32;889] VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID THAT THE
[000:04:34;057] PRESIDENT ORDERED THE STRIKES
[000:04:35;792] UNDER A FAR-FETCHED PRETEXT.
[000:04:38;361] PUTIN SAYS THEY WILL REDUCE
[000:04:40;596] COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED
[000:04:41;731] STATES AND REINFORCE AL-ASSAD'S
[000:04:43;132] AIR DEFENSES.
[000:04:44;033] I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE THE
[000:04:45;935] AIR STRIKES TARGETED.
[000:04:47;170] HERE'S A SATELLITE IMAGE OF THAT
[000:04:49;005] SYRIAN BASE.
[000:04:49;939] IT'S A PRETTY EXPANSIVE PLACE.
[000:04:53;676] YOU CAN SEE THE RUNWAYS AND THE
[000:04:56;546] ACCESS LANES.
[000:04:58;181] THEY'RE FROM IMAGE SAT
[000:04:59;949] INTERNATIONAL.
[000:05:00;383] A PRIVATE COMPANY.
[000:05:01;951] LET'S ADD SOME COLOR TO THIS
[000:05:03;186] MAP.
[000:05:03;453] THIS WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA
[000:05:05;021] OF WHAT EVERYTHING IS.
[000:05:06;356] LET'S WATCH THE COLORS.
[000:05:07;590] IN THE YELLOW OVER HERE, THOSE
[000:05:09;993] ARE DESCRIBED AS DOUBLE HASHENED
[000:05:13;930] AIR CRAFT HANGERS.
[000:05:16;432] THERE'S 13 IN YELLOW.
[000:05:18;534] ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY, THEY
[000:05:20;737] HIT ALL 13.
[000:05:21;804] IN ORANGE, THOSE ARE WORKSHOPS.
[000:05:23;940] THE ONE DOT THERE.
[000:05:25;274] FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE.
[000:05:27;010] IF YOU LOOK IN THE BLUE DOWN
[000:05:28;311] HERE, ALL OF THIS, THESE ARE
[000:05:30;113] AMMO STORAGE AREAS.
[000:05:31;914] YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S ROADS
[000:05:33;249] THAT LEAD TO THEM FOR STORING
[000:05:35;051] AMMO IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
[000:05:37;120] PLACES.
[000:05:37;453] WHERE EACH BLUE CIRCLE IS,
[000:05:40;490] THAT'S WHERE A TOMAHAWK MISSILE
[000:05:43;092] STRIKES.
[000:05:43;693] WE'RE TOLD ALL TEN STORAGE AREAS
[000:05:46;162] WERE TAKEN OUT.
[000:05:47;096] LET'S LOOK IN RED.
[000:05:49;265] THE RED DOTS HERE AGAINST THESE
[000:05:50;833] ROADS, THEY'RE DEFENSE AND
[000:05:52;535] CONTROL SYSTEMS.
[000:05:53;536] SO IN THESE AREAS, THEY'RE ABLE
[000:05:55;638] TO CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
[000:05:57;774] FLIGHT PATTERN HERE.
[000:05:59;142] IN GREEN, FUEL AND STORIES
[000:06:01;477] RESERVOIRS.
[000:06:01;878] LOOKS LIKE THERE'S THREE HERE.
[000:06:03;579] OFFICIALS SAY THE STRIKES WIPED
[000:06:05;114] OUT MOST OF THEM, BUT THEY SAY A
[000:06:07;283] COUPLE ARE LEFT.
[000:06:09;352] WE'LL HAVE COMPREHENSIVE
[000:06:12;789] COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.
[000:06:14;957] JENNIFER GRIFFIN HAS MORE.
[000:06:16;292] THE PENTAGON IS INVESTIGATING
[000:06:18;227] WHETHER MOSCOW WAS INVOLVED IN
[000:06:20;830] THE STRIKE ON THE SYRIAN PEOPLE
[000:06:22;632] WITH THE SARIN GAS.
[000:06:25;068] WHAT DO WE KNOW?
[000:06:26;102] >> WE WERE JUST TOLD THIS BY TWO
[000:06:29;972] US IS SENIOR MILITARY
[000:06:33;709] COMMANDERS.
[000:06:34;110] LAST NIGHT ADMINISTRATION
[000:06:34;777] OFFICIALS TOLD FOX NEWS THAT
[000:06:35;745] THEY HAD EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIANS
[000:06:37;080] WERE PRESENT WHEN THE SYRIANS
[000:06:39;215] LOADED THOSE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON
[000:06:43;519] TO THAT WAR PLANE.
[000:06:44;987] U.S. OFFICIALS TELL US A RUSSIAN
[000:06:47;723] OR SYRIAN DRONE WAS SEEN FLYING
[000:06:49;258] OVER A HOSPITAL WHERE THE
[000:06:53;863] VICTIMS WERE TAKEN ON TUESDAY
[000:06:55;765] SHORTLY BEFORE THAT HOSPITAL WAS
[000:06:59;068] BOMBED.
[000:06:59;402] THE RUSSIANS OR THE SYRIAN
[000:07:01;104] REGIME WAS TRYING TO DESTROY AND
[000:07:02;705] COVER UP EVIDENCE OF THE
[000:07:04;640] CHEMICAL ATTACKS.
[000:07:05;741] LAST NIGHT THERE WERE 12 TO 100
[000:07:08;244] RUSSIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL AT
[000:07:10;379] THE SYRIAN AIR BASE WHEN THE
[000:07:12;115] U.S. MILITARY STRUCK.
[000:07:13;783] THAT ACCORDING TO THOSE DEFENSE
[000:07:15;618] OFFICIALS THAT JUST BRIEFED HERE
[000:07:18;221] AT THE PENTAGON.
[000:07:20;123] THE ALL IS MILITARY TOOK EFFORTS
[000:07:22;058] NOT TO HIT THE BARRACKS.
[000:07:23;926] THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE
[000:07:25;161] ANY RUSSIANS KILLED.
[000:07:27;063] THE U.S. SAID THEY GAVE RUSSIA
[000:07:29;732] AN HOUR HEADS-UP.
[000:07:30;900] ABOUT 20 SYRIAN AIRCRAFT WERE
[000:07:33;469] DESTROYED AT THE BASE, SHEP.
[000:07:36;205] >> Shepard: WHAT DO WE KNOW
[000:07:37;807] ABOUT THE TIMING ON WHEN THE
[000:07:39;475] PRESIDENT DECIDED TO TAKE THE
[000:07:40;810] STRIKE?
[000:07:41;144] >> WE'RE TOLD YESTERDAY AT 4:30
[000:07:43;913] EASTERN TIME AFTER BEING BRIEFED
[000:07:45;915] BUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
[000:07:47;383] AT MAR-A-LARGO, HE TOOK THE
[000:07:49;085] DECISION.
[000:07:49;519] GENERAL MATTIS AND HIS NATIONAL
[000:07:51;954] SECURITY ADVISER FLEW DOWN
[000:07:54;056] SEPARATELY FROM THEIR BOSS WITH
[000:07:56;292] THE PLAN.
[000:07:57;126] 60 TOM HOUSE MISSILES WERE
[000:07:59;795] LAUNCHED FROM THE EASTERN M
[000:08:15;711] MEREDETARIAN SEA.
[000:08:16;579] IT TOOKES 30 MINUTES TO LAUNCH
[000:08:18;748] THE TOMAHAWKS.
[000:08:19;682] SOME CIRCLED OVERHEAD AND THEN
[000:08:22;251] AN HOUR LATER AT 8:40 P.M.
[000:08:25;288] EASTERN, ALL 59 MISSILES HIT
[000:08:28;257] WITHIN TWO TO THREE MINUTES WITH
[000:08:31;027] THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID
[000:08:32;295] THE NERVE AGENTS WERE LOADED ON
[000:08:34;530] TO A RUSSIAN-MADE WAR PLANE.
[000:08:36;599] WE JUST LEARNED THAT THAT
[000:08:38;201] HOTLINE SET UP BETWEEN THE
[000:08:39;168] RUSSIAN AND U.S. MILITARY TO
[000:08:41;437] PREVENT MILITARY MISHAPS IN
[000:08:44;106] SYRIA, THAT IS BEING SHUT DOWN
[000:08:46;876] BY THE RUSSIANS.
[000:08:49;212] BACK TO YOU.
[000:08:49;845] >> Shepard: JENNIFER GRIFFIN
[000:08:50;580] WITH THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
[000:08:51;581] THANK YOU.
[000:08:52;949] LET'S TURN TO GENERAL JACK KEANE
[000:08:56;085] FROM THE UNITED STATES ARMY.
[000:08:57;587] THANKS FOR BEING HERE LAST NIGHT
[000:08:59;422] AND TODAY.
[000:09:00;022] >> GLAD TO BE HERE, SHEP.
[000:09:02;258] >> Shepard: A COUPLE THINGS.
[000:09:04;093] THIS RUSSIAN SHIP, THE RUSSIAN
[000:09:06;896] DESTROYER ON THE MOVE TOWARD OUR
[000:09:08;364] SHIPS, WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF
[000:09:10;032] THAT?
[000:09:10;333] AND THE BLUSTER FROM VLADIMIR
[000:09:12;134] PUTIN AND HIS SPOKESPEOPLE?
[000:09:13;669] >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE
[000:09:16;038] RUSSIAN SHIP IS STAYING IN
[000:09:17;607] INTERNATIONAL WATERS.
[000:09:18;441] HAS A RIGHT TO BE THERE.
[000:09:19;609] I DON'T THINK OUR MILITARY
[000:09:21;477] LEADERS ARE ALL THAT CONCERNED
[000:09:22;278] ABOUT IT.
[000:09:23;412] RUSSIA DOES NOT WANT TO GO TO
[000:09:24;981] WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.
[000:09:27;283] RUSSIA HAS BEEN POUNDING OUR
[000:09:29;018] PROXIES INSIDE OF SYRIA, THE
[000:09:31;587] SYRIAN MONITORS.
[000:09:32;455] THE C.I.A. WAS THE FIRST ONE
[000:09:34;790] THAT THEY BOMBED WITH THEIR AIR
[000:09:36;692] CAMPAIGN.
[000:09:38;294] IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO MORE,
[000:09:41;230] THAT IT USE THEIR OWN BOMBERS.
[000:09:43;766] SO UNLIKELY ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN
[000:09:45;935] U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND RUSSIAN
[000:09:49;038] SHIPS.
[000:09:50;006] IN TERMS OF PUTIN'S BLUSTER,
[000:09:52;041] WE'RE USED TO IT AND WE'LL HEAR
[000:09:53;976] MORE OF IT.
[000:09:56;112] FRANKLY, RUSSIA AND IRAN IS IN A
[000:09:58;748] GOOD SPOT.
[000:10:01;217] LET'S FACE IT.
[000:10:02;385] THEY BEAT BACK THE OPPOSITE
[000:10:03;653] FORCES OUT OF ALEPPO.
[000:10:05;488] THEY CONSOLIDATED THE REGIME'S
[000:10:09;458] HOLDING.
[000:10:09;792] RUSSIA WAS ABLE TO SUCCEED AND
[000:10:11;727] ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY INTENDED TO
[000:10:13;296] DO, PROP UP THE REGIME WHEN THEY
[000:10:14;797] WERE IN DANGER OF BEING
[000:10:17;400] OVERTHROWN IN 2015.
[000:10:18;501] THEY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY
[000:10:21;671] WANTED.
[000:10:22;071] I THINK FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING
[000:10:24;106] THAT WOULD AGGRAVATE THE
[000:10:25;341] SITUATION FURTHER DOESN'T MAKE A
[000:10:26;542] LOT OF SENSE TO ME.
[000:10:27;777] >> AFTER 37 YEARS IN SERVICE AND
[000:10:29;245] WE THANK YOU.
[000:10:30;279] YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CONTACTS.
[000:10:32;948] I WONDER WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING
[000:10:35;851] IS OF THE NEXT STEPS.
[000:10:37;486] >> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY AS
[000:10:39;522] SAD IS CONTROLLING FATE HERE.
[000:10:42;224] IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO USE
[000:10:44;427] WMD, WE'LL TAKE DOWN THOSE OTHER
[000:10:47;596] FIVE AIR FIELDS AND MAKE CERTAIN
[000:10:49;165] THAT ALL OF HIS AIRCRAFT ARE
[000:10:50;733] GROUNDED PERMANENTLY.
[000:10:51;667] SO HE HOLDS THAT FATE.
[000:10:53;903] I DON'T BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS
[000:10:55;538] WILL DO ANYTHING TO AGGRAVATE
[000:10:57;707] THE SITUATION WITH THE UNITED
[000:10:58;941] STATES.
[000:10:59;275] THEY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE
[000:11:01;677] CONFRONTATION OR CONFLICT WITH
[000:11:02;912] THE UNITED STATES.
[000:11:03;646] I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE,
[000:11:05;214] WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON TAKING
[000:11:07;483] ISIS DOWN.
[000:11:07;950] THE PENTAGON HAS SUBMITTED PLANS
[000:11:09;618] FOR THAT.
[000:11:10;286] THE PRESIDENT HAS APPROVED THE
[000:11:11;787] PLANS.
[000:11:12;288] WE'LL SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF
[000:11:14;256] THAT UNFOLD IN THE NEXT NUMBER
[000:11:16;025] OF WEEKS.
[000:11:16;659] HE'S NOT GOING TO TELL US HOW OR
[000:11:18;494] WHEN HE'S DOING IT.
[000:11:20;329] IT WILL UNFOLD AND THE MEDIA
[000:11:21;997] WILL START REPORTING ON IT.
[000:11:23;099] IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY
[000:11:26;202] OBJECT SYRIA, LET'S BE FRANK
[000:11:28;337] ABOUT IT.
[000:11:28;804] THERE'S NOTHING EASY HERE.
[000:11:30;406] THIS IS BY AND LARGE AN
[000:11:33;642] INTRACTABLE SITUATION.
[000:11:34;343] WE SQUANDERED ALL THE
[000:11:36;212] OPPORTUNITIES, SHEP, TO DO
[000:11:36;946] SOMETHING FAVORABLE HERE FOR THE
[000:11:38;848] SYRIAN PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FIVE
[000:11:41;884] OR SIX YEARS.
[000:11:42;718] WE ARE OUT OF OPTIONS.
[000:11:45;421] I THINK SAFE ZONES STILL MAKE
[000:11:47;022] SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A
[000:11:48;190] WAY TO GET SOME OF THESE SYRIAN
[000:11:50;559] PEOPLE AWAY FROM THESE BOMBS
[000:11:51;761] THAT ARE GOING TO FALL ON THEM,
[000:11:55;197] CONVENTIONAL BOMBS AND
[000:11:56;599] ARTILLERY.
[000:11:56;966] WE CAN PROTECT THEM WITH
[000:11:58;601] INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO DO
[000:11:59;668] SOMETHING.
[000:12:00;169] I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE
[000:12:01;203] SHOULD WORK -- IT'S WORTH DOING.
[000:12:03;706] >> Shepard: GENERAL JACK KEANE,
[000:12:08;377] THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.
[000:12:09;445] >> THANKS, SHEP.
[000:12:10;780] >> Shepard: THE STRIKE IN SYRIA
[000:12:12;081] WAS A MESSAGE.
[000:12:13;382] NOT ONLY TO THE SYRIAN DICTATOR
[000:12:15;818] BUT TO OTHERS.
[000:12:18;053] THE MISSILE MAY HAVE SENT A
[000:12:20;423] POWERFUL WARNING TO NORTH KOREA.
[000:12:22;324] ONE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
[000:12:23;459] WILLING TO GO IT ALONE.
[000:12:24;760] SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
[000:12:26;362] PRESIDENT TRUMP?
[000:12:26;929] AS HE MEETS WITH THE LEADER OF
[000:12:29;565] CHINA.
[000:12:29;865] AN ALLY OF NORTH KOREA.
[000:12:32;501] HOW IMPORTANT A MEETING THAT NOW
[000:12:34;136] IS AS THE NEWS CONTINUES ON A
[000:12:37;339] FRIDAY AFTERNOON FROM THE FOX
[000:12:38;040] NEWS CHANNEL.
[000:14:39;662] So much lobster, so little time.
[000:14:42;064] At Red Lobster's Lobsterfest
[000:14:44;166] any of these 9 lobster dishes
[000:14:44;166] could be yours.
[000:14:46;835] So don't resist delicious new
[000:14:46;835] Lobster Mix and Match
[000:14:50;205] or Lobsterfest Surf and Turf
[000:14:51;507] because you won't have this
[000:14:51;507] chance for long.
[000:15:14;897] .
[000:15:15;130] >> AFTER ORDING THE STRIKE ON
[000:15:18;667] SYRIA, THE PRESIDENT HAD DINNER
[000:15:21;704] WITH XI JINPING.
[000:15:22;504] THAT HAD ABOUT 30 GUESTS AT THE
[000:15:24;840] PRESIDENT'S RESORT IN SOUTH
[000:15:26;842] FLORIDA.
[000:15:27;610] AN ANALYST SENT THE MESSAGE THAT
[000:15:29;111] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING TO GO
[000:15:30;679] IT ALONE WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING
[000:15:32;381] ON DANGEROUS DICTATORS, POSSIBLY
[000:15:35;317] EVEN CHINA'S ALLY IN NORTH
[000:15:39;421] KOREA.
[000:15:39;722] JOHN ROBERTS IS LIVE IN
[000:15:41;323] MAR-A-LARGO IN SOUTH FLORIDA.
[000:15:42;958] EXPLAIN HOW THIS DECISION CAME
[000:15:45;861] ABOUT, JOHN.
[000:15:46;595] >> SHEP, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.
[000:15:48;430] CLEARLY A LOT CHANGED FOR
[000:15:49;965] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:15:51;100] BACK IN 2013, DONALD TRUMP URGED
[000:15:55;004] PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT TO TAKE
[000:15:56;505] MILITARY ACTION IN SYRIA IN
[000:15:58;107] RESPONSE TO THAT AUGUST OF 2013
[000:16:03;946] SARIN GAS ATTACK THAT KILLED 14.
[000:16:05;948] BUT NOW HE LAUNCHED ATTACK HE
[000:16:07;883] DID LAST NIGHT.
[000:16:08;717] WHAT CHANGED?
[000:16:09;885] HAVING TO WEIGHT OF COMMAND ON
[000:16:10;986] HIS SHOULDERS, NOW HE'S
[000:16:12;421] PRESIDENT PLAYED A LOT INTO IT.
[000:16:14;223] SEEING THE HORRIFIC
[000:16:16;659] CHILDREN DEAD, DYING OR
[000:16:18;427] SUFFERING SO HORRIBLY PLAYED
[000:16:19;662] INTO IT AND THEN THERE'S THIS
[000:16:22;264] IDEA THAT IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD
[000:16:23;098] WERE TO GET AWAY WITH IT, THE
[000:16:25;167] USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS MIGHT
[000:16:27;503] BECOME SOMEWHAT NORMALIZED AND
[000:16:30;439] WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT
[000:16:31;607] THEY WOULD BE USED AGAINST THE
[000:16:32;741] UNITED STATES, WHICH PRESENTS
[000:16:35;577] THAT URGENT NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:16:37;012] THREAT THAT THE PRESIDENT CITED
[000:16:38;147] LAST NIGHT.
[000:16:38;747] THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
[000:16:41;083] UNFOLDED OVER THE COURSE OF 24
[000:16:43;585] HOURS AT FOUR MEETINGS WITH THE
[000:16:45;487] PRESIDENT AT 10:00 ON TUESDAY
[000:16:47;322] MORNING CULMINATING WITH THE
[000:16:51;160] MEETING HERE AT MAR-A-LARGO ON
[000:16:52;628] THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN WHICH THE
[000:16:53;529] PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION TO
[000:16:55;764] GO AHEAD AND DO IT AT 4:00 P.M.
[000:16:58;434] I'M TOLD THE PRESIDENT IS VERY
[000:17:00;135] PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE ATTACK
[000:17:01;503] WAS CARRIED OUT, PRAISING THE
[000:17:03;739] PERFORMANCE OF THE MILITARY
[000:17:05;507] AMONG MEMBERS OF HIS STAFF AND
[000:17:07;109] AS WELL, VERY HAPPY WITH THE
[000:17:09;244] GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THIS, WHICH
[000:17:10;512] MANY OF AMERICA'S ALLIES AND
[000:17:12;448] MOST OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES OF
[000:17:14;883] REGION OFFERING WORDS FOR
[000:17:16;618] SUPPORT FOR THE ACTION TAKEN IN
[000:17:19;021] SYRIA.
[000:17:19;321] >> Shepard: JOHN, ONE COUNTRY
[000:17:20;489] NOT SUPPORTING THIS IS RUSSIA.
[000:17:22;091] WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT
[000:17:24;293] RELATIONSHIP?
[000:17:24;727] >> AS JENNIFER GRIFFIN
[000:17:26;795] MENTIONED, THIS DEACONFLICTION
[000:17:39;007] LINE WILL BE TAKEN DOWN.
[000:17:45;047] AND DESPITE ALL THIS PUBLIC
[000:17:48;450] BLUSTER AND STATEMENTS, I'M TOLD
[000:17:50;185] BY SOURCES THAT ALONG OFFICIAL
[000:17:52;988] DIPLOMATIC LINES THERE'S VERY
[000:17:55;591] LITTLE BLOW-BACK FROM THE
[000:17:59;061] RUSSIANS.
[000:17:59;461] SEAN SPICER WAS HERE.
[000:18:01;730] I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT.
[000:18:02;631] >> THERE WAS NO CONTACT WITH
[000:18:05;067] RUSSIA.
[000:18:05;400] THE REST OF THE WORLD
[000:18:09;171] UNDERSTANDS THAT WE TOOK
[000:18:10;973] JUSTIFIABLE ACTION BASED ON THE
[000:18:15;477] TRAGIC ACTIONS THAT THE ASSAD
[000:18:16;411] REGIME TOOK.
[000:18:16;945] THIS IS AN ACTION THAT CANNOT BE
[000:18:20;349] TOLERATED.
[000:18:20;716] >> HERE'S WHERE THE TALE WILL BE
[000:18:23;485] TOLD.
[000:18:23;819] REX TILLERSON IS HEADED TO
[000:18:27;890] MOSCOW NEXT WEEK WHERE HE WILL
[000:18:29;691] MEET WITH HIS RUSSIAN COUNTER
[000:18:32;561] PART.
[000:18:32;928] TALK ABOUT BEING A FLY ON THE
[000:18:34;663] WALL, THAT WILL BE AN
[000:18:36;265] INTERESTING ONE TO BE A
[000:18:38;100] PARTICIPANT IN.
[000:18:40;102] SHEP?
[000:18:40;402] >> Shepard: STAY WARM, JOHN.
[000:18:42;504] LOOKS NICE THERE, DOESN'T IT?
[000:18:44;773] THE MISSILE STRIKE ON SYRIA WAS
[000:18:47;709] A MEASURED STEP.
[000:18:49;378] WE COULD SEE MORE OF IT.
[000:18:51;146] THOSE WORDS FROM THE UNITED
[000:18:52;948] NATIONS AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY
[000:18:57;519] TODAY.
[000:18:57;820] I'LL SPEAK WITH CHRIS WALLACE
[000:18:59;288] ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT.
[000:19:01;423] WE'LL HAVE LAWMAKERS LIVE HERE
[000:19:02;925] TO DISCUSSION THEIR REACTIONS
[000:19:04;459] AND HOW THIS COULD UNFOLD.
[000:19:06;361] IT'S A BUSY NEWS DAY.
[000:19:07;196] GLAD YOU'RE IN.
[000:20:08;790] I'm Thomas and
[000:20:08;790] I quit smoking
[000:20:10;459] with CHANTIX.
[000:20:11;293] I was very grateful
[000:20:11;293] to have CHANTIX.
[000:20:13;161] At times when I would
[000:20:13;161] normally go smoke,
[000:20:15;931] I just didn't.
[000:20:16;865] It's kind of like
[000:20:16;865] "Wait a minute,
[000:20:18;467] I would normally
[000:20:18;467] be running out
[000:20:19;968] the door to go grab
[000:20:19;968] a cigarette."
[000:20:21;603] Along with support,
[000:20:22;938] CHANTIX (varenicline) is proven
[000:20:22;938] to help people quit smoking.
[000:20:25;274] CHANTIX
[000:20:25;274] reduced my urge to smoke.
[000:20:27;542] Some people had changes
[000:20:27;542] in behavior, thinking or mood,
[000:20:29;878] hostility, agitation, depressed
[000:20:29;878] mood and suicidal thoughts
[000:20:32;748] or actions while taking or
[000:20:32;748] after stopping CHANTIX.
[000:20:35;284] Some reported seizures or
[000:20:35;284] sleepwalking with CHANTIX.
[000:20:37;619] If you have any of these,
[000:20:38;820] stop CHANTIX and call your
[000:20:38;820] doctor right away.
[000:20:40;722] Tell your doctor about any
[000:20:41;757] history of
[000:20:41;757] mental health problems,
[000:20:43;158] which could get worse
[000:20:43;158] or of seizures.
[000:20:44;960] Don't take CHANTIX
[000:20:44;960] if you've had a serious
[000:20:46;628] allergic or skin reaction to it.
[000:20:48;096] If you have these, stop CHANTIX
[000:20:48;096] and call your doctor right away
[000:20:50;899] as some can be life-threatening.
[000:20:52;234] Tell your doctor if you have
[000:20:52;234] heart or blood vessel problems,
[000:20:54;436] or develop new
[000:20:54;436] or worse symptoms.
[000:20:56;038] Get medical help right away
[000:20:56;038] if you have symptoms
[000:20:57;940] of a heart attack or stroke.
[000:20:59;107] Decrease alcohol use
[000:20:59;107] while taking CHANTIX.
[000:21:01;143] Use caution driving
[000:21:01;143] or operating machinery.
[000:21:03;378] Most common side effect
[000:21:03;378] is nausea.
[000:21:04;913] Thank you CHANTIX.
[000:21:06;381] Ask your doctor if CHANTIX
[000:21:06;381] is right for you.
[000:22:23;492] >> Shepard: IF YOU'RE GOING TO
[000:22:24;893] SUPPORT A BLOODY DICTATOR, THE
[000:22:28;030] WHOLE WORLD SHOULD KNOW IT.
[000:22:29;798] THAT'S WHAT NIKKI HALEY TOLD
[000:22:35;170] BOLIVIA.
[000:22:36;571] SHE SAYS BOLIVIA'S AMBASSADOR
[000:22:40;675] CALLED FOR A CLOSED DOOR MEETING
[000:22:42;110] AFTER THE STRIKE.
[000:22:43;211] BUT AS PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL,
[000:22:44;980] SHE'S A DECIDER.
[000:22:47;682] NIKKI HALEY IS HOLDING AN OPEN
[000:22:49;851] DOOR MEETING INSTEAD.
[000:22:50;919] ANY COUNTRY THAT CHOOSES TO
[000:22:52;554] DEFEND THE ATROCITIES OF THE
[000:22:55;290] REGIME WILL HAVE TO DO SO IN
[000:22:58;393] PUBLIC VIEW FOR THE WORLD TO
[000:23:00;962] HEAR.
[000:23:01;263] THE BOLIVIAN AMBASSADOR WELCOMED
[000:23:06;301] THE MEETING.
[000:23:07;702] >> THE UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
[000:23:09;805] MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.
[000:23:10;639] WE'RE PREPARED TO DO MORE.
[000:23:14;443] BUT WE HELP THAT WILL NOT BE
[000:23:16;578] NECESSARY.
[000:23:16;945] IT IS TIME FOR ALL CIVILIZED
[000:23:18;814] NATIONS TO STOP THE HORRORS THAT
[000:23:20;415] ARE TAKING PLACE IN SYRIA AND
[000:23:22;951] DEMAND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.
[000:23:26;054] >> AMBASSADOR HALEY CALLED OUT
[000:23:28;223] MOSCOW SAYING THE RUSSIANS HAVE
[000:23:30;292] STOOD BESIDE SYRIA EVERY TIME
[000:23:32;594] BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS CROSSED THE
[000:23:33;462] LINE OF HUMAN DECENCY.
[000:23:35;597] LET'S TURN TO CHRIS WALLACE.
[000:23:37;065] A LOT GOING ON AT THE U.N.
[000:23:40;469] >> WELL, A LOT IS GOING ON WITH
[000:23:42;871] THE TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY.
[000:23:44;306] THINK ABOUT WHAT A DRAMATIC
[000:23:46;041] STATEMENT THIS IS.
[000:23:47;008] THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO RAN
[000:23:48;310] SAYING HE WASN'T GOING TO GET
[000:23:55;450] INVOLVED AND THIS IS A PRESIDENT
[000:23:57;486] TRYING TO REACH OUT AND CREATE A
[000:23:59;020] NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
[000:24:00;922] KREMLIN.
[000:24:01;256] OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 24,
[000:24:03;191] 48 HOURS, ALL THAT HAS GONE OUT
[000:24:05;026] THE WINDOW.
[000:24:06;394] THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS
[000:24:08;763] INVOLVED IN SETTING A VERY
[000:24:10;398] BRIGHT -- YES, I'LL USE THE
[000:24:12;834] EXPRESSION RED LINE IN SYRIA --
[000:24:17;172] ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF ASSAD AND
[000:24:19;574] HIS SECRETARY OF STATE AND U.N.
[000:24:22;010] AMBASSADOR HAVE TAKEN ON RUSSIA
[000:24:23;311] AND TALKED ABOUT THEIR
[000:24:25;680] INVOLVEMENT AND COMPLICITY WITH
[000:24:28;416] THE AL-ASSAD REGIME AND ATTACKS
[000:24:30;152] ON CIVILIANS, A DRAMATIC
[000:24:32;587] TURN-AROUND IN TRUMP FOREIGN
[000:24:33;855] POLICY THIS WEEK.
[000:24:36;525] >> Shepard: HAVE YOU LEARNED
[000:24:37;659] ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS?
[000:24:38;994] THE IF THEN POSSIBILITY.
[000:24:41;129] IF ASSAD CARRIES OUT ANOTHER
[000:24:44;232] ATTACK LIKE THIS, THEN WHAT?
[000:24:46;001] >> I'M TOLD THERE'S QUITE A
[000:24:47;469] SPLIT.
[000:24:47;769] I'M TOLD BY A TOP U.S. OFFICIAL,
[000:24:49;571] THERE'S QUITE A SPLIT INSIDE THE
[000:24:51;907] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THAT
[000:24:53;008] GENERAL MATTIS, SECRETARY OF
[000:24:55;310] DEFENSE IS ONE OF THE HAWKS ON
[000:24:56;945] THIS.
[000:24:57;245] IN FACT, WANTED TO TAKE EVEN
[000:25:00;415] MORE ACTION IN THIS ATTACK
[000:25:02;250] YESTERDAY.
[000:25:02;617] THIS IS A VERY MEASURED ATTACK.
[000:25:05;754] YES, THEY FIRED 59 CRUISE
[000:25:08;456] MISSILES BUT IT'S ALL AT ONE AIR
[000:25:10;358] BASE AS GENERAL KEANE MENTIONED.
[000:25:13;962] ASSAD HAS SIX AIR BASES AND
[000:25:19;301] COULD HAVE GONE AT AFTER COMMAND
[000:25:21;236] AND CONTROL AND THE PRESIDENT
[000:25:22;837] PERSONALLY.
[000:25:23;238] THE PRESIDENT JUST DECIDED TO GO
[000:25:24;606] AFTER THE ONE BASE SPECIFICALLY
[000:25:27;442] TIED TO THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN
[000:25:32;914] NORTHERN IRAQ AND THE CIVILIANS
[000:25:34;649] THERE.
[000:25:35;083] MATTIS IS ONE OF THE HAWKS IN
[000:25:36;618] THIS REGARD AND STEVE BANNON,
[000:25:38;019] ONE OF THE AMERICAN FIRSTERS AND
[000:25:40;021] WHO IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE PUSHING
[000:25:43;458] DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE IDEA
[000:25:44;559] THAT WE SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED
[000:25:45;794] WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, WE SHOULD
[000:25:48;096] BE LOOKING TO THIS COUNTRY, HAS
[000:25:49;731] BEEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE PUSHING
[000:25:51;833] FOR RESTRAINT, SEEMS THAT IN HIS
[000:25:54;336] DECISION YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT
[000:25:55;537] TRUMP TOOK THE KIND OF HALF
[000:25:57;305] STEP.
[000:25:57;839] I THINK IT'S EASY TO ANSWER PART
[000:25:59;107] OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
[000:26:01;409] IF THERE WERE ANOTHER CHEMICAL
[000:26:03;078] WEAPONS ATTACK, THERE'S NO DOUBT
[000:26:05;714] THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD
[000:26:07;349] RESPOND AND ESCALATE HIS ATTACK.
[000:26:10;652] THE MORE INTERESTING QUESTION
[000:26:12;053] IS, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO AFTER
[000:26:13;255] THE REGIME, HE DIDN'T GET
[000:26:16;424] INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL WAR, HE
[000:26:18;893] MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT CHEMICAL
[000:26:20;729] WEAPONS, WHAT HAPPENS IF ASSAD
[000:26:22;931] GOES AFTER CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN

[000:27:49;617] THE NATION GETTING A NEW SUPREME

[000:27:53;121] IT'S NOT UNTIL THE BOTTOM OF THE

[000:27:56;458] AND WE'LL HAVE IT NEXT.
[000:28:45;073] There's only one egg
[000:28:46;207] that just tastes better.
[000:28:47;809] Fresher.
[000:28:48;376] More flavorful.
[000:28:49;744] Delicious.
[000:28:50;845] Only one egg
[000:28:51;813] with better nutrition-
[000:28:52;981] like more vitamins
[000:28:54;015] D, E, and Omega 3s.
[000:28:56;084] And 25% less saturated fat.
[000:28:59;487] Only one egg good enough
[000:29:01;189] for my family.
[000:29:02;323] Because why have ordinary
[000:29:03;992] when you can have the best.
[000:29:06;661] Eggland's Best.
[000:29:08;563] The only egg that
[000:29:09;531] gives you so much more:
[000:29:11;332] Better taste.

[000:30:25;673] JUDGE GORSUCH'S CONFIRMATION WAS
[000:30:33;781] PROMPTED BY THE NUCLEAR OPTION.

[000:30:49;831] GIVE THEM A CHOICE.
[000:30:51;699] MOST DEMOCRATS DID OPPOSE THE
[000:30:54;035] NOMINATION.
[000:30:54;435] SOME SAID IT WAS PARTLY BECAUSE

[000:34:09;230] GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

[000:34:15;703] >> THE ACTS OF MR. ASSAD, THERE
[000:34:18;639] NEEDS TO BE A RESPONSE.
[000:34:19;874] SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE
[000:34:21;743] APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.
[000:34:22;610] HAD HE COME TO CONGRESS FIRST,
[000:34:24;078] WE WOULD KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS
[000:34:25;379] BECAUSE A RESPONSE IS NOT A
[000:34:28;416] STRATEGY.
[000:34:29;917] YOU WHETHER IT
[000:34:30;685] WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO
[000:34:33;121] OR NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT
[000:34:34;522] THE STRATEGY IS.
[000:34:35;790] THE PRESIDENT JUST A WEEK AGO
[000:34:37;158] HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN OR AT LEAST
[000:34:40;161] WHAT HE SAID HOW -- WHAT HE WAS
[000:34:42;296] TALKING ABOUT.
[000:34:43;431] SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS -- IT
[000:34:45;399] IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESIDENT
[000:34:46;801] NOW TO COME TO CONGRESS WITH
[000:34:48;936] WHAT THAT STRATEGY IS AND IF
[000:34:51;272] THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL USE OF

[000:35:11;125] BABIES, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO
[000:35:12;260] TO CONGRESS BEFORE RETALIATING?
[000:35:13;728] >> I WISH HE CAME BEFORE.
[000:35:16;330] I BELIEVE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
[000:35:18;533] TO VOTE WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON
[000:35:21;102] DECIDED TO DO AIR STRIKES ON
[000:35:22;637] BOSNIA.

[000:36:06;414] THAT IS BEHIND IT, THEN WE --
[000:36:08;616] LET'S TALK.
[000:36:09;450] I'M WILLING TO HAVE THAT
[000:36:13;020] DIALOGUE.
[000:36:13;387] I NEED TO KNOW THE FACTS.
[000:36:14;856] THAT'S WHAT THE CONSTITUTION
[000:36:16;724] DEMANDS.
[000:36:17;058] THE HEAVIEST VOTE THAT A MEMBER
[000:36:18;860] OF CONGRESS HAS IS TO DETERMINE
[000:36:21;095] WHETHER OR NOT THAT WE ARE TO

[000:36:23;297] I DON'T WANT TO AVOID THAT
[000:36:25;666] SITUATION.
[000:36:26;033] I ASKED FOR IT ALSO WHEN
[000:36:28;302] PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS
[000:36:29;637] CONTEMPLATING UTILIZING MILITARY
[000:36:32;673] FORCE.
[000:36:32;974] PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO CONGRESS
[000:36:34;242] ASKING THEM TO YOU'D LIES -- TO
[000:36:36;177] GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY AND
[000:36:36;978] CONGRESS DECIDED NOT TO STEP UP
[000:36:38;946] TO THE PLATE.
[000:36:39;614] WE SHOULD STEP UP TO THE PLATE.
[000:36:42;049] BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S THIS
[000:36:43;718] PRESIDENT OR ANY PRESIDENT, WE
[000:36:46;754] SHOULD NOT SHARE WHAT OUR
[000:36:49;857] RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UNDER THE
[000:36:52;293] UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
[000:36:54;295] >> Shepard: WHAT ALLY DO YOU
[000:36:55;563] EXPECT TO SEE INVOLVED NOW?

[000:37:04;171] BY SECRETARY POWELL, ONCE YOU
[000:37:05;940] BREAK SOMETHING, YOU OWN IT.
[000:37:07;742] SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL
[000:37:09;443] OF OUR ALLIES IN THE GULF STATES
[000:37:11;746] ARE THERE AS WELL AS OUR

[000:37:20;621] IT IS A VIOLATION OF
[000:37:22;023] INTERNATIONAL LAW.
[000:37:23;524] I THINK THAT IS CLEAR.
[000:37:24;625] WE ALL NEED TO STOP AND TRY TO

[000:37:47;581] STATEMENT ON THIS MATTER.
[000:37:48;916] YOU BELIEVE THAT SYRIAN REFUGEES

[000:37:52;620] STATES AS THEY ARE IN SO MANY
[000:37:53;955] OTHER COUNTRIES.

[000:38:00;528] ENOUGH IN YOUR MIND FOR THE

[000:38:13;841] HAD BEEN VETTEDED FOR TWO YEARS
[000:38:15;843] AND MAKE THE DETERMINATION AND

[000:38:38;366] THINK IS A MISTAKE.

[000:39:18;072] DICTATOR DIDN'T CHANGE.
[000:39:18;906] OUR ACTIONS CHANGED.
[000:39:20;074] WAS IT WARRANTED AND IF SO WHAT
[000:39:21;542] THE IS WARRANTED GOING FORWARD?
[000:39:25;579] >> I DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS AN
[000:39:27;882] APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.
[000:39:28;949] IT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD
[000:39:29;884] HAVE DONE AFTER THE FIRST USE OF
[000:39:33;020] CHEMICAL WEAPONS OF THE SYRIAN
[000:39:35;222] PEOPLE.
[000:39:35;556] SHOULD HAVE BEEN SWIFT AND
[000:39:39;760] DECISIVE AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY
[000:39:41;662] MADE A DIFFERENCE.
[000:39:43;030] THE PRESIDENT DITHERED.
[000:39:44;632] HE DIDN'T ASK FOR AN
[000:39:47;601] AUTHORIZATION.
[000:39:48;035] PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT ALLOW
[000:39:49;203] THE MOMENT TO PASS, SO I SUPPORT
[000:39:52;873] HIS VERY MEASURED RESPONSE TO
[000:39:55;042] THIS ATROCITY.
[000:39:56;043] >> SHOULD THE SYRIAN DICTATOR
[000:39:58;245] STRIKE AGAIN ON HIS OWN PEOPLE
[000:39:59;280] WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS, SHOULD
[000:40:03;084] THE PRESIDENT TAKE OUT HIS AIR
[000:40:04;518] FORCE?
[000:40:04;819] >> WE SHOULD RESPOND IN KIND
[000:40:07;822] PROPORTIONATE WITH WHATEVER
[000:40:10;357] MEASURES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION
[000:40:11;258] WOULD DEEM APPROPRIATE.
[000:40:12;960] I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE A
[000:40:14;495] STEPPED UP RESPONSE.
[000:40:15;930] >> HE'S BEEN USING BARREL BOMBS
[000:40:17;264] FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST
[000:40:19;767] FIVE YEARS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.
[000:40:21;569] VERY CRUDE BOMBS THAT ARE TOSSED
[000:40:23;037] FROM HELICOPTERS OR FIXED-WING
[000:40:26;574] PLANES.
[000:40:26;907] THEY KILL EVERY ONE IN THE
[000:40:29;243] VICINITY THE SAME WAY THESE DO.
[000:40:31;245] IF WE RESPOND TO THIS SARIN GAS
[000:40:37;618] ATTACK, SHOULD WE RESPOND TO   N
[000:40:40;387] CONVENTIONAL ATTACKS?
[000:40:42;490] >> WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
[000:40:43;824] THIS GENOCIDE IS CONTINUING
[000:40:44;992] WITHOUT A RESPONSE.
[000:40:46;861] BUT THAT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
[000:40:47;995] CHOICE NOT TO RESPOND, NOT TO
[000:40:51;765] COME TO CONGRESS WITH ROBUST
[000:40:54;568] AUTHORIZATION.
[000:40:55;002] SOMETHING THAT DID NOT TIE THE
[000:40:55;903] HANDS OF THE FUTURE PRESIDENT.
[000:40:57;838] THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD
[000:41:00;341] GET AN AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF
[000:41:03;244] MILITARY FORCE.
[000:41:03;711] IT WAS TOO WEAK.
[000:41:05;379] HE NEVER TOLD THE AMERICAN
[000:41:06;947] PUBLIC WHY SYRIA IS IN AMERICA'S
[000:41:09;817] NATIONAL INTEREST.
[000:41:11;385] WE'VE SEEN THE MIGRANT FLOW AND
[000:41:13;120] THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
[000:41:14;922] FLOWING TO EUROPE DETABLIZING
[000:41:17;525] THOSE COUNTRIES AND PUTTING INTO
[000:41:20;060] RISK THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM.
[000:41:22;062] IT'S ABOUT TIME WE'RE REACTING.
[000:41:24;465] IT'S IN RESPONSE TO ILLEGAL WAR
[000:41:26;367] CRIME TYPES OF ACTIONS.
[000:41:28;569] I GUESS WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER
[000:41:31;372] MEASURES WE SHOULD IN ANSWER TO
[000:41:32;907] THAT PROVOCATION.
[000:41:33;908] >> Shepard: WHAT SHOULD THE
[000:41:34;742] LIMIT OF OUR RESPONSE BE IN THE
[000:41:36;644] SYRIAN WAR?
[000:41:38;112] >> FROM MY STANDPOINT, IF WE'RE
[000:41:40;080] GOING TO GET EMBROILED MORE IN
[000:41:42;383] THE WAR, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
[000:41:43;951] THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME TO THE
[000:41:45;152] AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS TO
[000:41:46;387] LOOK FOR AN AUTHORIZATION.
[000:41:47;421] BY PRESENT, I DO NOT BELIEVE HE
[000:41:51;859] NEEDS AUTHORIZATION IN TERMS OF
[000:41:53;260] DEFEATING ISIS, WHICH IS NOW IN
[000:41:55;329] SYRIA.
[000:41:55;629] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO
[000:41:58;365] SITUATIONS HERE.
[000:41:58;866] THIS RESPONSE WAS A ONE-TIME
[000:42:01;635] RESPONSE HOPEFULLY TO DETER
[000:42:04;572] FUTURE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:42:07;074] IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE
[000:42:09;476] SYRIAN SITUATION, OUR FIRST STEP
[000:42:12;513] IS TO DEFEAT ISISLE NOW WE HAVE
[000:42:15;182] TO ASK OUR SAYS QUESTION.
[000:42:16;684] WHO WILL DEFEAT ISIS FORCES IN
[000:42:19;153] RAQQA AND WHO WILL HOLD THE
[000:42:21;956] GROUND.
[000:42:22;289] THAT COULD MAKE A DIPLOMATIC
[000:42:24;625] SOLUTION POSSIBLE.
[000:42:25;359] >> BACK TO AL-ASSAD.
[000:42:26;961] SHOULD THERE BE A REGIME CHANGE?
[000:42:28;896] >> I DON'T SEE HOW A DICTATOR, A
[000:42:31;131] LEADER OF A COUNTRY WHO HAS
[000:42:35;636] SLAUGHTERED 500,000 CITIZENS
[000:42:38;405] WILL LAST LONG-TERM.
[000:42:39;506] THE SAD FACT, BECAUSE OF OUR
[000:42:41;008] LACK OF INVOLVEMENT, WEAKNESS,
[000:42:43;844] WE CREATED A VACUUM.
[000:42:47;748] IRAN AND RUSSIA HAS FILLED THE
[000:42:52;119] VACUUM.
[000:42:52;453] THEY HAVE SOLIDIFIED THEIR
[000:42:54;955] POSITION IN WESTERN SYRIA.
[000:42:56;924] WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE FACTS ON
[000:42:58;425] THE GROUND AND MIGHT ALLOW FOR A
[000:43:00;761] DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.
[000:43:01;562] >> IRAN, RUSSIA AND HEZBOLLAH
[000:43:06;400] ARE ALL BACKING THE SYRIANS.
[000:43:08;335] SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENGAGE
[000:43:09;403] IN THAT FIGHT, YOU'VE SAID HERE
[000:43:11;805] THAT WE SHOULD RESPOND IN KIND
[000:43:14;708] IF THERE IS BARREL BOMBING AND
[000:43:17;411] THE LIKE.
[000:43:18;345] SHOULD THE UNITED STATES PIT
[000:43:19;847] ITSELF AGAINST THOSE THREE
[000:43:22;049] POWERS AT THE SAME TIME AND DO
[000:43:23;550] YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT
[000:43:24;285] SPREAD SOMETHING.
[000:43:24;918] >> THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:43:26;453] IS OUTLAWED INTERNATIONALLY.
[000:43:29;223] THAT ALLOW AS CERTAIN RESPONSE.
[000:43:31;859] >> BARREL BOMBING IS AS WELL.
[000:43:33;360] >> I UNDERSTAND.
[000:43:34;962] AGAIN, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE
[000:43:36;530] WORLD DIDN'T RESPONSE.
[000:43:37;398] WE'RE RESPONDING NOW.
[000:43:39;733] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR RUSSIA AND
[000:43:41;235] IRAN TO DEFEND THE USE OF
[000:43:44;204] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:43:45;205] IT WAS RUSSIA INVOLVED IN
[000:43:47;408] PRECISION BOMBING OF HOSPITALS
[000:43:49;510] AND HUMANITARIAN ENVOYS.
[000:43:52;479] THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID
[000:43:53;681] NOTHING OTHER THAN TALK ABOUT
[000:43:54;982] SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.
[000:43:56;950] THIS PRESIDENT PRODUCED REAL
[000:43:58;952] CONSEQUENCES.
[000:43:59;386] A VERY MEASURED AND VERY
[000:44:02;089] DIRECTED APPROACH TO TRY TO
[000:44:04;491] DETER FURTHER USE OF CHEMICAL
[000:44:06;226] WEAPONS.
[000:44:06;560] I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT GOES FROM
[000:44:07;995] HERE.
[000:44:08;295] MY STANDPOINT, THE TRUMP
[000:44:09;797] ADMINISTRATION SHOULD LAY OUT A
[000:44:12;066] STRATEGY, SHOULD ESTABLISH SOME
[000:44:13;500] GOALS.
[000:44:13;867] COME TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,
[000:44:15;769] COME TO CONGRESS FOR
[000:44:17;104] AUTHORIZATION IF HE DECIDES TO
[000:44:19;306] DO SOMETHING MORE ROBUST.
[000:44:21;108] >> DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICANS
[000:44:22;343] AGREEING ON THAT.
[000:44:23;410] SENATOR RON JOHNSON, THE
[000:44:25;512] REPUBLICAN OF WISCONSIN.
[000:44:26;513] GRADE TO BE HERE.
[000:44:29;016] >> HAVE A GREAT DAY.
[000:44:29;817] >> Shepard: ONE ANALYST SAID THE
[000:44:31;251] STRIKE COULD LEAD TO A POLITICAL
[000:44:33;454] SOLUTION AND THERE'S A CLEAR
[000:44:34;588] PATH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GET
[000:44:37;057] THERE.
[000:44:37;358] WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?
[000:44:38;525] I'LL SPEAK WITH THAT ANALYST
[000:44:39;226] NEXT.

[000:45:15;729] WHO'S WITH ME?
[000:45:16;830] WE'RE LIKE A BASKETBALL
[000:45:16;830] TEAM HERE AT ALLY.
[000:45:18;232] IF A BASKETBALL

[000:47:50;150] MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA.
[000:47:52;753] MICHAEL HANLAN IS HERE FROM THE
[000:47:57;391] BROOKINGS INSTITUTE.
[000:47:58;859] WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT?
[000:48:02;195] >> SHEPARD, WELL, I THINK IT WAS
[000:48:03;830] A GOOD STRIKE FOR THE PURPOSES
[000:48:05;632] THAT WERE ANNOUNCED AND THE
[000:48:06;967] PURPOSES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[000:48:08;535] ANNOUNCED.
[000:48:08;902] LEAVES A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF
[000:48:10;571] WHAT COMES NEXT.
[000:48:11;972] I THINK IT WAS WELL-DONE.
[000:48:12;739] >> Shepard: WHAT IS THE EFFECT
[000:48:14;308] OF THAT STRIKE PRACTICALLY
[000:48:17;277] SPEAKING?
[000:48:17;811] >> WELL, MILITARILY SPEAKING,
[000:48:20;414] MOST OF US WOULD AGREE.
[000:48:21;982] NOT VERY MUCH.
[000:48:23;350] I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THERE WERE
[000:48:25;752] MANY AIRCRAFT DAMAGED.
[000:48:27;220] MAY HAVE BEEN A FEW.
[000:48:28;488] IN TERMS OF ANY KIND OF
[000:48:31;291] MUNITIONS THAT ASSAD NEEDS, AS
[000:48:32;893] POINTED OUT, HE DOESN'T NEED
[000:48:34;361] MUCH IN THE WAY OF TECHNOLOGY
[000:48:36;830] FOR THE TACTICS HE'S EMPLOYING.
[000:48:39;299] IT WAS DESIGNED AGAINST ONE AIR
[000:48:41;268] BASE OUT OF A DOZEN IN THE
[000:48:43;904] COUNTRY.
[000:48:44;237] IT IS MOSTLY TO SEND A MESSAGE.
[000:48:49;610] MORE OF A RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF
[000:48:51;612] DETERRENCE.
[000:48:52;012] IT DOESN'T TELL US WHAT
[000:48:54;548] MR. TRUMP MIGHT DO NEXT.
[000:48:56;383] HE HAS TO THINK HARD ABOUT THAT.
[000:48:58;085] THERE'S GOOD OPTIONS.
[000:48:59;786] SOME INVOLVE COOPERATION WITH
[000:49:04;024] RUSSIA.
[000:49:04;358] THEY'RE NOT OBVIOUS.
[000:49:06;259] >> THIS RUSSIAN BLUSTER, HOW DO
[000:49:08;428] YOU READ IT?
[000:49:09;429] >> WELL, I THINK THE RUSSIANS
[000:49:13;266] WILL VET NOR AWHILE.
[000:49:14;501] FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE'VE BEEN
[000:49:15;902] BEATING HIM UP FOR VIOLATIONS OF
[000:49:18;071] INTERNATIONAL LAW.
[000:49:19;072] FOR EXAMPLE, HE'S USED THE
[000:49:20;907] SEIZURE AND ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA
[000:49:23;410] AS JUSTIFIABLE BECAUSE IT WAS
[000:49:25;012] RUSSIAN FOR SO MANY CENTURIES.
[000:49:27;514] BUT WE GET ON OUR HIGH HORSE AND
[000:49:30;283] BLAME HIM FOR THE WORST CRISIS
[000:49:32;352] IN EUROPE SINCE WORLD WAR II AND
[000:49:34;721] WE DON'T GET A U.N. RESOLUTION
[000:49:37;391] TO INVADE IRAQ AND WE INVADE
[000:49:45;132] LIBYA.
[000:49:45;432] SO HE IS GOING TO CARRY OUT
[000:49:47;601] PAY-BACK RIGHT NOW.
[000:49:48;368] I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO
[000:49:49;770] NECESSARILY IMPEDE US GETTING
[000:49:51;872] BACK TO BUSINESS NEXT WEEK WHEN
[000:49:53;974] I BELIEVE MR. TILLERSON IS
[000:49:55;475] SCHEDULED TO VISIT MOSCOW.
[000:49:56;710] I HOPE WE CAN START THE
[000:50:02;082] COOPERATI
[000:50:03;283] COOPERATION.
[000:50:03;684] IT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.
[000:50:04;351] BUT THERE'S WAYS TO EACH OF US
[000:50:05;252] GETTING MOST OF WHAT WE WANT.
[000:50:07;120] >> FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF
[000:50:08;955] AL-ASSAD, HOW MUCH DANGER IS
[000:50:09;923] THERE THAT HE WOULD PUSH THIS
[000:50:12;926] TOWARD ESCALATION?
[000:50:13;994] >> I THINK SO FAR VERY LITTLE.
[000:50:15;862] BECAUSE HE HAS TO KNOW THAT THE
[000:50:18;031] PUNISHMENT THAT HE RECEIVED
[000:50:19;399] YESTERDAY WAS VERY MINOR
[000:50:21;268] COMPARED TO WHAT WE COULD DO.
[000:50:23;503] THERE'S NO REASON FOR HIM THERE
[000:50:24;571] TO WANT TO RUN THE RISK OF
[000:50:25;972] PICKING A FIGHT WITH A SUPER
[000:50:29;009] POWER.
[000:50:29;309] AT THE MOMENT, ALL WE'VE SAID
[000:50:31;078] FOR SURE IS WE WANT TO DEFEAT
[000:50:33;180] ISIS AND WE WON'T LET HIM USE
[000:50:34;948] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:50:37;784] OTHERWISE, IT'S FREE GAME FOR
[000:50:38;885] HIM WHAT HE WILL LIKELY DO IS
[000:50:41;021] KEEP FIGHTING THE WAR WITHOUT
[000:50:42;489] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:50:45;225] AFTER ALL, 99% OF THE KILLING
[000:50:48;028] HE'S DONE IS WITH BARREL BOMBS
[000:50:49;329] AS THE MAJOR PROBLEM IN THIS
[000:50:50;831] CONFLICT SO FAR.
[000:50:51;998] SO MY EXPECTATION IS HE WILL SEE
[000:50:54;701] IF HE CAN RIDE OUT YESTERDAY'S
[000:50:56;403] STRIKE AND HAVE THAT BE THE END
[000:50:58;071] OF IT.

[000:51:11;718] THE LATEST STRIKE WAS TODAY AND
[000:51:13;553] THE UPDATE IS NEXT.
[000:51:17;390] Yeah, my dad says our

[000:51:47;854] Woman:
[000:51:47;854] On the Gulf Coast,
[000:51:48;922] new ExxonMobil projects
[000:51:50;290] are expected to create
[000:51:50;290] over 45,000 jobs.
[000:51:53;326] And each job created
[000:51:53;326] by the energy industry
[000:51:55;862] supports two others
[000:51:55;862] in the community.
[000:51:57;898] Altogether,
[000:51:59;099] the industry supports over
[000:51:59;099] 9 million jobs nationwide.
[000:52:02;569] These are jobs that natural
[000:52:02;569] gas is helping make happen,
[000:52:05;372] all while reducing
[000:52:05;372] America's emissions.
[000:52:08;375] Energy lives here.

[000:54:48;818] THE SWEDISH MINISTER CALLING IT
[000:54:50;253] AN ATTACK OF TERROR.
[000:54:52;889] IT HAPPENED IN STOCKHOLM.
[000:54:54;391] OFFICIALS SAY THEY STOPPED ALL
[000:54:55;458] THE TRAINS OUT OF THE STATION.
[000:54:57;727] TWO LARGE SHOPPING MALLS ALSO

[000:55:00;096] POLICE SAY THIS IS AN IMAGE OF
[000:55:03;133] MAN THEY ARRESTED.
[000:55:04;267] THEY RELEASED A PHOTO EARLIER

[000:55:07;771] NO WORD ON WHETHER THEY'RE
[000:55:09;839] LOOKING FOR OTHER SUSPECTS.
[000:55:12;042] THIS IS RIGHT AFTER THE CRASH.

[000:55:16;179] THAT IS THE VEHICLE THAT BEER
[000:55:18;248] TRUCK THAT RAMMED INTO THE
[000:55:19;249] DEPARTMENT STORE.
[000:55:19;949] PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO
[000:55:21;985] RUN THERE.

[000:55:25;422] BUILDING.
[000:55:25;789] FLAMES BURNING IN THE SPOT WHERE
[000:55:28;692] IT HIT.
[000:55:29;426] HERE'S PEOPLE BEING TREATED ON
[000:55:32;529] THE PAVEMENT, THE COBBLESTONE.
[000:55:39;069] THE TRUCK ATTACKS ARE ALL TOO
[000:55:42;405] FAMILIAR.
[000:55:42;806] POLICE ARE TAKING EXTRA
[000:55:45;408] PRECAUTION.
[000:55:46;076] AFGHANISTAN IS THE SITE OF
[000:55:48;111] AMERICA'S LARGEST WAR.
[000:55:48;912] IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE
[000:55:50;747] TO BE MIRED IN FIGHTING THERE,
[000:55:52;215] IT'S THE RUSSIANS.
[000:55:53;383] BUT THE RUSSIANS CALLED IT QUITS
[000:55:56;353] ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY.
[000:56:00;890] Hey, ready for the big meeting?
[000:57:06;823] Yeah.
[000:57:08;558] Uh, hello!?
[000:57:09;692] A meeting?
[000:57:10;693] It's a big one.
[000:57:11;694] Too bad.
[000:57:11;694] We are double booked:
[000:57:13;062] diarrhea and
[000:57:13;062] abdominal pain.
[000:57:15;765] Why don't you start
[000:57:15;765] without me?
[000:57:17;300] Oh. Yeah.
[000:57:20;170] If you're living with frequent,
[000:57:21;438] unpredictable diarrhea
[000:57:21;438] and abdominal pain,
[000:57:23;039] you may have...
[000:57:24;140] ...Irritable Bowel Syndrome
[000:57:24;140] with Diarrhea,
[000:57:25;708] or IBS-D.
[000:57:26;810] A condition that can
[000:57:26;810] be really frustrating.
[000:57:28;711] Talk to your doctor
[000:57:28;711] about VIBERZI,
[000:57:30;713] a different way to treat IBS-D.
[000:57:32;182] VIBERZI is a
[000:57:32;182] prescription medication
[000:57:33;950] you take every day
[000:57:35;185] that helps proactively manage
[000:57:36;352] both diarrhea and abdominal pain
[000:57:37;687] at the same time.
[000:57:38;855] So you stay ahead of
[000:57:38;855] your symptoms.
[000:57:40;590] VIBERZI can cause new or
[000:57:40;590] worsening abdominal pain.
[000:57:43;226] Do not take VIBERZI if you have
[000:57:43;226] or may have had:
[000:57:45;361] pancreas or
[000:57:45;361] severe liver problems,
[000:57:47;163] problems with alcohol abuse,
[000:57:48;364] long-lasting or
[000:57:48;364] severe constipation,
[000:57:50;166] or a blockage of your bowel
[000:57:50;166] or gallbladder.
[000:57:52;135] If you are taking VIBERZI,
[000:57:53;436] you should not take medicines
[000:57:53;436] that cause constipation.
[000:57:55;238] The most common side effects of
[000:57:55;238] VIBERZI include
[000:57:57;607] constipation, nausea, and
[000:57:57;607] abdominal pain.
[000:58:00;743] Stay ahead of IBS-D...
[000:58:02;612] ...with VIBERZI.
