126
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
ONE, PLAZA ELEMENTARY

127
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000

WHICH WE WATCHED AS

132
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
RESIDENTS WERE TRYING TO

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
BRING PEOPLE FROM

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE THE

TORNADO SWEPT RIGHT OVER.

138
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES

139
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
COMING IN.

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IT'S JUST THREE MINUTES

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
PAST 6:00 IN THE CENTRAL

142
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
TIME ZONE AND IN MOORE

143
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
OKLAHOMA A THE FOREVER

144
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
PIEWLS OUT YOU CAN SEE THE

145
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
PATH THAT THIS STORM CUT.

146
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OUR STORM CHASER MENTIONED

147
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A STORM THAT HIT IN 1999

148
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
THAT IS THE BELLWETHER FOR

149
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
EVERYBODY IN THIS PART OF

150
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THE COUNTRY.

151
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
IT CUT A PATH THROUGH MOORE

152
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
AND SURROUNDING AREAS LIKE

153
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
NOTHING ANYONE HAD EVER

154
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
SEEN.
THE PATH OF THIS ONE IS

155
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
SIMILAR, THOUGH LONGER,

156
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SIMILAR, THOUGH WIDER.

157
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
SO THIS STORM IS SIMILAR

158
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
BUT WORSE.

159
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
AND THAT WAS THE STORM BY

160
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WHICH ALL OTHERS WERE JUDGE

161
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
DOLLARS.
IT IS AS IF HURRICANE

162
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
CAMILLE IN SOUTH

163
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA

164
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
WAS ORIGINALLY YOUR

165
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
HURRICANE OF RECORD.

166
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THIS IS THE THING TO WHICH

167
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WE POINT AS THE WORST IT

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
CAN BE.

169
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
THAT IS UNTIL HURRICANE

170
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
KATRINA CAME THROUGH.

171
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
AND CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE

172
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ENTIRELY IT IS OUR BELIEF

173
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE

174
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HAVE HAD HERE.

175
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS AFTER

176
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
999, THE PROBLEM WAS THAT

177
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE

178
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
ADEQUATE STORM SHELTERS.

179
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
THERE WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH

180
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

181
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
STORM SHELTERS.

182
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEMS
WERE NOT UP TO DATE THERE

183
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH TO DO

184
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
THAT AND TODAY THEY GOT 16

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
MINUTES' WARNING WHICH, IN

186
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000

TIME THAT STORMS WERE ON

188
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000

747
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
TOWN OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
WHERE THE CHOPPERS CONTINUE

748
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
TO HOVER ABOVE WHAT IS JUST

749
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
AN UNBELIEVABLE SCENE.

750
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
A HOME AFTER HOME BUSINESS

751
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
AFTER BUSINESS.

752
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
EVEN SOME SCHOOLS SCHOOLS

753
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
DEVASTATED WITH A MASSIVE

754
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
TORNADO CAME ROARING

755
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
THROUGH TODAY.
AND DOWN BELOW YOU CAN SEE

756
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO

757
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
BECOME RESCUERS THIS

758
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
AFTERNOON LOOKING FOR

759
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE

760
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
TRAPPED BENEATH ANYBODY WHO

761
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
MIGHT NEED HELP:  THEY ARE

762
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
COMPARING THIS TO THE GREAT

763
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
STORM OF 1999 WHICH RECORD

764
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
THROUGH THIS AREA BETWEEN

765
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
9:00 P.M. AND MIDNIGHT.

766
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS DARK

767
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
OUTSIDE.
MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE

768
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
SHELTER.

769
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
THIS AFTERNOON'S STORM HIT

770
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
AROUND 3:00 LOCAL TIME AND

771
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
ON THE GROUND FOR 45

772
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
MINUTES.
LIGHT OF DAY AND MANY OF

773
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THEM HOPEFULLY GET AWAY.

774
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OFFICIALLY THE DEATH TOLL

775
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
IS AT 6 THUS FAR.

776
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
BUT WE KNOW OF FOUR PEOPLE

777
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING

778
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
OF THE LOCAL NBC STATION OR

779
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I SHOULD SAY THE CBS

780
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
STATION WHO DIED WHILE

781
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
TRYING TO SHELTER IN A

782
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
FREEZER AND FOUR OTHERS WHO

783
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
DIED AT 7/11.

784
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
COMMUNICATIONS ARE
IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS POINT.

785
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
AND THE NUMBERS LIKE THAT

786
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
WILL BE HARD TO COME BY FOR

787
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

788
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
OUR METEOROLOGIST RICK

789
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
REICHMUTH WAS IN THE AREA

790
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
COVERING THE STORMS WHICH

791
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
HIT LAST NIGHT AND

792
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
ANTICIPATING THOSE FROM

793
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
TODAY.
RICK, THIS IS HARD TO

794
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
BELIEVE.

795
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
>> IT'S VERY HARD TO

796
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
BELIEVE, SHEP.
YOU KNOW, WE HE HAVE BEEN

797
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
UNDER THIS THREAT AND THESE

798
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
BIG CITIES FOR A COUPLE

799
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
DAYS.
STORM CUTTING TO THE.

800
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
CUTTING JUST TO THE SOUTH

801
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
AND MOORE.

802
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
TWO DAYS THAT THEY HAVE

803
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
BEEN DEALING WITH.

804
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
YOU KNOW, AFTER YOU HAD

805
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY

806
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
REALLY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE

807
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

808
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD

809
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
HAPPEN THAT BIG AGAIN.

810
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

811
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING HARD

812
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
TIME GETTING THEIR MINDS

813
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
AROUND EXACTLY HOW BIG THIS

814
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
IS.
>> Shepard: USUALLY RICK,

815
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
AFTER A TORNADO LIKE THIS

816
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
HITS THE FRONT MOVES ON

817
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
AND YOU ARE ABLE TO AT

818
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
LEAST CLEAN UP AFTER WHAT'S

819
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
HAPPENED.
THIS TIME IT'S DAY AFTER

820
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
DAY.

821
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
WHY?
>>
>> IT HAS BEEN.

822
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
IT'S A REALLY SLOW MOVING

823
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
SYSTEM IS.

824
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
WE HAVE A MODERATE RISK

825
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
ISSUED FOR SEVERE WEATHER

826
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
TOMORROW AGAIN JUST A

827
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
LITTLE BIT FARTHER OFF

828
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
TOWARD THE EAST.
IT IT'S A SLOW-MOVER.

829
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
TOMORROW THIS PARTICULAR

830
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
AREA IS OUT OF THE RISK

831
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
IT'S GOING TO BE A COOLER

832
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
DAY.

833
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
SO THEY ARE DONE WITH IT WE

834
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
ARE STILL PROBABLY GOING TO

835
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
SEE A FEW MORE SHOWERS GO

836
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
THROUGH.

837
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
THE BIG SEVERE WEATHER AT

838
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
LEAST THE OKLAHOMA CITY

839
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
AREA RIGHT NOW IS GONE.

840
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
>> Shepard: RICK REICHMUTH.

841
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF YOUR

842
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
SCREEN CONTINUE ITING

843
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
COVERAGE FROM LIVE CHOPPER

844
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
PICTURES.

845
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
IT IS ASTOUNDING TO SEE

846
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
OKLAHOMANS DO WHAT

847
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
OKLAHOMANS HAVE SO MANY

848
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
TIMES.

849
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THOSE WHO SURVIVED HAVE

850
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
BECOME RESCUE WORKERS.
THIS IS THE CASE,

851
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER

852
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
NEIGHBORHOOD ACROSS THIS

853
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
DEVASTATED AREA.

854
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
AFTER THE TORNADO BLEW

855
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
THROUGH AND THE CAME OUT.

856
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
MANY RAN TOWARD THESE TWO

857
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS BRIAR
WOOD ELEMENTARY AND THE

858
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OTHER ESCAPES ME AT THE

859
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
MOMENT WITHOUT NOTES IN

860
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
FRONT OF ME TO TRY TO JUST

861
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
SAVE THEIR NEIGHBORS.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

862
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
RIGHT NOW.

863
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
WE THE PLAZA TOWERS

864
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS THAT

865
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
SECOND ONE.
THE TRUTH IS, THEY WON'T BE

866
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
ABLE TO GET THEIR HANDLE ON

867
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
THIS AT LEAST UNTIL SOME

868
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
TIME TOMORROW BECAUSE THE

869
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
COMMUNICATIONS ARE SO BAD.

870
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
6:27 P.M. THERE.

871
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
IN THE CENTRAL TIME ZONE

872
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
AND THE SUN WILL SET

873
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
SHORTLY.
VASTLY COMPLICATING MATTERS

874
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE.

875
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
IN MANY CASES THEY ARE

876
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
CERTAINLY NO ELECTRICITY.

877
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION.

878
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
THE SALVATION ARMY AND THE

879
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
RED CROSS ARE SETTING UP

880
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
SHELTERS FOR PEOPLE WHO

881
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
NEED THEM.

882
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
AND THE NUMBERS WILL BE

883
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
MANY.

884
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
OUR CASEY STEGALL IS IN THE

885
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
AREA AND HAS BEEN REPORTING

886
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
ON WHAT HE HAS SEEN FROM

887
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
THIS 7/11 THAT WAS BLOWN

888
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
AWAY.
THAT IS JUST ONE TINY AREA

889
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
OF HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

890
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
ACROSS THAT SPOT THAT ARE

891
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
TRYING TO DEAL WITH HOW TO

892
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
MOVE ON.

893
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
>> IT IS, IT'S VERY

894
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
ISOLATED.
AS YOU START TO DRIVE IN

895
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
YOU SEE THAT THIS IS

896
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
PLAYING OUT REALLY FOR

897
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
MILES AND MILES AND MILES

898
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
ALL AROUND.

899
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THE NATIONAL WEATHER

900
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
SERVICE, IN FACT, SAYING

901
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
THAT THERE WERE SOME

902
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
20 MILES SCORED INTO THE
EARTH WHEN THIS THING CAME

903
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
THROUGH.

904
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
REALLY WANT I WANT TO GET

905
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
OUT OF OF THE WAY AND GET

906
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
BACK TO IT I'M GETTING

907
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
FEEDBACK IN MY EAR.

908
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
BEAR WITH ME.

909
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY RAW AS WE

910
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
ARE TRYING TO GET THIS OUT

911
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
TO YOU.

912
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
DESCRIBING TO YOU EARLIER.

913
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
PEOPLE DIGGING AT THE

914
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
RUBBLE AT THE REAR OF THIS

915
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
7/11.

916
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR

917
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
SOMEBODY I'M LOOKING ALL

918
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
AROUND.
AND I SEE THIS GOING ON

919
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
BACK IN THE DISTANCE WHERE

920
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
THAT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD JUST

921
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

922
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING

923
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
BOTTLES.
THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING

924
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
DEBRIS OVER THERE AND IT'S

925
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
PLAYING OUT I SEE IT IN

926
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
THREE SPOTS IN THE

927
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
BACKGROUND PEOPLE DIGGING

928
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
THROUGH THE RUBBLE TRYING

929
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS UNDER

930
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
IT AND IF SOMEONE IS ALIVE

931
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
WE KNOW THE NEWS

932
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
HELICOPTERS NO-FLY ZONE.

933
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
CHOPPERS UP BECAUSE THEY

UNDERSTANDING THIS TORNADO

951
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THE

952
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
GROUND THAT 30 SQUARE MILES

953
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
HAVE BEEN HIT BY IT IT IF

954
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
TRUE, WE ARE IN

955
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
RECORD-BREAKING TERRITORY.

956
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000

957
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
THE CHOPPER CONTINUE TO

958
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
COME IN.

959
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF

960
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
THE SCREEN THAT'S THE
TORNADO AS IT WAS

961
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
DEVELOPING.

962
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
IT WAS JUST BEFORE 4:00

963
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
THIS AFTERNOON EASTERN

964
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
TIME.
SO 3:00 THERE.

965
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
WE HAVE LOTS OF MONITORS

966
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE

967
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
COUNTRY AND WE WERE

968
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
WATCHING AS THIS TORNADO

969
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
JUST A LITTLE SLIVER OF A

970
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
THING CAME DOWN OUT OF A

971
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
CLOUD AND IF YOU ARE A

972
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
FLORIDIAN AND YOU LIVE IN

973
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
THE SOUTH.

974
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
IT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU

975
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
MIGHT SEE COME DOWN OVER

976
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
THE GULF OF MEXICO AND JUST

977
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
SORT OF SLIP INTO THE WATER

978
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
AND AGAIN GO BACK INTO THE

979
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
SKY.

980
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
IT WAS JUST A TINY SKY.

981
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
CLOUD CEILING LOWERED AND

982
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
LOWERED.
THE CLOUDS WERE GETTING

983
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
CLOSER TO THE GROUND.
THE SIZE OF THE TORNADO AT

984
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
THE GROUND KEPT GETTING

985
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
WIDER AND WIDER.

986
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
GOING APPEAR WHAT APPEARED

987
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
TO BE WIDE OPEN SPACES.

988
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
THEN SUDDENLY YOU COULD

989
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
TELL THERE IS A FARM THERE

990
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS ORB

991
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
FARM.

992
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
AT THIS POINT IT'S BETWEEN

993
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
1 AND 2 MILES WIDE.

994
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
106-ACRE FARM THERE WHERE

995
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
75 TO 100 HORSES WERE

996
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
EITHER TAKEN AWAY BY THIS

997
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
STORM OR KILLED BY THIS

998
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
STORM.

999
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
FROM MOORE OKLAHOMA.
THAT THIS TORNADO WAS ON A

1000
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
PATH SO EERILY SIMILAR TO

1001
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
ONE FROM 1999.

1002
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
AND SURE ENOUGH, THROUGH

1003
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
THAT TOWN IT WENT, A MILE

1004
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
WIDE AT THE BOTTOM, TO TWO

1005
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
MILES AT SOME POINTS.

1006
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
WITH WINDS UP TO 200 MILES

1007
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
PER HOUR.

1008
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
LIKE CLEAR CUTTING A

1009
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE CLEAR
CUTTING TREES WHERE HOUSES

1010
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
COULD REPLACE THEM.

1011
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
YET TODAY THE HOUSES WERE

1012
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
ALREADY THERE AND MEN,

1013
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE IN

1014
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
BASEMENTS LISTENING TO THE

1015
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000

1017
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE IN

1018
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
BATHROOMS.

1019
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
DOZENS OF KIDS IN A HALLWAY

1020
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

1021
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
THEIR SAFE PLACE WHEN THE

1022
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
ROOF CAME OFF THAT SCHOOL

1023
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
AND THE WALLS BEGAN TO

1024
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
SWAY.
AND THE WINDS WERE HOWLING

1025
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN AS YOU

1026
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
HAVE HEARD IT SO MANY

1027
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000

FROM MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

1041
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA CITY
WHERE TWO ELEMENTARY

1042
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY

1043
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
A VERY POWERFUL TORNADO

1044
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
WHICH HAS CUT A SWATH OF

1045
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
DESTRUCTION LIKE RARELY

HAVE WE SEEN IN THIS

1047
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
NATION'S HISTORY, FRANKLY.

1048
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
WE NOW KNOW THAT ALL OF THE

1049
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000

SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE.

1069

IMAGINE COMING OUT OF YOUR

HOME AND REALIZING THAT

1071
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000

DESTROYED AND THAT THE

SCHOOL ACROSS THE STREET IS

1074
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
IN THE KIND OF CHAOS THAT

1075
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
YOU NEVER EVEN IMAGINED

1076
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
THAT WAS THE CASE FOR A MAN

1077
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
WHICH I SPOKE LIVE JUST TWO

1078
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
HOURS AGO.
>> THERE IS A RED CAR UP ON

1079

ARE TRYING TO LOCATE.

1086
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000

EVERYTHING IN MY SIGHT IS

1090
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
COMPLETELY GONE.

BELIEF.

1121
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
BUT OUR HOPE WAS THAT THE

1122
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAD

1123
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000

1124
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
AND THAT THE LOSS OF LIFE

1125
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
WOULD BE MINIMIZED.

1126
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
WITH THAT AS A BACKGROUND,

1127
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000

THE AREA OF DEVASTATION

1201
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
HERE IS MUCH LARGER.

THE EXTENT OF THE

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
DEVASTATION IS MUCH WIDER.

1204
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN

1206
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000

SO IF YOU ARE IN THAT PART

1212
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
OF THE WORLD PROBABLY THE

1213
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS

1214
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
TO GET A PLAN TOGETHER FOR

1215
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
HOW TO BE SAFE.

1218

00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THIS STORM WAS MOVING VERY

1220
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
SLOWLY.

1221
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
UNBELIEVABLE 200

THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

1243

SCENE AFTER THIS.

1417
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Why are twice as many people  choosing
Verizon  over any other carrier?

1418
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Many choose us because we have  the
largest 4GLTE network.

1419
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Others, because of our  reputation
for reliability.

1420
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Or maybe it's because  we've received

1421

1424
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
In the end  there are countless reasons.

1425
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But one choi.

1426
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
If you're suffering from  constipation

1427
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Miralax or Metamucil may take  days

1428
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
to work.  or faster relief, try Dulcolax

1429
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
laxative tablets.  Dulcolax provides

1430
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
gentle relief  overnight unlike Miralax

1431
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
and Metamucil that can take up  to

1432
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
3 days.  For predictable relief try

1433
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Dulcolax.  You thought this beach

1434
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
