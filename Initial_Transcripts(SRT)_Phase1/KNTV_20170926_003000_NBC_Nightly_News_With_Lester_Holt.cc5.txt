[000:07:06;659] TONIGHT OUT OF

[000:07:08;628] THIRD REPUBLICAN
[000:07:09;495] SENATOR HAS NOW COME
[000:07:11;197] OUT AGAINST THE LATEST
[000:07:12;632] GOP BILL TO REPEAL AND
[000:07:13;399] REPLACE OBAMACARE.
[000:07:16;602] THAT'S ENOUGH NO VOTES
[000:07:17;370] TO DOOM THAT BILL.
[000:07:19;172] THIS COMES HOURS AFTER
[000:07:19;939] PROTESTS ERUPTED
[000:07:21;140] INSIDE THE CAPITOL,
[000:07:22;008] SOME DEMONSTRATORS IN

[000:07:48;167] TONIGHT THAT MILLIONS
[000:07:48;935] MORE WOULD LOSE
[000:07:49;602] COVERAGE.
[000:07:50;169] THIS BILL WILL HAVE A
[000:07:50;937] SUBSTANTIALLY NEGATIVE
[000:07:51;704] IMPACT ON THE NUMBER
[000:07:53;172] OF PEOPLE COVERED BY

[000:07:59;045] AND JOHN McCAIN ALSO
[000:07:59;812] VOTING NO, THERE'S NO
[000:08:00;580] PATH FORWARD.

[000:08:32;278] THE HEARING DELAYED.
[000:08:33;012] >> IF YOU WANT A
[000:08:33;713] HEARING, YOU BETTER
[000:08:34;447] SHUT UP.
[000:08:35;014] >> Reporter: GRAHAM
[000:08:35;748] WAITING TO TESTIFY,
[000:08:36;482] AND THE BILL'S OTHER
[000:08:37;850] AUTHOR DR. BILL
[000:08:38;518] CASSIDY.
[000:08:39;051] THE PUBLIC SPECTACLE
[000:08:39;819] PLAYING OUT ACROSS
[000:08:40;553] CAPITOL HILL.
[000:08:41;254] THE CBO ESTIMATED THAT
[000:08:42;121] MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
[000:08:43;523] WITH EXPENSIVE
[000:08:44;390] PRE-EXISTING
[000:08:45;224] CONDITIONS WOULD NOT
[000:08:46;659] HAVE COMPREHENSIVE
[000:08:47;527] COVERAGE UNDER THE
[000:08:48;261] PLAN BUT THAT IT'S
[000:08:49;495] HARD TO KNOW THE EXACT
[000:08:50;263] NUMBER BECAUSE IT
[000:08:50;963] COULD VARY WIDELY BY
[000:08:51;731] STATE.
[000:08:52;899] THAT'S WHAT WORRIES
[000:08:54;634] SHAELYNN WHO DROVE
[000:08:55;468] FROM PENNSYLVANIA WITH
[000:08:56;235] HER SISTER BRITTANY
[000:08:56;969] WHO HAS CEREBRAL
[000:08:57;670] PALSY.
[000:08:58;170] >> SHE WAS BORN WITH
[000:08:58;938] THIS DISABILITY.
[000:08:59;739] SHE IS WHAT'S
[000:09:00;606] CONSIDERED A
[000:09:01;240] PRE-EXISTING
[000:09:01;874] CONDITION.
[000:09:02;575] UNFORTUNATELY FOR HER,
[000:09:03;342] HER SERVICES WOULD GET
[000:09:04;110] CUT TREMENDOUSLY.
[000:09:05;177] >> Reporter: AFTER A
[000:09:07;980] FEW MINUTES INSIDE
[000:09:08;714] SHAELYNN WAS DRAGGED
[000:09:09;482] OUT AND ARRESTED.
[000:09:10;182] A FEW HOURS LATER THE
[000:09:10;950] GOP EFFORT HAD FAILED
[000:09:12;251] AGAIN.
[000:09:12;885] THIS IS ANOTHER
[000:09:14;253] EMBARRASSMENT FOR
[000:09:15;121] REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE
[000:09:16;255] BEEN TRYING TO REPEAL
[000:09:17;089] AND REPLACE OBAMACARE
[000:09:18;824] FOR SEVEN YEARS.
[000:09:19;492] THE QUESTION NOW
[000:09:20;793] WHETHER REPUBLICAN
[000:09:21;527] LEADERS WILL EVEN PUT
[000:09:22;295] THIS ON THE FLOOR FOR
[000:09:23;062] A VOTE, AND TONIGHT
[000:09:23;796] THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY.
[000:09:25;364] SAVANNAH?
[000:09:25;932] >> ALL RIGHT, KASIE
[000:09:26;666] HUNT, THANK YOU SO
[000:09:27;400] MUCH.

[000:09:29;435] SITUATION BETWEEN THE
[000:09:33;339] U.S. AND NORTH KOREA.
[000:09:35;041] IT HAS BEEN A WAR OF
[000:09:35;808] WORDS, BUT NOW THE
[000:09:36;542] FOREIGN MINISTER OF
[000:09:37;276] NORTH KOREA IS SAYING
[000:09:38;044] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:09:38;744] RECENT THREATS ARE, IN
[000:09:39;512] FACT, A DECLARATION OF
[000:09:40;279] WAR.
[000:09:40;746] ARE WE HEADED TOWARD A
[000:09:41;847] MILITARY
[000:09:42;715] CONFRONTATION?
[000:09:43;349] NBC'S RICHARD ENGEL

[000:09:44;850] TONIGHT.
[000:09:47;553] >> Reporter: ON THE
[000:09:48;421] SAME DAY NORTH KOREA
[000:09:49;255] SAID THE U.S. HAS
[000:09:50;690] DECLARED WAR, IT
[000:09:52;091] RELEASED A COMPUTER
[000:09:53;526] SIMULATION SHOWING HOW
[000:09:54;293] IT WOULD DESTROY
[000:09:55;227] AMERICAN AIRCRAFT AND
[000:09:58;364] SET A CARRIER ABLAZE.
[000:10:03;536] IT'S PROPAGANDA BUT
[000:10:06;305] EXPERTS SAY THERE IS
[000:10:07;073] NOW A REAL RISK OF AN
[000:10:07;840] EXCHANGE OF FIRE WITH
[000:10:08;608] NUCLEAR-ARMED NORTH
[000:10:09;342] KOREA OR WORSE.
[000:10:10;009] THE GROWING CONCERN
[000:10:10;843] COMES AFTER PRESIDENT
[000:10:11;611] TRUMP STEPPED UP HIS
[000:10:12;378] PERSONAL INSULTS
[000:10:13;713] AGAINST KIM JONG-UN
[000:10:14;547] LABELING HIM LITTLE

[000:10:25;658] NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN
[000:10:26;425] MINISTER REPLIED
[000:10:27;126] TODAY.
[000:10:28;494] "SINCE THE UNITED

[000:11:01;794] >> Reporter: HE SAYS
[000:11:02;561] NORTH KOREA COULD FIRE

[000:11:04;597] THE U.S. COULD FIRE

[000:11:09;502] POTENTIAL ESCALATION
[000:11:10;336] TO FULL-BLOWN WAR

[000:11:31;657] BECOME A CONFLICT.
[000:11:33;659] THE BIG WORRY AMONG
