1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,968
THEORY.                         
ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE TOOLS A    

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:17,583
PRESIDENT CAN USE AS THE MOST   
POWERFULMAN ON EARTH IS TO LAY  

3
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,618
DO ANYTHING.                    
YOU BETTER BE CONCERNED.        

4
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:23,655
THERE'S AN INTERESTING STORY    
THAT CAME OUT LASTEEK TH HIS    

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,926
TRADE REPRESENTATIVE WAS GOING  
TO SOUTH KOREA TO NEGOTIATE A   

6
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:32,831
NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE DEAL.    
THE PRESIDENT SAID TO HIM, WE'RE

7
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,901
GOING TO ONLY GIVE THIS 30 DAYS.
WHEN THE TRADE REPRESENTATIVE   

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,303
SAID, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL THEM 
30 DAYS.                        

9
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:45,878
HE SAID NO, NO.                 
I MIGHT DROP OUT AT ANY POINT   

10
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,046
AND PULL THE PLUG ON THIS AT ANY
MOMENT.                         

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,580
THE POINT BEING THAT SOUTH KOREA
SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL CONFIDENT  

12
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,083
IN THAT THEY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT  
THIS PRESIDENT WILL DO.         

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,421
MY GUESS IS THAT IS BASICALLY   
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING   

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,922
HERE.                           
>> Shepard: IF YOU'RE IN        

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,692
NEW ORLEANS OR IN GULFPORT AND  
YOU SAY THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE 

16
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,362
THE STORM THAT MEANS THERE'S A  
TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE     

17
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,098
HEADED AND HELL COMING.         
WHEN YOU SAY IT WITH YOUR       

18
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,301
MILITARY LEADERS BEHIND YOU,    
THIS MEETING OF THE LEADERS IS  

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,004
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM,      
YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT SOME SORT

20
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,540
OF CONFLICT IS BREWING.         
ARE YOU NOT?                    

21
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,275
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IT COULD 
MEAN.                           

22
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,478
HERE'S THE MILITARY LEADERS,    
CALM BEFORE THE STORM IS COMING.

23
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:23,082
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A CALMING,     
COMFORTING THING.               

24
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,651
>> IT ISN'T.                    
BUT I DON'T THINK HE WANTS IRAN 

25
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:30,989
OR NORTH KOREA OR THE LEADERS OF
THOSE REGIMES TO BE CALM AND    

26
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,659
COMFORTABLE.                    
IT'S LIKE WHEN HE SAID TO NORTH 

27
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:37,062
KOREA, YOU KNOW, IF THEY PUSH US
TOO FAR, WE'LL RAIN DOWN FIRE   

28
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:41,233
AND FURY ON THEM.               
HE'S NOT SAYING I'M ABOUT TO DO 

29
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,901
IT.                             
HE'S NOT SAYING NEXT TUESDAY AT 

30
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,370
3:00 P.M., WE'RE GOING TO TAKE  
THIS PARTICULAR TACTIC.         

31
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,873
HE'S SAYING I HAVE THAT         
CAPABILITY AND PREPARED TO USE  

32
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,608
IT IF NECESSARY.                
>> Shepard: THERE'S A NEW POLL  

33
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,145
OUT FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS.      
24% OF AMERICANS SAY THE UNITED 

34
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,115
STATES IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT  
DIRECTION.                      

35
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:59,852
67% DISAPPROVE OF THE           
PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE.        

36
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:03,155
NORMALLY WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS  
HAPPEN, HE WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME

37
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:07,493
ACTION TO CHANGE THE POLLS.     
I WONDER HOW CONCERNED THEY ARE 

38
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,895
IF AT ALL?                      
>> LOOK, HE'S BEEN LOW IN THE   

39
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,797
POLLS FOR QUITE A PERIOD OF TIME
NOW.                            

40
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,201
HE BASICALLY HAS SUPPORT OF 34  
TO 40, OCCASIONALLY PICKS UP    

41
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,271
INTO THE 40%.                   
HE'S UNDER WATER IN ALMOST ALL  

42
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:23,308
OF THE POLLS.                   
HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION

43
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:29,114
FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS.      
I THINK HE FEELS IN REASONABLY  

44
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,284
STRONG SHAPE.                   
HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE A FELLOW    

45
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,721
THAT KNOW WHAT'S HE WANTS TO DO 
HE'S GOTTEN HIGH MARKS ON SOME  

46
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,923
THINGS.                         
VERY HIGH MARKS ON THE REACTION 

47
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,459
TO IRMA AND HARVEY AND TEXAS AND
FLORIDA.                        

48
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,896
NOT NEARLY AS HIGH MARKS ON HIS 
REACTION TO MARIA IN PUERTO     

49
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,297
RICO.                           
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL    

50
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,199
BUMP ALONG.                     
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.           

51
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,102
THERE'S TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE   
VERY SUPPORTIVE AND THINK HE    

52
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:55,841
DOES THE RIGHT THINGS AND TIMES 
WHEN HE UPSETS PEOPLE.          

53
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,077
>> Shepard: AND ALSO IN THE     
NEWS, THIS CONTRACEPTION CHANGE.

54
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,780
HOW IS THAT FLYING THERE        
POLITICALLY AND OTHERWISE?      

55
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,283
>> LOOK, IT'S THE USUAL         
SUSPECTS.                       

56
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:08,086
IF YOU'RE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF 
BIRTH CONTROL, YOU'RE OUTRAGED  

57
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,224
BY THIS.                        
THE PRESIDENT IS DRAMATICALLY   

58
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,195
INCREASING THE EXCEPTIONS.      
LET'S GO BACK.                  

59
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,132
OBAMACARE AS PART OF OFFERING   
EMPLOYERS, OFFERING HEALTHCARE  

60
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:24,803
SERVICES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES,    
THEY HAVE TO OFFER AS A FREE    

61
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:31,376
BENEFIT BIRTH CONTROL.          
NOW WE HAVE THE FIGHT IN THE    

62
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,847
SUPREME COURT WHEN OBAMA WAS    
PRESIDENT.                      

63
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:40,118
THE HOBBY LOBBY, GROUPS THAT    
WERE EXEMPTED.                  

64
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,089
NOW THE PRESIDENT WITH HIS HHS  
REGULATION IS DRAMATICALLY      

65
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,959
INCREASING THE EXCEPTIONS AND IS
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR     

66
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:51,597
GROUPS, NONPROFITS, TO PROPER IF
ITS, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS,   

67
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:57,269
NONRELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IF   
THEY HAVE A RELIGIOUS OR A MORAL

68
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:01,073
OBJECTION, THEY CAN SAY THAT    
THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO       

69
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,774
PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL TO THEIR  
EMPLOYEES.                      

70
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,677
THE ACLU IS ALREADY FILING A    
SUIT ON THIS.                   

71
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,548
THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY END UP IN 
THE COURTS.                     

72
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,285
>> Shepard: IT IS A BIT         
CONFUSING AS BIRTH CONTROL      

73
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,722
PREVENTS ABORTIONS FROM EVER    
HAPPENING.                      

74
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:22,628
IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE BIRTH 
CONTROL, FAMILY PLANNING COMES  

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,265
ALONG MORE EASILY AND WITHOUT   
THE CONTROVERSY THAT COMES ALONG

76
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,569
WITH ABORTIONS.                 
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE WORKING     

77
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:36,908
AGAINST ITSELF IN A WAY.        
>> WELL, YES, BUT THAT'S THE    

78
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,611
TENANT OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.  
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING  

79
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:44,349
TO INTERFERE WITH LIFE.         
ABORTION INTERFERES WITH LIFE.  

80
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:48,754
THEY THINK THAT BIRTH CONTROL,  
ARTIFICIAL BIRTH CONTROL        

81
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,223
INTERFERES WITH LIFE.           
THERE ARE PLENTY OF RELIGIONS   

82
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:57,863
THAT HOLD TO THOSE TENANTS EVEN 
THOUGH YOUR POINT ABOUT THE LACK

83
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,799
OF BIRTH CONTROL POSSIBLY       
LEADING TO UNWANTED PREGNANCIES 

84
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,503
IS ALSO TRUE.                   
>> Shepard: ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.   

85
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,939
WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND?  
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU PUT ME       

86
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,276
THROUGH MY PACES TODAY.         
LAS VEGAS IS A BIG STORY STILL. 

87
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,880
A TERRIBLE STORY.               
WE'RE STILL LEFT A WEEK LATER   

88
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,716
WITH THE QUESTION WHY AND WHEN  
WILL PEOPLE BE TALKING TO YOU?  

89
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,485
STEVE WYNN, ONE OF THE KINGS OF 
LAS VEGAS.                      

90
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,757
THE HEAD OF TWO OF THE BIGGEST  
HOTELS AND CASINOS IN THAT TOWN.

91
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,026
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WYNN      
DECIDE ADD YEAR AGO THAT        

92
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,229
LAS VEGAS WAS A SOFT TARGET.    
WHEN YOU HEAR THE KINDS OF      

93
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,832
THINGS -- WE'LL HAVE AN         
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SUNDAY --   

94
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:39,004
THAT HE DID TO TRY TO HARDEN THE
WYNN HOTEL AND TO HARDEN THE    

95
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,808
ENCORE HOTEL IN TERMS OF        
BRINGING IN FORMER SEAL TEAMS   

96
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:48,280
SIX MEMBERS, FORMER CIA         
OFFICERS, HIDDEN DETECTORS,     

97
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:52,951
HIDDEN PROFILERS IN THE CASINOS.
JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIS      

98
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,053
PROPERTIES.                     
BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW THREAT,   

99
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,723
WHICH WE SAW FROM STEPHEN       
PADDOCK, WHICH IS KNOCKING OUT  

100
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,425
THE WINDOWS AND FIRING DOWN FROM
THE 32nd FLOOR.                 

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,029
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL TALK TO 
STEVE WYNN ABOUT, HOW DO YOU    

102
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,933
HANDLE AND PREVENT THAT WE'LL BE
TALKING TO ERIC PRATT, THE      

103
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,470
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS
OF AMERICA.                     

104
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:16,074
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHILE THE  
NRA IS SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD   

105
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,778
REGULATE AND RESTRICT THE BUMP  
STOCKS, ERIC PRATT SAYS NO.     

106
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,948
WE'LL TALK TO HIM.              
>> Shepard: WE'LL WATCH THIS    

107
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,584
SUNDAY, CHRIS, ON "FOX NEWS     
SUNDAY."                        

108
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,820
LET'S GO TO MICHAEL CROWLEY FROM
POLITCO.                        

109
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,357
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING  
AWAY FROM THE CALM BEFORE THE   

110
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,994
STORM THING, MICHAEL.           
HE SAID IT.                     

111
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,529
NOBODY ASKED HIM ANYTHING ABOUT 
IT.                             

112
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,866
IT JUST CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.  
IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO, HE HAS

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,537
A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHEN    
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS.        

114
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:50,509
ALMOST FEELS LIKE A TEASE DURING
A REALITY SHOW.                 

115
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,345
SERIOUSLY.                      
WELL, YOU'LL SEE.               

116
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,982
CALM BEFORE THE STORM!          
>> HE'S A REALITY SHOW STAR,    

117
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,384
SHEP.                           
HE BRINGS SOME OF THAT TO THE   

118
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,119
PRESIDENCY.                     
I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY.       

119
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:06,591
I THINK THE GUY REALLY DOES HAVE
A SENSE OF DRAMA LIKE, THIS IT'S

120
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,728
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT HE'S SORT
OF WORKING THE AUDIENCE.        

121
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:14,299
IT'S POSSIBLE THIS.             
A THROW-AWAY COMMENT THAT TOOK  

122
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,636
ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN.           
INITIALLY.                      

123
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,972
NOW HE'S RUNNING WITH IT.       
HE'S ENJOYING IT.               

124
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,442
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING  
ABOUT.                          

125
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,979
THERE AREN'T OFFICIALS AROUND   
HIM LEAKING THERE'S SOME SECRET 

126
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,116
MEETING.                        
I WOULD SAY MY MAIN GUESS IS    

127
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,286
THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A MIND
GAME HE'S PLAYING WITH NORTH    

128
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,321
KOREA.                          
HE'S TRYING TO GET INSIDE THE   

129
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,290
HEAD OF KIM JONG-UN.            
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THIS 

130
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,893
IS PART OF IT, BUT IT WOULD BE  
CONSISTENT WITH THINGS LIKE     

131
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:46,364
TRUMP CALLING HIM NICKNAMES LIKE
ROCKET MAN AND LITTLE ROCKET    

132
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,266
MAN.                            
MAKING THE NORTH KOREANS THINK  

133
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,969
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP'S    
NEXT MOVE IS.                   

134
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,206
HE COULD BE A LITTLE CRAZY.     
THE GUY WAVING THE GUN AROUND.  

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,009
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?            
THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE THE     

136
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,313
CHANCE?                         
IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH     

137
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,682
THAT.                           
>> Shepard: YOU SAID I HOPE THE 

138
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,451
CIA IS RIGHT IN HIS ASSESSMENT  
OF KIM JONG-UN.                 

139
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,420
>> RIGHT.                       
THE CIA BELIEVES THAT KIM       

140
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,122
JONG-UN IS FUNDAMENTALLY        
RATIONALE.                      

141
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,059
THE KEY WAY TO TRANSLATE THAT   
IS, HE'S NOT SUICIDAL.          

142
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:18,196
HE'S NOT GOING TO GO DOWN -- HE 
DOESN'T WANT TO GO DOWN IN      

143
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,764
FLAMES.                         
HE LIKES HIS LIFE.              

144
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,300
NORTH KOREA IS A MISERABLE PLAY 
OVERALL.                        

145
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,437
HE LIVES COMFORTABLY.           
THERE'S LIQUOR AND WOMEN AND    

146
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:30,509
NICE TECHNOLOGY IF HE WANTS IT. 
SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS IF WE'RE    

147
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:35,780
WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT DO        
SOMETHING TOTALLY IRRATIONAL AND

148
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,416
UNEXPECTED.                     
WHAT IS AMAZING AT THIS POINT,  

149
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:41,086
IT'S THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT     
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DECIDE, IS 

150
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,090
HE ACTING TOTALLY RATIONALLY.   
MAYBE THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO   

151
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,560
PRESENT HIMSELF -- THERE'S A    
THEORY, THE MAD MAN THEORY.     

152
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,262
>> Shepard: EVERYBODY IS TALKING
ABOUT THAT TODAY.               

153
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,098
CHRIS WALLACE MENTIONED IT.     
I READ IT ON MY FEED.           

154
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,935
WHAT PROMPTED THIS?             
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?       

155
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,339
>> I THINK IT'S THE WAY TRUMP   
APPROACHES THESE ISSUES, THIS   

156
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:08,013
GOES BACK TO THE NIXON          
ADMINISTRATION WHERE HE TRIED TO

157
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,581
CULTIVATE AN IMAGE THAT HE WAS  
CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING, GOING

158
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,485
NUCLEAR, FOR INSTANCE AGAINST   
THE CHINESE AND TRYING TO SCARE 

159
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,588
YOUR OPPONENT BY MAKING THEM    
THINK YOU'RE NOT A RATIONALE    

160
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,025
ACTOR.                          
WHAT IS AMAZING, WE SPENT THIS  

161
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,428
TIME TRYING TO DECIDE IF THE    
NORTH KOREANS ARE NATIONAL.     

162
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,864
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SEE IF    
DONALD TRUMP IS RATIONALE.      

163
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:30,302
DOES HE PLAY BY THE OTHER RULES 
THAT AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE?  

164
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,470
THEY FELT LIKE AMERICAN         
PRESIDENTS WOULD STAY WITHIN    

165
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,507
CERTAIN BOUNDARIES AND NOT      
INITIATE MILITARY ACTION.       

166
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,810
OR IS HE REALLY GOING TO GO FOR 
IT IN A WAY WE'VE NEVER SEN     

167
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,679
BEFORE?                         
THEY DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.      

168
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,582
TRUMP LIKES THAT.

THE NEWS OF LAS VEGAS IS NEXT.  

182
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,430
Prudential asked these couples: 

183
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:35,266
     how much money do you      
think you'll need in retirement?

184
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,336
Then we found out how many years
  that money would last them.   

185
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:39,471
        How long do you         
      think we'll keep --       

186
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,472
    Oooooohhh! You stopped!     

187
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,008
     You're gonna leave me      
      back here at year 9?      

188
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,476
      How did this happen?      

189
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,527
      It turned out, a lot      
     of people fell short,      

190
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,513
      of even the average       
     length of retirement.      

191
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,750
     We have to think about     
 not when we expect to live to, 

192
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,184
   but when we could live to.   

193
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,355
Let's plan for income that lasts
  all our years in retirement.

 When you have type 2 diabetes, 
      you manage your A1C,      

196
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:05,964
but you also have a higher risk 
   of heart attack or stroke.   

197
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,267
      Non-insulin Victoza®      
          lowers A1C,           

198
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,037
        and now reduces         
      cardiovascular risk.      

199
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,973
Victoza® lowers my              
A1C and blood sugar             

200
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,708

    Victoza® is NOW approved    

203

     cardiovascular events      

204
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,918
such as heart attack,

205
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,154

206
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,456

        type 1 diabetes

   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

209
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,897
Do not take Victoza® if you have
  a personal or family history

213
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,671
   or any of its ingredients.   

214
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,174
  Stop taking Victoza® and get  
    medical help right away     

215
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,644
if you get symptoms of a serious
allergic reaction such as rash, 

216
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,946
 swelling, difficulty breathing 
         or swallowing.         

217
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,615
Serious side effects may happen,
    including pancreatitis.     

218
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,185
    So, stop taking Victoza®    
and call your doctor right away 

219
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,620
    if you have severe pain     
     in your stomach area.      

220
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,622
        Tell your doctor        
     your medical history.      

221
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,624
   Gallbladder problems have    
    happened in some people.    

222
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,960
  Tell your doctor right away   
      if you get symptoms.      

223
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,229
      Taking Victoza® with      
   a sulfonylurea or insulin    

224
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,964
   may cause low blood sugar.   

225
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,600
Common side effects are nausea, 
      diarrhea, vomiting,       

226
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,303
      decreased appetite,       
 indigestion, and constipation. 

227
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,205
          Side effects          
    can lead to dehydration,    

228
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,706
which may cause kidney problems.

229
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,075
Ask your doctor                 
about Victoza®.

00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,336

234
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,883
ROOM THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE    
GUNMAN'S CELL PHONE.            

235
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:16,821

236
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:22,060
ROOM WHILE HIS CAR WAS GONE.    
THERE COULD BE A FEW            

237
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,197
EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS.          
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW THE  

238
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,200
CORRECT ONE YET.                
THIS DEVELOPMENT AS             

239
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,903

>> SHEP, STILL NO CLEAR MOTIVE. 
THERE'S A NEWS CONFERENCE IN    

244
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,454
ABOUT 30 MINUTES.               
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE YESTERDAY. 

245
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:55,693
SO WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS, 
A PICTURE IS EMERGING OF STEPHEN

246
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:01,232
PADDOCK THAT PAYMENTS HIM AS A  
LOSER, ALONER THAT WOULD GO TO  

247
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,868
PROSTITUTES.                    
PROSTITUTES HAVE BEEN TALKING TO

248
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,771
HIM AND HE WAS CHEAP AND NEVER  
SHOWED EMOTION WHILE HE WAS WITH

249
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,374
THEM.                           
IT APPEARS THE MYSTERY WOMAN    

250
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:14,545
THAT HE WAS SEEN WITH GAMBLING  
HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING WAS A 

251
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,116
HOOKER.                         
HIS GIRLFRIEND SAID THAT HE     

252
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,354
GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT IN RECENT
WEEKS AND BECAME OBSESSED WITH  

253
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,558
MARILOU DANLEY'S EX-HUSBAND.    
BUT SHE TOLD POLICE SHE HAD NO  

254
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,261
IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING MASS  
MURDER.                         

255
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:35,667
THE CAR AT MANDALAY BAY HAD 50  
POUNDS OF TANNERITE AND         

256
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,637
AMMUNITION AND FERTILIZER.      
AND THERE'S NOW REPORTS THAT    

257
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:45,276
PADDOCK TRIED TO BUY TRACER     
AMMUNITION AT A PHOENIX GUN     

258
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,512
SHOW.                           
HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE  

259
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,982
THE GUN DEALER WAS SOLD OUT BUT 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS         

260
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,118
RECORDING THAT HE HAD 1,000     
TRACER ROUNDS BUT DIDN'T USE    

261
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,954
THEM.                           
TRACERS COULD HAVE MADE THIS    

262
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,190
SHOOTING MORE DEADLY, MORE      
ACCURATE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE  

263
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,226
BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE      
ROUNDS WERE GOING.              

264
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:09,434
THAT RAPID FIRE HAIL OF BULLETS 
LASTED TEN MINUTES.             

265
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:15,139
WE JUST INTERVIEWED AN OFF DUTY 
EMT THAT WAS AT THE CONCERT WITH

266
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,444
HIS WIFE.                       
HE USED HIS BELT AS A TOURNIQUET

267
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:23,381
ON A MAN'S LEG AND CARRIED      
SEVERAL TO A TENT INCLUDING A   

268
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,885

SAVED AT THE HOSPITAL.          

270
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:37,695
