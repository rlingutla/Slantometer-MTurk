[000:14:47;536] >> THAT BOAT WAS OUTSIDE OF
[000:14:49;838] OUR 20 BLOCK PERIMETER.
[000:14:51;240] WHAT WE HAD SET UP AND THOUGHT
[000:14:53;609] WE HAD HIM PINNED DOWN 1:30
[000:14:58;380] A.M. THAT MORNING, WE JUST
[000:15:00;382] MISSED IT AND DIDN'T GET THE
[000:15:02;685] PERIMETER AS WIDE AS WE NEEDED
[000:15:04;353] TO DO .
[000:15:05;421] SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THAT

[000:15:29;678] DID.
[000:15:30;279] HE DID NOT EVEN LEAVE HIS
[000:15:33;015] HOUSE AT ALL EVEN TO GO IN HIS
[000:15:36;051] BACK YARD UNTIL WE TOLD HIM IT
[000:15:38;220] WAS OKAY BY SIX CAN BE

[000:15:52;067] OFFICERS INVOLVED.
[000:15:52;801] >> LAST THING YOU NEEDED WAS
[000:15:55;371] SOMEBODY ELSE HURT.
[000:15:55;971] >> DID HE SAY ANYTHING OR
[000:15:58;040] COMMUNICATE IN ANY WAY?
[000:16:00;142] >> NO.
[000:16:01;243] WE TRIED TO TALK TO HIM AND WE
[000:16:03;712] WERE IN 15 OR 20 MINUTES OF
[000:16:06;048] HARD NEGOTIATION AND MAKING
[000:16:08;050] DEMANDS OF HIM AND HE DID NOT
[000:16:10;052] RESPOND.
[000:16:11;153] WE HAD PUT SOME FLASH BANGS IN
[000:16:14;423] TO THE BOAT TO GET HIM TO

[000:16:25;134] FREE AND SHOWING HIMSELF AND
[000:16:27;770] LIFTING HIS SHIRT.

[000:16:34;710] SHURT -- SHIRT.
[000:16:35;944] HE WAS NOT UNCUSHIOUS.
[000:16:37;513] >> RIGHT.

[000:16:39;615] WELL, BECAUSE OF THAT, I

[000:16:59;268] WE FOUND APE HOUSE WHERE THERE
[000:17:00;869] A POOL OF BLOOD OR A CIRCLE OF
[000:17:04;006] BLOOD.
[000:17:04;373] WE KNEW HE WAS LOSING BLOOD

[000:35:25;439] OF WHAT WENT WRONG TWO YEARS
[000:35:28;042] AGO.
[000:35:28;442] >> FIRST QUESTION, WHAT DO I
[000:35:30;111] KNOW ABOUT THE GROUP, VERY
[000:35:32;747] LITTLE.
[000:35:33;147] EVERYBODY WHO WORKED COUNTER
[000:35:34;916] TERRORISM IS FULLY AWARE OF
[000:35:36;517] THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON
[000:35:38;152] IN THE CAUCUS OF DAGIS STAN
[000:35:41;422] AND CHECHNYA AND THERE IS A
[000:35:43;024] LOT THERE.
[000:35:43;658] BUT MOST OF THEIR HISTORIC
[000:35:46;928] ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE
[000:35:49;197] RUSSIAN ENTITIES.
[000:35:52;500] THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT
[000:35:53;768] ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES.
[000:35:56;003] THAT IS TO ESTABLISH A LEVEL
[000:36:00;341] OF AUTONNY FOR CHECHNYA AND
[000:36:01;742] THEY ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL
[000:36:04;512] JIHADIST AND SEES UNITED
[000:36:05;780] STATES AS A PRIMARY ENEMY.
[000:36:09;483] I AM NOT SURED THAT THEY WOULD
[000:36:11;686] COME TO TARGET US.
[000:36:13;154] >> FROM WHAT YOU LEARN BODY
[000:36:15;423] HOW THESE TWO SEPARATED AND
[000:36:17;425] ACCOMPLISH, IS IT SENSE IT WAS
[000:36:19;894] A TRAINING THING OR WOULD THEY
[000:36:23;431] HAVE HAD HELP WITH THIS.
[000:36:24;866] >> THAT IS DIFFICULT TO
[000:36:28;002] ANSWER.
[000:36:29;070] IT WOULD SEEM THERE A NUMBER
[000:36:31;239] MUCH IED'S BUILT .
[000:36:33;040] IT WOULD SEEM GENERALLY THEY
[000:36:34;876] WORKED AND ACCORDINGLY I THINK
[000:36:36;844] THEY CERTAINLY HAD TRAINING TO
[000:36:38;479] DO THAT .
[000:36:39;847] FURTHER MORE WHEN I WATCHED
[000:36:42;149] THEM MARCH INTO THE SCENE
[000:36:44;185] WHERE THEY LAID DOWN THE
[000:36:45;887] IED'S.
[000:36:46;454] THEY WERE PREPARE ALMOST LIKE
[000:36:49;390] TWO SOLDIERS WALKING DOWN BOL
[000:36:52;026] STON STREET TO DO THAT.
[000:36:53;928] IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THEY HAD
[000:36:55;830] TRAINING ON HOW TO LAY OUT AN
[000:36:58;499] ATTACK PLAN AND FOLLOW THROUGH
[000:36:59;800] WITH IT.
[000:37:00;434] >> SINCE THE ATTACKS OF 9/11
[000:37:02;370] IN 2001, IT A CONCERN THAT
[000:37:05;006] THIS SORT OF THING WOULD
[000:37:07;475] HAPPEN, AND THAT JUST A COUPLE
[000:37:09;176] OF LONE WOLFLESS MIGHT
[000:37:11;779] ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING ON THE
[000:37:13;447] SUBWAY STATION OR SOMEWHERE
[000:37:14;548] ELSE.
[000:37:15;549] IS OUR CONCERN GREATER TODAY
[000:37:17;485] THAN IT A WEEK AGO?
[000:37:19;186] >> I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE
[000:37:22;523] COUNTER TERRORISM COMMUNITY IS
[000:37:24;659] AWARE .
[000:37:25;393] POTENTIAL OF IT HAPPENING.
[000:37:26;627] WHY IT IS NOT HAPPEN NEGLIGENT
[000:37:28;696] PAST WE DON'T KNOW.
[000:37:30;264] PART OF THAT AND I AM NOT JUST
[000:37:32;566] PATTING THE F.B.I. ON THE
[000:37:34;602] BACK.
[000:37:36;070] THERE IS SO MANY PLOTS IN THE

[000:39:04;191] I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER AND SO I
