THE NEXT DAY, HE PUBLICLY       

164

AT THE TIME, THE WHITE HOUSE    
INSISTED THE MEETING WAS ONLY   

172
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,431
ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS AND THE 
PRESIDENT PUBLICLY DEFENDED HIS

TO PROVIDE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN

WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN        
CRAFTING THAT FIRST MISLEADING

WE LEARNED SOMETHING ELSE TODAY 

181
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,156
THAT THE LEGAL BILLS FOR THE    
PRESIDENT AND HIS SON ARE BEING

PAID FOR WITH DONATIONS MADE BY 
EVERYDAY AMERICANS TO THE       

183
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,295
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.  
HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT?            

184
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,931

MY A1C WASN'T WERE              
IT NEEDED TO BE.

00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,526
SO I LIKED WHEN                 
MY DOCTOR TOLD ME               

395
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,696
THAT I MAY REACH MY BLOOD

  WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.   

398

   TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.    

399

  IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO

    RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.    

401
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,376
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,          
AND IT WORKS 24/7.              

402
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,278
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN  

403
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,797

A LITTLE WEIGHT.

   TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.    

408
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,677
  IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST    
  MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,

YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY          

416
