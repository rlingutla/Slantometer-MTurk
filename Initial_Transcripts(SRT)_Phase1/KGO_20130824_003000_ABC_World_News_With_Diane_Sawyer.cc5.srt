THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

778
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

779
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000

NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,

783
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS,

OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

786
