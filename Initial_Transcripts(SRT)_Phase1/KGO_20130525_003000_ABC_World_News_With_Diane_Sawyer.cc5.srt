COLLAPSE.

135
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
OFF.
>> LOUD BOOM AND THEN THERE WAS

186
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ORANGE COLORS FILLING THE CABIN.

187
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
SO THAT WAS QUITE SCARY.

188
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
>> Reporter: THE RIGHT ENGINE,
CONSUMED BY FLAME, NOW USELESS.

189
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
DID YOUR HEART SKIP A FEW BEATS?

190
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
>> YEAH.

191
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
IT'S -- IT'S -- YOU GET A BIT

192
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT IT AND

193
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
WONDER IF THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.

194
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
>> Reporter: THE PILOT FLEW LOW,
BACK TOWARD THE AIRPORT.

195
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
WHEN HE LANDED SAFELY --

196
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
[ APPLAUSE ]

197
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
BUT THEN JON HAD TO EVACUATE.

198
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
HE SLID OUT AN EMERGENCY EXIT,

199
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
HIS HANDS TREMBLING SO MUCH, HE

200
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
COULD BARELY HOLD HIS CAMERA
STEADY.

201
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
>> THERE WERE PEOPLE THROWING UP

202
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
AS WE GOT OFF THE PLANE, ON THE

203
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
GRASS AND THEY WERE CRYING AND

204
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
HYSTERICS.

205
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
>> Reporter: HE CAN'T FORGET THE
MOMENT WHEN HE TRIED TO CALL HIS

206
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
WIFE.

207
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> I WAS THINKING BACK TO THE
PHONE CALLS FROM 9/11, ACTUALLY,

208
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
AND HOW MOVING SOME OF THOSE

209
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
MESSAGES WERE.

210
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
AND I WONDERED IF I WOULD BE THE
ONE LEAVING A MESSAGE.

211
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
>> Reporter: JON TOLD ME HE'LL

212
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
TOAST THE PILOT, BECAUSE IT

213
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE.

214
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
NICK SCHIFRIN, ABC NEWS, AT

ASSAULT ARE NOT ONLY COMMITTING

294
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A CRIME, THEY THREATEN THE TRUST

295
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
AND DISCIPLINE THAT MAKES OUR

296
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
MILITARY STRONG.

297
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO BE
DETERMINED TO STOP THESE CRIMES.

320
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
LOOK AT THIS TONIGHT.
FLOODING ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.

DANGEROUS PART.

336
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO GET TO HOW

opportunity here. I can use

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Walmart's education benefits to
get a degree, Maybe work in IT,

586
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Or be an engineer, helping
Walmart conserve energy. Even

587
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
today, when our store does well,
I earn quarterly bonuses. When

ARE COMMON.

606

TO, AFTER THIS WEEK.

681
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.

682
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.

683
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,

684
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
STAYING ACTIVE
CAN BE DIFFICULT.

685
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN

686
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
SO YOUR BODY
CAN STAY IN MOTION.

687
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
BECAUSE JUST ONE
200MG CELEBREX A DAY

688
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF

689
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
AND INFLAMMATION.

690
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,

691
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION

692
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
SO MOVING IS EASIER.

693
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN
WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD.

694
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.

695
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS

696
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
WITH THE RISKS.

697
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000

LIKE CELEBREX, IBUPROFEN,

699
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
HAVE THE SAME
CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.

700
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
THE CHANCE

701
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

702
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
THIS CHANCE INCREASES
IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE

703
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
OR RISK FACTORS
SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

704
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
FOR LONG PERIODS.

705

NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,

706
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS

707
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
PROBLEMS,

708

SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,

709
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.

PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
AND THE ELDERLY

711
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000

BOTH SURVIVED.

782
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
AND WE SAW THE

783
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
MOMENT LITTLE SAM FOUND HIS

784
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
MOTHER, LOOKING UP AT HER,

785
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
CONCRETE GRIT IN HIS HAIR.
WHEN SHE TOOK US BACK THIS WEEK,

786
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
SHE SHOWED US WHERE HE WAS, IN

787
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
THE BACK CORNER OF THAT ROOM.

788
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
AND I KNOW THAT MY SON AND

797
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
DAUGHTER WERE BOTH IN THE HANDS

798
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
OF PEOPLE WHO LOVED THEM.

799
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
>> Reporter: AND THIS IS

800
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
MRS. BITTLE.

801
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000

806
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
BLESSING.

807
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
AND -- AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

808
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
>> Reporter: WE WERE GIVEN A

809
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
TOUR OF THAT OTHER SCHOOL, TOO,

810
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY, WHERE

811
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
THEY LOST SEVEN LITTLE FACES IN

812
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
ONE HALLWAY.

813
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WHAT'S STILL A MYSTERY, A
MIRACLE, IS HOW SO MANY OTHERS

814
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
GOT OUT.

815
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
MOST EVERYTHING THERE IS GONE.

816
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
BUT WE NOTICED

817
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000

819
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THE SCHOOLWORK RIGHT THERE ON
THE DESK WHERE IT WAS LEFT.

820
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
AND JUST BEFORE THAT TORNADO

821
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
HIT, THEY WERE WRITING WHAT THEY

822
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
LIKED MOST ABOUT THEIR TEACHER.

823
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I WILL REMEMBER SHE GAVE ME

824
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
CUPCAKES.

825
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
THEY WERE REMEMBERING, BECAUSE

826
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS

827
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
LEFT OF SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR.

828
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN THE

829
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
TORNADO HIT, SHE HAD HER

830
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
CHILDREN SINGING IN THE HALLWAY,

831
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
TRYING TO DISTRACT THEM.

832
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
AND IN THE CLASSROOM NEXT DOOR,

833
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
WE WERE SURPRISED TO MEET MISS

834
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
DOMINICK, ALREADY BACK PICKING

835
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
UP THE PIECES.
SHE TAUGHT THE AUTISTIC

836
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
CHILDREN.

837
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
SHE SAID MANY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

838
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

839
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
BUT SHE HAD THE PRESENCE OF

840
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
MIND TO PULL OUT HER iPAD TO

841
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
HAVE THEM TEXT MESSAGE THEIR

842
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
PARENTS.

843
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WOULDN'T

844
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
GO THROUGH.

845
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
BUT SHE KNEW IT WOULD CALM THEM.

846
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
WHAT DID THEY WANT TO SAY?

847
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
>> THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY MOM,

848
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
COME GET ME, OR, YOU KNOW, I
WANT TO GO HOME.

849
