[000:02:24;260] FACT THAT HE WENT BACK TO
[000:02:25;728] COLLEGE THE NEXT DAY.
[000:02:26;596] THAT THEY WENT ON WITH LIFE.
[000:02:28;531] AND THAT ALMOST MAKES YOU THINK
[000:02:30;266] THAT THEY WERE PLANNING
[000:02:31;935] SOMETHING ELSE, THIS THEY WERE
[000:02:33;303] JUST GOING TO GO BACK TO THEIR
[000:02:34;637] REGULAR LIFE.
[000:02:35;205] THEY WEREN'T GOING TO RUN.
[000:02:36;139] THEY WEREN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY.
[000:02:38;007] THEY WOULD PERHAPS TRY THIS KIND
[000:02:39;309] OF THING AGAIN.
[000:02:40;009] WE GO BACK HERE TO THE SNIPER IN
[000:02:43;413] 2002, AND HOW TERRIFYING THAT
[000:02:44;681] WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
[000:02:46;482] WHEN THAT SNIPER WAS PICKING OFF
[000:02:48;952] PEOPLE AND PART OF THAT TERROR
[000:02:50;486] IS, YOUR LIFE JUST KIND OF WENT
[000:02:51;888] ON EVERY DAY, YOU DIDN'T KNOW
[000:02:54;123] WHAT THESE PEOPLE WERE DOING,
[000:02:54;858] YOU HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS AFTER
[000:02:57;894] YOU AND IT'S -- THAT'S REALLY
[000:02:59;729] THE EVERY THE ANYTHING OF
[000:03:00;830] TERROR.
[000:03:01;297] IF YOU REALLY HAVE NO IDEA AND
[000:03:03;166] NOBODY MADE ANY CLAIMS IN
[000:03:04;868] MONDAY'S BOMBING, SO, THAT
[000:03:06;736] TERROR REALLY, REALLY -- THE
[000:03:08;972] NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU'RE TALKING
[000:03:12;075] ABOUT, IMAGINE WHAT THAT
[000:03:12;809] NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN THROUGH
[000:03:14;077] TODAY.
[000:03:14;544] IMAGINE WHAT THIS CITY HAS BEEN
[000:03:15;945] THROUGH IN THIS WEEK.
[000:03:18;181] ONE WEEK AGO, THOSE TERRIBLE,
[000:03:20;717] TERRIBLE BOMBINGS.
[000:03:21;551] I WAS TALKING TO A YOUNG WOMAN
[000:03:23;119] EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHO HAD A
[000:03:24;854] FRIEND WHO WAS BADLY INJURED IN
[000:03:27;457] THAT BOMBING AND THIS MORNING,
[000:03:28;725] I'M CALLING HER AND TELLING HER,
[000:03:30;727] WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, THE SUSPECT
[000:03:31;961] WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL,
[000:03:33;329] APPARENTLY RIGHT NEAR YOU.
[000:03:34;797] SO, ALL OF THESE EVENTS
[000:03:36;232] HAPPENING SO FAST AND SO HEART
[000:03:38;601] BREAKING.
[000:03:39;035] WE CAN ONLY HOPE WE GET
[000:03:40;970] RESOLUTION TONIGHT.
[000:03:41;571] >> ALL RIGHT, MARTHA.
[000:03:42;205] AND FOR ANYONE WHO HAPPENED TO
[000:03:43;339] MISS THE MOMENT THAT WE GOT THAT
[000:03:44;841] PHONE CALL FROM GEORGE, WHO GAVE
[000:03:46;943] US, FIRST WORD, OF HOW THEY
[000:03:52;181] APPEARED TO HAVE FOUND THIS
[000:03:53;583] SUSPECT, I WANT TO REPLAY IT,
[000:03:56;319] BECAUSE HIS FRIEND, DAVE
[000:03:58;688] HANNEBURY, FROM TWO DOORS DOWN,
[000:04:01;291] WAS IN HIS HOUSE BEING
[000:04:03;960] INTERVIEWED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
[000:04:05;194] HE TOLD US ABOUT HOW HIS FRIENDS
[000:04:09;165] BOAT AND HERE WE ARE WITH THIS .
[000:04:12;368] HERE HE IS AGAIN.
[000:04:14;671] GEORGE PIZZUTO.
[000:04:16;706] >> BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS, AFTER
[000:04:18;041] THEY LIFTED THE BAN, MY
[000:04:25;048] NEIGHBORHOOD, DAVID
[000:04:26;316] NEIGHBOR, HE WENT OUTSIDE TO GET
[000:04:27;050] SOME FRESH AIR AND HE HAD HIS
[000:04:29;452] 24-FOOT BOAT ON A TRAILER WITH A
[000:04:32;021] WINTER COVER, A SHRINK WRAP
[000:04:34;624] COVER OVER IT.
[000:04:35;391] HE NOTICED SOMETHING WAS OFF.
[000:04:36;726] SO, HE GOT A LADDER AND PUT IT
[000:04:38;928] UP AGAINST THE SIDE AND HE HAS A
[000:04:40;296] ZIP COVER.
[000:04:41;064] HE LIFTED UP THE ZIP COVER AND
[000:04:44;000] HE -- AND AS HE WENT UP TO THE
[000:04:45;802] LADDER, HE NOTICED BLOOD AND
[000:04:47;270] THEN HE THOUGHT HE SAW WHAT
[000:04:49;038] LOOKED LIKE A BODY LAYING IN THE
[000:04:51;607] BOAT.
[000:04:52;041] SO, HE GOT OUT OF THE BOAT FAST
[000:04:53;509] AND CALLED THE POLICE AND THAT'S
[000:04:54;277] WHEN -- THAT'S WHEN EVERYONE
[000:04:58;114] ASCENDED, DESCENDED, WHATEVER
[000:04:59;248] YOU WANT TO SAY, ON FRANKLIN
[000:05:02;719] STREET AND RUSHED THEM RIGHT
[000:05:04;887] OVER TO -- THEY'RE IN OUR HOUSE
[000:05:07;223] BEING INTERVIEWED.
[000:05:08;825] WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE
[000:05:10;626] IS, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SHOTS
[000:05:14;330] FIRED AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE
[000:05:16;199] SOME EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHETHER
[000:05:18;668] THEY THREW THEM IN THE BOAT OR
[000:05:19;869] THEY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE
[000:05:21;637] BOAT, I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY
[000:05:24;974] HAVEN'T POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED
[000:05:27;176] THE PERSON, I'M PRETTY SURE
[000:05:28;578] THAT'S WHO IT IS, BUT THEY DON'T
[000:05:29;946] WANT TO GO -- THEY HAVEN'T GONE
[000:05:31;547] IN YET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
[000:05:32;281] IF HE IS WIRED FOR EXPLOSIVES.
[000:05:37;253] >> YES, THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN
[000:05:38;187] ALL ONG.
[000:05:39;789] THIS IS A STAGGERINGRY
[000:05:41;157] YOU'RE TELLING US.
[000:05:41;824] >> SO, ANYW, WHAT'S GOING ON
[000:05:43;292] T NOW  THEY'RE -- THEY
[000:05:45;428] JUST SHUT THE POWER OFF TO THE
[000:05:46;863] HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT AIR
[000:05:51;501] ALL STILL HERE.
[000:05:52;068] EVERYONE IS STILL HERE.
[000:05:54;504] >> BUT TO GO BACK OVER IT ONCE
[000:05:56;906] MORE, SIR, SO, YOUR FRIEND, IT'S
[000:05:58;508] DAVE HANNEBURY, SYOU SAY?
[000:06:01;944] >> YEAH, HE'S THE ONE THAT OWNS
[000:06:03;880] THE HOUSE.
[000:06:04;547] AND, LIKE I SAY, HE JUST
[000:06:06;983] HAPPENED TO NOTICE, IT DIDN'T
[000:06:08;584] LOOK RIGHT AND HE LOOKED INSIDE
[000:06:10;453] AND THAT'S WHERE HE SAW THE
[000:06:12;488] BLOOD AND THE BODY AND THAT'S --
[000:06:14;123] THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE
[000:06:14;957] PERSON NOW.
[000:06:16;292] >> AND AGAIN --
[000:06:17;126] >> I DON'T KNOW, THEY DON'T KNOW
[000:06:18;628] HOW, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO OTHER
[000:06:19;862] INFORMATION.
[000:06:21;931] RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STILL HERE.
[000:06:23;099] >> HE WENT OUT IN HIS YARD AFTER
[000:06:27;303] HE WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO EXIT,
[000:06:28;905] SO, THIS WAS VERY RECENTLY THIS
[000:06:29;839] EVENING.
[000:06:31;074] >> YES, WE'VE BEEN IN ALL DAY
[000:06:31;941] AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU
[000:06:36;112] CAN -- WE'RE LIFTING THE BAN,
[000:06:37;747] BUT WE SUGGEST YOU DON'T GO TOO
[000:06:40;016] FAR AND HE JUST WENT OUT TO HIS
[000:06:42;018] YARD AND RIGHT IN HIS YARD,
[000:06:43;986] RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS BACK DOOR IS
[000:06:44;720] HIS BOAT AND LIKE I SAID, I TOLD
[000:06:47;223] YOU THE REST OF THE STORY.
[000:06:49;692] >> WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT
[000:06:51;194] YOUR FRIEND?
[000:06:51;761] >> THEY'RE JUST WAITING.
[000:06:53;229] >> YES.
[000:06:54;330] TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FRIEND DAVE.
[000:06:56;332] WE'RE ALL IMAGINING WHAT HE IS
[000:06:57;100] LIKE.
[000:06:58;601] >> WELL, RIGHT NOW HE'S -- HE'S
[000:07:02;672] PRETTY MUCH IN SHOCK.
[000:07:04;006] HE'S ONLY TALKING TO WHOEVER HE
[000:07:07;643] HAS.
[000:07:08;044] COMMISSIONER DAVIS HAS BEEN IN
[000:07:09;412] HERE.
[000:07:09;812] A LOT OF THE S.W.A.T. TEAM, THE
[000:07:11;948] BOSTON POLICE, THE WATERTOWN
[000:07:13;683] POLICE, THEY'VE ALL BEEN IN MY
[000:07:14;984] HOUSE HERE INTERVIEWING HIM AND
[000:07:18;187] HE'S JUST TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT.
[000:07:20;423] AND HIS WIFE, WHO IS SUFFERING
[000:07:22;959] SOME MAJOR MEDICAL PROBLEMS, IS,
[000:07:25;194] YOU KNOW, ALL HER --
[000:07:27;830] EVERYTHING -- THEY JUST RUSHED
[000:07:28;998] THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHE
[000:07:31;134] COULDN'T -- THEY COULDN'T TAKE
[000:07:31;901] ANYTHING WITH THEM.
[000:07:33;803] >> AND AS WE SAID EARLIER, THE
[000:07:38;808] VULNERABILITY OF THAT COUPLE IN
[000:07:40;543] THAT HOUSE, THE BOAT SO CLOSE,
[000:07:41;944] THE SUSPECT SO CLOSE.
[000:07:42;745] AND AGAIN, I'M TOLD IT WAS A
[000:07:44;814] 24-FOOT BOAT, BY THE WAY, IN THE
[000:07:47;183] BACK, BUT THERE IT WAS, THE
[000:07:50;953] VULNERABILITY, SO CLOSE TO THEIR
[000:07:51;954] HOUSE, TO CLOSE TO THEIR LIVES
[000:07:52;688] TONIGHT.
[000:07:53;623] I WANT TO BRING IN ROBIN DUMA,
[000:07:56;859] WHO IS ALSO AN EYEW, LIVES
[000:08:00;429] NEI HEARD POLICE TALKING IN
[000:08:02;832] THE BACKYARD, ROBIN?
[000:08:04;167] WHAT DID YOU HEAR?
[000:08:05;635] >> YES, AS MY NEIGHBOR SAID,
[000:08:08;638] WHEN THEY TOLD US WE COULD GO
[000:08:09;972] OUT, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE DID
[000:08:11;307] THAT, BUT WITHIN MINUTES, THE
[000:08:13;376] POLICE REALLY DESCENDED ON THE
[000:08:14;677] NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE HAD QUITE A
[000:08:15;912] FEW OF THEM IN OUR BACKYARD AND
[000:08:17;980] WE HEARD THEM SAYING THAT HE WAS
[000:08:20;917] POKING HOLES THROUGH THE
[000:08:22;485] PLASTIC, THAT SHRINK WRAP, ON
[000:08:23;519] THE BOAT.
[000:08:26;022] AND LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING
[000:08:27;490] TO, YOU KNOW, ASSESS WHAT WAS
[000:08:29;592] GOING ON, SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
[000:08:30;626] AROUND HIM.
[000:08:32;261] >> SO, LET ME UNDERSTAND.
[000:08:34;096] THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO POKE
[000:08:37;667] HOLES OR THE SUSPECT WAS INSIDE?
[000:08:39;602] >> THE SUSPECT.
[000:08:40;403] HE WAS IN THE BOAT, POKING HOMES
[000:08:42;638] TO TRY TO SEE OUT.
[000:08:44;073] >> THIS IS WHAT YOU HEARD POLICE
[000:08:44;840] SAY?
[000:08:45;241] >> YES.
[000:08:49;712] >> WHICH WOULD INDICATE AND WE
[000:08:52;515] HAD NOT HEARD THIS BEFORE, THAT
[000:08:53;783] HE MIGHT HAVE STILL BEEN ALIVE
[000:08:55;618] WHEN THEY CAME UP.
[000:08:56;886] AND WE KNOW THERE WAS THAT
[000:08:59;488] EXCHANGE OF GUN FIRE.
[000:09:02;491] ANYTHING ELSE YOU SAW OR HEARD
[000:09:03;426] ABOUT THAT MOMENT?
[000:09:03;993] >> NO, REALLY, IT WAS JUST
[000:09:06;095] OVERHEARING THEM.
[000:09:06;762] WE TRIED TO HEAR WHAT THE POLICE
[000:09:08;397] RADIOS ARE SAYING, BUT IT'S A
[000:09:10;566] LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT.
[000:09:11;367] THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GUN
[000:09:12;935] FIRE, WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENED
[000:09:14;670] BEFORE WE OVERHEARD THE POLICE
[000:09:16;239] OFFICERS TALKING.
[000:09:18;007] YOU KNOW, THE -- THERE WAS JUST
[000:09:20;076] A RUSH DOWN THE STREET OF ALL
[000:09:21;244] THE VEHICLES AND JUST NOW THEY
[000:09:23;879] ACTUALLY BROUGHT AN AMBULANCE
[000:09:24;714] DOWN THE STREET AND AN ENORMOUS
[000:09:26;082] BLACK SPECIAL UNIT TRUCK.
[000:09:30;152] BUT INITIALLY, THEY ALL CAME
[000:09:31;754] RUSHING DOWN THE STREET AND THEN
[000:09:33;422] THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GUN
[000:09:35;625] FIRE.
[000:09:36;058] THEN THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING.
[000:09:38;227] WE HEARD THE POLICE OFFICERS
[000:09:39;395] SPEAKING AND THEN A LITTLE
[000:09:40;796] WHILE -- WELL, QUITE AWHILE
[000:09:43;332] LATER, THERE WERE SEVERAL
[000:09:45;301] EXPLOSIONS AND THEN SOME MORE
[000:09:47;903] GUN FIRE.
[000:09:48;504] AND NOW, REALLY, FOR THE LAST
[000:09:49;939] LITTLE WHILE, NOT MUCH SEEMS TO
[000:09:51;874] BE GOING ON.
[000:09:52;408] THE HELICOPTERS HAVE LEFT.
[000:09:54;644] BUT THESE LARGER, WELL, ONE
[000:09:56;078] AMBULANCE AND A LARGER BIG BLACK
[000:09:58;948] TRUCK JUST CAME DOWN THE STREET.
[000:10:01;417] >> WELL, AGAIN, SUCH VIVID
[000:10:03;686] DETAIL THAT YOU ARE ALL GIVING
[000:10:04;754] US FROM PHONING IN AND WE THANK
[000:10:06;689] YOU.
[000:10:07;123] BUT LET ME GO THROUGH THAT
[000:10:09;225] AGAIN.
[000:10:09;625] YOU SAID THERE WAS GUN FIRE,
[000:10:11;494] THEN SOMETHING SOUNDED EXPLOSIVE
[000:10:13;062] AND THEN GUN FIRE AGAIN?
[000:10:14;230] >> INITIALLY THERE WAS A LOT OF
[000:10:15;831] GUN FIRE, SO, WE WERE TOLD, GO
[000:10:18;467] OUTSIDE, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE DID.
[000:10:20;469] I WOULD SAY ABOUT FOUR MINUTES
[000:10:23;639] LATER, THE POLICE CAME RUSHING
[000:10:24;740] DOWN THE STREET.
[000:10:25;708] THEN THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF
[000:10:27;243] GUN FIRE RIGHT WHEN THEY ALL
[000:10:30;112] ARRIVED.
[000:10:30;613] THEN, REALLY NOT MUCH OF
[000:10:31;781] ANYTHING FOR AWHILE.
[000:10:33;182] WE THEN OVERHEARD THE POLICE
[000:10:34;583] OFFICERS IN OUR BACKYARD TALKING
[000:10:36;252] ABOUT THIS POKING HOLES THROUGH
[000:10:37;787] THE PLASTIC.
[000:10:39;255] AND THEN I WOULD SAY A GOOD 45
[000:10:41;957] MINUTES, HOUR LATER, THERE WAS
[000:10:44;060] MORE GUN FIRE AND WHAT SOUNDED
[000:10:46;462] LIKE THREE SMALL EXPLOSIONS, I
[000:10:48;197] MEAN, WE'RE ABOUT FOUR HOUSES
[000:10:49;498] AWAY, THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED
[000:10:50;199] LIKE TO ME.
[000:10:52;368] AND NOW THERE'S REALLY -- I
[000:10:54;070] HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EXPLOSIONS OR
[000:10:55;338] GUN FIRE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
[000:10:57;673] FOR, I'D SAY ABOUT ANOTHER 45
[000:10:59;542] MINUTES, HOUR AT THIS INT.
[000:11:02;044] >> WELL, AGAIN, IT RAISES THE
[000:11:03;612] QUESTION, IF THERE WAS ANY
[000:11:05;047] EXPLOSIVE AROUND THAT POLICE
[000:11:06;282] WERE TRYING TO DETONATE.
[000:11:10;920] WE OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE THIS
[000:11:15;658] CLARIFIED AS TIME GOES ON.
[000:11:17;560] THERE WAS FEAR ENOUGH IN YOUR
[000:11:20;396] HOUSE.
[000:11:20;830] WHEN ALL OF THIS STARTS
[000:11:21;831] HAPPENING, HOW AFRAID WERE YOU?
[000:11:23;532] >> IT WAS -- IT ACTUALLY STARTED
[000:11:27;169] LAST NIGHT AT ABOUT 1:45 A.M.,
[000:11:29;772] THERE WERE -- IT'S A VERY QUIET
[000:11:32;975] NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE HELICOPTERS
[000:11:34;443] CAME OVER AND I THOUGHT, OKAY,
[000:11:36;245] FINE, THERE'S A HELICOPTER, BUT
[000:11:38;247] IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING MUCH
[000:11:39;348] MORE THAN THAT.
[000:11:40;649] WHEN I WENT TO THE WINDOW, I
[000:11:43;252] COULD SEE OFFICERS MOVING
[000:11:44;787] THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH
[000:11:47;156] FLASHLIGHTS.
[000:11:47;690] IT WAS VERY, VERY UNNERVING.
[000:11:49;925] AND I REALLY DIDN'T FALL ASLEEP
[000:11:51;894] AFTER THAT.
[000:11:52;628] WE'VE ALL ACTUALLY BEEN UP SINCE
[000:11:55;531] THAT TIME AND OVER THE COURSE OF
[000:11:56;966] THE DAY TODAY IT KIND OF WANED.
[000:11:59;368] THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT FELT
[000:12:00;669] MORE STRESSFUL AND OTHER TIMES
[000:12:02;037] WHEN PEOPLE SEEMED TO BACK OFF A
[000:12:02;772] BIT.
[000:12:06;275] THIS HAS HEIGHTENED THE STRESS
[000:12:07;543] AND, YOU KNOW, BUT IT IS -- IT
[000:12:09;145] IS -- IT'S KIND OF JUST A
[000:12:10;980] WEARING, STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE.
[000:12:12;882] THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A LOT OF
[000:12:16;585] BARNS, OLD OUTBUILDINGS,
[000:12:18;320] GARAGES, SHEDS AND SUCH AND I
[000:12:20;856] HAVE TO ADMIT, EVEN WHEN I HEARD
[000:12:22;892] THE POLICE SAYING THEY FELT
[000:12:25;995] CONFIDENT THEY'VE DONE A
[000:12:27;596] THOROUGH SEARCH, I HAD
[000:12:28;898] QUESTIONS, JUST BECAUSE I KNOW
[000:12:29;698] THE NATURE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
[000:12:32;301] AND ALL THESE OUT BUILDINGS AND
[000:12:33;803] WONDERED, REALLY, IF THEY HAD
[000:12:35;037] MANAGED TO GO INTO THE NOOKS AND
[000:12:37;740] CRANNIES.
[000:12:38;207] >> I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT
[000:12:39;074] OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS JUST
[000:12:41;844] LIKE THAT TOMORROW.
[000:12:43;512] AND ONE OF THOSE INDELIBLE
[000:12:45;714] DETAILS ABOUT THE HUMANITY
[000:12:48;017] INVOLVED IN WHAT HAS BEEN
[000:12:49;418] HAPPENING IS, YOU SAY THE
[000:12:51;353] NEIGHBORS HAD JUST BROUGHT HOME
[000:12:52;455] A FOUR-DAY OLD INFANT?
[000:12:54;323] >> YES, MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS
[000:12:55;991] HAVE A NEWBORN, HE CAME HOME ON
[000:13:00;796] ZSH I KIND OF LOST TRACK OF
[000:13:02;598] TIME, IT WAS EITHER WEDNESDAY OR
[000:13:04;233] THURSDAY.
[000:13:04;733] HE'S JUST NEW TO THE WORLD AND,
[000:13:07;203] SO, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO DOUBT --
[000:13:09;138] WE'VE BEEN TEXTING BACK AND
[000:13:10;506] FORTH, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM
[000:13:12;241] FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS, BUT YOU
[000:13:14;276] KNOW, I'M JUST IMAGINING IT'S A
[000:13:16;178] PRETTY STRESSFUL SITUATION TO
[000:13:17;279] HAVE A BABY AND TO HAVE ALL OF
[000:13:18;848] THIS GOING ON, YOU KNOW, JUST
[000:13:19;548] OUTSIDE.
[000:13:21;617] >> AND YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE
[000:13:25;621] HANNEBURYS?
[000:13:26;155] ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM TONIGHT?
[000:13:27;623] >> NO, I MEAN, I MEAN -- WE ALL
[000:13:29;758] KNOW -- I MEAN, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
[000:13:31;227] I DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW ALL MY
[000:13:33;362] NEIGHBORS LAST NAMES, WE ALL
[000:13:34;630] KNOW EACH OTHER BY FIRST NAME.
[000:13:36;232] IT'S A VERY CLOSE KNIT
[000:13:38;534] NEIGHBORHOOD.
[000:13:39;335] THERE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN
[000:13:41;103] HERE, AS THEY HAVE, FOR A VERY
[000:13:42;304] LONG TIME AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR
[000:13:43;606] ABOUT 11 YEARS, WE ALL KNOW EACH
[000:13:47;510] OTHER VERY WELL.
[000:13:49;044] AND --
[000:13:50;513] >> DAVE IS HIS FIRST NAME.
[000:13:51;380] >> YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW THE FAMILY
[000:13:52;982] AND I KNOW -- I MEAN, MY
[000:13:55;017] 14-YEAR-OLD SAID, OH, MY GOSH,
[000:13:56;285] YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT BOAT.
[000:13:57;753] AND, YOU KNOW, AND I HAD EVEN
[000:13:59;255] SAID EARLIER TODAY, NOT ABOUT
[000:14:00;456] THAT BOAT, BUT WE LIVE RIGHT
[000:14:03;325] NEAR THE CHARLES RIVER AND THERE
[000:14:04;059] IS A YACHT CLUB THAT HAS ALL THE
[000:14:06;128] BOATS SHRINK WRAPPED AND I SAID,
[000:14:09;398] THINKING OUT LOUD THIS MORNING,
[000:14:11;567] I SAID, DO YOU THINK THEY'VE
[000:14:13;335] GONE THROUGH ALL THOSE BOATS?
[000:14:14;670] THERE ARE 50 OR 60 OF THEM.
[000:14:16;171] IF I WAS RUNNING AWAY, I'D THINK
[000:14:17;973] TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND HIDE
[000:14:20;142] THERE.
[000:14:20;609] SO, IT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
[000:14:24;146] INTERESTING THAT THAT'S WHERE HE
[000:14:25;281] WAS, NOT AT THE YACHT CLUB, BUT
[000:14:26;148] JUST DOWN THE STREET.
[000:14:27;783] >> WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS
[000:14:29;785] THE FOG OF INFORMATION RIGHT NOW
[000:14:32;221] BUT YOU DID THINK THAT YOU
[000:14:34;456] OVERHEARD POLICE IN THE BACKYARD
[000:14:37;726] TALKING ABOUT THE SUSPECT,
[000:14:39;895] PERHAPS, TRYING TO LOOK OUT OF
[000:14:41;196] THIS COVERING THAT WAS ON THAT
[000:14:43;899] BOAT AND WE WILL TRY TO VERIFY
[000:14:46;335] THAT THROUGHOUT THIS EVENING.
[000:14:47;336] I ALSO READ A QUOTE FROM YOU,
[000:14:48;837] YOU SAID, I'VE NEVER FELT SAFER
[000:14:50;773] IN MY LIFE.
[000:14:52;975] EVERY OFFICER IN THE UNIVERSE.
[000:14:54;643] >> AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, MY
[000:14:56;812] PARENTS, YOU KNOW, FRIENDS,
[000:14:58;013] EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IS TEXTING
[000:14:59;281] AND CALLING, EVEN PEOPLE I
[000:15:00;516] HAVEN'T HEARD FROM IN YEARS, AND
[000:15:02;885] I DID SAY, KIDDINGLY, YOU KNOW,
[000:15:04;920] HOW COULD YOU NOT FEEL SAFE, OUR
[000:15:06;722] HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY SURROUNDED
[000:15:08;857] BY EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
[000:15:10;125] IN THE UNIVERSE, SO, I WAS -- IT
[000:15:12;227] WAS A LITTLE TONGUE IN CHEEK.
[000:15:14;196] I THINK I'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER
[000:15:15;864] ONCE WE KNOW, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
[000:15:16;699] OVER.
[000:15:21;337] >> ROBIN, STAY IN TOUCH WITH IT.
[000:15:24;073] CALL BACK IN.
[000:15:25;474] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[000:15:26;442] >> AND A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN
[000:15:28;077] ASKING ONLINE ABOUT SOMETHING
[000:15:29;878] ALL DAY, THE OLDER BROTHER, THE
[000:15:34;984] DECEASED BROTHER, HAD A WIFE OR
[000:15:36;218] AT LEAST A GIRLFRIEND, WE'RE NOT
[000:15:37;353] SURE IF THEY WERE MARRIED, BUT
[000:15:38;854] THEY HAVE A 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
[000:15:40;522] AS WELL.
[000:15:41;023] AND A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN
[000:15:43;092] ASKING, WHERE IS SHE?
[000:15:45;494] DO THEY HAVE HER IN CUSTODY
[000:15:46;395] TONIGHT?
[000:15:46;829] BRIAN ROSS, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME
[000:15:48;097] NOW, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
[000:15:49;865] THAT?
[000:15:50;332] IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE
[000:15:51;867] OLDER BROTHER'S WIFE IS IN
[000:15:53;736] CUSTODY NOW, DO WE KNOW
[000:15:54;403] ANYTHING?
[000:16:00;509] SOUNDS AS IF BRIAN IS DEBRIEFING
[000:16:02;144] SOMEBODY ON SCENE THERE, I'LL GO
[000:16:03;278] TO PIERRE THOMAS WITH THE SAME
[000:16:07;049] QUESTION?
[000:16:09;051] HE IS DOING THE SAME THING.
[000:16:11;120] YOU ARE GETTING AN EYEWITNESS ON
[000:16:13;722] REPORTING AT WORK, THE ABC NEWS
[000:16:17;593] FORCE.
[000:16:18;027] THIS IS WHAT WE DO, SEEKING OUT
[000:16:18;827] EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF
[000:16:19;728] INFORMATION.
[000:16:20;262] SO, WE'RE DOING IT WITH YOU, YOU
[000:16:21;764] ARE PART OF OUR NEWS ROOM, IN A
[000:16:24;500] SENSE HERE ONLINE.
[000:16:25;401] AND WE HAVE SOMEONE ELSE ON THE
[000:16:26;368] TELEPHONE?
[000:16:30;105] IRENE SANTORO.
[000:16:33;809] IRENE, HELLO, IT'S DIANE.
[000:16:34;643] TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.
[000:16:35;477] >> HELLO, DIANE.
[000:16:36;245] YES, WELL, WE'VE BEEN HERE ON
[000:16:39;748] FRANKLIN STREET, WELL, ALL DAY,
[000:16:41;250] AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING
[000:16:42;484] EVERYTHING ALL NIGHT, AS WELL.
[000:16:44;486] WITH HALL CONTINUERS AND LIGHTS,
[000:16:47;289] ET SET THAT HERE.
[000:16:48;424] BUT PRESENTLY, WE HAVE ABOUT,
[000:16:51;760] OH, MAYBE ABOUT 70 POLICE
[000:16:54;129] VEHICLES LINING OF WASHBURN
[000:16:56;331] STREET.
[000:16:57;166] THAT'S PERPENDICULAR TO FRANKLIN
[000:16:58;767] STREET, WHICH IS RIGHT IN FRONT
[000:17:00;269] OF OUR HOUSE.
[000:17:01;403] AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT, IT'S A
[000:17:03;238] LITTLE IRONIC, BECAUSE AS SOON
[000:17:04;440] AS THE GOVERNOR LIFTED THE BAN
[000:17:05;841] THAT WE COULD LEAVE OUR HOME IS
[000:17:07;409] WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT SEEMS
[000:17:11;647] HELL BROKE LOOSE.
[000:17:12;748] I GUESS THERE'S A FEW LOUD WORDS
[000:17:14;950] HERE, LOUD VOICES AND THEN I
[000:17:16;318] STARTED TO SEE POLICE RUSH DOWN
[000:17:18;620] WITH GUNS, WITH RIFLES, TOWARD
[000:17:20;989] THE CURVE OF FRANKLIN STREET.
[000:17:26;962] SO, A FEW POLICEMEN AND THEN
[000:17:30;365] CAME BECAME IN DROVES, EVERYBODY
[000:17:32;735] WAS COMING.
[000:17:33;335] THE VEHICLES WERE PARKING ALONG
[000:17:35;537] ANY WHICH WAY ON THE SIDEWALK.
[000:17:38;407] LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D SEE ON
[000:17:40;576] TELEVISION OR A MOVIE.
[000:17:41;643] MY HEART STARTED TO PALPITATE
[000:17:43;545] HERE AND I'M STILL PALPITATING.
[000:17:45;881] AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THEN THE
[000:17:48;016] S.W.A.T. TEAM CAME.
[000:17:48;717] THERE ARE ABOUT TEN INDIVIDUALS
[000:17:50;853] THAT CAME ALL IN THEIR DARK
[000:17:52;755] UNIFORMS HERE WITH RIFLES, ET
[000:17:55;124] CETERA.
[000:17:55;691] WALKING, RUNNING DOWN TO THE
[000:17:56;992] CORNER OF FRANKLIN, AS WELL.
[000:17:58;360] >> ALL RIGHT.
[000:18:00;062] IRENE, I'M GOING TO STOP YOU FOR
[000:18:01;530] A MINUTE BECAUSE WE HAVE A
[000:18:03;031] FLASH.
[000:18:03;432] WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS RIGHT
[000:18:05;534] NOW, WANT EVERYBODY TO SIT UP
[000:18:06;668] AND PAY ATTENTION.
[000:18:07;402] WE HAVE PIERRE THOMAS.
[000:18:08;804] PIERRE, WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
[000:18:09;938] >> Reporter: WE HAVE THREE
[000:18:11;673] FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES
[000:18:13;642] TELLING US THAT THE SUSPECT IS
[000:18:14;676] IN CUSTODY.
[000:18:15;644] CONDITION UNKNOWN.
[000:18:17;813] CONDITION UNKNOWN, DIANE, BUT
[000:18:19;248] OUR GUIDANCE IS THAT THE SUSPECT
[000:18:21;316] IS IN CUSTODY.
[000:18:24;586] >> IN CUSTODY.
[000:18:25;420] AND AGAIN, IT SEEMED
[000:18:27;156] INCONCEIVABLE AFTER ALL THESE
[000:18:28;123] REPORTS OF THAT GUN FIRE AND THE
[000:18:29;625] WAY HE WAS SURROUNDED, PIERRE?
[000:18:32;161] >> Reporter: AGAIN, WE ARE
[000:18:33;362] UNCLEAR ON WHAT EXACTLY HIS
[000:18:34;596] CONDITION IS, DIANE.
[000:18:35;764] I'M TRYING TO GET SOME CLARITY
[000:18:37;099] ON THAT, BUT THE GUIDANCE WE
[000:18:38;867] HAVE, A SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY
[000:18:40;702] AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING FURTHER
[000:18:43;272] INFORMATION FROM THE BOSTON AND
[000:18:44;273] LOCAL AUTHORITIES VERY SOON.
[000:18:46;208] >> AND AGAIN, WE HAD HEARD THAT
[000:18:48;510] THE HANNEBURYS, SAW THE BOAT,
[000:18:52;047] SAW BLOOD IN IT, WHICH INDICATED
[000:18:53;649] HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED,
[000:18:54;783] MAYBE IN SERIOUS CONDITION IN
[000:18:56;752] THAT BOAT, BUT BRIAN ROSS, ARE
[000:18:58;620] YOU HEARING THE SAME THING?
[000:19:02;558] >> Reporter: I AM, DIANE.
[000:19:03;659] I JUST TALKED TO WITH THE STATE
[000:19:07;663] REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS AREA.
[000:19:09;364] HE CONFIRMED THAT THAT WAS THE
[000:19:11;033] SUSPECT NUMBER TWO IN THE BOAT.
[000:19:12;367] THAT HE, IN FACT, FIRED OFF A
[000:19:14;036] NUMBER OF ROUNDS AT POLICE.
[000:19:15;437] THEY DID NOT RETURN FIRE.
[000:19:16;738] AND THAT THEY SENT IN ROBOTS TO
[000:19:18;707] LOOK AT HIM AND A SPECIAL
[000:19:20;609] MACHINE THAT COULD TIP THE BOAT
[000:19:22;277] AND TIP IT OVER.
[000:19:23;512] SO, HE HAS CONFIRMED TO ABC NEWS
[000:19:26;048] THAT IT IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO IN
[000:19:27;482] THE BOAT AND THAT HE WAS
[000:19:29;551] BLEEDING AND THEY PLANNED TO
[000:19:30;919] JUST LET HIM BLEED OUT OR WAIT
[000:19:32;588] UNTIL HE WAS IN THEY WHEN THEY
[000:19:35;490] COULDN'T RESPOND BECAUSE THEY
[000:19:36;592] WEREN'T SURE IF HE HAD A SUICIDE
[000:19:38;026] VEST ON.
[000:19:38;760] THAT'S FROM STATE REPRESENTATIVE
[000:19:40;095] JOHN LONG.
[000:19:40;562] >> AGAIN, HE SAYS TO YOU THAT
[000:19:42;497] THE SUSPECT FIRED AT THEM?
[000:19:44;366] >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:19:45;367] THE SUSPECT FIRED AT THEM.
[000:19:46;702] THEY WERE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS NOT
[000:19:47;970] TO RETURN FIRE.
[000:19:49;938] HE FIRED OFF AT THEM AND THAT
[000:19:52;441] THE EXPLOSIONS THAT WERE HEARD
[000:19:54;142] MIGHT HAVE BEEN STUN GRENADES.
[000:19:56;845] >> AH, WE DID HEAR THAT REPORT
[000:19:58;647] OF SOME EXPLOSION.W, TELL ME AB
[000:20:01;083] BOAT AGAIN AND THE PURPOSE OF
[000:20:01;817] THAT?
[000:20:04;987] >> Reporter: THEY HAVE SEVERAL
[000:20:06;688] ROBOTS THEY SENT DOWN, SOME TO
[000:20:07;756] TAKE A LOOK INSIDE THE BOAT, BUT
[000:20:09;291] THERE WAS ANOTHER MACHINE,
[000:20:10;492] ACCORDING TO REPRESENTATIVE
[000:20:11;493] LONG, THAT COULD ACTUALLY TIP
[000:20:12;928] THE BOAT, TIP HIM OUT OF THE
[000:20:14;897] BOAT.
[000:20:16;832] >> I WANT TO BRING IN DICK
[000:20:18;600] CLARK, BECAUSEHIIS STUNNING
[000:20:20;102] NEWS, DICK.
[000:20:21;470] THEY APPARENTLY WERE STANDING
[000:20:24;006] THERE, HE WAS FIRING ON THEM AND
[000:20:26;341] THEY SOME HOW COULD TIP THE BOAT
[000:20:27;976] TO TRY TO DISABLE AT LEAST HIS
[000:20:31;446] ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN FIRING AT
[000:20:32;281] THEM?
[000:20:34;316] >> WELL, IF THEY HAVE A ROBOT
[000:20:36;051] THAT'S LARGE ENOUGH AND
[000:20:37;219] CERTAINLY, THEY EXIST, AND THEY
[000:20:41;990] HAVE ARMS THAT GO UP TO
[000:20:44;126] MANIPULATE BOMBS, THEY COULD
[000:20:45;060] HAVE USED ARMS TO RIP THE SHRINK
[000:20:48;397] WRAP AND THEN TO PULL ALONG ONE
[000:20:49;765] SIDE OF THE BOAT, HAVE HIM FALL
[000:20:52;367] OUT.
[000:20:52;768] AND THAT MAY BE WHAT HAPPENED.
[000:20:53;802] >> AGAIN, WE HEARD THIS REPORT
[000:20:54;937] FROM AN EYEWITNESS AND IT WAS SO
[000:20:56;738] EARLY AND WE WERE ALL TRYING TO
[000:20:58;006] BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL, THAT THE
[000:21:00;108] POLICE HAD BEEN OVERHEARD SAYING
[000:21:01;610] THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM SNEAKING
[000:21:04;446] A LOOK OUT FROM UNDER THAT COVER
[000:21:06;415] ON THE BOAT.
[000:21:07;282] THIS SEEMS TO GIVE NEW VALIDITY
[000:21:09;384] TO THAT, BRIAN.
[000:21:12;354] >> Reporter: WELL, INDEED, AND
[000:21:14;389] REPRESENTATIVE LONG SAYS, YOU
[000:21:15;457] KNOW, IT'S OVER.
[000:21:17;292] THERE'S NOT A QUESTION NOW.
[000:21:18;827] WHEN HE CAME TO SPEAK WITH ME,
[000:21:20;395] HE SAID IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF
[000:21:22;064] MAKING SURE THAT HE IS
[000:21:25;934] INCAPACITATED SO THAT IF HE HAS
[000:21:26;935] A SUICIDE VEST, HE COULD NOT
[000:21:29;037] DETONATE IT AND HARM ANY OF THE
[000:21:29;838] OFFICERS.
[000:21:31;106] >> AND, AGAIN --
[000:21:33;675] >> Reporter: HE ALSO TOLD ME,
[000:21:36;511] DIANE, HE MENTIONED THAT THE
[000:21:37;946] GOVERNOR IS ALREADY HERE AT THE
[000:21:39;881] COMMAND CENTER AND WE SHOULD SEE
[000:21:41;183] HIM SHORTLY.
[000:21:43;685] >> ALL RIGHT, PIERRE?
[000:21:44;419] >> Reporter: DIANE, I CAN NOW
[000:21:46;355] TALK ABOUT AN EARLIER
[000:21:47;489] CONVERSATION THAT I COULD NOT
[000:21:48;790] DISCLOSE.
[000:21:49;257] AT ONE POINT, A LAW ENFORCEMENT
[000:21:51;793] OFFICIAL HERE IN WASHINGTON WAS
[000:21:53;662] LISTENING TO THE POLICE SCANNER
[000:21:55;864] TRAFFIC AND THERE WAS A MOMENT
[000:21:56;999] WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS NOT MOVING
[000:21:59;401] AND THEN APPARENTLY SAT UP IN
[000:22:01;403] THE BOAT.
[000:22:02;070] AND THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, A
[000:22:04;506] CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN IT BECAME
[000:22:06;041] CLEAR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT
[000:22:07;642] THE SUSPECT WAS, IN FACT, ALIVE.
[000:22:09;077] AND SO IT'S REMARKABLE, AFTER
[000:22:10;712] ALL OF THIS, THAT IS SUSPECT WAS
[000:22:12;547] ALIVE AT THIS POINT.
[000:22:13;648] AGAIN, WE DO NOT KNOW HIS
[000:22:14;750] CONDITION AT PRESENT.
[000:22:16;284] >> THIS IS BEYOND ANY DRAMA THAT
[000:22:18;987] CAN BE WRITTEN, PIERRE.
[000:22:20;522] AND, AGAIN, WHEN WE HEAR THAT HE
[000:22:22;224] IS IN CUSTODY, WHAT DOES THAT
[000:22:22;958] MEAN?
[000:22:25;560] >> Reporter: THAT MEANS THAT LAW
[000:22:26;862] ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TAKEN
[000:22:28;130] HIM.
[000:22:28;530] HE IS IN POLICE CUSTODY, DIANE.
[000:22:30;132] >> IT COULD MEAN HOSPITAL, IT
[000:22:32;701] COULD MEAN --
[000:22:33;635] >> Reporter: WELL, WE KNOW THAT
[000:22:35;937] THEY SENT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL,
[000:22:38;140] MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO THE SCENE,
[000:22:39;775] WHICH WOULD BE TYPICAL IN A
[000:22:41;209] SITUATION LIKE THIS, NOT ONLY
[000:22:42;310] FOR THE SUSPECT, BUT ALSO FOR
[000:22:44;279] POTENTIAL INJURIES TO POLICE, AS
[000:22:45;547] WELL.
[000:22:48;750] >> ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO GO BACK
[000:22:50;085] TO BRIAN ROSS, BECAUSE, BRIAN,
[000:22:51;453] ON THE SCENE, DO THEY NOW
[000:22:55;057] BELIEVE, AND I KNOW YOU DO NOT
[000:22:56;425] KNOW HIS CONDITION YET, COULD BE
[000:23:00;929] A SPECTRUM OF THINGS, BUT HAS
[000:23:03;698] ANYBODY SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT
[000:23:04;966] THEY BELIEVE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO
[000:23:06;268] GET SOME INFORMATION FROM HIM
[000:23:07;235] ABOUT HOW MANY INVOLVED, WHAT
[000:23:09;538] ELSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED?
[000:23:13;241] >> Reporter: CERTAINLY IF HE'S
[000:23:14;709] TAKEN ALIVE, THEN THAT SETS HIM
[000:23:17;579] UP FOR A TRIAL ON CHARGES, MOST
[000:23:19;548] LIKELY, OF PREMEDITATED MURDER
[000:23:21;983] UNDER FEDERAL LAW, AS I
[000:23:23;285] UNDERSTAND IT, THAT WOULD BE THE
[000:23:25;220] PLAN, TO TRY HIM UNDER FEDERAL
[000:23:27;489] TERRORISM CHARGES, NOT STATE
[000:23:29;257] MURDER CHARGES.
[000:23:29;925] BUT THAT DOES OPEN THE
[000:23:30;892] POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD BE
[000:23:32;360] ABLE TO BE QUESTIONED AND REVEAL
[000:23:36;865] WHETHER IT WAS JUST HE AND HIS
[000:23:38;667] BROTHER OR IF THERE WAS A LARGER
[000:23:40;502] ORGANIZATION HE WAS PART OF.
[000:23:41;403] THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY
[000:23:43;071] IMPORTANT TO STOP HIM, BUT IT'S
[000:23:45;040] ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER
[000:23:46;808] HE REPRESENTED SOMETHING THAT
[000:23:48;910] WAS DEEPER AND MORE TROUBLING.
[000:23:50;679] >> I WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY
[000:23:51;980] ABOUT A TWEET FROM MAYOR TOM
[000:23:55;417] MENINO OF BOSTON.
[000:23:56;284] HE TWEETED OUT, "WE GOT HIM."
[000:23:59;754] "WE GOT HIM."
[000:24:02;190] AND BRIAN, WHEN YOU SAY THAT
[000:24:04;126] THEY ARE BRINGING HIM IN UNDER
[000:24:06;294] FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES, WHAT
[000:24:08;330] IS THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING
[000:24:09;097] THERE?
[000:24:10;899] >> Reporter: AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
[000:24:11;967] THE PLAN WAS TO CHARGE HIM WITH
[000:24:14;803] FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES AS
[000:24:16;738] OPPOSED TO STATE MURDER CHARGES.
[000:24:19;141] NOW, ONE DISTINCTION IS THAT IN
[000:24:21;176] MASSACHUSETTS, THERE IS NO DEATH
[000:24:21;943] PENALTY.
[000:24:24;012] UNDER FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES,
[000:24:24;946] THERE COULD BE.
[000:24:26;748] BUT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING
[000:24:28;450] THAT THIS WAS A CASE, BEING
[000:24:30;018] HANDLED BY THE FBI, BY THE
[000:24:31;486] FEDERAL GOTT, AND THE
[000:24:33;622] JURISDICTION WOULD BE WITH THE
[000:24:34;756] U.S. ATTORNEY HERE IN
[000:24:35;390] MASSACHUSETTS.
[000:24:36;291] >> I WANT TO BRING BACK IN EVAN
[000:24:38;093] GOODMAN, WHO HAS BEEN SUCH A
[000:24:40;662] GREAT REPORTER, CITIZEN REPORTER
[000:24:42;430] FOR US TONIGHT.
[000:24:44;032] EVAN, YOU ARE RIGHT THERE, CLOSE
[000:24:45;901] TO THE SCENE AND YOU HEARD A
[000:24:48;136] CHEER GO UP?
[000:24:50;372] >> HI, DIANE, YES.
[000:24:52;140] SO, BASICALLY, A COUPLE OF US
[000:24:54;943] WERE OUTSIDE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
[000:24:56;444] WE HEARD A PRETTY SIZABLE CHEER
[000:24:58;813] DOWN THE ROAD, SO
[000:25:01;583] CLOSE, AND WE WALKED OUT TO THE
[000:25:04;085] FRONT AND WE INTERCEPTED A
[000:25:06;621] POLICE OFFICER AND, YOU KNOW, WE
[000:25:07;789] ASKED IF HE WAS ALIVE OR NOT AND
[000:25:09;658] THEY SAID, HE'S IN CUSTODY, HE'S
[000:25:11;459] ALIVE AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING
[000:25:12;794] TO PROSECUTE HIM AND BRING TIME
[000:25:13;662] THE JUSTICE.
[000:25:15;363] >> SO, NO INDICATION THAT HE WAS
[000:25:17;365] IN SUCH GRAVE CONDITION THEY HAD
[000:25:19;201] A DOUBT IF HE'D SURVIVE?
[000:25:21;670] >> WELL, I BELIEVE SO -- I'M
[000:25:24;072] LOOKING OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW AND I
[000:25:25;040] SAW A COUPLE OF AMBULANCES GO
[000:25:26;975] BY, I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE FOR THE
[000:25:29;411] SUSPECT.
[000:25:29;878] I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE WAS
[000:25:30;912] INJURED, YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY
[000:25:31;813] ELSE WAS INJURED.
[000:25:34;683] BUT YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE HE
[000:25:36;284] WAS BLEEDING OUT PRETTY BADLY.
[000:25:38;553] YOU KNOW, JUDGING FROM HIS
[000:25:40;188] WOUNDS EARLIER ON TODAY AND
[000:25:41;456] PROBABLY FROM THE FIRE FIGHT
[000:25:42;324] THAT WENT ON.
[000:25:43;491] BUT I DO BELIEVE HE IS ALIVE   D
[000:25:46;895] AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO
[000:25:49;531] GET SOME ANSWERS, WHICH IS
[000:25:50;465] PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTING
[000:25:52;400] FEELING, YOU KNOW, THROUGH ALL
[000:25:53;134] THIS.
[000:25:55;804] >> AND FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE
[000:25:57;672] INJURED AND IN THE HOSPITAL AND,
[000:25:58;907] OF COURSE, FOR THE FAMILIES OF
[000:26:01;476] THOSE WHO DIED AND WHO HAVE BEEN
[000:26:02;244] SO SERIOUSLY INJURED, I KNOW, AT
[000:26:04;079] THIS POINT, ANSWERS ARE
[000:26:06;147] SOMETHING THAT MATTERS, VITALLY
[000:26:08;416] TO THEM.
[000:26:09;718] AND, AGAIN, WE -- YOU ARE RIGHT
[000:26:12;554] THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BLEEDING
[000:26:15;056] ENOUGH, THAT DAVE, WHO WENT BACK
[000:26:16;291] TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT, SAW IT
[000:26:17;292] PRETTY QUICKLY.
[000:26:19;794] >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, DIANE.
[000:26:21;730] AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU GUYS A
[000:26:24;733] QUICK, WHAT'S GOING ON IN FRONT
[000:26:26;034] OF ME, BASIC LICK.
[000:26:29;938] Y
[000:26:30;472] RESIDENTS ARE ON THE STREET
[000:26:32;140] RIGHT NOW, I'M LESS THAN A BLOCK
[000:26:34;976] AWAY.
[000:26:35;377] THERE ARE FLIFR POLICE OFFICERS
[000:26:36;378] WALKING UP, PEOPLE ARE
[000:26:37;612] CONGRATULATING THEM, GIVING THEM
[000:26:38;980] PATS ON THE BACK AND, YOU KNOW,
[000:26:40;448] ASKING QUESTIONS, SO, IT'S MORE
[000:26:41;850] OF A LESS TENSE SCENARIO RIGHT
[000:26:44;319] NOW AND PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE AND
[000:26:46;221] WALKING AROUND, SO, IT SEEMS
[000:26:48;089] LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
[000:26:50;258] LENIENT, YOU KNOW, AS IT WAS
[000:26:52;661] EARLIER IN THE DAY.
[000:26:54;429] >> YES END AND, AGAIN, WE WERE
[000:26:56;398] TOLD EARLIER THAT THE GUN FIRE
[000:26:59;100] SEEMS TO BEEN COMING FROM INSIDE
[000:27:00;502] THE BOAT OUT AT POLICE, THAT
[000:27:02;237] POLICE APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN,
[000:27:03;805] THEY HAD SOME DEVICE, A ROBOTIC
[000:27:06;574] DEVICE THAT COULD BE TIPPING THE
[000:27:07;909] BOAT.
[000:27:08;310] THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A
[000:27:09;878] SUICIDE VEST AND, DICK CLARK,
[000:27:12;747] HOW WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
[000:27:14;349] DETERMINE, ULTIMATELY, IF HE HAD
[000:27:15;650] ONE ON OR NOT IF THEY COULDN'T
[000:27:16;584] APPROACH THE BOAT?
[000:27:18;353] >> WELL, I THINK THEY PROBABLY
[000:27:19;721] DID APPROACH THE BOAT WITH THE
[000:27:21;990] ROBOT.
[000:27:22;424] AND THE ROBOT PROBABLY HAD A
[000:27:24;192] CAMERA IN IT AND THEY WERE
[000:27:25;293] PROBABLY ABLE TO TELL THAT WAY
[000:27:26;695] THAT THERE WAS NO -- THERE WAS
[000:27:30;732] NO SUICIDE BELT.
[000:27:31;366] >> I WANT TO PLAY THE SOUND.
[000:27:33;234] APPARENTLY NOW WE HAVE AUDIO OF
[000:27:34;402] THE POLICE SCANNER AND YOU CAN
[000:27:36;004] HEAR, "WE GOT HIM.
[000:27:36;571] LISTEN."
[000:27:38;640] >> SUSPECT'S IN CUSTODY, BUT
[000:27:40;475] NOBODY INSIDE THE PERIMETER.
[000:27:41;343] PUT THAT OUT ON CHANNEL ONE.
[000:27:44;512] >> SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.
[000:27:48;483] AND ONLINE, OK, NOT JUST AMONG
[000:27:50;819] POLICE, NOT JUST AMONG THE
[000:27:51;820] PEOPLE OF BOSTON, BUT ALL ACROSS
[000:27:53;588] THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
[000:27:55;924] HE'S IN CUSTODY, WE NEED
[000:27:58;293] ANSWERS, AND SOMEONE SAID,
[000:28:00;128] "VICTORY, WE ARE STRONG."
[000:28:01;429] LET'S GO BACK TO LINSEY DAVIS,
[000:28:02;931] ON THE SCENE THERE IN WATERTOWN
[000:28:05;600] TONIGHT.
[000:28:06;034] LINSEY?
[000:28:08;403] >> Reporter: DIANE, IF YOU GUYS
[000:28:09;971] CAN SEE THAT AMBULANCE GOING
[000:28:10;972] DOWN THE STREET, WE BELIEVE THAT
[000:28:12;941] THE SUSPECT WAS INSIDE THAT
[000:28:14;409] AMBULANCE.
[000:28:14;909] YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE CHEERING.
[000:28:17;212] PEOPLE APPLAUDING.
[000:28:18;279] THESE SAME RESIDENTS, MANY OF
[000:28:19;681] THEM -- YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE
[000:28:21;049] HUGGING RIGHT HERE.
[000:28:22;083] VERY JUBILANT ON THE SCENE.
[000:28:23;251] MANY OF THESE SAME PEOPLE WERE
[000:28:24;486] STANDING ON THE CORNER WHEN THE
[000:28:25;620] POLICE WENT IN AND THEY WERE
[000:28:27;055] CHEERING THEN AND YELLING.
[000:28:29;224] MOMENTS AGO, WE HEARD THEM SAY,
[000:28:31;960] "WE GOT HIM" AND THEY WERE
[000:28:33;294] CHEERING AGAIN.
[000:28:33;995] ONE LITTLE BOY SAID TO HIS DAD,
[000:28:36;398] "IT IS OVER?"
[000:28:37;198] AND HE SAID, "YEAH, SON, IT'S
[000:28:40;068] OVER."
[000:28:40;502] AND THEY HUGGED.
[000:28:41;102] PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED.
[000:28:42;837] CERTAINLY, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
[000:28:44;038] VERY RELIEVED.
[000:28:44;739] >> AND MORE FROM THE MAYOR OF
[000:28:46;741] BOSTON.
[000:28:47;175] "I HAVE NEVER LOVED THIS CITY
[000:28:49;411] AND ITS PEOPLE MORE THAN I DO
[000:28:51;146] TODAY.
[000:28:51;579] NOTHING CAN DEFEAT THE HEART OF
[000:28:52;981] THIS CITY, NOTHING."
[000:28:54;349] AND HIS EARLIER TWEET, "WE GOT
[000:28:56;418] HIM."
[000:28:56;851] CANNOT HELP BUT ECHO IN THE MIND
[000:29:00;054] OF EVERYBODY WHEN SOMEONE SAID
[000:29:03;158] THAT ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN AND
[000:29:08;396] OBAMA, AS WEL0
[000:29:09;397] BAM OSAMA, AS WELL.
[000:29:11;399] POLICE SAY THEY HAVE HIM IN
[000:29:15;703] CUSTODY.
[000:29:16;137] I WANT TO SEE IF YOU HAVE
[000:29:19;941] ANYTHING FROM THE SOURCES THAT
[000:29:20;642] HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL NIGHT.
[000:29:22;177] >> Reporter: DIANE, WE CAN
[000:29:23;945] CONFIRM THAT THE SUSPECT IS
[000:29:25;046] ALIVE.
[000:29:25;647] HE'S IN THAT AMBULANCE.
[000:29:26;514] ONE OF OUR OFFICIALS GOT A TEXT
[000:29:29;317] FROM THE SCENE SAYING SUSPECT IS
[000:29:31;052] ALIVE IN THE AMBULANCE.
[000:29:31;786] >> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO JON
[000:29:33;021] KARL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:29:34;155] JON, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THERE
[000:29:35;557] AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT
[000:29:38;126] WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, IMMEDIATELY
[000:29:38;960] IN THE NEXT HOURS?
[000:29:41;596] >> Reporter: WELL, DIANE,
[000:29:43;198] DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION OF
[000:29:44;065] THE SUSPECT, THE NEXT THING YOU
[000:29:45;200] CAN EXPECT TO HAPPEN WILL BE THE
[000:29:47;335] ACTIVATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:29:49;304] HIGH VALUE INTERROGATION GROUP.
[000:29:51;673] THIS IS A GROUP MADE UP OF THE
[000:29:53;942] CIA, THE DIA AND THE FBI.
[000:29:58;346] THIS WAS SET UP BY PRESIDENT
[000:30:00;181] OBAMA IN 2009 AFTER THEY DID
[000:30:01;916] AWAY WITH THE CIA'S
[000:30:03;885] INTERROGATION PROGRAM AND IT IS
[000:30:05;286] DESIGNED FOR EXACTLY THIS
[000:30:07;155] SITUATION.
[000:30:07;755] TO GO IN AND TO INTERROGATE
[000:30:10;091] SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IMMEDIATELY
[000:30:12;994] AFTER THEIR APPREHENSION.
[000:30:14;028] I HAVE BEEN TOLD PRIOR TO THIS
[000:30:15;663] THAT THIS GROUP WAS ON STAND-BY
[000:30:17;565] AND READY TO GO.
[000:30:18;600] THAT'S THE NEXT THING WE'RE
[000:30:19;734] LOOKING FOR.
[000:30:20;502] TRYING TO GET INTELLIGENCE AND
[000:30:21;836] INFORMATION OUT OF THIS
[000:30:23;471] INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THE BIG
[000:30:24;439] QUESTION HERE, DIANE, THAT THE
[000:30:26;007] ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
[000:30:27;375] HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON IS WHETHER
[000:30:29;177] OR NOT THESE BROTHERS WERE
[000:30:30;712] ACTING ALONE OR WHETHER OR NOT
[000:30:32;013] THEY WERE PART OF A LARGER GROUP
[000:30:33;715] AND THERE COULD BE OTHER
[000:30:35;383] PLOTTERS OUT THERE.
[000:30:36;117] >> AGAIN, MARTHA RADDATZ, WE
[000:30:37;785] KNOW HIS OLDER BROTHER HAD GONE
[000:30:39;287] BACK TO RUSSIA.
[000:30:40;722] WE HAVE A KIND OF DARK AGE IN
[000:30:43;658] THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHEN HE
[000:30:45;293] WAS BACK IN RUSSIA.
[000:30:46;160] WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE WENT.
[000:30:47;896] >> Reporter: WE HAVE NO IDEA.
[000:30:49;497] HE WAS THERE SIX MONTHS.
[000:30:50;765] SO, THAT'S A PERIOD THEY'RE
[000:30:52;700] REALLY GOING TO LOOK AT AND IF
[000:30:54;802] THEY CAN INTERROGATE THIS
[000:30:56;504] SUSPECT, THEY WILL DO THAT, THE
[000:30:57;739] YOUNGER BROTHER.
[000:30:58;306] THEY WILL ASK HIM WHATEVER THEY
