THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO COME OUT

SENATOR McCAIN FOR STANDING UP

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
AND STOPPING THIS BILL.

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
BOTTOM LINE, A NUMBER OF

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY PISH THE

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
BIPARTISAN TALKS TO TRY TO FIX
OBAMACARE WERE CONTINUING.

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
>> I FELT LIKE WE WERE MAKING

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
STEADY PROS TOWARD A BIPARTISAN

THERE'S AN AN ABRUPT HALT BY THE

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE WILL

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HAVE A VOTE THIS COMING WEEK ON

THIS BILL.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I HAVE CONCERNS HOW IT WILL

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
AFFECT DELAWARE AND THE COUNTRY

121
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
AND I PLAN TO VOTE AGAINST IT.

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
>> MITCH McCONNELL INTENDS TO

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
BRING UP GRAHAM-CASSIDY NEXT

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000

MODERATOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
JOHN McCAIN GAVE HIS REASONS.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
LAST TIME AROUND, HE MADE A

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
PRETTY CLEAR STATEMENT WHEN HE

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
WAS THAT DRAMATIC VOTE FOR NO.

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
WE HAVE A FULL SCREEN OF THAT

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'D LIKE TO SHOW THE VIEWING
AUDIENCE.

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
HERE IT IS.

136
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID LAST TIME.

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THE CONGRESS MUST NOW RETURN TO

138
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
REGULAR ORDER.

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HOLD HEARINGS.
RECEIVE INPUT FROM MEMBERS OF

140
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
BOTH PARTIES.

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AND HEED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
OUR NATION'S GOVERNORS SO THAT

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WE CAN PRODUCE A BILL THAT

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
FINALLY PROVIDES AMERICANS WITH

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
ACCESS TO QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE

146
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
HEALTHCARE.

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THAT PART OF IT HADN'T CHANGED,

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
THOUGH THIS IS TECHNICALLY

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
REGULAR ORDER IT WASN'T.

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
COMMITTEES HAD MET ON IT, AND

151
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
HADN'T MARKED IT UP.

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
>> EXACTLY RIGHT.

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
THE COMMITTEES HAVE NOT MET ON
IT.

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THEY'LL HOLD ONE OR TWO HEARINGS

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
THIS NEXT WEEK.

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
SIMPLY, I THINK, TRYING TO

158
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
SATISFY JOHN McCAIN,nd SOME

159
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
OTHERS WHO SAID THIS IS A HECK

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
OF A WAY TO COMPLETELY REFORM

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THE HEALTH SYSTEM, ONE-SIXTH OF

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THE ECONOMY.

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A CBL

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
SCORE, CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
OFFICE.

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
THE IMPACT ON PREMIUMS OR THE

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
IMPACT IT WOULD HAVE ON MILLIONS

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OF PEOPLE POTENTIALLY LOSING

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
THEIR COVERAGE.

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
JOHN McCAIN DECIDED TO PULL THE
PLUG EARLY.

171
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
ONE, THE FINAL VOTE AS HE WAS
LAST TIME, WHEN HE LITERALLY PUT

173
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
HIS THUMB DOWN.

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
BUT HE MADE IT CLEAR HE'S A NO

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
VOTE.

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
RAND PAUL HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE'S
A NO VOTE.

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE LINE

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ABOUT THE KNIGHT AND THE PRINCE,

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
IN THE PRINCESS BRIDE, IT'S

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
MOSTLY DEAD, THIS IS MOSTLY DEAD

181
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
RIGHT NOW.

182
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I SUPPOSE SUSAN COLLINS COULD

183
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
CHANGE BUT SHE'S BEEN AGAINST

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
ALL OF THESE REPEAL AND REPLACE

185
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
PLANS.

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'D BE SHOCKED IF SHE WERE TO

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
CHANGE.

188
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
LISA MURKOWSKI HAS BEEN AGAINST

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
ALMOST ALL OF THEM.

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'D BE A LITTLE LESS SHOCKED IF

191
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
SHE CHANGED.

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
SHELLEY MOORE OF WEST VIRGINIA,

193
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO, GRASSLEY

194
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
AND EARNS THE FROM IOWA.

195
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPOSITION.

196
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
IT'S ON- SUPPORT, WOULD BE AN

197
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
OVERSTATEMENT.

198
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
ON LIFE SUPPORT.

199
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
>> Shepard: LISA MURKOWSKI OF

200
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
ALASKA, THERE'S A LARGE GIFT

201
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
BASKET WAITING IN THE WINGS,
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FOR THE

202
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
PEOPLE OF ALASKA IF SHE CHANGES

203
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
HER MIND.
>> YES, THERE'S A PROVISION FOR

204
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
SPARSELY POPULATED STATES,

205
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ALASKA CERTAINLY QUALIFIES AS A

206
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
SPARSELY POPULATED STATE, THAT

207
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
THEY WOULD NOT FALL UNDER ALL OF

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THE PROVISIONS AND IT WOULD MAKE

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
SURE THAT THEY GOT MORE FUNDING

210
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
RATHER THAN LESS FUNDING WHICH

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE IF THEY

212
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
WERE TREATED LIKE EVERY OTHER
STATE.

213
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THIS IS, IT'S INTERESTING TO

214
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
SEE, SHEP, WE ALL REMEMBER

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OBAMACARE, ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS

216
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT REPUBLICANS HAD AT THE TIME
ABOUT THE MESSY WAY THAT WAS

217
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
PASSED.

218
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
WE HAVE A PASS IT IN ORDER TO

219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FIND OUT WHAT'S IN IT.

220
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
THINGS ARE JAMMED DOWN.

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
THERE WAS THE CORNHUSKER

222
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
KICKBACK, ALL OF THE SPECIAL

223
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
DEALS TO BUY THE VOTES OF

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
SENATORS.

225
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
YOU'RE SEEING ALL OF THAT IF NOT

226
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
MORE ON THE PART OF REPUBLICANS

227
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
THIS TIME.

228
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
IT'S PERFECT HYPOCRISY, WHAT YOU

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
SEE ON CAPITOL HILL.

230
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
>> Shepard: I WANTED TO SPEAK

231
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SPECIAL ABOUT SUSAN COLLINS OF

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
MAINE.
FOR HER, SHE SAID REPEATEDLY, I

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
THINK, CHRIS, THIS IS ABOUT
MEDICAID.

234
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
HER CONCERNS ABOUT IT.

235
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

236
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE

237
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
FORMULA, MAINE WOULD DO BETTER,

238
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THERE ARE SOME STATES, ABOUT 31

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
STATES THAT ARE LOSERS IN THIS

240
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
BILL.

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE WINNERS.

242
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
MAINE WOULD BE A WINNER.

243
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
BUT SHE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

244
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
THE MEDICAID.

245
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
IT TURNS IT FROM A BASICALLY

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
OPEN-ENDED ENTITLEMENT INTO A

247
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
BLOCK GRANT AND EVENTUALLY A

248
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
FORMULA WITH DIMINISHING

249
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
FINANCING PER CAPITA, PER

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
PERSON.

251
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
IN THE LONG RUN, CERTAINLY AFTER

252
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
2026, PEOPLE ON MEDICAID GET

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
LESS FUNDING THAN IN THE PAST.

254
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
SUSAN COLLINS IS MAD ABOUT THAT.

255
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
YOU SAW THE GOVERNOR, THE

256
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
INDEPENDENT GOFF OF MAINE

257
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
JOIN -- GOVERNOR OF MAINE TO

258
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
JOIN WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT TO

259
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
URGE HER TO DO IT.

260
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
SHE'S REPORTING A LOT OF FOLKS

261
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
IN MAINE LIKE HER STAND AGAINST

262
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
PASSING THIS BILL.

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
>> Shepard: IT SEEMS THAT LAST

264
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
TIME THE REPUBLICANS CAME UP

265
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
WITH A PLAN, IT ONLY HAD 17%

266
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
APPROVAL ACROSS THE NATION.

267
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
THIS TIME THE CONCERN SEEMS TO

268
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
BE IF NOT PRIMARILY, LARGELY,

269
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
ABOUT A CAP ON LIFETIME BENEFITS

270
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING

271
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
CONDITIONS.

272
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
AND THEY'RE DISCUSSING THIS IN

273
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THE JIMMY KIMMEL WAY, IF YOU

274
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HAVE A CHILD WHO NEEDS MULTIPLE

275
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
IN HIS CASE HEART SURGERIES AND

276
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
YOU HAVE A MILLION DOLLAR CAP

277
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
AND YOUR CHILD DICE AS A RESULT

278
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
OF THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
ENOUGH MONEY THAT SEEMS TO BE A

280
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
CONCERN FOR A LOT OF VOTERS.

281
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> LOOK, THE PROBLEM IS THAT

282
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WHAT THIS DOES IS BASICALLY

283
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
KEEPS ALL OF THE TAXES FROM

284
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
OBAMACARE AND DOES AWAY WITH THE

285
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
MANDATES, DOES AWAY WITH THE

286
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
MEDICAL DEVICE TAX.

287
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
IT TAKES THE OTHER BIG TAXES AND

288
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
SIMPLY GIVES IT BACK TO THE

289
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
STATE AND SAYS FEDERALISM, YOU

290
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
DO IT.

291
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY STATE

292
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN AND

293
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET WAIVERS

294
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
FROM THE DEPARTMENT, FROM

295
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
WASHINGTON, FROM THE DEPARTMENT

296
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OF

297
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
APPROPRIATE AND AFFORDABLE

298
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
COVERAGE.

299
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THAT MEANS.

300
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
NOW, THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT

301
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
SOME STATES, LIBERAL STATES,

302
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
BLUE STATES, WOULD HAVE VERY

303
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
LENIENT BENEFITS AND WOULD, FOR

304
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
INSTANCE, PEOPLE WITH

305
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ARE WELL

306
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
COVERED.
OTHER STATES WE AREN'T SURE.

307
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
WHO KNOWS WHAT A WAIVER FOR

308
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
APPROPRIATE AND AFFORDABLE
COVERAGE MEANS.

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THERE IS A CONCERN.

310
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WE DON'T KNOW, IN FACT, BUT

311
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THERE IS A CONCERN THAT SOME SAY

312
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS MAY

313
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
SAY ON PAPER THEY CAN GET

314
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
COVERAGE BUT IN TERMS OF THE

315
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
FINANCING, COST OF THE PREMIUMS

316
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OR DEDUCTIBLES, THEY CAN'T.

317
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
>> Shepard: IT'S NOT DEAD BUT

318
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
IT'S EXTREMELY COLD AND

319
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
EXTREMELY WHITE.

320
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
>> IT'S MOSTLY DEAD.

321
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
>> Shepard: THE LEADERS OF NORTH

322
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
KOREA AND UNITED STATES ARE

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
PERSON
ALLY INSULTING EACH OTHER

324
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
AND BRINGING THE NUCLEAR

325
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
STANDOFF TO A NEW LEVEL.
THE DICTATOR KIM JUDGE UN HAS

326
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP MENTALLY

327
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
DERANGED N A PERSONAL STATEMENT,

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
IT COMES AFTER PRESIDENT PLUMP
THREATENED TO TOTALLY DESTROY

329
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
NORTH KOREA IF THAT IS WHAT IT

330
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
TAKES TO DEFEND THE UNITED
STATES.

331
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THAT WAS DURING HIS SPEECH TO
THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL

332
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
ASSEMBLY.
ACCORDING TO NORTH KOREAN STATE

333
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
TELEVISION, KIM JUNG UN SAID

334
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
WHATEVER TRUMP MIGHT HAVE
EXPECTED HE WILL FACE RESULTS

335
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
BEYOND HIS EXPECTATION.

336
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED THIS

337
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
MORNING, KIM JUN-UN OF NORTH

338
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
KOREA, OBVIOUS LAY MADMAN,

339
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
DOESN'T MIND STARVING AND

340
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
KILLING HIS PEOPLE, WILL BE

341
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
TESTED LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

342
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
NOW, NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN MIN

343
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
CITY SAID THEY MIGHT CONSIDER

344
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TESTING A HYDROGEN BOMB IN THE
PACIFIC OCEAN.

345
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
HERE'S HOW THE SECRETARY OF

346
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
STATE, REX TILLERSON, RESPONDED

347
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
TO THAT.
>> ALL OF OUR MILITARY OPTIONS

348
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
ARE ON THE TABLE AS THE
PRESIDENT SAID.

349
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
THERE WILL BE ASSEMBLED AND

350
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
THERE IS ASSEMBLED A NATIONAL

351
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
SECURITY COUNCIL THAT MEETS ON

352
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
EACH OF THESE ISSUES TO ADVISE

353
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THE PRESIDENT.

354
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
IT WILL BE HIS DECISION
ULTIMATELY.

355
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> Shepard: SECRETARY TILLERSON

356
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
SAID THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE

357
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
EFFORTS IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA

358
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A BACK TO CHRIS WALLACE.

359
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
GOING AT IT LIKE CHILDREN IN A

360
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
PLAYGROUND, DOES THIS LEAD TO

361
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
WAR?
YESTERDAY THE STOCK MARKET

362
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
SEEMED TO SUGGEST SO, 10 DEFENSE

363
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
STOCKS HIT THE ALL-TIME HIGH.

364
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
>> WE'RE A WAYS AWAY FROM THAT.

365
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
GENERAL McMASTER, H.R. McMASTER,

366
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, SAID

367
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF ROAD.

368
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THERE IS MORE ROAD.

369
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
YOU CAN SEE THAT YESTERDAY WHEN

370
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THAT HE

371
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER GIVING

372
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
THE TREASURY SECRETARY THE

373
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
POWERS TO CUT OFF ANY TRADE, ANY

374
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
DEALINGS WITH ANY COMPANY, ANY

375
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
BANK, THAT HAS TRADE OR DEALINGS

376
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
WITH NORTH KOREA.

377
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
PRESIDENT ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT

378
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
CHINESE, THE CHINESE CENTRAL
BANK, IN ACCOUNT THEIR FEDERAL

379
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
RESERVE, IS ORDERING ALL OF

380
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
THEIR BANKS TO CUT OFF ANY

381
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH

382
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
PYONGYANG, WITH THE KIM REGIME.

383
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
WE'LL WAIT TO SEE HOW IT WORKS,

384
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
WHETHER SQUEEZING NORTH KOREA IN

385
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
THAT FINANCIAL AND TRADE SENSE

386
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
SHAKES ANY SENSE INTO THE KIM

387
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
REGIME AND GETS THEM TO STAND

388
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
DOWN.

389
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THE QUESTION, SHEP, IS WHETHER

390
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
KIM HAS MADE IN EFFECT AN

391
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
EXISTENTIAL CHOICE, BELIEVES

392
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
THAT HAVING A LONG-RANGE

393
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
BALLISTIC MISSILE WITH A NUCLEAR

394
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
WAR HEAD ON IT IS NOT THE PATH

395
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
TO DISASTER BUT THE PATH TO

396
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
SURVIVAL FOR HIS REGIME.

397
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU KNOW, HE LOOKS AROUND THE

398
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
WORLD, SEES SADDAM HUSSEIN, NO

399
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,

400
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ENDED UP DEAD.

401
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
SAME WITHCA DAFIE AND MAY

402
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
HAVE -- KHADAFFI.

403
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
THE THING THAT ENSURES HIS

404
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
SURVIVAL HE BELIEVES IS TO HAVE

405
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

406
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
>> Shepard: WONDER WHAT KIND OF

407
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
REACTION HE'D GET TO AN H-BOMB

408
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
TEST IN THE PACIFIC.

409
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
>> WE HAVE HAD H-BOMB TESTS

410
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
BEFORE, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

411
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
WE THINK, IT WAS UNDERGROUND.

412
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
THIS WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE MORE

413
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
STUNNING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

414
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
OVER GROUND.

415
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
IT WOULD BE OVER THE WATER.

416
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
WE WOULD SEE THE MUSHROOM CLOUD

417
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THAT WOULD BRING HOME WHAT THE

418
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THREAT IS.

419
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
DO I THINK WE'LL GO TO WAR OVER

420
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A NUCLEAR TEST, PROBABLY NOT.

421
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
PARTICULARLY NOT WITH ALL OF

422
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
THESE SANCTIONS JUST GETTING

423
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
STARTED.

THE WHITE HOUSE IS GETTING SET

433
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
TO TAKE ANOTHER TRY AT A TRAVEL

434
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
BAN.

435
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
THE FIRST BAN CAUSED A BIT OF

436
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
CHAOS.

437
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
SO WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIME?

438
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
JUST RELEASED DETAILS COMING UP

Experience Amazing at
your Lexus dealer.

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
WHEN YOU'RE CLOSE TO
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,

446
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
DOES PSORIASIS EVER GET IN
THE WAY OF A TOUCHING MOMENT?

447
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
IF YOU HAVE MODERATE TO SEVERE
PSORIASIS, YOU CAN EMBRACE

448
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
THE CHANCE OF COMPLETELY
CLEAR SKIN WITH TALTZ.

449
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
TALTZ IS PROVEN TO GIVE YOU A
CHANCE AT COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

450
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
WITH TALTZ, UP TO
90% OF PATIENTS

451
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
OF THEIR PSORIASIS PLAQUES.

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
IN FACT, 4 OUT OF 10 EVEN
ACHIEVED COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO TALTZ.

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
BEFORE STARTING YOU
SHOULD BE CHECKED
FOR TUBERCULOSIS.

455
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
TALTZ MAY INCREASE YOUR
RISK OF INFECTIONS

456
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
AND LOWER YOUR ABILITY
TO FIGHT THEM.

457
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
YOU ARE BEING TREATED

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
FOR AN INFECTION
OR HAVE SYMPTOMS.

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
OR IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED
A VACCINE OR PLAN TO.

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
CAN HAPPEN WITH TALTZ.

461
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
INCLUDING WORSENING OF SYMPTOMS.

462
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
SERIOUS ALLERGIC
REACTIONS CAN OCCUR.

463
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE AT
COMPLETELY CLEAR SKIN.

464
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
JUST ASK YOUR
DOCTOR ABOUT TALTZ.

NOW'S YOUR CHANCE AT

ORDER TO REPLACE THE

CONTROVERSIAL TRAVEL BAND.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

483

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
EACH COUNTRY.

485
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
BASED ON WHAT THEY CALL MULTIPLE

486
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
FACTORS INCLUDING THE THREAT

487
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000

IT COOPERATES WITH U.S.

REGULATIONS.

490
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THE NEW RULES WOULD REPLACE

KEVIN?
>> RIGHT ON THE MONEY, SHEPARD.

502
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
WE TALKED ABOUT THE PREVIOUS SIX

503
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
COUNTRY, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
COUNTRIES WILL BE INVOLVED IN

505
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
THE NEW TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS.

506
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
WE DO HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY

507
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN

508
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
LEARNING FROM ADMINISTRATION

509
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
SOURCES AND BASE ON WHAT WE

510
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
LEARNED FROM A RECENTLY

511
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
CONCLUDED CALL THE NUMBER OF

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
COUNTRIES INVOLVED WILL LIKELY

513
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
EXPAND TO INCLUDE MORE THAN THE

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
ORIGINAL SIX COUNTRIES THAT WE

515
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
TALKED ABOUT.
LET ME SHARE PART OF AN

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
ADMINISTRATION STATEMENT THEY'VE

517
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IDEA OF

518
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SECURING THE HOMELAND AND MOST

519
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
IMPORTANTLY PROTECTING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL ENSURE

521
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
WE ONLY ADMIT THOSE PROPERLY

522
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
VOTED AND WILL NOT POSE A THREAT

523
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
TO NATIONAL SECURITY OR PUBLIC
SAFETY.

524
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
SO IN EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF

525
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
COUNTRIES ON THE LIST THE

526
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES AS YOU

527
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
SAID, TO CREATE MORE

528
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
RESTRICTIONS BUT ON A

529
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

530
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
THIS IS ALSO RELEVANT FOR ONE

531
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
MAJOR IMPORTANT REASON, THAT IS

532
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
BY EXPANDING IT AND MAKING IT

533
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
COUNTRY-TO-COUNTRY, SHEPARD,

534
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
WHAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVELY TRYING

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
TO DO IS BLUNT PERHAPS SOME OF

536
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
THE LEGAL PUSHBACK THAT THE

537
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
ADMINISTRATION HAS PREVIOUSLY

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
GOTTEN.

539
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
YOU MAY RECALL THE STATE

540
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
DEPARTMENT SAID THERE WERE LIKE

541
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
17 COUNTRIES NOT UP TO U.S.

542
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
STANDARDS AND FAILED TO FALL

543
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
INTO COMPLIANCE B HALF HAVE.

544
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
WE'LL SEE WHAT THAT NUMBER LOOKS

545
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
LIKE.

546
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I WANT TO SHARE A TWEET THAT THE

547
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
PRESIDENT SENT OUT AFTER AN

548
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000

WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE OUTER
REGIONS.

615
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
IT WAS EXPECTED, ANTICIPATED,

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
THAT ISIS CONTROLS IN IRAQ.

912
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
AS IF THE PENTAGON DOESN'T HAVE

913
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
ENOUGH TO KEEP IT'SES ON, RUSSIA

914
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
TEST FIRED AN INTERCONTINENTAL

915
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
BALLISTIC MISS WILL A 7,500 MILE

CITY IN THE UNITED STATES.

918
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THE U.S.

919
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
WAS WARNED ABOUT THE TEST LAUNCH

920
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
IN ACCORDANCE A WITH

921
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
LONG-STANDING TREATMENTIES.

922
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
RUSSIA HAS BEEN USING SYRIA FOR

923
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
TESTING.

924
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
THAT HAS THE PENTAGON CONCERNED.

925
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU.

926
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE COMMANDER

927
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000

EVENTS IN THE FIGHTING INCLUDING

931
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THE NINE-MONTH FIGHT FOR THE

932
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
CITY OF MOSUL.

933
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THIS PHOTO FROM MOSUL YESTERDAY.

934
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
MUCH OF THAT CITY IS DEVASTATED

935
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
FROM THE FIGHTING.

936
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
THE GENERAL IS AN AIR FORCE

937
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
FIGHTER PILOT WITH MORE THAN 30

938
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
YEARS EXPERIENCE.

939
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
HE FLIES OVER IRAQ AND SYRIA

940
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
NOW, THIS SHOT FROM JUNE AS HE

941
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
REFUELED DURING A RISHGS.

942
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
THE GENERAL IS ALSO A PURPLE

943
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
HEART RECIPIENT N1996 HE WAS

944
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
STATIONED IN SAUDI ARABIA WHEN

945
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
HE WAS INJURED IN THE BOMBING OF

946
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
THE KOBAR TOWERS.

947
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
19 AIRMEN DIED IN THAT ATTACK,

948
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
SOME 300 OTHERS HURT.

949
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
LT. GENERAL JEFFREY COBRA

950
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
HARIGIAN, CENTRAL COMMAND, HAN

951
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
HONOR TO HAVE YOU.

952
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
>> IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.

953
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
>> DOES ANYTHING CHANGE IN

954
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
REGARDS TO THE RUSSIANS?

955
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
>> STEP ONE IS MANAGE THE DEACON

956
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
FLICKS, GET BACK TO THE FIGHT

957
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
AGAINST ISIS.

958
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AND

959
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
IN COORDINATION WITH THE TEAM TO

960
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
MAKE SURE WE HAVE DEACON FLIKTED

961
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
TO GET OF ONE IN THE SIGS FIGHT.

962
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
WE'LL GET THE TEAM IN POSITION

963
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
TO ENSURE THERE'S NOT A

964
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
STRATEGIC MISCOMMUNICATION THAT

965
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
CAN OCCUR.

966
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
>> Shepard: THE RUSSIANS WERE

967
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
FIRING ON OTHERS, OUR SPECIAL OP

968
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
FORCES NEARBY.

969
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
IT WAS TOO CLOSE.

970
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
AND WE SAID, BASICALLY, DON'T DO

971
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
IT AND THEY SAID WE'LL FIRE ON

972
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
YOU.

973
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
DOES THAT CHANGE ANYTHING ON THE

974
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
GROUND?
>> WELL, I THINK THE IMPORTANT

975
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
PART TO REMEMBER HERE IS WE WILL

976
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
PROTECT OUR FORCE.

977
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
IT SHOULD BE CRYSTAL CLEAR IN

978
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
EVERY AMERICAN'S MIND THAT WE'RE

979
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
FOG TO PROTECT OUR FORCE.

980
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
WE WORK THROUGH THIS, I THINK

981
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT

982
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
NEEDS TO OCCUR IS GETTING BACK

983
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
TO FIGHTING ISIS, DE-CONFLICTING

984
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
OUR FORCES, ENSURING THE

985
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
MECHANISM TO DO THAT, WHAT IS

986
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
REQUIRED IS A CONTINUED
COVERINGS WITH THE RUSSIANS TO

987
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

988
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
>> Shepard: WE HAD A MEETING

989
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THAT HAPPENS AT UNDISCLOSED, ALL

990
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
THE REST, A MEETING YOU WOULD

991
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
HAVE ATTENDED HAD YOU NOT BEEN

992
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
HERE.

993
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
>> I HAD A REPRESENTATIVE THERE.

994
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
AND THAT REPRESENTATIVE GAVE ME

995
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
FULL FEEDBACK ON HOW THAT PLAYED

996
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
OUT.

997
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
AND THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE.

998
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
>> I KNOW WE CAN'T KNOW DETAILS,

999
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW DETAILS.

1000
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, IF YOU CAN

1001
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
TELL US, ARE THINGS GETTING

1002
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
BETTER.
>> THERE WAS PROGRESS MADE.

1003
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
IT WILL BE PIECEMEAL AND IT WILL

1004
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
TAKE TIME.

1005
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
THE KEY IS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE

1006
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
WORK THROUGH DE-CON FLICKS THAT

1007
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
ALLOWS US TO CONTINUE OUR FIGHT.

1008
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO

1009
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
ENCIRCLE AND ANNIHILATE ISIS

1010
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE

1011
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
EUPHRATES RIVER VALLEY.

1012
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
>> IS THAT WHAT THE RUSSIANS

1013
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
WANT?
ARE WE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE?

1014
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

1015
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
TEAM-TO-TEAM, RUSSIANS AND
AMERICANS.

1016
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE

1017
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
COMMUNICATED TO US.
PUT AT THE END OF THE DAY AS YOU

1018
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
KNOW, ACTIONS SPEECH LOUDER THAN

1019
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
WORDS.

1020
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
WE HAVE TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH

1021
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
THAT, FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE MAKE

1022
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
SURE THAT OUR AIRMEN, OUR

1023
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
TEAMMATES ON THE GROUND, OUR

1024
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
SOLDIERS AND OUR PARTNERS ARE IN

1025
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
A POSITION TO CONTINUE THAT

1026
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.

1027
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
>> Shepard: OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

1028
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
THINGS IS THAT WE'RE BOMBING

1029
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
MORE TARGETS IN SYRIA, ISIS

1030
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
RELATED, THAN IN THE PAST.

1031
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
IS THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE

1032
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TARGETS OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?

1033
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> WELL I THINK IT'S COMBINATION

1034
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO

1035
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
DEVELOP TARGETS.

1036
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
OVER TIME, AS WE'VE SPENT TIME

1037
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
USING OUR INTELLIGENCE,

1038
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
SURVEILLANCE, AND RECON SAYS

1039
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
ASSETS WE HAVE A BETTER

1040
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

1041
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
ENVIRONMENT.

1042
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
THE SECOND BIG PIECE IS THE

1043
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
SIRRIAL DEMOCRATIC FORCES ARE ON

1044
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
THE MOVE.

1045
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
IN RA" A, THE GREAT SUCCESS,

1046
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
ALONG WITH THE MIDDLE EUPHRATES

1047
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
RIVER VALLEY THAT, DRIVES

1048
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
ACTIVITY.

1049
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
>> Shepard: SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC

1050
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
FORCES.
THAT'S THE ONES WE FIGHT WITH

1051
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT?

1052
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
>> YES, SIR.
THAT'S IT.

1053
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
>> Shepard: ARE THEY GETTING

1054
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
BETTER AT WHAT THEY DO, AND ARE

1055
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
THEY -- CAN THEY STAND UP?

1056
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
>> WOULD I TELL YOU, THEIR

1057
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
ASYMMETRIC ADVANTAGE IS AIR
POWER.

1058
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
WE PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY TO

1059
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
REMAIN ON THE OFFENSIVE.

1060
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
AND PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSITION

1061
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
TO SUCCEED.

1062
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE TODAY.
>> Shepard: THE CRITICS SAID

1063
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
REPEATEDLY THAT OUR AIR FORCE IS

1064
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
WORKING FOR IRAN IN THAT MATTER.

1065
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
>> I WOULD DENY THAT.

1066
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
>> Shepard: I WOULDN'T SUGGEST

1067
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
ANYTHING ELSE.

1068
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
BUT WE CAN SEE WHERE THEY'RE

1069
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
COMING FROM.

1070
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.

1071
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
BUT I THINK IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE

1072
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
SUPPORTING THE SBS IN THEIR

1073
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
OPERATION, THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC

1074
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
FORCES, TO DELIBERATE THESE

1075
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
CITIES IN SYRIA.

1076
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
THEY HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE AT
DOING THAT AND WE'RE SUPPORTING

1077
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
THEM EVERY DAY AND CONTINUE TO

1078
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
DO THAT.

1079
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
>> Shepard: WHEN YOU TAKE OUT

1080
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
ISIS WHAT HAPPENS THEN?

1081
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
>> WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS

1082
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
FACILITATE THE ABILITY FOR THE
POLITICAL PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE

1083
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
SO THAT GOVERNANCE CAN OCCUR

1084
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ALLOW THE

1085
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
PEOPLE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

1086
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
THE KIDS TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL.

1087
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
>> Shepard: THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

1088
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
FROM EVERYTHING WE SEE IT LOOKS

1089
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
LIKE SYRIA IS PRETTY WELL
DESTROYED.

1090
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
>> THAT WILL BE A HEAVY LIFT.

1091
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
BUT THE SYRIAN DEMOCRATIC FORCES

1092
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
COMBINED WITH OUR PRECISION

1093
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
TARGETING HAVE DONE AS MUCH AS

1094
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THEY CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT

1095
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS STANDING.

1096
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
GO AHEAD.

1097
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
>> Shepard: I DIDN'T MEAN TO

1098
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
INTERRUPT.
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT

1099
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
IRAQ.

1100
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S VERY

1101
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
GOOD PROGRESS THERE.

1102
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
IN FACT, FROM A LOT OF READING

1103
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS, IT

1104
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE COLLAPSING

1105
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
MORE QUICKLY THAN HAD BEEN

1106
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
ANTICIPATED.

1107
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
>> I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU.

1108
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
THE WORD I'M USING IS MOMENTUM.

1109
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
THEY HAVE MOMENTUM.

1110
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
IT'S BECAUSE THE IRAQIE SKRT

1111
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
FORCES PROVE THEMSELVES TO BE

1112
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
VERY CONFIDENT IN WHAT THEY'RE

1113
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
DOING.
THE SECURITY FORCES.

1114
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
THEY LEMPLED THE SKILLS THAT WE

1115
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
BRING TO SUPPORT THEM.
WHAT YOU SEE IS A GROWING

1116
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
NATIONALISM INSIDE OF IRAQ.

1117
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
THEY OWN THIS.

1118
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD

1119
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
THROW OUT IS WHAT I'VE SEEN ON

1120
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
THE GROUND IS THEY'VE BEEN

1121
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
COURAGEOUS, THEY'VE BEEN HEROIC

1122
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
IN THE FIGHT AND THE PEOPLE

1123
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
APPRECIATE WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO

1124
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
LIBERATE THEM.

1125
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
>> Shepard: I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT

1126
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
BEFORE, THE OTHER TIMES THAT WE

1127
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
HAVE ENGAGED OURSELVES WITH

1128
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
GENERALS OF YOUR ILK HAVE SAID

1129
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
OTHER THINGS.
THE POINT IS, AS YOU'VE WATCHED

1130
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THIS MATURE OVER TIME THE

1131
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
IRAQIES HAVE BEEN UP FRONT.

1132
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
WE ARE IN AN ADVISE AND ASSIST

1133
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
OPERATION.

1134
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
THAT'S HOW WE SUPPORT THEM.

1135
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
WHEN YOU COMBINE THE OPERATIONS

1136
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
WITH THE ASYMMETRIC FORCES OF

1137
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THEIR POWER, THEY ARE SUCCEEDING

1138
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
AND BRINGING IN FORCES THAT

1139
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
MAINTAIN THE STABILITY TO ALLOW

1140
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
GOVERNANCE TO OCCUR.

1141
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
>> Shepard: YOU TALK ABOUT IRAQI

1142
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
NATIONALISM, THAT'S HARD TO
FIND.

1143
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
THE KURDS MORE THAN EVER WANT

1144
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
OUT.

1145
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
THEY'RE ORGANIZING AND THEY

1146
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
DON'T WANT TO BE IRAQ, THEY WANT

1147
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
TO BE KURDISTAN.

1148
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
>> THE KURDISH REFERENDUM IS

1149
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
SOMETHING WE'RE ALL CONCERNED
ABOUT.

1150
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
POLITICALLY THAT WILL BE

1151
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO BE
SORTED OUT.

1152
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
FROM THE MILITARY PERSPECTIVE WE

1153
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
WANT TO ENSURE THEIR STABILITY

1154
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
AND SECURITY THAT FACILITATES

1155
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
POLITICAL PROGRESS TO BE MADE.

1156
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
>> Shepard: WILL THERE COME A

1157
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
TIME WHEN THEY CAN TAKE CARE OF

1158
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
THEMSELVES?
HOW WILL WE KNOW WHEN THAT IS?

1159
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
>> THAT'S THE PLAN.

1160
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
BUT WE HAVE TO ALLOW THAT TO

1161
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
TAKE TIME.

1162
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE FOR

1163
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
THAT TO OCCUR.

1164
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
WE WILL LAY OUT METRICS AS WE

1165
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THE

1166
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
CAMPAIGN, THAT WOULD LAY OUT

1167
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE

1168
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
TIME FOR US STARTING TO HAND

1169
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OVER THE RESPONSIBILITIES

1170
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
PARTICULARLY FROM A SUPPORT ON

1171
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
THE MILITARY SIDE PERSPECTIVE.

1172
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
>> Shepard: WE READ REPORTS THAT

1173
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
THE AIR FORCE DOESN'T HAVE

1174
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
ENOUGH BOMBS.

1175
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
AND WHATEVER YOU READ SOMETHING

1176
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
LIKE THAT AS A JOURNALIST, YOU

1177
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
THINK THEY WANT MORE FUNDING.

1178
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
WE ALSO WANT MORE FUNDING,
EVERYONE DOES.

1179
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
OR DO WE HAVE A CRITICAL BOMB

1180
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
SHORTAGE?
>> I'VE BEEN MANAGING THIS FROM

1181
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
THE DAY I TOOK COMMAND 15 MONTHS

1182
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
AGO.

1183
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
IT'S AN ISSUE WE HAVE WORKED

1184
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
THROUGH CLOSELY WITH THE AIR

1185
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
FORCE AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

1186
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
AND THERE'S A CONCERN OUT THERE,

1187
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
CLEARLY, AS YOU LOOK AT THE

1188
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
BUDGET AND ABILITY TO FORECAST

1189
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
LONG TERM, CONTINUING

1190
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
RESOLUTIONS DO NOT HELP OUR

1191
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
ABILITY TO PROCURE THE WEAPONS

1192
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
IN THE LONG TERM THAT WE NEED.

1193
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
>> Shepard: YOU NEED A BUDGET.

1194
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
>> THAT WOULD BE HELP.

1195
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
>> Shepard: HOW IS WASHINGTON
RESPONDING?

1196
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
>> I THINK THEY HEAR US BUT I'LL

1197
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
COME BACK TO THERE IS TALKING

1198
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
BUT WE NEED TO SEE ACTION TO GET

1199
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
THE BUDGET RESOLVED.

1200
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
>> Shepard: DOES THE LACK OF A

1201
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
BUDGET, JUST CONTINUING

1202
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
RESOLUTION, MAKE YOUR JOB AND

1203
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
THE MILITARY JOB HARDER?
>> IT CONCERNS ME.

1204
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
THE ANSWER TO THAT IN THE SHORT

1205
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
TERM IS YES.

1206
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
IT DRIVES US TO HAVE CHALLENGES

1207
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT

1208
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
HAVE TO DEAL WITH HAD THERE BEEN

1209
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
A BUDGET.
>> Shepard: YOU HAVE HAD

1210
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
PROBLEMS WITH SOME PLANES.

1211
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
THERE'S BEEN TALK OF TAKING THEM

1212
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
OUT OF THE THE MIX.
WHERE IS THAT?

1213
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE'VE

1214
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
BEEN ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THAT

1215
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
AND AS YOU LOOK AT THE RESOURCES

1216
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
THAT I HAVE, AVAILABLE TO ME,

1217
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXECUTE THE

1218
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
FIGHT EVERY DAY WITHOUT HAVING

1219
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE ASSETS

1220
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
BEING PULLED BACK.

1221
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
>> Shepard: WHEN YOU LOOK AT

1222
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH NORTH

1223
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
KOREA, THE BACK AND FORTH

1224
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
RHETORICALLY AND OTHERWISE,

1225
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
WHAT'S YOURS GREATEST CONCERN?

1226
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
>> WELL, I THINK AT THE END OF

1227
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
THE DAY ALL OF US ARE CONCERNED

1228
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
ABOUT THIS ESCALATING INTO

1229
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
SOMETHING THAT NO WOULD WANTS TO

1230
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
HAPPEN.
THAT IS OUT OF MY AREA OF

1231
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
RESPONSIBILITY.

1232
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
BUT AS AN AMERICAN, THERE IS A

1233
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
CONCERN THERE THAT I THINK WE

1234
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
ALL SHOULD BE WARY OF.

1235
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
AND HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A

1236
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION TO THIS

1237
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
PROBLEM.

1238
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
>> Shepard: WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT

1239
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
NIGHT?
>> WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY IN

1240
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
MY AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY, IS

1241
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRATEGIC

1242
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
MISCALCULATION.

1243
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
WE ARE NOT THERE TO FIGHT

1244
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
RUSSIA.
WE ARE NOT THERE TO FIGHT SYRIA.

1245
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
OUR JOB IS TO CRUSH ISIS AND

1246
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING EVERY

1247
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
DAY.
I WORRY THAT WE PUT OUR AIRMEN,

1248
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
OUR COALITION TEAM, IN A

1249
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
POSITION WHERE STRATEGIC

1250
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
MISCALCULATION COULD OCCUR.

1251
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING THIS

1252
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
DE-CONFLICT.

1253
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
>> Shepard: YOU USE THAT PHONE

1254
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
WITH THE RUSSIANS?

1255
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
>> I DON'T USE INTEREST BUT MY

1256
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
GUYS DO EVERY DAY.

1257
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
>> WHAT HAPPENS ON THAT PHONE?

1258
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
>> THE INTERESTING PART IS I

1259
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
HAVE SOME YOUNG AIRMEN THAT WE

1260
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
BRING IN, THAT ARE INTERPRETERS.

1261
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
SO WE'LL TALK, THEY'LL RESPOND

1262
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
AND OUR INTERPRETERS, THESE

1263
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
YOUNG AIRMEN, TRANSLATE FOR US.

1264
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
IT'S INCREDIBLE THE CONTEXT THAT

1265
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
THEY GIVE US WITH THEIR

1266
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RUSSIAN

1267
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
LAYMEN.

1268
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
IT'S FASCINATING, IT'S BEEN A

1269
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
LESSON IN LEADERSHIP AS WE WORK

1270
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000

I did.

1478
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I didn't pay for anything.

1479

You never do.

Are you serious?

1484
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Is that why
you don't like them?

1485
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Those boots could

1490
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You have type 2 diabetes,
right?

1491
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Yes.

1492
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So let me ask
you this...

1493
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
How does diabetes
affect your heart?

1494
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It doesn't, does it?

1495
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Actually, it does.

1496
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Type 2 diabetes

1497
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
can make you twice
as likely to die

1498
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
from a cardiovascular event,

1499
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
like a heart attack or stroke.

1500
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
And with heart disease,

1501
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
your risk is even higher.

1502
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You didn't know that.

1503
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
No.
Yeah.

1504
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But, wait, there's good news

1505
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000

type 2 diabetes

1506
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and heart disease.

1507
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
JARDIANCE is the only
type 2 diabetes pill

1508
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000

in adults who have type 2
diabetes and heart disease

1512
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000

to feel dizzy,

1516
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
faint, or lightheaded,

1517
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000

or an allergic reaction.

1527
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000

or insulin may cause
low blood sugar.

1540
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Tell your doctor about all
the medicines you take

1541
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and if you have any
medical conditions.

1542
