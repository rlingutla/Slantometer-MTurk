WHEN THINGS STARTED HITTING

119
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
THE HOUSE HARD ENOUGH TO

120
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SHAKE THE HOUSE.

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000

AND TOOK COVER UNDER THE

123
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000

WE HEARD THE STORM.

124
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
IT WENT RIGHT OVER US AND

125
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000

IT JUST LOOKED LIKE BOMBS

133
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000

436
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
OUT O.
SHE SAID THAT THE SCHOOL

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
FELL DOWN.

438
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000

SCRAPES AND SCRATCHES.

440
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

441
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

442
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
WHY IT HAPPENED TO US.

443
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
BUT SHE IS HAPPY THAT WE

444
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
ARE ALL FINE AND HER DOG IS

445
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000

WEARING A JACKET TODAY

458
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000

469
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
DO WE KNOW?

470
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
>> THERE IS A SMALL PIECE

471
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
OF GOOD NEWS, SHEP.

472

IF THERE IS ANY GOOD NEWS

473
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
IN THIS DISASTER.

474
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
IS THE FACT THAT FOR ABOUT

475
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
17 OR 18 HOURS IT WAS

476
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
BELIEVED AS MANY AS TWO

477
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
DOZEN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

478
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
TRAPPED IN PARISH IN

479
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
ADDITION TO THE SEVEN YOU

480
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
MENTIONED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

481
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
IT APPEARS NOW THAT WAS

482
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
SIMPLY THE FOG OF CONFUSION

483
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
FOLLOWING THE INITIAL

484
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
STRIKE OF THE TORNADO.

485
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
RESCUE WORKERS WENT THROUGH
A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A

486
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY AND
DID NOT FIND ANY MORE

487
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
VICTIMS.
THE DEATH TOLL HOLDING

488
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
STEADY NOW AT 24.

489
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
IT STILL COULD RISE BUT AT

490
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
LEAST WE BELIEVE NOW 24

491
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
ADDITIONAL CHILDREN DID NOT

492
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
DIE.

493
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
WE'RE ALSO LEARNING A

494
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT

495
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
HAPPENED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL

496
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
IN BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY

497
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
FROM AN A.P. STORY THAT

498
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
CAME OUT JUST A LITTLE

499
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
WHILE AGO.

500
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
AS THE STORM WARNINGS WENT

501
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
OUT, THOSE TORNADO WARNINGS

502
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
ALL THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN

503
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
OUT OF THEIR CLASSROOMS AT

504
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
PLAZA TOWER SENT TO THE

505
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
CALF FEAR I CAN'T TO WAIT

506
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
FOR THEIR PARENTS TO PICK

507
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
THEM UP.

508
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
BUT WHEN THE TORNADO SIRENS

509
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
WENT OFF SCHOOL OFFICIALS

510
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
SCRAMBLED TO GET THEM ALL

511
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
INTO THE HALLWAY AN AREA

512
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE A

513
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SAFE PLACE.

514
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
BUT ONE TEACHER AT PLAZA

515
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
TOWERS SAID THIS HALLWAY IS

516
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
NOT SAFE.

517
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
SHE GRABBED A BUNCH OF KIDS

518
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
AND TOOK THEM INTO THE

519
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
BATHROOM.

520
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
WHEN THE T. HIT THE

521
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
CHILDREN SURVIVED.

522
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
SIMILAR TORE THE CHILDREN

523
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
TOOK THEM INTO THE HALLWAY

524
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
IT'S NOT SAFE.

525
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
TOOK THEM A FEW OF THEM AND

526
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
WENT INTO THE CLOSET.

527
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

528
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
WHY NONE OF THE CHILDREN AT

529
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
BRIAR WOOD PERISHED.

530
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
WE SHOULD POINT OUT SHEP,

531
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
NEITHER BRIAR WOOD NOR

532
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
PLAZA TOWERS HAD ANY KIND

533
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
OF SAFE ROOM OR HARDENED

534

TORNADO SHELTER.

535
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
THE STUDENTS SIMPLY HAD THE

536
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
STRUCTURE TO PROTECT THEM.

537
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
WE SAW HOW WELL THAT DID

538
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
DURING THIS TORNADO.

539
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
>> Shepard: BECAUSE OF ALL

540
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
OF THAT JOHN, IT'S MY

541
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
UNDERSTANDING YOU MET A MAN

542
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
WHOSE DAUGHTER REALLY

543
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
DIDN'T TRUST THAT THE

544
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
SCHOOLS COULD BE SAFE IN

545
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THE STORM.

546
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
>> FELLOW WHO LIVES JUST

547
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
ACROSS THE STREET, HIS NAME

548
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
IS JIM GARNER.

549
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY

550
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
AFTERNOON HIS DAUGHTER, WHO

551
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
HAS FOUR KIDS AT PLAZA

552
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
TOWERS ELEMENTARY GOT A

553
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
HINKY FEELING ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING

554
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
TO HAPPEN.

555
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
HE PICKS UP THE TIME LINE

556
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
FROM THERE.

557
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
SHE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.

558
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
SHE HAD A BAD FEELING.

559
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
SO SHE WENT TO THE SCHOOL

560
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
AND PICKED MY GRAND KIDS UP

561
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
FROM SCHOOL.

562
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
>> WHAT TIME WAS THAT AT.

563
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
>> AROUND 2:00.

564
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
>>

565
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000

DEVELOPMENT.
AND THE PRESIDENT MADE

778
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
CLEAR THAT THE FULL FORCE

779
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000

TAKE A LISTEN.

783
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
>> NEIGHBORHOODS WERE

784
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
DESTROYED.

785
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
DOZENS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR

786
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000

MANY MORE WERE INJURED.

787
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
AND AMONG THE VICTIMS WERE

788
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
YOUNG CHILDREN TRYING TO

789
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000

PLACE THEY KNEW, THEIR

SCHOOL.
>> INTERESTING AS WELL

792
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
BECAUSE CRAIG FUGATE WAS

793
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
NOT IN THIS BRIEFING WITH

794
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
THE PRESIDENT ONLY BECAUSE

795
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY

796
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000

YET WHEN HE WILL GO.

805
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
BUT WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS

806
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
ARE SAYING PRIVATELY THAT

807
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
LIKELY GO AT SOME POINT BUT

808
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
RIGHT NOW PUBLICLY, THEY

809
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000

811
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000

DEAL WITH EVERYONE ON THE

816
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
GROUND.
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO

817
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
DO IS BRING THE PRESIDENT'S

818
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
SECURITY DETAIL IN AND

819
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
DISTRACT FROM ALL OF THAT,

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
SHEP.

821
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
WE WON'T SEE HIM FOR AT
LEAST A COUPLE DAYS.

822
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000

823
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
TAKE MUCH MORE TRAFFIC

824
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
CONGESTION HERE FOR SURE.

ED HENRY AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.

826
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY

827
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
STORIES OF FAMILIES WHO

OF THOSE SMALL SPACES AND

833
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
GOT A SENSE OF WHAT IT

834
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR

835
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
PEOPLE TO CLIMB BACK OUT

>> IN OKLAHOMA, THESE ARE

839
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
COMMON IN THE HOMES.

840
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
THEY ARE JUST A LITTLE

841
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000

LOOK AT THIS.

847
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
THIS IS THE GARAGE.

848
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHAT'S

849
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000

ALL AROUND.

852
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
THE FEAR IS SOME HOMES MAY

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
HAVE COLLAPSED ON TOP OF

854
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
THOSE STORM SHELTERS AND

855
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
THE FEAR IS SOME PEOPLE

856
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000

908
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The first time I saw a Sony 4k  TV,
it was like opening my eyes.  It's

909
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
four times the  detail of HD.

910
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Colors become richer.

911
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Details become clearer.

912
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Which for a filmmaker,  changes everything.

913
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Because now

914
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
there are no  more barriers between
the  world that I see

915
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and the ones I can show you.

916
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The Sony 4k Ultra HD TV.

917
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
WE REALLY WANTED TO TAKE  A RELAXING

918
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
TRIP TO FLORIDA.  YOU KNOW?  JUST

919
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
TO UNWIND.

920
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
BUT WE CAN ONLY AFFORD  ONE TRIP THIS

921
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
YEAR

922
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000

EVERYONE'S GOING.

925
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
THEN WE HEARD  ABOUT HOTWIRE...

926
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
AND REALIZED WE COULD ACTUALLY  AFFORD

927
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
TO TAKE BOTH TRIPS.

928
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000

THEY USE HOTWIRE TO FILL THEM.

931
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
SO WE GOT OUR FOUR STAR HOTELS  FOR
HALF PRICE.

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS.

991
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
>> Shepard: THAT WOMAN
SPENT THE DAY CLIMBING

992
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000

CASEY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING
THERE WHERE YOU ARE?

>> WELL, SHEPARD YOU KNOW,

1003
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
WHEN WE STARTED OUR DAY

1004
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
THIS MORNING IT WAS A

1005
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
MEMBER OF YOUR OWN TEAM WHO

1006
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
SAID HEY WHERE ARE YOU

1007
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
LOCATED?
I LOOKED AROUND AND I WAS

1008
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

1009
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
TO TELL THEM TO GO AND I

1010
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
REALIZED I WAS LOOKING IN

1011
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
THE WRONG SPOT TO TELL THEM

1012
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
WE WERE AT HEATHER LANE AND

1013
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
SOUTHWEST SIXTH STREET.

1014
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
SHEPARD, ON THE OUTSIDE

1015
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
TODAY WAS ABOUT SIFTING

1016
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
THROUGH THE RUBBLE IT WAS

1017
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
ABOUT PICKING THROUGH THE

1018
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
PIECES AND CLEANING UP.

1019
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT WAS

1020
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ALL

1021
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT HOPE.

1022
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
HOPE THAT MORE SURVIVORS

1023
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
WOULD BE FOUND AND HOPE

1024
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
THAT THE DEATH TOLL

1025
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
WOULDN'T RISE AND THAT IS

1026
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
EXACTLY EMBODIED RIGHT BACK

1027
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000

FLAG HANGING.

1031
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THE HOMEOWNER THERE SAYS

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
THAT HIS WIFE AND TWO

1033
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
CHILDREN RODE THE STORM OUT

1034
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000

THEY ARE OKAY.

1036
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
IN THERE I WASN'T THERE.

1168

AND RUSHING TO GET THERE.

1170
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'M SURE SHE WAS PRETTY

1171
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
SHAKEN UP.
SHE WAS SHAKEN UP WHEN I

PICTURES AND SOME CLOTHES

1186
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
COUNT IT AS A LOSS.

1187
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
>> WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO?

1188
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

1194
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
IT'S SOMETHING TO SEE.

1195
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE

1196
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
THAT BAD.

1197
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000

ARIAS GETS LIFE OR DEATH

1337
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
AFTER SHE REVEALED TODAY

1338
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
THAT SHE NO LONGER WANTS TO

1339
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
DIE OR SO SHE SAYS IS.

1340
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
SHE NOW SAYS SHE WANTS LIFE

1341
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
IN PRISON.

1342
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
>> UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, I

1343
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
COULD NOT HAVE MANAGED

1344
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
STANDING BEFORE YOU ALL AND

1345
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
ASKING YOU TO GIVE ME LIFE.

1346
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
TO ME, LIFE IN PRISON WAS

1347
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
THE MOST UNAPPEALING

1348
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
OUTCOME I COULD POSSIBLY

1349
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
THINK OF.

1350
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I THOUGHT I WOULD RATHER

1351
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
DIE.
BUT AS I STAND HERE NOW, I

1352
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE

1353
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
ASK TO YOU SENTENCE ME TO

1354
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
DEATH.
>> Shepard: OF COURSE

1355
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000

THE JURY FOUND HER GUILTY

1359
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
OF MURDER IN THE FIRST

00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000

00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
HER EX-BOYFRIEND 27 TIMES

1362
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
SHOT HIM AND SLIT HIS

1363
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
THROAT.

1364
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
AT THAT TIME SHE CALLED
DEATH THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM

1365
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
BUT TODAY SHE TOLD THE JURY

1366
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
SHE HAS MORE PERSPECTIVE

1367
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
NOW ABOUT THE POSITIVE

1368
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
CHANGE SHE CAN MAKE IN

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
THIS IS THE T-SHIRT.

1373
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000

IS OTHER VICTIMS OF

1376
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

1377
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
>> Shepard: REMEMBER AREAS

1378
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
AND THE DEFENSE DID NOT

1379
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
PRESENT MUCH EVIDENCE TO

1380
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
SUPPORT THE CLAIM THAT SHE

1381
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
HERSELF WAS A VICTIM OF

1382
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL

1383
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
EVIDENCE AT ALL.

1384
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
TODAY SHE SAID THAT PEOPLE

1385
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
THAT DON'T BELIEVE HER ARE

1386
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINIONS.

THESE DELIBERATIONS DIDN'T

1425
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
MOST OF IT HAS COME FROM

1426
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
THE DEFENDANT'S MOUTH.

1427
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL

>> YEAH, SHE SAID THAT IF

1447
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
SHE ASKED FOR THE DEATH

1448
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
PENALTY IT WOULD BE LIKE

1449
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
COMMITTING SUICIDE AND THAT

1450
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL

1451
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
FOR HER FAMILY AND SHE SAYS

1452
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
HER FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH

1453
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
ENOUGH PAIN.

MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

1462
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER

DONE.

1464
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
IT'S THE WORST THING I EVER

1465
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
COULD HAVE SEEN MYSELF

1466
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
DOING.
IN FACT, I COULDN'T SEE

1467
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
MYSELF DOING IT BEFORE THAT

1468
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
DAY I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT TO
