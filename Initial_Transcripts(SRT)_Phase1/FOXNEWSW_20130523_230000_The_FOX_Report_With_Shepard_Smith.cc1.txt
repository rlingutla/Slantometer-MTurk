[000:00:00;08] LACK AT THAT FINALLY PUTS  
[000:00:01;11] HIS HANDS UP.  
[000:00:02;03] THAT WAS GOOD.  
[000:00:03;00] THANKS FOR INVITING US INTO  
[000:00:04;09] YOUR HOME TONIGHT.  
[000:00:05;06] THAT IS IT FOR THIS  
[000:00:06;05] "SPECIAL REPORT."  
[000:00:07;03] FAIR, BALANCED AND STILL  
[000:00:08;27] UNAFRAID.  
[000:00:17;04] >> Shepard: THIS IS THE FOX  
[000:00:18;00] REPORT.  
[000:00:18;14] TONIGHT, THE JODI ARIAS  
[000:00:20;02] JURY WORKING ON A LIFE OR  
[000:00:23;16] DEATH DECISION.  
[000:00:24;13] THE JURORS SAY THEY HAVE  
[000:00:25;12] ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE  
[000:00:26;11] CASE.  
[000:00:26;24] PLUS, WHEN IS IT OKAY FOR  
[000:00:29;01] OUR GOVERNMENT TO KILL OUR  
[000:00:32;16] PEOPLE?  
[000:00:33;00] PRESIDENT OBAMA LAYING OUT  
[000:00:34;07] HIS POLICY.  
[000:00:36;19] >> TECHNOLOGY RAISES  
[000:00:38;02] PROFOUND QUESTIONS.  
[000:00:39;07] >> DRONES HAVE BECOME A  
[000:00:40;13] MAJOR PART OF COUNTER  
[000:00:44;14] TERRORISM.  
[000:00:45;00] FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES  
[000:00:46;22] AWAY OPERATORS CAN PULL THE  
[000:00:48;03] TRIGGER AND TAKE OUT A  
[000:00:49;04] TARGET.  
[000:00:50;11] BUT WHAT ARE THE ACTUAL  
[000:00:52;02] RULES FOR KILLING ENEMY OR  
[000:00:54;25] KILLING AMERICANS?  
[000:00:55;25] >> THE TARGETING OF ANY  
[000:00:57;06] AMERICAN RAISES  
[000:00:58;11] CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT  
[000:00:59;06] ARE NOT PRESENT IN OTHER  
[000:01:00;20] STRIKES.  
[000:01:01;16] >> TONIGHT, PRESIDENT OBAMA  
[000:01:03;07] ON OUR MACHINES OF WAR.  
[000:01:06;24] ATTACK ON THE STREETS OF  
[000:01:08;18] LONDON.  
[000:01:09;02] TWO MEN ACCUSED OF HACKING  
[000:01:10;00] A SOLDIER TO DEATH WITH  
[000:01:12;04] BUTCHER KNIVES AND A  
[000:01:13;27] MACHETE.  
[000:01:14;12] NOW YOU WILL MEET THE HERO  
[000:01:15;21] MOTHER WHO CONFRONTED THE  
[000:01:18;13] SUSPECTS SECONDS AFTER IT  
[000:01:19;11] ALL WENT DOWN.  
[000:01:21;06] >> I OKAY OBVIOUSLY A BIT  
[000:01:25;23] EXCITED.  
[000:01:26;08] >> Trace: PLUS REPORTS THAT  
[000:01:27;03] SECURITY FORCES HAD  
[000:01:27;24] INVESTIGATED THESE GUYS IN  
[000:01:28;18] THE PAST.  
[000:01:29;16] AND AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN  
[000:01:31;22] BECOME THE OLDEST TO REACH  
[000:01:32;29] THE TOP OF THE WORLD BUT  
[000:01:36;23] SOMEBODY ELSE COULD BREAK  
[000:01:38;02] HIS RECORD WITHIN DAYS.  
[000:01:39;15] TONIGHT BATTLE ATOP MOUNT  
[000:01:41;01] EVERY REST.  
[000:01:43;25] >> Shepard: BUT FIRST FROM  
[000:01:44;19] FOX THIS THURSDAY NIGHT THE  
[000:01:45;19] PRESIDENT IS RULING OUT THE  
[000:01:46;24] DRONING OF AMERICANS IN  
[000:01:48;02] AMERICA ONCE AND FOREALL.  
[000:01:50;04] AND SPELLING OUT THE RULES  
[000:01:51;23] FOR DRONE STRIKES TO TAKE  
[000:01:53;16] OUT TERRORIST SUSPECTS  
[000:01:54;21] INCLUDING U.S. CITIZENS  
[000:01:56;22] OVERSEAS.  
[000:01:57;08] PRESIDENT OBAMA ALSO  
[000:01:57;29] CALLING FOR NEW STEPS TO  
[000:01:58;27] SHUT DOWN THE PRISON AT  
[000:02:00;14] GUANTANAMO BAY AT LAST AND  
[000:02:02;02] BRING SOME DETAINEES HERE  
[000:02:03;10] TO THE UNITED STATES.  
[000:02:05;08] >> GIVEN MY  
[000:02:06;23] ADMINISTRATION'S RELENTLESS  
[000:02:07;17] PURSUIT OF AL QAEDA'S  
[000:02:09;11] LEADERSHIP, THERE IS NO  
[000:02:11;02] JUSTIFICATION BEYOND  
[000:02:12;03] POLITICS FOR CONGRESS TO  
[000:02:13;05] PREVENT US FROM CLOSING A  
[000:02:16;00] FACILITY THAT SHOULD HAVE  
[000:02:16;27] NEVER BEEN OPENED.  
[000:02:17;19] >> THE JUSTIFICATION FOR  
[000:02:18;20] CLOSING GITMO IS THAT WE  
[000:02:19;27] DESTROYED THE AL QAEDA  
[000:02:22;21] LEADERSHIP RELENTLESS IN  
[000:02:23;16] OUR PURSUIT OF TERRORISTS.  
[000:02:25;07] THAT IS NOT A GOOD  
[000:02:26;02] JUSTIFICATION BECAUSE THAT  
[000:02:26;27] IS NOT TRUE.  
[000:02:27;14] THE REASON WE HAVEN'T  
[000:02:28;11] CLOSED GUANTANAMO BAY IS WE  
[000:02:29;16] DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO CLOSE  
[000:02:30;20] IT.  
[000:02:31;03] YOU NEED A PLAN.  
[000:02:34;28] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT ALSO  
[000:02:35;21] HEARD REACTION TO HIS PLANS  
[000:02:36;15] DURING HIS SPEECH AT THE  
[000:02:37;24] NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY  
[000:02:38;20] IN WASHINGTON.  
[000:02:39;07] I HAD HENRY IS ON FOX TOP  
[000:02:41;01] STORY LIVE AT THE WHITE  
[000:02:41;24] HOUSE TONIGHT.  
[000:02:42;12] ED HE IS TALKING ABOUT, I  
[000:02:43;20] GUESS, IN ESSENCE SCALING  
[000:02:45;01] BACK THE WAR ON TERROR?  
[000:02:45;28] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:02:46;17] HE IS NOT EVEN REALLY USING  
[000:02:48;22] THE PHRASE WAR ON TERROR  
[000:02:50;07] ANYMORE.  
[000:02:50;22] SAYS THAT WHAT WE CALLED  
[000:02:51;17] THE WAR ON TERROR IT  
[000:02:53;05] BECOMES SELF-DEFEATING IN  
[000:02:53;28] HIS WORDS TO CONSTANTLY BE  
[000:02:55;10] ON A WAR FOOTING.  
[000:02:56;20] HE BELIEVES WE HAVE GOT TO  
[000:02:57;26] CHANGE OUR TOOLS, GOT TO  
[000:02:58;28] COME UP WITH A BETTER LEGAL  
[000:03:00;20] FRAMEWORK TO EXPLAIN TO THE  
[000:03:01;22] PUBLIC EXACTLY HOW WE'RE  
[000:03:03;15] USING THESE TOOLS TO FIND  
[000:03:05;20] TERROR.  
[000:03:06;20] SPECIFICALLY, HE IS  
[000:03:07;10] STARTING WITH TRYING TO  
[000:03:08;04] FINALLY MAKE GOOD ON THAT  
[000:03:09;09] FAILED PROMISE FROM HIS  
[000:03:10;10] FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE HERE  
[000:03:12;01] TO CLOSE THE U.S. MILITARY  
[000:03:13;28] PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY.  
[000:03:15;00] YOU MENTIONED THAT HE HAD  
[000:03:16;16] GOT SOME DIRECT FEEDBACK ON  
[000:03:17;28] THAT.  
[000:03:18;11] IT CAME FROM A HECKLER AT  
[000:03:20;01] CODE PINK WHO LET THE  
[000:03:20;28] PRESIDENT HAVE IT ABOUT  
[000:03:22;08] THAT HUNGER STRIKE THAT'S  
[000:03:23;16] GOING ON AT GUANTANAMO  
[000:03:25;02] RIGHT NOW.  
[000:03:25;19] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:03:26;23] >> I'M ABOUT.  
[000:03:27;28] >> YOU ARE COMMANDER AND  
[000:03:28;29] CHIEF.  
[000:03:29;13] >> LET ME.  
[000:03:30;03] >> YOU CAN CLOSE GAHANNA  
[000:03:34;03] TAN TODAY.  
[000:03:34;19] >> THANK YOU.  
[000:03:35;06] YOU SHOULD LET ME FINISH MY  
[000:03:37;12] SENTENCE.  
[000:03:39;04] TODAY.  
[000:03:39;17] I ONCE AGAIN CALL ON  
[000:03:40;13] CONGRESS TO LIFT THE  
[000:03:43;21] RESTRICTIONS ON DETAINEE  
[000:03:47;10] TRANSFERS TO GITMO.  
[000:03:48;24] [ APPLAUSE ]  
[000:03:49;11] >> I HAVE ASKED THE  
[000:03:50;05] DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO  
[000:03:52;22] DESIGNATE A SITE IN THE  
[000:03:53;15] UNITED STATES WHERE WE CAN  
[000:03:54;27] HOLD MILITARY COMMISSIONS.  
[000:03:56;13] >> REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN  
[000:03:57;24] MCCAIN TONIGHT SAYING HE  
[000:03:58;24] WILL WORK WITH THE  
[000:03:59;23] PRESIDENT TO TRY TO MAKE  
[000:04:00;22] THAT HAPPEN.  
[000:04:01;08] BUT THAT HE BELIEVES THE  
[000:04:02;04] PRESIDENT STILL HASN'T  
[000:04:02;27] GIVEN A CLEAR PLAN ABOUT  
[000:04:04;06] HOW TO FOLLOW UP ON ALL OF  
[000:04:06;00] THAT.  
[000:04:06;13] AND THAT'S THE REAL REASON  
[000:04:07;12] WHY CONGRESS HASN'T MOVED  
[000:04:08;07] ON IT, SHEP.  
[000:04:10;02] >> Shepard: ED, WE GOT A  
[000:04:10;24] LOT OF DETAIL BRAND NEW  
[000:04:12;10] DETAIL ON THE DRONE  
[000:04:13;03] PROGRAM.  
[000:04:14;21] >> AND UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT  
[000:04:16;10] OF DETAIL THE PRESIDENT  
[000:04:17;05] LAYING OUT AND ADMITTING  
[000:04:18;24] THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  
[000:04:19;18] HAS SKILLED AT LEAST FOUR  
[000:04:21;06] AMERICANS SINCE 2009.  
[000:04:23;27] OVERSEAS.  
[000:04:24;12] ONE OF ONLY ONE OF THEM  
[000:04:26;02] ANWAR AL AWLAKI WAS  
[000:04:27;01] ACTUALLY TARGETED.  
[000:04:27;26] THE OTHER THREE WERE TAKEN  
[000:04:29;26] OUT AS PART OF OTHER  
[000:04:31;28] OPERATIONS.  
[000:04:32;14] NOT DIRECTLY TARGETED.  
[000:04:33;23] THE PRESIDENT BASICALLY  
[000:04:34;29] SAID THAT HE WANTS TO LAY  
[000:04:35;28] OUT A LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO  
[000:04:37;10] MAKE SURE THAT WE LIMIT  
[000:04:39;23] CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WHEN WE  
[000:04:40;18] USE THE DRONES.  
[000:04:41;18] REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THEY  
[000:04:42;12] WANT TO SEE MORE DETAILS ON  
[000:04:43;25] THAT AS WELL.  
[000:04:44;14] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:04:45;08] >> BEFORE ANY STRIKE IS  
[000:04:47;08] TAKEN, THERE MUST BE NEAR  
[000:04:48;24] CERTAINTY THAT NO CIVILIANS  
[000:04:50;07] WILL BE KILLED OR INJURED.  
[000:04:52;08] THE HIGHEST STANDARD WE CAN  
[000:04:54;14] SET.  
[000:04:54;27] >> WHAT I THINK CONGRESS  
[000:04:56;26] MUST DEMAND OF THE  
[000:05:01;21] ADMINISTRATION IS THE LEGAL  
[000:05:04;17] RATIONALE.  
[000:05:05;02] PROMPT NOTIFICATIONS WHEN  
[000:05:06;04] THERE IS A LETHAL ACTION OR  
[000:05:08;28] CAPTURE SITUATION OUTSIDE  
[000:05:09;21] OF AFGHANISTAN.  
[000:05:10;10] >> TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE  
[000:05:11;12] CONCERNS, THE PRESIDENT  
[000:05:12;05] SAYING IS HE LARGELY MOVING  
[000:05:13;15] KEY PARTS OF THE DRONE  
[000:05:14;17] PROGRAM FROM THE CIA'S  
[000:05:15;19] CONTROL TO THE PENTAGON'S  
[000:05:17;03] CONTROL.  
[000:05:17;18] HE THINKS THAT WILL BE A  
[000:05:18;13] BIT MORE TRANSPARENT, SHEP.  
[000:05:20;25] >> Shepard: ED, THE  
[000:05:21;15] PRESIDENT SAYS HE ALSO  
[000:05:22;08] BELIEVES THAT JOURNALISTS  
[000:05:23;02] SHOULD NOT FACE LEGAL  
[000:05:23;23] ACTION FOR DOING THEIR JOBS  
[000:05:25;06] IF THEY END UP IN THE  
[000:05:27;05] MIDDLE OF LEAK  
[000:05:28;06] INVESTIGATIONS.  
[000:05:28;24] TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT SAYS  
[000:05:30;06] IS DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT  
[000:05:31;06] THAT IS COMING UP IN DETAIL  
[000:05:32;20] INSIDE FOX REPORT.  
[000:05:33;23] BUT, FIRST, POLICE HAVE NOT  
[000:05:35;09] ARRESTED MORE PEOPLE AFTER  
[000:05:37;00] THAT BRUTAL KNIFE ATTACK ON  
[000:05:38;01] THE STREETS OF LONDON.  
[000:05:39;14] ONE THAT LEFT A SOLDIER  
[000:05:40;21] DEAD AND BEHEADED IN THE  
[000:05:42;28] STREET.  
[000:05:43;12] AND NOW A WOMAN WHO  
[000:05:44;04] CONFRONTED THE TWO MEN  
[000:05:45;05] ACCUSED OF HACKING THAT  
[000:05:46;18] SOLDIER SAYS SHE WAS JUST  
[000:05:47;21] TRYING TO KEEP THEM CALM.  
[000:05:49;18] AND STOP THEM FROM HURTING  
[000:05:50;27] ANYBODY ELSE.  
[000:05:51;16] AT LEAST ONE OF THE MEN WAS  
[000:05:53;07] STILL CARRYING BUTCHER  
[000:05:54;20] KNIVES.  
[000:05:55;04] HIS HANDS DRIPPING WITH  
[000:05:56;06] BLOOD AFTER WITNESSES SAY  
[000:05:57;10] HE AND ANOTHER MAN CARVED  
[000:05:59;10] UP AN OFF DUTY BRITISH  
[000:06:01;11] SOLDIER.  
[000:06:01;26] HE THEN STARTED RANTING  
[000:06:02;19] ABOUT THE BRITISH  
[000:06:03;09] GOVERNMENT AND ITS TROOPS  
[000:06:04;13] IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  
[000:06:05;25] HOW THIS ATTACK IS PAY BACK  
[000:06:07;24] FOR THE DEATHS OF MUSLIMS.  
[000:06:09;11] THE WOMAN WHO WENT WITH UP  
[000:06:10;06] TO THE MEN IS A SCOUT  
[000:06:11;11] LEADER AND A MOTHER AND SHE  
[000:06:14;07] SAYS SHE WAS MORE WORRIED  
[000:06:15;07] ABOUT OTHERS THAN HER OWN  
[000:06:16;29] SAFETY.  
[000:06:17;13] >> WERE YOU NOT SCARED FOR  
[000:06:18;08] YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION?  
[000:06:19;06] >> NO.  
[000:06:19;19] >> WHY NOT?  
[000:06:22;29] >> BETTER ME THAN A CHILD.  
[000:06:26;01] BECAUSE, UNFORTUNATELY MORE  
[000:06:27;11] MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN  
[000:06:28;18] STOPPING AROUND.  
[000:06:29;13] MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT.  
[000:06:30;11] I TALKED TO HIM AND THEN I  
[000:06:33;07] ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED.  
[000:06:34;15] >> REASONING WITH AN  
[000:06:35;19] APPARENT MAD MAN.  
[000:06:36;14] IT WORKED UNTIL POLICE  
[000:06:37;16] ARRIVED AND SHOT AND  
[000:06:38;24] WOUNDED BOTH MEN.  
[000:06:39;22] AND JUST HOURS AGO WORD OF  
[000:06:41;08] BRAND NEW ARRESTS TWO MORE  
[000:06:42;21] PEOPLE ARE IN CUSTODY AS

[000:07:13;18] WITH RADICAL ISLAM.  
[000:07:14;20] ONE OF THE SUSPECTS WE ARE

[000:07:24;17] EARLIER.  
[000:07:25;02] THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO  
[000:07:25;25] FIGURE OUT WHETHER THERE  
[000:07:26;18] WAS A JIHADI NETWORK  
[000:07:27;26] BACKING UP THE SUSPECTED  
[000:07:29;09] KILLERS OR WHETHER THEY  
[000:07:31;05] ACTED ON THEIR OWN.

[000:08:32;25] OUR 401(K)'S TOOK A BEATING  
[000:08:34;07] THIS MORNING BUT BY THE  
[000:08:35;11] AFTERNOON TRADERS WERE ABLE  
[000:08:36;06] TO MAKE UP SOME BUT NOT ALL  
[000:08:37;23] OF THE GROUND THEY LOST.  
[000:08:39;01] STOCKS FIRST WENT NEGATIVE  
[000:08:40;10] AFTER A SURPRISINGLY WEAK  
[000:08:43;05] REPORT ON THE CHINESE  
[000:08:44;10] FACTORY OUTPUT.

[000:08:58;14] DOWN TO 340,000, A LEVEL  
[000:09:00;05] THAT ANALYSTS SUGGEST SOLID  
[000:09:02;03] JOB GROWTH.  
[000:09:03;16] SO BY THE END OF THE  
[000:09:04;11] TRADING SESSION THE DOW WAS  
[000:09:05;24] OFF BUT 13 AND NASDAQ DOWN  
[000:09:08;00] 4.  
[000:09:08;11] THE S&P 500 LOST 5.  
[000:09:10;21] DEAD LOCK DRAMA AS WE AWAIT  
[000:09:12;18] THE JURY'S DECISION IN THE  
[000:09:14;04] JODI ARIAS CASE.  
[000:09:15;03] WHAT HAPPENS IF THE JURORS  
[000:09:16;04] CANNOT AGREE ABOUT WHETHER  
[000:09:17;26] JODI ARIAS SHOULD LIVE OR  
[000:09:18;29] DIE FOR HER CRIME?

[000:12:46;11] END THE PLAN OF OPENLY GAY  
[000:12:47;05] BOYS IN THE SCOUTS.  
[000:12:47;25] A RESTRICTION THAT HAD BEEN  
[000:12:48;21] IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE  
[000:12:50;05] 103--YEAR-OLD  
[000:12:50;26] ORGANIZATION'S HISTORY.  
[000:12:51;25] 1400 MEMBERS OF THE GROUP'S  
[000:12:53;19] NATIONAL COUNCIL GATHERED  
[000:12:54;12] IN TEXAS TO VOTE ON THIS  
[000:12:56;22] PROPOSAL.  
[000:12:57;15] THE REVERSAL DOES NOT  
[000:12:58;22] REMOVE THE BAN ON GAY ADULT  
[000:13:04;18] LEADERS THREE DAYS OF  
[000:13:06;03] DELIBERATION AND THE JURY  
[000:13:06;29] HAS NOT DECIDED WHETHE"K  EI-   JODI
[000:13:08;19] ARIAS LIVES OR DIE.  
[000:13:09;20] IN THE LAST HOUR WE LEARNED  
[000:13:12;09] WHETHER ASKED ANOTHER  
[000:13:15;10] QUESTION.  
[000:13:15;25] 15 HOURS FOUR DAYS TO  
[000:13:17;04] CONVICT JODI ARIAS OF  
[000:13:18;14] HEARDED IN THE FIRST DEGREE  
[000:13:19;27] FOR SHOOTING EX-BOYFRIEND  
[000:13:20;28] IN THE HEAD.  
[000:13:21;26] STABBING HIM 27 TIMES AND  
[000:13:23;08] SOLICITING HIM IN THE  
[000:13:24;04] THROAT.  
[000:13:24;18] KEEP IN MIND JODI ARIAS  
[000:13:25;29] LARGELY CHAINED HER TUNE  
[000:13:27;00] EARLIER THIS WEEK IN HER  
[000:13:28;05] SPEECH TO THE JURY.  
[000:13:28;26] SHE SAID THAT SHE NO LONGER  
[000:13:30;28] WANTED THE DEATH PENALTY  
[000:13:32;02] AND PROMISED TO BRING ON  
[000:13:33;17] POSITIVE CHANGE FROM PRISON  
[000:13:34;18] BY TEACHING INMATES HOW TO  
[000:13:35;27] READ AND SPEAK SPANISH,  
[000:13:38;02] EVEN STARTING A NEW  
[000:13:39;29] RECYCLING PROGRAM AMONG  
[000:13:40;21] OTHER THINGS.  
[000:13:41;11] TRACE GALLAGHER LIVE IN OUR  
[000:13:43;00] WEST COAST NEWSROOM FOR US  
[000:13:44;06] THIS AFTERNOON.  
[000:13:44;24] ANY MORE MOVEMENT FROM THE  
[000:13:46;00] COURTHOUSE TRACE?  
[000:13:46;24] >> CERTAINLY THE MOST WE  
[000:13:48;19] HAVE SEEN ALLSñ DAY SHEP.  
[000:13:50;10] THE COURT REPORTER GOT  
[000:13:51;11] SUMMONSED TO COURT ALONG  
[000:13:52;09] WITH THE HEAD OF SECURITY  
[000:13:53;07] AND THE FAMILY OF TRAVIS  
[000:13:55;11] ALEXANDER BEGAN STREAMING  
[000:13:56;18] IN.  
[000:13:57;00] WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE  
[000:13:58;16] JURY QUESTION YOU TALKED  
[000:13:59;23] ABOUT.  
[000:14:00;07] THEY ARE STILL IN AROUND  
[000:14:01;01] AROUND THE COURTROOM.  
[000:14:01;23] THERE COULD BE MORE GOING  
[000:14:02;17] ON HERE THAT WOULD HAVE  
[000:14:03;25] BEEN BY THE WAY, THE  
[000:14:05;07] SECOND COURT QUESTION FROM  
[000:14:06;01] THE DAY FROM THE JURY.  
[000:14:07;18] AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SEALED  
[000:14:08;20] THEY WON'T EXACTLY TELL US  
[000:14:09;20] WHAT THE JURY WANTS.  
[000:14:10;24] KEEP IN MIND THE JURY SO  
[000:14:12;06] FAR HAS DELIBERATED ABOUT  
[000:14:14;03] 13 HOURS DURING THE PENALTY  
[000:14:15;17] PHASE.  
[000:14:16;00] THEY ONLY DELIBERATED 15  
[000:14:18;00] HOURS DURING THE GUILT OR  
[000:14:19;20] INNOCENCE PHASE.  
[000:14:20;21] AND BECAUSE ALL OF THE  
[000:14:22;14] MAJOR PLAYERS ARE ON SCENE,  
[000:14:24;15] IF THERE IS A VERDICT  
[000:14:25;28] SOMETIME IN THE NEXT 15 OR  
[000:14:27;21] 20 MINUTES SHEP, IT IS  
[000:14:29;13] LIKELY IT WOULD BE READ  
[000:14:31;18] RELATIVELY QUICKLY.  
[000:14:33;04] >> Shepard: IF THERE IS NOT  
[000:14:33;28] A VERDICT, TRACE.  
[000:14:34;21] I'M HEARING THAT THIS JURY  
[000:14:35;24] MAY TAKE A LONG WEEKEND; IS  
[000:14:37;05] THAT RIGHT?  
[000:14:38;03] >> YEAH.  
[000:14:38;17] YOU COULD BE RIGHT SHEP.  
[000:14:40;04] NORMALLY THEY FINISH  
[000:14:41;04] DELIBERATIONS AT ABOUT 4:30  
[000:14:42;23] LOCAL TIME.  
[000:14:43;19] ABOUT 15 MINUTES FROM NOW.  
[000:14:45;01] NORMALLY THERE IS NO COURT  
[000:14:46;01] ON FRIDAY.  
[000:14:46;23] THEN, OF COURSE MONDAY IS  
[000:14:48;05] A HOLIDAY BUT NOW WE ARE  
[000:14:49;15] HEARING FROM THE COURT THEY  
[000:14:50;19] COULD GO AS LONGoT3 AS  
[000:14:52;28] WEDNESDAY BEFORE THEY  
[000:14:54;09] ACTUALLY COME BACK IN FOR  
[000:14:56;10] DELIBERATIONS.  
[000:14:56;28] FIVE DAYS.  
[000:14:57;14] A LONG WAIT FOR JODI ARIAS.  
[000:14:58;28] NOW, REMEMBER IF THEY ARE  
[000:15:00;28] HOPELESSLY DEADLOCKED, THE  
[000:15:02;18] COURT REALLY HAS JUST TWO  
[000:15:04;04] OPTIONS.  
[000:15:04;18] ONE, THEY CAN EITHER  
[000:15:06;00] IMPANEL A BRAND NEW JURY  
[000:15:07;15] AND RETRY PART OF THE  
[000:15:08;16] PENALTY PHASE OR, TWO,  
[000:15:10;07] PROSECUTORS COULD AGREE TO  
[000:15:11;20] WAIVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND  
[000:15:13;10] AGREE TO LIFE IN PRISON.  
[000:15:17;03] JODI ARIAS THINKS LIFE IN  
[000:15:18;14] PRISON WOULD BE LESS OF A  
[000:15:19;20] BURDEN ON THE LEGAL SYSTEM.  
[000:15:20;24] HERE SHE IS.  
[000:15:25;19] I DON'T THINK IT WILL GIVE  
[000:15:26;23] CLOSURE TO ANYONE.  
[000:15:27;25] IF I GET A DEATH VERDICT IT  
[000:15:29;29] WILL DRAG OAND ON AND ON IN  
[000:15:32;11] APPELLATE COURTS FOR YEARS  
[000:15:33;18] INSTEAD OF GETTING IT DONE  
[000:15:35;11] INSTEAD OF SENDING ME OFF  
[000:15:36;20] TO PRISON AND FORGETTING  
[000:15:37;27] ABOUT ME.  
[000:15:38;18] >> THE MEDIA HAS BEEN LET

[000:15:43;02] COURTROOM AS WELL AS ALL OF  
[000:15:43;27] THE ATTORNEYS.  
[000:15:44;15] WE DO DOO NOT KNOW IF THAT  
[000:15:45;23] IS PART OF THAT QUESTION WE  
[000:15:46;28] MENTIONED EARLIER BUT ALL  
[000:15:48;02] OF THE PLAYERS ARE NOW IN  
[000:15:49;04] THE COURTHOUSE.  
[000:15:50;01] WE AWAITING WORD FOR WHAT  
[000:15:51;11] IS GOING ON.  
[000:15:52;06] WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE  
[000:15:53;04] UNTIL THE JURY GOES HOME.   MOVEMENT,
[000:15:55;08] WE  
[000:15:55;19] WILL JUMP BACK IN.

[000:16:01;00] A LOT OF FOLKS POINTED OUT  
[000:16:02;18] JODI ARIAS LOOKED PRETTY  
[000:16:04;05] GOOD DURING THE INTERVIEWS  
[000:16:05;10] EARLIER THIS WEEKS.

[000:16:12;14] FOLKSED HIM IF HE PLAYED A

[000:16:39;11] >> WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND AT  
[000:16:40;07] THE EXTENT OF THE  
[000:16:41;13] DESTRUCTION IN THIS SCHOOL  
[000:16:42;11] THE SHOCKING THING IS NOT  
[000:16:44;15] THAT SOME CHILDREN DID NOT  
[000:16:46;16] SURVIVE BUT THAT SO MANY  
[000:16:49;14] DID

[000:19:57;28] EXTENSIVE LOOK AT WHAT'S  
[000:19:59;19] LEFT INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.  
[000:20:01;02] SHE IS LIVE ON THE SCHOOL  
[000:20:02;03] GROUNDS FOR US THIS  
[000:20:03;17] EVENING.  
[000:20:04;02] JONATHAN?  
[000:20:04;17] >> SHEP, IT IS A STUNNING  
[000:20:05;28] VISION OF UTTER DESTRUCTION  
[000:20:08;14] AND EVERYWHERE THERE ARE  
[000:20:10;11] POIGNANT REMINDERS THAT  
[000:20:11;08] THIS WAS A PLACE THAT  
[000:20:12;11] CHILDREN WENT TO BE SAFE  
[000:20:14;06] AND WENT TO LEARN.  
[000:20:15;25] WE SAW LAYING ON THE FLOOR  
[000:20:17;12] A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES.  
[000:20:19;17] WE SAW CHILDREN'S BOOKS  
[000:20:21;27] SCATTERED AMONG THE RUBBLE.  
[000:20:23;23] WE ALSO SAW SOME BOOKS  
[000:20:25;29] STILL UNTOUCHED, STANDING  
[000:20:27;02] ON A BOOK SHELF THAT WAS IN  
[000:20:30;04] CON CON GREWOUSLY UPRIGHT.  
[000:20:32;08] WE SAW SCHOOLWORK STILL ON  
[000:20:33;19] THEIR DESKS, TRAGICALLY, OF  
[000:20:36;17] COURSE SEVEN CHILDREN DIED  
[000:20:37;16] HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS  
[000:20:40;26] ELEMENTARY MIRACULOUSLY  
[000:20:43;09] MANY MORE SURVIVED.  
[000:20:44;10] >> THIS SEVERE WEATHER  
[000:20:45;04] FRONT WALL OF THE SCHOOL  
[000:20:48;29] WAS.  
[000:20:49;11] >> THIS WAS WHERE THE FRONT  
[000:20:51;19] HALL OF THE SCHOOL WAS.  
[000:20:53;04] CLASSROOMS ON EACH SIDE.  
[000:20:54;05] THESE CLASSROOMS ARE NO  
[000:20:55;04] LONGER HERE.  
[000:20:55;25] THESE CLASSROOMS ARE.  
[000:20:56;21] THIS IS WHERE SOME STUDENTS  
[000:20:58;26] WERE SENT.  
[000:20:59;19] THIS IS A SAFE AREA IN THE  
[000:21:01;14] HALLWAY.  
[000:21:01;28] THERE WERE STUDENTS IN THE  
[000:21:06;20] HALLWAY THEY TAKE THEIR  
[000:21:09;20] CROUCHING DOWN POSITION.  
[000:21:10;12] THE KIDS IN THIS HALLWAY  
[000:21:11;13] ALL SURVIVED?  
[000:21:12;05] >> YES THE KITCHEN AREA  
[000:21:13;11] BACK THERE WHERE THE ROOF  
[000:21:14;15] IS CAVED IN THIS IS  
[000:21:19;19] ACTUALLY THE GYM AREA OVER  
[000:21:20;20] THERE THAT WAS 35-FOOT TALL  
[000:21:23;05] BUILDING THE GYMNASIUM.  
[000:21:24;14] THE ROOF BASICALLY  
[000:21:26;20] DEFINITELY AN AREA THAT WE  
[000:21:27;18] YOU KNOW, WANT TO AVOID AS  
[000:21:29;15] FAR AS THAT'S NOT A SAFE  
[000:21:31;09] AREA.  
[000:21:31;22] >> SOME OF THE  Gñ KIDS WERE IN  
[000:21:35;19] THERE?  
[000:21:36;03] >> YES, SOME OF THE KIDS  
[000:21:36;26] THAT WERE OUT HERE WERE IN  
[000:21:38;19] A CLASSROOM IN THE FAR BACK  
[000:21:39;26] SIDE.  
[000:21:40;09] >> DID ANY OF THE KIDS DIE  
[000:21:41;10] IN THAT GYM?  
[000:21:42;03] >> THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT  
[000:21:43;11] SURVIVE HERE WERE ON THAT  
[000:21:44;10] SIDE OF THE SCHOOL.  
[000:21:45;29] >> SO THIS IS A FIRST  
[000:21:47;12] GRADERS IN THIS AREA  
[000:21:49;29] JEREMY.  
[000:21:50;13] >> FIRST GRADE AND  
[000:21:51;17] KINDERGARTEN IN THIS AREA.  
[000:21:53;01] THIS IS A HALLWAY WHERE  
[000:21:56;22] THEY TOOK SHELTER.  
[000:21:57;15] >> THIS IS, AGAIN, ONE OF  
[000:21:58;18] THE HALLWAYS.  
[000:21:59;17] YOU HAVE GOT THE LITTLE  
[000:22:00;25] FIRST GRADERS THAT COME OUT  
[000:22:01;27] AND LITERALLY TAUGHT TO GO  
[000:22:03;05] DOWN LIKE, THIS COVER THEIR  
[000:22:04;12] HEADS AND JUST CROUCH  
[000:22:05;07] AGAINST THE WALL?  
[000:22:05;28] >> CORRECT.  
[000:22:06;14] WE HAVE TORNADO DRILLS  
[000:22:07;15] REGULARLY IN OUR SCHOOLS.  
[000:22:09;03] THERE ARE CERTAIN SAFE  
[000:22:12;27] AREAS UNFORTUNATELY THIS  
[000:22:13;21] WAS A STORM AND WE HAVE HAD  
[000:22:14;20] ONE OTHER STORM LIKE THIS  
[000:22:15;18] THAT THE THE WEATHER MAN  
[000:22:16;28] EVEN ON THE TELEVISION WILL  
[000:22:17;24] SAY IF YOU ARE NOT  
[000:22:19;03] UNDERGROUND THERE IS A VERY  
[000:22:20;10] LIKELY CHANCE YOU WON'T  
[000:22:21;25] SURVIVE THIS STORM.  
[000:22:22;20] WE HE ONLY HAD 16 MINUTES.  
[000:22:24;05] THERE IS NO WAY TO EMPTY A  
[000:22:25;13] SCHOOL WITH ALMOST 500  
[000:22:26;21] PEOPLE IN IT OUT IN 16  
[000:22:28;22] MINUTES.  
[000:22:29;06] THINGS THAT THEY ARE  
[000:22:29;26] WORKING ON THAT DAY WHAT  
[000:22:30;20] THEY WANTED TO BE THEIR  
[000:22:33;29] FAVORITE THINGS FIVE THINGS  
[000:22:36;01] THEY LEARNED.  
[000:22:37;02] RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DAY WAS  
[000:22:38;17] OBVIOUSLY CHANGED A LOT.  
[000:22:47;08] >> LIVES CHANGED FOREVER.  
[000:22:49;18] SHEP?  
[000:22:50;01] >> Shepard: JONATHAN HUNT  
[000:22:50;24] AT PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY  
[000:22:51;23] AND MOORE.  
[000:22:54;04] WE RECEIVED NEW VIDEO OF  
[000:22:56;18] THE VIDEO OF WHAT BRIAR  
[000:22:58;02] WOOD ELEMENTARY LOOKS LIKE  
[000:22:59;12] TODAY.  
[000:22:59;25] ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF  
[000:23:00;21] AWAY FROM PLAZA TOWERS AND  
[000:23:01;21] ALSO IN THE TORNADO'S PATH.  
[000:23:03;21] JOHN ROBERTS TOURED WHAT'S  
[000:23:04;22] LEFT OF BRIAR WOOD  
[000:23:05;29] ELEMENTARY AND TOMORROW HE  
[000:23:06;29] WILL TELL US THE STORY OF  
[000:23:07;26] THE TEACHER WHO GOT HURT  
[000:23:09;18] WHILE SAVING THE STUDENTS'  
[000:23:11;18] LIVES.  
[000:23:13;21] THERE IS BREAKING NEWS NOW  
[000:23:15;21] ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.  
[000:23:16;19] WE HAVE A VERDICT IN THE  
[000:23:18;27] CASE OF THE MURDER JODI  
[000:23:20;15] ARIAS.  
[000:23:20;28] THE JURY HAS NOW DECIDED  
[000:23:22;27] WHETHER JODY -- WILL  
[000:23:24;05] RECOMMEND THAT JODI ARIAS  
[000:23:25;15] LIVES OR DIES.  
[000:23:27;11] THERE HAS BEEN A LOT GOING  
[000:23:28;06] ON IN THAT COURTROOM TODAY.  
[000:23:29;16] AT ONE POINT AS YOU KNOW  
[000:23:31;06] THE JURORS SAID WE CAN'T  
[000:23:32;05] COME UP WITH A DECISION.  
[000:23:33;10] THE JUDGE SENT THEM BACK.  
[000:23:35;01] WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE  
[000:23:36;15] CONVENING PEOPLE IN THE  
[000:23:37;16] COURTROOM NOW.  
[000:23:39;00] RELATIVES OF THE VICTIM  
[000:23:39;23] HAVE BEEN THERE AND MANY OF  
[000:23:40;25] THE COURT WATCHERS AS WELL.  
[000:23:42;25] EVERYONE IS IN THE  
[000:23:43;26] COURTROOM NOW AND THERE IS  
[000:23:45;03] A VERDICT.  
[000:23:45;27] SO OUR LIVE COVERAGE BEGINS  
[000:23:48;18] NOW OF THE JODI ARIAS  
[000:23:49;29] VERDICT.  
[000:23:50;25] AS YOU KNOW.  
[000:23:51;13] WE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE  
[000:23:52;20] OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR  
[000:23:54;25] SPECIFICS THIS AFTERNOON.  
[000:23:55;20] BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT THE  
[000:23:57;13] VERDICT IS IN.  
[000:23:58;16] WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT IT  
[000:24:00;07] IS.  
[000:24:00;19] BUT WE'RE WAITING TO FIND  
[000:24:01;14] OUT WHAT THAT VERDICT IS  
[000:24:02;20] AND, OF COURSE LIVE  
[000:24:04;10] COVERAGE.  
[000:24:04;25] TRACE GALLAGHER IS WITH US  
[000:24:05;20] FROM LOS ANGELES.  
[000:24:06;22] TRACE, THE THINKING WAS  
[000:24:07;25] THAT IF THEY DIDN'T GET A  
[000:24:09;06] VERDICT TODAY THAT THEY  
[000:24:10;27] PROBABLY WOULD TAKE A LONG  
[000:24:12;03] WEEKEND.  
[000:24:12;17] IT SOUNDS LIKE THE VERDICT  
[000:24:13;12] IS IN AND WE WILL KNOW  
[000:24:15;02] WHAT, MINUTES FROM NOW OR  
[000:24:16;07] WHAT?  
[000:24:16;20] DO WE KNOW?  
[000:24:17;06] >> WELL, SHEP, I MEAN NOT  
[000:24:18;19] SO FAST, BECAUSE THE JUDGE  
[000:24:19;25] SAID FIRST WE UNDERSTAND  
[000:24:20;25] THE JURY THAT YOU HAVE A  
[000:24:22;10] VERDICT.  
[000:24:22;25] AND, IN FACT WHAT THEY ARE  
[000:24:23;21] SAYING NOW IS THE JUDGE  
[000:24:25;09] COULD VERY WELL BE  
[000:24:26;27] DEADLOCKED.  
[000:24:27;13] NOW, OUR FEED IS KIND OF  
[000:24:28;18] BREAKING UP.  
[000:24:29;13] CAN YOU SEE JODI ARIAS  
[000:24:30;20] RIGHT THERE.  
[000:24:31;07] BUT IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE  
[000:24:32;18] JURY HAS NOT REACHED A  
[000:24:34;22] UNANIMOUS DECISION, SHEP  
[000:24:35;23] SO THE JURY REMAINS  
[000:24:37;24] DEADLOCKED.  
[000:24:38;10] AND WE WENT OVER THE  
[000:24:39;04] OPTIONS BEFORE THE COURT.  
[000:24:40;09] AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS  
[000:24:41;14] IN ESSENCE THE JUDGE HAS  
[000:24:43;15] NOW SET A FURTHER DATE FOR  
[000:24:45;12] THEM, JULY 18TH IS THE DATE  
[000:24:46;23] FOR WHAT TO HAPPEN?  
[000:24:48;05] >> FOR THE RETRIAL.  
[000:24:49;15] SO THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO  
[000:24:50;20] HAPPEN NOW.  
[000:24:51;07] WE TALKED ABOUT OPTION ONE  
[000:24:52;18] AND JULY 18TH HAS NOW BEEN  
[000:24:54;02] SET FOR A RETRIAL.  
[000:24:55;03] WHAT THEY WILL DO BETWEEN  
[000:24:56;04] NOW AND JULY 18TH, SHEP,  
[000:24:57;26] THEY WILL IMPANEL A BRAND  
[000:24:59;15] NEW JURY.  
[000:25:00;00] THIS JURY WILL BE EXCUSED.  
[000:25:01;19] THEY WILL IMPANEL A BRAND  
[000:25:03;24] NEW JURY AND THAT NEW JURY  
[000:25:05;14] WILL THEN RETRY PART OF THE  
[000:25:08;00] PENALTY PHASE.  
[000:25:08;18] NOT THE ENTIRE PENALTY  
[000:25:10;05] PHASE.  
[000:25:10;19] BUT PART OF IT BECAUSE THE  
[000:25:12;21] AGRA VARIETY HAS ALREADY  
[000:25:13;21] BEEN MET.  
[000:25:14;22] WHAT THE NEW JURY WILL DO  
[000:25:16;15] IS RETRY THE TAIL END OF  
[000:25:18;04] THE PENALTY PHASE.  
[000:25:19;03] THE IMPACT STATEMENTS FROM  
[000:25:19;28] THE FAMILY WILL BE READ  
[000:25:21;01] AGAIN AND THIS TIME JODI  
[000:25:22;19] ARIAS, IF SHE WANTS TO HAVE  
[000:25:23;29] SOMEBODY TESTIFY ON HER  
[000:25:25;08] BEHALF THAT CAN ALSO HAPPEN  
[000:25:28;00] DURING THE RETRY OF THE  
[000:25:29;08] PENALTY PHASE.  
[000:25:30;01] SO THE SECOND CHOICE THE  
[000:25:31;04] PROSECUTORS HAD WAS TO WAVE  
[000:25:32;12] THE DEATH PENALTY ALL  
[000:25:33;20] TOGETHER.  
[000:25:34;11] AND AGREE TO LIFE IN  
[000:25:35;20] PRISON.  
[000:25:36;04] CLEARLY THE PROSECUTION DID  
[000:25:37;00] NOT WANT TO DO THAT BECAUSE  
[000:25:39;24] THE JUDGE HAS AGREED TO SAY  
[000:25:42;28] LOOK WE ARE GOING TO GO  
[000:25:43;21] WITH A BRAND NEW JURY.  
[000:25:44;23] THEY WILL CULL THAT JURY  
[000:25:47;19] FROM THE SAME JURY THE  
[000:25:50;03] ORIGINAL MARICOPA COUNTY.  
[000:25:51;07] WE HAVE TALKED AD NAUSEAM  
[000:25:53;03] ABOUT THE COVERAGE THIS  
[000:25:55;02] TRIAL HAS GOTTEN IS THERE  
[000:25:58;07] ANY JURY JURY THAT COULDN'T  
[000:25:59;24] BE SKEWED BY THE COVERAGE.  
[000:26:01;21] THAT'S THE GO INTO THE JURY  
[000:26:03;06] SELECTION.  
[000:26:03;22] THOSE JUST JOINING US.  
[000:26:04;18] THIS IS HUGE NEWS.  
[000:26:05;11] THE JURY WAS DEADLOCKED.  
[000:26:06;21] THE JUDGE COULD HAVE SENT  
[000:26:07;20] THEM BACK AGAIN TO KEEP ON  
[000:26:09;14] DELIBERATING.  
[000:26:10;01] BUT THEY CAME BACK SAYING,  
[000:26:11;27] LOOK, WE ARE HOPELESSLY  
[000:26:13;21] DEAD LOCKED.  
[000:26:14;08] WE DON'T KNOW IF THE EXACT  
[000:26:15;16] COUNT IF IT WAS 6 TO 6 OR 8  
[000:26:17;24] TO 4.  
[000:26:18;16] THEY ARE DEADLOCKED.  
[000:26:19;15] THE JUDGE WILL NOW LET THE  
[000:26:20;20] JURY GO AND THEY WILL  
[000:26:21;22] IMPANEL A BRAND NEW JURY,  
[000:26:24;10] SHEP.  
[000:26:24;23] WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT  
[000:26:25;17] WILL HAPPEN.  
[000:26:26;03] BUT, FOR NOW, JODI ARIAS  
[000:26:27;21] GOES BACK TO THE MARICOPA  
[000:26:29;07] COUNTY JAIL AND SHE WILL  
[000:26:30;13] AWAIT A BRAND NEW PENALTY  
[000:26:36;01] PHASE OF HER TRIAL TO SEE  
[000:26:37;03] IF SHE LIVES OR DIES.  
[000:26:38;23] THE PROSECUTION WANTS TO  
[000:26:39;23] SEE THIS THROUGH TO THE  
[000:26:40;28] END.  
[000:26:41;10] THEY ARE NOT ABOUT TO WAIVE  
[000:26:42;28] THE DEATH PENALTY IN A CASE  
[000:26:44;27] WHERE SHE STABBED HER  
[000:26:46;17] BOYFRIEND 27 TIMES, SLASHED  
[000:26:47;13] HIS THROAT AND SHOT HIM IN  
[000:26:48;15] THE HEAD.  
[000:26:49;00] IT IS HUGE NEWS.  
[000:26:50;00] STILL WAITING FOR MORE  
[000:26:50;28] INFORMATION FROM THE JUDGE  
[000:26:51;21] AS IT COMES INTO THIS US,  
[000:26:53;27] SHEP.  
[000:26:54;11] WE WILL KEEP YOU UP TO  
[000:26:55;17] DATE.  
[000:26:56;00] >> Shepard: WE'RE NOT GOING  
[000:26:56;24] TO STOP HERE, TRACE.  
[000:26:57;16] WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF  
[000:26:58;12] ANY OF THE PLAYERS FROM THE  
[000:26:59;11] COURTHOUSE COME OUT AND  
[000:27:00;10] TALK.  
[000:27:00;23] WE HAVE LIVE COVERAGE OF  
[000:27:01;18] THAT, OF COURSE, ANYTHING  
[000:27:02;13] FROM LAWYERS ON EITHER  
[000:27:03;17] SIDE?  
[000:27:04;00] ANYTHING FROM THESE JURORS  
[000:27:04;25] WHO HAVE NOW BEEN  
[000:27:05;29] DISMISSED?  
[000:27:06;15] TRACE, IT'S POSSIBLE WE  
[000:27:07;08] MIGHT HEAR FROM THEM  
[000:27:08;12] RIGHT?  
[000:27:08;26] >> WE MIGHT VERY WELL,  
[000:27:10;00] SHEP.  
[000:27:10;13] BECAUSE THEY HAD SAID THE  
[000:27:11;07] JURORS AFTER THIS WOULD  
[000:27:12;10] SPEAK.  
[000:27:12;24] WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THREE  
[000:27:14;15] FEMALE JURORS AS THEY WERE  
[000:27:15;29] LEAVING THE COURT PARDON  
[000:27:17;28] ME, WERE CRYING.  
[000:27:18;27] SO THREE FEMALE JURORS WERE  
[000:27:20;11] CRYING AS THEY LEFT THE  
[000:27:21;22] COURT.  
[000:27:22;05] KEEP IN MIND, I MEAN, THIS  
[000:27:22;29] IS A JURY THAT HAS WORKED  
[000:27:24;11] FOR THE BETTER PART OF  
[000:27:26;09] FOUR FOUR AND A HALF  
[000:27:27;03] MONTHS ON THIS CASE.  
[000:27:28;00] IT HAS BEEN A HUGE PART OF  
[000:27:30;00] THEIR LIVES.  
[000:27:30;20] WHEN THEY'RE EXCUSED.  
[000:27:32;17] UNABLE TO SEE THIS THROUGH,  
[000:27:33;22] IT'S GOT TO BE EXTREMELY  
[000:27:35;09] EMOTIONAL FOR THEM.  
[000:27:36;04] AGAIN, WE DON'T KNOW THE  
[000:27:37;20] BREAKDOWN, SHEP.  
[000:27:38;09] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE JURY  
[000:27:39;23] MAKEUP WAS AND HOW MANY  
[000:27:40;22] WERE IN FAVOR OF LIFE AND  
[000:27:42;00] IN FAVOR OF DEATH.  
[000:27:43;17] AS LEGAL EXPERTS WOULD TELL  
[000:27:44;27] YOU, IT IS A LOT HARDER FOR  
[000:27:46;23] TO SWAY A JUROR WHO IS IN  
[000:27:48;09] FAVOR OF LIFE IN PRISON TO  
[000:27:49;18] ACTUALLY GO TO THE DEATH  
[000:27:51;05] PENALTY THAN THE CONVERSE.  
[000:27:53;00] TO SWITCH SOMEBODY WHO IS  
[000:27:54;20] IN FAVOR OF THE DEATH  
[000:27:55;19] PENALTY TO GO TOWARD LIFE  
[000:27:56;27] IN PRISON.  
[000:27:57;19] BUT APPARENTLY THESE JURORS  
[000:28:00;16] WERE VERY ADAMANT ABOUT  
[000:28:01;28] THEIR VIEWS BECAUSE THEY  
[000:28:03;04] SAID AFTER THREE HOURS OF  
[000:28:05;17] DELIBERATIONS YESTERDAY,  
[000:28:06;11] THEY CAME IN THEY TOLD THE  
[000:28:07;17] JUDGE THEY WERE DEADLOCKED.  
[000:28:08;26] SHE SAID GO BACK AND TRY  
[000:28:10;11] AGAIN.  
[000:28:10;25] NOW, SHE COULD HAVE DONE  
[000:28:11;28] THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.  
[000:28:12;25] SHE COULD HAVE SENT THE  
[000:28:14;04] JURY BACK IN TO THE JURY  
[000:28:15;13] ROOM TO KEEP DELIBERATING.  
[000:28:17;15] FIVE SIX, SEVEN, 10 TIMES,  
[000:28:19;06] WHO KNOWS?  
[000:28:20;05] IT'S UP TO THE JUDGE.  
[000:28:21;13] CLEARLY, SHE GOT  
[000:28:22;14] INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE  
[000:28:23;16] DEADLOCKED AND SHE DECIDED  
[000:28:24;22] THE BEST AND MOST  
[000:28:26;19] EXPEDITIOUS WAY TO APPROACH  
[000:28:27;17] THIS WOULD BE TO IMPANEL A  
[000:28:29;04] BRAND NEW JURY.  
[000:28:30;15] IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS.  
[000:28:31;09] I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT I  
[000:28:32;15] MEAN, WE HAVE COVERED A  
[000:28:33;10] BUNCH OF TRIALS AND I HAVE  
[000:28:34;18] NEVER SEEN A BRAND NEW JURY  
[000:28:36;19] COME IN AND TAKE OVER TO  
[000:28:39;01] DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE  
[000:28:40;03] LIVES OR DIES.  
[000:28:41;03] AND THEY WILL NOT TRY THE  
[000:28:42;26] BEGINNING OF THIS TRIAL.  
[000:28:45;08] SO THIS BRAND NEW JURY WILL  
[000:28:46;19] GET BROUGHT UP TO SPEED AND  
[000:28:48;05] THEN ONLY HEAR THE EVIDENCE  
[000:28:49;08] THAT WAS DELIVERED IN THE  
[000:28:50;14] PENALTY PHASE.  
[000:28:51;08] IT MIGHT BE -- IT MIGHT BE  
[000:28:52;28] KIND OF AN EXTRACTED  
[000:28:55;08] PENALTY PHASE IF YOU WILL  
[000:28:56;02] BUT IT WILL STILL ONLY BE  
[000:28:57;24] THE TAIL END OF THAT  
[000:28:58;29] PENALTY PHASE THAT GOES  
[000:29:00;10] PAST THE AGGRAVATING  
[000:29:02;12] FACTORS.  
[000:29:02;26] THE JURY UP TO NOW THAT WAS  
[000:29:03;29] IN THIS CASE FROM THE  
[000:29:04;29] BEGINNING HAS AGREED THAT  
[000:29:06;04] SHE IS GUILTY AND HAS  
[000:29:07;19] AGREED THAT WERE  
[000:29:09;16] AGGRAVATING FACTORS.  
[000:29:10;15] NOW THE SECOND JURY, THEY  
[000:29:11;24] WILL BE CHARGED WITH THE  
[000:29:13;10] TASK OF DECIDING WHETHER OR  
[000:29:15;22] NOT JODI ARIAS LIVES OR  
[000:29:17;19] DIES.  
[000:29:18;02] THE JURY SELECTION ALONE  
[000:29:20;08] COULD BE VERY LONG AND VERY  
[000:29:23;02] TEDIOUS.  
[000:29:23;25] JULY 18TH IS WHEN THAT WILL  
[000:29:25;05] ALL BEGIN.  
[000:29:25;29] SO FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS  
[000:29:27;27] JODI ARIAS GOES BACK TO THE  
[000:29:29;17] MARICOPA COUNTY JAIL, SHEP.  
[000:29:32;06] >> Shepard: I CAN'T EVEN  
[000:29:33;00] BELIEVE THIS, TRACE.  
[000:29:33;21] THINK OF ALL THAT HAS  
[000:29:35;01] HAPPENED OUTSIDE THAT

[000:29:38;07] IN AMERICA HAS HAD ACCESS  
[000:29:40;02] TO.  
[000:29:40;14] AWESOME SPEECHES BY JODI  
[000:29:42;25] ARIAS, THE WORD NOW THAT  
[000:29:43;18] THE MEDIA HAVE GIVEN HER  
[000:29:45;00] MAKEUP AND SHE HAS GONE  
[000:29:46;04] THROUGH ALL OF THIS HOW SHE  
[000:29:47;13] FEELS AND WHAT SHE WANTS TO  
[000:29:48;19] DO IN PRISON AND ALL OF  
[000:29:50;00] THIS SIDE STUFF THAT NO  
[000:29:51;14] JUROR WAS SUPPOSED TO EVER  
[000:29:53;07] HEAR.  
[000:29:53;20] ESPECIALLY NOT THOSE MAKING  
[000:29:54;27] A LIFE OR DEATH DECISION  
[000:29:56;06] ABOUT HER.  
[000:29:57;06] NOW ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN  
[000:29:58;04] AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE.  
[000:29:59;04] THEY HAVE TO START OVER.  
[000:30:00;12] I HAVE NEAFER HEARD OF  
[000:30:01;13] THIS.  
[000:30:03;01] I OHIO NEVER HEARD OF THIS.  
[000:30:04;26] >> IMAGINE WE HAD THREE OF  
[000:30:06;01] THE ORIGINAL JURORS WERE  
[000:30:06;29] KICKED OFF THE JURY.  
[000:30:07;28] SO THEY HAD THREE OF THE  
[000:30:09;18] ALTERNATES THAT WERE IN  
[000:30:10;29] PLACE WHEN THIS FINAL JURY  
[000:30:12;02] MADE THE DECISION WE ARE  
[000:30:13;02] TALKING ABOUT MAYBE 15, 20  
[000:30:14;17] MINUTES AGO.  
[000:30:15;07] SO NOW YOU HAVE THIS JURY  
[000:30:17;13] POOL AND JURY SELECTION WAS  
[000:30:18;25] TEDIOUS TO BEGIN WITH.  
[000:30:20;06] AND NOW YOU HAVE THIS JURY  
[000:30:21;15] POOL THAT OF COURSE, THE  
[000:30:22;20] MOTIONS ARE GOING TO BE  
[000:30:23;13] FILED BITE THE DEFENSE

[000:30:25;20] YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO  
[000:30:27;02] FIND A FAIR JURY IN

[000:30:40;01] THEY WILL CLEARLY ASK FOR A  
[000:30:41;05] CHANGE OF VENUE.  
[000:30:42;12] IMAGINE THAT IMAGINE JODI

[000:30:45;07] AND A CHANGE OF VENUE IN A  
[000:30:46;19] DIFFERENT COUNTY IN

[000:37:13;07] THE JURORS TO COME OUT AND  
[000:37:14;15] SPEAK.  
[000:37:15;04] AGAIN, THE JUDGE LIFTED THE  
[000:37:16;22] GAG ORDER.  
[000:37:17;08] SO WE HAVE HEARD CHAPTER  
[000:37:18;22] AND VERSE FROM JODI ARIAS  
[000:37:21;06] THE MURDERER, SHE TALKS

[000:37:31;21] A POTENTIAL IT NEXT JURY  
[000:37:33;03] AND FOR HER, THIS WORKED  
[000:37:35;18] OUT ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY.

[000:37:40;04] TAKE THE STAND FOR 17 DAYS  
[000:37:44;15] THEN LATER LIFTED THE GAG  
[000:37:45;18] ORDER AND LET THE REPORTERS  
[000:37:46;20] RIGHT IN THERE SO THAT JODI  
[000:37:48;17] ARIAS COULD SPOUT AWAY

[000:40:00;25] ORDER ON THIS CASE FROM THE  
[000:40:01;26] VERY BEGINNING.  
[000:40:03;03] AND WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE  
[000:40:05;28] MOST IMPORTANT THING, THE  
[000:40:07;27] GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO KILL  
[000:40:09;14] YOU OR WE ARE GOING TO LOCK  
[000:40:10;20] YOU UP FOR THE REST OF YOUR  
[000:40:13;03] LAYOFF.  
[000:40:13;17] THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS  
[000:40:14;29] THE GOVERNMENT CAN EVER  
[000:40:16;00] DECIDE, THE PEOPLE ARE  
[000:40:17;05] HAVING TO DECIDE WHAT THE

[000:40:23;27] ORDER?  
[000:40:24;11] WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  
[000:40:25;07] >> THE ONLY RATIONALIZATION  
[000:40:26;05] I COULD THINK OF IS THIS IS  
[000:40:27;15] A WOMAN WHO IS LITERALLY  
[000:40:29;04] FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE  
[000:40:30;14] LITERALLY FIGHTING FOR HER  
[000:40:31;23] LIFE.  
[000:40:32;07] SHE HAS HAD HER FIRST  
[000:40:34;20] AMENDMENT PRIVILEGES TAKEN  
[000:40:35;14] AWAY FROM HER THROUGHOUT  
[000:40:36;07] THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL.  
[000:40:37;02] SHE IS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK  
[000:40:38;24] FREELY THE WAY EVERYONE  
[000:40:39;17] ELSE IS.  
[000:40:40;11] AND I MEAN, I'M GUESSING,  
[000:40:42;01] SHEPAR BUT THE JUDGE  
[000:40:43;03] PROBABLY SAID HEY, SHE HAS  
[000:40:43;28] GOT A COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT.

[000:40:53;21] OF THE MEANEST SUPPOSEDLY.  
[000:40:55;16] HE ARRANGED IT AND ALLOWED  
[000:40:56;21] IT TO HAPPEN.  
[000:40:57;12] SHE NEVER LOOKED SO GOOD.  
[000:40:58;29] MAKEUP AND LIPSTICK AND ALL  
[000:41:00;06] OF THAT STUFF.  
[000:41:01;01] AND SHE HAS NOW MADE HER  
[000:41:02;11] CASE WHICH IS OUT THERE  
[000:41:04;11] NATIONALLY.  
[000:41:04;27] WHATEVER NEW JURORS THERE  
[000:41:05;21] ARE I'M SURE HAVE HEARD IT.

[000:41:13;18] FOR DAYS ACCUSED HER  
[000:41:15;15] EXLOVER OF ABUSING HER.  
[000:41:16;21] AFTER SHE MURDERED HIM IN  
[000:41:19;05] COLD BLOOD, ACCUSED HIM OF  
[000:41:21;09] ABUSIVING HER.  
[000:41:22;18] THAT'S WHAT THIS FAMILY --

[000:46:47;21] WE ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS  
[000:46:48;24] OPTION TWO IN THIS.  
[000:46:49;28] OPTION ONE IS IMPANELING  
[000:46:51;12] BRAND NEW JURY AND GOING  
[000:46:52;18] OVER PART OF THE PENALTY  
[000:46:53;26] PHASE.  
[000:46:54;12] OPTION 2 IS IF PROSECUTOR  
[000:46:56;04] DECIDED THEY WANTED TO  
[000:46:57;12] WAIVE THE DEATH PENALTY AND  
[000:46:58;09] AGREE TO LIFE IN PRISON.  
[000:46:59;15] NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A  
[000:47:00;15] STATUS HEARING THAT HAS  
[000:47:01;08] BEEN SET FOR JUNE 20TH,  
[000:47:02;23] WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WILL  
[000:47:03;26] MEET WITH PROSECUTORS AND  
[000:47:04;27] THEY WILL DISCUSS GOING  
[000:47:06;14] FORWARD.  
[000:47:06;29] NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG  
[000:47:08;01] SHOT BECAUSE THESE  
[000:47:09;08] PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN  
[000:47:10;21] ADAMANT ABOUT GOING FOR THE  
[000:47:13;11] DEATH PENALTY IT STILL  
[000:47:15;11] LEAVES A GREAT PERIOD FOR  
[000:47:17;22] THEM 27 DAYS WHERE THEY CAN  
[000:47:18;17] FIGURE OUT IF THIS WILL  
[000:47:19;28] WORK IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT  
[000:47:20;28] A CHANGE OF VENUE, IF THEY  
[000:47:22;10] CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET A  
[000:47:23;16] JURY AND THE PROSECUTORS  
[000:47:26;04] COULD IN THEORY SAY YOU  
[000:47:27;07] KNOW WHAT?  
[000:47:27;27] WE ARE GOING TO AGREE TO  
[000:47:28;28] GIVE HER LIFE IN PRISON AND  
[000:47:30;03] THEN CUT A DEAL WITH THE  
[000:47:31;03] DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND SAY  
[000:47:32;00] HERE IS THE DEAL.  
[000:47:33;14] YOU TAKE LIFE IN PRISON  
[000:47:34;11] WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF  
[000:47:36;20] PAROLE WHICH YOU IS REALLY  
[000:47:38;00] IMPORTANT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW  
[000:47:39;06] ARIZONA DOESN'T HAVE A  
[000:47:40;18] MECHANISM THAT GIVES LIFE  
[000:47:42;07] IN PRISON ANY TYPE OR ANY  
[000:47:43;28] CHANCE OF PAROLE BUT SOME  
[000:47:45;09] DAY DOWN THE LINE, 20 YEARS  
[000:47:46;29] FROM NOW.  
[000:47:47;16] IF THAT LAW IS PASSED THAT  
[000:47:49;12] GIVES THEM THAT.  
[000:47:50;09] SHE WOULD HAVE TO WAIVE  
[000:47:51;05] THAT IN OTHER WORDS THE  
[000:47:52;11] DEAL WOULD BE SHE WOULD  
[000:47:53;16] ACCEPT LIFE IN PRISON  
[000:47:55;10] WITHOUT ANY POSSIBILITY OF  
[000:47:56;26] PAROLE OR THEY ARE GOING  
[000:47:57;25] FORWARD WITH THE DEATH  
[000:47:58;26] PENALTY.  
[000:47:59;11] THAT'S JUST ONE THEORY.  
[000:48:00;05] BUT PROSECUTORS HAVE SAID  
[000:48:01;00] FROM DAY ONE THEY BELIEVE  
[000:48:03;13] THIS IS A DEATH PENALTY  
[000:48:05;19] CASE AND FOR THEM TO QUIT  
[000:48:06;20] IN THE MIDDLE OF IT SEEMS  
[000:48:08;23] HIGHLY UNLIKELY, BUT THERE  
[000:48:09;19] IS THAT LITTLE BIT OF  
[000:48:11;12] LEEWAY THEY HAVE NOW, SHEP  
[000:48:12;12] BUT IT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE  
[000:48:13;19] THEY WILL IMPANEL A BRAND  
[000:48:15;01] NEW DEATH PENALTY JURY.  
[000:48:18;00] >> Shepard: TRACE, I'M SO  
[000:48:18;26] HOPEFUL THAT ONE OF THESE  
[000:48:19;22] JURORS OR A GROUP OF THESE  
[000:48:20;24] JURORS WILL COME OUT.  
[000:48:21;20] WE WERE TOLD EARLIER THAT  
[000:48:22;20] THREE OF THE JURORS WERE  
[000:48:23;16] SEEN CRYING.  
[000:48:24;06] I BELIEVE YOU REPORTED  
[000:48:25;26] THAT.  
[000:48:26;09] RIGHT, TRACE?  
[000:48:26;27] >> YEAH, THREE OF THE WOMEN  
[000:48:27;26] WERE CRYING AS THEY LEFT  
[000:48:28;27] THE COURT.  
[000:48:29;22] REMEMBER YOU HAVE GOT THE  
[000:48:31;02] ALEXANDER FAMILY, THEY ARE  
[000:48:32;09] AN EMOTIONAL WRECK RIGHT  
[000:48:33;24] NOW.  
[000:48:34;06] THEY HAVE BEEN PULLED  
[000:48:35;01] ASIDE.  
[000:48:35;14] CAN YOU IMAGINE?  
[000:48:36;04] YOU GO THROUGH FOUR AND A  
[000:48:36;27] HALF MONTHS OF THIS.  
[000:48:37;23] YOU ARE EXPECTING THIS TO  
[000:48:38;26] HAPPEN.  
[000:48:39;10] AND YOU GET THE VERDICT IS  
[000:48:40;17] NO VERDICT.  
[000:48:42;15] VERY EMOTIONALLY DRAINING  
[000:48:44;15] SHEP.  
[000:48:44;28] >> Shepard: YOU KNOW, THERE  
[000:48:45;23] IS SOMEBODY ELSE TO WHOM  
[000:48:46;17] THEY CAN TURN ON THIS,  
[000:48:48;16] ARTHUR.  
[000:48:49;00] >> IF I'M THE PROSECUTOR,  
[000:48:49;23] AFTER WHAT THIS DECEASED  
[000:48:50;28] FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH.  
[000:48:51;25] AND WE HAVE HEARD THEIR  
[000:48:53;00] HEART WRENCHING CRIES, THEY  
[000:48:54;16] SHOULD BE MAKING THAT  
[000:48:55;13] DECISION.  
[000:48:55;28] YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS  
[000:48:57;01] AGAIN?  
[000:48:57;15] DO YOU WANT TO HAVE THIS  
[000:48:58;18] OPEN-ENDED PART OF YOUR  
[000:48:59;13] LIFE FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS  
[000:49:00;26] AND WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH  
[000:49:02;08] LONGER OR DO YOU WANT TO  
[000:49:03;07] JUST SAY PUT HER IN JAIL  
[000:49:05;14] FOREVER?  
[000:49:06;13] >> Shepard: THAT WITH A WOO  
[000:49:07;08] BE AN INTERESTING TURN OF  
[000:49:08;19] EVENTS.  
[000:49:09;03] WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM  
[000:49:09;28] LAWYERS IN THE CASE.  
[000:49:11;01] IN ADDITION JURORS.  
[000:49:12;25] LIVE COVERAGE CONTINUE  
[000:49:13;18] ITING AFTER THIS.
[000:49:20;01] Many choose us because we have  the
[000:49:20;22] largest 4GLTE network.
[000:49:25;01] Others, because of our  reputation
[000:49:25;21] for reliability.
[000:49:28;21] Or maybe it's because  we've received
[000:49:29;13] JD Power
[000:49:30;15] and Associates' customer service 
[000:49:31;05] award 4X in a row.
[000:49:34;14] In the end  there are countless reasons.
[000:49:37;07] But one choi.

[000:51:50;07] WAY.  
[000:51:51;08] ACCUSES HIM OF ABUSING HER  
[000:51:53;19] IN THE WAY SHE DID.  
[000:51:54;19] SHE HAS BEEN ON EVERY  
[000:51:57;14] TELEVISION IN AMERICA  
[000:51:58;17] SPOUTING HER CRAP SO  
[000:51:59;10] PROSECUTORS COULD CALL IN  
[000:52:00;05] THE FAMILY OF TRAVIS  
[000:52:01;08] ALEXANDER AND GO, YOU HAVE  
[000:52:02;18] BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

[000:52:12;00] WOULDN'T ARTHUR.  
[000:52:12;28] YOU ARE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT  
[000:52:14;06] IT UP.  
[000:52:15;00] I WOULDN'T KNOW WHY THEY  
[000:52:16;06] WOULDN'T DO THAT.  
[000:52:17;04] >> DON'T FORGET THE  
[000:52:18;07] PROSECUTORS WORK FOR THE  
[000:52:19;07] PEOPLE RIGHT?  
[000:52:19;25] THEY WORK FOR EVERYONE.  
[000:52:20;24] BUT THEY WORK FOR THOSE  
[000:52:22;05] PARTICULAR CITIZENS AS  
[000:52:24;06] WELL.  
[000:52:24;23] >> Shepard: THE PROSECUTORS  
[000:52:25;21] ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECTED  
[000:52:26;19] PUBLIC FROM DANGEROUS  
[000:52:27;11] PEOPLE AND PUNISH THOSE.  
[000:52:28;14] SHE IS NOT GOING TO HURT

[000:52:38;02] HER GUILT RELATIVELY  
[000:52:40;07] QUICKLY.  
[000:52:40;21] >> Shepard: YOU BET.  
[000:52:41;11] REACHED THE VERDICT ON IT  
[000:52:42;14] BEING A HEINOUS CRIME,  
[000:52:44;06] CRUEL CRIME QUICKLY.  
[000:52:45;06] ON THIS A JURY THAT LIVES  
[000:52:47;08] AND BREATHES.

[000:52:49;05] WE HAVE BEEN WAITING TO  
[000:52:50;17] HEAR FROM THE JURORS  
[000:52:51;15] RIGHT?  
[000:52:51;28] THAT WAS THE HOPE THESE  
[000:52:52;27] JURORS WHO DEADLOCKED ON  
[000:52:53;25] THIS MOST IMPORTANT PHASE  
[000:52:54;20] OF IT ALL.

[000:53:01;18] JUROR HAS DECLINED TO SPEAK  
[000:53:03;02] TO US AT THIS POINT.  
[000:53:05;05] AND THEIR NAMES ARE UNDER  
[000:53:06;20] SEAL.  
[000:53:07;04] DON'T EVEN THINK THAT THE  
[000:53:07;28] MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA DON'T  
[000:53:08;28] KNOW WHO THEY ARE.  
[000:53:09;19] THEY DO.  
[000:53:10;05] IF YOU YOU HAVE BEEN  
[000:53:12;01] THROUGH ALL OF THIS, WHY  
[000:53:13;09] WOULDN'T YOU SPEAK?

[000:53:15;23] I GUARANTEE YOU IT'S  
[000:53:17;04] COMING.  
[000:53:18;21] THERE WILL BE BOOKS.  
[000:53:21;28] THERE IS A GRAVE TRAIN  
[000:53:23;18] HERE.

[000:53:34;29] WE WILL HEAR PLENTY AND

[000:54:06;11] I'M PHYLLIS  AND I HAVE DIABETIC NERVE
[000:54:07;04] PAIN.  WHEN I FIRST FELT  THE DIABETIC
[000:54:09;00] NERVE PAIN,  OF COURSE  I HAD NO IDEA
[000:54:12;25] WHAT IT WAS.  I FELT LIKE  MY FEET
[000:54:14;09] WERE GOING TO SLEEP.  IT PROGRESSED
[000:54:16;22] FROM THERE  TO BURNING  LIKE I WAS
[000:54:20;16] WALKING  ON HOT COALS...  TO LIKE
[000:54:22;26] 1,000 BEES  THAT WERE JUST STINGING
[000:54:24;17] MY FEET.  I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
[000:54:26;01] WITH MY DOCTOR...  HE FOUND LYRICA
[000:54:28;28] FOR ME.    [ Female Announcer ] IT'S
[000:54:30;15] KNOWN    THAT DIABETES DAMAGES NERVES.
[000:54:32;18] LYRICA IS FDA APPROVED    TO TREAT
[000:54:33;10] DIABETIC NERVE PAIN.    LYRICA IS
