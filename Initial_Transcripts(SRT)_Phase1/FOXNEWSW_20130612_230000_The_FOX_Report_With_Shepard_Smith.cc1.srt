70
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THE SENATORS DID NOT OBJECT

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
TO MONITORING SPECIFIC

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
TERRORIST SUSPECTS.

73
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
SOME DID ASK WHY IS THE

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING THE

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
CITY OF CHICAGO, IT

81
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
YOU NEED TO COLLECT AWFUL

83
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS MADE

84
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
IN THE 312 AREA CODE ON THE

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
CHANCE THAT ONE OF THOSE

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
PERSONS MIGHT BE ON THE

87
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
OTHER END OF THE PHONE.

88
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
DON'T KNOW HE IS IN 312

90
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
YET?
BECAUSE WE HAD STORED THAT

91
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
DATA IN A DATABASE WE

92
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000

93
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
GO BACKWARDS IN TIME AND

94
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
SEE WHO HE WAS TALKING TO.

95
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
>> Shepard: GENERAL
ALEXANDER SAYS HE WANTS TO

96
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
DECLASSIFY SOME OF THE

97
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
ALL THE US ABOUT HOW THE

98
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000

AFRAID OF IT BEING KNOWN

233
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THAT IT IS WILLING TO USE

234
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ANY MEANS SUCH AS

235
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
DIPLOMATIC INTIMIDATION TO

FROM BECOMING PUBLIC MUCH

238
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS

239
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
ASKED TODAY ABOUT TARGETING

240
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
FOREIGN COMPUTERS AND

241
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000

LISTEN.

243
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
BETWEEN, YOU KNOW GOING

245
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
AFTER ECONOMIC DATA AND

246
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
FINANCIAL INFORMATION, THAT

247
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
IS PART OF THE CYBER

248
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ATTACKS.

249
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
OR SEEMS TO BE.

250
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000

00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
THE DEBATE ON WHICH IS

255
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
SURVEILLANCE.

256
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO

257
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
MEAN TO DO HARM.

258
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000

259
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
SHEP.

261
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
EVEN EDWARD SNOWDEN ADMITS

262

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
ALL ABOUT ANY CHINESE

264
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
MILITARY TECHNOLOGY.

265
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
SHEP?

266
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
>> Shepard: HE SAYS THAT HE
CAN LEAVE HONG KONG ANY

267
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
TIME HE WANTS TO.

268
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
>> YEAH, HE SAID HE HAD

269
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FLEE

270
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
BUT, INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO

271
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
STAY AND FIGHT.

272
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
AND IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH

273
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
THE CHINESE NEWSPAPER HE

274
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000

275
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
HIMSELF AS THE GOOD GUY

276
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000

RULES THAT REQUIRE KIDS TO

349
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
SHE WENT INTO A COMA.

350
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000

HE MOVED THE MOUNTAIN

356
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
SARAH GOT THE CALL.

357
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000

358
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
SARAH'S NEW BEGINNING AND

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
NEW LIFE.

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
DOCTORS STARTED THE

361
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
OPERATION AND AS THEY DID

362
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
SARAH'S MOTHER LEFT THE

363
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HOSPITAL TO UPDATE

364
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
REPORTERS.

365
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT THE MOMENT

366
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
THE SURGEONS WIELD HER

367
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
DAUGHTER AWAY.
>> I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH

368
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
SHE IS UNDERSTANDING ME.

369
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I KISSED HER GOOD BY.

370
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
IT WAS EASIER WAY TO SAY

371
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
GOODBYE TO HER THAN IF SHE

372
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WERE AWAKE AND SCARED.

373
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
WE HAD NO OTHER OPTION, NO

374
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
OTHER OUT.

375
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
WE HAD VERY LIMITED TIME

376
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
AND THIS IS JUST LIKE A

377
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
BLESSING FROM GOD.
I FEEL LIKE JUST IT CAME AT

378
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
JUST THE LAST MINUTE AND WE

379
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT MUCH

380
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
LONGER.

381
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
>> Shepard: THE SARAH

382

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
BIT OF POLLING, THE POLLS

572
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
SHOW THE MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS ARE NOT YET

573
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SATISFIED WITH THE A SENSE

574
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
THEY HAVE HEARD REGARDING

575
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THREE MAJOR CONTROVERSIES.

576
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
WHEN ASKED MORE THAN 70%

577
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
SAY THEY THINK CONGRESS

578
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
SHOULD CONTINUE TO

579
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
INVESTIGATE THE IRS, THE

580
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND

581
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
BENGHAZI RESPECTIVELY.

582
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
WELL, MULTIPLE WILDFIRES

583
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
FORCING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

584
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES BEHIND

585
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
IN COLORADO.

586
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
COMING UP A LIVE UPDATE AS

587
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THE FLAMES RAGE THROUGH THE

588
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
ROCKIES.
BUT FIRST, A FOX WEATHER

589
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
ALERT.
ENORMOUS LINE OF SEVERE

590
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
WEATHER THAT HAS Pá(

591
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
THUNDERSTORMS FIRST ALERT

592
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
FORECAST FROM IOWA TO

593
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
MARYLAND.
THE CONDITIONS COULD EVENLY

594
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
SPAWN POTENTIALLY DEADLY

595
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
EVENT.

596
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
A TYPE OF FIERCE WIND STORM

597
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
THAT'S RARER THAN A TORNADO

598
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
BUT CAPABLE OF CAUSING

599
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
DAMAGE ON A MUCH WIDER

600
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
SCALE.

601
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
OUR CHIEF METEOROLOGIST
RICK REICHMUTH IN THE

602
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
EXTREME WHETHER OR NOT

603
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
TONIGHT RICK?

604
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
>> WE ONE OF THESE LAST

605
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
JUNE IN D.C. IF YOU

606
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
REMEMBER THAT BIG EVENT.

607
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
MAJOR POWER OUTAGES THAT

608
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
LASTED MORE THAN A WEEK.

609
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
A DERECHO IS WHAT WE CALL.

610
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
THIS WE THINK THAT'S GOING

611
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
TO DEVELOP TONIGHT.

612
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
RIGHT NOW A PARTICULARLY

613
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
DANGEROUS SITUATION,

614
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
TORNADO WATCH IN EFFECT

615
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
HERE ACROSS PARTS OF IOWA

616
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
AND ILLINOIS.
WE THINK POTENTIALLY SOME

617
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
VERY LARGE LONG TRACK

618
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
TORNADOES WITH THAT THEN A

619
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS

620
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
SITUATION, SEVERE STORM

621
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
WATCH.
THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THAT

622
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
DERECHO WILL DEVELOP OVER

623
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS.

624
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
ANOTHER TORNADO WATCH IN

625
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
EFFECT UNTIL 10:00 P.M.

626
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
OVER PARTS OF OHIO AND

627
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
PENNSYLVANIA AS WELL.

628
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
THREE WATCHES WE ARE
LOOKING AT.

629
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
SOME OF THESE STORMS HAVE

630
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
BEEN SEVERE IN OHIO AND

631
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
SOME TORNADO WARNINGS STILL

632
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
ACROSS AREAS OF IOWA AND IN

633
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
TOWARDS ILLINOIS.

634
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
WE THINK THIS LITTLE

635
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
COMPLEX THAT YOU SEE THESE

636
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
STORMS OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO

637
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
RIGHT NOW ARE WHAT ARE

638
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING

639
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS

640
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
DERECHO, IT WILL VERY

641
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
RAPIDLY OVERNIGHT MOVE

642
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
ACROSS AREAS OF MICHIGAN,

643
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
INDIANA IN THROUGHOUT OHIO

644
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
AND EVENTUALLY BY THE

645
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
MORNING STILL BRINGING SOME

646
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
STORMS AND WIND ACROSS

647
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
PARTS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC.

648
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
THEN TOMORROW A

649
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
REDEVELOPMENT OF THIS STORM

650
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC AND

651
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
SOME VERY HEAVY RAINFALL.

652
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
TONIGHT, WE HAVE A HIGH

653
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER FROM

654
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000

655
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
OVER TOWARDS AROUND FORT

656
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
WAYNE.

657
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
TOMORROW IT MOVES FARTHER

658
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
OFF TOWARDS THE EAST AND

659
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
THE BULLS EYE WILL BE BIG

660
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
CITIES LIKE D.C., BALTIMORE

661
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
AND PHILADELPHIA.

662
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A LOT OF RAIN WITH THIS.

663
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
VERY SIGNIFICANT FLOODING

664
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
ALL THE WAY THROUGH FRIDAY

665
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
AS WELL IN TOWARDS MUCH OF

666
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THE NORTHEAST.

667
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
WE WILL TRACK THIS AGAIN

668
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
LATER ON IN THE HOUR.

669
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
RIGHT NOW FOX REPORT WILL

670
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
BE RIGHT BACK.

671
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000

WORKERS FOR NEARLY TWO

677
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
HOURS.

678
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW

679
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
HOW THE PLATFORM BUCKLED IN

680
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
THE MIDDLE OF IT SORT OF A

681
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000

FIREFIGHTERS AND OTHERS

683
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
RUSHED TO THAT ROOF TO

684
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
COMMUNICATE WITH THE TWO

685
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
MEN.

686
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
ONE CITY OFFICIAL SAID THE

687
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
MEN WORKED FOR THE

688
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
SCAFFOLDING COMPANY BUT HE

689
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
COULD NOT CONFIRM WHETHER

690
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
THEY WERE WINDOW WASHERS.

691
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
THOUGH WE THINK THEY WERE.

692
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
RESCUERS SAID THEY

693
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
EVENTUALLY MANAGED TO STRAP

694
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
THE TWO GUYS INTO HARNESSES

695
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
THEN REMOVED THE 4 BY

696
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
4-FOOT PIECE OF GLASS FROM

697
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000

SAFELY INSIDE.

700
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
EMERGENCY MEDICAL WORKER
SAYS THE TWO MEN ARE CALM

701
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
AND ALL SMILES ALL THIS FOR

702
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
US?

703
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.

704
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I GUESS FROM WHEN THEY WERE

705
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
WATCHING, THEY NOTICED ALL

706
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
THE EQUIPMENT AND

707
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
OUT THERE STANDS IN THE

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
LOBBY WAITING FOR THEM.

STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

715
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
WHY THAT COLLAPSED.

716
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000

COLORADO AND THEY ARE SO

725
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
BAD THAT OFFICIALS SAY THEY

726
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
JUST CAN'T TELL HOW MANY

727
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
HOMES THEY HAVE DESTROYED.

728
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
JUST ONE OF THOSE FIRES HAS

729
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
BURNED NEARLY 100 HOMES

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
FOLKS HAVE HAD TO EVACUATE.

732
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
ONE PERSON SAID THE ONLY

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000

756
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
WIND BLOWING IN TWO

757
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

758
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
UNAFFECTED AREA AND

759
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
DESTROYING MORE HOMES.

760
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
PUSH BACK TO SEE THE FIGHT

761
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
GOING ON BEHIND US HERE.

762
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
WE ARE WERE BACK IN THAT

763
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
AREA EARLIER.
TOLD WE HAD TO EVACUATE.

764
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
DROPPING FIRE RETARDANT

765
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
TODAY.

766
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
THAT GIANT PLANE CAN HOLD

767
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
UP TO 11,600 GALLONS OF

768
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
STUFF.
SHAWNEE WAS EVACUATED WITH

769
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
HER 12 CHILDREN.

770
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT SOME

771
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
FRIENDS HAVE LOST THEIR

772
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
HOMES AND WE HAVE HEARD

773
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
THAT THE FIRE IS PRETTY

774
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
CLOSE TO OUR AREA.

775
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

776
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
>> WHAT'S BEEN REALLY

777
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
FRUSTRATING FOR SOME FOLKS

778
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
IS THE MAIN EVACUATION

779
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
CENTER WHERE ALL THOSE

780
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
DISPLACED FAMILIES WERE

781
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
GOING ALSO HAD TO EVACUATE

782
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE

783
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
SMOKE.
THE GOVERNOR HERE HAS

784
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
DECLARED THREE OF THOSE

785
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
FOUR FIRES TO BE DISASTER

786
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
AREAS.

787
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
SHEP?
>> ALICIA, THANKS.

788
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
JURY SELECTION IN THE TRIAL

789
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000

KILLED THE UNARMED TEENAGER

793
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
TRAVON MARTIN IN

794
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
SELF-DEFENSE.

795
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
TODAY LAWYERS DISMISSED

796
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000

JURORS AND WE WILL SHOW YOU

798
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
WHY.

799
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
PLUS A.A.A. IS WARNING OF

800
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
A NEW DISTRACTION BEHIND

801
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
THE WHEEL.

802
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD BE

803
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
MORE DANGEROUS THAN

804
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
ACTUALLY TALKING ON A CELL

805
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
PHONE.
AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO

806
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
SEE THIS?

807
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
TAKING A BIG BITE OUT OF

808
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
YOUR BOAT:  THAT'SAS WE APPROACH THE

809
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
BOTTOM OF THE HOUR AND THE

810
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
TOP OF THEÑi NEWS.

AT OD, WHATEVER BUSINESS YOU'RE IN,
THAT'S THE BUSINESS WE'RE IN

812
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
WITH PREMIUM SERVICE LIKE ONE OF THE

813
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
BEST

814
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
ON-TIME DELIVERY RECORDS AND A LOW
CLAIMS RATIO

815
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
WE DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE YOUR

816
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
BUSINESS OUR BUSINESS.

817
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
OD. HELPING THE WORLD KEEP PROMISES.

818
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
VO: I've always thought the best part
about this country

819
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
is that we get to create our future.

820
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You get to take ownership of the choices

821
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
you make.

822
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The person you become.

823
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I've been around long enough to recognize
the people who are out there owning

824
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
it.

825
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
The ones getting involved and staying
engaged.

826
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
They're not sitting by as their life
unfolds.

827
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And they're not afraid to question
the path they're on.

828
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because the one question they never

829
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
want to ask is

830
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
"How did I end up here?"

831
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I started Schwab for those people.

832
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
People who want to take ownership

833
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
of their investments

834
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
like they do in every other aspect

835
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
of their lives.

836
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
>> Shepard: SO THEY ARE NOT

837
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
GOING TO NEED A BIGGER BOAT

838
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
JUST MINOR REPAIRS.

839
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
FISHERMEN LOOKING FOR MAKE

840
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
CO-SHARKS OFF THE COAST OF

841
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
NEW JERSEY GOT JUST EXACTLY

842
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
WHAT THEY WANTED BUT NOT

843
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
THE WAY THEY EXPLAINED IT.

844
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
>> ROD, I ACTUALLY MOVED

845
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
OUT OF THE WAY.

846
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
COURT SIDE BOW.

847
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
STARTED CHOMPING RIGHT ON

848
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
IN REACH ON THAT BOAT.

849
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
AND BROOMS.

850
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
SHARK REPORTEDLY 8 FEET

851
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
LONG WEIGHED MORE THAN

852
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
300 POUNDS.

853
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'M SHERT THIS IS

854
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
REFERENDUM.
A VOTE TO TURN PLANS INTO A

855
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
WILL MATCHETT SPARKS TWO

856
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
WEEKS OF DEMONSTRATIONS IN

857
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
WHICH FOUR PEOPLE HAVE

858
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
REPORTEDLY DIED.

859
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
HUNDREDS LELAND VITTERT

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
SPOKE WERE IS PROTESTERS.

861
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
GOVERNMENT IS CRACKING DOWN
ON REALITY AND THEY ARE NOT

862
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
HAVING IT.

863
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
RIOT.

864
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
BEFORE THE VIOLENCE STARTED

865
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
TWO WEEKS AGO.
>> I'M TERRIBLY ANGRY

866
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
BECAUSE THIS IS AGAINST

867
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
HUMAN RIGHTS.

868
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
>> MANY TOLD STORIES FROM

869
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN

870
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
DEMONSTRATORS VOLUMES OF

871
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
TEAR GAS AND RUBBER BULLETS

872
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
ARE BONFIRES.

873
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
TURKISH MINISTER MOST OF

874
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
THE DEMONSTRATORS ARE.

875
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
THEY ARE SINCERE.

876
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
THEY HAVE GOOD WELL

877
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
INTENTIONS BUT CREATE

878
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
PSYCHOLOGY OF FEAR.

879
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
THERE.
>> THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
PREPARED NOT ONLY FOR THE

883
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
RAIN BUT ALSO FOR THE TEAR

884
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
GAS.
WE HAVE GOT GUYS WITH

MAKESHIFT GAS MASKS AND

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
THEN THERE IS THESE YELLOW

888
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
HARD HATS THAT THEY HAVE TO

889
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
PROTECT AGAINST THE ROCK

890
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
AND RUBBER BULLETS THAT

891
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
WILL COME LATER.

892
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
>> WE ARE NOT MARGINAL.

893
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
NOT TERRORISTS, WE ARE JUST

894
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
LIVING IN THIS NORMAL

895
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
PEOPLE.

896
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
JUST DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.

897
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
>> WELL THE UNREST IN

898
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
TURKEY COULD HAVE A BIG

899
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
IMPACT ON THE CRISIS NEXT

900
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
DOOR IN SYRIA.

901
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER IS

902
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE

903
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
SYRIAN REBEL.
AND ANALYSTS SAY GOVERNMENT

904
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
RESPONSE COULD VERY MUCH

905
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
COMPLICATE PRESIDENT OBAMA

906
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
IN CIVIL WAR.

907
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
FOR THAT ANGLE WE TURN TO

TREAD HERE.

913
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
>> IT IS SHEP, BECAUSE ON

914
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
THE ONE HAND THE U.S. HAS

918
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS

919
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
THE SAME PRIME MINISTER ONE

920
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
ORDERED HIS SECURITY FORCES

921
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
TO CRACKDOWN ON THOSE

922
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
PROTESTERS.

923
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
USING WHATEVER MEANS IS

924
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
NECESSARY.

925
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
SO, AGAIN, WE HEAR U.S.

LISTEN.

931
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
