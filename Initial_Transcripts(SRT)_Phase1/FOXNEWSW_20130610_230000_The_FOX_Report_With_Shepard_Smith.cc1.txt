[000:01:47;19] HAD THE POWER TO WIRETAP  
[000:01:51;11] EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HE  
[000:01:52;07] WANTS AMERICANS TO KNOW HOW

[000:01:55;17] HAVE TO KEEP TABS ON EACH  
[000:01:57;11] AND EVERY ONE OF US.  
[000:01:59;15] 29-YEAR-OLD EDWARD SNOWDEN  
[000:02:00;15] SAYS THAT'S EXACTLY WHY HE  
[000:02:02;06] EXPOSED THE GOVERNMENT'S  
[000:02:03;00] PHONE AND EMAIL  
[000:02:04;04] SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS.  
[000:02:04;27] HE SAYS HE WORKED AS A  
[000:02:06;22] NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY  
[000:02:08;09] OFFICE IN HAWAII AS AN  
[000:02:09;24] EMPLOYEE OF A GOVERNMENT  
[000:02:11;08] CONTRACTOR.  
[000:02:11;24] HE INSISTS HE HAS DONE  
[000:02:12;25] NOTHING WRONG AND TELLS THE  
[000:02:14;09] GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER OF GREAT  
[000:02:15;08] BRITAIN HE WANTED TO TAKE  
[000:02:16;22] DOWN WHAT HE CALLS THE  
[000:02:19;01] ARCHITECTURE OF OPPRESSION.  
[000:02:20;15] >> I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO  
[000:02:21;20] SITS THERE DAY TO DAY IN  
[000:02:23;00] THE OFFICE, WATCHES WHAT'S  
[000:02:25;18] HAPPENING AND GOES, THIS IS  
[000:02:27;03] SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OUR  
[000:02:28;13] PLACE TO DECIDE.  
[000:02:29;12] THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO DECIDE  
[000:02:31;15] WHETHER THESE PEOPLE OR  
[000:02:33;02] POLICIES ARE RIGHT OR  
[000:02:35;15] WRONG.  
[000:02:35;28] SNOWDEN SAYS HE LEFT HIS  
[000:02:37;17] GIRLFRIEND BEHIND IN HAWAII  
[000:02:38;12] AND TOOK OFF FOR HONG KONG  
[000:02:40;01] THREE WEEKS AGO AFTER  
[000:02:41;06] COPYING THE DOCUMENTS HE  
[000:02:42;04] PLANNED TO RELEASE.  
[000:02:43;05] THEIR HOUSE IS NOW FOR SALE  
[000:02:44;10] IT TURNS OUT.  
[000:02:45;13] GIRLFRIEND SAID TO BE BACK  
[000:02:46;10] ON THE MAINLAND WEST COAST.  
[000:02:48;14] NEIGHBORS IN HAWAII SAY THE  
[000:02:49;24] COUPLE MADE SURE THAT  
[000:02:50;26] NOBODY COULD SEE INSIDE  
[000:02:53;17] THAT HOME EVERYTHING WAS  
[000:02:55;12] COMPLETELY BLOCKED.  
[000:02:56;07] LIKE A WALL OF BOXES ALL  
[000:02:57;26] THE WAY ACROSS.  
[000:02:59;27] >> Shepard: SNOWDEN SAYS HE  
[000:03:00;21] IS HOPING TO GET POLITICAL  
[000:03:02;22] ASYLUM.  
[000:03:03;06] MAYBE IN ICELAND THE HOME  
[000:03:05;01] BASE OF WIKILEAKS.  
[000:03:06;16] ICE ATLANTIC LAWMAKER AND  
[000:03:08;25] FREE SPEECH ACTIVIST SAY  
[000:03:10;09] THEY ARE TRYING TO GET IN  
[000:03:11;16] TOUCH WITH SNOWDEN TO MAKE  
[000:03:12;28] SURE ICELAND IS THE BEST  
[000:03:14;24] PLACE TO GO.  
[000:03:15;13] HE TOLD THE GUARDIAN ALL MY  
[000:03:17;03] OPTIONS ARE BAD.  
[000:03:17;23] WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE  
[000:03:24;06] CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS WITH  
[000:03:25;01] US TONIGHT AND JONATHAN  
[000:03:27;05] HUNT.  
[000:03:27;18] DO WE KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW.  
[000:03:30;19] >> TO THE BEST OF OUR  
[000:03:31;21] KNOWLEDGE, SHEP HE IS STILL  
[000:03:32;27] IN HONG KONG.  
[000:03:33;14] THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS  
[000:03:34;08] THAT HE SPENT SOME TIME AT  
[000:03:35;15] THE W HOTEL IN HONG KONG.  
[000:03:37;01] THERE WAS ANOTHER REPORT IN  
[000:03:39;27] THE "THE WASHINGTON POST"  
[000:03:40;20] TODAY THAT A RECEPTION AT  
[000:03:41;21] THE MIRROR HOTEL ALSO SAID  
[000:03:43;02] THAT SOMEBODY BY THE NAME  
[000:03:44;17] OF EDWARD SNOWDEN HAD BEEN  
[000:03:49;21] THERE AND CHECKED OUT  
[000:03:51;19] EARLIER TODAY ALL OF WHICH  
[000:03:53;01] FITS IN WHAT SNOWDEN  
[000:03:54;27] HIMSELF SAID HE IS LIKELY  
[000:03:56;04] TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS  
[000:03:57;09] LIFE AS A FUGITIVE.  
[000:03:58;24] LISTEN.  
[000:03:59;08] >> I CAN BE RENDERED BY THE  
[000:04:01;00] CIA.  
[000:04:01;12] I CAN HAVE PEOPLE COME  
[000:04:02;11] AFTER ME OR ANY OF THEIR  
[000:04:04;21] THIRD PARTY PARTNERS.  
[000:04:06;28] THEY WORK CLOSE WHETHER I A  
[000:04:08;00] NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONS.  
[000:04:09;11] THEY COULD PAY OFF THE TRY  
[000:04:10;21] ADDS OR ANY OF THEIR AGENTS  
[000:04:14;01] OR ASSETS.  
[000:04:14;17] WE HAVE A CIA STATION UP  
[000:04:15;14] THE ROAD.  
[000:04:16;03] THE CONSULATE HERE IN HONG  
[000:04:17;20] KONG, I'M SURE THEY ARE  
[000:04:19;00] GOING TO BE VERY BUSY FOR  
[000:04:20;28] THE NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S A  
[000:04:23;13] FEAR I WILL LIVE UNDER FOR  
[000:04:24;24] THE REST OF MY LIFE  
[000:04:26;03] HOWEVER LONG THAT HAPPENS  
[000:04:26;27] TO BE.  
[000:04:27;23] >> SNOWDEN SAID IN THAT  
[000:04:29;11] SAME INTERVIEW, SHEP, THAT  
[000:04:30;13] HE BELIEVES ABSOLUTELY THAT  
[000:04:33;28] HE DID NOTHING WRONG, SHEP?  
[000:04:36;12] >> Shepard: HE COULD BE  
[000:04:37;05] BROUGHT BACK TO THE UNITED  
[000:04:37;29] STATES.  
[000:04:38;13] BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S  
[000:04:39;08] VERY IFFY.  
[000:04:40;07] >> YEAH.  
[000:04:40;27] THERE IS AN EXTRADITION  
[000:04:42;17] TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED  
[000:04:44;07] STATES AND HONG KONG.  
[000:04:46;16] BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN  
[000:04:47;28] TESTED IN A CASE LIKE THIS.  
[000:04:49;09] AND THERE IS AN EXCEPTION.  
[000:04:50;14] IF THE AUTHORITIES IN HONG  
[000:04:51;23] KONG BELIEVE THAT AN  
[000:04:53;12] EXTRADITION REQUEST IS  
[000:04:54;25] POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ALL  
[000:04:56;09] OF WHICH ACCORDING TO THE  
[000:04:58;18] THE SUM HONG KONG BASED  
[000:05:00;05] LEGAL EXPERTS MAY HELP ED  
[000:05:03;00] SNOWDEN, LISTEN.  
[000:05:04;03] >> COMING TO HONG KONG IS  
[000:05:05;15] PROBABLY A GOOD DECISION  
[000:05:07;07] BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE  
[000:05:09;06] PROTECTIONS UNDER OUR  
[000:05:10;11] EXTRADITION LAW, THROUGH  
[000:05:11;05] THE COURT SYSTEM, AND THE  
[000:05:13;13] POLITICAL OFFENSE  
[000:05:14;03] EXCEPTION, BUT WE ALSO HAVE  
[000:05:15;16] STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR  
[000:05:16;22] PEOPLE MAKING ASYLUM  
[000:05:18;09] CLAIMS.  
[000:05:18;23] >> THEN, OF COURSE, SHEP  
[000:05:19;23] THERE IS CHINA.  
[000:05:20;19] IT DOES NOT COMPLETELY  
[000:05:22;26] CONTROL THE DECISION THAT  
[000:05:24;07] THE HONG KONG AUTHORITIES  
[000:05:25;01] MIGHT MAKE IN THIS CASE BUT  
[000:05:26;22] IT DOES HAVE INFLUENCE AND  
[000:05:29;01] THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MAY  
[000:05:30;07] HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR  
[000:05:32;10] WANTING TO KEEP EDWARD  
[000:05:34;08] SNOWDEN PRETTY CLOSE BY.  
[000:05:36;05] SHEP?  
[000:05:36;18] >> Shepard: YEAH, THAT  
[000:05:37;10] MAKES SENSE.  
[000:05:38;22] THANKS.  
[000:05:39;06] SNOWDEN ALSO TOLD THE  
[000:05:40;11] GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER CHINA IS  
[000:05:41;07] NOT AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED  
[000:05:42;27] STATES.  
[000:05:43;11] TEAM FOX COVERAGE  
[000:05:44;12] CONTINUES.  
[000:05:44;27] OUR CHIEF INTELLIGENCE  
[000:05:46;25] CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE  
[000:05:47;17] HERRIDGE FROM WASHINGTON  
[000:05:48;11] TONIGHT.  
[000:05:48;25] CAT.  
[000:05:49;08] >> SHEP, THAT PART OF THE  
[000:05:50;05] INTERVIEW TRY TO DEBUNK THE  
[000:05:51;14] WELL DOCUMENTED STRAINS  
[000:05:53;16] BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND  
[000:05:54;11] BEIJING IS INTRIGUING.  
[000:05:55;27] >> CHINA IS AN ENEMY OF THE  
[000:05:56;29] UNITED STATES.  
[000:05:57;29] IT'S NOT THERE ARE  
[000:05:59;02] CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE  
[000:05:59;24] UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT  
[000:06:00;27] AND THE CHINESE PRC  
[000:06:03;03] GOVERNMENT BUT THE PEOPLES  
[000:06:06;02] INHERENTLY, WE DON'T CARE.  
[000:06:07;03] WE TRADE WITH EACH OTHER  
[000:06:08;24] FREELY.  
[000:06:09;08] YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT AT  
[000:06:10;23] WAR.  
[000:06:11;06] >> A FORMER ATTORNEY  
[000:06:11;27] GENERAL SAYING THE LEAK  
[000:06:14;08] CASE COULD BE HANDLED BY A  
[000:06:15;19] JUNIOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  
[000:06:16;14] LAWYER BECAUSE SNOWDEN IS  
[000:06:18;05] APPARENTLY IMPLICATING  
[000:06:19;11] HIMSELF.  
[000:06:19;26] THE KEY IS GETTING TO  
[000:06:20;21] SNOWDEN BEFORE HE LEAKS  
[000:06:22;06] AGAIN AND BEIJING  
[000:06:23;25] INTERROGATES HIM.  
[000:06:24;17] >> WHEN YOU ARE ON CHINESE  
[000:06:26;00] TERRITORY YOU DON'T BARGAIN  
[000:06:27;16] WITH THE CHINESE.  
[000:06:28;18] YOU EITHER GIVE THEM WHAT  
[000:06:29;25] THEY WANT OR CONCEIVABLY  
[000:06:33;07] ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.  
[000:06:34;00] THEY ARE NOT REAL  
[000:06:35;16] SENTIMENTAL ABOUT STUFF  
[000:06:36;09] LIKE THAT.  
[000:06:36;24] >> A FORMER SENIOR NSA  
[000:06:38;29] OFFICIAL SAYING THE  
[000:06:39;20] INVESTIGATION WILL LIKELY  
[000:06:41;02] TAKE THE BIG DATA NSA  
[000:06:44;00] PROGRAM SNOWDEN COMPLAINS  
[000:06:45;06] OF AND TURN THEM ON HIM.  
[000:06:47;23] >> EVERYTHING WILL BE  
[000:06:48;29] AVAILABLE.  
[000:06:49;15] EVERY PLACE HE TOUCHED THE  
[000:06:50;25] SYSTEM ELECTRONICALLY,  
[000:06:52;19] TERMINALS, ACCOUNTS.  
[000:06:55;18] EMAILS BOTH IN THE SYSTEM  
[000:06:57;14] AND OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.  
[000:06:58;14] ANY AND ALL INFORMATION  
[000:06:59;12] RELATED TO ANY CONTACT HE  
[000:07:00;15] MAY HAVE HAD WITH REPORTERS  
[000:07:01;18] AND JOURNALISTS AND OTHERS  
[000:07:05;03] THEY WILL TURN HIS LIFE  
[000:07:06;12] INSIDE OUT AS THEY DID WITH  
[000:07:07;18] ME.  
[000:07:08;00] >> DRAKE SAYS THE CHOICE OF  
[000:07:09;05] HONG KONG MAKES A LOT OF  
[000:07:10;13] SENSE BECAUSE IT SHOWS  
[000:07:11;24] SNOWDEN WANTED TO BE AS FAR  
[000:07:13;11] OUT OF REACH OF THE U.S.  
[000:07:14;18] GOVERNMENT AS POSSIBLE,  
[000:07:16;01] SHEP.  
[000:07:16;14] >> Shepard: AS FOR SPYING  
[000:07:17;21] PROGRAMS, CATHERINE IT  
[000:07:18;14] SOUNDS LIKE LAWMAKERS ARE  
[000:07:19;08] ABOUT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT  
[000:07:20;14] THEM.  
[000:07:20;27] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:07:21;16] FOX NEWS CONFIRMING THAT  
[000:07:22;11] TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE FULL  
[000:07:23;06] HOUSE WILL BE BRIEFED BY

[000:07:30;13] CHRIS INGLIS ON THE  
[000:07:31;20] PROGRAMS.  
[000:07:32;05] >> WE HAVE OUR INTEL  
[000:07:33;05] COMMITTEE THAT GETS BRIEFED  
[000:07:34;03] BUT THE FULL CONGRESS DOES  
[000:07:35;16] NOT.  
[000:07:35;28] THAT'S WHY WE HAVE  
[000:07:37;10] REQUESTED TO BE BRIEFED  
[000:07:38;27] TOMORROW.  
[000:07:39;13] WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A  
[000:07:40;05] NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS  
[000:07:40;27] COMING DOWN FROM NSA,  
[000:07:42;04] ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE  
[000:07:43;29] FBI TO WALK THROUGH THE  
[000:07:45;05] ENTIRE CONGRESS MEMBERS  
[000:07:45;29] WHAT IS GOING ON.

[000:07:54;20] SIMILAR BRIEFING ALSO CLOSE  
[000:07:56;05] TO THE PUBLIC ON THURSDAY.  
[000:07:57;15] ASKED WHY THE BRIEFINGS ARE  
[000:07:58;20] NECESSARY GIVEN THE  
[000:07:59;20] PRESIDENT'S CLAIM ON FRIDAY  
[000:08:00;20] THAT EVERYONE IN CONGRESS  
[000:08:01;17] KNEW ABOUT THE PROGRAM.  
[000:08:02;24] THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN  
[000:08:04;02] DID NOT DIRECTLY ANSWER  
[000:08:04;28] THAT QUESTION SHEP.  
[000:08:06;22] >> Shepard: CATHERINE  
[000:08:07;14] THANKS VERY MUCH.  
[000:08:08;03] WALL STREET ALSO REACTED TO  
[000:08:10;02] THIS CONTROVERSY.  
[000:08:12;22] CONTROLLED THE LEAKER  
[000:08:13;26] TANKED IN THE EARLY DAYS.  
[000:08:17;14] ALLEN HAMILTON STOCK

[000:42:20;03] THERE UP IN THE AIR GETTING  
[000:42:21;07] PICTURES OF THIS.  
[000:42:21;26] WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THE  
[000:42:22;19] WEST END OF SKY HARBOR  
[000:42:25;25] AIRPORT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN.  
[000:42:26;28] THEY ARE TRYING TO GET

[000:42:32;26] SOME DIFFICULTIES.  
[000:42:33;18] YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW THAT

[000:42:36;12] WITHOUT INCIDENT AT ALL THE  
[000:42:37;20] PASSENGERS GOT OUT.  
[000:42:38;13] WE WERE TOLD IT WAS A VERY  
[000:42:40;15] CALM EXIT AND NOW WE ARE  
[000:42:41;16] BEING TOLD BY ONE OF THE  
[000:42:42;27] LOCAL AFFILIATES THERE THAT  
[000:42:44;04] THE PASSENGERS ARE INSIDE  
[000:42:45;08] THE TERMINAL SHEP, THEY  
[000:42:46;07] ARE HAVING TO FILL OUT  
[000:42:47;18] THESE FBI QUESTIONNAIRES.  
[000:42:49;07] WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT  
[000:42:50;19] THE QUESTIONS ARE.  
[000:42:52;04] IT MAY BE STANDARD  
[000:42:53;10] OPERATING PROCEDURE BECAUSE  
[000:42:54;04] THEY LEFT ALL OF THEIR  
[000:42:55;18] BELONGINGS ON BOARD THAT  
[000:42:56;26] PLANE.  
[000:42:57;09] THE PLANE NOW HAS A  
[000:42:58;22] SECURITY TEAM THAT IS ON  
[000:43:00;11] BOARD SWEEPING IT, LOOKING  
[000:43:01;17] FOR ANY KIND OF SECURITY  
[000:43:02;17] THREAT AT ALL.  
[000:43:04;04] HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A THREAT  
[000:43:05;04] TO BE CALLED IN BY A LOCAL  
[000:43:07;21] POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THEN  
[000:43:09;06] TRANSFERRED UP TO THE PILOT  
[000:43:10;05] AND THEN HE KIND OF MAKES  
[000:43:11;22] THE DECISION ON WHETHER TO  
[000:43:13;09] LAND.  
[000:43:13;22] BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT  
[000:43:14;23] JUST HAPPENED IN PHOENIX.  
[000:43:16;06] WE'RE NOW BEING TOLD THAT  
[000:43:17;11] ALL THOSE PASSENGERS WILL  
[000:43:19;09] BE REROUTED TO AUSTIN,  
[000:43:21;00] TEXAS SOON AS ANOTHER PLANE  
[000:43:23;20] BECOMES AVAILABLE.  
[000:43:24;19] THAT PLANE RIGHT THERE  
[000:43:25;21] WON'T GO ANYWHERE FOR THE  
[000:43:27;15] TIMENNING BECAUSE IT IS NOW  
[000:43:29;22] UNDER SURVEILLANCE OR AT  
[000:43:31;00] LEAST SECURITY WATCH TO  
[000:43:31;25] MAKE SURE THAT IT IS  
[000:43:33;20] TOTALLY CLEAR AND THEY HAVE  
[000:43:34;17] TO KIND OF DO THE TRIFECTA  
[000:43:36;22] OF CHECKING THE THREE  
[000:43:37;25] POINTS, IF YOU WILL,  
[000:43:38;25] L.A.P.D. FBI, AND THE FAA  
[000:43:40;23] WILL MAKE SURE EVERYTHING  
[000:43:42;22] IS FINE WITH THAT PLANE  
[000:43:43;25] BEFORE IT GOES AIRBORNE  
[000:43:45;26] AGAIN SHEP.

[000:43:53;24] >> Shepard: I WONDERED IF  
[000:43:54;20] THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT  
[000:43:55;19] MIGHT INSIDE  
[000:43:57;18] BECAUSE THEY HAVE KEPT IT  
[000:43:58;17] SO FAR FROM THE TERMINAL  
[000:43:59;26] YOU WONDER IF THE POLICE IN  
[000:44:00;24] LOS ANGELES HADN'T  
[000:44:01;23] SUGGESTED THERE IS  
[000:44:02;13] SOMETHING ON HERE THAT  
[000:44:03;06] MIGHT BE OF DANGER TO  
[000:44:04;06] PEOPLE IN THAT TERMINAL.  
[000:44:06;00] >> IT'S A GREAT POINT.  
[000:44:06;26] I MEAN, IT'S A GREAT POINT.  
[000:44:08;14] WHY NOT JUST BRING IT UP IF  
[000:44:10;24] THEY THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS  
[000:44:12;00] DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO LEAVE  
[000:44:13;05] IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE  
[000:44:14;16] TARMAC IT'S A VERY GOOD  
[000:44:15;19] POINT, BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU  
[000:44:16;23] WOULD BRING IT CLOSER TO  
[000:44:18;00] THE GATES.  
[000:44:18;18] THEY BROUGHT THE BUS OUT TO  
[000:44:20;01] THE PLANE.  
[000:44:20;19] OF COURSE, THEY BROUGHT THE  
[000:44:21;18] POLICE OUT TO THE PLANE.  
[000:44:22;22] NONE OF THE PASSENGERS BY  
[000:44:23;19] THE WAY ANY SUSPICIONS  
[000:44:25;04] RAISED ON ANY OF THEM THEY  
[000:44:28;07] WERE BROUGHT OFF ORDERLY  
[000:44:29;28] AND BROUGHT INSIDE THE  
[000:44:31;03] TERMINAL.

[000:44:33;28] TWEETED THAT THERE WAS VERY  
[000:44:35;07] HIGH SECURITY INSIDE THE  
[000:44:36;22] TERMINAL.

[000:44:38;20] PASSENGERS ARE KIND OF  
[000:44:39;25] BEING GROUND TOGETHER AND  
[000:44:41;18] QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT IT IS  
[000:44:43;00] THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING  
[000:44:43;26] OVER THE PAST 12 TO 24
