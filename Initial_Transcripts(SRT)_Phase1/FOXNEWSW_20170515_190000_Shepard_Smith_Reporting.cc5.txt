[000:00:00;717] THROUGH THAT PRESS BRIEFING.
[000:00:02;018] ANOTHER EXCITING ONE.
[000:00:03;520] WE WILL BE BACK HERE TOMORROW.
[000:00:04;721] JOIN US THEN AS WELL.
[000:00:06;022] I'M MELISSA FRANCIS.
[000:00:07;424] COMING UP NEXT HERE'S
[000:00:13;963] >> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE
[000:00:15;165] WEST COAST.
[000:00:15;999] 3:00 IN D.C. WHERE WE'RE
[000:00:17;767] WATCHING NEW FALLOUT OVER THE
[000:00:19;302] FIRING OF THE FBI DIRECTOR,
[000:00:21;805] JAMES COMEY.
[000:00:23;673] NOW SOME REPUBLICANS ARE
[000:00:25;742] REFUSING TO DEFEND PRESIDENT
[000:00:26;743] TRUMP OR CALL HIM OUT.
[000:00:28;244] LAWMAKERS TALKING ABOUT WHO THEY
[000:00:29;612] WANT RUNNING THE BUREAU NEXT.
[000:00:31;715] A PROFESSIONAL, NOT A
[000:00:34;217] POLITICIAN.
[000:00:34;984] ALSO, NEW ACCUSATIONS THAT THE
[000:00:37;287] SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD
[000:00:38;988] IS CARRYING OUTS EXECUTIONS
[000:00:41;725] AND HAS BUILT A CREMATORIUM TO
[000:00:46;362] HIDE EVIDENCE.
[000:00:47;030] AND NORTH KOREA MARKS A
[000:00:48;598] DANGEROUS AND NEW MILESTONE WITH
[000:00:50;333] ITS LARGEST BALLISTIC MISSILE
[000:00:53;103] FLIGHT SO FAR.
[000:00:56;639] THE NORTH KOREANS CLAIM THIS
[000:00:58;208] THING CAN CARRY A NUKE.
[000:01:02;112] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:07;751] FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK ON
[000:01:08;752] THIS BUSY MONDAY, THE WHITE
[000:01:10;487] HOUSE STILL WILL NEITHER CONFIRM
[000:01:12;856] NOR DENY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:01:15;125] HAS TAPES OF HIS CONVERSATIONS
[000:01:17;160] WITH THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR
[000:01:18;828] JAMES COMEY.
[000:01:19;896] ANALYSTS SAY THAT IS MAKING THE
[000:01:21;698] WHITE HOUSE'S EFFORT TO RESPOND
[000:01:23;399] TO CRITICISM OF HIS FIRING EVEN
[000:01:28;204] MORE DIFFICULT.
[000:01:29;072] THE SEARCH IS ON FOR A NEW FBI
[000:01:31;508] DIRECTOR.
[000:01:31;908] HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID
[000:01:34;210] ABOUT IT WHEN SPEAKING WITH THE
[000:01:36;780] CROWN PRINCE OF ABU-DHABI.
[000:01:44;788] >> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
[000:01:48;158] THANK YOU.
[000:01:49;993] >> Shepard: THAT'S TODAY.
[000:01:52;896] FRIDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNED
[000:01:58;134] JAMES COCMEY NOT THE SPEAK OUT
[000:02:01;504] ABOUT HIS FIRING.
[000:02:03;373] IT'S WORTH NOTING THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:04;808] PUT TAPES IN QUOTES THERE,
[000:02:07;777] SIMILAR TO WHEN HE PUT "WIRES
[000:02:11;447] TAPPED" IN MARCH WHEN HE MADE
[000:02:13;249] HIS UNFOUNDED CLAIM THAT
[000:02:15;084] PRESIDENT OBAMA ORDERED
[000:02:16;286] SURVEILLANCE AT TRUMP TOWER.
[000:02:17;787] THE PRESIDENT SAID THE USE OF
[000:02:19;689] QUOTES OPENED THE PHRASE TO A
[000:02:21;791] BROAD DEFINITION OF
[000:02:23;226] SURVEILLANCE.
[000:02:23;660] THE PRESIDENT USED "TAP" NOT IN
[000:02:26;596] QUOTES.
[000:02:26;963] SO FAR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT
[000:02:30;166] SAID WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT
[000:02:31;434] WHEN HE TWEETED ABOUT TAPES.
[000:02:34;204] SEAN SPICER SAID THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:35;805] HAD NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT
[000:02:37;207] ISSUE.
[000:02:37;507] THE REPUBLICAN SAID AT THE
[000:02:39;008] JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS,
[000:02:42;011] LINDSEY GRAHAM CALLED THE
[000:02:43;580] PRESIDENT'S TWEET INAPPROPRIATE
[000:02:45;014] AND THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO HAVE
[000:02:47;784] COMEY TESTIFY BEFORE THE PANEL.
[000:02:51;254] >> I WOULD ADVISE THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:52;589] NOT THE TWEET ABOUT THE
[000:02:54;090] INVESTIGATION AS WE GO FORWARD.
[000:02:56;192] THE RUSSIANS INTERFERED IN OUR
[000:02:58;995] ELECTION.
[000:02:59;362] I DON'T THINK THEY CHANGED THE
[000:03:00;463] OUTCOME BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS
[000:03:01;464] TO BACK OFF HERE AND LET THE
[000:03:03;766] INVESTIGATION GO FORWARD.
[000:03:04;767] WE NEED TO CALL COMEY AND GOT TO
[000:03:09;472] THE BET TOM OF THIS.
[000:03:10;440] >> Shepard: SENATOR GRAHAM SAYS
[000:03:11;708] HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE
[000:03:13;376] PRESIDENT IS THE TARGET OF AN
[000:03:15;845] INVESTIGATION INVOLVING POSSIBLE
[000:03:17;480] COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP
[000:03:18;548] CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIAN OFFICIALS.
[000:03:19;983] ON THE PRESIDENT'S SUGGESTION
[000:03:21;651] THAT TAPES MAY EXIST OF HIS
[000:03:23;686] CONVERSATIONS WITH JAMES COMEY,
[000:03:25;388] ANOTHER REPUBLICAN ON THE SENATE
[000:03:27;590] JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAYS HISTORY
[000:03:29;826] SHOWS US RESPECTS RECORDING
[000:03:31;027] THEIR CONVERSATIONS IS NOT
[000:03:32;662] NECESSARILY THE BEST IDEA.
[000:03:34;697] HERE'S WHAT SENATOR MIKE LEE OF
[000:03:38;067] UTAH TOLD CHRIS WALLACE ON "FOX
[000:03:40;870] NEWS SUNDAY."
[000:03:41;337] >> IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU THINK THE
[000:03:42;705] PRESIDENT SHOULD TURN OVER ANY
[000:03:44;307] RELEVANT TAPES TO THIS
[000:03:46;309] INVESTIGATION TO THE CONGRESS?
[000:03:48;678] >> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
[000:03:51;581] INEVITABLE, IF THERE ARE SUCH
[000:03:53;049] RECORDINGS.
[000:03:53;449] THEY WILL BE SUBPOENAED AND
[000:03:54;884] PROBABLY HAVE TO TURN THEM OVER.
[000:03:56;019] >> Shepard: WHEN IT COMES TO THE
[000:03:58;888] FIRING OF JAMES COMEY, NIKKI
[000:04:02;292] HALEY TOLD ABC'S "THIS WEEK"
[000:04:05;228] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A PRESIDENT
[000:04:07;030] OF ACTION.
[000:04:07;664] >> THE PRESIDENT IS A CEO OF THE
[000:04:10;700] COUNTRY.
[000:04:11;034] HE CAN FIRE AND FIRE WHOEVER HE
[000:04:12;468] WANTS.
[000:04:12;769] WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH IT OR
[000:04:14;437] NOT, IT'S THE TRUE.
[000:04:16;072] HE'S TRYING TO FIND HIS OWN
[000:04:17;740] TEAM.
[000:04:18;041] WERE THERE BETTER WAYS TO DO
[000:04:19;609] THAT?
[000:04:19;909] THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TO
[000:04:22;045] DECIDE.
[000:04:22;378] >> NIKKI HALEY.
[000:04:23;313] AS FOR THE POTENTIAL TAPES, SHE
[000:04:26;149] SAID SHE'S ASSUMES SHE'S BEING
[000:04:28;251] TAPED EVERYWHERE.
[000:04:29;585] JAMES COMEY HAS DECLINED AN
[000:04:32;188] INVITATION TO TESTIFY BEHIND
[000:04:33;489] CLOSED DOORS TOMORROW BEFORE THE
[000:04:34;791] SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE.
[000:04:36;025] BUT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND
[000:04:38;094] OTHERS ARE REPORTING HE'S
[000:04:39;629] WILLING TO TESTIFY AS LONG AS
[000:04:40;830] IT'S OUT IN PUBLIC FOR EVERYBODY
[000:04:42;532] TO SEE.
[000:04:43;132] ONE KEY ISSUE IS A WHITE HOUSE
[000:04:45;702] DINNER BETWEEN JAMES COMEY AND
[000:04:47;070] PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST DAYS AFTER
[000:04:49;172] THE INAUGURATION.
[000:04:50;206] THE.
[000:04:50;473] HAS ONE STORY.
[000:04:52;909] HE SAYS HE THOUGHT JAMES COMEY
[000:04:54;310] ARRANGED THE DINNER AND THAT
[000:04:57;547] COMEY TOLD HIM THE FBI WAS NOT
[000:04:59;849] INVESTIGATING HIM.
[000:05:00;383] THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND OTHERS
[000:05:02;051] REPORT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:05:03;886] INVITED JAMES COMEY AND THE
[000:05:04;654] PRESIDENT ASKED REPEATEDLY
[000:05:06;289] WHETHER THE FBI DIRECTOR WOULD
[000:05:07;724] PLEDGE A LOYALTY TO HIM.
[000:05:10;093] ACCORDING TO THE TIMES, DIRECTOR
[000:05:11;995] COMEY DECLINED.
[000:05:13;329] OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:15;365] CORRESPONDENCE JOHN ROBERTS IS
[000:05:16;099] LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:05:17;300] WHAT IS THE WHITE HOU SAYING
[000:05:19;168] ABOUT THESE POTENTIAL TAPES IF
[000:05:20;670] ANYTHING AT ALL?
[000:05:21;304] >> AS YOU POINTED OUT, SHEP,
[000:05:23;373] THEY'RE NOT SAYING A LOT.
[000:05:24;774] ABOUT ALL OF THE REPORTING GOING
[000:05:26;542] ON ABOUT TAPES, PEOPLE ARE
[000:05:28;711] SAYING WAS THERE AN OVAL OFFICE
[000:05:31;347] RECORDING MECHANISM MUCH LIKE IN
[000:05:33;383] THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION WHEN HE
[000:05:36;085] RECORDED PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS
[000:05:37;353] OF EVERYBODY THAT CAME IN.
[000:05:38;488] EVEN IF THERE WAS AN OVAL OFFICE
[000:05:40;957] SYSTEM, PROBABLY WOULDN'T
[000:05:41;991] PERTAIN TO THE COMEY MEETING
[000:05:43;693] BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE HAD
[000:05:45;762] MEETING DINNER IN THE ROOM OFF
[000:05:47;430] THE OVAL OFFICE AND MORE LIKELY
[000:05:49;665] EITHER IN THE RESIDENCE OR IN
[000:05:51;334] ONE OF THE OFFICIAL ROOMS IN THE
[000:05:52;702] MAIN MANSION HERE AT THE WHITE
[000:05:54;904] HOUSE.
[000:05:55;204] SO THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT THE
[000:05:56;773] PRESIDENT HAD SOME SORT OF
[000:05:58;074] RECORDING SYSTEM THAT WAS
[000:06:00;209] AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT MANSION.
[000:06:02;745] IT'S NOT KNOWN AT THIS POINT
[000:06:05;214] WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAYS "TAPES"
[000:06:07;183] ARE TALKING ABOUT A RECORDING
[000:06:09;018] DEVICE OR OTHER CONVERSATION OR
[000:06:10;953] MERELY TRYING TO PLAY WITH THE
[000:06:12;555] MEDIA THERE AND JAMES COMEY
[000:06:13;489] SAYING MAYBE THERE ARE TAPES.
[000:06:15;291] HERE'S WHAT SEAN SPICER SAID
[000:06:16;192] ABOUT IT AT THE BRIEFING A SHORT
[000:06:18;094] TIME AGO.
[000:06:19;829] >> IS THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDING
[000:06:24;867] TO FURNISH THAT INFORMATION AS
[000:06:27;703] REQUESTED IN WRITING?
[000:06:29;705] >> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING
[000:06:30;573] FURTHER ON THAT.
[000:06:31;507] >> DOES THAT MEAN THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:32;642] WILL DENY --
[000:06:33;910] >> I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THE
[000:06:35;878] PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE NOTHING
[000:06:37;613] FURTHER ON THAT LAST WEEK.
[000:06:39;949] >> IS THE SITUATION WITH THE
[000:06:41;818] LEGISLATIVE BRANCH --
[000:06:43;052] >> LISTEN, I MADE IT CLEAR WHAT
[000:06:45;154] THE PRESIDENT'S POSITION IS ON
[000:06:46;456] THAT ISSUE.
[000:06:47;824] HUNTER?
[000:06:48;224] >> SO THE PRESIDENT AND THE
[000:06:49;659] PRESS SECRETARY SAYING NOTHING,
[000:06:52;528] SHEP, WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE
[000:06:53;496] TAPES AND WHETHER OR NOT THE
[000:06:54;297] TAPES WOULD BE PROVIDED TO
[000:06:55;731] CONGRESS BECAUSE THERE ARE
[000:06:57;266] INDICATIONS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
[000:06:59;102] UP THERE ON CAPITOL HILL WOULD
[000:07:00;436] LIKE TO HEAR THEM IF THERE ARE
[000:07:02;105] TAPES.
[000:07:02;405] I WOULD PAUSE IT, SHEP, IT'S
[000:07:04;474] UNLIKELY THERE WOULD BE TAPES OF
[000:07:06;175] A DINNER UNLESS SOMEBODY HAD A
[000:07:08;511] RECORDING DEVICE NEARBY.
[000:07:10;146] THE TWO PHONE CALLS ARE A
[000:07:11;214] DIFFERENT STORY.
[000:07:12;248] ALL OF THE PRESIDENT'S PHONE
[000:07:14;383] CALLS ARE LOGGED AND SOME OF
[000:07:16;652] THEM ARE TRANSCRIBED, SHEP.
[000:07:18;554] >> WHAT ABOUT THIS MATTER OF
[000:07:20;256] DISCUSSION OF A POSSIBLE SPECIAL
[000:07:22;758] PROSECUTOR?
[000:07:23;159] KEN STARR, THE ONE THAT COMES TO
[000:07:25;928] MIND FOR MOST PEOPLE.
[000:07:27;730] THEY END UP EXPANDING
[000:07:30;299] INVESTIGATIONS.
[000:07:30;766] THERE'S REPUBLICANS ON BOARD?
[000:07:33;469] >> THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
[000:07:34;437] STATUTE AS APPLIED TO KEN STARR
[000:07:35;972] IS NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE.
[000:07:38;207] A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WOULD HAVE
[000:07:39;275] TO BE PROVIDED AND NAMED BY THE
[000:07:40;977] DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
[000:07:41;944] THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COMPLAINTS
[000:07:44;013] FROM DEMOCRATS ABOUT THE NEED
[000:07:45;615] FOR A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR OVER
[000:07:47;216] THE WEEKEND.
[000:07:49;051] SOME DEMOCRATS SAID THEY WOULD
[000:07:50;653] REFUSE TO CONSIDER THE NAME OF
[000:07:52;355] THE NOMINEE IN CONFIRMATION
[000:07:55;258] HEARINGS UNTIL A SPECIAL
[000:07:55;892] PROSECUTOR IS APPOINTED.
[000:07:58;728] I ASKED SEAN SPICER.
[000:08:00;029] HERE'S HOW HE RESPONDED.
[000:08:02;131] >> THERE'S FRANKLY NO NEED FOR A
[000:08:04;634] SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.
[000:08:06;369] YOU HAVE TWO SENATE COMMITTEES
[000:08:08;137] LOOKING INTO THIS, THE FBI IS
[000:08:10;273] CONDUCTING THEIR OWN REVIEW.
[000:08:11;607] AND I THINK IF YOU EVEN LOOK AT
[000:08:14;777] WHAT ACTING DIRECTOR McCABE
[000:08:18;447] SAID, THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES
[000:08:19;782] THEY NEED.
[000:08:20;883] >> ONE THING THAT DIDN'T COME UP
[000:08:22;919] AT THE BRIEFING, RECORDS OF A
[000:08:25;054] MASSIVE STAFF SHAKEUP.
[000:08:27;290] I'M TOLL A MASSIVE STAFF SHAKEUP
[000:08:33;930] IS "NONSENSE."
[000:08:36;265] THERE'S SOME TALK THERE MAY BE
[000:08:37;667] CHANGES TO THE COMMUNICATIONS
[000:08:38;935] SHOP AFTER WHAT HAPPENED WITH
[000:08:39;735] THE COMEY FIRING LAST TUESDAY.
[000:08:42;405] ALSO TOLD THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:08:44;874] CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS
[000:08:46;042] WHO HAS BEEN IN A LOT OF
[000:08:47;877] REPORTING "ON THE BUBBLE" SINCE
[000:08:50;813] JANUARY ALSO MAY NOT HOLD THE
[000:08:52;415] COMPLETE FAVOR OF THE PRESIDENT
[000:08:53;950] AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME.
[000:08:56;385] SHEP, WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE
[000:08:58;354] AND NOTHING HAPPENED.
[000:08:59;222] COULD BE ANOTHER CASE OF THAT.
[000:09:00;790] >> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS AT THE
[000:09:01;591] WHITE HOUSE.
[000:09:02;091] THANK YOU.
[000:09:04;627] LET'S GO TO JOSH GERSSTEIN.
[000:09:11;601] ANY NEW NEWS?
[000:09:13;603] >> I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING,
[000:09:15;438] SHEP, DURING THE BRIEFING THAT
[000:09:17;907] SEAN SPICER TRIED TO PUT
[000:09:19;175] TOGETHER ANOTHER RATIONALE FOR
[000:09:20;176] THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY SAYING
[000:09:22;211] THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT THAT
[000:09:24;080] FIRING COMEY WOULD BE DIFFICULT
[000:09:25;581] FOR THE PRESIDENT AND WOULD HURT
[000:09:27;617] HIM IN SOME WAY.
[000:09:28;951] BUT SUGGESTING AGAIN THAT MAYBE
[000:09:31;554] DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH
[000:09:33;022] THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION.
[000:09:34;557] SO SPICER TRYING TO STIR UP SOME
[000:09:36;292] DUST OVER THAT ISSUE AGAIN.
[000:09:40;463] >> Shepard: IS THERE ANY
[000:09:42;098] AGREEMENT NOW ON HOW THIS THING
[000:09:43;232] SHOULD GO FORWARD?
[000:09:44;267] IS IT SEPARATED COMPLETELY ALONG
[000:09:46;168] PARTISAN LINES?
[000:09:48;704] >> WELL, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME
[000:09:50;973] INDICATION THAT SOME REPUBLICANS
[000:09:53;709] MIGHT BE OPEN TO A SPECIAL
[000:09:55;278] PROSECUTOR AT A CERTAIN POINT.
[000:09:56;746] MARCO RUBIO SAID MAYBE WE'LL GET
[000:09:58;347] TO A POINT THAT THAT WOULD BE
[000:10:00;316] APPROPRIATE.
[000:10:00;716] THE ISSUE IS MUDDLED TOGETHER
[000:10:02;852] WITH THIS QUESTION OF
[000:10:04;053] REPLACEMENT OF THE FBI DIRECTOR
[000:10:05;554] WITH DEMOCRATS AS WE DISCUSSED
[000:10:07;590] EARLIER SAYING THEY WOULDN'T
[000:10:08;557] VOTE TO CONFIRM ANYONE UNTIL A
[000:10:11;093] SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS IN PLACE.
[000:10:12;695] THAT LEAVES OPEN THE QUESTION OF
[000:10:13;929] HOW THE WHITE HOUSE WILL GET
[000:10:15;631] SOMEBODY CONFIRMED FOR THE FBI'S
[000:10:17;867] DIRECTOR JOB.
[000:10:18;968] THOSE VOTES FOR DIRECTOR CON
[000:10:20;870] FORMATION VOTES OVER THE LAST
[000:10:22;338] 45, 50 YEARS HAVE BEEN
[000:10:24;273] UNANIMOUS.
[000:10:25;374] 98-0.
[000:10:26;609] 93-1 UNANIMOUS CONSENT.
[000:10:28;244] SO TO HAVE A PARTY LINE VOTE ON
[000:10:30;713] CONFIRMING AN FBI DIRECTOR WOULD
[000:10:32;481] BE AN EXTRAORDINARY DEPARTURE
[000:10:35;651] FROM WHAT'S GO ON IN THE RECENT
[000:10:38;487] DECADES.
[000:10:38;854] >> Shepard: ON THE LIST OF
[000:10:40;956] POTENTIAL CANDIDATES, A NUMBER
[000:10:43;559] OF PEOPLE, POLITICIANS AND
[000:10:45;594] JUDGES.
[000:10:45;928] THIS IDEA OF A POLITICIAN AS THE
[000:10:48;030] FBI DIRECTOR, IT'S A NEW ONE AND
[000:10:52;168] DOESN'T SEEM TO BE FARING WELL.
[000:10:54;670] >> IT DOESN'T.
[000:10:56;072] THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO
[000:10:57;373] STEP APART FROM SOME OF THOSE
[000:10:59;942] POSSIBILITIES LIKE WE HEARD
[000:11:00;976] SENATOR JOHN CORNYN WAS ONE OF
[000:11:02;878] THOSE INTERVIEWED AS I WAS
[000:11:05;147] REPRESENTATIVE MIKE ROGERS.
[000:11:06;515] I THINK THEY'RE BOTH HELD IN
[000:11:08;150] HIGHEST STEAM IN THE CONGRESS.
[000:11:09;585] YOU'VE HAD SENATOR LINDSEY
[000:11:10;853] GRAHAM AND SOME OTHERS SUGGEST
[000:11:12;555] THAT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO SET
[000:11:14;123] A NEW PRECEDENT OF HAVING A
[000:11:16;258] POLITICIAN AS FBI DIRECTOR.
[000:11:18;794] IT WOULD BE WISER TO PICK
[000:11:21;797] SOMEBODY FROM THE FBI'S RANKS OR
[000:11:24;066] A LONG-TERM PROSECUTOR AS WE'VE
[000:11:25;768] SEEN, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL,
[000:11:27;770] MAYBE HAS THE CRIMINAL DIVISION
[000:11:31;107] AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
[000:11:34;610] THOSE ARE A GREATER POSSIBILITY
[000:11:37;513] THAN A POLITICIAN.
[000:11:38;447] >> Shepard: REGARDING THE ISSUES
[000:11:39;682] THAT WE HEAR FROM PEOPLE DALE
[000:11:40;916] LIVE.
[000:11:42;551] WE DID FRIDAY, WE HAVE TODAY.
[000:11:44;387] THEN WE HEAR THE TALK OF PEOPLE
[000:11:46;188] HAVING GREAT CONCERN BEHIND THE
[000:11:47;823] SCENES.
[000:11:48;157] COULD YOU GIVE US WHAT YOU
[000:11:50;292] THOUGH ABOUT THIS SORT OF
[000:11:53;429] SENTIMENT?
[000:11:53;996] >> WELL, THERE'S NERVOUSNESS AS
[000:11:56;632] WE HEARD IN THE BRIEFING ABOUT
[000:11:58;634] THE TAPE RECORDING SYSTEM AND
[000:12:01;871] WHETHER THERE IS ONE OR ISN'T
[000:12:05;508] ONE.
[000:12:07;910] IT WAS JUST LIKE A FLAT OUT
[000:12:09;612] NONRESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:12:10;880] TODAY.
[000:12:11;180] THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT I
[000:12:12;314] THINK HAS STRUGGLED TO FIND
[000:12:14;016] PEOPLE TO JOIN ITS RANKS.
[000:12:16;218] SOME BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE
[000:12:17;386] NOT WILLING TO DO SO.
[000:12:18;654] IN OTHER CASES BECAUSE THEY MAY
[000:12:20;289] HAVE MADE STATEMENTS THAT WERE
[000:12:22;391] SEEN AS DISLOYAL TO PRESIDENT
[000:12:23;659] TRUMP.
[000:12:23;959] THEY WERE SCRATCHED FROM THE
[000:12:26;695] LIST.
[000:12:26;996] YOU LOOK AT THAT POOL AGAIN WHEN
[000:12:29;031] YOU CAN'T GET ASSURANCES THAT
[000:12:30;766] YOU'RE NOT BEING RECORDED IN
[000:12:32;168] YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN
[000:12:33;669] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:12:34;904] >> JOSH GERSTEIN FROM POLITCO.
[000:12:38;707] THANKS.
[000:12:39;041] >> THANKS, SHEP.
[000:12:39;775] >> Shepard: REPUBLICANS AND
[000:12:41;110] DEMOCRATS DON'T AGREE ON MUCH OF
[000:12:42;611] ANYTHING BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
[000:12:43;913] THE SEARCH OF THE NEXT HEAD OF
[000:12:46;115] THE FBI, THEY HAVE SEEMED TO
[000:12:47;950] FIND COMMON GROUND.
[000:12:49;084] AHEAD WHAT SENATORS OF BOTH
[000:12:50;953] SIDES ARE REQUESTING.
[000:12:52;154] WE'LL LOOK AT SOME OF THE TOP
[000:12:54;089] POTENTIAL CANDIDATES, INCLUDING
[000:12:57;593] MERRICK GARLAND, THE JUDGE
[000:13:00;362] REPUBLICANS REFUSED TO CONFIRM
[000:13:01;330] TO THE SUPREME COURT.
[000:13:02;231] THAT AND THE REST OF THE NEWS
[000:13:04;066] COMING UP FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK
[000:13:05;301] ON THIS MONDAY AFTERNOON.
[000:13:05;801] TECH: When your windshield
[000:13:05;801] needs to be fixed...
[000:13:09;538] trust Safelite AutoGlass.
[000:13:11;207] For these parents, driving
[000:13:11;207] around was the only way to get
[000:13:11;207] their baby to sleep.
[000:13:15;044] So when their windshield
[000:13:15;044] got cracked...
[000:13:16;779] CUSTOMER: We can't
[000:13:16;779] drive this car.
[000:13:18;447] TECH: ...they wanted it
[000:13:18;447] fixed right.
[000:13:20;049] So they scheduled with Safelite.
[000:13:22;284] Our exclusive TrueSeal
[000:13:22;284] technology means a strong,
[000:13:22;284] reliable bond,
[000:13:26;789] every time.
[000:13:27;923] At Safelite,
[000:13:27;923] we stand behind our work.
[000:13:30;459] Bye, bye.
[000:13:31;393] Because the ones you love,
[000:13:31;393] sit behind it.
[000:13:34;263] (PARENTS WHISPER JINGLE)
[000:13:34;263] Safelite repair, Safelite
[000:13:34;263] replace.
[000:15:43;058] >> Shepard: LAWMAKERS ON BOTH
[000:15:44;660] SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE URGING
[000:15:46;762] PRESIDENT TRUMP TO AVOID PICKING
[000:15:48;397] A POLITICIAN TO REPLACE JAMES
[000:15:50;532] COMEY IN THE FBI.
[000:15:52;334] REPUBLICANS SENATOR LINDSEY
[000:15:54;536] GRAHAM SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD
[000:15:55;971] PICK SOMEBODY WITHIN THE FBI
[000:15:57;840] RANKS.
[000:15:58;140] THE MINORITY LEADER, CHUCK
[000:16:01;377] SCHUMER, SAID THE NEW FBI
[000:16:02;778] DIRECTOR SHOULD BE SOMEONE OF
[000:16:04;079] NOT A PARTISAN BACKGROUND.
[000:16:06;915] FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SUPREME
[000:16:08;217] COURT NOMINEE, MERRICK GARLAND
[000:16:10;119] IS IN THE MIX.
[000:16:11;320] THE FORMER AID TO MITCH
[000:16:14;156] McCONNELL SAID THE SENATE
[000:16:15;357] MAJORITY LEADER SUPPORTS THE
[000:16:17;326] IDEA OF MERRICK GARLAND AS THE
[000:16:19;061] NEXT FBI DIRECTOR.
[000:16:20;396] EVEN THOUGH HE AND OTHER
[000:16:22;398] REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO HOLD
[000:16:27;236] HEARINGS FOR HIM AS A SUPREME
[000:16:28;437] COURT JUSTICE.
[000:16:29;805] CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS MORE.
[000:16:36;145] CATHERINE?
[000:16:36;512] >> MERRICK GARLAND, IS THAT A
[000:16:40;215] NAME THE PRESIDENT WOULD
[000:16:41;684] POSSIBLY CONSIDER IN THE MOVE TO
[000:16:43;318] NAME THE NEW FBI DIRECTOR?
[000:16:45;821] >> THE SEARCH FOR A NEW FBI
[000:16:49;358] DIRECTOR IS BEING HANDLED BY THE
[000:16:51;627] DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
[000:16:53;595] MY EXPECTATION WOULD BE AS THEY
[000:16:55;698] CONDUCT THAT SEARCH, THEY'LL
[000:16:57;499] PRESENT NAMES TO THE PRESIDENT.
[000:16:58;801] THEY'RE THE ONES LEADING THE
[000:17:00;803] EFFORT.
[000:17:01;136] >> A SENATE REPUBLICAN THAT SITS
[000:17:02;104] ON THE COMMITTEE THAT WILL
[000:17:03;639] HANDLE THE HEARINGS FOR THE NEXT
[000:17:05;274] FBI DIRECTOR SAID SUNDAY THAT
[000:17:07;876] GARLAND IS AN INSPIRED CHOICE.
[000:17:09;278] >> IT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION.
[000:17:11;313] ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS ABOUT IT.
[000:17:13;482] THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT POST
[000:17:15;117] THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
[000:17:17;319] UNITED STATES.
[000:17:17;853] IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WERE TO
[000:17:20;022] NOMINATE MERRICK GARLAND, HIS
[000:17:22;157] NOMINATION WOULD BE WELCOMED BY
[000:17:23;659] PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
[000:17:25;260] AISLE IN THE SENATE.
[000:17:26;762] >> THE ADMINISTRATION SOURCE
[000:17:29;565] TOLD FOX NEWS THE INTERVIEWS
[000:17:32;101] OVER THE WEEKEND WERE STRONG AND
[000:17:35;104] IMPRESSIVE.

[000:17:42;578] OFFICIAL OVERSEEING THE CRIMINAL
[000:17:44;847] DIVISION.
[000:17:45;214] THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NOMINATING
[000:17:47;082] THE FIRST WOMAN AS THE FBI
[000:17:48;617] DIRECTOR IS NOT LOST ON THE
[000:17:51;920] DECISION TEAM.
[000:17:53;522] >> Shepard: SOME OF THE OTHER
[000:17:56;759] CANDIDATES ARE FORMER FBIERS,
[000:18:04;867] THEMSELVES, VETERANS.
[000:18:05;768] >> OTHER CANDIDATES ARE ADAM

[000:18:34;296] BUSH APPOINTEE, HENRY E. HUDSON.
[000:18:37;966] OVER THE WEEKEND, REPUBLICANS
[000:18:40;202] AND DEMOCRATS URGED THE
[000:18:41;637] PRESIDENT TO AVOID A PARTISAN
[000:18:44;973] CHOICE.
[000:18:45;307] >> WHOEVER THE FUTURE DIRECTOR
[000:18:47;042] SHOULD BE IS A FUTURE LAW
[000:18:49;378] ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL.
[000:18:51;346] I HOPE THE PRESIDENT WON'T
[000:18:52;714] CHOOSE A POLITICAL NOMINEE.
[000:18:54;950] >> IT'S TIME TO PICK SOMEBODY
[000:18:56;852] WITHIN THE RANKS OR SUCH A
[000:18:59;655] REPUTATION THAT HAS NO POLITICAL
[000:19:01;523] BACKGROUND AT ALL THAT CAN GO
[000:19:02;558] INTO THE JOB ON DAY ONE.
[000:19:05;694] >> TODAY BRAD SHERMAN OF
[000:19:07;996] CALIFORNIA TOLD FOX NEWS THAT HE
[000:19:10;165] BACKS A SPECIAL COUNSEL AND
[000:19:12;734] COULD NOT WHAT SAY WHAT SENATE
[000:19:14;303] TACTIC MIGHT GET THEM THERE.
[000:19:15;571] THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE
[000:19:17;840] MAJORITY, SHEP.
[000:19:18;540] >> Shepard: THANKS, CATHERINE.
[000:19:20;576] A NEW LEGAL SHOWDOWN OVER THE
[000:19:22;344] PRESIDENT'S TRAVEL BAN.
[000:19:23;879] THE ORDER THAT WOULD SUSPEND THE

[000:19:39;761] U.S. CIRCUIT COURT HEARD
[000:19:44;299] ARGUMENT.
[000:19:44;666] THE UNUSUAL THING ABOUT THIS, IT
[000:19:47;436] WAS STREAMING LIVE AND A LOT OF
[000:19:49;338] NEWS CHANNELS TOOK IT.
[000:19:50;939] THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRYING
[000:19:52;341] TO PERSUADE THE COURT TO
[000:19:55;077] REINSTATE THE BAN.
[000:19:56;011] THE REAL ISSUE IS WHETHER
[000:19:57;579] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS
[000:19:58;780] BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE ABOUT
[000:19:59;915] BANNING MUSLIMS FROM THE COUNTRY
[000:20:02;017] AND ABOUT MUSLIM BANS IN

[000:20:09;958] GROUND TO RULE HIS ORDER
[000:20:13;262] UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
[000:20:14;997] SUPPORTERS SAY IT WOULD INCREASE
[000:20:16;698] NATIONAL SECURITY AND OTHERS SAY
[000:20:19;334] IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST
[000:20:23;438] RELIGION.
[000:20:23;805] SEAN SPICER SAID THE ORDER IS

[000:20:44;426] All finished.
[000:21:46;054] Umm...
[000:21:47;255] You wouldn't want your
[000:21:47;255] painter to quit part way,
[000:21:49;191] I think you missed a spot.
[000:21:50;892] so when it comes to
[000:21:50;892] pain relievers,
[000:21:52;160] why put up with
[000:21:52;160] just part of a day?
[000:21:54;329] Aleve, live whole not part.
[000:21:56;164] You want this color
[000:21:56;164] over the whole house?
[000:22:01;203] What's the best way to get
[000:22:01;203] V8 or a fancy juice store?s?
[000:22:03;338] Ready, go!

[000:22:05;440] with eggplant...
[000:22:07;542] Done!
[000:22:09;077] That's not fair.
[000:22:10;612] Glad I had a V8.

[000:22:17;352] but there will still be pain.

[000:22:18;820] company says they'll only pay
[000:22:21;590] three-quarters of what
[000:22:21;590] it takes to replace it.
[000:22:24;259] What are you supposed to do?
[000:22:25;494] Drive three-quarters of a car?
[000:22:27;529] Now if you had Liberty Mutual
[000:22:27;529] New Car Replacement™,
[000:22:29;998] you'd get your whole car back.
[000:22:32;534] I guess they don't want you
[000:22:32;534] driving around on three wheels.
[000:22:35;604] Smart.

[000:24:24;463] IT HOLDS THEM HOSTAGE AND

[000:37:59;176] NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND THE AUTHOR
[000:38:01;612] OF "NUCLEAR NIGHTMARES."
[000:38:04;749] JOE, NICE TO SEE YOU.
[000:38:05;983] >> PLEASURE, SHEP.
[000:38:07;051] >> Shepard: WHERE ARE WE IN THE
[000:38:08;786] LONG ARM OF TROUBLES WITH NORTH
[000:38:10;121] KOREA?
[000:38:10;454] >> IN IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD TO
[000:38:13;658] NORTH KOREA.
[000:38:14;058] THE MOST DANGEROUS TEST THEY
[000:38:15;226] HAVE DONE YET.
[000:38:15;926] >> Shepard: WHY?
[000:38:16;427] >> DEMONSTRATING NEW
[000:38:18;929] CAPABILITIES.
[000:38:19;363] IT DIDN'T TRAVEL VERY FAR BUT
[000:38:22;500] THAT'S BECAUSE IT TOOK A LOFTED
[000:38:26;604] TRAJECTORY.
[000:38:27;004] WENT STRAIGHT UP AND CAME
[000:38:28;039] STRAIGHT DOWN.
[000:38:28;673] IT TRAVELED ABOUT 500 MILES, THE
[000:38:31;475] DISTANCE FROM MAINE TO
[000:38:33;277] WASHINGTON D.C., IF YOU FLATTEN
[000:38:34;545] THAT OUT.
[000:38:35;046] YOU GET TO IT 2,500 MILES AND
[000:38:39;850] THE WIDTH OF THE UNITED STATES
[000:38:41;052] AND COULD TRAVEL THAT IN ABOUT
[000:38:42;286] 30 MINUTES.
[000:38:43;354] WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS,
[000:38:46;123] WHY IT TOOK THE TRAJECTORY.
[000:38:48;292] THEY RETESTED A RE-ENTRY
[000:38:50;328] VEHICLE.
[000:38:50;661] WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.
[000:38:52;129] ONE OF THE OBSTACLES IS NOT ONLY
[000:38:55;833] GETTING SOMETHING IN SPACE BUT
[000:38:58;102] BRING IT BACK DOWN AND SURVIVE
[000:38:59;837] THE HEAT.
[000:39:00;671] THIS TEST MIMICKED WHAT IT WOULD
[000:39:03;441] BE LIKE IN ICBM RANGE, THE HEAT
[000:39:06;444] AND STRESS OF REENTRY AND THEY
[000:39:08;479] APPARENTLY HAD A SUCCESSFUL TEST
[000:39:11;349] OF THEIR REENTRY VEHICLE
[000:39:14;151] TECHNOLOGY.
[000:39:14;719] FINALLY, A STEPPING STONE ON THE
[000:39:16;187] WAY TO THAT LONGER MISSILE.
[000:39:18;422] VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY THE
[000:39:20;624] CHINESE DEVELOPED THEIR LONG
[000:39:21;659] RANGE MISSILE.
[000:39:22;560] THEY HAD A MISSILE LIKE THIS
[000:39:25;162] CALLED THE DX 3.
[000:39:26;564] WENT ABOUT THIS LONG.
[000:39:28;032] A FEW YEARS LATER, THEY FOLLOWED
[000:39:30;301] BY THE 4 AND USED THAT AS THE
[000:39:33;604] FIRST STAGE OF THEIR
[000:39:34;405] INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
[000:39:35;072] MISSILE.
[000:39:35;840] THAT IS WHAT WE THINK NORTH
[000:39:38;809] KOREA IS UP TO.
[000:39:40;244] >> Shepard: WE NEED DEES CALATIN
[000:39:45;916] HERE.
[000:39:46;217] ARE THE CHINESE A PARTNER IN
[000:39:49;687] THAT?
[000:39:49;987] >> THEY'RE DEFINITELY A PARTNER.
[000:39:51;856] THEY WON'T TAKE CARE OF THE
[000:39:53;190] PROBLEM FOR US.
[000:39:54;024] THEY WILL PUT ON MORE SANCTIONS
[000:39:55;826] AND MORE PRESSURE.
[000:39:57;661] THEY AND RUSSIA, AS PUTIN
[000:39:59;363] AFFIRMED TODAY, DON'T WANT TO
[000:40:00;931] SEE A NUCLEAR ARMED NORTH KOREA
[000:40:03;701] CONTINUING TO TEST LIKE THIS,
[000:40:04;802] BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PUT
[000:40:06;704] SANCTIONS ON TO CAUSE THE NORTH
[000:40:08;873] KOREAN REGIME TO COLLAPSE.
[000:40:09;774] THAT IS SENDING MILLIONS OF
[000:40:12;943] REFUGEES INTO CHINA
[000:40:14;445] DESTABILIZING IT, CREATING
[000:40:16;714] CHAOS.
[000:40:17;014] THEY WANT THE UNITED STATES TO
[000:40:18;282] MEET WITH NORTH KOREA TO
[000:40:20;785] NEGOTIATE SOME AGREEMENT.
[000:40:23;120] THAT IS THE COMPROMISE.
[000:40:25;723] PRESSURE PLUS ENGAGEMENT COULD
[000:40:28;993] STOP THE PROGRAM.
[000:40:31;195] >> THANKS, JOE.
[000:40:33;898] >> Shepard: THANKS.
[000:40:36;901] AND SEAN SPICER SAID THAT
[000:40:40;871] ASSAD'S REGIME IS MURDERING
[000:40:45;543] THOUSANDS AND BURNING BODIES TO
[000:40:47;845] COVER IT UP APPARENTLY WITH
[000:40:49;947] SUPPORT FROM RUSSIA AND IRAN.
[000:40:52;716] THEY RELEASED THE PICTURES OF
[000:40:57;421] THE PRISON WITH THE CREMATORIUM.
[000:41:03;961] OFFICIALS SAY SYRIANS ARE
[000:41:05;463] HANGING AS MANY AS 50 PEOPLE A
[000:41:06;664] DAY THERE.
[000:41:07;631] THIS IS ABOUT A 45 MINUTE DRIVE
[000:41:10;634] FROM DAMASCUS.
[000:41:12;736] THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS APPALLED
[000:41:14;605] BY THE ATROCITIES LIKE THIS.
[000:41:17;041] AFTER LAST MONTH'S GAS ATTACKS
[000:41:18;676] THAT KILLED DOZENS, THE AIR
[000:41:20;511] FORCE BOMBED A SYRIAN AIR BASE.
[000:41:24;448] RICH EDSON IS AT THE STATE
[000:41:26;183] DON'T.
[000:41:26;584] RICH?
[000:41:26;884] >> THE ADMINISTRATION POINTS TO
[000:41:27;785] THREE PHOTOS TAKEN OVER A
[000:41:30;120] FOUR-YEAR PERIOD.
[000:41:31;288] THE STATE DEPARTMENT SHOWED THAT
[000:41:32;823] THEY DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY SAY
[000:41:34;725] IS A CREMATORIUM OF BUILDINGS ON
[000:41:37;161] THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE COMPLEX.
[000:41:39;063] THE U.S. CLAIMS THE PHOTOS SHOW
[000:41:41;265] A PROBABLE AIR INTAKE, FIRE WALL
[000:41:43;667] AND DISCHARGE STACK.
[000:41:44;835] ONE FINAL PHOTO SHOWS MELTING
[000:41:46;504] SNOW ON THE ROOF OF THIS
[000:41:48;806] BUILDING LIKELY, ACCORDING TO
[000:41:50;207] THE ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE
[000:41:51;442] HEAT OF A CREMATORIUM BURNING
[000:41:53;911] VICTIMS.
[000:41:54;411] U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY CANNOT
[000:41:56;347] RULE OUT THE HEAT IS FROM
[000:41:57;915] ANOTHER SOURCE AND CANNOT SAY
[000:41:59;583] FOR CERTAIN THAT IT'S A
[000:42:01;986] CREMATORIUM.
[000:42:02;386] ALL THOSE THEY'RE USING THE
[000:42:04;088] PICTURES AND INTELLIGENCE.
[000:42:05;890] THE STATE DEPARTMENT CITING
[000:42:07;191] REPORTS THAT THE ASSAD REGIME
[000:42:10;127] HAS ABDUCTED MORE THAN 100,000
[000:42:12;663] AND PUTS 70 IN A PRISONERS
[000:42:17;868] DESIGNED FOR FIVE.
[000:42:19;703] AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL SAYS
[000:42:22;506] BETWEEN 5,000 AND 13,000 PEOPLE
[000:42:24;308] HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS
[000:42:25;943] FACILITY FROM 2011-15, SHEP.
[000:42:28;345] >> Shepard: NOT BRAND NEW
[000:42:29;313] INFORMATION, RICH.
[000:42:29;980] I WONDER IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO
[000:42:31;949] MAKE OF THE TIMING OF THIS.
[000:42:34;184] >> IT'S ALL TOO PRESSURE RUSSIA.
[000:42:36;487] LAST WEEK, SERGEY LAVROV WAS AT
[000:42:38;622] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:42:40;491] THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS THE
[000:42:42;726] RUSSIANS TO REIGN IN THE ASSAD
[000:42:44;795] REGIME.
[000:42:45;129] THIS IS A WAY OF PUBLICLY
[000:42:47;464] PRESSURING RUSSIA.
[000:42:47;998] PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS
[000:42:49;900] SAYING RUSSIA CANNOT ALLOW THE
[000:42:52;403] ATROCITIES TO CONTINUE AND THEY
[000:42:53;604] WANT RUSSIA TO LEAD ON THE ASSAD
[000:42:58;075] REGIME TO STOP IT.
[000:42:58;909] >> Shepard: THANKS, RICH.

[000:43:02;046] BROUGHT US SCORPIONS ON PLAINS

[000:46:24;148] UNITED AIRLINES RECORDED THEIR
[000:46:26;450] COCKPITS ARE SECURE.
[000:46:27;351] THOUGH A FLIGHT ATTENDANT DID
[000:46:30;654] POST SECURITY CODES FOR THE
[000:46:34;892] COCKPITS ONLINE.
[000:46:36;126] WHOOPS.
[000:46:38;629] UNITED UTILIZES A NUMBER OF
[000:46:41;999] MEASURES TO KEEP SAFE.
[000:46:43;500] IN THE INTERIM, THIS PROTOCOL
[000:46:45;869] ASSURES OUR COCKPITS REMAIN
[000:46:48;906] SECURITY.
[000:46:49;339] IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE MONTHS
[000:46:50;908] FOR UNITED.
[000:46:52;476] THERE'S BEEN SCORPIONS ON PLANES
[000:46:54;578] AND SECURITY OFFICERS DRAGGED A
[000:46:57;114] PASSENGER OFF OF ANOTHER FLIGHT.
[000:46:58;816] THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK'S GERRI
[000:47:00;551] WILLIS IS HERE.
[000:47:01;285] WHAT ARE WE GETTED FROM  UNITED?
[000:47:09;827] >> THEY SAY THE INFORMATION WAS
[000:47:11;528] SHARED INADVERTENTLY BUT NOT A
[000:47:13;831] BREACH.
[000:47:14;164] I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE SUPPOSED
[000:47:14;965] TO BE ASSURED BY THIS.
[000:47:16;500] EITHER WAY, IT'S NOT GOOD.
[000:47:18;035] YOU DON'T WANT THIS INFORMATION
[000:47:19;903] IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
[000:47:21;171] WE THINK IT'S A BREACH, THAT
[000:47:25;042] SOMEBODY PROBABLY STOLE THE
[000:47:26;210] INFORMATION.
[000:47:26;610] BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
[000:47:27;377] IT WAS A UNITED EMPLOYEE.
[000:47:28;912] A CALL FOR MORE PROTECTION FROM
[000:47:31;148] THE PILOT'S UNION SAYING THEY'VE
[000:47:32;883] BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE
[000:47:36;153] INSTALLATION OF SECONDARY
[000:47:38;755] BARRIERS FOR 16 YEARS.
[000:47:40;224] >> Shepard: SECONDARY BARRIERS.
[000:47:42;426] >> ANOTHER STEP THAT WOULD KEEP
[000:47:43;927] PEOPLE FROM GETTING THROUGH THAT
[000:47:45;762] DOOR.
[000:47:46;063] THERE'S SOME STUFF THAT ARE LIKE
[000:47:47;865] THAT.
[000:47:48;165] THERE'S CHIMES THAT PILOTS CAN
[000:47:49;333] USE TO FIND OUT WHO IS COMING
[000:47:51;335] IN.
[000:47:51;602] THEY CAN STOP SOMEBODY THAT HAS
[000:47:52;636] THE RIGHT CODE FROM COMING IN.
[000:47:54;471] THERE ARE BARRIERS.
[000:47:55;505] BUT PILOTS THINK IT'S NOT
[000:47:57;507] ENOUGH.
[000:47:58;075] >> IS UNITED BEEN FULLY
[000:47:59;943] FORTHCOMING ON THIS MATTER?
[000:48:01;078] >> NO.
[000:48:01;712] I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
[000:48:03;046] YOU PROBABLY DO, TOO.
[000:48:05;916] WHERE WAS THIS STUFF PUBLISHED?
[000:48:07;517] IT WAS ON A WEBSITE SOMEWHERE,
[000:48:10;621] INADVERTENT.
[000:48:11;021] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WEBSITE.
[000:48:12;122] HAS A UNITED EMPLOYEE BEEN
[000:48:14;358] GROUNDED OR SUSPENDED?
[000:48:19;029] PUNISHED?
[000:48:19;396] WE DON'T KNOW.
[000:48:19;863] HOW INADVERTENTLY -- HOW DO YOU
[000:48:22;833] DO THAT?
[000:48:24;234] INADVERTENTLY POST SOMETHING.
[000:48:25;402] UNITED NATIONS ABOUT YOU BUT I
[000:48:26;436] CAN BARELY SIGN ON TO MY
[000:48:28;772] COMPUTER.
[000:48:29;139] >> BUT IT'S FINE.
[000:48:29;673] DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
[000:48:31;308] IF YOU DIDN'T NEED IT, WHY WAS
[000:48:32;609] IT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?
[000:48:34;211] >> A GREAT QUESTION, NOT
[000:48:38;215] ANSWERED.
[000:48:38;582] >> GET THE SCORPIONS --
[000:48:40;951] >> DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE BUNNY.
[000:48:43;487] >> Shepard: FRIGHTENING ALMOST.
[000:48:45;255] VERY LARGE.
[000:48:46;490] FRIGHTENING IN ITS SCOPE.
[000:48:47;724] >> SPECIAL AND BIG.
[000:48:48;759] >> Shepard: IT WON'T BE THE
[000:48:49;860] SAME.
[000:48:50;160] >> I KNOW.
[000:48:51;328] >> Shepard: THANK YOU, GERRI
[000:48:53;130] WILLIS.
[000:48:53;530] HERE IN NEW YORK CITY, A LOT OF
[000:48:55;766] PEOPLE DON'T OWN CARS.
[000:48:57;100] MOST PEOPLE I KNOW DON'T.
[000:48:58;769] THEY GET AROUND WITH THE SUBWAY
[000:49:00;270] OR YELLOW CABS OR SOMETHING.
[000:49:03;507] IMAGINE THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY,
[000:49:04;908] WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT GAS OR
[000:49:06;610] INSURANCE OR PARKING WHICH
[000:49:08;812] COSTLY ROUGHLY 17 GAZILLION
[000:49:11;848] DOLLARS.
[000:49:12;182] A NEW REPORT PREDICTS MORE
[000:49:16;453] AMERICANS WILL GIVE UP THEIR
[000:49:18;188] CARS.
[000:49:18;755] I MEAN LIKE MOST OF THEM.
[000:49:22;492] SOON!
[000:49:22;859] KENNEDY EXPLAINS ME NEXT.
[000:49:47;884] It's just a burst pipe,
[000:49:47;884] I could fix it.
[000:49:49;720] (laugh)
[000:49:52;289] No.
[000:49:53;323] With Claim RateGuard
[000:49:53;323] your rates won't go up
[000:49:54;958] just because of a claim.
[000:49:57;594] I totally could've -
[000:49:58;328] No!
[000:49:59;229] Switching to Allstate
[000:49:59;229] is worth it.
[000:52:42;559] >> LOT OF CHANGE IN TEN YEARS.
[000:52:44;261] A DECADE AGO, WE DIDN'T HAVE THE
[000:52:45;962] iPHONE.
[000:52:46;696] BY THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE,
[000:52:49;199] WE MAY NOT OWN CARS.
[000:52:50;901] THAT'S ACCORDING TO A GROUP
[000:52:52;836] AFFILIATED WITH STANFORD
[000:52:55;505] UNIVERSITY.
[000:52:56;239] RETHINK X PREDICTS THIS.
[000:52:57;974] BY THE YEAR 2030, THE VAST
[000:53:00;477] MAJORITY OF US WILL ORDER
[000:53:02;612] SELF-DRIVING CARS LIKE THESE ON
[000:53:05;182] DEMAND.
[000:53:05;515] BEST PART, THOSE RIDES COULD BE
[000:53:08;952] FREE.
[000:53:10;954] KENNEDY IS HERE HOST OF
[000:53:13;590] "KENNEDY" ON THE FOX BUSINESS
[000:53:15;492] NETWORK.
[000:53:15;825] I LIKE A FREE RIDE.
[000:53:17;494] >> THE FUTURE IS NOW.
[000:53:19;095] THERE'S NO LONGER FUTURESTS.
[000:53:21;198] THEY'RE PRESENTISTS BECAUSE FOR
[000:53:24;000] DECADES AND GENERATION, THAT'S
[000:53:25;402] WHEN WE WOULD SEE THE SHIFT IN
[000:53:27;537] THE MASSIVE PARADIGMS IN
[000:53:29;639] TRANSPORTATION.
[000:53:30;106] WHAT WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT
[000:53:31;575] WHEN THE AUTOMOBILE CAME TO BE
[000:53:33;343] HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO OWN HORSE
[000:53:34;377] WOULD BE LIKE NO ONE WILL EVER
[000:53:36;379] GIVE UP THEIR HORSE.
[000:53:37;280] IT TURNS OUT, THEY WERE WRONG.
[000:53:39;549] YOU DON'T SEE TOO MANY FERRIERS
[000:53:43;086] NOWADAYS.
[000:53:43;453] >> NOT LIKE FIVE OR TEN YEARS
[000:53:45;488] AGO.
[000:53:45;789] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:53:46;289] >> Shepard: THE IDEA HERE IS
[000:53:47;357] THIS HAPPENS REALLY FAST.
[000:53:49;693] BECAUSE THESE BIG COMPANIES COME
[000:53:50;660] IN AND CHANGE THE WAY WE MOVE
[000:53:53;330] AROUND.
[000:53:53;663] SAVE US MONEY THAT WE CAN SPEND
[000:53:55;599] ON OTHER THINGS.
[000:53:57;367] CHANGES THE OIL INDUSTRY, THE
[000:53:59;502] AUTO INDUSTRY.
[000:54:00;670] >> YES.
[000:54:02;739] THEY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WILL BE
[000:54:07;877] POWERED BY THE SUN AND POWER
[000:54:10;313] PLANTS WHICH WILL BE MOSTLY
[000:54:11;615] SOLAR IN 10, 15, 20 YEARS.
[000:54:14;117] THAT MEANS THE AUTOMOBILE
[000:54:15;118] INDUSTRY AS WE KNOW IT AS WELL
[000:54:16;820] AS THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AS WE
[000:54:18;021] KNOW IT WILL HAVE TO CHANGE
[000:54:20;357] DRASTICALLY.
[000:54:20;757] THESE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO
[000:54:21;758] HAVE TO GET A MOVE ON.
[000:54:23;293] THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND SEE
[000:54:24;894] THESE CHANGES IN ADVANCE IN
[000:54:26;763] ORDER TO SURVIVE.
[000:54:29;332] BLOCKBUSTER DIDN'T SURVIVE.
[000:54:32;068] NETFLIX BECAME A VERTICALLY
[000:54:34;237] INTEGRATED STUDIO AND THEY'RE
[000:54:35;238] STILL ALIVE TODAY.
[000:54:36;206] WHO WILL BE ALIVE WHEN THE NEXT
[000:54:38;742] MAJOR SHIFT HAPPENS IN
[000:54:40;777] AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTION?
[000:54:41;978] >> Shepard: SOUNDS LIKE
[000:54:42;812] EVERYBODY BUT ME.
[000:54:43;346] >> I STILL LOVE A CAR.
[000:54:45;048] I THINK IN 20 YEARS I'LL BE IN
[000:54:47;617] THE MINORITY.
[000:54:49;653] A GREAT DRIVER, SHEP.
[000:54:51;321] >> Shepard: WHY WOULD THE RIDE
[000:54:52;422] BE FREE?
[000:54:52;989] >> THAT'S WISHFUL THINKING ON
[000:54:54;691] THE FUTURE IST RIDERS PARTS.
[000:55:02;899] I THINK THE GOVERNMENT WILL
[000:55:04;301] SUBSIDIZE THE AEV.
[000:55:06;202] BUT WHEN GOVERNMENT GETS
[000:55:07;604] INVOLVED, IT STIFLES INNOVATION.
[000:55:09;639] WE WANT FLYING CARS.
[000:55:10;674] >> Shepard: WE CAN'T HAVE FLYING
[000:55:12;108] CARS.
[000:55:12;409] >> I THINK WE CAN.
[000:55:14;010] I'M AN OPTIMIST.
[000:55:15;812] I EMBRACE OR ROBOT OVER-LORDS
[000:55:18;381] AND ANY FORM THEY TAKE,
[000:55:21;451] ESPECIALLY ONE WINGED.
[000:55:22;652] >> Shepard: IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
[000:55:24;220] THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL CHANGE
[000:55:25;722] THAT QUICKLY.
[000:55:26;890] THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO
[000:55:29;159] CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE WAY
[000:55:30;860] WE WANDERED HITHER AND FRO FOR
[000:55:33;963] ALL OF THESE YEARS.
[000:55:34;898] >> IF YOU THINK HOW FAST YOUR
[000:55:36;399] PHONE IS COMPARED TO THE FIRST
[000:55:39;903] AND LAPTOP YOU GOT, IT'S MIND
[000:55:43;873] BLOWING.
[000:55:44;207] THINK ABOUT THE ACCESS YOU HAVE
[000:55:45;742] TO CONTEND, MUSIC AND MOVIES AND
[000:55:48;645] EVERYTHING ELSE AND HOW THAT HAS
[000:55:51;181] MOVED SO QUICKLY.
[000:55:53;116] TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE WILL BE
[000:56:01;091] EXPONENTIAL.
[000:56:01;791] >> Shepard: FASCINATING.
[000:56:03;159] WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT IT FROM
[000:56:06;096] "KENNEDY."
[000:56:06;463] WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
[000:56:07;163] >> SO MUCH IT HURTS.
[000:56:13;970] That means, I'll get it
[000:56:13;970] from here.
[000:56:15;939] Yeah okay so.
[000:56:21;411] I can just quit school and get a
[000:56:21;411] job.
[000:56:26;850] It's ok. Daddy's here.
[000:56:29;519] Daddy.
[000:56:31;020] Hey.
[000:56:32;489] Hi.
[000:56:39;195] Hey buddy
[000:56:41;297] Hey dad
[000:56:42;732] I think we can do this.
[000:56:45;034] Really?
[000:56:47;937] Adam Baily.
[000:56:53;843] Adam Baily.

[000:57:09;426] protect yourself.ary.
[000:57:11;995] What is scary?
[000:57:13;296] Pneumococcal pneumonia.
[000:57:15;098] It's a serious disease.
[000:57:16;599] My doctor said the risk is
[000:57:16;599] greater now that I'm over 50!
[000:57:21;671] Yeah...ya-ha...
[000:57:24;007] Just one dose of the PREVNAR 13®
[000:57:25;942] vaccine can help protect you
[000:57:27;310] from pneumococcal pneumonia-

[000:57:31;881] and may even put you

[000:57:39;489] cause pneumococcal pneumonia.
[000:57:40;890] You should not receive

[000:57:45;862] immune system,
[000:57:47;363] you may have a lower
[000:57:47;363] response to the vaccine.
