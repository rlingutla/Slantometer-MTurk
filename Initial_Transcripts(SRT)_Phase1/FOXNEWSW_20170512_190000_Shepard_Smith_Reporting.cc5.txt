[000:00:04;170] ULTIMATE IN LUXE ARE YOU GIFTS
[000:00:06;106] THE BREAK.

[000:00:13;146] ENJOY THE LOVE AROUND YOU.
[000:00:15;715] HERE'S SHEPARD SMITH.
[000:00:16;282] >> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE
[000:00:17;384] WEST COAST.
[000:00:18;251] 3:00 AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE
[000:00:20;120] THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[000:00:21;087] STATES IS WARNING HIS FIRED FBI
[000:00:23;523] DIRECTOR AGAINST LEAKING TO THE
[000:00:25;025] MEDIA AND SUGGESTING THERE MAY
[000:00:26;659] BE TAPES OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS.
[000:00:28;595] MINUTES AGO, WE HEARD FROM THE
[000:00:30;063] WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN ON THAT
[000:00:31;498] LIVE ON TELEVISION, WHICH IS
[000:00:33;566] INTERESTING CONSIDERING THE
[000:00:35;001] PRESIDENT FLOATING THE IDEA OF
[000:00:37;837] CANCELLING PRESS BRIEFINGS
[000:00:39;439] BECAUSE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR
[000:00:40;440] HIS PEOPLE TO BE TOTALLY
[000:00:42;742] ACCURATE.
[000:00:43;109] AND THE LAWYERS HAVE SAID
[000:00:44;344] THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE TAX
[000:00:46;146] RETURNS AND HE HASN'T MADE MONEY
[000:00:48;214] FROM RUSSIAN SOURCES WITH A FEW
[000:00:53;319] EXCEPTIONS.
[000:00:53;720] AND VLADIMIR PUTIN SAYS HE CAN
[000:00:57;524] HELP REDUCE KIM JONG-UN'S
[000:00:59;526] NUCLEAR THREAT.
[000:01:00;427] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:06;533] >> FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK
[000:01:07;901] THIS FRIDAY AFTERNOON, THE WHITE
[000:01:09;069] HOUSE IS REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER
[000:01:10;937] PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORDED
[000:01:12;439] CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FORMER
[000:01:15;108] FBI DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.
[000:01:17;877] THAT'S AFTER HE SENT THIS TWEET.
[000:01:22;282] THAT LED TO THIS EXCHANGE IN
[000:01:24;517] TODAY'S WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING.
[000:01:27;587] >> DID PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORD
[000:01:31;024] HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH JAMES
[000:01:32;792] COMEY?
[000:01:33;093] >> I ASSUME YOU'RE REFERRING TO
[000:01:35;862] THE TWEET.
[000:01:37;163] THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAS
[000:01:38;064] NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT.
[000:01:39;032] >> WHY DID HE TWEET THAT?
[000:01:40;934] WHAT SHOULD WE INTERPRET FROM
[000:01:42;969] THAT?
[000:01:43;269] >> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING
[000:01:44;337] FURTHER TO ADD.
[000:01:44;938] >> ARE THERE RECORDING DEVICES
[000:01:46;439] IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR THE
[000:01:48;241] RESIDENCE?
[000:01:48;608] >> THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER TO
[000:01:51;444] ADD ON THAT.
[000:01:52;245] >> DID HE THREATEN MR. COMEYTO ?
[000:01:56;082] >> IT'S NOT A THREAT.
[000:01:57;684] THE TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.
[000:01:59;719] I'M MOVING ON.
[000:02:01;621] >> Shepard: HISTORIANS ARE
[000:02:06;126] COMPARING THE TWEET WITH
[000:02:11;564] PRESIDENT NIXON THAT RECORDED
[000:02:14;067] PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:02:15;168] NOW THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
[000:02:17;103] HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS
[000:02:18;438] RESPONDING TO THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:02:19;539] TWEET.
[000:02:19;839] THE COMMITTEE IS CONDUCTING ITS
[000:02:22;208] OWN INVESTIGATION TO RUSSIAN
[000:02:23;843] MEDDLING AND POTENTIAL COLLUSION
[000:02:25;979] WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
[000:02:27;814] ADAM SCHIFF SAID IF THE
[000:02:29;282] PRESIDENT HAS TAPES OF HIS
[000:02:31;184] CONVERSATIONS OF DIRECTOR COMEY,
[000:02:32;819] IT'S BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT
[000:02:33;686] HIMSELF MADE THEM.
[000:02:35;321] FOR A PRESIDENT THAT BASE LESSLY
[000:02:40;293] ACCUSES OF WIRE TAPING, THAT
[000:02:41;928] MR. TRUMP WOULD HAVE ENGAGED IN
[000:02:43;463] SUCH CONDUCT IS STAGGERING.
[000:02:45;231] THE PRESIDENT SHOULD PROVIDE ANY
[000:02:46;933] SUCH RECORDINGS TO CONGRESS OR
[000:02:49;068] ADMIT, ONCE AGAIN, TO HAVE MADE
[000:02:52;605] A THREATENING STATEMENT.
[000:02:53;907] THE CONGRESSMAN IS REFERRING TO
[000:02:56;543] PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNFOUNDED
[000:02:58;444] CLAIM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD
[000:02:59;579] TRUMP TOWER WIRETAPPED.
[000:03:03;483] BACK IN MARCH, DIRECTOR COMEY
[000:03:04;918] SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO
[000:03:05;985] BACK UP THAT CLAIM.
[000:03:07;520] ASIDE FROM A LETTER, WE HAVEN'T
[000:03:11;724] HEARD FROM JAMES COMEY SINCE THE
[000:03:16;229] PRESIDENT AXED HIM.
[000:03:20;533] ABC NEWS NOW CITES SOURCES THAT
[000:03:22;669] SAY THAT COMEY WAS FURIOUS AT
[000:03:24;704] THE LACK OF RESPECT THE WHITE
[000:03:26;606] HOUSE SHOWED HIM.
[000:03:27;707] REMEMBER, HE WAS IN LOS ANGELES
[000:03:29;609] GIVING A SPEECH TO BUREAU
[000:03:31;177] EMPLOYEES WHEN NEWS OF HIS
[000:03:32;612] FIRING FLASHING ON TV SCREENS.
[000:03:34;280] THAT'S HOW HE LEARNED OF IT.
[000:03:36;115] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHITE HOUSE
[000:03:38;985] OFFICIALS CLAIM THE FBI RANK AND
[000:03:40;720] FILE LOST CONFIDENCE IN DIRECTOR
[000:03:42;555] COMEY AS PART OF THE REASONING
[000:03:43;723] FOR THE FIRING.
[000:03:44;791] BUT IN A CONTRADICTION, THE
[000:03:46;960] PRESIDENT SAID THAT WAS NOT
[000:03:48;528] TRUE.
[000:03:48;828] THEN THERE'S THIS FROM THE
[000:03:50;663] FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
[000:03:51;331] OFFICIAL MATTHEW MILLER.
[000:03:52;599] HE TWEETED, ONE THING I LEARNED
[000:03:55;101] AT DOJ, HE LEAVES A PROTECTIVE
[000:03:58;238] PAPER TRAIL WHEN HE DEEMS
[000:03:59;305] SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE
[000:04:00;873] HAPPENED.
[000:04:01;241] STAY TUNED.
[000:04:02;642] OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:04:05;445] CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS ON
[000:04:06;212] THE NORTH LAWN.
[000:04:07;146] WHAT ELSE IS THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:08;448] SAYING?
[000:04:08;781] >> NOT A WHOLE LOT, SHEP.
[000:04:10;483] THIS MORNING AFTER THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:12;652] SAID AT THAT TWEET AT THE UPPER
[000:04:15;421] PRESS OFFICE WHEN I TALKED TO
[000:04:18;524] SEAN SPICER AND SARAH HUCKABEE
[000:04:21;361] SANDERS AND I ASKED THEM ABOUT
[000:04:23;429] THIS, WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKS
[000:04:24;797] TO SOMEBODY AS HE DID ON THE
[000:04:26;466] TELEPHONE WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR,
[000:04:28;268] ARE THE CALLS LOGGED OR ARE
[000:04:30;169] THERE TRANSCRIPTS MADE OF THEM?
[000:04:32;005] THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T GO INTO
[000:04:33;506] MORE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAN THAT.
[000:04:35;174] OF COURSE, THEY REITERATED THAT.
[000:04:36;943] IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT
[000:04:38;177] THE DIRECT OF COLUMBIA IS A
[000:04:42;181] ONE-PARTY CONSENT RECORDING
[000:04:45;351] DISTRICT.
[000:04:45;918] IT'S NOT A STATE.
[000:04:47;787] ONLY ONE PARTY CONSENTING BEFORE
[000:04:49;722] YOU CAN RECORD SOMEBODY.
[000:04:50;857] THE ONLY OTHER CASE WHERE
[000:04:52;125] SOMEBODY WAS RECORDED HERE AT
[000:04:53;493] THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE WAS A
[000:04:54;927] HEATED CONVERSATION BETWEEN A
[000:04:56;696] WHITE HOUSE STAFFER AND A
[000:04:58;698] REPORTER.
[000:04:59;098] SOMEBODY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:05:00;099] PRESS OFFICE RECORDED THAT.
[000:05:01;200] I ACTUALLY LISTENED TO THAT
[000:05:03;202] CONVERSATION.
[000:05:03;636] BUT SHEP, NOTHING TO INDICATE AT
[000:05:05;805] THIS POINT THAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:07;240] HAS ANY KIND OF NIXONIAN TAPING
[000:05:09;442] SYSTEM IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR ANY
[000:05:11;678] TRANSCRIPTS OR RECORDINGS MADE
[000:05:13;146] OF THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS
[000:05:14;580] THAT HE HAD WITH THE FORMER FBI
[000:05:17;216] DIRECTOR.
[000:05:17;583] >> Shepard: JOHN, THERE'S
[000:05:18;685] REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:05:19;786] MONTHS AGO ASKED DIRECTOR COMEY
[000:05:22;188] TO PLEDGE HIS LOYALTY.
[000:05:23;956] THERE WERE REPORTS IN "THE NEW
[000:05:25;191] YORK TIMES" HE MAY HAVE DONE
[000:05:25;958] SEEN AT A DINNER.
[000:05:27;393] WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING
[000:05:30;029] ON THIS?
[000:05:30;530] >> THAT'S WHAT THE TWEET WAS
[000:05:32;231] ABOUT IN TERMS OF LEAKING.
[000:05:33;666] THERE'S A STORY IN "THE NEW YORK
[000:05:35;768] TIMES" THAT QUOTES A SOURCE
[000:05:38;671] CLOSE TO COMEY SAYING HE ASKED
[000:05:41;307] FOR A LOYALTY PLEDGE.
[000:05:43;176] HERE'S HOW SEAN SPICER HANDLED
[000:05:46;145] THAT QUESTION.
[000:05:46;979] >> DID THE PRESIDENT IMPLORE HIM
[000:05:49;349] TO PLEDGE HIS LOYALTY?
[000:05:50;750] IS THAT TRUE?
[000:05:51;718] >> NO.
[000:05:52;251] >> FOR IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THE
[000:05:53;619] FBI DIRECTOR BE LOYAL TO THE
[000:05:55;521] PRESIDENT?
[000:05:55;922] IS THAT A QUALITY THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:57;890] WANTS TO SEE IN ANY ONE,
[000:05:59;625] PARTICULARLY THE FBI DIRECTOR?
[000:06:01;294] >> THE PRESIDENT WANTS LOYALTY
[000:06:02;829] TO THE COUNTRY AND RULE OF LAW.
[000:06:04;697] >> SO I DID KNOW SOMEBODY, SHEP,
[000:06:06;232] THAT WAS THE HEAD OF AN AGENCY
[000:06:07;667] THAT WAS A HOLDOVER FROM THE
[000:06:11;504] OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHO WHEN
[000:06:13;039] THE PRESIDENT TOOK OVER WAS
[000:06:14;207] ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT LOYALTY.
[000:06:15;908] HIS ANSWER WAS I'M LOYALTY TO
[000:06:17;744] THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
[000:06:18;711] NOT TO ANY ONE POLITICIAN IN
[000:06:21;547] PARTICULAR.
[000:06:21;948] SHEP?
[000:06:22;348] >> Shepard: JOHN, ANOTHER
[000:06:23;282] STUNNING MOVE THIS MORNING.
[000:06:25;051] THE PRESIDENT ALSO SUGGESTED HE
[000:06:26;352] MIGHT DO AWAY WITH THE DAILY
[000:06:29;122] PRESS BRIEFING AFTER HE
[000:06:31;190] CONTRADICTED HIS OWN
[000:06:31;791] ADMINISTRATION OVER WHY AND WHEN
[000:06:32;925] HE DECIDED TO FIRE JAMES COMEY.
[000:06:35;762] THE PRESIDENT TWEETED AS A VERY
[000:06:37;630] ACTIVE PRESIDENT WITH LOTS OF
[000:06:38;965] THINGS HAPPENING, IT'S NOT
[000:06:41;267] POSSIBLE FOR MY SURROGATES TO
[000:06:43;236] STAND AT THE PODIUM WITH PERFECT
[000:06:45;538] ACCURACY.
[000:06:45;905] MAYBE THE BEST THING TO DO IS
[000:06:48;408] CANCEL ALL PRESS BRIEFINGS HAND
[000:06:49;742] OUT WRITTEN RESPONSES FOR THE
[000:06:51;377] SAKE OF ACCURACY.
[000:06:52;979] AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT'S
[000:06:54;447] IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS OWN
[000:06:55;615] COMMUNICATIONS TEAM TO BE ON THE
[000:06:56;716] SAME PAGE THAT HE'S ON ALL THE
[000:06:58;351] TIME.
[000:06:58;651] THE WHITE HOUSE INITIALLY SAID
[000:07:00;319] THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTED ON
[000:07:02;789] RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HIS
[000:07:03;456] ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE HE FIRED
[000:07:05;558] COMEY.
[000:07:05;858] YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT TOLD NBC
[000:07:07;593] NEWS HE WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY
[000:07:09;729] ANYWAY.
[000:07:10;062] BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS AT THE
[000:07:12;031] WHITE HOUSE.
[000:07:13;099] DID THE PRESIDENT JUST DOUBLE
[000:07:14;300] DOWN ON THIS WITH AN INTERVIEW
[000:07:16;102] WITH ONE OF OUR FOLK?
[000:07:17;904] >> SPECIFICALLY TO THAT POINT,
[000:07:20;106] HE SAID HE'S MOVING SO FAST HIS
[000:07:21;908] PRESS OFFICE CANNOT KEEP UP WITH
[000:07:24;177] HIM.
[000:07:24;544] WATCH THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN
[000:07:25;978] JUDGE JANINE AND THE PRESIDENT.
[000:07:27;313] >> ARE YOU MOVING SO QUICKLY
[000:07:29;348] THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS KEPT
[000:07:30;950] CANNOT KEEP UP WITH YOU?
[000:07:32;051] >> YES, THAT'S TRUE.
[000:07:33;352] >> SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT?
[000:07:35;087] >> WE DON'T HAVE PRESS
[000:07:36;689] CONFERENCES AND WE DO --
[000:07:39;292] >> YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.
[000:07:40;793] >> DON'T HAVE THEM UNLESS I HAVE
[000:07:42;528] THEM EVERY TWO WEEKS AND I DO
[000:07:44;330] THEM MYSELF.
[000:07:44;897] WE DON'T HAVE THEM.
[000:07:46;098] I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
[000:07:47;433] FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE A LEVEL
[000:07:49;101] OF HOSTILITY THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
[000:07:52;138] SARAH HUCKABEE IS A LOVELY YOUNG
[000:07:54;674] WOMAN.
[000:07:55;908] YOU KNOW SEAN SPICER.
[000:07:58;845] HE'S A NICE MAN.
[000:08:00;213] >> IS HE'S YOUR PRESS SECRETARY
[000:08:02;748] TODAY AND TOMORROW?
[000:08:03;483] >> HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB BUT HE
[000:08:05;451] GETS BEAT UP.
[000:08:06;219] >> WILL HE BE THERE TOMORROW?
[000:08:08;955] >> HE'S BEEN THERE FROM THE
[000:08:11;023] BEGINNING.
[000:08:11;390] >> THE PRESIDENT KNEW WHAT THE
[000:08:12;792] REASONS WERE FOR COMEY'S FIRING.
[000:08:15;127] THEY WERE NOT ARTICULATED OR
[000:08:16;729] THEY'RE COMING UP WITH AN
[000:08:18;564] ALTERNATE CASE FOR WHY HE WAS
[000:08:20;366] FIRED.
[000:08:20;666] THE REAL REASON WASN'T
[000:08:21;968] ARTICULATED TO THE VICE
[000:08:22;568] PRESIDENT.
[000:08:22;935] WEDNESDAY MORNING HE WENT OUT
[000:08:24;303] THERE AND GAVE AN INCOMPLETE
[000:08:25;571] ANSWER AS WELL.
[000:08:26;839] SO SEE WHERE IN GOES.
[000:08:29;408] >> Shepard: JOHN, THANK YOU.
[000:08:30;810] THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS SAY A
[000:08:32;512] REVIEW OF HIS LAST DECADE OF TAX
[000:08:34;647] RETURNS DOES NOT REFLECT ANY
[000:08:37;183] INCOME OF ANY TYPE FROM RUSSIAN
[000:08:39;085] SOURCES FOR ANY DEBT OWED TO
[000:08:41;387] RUSSIAN LENDERS.
[000:08:42;788] BUT THE LAWYERS CLAIM THERE'S
[000:08:44;190] SOME EXCEPTIONS.
[000:08:45;091] FOR INSTANCE, A PROPERTY SOLD TO
[000:08:47;059] A RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE FOR $95
[000:08:49;629] MILLION IN 2008.
[000:08:50;696] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT RELEASED
[000:08:52;298] THE TAX RETURNS SO FOX NEWS
[000:08:53;666] CANNOT CONFIRM ANY OF THIS.
[000:08:55;468] MEANTIME, THE LAW FIRM WHICH
[000:08:56;202] WROTE THE LETTER FOR THE
[000:08:58;471] PRESIDENT HAS EXTENSIVE TIES TO
[000:09:00;506] RUSSIA AND ACCORDING TO A PRESS
[000:09:02;308] RELEASE ON HIS OWN WEB SITE, THE
[000:09:05;645] LAWSUIT WON A RUSSIAN LAW FIRM
[000:09:06;846] OF THE YEAR AWARD IN 2016.
[000:09:09;916] THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK'S GERRI
[000:09:12;084] WILLIS IS HERE.
[000:09:12;618] THAT'S ALMOST FUNNY.
[000:09:13;719] >> IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.
[000:09:14;787] >> IT IS FUNNY.
[000:09:15;988] >> THE FIRM IS MORGAN LEWIS.
[000:09:17;757] I HAVE A COPY OF THE LETTER
[000:09:19;659] HERE.
[000:09:19;959] YOU CAN SEE THE LETTER THEY
[000:09:21;227] WROTE ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENT.
[000:09:23;496] LET'S BE CLEAR.
[000:09:24;797] TRUMP IS THE CLIENT OF THIS
[000:09:27;199] ORGANIZATION.
[000:09:27;633] THEY REPORT TO HIM.
[000:09:28;301] HE'S PAYING THE 48 -- FREIGHT
[000:09:35;641] HERE.
[000:09:35;975] I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IF YOU READ
[000:09:37;910] BETWEEN THE LINES HERE,
[000:09:39;612] UNDERSTAND THAT MAJOR COMPANIES
[000:09:41;180] IN RUSSIA USE SUBSIDIARIES IN
[000:09:43;649] OTHER PLACES LIKE CYPRESS, LIKE
[000:09:46;152] THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.
[000:09:47;720] AT THE END OF THE DAY, MAYBE
[000:09:49;388] THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT
[000:09:50;323] WE'RE NOT SEEING.
[000:09:51;357] >> Shepard: WHY DID THIS LETTER
[000:09:53;025] COME ABOUT?
[000:09:53;492] DID SOMEONE ASK FOR THIS?
[000:09:56;028] >> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ASKED
[000:09:57;296] FOR THIS LETTER AS PART OF HIS
[000:09:59;832] INVESTIGATION.
[000:10:00;266] I TRIED TO REACH OUT TO HIS
[000:10:01;767] OFFICE TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY
[000:10:03;069] MAKE OF THIS LETTER, IF IT
[000:10:04;971] SATISFIES THEM.
[000:10:05;471] I WAS UNABLE TO DO SO.
[000:10:09;075] IN AN INVESTIGATION THIS MIGHT
[000:10:11;711] BE STEP NUMBER 1.
[000:10:12;511] YOU WANT TO SEE THE RESULTS, THE
[000:10:15;982] FILINGS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT'S
[000:10:17;750] GOING ON.
[000:10:18;618] >> Shepard: THE TAX RETURNS
[000:10:19;652] ANSWER THE QUESTION.
[000:10:20;219] >> IT WOULD HELP.
[000:10:20;753] WHAT DOES THE IRS DO FOR A LIST
[000:10:23;589] SOMETHING THEY MATCH W 2s WITH
[000:10:26;692] REPORTED INCOME.
[000:10:28;327] INTERNATIONAL FINANCE, IT'S
[000:10:29;328] ANOTHER THING.
[000:10:29;829] >> Shepard: THEY DO A GREAT JOB.
[000:10:31;897] NEVER SPEAK POORLY.
[000:10:32;798] >> WE LOVE THE IRS.
[000:10:34;767] >> Shepard: OBVIOUSLY.
[000:10:35;468] >> THEY'RE OUR FAVORITE PEOPLE.
[000:10:36;769] >> Shepard: THEY ARE.
[000:10:39;472] GO METS!
[000:10:40;439] GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:10:41;474] >> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
[000:10:44;310] >> Shepard: THANK YOU.
[000:10:45;544] MORE FROM CHRIS WALLACE COMING
[000:10:47;279] UP FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK ON
[000:10:49;515] THIS MERCIFULLY FRIDAY AGAINST.
[000:10:50;850] STAY WITH US.
[000:11:07;133] ♪
[000:11:09;535] To err is human.
[000:11:11;537] To anticipate is Lexus.
[000:11:15;174] Experience the Lexus RX
[000:11:15;174] with Advanced Safety standard.
[000:11:19;879] Experience amazing.
[000:12:23;576] the uncertainties of Hep C.
[000:12:26;178] Wondering, What if?
[000:12:28;514] I let go of all those feelings.
[000:12:32;685] Because I am cured with Harvoni.
[000:12:36;789] Harvoni is a revolutionary
[000:12:38;023] treatment for the most common
[000:12:39;024] type of chronic hepatitis C.
[000:12:40;993] It's been prescribed to more
[000:12:42;027] than a quarter million people.
[000:12:43;195] And is proven to cure up to
[000:12:44;396] 99% of patients who have had no
[000:12:46;031] prior treatment with 12 weeks.
[000:12:48;667] Certain patients can be cured
[000:12:49;835] with just 8 weeks of Harvoni.
[000:12:51;837] Before starting Harvoni,
[000:12:53;239] your doctor will test to see if
[000:12:54;507] you've ever had hepatitis B,
[000:12:56;008] which may flare up and cause
[000:12:57;042] serious liver problems during
[000:12:58;377] and after Harvoni treatment.
[000:12:59;678] Tell your doctor if you've
[000:13:00;880] ever had hepatitis B,
[000:13:02;214] a liver transplant,
[000:13:03;048] other liver or kidney problems,
[000:13:04;550] HIV or any other medical
[000:13:06;085] conditions and about all
[000:13:07;386] the medicines you take
[000:13:08;420] including herbal supplements.
[000:13:09;522] Taking amiodarone with Harvoni
[000:13:11;357] can cause a serious slowing
[000:13:12;525] of your heart rate.
[000:13:13;392] Common side effects of Harvoni
[000:13:14;693] include tiredness,
[000:13:15;694] headache and weakness.
[000:13:16;929] Ready to let go of Hep C?
[000:13:19;365] Ask your Hep C Specialist
[000:13:19;365] about Harvoni.
[000:13:26;572] >> Shepard: CONTINUING COVERAGE
[000:13:28;440] OF THE PRESIDENT'S SUGGESTION
[000:13:29;775] THAT CONVERSATIONSES  IN THE
[000:13:36;615] OVAL OFFICE MAY BE RECORDED.
[000:13:37;817] CHRIS WALLACE JOINS US WITH
[000:13:39;852] MORE.
[000:13:40;152] THIS WAS COMMON PRACTICE IN THE
[000:13:42;254] NIXON ADMINISTRATION?
[000:13:43;055] RECORDING CONVERSATIONS.
[000:13:44;290] >> WHEN I HEARD THAT EXCHANGE
[000:13:46;458] TODAY BETWEEN JEFF MASON, WHITE
[000:13:48;994] HOUSE REPORTER, AND SEAN SPICER
[000:13:50;996] SPEAKING FROM THE PODIUM IN THE
[000:13:52;698] BRIEFING ROOM FOR THE PRESIDENT
[000:13:55;601] OF THE UNITED STATES, IT TOOK MY
[000:13:57;236] BREATH AWAY.
[000:13:59;371] THAT'S WHAT IN WATERGATE THEY
[000:14:00;873] CALL A NONDENIAL DENIAL.
[000:14:03;042] HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY, IS
[000:14:04;376] THERE A RECORDING DEVICE IN THE
[000:14:06;579] OVAL OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF
[000:14:07;980] THE UNITED STATES.
[000:14:08;981] HE SAID I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU
[000:14:10;282] ON THAT.
[000:14:10;816] HE COULD HAVE SAID NO.
[000:14:12;618] HE COULD HAVE SAID YES.
[000:14:13;586] HE SAID I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU
[000:14:14;820] ON THAT.
[000:14:15;621] THAT IS A NONDENIAL DENIAL.
[000:14:18;057] IT MAY JUST BE THAT THE
[000:14:20;860] PRESIDENT IS TROLLING THE PRESS
[000:14:22;595] CORPS AND SAYING WORK YOURSELF
[000:14:23;996] INTO A FRENZY ABOUT THIS AND
[000:14:28;601] TURNS OUT IT NOTHING.
[000:14:29;768] WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
[000:14:30;970] WHY WOULD HE WANT TO DECREASE
[000:14:32;638] THE CREDIBILITY WHICH IS ALREADY
[000:14:34;473] IN QUESTION OF THIS WHITE HOUSE
[000:14:36;275] AND COMMENTS MADE FROM THAT
[000:14:37;943] PODIUM?
[000:14:38;277] SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE PLAYING
[000:14:40;613] A VERY DANGEROUS GAME WITH THE
[000:14:42;915] CURRENCY OF THE CREDIBILITY OF
[000:14:45;517] THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[000:14:46;452] STATES.
[000:14:46;785] >> Shepard: THIS FIRST CAME UP
[000:14:47;553] IN THE CONTEXT OF DISCUSSION
[000:14:51;023] REGARDING JAMES COMEY.
[000:14:54;793] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:14:55;461] THIS IS THE TWEET THAT CAME FROM
[000:14:58;063] THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING WHEN
[000:14:59;231] HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE BETTER
[000:15:03;035] HOPE THERE'S NO TAPES IF HE WILL
[000:15:05;504] KEEP LEAKING, THIS GOES BACK TO
[000:15:08;741] YESTERDAY WHEN THE PRESIDENT
[000:15:10;876] TOLD LESTER HOLT ON THREE
[000:15:12;344] SEPARATE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING
[000:15:14;280] ONCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, A WEEK
[000:15:16;482] AFTER THE INAUGURATION, THAT
[000:15:17;783] COMEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT HE
[000:15:18;717] WAS NOT A TARGET OF THE
[000:15:21;620] INVESTIGATION.
[000:15:22;054] THAT ALWAYS SEEMED DUBIOUS GIVEN
[000:15:23;856] THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ARGUE THAT
[000:15:25;524] COMEY HAD AN OVERLY INFLATED
[000:15:27;660] SENSE OF HIS OWN INTEGRITY.
[000:15:29;828] BUT THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD SAY
[000:15:31;230] TO THE POTENTIAL TARGET OF AN
[000:15:33;766] INVESTIGATION, YOU'RE OFF THE
[000:15:35;100] HOOK, THAT ALWAYS SEEMED
[000:15:36;502] UNLIKELY.
[000:15:36;869] SURE ENOUGH THIS MORNING, COMEY
[000:15:40;839] THROUGH SOURCES, ASSOCIATES,
[000:15:42;574] LEAKED THE STORY TO "THE NEW
[000:15:45;110] YORK TIMES," TOLD A COMPLETELY
[000:15:45;978] DIFFERENT STORY THAT SAID THAT
[000:15:47;079] THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR THE
[000:15:48;314] DINNER AND AT THE DINNER ASKED
[000:15:50;983] HIM THREE SEPARATE TIMES, WILL
[000:15:52;518] YOU PLEDGE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.
[000:15:54;219] COMB MY REFUSED TO DO SO.
[000:15:57;089] THAT LED TO THE TWEET.
[000:15:59;224] LOOK, HERE'S THE REAL THING THAT
[000:16:00;526] I WONDER ABOUT HERE, SHEP.
[000:16:02;561] IF THE WHOLE POINT A WEEK AGO
[000:16:03;996] WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS FED
[000:16:06;065] UP WITH THE HIGH PROFILE OF THE
[000:16:09;501] RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND THE
[000:16:11;036] HIGH PROFILE OF JAMES COMEY,
[000:16:12;304] LOOK AT EVERY STEP THAT'S BEEN
[000:16:14;139] TAKEN IN THE LAST SEVEN DAYS.
[000:16:17;076] YOU SAID IF HE HAD GONE ABOUT IT
[000:16:19;011] AS PURPOSELY TO RAISE COMEY'S
[000:16:23;682] PROFILE AND RAISE QUESTIONS
[000:16:24;450] ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION,
[000:16:25;851] HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER
[000:16:27;519] THAN HE HAS.
[000:16:27;920] I FIND IT ONE OF THE MOST
[000:16:30;622] ASTONISHING WEEKS THAT I'VE EVER
[000:16:33;459] COVERED IN THIS TOWN.
[000:16:38;397] >> Shepard: WHAT DOES THIS TELL
[000:16:39;865] US ABOUT THE INNER WORKINGS OF
[000:16:41;500] THE WHITE HOUSE?
[000:16:42;234] THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE TRUST OF
[000:16:43;769] THE PEOPLE ON BIG MATTERS, IF
[000:16:46;705] AND WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS?
[000:16:49;475] BECAUSE SOMETHING WILL.
[000:16:50;642] >> WELL, YOU WONDER ABOUT THE
[000:16:53;112] TRUST OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE
[000:16:54;880] WHITE HOUSE.
[000:16:55;414] THE PRESIDENT WAS FURIOUS ON
[000:16:56;982] TUESDAY AFTER HE SUDDENLY
[000:17:00;119] ANNOUNCED COMEY'S FIRING THAT
[000:17:04;256] THERE WASN'T A MORE CONCERTED
[000:17:06;425] EFFORT ON HIS COMMUNICATIONS
[000:17:08;160] TEAM TO DEFEND HIM.
[000:17:09;361] THE REASON WAS, THEY DIDN'T SET
[000:17:11;063] UP TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT AND
[000:17:13;198] ORGANIZE.
[000:17:13;565] THERE'S A CREDIBLE TEAM.
[000:17:14;633] THEY COULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER AN
[000:17:17;069] ARGUMENT.
[000:17:17;436] THEN OF COURSE, THE OTHER THING,
[000:17:18;871] TURNED OUT THE ORIGINAL REASON
[000:17:20;172] THAT THEY WERE GIVEN AND THE
[000:17:21;774] PRESIDENT HIMSELF PUT IN HIS
[000:17:23;442] LETTER FIRING COMEY TURNS OUT
[000:17:25;310] NOT TO HAVE BEEN TRUE.
[000:17:26;478] HE SAID IN A LETTER I DID THIS
[000:17:28;680] UNDER RECOMMENDATION OF THE
[000:17:29;982] ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DEPUTY
[000:17:31;383] ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE OF THE
[000:17:33;786] WAY COMEY HANDLED THE CLINTON
[000:17:38;657] INVESTIGATION.
[000:17:39;458] YESTERDAY HE SAID IT WASN'T
[000:17:40;759] TRUE.
[000:17:41;060] HE PLANNED TO FIRE HIM BEFORE HE
[000:17:42;227] MET WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
[000:17:43;562] SO EVERY STEP HE'S TAKEN THIS
[000:17:45;764] WEEK HAS CUT INTO THE
[000:17:47;166] CREDIBILITY OF THIS WHITE HOUSE,
[000:17:49;034] THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE
[000:17:50;903] THE WHITE HOUSE AND CLEARLY I
[000:17:52;538] THINK THE TRUST THAT THE
[000:17:55;207] AMERICAN PEOPLE PAY TO THIS
[000:17:56;241] PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:17:58;243] STAFF.
[000:17:58;544] >> Shepard: CHRIS, YOU COVERED A
[000:17:59;812] LOT OF WHITE HOUSES.
[000:18:00;712] I WONDER IF THE OBJECTIVE
[000:18:02;681] JOURNALIST YOU ARE, HOW YOU
[000:18:03;882] WOULD DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THIS
[000:18:05;851] WHITE HOUSE IN THIS PRESIDENCY
[000:18:09;188] AT THIS MOMENT.
[000:18:11;423] >> I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT
[000:18:13;792] A LOT TODAY.
[000:18:14;693] I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
[000:18:16;128] AND I FIND IT TROUBLING AND
[000:18:19;331] TROUBLED.
[000:18:19;698] I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GAME
[000:18:21;467] THAT THEY'RE PLAYING.
[000:18:22;468] IT ISN'T A GAME.
[000:18:23;769] YOU'RE DEALING WITH VERY SERIOUS
[000:18:26;038] ISSUES.
[000:18:26;872] IF THE PRESIDENT IS UPSET --
[000:18:28;140] JUST THINK OF THIS.
[000:18:29;808] THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE WANTS
[000:18:33;645] TOLD LESTER HOLT, I WANT TO GET
[000:18:35;547] TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RUSSIA
[000:18:38;150] INVESTIGATION.
[000:18:38;584] IT WANT IT DOWN QUICKLY BUT FIND
[000:18:40;352] OUT.
[000:18:40;619] TODAY HE SENDS OUT A TWEET AND
[000:18:42;287] HE SENT ONE OUT EARLIER IN THE
[000:18:44;189] WEEKS SAYING IT'S A HOAX AND A
[000:18:46;892] TAX-PAYER FUNDED CHARADE.
[000:18:48;160] DOES HE WANT TO GET TO THE
[000:18:50;028] BOTTOM OF THE RUSSIA
[000:18:51;163] INVESTIGATION OR JUST WANT TO
[000:18:53;031] GET TO THE END OF THE RUSSIA
[000:18:55;467] INVESTIGATION?
[000:18:55;901] THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION.
[000:18:57;669] >> Shepard: IS THERE A DANGER IN
[000:18:59;171] THIS LEVEL OF DISARRAY?
[000:19:01;874] >> SURE.
[000:19:02;441] THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE
[000:19:04;676] UNITED STATES.
[000:19:05;244] THIS IS THE MAN WHO IS RUNNING
[000:19:06;578] THE COUNTRY.
[000:19:07;613] THIS IS THE MAN THAT WE HAVE TO
[000:19:09;248] TRUST AS YOU POINT OUT IN A
[000:19:10;983] CRISIS, AND THERE WILL BE A
[000:19:12;584] CRISIS.
[000:19:13;118] EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED
[000:19:14;186] THIS WEEK HAS CHIPPED AWAY AT
[000:19:15;687] THAT CREDIBILITY.
[000:19:16;989] IT'S A VERY DISTRESSING
[000:19:19;791] SITUATION.
[000:19:20;192] >> Shepard: WE TEND TO LOOK AT
[000:19:21;393] THESE THINGS OF THE VIEW OF
[000:19:23;195] THOSE THAT SUPPORT AND THE VIEWS
[000:19:25;097] OF THOSE THAT ARE CRITICS.
[000:19:26;498] IN THIS CASE IT COMES FROM ALL
[000:19:28;233] SIDES.
[000:19:28;534] THERE'S A GENERAL OBSERVATION
[000:19:31;436] THAT WE'RE IN A LEGAL OF UNUSUAL
[000:19:33;939] THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE
[000:19:36;508] HAD ANY CONTACT CAN'T FIND
[000:19:38;143] REFERENCE TO HISTORICALLY.
[000:19:40;112] MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOU
[000:19:41;680] MIGHT GET OUT OF THIS CYCLE,
[000:19:44;850] THIS CYCLE THAT THIS WHITE HOUSE
[000:19:47;352] SEEMS TO BE INTO SO WE CAN GET
[000:19:49;188] ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF THE
[000:19:50;956] NATION.
[000:19:51;423] CHRIS, IT'S CLEARLY ALL STOPPED.
[000:19:54;493] >> YEAH.
[000:19:55;861] THAT'S ANOTHER POINT THAT I FIND
[000:19:58;730] ASTONISHING.
[000:19:59;131] THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE SOME
[000:20:00;999] MOMENTUM FINALLY FOR HIS
[000:20:01;967] LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES, HIS
[000:20:04;670] LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THIS LAST
[000:20:06;104] WEEK WITH THE PASSING AND REPEAL
[000:20:07;806] AND REPLAC CAN LIKE THE BILL, ND
[000:20:10;976] IT.
[000:20:11;243] IT HAD PASSED THE HOUSE.
[000:20:12;811] A MAJOR BARRIER.
[000:20:13;979] THE REPUBLICANS AND THE SENATE
[000:20:15;180] SET UP A WORKING GROUP TO FIGURE
[000:20:17;883] OUT WHAT TO DO NEXT.
[000:20:19;451] WE WERE GETTING DOWN TO SERIOUS
[000:20:20;986] BUSINESS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN
[000:20:22;187] THE NATION.
[000:20:22;721] TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM.
[000:20:24;122] TALK ABOUT TRADE.
[000:20:25;357] SUDDENLY WE HAVE SPEND A WEEK
[000:20:27;259] AND IT'S GOING TO GO ON LONGER
[000:20:30;128] THAN THIS.
[000:20:30;829] THIS WON'T BE OVER SUNDAY.
[000:20:32;297] THIS WILL GO INTO NEXT WEEK AND
[000:20:35;367] MAYBE BEYOND.
[000:20:36;235] THERE'S TALK ABOUT ROD
[000:20:37;803] ROSENSTEIN, THE ATTORNEY
[000:20:39;371] GENERAL, HAVING TO TESTIFY
[000:20:41;607] BEFORE THE ENTIRE SENATE AND
[000:20:42;741] BRIEF THEM ON THIS SITUATION.
[000:20:45;143] THERE'S GOING TO BE THE
[000:20:46;678] ANNOUNCEMENT OF A REPLACEMENT
[000:20:48;180] FOR COMEY.
[000:20:49;414] CONFIRMATION HEARINGS THAT WILL
[000:20:50;849] BE CONTROVERSIAL.
[000:20:52;150] THIS WILL STOP ALL OF THE
[000:20:53;685] BUSINESS THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
[000:20:56;722] DONE TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS
[000:20:59;324] OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A
[000:21:00;626] LONG PERIOD OF TIME.
[000:21:02;461] WE'RE GOING TO BE IN ONE OF THE
[000:21:05;731] WORST BACK FIGHTING, CONFUSING,
[000:21:10;569] QUAGMIRES OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN
[000:21:13;205] MAKING.
[000:21:13;538] >> CHRIS WALLACE, SEE YOU THIS
[000:21:14;706] SUNDAY.
[000:21:15;040] THANK YOU.
[000:21:19;244] I was always
[000:21:19;244] "the girl with psoriasis."
[000:21:22;481] People don't stare anymore.
[000:21:24;016] I never joined in.
[000:21:26;118] That wasn't fair to any of us.
[000:21:28;186] I was covered.
[000:21:29;388] I tried lots of things
[000:21:29;388] over the years.
[000:21:31;657] But I didn't give up.
[000:21:32;991] I kept on fighting.
[000:21:34;593] I found something that worked.
[000:21:36;295] That still works.

[000:21:39;464] SEE ME.
[000:21:40;666] I found clear skin that lasts.
[000:21:42;401] See if COSENTYX could make a
[000:21:42;401] difference for you-
[000:21:44;803] COSENTYX is proven to help
[000:21:44;803] people with moderate
[000:21:46;938] to severe plaque psoriasis...
[000:21:48;373] ...find clear skin that
[000:21:48;373] can last.
[000:21:50;676] Don't use if you're allergic
[000:21:50;676] to COSENTYX.
[000:21:52;544] Before starting COSENTYX,
[000:21:53;679] you should be checked
[000:21:53;679] for tuberculosis.
[000:21:55;447] An increased risk of infections
[000:21:55;447] and lowered ability
[000:21:57;549] to fight them may occur.
[000:21:58;784] Tell your doctor if you have an
[000:21:58;784] infection or symptoms.
[000:22:01;119] Or if you have received a
[000:22:01;119] vaccine or plan to.
[000:22:03;155] If you have inflammatory
[000:22:03;155] bowel disease,
[000:22:04;823] tell your doctor if symptoms
[000:22:04;823] develop or worsen.
[000:22:06;958] Serious allergic reactions
[000:22:06;958] may occur.
[000:22:08;894] SEE ME
[000:22:08;894] to know...
[000:22:10;128] ...clear skin can last.
[000:22:12;264] Don't hold back...
[000:22:13;565] ...ask your dermatologist if
[000:22:13;565] COSENTYX can help you
[000:22:15;801] find clear skin that lasts.

[000:24:51;106] AFTER THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGES
[000:24:52;474] FOR MOST ACCUSED CRIMINALS.
[000:24:55;043] THIS MOVE REVERSES SOME OBAMA
[000:24:57;078] ADMINISTRATION POLICIES THAT
[000:24:58;880] WERE MEANT TO FIGHT OVERCROWDING
[000:25:00;482] IN U.S. PRISONS.
[000:25:03;118] ANALYSTS SAY IT WILL PUT MORE
[000:25:04;119] PEOPLE BEHIND BARS AND FOR
[000:25:05;520] LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.
[000:25:07;889] ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS HAS
[000:25:10;091] PROMISED TO CRACK DOWN ON DRUGS
[000:25:10;992] A TOP PRIORITY AT THE JUSTICE

[000:25:13;028] HE SAID THE NEW POLICY WILL
[000:25:15;730] IMPROVE MORE CONSISTENCY IN
[000:25:18;066] SENTENCING.
[000:25:19;801] BUT CRITICS SAY LOW LEVEL
[000:25:23;104] CRIMINALS WILL FACE MANDATORY
[000:25:26;274] SENTENCES.
[000:25:26;641] PETER DOOCY HAS MORE.

[000:25:32;581] THERE FOR NONVIOLENT DRUG
[000:25:34;516] OFFENSES.
[000:25:34;883] THAT POLICY ENDED TODAY.
[000:25:37;185] THE NEW ATTORNEY JERN RALEIGH
[000:25:39;354] JEFF SESSIONS SAYS THAT HE'S
[000:25:41;323] READY TO ENFORCE LAWS JUST AS
[000:25:43;959] CONGRESS WROTE THEM.
[000:25:44;693] >> I HAVE EMPOWERED OUR
[000:25:48;063] PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE AND PURSUE
[000:25:49;764] THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENSE AS I
[000:25:53;101] BELIEVE THE LAW REQUIRES, MOST
[000:25:55;103] SERIOUS READILY PROVABLE
[000:25:56;805] OFFENSE.
[000:25:57;138] IT MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

[000:26:01;543] ENFORCE THE LAW WITH JUDGMENT
[000:26:03;044] AND FAIRNESS.
[000:26:04;212] IT'S SIMPLY THE RIGHT AND MORAL
[000:26:07;082] THING TO DO.
[000:26:08;883] >> ONE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

[000:26:13;521] HOLDER PUSHES THE SMART ON CRIME

[000:26:15;323] HE SAID HE THINKS THIS PLAN IS
[000:26:17;459] DUMB ON CRIME.
[000:26:19;661] UNDER THE SMART ON CRIME PLAN,
[000:26:21;896] THERE WOULD BE WIGGLE ROOM FOR
[000:26:23;398] PROSECUTORS LIKE NOT DISCLOSING
[000:26:25;300] IN COURT WHAT QUANTITY A DRUG A
[000:26:27;669] DEFENDANT WAS ARRESTED WITH AS
[000:26:29;704] LONG AS NOBODY GOT HURT DURING
[000:26:30;872] THE CRIME OR THE ARREST.
[000:26:32;207] THAT POLICY IS OVER.
[000:26:34;509] RESCINDED BY THIS ATTORNEY
[000:26:35;744] GENERAL.
[000:26:36;077] NOW SOME PRISON ADVOCATES,
[000:26:38;079] REFORM ADVOCATES, ARE ALARMED.
[000:26:41;650] >> ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT LONG
[000:26:44;286] PRISON SENTENCES, THEY PRODUCE
[000:26:47;122] DIMINISHING RETURNS FOR PUBLIC
[000:26:48;623] SAFETY.
[000:26:48;957] PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR 30s, 40s AND
[000:26:51;226] 50s ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO BE
[000:26:53;361] INVOLVED IN CRIME THAN PEOPLE IN
[000:26:55;897] THEIR TEENS AND 20s.
[000:26:57;265] SO BY LENGTHENING PRISON TERMS,
[000:26:59;567] WE'RE GETTING LESS PUBLIC SAFETY
[000:27:01;803] IMPACT FROM EACH SUCCEEDING YEAR
[000:27:03;371] AND COMES AT A GREATER COST TO
[000:27:05;206] THE TAXPAYERS.

[000:27:16;117] DRUG DEALERS.
[000:27:17;485] THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A
[000:27:18;820] MORE AGGRESSIVE EFFORT TO ARREST
[000:27:21;056] DRUG DEALERS.
[000:27:21;790] NOW HE'S SAYING WHAT HE WANTS TO

[000:28:58;353] in patients who are
[000:28:58;353] taking donepezil.
[000:29:00;155] It may improve cognition
[000:29:00;155] and overall function,
[000:29:02;457] and may slow the worsening
[000:29:02;457] of symptoms for a while.
[000:29:05;059] NAMZARIC does not change
[000:29:06;060] the underlying

[000:35:04;018] WOULD ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION
[000:35:05;386] WITH NORTH KOREA ONLY AFTER IT
[000:35:06;888] CHANGES ITS BEHAVIOR.
[000:35:08;689] THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SPECIFIC TO
[000:35:09;991] THE U.S. ON WHAT THE CONDITIONS
[000:35:11;926] COULD BE, SHEP.
[000:35:12;860] >> Shepard: WHAT IS THE LATEST
[000:35:14;128] ON THE FOUR AMERICANS THE NORTH
[000:35:17;598] KOREANS HAVE DETAINED?
[000:35:18;166] >> WE'RE HEARING FROM NORTH
[000:35:20;001] KOREAN STATE MEDIA.
[000:35:21;068] NORTH KOREA RESERVES THE RIGHT
[000:35:23;171] TO RUTHLESSLY PUNISH AMERICAN
[000:35:24;972] CITIZENS THEY HAVE ARRESTED AND
[000:35:26;374] THE IDEA THAT THESE CAPTIVES
[000:35:28;776] HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY NORTH KOREA
[000:35:30;812] TO BE USED AS BARGAINING CHIPS
[000:35:33;614] IS PURE IGNORANCE.
[000:35:34;682] THEY SAID THEY WILL REVEAL THE
[000:35:36;918] EXTENT OF THE CHARGES AGAINST
[000:35:38;486] THESE FOUR AMERICANS.
[000:35:39;086] THE PROBLEM HERE, SHEP, THE
[000:35:41;823] UNITED STATES ALSO HAS NO
[000:35:43;691] DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NORTH
[000:35:45;760] KOREA.
[000:35:46;060] THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE
[000:35:47;595] SWEDISH EMBASSY OR THE RULES
[000:35:49;630] THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED, THE
[000:35:51;732] SWEDISH OFFICIALS SHOULD CHECK
[000:35:52;733] ON THESE AMERICANS IN A COUPLE
[000:35:54;402] DAYS.
[000:35:54;702] BUT THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT
[000:35:56;604] SAYS THOSE MEETINGS AND
[000:35:58;472] CHECK-ONS ARE CONSTANTLY PUSHED
[000:36:00;107] BACK, DELAYED, SOMETIMES NEVER
[000:36:01;909] HAPPEN.
[000:36:02;543] EARLIER THIS WEEK THE STATE
[000:36:04;011] DEPARTMENT REISSUED TRAVEL
[000:36:06;414] WARNING TO NORTH KOREA TELLING
[000:36:08;716] AMERICANS NOT TO GO THERE
[000:36:09;650] BECAUSE THOSE ARRESTED ARE
[000:36:11;052] TREATED BY THE WARTIME LAW OF
[000:36:13;788] NORTH KOREA.
[000:36:14;188] FOUR AMERICANS THERE NOW, SHEP.
[000:36:18;693] >> Shepard: RICH EDSON FROM THE
[000:36:21;195] STATE DEPARTMENT.
[000:36:21;729] LIKE WE NEEDED A WARNING NOT TO
[000:36:23;931] GO THERE.
[000:36:24;732] I DON'T KNOW.
[000:36:25;666] AND NOW AUTHOR OF "NUCLEAR SHOW
[000:36:28;436] DOWN TAKES ON THE WORLD", ARTHUR
[000:36:37;445] CHANG.
[000:36:37;778] WHERE ARE WE NORTH KOREA?
[000:36:39;413] LOOKS LIKE A MESS.
[000:36:40;715] >> YEAH, IT CONTINUES TO BE A
[000:36:42;950] MESS.
[000:36:43;251] THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
[000:36:44;218] CONSUMED BY THE COMEY FIRING.
[000:36:45;853] THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO
[000:36:47;388] NORTH KOREA.
[000:36:48;122] NOW YOU HAVE PUTIN MAKING
[000:36:49;490] COMMENTS ABOUT BEING A
[000:36:51;325] CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE.
[000:36:51;893] >> Shepard: YEAH WHAT DO YOU
[000:36:52;660] MAKE OF THIS?
[000:36:54;395] >> I DON'T THINK PUTIN WILL GET
[000:36:57;031] INVOLVED.
[000:36:57;398] THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED IN 2003.
[000:36:59;367] THEY WERE A MEMBER BUT NEVER
[000:37:01;869] PARTICIPATED.
[000:37:02;303] IF PUTIN -- LAST THING HE WANTS
[000:37:05;172] TO GET IN A COMPETITION ABOUT
[000:37:07;074] SUPPORTING NORTH KOREA.
[000:37:07;775] HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO
[000:37:09;310] THAT OR THE INTEREST IN HIS FAR
[000:37:10;778] EAST.
[000:37:11;078] SO HE'S GOING TO SAY THINGS LIKE
[000:37:15;049] THIS BECAUSE THE SOUTH KOREAN
[000:37:16;584] PRESIDENT CALLS HIM.
[000:37:17;585] IT STROKES HIS EGO.
[000:37:19;954] THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TOO
[000:37:24;358] INVOLVED.
[000:37:24;725] >> Shepard: THE NORTH KOREAN SAY
[000:37:25;493] THEY'RE GOING TO DO A SIXTH
[000:37:27;228] NUCLEAR TEST.
[000:37:27;795] WHERE IS OUR LEVERAGE WITH CHINA
[000:37:29;230] AND HOW DO WE APPLY IT?
[000:37:30;998] >> OUR LEVERAGE IS, WE CAN
[000:37:34;402] UNPLUG CHINESE BANKS FOR MONEY
[000:37:36;270] LAUNDERING FROM THE CHINESE.
[000:37:37;438] WE HAVE NEVER DONE IT.
[000:37:38;873] PRESIDENT OBAMA THREATENED TO DO
[000:37:42;209] THAT IN SEPTEMBER.
[000:37:44;645] BUT HE NEVER CARRIED THROUGH.
[000:37:46;380] THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS IN
[000:37:47;815] THIS COOPERATIVE FACE WITH
[000:37:49;350] CHINA.
[000:37:49;650] THEY'RE NOT THREATENING
[000:37:50;651] ANYTHING.
[000:37:51;018] WE DO HAVE IT.
[000:37:51;819] WE DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL
[000:37:53;821] WILL.
[000:37:54;121] WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE LEVERAGE
[000:37:56;324] THAN CHINA THAN CHINA HAS OVER
[000:37:58;359] US BUT WE DON'T USE IT.
[000:38:00;962] IT'S A HOLD RIGHT NOW.
[000:38:02;363] >> Shepard: PRACTICALLY
[000:38:04;598] SPEAKING, I'M CURIOUS TO FIND
[000:38:06;767] OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY
[000:38:08;336] MAKE A SIXTH TEST.
[000:38:09;837] EVEN THE CHINESE HAVE WARNED
[000:38:11;439] THEM.
[000:38:11;739] >> THE CHINESE HAVE AND WILL
[000:38:13;374] POSE MORE PRESSURE ON THEM.
[000:38:16;744] THE BALL IS IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:38:19;080] COURT.
[000:38:19;480] NORTH KOREA WON'T GET THE
[000:38:21;115] ABILITY TO LAND A NUKE ON
[000:38:22;616] U.S.
[000:38:22;917] HE HAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO
[000:38:24;919] STOP THEM.
[000:38:25;853] >> Shepard: WHERE DO WE GET THAT
[000:38:28;823] NUMBER?
[000:38:29;156] >> THAT'S THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT
[000:38:30;257] WOULD TAKE FOR NORTH KOREA TO
[000:38:31;559] DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY, THE HEAT
[000:38:36;731] SHIELDING TO PUT A NUCLEAR
[000:38:42;737] WARHEAD ON A BALLISTIC MISSILE.
[000:38:43;971] THEY HAVE NUKES FOR INTERMEDIATE
[000:38:46;574] RANGE MISSILES THAT CAN HIT
[000:38:48;709] JAPAN.
[000:38:49;010] BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY GET TOO
[000:38:51;078] FAR INTO THE AMERICAN HOMELAND.
[000:38:53;047] THAT'S THAT FOUR-YEAR TIME
[000:38:55;349] FRAME.
[000:38:55;916] PEOPLE SAY THREE, SOME SAY FIVE.
[000:38:57;752] IT'S REALLY CLOSE.
[000:38:59;453] PROBABLY WITHIN PRESIDENT
[000:39:01;155] TRUMP'S TERM.
[000:39:02;823] >> Shepard: IS PERCEIVED
[000:39:04;191] DISARRAY IN WASHINGTON, DOES
[000:39:06;560] THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON NORTH
[000:39:10;431] KOREA RIGHT NOW?
[000:39:11;999] >> YES, WITH HISTORY AS A GUIDE.
[000:39:14;168] THEY THEY WE'RE NOT LOOKING OR
[000:39:15;736] WE'RE NOT IN A CAPACITY TO
[000:39:17;438] RESPOND.
[000:39:18;072] RIGHT NOW WITH THE FOE
[000:39:18;839] CONTRIBUTION ON DOMESTIC
[000:39:20;374] AFFAIRS, IT'S A PERFECT TIME FOR
[000:39:21;942] KIM JONG-UN TO SET OFF THAT
[000:39:24;178] SIXTH NUCLEAR TEST.
[000:39:25;479] HE WANTED TO NOT DO IT BEFORE
[000:39:27;014] MAY 9th.
[000:39:27;982] THAT'S THE SOUTH KOREAN
[000:39:29;917] ELECTION.
[000:39:30;284] HE DIDN'T WANT TO DERAIL THE
[000:39:32;219] CHANCES OF THE NEW PRESIDENT WHO
[000:39:33;888] IS PRO NORTH KOREA.
[000:39:35;156] NOW MOON HAS BEEN ELECTED.
[000:39:37;258] NORTH KOREA CAN SET THAT TEST
[000:39:38;626] OFF ANY TIME THEY THINK IS
[000:39:41;295] POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS.
[000:39:43;464] I THINK THEY WILL WAIT A FEW
[000:39:45;332] WEEKS.
[000:39:45;900] WE'LL WAIT.
[000:39:47;001] >> Shepard: GORDON CHANG.
[000:39:48;702] THANKS.
[000:39:49;370] >> THANKS, SHEP.
[000:39:51;338] >> Shepard: AND MITCH McCONNELL
[000:39:56;077] SAID WOMEN CAN TALK PART IN ALL
[000:39:59;080] TALKS ON THE HEALTHCARE BILL.
[000:40:01;615] McCONNELL SAID THE MEETINGS ARE
[000:40:03;017] NOW OPEN TO ANY REPUBLICAN
[000:40:04;585] SENATOR THAT WANTS TO ATTEND.
[000:40:05;853] SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN
[000:40:06;921] WORKING ON THE HEALTHCARE BILL
[000:40:08;656] SINCE THE HOUSE PASSED ITS
[000:40:10;157] VERSION LAST WEEK.
[000:40:10;891] MIKE EMANUEL IS ON CAPITOL HILL
[000:40:12;026] WITH AN UPDATE.
[000:40:13;294] MIKE?
[000:40:13;594] >> SHEP, GOOD AFTERNOON.

[000:40:16;597] IMPACT OF THE HOUSE HELD CARE
[000:40:17;765] BILL IS EXPECTED IN THE NEXT TEN

[000:40:22;436] FROM THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
[000:40:25;072] OFFICE.
[000:40:25;406] MITCH McCONNELL HAS BEEN DOING
[000:40:27;141] OUTREACH TO WOMEN SENATORS
[000:40:28;676] ACCORDING TO SENATE SOURCES.
[000:40:30;945] McCONNELL AIDES SAY HE'S INVITED
[000:40:32;680] ALL SENATORS TO ATTEND
[000:40:34;515] HEALTHCARE WORKING GROUP
[000:40:36;283] MEETINGS AFTER TAKING HEAT THAT
[000:40:37;785] THE GROUP WAS MADE UP OF 13 MEN.
[000:40:40;154] >> LET ME TRY AGAIN.
[000:40:43;557] THERE IS NO PARTICULAR WORKING
[000:40:44;692] GROUP BECAUSE WE'RE MEETING --
[000:40:47;795] ALL 52 OF US HAVE LUNCH EVERY
[000:40:51;398] DAY.
[000:40:52;933] TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.
[000:40:54;268] EVERYBODY IS AT THE TABLE.
[000:40:56;036] >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BASIS
[000:40:58;539] WAS FOR MAKING UP THIS GROUP.
[000:41:02;076] REALLY IS UP TO THE LEADERS TO
[000:41:05;679] DECIDE WHOM THEY WANT.
[000:41:06;914] SO I'M NOT REALLY TROUBLED BY IT
[000:41:10;718] BECAUSE I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO
[000:41:13;320] WORK WITH OTHER SENATORS AND
[000:41:19;560] PUSH FORWARD THE BILL THAT WE
[000:41:21;662] INTRODUCED.
[000:41:22;096] >> THERE'S CURRENTSLY FIVE
[000:41:25;332] REPUBLICAN WOMEN SENATORS AND
[000:41:26;634] THEY SOUND INTERESTED IN
[000:41:27;668] ATTENDING THE MEETINGS GOING
[000:41:29;236] FORWARD, SHEP.
[000:41:29;737] >> Shepard: WHAT ARE THE FOCUS
[000:41:30;938] POINTS OF THE HEALTHCARE TALKS,
[000:41:32;406] MIKE?
[000:41:32;706] >> I'M TOLD THE MAJOR AREAS OF
[000:41:34;475] DISCUSSIONS ARE DIVIDED INTO
[000:41:37;178] FOUR KEY GROUPS, MAJOR BUCKETS
[000:41:39;180] THEY'RE LOOKING AT.
[000:41:40;314] FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICAID EXPANDED
[000:41:42;216] UNDER OBAMACARE.
[000:41:43;551] WHAT DO THEY DO GOING FORWARD?
[000:41:46;353] THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT AN ABRUPT
[000:41:49;156] CUT OFF.
[000:41:50;224] TAX CREDITS TO HELP POOR PEOPLE
[000:41:52;259] AFFORD INSURANCE.
[000:41:52;860] INSURANCE REGULATIONS INCLUDING
[000:41:54;828] PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.
[000:41:55;462] MANY REGULATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN
[000:41:57;364] OBAMACARE, MANY REPUBLICANS WANT
[000:41:58;699] TO GET RID OF THEM.
[000:42:00;167] SOME ARE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED
[000:42:01;635] ABOUT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING
[000:42:05;105] CONDITIONS.
[000:42:05;506] AND THEN INSURANCE MARKET
[000:42:06;607] STABILITY.
[000:42:06;974] MANY HEADLINES ABOUT INSURERS
[000:42:09;577] PULLING OUT OF OFFERING PLANS IN
[000:42:10;778] CERTAIN STATES.
[000:42:14;215] HOW DO YOU GET MORE COMPETITION
[000:42:15;583] FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS?
[000:42:16;417] AS WE HEARD BEFORE, IT'S
[000:42:18;319] COMPLICATED.
[000:42:18;719] >> Shepard: THANKS, MIKE.
[000:42:19;753] IN OHIO TODAY, SIX CHILDREN ARE
[000:42:21;388] LIVING WITH A TERRIBLE NEW
[000:42:23;090] REALITY.
[000:42:23;624] THEIR FATHER, THE POLICE CHIEF,
[000:42:25;159] WILL NEVER WALK THROUGH THE DOOR
[000:42:26;994] AGAIN.
[000:42:27;294] HE RESPONDED TO A REPORT OF A
[000:42:28;896] GUNMAN AT A NURSING HOME.
[000:42:30;564] THE GUNMAN SHOT HIM DEAD.
[000:42:32;700] THAT BRAVE POLICE CHIEF WAS ONE
[000:42:33;901] OF THE VICTIMS THIS MORNING.
[000:42:36;503] AHEAD, THE EFFORT TO FIND OUT
[000:42:37;371] WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY.
[000:43:38;232] Hey, The Future,
[000:43:38;232] what's her problem?
[000:43:40;701] Apparently, I kept her up
[000:43:40;701] all night.
[000:43:42;236] She said The Future
[000:43:42;236] freaks her out.
[000:43:44;104] How come no one
[000:43:44;104] likes me, Jim?
[000:43:45;606] Intel does!
[000:43:46;707] Just think of everything
[000:43:46;707] Intel's doing right now
[000:43:48;375] with Artificial Intelligence.
[000:43:49;743] And pretty soon AI
[000:43:49;743] is going to help executives
[000:43:52;046] like her see trends to stay
[000:43:52;046] ahead of her competition.
[000:43:55;015] No more sleepless nights.
[000:43:57;418] - We're going to be friends!
[000:43:57;418] - I'm sorry about this.
[000:43:59;620] Don't be embarrassed
[000:43:59;620] of me, Jim.
[000:44:00;788] I'm getting excited
[000:44:00;788] about this!
[000:44:02;790] We know the future.
[000:44:03;624] We're going to be friends!
[000:44:04;591] Because we're building it.
[000:45:43;290] >> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS NOW.

[000:45:58;739] BEGUN A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE

[000:46:11;385] DEPARTMENT TO HEAR FROM HIM.
[000:46:12;886] THE SUSPECT IS DEAD.
[000:46:14;755] WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE DIED.

[000:46:39;813] TODAY.
[000:46:40;113] ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS IF
[000:46:42;483] THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN
[000:46:43;984] THE SHOOTER AND THE EMPLOYEES
[000:46:46;320] THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND DEAD.

[000:48:03;397] IT HIT THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH

[000:56:24;097] (announcer VO)
[000:56:24;097] there's a moment of truth.etes,
[000:56:28;568] And now with Victoza®
[000:56:30;003] a better moment of proof.
[000:56:37;610] Victoza® lowers my A1C
[000:56:37;610] and blood sugar
[000:56:40;280] better than
[000:56:40;280] the leading branded pill,
[000:56:42;215] which didn't get me to my goal.
[000:56:45;285] Lowers my A1C better
[000:56:46;820] than the leading
[000:56:46;820] branded injectable.
[000:56:48;455] The one I used to take.
[000:56:54;360] And better than that
[000:56:54;360] diabetes pill I used to take.
[000:57:00;133] (Jeff)
[000:57:00;133] Victoza® works with your body
[000:57:01;768] to lower blood sugar
[000:57:01;768] in three ways--
[000:57:03;970] in the stomach, the liver,
[000:57:05;205] and the pancreas.
[000:57:08;575] And while it
[000:57:08;575] isn't for weight loss,
[000:57:10;043] Victoza® may help you
[000:57:10;043] lose some weight.
[000:57:15;248] Non-insulin Victoza® comes in
[000:57:15;248] a pen and is taken once a day.
[000:57:19;686] (announcer VO)
[000:57:19;686] Victoza® is not recommended
[000:57:21;321] as the first medication
[000:57:21;321] to treat diabetes,
[000:57:23;556] and is not for people
[000:57:23;556] with type 1 diabetes
[000:57:25;859] or diabetic ketoacidosis.
[000:57:28;261] Do not take Victoza® if you have
[000:57:28;261] a personal or family history
[000:57:30;964] of medullary thyroid cancer,
[000:57:32;732] Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia
[000:57:32;732] syndrome type 2,
[000:57:35;368] or if you are allergic
[000:57:35;368] to Victoza®
[000:57:36;870] or any of its ingredients.
[000:57:38;872] Stop taking Victoza®
[000:57:38;872] and call your doctor right away
[000:57:41;274] if you get a lump or swelling
[000:57:41;274] in your neck
[000:57:43;209] or if you develop any allergic
[000:57:43;209] symptoms including itching,
[000:57:45;778] rash, or difficulty breathing.
[000:57:47;780] Serious side effects may happen,
[000:57:47;780] including pancreatitis.
[000:57:51;251] So, stop taking Victoza®
[000:57:51;251] and call your doctor right away
[000:57:54;087] if you have severe pain
[000:57:54;087] in your stomach area.
[000:57:56;689] Tell your doctor
[000:57:56;689] your medical history.
[000:57:58;558] Taking Victoza® with
[000:57:58;558] a sulfonylurea or insulin
[000:58:01;094] may cause low blood sugar.
[000:58:03;096] The most common side effects
[000:58:03;096] are headache, nausea,
[000:58:05;398] diarrhea, and vomiting.
[000:58:07;567] Side effects
[000:58:07;567] can lead to dehydration,
[000:58:09;335] which may cause kidney problems.
[000:58:11;004] Now's the time for
[000:58:12;272] a better moment of proof.
[000:58:13;973] Ask your doctor about Victoza®.
