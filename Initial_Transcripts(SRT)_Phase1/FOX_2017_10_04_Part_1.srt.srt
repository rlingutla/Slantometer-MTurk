ADMINISTRATION.                 
NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN CORNYN

117
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,005
SAYING MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT 
BANNING THESE.                  

118
00:07:54,140 --> 00:08:03,849
NEWT GINGRICH WAS ON THE AIR,   
MAYBE YOU LUMP THEM IN WITH THE 

119
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,718
1934 LAW THAT BANS AUTOMATIC    
WEAPONS BY CIVILIANS.           

120
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,954
TOM COLE ON ANOTHER NETWORK     
SAID, THIS.                     

121
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,989
>> NO QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK 
INTO THAT.                      

122
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,526
AUTOMATIC WEAPONSES -- WHEN I   
SAW THE CLIPS AND HEARD THE     

123
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,295
FIRE, I ASSUMED HE HAD AN       
AUTOMATIC WEAPON.               

124
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,266
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS    
TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE THAT CHEAPLY 

125
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,904
OF TRANSFORMING A SEMIAUTOMATIC 
INTO AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.       

126
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,275
YEAH, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY 
QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT    

127
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:48,593
THAT.                           
>> EVEN REPUBLICANS ARE         

128
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,665
                                
DESCRIBING THIS AS A LOOP HOLE, 

129
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,066
ONE THAT THEY CAN CLOSE QUICKLY.
DEMOCRATS, PEOPLE LIKE JOHN     

130
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,535
LEWIS OUT THERE ON THE STEPS OF 
THE CAPITOL SAYING HOW MANY MORE

131
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,969
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED   
BEFORE WE GET MORE GUN CONTROL  

132
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,070
MEASURES?                       
THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A

133
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,438
CLASH IN CONGRESS OVER HOW FAR  
TO GO IN THE WAKE OF THIS       

134
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,473
INCIDENTS.

TEND TO THE BOUNDED AND THEN    

136
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,009
LET'S HAVE THE POLITICAL        
DISCUSSION, SHEP.               

137
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,176
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE IN
MANDALAY BAY.                   

138
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,211
THANK YOU.                      
THE SECRETARY OF STATE REX      

139
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,980
TILLERSON IS NOT DENYING THAT HE
CALLED PRESIDENT TRUMP A        

140
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,348
BLANKING MORON.                 
THE SECRETARY IS INSISTING THAT 

141
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,816
HE NEVER THREATENED TO QUIT.    
HE'S RESPONDING TO AN NBC NEWS  

142
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:15,253
REPORT THAT MIKE PENCE HAD TO   
CONVINCE SECRETARY TILLERSON NOT

143
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,255
TO STEP DOWN.                   
>> THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS NEVER 

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,660
HAD TO PERSUADE ME TO REMAIN THE
SECRETARY OF STATE BECAUSE I    

145
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,496
HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED LEAVING   
THIS POST.                      

146
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,466
I'M NEW TO WASHINGTON.          
I HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE'S SOME

147
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,537
THAT TRY TO SOW DISSENSION TO   
ADVANCE THEIR OWN AGENDA BY     

148
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:53,391
TEARING OTHERS APART AND AN     
UNDERSTOOD TO UNDERMINE THE     

149
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,793
PRESIDENT'S OWN AGENDA.         
I DO NOT AND I WILL NOT OPERATE 

150
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,794
THAT WAY.                       
>> WHEN A REPORTER ASKED        

151
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,262
SPECIFICALLY WHETHER SECRETARY  
TILLERSON CALLED THE PRESIDENT A

152
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,663
MORON, HE RESPONDED THAT HE     
WASN'T GOING TO DEAL WITH PETTY 

153
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,798
STUFF LIKE THAT.

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,334
HEATHER NAUERT HAS COME FORWARD 
TO DENY THAT CLAIM.             

156
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,337
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

159
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,314
>> THE SECRETARY DOES NOT USE   
THAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE.          

160
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,018
THE SECRETARY DID NOT USE THAT  
TYPE OF LANGUAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT 

161
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,620
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED     
STATES.

>> HE NEVER SAID THAT?          

164
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,129
>> HE DID NOT SAY THAT.         
>> Shepard: SO THERE YOU HAVE

THE PRESIDENT NOW LIVE WITH     

166
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,501
FIRST RESPONDERS.               
WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.          

167
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:42,207
LET'S LISTEN LIVE.

168
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:48,880
ARE GOOD BUT YOU PROVED IT.     
HE'S A SICK, DEMENTED MAN.      

169
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,582
HAVE THEY FOUND OUT ANYTHING    
ELSE?                           

170
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:55,253
>> STILL A LITTLE BIT SOON.     
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD LEADS. 

171
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,122
WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH   
THAT.                           

172
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:01,326
WE'RE GOING TO GET THE ANSWERS. 
>> MIGHT BE SOMEBODY THERE.     

173
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,896
THE WIRES ARE SCREWED UP.       
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THERE.       

174
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,098
I'M GOING TO SAY A FEW WORDS TO 
YOUR GROUP.                     

175
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,835
I WANTED TO SAY HELLO AND       
CONGRATULATE YOU.               

176
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,304
I WAS A FAN BEFORE THIS.        
YOU KNOW THAT.                  

177
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,675
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS     
THAT.                           

178
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,946
A BIG FAN BEFORE THIS.          
YOU CAN BE MORE OF A FAN, I'M   

179
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,281
MORE OF A FAN NOW.              
YOU SHOWED THE WORLD AROUND THE 

180
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,752
WORLD WAS WATCHING AND YOU      
SHOWED WHAT PROFESSIONALISM IS  

181
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,989
ALL ABOUT.                      
SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN TAKE    

182
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,692
PLACE FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND   
HOURS.                          

183
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:38,730
YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.        
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.       

184
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,500
>> A MATTER OF IDENTIFICATION,

YOU DID A GOOD JOB.             

190

HIS OPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO
IT HIMSELF.                     

191
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,530
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU WOULDN'T

00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,680
THEY HAVE MADE A REAL EFFORT,   
JOHN, TO PUT THESE HEROS OF THIS

231
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,084
TRAGEDY FRONT AND CENTER AND    
THESE MEET AND GREETS.          

232
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,687
FOR THOSE JOINING US ON FOX     
TELEVISION STATIONS, HE GAVE AN 

233
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,557
INVITATION TO THOSE IN THE      
HOSPITAL ROOMS, THE O.R.s.      

234
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,159
IF YOU'RE EVER IN WASHINGTON    
D.C., COME SEE ME AT THE WHITE  

235
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,494
HOUSE.                          
I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.          

236
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,697
A CONCERTED EFFORT ON THE PART  
OF THIS WHITE HOUSE.            

237
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,600
GREAT TO SEE.                   
>> ALL THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN AND 

238
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:22,587
AS PRESIDENT, SHEP, PRESIDENT   
TRUMP REALLY WAS A CHAMPION OF  

239
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:30,728
                                
LAW ENFORCEMENT.                

240
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,196
SO MANY CAMPAIGNED EVENTS ACROSS
THE COUNTRY, HE WOULD ALWAYS    

241
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,398
HOLD THEM UP FOR PRAISE.        
HE'S DONE THAT AGAIN AS         

242
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,465
PRESIDENT.                      
ANY TIME HE GETS IN THE SAME    

243
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,867
ROOM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR    
MILITARY FOR THAT MATTER, HE    

244
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,302
ALWAYS HAS THE HIGHEST PRAISE.  
I KNOW THAT HE WAS VERY TAKEN,  

245
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,736
NOT ONLY WITH THE SCOPE AND THE 
DEPTH OF THIS TRAGEDY AND THE   

246
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,938
HORRIBLE FACT THAT SO MANY      
PEOPLE WERE KILLED.             

247
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,406
WHEN THERE WERE BULLETS RAINING 
DOWN FROM THE WINDOWS BEHIND ME,

248
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,278
50, 75 AT A TIME BECAUSE HE HAD 
BIG MAGAZINES, THE OFFICERS TOOK

249
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,948
COVER BUT MOVED TOWARD THE      
DANGER.                         

250
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,418
THEY WERE BLOWING THE DOOR OPEN 
WITHIN MINUTES TO GET INSIDE AND

251
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,987
CLEARLY HAD CORNERED THIS GUY,  
THE SHOOTER.                    

252
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,489
HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE WHEN HE    
KNEW THEY WERE COMING IN THROUGH

253
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,025
THE DOOR.                       
THE FACT THAT AS YOU POINTED    

254
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:09,133
OUT, SO MANY CIVILIANS DOVE ON  
THEIR LOVED ONES OR SACRIFICED  

255
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:17,475
THEIR OWN LIVES OR STOLE PICKUP 
TRUCKS TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE BEDS

256
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,643
BECAUSE THE AMBULANCES WERE SO  
OVERWHELMED.                    

257
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,745
WHEN THEY GOT TO THE HOSPITALS, 
THE DOCTORS AND NURSES ON STAFF 

258
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,215
AND ALL OF THE MEDICAL STAFF    
FROM ACROSS THE VALLEY HERE THAT

259
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,052
CAME IN TO THE TRAUMA CENTERS   
AND THE HOSPITALS EVEN THOUGH   

260
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,688
THEY WERE OFF DUTY.             
JUST DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO PICK UP

261
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,125
THE PHONE.                      
RAN IN TO HELP WHEN THE SCOPE   

262
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,960
BECAME CLEAR.                   
THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO TAKE    

263
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,696
TIME TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THOSE  
PEOPLE.                         

264
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,899
HE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE DONE AN  
INCREDIBLE SERVICE FOR THEIR    

265
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,268
COMMUNITY.                      
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE WANTS TO 

266
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:50,308
HOLD UP AS AN EXAMPLE NOT ONLY  
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT  

267
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,843
THE WORLD AS WELL TO SAY THIS IS
HOW WE RESPOND TO TRAGEDY IN    

268
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,245
AMERICA AND HOPEFULLY TAKE STEPS
TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING LIKE THIS

269
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,781
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.            
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET

270
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,951
INTO A REAL TUSSLE OF A DEBATE  
IN CAPITOL HILL.                

271
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,653
THERE'S GOING TO BE PEOPLE ON   
ONE SAID THAT SAY WE NEED MORE  

272
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,557
GUN CONTROL MEASURES, PEOPLE ON 
THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS THERE'S

273
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:12,764
SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT
THESE SO-CALLED PUMP STOCKS OR  

274
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,867
SLIDE STOCKS THAT ALLOW         
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO BE     

275
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:22,607
FIRED AT A HIGH RATE OR OTHER   
MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO STOP    

276
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,175
PEOPLE FROM CONVERTING THESE WE 
POPS INTO A HIGH RATE OF FIRE.  

277
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,345
WE DON'T NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN
THAT.                           

278
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:32,283
WE NEED TO ENFORCE EXISTING     
LAWS.                           

279
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,186
EVERYTHING THAT THIS FELLOW     
SEEMED TO DO SHORT OF WHAT HE   

280
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,356
DID SUNDAY NIGHT WAS WITHIN THE 
LETTER OF THE LAW.              

281
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,661
IT'S A DILEMMA HOW THAT DEBATE  
WILL GO FORWARD AS TO WHAT LAW  

282
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,197
COULD BE CRAFTED TO STOP WHAT   
HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT.          

283
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:50,401
ALL OF THIS STUFF IS            
RETROSPECTIVE AS OPPOSED TO     

284
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:55,573
PROSPECTIVE.                    
YOU'RE ALWAYS REACTING TO THE   

285
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,741
LAST INCIDENT.                  
IT'S DIFFICULT AND A HEATED     

286
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:03,948
DEBATE GOING FORWARD, SHEP.     
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN.       

287
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,485
LET'S GO TO A.B. STODDARD.      
GOOD TO SEE YOU.                

288
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,954
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEP.       
>> Shepard: THIS DEBATE WILL    

289
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:17,028
COME, THOSE ON THE GUN CONTROL  
SIDE, ARE PUSHING FOR IT TODAY. 

290
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:20,064
THEIR ARGUMENT IS THERE'S NO    
TIME LIKE ON THE HEELS OF A     

291
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,999
TRAGEDY TO KEEP ANOTHER TRAGEDY 
FROM HAPPENING.                 

292
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:28,106
THAT'S THEIR POSITION.          
>> THEY'RE MAKING AN ARGUMENT   

293
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,607
THAT IS REASONABLE THAT THE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS   

294
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,776
WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND VICTIMS    
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND WANT  

295
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,912
SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.        
IF THIS IS A TERRORIST ATTACK,  

296
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:39,584
WE TALK ABOUT WAYS TO KEEP THE  
HOMELAND SAFE FROM TERRORISTS.  

297
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,721
SO GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES TALK   
ABOUT THE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN 

298
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:50,261
SHOW LOOP HOLE AND LOOK AT THE  
ACCESSORIES LIKE THE BUMP STOP  

299
00:18:50,395 --> 00:19:03,908
MECHANISM TO MAKE A             
SEMIAUTOMATIC TO AN AUTOMATIC   

300
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,042
WEAPON.                         
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING IN THIS

301
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,544
INCREDIBLY POLARIZED TIME, SHEP,
WITH THIS DEBATE THAT NEVER GOES

302
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,912
ANYWHERE, THAT THERE'S SOME     
REPUBLICANS WILLING TO LOOK     

303
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:12,517
AT -- YOU PLAYED CLIPS FROM TOM 
COLE, THE REPUBLICAN, REPORTS   

304
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,653
THAT SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, THE   
NUMBER 2 IN LEADERSHIP ON THE   

305
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:19,624
SENATE SIDE IS INTERESTED.      
I READ THAT CONGRESSMAN BILL    

306
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,226
FLORES FROM TEXAS IS INTERESTED 
IN IT.                          

307
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:27,465
SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME          
INCREMENTAL PATH FORWARD TO SOME

308
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,003
KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING 
TO DO THIS KIND OF WEAPONRY     

309
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:36,007
WHERE 800 ROUNDS CAN GO OFF IN A
MINUTE AND KILL SO MANY         

310
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,309
PEOPLING.                       
GENERALLY SPEAKING, I'LL BE     

311
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,679
SURPRISED IF IT DOES BECAUSE    
THEY BREAK DOWN SO QUICKLY IN   

312
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,016
ALL OF THIS POLARIZING AND ALL  
OF THE DIFFERENCES AND IF DEBATE

313
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,287
GOES NOWHERE BECAUSE OF THE     
VOTES AND THE WAY THEY'RE SET UP

314
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,657
IN CONGRESS NOW.                
>> Shepard: ALL RIGHT, A.B.     

315
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,159
STODDARD LIVE FROM WASHINGTON.  
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

318

RESPONDERS.                     

319

THIS IS THE THIRD SET WE'VE SEEN
ON CAMERA.                      

320
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,341
FOLKS SITTING AROUND, WAITING TO
MEET THE PRESIDENT,             

321
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,743
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AS HE MAKES  
THE ROUNDS THERE IN LAS VEGAS.  

322
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:13,978
WE'LL HAVE COVERAGE OF THAT ON  
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.               

323

FOX NEWS, NEW YORK.

AS WE CONTINUE HERE ON FOX NEWS 
CHANNEL, WE'RE WAITING FOR THESE

TO MEET THE HEROS OF LAS VEGAS  
THIS HELPED SAVE LIVES DURING   

331
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,838
THE SHOOTING.                   
FIRST, THE LATEST FROM THE      

332
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:45,142
INVESTIGATORS ON SCENE AND THE  
PICTURES NOW THAT SHOW THE      

333
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:51,349
INSIDE OF THE MURDER'S SWEET.   
THAT'S COMING UP ON THE FOX NEWS

334
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,283
DECK THIS AFTERNOON.            

335
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,190
         I was always           
   "the girl with psoriasis."   

336
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,725
  People don't stare anymore.   

337
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,827
       I never joined in.       

338
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,895
 That wasn't fair to any of us. 

339
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,097
         I was covered.         

340
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,366
     I tried lots of things     
        over the years.         

341
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,700
     But I didn't give up.      

342
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,302
      I kept on fighting.       

343
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,004
 I found something that worked. 

344
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,472
       That still works.        

345
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,339
              Now?              

346
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,173
            SEE ME.             

347
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,391
            SEE ME.             

348
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,110
 I found clear skin that lasts. 

349

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:47,665
AND HIS INTENT.                 
REMEMBER, THEY FOUND DOZENS AND 

472
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,199
DOZENS OF WEAPONS INSIDE THE    
HOMES THAT SHE LIVED IN WITH HIM

473
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,536
ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVES AND       
SUITCASES OF AMMUNITION.        

474
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,906
THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT
SHE KNEW ABOUT THAT.            

475
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,143
HER FAMILY SAYS THAT THE REASON 
HE SENT HER TO THE PHILIPPINES  

476
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,246
IS BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT   
SHE WOULD STOP HIM FROM COMMITS 

477
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,286
THIS CRIME.                     
LISTEN TO THE FAMILY AGAIN.     

478
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:14,892
>> NOBODY CAN PUT IT TOGETHER   
EXCEPT MARILOU.                 

479
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:20,397
ONLY MARILOU CAN MAYBE HELP.    
>> INVESTIGATORS ARE INTERESTED 

480
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,468
IN THE $100,000 THAT STEPHEN    
PADDOCK SENT TO PHILIPPINES IN  

481
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,303
RECENT WEEKS.                   
THE SPIC YOULATION IS THAT HE   

482
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,273
SENT IT TO HER BECAUSE HE KNEW  
AS SOON AS HE COMMITTED THE     

483
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,576
CRIME THAT ALL OF HIS ASSETS    
WOULD BE LOCKED DOWN POSSIBLY   

484
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,979
FOREVER AND SHE WOULDN'T GET ANY
KIND OF MONEY OUT OF THAT AT    

485
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,815
ALL.                            
WE SHOULD KNOW THIS FBI         

486
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,451
INTERVIEW IN LOS ANGELES COULD  
GO FOR SEVERAL MORE HOURS.      

487
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,386
THERE'S A NEWS CONFERENCE COMING
UP.                             

488
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,788
WE HOPE TO GET MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GLEANING FROM

489
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,657

490
