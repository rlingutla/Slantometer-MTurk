THE OFFICER SNEAKING OUT AS HE  
TRIED TO                        

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,741
BYSTANDERS TRIED TO HELP.       
HE OPENED THE DOOR AND GOT THE  

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,610
SNAKE OUT.

I'M SANDRA SMITH.               

5

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:28,193
>> A GIANT BEFORE MASSIVE, THE  
BIGGEST EVER IN OUR COUNTRY TAX 

8
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,030
CUT.                            
>> BUT AFTER SETBACKS IN        

9
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,666
CONGRESS ON HEALTHCARE, WILL    
REPUBLICANS GET ANYTHING PASSED?

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:40,305
WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR YOU?     
WE'LL TALK TO CHRIS WALLACE FROM

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,141
"FOX NEWS SUNDAY."              
AND THE PRESIDENT PUSHING BACK  

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,343
CLAIMS ON A SLOW RESPONSE IN    
PUERTO RICO.                    

13
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,147
EVEN AS WE HEAR ABOUT NEW       
STORIES ABOUT SUFFERINGFTER     

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,684
THE DEADLY STORM.               
GERALDO RIVERA IS LIVE.         

15
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,221
AND A NEW WARNING FOR ANYBODY   
THINKING ABOUT A TRIP TO CUBA.  

16
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:02,227
AMERICANS GETTING SICK IN A     
SERIES OF BIZARRE ATTACKS.      

17
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,762
THE FEDS SAY THEY STILL DON'T   
KNOW WHO IS TARGETING AMERICANS.

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:14,273
THAT'S AHEAD THIS HOUR ON       
"SHEPARD SMITH REPORTING."      

19
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:19,311
I'M TRACE GALLAGHER.            
PRESIDENT TRUMP PRAISING THE NEW

20
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:25,217
TAX PLAN AND PRAISING THE       
BIGGEST TAX CUT HISTORY.        

21
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:29,121
HE ALSO PROMISED TO MAKE THE TAX
CODES SIMPLE, EASY AND FAIR AND 

22
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:33,425
HE SAYS THE U.S. NEEDS TO       
ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO STAY IN  

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,229
AMERICA.                        
>> ONE TEAM, ONE PEOPLE AND ONE 

24
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,299
GREAT AMERICAN FAMILY.          
THIS CAN BE REMEMBERED AS THE   

25
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:46,205
MOMENT WE TOOK CONTROL OF OUR   
DESTINY AND CHOSE A FUTURE OF   

26
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:49,374
AMERICAN PATRIOTISM, PROSPERITY 
AND PRIDE.                      

27
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,077
>> THE WHITE HOUSE AND          
REPUBLICAN LEADERS HAVE RELEASED

28
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:59,952
A FRAME WORK FOR OVERHAULING THE
TAX CODE BUT STILL MISSING A FEW

29
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,354
DETAILS.                        
IT CALLS FOR DOUBLING THE AMOUNT

30
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:08,494
THAT ISN'T TAXED FOR $12,000 FOR
INDIVIDUALS AND $24,000 FOR     

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,864
MARRIED COUPLES.                
HE WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF   

32
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:16,101
TAX BRACKETS TO THREE, 12%, 25% 
AND 35%.                        

33
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,871
STILL NO WORD ON WHAT INCOME    
LEVELS FALL UNDER EACH BRACKET. 

34
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,774
THE PLAN WOULD GET RID OF THE   
ESTATE TAX, WHICH CRITICS CALL  

35
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,877
THE DEATH TAX.                  
SOME DEMOCRATS SAY THE PLAN     

36
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,846
DOESN'T DO ENOUGH FOR THE MIDDLE
CLASS.                          

37
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:33,018
SENATE MINORITY LEADER CHUCK    
SCHUMER CALLED IT A SWEEPING TAX

38
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:40,159
CUT FOR MILLIONS AND            
BILLIONAIRES.                   

39
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,527
THE PRESIDENT SAYS PLAN DOES NOT
BENEFIT THE WEALTHY.            

40
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,761
JOHN ROBERTS IS LIVE FOR US AT  
THE WHITE HOUSE.                

41
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:43,862
JOHN?                           
>> TRACE, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,331
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MAKING   
THIS CASE FOR WEEKS NOW.        

43
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,269
NOW HE HAS MORE MEAT ON THE BONE
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU TALKED     

44
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,439
ABOUT THERE.                    
THE ACTUAL PROPOSAL.            

45
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,608
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE TAX CUT
ON INDIVIDUALS.                 

46
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,645
TODAY HE WENT TO THE NATIONAL   
ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS IN 

47
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,948
D.C. FOR THEIR CONVENTION AND   
OUTLINED TO THEM WHAT ALL OF    

48
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,017
THIS WOULD MEAN FOR             
CORPORATIONS.                   

49
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,352
HERE'S WHAT IT WOULD MEAN.      
THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING TO   

50
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:13,825
CUT THE CORPORATE TAX FROM AN   
AVERAGE OF 35% DOWN TO 20%.     

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,030
THE SMALL BUSINESS TAX RATE AND 
THIS WOULD INCLUDE S CORPS,     

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:24,403
PASS-THROUGHS, SO               
PROPRIETORSHIPS AND LLCS TO MAX 

53
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:30,509
OUT AT 25% AND IMMEDIATE FULL   
EXPENSES OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

54
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,213
FOR FIVE YEARS.                 
IF YOU WERE TO BUY A NEW TRUCK  

55
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:38,050
OR EQUIPMENT OR A BACKHOE,      
COMPUTERS, YOU CAN WRITE IT ALL 

56
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,852
IMMEDIATELY AND DO THAT FOR A   
PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS.           

57
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:46,825
SO FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING
TO RETOOL OR EXPAND, THAT WOULD 

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,327
BE AN ENORMOUS BOON FOR THEM.   
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID  

59
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,763
IN TERMS OF WHAT HE WANTS THIS  
TO DO FOR THE COUNTRY.          

60
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,901
LISTEN HERE.                    
>> THIS IS A REVOLUTIONARY      

61
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,769
CHANGE.                         
THE BIGGEST WINNERS WILL BE     

62
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,140
EVERY DAY WORKING FAMILIES AS   
JOBS START POURING INTO OUR     

63
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,409
COUNTRY.                        
WHEN COMPANIES LEAVE OUR SHORES,

64
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,746
IT'S AMERICAN WORKERS THAT GET  
HURT.                           

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,383
THEY GET FIRED.                 
WHEN COMPANIES STAY IN AMERICA  

66
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:18,156
AND MOVE TO AMERICA, IT'S OUR   
WONDERFUL WORKERS THAT REAP THE 

67
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,591
BENEFITS AND THE REWARDS.       
>> DEMOCRATS THOUGH DON'T LIKE  

68
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,593
THIS PLAN TOO MUCH.             
YOU MENTIONED CHUCK SCHUMER AT  

69
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,263
THE TOP.                        
HE SAID CUTTING TAXES FOR THE   

70
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:28,600
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND GIANT  
CORPORATIONS LEADS TO BIGGER CEO

71
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:33,839
BONUSES, MORE STOCK BUY-BACKS   
AND DIVIDENDS FOR SHAREHOLDERS, 

72
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,908
NOT JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES.      
THE PRESIDENT SAYS IF YOU MAKE  

73
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,778
AMERICA A GOOD PLACE TO DO      
BUSINESS, COMPANIES WILL STAY   

74
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:43,415
HERE AS OPPOSED TO MOVING THEIR 
MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR      

75
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,051
HEADQUARTERS OVERSEAS.          
THAT WILL ATTRACT MORE          

76
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:52,291
INVESTMENT FROM OVERSEAS AND    
THAT WILL BENEFIT AMERICAN      

77
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:52,958
WORKERS.                        
TRACE?                          

78
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,326
>> JOHN ROBERTS STAY WITH US FOR
A MOMENT IF YOU WOULD.          

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,827
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUING TO     
DEFEND HIS ADMINISTRATION'S     

80
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,097
RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATION IN  
PUERTO RICO.                    

81
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,134
DURING HIS TAX EVENT, THE       
PRESIDENT STARTED TALKING ABOUT 

82
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,804
THE CRISIS AFFECTING MORE THAN  
THREE MILLION AMERICANS.        

83
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,741
HE SAYS THE U.S. WILL NOT REST  
UNTIL THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO 

84
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,744
ARE SAFE.                       
>> WE WANT TO TAKE IN A MASSIVE 

85
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,280
FEDERAL MOBILIZATION TO ASSIST  
PUERTO RICO.                    

86
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:22,821
NOW VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING HAS    
BEEN WIPED OUT AND WE WILL HAVE 

87
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,624
TO REALLY START ALL OVER AGAIN. 
WE'RE LITERALLY STARTING FROM   

88
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,826
SCRATCH.                        
>> PEOPLE IN THE U.S. TERRITORY 

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,531
LIVING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY,     
DRINKING WATER, FOOD AND MEDICAL

90
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,932
SUPPLIES.                       
SOME SAY THEY'RE STILL WAITING  

91
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,201
FOR AID.                        
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THOUSANDS OF 

92
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,570
TROOPS AND FEDERAL RELIEF       
WORKERS ARE THERE.              

93
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:43,942
HE ALSO SAYS THE U.S. IS SENDING
TRUCK DRIVERS TO HELP GET THE   

94
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,878
SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE INLAND.      
THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THIS  

95
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,214
COMMENT FROM THE ISLAND'S       
GOVERNOR THAT TOLD NEIL CAVUTO  

96
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:57,055
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING WHAT HE  
CAN.                            

97
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,423
>> HAS THE AMERICAN RESPONSE    
BEEN SATISFACTORY TO YOU?       

98
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:03,662
>> YES, IT HAS, NEIL.           
I WANT TO CLARIFY THESE TWO     

99
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,631
POINTS THAT SOMETIMES THAT SEEM 
CONTRADICTORY.                  

100
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,835
NUMBER 1, WE DO NEED MORE AID   
BUT THE PRESIDENT AND THE       

101
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,272
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE         
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN, THAT  

102
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,944
WE HAVE ASKED THEM TO DO AND    
WE'VE GOTTEN THOSE RESULTS.     

103
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,013
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ALSO
FACING BACKLASH OVER COMMENTS

00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:30,155
FROM THE ACTING HOMELAND        
SECURITY SECRETARY, ELAINE DUKE.

105
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,723
YESTERDAY TOLD REPORTERS THE    
FEDERAL RELIEF EFFORT IS A GOOD 

106
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:32,591
NEWS STORY.                     
THAT'S A QUOTE.                 

107
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,826
THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN CALLED THE
STATEMENT IRRESPONSIBLE.        

108
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,763
SHE SAID IT'S A PEOPLE ARE DYING
STORY.                          

109
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,499
LET'S GET BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS  
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.             

110
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,568
JOHN?                           
>> AND THE ACTING DHS SECRETARY 

111
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,271
WAS ASKED ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY, 
TRACE.                          

112
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,242
SAYING THAT PEOPLE ON THE GROUND
THERE ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE ON

113
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,944
THE VERGE OF A CATASTROPHE      
THERE.                          

114
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,181
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THEY'RE    
DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET

115
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:02,821
AS MUCH AID TO PUERTO RICO AS   
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.            

116
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,256
THE BIG PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN    
CAPACITY TO GET GOODS AND       

117
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,490
SERVICES THERE.                 
IT'S TO GET THEM FROM THE PORT  

118
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,126
CITIES OUT TO THE AREAS OF THE  
COUNTRY THAT HAVE BEEN SO HARD  

119
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,029
HIT.                            
THEY SAY DEBRIS CLOGS THE       

120
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,565
ROADWAYS.                       
OFTEN ONLY ONE WAY IN AND ONE   

121
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,170
WAY OUT.                        
THE PRESIDENT AS HIS HELICOPTER 

122
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:22,574
IS ARRIVING HERE KEEPS SAYING   
THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB AND    

123
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:28,713
GETTING GOOD REVIEWS.           
THE PRESIDENT TWEETING GOVERNOR 

124
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:35,754
ROSELLA SAID EVERY TIME WE HAVE 
SPOKEN, THEY HAVE DELIVERED.    

125
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,122
THE FACT IS THAT PUERTO RICO HAS
BEEN DESTROYED BY TWO           

126
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,223
HURRICANES.                     
BIG DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO BE   

127
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,257
MADE AS TO THE COST OF          
REBUILDING.                     

128
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,326
FOR THE MOMENT IN TERMS OF      
DEBRIS CLEARING, THE FEDERAL    

129
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,162
GOVERNMENT IS PICKING UP 100% OF
THE COST.                       

130
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,432
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT THERE   
WILL NEED TO BE SOME DIFFICULT  

131
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:52,537
CONVERSATIONS AHEAD TO FIGURE   
OUT HOW AND WHO WILL PAY TO     

132
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,738
BUILT PUERTO RICO.              
LISTEN HERE.                    

133
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:58,844
>> ULTIMATELY, THE GOVERNMENT OF
PUERTO RICO WILL HAVE TO WORK   

134
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,581
WITH US TO DETERMINE HOW THIS   
MASSIVE REBUILDING EFFORT WILL  

135
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:10,622
END UP BEING ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
EVER, WILL BE FUNDED AND        

136
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,026
ORGANIZED.                      
AND WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE    

137
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,898
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EXISTING   
DEBT ALREADY ON THE ISLAND.     

138
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:25,570
WE WILL NOT REST, HOWEVER, UNTIL
THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO ARE   

139
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:26,638
SAFE.                           
>> FLORIDA GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT  

140
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,307
WAS HERE AWHILE AGO.            
OF COURSE, HIS STATE WAS PICKING

141
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,244
UP FROM HURRICANE IRMA.         
HE'S ALSO VERY MUCH INVOLVED    

142
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,312
WITH HELPING OUT THE PEOPLE OF  
PUERTO RICO.                    

143
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:41,486
HE SAID THE LOGISTICS FOR       
HELPING OUT PUERTO RICO         

144
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,787
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM       
FLORIDA OR FROM TEXAS.          

145
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,457
BECAUSE IT'S AN ISLAND, VERY    
MOUNTAINOUS WITH LIMITED ACCESS 

146
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,927
TO MANY AREAS MEANS THERE'S MANY
PROBLEM THAT THEY DIDN'T DEAL   

147
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,663
WITH IN EITHER FLORIDA, TEXAS OR
LOUISIANA.                      

148
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,433
HE REITERATED THIS IDEA THAT    
THEY HAVE TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN 

149
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,937
THERE AS WELL AND METHODS TO GET
THOSE SUPPLIES FROM THE PORT    

150
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,206
CITIES OUT TO THE HARDEST HIT   
AREAS.                          

151
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,642
LISTEN TO RICK SCOTT HERE.      
>> I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT    

152
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,044
ABOUT IT.                       
I TOLD HIM, OF COURSE, THE      

153
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,114
BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW IN      
PUERTO RICO IS WE NEED MORE     

154
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:14,719
TRUCK DRIVERS AND WE NEED MORE  
TRUCKS.                         

155
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,321
WE HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING OUT OF
THE PORT, WHETHER IT'S THE FUEL,

156
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,455
THE WATER.                      
THE BIGGEST THING IS THE FUEL.  

157
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,124
THEIR ISSUE IS DIFFERENT FROM   
FLORIDA.                        

158
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,760
WE HAD A PROBLEM OF GETTING FUEL
IN TO THE PORTS.                

159
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,329
THEY HAD THE FUEL.              
THEY HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF THE  

160
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,997
PORTS.                          
>> AGAIN, THE PROBLEM IS GETTING

161
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,900
STUFF OUT OF THE PORTS.         
THE U.S. SENATE IS GOING TO HAVE

162
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:33,505
ITS CHANCE TO WEIGH-IN ON THIS. 
THEY'LL BE MEETING WITH THE FEMA

163
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,773
ADMINISTRATOR, BROCK LONG       
MONDAY.                         

164
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,909
SEE HOW THAT GOES, TRACE.       
>> YEAH, THEY HAD A LOT OF      

165
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,546
VOLUNTEERS IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA.
VERY FEW IN PUERTO RICO BECAUSE 

166
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:47,552
EVERYBODY IS AFFECTED.          
JOHN ROBERTS, LIVE FOR US.      

167
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,587
THANK YOU.                      
MORE NOW ON HOW THE U.S.        

168
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,955
MILITARY IS RESPONDING TO THE   
CRISIS IN PUERTO RICO.          

169
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,357
DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAY THEY'RE   
PUTTING A THREE-STAR ARMY       

170
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,460
GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE

PENTAGON.                       

172
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,966
LUCAS?                          
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, TRACE.       

173
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,070
ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO, THE        
HOSPITAL SHIP COMFORT SET SAIL  

174
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,206

IN PUERTO RICO TUESDAY.         

175
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,610
>> MY ORDERS ARE A MINIMUM OF 30
DAYS.                           

176
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,714
YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THOSE ARE      
DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE MUCH    

177
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:21,052
ABOVE OUR LEVEL.                
WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL GO OUT   

178
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,587
THERE AND HIT THE GROUND RUNNING
OR HIT THE DECK PLATES RAINING  

179
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,024
AS WE SAY IN THE NAVY AND WE'LL 
KEEP MOVING UNTIL SOMEBODY TELLS

180
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:30,395
US THAT WE'RE NO LONGER NEEDED. 
>> SOME CRITICS SAID THE SHIP   

181
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,598
WOULD HAVE LEFT SOONER BUT      
CAPTAIN ROBINSON SAID TWO DAYS  

182
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,835
AGO, THERE WERE LESS THAN 100   
PEOPLE ON BOARD.                

183
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,105
NOW THERE'S OVER 800 DOCTORS AND
CREW.                           

184
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:46,211

AMERICA AND TREATED OVER 120,000

185
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:53,118
PEOPLE.                         
THE SHIP HAS SIX EMERGENCY ROOMS

186
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,819
AND HUNDREDS OF BEDS.           
TODAY THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS ONE

187
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,022
HOSPITAL IN PUERTO RICO IS FULLY
FUNCTIONAL.                     

188
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,126
NOW THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

            with the pole, and I

              They took forever 
              to pay you, right?

249
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,949

00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,451
              Wouldn't even call
              you back, right?  

252
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,953

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS SAY THEY'RE

FOCUSES ON THEIR TAX PLAN AFTER 
THE SENATE FAILED TO PASS OF    

264
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,086
HEALTHCARE BILL.                
PAUL RYAN SAID IT WAS           

265
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,222
FRUSTRATING.                    
SO WILL THEY HAVE BETTER LUCK   

266
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,592
WITH TAXES THAN HEALTHCARE?     
LET'S BRING IN "FOX NEWS SUNDAY"

267
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,794
ANCHOR CHRIS WALLACE.           
GREAT TO SEE YOU, CHRIS.        

268
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,430
IT'S FUNNY.                     
A LOT OF THIS STUFF IS MARKETING

269
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,067
WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS.      
DID LAUGH WHEN GARY COHN, THE   

270
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,705
WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER WAS
AT THE PRESS BRIEFING SAYING THE

271
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,942
AVERAGE RETURN FOR MIDDLE CLASS 
AMERICANS WILL BE ABOUT $1,000. 

272
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:16,781
SO YOU CAN REMODEL YOUR KITCHEN.
THE INTERNET WENT CRAZY AND     

273
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,550
SAID, YOU KNOW, $1,000?         
HAS HE WATCHED HGTV?            

274
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:23,021
YOU CAN'T EVEN BUY A DISHWASHER 
FOR $1,000.                     

275
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:27,125
GIVES YOU THAT, YOU KNOW, NOTION
THEY'RE HAVING A TOUGH TIME     

276
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,828
MARKETING HOW TO REALLY GET THIS
TAX PLAN, YOU KNOW, TO THE HEART

277
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,431
OF THE MATTER AND GET IT SOLD TO
PEOPLE.                         

278
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,701
>> YEAH, A COUPLE THINGS GARY   
COHN SAID.                      

279
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:41,005
HE ALSO SAID THE AVERAGE MIDDLE 
INCOME FAMILY MAKES $100,000.   

280
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:48,646
I WAS STUNNED BY THAT.          
THE MEDIAN INCOME FAMILY IN THIS

281
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,014
COUNTRY MAKES $55,000.          
SO AGAIN, IT RAISES QUESTIONS AS

282
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,716
TO WHETHER OR NOT THE WHITE     
HOUSE UNDERSTANDS.              

283
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,054
LET ME SAY, IF HE HAS A GUY TO  
DO A KITCHEN FOR $1,000, I WANT 

284
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,190
THAT CONTRACTOR RIGHT AWAY.     
THEY'LL HAVE A TOUGH TIME WITH  

285
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,160
THIS.                           
EVERYBODY SAYS WELL, TAX REFORM 

286
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,130
IS EASIER BECAUSE THAT'S THE    
REPUBLICAN MONTRA.              

287
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,666
TAX CUTS.                       
THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIZABLE TAX 

288
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,868
CUTS HERE.                      
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE.    

289
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:16,107
ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE    
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO PAY FOR 

290
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:22,714
WHAT WILL BE ABOUT A $5 TRILLION
CUT IN REVENUE OVER THE NEXT TEN

291
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,883
YEARS IS BY DOING AWAY WITH THE 
DEDUCTION THAT PEOPLE GET FOR   

292
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,653
PAYING YOUR STATE AND LOCAL     
TAXES.                          

293
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:33,992
FOLKS IN HIGH TAX STATES LIKE   
CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK OR A     

294
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,362
BUNCH OF OTHER STATES, THEY     
DON'T LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF THE  

295
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:42,166
FACT THAT IT MEANS THAT THAT'S A
DEDUCTION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO  

296
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,336
GET.                            
NOW, THERE'S 33 REPUBLICANS     

297
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,838
REPRESENTING THOSE HIGH TAX     
STATES.                         

298
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:54,178
THE REPUBLICANS COULD ONLY      
AFFORD IN THE HOUSE TO LOSE 22. 

299
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,713
SO THIS MEANS THE HIGH TAX STATE
REPUBLICANS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF  

300
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,883
THEM ARE BLUE STATES THAT MOSTLY
HAVE DEMOCRATS, BUT THERE'S SOME

301
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,653
REPUBLICANS, THEIR VOTERS WILL  
LOSE A BIG AND IMPORTANT TAX    

302
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,088
DEDUCTION.                      
THEY'RE CONCERNED.              

303
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,657
THEY'LL WANT EITHER SOMETHING IN
COMPENSATION FOR THAT OR TO HAVE

304
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:10,028
THAT PULLED BACK.               
THAT IS A TRILLION DOLLARS OF   

305
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,330
ADDED REVENUE TO THE GOVERNMENT 
ENDING THAT DEDUCTION.          

306
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:18,403
YOU TAKE THAT AWAY, THIS BECOMES
AN EVEN BIGGER LOSS TO THE      

307
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,605
TREASURY.                       
>> Trace: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF   

308
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:27,612
PAUL RYAN'S RANT WHERE HE'S     
SAYING THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STUFF 

309
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,882
GETTING DONE.                   
HE SAID THE 274 BILLS AS OF     

310
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,818
SEPTEMBER 22 HAVE PASSED THE    
HOUSE AND NOT GETTING THE SAME  

311
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,953
IN THE SENATE.                  
HE'S SAYING THEY NEED TO DO     

312
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,156
MORE.                           
IS IT A FAIR ASSESSMENT OR      

313
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,658
SAYING THE HOUSE IS PASSING     
THESE THINGS KNOWING THE SENATE 

314
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,463
WILL FIX THEM, SO IT'S NOT      
REALLY FAIR TO LAY IT ON THE    

315
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,532
SENATE?                         
IS THAT FAIR FROM PAUL RYAN --  

316
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,134
>> HE'S CLEARLY RIGHT.          
THEY ARE PASSING A LOT OF THINGS

317
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,838
IN THE HOUSE.                   
THEY'RE GETTING BOTTLED UP OR   

318
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,007
NOT PASSED OR DEFEATED IN THE   
SENATE.                         

319
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:01,612
BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THE HOUSE 
AND THE SENATE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

320
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,780
BODIES WITH TWO DIFFERENT SETS  
OF RULES.                       

321
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,483
FIRST OF ALL, EXCEPT FOR BUDGET 
RECONCILIATION AND MOST FOLKS   

322
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,053
KNOW BY NOW THAT THAT IS ONE    
BILL A YEAR THAT YOU CAN PASS   

323
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:13,891
WITH 51 VOTES, YOU NEED A SUPER 
MAJORITY, 60 VOTES, BECAUSE THEY

324
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,860
CAN THREATEN THE FILIBUSTER TO  
STOP IT.                        

325
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,464
SO THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT.     
THERE'S DIFFERENT BALANCE OF    

326
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,966
POWER.                          
THEY HAVE A 22-VOTE MAJORITY IN 

327
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,367
THE HOUSE.                      
THE REPUBLICANS DO.             

328
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:27,805
THEY HAVE A TWO-VOTE MAJORITY IN
THE SENATE.                     

329
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,712
THE MARGIN FOR ERROR IS MUCH    
SMALLER IN THE SENATE.          

330
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,449
WE SAW THAT WITH THE OBAMACARE  
DEFEAT.                         

331
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:43,888
IT'S NOT THAT MITCH McCONNELL   
AND THE SENATORS ARE SITTING ON 

332
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,690
THEIR HANDS.                    
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND   

333
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,993
THEY HAVE A MUCH MORE NARROW    
MAJORITY.                       

334
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,730
AS A RESULT, RYAN IS RIGHT.     
MUCH LESS IS GETTING PASSED IN  

335
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,234
THE SENATE.                     
>> YOU KNOW, BELOW YOU, CHRIS,  

336
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,770
THERE'S A PROMOTION FOR SEAN    
HANNITY.                        

337
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:17,588
RUSH LIMBAUGH WAS ON            

338
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,230
                     LAST NIGHT 
AND AGAIN TONIGHT.              

339
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,698
HE SAYS IF THE REPUBLICANS WOULD
COME TOGETHER FOR THREE MONTHS  

340
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,167
AND STAND BEHIND THE PRESIDENT  
AND GET BEHIND HIS BILLS, THEY  

341
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,468
WOULD ACTUALLY OWN POLITICS FOR 
THE NEXT TWO DECADES.           

342
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,702
NEWT GINGRICH CAME ON LATER AND 
AGREED WITH THAT.               

343
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,737
WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THAT 
TAKE?                           

344
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,172
>> AGAIN, THAT'S ONLY FOR THE   
BUDGETS RECONCILIATION MATTERS. 

345
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,540
EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE SENATE,  
THEY CAN'T PASS WITH JUST       

346
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,908
REPUBLICAN VOTES IN THE SENATE. 
THEY NEED EIGHT DEMOCRATS.      

347
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,176
THEY GOT 52 REPUBLICANS, THEY   
NEED EIGHT DEMOCRATS.           

348
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,677
BUT YOU COULD ARGUE IN THE CASE 
OF OBAMACARE REPEAL AND REPLACE 

349
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,079
AND IF THEY CAN PASS A BUDGET   
RESOLUTION IN THE CASE OF TAX   

350
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:46,417
REFORM, IF THEY GOT TOGETHER,   
THEY COULD GET THINGS DONE AND  

351
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,453
PUSH THE TRUMP AGENDA.          
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'VE SEEN  

352
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,024
THIS IN OBAMACARE, I THINK WE'LL
SEE IT IN TAX REFORM AS WELL,   

353
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,692
THERE'S NOT ONE REPUBLICAN      
PARTY.                          

354
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,594
THERE'S A HUGE SPLIT IN THE     
PARTY.                          

355
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:03,234
WE SAW THAT IN 2010 WHEN YOU HAD
THE TEA PARTIERS WIN, HUGE      

356
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,736
VICTORY FOR REPUBLICANS BUT THEY
DIDN'T HAVE TO GOVERN.          

357
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:11,909
THEY WERE RUNNING AGAINST THE   
PRESIDENT WHO WOULD VETO A LOT  

358
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,110
OF THEIR MEASURES.              
NOW THEY HAVE TO GOVERN.        

359
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,582
SO THE SPLITS THAT WERE COVERED 
UP, NOW WITH THE REPUBLICAN     

360
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,517
PRESIDENT WE CAN SEE THERE      
THEY'RE.                        

361
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,953
THEY'RE THERE BIG TIME ON       
HEALTHCARE AND SEE IT TO SOME   

362
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,924
DEGREE ON TAX REFORM AS WELL.   
GOVERNING IS A LOT TOUGHER THAN 

363
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,261
JUST BEING AGAINST AND OPPOSING.
>> Trace: YEAH.                 

364
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:36,867
A LOT OF PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
MADE THAT POINT TO NEWT         

365
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:37,902
GINGRICH.

THAT'S THE WARNING FROM THE     

374
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,601
STATE DEPARTMENT.               
THEY'RE ALSO PULLING HALF OF    

375
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,037
THEIR STAFF OUT OF HAVANA.

DIPLOMATS AND THEIR FAMILIES OUT

377
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:35,206
OF CUBA AFTER MYSTERIOUS SONIC  
ATTACKS AGAINST AMERICANS ON THE

378
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,307
ISLAND.                         
THAT'S WHAT A STATE DEPARTMENT  

379
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,875
OFFICIAL CONFIRMS TO FOX NEWS.  
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED   

380
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,045
THE STATE DEPARTMENT ORDERED    
MORE THAN HALF OF ITS STAFFERS  

381
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,081
TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES.     
THE U.S. IS WARNING AGAINST     

382
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,218
TRAVELLING TO CUBA.             
INVESTIGATORS SAY 21 AMERICAN   

383
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:51,655
DIPLOMATS AND FAMILY MEMBERS    
HAVE COME DOWN WITH A STRANGE   

384
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,126
DISEASE OR SYMPTOMS INCLUDING   
BRAIN DAMAGE, HEARING LOSS AND  

385
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,596
CONCUSSIONS.                    
ACCORDING TO A.P., ONE VICTIM   

386
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:06,737
DESCRIBED WAKING UP IN A HOTEL  
ROOM TO A BLARING NOISE THAT    

387
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:07,805
WENT AWAY WHEN HE GOT OUT OF    
BID.                            

388
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,709
WHEN FBI AGENTS SEARCHED HOTEL  
ROOMS, THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T  

389
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,178
FIND ANY DEVICES.               
CUBAN OFFICIALS HAVE INSISTED   

390
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:18,015
THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE 
INCIDENTS.                      

391
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,085
JOSH LEDERMAN IS A FOREIGN      
AFFAIRS REPORTER THAT COVERS    

392
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,321
NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE       
ASSOCIATED PRESS.               

393
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,225
HE CO-WROTE TODAY'S ARTICLE ON  
THE U.S. PULLING DIPLOMATS OUT  

394
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,094
OF CUBA.                        
JOSH, GREAT TO SEE YOU.         

395
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,864
YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONS       
BETWEEN CUBA AND THE UNITED     

396
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:41,171
STATES AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE    
PAPER THIN AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT

397
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,273
TO HELP.                        
>> THEY WERE DELL CUT TO BEGIN  

398
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,241
WITH FOR SURE.                  
THIS WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR    

399
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:49,346
THAT WARMING OF RELATIONS THAT  
TOOK FORM IN 2015 TO CONTINUE.  

400
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,649
CUBA SPENT THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS
PLEADING WITH THE UNITED STATES 

401
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:57,021
NOT TO DO WHAT IT DID TODAY.    
SAYING DON'T BE HASTY.          

402
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,255
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE THIS WAS   
UNITED STATES.                  

403
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,325
THE U.S. DECIDED TODAY THAT YES,
THAT'S TRUE.                    

404
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,929
THE U.S. ISN'T POINTING THE     
FINGER AT CUBA BUT CUBA HAS BEEN

405
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:09,466
UNABLE TO ASSURE THE U.S.       
GOVERNMENT THAT DIPLOMATS ARE   

406
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:15,239
SAFE ON CUBAN SOIL AND THE U.S. 
HAS TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS 

407
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,441
TO PROTECT NOT ONLY AMERICAN    
DIPLOMATS BUT TOURISTS THAT     

408
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,578
COULD BE HARMED BY THIS.        
>> SURE.                        

409
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:25,049
THEY'RE EXTRAPOLATING SAYING    
IT'S NOT JUST THE U.S. ENVOYS.  

410
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:30,387
IF YOU TRAVEL TO CUBA AND YOU'RE
IN HAVANA, THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU  

411
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,923
HAVE THE SAME RISK.             
AND THE QUESTION BECOMES IF YOU 

412
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:39,463
LOOK AT CUBA'S RESPONSE AND I   
KNOW THEY'RE DENYING THIS, JOSH,

413
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:46,804
BUT THERE'S NOT THIS ALL HANDS  
ON DECK MENTALITY TO GET TO THE 

414
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,105
BOTTOM OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THESE ATTACKS.                  

415
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:56,780
>> WELL, THE U.S. HAS ACTUALLY  
PRAISED CUBA'S WELLINGNESS TO   

416
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:59,283
INVESTIGATE THIS.               
MANY OFFICIALS FLIED DOWN TO    

417
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:03,420
HAVANA TO DO SOME SEARCHES WHAT 
THE CUBANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

418
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,591
DO IS GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS 
AND SAY IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  

419
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,928
IT'S CONSIDERED THE             
RESPONSIBILITY OF A HOST COUNTRY

420
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:18,369
TO PROTECT DIPLOMATS, MAKE IT A 
HOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENT AND IN   

421
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,903
THE ABSENCE OF CUBA BEING ABLE  
TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE   

422
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,372
EXPERIENCING THESE THINGS       
HAPPENING TO AMERICAN DIPLOMATS 

423
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:27,478
IN THE FUTURE, THE U.S. HAS SAID
THIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT.         

424
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:29,680
>> Trace: YEAH, PROTECT         
DIPLOMATS AND TOURISTS.         

425
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:36,987
LOOK AT THE ANALOGY OF MEXICO.  
MANY SAY THERE'S CORRUPTION DOWN

426
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,357
THERE.                          
BUT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS IN A 

427
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,028
TOURIST PART OF THE COUNTRY,    
THEY'RE ALL OVER IT.            

428
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:52,703
IF WORD GETS OUT THAT MEXICO IS 
NOT SAFE, THE TOURISM INDUSTRY  

429
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,339
GOES CAPUT.                     
AND NOW THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

430
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:59,943
MAYBE IT'S NOT SAFE IN CUBA AND 
CUBA CAN'T -- ALL THEY'RE       

431
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,546
TRYING, THEY CAN'T GET A HANDLE 
ON WHO IS BEHIND THIS.          

432
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,383
>> CERTAINLY POTENTIAL EFFECTS  
ON THE TOURISM INDUSTRY IN      

433
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:10,888
HAVANA, WHICH IS A LIFE LINE FOR
THE CUBAN ECONOMY COULD BE      

434
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,590
IMMENSE.                        
I WOULDN'T RUSH TO SAY THAT CUBA

435
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,427
ISN'T DOING THINGS THAT THEY    
SHOULD BE DOING TO INVESTIGATE  

436
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,763
THIS.                           
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, THE    

437
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:26,070
BEST U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT       
INTELLIGENCE, THE TOP PEOPLE    

438
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,538
THAT INVESTIGATE THESE CRIMES   
FOR THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT  

439
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,672
BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S  
GOING ON.                       

440
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:32,009
SO IF THE U.S. CAN'T FIGURE IT  
OUT, IT MAKES SENSE THAT THIS IS

441
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,045
SO PERPLEXING THAT IT'S BEEN    
DIFFICULT FOR THE CUBANS TO GET 

442
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,215
A HANDLE ON AS WELL.            
>> Trace: THAT'S A FAIR         

443
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,917
ASSESSMENT, JOSH.               
GOOD TO SEE YOU.                

444
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,252
THANK YOU.                      
>> THANKS A LOT.                

445
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,522
>> Trace: WELL, NO MATTER HOW   
BAD THE ECONOMY TANKED IN PUERTO

446
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:49,460
RICO, THE ISLAND'S AGRICULTURE  
INDUSTRY HAD BEEN A BRIGHT SPOT 

447
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:51,829
UNTIL NOW.                      
HURRICANE MARIA STRIPPING       

448
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:58,635

LEADING FARMERS AND THEIR       

449
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,703
FAMILIES FACING A VERY UNCERTAIN
FUTURE.                         

450
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,839
