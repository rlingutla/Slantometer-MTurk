1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,936
TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR
AND OUR RECOVERY.               

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,208
LIKE I SAID EARLIER, WE'RE      
ADDING ADDITIONAL CONVOYS TO DO 

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,777
DISTRIBUTION INTO THE MORE      
REMOTE AREAS OF THE ISLAND.     

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:17,783
WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WILL     
STAY.                           

5
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:23,355
>> IS THERE MARTIAL LAW IN      
PUERTO RICO?                    

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,723
>> NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.         
WE HAVE HEARD NOTHING FROM THE  

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:30,396
GOVERNOR TO DECLARE MT'S ABOUT  
ALLOCATING THE RESOURCES THAT   

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,664
YOU HAVE CURRENTLY ON THE       
ISLAND.                         

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,334
SO FOR SECURITY PURPOSES, THE   
NATIONAL GUARD THAT HAS ALREADY 

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,637
BEEN THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME 
AND ACTIVATED, PROVIDING        

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:43,442
SECURITY FORCES WHAT WE'RE      
BRINGING IN IS JUST GOING TO    

12
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,412
BOLSTER EVERYTHING ON TOP OF    
THAT.                           

13
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:54,486
>> IT'S BEING COMPARED TO       
HURRICANE KATRINA-LIKE          

14
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,454
DEVASTATION.                    
IS IT THAT BAD?                 

15
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,789
WHAT YOUR ASSESSMENT?           
>> EVERY HURRICANE IS UNIQUE.   

16
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,425
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE  
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND IN PUERTO    

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,796
RICO IS THE TOTAL -- BECAUSE    
THEY'RE SMALLER ISLANDS, THE    

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,998
TOTAL DEVASTATION.              
IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AND IN    

19
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,468
PUERTO RICO, WE HAD ZERO POWER. 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME  

20
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:14,306
TO RESTORE THE POWER GRID.      
WE DON'T HAVE THE ADJACENT AREAS

21
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,942
FROM WHICH TO DEPLOY LIKE WE DID
IN KATRINA.                     

22
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:21,213
I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING THAT IS 
WORKING, THE FORWARD-LEANING OF 

23
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,017
THE PRESIDENT AND DECLARING A   
DISASTER DECLARATION VERY EARLY 

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,954
AND THE GOVERNOR AND ASKING FOR 
HELP AND FEMA BEING ON THE      

25
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,157
GROUND.                         
I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFERENT     

26
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,260
RESPONSE.                       
>> DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PLAN 

27
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:39,064
TO ASK CONGRESS FOR ANOTHER     
SUPPLEMENTAL KICKING IN?        

28
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,702
>> WE DON'T HAVE A DOLLAR       
FIGURE.                         

29
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,940
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE NEEDS.   
WE BELIEVE WE WILL NEED         

30
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,210
ADDITIONAL BEYOND THE OCTOBER 1 
INCREMENTS.                     

31
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:59,751
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE 
TAKEN ACTION TO THIS POINT.     

32
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,019
YOU KNOW, PUERTO RICO HAS POWER 
ON THE ISLAND.                  

33
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,522
I SPOKE TO THE DIMINISHED       
CAPACITY TO GET THAT BACK.      

34
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,726
WHEN I SAY "DIMINISHED          
CAPACITY", THE POWER WORKERS,   

35
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,496
THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE        
DISASTER SURVIVORS.             

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,434
THEY MAY HAVE LOST EVERYTHING.  
WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE ASKED 

37
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,771
THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO  
BASICALLY TAKE OVERSIGHT AND    

38
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,674
MANAGEMENT OF NOT ONLY THE      
EMERGENCY POWER RESTORATION AND 

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,079
THE INITIAL PART OF REBUILDING  
THE ENTIRE GRID.                

40
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:32,885
THE ENTIRE REBUILD OF THE GRID, 
THAT'S A LONG PROCESS.          

41
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,052
IF WE DO IT, WE GOT TO DO IT    
RIGHT.                          

42
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:38,957
WE DON'T WANT TO WIND UP HAVING 
THIS SAME DISCUSSION TEN, 20, 30

43
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,161
YEARS FROM NOW.                 
>> SO THE ARMY CORPS OF         

44
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,129
ENGINEERS --                    
>> THEY'RE ON THE ISLAND, YES.  

45
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:49,668
>> ARE THERE ANY LESSONS THAT   
WE'VE LEARNED BY THESE BIG      

46
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:55,274
STORMS THAT WE'RE GETTING BETTER
AT ADDRESSING?                  

47
00:02:55,408 --> 00:03:04,716
SECOND QUESTION VERY QUICKLY IS 
THERE ANY FEAR BESIDES CLIMATE  

48
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,918
CHANGE --                       
>> WE'RE FOCUSED ON RESPONSE AND

49
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,086
COVERRY.                        
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AT DHS  

50
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,089
AND FEMA.                       
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS NOT     

51
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,527
LOSING ANY TIME.                
ON HARVEY AND THIS HURRICANE,   

52
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,731
MARIA, THE PRESIDENT DECLARED   
THE DISASTER BEFORE THE EYE HIT 

53
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,668
LANDFALL THAT IS ABSOLUTELY     
CRITICAL TO ALLOWING US TO COME 

54
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,471
IN AND SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR  
BEFORE THE DISASTER REALLY HITS.

55
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,975
TO ME THAT HAS BEEN A           
GAME-CHANGER.                   

56
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,712
>> I THINK THE LAST 35 DAYS HAVE
BEEN A GUT CHECK FOR AMERICANS  

57
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:39,218
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A TRUE       
CULTURE OF PREPAREDNESS IN THIS 

58
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,118
COUNTRY.                        
WE HAVE WORK TO DO.             

59
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,920
WHETHER IT'S IN EDUCATION, BEING
READY.                          

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:49,394
IT'S NOT JUST SAYING, HEY, HAVE 
THREE DAYS OF SUPPLIES READY TO 

61
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,664
GO.                             
IT'S GREATER THAN THAT IT'S THE 

62
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,800
FINANCES AND ABILITY TO OVERCOME
EMERGENCIES.                    

63
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:59,271
WE HAVE TO HIT THE RESET BUTTON 
STARTING AT A YOUNG AGE AND     

64
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:12,684
FILTERING UP.                   
>> ONE LAST QUESTION.           

65
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:18,156
>> [QUESTION INAUDIBLE]         
>> PUERTO RICO WAS HURT BEFORE  

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,395
THE DISASTER HIT.               
THE PRESIDENT HAS PROVIDED FOR  

67
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:29,568
100% REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL THE   
MAJOR RESPONSE EFFORTS BY THE   

68
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:32,871
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST
180 DAYS THAT WILL GET US TO A  

69
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,808
POINT THAT WE CAN REASSESS.     
THANK YOU ALL.                  

70
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,312
>> THANK YOU, FOLKS.            
>> Shepard: SO PUERTO RICO NEEDS

71
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:49,621
A LOT OF HELP AND A LOT OF TIME 
AHEAD.                          

72
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,557
GERALDO IS LIVE AT THE AIRPORT. 
I'VE BEEN READING ABOUT THIS.   

73
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:59,598
I'M HEARING IT'S A MESS THERE.  
>> IT IS A MESS.                

74
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,267
JAMMED.                         
MAIN TERMINAL IS JAMMED, SHEP,  

75
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,270
WITH PEOPLE DESPERATE TO GET OUT
OF PUERTO RICO.                 

76
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,573
AT THE URGING OF THE GOVERNOR,  
HE SAYS ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T    

77
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:15,914
HAVE TO BE HERE SHOULD LEAVE.   
THE PROBLEM IS THERE'S BEEN SO  

78
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,182
FEW FLIGHTS OUT.                
UNITED AIRLINES STEPPED UP TO   

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,653
THE PLATE AMID STORIES OF PRICE 
GOUGING AND FLIGHTS CANCELLED   

80
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:27,659
FOR A WEEK OR TWO EVEN, UNITED  
HAS PUT ON A 777 FLIGHT THAT WAS

81
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,595
LEAVING FOR CHICAGO.            
I'VE BEEN ON AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER

82
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,433
THE LAST COUPLE HOURS.          
I DON'T KNOW IF THE 777 TOOK    

83
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,702
OFF.                            
UNITED OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE TO

84
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,939
GET PEOPLE OUT OF HERE.         
THE GOVERNOR WANTS PEOPLE       

85
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:48,480
BRINGING SUPPLIES, DESPERATELY  
NEEDED.                         

86
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,550
TO ME, IT'S ALMOST MIND BOGGLING
HOW SLOW THE RELIEF EFFORT HAS  

87
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,018
BEEN.                           
THERE'S BEEN ONE RELIEF FLIGHT  

88
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,987
ALL DAY YESTERDAY.              
THEY WERE TRYING TO SWAP OUT THE

89
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,592
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS HERE AT 
THE SAN JUAN AIRPORT.           

90
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:05,597
JUST DOESN'T SEEM THAT THE PEDAL
HAS BEEN PUT TO THE METAL IF YOU

91
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:12,204
GET MY MEANING.                 
THIS IS A CATASTROPHE WITH FOOD 

92
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:21,546
SUPPLIES ARE SHORT, BUT WITH NO 
WATER AND NO POWER, EVERYONE IS 

93
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,781
USING GENERATORS.               
THE GENERATORS NEED FUEL.       

94
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:28,553
SO YOU HAVE THE SIX TO EIGHT    
HOUR LINES AT THE AIRPORT, SHEP.

95
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:34,025
IT'S MELANCHOLY AND DEPRESSING. 
YOU WANT THIS RELIEF MACHINE TO 

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,797
GET UP AND GOING.               
THE KIDS IN THE WHITE HERE ARE  

97
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:44,770
FROM THE MORE MORMON CHURCH.    
THESE ARE NEW YORK FIREFIGHTERS.

98
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,839
THEY JUST GOT HERE.             
WHAT IS NEEDED, IT'S LIKE THE   

99
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:53,678
OLD SONG, YOU NEED LINEMEN FROM 
THE COUNTY.                     

100
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,046
GLEN CAMPBELL SONG.             
YOU NEED TELEPHONE POLES, WE    

101
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,315
NEED PEOPLE THAT KNOW HOW TO PUT
THE GRID BACK IN ACTION.        

102
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,521
WE NEED PEOPLE THAT CAN --      
IMAGINE IF YOU LEFT IN A        

103
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,092
12-STORY CONDO AND YOU HAVE NO  
WATER AND ELECTRICITY.          

104
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:11,596
EVERY TIME YOU FLUSH THE TOILET,
YOU NEED A GALLON OF WATER.     

105
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,598
WHERE THE HELL YOU GOING TO GET 
IT?                             

106
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,868
THE SITUATION IS GETTING MORE   
AND MORE DIRE.                  

107
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:25,777
I JUST APPRECIATE WHAT I HEARD  
ABOUT THE COMMONWEALTH GETTING  

108
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,112
TOGETHER TO MOUNT A REAL        
EFFECTIVE RELIEF EFFORT.        

109
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,681
BUT BECAUSE THIS DOESN'T HAVE   
THE DRAMA OF THE WINDS BLOWING  

110
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:34,586
AND THE FLOODS CREEPING UP, YOU 
KNOW -- MY FEAR IS THE PEOPLE   

111
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:42,227
DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS IS A SLOWLY
UNFOLDING HUMAN CATASTROPHE, A  

112
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,229
DISASTER FROM ONE END TO THE    
OTHER.                          

113
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,530
BACK TO YOU.                    
>> Shepard: A LOT OF CONCERNS   

114
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,366
ABOUT THE VERY OLD AND THE VERY 
YOUNG.                          

115
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,736
HOW THEY WILL REFRIGERATE FOOD  
AND MEDICINE AND HOW THEY CAN   

116
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:57,909
SURVIVE.                        
DO WE NEED TO BE THINKING OF A

00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,180
BIGGER PLAN?                    
>> WHAT I WOULD DO, SHEP -- YOU 

118
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,117
HURT ME WITH THAT QUESTION.     
WHAT I WOULD DO, YOU NEED SHIPS 

119
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,522
FULL OF GENERATORS.             
YOU NEED -- PEOPLE WANT TO SEND 

120
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,656
ICE.                            
THE ICE WILL MELT.              

121
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,326
THE FOOD WILL SPOIL.            
THE OLD-TIMERS WITH THEIR       

122
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,431
MEDICINE, THEY NEED IT THREE    
TIMES A DAY, NEED IT            

123
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,366
REFRIGERATED.                   
WE JUST LEFT THE AIRCRAFT       

124
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,603
CARRIER, THE HELICOPTER CARRIER 
RUN BY THE NAVY.                

125
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:31,309
MARINES ARE NOW ASHORE.         
THEY'RE VISITING HOSPITALS AND  

126
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,644
BRINGING GENERATORS TO THEM.    
THAT'S THE KIND OF              

127
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,046
PRACTICINGMATIC AID THAT THEY   
NEED HERE.                      

128
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:41,520
THEY DON'T NEED GOOD WISHES.    
EVEN MONEY DOESN'T IT.          

129
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,022
WE NEED TO GET THE ISLAND BACK  
ON THE GRID.                    

130
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,925
IT'S IN THE DARK AGES NOW, SHEP.
>> Shepard: FOR THE GENERATORS  

131
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,027
YOU NEED FUEL IS.               
THERE ENOUGH OF THAT?           

132
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:55,367
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY OF       
MOUNTING A HUGE GENERATOR RELIEF

133
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,270
SHIP AS YOU MENTIONED?          
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW, BY THE WAY 

134
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:15,520
THE                             

135
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,992
    TIME I GOT ON THE AIRCRAFT  
CARRIER BEFORE I LOST COMS WITH 

136
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,360
THE MAIN AIRPORT, THE BIG HARBOR
HERE AT NIGHT IS NOT            

137
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,295
OPERATIONAL.                    
YOU NEED BULK HERE.             

138
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,663
THERE'S 3.4 MILLION PEOPLE.     
IT'S ONE THING IF A DISASTER    

139
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,730
STRIKES.                        
3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MANY ELDERLY

140
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,765
BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS 
HERE.                           

141
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,536
MANY OF THE ABLE-BODIED, THE    
STRONG MIDDLE CLASS HAVE GONE TO

142
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:37,108
FLORIDA ALREADY OR NEW YORK.    
THEY SAW IRMA COMING.           

143
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,112
THEY SAW JOSE AND NOW MARIA.    
WHAT IS LEFT IS THE OLD FOLKS.  

144
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:46,518
I'M GETTING ALL OF THESE TEXTS. 
I CAN READ YOU TEXTS I'M GETTING

145
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:51,756
FROM FAMILY IN THE BRONX.       
SOME OF MY RELATIVES, OTHERS IN 

146
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:56,761
THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY
THEY HAVE NOT HEARD FROM YET.   

147
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,699
I THINK THEY'RE OKAY.           
BUT THEY ARE OUT OF TOUCH.      

148
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,934
THE CELL SERVICE -- THERE'S NO  
CELL SERVICE HERE.              

149
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:09,007
IT'S VERY, VERY SPOTTY.         
VERY FRUSTRATING.               

150
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,276
THERE'S NO COORDINATION.        
WHEN I GO ON THE ROADS THIS LONG

151
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,814
AFTER THE HURRICANES AND STILL  
SEE TELEPHONE POLES SITTING     

152
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,784
ACROSS THE HIGHWAY OR BIG ROAD  
SIGNS CRUSHED INTO THE MIDDLE   

153
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:27,726
LANE OF A THREE-LANE HIGHWAY, MY
POINT HERE, SHEP, IS THAT THIS  

154
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,599
IS AN EXTREMELY DIRE SITUATION  
THAT UNLESS IT'S GOING TO BECOME

155
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:41,640
THE KIND OF SCREWED UP RESPONSE 
THAT KATRINA WAS, WE HAVE TO SEE

156
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,141
PRACTICAL RESULTS AND THE       
PRACTICAL RESULTS ARE PUT SOME  

157
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,678
PEOPLE BACK ONLINE.             
GET SOME TEMPORARY CELL TOWERS  

158
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:51,416
UP.                             
RATHER THAN THE BIG C-5s AND THE

159
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,589
C-130s AND THE C-17 SITTING ON  
THE TARMAC, WHY AREN'T THE SKIES

160
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:03,261
FILLED WITH COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS
BRINGING STUFF, SUPPLIES IN?    

161
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,764
THIS HAS BEEN -- I'M NOT        
CRITICIZING ANYBODY.            

162
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:13,438
DON'T GET ME WRONG HERE.        
BUT THIS -- THAT'S WHY I WANT   

163
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,274
USE THE TERM BUNGLED RESPONSE   
BUT IT'S BEEN AN UNEVEN         

164
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,344
RESPONSE, SHEP.                 
>> Shepard: GERALDO WITH THE    

165
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,846
FACTS ON THE GROUND.            
THEY NEED GENERATORS.           

166
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:29,320
GET THEM GENERATORS.            
THE DEATH OF AN AMERICAN STUDENT

167
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,790
IN NORTH KOREA IS MORE SERIOUS  
THAN WE NEW.                    

168
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:36,094
THE PARENTS OF OTTO WARMBIER    
TALK ABOUT THE FIRST TIME THEY  

169
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:46,971
SAW THEIR SON AND THEIR         
REALIZIZATION THAT HE WOULD     

170
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:47,439
NEVER BE THE SAME.              

171
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,095
             (AVO)              
 When you have type 2 diabetes, 
      you manage your A1C,      

172
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,764
but you also have a higher risk 
   of heart attack or stroke.   

173
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,067
      Non-insulin Victoza®      
          lowers A1C,           

174
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,837
        and now reduces         
      cardiovascular risk.      

175
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,773
Victoza® lowers my              
A1C and blood sugar             

176
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,508
better than                     
the leading                     
branded pill.                   

177
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,643
             (AVO)              
      And for people with       
        type 2 diabetes         

178
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,114
treating cardiovascular disease,
    Victoza® is NOW approved    

179
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,783
   to lower the risk of major   
     cardiovascular events      

180
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,718
such as heart attack,           
stroke, or death.               

181
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,954
       And while it isn't       
        for weight loss,        

182
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,256
          Victoza® may          
   help you lose some weight.   

183
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,059
             (AVO)              
Victoza® is not for people with 
        type 1 diabetes         

184
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,794
   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

185
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,697
Do not take Victoza® if you have
  a personal or family history  

186
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,465
  of medullary thyroid cancer,  

187
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,135
       Multiple Endocrine       
   Neoplasia syndrome type 2,   

188
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,803
     or if you are allergic     
          to Victoza®           

189
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,471
   or any of its ingredients.   

190
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,974
  Stop taking Victoza® and get  
    medical help right away     

191
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,444
if you get symptoms of a serious
allergic reaction such as rash, 

192
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,746
 swelling, difficulty breathing 
         or swallowing.         

193
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,415
Serious side effects may happen,
    including pancreatitis.     

194
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,985
    So, stop taking Victoza®    
and call your doctor right away 

195
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,420
    if you have severe pain     
     in your stomach area.      

196
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,422
        Tell your doctor        
     your medical history.      

197
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,424
   Gallbladder problems have    
    happened in some people.    

198
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,760
  Tell your doctor right away   
      if you get symptoms.      

199
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,029
      Taking Victoza® with      
   a sulfonylurea or insulin    

200
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,764
   may cause low blood sugar.   

201
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,400
Common side effects are nausea, 
      diarrhea, vomiting,       

202
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,103
      decreased appetite,       
 indigestion, and constipation. 

203
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,005
          Side effects          
    can lead to dehydration,    

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,506
which may cause kidney problems.

205
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,875
Ask your doctor                 
about Victoza®.                 

206
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,750

HE WAS BLIND AND DEAF, HOWLING  

207
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:50,855
AND JERKING VIOLENTLY.          
THE FATHER OF OTTO WARMBIER SAID

208
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,560
THAT WAS THE CONDITION OF HIS   
SON WHEN HE ARRIVED IN THE      

209
00:14:55,694 --> 00:15:02,667
UNITED STATES AFTER MORE THAN A 
YEAR IN CAPTIVITY IN NORTH

KOREA.                          
OTTO WARMBIER WAS ARRESTED FOR  

211
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,673
ALLEGEDLY STEALING A PROPAGANDA 
POSTER FROM A HOTEL.            

212
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:15,780
THEY LATER SENTENCED HIM TO 15  
YEARS OF HARD LABOR FOR THAT.   

213
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:22,020
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL SAYS HE   
SLIPPED INTO A COMA AFTER TAKING

214
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,689
A SLIPPING PILL AND GOT         
BOTULISM.                       

215
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:29,327
HIS PARENTS SAY THEY TORTURED   
HIM.

THEY SAID THEY HAD THREE MONTHS 
TO COME TOGETHER AND DO SOME

HEALING.                        
THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THEY WERE NOT 

219

WITH THE MEDICAL TEAM AS THE    
PLANE ARRIVED.                  

224
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,326
IT WAS DETERMINED THE MEDICAL   
TEAM WOULD GO ON THE PLANE      

225
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,632
BEFORE OUR FAMILY.              
THEY WENT ON THE PLANE, FIVE    

226
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,167
MINUTES OR SO LATER, THEY CAME  
DOWN AND SAID IT WAS TIME FOR   

227
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:14,839
OUR FAMILY TO GO TO THE PLANE.  
IT WAS MYSELF, CINDY, AUSTIN AND

00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,342
GRETA.

THEY JUST LANDED.

STEPS, WE HEARD THIS HOWLING    
INVOLUNTARILY, UNHUMAN SOUND.   

232
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:39,731
WE WEREN'T CERTAIN WHAT IT WAS. 
WE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE    

233
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,233
STEPS AND WE LOOKED IN AND OTTO 
WAS ON THE STRETCHER ACROSS IN  

234
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,738
THE PLANE.                      
HE WAS JERKING VIOLENTLY MAKING 

235
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:52,443
THESE INHUMAN SOUNDS.           
CINDY AND GRETA RAN OFF THE     

236
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,446
PLANE.                          
AUSTIN AND I WALKED OVER TO     

237
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,548
OTTO.                           
OTTO HAD A SHAVED HEAD.         

238
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,853
HE HAD A FEEDING TUBE COMING OUT
OF HIS NOSE.                    

239
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:06,157
HE WAS STARING BLANKLY INTO     
SPACE JERKING VIOLENTLY.        

240
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,458
HE WAS BLIND.                   
HE WAS DEAF.                    

241
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:12,697
WE LOOKED AT HIM AND TRIED TO   
COMFORT HIM.                    

242
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:17,902
LOOKED LIKE SCENE HAD TAKEN A   
PAIR OF PLIERS AND REARRANGED   

243
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,906
HIS BOTTOM TEETH.               
WITHIN TWO DAY OF BEING HOME,   

244
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:28,713
HIS FEVER SPIKED TO 104 DEGREES.
HE HAD A LARGE SCAR ON HIS RIGHT

245
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,250
FOOT.                           
NORTH KOREA IS NOT A VICTIM.    

246
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,419
THEY'RE TERRORISTS.             
>> THEY DESTROYED HIM.          

247
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:44,395
>> THEY PURPOSELY AND           
INTENTIONALLY INJURED OTTO.     

248
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,930
>> NORTH KOREA HAS DENIED CLAIMS
THAT OTTO WARMBIER WAS TORTURED 

249
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,865
OR TREATED CRUELLY SAYING HE WAS
DEALT WITH ACCORDING TO DOMESTIC

250
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,269
LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL          
STANDARDS.                      

251
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,205
U.S. INTELLIGENCE REPORTS SAY   
WARMBIER WAS BADLY BEATEN IN    

252
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,074
CUSTODY, SHEP.                  
>> Shepard: IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE

253
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,378
EARLY GOING, TRACE, HEAR IT FROM
THE FAMILY, THEY THOUGHT HE     

254
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,715
WOULD FULLY RECOVER BEFORE      
THEY -- REALITY SET IN.         

255
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,118
>> THEY DID.                    
WHEN THE WARMBIERS WERE WAITING 

256
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,388
ON THEIR SON'S PLANE TO ARRIVE  
BACK IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY 

257
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,525
THOUGHT HI WOULD BE IN A        
MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA AND WITH 

258
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,764
THE BEST DOCTORS AND A LOT OF   
LOVE, THAT HE WOULD COME OUT OF 

259
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,666
IT.                             
HERE'S CINDY WARMBIER TALKING   

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:28,039
ABOUT HOW SHE AND HER DAUGHTER  
REACTED TO THE FIRST SCENE OF   

261
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,508
OTTO AND HIS CONDITION.         
>> WHEN GRETA RAN OFF THE PLANE 

262
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:35,813
AND I WAS SO WORRIED BECAUSE SHE
WAS SCREAMING.                  

263
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:42,887
OUR IMAGE OF OTTO AS YOU KNOW IS
OF SOMEONE JUST WONDERFUL.      

264
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:50,428
BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT TO SEE 
HOW HE CAME HOME WAS TOO MUCH   

265
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:54,265
FOR US.                         
I ALMOST -- I GOT IT TOGETHER.  

266
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,933
I RODE IN THE AMBULANCE WITH    
HIM.                            

267
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,202
I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO BE ALONE   
ANYMORE.                        

268
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,872
HE HAD BEEN ALONE FOR WAY TOO   
LONG.                           

269
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:05,877
WE STAYED WITH HIM.             
LOVED HIM AS BEST WE COULD.     

270
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,646
NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE GONE      
THROUGH WHAT WE WENT THROUGH.   

271
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,986
THE FACT THAT OTTO WAS ALONE ALL
THAT TIME WITH NO ONE TO COMFORT

272
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,827
HIM IS UNEXCUSABLE.             
WHATEVER HAPPENED, I MEAN, WHY  

273
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,797
WOULD YOU DO THIS?              
>> OTTO WARMBIER TIED LESS THAN 

274
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,833
A WEEK AFTER RETURNING TO THE   
UNITED STATES.                  

275
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:33,804
DOCTORS SAID HE WAS IN THE STATE
OF UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS AND 

276
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,741
SUFFERED A NEUROLOGICAL INJURY  
THAT LIKELY OCCURRED SHORTLY    

277
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,777
AFTER HE WAS SENTENCED TO 15    
MONTHS.                         

278
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,878
SHEP?                           
>> Shepard: TRACE GALLAGHER LIVE

279
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,446
FOR US.                         
THANK YOU, TRACE.               

280
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:46,751
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FORMER ADVISER
ROGER STONE SPEAKING TO         

281
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,287
REPORTERS AFTER HE TESTIFIED    
ABOUT RUSSIAN MEDDLING IN THE   

282
00:19:49,421 --> 00:23:07,683
ELECTION.                       
HE SAID HE TOLD LAWMA           

283
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:11,154
>> FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN 
ADVISER ROGER STONE SAYS THERE'S

284
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:16,826
NOT ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE.      
AND THAT'S A QUOTE.             

285
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,265
ROGER STONE APPEARED IN FRONT OF
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE            

286
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:26,602
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TODAY.   
THE PANEL IS INVESTIGATING      

287
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:36,813
MOSCOW'S MEDDLING IN THE 2016   
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.          

288
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:37,914
LET'S BRING IN JUDGE ANDREW     
NAPOLITANO.                     

289
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,182
ROGER STONE.                    
>> ROGER STONE'S COMPLAINT IS   

290
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:42,251
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM
WERE PUBLIC, BUT HIS ANSWERS ARE

291
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:45,855
NOT BECAUSE HE BEGGED THE       
COMMITTEE TO INTERROGATE HIM IN 

292
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,191
PUBLIC RATHER THAN BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS.                          

293
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:51,494
THE POLICY OF THE COMMITTEE IS  
TO INTERROGATE BEHIND CLOSED    

294
00:23:51,628 --> 00:23:54,797
DOORS AND DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO
DO IT IN PUBLIC.                

295
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:59,669
SO WE KNOW OF HIS CERTAIN AND   
LOUD AND ARTICULATE AND FORCEFUL

296
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,939
DENIALS IN HIS OPENING STATEMENT
BECAUSE HE RELEASED THAT.       

297
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:09,946
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS    
THEY ASKED HIM.                 

298
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,514
>> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS OUT OF
TENNESSEE, THIS IS FROM POLITCO.

299
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:16,052
THIS IS FROM NASHVILLE.         
BOB CORKER WILL NOT RUN FOR     

300
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,987
RE-ELECTION.                    
HE'S JUST MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 

301
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:25,595
SAYING WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE
IN 2006, I COULDN'T IMAGINE TO  

302
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:28,798
SERVE MORE THAN TWO TERMS.      
HE'S NOT RUNNING AGAIN.         

303
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:32,535
ONE OTHER MATTER IS THIS MATTER 
OF E-MAILS.                     

304
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:35,705
THERE'S MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP    
TRANSITION TEAM WHEN THEY GOT --

305
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:42,378
THE ELECTION HAPPENED AND THE   
SWEARING IN HAPPENED AND THE    

306
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:43,980
INAUGURATION HAPPENED, THEY     
CONTINUED TO USE PRIVATE E-MAIL 

307
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,682
FOR CORRESPONDENCE.             
NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S        

308
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,619
ANYTHING CLASSIFIED ON THAT BUT 
BRINGS UP THE OLD HILLARY       

309
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:52,555
CLINTON THINGS --               
>> MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE     

310
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:57,660
WHITE HOUSE WASN'T CONCERNED    
ABOUT THIS WITH ALL OF THE      

311
00:24:57,794 --> 00:24:59,595
PROBLEMS THIS PRODUCED DURING   
THE CAMPAIGN.                   

312
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,567
SO IF THERE WAS CLASSIFIED      
MATERIALS ON IT, IT'S A SERIOUS 

313
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,602
ISSUE.                          
WE HAVE OF NONE.                

314
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:09,272
>> Shepard: NONE AT ALL.        
>> WHEN YOU WORK FOR THE        

315
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:15,444
GOVERNMENT, THE GOVERNMENT OWNS 
YOUR E-MAILS EVEN ON THOSE ON   

316
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:16,879
YOUR PERSONAL ACCOUNT.          
SO TECHNICALLY THAT'S KEEPING   

317
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:19,782
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.            
IF YOU SURRENDER IT OVER, IT'S  

318
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:23,619
OVER WITH.                      
IT'S A BIT OF A BLACK EYE FOR AN

319
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,788
ADMINISTRATION THAT MADE A BIG  
DEAL ABOUT IT.                  

320
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,323
>> Shepard: LOCK HER UP.        
>> YES.                         

321
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:32,128
>> Shepard: THAT'S DIFFERENT.   
SHE HAD A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.

322
00:25:32,262 --> 00:25:35,898
THERE'S MORE TO IT FROM MY      
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT IT, ONCE YOU

323
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:39,969
GET INTO OFFICE OR YOU SERVE IN 
THE GIFT AND YOU GET SOMETHING  

324
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:46,108
ON YOUR G MAIL, YOU TAKE THAT G 
MAIL AND FORWARD IT TO YOUR     

325
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:48,411
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT.             
COULD BE OVERSIGHT.             

326
00:25:48,545 --> 00:25:50,846
WHO KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT WORTH   
BRINGING UP.                    

327
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,015
>> SEEMS TO BE CAUGHT BEFORE ANY
DAMAGE WAS DONE.                

328
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,588
ONE CANNOT OVERLOOK THE IRONY.  
>> FOR THIS BOB CORKER SEAT IN  

329
00:25:58,722 --> 00:26:05,761
TENNESSEE, AN IMPORTANT MEMBER  
DOWN THERE, RAN AGAINST HAROLD  

330
00:26:05,896 --> 00:26:13,502
FORD JR. FROM 2006.             
>> HE WAS THE HARSHEST          

331
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:19,842
REPUBLICAN CRITIC OF THE        
PRESIDENT WHEN HE CALLED HIM UP 

332
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:20,943
STABLE.                         
>> HE'S NOT RUNNING AGAIN.      

333
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,411
THAT WILL LEAVE AN OPENING THERE
IN THE STATE OF TENNESSEE FOR   

334
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,580
MANY MILLIONS BATTLE.           
>> I THINK HAROLD FORD WILL BE  

335
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:26,315
MOVING BACK TO TENNESSEE        
QUICKLY.                        

336
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,217
>> YOU THINK SO?                
>> YES.                         

337
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:31,587
>> Shepard: HAROLD FORD.        
MIGHT GIVE HIM A CALL AND SEE   

338
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,590
WHAT HE'S DOING.                
POLITICS INTERESTING.           

339
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:37,293
THANKS, JUDGE.                  
>> ALWAYS A PLEASURE.           

340
00:26:37,427 --> 00:26:42,999
>> Shepard: THEY'LL SHUT THINGS 
DOWN ON WALL STREET.            

341
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:47,036
WE'RE A LITTLE DOWN NOW.        
JUST OFF A FEW POINTS.          

342
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,175
NEIL CAVUTO WITH THE BEST IN    
BUSINESS AS THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL

343
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,243
DAYTIME ROLLS ON IN JUST THREE  
MINUTES.                        

344
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,937
Hi. So I just got off the phone 

345
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:23,039
    with our Allstate agent,    

346
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,340
    and I know that we have     
    Accident Forgiveness.       

347
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,409
    So the incredibly minor     
 accident that I had tonight... 

348
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,576
   Four weeks                   
without the car.                

349
00:27:27,578 --> 00:27:28,811
     Okay, yep. Good night.
