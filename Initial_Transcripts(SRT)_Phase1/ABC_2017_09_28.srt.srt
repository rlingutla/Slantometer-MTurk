130
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,847
FOR GROCERY STORES AND BIG BOX  
STORES, NOT FEMA'S.             

131
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,184
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THE PLAN IS
STILL FOR THE PRESIDENT TO VISIT

132
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,188
ON TUESDAY, UNLESS THEY HEAR    
THAT A VISIT WOULD BE COUNTER   

133
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,322
PRODUCTIVE.                     
THEN, THE PLAN COULD CHANGE.    

134

CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL.    
>> Reporter: THE WHITE HOUSE    

141
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,048
TODAY CLAIMED PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
TAX PLAN COULD SAVE THE AVERAGE 

142
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,920
AMERICAN FAMILY UP TO $1,000 A  
YEAR.                           

143
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,823
>> IF WE ALLOW A FAMILY TO KEEP 
ANOTHER 1,000 DISEASE OF THEIR  

144
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,258
NEXT, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?      
THEY CAN RENOVATE THEIR KITCHEN,

145
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,195
THEY CAN BUY A NEW CAR, THEY CAN
TAKE A FAMILY VACATION.         

146
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,263
>> Reporter: BUT THE DETAILS ARE
STILL SKETCHY, AND THE          

147
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,000
PRESIDENT'S TOP ECONOMIC ADVISER
TODAY COULDN'T GUARANTEE THAT   

148
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,303
EVERY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY WOULD 
BENEFIT.                        

149
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,440
>> I GUARANTEE YOU -- I'LL      
GUARANTEE YOU, YOU CAN FIND     

150
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,810
SOMEONE IN THIS COUNTRY, MAYBE  
ONE PERSON WHO THEIR TAXES MAY  

151
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,912
NOT GO DOWN.                    
>> Reporter: ON "GMA," COHN SAID

152
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,047
THE PLAN WON'T SAVE THE         
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS ANYTHING AT

153
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,114
ALL.                            
>> THE WEALTHY ARE NOT GETTING A

154
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,016
TAX CUT UNDER OUR PLAN.         
>> Reporter: BUT THAT DOESN'T   

155
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:09,154
APPEAR TO BE TRUE.              
FOR ONE, THE PLAN ELIMINATES THE

156
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:13,225
ESTATE TAX.                     
SOMETHING THAT IS ONLY PAID ON  

157
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,028
ESTATES VALUED AT MORE THAN $5.5
MILLION FOR INDIVIDUALS, $1     

158
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,365
MILLION FOR COUPLES.            
THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT'S ABOUT   

159
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,434
HELPING FARMERS AND SMALL       
BUSINESS OWNERS.                

160
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,071
>> THE FARMERS, IN PARTICULAR,  
ARE AFFECTED.                   

161
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,139
THEY HAVE WONDERFUL FARMS, BUT  
THEY CAN'T PAY THE TAX, SO THEY 

162
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,842
HAVE TO SELL THE FARM.          
>> Reporter: BUT ACCORDING TO   

163
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,046
THE TAX POLICY CENTER, A GRAND  
TOTAL OF ABOUT 5,500 ESTATES    

164
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:40,619
WILL BE BIG ENOUGH TO OWE TAX   
THIS YEAR, AND OF THOSE, ONLY   

165
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,821
80 ARE SMALL FARMS OR           
CLOSELY-HELD BUSINESS.          

166
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,557
ONE FAMILY THAT WOULD CERTAINLY 
BENEFIT?                        

167
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,992
THE TRUMPS, EVEN THOUGH THE     
PRESIDENT INSISTS HIS PLAN WON'T

168
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,097
CUT HIS OWN TAXES.              
>> I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING AND

169
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:52,898
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ME.           
BELIEVE ME.                     

170
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,467
>> Reporter: BUT TODAY, COHN    
>> Reporter: DEMOCRATS RESPECT  

171
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,538
BUYING.                         
THEY SAY, POINT BLANK, WE'RE NOT

172
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,909
GOING TO DO A TAX PLAN THAT'S   
GOING TO BENEFIT THE WEALTHY.   

173
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,544
>> AGAIN, WHEN WE SEE MORE,     
YOU'LL KNOW MORE OF THE FACTS.  

174
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,145
>> JON KARL WITH US LIVE FROM

178
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,756
PRETTY HUGE TAX BREAK FOR       
CORPORATIONS.                   

179
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,324

HOUSE BELIEVES THAT CUTTING THE 

180
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,261
TAXES ON CORPORATIONS WILL BE A 
BIG BOOST TO THE ECONOMY.       

181
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,831
AS IT STANDS NOW, DAVID, THE    
UNITED STATES HAS ONE OF THE    

182
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,735
HIGHEST CORPORATE TAX RATES IN

315
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,433
Medicare only covers about 80%  
of your Part B medical expenses.

316
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,352
The rest is up to you.          

317
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,621
So think about an AARP Medicare 
Supplement Insurance Plan,      

318
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:33,240
insured by UnitedHealthcare     
Insurance Company.              

319
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,110
Like any standardized Medicare  
Supplement insurance plans,     

320
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:39,113
they help cover some of what    
Medicare doesn't pay.           

321
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,681
So don't wait.

331
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,720
   After a DVT blood clot...    

332
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,756
  I sure had a lot on my mind.  

333
00:17:04,808 --> 00:17:06,641
     My 30-year marriage...     

334
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:08,476
 ...my 3-month old business...  

335
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:10,762
      Plus...what if this       
        happened again?         

336
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,546
      I was given warfarin      
        in the hospital,        

337
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,066
     but wondered, was this     
   the best treatment for me?   

338
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,218
      So I made a point to      
       talk to my doctor.       

339
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,237
   He told me about ELIQUIS.    

340
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,355
       ELIQUIS treats DVT       
       and PE blood clots       

341
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,858
      and reduces the risk      
    of them happening again.    

342
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:27,228
  Not only does ELIQUIS treat   
    DVT and PE blood clots.     

343
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,248
               ELIQUIS also had 
              significantly less
                major bleeding  

344
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:31,449
               than the standard
                  treatment.    

345
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,334
                       ELIQUIS  
                     had both...

346
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,203
                  ...and that   
                turned around my

 <i> you may bruise more easily...</i> 

355
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,256
  <i> and it may take longer than</i>

      In clinical studies,      

415

    the majority of patients    
           on HUMIRA

428
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,794

431
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:49,934
 Don't start HUMIRA if you have 
         an infection.          

432
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,919
 If you're still just managing

434
