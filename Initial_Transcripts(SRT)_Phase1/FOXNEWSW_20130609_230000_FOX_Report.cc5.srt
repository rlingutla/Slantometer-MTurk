NOT FAR FROM THE NSA

195
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
HEADQUARTERS.

TRANSFERRING TO C.I.A..

203
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
THAT JOB GAVE HIM CLEARANCE

204
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
TO ACCESS A WIDE ARRAY OF

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000

JAPAN AND HAWAII.

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
BEFORE THIS NEWS BROKE,

211
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THIS WEEKEND WE HAD BEEN

212
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
TELLING YOU THE OBAMA

213
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
ADMINISTRATION HAD PROMISED

214
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO

215
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
THE NSA LEAKS.

216
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
NOW THAT SOMEONE HAS COME

217
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
FORWARD, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

218
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
ANDREW NAPOLITANO JOINS US

219
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
BY PHONE.

220
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
JUDGE ARE YOU WITH US?

221
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
>> YES.
>> Harris: FIRST EDWARD

222
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SNOWDEN ARE BLOWING THE

223
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
WHISTLE BUT SOME PEOPLE

224
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
WON'T CALL HIM A

225
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
WHISTLEBLOWER.

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
LET'S START THERE?

227
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
>> FOR HIM TO QUALIFY AS A

228
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
WHISTLEBLOWER HE WOULD NEED

229
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
TO DEMONSTRATE, HIS

230
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BEHAVIOR ON WHICH HE BLEW A

231
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
WHISTLE WAS ILLEGAL OR

232
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

233
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
ON ITS FACE I SAY THAT

234
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE

235
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
DOCUMENTS THAT THE
GOVERNMENT FILED WITH THE

236
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
COURT.

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
ON ITS FACE THEY FILE A

238
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
PROCEDURE.

239
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
AND COURT AUTHORIZED THIS

240
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
WARRANT OF THIS NATURE.

241
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CONTRARY TO THAT IS THE

242
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE

243
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS

244
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
WRITTEN TO PROHIBIT THE

245
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
TYPE OF FISHING EXPEDITION

246
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
THAT THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED

247
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
IN HERE.
YOU HAVE A STATUTE STATE

248
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT AND

249
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
LANGUAGE IN THE

250
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
CONSTITUTION ON ITS FACE

251
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
SUPPORTS THE WHISTLEBLOWER.

252
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
>> Harris: MEANWHILE, HE IS

253
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
IN HONG KONG.

254
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WHAT HE SAID IN PART OF

255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
THAT TELEVISION INTERVIEW

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
IS THAT HE IS HOPING THAT A

257
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
COUNTRY RECOGNIZES FREE

258
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
SPEECH WILL GIVE HIM

259
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
ASYLUM?
>> GOOD LORD, NOT IN CHINA.

260
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
CHINA IS ONE OF THE MOST

261
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
REPRESSIVE REGIMES ON THE

262
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
PLANET.

263
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
HONG KONG IS A UNIQUE PART

264
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
OF CHINA, BUT HONG KONG IS

265
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
GOVERNED BY CHINA AND THE

266
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
CHINA AND UNITED STATES

267
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREAT.

268
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
BECAUSE IT'S CHINA IT WILL

269
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
BE A POLITICAL AS WELL AS

270
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
LEGAL -- IF THE CHINESE

271
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO

272
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
COOPERATE WITH THE OBAMA

273
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ADMINISTRATION, SNOWDEN

274
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
WILL BE ON PLANE U.S.

275
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
MARSHALS BEFORE THE END OF

276
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
THE WEEK.

277
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

278
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
DOES NOT WANT TO COOPERATE

279
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
HE MAY HAVE FOUND A SAFE

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
HAVEN.

281
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
>> Harris: WHAT ABOUT
CHARGES AGAINST HIM?

282
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
>> VERY SERIOUS.

283
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
GOVERNMENT WILL CLAIM HE

284
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
ENGAGED IN, THAT

285
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
HE AIDED THE ENEMY AND

286
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
SERIOUSLY HARMED GOVERNMENT

287
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
PROGRAMS INTENDED TO

288
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
PROTECT THE NATIONAL

289
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY.

290
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
HIS DEFENSE WILL BE THE

291
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
GOVERNMENT BEHAVED

292
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY AND
PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW

293
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
ABOUT IT.

294
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
JURY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON

295
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
WHO THEY BELIEVE.

296
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
>> Harris: YOU ARE TALKING

297
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
ABOUT SOMETHING MORE

298
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
POLITICAL THAN LEGAL AS TO

299
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WHETHER HE WILL BE

300
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
EXTRADITED.

301
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT AND

302
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
LEADER OF CHINA WERE HERE.

303
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
HE SINCE LEFT.

304
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THAT

305
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
WOULD PLAY ANY PART TO

306
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
EXTRADITE THIS PERSON?

307
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
>> YES.

308
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA AND

309
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

310
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
STATES IN THE PAST 24 HOURS,

311
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
THE COUNTRIES HAVE IMPROVED

312
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
RELATIONSHIP FOR THE

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WEEKEND THEY SPENT

314
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
TOGETHER.

315
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
PRESIDENT OF CHINA IS NOT

316
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON.

317
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
MOST POWERFUL IS THE HEAD

318
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST

319
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
PARTY BUT THEY ARE

320
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
COLLEAGUES AND COLLABORATE

321
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
ON THEIR DECISION TO SEND

322
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
MR. SNOWDEN IS HERE.

323
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ONE HAS TO WONDER IF THE

324
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
PRESIDENT OF CHINA KNEW IT

325
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
WAS COMING WHEN HE WAS

326
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
TALKING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA

327
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
>> Harris: A LOT OF

329
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN SAYING

330
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
ON BLOGS AND ONLINE TONIGHT

331
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
AS THE STORY IS BREAKING

332
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
THEY FEEL SNOWDEN IS

333
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SOMEWHAT OF HERO THAT FEDS

334
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
HAVE BEEN MONITORING US.

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
IS THAT A DEFENSE POSSIBLY

336
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
FOR HIM?
>> THE FACT THAT PEOPLE

337
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
THINK HE IS A HERO WOULD

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
NOT BE A DEFENSE.

339
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
WHAT WOULD BE A DEFENSE

340
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WOULD BE IF HIS LAWYERS CAN

341
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE

342
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
GOVERNMENT'S BEHAVIOR WAS

343
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SO WIDE OFF THE MARK OF

344
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AMERICAN VALUES AND SO

345
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
CONTRARY TO THE

346
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
CONSTITUTION THAT HE TOOK
AN OATH TO UPHOLD AND

347
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
BARACK OBAMA TOOK A VOTE TO

348
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
UPHOLD AND CLAPPER TOOK THE

349
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
OATH TO UPHOLD THAT HE

350
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
SHOULD BE ORDERED

351
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
PROTECTION AS WHISTLEBLOWER.

352
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
>> Harris: BEFORE I LET YOU

353
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
GO, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THAT

354
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
INTERVIEW.
BECAUSE YOU ARE ON A

355
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
CELLPHONE.

356
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE

357
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
IT.

358
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE

359
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ISSUE HOW MUCH RISK THAT

360
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SNOWDEN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

361
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
HE HAS TAKEN?
>> THAT IS A FEAR I LIVE

362
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
UNDER FOR THE REST OF MY

363
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
LIFE.
YOU CAN'T COME FORWARD

364
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
AGAINST THE WORLD'S MOST

365
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE

366
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
AGENCIES AND BE COMPLETELY

367
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
FLEE FROM RISK BECAUSE THEY

368
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
ARE SUCH POWERFUL

369
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
ADVERSARIES.

370
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
NO ONE CAN OPPOSE THEM.

371
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
>> Harris: ONE POINT HE

372
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
FEARS FOR HIS LIFE?

373
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
>> HE COULD BE ARRESTED AT

374
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
ANY TIME A PLACE HE LEAST

375
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
EXPECTS.

376
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
>> Harris: JUDGE NAPOLITANO,

377
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000

THANK YOU.

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
HE LEAKED SUCH SENSITIVE

753
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR

754
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
GOVERNMENT.
>> I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO

755
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
SITS DAY TO DAY IN THE

756
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
OFFICE AND GOES -- THIS IS

757
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OUR

758
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
PLACE TO DECIDE.

759
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO DECIDE

760
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
WHETHER THE POLICIES ARE

761
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
RIGHT OR WRONG.

762
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
>> Harris: PETER KING SAYS

763
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
IF HE DID LEAK THE NSA DATA

764
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
AS HE CLAIMS, THE U.S.

765
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
GOVERNMENT MUST PROSECUTE

766
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
HIM TO THE FULL EXTENT OF

767
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THE LAW.

768
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
CONGRESSMAN KING JOINS US

769
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
BY PHONE?

770
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
>> HOW ARE YOU?

771
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
>> Harris: I'M WELL.

772
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
WHY MUST THE GOVERNMENT

773
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
PROSECUTE SNOWDEN?

774
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
>> THIS IS AN APPALLING

775
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
CRIME.
HE IS PUTTING AMERICAN

776
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
LIVES AT RISK.

777
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
HE IS JEOPARDIZING AMERICAN

778
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
INTELLIGENCE, HE HAS

779
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
SOURCES AND METHODS TO BE

780
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
KNOWN TO THE ENEMY.

781
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
THIS IS TREMENDOUS BOOST TO

782
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
AL-QAEDA.

783
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT

784
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
TO GET PRIVATE COMPANIES TO

785
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
WORK WITH US.

786
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
HE TIPPED OFF AL-QAEDA A

787
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

788
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
NO INDIVIDUAL CAN DO THIS.

789
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
HE HAS VIOLATED HIS OATH.

790
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
HE HAS DISCLOSED TOP SECRET

791
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

792
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
WE CANNOT ALLOW TO GO

793
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
UNPUNISHED.

794
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
>> Harris: WHEN YOU HEAR

795
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
PEOPLE THAT IS SOMEWHAT OF

796
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
HERO, MAYBE ACCUSING THE

797
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
GOVERNMENT OF OVERREACH.

798
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE

799
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
PEOPLE?

800
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
>> I WOULD SAY, THEY ARE

801
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
TOTALLY MISGUIDED.

802
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
IT'S NOT UP HIMHAM WHAT IS

803
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
MORAL OR WHAT IS NOT.

804
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
IF HE WAS AWARE OF ANY

805
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
ILLEGALITY.
GO TO THE CONGRESS OR

806
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

807
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
GO TO INSPECTOR GENUINE THE

808
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
C.I.A. OR NSA.

809
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
FOR HIM TO DECIDE ON HIS

810
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
OWN TO COME FORWARD THIS IS

811
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
ABSOLUTE DISGRACE.

812
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
PEOPLE THAT TRY TO MAKE HIM

813
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
HERO IT'S BEYOND ME.

814
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
DO THEY REALIZE THE

815
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY
ARE DOING HERE?

816
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
IF THIS PROGRAM HAD NOT

817
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
BEEN IN PLACE BACK IN 2009,

818
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED

819
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF

820
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
PEOPLE IN NEW YORK IN A

821
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
SUBWAY SYSTEM THE PLAN HE

822
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
HAD TO SET OFF EXPLOSIVES

823
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM.

824
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
IF I WANT TO COMPARE THE

825
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
HERO A PERSON WHO STOPPED

826
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
THAT ATTACK AS HE WAS

827
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
TRYING TO CARRY OUT THE

828
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
UNITED STATES.

829
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
ESPECIALLY THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE OF ILLEGALITY.

830
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
THIS IS CLEARLY IN

831
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.

832
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC

833
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
OBJECTIONS, THERE IS A FISA

834
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
COURT THAT MONITORS THIS ON

835
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
A REGULAR BASIS.

836
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
THERE IS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

837
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
AND ESPECIALLY THE FISA

838
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
COURT.

839
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
THIS IS UNDER COURT

840
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
SUPERVISION.
>> Harris: ONE OF THE

841
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
THINGS YOU WILL SEE WHEN

842
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
YOU WATCH THE TAPE, HE SAYS

843
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
HE KNEW THE RISKS BUT HE

844
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
FELT THE ABUSES HE WAS

845
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
WITNESSING AND POSSIBLY

846
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
TAKING A PART IN IN TERMS

847
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
OF MONITORING PHONE RECORDS

848
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
AND SNOOPING, HE THOUGHT

849
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THOSE WERE SO EGREGIOUS AND

850
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LISTEN?

851
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
>> WHO IS HE TO DECIDE TO

852
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
PUT AMERICAN LIVES AT RISK?

853
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
IF HE FELT THAT STRONGLY

854
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ABOUT IT, GO TO THE

855
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
INSPECTOR GENERAL.
GO TO THE JUSTICE

856
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
DEPARTMENT.
THE FACT IS YOU CANNOT HAVE

857
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE

858
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDING

859
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
WHAT LAW THEY ARE GOING TO

860
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
FOLLOW AND WHAT LAW THEY

861
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
ARE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW.

862
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
AND WHY IS HE IN HONG KONG?

863
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
TO BE IN CHINA IS THE

864
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
LEADING COUNTRY IN THE

865
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
WORLD AS FAR AS HACKING

866
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
INTO US AND TRYING TO STEAL

867
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
OUR SECRETS.

868
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
IN MANY WAYS, INTELLIGENCE

869
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WISE IS AN ENEMY COUNTRY.

870
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
WHY IS HE THERE SUBJECTING

871
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
HIMSELF TO CHINESE

872
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
INTELLIGENCE RAISES

873
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM.

874
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
HE HAS DISCLOSED AN

875
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
INCREDIBLE ASSISTANCE TO

876
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
AL-QAEDA.

877
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
AL-QAEDA IS TRYING TO KILL

878
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
AMERICANS.

879
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
THAT IS THE MESSAGE WE HAVE

880
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
TO KEEP IN MIND.

881
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
HIS ACTIONS AND VERY LIKELY

882
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
COULD RESULT IN THE DEATHS

883
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
OF INNOCENT AMERICAN LIVES.

884
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
>> Harris: YOU MENTION WHY

885
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
DID HE GO TO HONG KONG.

886
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
WE KNOW HE WAS WITH A

887
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
JOURNALIST WITH THE

888
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
GUARDIAN.
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS

889
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
AN AGREEMENT TO GO WITH

890
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
THAT JOURNALIST.

891
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
WE DO KNOW THIS IS A

892
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE

893
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
TERRITORY OF CHINA AND
THERE IS EXTRADITION

894
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
BETWEEN HONG KONG AND THE

895
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
UNITED STATES.

896
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS

897
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
GOING FORTH.

898
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
QUICKLY, FORECASTING INTO

TOMORROW, WHAT DO YOU

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
PERCEIVE WILL BE THE NEXT

901
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
FEW STEPS?
>> I WOULD HOPE THE JUSTICE

903
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
PROSECUTION AS SOON AS

904
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
POSSIBLE.
I HOPE OUR GOVERNMENT WILL

905
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
REACH OUT CHINA.

906
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
WE HAVE A TREATY WITH HONG

907
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
KONG BUT CHINA IS CALLING

908
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THE SHOTS HERE.

909
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
HE HAS PUT US THE THE MERCY

910
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
OF CHINA WE HAVE TO USE ALL

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
THE LEVERAGE AND POWER WE

912
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
HAVE AND GET HIM BACK TO

QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

915

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

942
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
PROGRAM?

943
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
>> HE DID.

944
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I AGREE WITH REPRESENTATIVE

945
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
KING THAT THIS IS TRAGIC.

946
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
THERE IS NO WAY THIS GUY

947
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
SHOULD GO ABOUT HIS

948
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
BUSINESS WITHOUT
CONSEQUENCES.

949
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I DON'T AGREE WITH PETER

950
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
KING THAT JAMES

951
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
SENSENBRENNER THAT WROTE

952
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
THE PATRIOT ACT I DIDN'T

953
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
WANT IT TO BE USED THAT

954
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
WAY.
I WOULD PUT THEM ON TRACK

955
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
FOR THE JUDICIAL WATCH TO

956
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
HELP WHISTLEBLOWERS AND

957
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
KING SAID HE SHOULD BE

958
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
DISCLOSING THIS TO CERTAIN

959
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
MEMBERS OF CAPITOL HILL.

960
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I HAD TO WHISTLE BLOW ON

961
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
ABLE DANGER REGARDING DATA

962
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
MINING PRE-9/11 SPEAKER OF

963
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
THE HOUSE DENNIS HASTERT

964
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
ASKED ME TO TESTIFY.

965
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
WE HAD OPEN AND CLOSED

966
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
HEARINGS.
THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO

967
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
DO IT.

968
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
UNFORTUNATELY FOR MR. SNOWDEN

969
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
HAS CAUSED FAR MORE

970
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
PROBLEMS FOR HIMSELF AND HE

971
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
HAS DEFECTED.
HE IS IN ENEMY TERRITORY

972
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
RIGHT NOW.

973
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
CHINA IS NOT AN ADVERSARY

974
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
OF OURS BUT THERE IS

975
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
HACKING GOING ON.

976
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
WHATEVER INFORMATION IS IN

977
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
HIS HEAD IS NOW WITH

978
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
CHINESE IN SOME FORM.

979
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
>> Harris: WOW!

980
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I HAD NOT HEARD ANYBODY PUT

981
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
IT EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

982
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
YOU HEARD CONGRESSMAN KING

983
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
TALKING A LITTLE BIT BUT

984
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
YOU DUG IN DEEPER.

985
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
THAT HAS A LOT OF IMPACT?

986
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
>> IT DOES.

987
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
HE HAS GIVEN THE CHINESE A

988
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
HUGE THING IN THE GAME.

989
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
HE IS A FORMER C.I.A.

990
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
OPERATIVE.

991
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'M TELLING YOU WITH HIS

992
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
ATTITUDE AND WAY HE HAS

993
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
TALKED ABOUT AND HE IS

994
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
DISGRUNTLED AND I SUSPECT

995
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HE HAS INFORMATION FROM

996
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
C.I.A.

997
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
RIGHT NOW, NSA IS PANICKING

998
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
BECAUSE EVERYTHING HE TOOK

999
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
THEY KNOW.

1000
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
ALL THE STUFF DOWNLOADED

1001
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
THEY ARE GOING BACK AND

1002
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
CHECKING AND RIGHT NOW,

1003
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
REPRESENTATIVE KING, NOW

1004
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

1005
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
HE HAS DONE BECAUSE WE TO

1006
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
DO DAMAGE CONTROL.

1007
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
>> Harris: I DO WANT TO

1008
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
TELL OUR VIEWERS, YOU AND I

1009
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

1010
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THE PROGRAM THAT THE NSA

1011
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
WAS RUNNING AS BEING AN

1012
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
OVERREACH IN YOUR OPINION?

1013
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
>> RIGHT.
>> Harris: AS I UNDERSTAND

1014
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
IT YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED

1015
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
EDWARD SNOWDEN HAD HE COME

1016
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
TO YOU?

1017
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> AS MUCH AS I THINK

1018
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
SENATOR PAUL AND OTHERS

1019
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
HAVE LEGITIMATE CRITICISM

1020
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE

1021
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
DEBATE.

1022
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A

1023
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
DEBATE IN THE OPEN.

1024
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
WITH THAT SAID,

1025
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
REPRESENTATIVE KING IS

1026
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
CORRECT, HE HAD NO RIGHT TO

1027
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
UNILATERALLY ON HIS OWN

1028
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
WITHOUT CHECKING OR ANYBODY

1029
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
WITHIN HIS CHAIN OF COMMAND

1030
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
TO GO PUBLIC ON THIS.

1031
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I WENT PUBLIC AFTER

1032
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
CONGRESS GAVE ME PERMISSION

1033
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
TO DO THAT.

1034
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THIS GUY DID NOT WANTED TO

1035
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
DO DAMAGE.

1036
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
HE HAS DONE DAMAGE AND DO

1037
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
MORE BY THE FACT HE IS

1038
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
SITTING IN CHINA.

1039
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
>> YOU WATCH HIM IN THIS

1040
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
INTERVIEW BY THE GUARDIAN

1041
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
NEWSPAPER, IT'S JUST WHY HE

1042
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
FELT THE DESPERATE NEED TO

1043
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
COME FORWARD.
ONE OF THE THINGS, THE WAY

1044
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THEY WERE COLLECTING

1045
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
INFORMATION ON EVERYDAY

1046
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
AMERICANS, HE THOUGHT IT

1047
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
COULD POSSIBLY FALL INTO

1048
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THE WRONG HANDS.

1049
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1050
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ANYBODY IN THE POSITION

1051
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WITH ACCESS TECHNICAL

1052
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
CAPABILITIES I HAD COULD

1053
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
SUCK OUT SECRETS AND PASS

1054
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET TO

1055
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
RUSSIA.

1056
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
THEY HAVE AN OPEN DOOR AS

1057
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
WE DO.

1058
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
>> Harris: IS HE RIGHT?

1059
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
>> NO, HE IS NOT.

1060
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
HE IS ESSENTIALLY, LIKE A

1061
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
MASTER AD MAN OVERSEEING

1062
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I.T. -- I THINK HE HAS

1063
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
ACCESS TO BRIEFINGS.

1064
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
WE NEVER LEFT BRIEFING ON A

1065
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
NETWORK OR BECAUSE OF THIS

1066
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
POTENTIAL HAPPENING.
HE IS NOT INVOLVED.

1067
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE

1068
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
TEAM RUNNING THESE THINGS.

1069
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
SO AS MUCH AS I THINK THERE

1070
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
MAY BE VALID CONCERNS

1071
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
REGARDING THE ASKING OF THE

1072
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
PROGRAM, HE IS AN ADMIN

1073
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
GUY.

1074
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
HE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE ARMY,

1075
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
HE BROKE HIS LEGS.

1076
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
DIDN'T LIKE THE C.I.A. WAS

1077
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
RUNNING OPERATIONS.

1078
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE

1079
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
GUY IS DISGRUNTLED.

1080
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
IT'S NOT ABOUT FIXING

1081
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
THINGS.

1082
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO POKE

1083
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
SOMEONE IN THE EYE WITHOUT

1084
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
ANY INTEREST TO FIX WHAT

1085
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
WAS BROKEN.
>> Harris: WHEN GREENWALD

1086
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
AND THE JOURNALIST FROM THE

1087
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
GUARDIAN WHO BROUGHT THIS

1088
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
INFORMATION TO THE WORLD

1089
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
CLAIM TO HAVE MORE, IF

1090
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
THERE ARE OTHER AMERICANS

1091
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
IN EDWARD NODEN'S SHOES AND

1092
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
THEY HAVE INFORMATION TO
GET OUT THERE, WHAT WOULD

1093
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
YOU TELL THEM AT THIS

1094
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
POINT?

1095
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
>> I ADMIRE WHAT GLENN N

1096
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
DOES.
IN THIS CASE HE IS WRONG.

1097
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
UNFORTUNATELY HE DOES HAVE

1098
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
MORE INFORMATION.
I DON'T THINK HE HAS OTHER

1099
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
SOURCES, I THINK SNOWDEN

1100
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
HAS GIVEN FAR MORE TO HIM

1101
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
THAN HE IS WILLING TO

1102
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
ADMIT.
THIS IS GOING TO BE

1103
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
TREASURE TROVE OF STUFF

1104
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
COMING OUT THE COMING

1105
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
WEEKS.

1106
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
NSA IS PRETTY MUCH AWARE

1107
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
WHAT HE TOOK WITH HIM.

1108
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
>> Harris: I TELL YOU, WHEN

1109
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
YOU AND I WERE GOING TO

1110
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
TALK SPEAK ABOUT OVERREACH

1111
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
BUT YOU HAVE GIVEN US THE

1112
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
WORD THAT THIS MAN HAS

1113
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
DEFECTED TO CHINA.

1114
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
THAT IS POWERFUL TERM.

1115
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
LIEUTENANT COLONEL TONY

1116
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
SCHAFFER, THANK YOU VERY

1117
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
MUCH.

1118
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON

1119
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
STORY DOMESTICALLY.

1120
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN A

1121
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
CALIFORNIA SHOOTING RAMPAGE

1122
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
WE FOLLOWED LAST WEEK,

1123
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
NAMING THE MAN THEY SAY

1124
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WENT ON THE ATTACK AND

1125
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
RELEASED THIS PICTURE OF

1126
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
