[000:00:02;769] IN THE VIDEO, THE AUTHORITIES
[000:00:06;139] SAY THE WHITE SMOKE INDICATES A
[000:00:07;374] BOMB BUILT WITH LOW-VELOCITY
[000:00:10;043] EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES, NOT MILITARY
[000:00:12;212] GRADE.
[000:00:12;645] >> SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP!
[000:00:15;382] >> RUN!
[000:00:15;815] >> THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE
[000:00:16;583] RESOURCES AS WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER
[000:00:17;984] BOMB ATTACKS, BUT THEY KNEW HOW
[000:00:19;619] TO MAKE THE BOMB GO BOOM.
[000:00:21;187] >> Reporter: EXPERTS SAY THE
[000:00:22;255] LARGE PIECES OF METAL, AS SEEN
[000:00:24;391] HERE IN THE AIR, SUGGEST THE
[000:00:25;992] BOMBS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCEALED
[000:00:27;560] IN OR UNDER A MAILBOX OR TRASH
[000:00:29;162] BARREL, AS ONE WITNESS
[000:00:30;230] DESCRIBED.
[000:00:31;297] >> I LITERALLY SAW THE GARBAGE
[000:00:32;365] BARREL EXPLODE.
[000:00:33;400] I SAW AT THE FLASH, THE FIRE,
[000:00:34;467] THE SMOKE, AND I RAN AS FAST AS
[000:00:35;535] I COULD.
[000:00:38;405] >> Reporter: MIKE SULLIVAN IS
[000:00:39;239] THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ATF.
[000:00:40;173] >> ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY
[000:00:43;777] COLLECT IT IS, IT MIGHT NOT LOOK
[000:00:46;279] LIKE MUCH.
[000:00:47;414] BUT TO INVESTIGATORS,
[000:00:48;214] EVERY SMALL PIECE OF EVIDENCE
[000:00:48;982] THEY COLLECT WILL BE A TREASURE
[000:00:49;749] TROVE.
[000:00:50;183] >> Reporter: IF THE FBI BELIEF
[000:00:50;950] ABOUT THE PRESSURE COOKER BEARS
[000:00:51;785] OUT, IT WILL BE NO SURPRISE TO
[000:00:53;253] COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS WHO
[000:00:54;320] HAVE WARNED ABOUT THEIR POSSIBLE
[000:00:57;924] USE WITH READILY AVAILABLE
[000:00:59;926] COMPONENTS FOR YEARS.
[000:01:00;527] THERE ARE NUMEROUS DESCRIPTIONS
[000:01:01;327] ONLINE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A
[000:01:02;562] PRESSURE-COOKER BOMB, INCLUDING
[000:01:04;164] THIS DETAILED ONE POSTED IN AN
[000:01:05;732] AL QAEDA INTERNET PUBLICATION.
[000:01:07;867] APRIL IS ALSO A MONTH WITH
[000:01:08;868] SIGNIFICANCE FOR DOMESTIC TERROR
[000:01:09;969] GROUPS.
[000:01:12;105] THE MONTH OF THE WACO RAID AND
[000:01:13;173] THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.
[000:01:15;275] AS PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE CLEAR
[000:01:16;876] TODAY, THERE'S STILL NO EVIDENCE
[000:01:18;545] OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
[000:01:19;612] ACT OF TERRORISM.
[000:01:21;714] >> THIS WAS A HEINOUS AND
[000:01:23;249] COWARDLY ACT, AND GIVEN WHAT WE
[000:01:25;952] NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE,
[000:01:27;520] THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING IT AS
[000:01:28;288] AN ACT OF TERRORISM.
[000:01:32;826] >> Reporter: THE FBI AGENTS TELL
[000:01:34;961] US THEY HAVE TONS OF VIDEO, AND
[000:01:36;529] SOMEWHERE IN THERE WILL BE A
[000:01:37;597] PICTURE OF THE PERSON WHO
[000:01:39;199] PLANTED THESE TWO BOMBS, DIANE.
[000:01:41;334] >> SPEAKING OF PICTURES, I WANT
[000:01:42;402] TO ASK YOU ABOUT A PHOTO THAT
[000:01:43;470] EVERYBODY WAS E-MAILING TODAY.
[000:01:46;106] IT IS A MAN STANDING UP ON TOP
[000:01:47;173] OF A ROOF.
[000:01:50;643] YOU CAN MOVE IN THERE, YOU SEE
[000:01:52;112] IT RIGHT THERE.
[000:01:52;912] WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?
[000:01:54;814] >> Reporter: WELL, IT'S VERY
[000:01:55;682] INTRIGUING, BUT AUTHORITIES SAY
[000:01:56;716] THEY'RE GIVING IT NO SPECIAL
[000:01:57;784] PRIORITY.
[000:01:58;852] IT'S ONE OF MANY TIPS AND LEADS
[000:01:59;986] THEY'RE FOLLOWING.
[000:02:01;020] THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE
[000:02:02;589] PERSON WHO HAD THAT UNUSUALLY
[000:02:03;623] HEAVY BLACK BAG THE DAY OF THE
[000:02:04;390] RACE.
[000:02:06;326] >> AS YOU SAID THE STRONGEST
[000:02:07;894] CLUES ARE IN THE NATURE OF THE
[000:02:08;962] BOMB.
[000:02:13;066] >>> UP NEXT, ABC'S SENIOR
[000:02:15;168] NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JIM
[000:02:17;270] AVILA, SHOWS US JUST HOW FAR THE
[000:02:20;140] BLAST FROM THE BOMBS TRAVELED.
[000:02:21;241] >> Reporter: THE KILLER BOMBS
[000:02:22;642] LIKELY CONTAINED LESS THAN TWO
[000:02:24;210] POUNDS OF COMMON BLACK POWDER
[000:02:26;346] EXPLOSIVE, SAYS ONE OF THE
[000:02:27;413] NATIONS LEADING IED EXPERTS.
[000:02:29;549] EVEN LEAVING THE CHARACTERISTIC
[000:02:31;151] WHITE SMOKE.
[000:02:32;719] BOMBS DESIGNED TO SPREAD TERROR
[000:02:34;854] AND DEATH WITH A LETHAL BLAST OF
[000:02:36;422] METAL SHRAPNEL.
[000:02:38;057] >> LOOKS LIKE HE WAS OUT TO KILL
[000:02:38;791] AND MAIM.
[000:02:40;193] >> Reporter: HOLD IT RIGHT
[000:02:40;860] THERE.
[000:02:42;862] HERE WE SEE WINDOWS BLOWN OUT
[000:02:44;964] HERE, BUT THE BUILDINGS
[000:02:46;533] THEMSELVES ARE INTACT.
[000:02:48;668] WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT
[000:02:50;770] WHAT THIS BOMBER WANTED TO DO?
[000:02:52;939] >> THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE
[000:02:53;973] DOWN THE BUILDING.
[000:02:54;607] THAT WASN'T HIS MAIN TARGET.
[000:02:55;608] IT WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARATHON
[000:02:56;643] AND KILL PEOPLE IN THAT
[000:02:57;710] IMMEDIATE AREA.
[000:03:00;346] >> Reporter: HOUSTON SAYS THIS
[000:03:03;550] IS CLASSIC IED DESIGN, THE KILL
[000:03:05;151] ZONE FROM THE BLAST, ONE TO TWO
[000:03:06;186] YARDS.
[000:03:07;787] ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTS FROM
[000:03:09;389] THE BOMB'S SITE, POWERFUL ENOUGH
[000:03:10;456] TO KNOCK A RUNNER OFF HIS FEET
[000:03:12;025] TEN YARDS AWAY.
[000:03:13;626] AND TOPPLE ANOTHER MAN ON HIS
[000:03:16;296] COUCH FROM THE THIRD FLOOR OF
[000:03:17;363] THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR, 20 YARDS
[000:03:18;431] AWAY.
[000:03:22;569] >> IT LOOKS LIKE A BASIC DESIGN
[000:03:24;804] OF AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE
[000:03:27;240] DEVICE.
[000:03:28;908] HOWEVER, THE PLACEMENT OF IT IS
[000:03:31;911] SOPHISTICATED.
[000:03:32;445] THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WANTED
[000:03:33;813] TO DO.
[000:03:34;247] >> Reporter: THE PRESSURE COOKER
[000:03:35;048] IS WELL KNOWN BY THE MILITARY AS
[000:03:35;815] A LETHAL BOMB CARRIER, COVERED
[000:03:36;583] IN TRAINING MANUALS AND
[000:03:37;450] EXPLAINED IN VIDEO.
[000:03:40;620] >> Reporter: THEY'RE SMALL,
[000:03:41;688] EASILY MADE, EVEN CRUDE.
[000:03:45;425] BUT OUR BOMB EXPERTS SAY THE
[000:03:48;294] PLANNING AND EXECUTION TELL US
[000:03:49;529] THAT THE TERRORIST WAS
[000:03:50;830] WELL-TRAINED.
[000:03:51;331] >> I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT'S
[000:03:52;098] A LONE ACTOR.
[000:03:52;665] HE'S DEFINITELY BEEN WORKING ON
[000:03:53;399] THIS FOR A WHILE, THE PLANNING
[000:03:54;500] AND WORKING ON PUTTING THE
[000:03:55;568] DEVICES TOGETHER.
[000:03:56;636] >> Reporter: BUT NONE OF THE
[000:03:57;704] CLUES SO FAR TELL OUR EXPERT
[000:03:59;305] WHETHER THIS TERRORIST WAS PART
[000:04:00;907] OF ANY ONE ORGANIZATION.
[000:04:01;975] DIANE?
[000:04:03;009] >> THANKS SO MUCH, JIM.
[000:04:06;512] >>> NOW FROM BOSTON, WE TURN TO
[000:04:08;815] BREAKING NEWS WE HAVE AT THIS
[000:04:11;117] HOUR.
[000:04:11;551] A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A UNITED
[000:04:12;952] STATES SENATOR WAS INTERCEPTED,
[000:04:14;487] FOUND TO CONTAIN A DEADLY
[000:04:17;857] POISON.

[000:04:23;429] OUT OF WASHINGTON.
[000:04:25;131] PIERRE?
[000:04:25;598] >> TONIGHT THE SENATE IS ON HIGH
[000:04:27;533] ALERT AFTER A LETTER BOUND FOR
[000:04:28;735] ONE OF ITS MEMBERS WAS
[000:04:29;936] INTERCEPTED BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE
[000:04:30;937] BEEN TAINTED WITH POISON.
[000:04:33;139] SOURCES ARE TELLING US TONIGHT A
[000:04:36;743] LETTER ADDRESSED TO MISSISSIPPI
[000:04:37;510] SENATOR ROGER WICKER TESTED
[000:04:39;212] POSITIVE FOR RICIN IN A FIELD
[000:04:42;615] TEST IN MARYLAND.
[000:04:44;050] THE LETTER WAS POST MARKED
[000:04:45;752] MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.
[000:04:46;452] TONIGHT THERE'S NO INFORMATION
[000:04:47;353] ON WHO MAY HAVE SENT IT.
[000:04:49;689] RICIN IS DER REIFFED FROM CASTER
[000:04:52;325] BEANS AND CAN BE LETHAL IF
[000:04:55;461] INGESTED OR INHALED.
[000:04:56;963] FIELD TESTS TO DETECTIVE IT ARE
[000:04:59;332] UNRELIABLE.
[000:04:59;832] A SOURCE TELLS US THE LETTER IS
[000:05:02;568] TESTED AGAIN IN A LABORATORY TO
[000:05:03;603] GET A DEFINITIVE RESULT.
[000:05:06;606] THE PACKAGE WAS INTERCEPTED AND
[000:05:07;373] NEVER REACHED THE CAPITAL
[000:05:09;075] COMPLEX.
[000:05:09;542] STILL, ADDITIONAL SECURITY IS
[000:05:10;443] BEING PUT IN PLACE.
[000:05:12;312] ALL MAIL TO CAPITOL HILL HAS
[000:05:14;514] BEEN STOPPED.
[000:05:15;148] SUCH SCARES HAVE HAPPENED IN
[000:05:17;183] WASHINGTON BEFORE.
[000:05:17;784] IN 2004, A LETTER CONTAINING
[000:05:22;021] RICIN POWDER SHUT DOWN THREE
[000:05:22;755] SENATE OFFICES FOR TWO DAYS.
[000:05:24;724] EXTRAORDINARY PRECAUTIONS WERE
[000:05:26;259] TAKEN TO KEEP SENATORS AND THEIR
[000:05:28;795] STAFF SAFE.
[000:05:30;263] IN 2003, THE SECRET SERVICE
[000:05:35;702] REVEALED PRESIDENT BUSH RECEIVED
[000:05:38;037] A LETTER CONTAINING A VIAL OF
[000:05:41;407] RICIN.
[000:05:41;841] THERE'S NO INDICATION THIS IS
[000:05:43;409] TIED TO BOSTON, DIANE.
[000:05:45;011] >> PIERRE THOMAS STAYING ON THIS
[000:05:46;346] STORY AS IT UNFOLDS TONIGHT.
[000:05:48;414] BUT NOW WE RETURN BACK TO BOSTON
[000:05:52;185] AND ONE MORE THING WE THINK WE
[000:05:53;653] KNOW ABOUT THE BOMBER.
[000:05:55;021] HE MAY HAVE STUDIED LAST YEAR'S
[000:05:57;156] RACE.
[000:05:57;890] PINPOINTING THE MOMENT THE
[000:06:00;626] MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RUNNERS
[000:06:02;261] CROSSED THE FINISH LINE.
[000:06:03;463] LAST YEAR, FOUR HOURS AND 18
[000:06:04;897] MINUTES IN, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER,
[000:06:06;966] THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE TIME
[000:06:10;403] HIS BOMB EXPLODED.
[000:06:11;471] FROM BOSTON TONIGHT WE HAVE NEW
[000:06:14;006] IMAGES OF A CITY INTERRUPTED,
[000:06:18;411] HALF-EATEN SANDWICHES ABANDONED
[000:06:20;546] WHERE THE BOMBS WENT OFF.
[000:06:21;881] AS DAN HARRIS GIVES US NEW
[000:06:24;317] INSIGHT, TAKING US BEHIND THOSE
[000:06:26;686] IMAGES WE ALL WATCHED TOGETHER
[000:06:31;224] AS IT HAPPENED.
[000:06:34;994] >> Reporter: TONIGHT NEW VIDEO
[000:06:35;728] IS GIVING US FRESH, FRIGHTENING
[000:06:36;629] INSIGHT INTO THE ATTACKS.
[000:06:37;630] LOOK AT THIS CELLPHONE FOOTAGE,
[000:06:38;698] SHOT BY A SPECTATOR STANDING
[000:06:40;299] BETWEEN THE TWO BOMBS.
[000:06:41;901] AFTER THE FIRST EXPLOSION,
[000:06:43;536] THERE'S CONFUSION, BUT RELATIVE
[000:06:45;671] CALM AS PEOPLE MOVE AWAY.
[000:06:48;307] BUT THEN AFTER 11 SECONDS GO
[000:06:55;014] BY -- AFTER THE SECOND SPLOGE
[000:07:00;219] EXPLOSION, PANIC.
[000:07:00;753] IN THE AFTERMATH, YOU CAN SEE
[000:07:03;890] PEOPLE RUNNING ALONGSIDE WALKS,
[000:07:06;659] CARPETED IN GLASS -- AND
[000:07:11;764] VICTIMS.

[000:07:15;067] TRAFFIC TAKES US FURTHER INSIDE
[000:07:15;968] THOSE MOMENTS.

[000:07:28;648] AND THAT 78-YEAR-OLD RUNNER WHO
[000:07:29;715] WAS KNOCKED DOWN BUT PICKED
[000:07:31;317] HIMSELF UP AND FINISHED THE
[000:07:32;018] RACE.
[000:07:35;021] TODAY BOSTON WAS CRAWLING WITH
[000:07:36;088] ARMORED VEHICLES, UNIFORMED
[000:07:37;690] NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OFFICERS
[000:07:39;325] ARMED WITH HIGH POWERED RIFLES.
[000:07:41;461] ON A NORMAL TUESDAY AFTERNOON,
[000:07:43;029] THIS PART OF TOWN WOULD BE
[000:07:44;630] CRAWLING WITH FOOT AND ROAD
[000:07:45;731] TRAFFIC, BUT TODAY IT'S ON
[000:07:48;334] LOCKDOWN.
[000:07:49;969] POLICE HAVE SET UP A MASSIVE
[000:07:51;003] CRIME SCENE.

[000:07:59;345] WHAT IS A 12-BLOCK CRIME SCENE
[000:08:00;413] RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THIS CITY.
[000:08:02;548] ALSO TODAY WE GOT OUR FIRST

[000:08:21;033] THAT HER DEATH WAS JUST A WASTE.
[000:08:22;535] LATE TODAY WE LEARNED THAT THE

[000:08:25;705] STUDENT AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY.
[000:08:27;306] WE DO NOT HAVE A NAME THERE.
[000:08:28;908] AND OF COURSE SCORES OF OTHER

[000:08:31;043] ATTACK.

[000:08:38;184] HOW BOSTON IS COMING TOGETHER IN

[000:08:52;565] AND THE WORLD.
[000:08:53;599] LISTEN.
[000:08:55;735] >> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REFUSE TO
[000:08:56;836] BE TERRORIZED.
[000:08:59;972] BECAUSE WHAT THE WORLD SAW
[000:09:01;040] YESTERDAY IN THE AFTERMATH OF
[000:09:03;175] THE EXPLOSIONS WERE STORIES OF
[000:09:04;744] HEROISM AND KINDNESS AND
[000:09:06;345] GENEROSITY AND LOVE.
[000:09:09;015] SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WE
[000:09:10;650] ARE, WHAT AMERICA IS, HOW WE
[000:09:13;286] RESPOND TO EVIL, THAT'S IT.

[000:13:00;679] TALLEST ON HIS TEAM.

[000:13:04;316] JUST A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG BOY.
[000:13:05;751] >> Reporter: FRIENDS SAY THE
[000:13:07;086] FAMILY WENT TO THE BOSTON

[000:13:11;023] BUT ONE OF THOSE TWIN EXPLOSIONS

[000:13:25;171] HE WAS DRESSED IN HOSPITAL
[000:13:26;138] SCRUBS AND I SAID, OH, MY GOD,
[000:13:28;307] BILL, ARE YOU OKAY?

[000:13:54;533] IN THE NANED, -- NEIGHBORHOOD,

[000:14:09;648] STAFF OUTSIDE MARTIN'S SCHOOL

[000:14:12;351] HIM AS AN ENERGETIC YOUNG BOY
[000:14:13;953] WHO HAD BIG DREAMS AND HIGH
[000:14:15;554] HOPES FOR HIS FUTURE.
[000:14:20;326] A VIGIL IS TAKING PLACE TONIGHT
[000:14:22;461] AT THE RICHARDS' FAMILY CHURCH.
[000:14:26;699] AN OUTPOURING OF PRAYERS FOR
[000:14:28;834] MARTIN'S MOTHER AND SISTER WHO
[000:14:29;902] REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL.
[000:14:32;004] >> IN BOSTON FOR US AGAIN
[000:14:37;977] TONIGHT, LINSEY DAVIS.
[000:14:39;078] AND WHEN WE COME BACK, YOU'LL
[000:14:40;646] MEET A SURGEON WHO KNEW ABOUT
[000:14:43;282] TRAUMA IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.
[000:14:44;683] HE RAN THE MARATHON, AND THEN
[000:14:45;784] FACED IT AGAIN.
[000:14:52;091] COPD includes emphysema
[000:14:52;091] and chronic bronchitis.
[000:14:54;994] SPIRIVA is a once-daily inhaled
[000:14:54;994] COPD maintenance treatment
[000:14:58;097] that helps open my obstructed
[000:14:58;097] airways for a full 24 hours.
[000:15:02;301] You know, SPIRIVA helps
[000:15:02;301] me breathe easier.
[000:15:05;371] SPIRIVA HandiHaler Tiotropium
[000:15:05;371] Bromide Inhalation Powder
[000:15:08;774] does not replace fast-acting
[000:15:08;774] inhalers for sudden symptoms.
[000:15:11;744] Tell your doctor if you
[000:15:11;744] have kidney problems,
[000:15:13;746] glaucoma, trouble urinating,
[000:15:13;746] or an enlarged prostate.
[000:15:16;515] These may worsen with SPIRIVA.
[000:15:17;983] Discuss all medicines you
[000:15:17;983] take, even eye drops.
[000:15:20;753] Stop taking SPIRIVA and seek
[000:15:20;753] immediate medical help
[000:15:23;289] if your breathing
[000:15:23;289] suddenly worsens,
[000:15:24;890] your throat or tongue swells,
[000:15:24;890] you get hives, vision changes
[000:15:27;660] or eye pain, or problems
[000:15:27;660] passing urine.
[000:15:29;995] Other side effects include
[000:15:29;995] dry mouth and constipation.
[000:15:33;132] Nothing can reverse COPD.
[000:15:35;134] SPIRIVA helps me
[000:15:35;134] breathe better.
[000:15:38;537] Does breathing with
[000:15:38;537] COPD weigh you down?
[000:15:41;307] Don't wait to ask your
[000:15:41;307] doctor about SPIRIVA.
[000:15:46;578] A BODY AT REST
[000:15:46;578] TENDS TO STAY AT REST...
[000:15:48;480] WHILE A BODY IN MOTION
[000:15:48;480] TENDS TO STAY IN MOTION.
[000:15:51;517] STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
[000:15:51;517] EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.
[000:15:54;486] BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,
[000:15:55;888] STAYING ACTIVE
[000:15:55;888] CAN BE DIFFICULT.
[000:15:57;990] PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
[000:15:57;990] CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN
[000:16:00;659] SO YOUR BODY
[000:16:00;659] CAN STAY IN MOTION.
[000:16:02;528] BECAUSE JUST ONE
[000:16:02;528] 200MG CELEBREX A DAY
[000:16:05;331] CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF
[000:16:07;499] FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
[000:16:07;499] AND INFLAMMATION.
[000:16:10;169] PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,
[000:16:11;603] CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
[000:16:11;603] DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION
[000:16:14;073] SO MOVING IS EASIER.
[000:16:15;741] CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN
[000:16:15;741] WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD.
[000:16:18;544] AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.
[000:16:20;479] YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
[000:16:20;479] SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS
[000:16:22;147] WITH THE RISKS.
[000:16:23;582] ALL PRESCRIPTION NSAIDS,
[000:16:23;582] LIKE CELEBREX, IBUPROFEN,
[000:16:26;118] NAPROXEN AND MELOXICAM
[000:16:27;286] HAVE THE SAME
[000:16:27;286] CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.
[000:16:29;621] THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
[000:16:29;621] THE CHANCE
[000:16:31;090] OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
[000:16:31;090] WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.
[000:16:33;692] THIS CHANCE INCREASES
[000:16:33;692] IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE
[000:16:35;527] OR RISK FACTORS
[000:16:35;527] SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
[000:16:37;796] OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
[000:16:37;796] FOR LONG PERIODS.
[000:16:39;898] NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,
[000:16:41;467] INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
[000:16:41;467] SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS
[000:16:43;769] OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
[000:16:43;769] PROBLEMS,
[000:16:45;337] SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,
[000:16:46;739] WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
[000:16:46;739] AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.
[000:16:49;241] PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
[000:16:49;241] AND THE ELDERLY
[000:16:50;976] ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR
[000:16:50;976] STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.
[000:16:53;078] DON'T TAKE CELEBREX
[000:16:54;546] IF YOU HAVE BLEEDING
[000:16:54;546] IN THE STOMACH OR INTESTINE,
[000:16:56;582] OR HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK, HIVES,
[000:16:57;983] OTHER ALLERGIES TO ASPIRIN,

[000:17:21;774] WHO WERE LOST, THERE WERE SO
[000:17:23;242] MANY PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED US.
[000:17:24;810] EARLIER TODAY I TALKED IT TRAUMA
[000:17:28;180] SURGEON, DR. DAVID KING, WHO HAD
[000:17:30;616] SAVED LIVES IN IRAQ AND
[000:17:33;185] AFGHANISTAN, AND YESTERDAY RAN
[000:17:33;919] THE MARATHON AND THEN DID IT
[000:17:36;288] AGAIN.
[000:17:36;722] >> YOU COMPLETED THE MARATHON?
[000:17:38;323] >> THAT'S CORRECT.
[000:17:40;959] I WAS IN THE ATHLETE'S RECOVERY
[000:17:43;662] AREA FOR ABOUT 30 TO 45 MINUTES.
[000:17:45;798] BUT ESSENTIALLY JUST LEFT THERE
[000:17:50;035] WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF AND, OF
[000:17:51;103] COURSE, IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE
[000:17:52;171] HOSPITAL.
[000:17:53;739] >> WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF
[000:17:54;807] WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS?
[000:17:56;942] >> THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE
[000:17:58;544] EMERGENCY ROOM AND LOOKED AT THE
[000:18:01;180] CASUALTIES, WITHOUT EVEN
[000:18:03;348] EXAMINING THE PATIENTS IN
[000:18:04;883] DETAIL, I COULD JUST SEE THE
[000:18:07;553] PATTERN OF INJURY, AND I THOUGHT
[000:18:08;620] TO MYSELF, THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE
[000:18:10;722] I WAS BACK IN IRAQ OR
[000:18:11;356] AFGHANISTAN.
[000:18:12;291] >> YOU'RE FINDING METALLIC
[000:18:14;960] PARTICLES, SMALL METAL BALLS,
[000:18:16;528] NAILS, SCREWS IN THESE WOUNDS?
[000:18:19;231] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:18:21;333] WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THEY
[000:18:22;367] ARE.
[000:18:23;435] WHETHER THEY'RE BB'S OR METAL
[000:18:24;503] BALL BEARINGS.

[000:18:28;273] SCREWS AND OTHER PIECES OF
[000:18:29;842] METAL.
[000:18:31;977] THEY'RE TWISTED AND DEFORMED.
[000:18:34;146] IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY'RE
[000:18:35;180] FROM THE BOMB ITSELF OR THE
[000:18:37;316] ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE BOMB.
[000:18:39;952] >> BUT THE BOMB MAY HAVE HIT
[000:18:41;019] OTHER METAL OBJECTS THAT THEN
[000:18:42;087] SPLINTERED APART?
[000:18:43;722] >> THIS IS WHAT I'M HEARING,
[000:18:45;257] ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW
[000:18:46;325] THAT FOR A FACT.
[000:18:49;495] THE OPERATIONS THAT WE HAVE
[000:18:51;096] PERFORMED ARE IDENTICAL TO THE
[000:18:53;732] KIND OF WORK WE WOULD DO IN THE
[000:18:55;834] ARMY AT A FORWARD SURGICAL TEAM
[000:18:56;935] OR COMBAT SUPPORT HOSPITAL.
[000:18:59;071] >> WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS

[000:19:21;393] AND CHANTIX HELPED ME QUIT.
[000:19:23;395] I HONESTLY LOVED SMOKING,
[000:19:25;631] AND I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
[000:19:25;631] I WOULD EVER QUIT.

[000:19:31;537] IT REDUCES THE URGE TO SMOKE.
[000:19:33;305] IT PUT ME AT EASE THAT YOU COULD
[000:19:33;305] SMOKE ON THE FIRST WEEK.
[000:19:36;175] [ Male Announcer ] SOME PEOPLE
