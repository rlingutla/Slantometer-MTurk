00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:14,292
POINT OUT, IT TOOK THE SECOND   
QUESTION FOR THE ISSUE OF GUN   

117
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,229
CONTROL TO COME UP.             
AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, A   

118
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:23,602
MAJOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION     
GOING ON WITH ALCOHOL, TOBACCO  

119
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,970
AND FIREARMS TO FIND OUT HOW    
THIS MAN GOT AHOLD OF THE       

120
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,404
WEAPONS THAT HE DID AND WHY HE  
WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF        

121
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,207
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.              
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS DEFLECTED

122
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,977
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT GUN CONTROL 
SAYING THERE'S A TIME TO HAVE   

123
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,513
POLICY DEBATES.                 
TODAY IS NOT THE DAY TO DO THAT.

124
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,183
TODAY IS THE DAY TO REMEMBER THE
VICTIMS OF THE SHOOTER AND TO   

125
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:44,956
PRAY FOR THOSE THAT WERE SO     
GRIEVE USUALLY WOUNDED.         

126
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:49,327
NOW, THE PRESIDENT PLANS ON     
LEAVING EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING 

127
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:55,867
FOR LAS VEGAS AFTER HE GETS BACK
FROM HIS TRIP TO PUERTO RICO AND

128
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,403
PERHAPS THE VIRGIN ISLANDS      
TOMORROW.                       

129
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,872
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SPEND    
TIME IN VEGAS.                  

130
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,109
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE WANTS
TO SPENT MORE THAN A DAY IN     

131
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,377
VEGAS.                          
BUT TODAY SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS

132
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,446
SAID THE ITINERARY FOR THE      
MOMENT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL BE    

133
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,583
THERE FOR WEDNESDAY AND NOTHING 
BEYOND THAT, SHEP.              

134
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,185
>> Shepard: MUCH MORE ON VEGAS  
IN JUST A MOMENT.               

135
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,722
PRESIDENT TRUMP HEADED TO PUERTO
RICO TOMORROW AFTER HURRICANE   

136
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:22,360
MARIA DEVASTATED THE TERRITORY  
TWO WEEKS AGO.                  

137
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:28,700
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE       
WITHOUT POWER AND MANY NEED     

138
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,768
BASIC SUPPLIES LIKE FOOD AND    
WATER.                          

139
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,169
THE PRESIDENT WENT AFTER THE    
MAYOR OF SAN JUAN ON TWITTER    

140
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,470
OVER THE WEEKEND ACCUSING HER OF
POOR LEADERSHIP.                

141
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,574
THAT WAS AFTER THE MAJOR SAID   
THE ISLAND NEEDED MORE HELP FROM

142
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,744
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.         
BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS OF THE     

143
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,146
WHITE HOUSE NOW.                
PUERTO RICO TOMORROW.           

144
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,281
>> YES.                         
HE'S GOING EARLY TOMORROW       

145
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,619
MORNING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME ON
THE GROUND AS HE CAN THERE.     

146
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:52,490
THE PRESIDENT WAS CRITICAL OF   
CARMEN CRUZ, THE MAYOR OF       

147
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,961
SAN JUAN IN A SERIES OF TWEETS  
OVER THE WEEKEND.               

148
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:03,501
THE LATEST SAID WE'VE DONE A    
REMARKABLE JOB IN THE SITUATION 

149
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,836
IN PUERTO RICO.                 
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO RECOGNIZE

150
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,806
THE AMAZING WORK DONE BY FEMA   
AND MILITARY.                   

151
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,675
ALL BUILDINGS INSPECTED TO      
SAFETY.                         

152
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,211
THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO
RICO AND ALL OF THOSE WORKING SO

153
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,413
CLOSELY WITH THE FIRST          
RESPONDERS.                     

154
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:19,250
FANTASTIC JOB.                  
YOU MENTIONED THAT CARMEN CRUZ  

155
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,786
SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS  
TO DO MORE.                     

156
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:27,592
FRIDAY MORNING SHE WAS CRITICAL 
OF ELAINE DUKE, THE ACTING DHS  

157
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:33,999
SECRETARY.                      
SHE SAID THERE WAS A GOOD NEWS  

158
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,500
STORY TO THE FACT THAT THE      
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS BEGINNING

159
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,601
TO GET SUPPLIES IN THE HARDEST  
HIT AREAS.                      

160
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,170
IT'S NOT A GOOD NEWS STORY.     
IT'S A PEOPLE DYING STORY.      

161
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,575
I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS  
BEYOND THAT THOUGH, BECAUSE THIS

162
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,445
CLEARLY GOES DEEPER, WHAT ELSE  
THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN TO HAVE   

163
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,581
THE PRESIDENT RESPOND TO HER IN 
A CRITICAL FASHION.             

164
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:54,586
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.  
>> THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY       

165
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,224
SHARPLY CRITICAL OF MAYOR CRUZ. 
OTHER THAN HER COMMENTS ON      

166
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,293
FRIDAY MORNING WHICH SHE        
CRITICIZED ELAINE DUKE FOR      

167
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:08,600
SAYING THIS WAS A GOOD NEWS     
STORY FOR DHS GETTING SUPPLIES  

168
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,403
TO AREAS THAT WAS NEEDED, WHAT  
WAS SHE DOING THAT PROMPTED     

169
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,039
CRITICISM?                      
>> OUR FOCUS IS TO BRING THE    

170
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,308
MAYOR IN THE COORDINATION       
EFFORTS.                        

171
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,411
THIS ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS  
OTHER MEMBERS ON THE GROUND HAVE

172
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:24,082
REACHED OUT TO HER.             
WE HOPE SHE WILL JOIN WITH US.  

173
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,919
>> SO THERE'S CLEARLY A DEEPER  
STORY THERE.                    

174
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,023
IT SORT OF REVOLVES AROUND THE  
IDEA THAT SHE THOUGHT THE       

175
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:37,696
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE    
GOING TO HER.                   

176
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,900
FEMA HAS RESPONDED BY PUTTING A 
LIAISON RIGHT WITH HER LITERALLY

177
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,971
AT HER SHOULDERS, SHEP.         
WE'LL SEE TOMORROW WHEN THE     

178
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:50,508
PRESIDENT GOES THERE IF IT IS   
CONTENTIOUS.                    

179
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,243
>> Shepard: AND THE PRESIDENT   
ALSO TWEETED ABOUT NORTH KOREA. 

180
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,612
>> HE DID.                      
THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO REX     

181
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,215
TILLERSON SAYING THERE WERE     
DIRECT ONE-ON-ONE COMMUNICATIONS

182
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,151
GOING ON BETWEEN THE UNITED     
STATES AND NORTH KOREA.         

183
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,321
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO SLAP THE
SECRETARY STATE BACK SAYING REX 

184
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,990
TILLERSON DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME 
WITH THAT.                      

185
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,193
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WAS ASKED
ABOUT THAT AT THE BRIEFING THIS 

186
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:13,665
AFTERNOON.                      
HERE'S HOW SHE RESPONDED.       

187
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,200
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
TALKING AND PUTTING DIPLOMATIC  

188
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,267
PRESSURE.                       
WE STILL STRONGLY SUPPORT       

189
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,437
PUTTING DIPLOMATIC PRESSURE ON  
NORTH KOREA, WHICH WE'RE        

190
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,508
CONTINUING TO DO.               
NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO HAVE     

191
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,978
CONVERSATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. 
WE'VE ENCOURAGED ALL OF OUR     

192
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,648
ALLIES AND PARTNERS TO DO MORE. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP ALL OPTIONS 

193
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,084
ON THE TABLE.                   
>> THAT'S THE VIEWPOINT FROM THE

194
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,786
WHITE HOUSE.                    
THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT KIM     

195
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,223
JONG-UN HAS BACKED UP ENOUGH TO 
WARRANT DIRECT TALKS WITH NORTH 

196
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,558
KOREA.                          
THEY WANT TO SEE HIM COME TO    

197
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:46,631
THEM TO SAY OKAY, I'M WILLING TO
DEAL, SHEP.                     

198
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,066
>> Shepard: THANKS, JOHN.       
COMPLETE COVERAGE THIS HOUR OF  

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,936
THE SHOOTING IN LAS VEGAS.      
AHEAD WE'LL GO LIVE TO THE      

200
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,006
LAS VEGAS STRIP WITH NEW DETAILS
ON THE GUNMAN, HIS BACKGROUND   

201
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:59,377
AND THE VICTIMS OF THIS HORRIBLE
AMERICAN TRAGEDY.               

202
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,553
♪♪                              

203
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,457
If you have moderate to severe  
Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's,  

204
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,961
and your symptoms have left you 
with the same view,             

205
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,813
it may be time for a different  
perspective.                    

206
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:28,132
If other treatments haven't     
worked well enough,             

207
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,968
ask your doctor about ENTYVIO,  

208
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,970
the only biologic developed     
and approved                    

209
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,972
just for UC and Crohn's.        

210
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:36,641
ENTYVIO works by focusing right 
in the GI-tract                 

211
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,643
to help control damaging        
inflammation                    

212
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:41,329
and is clinically proven to     
begin helping many patients     

213
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:44,315
achieve both symptom relief as  
well as remission.              

214
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,317
Infusion and serious allergic   
reactions                       

215
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,319
can happen during or after      
treatment.                      

216
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:50,338
ENTYVIO may increase risk of    
infection,                      

217
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:51,656
which can be serious.           

218
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,158
While not reported with ENTYVIO,
PML, a rare,                    

219
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:57,161
serious brain infection caused  
by a virus may be possible.     

220
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,997
Tell your doctor if you have    
an infection,                   

221
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,331
experience frequent infections, 

222
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,333
or have flu-like symptoms,      
or sores.                       

223
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,502
Liver problems can occur        
with ENTYVIO.                   

224
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,605
If your UC or Crohn's medication
isn't working for you,          

225
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,108
ask your gastroenterologist     
about ENTYVIO.                  

226
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,977
ENTYVIO. Relief and remission   
within reach.                   

227
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,246
                    It's OK     

228
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,714
                that everybody  
                ignores me      
                when I drive.   

229
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,650
      It's fine, 'cause I get   
      a Safe Driving Bonus Check

230
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,151
              every six months  
              I'm accident-free.

231
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,587
           And I don't share it 
           with Mom. Right, Mom?

232
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,621
                     Right.     

233
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,989
  <i> Safe Driving Bonus Checks,</i>   

234
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,157
      <i> only from Allstate.</i>      

235
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,692
     <i> Switching to Allstate</i>     
         <i> is worth it.</i>          

236
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,702
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS FIREWORKS.  
THEN IT JUST DIDN'T STOP.       

237
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,472
AND I'M LIKE DEBBY, THAT'S NOT  
FIREWORKS.                      

238
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,875
PEOPLE STARTED RUNNING.         
WE ASKED WHAT WAS GOING ON.     

239
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,547
THEY SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTER.  
WE REALIZED IT SOUNDED LIKE     

240
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,084
MACHINE GUNS.                   
>> Shepard: A SURVIVOR OF THE   

241
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,287
DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING OUR     
NATION HAS SEEN.                

242
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:03,261
THE SHOOTER LIVED IN A          
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY ON A       

243
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,629
CULDESAC WITH A WIPE DESCRIBED  
AS HIS GIRLFRIEND.              

244
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,499
POLICE SAY SHE'S BEEN LOCATED   
OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND IS NOT   

245
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,236
HIS ACCOMPLICE.                 
BEFORE LIVING IN MESQUITE,      

246
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,207
NEVADA, HE LIVED FOR EIGHT YEARS
IN MESQUITE, TEXAS.             

247
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,811
AUTHORITIES IN BOTH TOWNS SAID  
THEY NEVER HAD ANY CONTACT WITH 

248
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,279
HIM.                            
THERE WAS LAWSUIT AGAINST       

249
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:25,817
ANOTHER CASINO IN LAS VEGAS.    
IT WAS LATER DISMISSED WITH     

250
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,785
PREJUDICE.                      
SOMETHING ABOUT SAFETY          

251
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,988
VIOLATIONS.                     
AND THERE WAS A TRAFFIC TICKET  

252
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:36,260
IN 2010.                        
NOTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN FIND.  

253
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,762
THOUGH HIS FATHER WAS ONCE A    
BANK ROBBER AND ON THE FBI'S    

254
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,598

255
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:45,269
SAY LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS FROM

256
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,673
WOUNDED.                        
THE LAPD SAID TODAY THAT AN     

257
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,443
OFF-DUTY OFFICER WAS SHOT IN THE
LEG AND EXPECTED TO RECOVER.    

258
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:56,147
L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF OFFICIALS   
SAY TWO OFF DUTY DEPARTMENT     

259
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,316

ONE CRITICAL.                   

260
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,552
THE OTHER STABLE.               
ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA

AUTHORITIES SAY ONE OFF DUTY    
SHERIFF DEPUTIES, TWO WIVES

00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,464
DUTY OFFICER WAS WOUNDED AND    
EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.            

264
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,101
POLICE IN ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA

INJURIES.                       
THAT BUT A HANDFUL OF THE MORE  

267
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:29,714
THAN 515 VICTIMS LAST NIGHT.    
TRACE GALLAGHER IS LIVE IN      

268
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,151
LAS VEGAS FOR US THIS AFTERNOON.
TRACE?                          

269
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:41,959
>> SHEP, IT'S VITAL TO GIVE YOU 
A PERSPECTIVE ON HOW VAST THIS  

270
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,061
CRIME SCENE WAS AND HOW IT WENT 
DOWN.                           

271
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,164
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WINDOWS
ON THE 32nd FLOOR.              

272
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:51,736
IT'S TWO ROOMS THAT THE SHOOTER 
BUILT FLAT FORMS ON TOP SO HE   

273
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,672
CAN GET A BETTER ANGLE SHOOTING 
DOWN.                           

274
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,075
IT'S DECEIVING.                 
THE WINDOW ON THE RIGHT IS ABOUT

275
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:01,946
A 45 DEGREE DIFFERENCE, WHICH IS
WAY INVESTIGATORS SAY HE WAS SO 

276
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,250
EFFECTIVELY ABLE TO SHOOT DOWN  
AT VARIOUS PARTS AT THE CROWD.  

277
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,920
YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE STAGE      
ACROSS THE STREET.              

278
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:14,358
THE 22,000 WERE IN FRONT OF THAT
STAGE AND BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND

279
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,027
THE STAGE, WE'RE ABOUT 300 YARDS
BEHIND.                         

280
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,097
IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE, ALL THE  
WAY ACROSS WHEN THE STAMPEDE    

281
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,700
STARTED, SHEP, YOU HAVE A       
LIBRARY OF SHOES AND HANDBAGS   

282
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,837
AND BOTTLES AND NOW LOOK AT     
THIS.                           

283
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:30,675
THIS GAIT WAS IN CONCRETE.      
THE CROWD PUSHED THEIR WAY      

284
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,610
THROUGH THIS.                   
AS YOU WIND YOUR WAY OVER HERE, 

285
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:36,080
THEY PUSHED THEIR WAY ACROSS THE
STREET TO THIS BUILDING HERE.   

286
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,749
YOU CAN HEAR THE GUYS PULLING   
THE WINDOW OUT.                 

287
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,687
SOME OF THE VICTIMS WENT IN     
THERE AND BROKE THIS WINDOW     

288
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,889
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO USE THAT 
AS SHELTER.                     

289
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,491
THERE'S A LINE OF BLOOD DOWN    
THERE.                          

290
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,126
THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE BACK     
SIDE.                           

291
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,529
YOU CAN SEE THE TAIL SECTION OF 
AN AREA PLANE.                  

292
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:56,100
THIS IS THE BACK SIDE OF        
McCARRAN AIRPORT, THIS IS WHERE 

293
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,636
IT ENDED.                       
THIS WAS ANOTHER FENCE THAT WAS 

294
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,539
PUSHED DOWN AND PEOPLE WERE     
MAKING THEIR WAY ON TO THE      

295
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:08,746
GROUNDS OF McCARRAN AIRPORT.    
LISTEN TO A FEW MORE OF THE     

296
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,381
WITNESSES.                      
>> IT WAS PRETTY MUCH LIKE A WAR

297
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:15,987
SCENE INSIDE.                   
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF STUFF WITH   

298
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:21,292
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.            
IT WAS HARD TO SEE.             

299
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,627
THE BODIES WERE CARRIED         
PROBABLY 1/2 MILE FROM THE      

300
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,895
INCIDENT.                       
I PROBABLY PRONOUNCED 15 TO 20  

301
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,031
PEOPLE INSIDE.                  
IT'S A VERY SAD DAY.            

302
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,534
>> WE RAN.                      
EVERYBODY IS HIDING EVERYWHERE. 

303
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,171
THEY'RE HIDING UNDER THE        
BLEACHERS AND THE STANCHIONS AND

304
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,174
EVERYWHERE THEY COULD.          
EVERYBODY IS TELLING TO US RUN, 

305
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,244
RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.         
>> RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN.      

306
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,215
WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT INSIDE 
THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL BECAUSE  

307
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,185
OF THE GUN FIRE, THE SMOKE, THE 
ALARMS WENT OFF.                

308
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:54,392
THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT    
POLICE HONED IN ON THE AREA SO  

309
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,795
QUICKLY.                        
>> Shepard: TRACE WHAT DO WE    

310
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,466
KNOW ABOUT THE GUNNMAN HIMSELF? 
>> YOU HEARD SOUND FROM STEPHEN 

311
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,635
PADDOCK'S FAMILY.               
THEY SAID THEY NEVER EXPECTED   

312
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,103
THIS AND THEY THINK HE MIGHT    
HAVE SNAPPED.                   

313
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,906
THIS IS NOT THE CASE OF A MAN   
THAT SNAPPED.                   

314
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,009
THIS WAS METICULOUSLY AND       
METHODICALLY PLANNED.           

315
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,780
THE MANDALAY BAY, AS YOU KNOW,  
NOBODY HAS BETTER SECURITY THAN 

316
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,149
CASINOS IN VEGAS.               
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.             

317
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,719
THEY'LL GO THROUGH THE LAST FOUR
DAYS OF VIDEO AND TRY TO PUT    

318
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:27,258
TOGETHER A TIMELINE OF EXACTLY  
HOW STEPHEN PADDOCK GOT THOSE   

319
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,293
GUNS, 10, 11, MAYBE MORE INSIDE 
THE HOTEL.                      

320
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,295
HOW HE HID THEM TO GET THEM     
INSIDE.                         

321
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,199
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING THAT. 
THEN YOU GO BACK TO HIS HOUSE IN

322
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,101
MESQUITE, TEXAS.                
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.    

323
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,605
HE OWNED SOME GUNS.             
HE WAS A HUNTER, A PRIVATE      

324
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,808
PILOT.                          
THEY SAY THERE'S NO CONNECTION  

325
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,511
AT ALL TO TERRORISM, SHEP.      
>> Shepard: TRACE, TELL US MORE 

326
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,014
ABOUT THE WOMAN LIVING WITH HIM 
DESCRIBED AS A GIRLFRIEND.      

327
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,217
>> YEAH, VERY QUICKLY.          
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THAT    

328
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:59,090
LIVED TOGETHER AS BOYFRIEND OR  
GIRLFRIEND OR AS ROOMMATES.     

329
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,025
THE REASON HER NAME CAME UP IS  
BECAUSE HER DEBIT CARD WAS      

330
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,261
INSIDE THE HOTEL ROOM AT THE    
MANDALAY BAY.                   

331
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,564
WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOT THERE. 
RIGHT NOW SHE'S OUT OF THE      

332
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,032
COUNTRY.                        
HE'S NOT CONSIDERED AS BEING    

333
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,968
PART OF THE SHOOTING.           
BUT THEY STILL WANT TO TALK TO  

334
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,305
HER BECAUSE SHE MAY HAVE VITAL  
INFORMATION ON HOW THIS         

335
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,906
HAPPENED, SHEP.                 
>> Shepard: TRACE GALLAGHER IN  

336
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,774
LAS VEGAS.                      
THANK YOU.                      

337
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,543
SOME FAMILIES ARE STILL WAITING 
FOR WORD ON THEIR LOVED ONES    

338
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:23,414
THAT WERE AT THE CONCERT.       
WE'LL HEAD TO NEVADA'S ONLY     

339
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,983
LEVEL ONE TRAUMA CENTER FOR A   
LIVE UPDATE.                    

340
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,588
THAT'S STILL TO COME ON FOX NEWS
CHANNEL.                        

341
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:31,422
Is that whole thing             
still dragging on?              

342
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,424
            No, I took some pics
            with the app and... 

343
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,825
     filed a claim, but...      

344
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,827
 You know how they send you     
 money to cover repairs and...  

345
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,095
              They took forever 
              to pay you, right?

346
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,031
No, I got paid                  
right away, but...              

347
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,299
at the very end of              
it all, my agent...             

348
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,533
              Wouldn't even call
              you back, right?  

349
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,035
     No, she called to see      
        if I was happy.         

350
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,903
        But if I wasn't happy   
        with my claim experience

351
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,004
                 for any reason,

352
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:48,606
                  they'd give me
                  my money back,

353
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:49,874
             no questions asked.

354
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,375
           Can you believe that?

355
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,443
                   No.

>> Shepard: WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT
TWO OF THE VICTIMS IN LAS VEGAS.

386
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,388
FIRST, SONNY MELTON FROM BIG    
SANDY, TENNESSEE, WHICH IS WEST 

387
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:55,192
OF NASHVILLE.                   
RIGHT AROUND JACKSON, TENNESSEE.

388
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,497
FAMILY MEMBERS TOLD OUR STATION 
WZTV HE WAS AT THE CONCERT AND  

389
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,633
DIED PROTECTING HIS WIFE.       
SONNY MELTON WAS A REGISTERED   

390
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,636
NURSE THAT WORKED AT A HOSPITAL 
IN JACKSON.                     

391
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,605
ACCORDING TO HIS FACEBOOK       
PROFILE.                        

392
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:13,177
HIS WIFE SAID IN A STATEMENT, HE
SAVED MY LIFE AND LOST HIS.     

393
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,813
LAS VEGAS POLICE ALSO CONFIRM   
ONE OF THEIR OFFICERS DIED      

394
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:21,986
DURING THE SHOOTING.            
THEY SAY THE OFFICER WAS OFF    

395
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,053
DUTY AT THE TIME.               
NO NAME YET RELEASED.           

396
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,756
ONE WITNESS TO THE MASSACRE IN  
LAS VEGAS TELLS US THAT HE IS   

397
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:29,126
STILL IN ABSOLUTE SHOCK, AS HE  
PUTS IT.                        

398
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:35,332
HE SAYS HE AND HIS FIANCE WERE  
TRAPPED IN A V.I.P. TENT WHERE  

399
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,335
BULLETS WERE HITTING PEOPLE AND 
FIRST RESPONDERS THROWING THEIR 

400
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,438
BODIES ON PEOPLE TRYING TO      
PROTECT THEM.                   

401
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,576
RUSSELL BLECK IS ON THE PHONE.  
RUSSELL, WHAT DID YOU SEE AND   

402
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,111
EXPERIENCE?                     
>> HEY, SHEP.                   

403
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:54,451
WE WERE IN THE V.I.P. TENT TO   
THE RIGHT OF THE STAGE WHEN     

404
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,819
EVERYTHING HAPPENED.            
I HAVE VIDEO OF THE SHOOTING,   

405
00:25:55,954 --> 00:26:01,158
THE END OF THE CONCERT.         
WE HEARD TWO -- LIKE THREE ROUND

406
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:08,832
BURSTS AND SOUNDED LIKE A FIRE  
CRAMP OR AMP CRACKING.          

407
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:12,436
I SAID THAT SOUNDED LIKE AN     
AR-15.                          

408
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:16,974
AFTER THAT, WE JUST -- BULLETS  
STARTED RAINING DOWN            

409
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:27,217
RELENTLESSLY AND WOULDN'T STOP. 
>> WAS THERE ANY ONE IN YOUR    

410
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,619
IMMEDIATE AREA BECOME A VICTIM? 
>> A LADY IN FRONT OF ME.       

411
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,356
I SAW HER DROP TO THE SIDE.     
EVERYBODY DROPPED DOWN LIKE A   

412
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,424
FROG.                           
I DON'T KNOW --                 

413
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,694
>> Shepard: YOU'RE WATCHING     
PEOPLE AROUND YOU DROP AS YOU --

414
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:41,599
LIKE A WHAT?                    
>> YEAH, JUST DROPPING LIKE --  

415
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:46,403
LIKE YOU'RE GETTING IN A FROG   
STANCE, LIKE CROUCHING AND HIDE.

416
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:53,010
I SAW ONE LADY TURN SIDEWAYS AND
SPIN AND FELL AND WE TOOK OFF   

417
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:59,883
RUNNING.                        
TOOK COVER EVERY TIME THE       

418
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,385
SHOOTER WOULD RELOAD.           
THERE WAS A GAP THERE WHERE WE  

419
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,022
COULD GET TO COVER.             
AND THEN THE BULLETED STARTING  

420
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:08,459
RAINING OUT AGAIN AND WE WOULD  
JUMP BACK AND HIDE.             

421
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:13,864
AS WE HIT, WE COULD HEAR THE    
SOUNDS OF THE BULLETS COMING    

422
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,434
THROUGH THE TENT.               
I'M CRAWLING, GETTING HIT WITH  

423
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,472
JUST BULLETS RICOCHETTING OFF   
THE GROUND.                     

424
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,776
YOU CAN FEEL THE DIRT KICK UP AT
YOUR FACE.                      

425
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:44,662
THE AMOUNT OF CARNAGE           

426
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,070
                      IS CRAZY. 
>> ONE SECOND YOU'RE LISTENING  

427
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,405
TO JASON ALDEAN AND THE NEXT    
SECOND THIS IS HAPPENING.       

428
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,739
HOW WERE YOU PROCESSING IT?     
>> THERE WAS NO PROCESSING.     

429
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:56,840
IT WAS CRAZY.                   
THE SHOOTER WAS SO FAR AWAY.    

430
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,208
SO THE SOUND DIDN'T LIKE LIKE A 
NATURAL GUNSHOT AT FIRST.       

431
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,677
BUT THEN YOU SAW PEOPLE FALL TO 
THE GROUND LIKE HEAPS, JUST LEFT

432
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:00,711
AND RIGHT.                      
THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE      

433
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,945
SHOOTER WAS SPRAYING.           
YOU COULD SEE BULLETS COME      

434
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,017
TOWARDS WHERE YOU ARE AND THEN  
THEY MIGHT SKIP AWAY FROM YOU.  

435
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,386
NO METHOD BEHIND IT.            
YOU KEPT HEARING THE SHOTS OVER 

436
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,989
AND OVER AGAIN.                 
>> Shepard: YOU WERE THERE WITH 

437
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,758
YOUR FIANCE.                    
WHAT WERE THE TWO OF YOU DOING  

438
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:19,263
AND SAYING TO EACH OTHER?       
>> WELL, FIRST, WE GOT          

439
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,165
SEPARATED.                      
WHEN THE FIRST HAPPENED, I WAS  

440
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,701
GETTING A DRINK.                
I HAD JUST LEFT THE CORNER OF   

441
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,937
THE BAR AT THE END OF THE V.I.P.
TENT.                           

442
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,573
SHE WAS TOWARDS THE BACK.       
LUCKILY MY BEST FRIEND WAS      

443
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,575
THERE.                          
AS SOON AS THE SHOTS STARTED    

444
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:38,115
HAPPENING, REALIZED WASN'T A    
TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION.          

445
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:41,752
BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS PLAYING   
CITY.                           

446
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,322
EVEN JASON ALDEAN HAD NO IDEA   
WHAT HAPPENED.                  

447
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,358
LUCKILY I MANAGED TO FIND THEM  
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AFTER        

448
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:52,329
EVERYTHING STARTED.             
THEY WERE HIDING BEHIND THE BAR.

449
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,331
EVERYBODY WAS RUNNING TO THE    
MAIN EXIT.                      

450
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,968
JUST TURN AROUND AND COME BACK  
TOWARDS US.                     

451
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,304
SLOWLY MADE OUR WAY ACROSS THE  
BIG FIELD.                      

452
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:05,609
YOU CAN SEE BODIES AND PEOPLE   
SCREAMING AND YELLING FOR HELP. 

453
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:11,148
WHEELCHAIRS GETTING KNOCKED     
OVER.                           

454
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:12,182
YOU COULDN'T STOP TO HELP       
ANYBODY.                        

455
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,318
THE BULLETS WERE -- WE'RE       
TALKING HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OVER 

456
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:18,922
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.        
RAPID SUCCESSION.               

457
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,259
WOULD NOT STOP.                 
>> Shepard: WHERE DID YOU       

458
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,963
EVENTUALLY FEEL SAFE?           
>> MY HOUSE.                    

459
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,298
I LIVE TEN MINUTES FROM THE     
STRIP.                          

460
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:33,270
IT TOOK US ABOUT 15 MINUTES FROM
THE TIME IT STARTED TO SLOWLY   

461
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,206
MAKE OUR WAY.                   
ALL WHILE UNDER FIRE.
