        It's your eyes.         

345
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,518
  That's why there's Ocuvite,   

346
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:24,602
      from Bausch + Lomb.       

347
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,254
 As you age your eyes can lose  
        vital nutrients.        

348
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,590
 Ocuvite helps replenish those  
           nutrients.           

349
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,810
Ocuvite has Lutein, Zeaxanthin, 
          and Omega-3.          

350
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:35,446
 Nourish your eyes to help them 
     be their healthy best.

393
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,500
THE MAJOR HEADLINE THIS EVENING 
ABOUT ASPIRIN AND YOUR HEART.   

394
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,170
AND THEN, THE AIR SCARE TODAY.  
SMOKE SUDDENLY FILLING THE      

395
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,188
CABIN.                          
PASSENGERS HAVING TO ESCAPE.    

396
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,223
WE'LL BE BACK.  Crohn's disease.

397
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,159
 ...I was always searching for  
  ways to manage my symptoms.   

398
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,396
  I thought I had it covered.   

399
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,583
  Then I realized managing was  
        all I was doing.        

400
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,285
 When I finally told my doctor, 

401
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,120
 he said HUMIRA was for people  
            like me             

402
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,571
      who have tried other      
        medications,...         

403
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,839
    but still experience the    
            symptoms            

404
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,741
     of moderate to severe      
        Crohn's disease.        

405
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,626
      In clinical studies,      

406
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,243
    the majority of patients    
           on HUMIRA            

407
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,578
    saw significant symptom     
           relief...            

408
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,246
...and many achieved remission. 

409
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,716
HUMIRA can lower your ability to
      fight infections...       

410
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:09,934
   ...including tuberculosis.   

411
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,219
    Serious, sometimes fatal    
   infections and cancers,...   

412
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:14,188
    including lymphoma, have    
           happened;            

413
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:16,390
   as have blood, liver, and    
    nervous system problems,    

414
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,692
        serious allergic        
         reactions,...          

415
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:19,310
 ...and new or worsening heart  
            failure.            

416
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,729
  Before treatment, get tested  
            for TB.             

417
00:21:21,764 --> 00:21:23,397
Tell your doctor if you've been 
            to areas            

418
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,316
where certain fungal infections 
          are common,           

419
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,600
    and if you've had TB,...    

420
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,869
  ...hepatitis B, are prone to  
          infections,           

421
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:30,655
  ...or have flu-like symptoms  
           or sores.            

422
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,740
 Don't start HUMIRA if you have 
         an infection.          

423
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,709
 If you're still just managing  
         your symptoms,         

424
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:37,128
  ask your gastroenterologist   
         about HUMIRA.          

425
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,397
     With HUMIRA, remission     
          is possible.          

426
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,599
 <i> I take pictures of sunrises, </i> 

427
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,850
     <i> but with my back pain</i>     

428
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:44,385
        <i> I couldn't sleep</i>       
      <i> and get up in time.</i>      

429
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,020
     <i> Then I found Aleve PM.</i>    

430
00:21:46,022 --> 00:21:49,440
  <i> Aleve PM is the only one to</i>  
 <i> combine a safe sleep aid plus</i> 

431
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,492
   <i> the 12 hour pain relieving</i>  
       <i> strength of Aleve.</i>      

432
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:52,493
           <i> I'm back. </i>          

433
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:54,362
   <i> Aleve PM for a better AM.</i>   

434
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:59,583
 I CAN DO MORE TO LOWER MY A1C. 

435
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,353
   AND I CAN DO IT WITH         
   WHAT'S ALREADY WITHIN ME.    

436
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:05,222
   BECAUSE MY BODY CAN STILL    
   MAKE ITS OWN INSULIN.        

437
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,743
AND ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY       
ACTIVATES MY BODY TO RELEASE IT.

438
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:10,444
   TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.    

439
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,464
   IT COMES IN A ONCE-WEEKLY,   
   TRULY EASY-TO-USE PEN.       

440
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,551
IT WORKS 24/7, AND YOU DON'T    
HAVE TO SEE OR HANDLE A NEEDLE. 

441
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,621
   TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY   
   INJECTABLE MEDICINE          

442
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,557
  TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN     
  ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES   

443
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,893
       WHEN USED WITH           
       DIET AND EXERCISE.       

444
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,646
   IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST   
   MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES   

445
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,798
       OR FOR PEOPLE WITH       
       TYPE 1 DIABETES          

446
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,401
   OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.    

447
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,936
     DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY      
     IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL     

448
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,472
   OR FAMILY HISTORY OF         
   MEDULLARY THYROID CANCER,    

449
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,776
 IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE 
 NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2,     

450
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,078
     OR IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC      
     TO TRULICITY.              

451
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,031
    STOP TRULICITY AND CALL     
    YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY      

452
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,283
     IF YOU HAVE A LUMP OR      
     SWELLING IN YOUR NECK,     

453
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,035
      SEVERE STOMACH PAIN,      

454
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,955
  OR SYMPTOMS LIKE ITCHING,     
  RASH, OR TROUBLE BREATHING.   

455
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,708
    SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY    
    INCLUDE PANCREATITIS.       

456
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,544
    TAKING TRULICITY WITH A     
    SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN     

457
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,546
      INCREASES YOUR RISK       
      FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.      

458
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,716
  COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE   
  NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,   

459
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,968
      DECREASED APPETITE,       
      AND INDIGESTION.          

460
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,221
     SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN      
     LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,       

461
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,856
