[000:05:05;321] HOUSE IS DEFYING CONGRESSIONAL
[000:05:06;289] DEMANDS FOR ANSWERS ON WHETHER
[000:05:08;358] THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SECRETLY

[000:05:31;781] THEY NEED TO BE PRESERVED AND

[000:05:39;689] THIS CONVERSATION, THEY NEED TO
[000:05:40;623] BE TURNED OVER.
[000:05:41;657] >> IF, IN FACT, THERE ARE SUCH

[000:05:46;996] IS REFUSING TO ANSWER ANY
[000:05:47;530] QUESTIONS ON THIS WHATSOEVER.
[000:05:48;965] >> IS THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDING
[000:05:51;567] TO COOPERATE WITH THOSE REQUESTS
[000:05:53;636] AND FURNISH THAT INFORMATION AS
[000:05:54;704] REQUESTED IN WRITING?
[000:05:56;806] >> I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR LAST
[000:05:57;440] WEEK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
[000:05:58;341] NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT.
[000:05:59;409] >> DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE
[000:06:00;443] PRESIDENT WILL DENY THOSE
[000:06:00;977] REQUESTS?
[000:06:03;546] >> I SAID I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT

[000:06:24;100] AND ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF
[000:06:25;735] SESSIONS, A POTENTIALLY AWKWARD
[000:06:27;203] POSITION BECAUSE THE FBI
[000:06:29;272] DIRECTOR WOULD LEAD THE RUSSIA
[000:06:33;242] INVESTIGATION AND SESSIONS HAS
[000:06:33;943] RECUSED HIMSELF FROM ANYTHING TO
[000:06:34;577] DO WITH THAT.
[000:06:36;012] >> A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO THINK
[000:06:36;646] THAT BECAUSE HE RECUSED HIMSELF
[000:06:38;114] FROM THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION
[000:06:39;182] HE SHOULD NOT BE IN THAT
[000:06:40;216] POSITION.
[000:06:40;750] >> I THINK THIS IS A PROCESS
[000:06:41;751] THAT'S RUNNING COMPLETELY AS IT
[000:06:43;319] SHOULD.

[000:18:38;967] >> Reporter: THESE IMAGES, TAKEN
[000:18:39;601] BY A BYSTANDER, ARE RAISING
[000:18:40;169] QUESTIONS TONIGHT.
[000:18:42;070] 15-YEAR-OLD JAYSON NEGRON
[000:18:43;639] HANDCUFFED ON THE GROUND WITH
[000:18:46;041] HIS HEAD FACING TO HIS RIGHT.
[000:18:46;642] THE CAMERA PANS OFF AND FOUR
[000:18:47;843] SECONDS LATER, NEGRON'S HEAD IS
[000:18:48;844] IN A DIFFERENT POSITION.
[000:18:51;947] THE VICTIM'S FAMILY SAYS THE
[000:18:53;015] PICTURES SUGGEST NEGRON WAS
[000:18:54;583] STILL ALIVE AND THEY SAY THAT
[000:18:55;584] CONTRADICTS WHAT POLICE TOLD
[000:18:57;152] THEM, THAT NEGRON WAS KILLED
[000:18:57;753] WHEN HE WAS SHOT.
[000:18:59;755] ACCORDING TO BRIDGEPORT,
[000:19:00;789] CONNECTICUT, POLICE, THE OFFICER
[000:19:02;891] SHOT NEGRON AFTER HE REFUSED
[000:19:03;926] ORDERS TO STOP AND HIT THE
[000:19:06;595] OFFICER WITH A STOLEN CAR ON
[000:19:07;196] TUESDAY.
[000:19:08;597] >> THIS IS A YOUNG MAN, WHO PUT
[000:19:09;665] HIMSELF IN A REALLY BAD
[000:19:10;699] SITUATION AND LOST HIS LIFE.
[000:19:14;837] >> Reporter: THE 21-YEAR-OLD
[000:19:16;471] PASSENGER WAS ALSO SHOT, BUT
[000:19:18;507] SUFFERED NONLIFE-THREATENING
[000:19:19;541] INJURIES.
[000:19:21;109] THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS NEGRON'S
[000:19:22;678] BODY WAS LYING IN THE STREET FOR
[000:19:23;712] ABOUT SIX HOURS AFTER THE
[000:19:24;746] SHOOTING FOR EVIDENCE-GATHERING
[000:19:26;849] REASONS, BUT NEGRON'S FAMILY
[000:19:31;386] MEMBERS SAY THAT POLICE NEVER
[000:19:32;554] PROVIDED HIM MEDICAL ATTENTION
[000:19:33;188] THAT THEY BELIEVE MIGHT HAVE
[000:19:34;089] SAVED HIS LIFE.
[000:19:35;657] HUNDREDS GATHERED LAST WEEK TO
[000:19:36;692] PAY TRIBUTE TO THE TEEN AND
[000:19:37;292] CALL FOR ACTION.
[000:19:42;931] THAT OFFICER IS ON
[000:19:47;603] ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE PENDING THE
[000:19:48;503] OUTCOME OF AN INVESTIGATION.

[000:20:04;753] INVESTIGATORS ON THE SCENE.
[000:20:05;988] or dt
[000:20:08;156] and diarrhea.
[000:20:09;358] I tried lifestyle changes
[000:20:11;026] and over-the-counter treatments,
[000:20:12;160] but my symptoms keep
[000:20:12;160] coming back.
[000:20:14;296] It turns out I have
[000:20:15;530] Irritable Bowel Syndrome
[000:20:15;530] with Diarrhea,
[000:20:17;532] or IBS-D.
[000:20:18;533] A condition that's really
[000:20:18;533] frustrating.
[000:20:20;769] That's why I talked to my
[000:20:20;769] doctor about VIBERZI...
[000:20:23;338] ...a different way
[000:20:23;338] to treat IBS-D.
[000:20:25;474] VIBERZI is a
[000:20:25;474] prescription medication
[000:20:27;276] you take every day
[000:20:28;911] that helps proactively manage
[000:20:29;878] both abdominal pain and
[000:20:31;013] diarrhea at the same time.
[000:20:33;181] So I can stay ahead of
[000:20:33;181] my symptoms.
[000:20:34;883] VIBERZI can cause new or
[000:20:34;883] worsening abdominal pain.
[000:20:37;352] Do not take VIBERZI
[000:20:37;352] if you have no gallbladder,
[000:20:39;888] have pancreas or
[000:20:39;888] severe liver problems,
[000:20:41;924] problems with alcohol abuse,
[000:20:43;358] long-lasting or
[000:20:43;358] severe constipation,
[000:20:45;460] or a bowel or
[000:20:45;460] gallbladder blockage.
[000:20:47;462] Pancreatitis may occur
[000:20:48;530] and can lead to
[000:20:48;530] hospitalization and death.
[000:20:50;933] If you are taking VIBERZI,
[000:20:52;167] you should not take medicines
[000:20:52;167] that cause constipation.
[000:20:54;603] The most common side effects of
[000:20:54;603] VIBERZI include constipation,
[000:20:57;572] nausea, and abdominal pain.
[000:20:59;708] Stay ahead of IBS-D
[000:20:59;708] with VIBERZI.

[000:21:05;414] military for 18 years.rian,
[000:21:07;549] But, I smoked and
[000:21:07;549] I got heart disease.
[000:21:10;285] My tip is;
[000:21:11;453] it's hard to
[000:21:11;453] serve your country
[000:21:12;754] when you're to weak
[000:21:12;754] to put on your uniform.
[000:21:14;823] (Announcer) You can quit.

[000:21:20;629] the drawing board...
[000:21:22;030] And the cutting board.
[000:21:23;165] We removed the added nitrates
[000:21:23;165] and nitrites,
[000:21:24;900] by-products,
[000:21:25;968] and artificial preservatives
[000:21:25;968] in all of our meat.
[000:21:28;670] Every. Single. One.
[000:21:30;739] Why? For the love of hot dogs.
[000:21:35;811] when they thought they should
[000:21:35;811] Westart saving for retirement.le
[000:21:38;747] Then we asked some older people
[000:21:40;048] when they actually
[000:21:40;048] did start saving.
[000:21:43;151] This gap between when
[000:21:43;151] we should start saving
[000:21:45;620] and when we actually
[000:21:45;620] do is one of the reasons
[000:21:47;990] why too many of us aren't
[000:21:47;990] prepared for retirement.
[000:21:51;126] Just start as early as you can.
[000:21:53;095] It's going to pay
[000:21:53;095] off in the future.
[000:21:54;563] If we all start saving
[000:21:54;563] a little more today,
[000:21:57;065] we'll all be better
[000:21:57;065] prepared tomorrow.

[000:22:39;841] using smart traps to capture

[000:22:43;412] DNA to fight disease.
[000:22:45;814] There are over 100 million
[000:22:47;382] pieces of DNA in every sample.
[000:22:50;419] With the Microsoft Cloud,
[000:22:51;720] we can analyze the data
[000:22:53;321] faster than ever before.
[000:22:55;424] If we can detect new viruses
[000:22:56;992] before they spread,
[000:22:58;026] we may someday prevent outbreaks
[000:23:00;162] before they begin.

[000:26:06;881] Bburning of diabetic nerve pain
[000:26:08;617] these feet...
[000:26:09;484] kicked off a lot of high school
[000:26:09;484] games...
[000:26:11;620] ...built a life for my family...
[000:26:13;388] ...and liked to help others
[000:26:13;388] in need.
[000:26:15;190] But I couldn't bear my diabetic
[000:26:15;190] nerve pain any longer.
[000:26:17;826] So I talked to my doctor
[000:26:19;160] and he prescribed LYRICA.
[000:26:20;729] Nerve damage from diabetes
[000:26:22;230] causes diabetic nerve pain.
[000:26:23;865] LYRICA is FDA approved
[000:26:25;367] to treat this pain.
[000:26:26;501] LYRICA may cause serious
[000:26:26;501] allergic reactions
[000:26:28;503] or suicidal thoughts
[000:26:28;503] or actions.
[000:26:30;205] Tell your doctor right away
[000:26:31;473] if you have these,
[000:26:32;240] new or worsening depression,
[000:26:33;441] or unusual changes in mood
[000:26:33;441] or behavior.
[000:26:35;844] Or swelling, trouble breathing,
[000:26:37;412] rash, hives, blisters, muscle
[000:26:37;412] pain with fever,
[000:26:39;948] tired feeling or blurry vision.
[000:26:41;750] Common side effects are
[000:26:41;750] dizziness, sleepiness,
[000:26:43;918] weight gain and swelling
[000:26:43;918] of hands, legs, and feet.
[000:26:46;154] Don't drink alcohol while
[000:26:46;154] taking LYRICA.
[000:26:48;323] Don't drive or use machinery
[000:26:49;691] until you know how LYRICA
[000:26:49;691] affects you.
[000:26:51;726] Those who have had a drug or
[000:26:51;726] alcohol problem
[000:26:53;528] may be more likely
[000:26:53;528] to misuse LYRICA.
[000:26:55;363] Now I have less diabetic
[000:26:55;363] nerve pain.
[000:26:57;465] And it's great to help others
[000:26:57;465] get back on their feet.
[000:26:59;668] Ask your doctor about
[000:26:59;668] LYRICA.
[000:27:01;569] If you're eligible,
[000:27:02;637] you could pay as little as $25
[000:27:02;637] dollars a month.
