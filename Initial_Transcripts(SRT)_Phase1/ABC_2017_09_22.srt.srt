YOU SEE THAT SWARM OF RESCUERS. 

120
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,352
WHICH IS A SIGN THAT THIS COULD 
TURN FROM A RESCUE OPERATION TO 

121
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,022
A RECOVERY OPERATION.           
FOR DAYS WE HAVE BEEN ASKING

SAME SENATOR WHO KILLED THE

HE SAYS A "BILL OF THIS IMPACT  

139
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,816
REQUIRES A BIPARTISAN APPROACH."
MCCAIN MIGHT HAVE JUST KILLED   

140
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,384
THIS NEW REPEAL, BECAUSE THEY   
CAN ONLY AFFORD TO LOSE TWO     

141
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:11,022
VOTES.                          
RAND PAUL HAS ALREADY SAID NO.  

142
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,658
AND MCCAIN DID THIS, EVEN THOUGH
HIS OWN BEST FRIEND IN THE

00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,194
SENATE, LINDSEY GRAHAM IS ONE OF

THEIR OWN HEALTH COVERAGE, BUT  
WITH FAR LESS FEDERAL FUNDING.  

148
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,810
AND WITH NO GUARANTEE OF HOW    
THEY WOULD COVER AMERICANS WITH 

149
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,447
PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS.        
EXPERTS SAY IT COULD LEAVE

MILLIONS MORE WITHOUT INSURANCE.

JUST AN INDEFINITE HOLD ON THIS 

160
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:23,562
JUST CREATES MORE CHAOS AND     
CONFUSION.
