THE AIR.

197
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
IT IS TERRIFYING.

198
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000

HAVE SHIVERS UP YOUR SPINE.

201
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
THE ODDEST THING IS SEEING

202
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THINGS ACTUALLY FLOATING IN THE

203
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AIR.
NOT BLOWING ONE DIRECTION OR

204
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
ANOTHER.
LOOK UP AND ONE CLOUD HEADING

205
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
ONE DIRECTION AND ANOTHER ARE

206
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
CLOUD HEADING THE OTHER.

207
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
IT IS SURREAL.

208
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
IT IS SURREAL.

209
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
>> YOU MENTIONED THE HEAVILY

210
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
POPULATED AREAS.

211
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
WE SAID THIS ON FOX REPORT LAST

212
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
NIGHT.
KANSAS CITY, OKLAHOMA CITY.

213
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
UNTIL YOU SEE IT, IT REALLY

214
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
DOESN'T SEEM REAL TO YOU AND

215
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
HAVING LIVED IN KANSAS CITY FOR

216
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
MANY YEARS AND I HAVE SEEN THE

217
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
TORNADOIC SYSTEMS MOVE ACROSS

218
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
THE PLAINS, YOU CAN PICK THEM

219
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
UP AND WATCH THEM MOVE INTO

220
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
YOUR TOWN.
WHEN YOU SEE THIS, IT RARELY

221
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
HITS THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE

222
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
TALL BUILDINGS AND SO MANY

223
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
STRUCTURES.

224
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
YOU MENTIONED THE UNIVERSITY

225
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THERE, CHRISTIAN HOW ARE

226
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
PEOPLE DEALING WITH THE

227
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
WARNINGS THERE?

228
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
ARE THEY HEEDING SIRENS?

229
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
>> I WISH I COULD SAY THAT THEY

230
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WERE.
THAT IS THE WEIRD THING IS WE

231
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
ARE USED TO SEEING IT ON THE TV

232
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
AND NO BIG DEAL FOR WHERE WE

233
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
ARE, WE KNOW IT IS WAY OUT

234
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
THERE.

235
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WHEN IT DOES COME TO OUR AREA,

236
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
YOU JUST GET IN THE CAR AND YOU

237
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT.

238
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I HOPE PEOPLE ARE BEING

239
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
RESPONSIBLE BUT DRIVING AROUND

240
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
IT IS HARD.

241
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
PEOPLE ARE SPEEDING.

242
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I RAN ACROSS SOMEBODY WHO

243
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
WASN'T LOOKING WHERE THEY WERE

244
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
GOING AND THERE WAS A TERRIBLE

245
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WRECK.
I MEAN THERE IS GOING TO BE

246
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
OTHER INJURIES AND ACCIDENTS

247
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF TORNADO

248
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
BUT NOT THE TORNADO ITSELF AND

249
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING

250
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
TOO.

251
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000

344
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS COMING

345
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000

>> SURE.

348
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
AND, OF COURSE, THE REASON I

349
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
ASK THAT AND MANY OF OUR

350
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
VIEWERS WILL KNOW BECAUSE WE

351
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000

352
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
WE SAW ANOTHER SYSTEM DROP

356
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
TWISTERS OVER GRANBURY TEXAS

357
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
THAT WAS HIT SO HARD, SIX

358
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
PEOPLE DEAD THERE.

359
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
AND IT HAPPENED AS THE SUN WAS

360
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
SETTING.
I ASK THAT QUESTION ABOUT

361
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
DAYLIGHT.

362
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
IT IS MORE FRIGHTENING AT NIGHT

363
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
TO PUT THE EMERGENCY PLANS INTO

364
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
PLACE BECAUSE PEOPLE TEND TO

365
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
KIND OF SLACK OFF ON THAT.

366
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.

367
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I WAS HOPING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS

368
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
MAY HAVE HELPED PEOPLE STAY

369
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
SAFE TODAY.

370
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
>> IT DOES HELP.

371
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
YOU CAN SEE IT COMING AND IN

372
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
THE SKY.

373
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OKLAHOMANS ARE USED TO GET OUT

374
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
AND WATCH IT IS COMING

375
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
SOMETIMES.
YOU COULD SEE HE IT COMING AND

376
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000

TO THE EAST OF OKLAHOMA.

1103
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
>> CASEY CASEY CAN YOU HEAR

1104
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
ME.

1105
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
IN YOUR LINE IS BREAKING UP A

1106
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
LITTLE BIT.
I WANT TO CLEAR THIS UP BECAUSE

1107
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I THINK PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

1108
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
YOU ARE AND I WANT TO GIVE THE

1112
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
LINE A CHANCE TO CLEAR UP

1113
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A MOVING

1114
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
VEHICLE AND SOMETIMES AS YOU

1115
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000

1116
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
A STRONGER TOWER TO HOOK UP TO

1117
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
SO I WANT TO GIVE IT A FEW

1118
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
SECONDS TO DO THAT.

1119
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
GOING NORTH ARE ON INTERSTATE

1120
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000

TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT

1125
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
YOU ARE SEEING?
>> WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES OR SO

1126
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
SOUTH OF NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.

1127
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
AN AREA THAT IS STILL UNDER A

1128
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
TORNADO WATCH RIGHT NOW.

1129
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
CONFIRMED REPORTS OF TORNADOES

1130
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
ON THE GROUND IN THE NORMAN,

1131
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
OKLAHOMA AREA.

1132
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
WHICH, BY THE WAY TO A LOT OF

1133
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
PEOPLE THAT KNOW THIS, NORMAN

1134
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

1135
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
OKLAHOMA A UNIVERSITY OF MORE

1136
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THAN 30,000 STUDENTS AND THE

1137
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN

1138
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
FACT EVEN HAS AN OFFICE IN

1139
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
NORMAN.
I SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE

1140
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THERE NOT VERY LONG AGO AND

1141
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
THEY HE SAID THAT THEY WERE

1142
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
STARTING TO SEE SOME CLIMATIC

1143
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
ACTIVITY LITERALLY OUT OF THE

1144
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
BACK OF THEIR OFFICE DOOR.

1145
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
THAT IS PART OF THAT CELL AS I

1146
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
MENTIONED THAT IS ACTUALLY

1147
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY

1148
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT THESE TWO

1149
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
MAJOR CELLS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

1150
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
RADAR THAT ARE SPAWNING THE

1151
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
TORNADOES.

1152
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
NORTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY AND

1153
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
THEN SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA

1154
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
CITY.

1155
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
AND RIGHT NOW ALL EYES ARE ON

1156
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
THE AREA AS JANICE DEAN WAS

1157
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
SAYING PINK, OKLAHOMA, THAT IS

1158
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
SOUTHEAST OF NORMAN.

1159
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SO WE HAVE THESE TWO GUIDANCE

1160
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
TICK CELLS.

1161
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
IN FACT SOME OF THE EARLY

1162
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
REPORTS FROM THE WEATHER

1163
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
SPOTTERS ON THE GROUND IS THAT

1164
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA ALONE

1165
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
14 DIFFERENT TORNADOES HAVE

1166
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
BEEN GENERATED IN THE LAST FOUR

1167
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
HOURS OR SO.

1168
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

1169
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
FORECASTERS HAD TALKED ABOUT

1170
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

1171
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I CAN TELL YOU WE WERE DOWN IN

1172
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
NORTH TEXAS ON THE GROUND LAST

1173
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
WEEK RIGHT AFTER THOSE STORMS

1174
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
BLEW THROUGH AND DECIMATED SOME

1175
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
PART TION OF TEXAS.

1176
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,000
EVER SINCE THE SYSTEM MOVE
THROUGH IT HAS BEEN AN EERY

1177
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
HUMID UNNATURAL FEELING THE

1178
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
LAST FEW DAYS.

1179
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
IT IS NOT NORMALLY HUMID IN

1180
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
NORTH TEXAS AND THE SOUTHERN

1181
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
PART OF OKLAHOMA.

1182
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
THE AIR JUST KIND OF FELT

1183
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WEIRD.

1184
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
IT WAS MUGGY AND STIFLING.

1185
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN TO A

1186
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
LOT OF THE FORECASTERS AND

1187
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
METEOROLOGISTS BECAUSE AS

1188
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
JANICE DEAN WAS SAYING EARLIER

1189
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
THIS HAS REALLY SORT OF BEEN

1190
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WEATHER

1191
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
THAT SETS UP FOR THE SUPERCELLS

1192
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
AND CELLS THAT PRODUCE THE

1193
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
TORNADOES.

1194
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
AT THIS POINT WE ARE SAFE.
I MEAN WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES AS

1195
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I SAID SOUTH OF NORMAN AND IT

1196
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
IS SUNNY.

1197
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
THAT IS THE WEIRD THING ABOUT

1198
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THIS AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

1199
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
THE VIDEO HE OF THE BLUE SKY

1200
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
THERE OUT TO THE DISTANCE IN

1201
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
OKLAHOMA CITY.

1202
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
SHE ARE ARE SO SPORADIC AND SO

1203
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
ISOLATED WITH TORNADOES.

1204
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
SO DIFFERENT THAN A HURRICANE.

1205
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THE HURRICANE IS WIDESPREAD FOR

1206
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
MILES AND MILES AND MILES AND

1207
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
MILES YOU ARE HAVING THE STRONG

1208
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
WINDS AND THE POURINGTHE

1209
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
DOWNPOURS IN THE RAIN.

1210
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
WITH THE TORNADOES IT CAN BE

1211
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
SUNNY IN ONE AREA AND TEN MILES

1212
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
TO THE EAST OF YOU TORNADOES ON

1213
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
THE GROUND DOING LOTS AND LOTS

1214
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
OF DAMAGE.

1215
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY ALARMING

1216
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
WITH THESE.
EVEN THOUGH FORECASTERS WERE

1217
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
PREDICTING THIS, THESE DROP

1218
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
DOWN OUT OF THE SKY.

1219
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
THEY ARE ON THE GROUND FOR A

1220
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
FEW MINUTES.

1221
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
DO A TON OF DAMAGE AND THEN

1222
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
ASCEND BACK UP INTO THE CLOUDS

1223
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING

1224
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
THROUGHOUT THE PORTIONS OF

1225
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
OKLAHOMA THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER

1226
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
THE GUN THE LAST FOUR HOURS OR

1227
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
SO HARRIS.

1228
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000

IN THE SKY AND IT IS REALLY

1261
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM COMING

1262
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
SOMETIMES BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

1263
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000

BUT WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IT

1283
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
