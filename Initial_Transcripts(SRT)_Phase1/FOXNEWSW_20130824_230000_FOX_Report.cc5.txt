[000:02:00;670] TO ESCAPE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE
[000:02:02;572] THAT THEIR COUNTRY HAS BECOME.

[000:02:55;892] THAT REQUIRES POSIINGING OUR
[000:02:58;161] FORCES.
[000:02:58;728] WE KNOW A FOURTH WARM SHIP ARMED
[000:03:01;464] WITH BALLISTIC MISSILES HAS BEEN
[000:03:06;169] IS NOT TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.
[000:03:10;807] AND THE CHIEF IS THERE TO URGE
[000:03:13;276] THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW
[000:03:16;079] UNITED NATION'S EXPERTS TO LOOK
[000:03:19;148] AT CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACKS.

[000:03:24;187] WERE KILLED AND SOME HAVE THE
[000:03:26;189] NUMBER MUCH HIGHER AND IF
[000:03:28;892] CONFIRMED IT WOULD BE THE
[000:03:32;028] WOFRSOUS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:03:35;598] SINCE SADDAM HUSSEIN GASSED
[000:03:38;835] CURDS.
[000:03:39;168] THE CIVIL WAR AND ESTIMATES PUT
[000:03:42;805] IT AT MORE THAN 100,000.
[000:03:46;075] A YEARING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:03:48;077] SAID CHEMICAL WEAPON USED IN
[000:03:51;247] SYRIA WOULD BE CROSSING A RED
[000:03:53;483] LINE.
[000:03:54;317] >> PRESIDENT CONFERRED WITH
[000:03:55;752] ANOTHER WORLD LEADER ON SYRIA.

[000:04:33;856] REPORTERS THAT THE DEFENSE
[000:04:35;058] DEPARTMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY
[000:04:36;592] TO PROVIDE THE PRESIDENT WITH
[000:04:38;728] OPTIONS FOR ALL CONTINGENCY AND
[000:04:41;397] THAT REQUIRES POSITIONING OUR
[000:04:45;535] FORCES AND ASSETS TO BE ABLE FOR
[000:04:48;671] THE PRESIDENT TO CHOOSE.
[000:04:50;373] AND HARRIS, THE U.S. HAS FOUR
[000:04:53;142] WAR SHIPS IN THE REGION, HARRIS.
[000:04:56;913] >> IT IS AWFULLY DIFFICULT WHEN
[000:04:58;781] WE ARE NOT BEGIN INFORMATION OR
[000:05:01;184] NOTES TO KNOW WHETHER AND THIS
[000:05:02;618] IS A QUESTION, DOES THIS MEAN
[000:05:05;188] MILITARY ACTIONS MORE OR LESS
[000:05:07;023] LIKELY AT THIS POINT?
[000:05:07;724] >> IT CERTAINLY GIVES PRESIDENT
[000:05:10;460] OBAMA MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ORDER
[000:05:11;928] AIR STRIKES OR MISSILE ATTACKS
[000:05:14;130] IF HE DECIDES TO DO.
[000:05:16;165] THAT ONE FORMER UN AMBASSADOR
[000:05:20;236] SAID PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO
[000:05:21;371] DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES WITH SYRIA
[000:05:23;973] AND ITS GOVERNMENT AND STOCK
[000:05:25;108] POIL OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:05:28;177] >> THE PRESIDENT SAID HIMSELF
[000:05:29;779] A YEAR AGO THAT THE USE OF
[000:05:32;348] CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD CROSS
[000:05:33;750] A REDLINE AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:35;618] OF THE UNITED STATES MAKES
[000:05:36;586] A STATEMENT LIKE THAT, HE NEEDS
[000:05:38;388] TO BE PREPARED TO DO MANAGE
[000:05:41;190] DRAMATIC IF THE REDLINE IS
[000:05:43;693] CROSSED.
[000:05:44;060] OTHERWISE HIS CREDIBILITY IS
[000:05:45;595] GRAVELY DAMAGED AND THAT'S WHERE
[000:05:46;963] WE ARE AT THE MOMENT.
[000:05:48;831] >> BUT BOLTON BELIEVES THAT THE
[000:05:52;135] ADMINISTRATION WILL TRY TO
[000:05:53;803] INDICT THE SYRIAN REGIME IN THE
[000:05:56;072] INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.
[000:05:57;240] >> MOLLY, ON THE STORY ON WHICH

[000:06:08;117] AND JACK KING WILL JOIN US.
[000:06:10;620] MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE WHAT
[000:06:12;188] WE LEARNED FROM MOLLY.
[000:06:15;725] WHAT IS A SERIOUS RESPONSE
[000:06:17;560] LIKELY TO LOOK LIKE?
[000:06:20;163] .
[000:06:21;264] WELL, IT HAS BEEN CALLED ONE OF
[000:06:22;698] THE MOST IMPORTANT DAYS IN
[000:06:24;400] AMERICAN HISTORY.
[000:06:25;268] TODAY IN WASHINGTON, PEOPLE

[000:06:36;779] A DAY SHY OF HIS SPEECH.
[000:06:39;749] >> THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR
[000:06:43;786] A NOSTOLLINGIC COMMEMORATION OR
[000:06:47;557] SELF CONGRATULATORY CELEBRATION,
[000:06:49;559] THE TASK IS NOT DONE.
[000:06:51;994] THE JOURNEY IS NOT COMPLETE.
[000:06:55;398] WE CAN AND WE MUST DO MORE.
[000:06:58;668] >> TODAY'S EVENT CONCLUDING WITH
[000:07:01;204] A HALF MILE WALK FROM THE

[000:07:13;049] NATION'S CAPITOL.
[000:07:14;484] YOUR COMMENTS ON THE ROUTE.
[000:07:16;152] >> IT WAS SPECTACULAR HARRIS.
[000:07:19;122] IT WAS AIDED FROM MOTHER NATURE.
[000:07:21;324] IT IS NOT EVERY DAY IN LATE
[000:07:23;860] AUGUST SHE TURNS OUT A SUN
[000:07:26;662] DRENCHED LOW HUMIDITY AND COOL
[000:07:28;097] COINED OF DAY.
[000:07:29;265] THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TODAY.
[000:07:32;235] THE LATE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING
[000:07:33;936] WOULD BE PROUD OF THE SPIRIT OF
[000:07:36;606] NONVIOLENCE AND GENERALIZED GOOD
[000:07:39;742] WILL.
[000:07:40;343] FOR ME THE MOST POWERFUL MOMENTS
[000:07:42;778] CAME NOT FROM THE PODIUM BUT
[000:07:44;881] FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
[000:07:46;282] SOME OF WHOM WERE HERE TO WATCH
[000:07:48;584] THAT SPEECH IN KNOWN 63, AND
[000:07:51;721] LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT AND MANY
[000:07:53;556] OTHERS WHO WATCHED IT ON
[000:07:55;391] TELEVISION AND STILL OTHERS WHO
[000:07:57;793] LIVE IN THE SEGGATED SOUTH LIKE
[000:08:00;429] THE BROTHERS WHO GREW UP IN
[000:08:03;766] MOBILE, OBAMA.
[000:08:05;368] >> IT WAS ROUGH.
[000:08:06;636] SEGREGATION WAS ALIVE AND WELL.
[000:08:08;771] AND IT WAS HARD FOR BLACK PEOPLE
[000:08:11;874] TO STICK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE
[000:08:15;011] THINGS, BECAUSE OF THE
[000:08:16;312] VIOLATION.
[000:08:16;712] THE BOMBING IN BIRMINGHAM AND
[000:08:19;882] MEG AREAS AND ALL OF THE THINGS
[000:08:22;251] WERE GOING ON AND SO YOUR
[000:08:24;887] PARENTS WERE RELUCTANT TO HAVE
[000:08:27;890] YOU PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY
[000:08:28;691] KNEW THE CONSEQUENCES.
[000:08:30;026] >> THERE IS A LOT OF WORK IN
[000:08:32;662] PROGRESS AND UP TO US AS THE
[000:08:34;530] BABY BOMERS AND TO PASS ON TO MY
[000:08:40;636] GREAT NEPHEWS AND BEING PART OF
[000:08:43;973] THE MOVEMENT AND ACTION AND TO
[000:08:46;909] VOLUNTEER AND HELP YOUR
[000:08:50;179] FELLOWMAN.
[000:08:50;880] >> WE FOUND ONE MARCHER WHO IS
[000:08:53;349] 94 YEARS OLD AND MARCHED IN THE
[000:08:56;152] 1963 EVENT.
[000:08:57;687] HE HAD THE SAME SIGN HE CARRIED
[000:08:59;689] IN KNOWN 63 AND HERE HE WAS
[000:09:02;525] IMPARTING ADVICE IN A FEISTY WAY
[000:09:04;493] TO THE YOUNG FOLKS AROUND HIM.
[000:09:07;930] >> THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT I
[000:09:10;233] THINK, IT IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE
[000:09:12;768] THINK?
[000:09:13;102] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT
[000:09:15;771] IT?
[000:09:16;072] ANSWER ME, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
[000:09:18;741] DO APPROXIMATE IT?
[000:09:19;742] >> HE TOLD US THAT HE WAS
[000:09:21;444] A TRUCK DRIVER AND HAD A ROUTE
[000:09:24;113] FROM NEW YORK TO WASHINGTON AND
[000:09:26;315] RAN HOME AND TOCK A BATH AND
[000:09:29;652] CAME DOWN TO THE MARCH.
[000:09:31;420] WHAT A MAN.
[000:09:32;255] >> YOU DESCRIBED A FAMILY
[000:09:35;825] ATMOSPHERE, SIMILAR OR
[000:09:37;226] CONTRASTING TO THE ORIGINAL
[000:09:38;361] MARCH?
[000:09:38;694] >> I THINK IT WAS A HUGE
[000:09:42;365] CONTRAST TO THE ORIGINAL MARCH.
[000:09:44;500] WASHINGTON ON THAT PARTICULAR
[000:09:45;668] DAY WAS A TENSE CITY.
[000:09:46;869] I GREW UP HERE AND I WAS NINE
[000:09:49;171] YEARS OLD ON THAT DAY AND
[000:09:51;007] WASHINGTON WAS A SEGREGATED
[000:09:53;142] TOWN.
[000:09:53;476] I CAN REMEMBER TALKING TO MY
[000:09:55;578] FRIENDS WERE THERE GOING TO BE
[000:09:57;146] RIOTS AND PEOPLE COMING TO THE
[000:09:58;881] NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE ADULTS WERE
[000:10:01;550] AFRAID.
[000:10:01;917] IT WAS A REFLECTION OF WHAT THE
[000:10:04;387] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS DOING.
[000:10:06;822] THE POLICE FORCE WAS ON FULL
[000:10:09;225] ALERT AND ALL HANDS ON DECK AND
[000:10:11;827] NATIONAL GUARD WAS CALLED OUGHT
[000:10:15;164] AND FBI DIRECTOR HOOVER HAD
[000:10:20;303] INFILM TRAITED THE MOVEMENT AND
[000:10:24;307] FOUND COMMUNISM ACTIVITY AND
[000:10:27;310] KENNEDY REFUSED TO MEET WITH
[000:10:30;980] THEM BECAUSE OF A FEAR OF
[000:10:33;282] IMPOSING ON HIM.
[000:10:34;250] AND ONE OUT AND THE REST IS
[000:10:36;652] HISTORY, HARRIS.
[000:10:37;953] >> FOR OUR VOWERS.
[000:10:39;955] YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB
[000:10:41;957] SHOWING YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND

[000:10:48;464] MEMORIES ON THE CHANNEL TODAY.

[000:11:01;143] A CITY ROUGHLY 150 MILE PER HOUR
[000:11:03;279] AND WHY THESE FLAMES COULD
[000:11:04;847] AFFECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

[000:11:24;133] AND ONE PERSON SAID HE COULD
[000:11:26;168] MAKE THE LEGAL TROUBLES FOR
[000:11:29;004] FILNER A LOT WORSE.
[000:11:30;840] STAY CLOSE.

[000:11:31;073] THE SAME THINGS YOU DO.
[000:11:45;588] IT'S WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT HER.
[000:11:47;323] BUT YOUR ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION -
