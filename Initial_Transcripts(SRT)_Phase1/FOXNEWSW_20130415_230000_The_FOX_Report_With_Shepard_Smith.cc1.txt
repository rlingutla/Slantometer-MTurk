[000:00:23;04] A WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN  
[000:00:23;27] SAYS THE EXPLOSIONS IN  
[000:00:25;13] BOSTON ARE QUOTE:  CLEARLY  
[000:00:26;26] AN ACT OF TERROR.  
[000:00:28;07] NOW, FROM THAT SAME  
[000:00:30;26] SPOKESMAN TO LEARN WHETHER  
[000:00:31;28] THE PERPETRATORS ARE  
[000:00:33;03] DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN AND  
[000:00:34;02] WHETHER THOSE PERPETRATORS  
[000:00:35;18] ARE MEMBERS OF A TERRORIST  
[000:00:37;15] ORGANIZATION.  
[000:00:38;26] TO THOSE QUESTIONS AT THIS  
[000:00:39;27] MOMENT WE HAVE NO ANSWERS.  
[000:00:41;21] RIGHT NOW AWAITING ANOTHER  
[000:00:42;25] BRIEFING FROM OFFICIALS IN  
[000:00:44;04] BOSTON WITH THE LATEST  
[000:00:45;16] INFORMATION.  
[000:00:46;02] IT'S SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT

[000:00:47;12] WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE WHEN  
[000:00:48;12] IT DOES.  
[000:00:49;05] HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT

[000:00:50;26] AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE ARE  
[000:00:53;08] CONFIRMED DEAD, 70 HURT  
[000:00:56;23] AFTER TWO BOMBS EXPLODED AT  
[000:00:58;16] THE FINISH LINE OF THE  
[000:00:59;19] BOSTON MARATHON.  
[000:01:00;18] ONE WITNESS SAYS HE WATCHED  
[000:01:02;08] A TRASH CAN EXPLODE.  
[000:01:03;28] HERE IS VIDEO OF THE FIRST  
[000:01:05;01] WOMAN AND AND -- BOMB AND  
[000:01:08;09] MOMENTS OF CHAOS THAT  
[000:01:10;17] FOLLOWED.  
[000:01:13;08] [EXPLOSION]  
[000:01:13;25] SCREAMING]  
[000:01:23;16] [EXPLOSION]  
[000:01:33;27] >> Shepard: AND ANOTHER  
[000:01:34;19] CAMERA CAPTURED THE SCENE  
[000:01:35;21] MOMENTS RIGHT AFTER THE  
[000:01:37;02] FIRST BLAST ALONG WITH THE  
[000:01:38;18] SECOND EXPLOSION.  
[000:01:40;10] BOTH BLASTS CAME JUST  
[000:01:42;01] BEFORE 3:00 BOSTON TIME.  
[000:01:44;10] THE LAST RUNNERS FINISHED  
[000:01:46;07] TIME IN THE MARATHON IS  
[000:01:47;07] LISTED OFFICIALLY AT  
[000:01:49;14] 2:57 P.M.  
[000:01:49;29] THEN THE SECOND ONE WENT  
[000:01:51;09] OFF, JUST DOWN THE STREET  
[000:01:52;08] FROM THE FIRST ONE.  
[000:01:53;01] POLICE SAY ABOUT 100 YARDS  
[000:01:55;01] AWAY.  
[000:01:55;14] IT DETONATED APPROXIMATELY  
[000:01:57;28] 12 TO 14 SECONDS AFTER THE  
[000:02:00;05] FIRST.  
[000:02:00;18] PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE SAY  
[000:02:01;13] THEY HAD NO IDEA EXACTLY  
[000:02:02;29] WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  
[000:02:05;17] >> WE WERE COMING DOWN  
[000:02:10;06] BOYLSTON STREET AND  
[000:02:11;10] LITERALLY I HEARD A CANNON  
[000:02:12;12] GO OFF.  
[000:02:12;27] I SAW A WHOLE BUNCH OF  
[000:02:14;16] SMOKE.  
[000:02:14;29] IT KNOCKED ME TO THE  
[000:02:16;02] GROUND, AND THEN, YOU KNOW,  
[000:02:17;10] EVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING.  
[000:02:18;05] >> ALL OF A SUDDEN  
[000:02:20;08] EVERYONE, ALL THE RUNNERS  
[000:02:21;05] STARTED SAYING RUN.  
[000:02:22;09] AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN  
[000:02:23;19] PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AT US.  
[000:02:25;23] >> YOU START LOOKING AT ALL  
[000:02:27;13] THE INJURIES AND YOU SEE  
[000:02:28;23] PEOPLE COMING OUT WITH NO  
[000:02:30;16] LEGS.  
[000:02:31;00] PEOPLE WERE NO ARMS.  
[000:02:35;23] PEOPLE, FACES AND BODIES  
[000:02:37;05] COVERED IN BLOOD.  
[000:02:38;25] >> Shepard: A SOURCE TELLS  
[000:02:39;18] FOX NEWS THAT INVESTIGATORS  
[000:02:40;12] IN BOSTON ARE NOW GUARDING  
[000:02:42;18] A MAN THEY HAVE CALLED A  
[000:02:44;04] PERSON OF INTEREST.  
[000:02:45;24] GUARDING THIS PERSON AT A  
[000:02:47;22] HOSPITAL.  
[000:02:48;07] WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONE.  
[000:02:49;09] WE'RE TOLD THAT PERSON HAS  
[000:02:51;20] SEVERE BURNS BUT  
[000:02:52;11] INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY  
[000:02:53;19] CANNOT DETERMINE WITH  
[000:02:54;21] CERTAINTY WHETHER HE WAS A  
[000:02:55;25] VICTIM OR AN ATTACKER.  
[000:02:57;23] AGAIN, AT THIS MOMENT, A  
[000:02:58;25] PERSON OF INTEREST IN A  
[000:03:00;07] HOSPITAL.  
[000:03:01;05] AND POLICE SAY NOBODY HAS  
[000:03:03;13] BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A  
[000:03:04;12] SUSPECT.  
[000:03:05;09] IN THE LAST HOUR, PRESIDENT  
[000:03:07;12] OBAMA SAID THE COUNTRY WILL  
[000:03:08;18] FIND OUT WHO DID THIS.  
[000:03:11;05] AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.  
[000:03:12;22] HERE IS ANOTHER ANGLE OF  
[000:03:13;22] THE FIRST EXPLOSION.  
[000:03:15;27] CAN YOU SEE ONE RUN ARER  
[000:03:16;22] FALL AS THE SMOKE FILLED  
[000:03:17;20] INTO THE AIR.  
[000:03:18;16] BOSTON POLICE SAY THERE WAS  
[000:03:19;12] ALSO A FIRE AT JFK LIBRARY  
[000:03:23;12] IN THE DOOR CHESTER  
[000:03:25;14] NEIGHBORHOOD.  
[000:03:26;01] POLICE NOW SAY AS OF THIS  
[000:03:27;02] MOMENT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE  
[000:03:27;26] TO CONNECT IT TO THE  
[000:03:29;17] BOMBINGS.  
[000:03:30;02] THEY THINK IT WAS A FIRE,  
[000:03:31;25] UNRELATED.  
[000:03:32;10] THEY ARE STILL  
[000:03:33;18] INVESTIGATING.  
[000:03:34;05] NOBODY WAS HURT THAT -- IN  
[000:03:36;20] THAT FIRE.  
[000:03:37;21] TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP OF  
[000:03:39;17] THE AREA NOW SO YOU CAN GET  
[000:03:41;00] A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED.  
[000:03:42;01] THE BLASTS 200 FEET APART.  
[000:03:44;15] TWIN EXPLOSIONS ON  
[000:03:45;23] PATRIOT'S DAY IN BOSTON  
[000:03:46;17] WHEN PEOPLE WERE RUNNING  
[000:03:47;25] THE MARATHON, FAMILIES AND  
[000:03:49;15] FRIENDS CHEERING THEM ON.  
[000:03:50;27] THOUSANDS PACKING THE  
[000:03:51;19] STREETS ON A HOLIDAY THERE.  
[000:03:53;08] AND IN AN INSTANT  
[000:03:55;20] EVERYTHING CHANGED.  
[000:03:57;11] "THE FOX REPORT'S"  
[000:03:58;00] CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT  
[000:03:58;24] WAS ON AIR WITH US WHEN  
[000:03:59;21] THIS HAPPENED AND HAS THE  
[000:04:00;23] LATEST INFORMATION FROM OUR  
[000:04:02;06] NEWSROOM.  
[000:04:02;21] JONATHAN?  
[000:04:03;06] >> SHEP, FIRST THE TIMING  
[000:04:04;26] OF THIS.  
[000:04:05;20] THE LAST RUNNERS ACTUALLY  
[000:04:09;17] WERE RECORDED CROSSING THE  
[000:04:12;04] FINISH LINE AT 2:57 EASTERN  
[000:04:14;11] TIME THAT GIVES YOU A  
[000:04:15;17] PRETTY ACCURATE PICTURE OF  
[000:04:16;21] EXACTLY WHEN THOSE TWO  
[000:04:18;20] EXPLOSIONS RIPPED THROUGH  
[000:04:19;19] THE SCENE.  
[000:04:21;25] ONE FIRST, THEN ANOTHER.  
[000:04:23;21] ABOUT 14 SECONDS APART BY  
[000:04:25;07] OUR COUNT AS WE LISTENED TO  
[000:04:26;18] THE EXPLOSIONS ON THE VIDEO  
[000:04:28;12] THAT YOU SAW.  
[000:04:29;12] NOW, IT APPEARS ACCORDING  
[000:04:30;28] TO ALL THE EXPERTS THAT  
[000:04:32;09] THEY WERE ON SOME SORT OF  
[000:04:33;24] TIMER DEVICE.  
[000:04:34;21] NOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN A  
[000:04:36;02] TIMER ATTACHED TO EACH OF  
[000:04:37;29] THOSE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES BUT  
[000:04:39;08] MORE LIKELY, ACCORDING TO  
[000:04:40;10] THE EXPERTS I SPOKEN TO  
[000:04:42;19] THEY WERE REMOTELY  
[000:04:44;20] DETONATED, POSSIBLY USING  
[000:04:45;15] CELL PHONES.  
[000:04:46;01] THAT IS WHY WE WERE TOLD AT  
[000:04:48;07] THE TIME THAT CELL PHONE  
[000:04:49;16] TRAFFIC HAD BEEN SHUTDOWN.  
[000:04:51;01] ALTHOUGH A COUPLE OF THE  
[000:04:52;08] CELL PHONE COMPANIES SAID  
[000:04:53;03] THAT THEY WERE NOT  
[000:04:54;13] REQUESTED TO DO SO.  
[000:04:55;04] BUT IT APPEARED TO A LOT OF  
[000:04:57;05] PEOPLE THAT CELL PHONES HAD  
[000:04:58;10] BEEN BLOCKED.  
[000:04:59;01] THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF  
[000:05:01;01] STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.  
[000:05:01;20] THESE WERE NOT HUGE DEVICES  
[000:05:04;03] IN THAT SENSE.  
[000:05:04;27] BUT THEY WERE CLEARLY ABLE  
[000:05:06;07] TO DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO  
[000:05:07;11] THE PEOPLE MANY OF THEM  
[000:05:08;29] GATHERED THERE.  
[000:05:09;19] THIS WAS THE FOUR HOUR MARK  
[000:05:11;00] OF THE MARATHON.  
[000:05:12;00] THAT'S A TYPICALLY BUSY  
[000:05:13;17] TIME AT THE FINISH LINE,  
[000:05:15;05] AND THERE WERE A LOT OF  
[000:05:16;10] PEOPLE STILL CROWDED AROUND  
[000:05:18;03] THE FINISH LINE.  
[000:05:19;11] SPECTATORS AND THOSE WHO  
[000:05:20;12] HAD ALREADY COMPLETED THE  
[000:05:21;08] RACE AND WERE SIMPLY  
[000:05:23;18] WAITING FOR FRIENDS OR  
[000:05:25;00] RELATIVES TO COME IN.  
[000:05:25;28] WE HAVE HAD SOME WORD THAT  
[000:05:28;23] THE BOMBS MAY HAVE BEEN  
[000:05:29;24] PACKED WITH BALL BEARINGS.  
[000:05:30;29] THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS  
[000:05:31;28] THAT DOES A GREAT DEAL OF  
[000:05:33;06] DAMAGE TO HUMAN FLESH.  
[000:05:34;09] THAT WOULD BE WHY WE ARE  
[000:05:35;14] HEARING THE REPORTS OF  
[000:05:37;13] HORRIFIC INJURIES,  
[000:05:38;21] INCLUDING MANY PEOPLE  
[000:05:39;26] LOSING THEIR LIMBS.  
[000:05:40;26] SO NOW THE INVESTIGATION  
[000:05:42;25] BEGINS.  
[000:05:43;09] THERE ARE THREE BASIC  
[000:05:44;15] QUESTIONS HERE.  
[000:05:45;14] WHO DID IT, HOW THEY DID  
[000:05:47;08] IT WHY THEY DID IT.  
[000:05:48;14] BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE,  
[000:05:50;02] SHEP, AS YOU LOOK AT THE  
[000:05:51;06] SCENE OF THE EXPLOSIONS  
[000:05:52;22] AGAIN IS TWO EXPLOSIONS,  
[000:05:54;27] TWO PEOPLE DEAD, MORE THAN  
[000:05:56;21] 100 WOUNDED.  
[000:05:57;26] AMONG THEM, CHILDREN WHO  
[000:05:59;10] HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEIR  
[000:06:01;02] PARENTS TO SEE A SUPPORTING  
[000:06:02;16] EVENT ON THIS HOLIDAY IN  
[000:06:04;05] BOSTON SHEP.  
[000:06:06;05] >> Shepard: JONATHAN WHDH  
[000:06:07;25] TELEVISION, CHANNEL 7, THE  
[000:06:08;22] NBC STATION IN BOSTON IS  
[000:06:10;10] REPORTING THAT AMONG THE  
[000:06:11;11] TWO CONFIRMED DEAD IS AN  
[000:06:14;20] 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL.  
[000:06:15;09] WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY  
[000:06:16;20] CONFIRM THIS AND WE HAVEN'T  
[000:06:17;29] LEARNED TOO MUCH ABOUT THE  
[000:06:19;21] REST OF THE VICTIMS.  
[000:06:21;03] >> YEAH.  
[000:06:21;21] WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY  
[000:06:22;28] CONFIRM THAT, SHEP.  
[000:06:23;22] WE HAD HEARD THAT REPORT.  
[000:06:25;11] WE ARE ALSO SEEING REPORTS  
[000:06:26;25] FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL  
[000:06:28;09] MEDIA THERE.  
[000:06:29;22] THAT THE CHILDREN'S  
[000:06:32;08] HOSPITAL IN BOSTON  
[000:06:33;21] CURRENTLY HAS SEVEN  
[000:06:34;28] PATIENTS IT IS TREATING  
[000:06:37;07] FROM THIS.  
[000:06:37;25] WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF  
[000:06:39;25] THEIR INJURIES.  
[000:06:40;13] THERE ARE REPORTS OF  
[000:06:41;03] CHILDREN AT SOME OF THE  
[000:06:42;27] OTHER HOSPITALS INVOLVED  
[000:06:44;09] HERE.  
[000:06:44;22] AS I SAY A TOTAL, WE ARE  
[000:06:45;15] TOLD, OF SOMETHING LIKE 105  
[000:06:48;02] PEOPLE TAKEN TO THE LOCAL  
[000:06:50;04] HOSPITALS AS A RESULT OF  
[000:06:51;14] THIS WHICH JUST SHOWS YOU  
[000:06:52;20] THE FORCE OF THOSE  
[000:06:54;13] EXPLOSIONS AND WHATEVER  
[000:06:55;20] SHRAPNEL THEY WERE PACKED  
[000:06:57;22] WITH RIPPING THROUGH  
[000:06:58;19] EVERYBODY WHO WAS CROWDED  
[000:06:59;27] IN THAT AREA AT THAT TIME.  
[000:07:02;25] SHEP?  
[000:07:03;08] >> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW  
[000:07:04;00] THAN, I MENTIONED AT THE  
[000:07:04;22] TOP OF THIS NEWSCAST WE ARE  
[000:07:05;16] WAITING FOR A BRIEFING FROM  
[000:07:06;11] OFFICIALS IN BOSTON.  
[000:07:07;20] AS YOU CAN SEE THAT'S THE  
[000:07:09;03] PODIUM WHERE THEY WILL BE  
[000:07:10;09] SPEAKING.  
[000:07:10;24] IT WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN  
[000:07:11;28] AT 7:00.  
[000:07:12;16] SO JUST ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES  
[000:07:13;29] AGO NOW.  
[000:07:14;19] AND WE ARE EXPECTING THAT  
[000:07:15;27] SHOULD BEGIN SHORTLY.  
[000:07:17;03] IN THE MEANTIME, JONATHAN,  
[000:07:21;07] THE OBVIOUS BECAME CLEAR  
[000:07:22;06] THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THESE  
[000:07:23;02] WERE SEPARATE EXPLOSIONS  
[000:07:24;08] WHEN WE KNEW THEY WERE  
[000:07:25;08] DEVICES THAT THIS WAS WHAT  
[000:07:27;15] AUTHORITIES IN THE WHITE  
[000:07:28;07] HOUSE IS NOW CALLING A  
[000:07:29;21] TERROR ATTACK.  
[000:07:30;23] THE QUESTION IS, WHO AND  
[000:07:33;09] WITH WHAT MOTIVE AS YOU  
[000:07:34;13] JUST SAID.  
[000:07:34;29] WE DON'T YET HAVE ANSWERS  
[000:07:36;14] TO ANY OF THAT.  
[000:07:38;02] BUT SPECULATION HAS BEEN  
[000:07:39;20] RAMPANT BUT NOTHING FIRM AT  
[000:07:40;14] ALL.  
[000:07:41;07] >> NO, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  
[000:07:42;10] FIRM WHATSOEVER.  
[000:07:43;09] AND THERE ARE THESE REPORTS  
[000:07:45;15] THAT A PERSON OF INTEREST  
[000:07:48;02] MAY BE BEING GUARDED BY THE  
[000:07:50;07] BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT IN  
[000:07:52;13] ONE OF THE HOSPITALS.  
[000:07:53;17] WE DO NOT HAVE INDEPENDENT  
[000:07:55;26] CONFIRMATION OF WHO THIS  
[000:07:56;27] PERSON MIGHT BE.  
[000:07:58;28] OR EVEN WHETHER IT IS A MAN  
[000:08:00;04] OR A WOMAN AT THIS POINT.  
[000:08:01;12] BUT, OBVIOUSLY THE  
[000:08:03;21] INVESTIGATION ALREADY IN  
[000:08:04;24] HIGH GEAR.  
[000:08:06;20] EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT  
[000:08:07;25] AGENCY INVOLVED RIGHT NOW.  
[000:08:09;20] THEY ARE LOOKING FOR  
[000:08:10;24] ANSWERS.  
[000:08:11;08] WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING  
[000:08:12;00] FIRST IS LOOKING AT THE  
[000:08:13;22] EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.  
[000:08:14;11] THEY WILL BE TAKING THEM  
[000:08:15;24] APART, SEEING HOW THEY WERE  
[000:08:17;24] PUT TOGETHER, WITH WHAT  
[000:08:18;25] MATERIALS THEY WERE PUT  
[000:08:20;10] TOGETHER.  
[000:08:20;27] THAT WILL GIVE  
[000:08:21;22] INVESTIGATORS A LOT OF  
[000:08:23;01] CLUES.  
[000:08:23;14] REMEMBER, WHEN THEY LOOK AT  
[000:08:24;08] THESE THINGS, THEY TEND TO  
[000:08:25;01] SEE WHAT THEY CALL A  
[000:08:26;25] SIGNATURE OF A BOMB MAKER.  
[000:08:28;02] THAT WILL LEAD THEM IN ONE  
[000:08:30;09] DIRECTION.  
[000:08:30;24] WE'LL FIND OUT IN GOOD  
[000:08:31;15] TIME SHEP.  
[000:08:32;21] >> Shepard: JONATHAN, THANK  
[000:08:33;15] YOU.  
[000:08:33;27] WE WILL BE BACK TO YOU AS  
[000:08:35;21] NEWS WARRANTS.  
[000:08:38;22] CATHERINE HERITAGE WORKS  
[000:08:39;25] INTELLIGENCE FOR US AND  
[000:08:40;22] LIVE IN OUR D.C. BUREAU.  
[000:08:42;07] IT'S MY STANDING THERE ARE  
[000:08:43;10] NO CREDIBLE CLAIMS OF  
[000:08:44;20] RESPONSIBILITY HERE.  
[000:08:45;11] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:08:46;13] WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH  
[000:08:47;21] VARIOUS GROUPS SHEP.  
[000:08:48;21] THEY MAKE IT THEIR BUSINESS  
[000:08:50;05] TO MONITOR THESE EXTREMIST  
[000:08:52;05] WEB SITES AND SO FAR THERE  
[000:08:53;06] HAS BEEN NO CLAIM OF  
[000:08:54;21] RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT'S  
[000:08:55;26] HAPPENED IN BOSTON.  
[000:08:57;05] JONATHAN, THOUGH, IS  
[000:08:58;04] TOUCHING ON AN IMPORTANT  
[000:08:58;26] POINT BECAUSE THE FORENSIC  
[000:09:01;03] INFORMATION, THIS BOSTON  
[000:09:01;26] MARATHON IS NOW A CRIME  
[000:09:03;18] SCENE.  
[000:09:04;01] AND I'M TOLD THE FBI  
[000:09:06;16] FOCUSES VERY MUCH ON TAKING  
[000:09:07;10] THE RESIDUE FROM THESE  
[000:09:09;00] DEVICES, IDENTIFYING THE  
[000:09:10;21] EXPLOSIVES, THEN FINDING  
[000:09:11;18] THE ORIGIN OF THOSE  
[000:09:13;06] EXPLOSIVES AND THEN LOOKING  
[000:09:14;13] FOR THAT BOMB MAKER'S  
[000:09:16;09] SIGNATURE.  
[000:09:16;24] EACH ONE OF THESE BOMB  
[000:09:18;08] MAKERS MAKES THESE DEVICES  
[000:09:19;06] IN A CERTAIN WAY.  
[000:09:20;04] THE TYPE OF DETONATOR.  
[000:09:21;29] AND THEN SPECIFICALLY  
[000:09:22;23] WHETHER THERE WAS SHRAPNEL.  
[000:09:24;14] A SHORT TIME AGO WE HEARD  
[000:09:26;07] FROM THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE  
[000:09:27;28] HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE  
[000:09:29;16] REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN MIKE  
[000:09:30;23] MCCALL WHO CONFIRMED THAT  
[000:09:32;01] HE IS GETTING REPORTS THAT  
[000:09:33;06] THE DEVICES CONTAINED BALL  
[000:09:35;28] BEARINGS, SO SHRAPNEL.  
[000:09:36;19] THAT IS A CRITICAL MARKER  
[000:09:37;27] HERE.  
[000:09:38;10] THE OTHER THING I WOULD  
[000:09:39;02] DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS  
[000:09:40;07] THE FACT THAT THE  
[000:09:43;04] EXPLOSIONS WERE NEARLY  
[000:09:44;22] SIMULTANEOUS AND ABOUT 50  
[000:09:46;06] TO 100 YARDS APART.  
[000:09:47;08] WHAT HAS THE INTENTION OF  
[000:09:48;17] AT LEAST ONE SOURCE WHO IS  
[000:09:50;23] FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION  
[000:09:51;17] IS THAT IT IS A STANDARD  
[000:09:53;03] PRACTICE TO HAVE THAT  
[000:09:55;27] INITIAL EXPLOSION WITH THE  
[000:09:57;15] IDEA THAT YOU WILL DRIVE  
[000:10:00;00] THE PUBLIC TOWARDS THE  
[000:10:03;02] SECONDARY SITE WHICH IS, IN  
[000:10:04;06] FACT, A LARGER DEVICE SO  
[000:10:08;09] THAT CAN MAXIMIZE THE  
[000:10:10;02] CASUALTIES IN AN EVENT LIKE  
[000:10:11;06] THIS.  
[000:10:11;19] THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE  
[000:10:12;11] DISCUSSING THIS AS AN ACT  
[000:10:14;22] OF TERRORISM FIRST  
[000:10:16;04] PRIVATELY AND NOW MORE  
[000:10:17;20] PUBLICLY WITH  
[000:10:18;08] ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.  
[000:10:19;07] A FINAL POINT WE JUST HAD  
[000:10:21;07] CONFIRMATION IN THE LAST  
[000:10:21;29] FEW MINUTES THAT THE FBI  
[000:10:24;08] AS WELL AS THE NCTC, THIS  
[000:10:26;18] IS THE NATIONAL COUNTER  
[000:10:28;01] TERRORISM CENTER, THIS IS  
[000:10:29;10] THE GROUP THAT WAS CREATED  
[000:10:31;01] AFTER 9/11 TO MONITOR  
[000:10:32;08] THREATS AGAINST THE UNITED  
[000:10:33;21] STATES WILL BE BRIEFING  
[000:10:35;17] MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE  
[000:10:36;25] INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AS  
[000:10:37;19] EARLY AS TOMORROW.  
[000:10:38;14] SO WHAT THAT TIMING TELLS  
[000:10:41;09] YOU, SHEP FROM MY  
[000:10:42;09] EXPERIENCE, IS THAT THIS  
[000:10:43;06] THING IS REALLY ON FIRE,  
[000:10:45;26] THIS IS A PRESSING ACTIVE  
[000:10:47;23] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:10:48;10] IF THEIR GONNA HAVE  
[000:10:49;05] HEARINGS ON THE HILL AS  
[000:10:50;06] EARLY AS TOMORROW MORNING  
[000:10:52;10] SHEP.  
[000:10:52;26] >> Shepard: CATHERINE, JUST  
[000:10:53;20] FOR CLARITY, IS IT PROPER  
[000:10:54;24] TO SAY THAT IN THE EARLY  
[000:10:56;00] GOING, FROM YOUR REPORTING  
[000:10:57;08] WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS  
[000:10:58;21] WAS SOME SORT OF TERRORIST  
[000:11:00;16] ORGANIZATION --  
[000:11:01;04] >> -- THAT'S CORRECT.  
[000:11:02;13] >> Shepard: WEATHER --  
[000:11:04;08] WHETHER IT WAS ONE PERSON  
[000:11:05;08] WITH A BEEF WITH A LOCAL  
[000:11:06;16] ISSUE IN BOSTON.  
[000:11:07;22] FRANKLY AT THIS MOMENT WE  
[000:11:08;15] KNOW THERE WAS AN ACT OF  
[000:11:09;17] TERROR BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK  
[000:11:10;20] IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY AND  
[000:11:12;03] THIS FITS THE DEFINITION  
[000:11:12;28] BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER  
[000:11:14;11] QUOTE TERRORISTS WERE  
[000:11:15;15] INVOLVED.  
[000:11:16;00] >> THE DEFINITION OF  
[000:11:17;04] TERRORISM IS AN ACT OF  
[000:11:18;22] VIOLENCE TO PROMOTE A  
[000:11:20;03] POLITICAL END.  
[000:11:20;26] WHAT IS NOT CLEAR IS THAT  
[000:11:23;03] IS IT AN INDIVIDUAL?  
[000:11:24;22] IS IT A SMALL CELL OF  
[000:11:27;10] INDIVIDUALS?  
[000:11:27;26] ARE THEY DOMESTIC?  
[000:11:29;01] OR IS THERE AN  
[000:11:30;19] INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT?  
[000:11:31;14] BUT WHEN YOU HAVE  
[000:11:33;07] SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS THEY  
[000:11:34;20] MEET THAT THRESHOLD  
[000:11:36;17] DEFINITION OF TERRORISM.  
[000:11:37;14] SO YOU ARE CORRECT.  
[000:11:41;08] >> Shepard: EARLIER,  
[000:11:41;28] CATHERINE, AS THIS WAS  
[000:11:42;27] BREAKING.  
[000:11:43;12] WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER  
[000:11:45;14] THERE HAD BEEN UNUSUAL  
[000:11:47;14] SIGNS OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS  
[000:11:48;27] ABOUT WHETHER THE BOSTON  
[000:11:50;07] MARATHON MIGHT BE A TARGET.  
[000:11:51;23] AT THE TIME, THE ANSWER WAS  
[000:11:53;04] NO, THERE HADN'T BEEN.  
[000:11:54;03] IS THAT STILL THE CASE?  
[000:11:55;10] >> THAT IS STILL THE CASE.  
[000:11:56;19] I HAVE SPOKEN TO A HALF  
[000:11:57;25] DOZEN PEOPLE SHEPARD WHO  
[000:11:59;16] WORK THIS ISSUE ON CAPITOL  
[000:12:00;20] HILL OR THEY ARE IN FEDERAL  
[000:12:02;16] LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE  
[000:12:06;01] SENSE I HAD FROM EVERY  
[000:12:07;08] CONVERSATION IS THAT THERE  
[000:12:08;17] WAS NOTHING SPECIFIC OR  
[000:12:10;14] CREDIBLE AT LEAST INITIALLY  
[000:12:11;11] THEY WERE SAYING TO ME THAT  
[000:12:12;24] THERE WAS A THREAT TO THE  
[000:12:13;29] BOSTON MARATHON.  
[000:12:14;22] HOWEVER, ONE OF THE THINGS  
[000:12:15;29] THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW  
[000:12:16;27] IS THEY ARE GOING BACK TO  
[000:12:18;15] THAT THREAD INFORMATION TO  
[000:12:19;10] SEE IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN  
[000:12:21;01] MISSED.  
[000:12:21;15] BUT, AGAIN, YOU HAVE THE  
[000:12:23;03] SENSE THAT PEOPLE WERE  
[000:12:24;15] SOMEWHAT BLINDSIDED BY WHAT  
[000:12:25;25] HAPPENED IN BOSTON TODAY  
[000:12:27;04] SHEPARD.  
[000:12:27;27] >> Shepard: ALL RIGHT,  
[000:12:29;00] CATHERINE.  
[000:12:29;15] WHEN YOU SAY BLINDSIDED,  
[000:12:33;09] SOMETIMES WHEN THEY ARE  
[000:12:36;08] BLINDSIDED, THAT COULD MEAN  
[000:12:37;24] THAT THIS ISN'T SOME BIG  
[000:12:40;04] GRAND -- THIS COULD BE A  
[000:12:41;13] COUPLE OF FOLKS OR A PERSON  
[000:12:43;17] WITH A BACKPACK OR TWO.  
[000:12:45;01] >> UM-HUH.  
[000:12:46;03] I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO  
[000:12:46;25] BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THIS  
[000:12:48;06] INFORMATION YET WHETHER WE  
[000:12:50;09] KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL OR  
[000:12:53;05] INDIVIDUAL'S ASSOCIATION.  
[000:12:53;29] BUT TO SPEAK MORE BROADLY  
[000:12:55;12] ONE WITH OF THE ISSUES THE  
[000:12:56;20] INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS  
[000:12:57;13] BEEN WRESTLING WITH,  
[000:12:58;21] ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST TWO  
[000:13:00;00] TO THREE YEARS IS THE  
[000:13:03;14] EMERGENCE OF WHAT THEY CALL  
[000:13:04;08] THE INDIVIDUAL ACTOR OR  
[000:13:05;15] SMALL CELLS.  
[000:13:06;28] THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS  
[000:13:08;16] THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO  
[000:13:10;24] INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONS.  
[000:13:11;24] THEY DON'T NECESSARILY USE  
[000:13:14;07] THE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF  
[000:13:15;02] TALKING TO EACH OTHER  
[000:13:16;09] WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO  
[000:13:18;12] INTERCEPT OR TO BLOCK THESES OF EVENTS
[000:13:20;06] IN THE  
[000:13:21;06] PAST.  
[000:13:21;19] SO, I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN  
[000:13:23;02] ONE ROAD AS TO A SPECIFIC  
[000:13:25;10] GROUP.  
[000:13:26;05] BUT THIS HAS BEEN SEEN AS  
[000:13:27;11] THE EMERGING THREAT.  
[000:13:28;21] THE INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL  
[000:13:30;15] CELL WHICH IS VERY HARD TO  
[000:13:32;22] INFILTRATE BY LAW  
[000:13:33;27] ENFORCEMENT.  
[000:13:34;13] IN THIS CASE THE FBI  
[000:13:36;23] SHEPARD.  
[000:13:37;07] >> Shepard: CATHERINE  
[000:13:37;28] HERRIDGE, OUR INTELLIGENCE  
[000:13:38;28] CORRESPONDENT LIVE IN  
[000:13:39;26] WASHINGTON.  
[000:13:40;12] WE WILL BE BACK TO HER AS  
[000:13:41;06] EVENTS WARRANT.  
[000:13:42;03] ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF  
[000:13:42;25] YOUR SCREEN THE WESTIN  
[000:13:44;08] HOTEL ADVERTISEMENT THERE  
[000:13:45;07] IS ACTUALLY THE SCENE OF A  
[000:13:47;08] NEWS CONFERENCE WHICH WILL  
[000:13:49;03] HAPPEN CLEARLY AT THE  
[000:13:50;07] WESTIN AT COPLY PLACE IN  
[000:13:53;18] BOSTON WHICH FRANKLY ISN'T  
[000:13:54;22] FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ALL  
[000:13:55;23] OF THIS HAPPENED.  
[000:13:56;17] AUTHORITIES WERE TO BRIEF  
[000:13:57;16] US 13 MINUTES AGO.  
[000:13:58;17] THAT'S BEEN DISPLAYED FOR A  
[000:13:59;19] FEW MINUTES.  
[000:14:00;10] ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WE  
[000:14:01;26] WILL TAKE YOU THERE WHEN IT  
[000:14:03;16] STARTS.  
[000:14:04;20] JOE DEFAZZIO WAS WORKING ON  
[000:14:06;08] COMMUNICATIONS AT THE RACE  
[000:14:07;13] AND WAS WORKING ON IT WHEN  
[000:14:08;20] THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED  
[000:14:09;23] THERE WAS ONE AS WE  
[000:14:11;10] REPORTED AND ANOTHER WHAT  
[000:14:12;19] APPEARED TO HIM TO BE THE  
[000:14:14;07] SAME INTENSITY.  
[000:14:15;13] SIR, IT'S NICE TO SPEAK  
[000:14:16;13] WITH YOU.  
[000:14:17;00] THANK YOU.  
[000:14:17;15] >> HI, SHEPARD, HOW ARE  
[000:14:18;29] YOU?  
[000:14:19;11] >> Shepard: I'M DOING  
[000:14:20;02] PRETTY WELL.  
[000:14:21;14] I'M CURIOUS THOUGH ABOUT  
[000:14:22;06] WHAT THAT SCENE WAS LIKE IN  
[000:14:24;06] THE SECONDS BETWEEN AND IN  
[000:14:25;11] THE SECONDS AFTER THE  
[000:14:27;20] SECOND.  
[000:14:28;04] >> OH, IT WAS JUST -- THIS  
[000:14:33;08] IS A UNIQUE BOSTON EVENT  
[000:14:35;22] MARATHON, RED SOX GAME UP  
[000:14:36;29] THE STREET.  
[000:14:37;20] AND WENT FROM A GREAT I DO  
[000:14:41;28] HORRIFIC DAY IN MOMENTS TO  
[000:14:42;22] BE HONEST WITH YOU.  
[000:14:48;21] I WAS 20 YARDS AWAY FROM  
[000:14:50;02] WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION  
[000:14:51;05] WENT OFF WAITING FOR  
[000:14:52;01] FRIENDS OF MINE.  
[000:14:53;06] LOOKING FOR THEM.  
[000:14:53;25] YOU HEARD THE FIRST  
[000:14:57;06] EXPLOSION.  
[000:14:57;21] IT SOUNDED LIKE A CANNON  
[000:14:58;15] WENT OFF.  
[000:14:59;05] I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,  
[000:15:01;25] BEING PATRIOT'S DAY I  
[000:15:03;25] THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE FIRED  
[000:15:04;20] A MUSKET AND I SAW THE  
[000:15:06;07] PLUME OF SMOKE AND I KNEW  
[000:15:07;10] SOMETHING WAS UP.  
[000:15:08;21] I THOUGHT MAYBE IT'S A GAS  
[000:15:10;21] EXPLOSION AND THEN MAYBE, I  
[000:15:11;23] DON'T KNOW, 10 TO 12  
[000:15:13;08] SECONDS LATER THE OTHER  
[000:15:15;25] EXPLOSION HAPPENED.  
[000:15:16;16] I KNEW -- YOU KNOW, I KNEW  
[000:15:18;28] IT WASN'T -- I KIND OF HAD  
[000:15:20;28] AN IDEA IT WAS A TERRORIST  
[000:15:22;09] ACT AT THAT POINT.  
[000:15:24;11] >> Shepard: JOE, WE WERE IN  
[000:15:25;05] THE MIDDLE OF "STUDIO B"  
[000:15:25;27] WHEN THIS HAPPENED THIS  
[000:15:26;29] AFTERNOON AND THE FIRST  
[000:15:28;07] VIDEO CAME IN.  
[000:15:29;03] WE SAW THE KIND OF PICTURES  
[000:15:30;17] THAT PEOPLE CAN FIND ON THE  
[000:15:31;20] INTERNET NOW.  
[000:15:32;08] BUT TO WHICH WE ARE NOT  
[000:15:33;22] GOING TO SUBJECT FAMILIES  
[000:15:34;27] AT FAMILY HOUR.  
[000:15:36;13] BUT I READ WITH INTEREST  
[000:15:38;04] YOUR DESCRIPTION OF WHAT  
[000:15:38;27] YOU WERE SEEING, THE  
[000:15:40;27] SPECIFICS THEREOF OF THOSE  
[000:15:43;08] WOUNDED.  
[000:15:43;22] IT SEEMS TO ME TO ELIMINATE  
[000:15:45;12] THAT FROM OUR REPORTING NOW  
[000:15:47;06] THOUGH WE WON'T SHOW THE  
[000:15:48;12] PICTURES WOULD DO  
[000:15:49;19] DISSERVICE TO THE FACTS.  
[000:15:50;14] I WONDER IF YOU WOULD TELL  
[000:15:51;13] US WHAT YOU WITNESSED.  
[000:15:52;14] >> WELL, WHEN THE INCIDENT  
[000:15:53;21] HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, A CREW  
[000:15:56;19] OF US WORKING AND I WAS THE  
[000:15:58;05] ONLY ONE THAT WAS OUTSIDE.  
[000:15:59;26] I RACED BACK TOWARDS THE  
[000:16:01;12] PUBLIC LIBRARY WHERE WE HAD  
[000:16:02;13] ALL OUR EQUIPMENT TO MAKE  
[000:16:03;27] SURE THAT THE GUYS WERE  
[000:16:05;10] OKAY.  
[000:16:05;23] AND THE POLICE RUSHING US  
[000:16:07;00] OUT OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE  
[000:16:08;04] THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE  
[000:16:09;11] A DEVICE INSIDE THE  
[000:16:10;12] LIBRARY.  
[000:16:11;06] AND I LOOKED ACROSS THE  
[000:16:12;28] STREET AT THAT POINT AND IT  
[000:16:15;11] WAS JUST -- THE SIDEWALK  
[000:16:17;00] WAS, AGAIN WAS LIKE A SEA  
[000:16:18;13] OF BLOOD.  
[000:16:20;03] AND, I HUNG AROUND FOR A  
[000:16:22;07] FEW MOMENTS TO SEE IF I  
[000:16:23;10] COULD DO ANYTHING.  
[000:16:24;25] AND THE PROBLEM WAS HE --  
[000:16:28;15] THEY COULDN'T GET ANY  
[000:16:29;10] VEHICLES IN THERE BECAUSE  
[000:16:30;03] IT WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED  
[000:16:31;15] OFF AS IT USUALLY IS  
[000:16:33;18] BECAUSE OF THE MASS OF  
[000:16:35;06] RUNNERS.  
[000:16:35;20] >> Shepard: THAT'S WHY WE  
[000:16:36;13] SAW SOME PEOPLE BEING  
[000:16:37;23] WHEELED AROUND IN  
[000:16:39;13] WHEELCHAIRS WITHOUT  
[000:16:40;23] AMBULANCES.  
[000:16:41;09] >> CORRECT.  
[000:16:41;25] THE RECOVERY TENT, WHICH  
[000:16:42;17] WAS, YOU KNOW, ABOUT MAYBE  
[000:16:44;21] 100 YARDS DOWN THE ROAD,  
[000:16:45;16] YOU KNOW, USED AS A  
[000:16:47;04] RECOVERY TENT AND BEING  
[000:16:48;12] USED AS ALMOST A MAKESHIFT  
[000:16:49;28] HOSPITAL AND THEY COULDN'T  
[000:16:52;28] GET VEHICLES IN THERE.  
[000:16:53;23] SO IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT  
[000:16:57;13] PEOPLE THAT WAS INJURED TO  
[000:16:58;11] GET THEM OUT OF THE AREA  
[000:16:59;12] THEY HAD TO, EXACTLY USE  
[000:17:01;03] THE WHEELCHAIR THAT THEY  
[000:17:02;07] USUALLY USE FOR RUNNERS  
[000:17:03;15] THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM  
[000:17:04;19] FATIGUE OR WHATEVER I MEAN,  
[000:17:08;13] YOU KNOW, JUST HORRIFIC  
[000:17:11;23] INJURIES.  
[000:17:12;08] MOST OF THEM WERE LOWER  
[000:17:13;06] BODY INJURIES TO BE HONEST  
[000:17:16;00] WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT  
[000:17:17;07] SHRAPNEL WAS THERE BUT IT  
[000:17:20;00] WAS AN UGLY SCENE.  
[000:17:23;02] >> YOU KNOW, IT WAS OUR  
[000:17:29;01] SENSE IN WATCHING THIS THAT  
[000:17:30;02] THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE  
[000:17:31;11] TRYING TO RISE ABOVE AND  
[000:17:32;13] GIVE A HAND THERE AT THE  
[000:17:33;14] TIME.  
[000:17:33;27] IT WAS REMARKABLE TO WATCH.  
[000:17:38;02] >> I DON'T KNOW IF I DID  
[000:17:40;01] THAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE AN  
[000:17:41;27] OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE.  
[000:17:43;16] STUFF HAPPENS ALL OVER THE  
[000:17:44;19] WORLD AND YOU DON'T EXPECT  
[000:17:49;23] IT TO HAPPEN IN A CITY LIKE  
[000:17:51;21] BOSTON.  
[000:17:52;05] BUT IT CAN.  
[000:17:52;24] A GUY CAN JUST WALK DOWN  
[000:17:54;03] THE STREET AND PUT A  
[000:17:57;23] BACKPACK AND TRASH BARREL  
[000:18:00;02] AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT AN  
[000:18:02;11] ENTIRE REGION IS JUST  
[000:18:04;03] BROUGHT TO GRIPS.  
[000:18:05;14] IT'S PRETTY SAD.  
[000:18:09;19] >> IT WAS CONFIRMED TO ADD  
[000:18:11;01] TO YOUR POINT WHAT WE HAVE  
[000:18:12;06] KNOWN TO THIS MOMENT IF YOU  
[000:18:14;12] GET ON TO GET ON A SUBWAY  
[000:18:15;24] IN BOSTON OR YOU ARE ON A  
[000:18:20;13] BUSY STREET CORNER YOU KNOW  
[000:18:21;28] SECURITY IS TIGHT AND THEY  
[000:18:23;01] ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN DO.  
[000:18:25;20] IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET ON  
[000:18:27;08] THE SIX TRAIN IN NEW YORK  
[000:18:28;04] CITY WITH A BACKPACK ON  
[000:18:30;12] THEY CAN ALL DOO THAT WE  
[000:18:31;22] HAVE BEEN THANKFUL ALL

[000:18:45;14] IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS AND I  
[000:18:47;00] THINK WE ALL LET OUR GUARD  
[000:18:48;10] DOWN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.  
[000:18:49;19] I MEAN, YOU KNOW, -- COUPLE  
[000:18:55;21] YEARS NOW DOING WHAT I  
[000:18:59;18] WORK FOR AND THERE IS A  
[000:19:02;10] HIGH POLICE PRESENCE THERE.

[000:19:08;16] DOING, YOU KNOW, IT'S  
[000:19:10;21] ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE, LIKE  
[000:19:11;22] FINDING A NEEDLE IN THE HAY  
[000:19:16;04] STACK.

[000:21:15;17] PEOPLE AROUND THE FINISH  
[000:21:16;24] LIBRARY AT THE BOSTON

[000:21:28;20] THERE, AT LEAST IN THE  
[000:21:30;02] EARLY GOING.

[000:22:03;17] DID THIS.  
[000:22:04;12] WE'LL FIND OUT WHY THEY DID  
[000:22:06;01] THIS.

[000:22:39;19] SO ARE ITS PEOPLE.  
[000:22:41;21] I'M EXTREMELY CONFIDENT

[000:23:27;16] ACT OF TERRORISM.  
[000:23:28;14] THE PRESIDENT DELIBERATELY

[000:23:31;05] HIS REMARKS IN THE PRESS  
[000:23:32;20] BRIEFING ROOM BECAUSE HE  
[000:23:33;17] DOES NOT WANT TO GET AHEAD

[000:25:26;07] BEGINNING THERE.  
[000:25:26;25] >> YES.  
[000:25:27;24] >> Shepard: WE WILL HEAR  
[000:25:28;16] MORE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE  
[000:25:29;26] ITSELF?  
[000:25:30;10] >> I DON'T THINK WE WILL  
[000:25:31;02] HEAR FROM WHITE HOUSE  
[000:25:32;06] OFFICIALS PUBLICLY.  
[000:25:33;06] YOU ARE RIGHT THAT IT'S  
[000:25:34;16] DOUBTFUL THE PRESIDENT  
[000:25:35;07] WOULD COME OUT A SECOND  
[000:25:36;10] TIME UNLESS THERE WAS SOME  
[000:25:38;20] DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENT.  
[000:25:39;11] I THINK THEY ARE CONTENT

[000:25:48;19] THAT THE ENTIRE NATION IS  
[000:25:49;24] PRAYING TONIGHT FOR BOSTON.  
[000:25:51;08] THAT IS FOR SURE,  
[000:25:53;04] OBVIOUSLY.  
[000:25:53;19] BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS  
[000:25:54;25] HAPPENING HERE, YES THEY

[000:26:19;13] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:26:20;00] AND THE LAST THING THE  
[000:26:20;21] WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO DO IS  
[000:26:21;22] INTERFERE WITH THAT THEY

[000:26:39;08] IN THIS INVESTIGATION.  
[000:26:40;18] THIS IS BREAKING NOW.  
[000:26:41;17] JONATHAN HUNT WITH THIS  
[000:26:42;14] INFORMATION FROM THE  
[000:26:43;04] NEWSROOM.  
[000:26:43;19] >> THE NAVY SENDING ONE OF  
[000:26:44;25] ITS BOMB DISPOSAL UNITS TO  
[000:26:46;17] ASSIST LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN  
[000:26:47;23] BOSTON.  
[000:26:49;07] IT'S EXPROPOSAL ORDINANCE  
[000:26:52;16] GOBLE TEAM NEWPORT RHODE  
[000:26:54;17] ISLAND.  
[000:26:55;01] THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY.  
[000:26:56;06] WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM  
[000:26:58;26] BOSTON THEY WANT TO NOW GO

[000:27:08;28] PACKAGE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT  
[000:27:09;27] ON THE SECRETS AROUND  
[000:27:11;01] BOSTON.  
[000:27:11;15] WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN TOLD  
[000:27:12;28] THAT THEY MAY HAVE FOUND  
[000:27:14;28] SEVERAL UNEXPLODED DEVICES  
[000:27:17;05] A COUPLE OF THOSE, ONE  
[000:27:18;23] REPORT SAYS THREE  
[000:27:20;16] UNEXPLODED DEVICES HAVE  
[000:27:21;11] BEEN FOUND.  
[000:27:22;09] NOW, IF THAT IS TRUE  
[000:27:23;24] OBVIOUSLY, THAT WILL BE A  
[000:27:25;03] TREASURE TROVE OF  
[000:27:26;27] INFORMATION FOR  
[000:27:28;16] INVESTIGATORS.  
[000:27:29;03] BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE  
[000:27:29;26] SO MANY REPORTS OF SO MANY  
[000:27:32;13] SUSPICIOUS DEVICES IN THE  
[000:27:33;20] HOURS AND PERHAPS DAYS TO

[000:27:37;23] HELP THEY CAN GET SO THE  
[000:27:39;12] U.S. NAVY AS I SAY NOW  
[000:27:40;26] SENDING A BOMB DISPOSAL  
[000:27:42;15] UNIT TO BOSTON TO HELP  
[000:27:43;28] LOCAL AUTHORITIES THERE.  
[000:27:46;06] SHEP?  
[000:27:46;19] >> Shepard: JONATHAN, THE  
[000:27:47;12] OFFICIAL NUMBERS ARE AT THE  
[000:27:48;17] BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND  
[000:27:49;17] HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT THE  
[000:27:52;13] AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  
[000:27:54;21] THOUGH THE FINE NEWS  
[000:27:56;01] ORGANIZATION IN BOSTON AND  
[000:27:56;29] ASSOCIATED PRESS ARE WELL  
[000:27:58;02] AHEAD OF THIS.  
[000:27:58;19] THE A.P. HAS 100.  
[000:28:00;29] BOSTON.COM OR THE BOSTON  
[000:28:02;17] HERALD -- I MEAN THE  
[000:28:03;19] "BOSTON GLOBE," I'M SORRY  
[000:28:05;28] IS AT 115 WITH TWO DEAD.  
[000:28:07;19] I'M NOT SURE WE'RE POSITIVE  
[000:28:09;26] YET OF EXACTLY HOW MANY  
[000:28:11;18] INJURED AND OTHERWISE WE  
[000:28:13;26] HAVE.  
[000:28:14;09] BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S  
[000:28:15;26] COMPLETELY RELEVANT AT THE  
[000:28:16;21] MOMENT ANYWAY.  
[000:28:17;13] >> NO.  
[000:28:18;02] IT SEEMS TO BE WE ARE IN  
[000:28:19;11] THE REGION OF 100 INJURED  
[000:28:21;07] IN THIS.  
[000:28:21;26] I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE  
[000:28:23;14] SAFEST WAY TO PUT IT RIGHT  
[000:28:25;16] NOW, SHEP.  
[000:28:26;23] ONCE YOU GET TO THE LOWER  
[000:28:28;21] END OF INJURIES, NOT EVERY  
[000:28:30;28] ONE ACCOUNTED BY SOME  
[000:28:33;07] ORGANIZATION.  
[000:28:33;24] THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT GET  
[000:28:34;26] SOME DISCREPANCY 98 AND  
[000:28:36;19] SEEING UP TO 115,000.  
[000:28:38;15] IN TERMS OF THE DEAD, WE  
[000:28:39;09] HAVE TWO CONFIRMED AND THE  
[000:28:42;02] TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE NEWS

[000:28:55;12] JUST KIDS WHO AS I WAS  
[000:28:57;13] SAYING EARLIER WERE TAKEN  
[000:28:58;18] BY THEIR PARENTS TO SEE

[000:29:05;02] A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN BOSTON

[000:33:23;28] TO ESSENTIALLY STAY OFF THE

[000:33:26;14] THIS IS BEING LOOKED AT AS  
[000:33:28;00] AN ONGOING EVENT AND  
[000:33:29;16] AUTHORITIES WANT TO ENSURE  
[000:33:30;25] THAT EVERYONE IS SAFE AND  
[000:33:33;00] THEY DON'T WANT ANYBODY OUT

[000:33:56;28] NOT JUST FOR SAFETY SAKE  
[000:33:58;02] BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ENSURE  
[000:33:59;12] THAT ALL OF THE VICTIMS ARE  
[000:34:00;07] SAFE, BUT THEY WANT TO TALK  
[000:34:01;05] TO PEOPLE THAT WERE  
[000:34:02;19] WITNESSES.  
[000:34:03;04] PEOPLE THAT WERE RIGHT  
[000:34:03;25] THERE WHEN THIS OCCURRED TO  
[000:34:04;24] SEE WHAT THEY SAW AND TO  
[000:34:07;08] TRY TO GATHERING

[000:34:10;19] MANY PEOPLE SERIOUSLY  
[000:34:11;26] INJURED BUT ASK WHAT

[000:34:13;21] SO THERE ARE INVESTIGATORS  
[000:34:14;26] OUT AT ALL THESE VARIOUS

[000:34:23;13] PEOPLE IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW.

[000:34:44;27] SEE THE SMOKE IN THE  
[000:34:46;19] DISTANCE.  
[000:34:47;04] OFFICIALS SAY THAT THIS IS  
[000:34:48;02] BETWEEN THE TWO BLASTS WAS  
[000:34:49;28] ABOUT THE LENGTH OF A  
[000:34:50;27] FOOTBALL FIELD.  
[000:34:51;24] WE'RE ALSO GETTING THE  
[000:34:54;15] DISPATCH RECORDINGS FROM  
[000:34:55;26] THE SCENE.

[000:35:15;23] THE 984.  
[000:35:16;13] I ONLY WANT TO HEAR FROM.  
[000:35:19;06] [MULTIPLE PEOPLE TALKING.

[000:35:34;01] MULTIPLE PEOPLE DOWN HERE,  
[000:35:35;17] OKAY?  
[000:35:36;00] I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE  
[000:35:36;29] IS.  
[000:35:37;11] STAND BY.  
[000:35:39;09] >> HAVE THE BOMB SQUAD CALL  
[000:35:41;02] ME IMMEDIATELY 5449,  
[000:35:43;19] IMMEDIATELY.  
[000:35:44;14] >> BOMB SQUAD MONITORING.  
[000:35:49;07] >> WE HAVE UNATTENDED  
[000:35:52;05] BACKPACK AT BOYLSTON AND WE  
[000:35:54;07] NEED TO SET UP A PERIMETER  
[000:35:55;15] TO GET PEOPLE AWAY FROM IT.  
[000:35:57;04] >> WE ARE GOING TO GET THE  
[000:35:58;06] VICTIMS OUT.  
[000:35:58;25] WE WILL CONDUCT A SWEEP  
[000:36:00;25] WITH MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO  
[000:36:02;03] OTHER DEVICES ON THE  
[000:36:03;18] STREET.  
[000:36:04;02] WE WILL GET PEOPLE OUT OF  
[000:36:04;25] THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS.  
[000:36:06;19] >> Shepard: THAT IS HOW IT  
[000:36:07;16] ALL WENT DOWN WITH THE  
[000:36:09;05] FINAL WORD OF EXACTLY HOW  
[000:36:10;18] THINGS WERE GOING TO  
[000:36:11;26] PROCEED.  
[000:36:12;10] HANG WITH ME.  
[000:36:12;29] THOSE RECORDINGS WERE FROM  
[000:36:14;23] POLICE DISPATCH CHANNELS  
[000:36:15;15] AND WHEN IT FIRST BECAME  
[000:36:17;10] CLEAR THAT RESPONDERS WERE  
[000:36:18;15] DEALING WITH AN ACT OF  
[000:36:21;01] TERROR.  
[000:36:21;15] THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH  
[000:36:23;03] NUMEROUS DRILLS TO THEY  
[000:36:24;06] TELL US TO PREPARE FOR THIS  
[000:36:25;05] SORT OF THING.  
[000:36:25;27] SO FOR THOSE FIRST  
[000:36:27;24] RESPONDERS AND THE REST,  
[000:36:28;20] THIS WAS PART OF A ROUTINE  
[000:36:29;27] THAT HAS COME THROUGH THE  
[000:36:31;24] DRILLS.  
[000:36:32;08] WE SPOKE WITH PEOPLE AT  
[000:36:33;04] HOSPITALS TODAY WITH  
[000:36:34;06] DOCTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS  
[000:36:34;29] AT HOSPITALS AS SOME OF THE  
[000:36:38;21] FINEST HOSPITALS IN THE  
[000:36:39;18] NATION OBVIOUSLY BEGAN TO  
[000:36:41;00] TAKE THE INJURED.  
[000:36:42;28] DOCTORS SPOKE WITH US LIVE  
[000:36:44;01] THIS AFTERNOON ON  
[000:36:45;20] TELEVISION EXPLAINING WE  
[000:36:46;12] KNEW WHAT WOULD GO DOWN.  
[000:36:47;16] WE EXPECTED THESE SORTS OF  
[000:36:48;25] THINGS.  
[000:36:49;09] WE WERE READY FOR THIS.  
[000:36:50;11] IN FACT, AT MASS GENERAL.  
[000:36:54;09] BOSTON'S MASS GENERAL  
[000:36:56;06] HOSPITAL THEY SAID THEY  
[000:36:57;03] WERE READY FOR MORE WOUNDED  
[000:36:58;15] THAT THE OPERATING ROOMS  
[000:36:59;08] WERE KEPT OPEN THAT THIS  
[000:37:01;18] WENT ACCORDING TO PLAN FROM  
[000:37:02;17] THE TERROR DRILLS THAT HAD  
[000:37:04;26] TAKEN PLACE IN THE WAKE OF  
[000:37:06;15] THE ATTACKS ON OUR COUNTRY  
[000:37:07;24] AND OTHERWISE.  
[000:37:08;12] FOR THE BOSTON MARATHON  
[000:37:11;14] THEY HAD PREPARED WELL WITH  
[000:37:12;08] THE HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY  
[000:37:14;02] MANAGERS.  
[000:37:14;17] THEY GOT PEOPLE TO THOSE  
[000:37:15;19] HOSPITALS WHICH WE HOPE  
[000:37:16;11] WILL RESULT IN VERY FEW  
[000:37:18;01] NUMBERS OF LOSS OF LIFE.  
[000:37:19;13] OF COURSE, IF IT'S SOMEONE  
[000:37:20;21] YOU KNOW, THE NUMBER IS  
[000:37:22;14] ALREADY WAY TOO HIGH.  
[000:37:23;15] OF COURSE, THE DEADLY  
[000:37:25;00] TERROR ATTACK THERE IN  
[000:37:25;28] BOSTON IS RAISING CONCERNS  
[000:37:27;02] ABOUT SECURITY ACROSS THE  
[000:37:28;18] NATION.  
[000:37:29;02] AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE  
[000:37:29;25] PREPARING AND HAVE ALREADY  
[000:37:32;03] BEGUN TO RAISE SECURITY.  
[000:37:34;24] WILY IS A FORMER DIRECTOR  
[000:37:36;14] FOR THE NATIONAL THREATS ON  
[000:37:38;05] THE NATIONAL SECURITY  
[000:37:41;03] COUNCIL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  
[000:37:42;11] HE IS THE PRESIDENT UNDER  
[000:37:43;21] PRESIDENT CLINTON AND  
[000:37:44;21] GEORGE W. BUSH AND HE IS  
[000:37:45;28] WITH US NOW ON THE PHONE.  
[000:37:47;09] LEE, FOLKS LIKE YOU ARE  
[000:37:48;22] BUSY RIGHT NOW.  
[000:37:49;18] >> YES, GOOD EVENING SHEP.  
[000:37:51;23] >> Shepard: WHERE ARE WE IN  
[000:37:52;17] THE PROCESS?  
[000:37:53;28] >> WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE  
[000:37:55;10] FIRST STEP IS TO CARE FOR  
[000:37:56;22] THE INJURED AND TO CARE FOR  
[000:37:57;27] THEIR FAMILIES OF THE  
[000:38:01;05] CASUALTY TODAY.  
[000:38:01;23] AND THE SECOND STEP IS TO  
[000:38:03;13] TURN TOWARDS THE  
[000:38:04;05] INVESTIGATION AND FIGURE  
[000:38:04;27] OUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.  
[000:38:07;07] >> Shepard: IT'S MY  
[000:38:09;14] STANDING FROM SECURITY  
[000:38:10;11] TYPES THAT THERE ARE  
[000:38:11;19] SIGNATURES THAT THEY WILL  
[000:38:12;12] KNOW QUICKLY IF THEY DON'T  
[000:38:14;04] ALREADY WHETHER THIS IS  
[000:38:14;28] SOME ORGANIZED GROUP WHO  
[000:38:16;12] DOES THIS FOR A LIVING OR  
[000:38:18;00] SOMETHING HIS.  
[000:38:19;04] >> RIGHT.  
[000:38:19;19] I MEAN, I THINK HA THERE IS  
[000:38:21;21] SOME INDICATIONS THAT THERE  
[000:38:22;17] IS PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE I  
[000:38:24;27] HAD INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF  
[000:38:27;11] MULTIPLICITY OF GUYS THE  
[000:38:28;06] FACT THAT THEY HAD TO BE  
[000:38:29;25] PLACED AT DIFFERENT  
[000:38:31;06] LOCATIONS THAT REQUIRED  
[000:38:32;09] SOME COORDINATION.  
[000:38:33;02] WHO ARE THEY?  
[000:38:33;21] ARE THEY PURELY DOMESTIC?  
[000:38:35;26] ARE THEY DOE MESS STWIK  
[000:38:38;13] INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT?  
[000:38:46;01] OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?  
[000:38:48;00] ORGANIZED INTERNATIONAL  
[000:38:49;11] ATTACK?  
[000:38:49;25] I THINK THE CHANCES OF THAT  
[000:38:51;00] LAST POSSIBILITY ARE  
[000:38:51;29] PROBABLY PRETTY SLIM AND IT  
[000:38:54;11] PROBABLY ONE OF TWO FLAVORS  
[000:38:55;26] OF DOMESTIC ATTACK.  
[000:38:58;27] PURELY DOMESTIC SUCH AS THE  
[000:39:02;04] OLYMPICS IN 1996 OR EVEN  
[000:39:04;01] OKLAHOMA CITY IN 1995.  
[000:39:05;26] OR DOMESTIC WITH AN  
[000:39:09;12] INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT IE  
[000:39:12;02] SOMEBODY WHO IS BORN HERE  
[000:39:13;06] AND LIVED HERE AND  
[000:39:16;02] RADICALIZED ABROAD.  
[000:39:17;07] >> Shepard: LEE, I WONDER  
[000:39:18;08] IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE  
[000:39:19;08] SOME NUT JOB WHO JUST  
[000:39:20;07] WANTED TO CAUSE A BIG SHOW?  
[000:39:25;28] I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY  
[000:39:26;23] CLARITY IN THIS MATTER.  
[000:39:27;21] >> ABSOLUTELY.  
[000:39:29;24] ANOTHER MATTER TO POINT OUT  
[000:39:30;19] IT'S A LOCAL HOLIDAY IN  
[000:39:33;07] MASSACHUSETTS AND CERTAIN  
[000:39:34;00] PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND  
[000:39:35;05] PATRIOTS DAY.  
[000:39:35;29] THAT HOLIDAY COMMON RATES  
[000:39:37;21] THE BATTLES OF LEXINGTON  
[000:39:39;05] AND CONQUERORS FIRST  
[000:39:42;14] REVOLUTIONARY WAR 1775.  
[000:39:43;18] IT'S POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH  
[000:39:44;23] THIS IS OBVIOUSLY  
[000:39:45;23] SPECULATION THAT IT IS --  
[000:39:56;00] HARD TO KNOW BUT IT IS  
[000:39:57;26] THAT -- IT DOES HAVE  
[000:39:59;15] SIGNIFICANCE IN THE REGION  
[000:40:00;08] IN BOSTON.  
[000:40:04;19] >> Shepard: REALLY, WHEN WE  
[000:40:05;13] WENT THROUGH THE TRIAL, I  
[000:40:06;11] COVERED THE OKLAHOMA CITY  
[000:40:07;06] BOMBING AND THEN THE TRIAL  
[000:40:08;23] OF TIMOTHY MCVEIGH WHICH  
[000:40:09;26] FOLLOWED, AND THERE IS NO  
[000:40:12;18] QUESTION THAT THE REASON  
[000:40:13;23] THAT THAT HAPPENED AT THAT  
[000:40:14;24] TIME HAD SOMETHING TO DO  
[000:40:16;17] WITH THE ATTACKS AT WACO  
[000:40:18;07] AND BEYOND.  
[000:40:18;27] TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE  
[000:40:19;25] TALKING ABOUT THIS DATE, IT  
[000:40:22;09] IS JUST IN A VACUUM WITHOUT  
[000:40:25;02] HISTORICAL CONTEXT IS  
[000:40:25;23] REALLY TO MISS THE FACTS  
[000:40:27;01] HERE.  
[000:40:27;14] IN THE PAST THAT HAS  
[000:40:28;07] HAPPENED.  
[000:40:28;22] IT'S NOT TO SAY IT HAS  
[000:40:30;00] HAPPENED AT THIS TIME BUT  
[000:40:30;23] IN THE PAST IT HAS.  
[000:40:33;12] >> THAT'S CORRECT.  
[000:40:35;18] OBVIOUSLY THE TARGET, THE  
[000:40:36;25] BOSTON MARATHON IS A  
[000:40:38;03] SIGNIFICANT EVENT FOR  
[000:40:38;24] BOSTON AND IT IS AN  
[000:40:41;20] INTERNATIONAL EVENT IN THE  
[000:40:42;13] SENSE THAT IT DRAWS  
[000:40:43;29] INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS  
[000:40:44;22] AND VERY IMPORTANT RACE.  
[000:40:45;27] BUT IT IS NOT A TARGET OF  
[000:40:49;04] NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL  
[000:40:50;22] SIGNIFICANCE SUCH AS A --  
[000:40:52;08] THE WORLD TRADE CENTER OR  
[000:40:53;22] EVEN THE OLYMPIC GAMES.  
[000:40:57;01] >> Shepard: RIGHT.  
[000:40:57;20] IF I MIGHT GO ONE FARTHER  
[000:40:59;20] I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS IS  
[000:41:00;19] THE REASON FOR ANYTHING.  
[000:41:01;25] ONE REASON WE KNOW ABOUT  
[000:41:02;28] THE BOSTON MARATHON IS  
[000:41:04;07] THERE WILL BE CAMERAS  
[000:41:05;19] EVERYWHERE.  
[000:41:06;05] ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT  
[000:41:07;10] NEWS EVENTS IS TO MAKE THEM  
[000:41:08;20] HAVE IMPACT YOU NEED TO  
[000:41:10;02] HAVE VIDEO OF IT HAPPENING.  
[000:41:13;10] AS IT SO HAPPENS OR BY  
[000:41:14;24] DESIGN, ONE OR THE OTHER  
[000:41:15;21] THESE EXPLOSIONS HAPPENED  
[000:41:16;26] AS CAMERAS WERE RUNNING ON  
[000:41:18;25] THE SIDELINES AND AS  
[000:41:20;03] CHOPPERS FLEW IN THE AIR.  
[000:41:21;12] >> RIGHT.  
[000:41:22;15] RIGHT.  
[000:41:23;13] CLEARLY IT WAS A  
[000:41:26;10] WELL-PLANNED ATTACK, AS I  
[000:41:27;10] SAID, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.  
[000:41:38;22] I WANT TO CONTINUE WITH  
[000:41:39;18] THESE PICTURES.  
[000:41:40;10] BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO  
[000:41:44;14] REMEMBER.  
[000:41:44;29] IF YOU ARE PLANNING AN  
[000:41:45;20] EVENT OF ANY KIND, YOU HAVE  
[000:41:46;26] SOME SORT OF GOAL IN MIND.  
[000:41:53;01] PLANNING AN EVENT WHICH  
[000:41:54;01] WAS A BOMBING AND YOU WANT  
[000:41:55;24] TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED, THEN  
[000:41:56;25] YOU WOULD DO THAT THEN YOU  
[000:41:59;01] WILL BE POSITIVE THERE WERE  
[000:42:00;11] CAMERAS THERE TO RECORD IT,  
[000:42:01;28] RIGHT?  
[000:42:02;11] THAT'S NOT A MATTER OF  
[000:42:03;22] SPECULATION.  
[000:42:04;08] THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.  
[000:42:05;26] AND TODAY TO HAVE IT AT  
[000:42:07;16] THE FINISH LINE OF THE  
[000:42:08;27] BOSTON MARATHON.  
[000:42:09;24] WHOEVER PUT THOSE BOMBS  
[000:42:11;16] THERE WAS -- COULD SAY WITH  
[000:42:13;12] GREAT CERTAINTY THAT THERE  
[000:42:14;11] WOULD BE CAMERAS ON THIS  
[000:42:16;06] EVENT.  
[000:42:16;19] AND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY  
[000:42:17;18] QUICK AND EASY TO GET LIVE  
[000:42:19;18] COVERAGE AFTERWARDS AND  
[000:42:20;17] THAT THERE WOULD BE A  
[000:42:21;15] RECORD OF WHAT YOU DID THAT  
[000:42:23;05] WOULD LAST FOR GENERATIONS  
[000:42:25;08] BEYOND ANY OF US.  
[000:42:27;07] THIS PICTURE RIGHT NOW IS  
[000:42:30;02] FOREVER WHAT HAPPENED ON --  
[000:42:31;02] IN BOSTON ON PATRIOTS DAY  
[000:42:33;17] IN 2013.  
[000:42:34;01] BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WERE  
[000:42:35;11] THERE AND RECORDED IT  
[000:42:37;21] HAPPEN.  
[000:42:38;05] WERE I TELLING YOU ABOUT IT  
[000:42:39;15] NOW, AND EXPLAINING TO YOU  
[000:42:42;12] THAT THERE WERE MASS  
[000:42:44;04] CASUALTIES AND THE SCENE  
[000:42:45;04] WAS CHAOTIC WOULD NOT HAVE  
[000:42:46;15] NEARLY THE IMPACT ON THE  
[000:42:48;12] COLLECTIVE PSYCHE THAT THIS  
[000:42:49;28] VIDEO DOES.  
[000:42:50;18] IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE  
[000:42:52;25] THERE BUT NOT FOR THE REST  
[000:42:54;16] OF US.  
[000:42:55;02] IF THERE HADN'T BEEN VIDEO  
[000:42:56;07] OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER  
[000:42:57;22] ATTACK AS A SEPARATE AND  
[000:42:58;26] NOT RELATED IN ANYWAY WE  
[000:43:00;04] WOULD ALL HAVE DIFFERENT  
[000:43:02;13] COLLECTIVE MEMORIES.  
[000:43:03;05] WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE AND  
[000:43:04;11] THEY CAME FROM THE  
[000:43:06;05] TELEVISION IMAGES.  
[000:43:07;02] THIS IS WHAT WE WILL  
[000:43:07;25] REMEMBER FROM HERE.  
[000:43:08;20] WHOEVER PLANTED THOSE  
[000:43:10;04] BOMBS, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION  
[000:43:10;29] KNEW THAT ON THE PHONE WITH  
[000:43:12;02] US NOW THE RUNNER DEMI  
[000:43:14;07] CLARK, SHE WAS RUNNING THE  
[000:43:15;15] MARATHON, SAYS SHE WAS JUST  
[000:43:16;20] CROSSING THE FINISH LINE AS  
[000:43:18;07] THE BOMB BLAST ROCKED THE  
[000:43:20;02] STREET.  
[000:43:20;16] DEMI, HOW ARE YOU?  
[000:43:21;18] ARE YOU SAFE?  
[000:43:23;03] >> YES WE'RE AT OUR HOTEL  
[000:43:24;21] IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW.  
[000:43:26;24] >> Shepard: SO YOU ARE  
[000:43:27;15] CROSSING THE FINISH LINE.  
[000:43:28;26] AND, AS YOU DID WAS PART  
[000:43:30;10] OF YOUR THINKING THAT MAYBE  
[000:43:31;13] THIS IS PART OF A PATRIOTS  
[000:43:33;17] DAY CELEBRATION OR BECAUSE  
[000:43:34;12] YOU HAD CROSSED IT WAS  
[000:43:35;22] CLEARLY BEHIND YOU, WHAT  
[000:43:36;19] WAS YOUR THINKING?  
[000:43:37;24] >> HONESTLY, IT WAS.  
[000:43:39;17] I THINK -- I LITERALLY HIT  
[000:43:42;05] THE FINISH LINE AS IT  
[000:43:43;23] HAPPENED AND LOOKED AT AN  
[000:43:45;17] OFFICIAL WHO WAS FACING  
[000:43:46;15] THAT WAY AND HE HAD THIS  
[000:43:47;24] LOOK OF HORROR ON HIS FACE.  
[000:43:49;16] AND SO I KNEW IT WASN'T  
[000:43:50;29] RIGHT.  
[000:43:51;12] IT JUST KIND OF EXPLODED  
[000:43:52;12] ALL OUR EARDRUMS, TOO.  
[000:43:54;07] SO IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT.  
[000:43:55;14] WE KNEW IT WASN'T RIGHT.  
[000:43:58;07] >> Shepard: HUH.  
[000:43:58;25] AND AFTER THAT HAPPENED,  
[000:44:00;09] THE MOMENTS AFTER THE FIRST  
[000:44:02;08] BLAST, WHAT DID YOU DO AND  
[000:44:03;18] WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE  
[000:44:04;16] SECOND HIT?  
[000:44:06;03] >> I WAS LOOKING TO THE  
[000:44:08;01] LEFT AND SAW JUST CARNAGE.  
[000:44:11;02] I MEAN SOMETHING OUT OF A  
[000:44:12;08] WAR ZONE.  
[000:44:12;26] IT WAS PEOPLE UP AGAINST  
[000:44:14;20] FENCES.  
[000:44:15;04] BLOOD EVERYWHERE.  
[000:44:15;23] RUN ARERS DOWN TO MY LEFT.  
[000:44:17;25] AND GLASS AND THEN THE  
[000:44:19;19] OTHER EXPLOSION WENT OF  
[000:44:20;24] OFF.  
[000:44:21;06] MY FAMILY WAS IN THE  
[000:44:22;14] BLEACHER SECTION.  
[000:44:23;08] MY THREE OUTCOME DAUGHTERS  
[000:44:24;04] AND MY HUSBAND.  
[000:44:25;08] I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OH MY  
[000:44:27;04] GOODNESS ANOTHER ONE COULD  
[000:44:28;01] GO OFF.  
[000:44:29;04] HOW DO I GET THEM OUT OF  
[000:44:30;10] HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?  
[000:44:31;25] >> Shepard: AND THEN  
[000:44:32;15] ANOTHER ONE DID?  
[000:44:33;03] >> YES.  
[000:44:34;06] AND AWAY FROM US BUT  
[000:44:36;09] IMMEDIATELY I JUST THOUGHT  
[000:44:37;09] YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WAS  
[000:44:39;21] MOTHER'S INSTINCT IS WHAT  
[000:44:40;21] CAN I DO TO GET MY KIDS OUT  
[000:44:42;06] OF HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE  
[000:44:43;13] SEVEN AND NINE AND DON'T  
[000:44:44;16] KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THE  
[000:44:46;07] SITUATION LIKE THIS.  
[000:44:47;04] >> Shepard: WHAT DID YOU  
[000:44:48;22] DO?  
[000:44:49;04] >> I TRIED MY BEST TO GET  
[000:44:50;06] TO THEM.  
[000:44:52;02] MY HUSBAND 6'4", 240.  
[000:44:53;27] I SAW HIM WITH ONE CHILD  
[000:44:55;14] UNDER EACH ARM.  
[000:44:56;06] I HAD JUST SEEN THEM.  
[000:44:57;22] SO I KNEW HOW TO SIGHTED  
[000:44:59;17] THEM FROM THE FINISH.  
[000:45:00;22] HE WAS MAKING HIS WAY TO  
[000:45:02;15] ME.  
[000:45:02;27] OFFICIALS WERE TRYING  
[000:45:03;20] NECESSARILY TO KEEP US OFF  
[000:45:04;14] THE COURSE.  
[000:45:05;04] SO I JUST KIND OF SAID I  
[000:45:06;06] HAVE GOT TO GO TO MY FAMILY  
[000:45:08;00] AND JUST WAS IN TEARS.  
[000:45:09;21] ABSOLUTE TEARS.  
[000:45:11;09] >> Shepard: I'M GLAD YOU

[000:49:55;02] AS IN THE CASE OF A PIPE

[000:50:11;03] REACHED INTO MY POCKET, HE  
[000:50:12;08] SAID HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW  
[000:50:13;15] WHY AND FOUND WHAT LOOKED  
[000:50:14;26] LIKE SHOTGUN PELLETS IN HIS  
[000:50:17;02] POCKET.  
[000:50:18;13] IMMEDIATELY, YOU KNOW THAT  
[000:50:19;06] IS SOME SORT OF SHRAPNEL.  
[000:50:20;12] YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT  
[000:50:21;25] IT IS, BUT YOU KNOW THEN  
[000:50:23;21] SOMEBODY SET A BOMB.  
[000:50:25;10] >> YEAH.  
[000:50:25;26] IT'S NOT VERY LIKELY THAT  
[000:50:27;23] SOMEONE FOUND A PILE OF  
[000:50:29;01] SHRAPNEL THERE AND STUCK A  
[000:50:30;11] BOMB IN IT.  
[000:50:31;13] CERTAINLY IN THIS CASE IT  
[000:50:32;13] SOUNDS LIKE THE SHRAPNEL  
[000:50:33;23] WAS ALL INCLUDED.  
[000:50:35;16] THE THING WITH THESE BOMBS  
[000:50:36;24] THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS SO

[000:50:56;10] ISN'T REALLY THE GOAL.

[000:50:58;11] DID IT AND WHY.
