[000:09:08;681] WITH RUSSIAN OPERATIVES DURING
[000:09:09;549] THE CAMPAIGN.
[000:09:12;718] AT THE TIME, THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:09:13;319] INSISTED THE MEETING WAS ONLY
[000:09:15;855] ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS AND THE
[000:09:16;489] PRESIDENT PUBLICLY DEFENDED HIS
[000:09:19;959] SON.

[000:09:48;287] HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT?
[000:09:48;721] >> Reporter: WELL, IT'S
[000:09:49;221] PERFECTLY LEGAL, BUT IT IS
[000:09:49;789] HIGHLY UNUSUAL, IF NOT
[000:09:51;290] UNPRECEDENTED, FOR A POLITICAL
[000:09:51;924] PARTY TO PAY THE PERSONAL LEGAL

[000:24:57;662] from further irreversible damage
[000:24:57;662] in many adults.
[000:25:00;866] HUMIRA works by targeting

[000:25:11;243] HUMIRA can lower your ability
[000:25:11;243] to fight infections,
[000:25:13;378] including tuberculosis.

[000:25:24;990] Before treatment,
[000:25:24;990] get tested for TB.
[000:25:27;359] Tell your doctor
