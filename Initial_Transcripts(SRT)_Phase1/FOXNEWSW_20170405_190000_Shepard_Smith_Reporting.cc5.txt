[000:00:00;734] FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR HAD
[000:00:03;870] ALREADY MADE NORRIS AN HONORARY
[000:00:08;074] TEXAS RANGER.
[000:00:08;908] WHAT IS BETTER, A RANGER OR
[000:00:15;515] CITIZEN?
[000:00:15;849] HERE'S SHEP.
[000:00:20;286] >> Shepard: FIRST FROM THE FOX
[000:00:22;455] NEWS DECK, A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR
[000:00:25;658] THE UNITED STATES AND A WORLD.
[000:00:27;260] A MAJOR SHIFT FROM PRESIDENT
[000:00:29;229] TRUMP HIMSELF THIS AFTERNOON
[000:00:30;897] DURING A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE
[000:00:33;233] WITH JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH.
[000:00:38;905] THE PRESIDENT SAID THE LATEST
[000:00:44;177] ACTS OF BARBER AL-ASSAD CAN'T BE
[000:00:50;150] TOLERATED.
[000:00:50;517] >> THAT ACT ON CHILDREN HAD A
[000:00:53;286] BEEN IMPACT ON ME.
[000:00:54;454] IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING.
[000:00:56;056] I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT AND SEEING
[000:00:57;857] IT.
[000:00:58;124] IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN
[000:01:00;827] THAT.
[000:01:02;028] I HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY, AND
[000:01:06;633] IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE -- AND
[000:01:08;168] I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
[000:01:09;936] HAPPENED -- THAT MY ATTITUDE
[000:01:12;939] TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS
[000:01:14;641] CHANGED VERY MUCH.
[000:01:15;909] >> IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED, HIS
[000:01:17;911] ATTITUDE AND SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS
[000:01:20;613] CHANGED.
[000:01:20;947] DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED
[000:01:22;415] STATES WILL BECOME FOR ENGAGED
[000:01:24;017] IN THE CONFLICT?
[000:01:25;085] THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT SPECIFIC.
[000:01:26;753] WHEN ADD IN SYRIA'S ACTIONS
[000:01:29;189] CROSSED A RED LINE, HE SAID
[000:01:30;790] THIS.
[000:01:31;091] >> IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
[000:01:34;727] ME.
[000:01:35;061] WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
[000:01:36;396] INNOCENT BABIES, BABY, LITTLE
[000:01:40;900] BABIES, WITH A CHEMICAL GAS THAT
[000:01:43;703] IS SO LETHAL THAT PEOPLE WERE
[000:01:46;339] SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT GAS IT WAS,
[000:01:48;108] THAT CROSSES MANY, MANY LINES,
[000:01:50;477] BEYOND A RED LINES.
[000:01:51;811] >> Shepard: BEYOND A RED LINE.
[000:01:52;779] THE BACKGROUND HERE IS
[000:01:54;114] IMPORTANT.
[000:01:54;481] YOU MAY REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:01:55;415] IN 2012 WARNED THAT BARBER
[000:01:59;185] AL-ASSAD CROSSED A RED LINE
[000:02:00;653] SHOULD HE USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:02:02;255] THE DICTATOR DID USE THEM
[000:02:04;657] ANYWAY.
[000:02:05;225] PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED WITH
[000:02:09;195] DIPLOMACY AND STEAD OF MILITARY
[000:02:12;365] ACTION.
[000:02:12;699] >> THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD
[000:02:13;633] AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS
[000:02:15;101] CRISIS WHEN HE SET THE RED LINE
[000:02:16;436] IN THE SAND.
[000:02:17;370] WHEN HE DIDN'T CROSS THAT RED
[000:02:19;172] LINE AFTER MAKING THE THREAT,
[000:02:20;874] THAT SET US BACK A LONG WAYS NOT
[000:02:22;642] ONLY IN SYRIA BUT IN MANY OTHER
[000:02:24;477] PARTS OF THE WORLD.
[000:02:26;579] BECAUSE IT WAS A BLANK THREAT.
[000:02:31;351] I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT
[000:02:32;152] WAS NOT ONE OF OUR BETTER DAYS
[000:02:33;686] AS A COUNTRY.
[000:02:35;054] >> THAT WAS 2012.
[000:02:40;093] AND CITIZEN TRUMP URGED OBAMA
[000:02:43;429] NOT TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.
[000:02:45;532] HE TWEETED THIS.
[000:02:52;872] HE ALSO TWEETED --
[000:03:04;517] >> Shepard: NOW THE PRESIDENT
[000:03:05;485] SAYS HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.
[000:03:07;987] THAT IT'S NOW HIS
[000:03:09;556] RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT HE WILL
[000:03:10;790] ACT.
[000:03:11;057] THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE
[000:03:13;893] PRESIDENT HAS BLAMED BARBER
[000:03:17;230] AL-ASSAD FOR KILLING HIS OWN
[000:03:21;601] PEOPLE.
[000:03:22;735] YESTERDAY THE ATTACK WAS
[000:03:25;138] LAUNCHED KILLING DOZENS OF
[000:03:26;940] PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN ASLEEP
[000:03:28;474] IN THEIR BEDS.
[000:03:29;475] RUSSIA HAS BLAMED IT ON THE
[000:03:30;910] SYRIAN REBELS.
[000:03:31;711] THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED
[000:03:34;314] STATES.
[000:03:34;714] OFFICIALS IN MOSCOW SAYS A
[000:03:39;719] SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A WEAPONS
[000:03:42;355] DUMP THAT RELEASED THE DEADLY
[000:03:44;457] CHEMICALS.
[000:03:44;824] HERE'S THE BIG PICTURE.
[000:03:45;792] THIS SORT OF THING HAS BEEN
[000:03:48;461] HAPPENING FOR YEARS.
[000:03:49;295] THE SYRIAN DICTATOR'S BARREL
[000:03:52;599] BOMBS HAVE KILLED TENS OF
[000:03:54;067] THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF
[000:03:55;535] THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS
[000:03:57;737] INCLUDING WOMEN AND BABIES IN
[000:04:00;139] THEIR BEDS.
[000:04:00;907] THAT TOO IS A WAR CRIME.
[000:04:03;676] BUT IT'S A HORRIFIC VIDEO THAT
[000:04:07;247] THE PRESIDENT SAID CHANGED HIS
[000:04:08;815] MINDS AND THE NATION'S POLICY
[000:04:10;516] TOWARDS THIS CONFLICT.
[000:04:11;451] WE HAVE NO WAY TO KNOW WHETHER
[000:04:13;820] THE PRESIDENT WAS SIGNALLING AN
[000:04:15;722] IMMEDIATE MILITARY RESPONSE.
[000:04:17;290] OF THIS WE'RE SURE.
[000:04:18;625] THE SYRIAN REGIME IS BACKED BY
[000:04:20;260] THE RUSSIANS.
[000:04:21;060] THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH
[000:04:23;396] THEM AS ARE IRANIANS.
[000:04:25;164] SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENTER
[000:04:26;499] THIS CONFLICT, SUPPORTING
[000:04:28;167] MILITARILY THE REBELS, FIGHTING
[000:04:30;136] AGAINST THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD BE
[000:04:32;572] FIGHTING THE RUSSIANS AND THE
[000:04:35;642] IRANIANS.
[000:04:36;009] THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:04:37;577] CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS IS
[000:04:38;344] LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:04:40;513] HE WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY AND
[000:04:44;217] CAREFULLY NOT SO.
[000:04:45;685] >> HE'S BEEN STUDIOUSLY
[000:04:49;022] NONSPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE
[000:04:49;889] WILL TAKE ACROSS THE WORLD.
[000:04:52;358] HE'S BEEN VERY STUDIOUS SAYING
[000:04:57;330] TOO OFTEN THE OBAMA
[000:04:57;997] ADMINISTRATION WAS TELEGRAPHING
[000:04:59;299] WHAT SORT OF ACTION THEY WOULD
[000:05:00;700] TAKE.
[000:05:01;000] HE GOES BACK TO MOSUL.
[000:05:02;669] THEY TELEGRAPHED WHAT THEY WOULD
[000:05:06;272] DO IN MOSUL TELLING LEADERS WHAT
[000:05:08;541] THEY WOULD DO TO DIG IN OR GET
[000:05:10;310] OUT.
[000:05:10;576] IT'S CLEAR THIS ATTACK YESTERDAY
[000:05:11;711] IN SYRIA HAS HAD A PROFOUND
[000:05:13;579] IMPACT ON THE PRESIDENT.
[000:05:14;447] HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMAGES OF
[000:05:16;382] LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE BABIES
[000:05:18;217] DYING AND SUFFERING HORRIBLY IN
[000:05:19;819] THE WAKE OF IN GAS ATTACK.
[000:05:21;721] SAYING THAT IT HAS CROSSED A
[000:05:23;690] NUMBER OF LINES, NOT JUST A RED
[000:05:26;159] LINE, AND IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR
[000:05:27;160] THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE SOME
[000:05:29;295] SORT OF ACTION IN THE WAKE OF
[000:05:30;697] ALL OF THIS.
[000:05:31;964] TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE STRIDENT
[000:05:35;001] TERMS THAT HE HAS BEEN, BUT
[000:05:37;070] BEING DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS
[000:05:39;072] ABOUT WHAT THE UNITED STATES'
[000:05:40;139] RESPONSE MIGHT BE.
[000:05:41;607] HERE'S THE PRESIDENT.
[000:05:42;642] >> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE
[000:05:44;577] NOTICED ABOUT ME IS MILITARILY,
[000:05:47;747] I DON'T LIKE TO SAY WHERE I'M
[000:05:51;417] GOING, WHAT I'M DOING.
[000:05:52;785] I WATCHED ATTACK ADMINISTRATIONS
[000:05:54;921] SAYING WE WILL ATTACK SUCH AND
[000:05:56;289] SUCH A DAY AND SUCH AND SUCH AN
[000:05:58;725] HOUR.
[000:05:59;025] I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING ONE
[000:06:02;662] THING.
[000:06:02;962] I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU, AS
[000:06:05;898] MUCH AS I RESPECT YOU.
[000:06:08;368] >> THIS COULD BE A GAME CHANGER
[000:06:11;003] IN THE POSTURE TOWARDS SYRIA.
[000:06:13;539] THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THAT
[000:06:14;607] REGIME CHANGE WAS NOT A
[000:06:15;441] PARTICULAR PRIORITY FOR THE U.S.
[000:06:17;143] NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:18;478] MAY BE CHANGING HIS MIND, IF NOT
[000:06:20;480] ON REGIME CHANGE, AT LEAST IN
[000:06:22;482] THE UNITED STATES APPROACH TO
[000:06:32;892] AL-ASSAD.
[000:06:33;259] IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A POWERFUL
[000:06:35;495] ALLY WITH THE KING OF JORDAN
[000:06:37;764] STANDING AT THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:06:39;065] STRIDE WHO IS STRIDENT IN HIS
[000:06:41;300] CONDEMNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN
[000:06:42;835] SYRIA.
[000:06:43;236] >> AND THE PRESENCE OF KING
[000:06:47;340] ABDULLAH GAVE THIS MORE GRAVITY.
[000:06:50;743] SPEAKING ON A WORLD STAGE AND
[000:06:53;379] CERTAINLY ON LIVE TELEVISION.
[000:06:54;680] WHEN YOU CAN CONSIDER WHAT THE
[000:06:56;582] OPTICS OF THIS ARE, JORDAN, THE
[000:06:59;819] UNITED STATES, SYRIAN REBELS
[000:07:02;522] AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND
[000:07:05;358] IRANIANS.
[000:07:05;725] THAT'S WORLD WAR DEFINED.
[000:07:06;826] >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT IN FROM THE
[000:07:10;096] 30,000 FOOT LEVEL, IT'S CLEAR
[000:07:11;264] WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE LAST HOUR
[000:07:13;366] AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A
[000:07:15;201] PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYTHING
[000:07:18;004] GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
[000:07:19;338] THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID IN THE
[000:07:21;641] PAST, AS A CANDIDATE AND AS
[000:07:24;977] PRESIDENT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH
[000:07:26;179] REGIME CHANGE.
[000:07:26;946] THIS IS PURSUED BY.
[000:07:32;518] PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM.
[000:07:33;986] WHEN YOU HAVE A REGIME CHANGE,
[000:07:36;489] YOU WIND UP IN A WORSE SPOT THAN
[000:07:38;891] YOU DID BEFORE EXACTING A CHANGE
[000:07:40;359] AT THE TOP.
[000:07:41;194] HE SAID WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
[000:07:42;628] FIGHTING IN SYRIA?
[000:07:43;563] WE DON'T FLOW WHO THEY ARE.
[000:07:46;466] WHILE THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS
[000:07:50;169] APPROACH TO BASSER AL-ASSAD, IT
[000:07:55;241] SHOWS HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TRUST
[000:07:56;542] OF THE PLAYER THERE'S IN SYRIA.
[000:07:58;411] UNCLEAR WHAT HE WILL DO.
[000:07:59;645] >> JOHN ROBERTS, THANK YOU.
[000:08:02;215] LET'S TURN TO JOSH LETTERMAN.
[000:08:04;484] HE'S A FOREIGN POLICY REPORTER
[000:08:06;619] FOR THE FOREIGN PRESS.
[000:08:07;954] IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WE'RE TO
[000:08:09;255] TAKE HIM LITERALLY AND
[000:08:11;090] SERIOUSLY, SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR
[000:08:14;293] FOREIGN POLICY SHIFT.
[000:08:15;328] >> IF HE IS INDEED CHANGING THE
[000:08:17;330] WAY HE VIEWS ASSAD AND CHANGING
[000:08:19;298] FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN
[000:08:22;001] MULTIPLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
[000:08:23;002] OFFICIALS WERE SAYING THAT IT
[000:08:23;870] WAS NO LONGER A U.S. PRIORITY TO
[000:08:26;305] GET RID OF ASSAD IN SYRIA, THAT
[000:08:28;341] WOULD BE A MAJOR SHIFT.
[000:08:30;209] WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET FROM
[000:08:31;477] TRUMP, WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO
[000:08:32;879] ABOUT IT.
[000:08:34;380] THAT IS WHY THIS IS SUCH A
[000:08:36;082] DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIM.
[000:08:37;884] IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR
[000:08:40;019] OVERSEAS CRISES THAT HE'S HAD TO
[000:08:41;654] DEAL WITH AND THE FIRST TIME
[000:08:43;022] HE'S HAD TO TRANSLATE THE TOUGH
[000:08:44;790] TALK ABOUT DEALING WITH
[000:08:46;792] ADVERSARIES AND DEALING WITH
[000:08:48;160] DIFFICULT DECISIONS INTO ACTUAL
[000:08:49;962] ACTION.
[000:08:50;296] WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING ALREADY
[000:08:52;131] COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT
[000:08:54;100] ARE LOOKING TO THE U.S. FOR
[000:08:57;069] LEADERSHIP.
[000:08:57;470] ONE TO KNOW IF THIS IS A SIGNAL
[000:08:59;639] OF A MILITARY RESPOND THE U.S.
[000:09:03;009] CONSIDERING AS NIKKI HALEY
[000:09:04;143] SEEMED TO SUGGEST AT THE
[000:09:05;511] SECURITY COUNCIL OR IF IT'S
[000:09:06;712] GOING TO BE MORE RHETORIC THAT
[000:09:08;681] DOESN'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.
[000:09:11;050] TRUMP VERY RELUCTANT TO SHOW ANY
[000:09:12;585] LEG ON THAT AT THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:09:14;720] TODAY.
[000:09:15;021] >> Shepard: JOSH, BASED ON YOUR
[000:09:17;423] REPORTING, HUGH WOULD A
[000:09:18;891] STATEMENT LIKE THIS IN THAT
[000:09:21;160] SETTING, ACCOMPANIED BY THAT
[000:09:22;562] WORLD LEADER, BE RECEIVED IN
[000:09:27;533] TEHRAN, MOSCOW, DAMASCUS?
[000:09:30;336] >> I THINK WITH SOME UN
[000:09:35;408] CERTAINTY.
[000:09:35;841] PEOPLE ARE HEARTENED TO HEAR THE
[000:09:38;477] PRESIDENT SO FORCEFULLY, TALKING
[000:09:40;012] IN EMOTIONAL TERMS ABOUT THE
[000:09:41;781] VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK.
[000:09:43;082] BUT TALK IS TALK.
[000:09:44;283] REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE
[000:09:45;618] IS THERE GOING TO BE A
[000:09:47;653] DIFFERENCE FROM THE OBAMA
[000:09:48;921] ADMINISTRATION IN WHAT ACTUALLY
[000:09:50;623] HAPPENS ON THE GROUND.
[000:09:51;691] IS THE U.S. GOING TO TRY TO
[000:09:55;094] STRIKE ASSAD TO DEAL WITH HIS
[000:09:57;063] ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE
[000:09:59;599] ATTACKS.
[000:09:59;932] PRESIDENT TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED,
[000:10:02;501] HE'S BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO FIRE
[000:10:04;670] THE U.S. IN CONFLICTS IN THE
[000:10:06;872] MIDDLE EAST BUT HE HAS SAID HIS
[000:10:09;141] VIEW HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
[000:10:11;577] IT'S EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER THIS
[000:10:13;446] WILL AFFECT HOW TRUMP IS
[000:10:14;680] AFFECTING THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA
[000:10:15;748] AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE
[000:10:17;383] ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN SYRIA,
[000:10:18;784] WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID
[000:10:19;885] IS HIS TOP PRIORITY.
[000:10:22;655] >> JOSH LEDDERMAN AT THE WHITE
[000:10:24;624] HOUSE.
[000:10:24;924] THANK YOU.
[000:10:27;193] LET'S GO TO CHARLES HANDLEMAN
[000:10:29;962] FROM THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE IN
[000:10:32;031] WASHINGTON.
[000:10:32;431] WHAT DOES THIS SIGNAL TO YOU AND
[000:10:33;599] HOW WOULD THIS SIGNAL BE
[000:10:35;601] RECEIVED IN YOUR MIND IN THOSE
[000:10:38;404] CAPITOLS OF DAMASCUS, MOSCOW AND
[000:10:41;474] BEYOND?
[000:10:41;807] >> THERE ARE WAYS FOR.
[000:10:43;476] TRUMP TO BE VERY TOUGH ON ASSAD
[000:10:45;711] WITHOUT CHANGING HIS PREVIOUS
[000:10:47;313] POLICY.
[000:10:48;080] I AGREE WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT
[000:10:49;281] YOU WERE JUST ENGAGED IN WITH
[000:10:51;384] YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS ON
[000:10:53;285] WHETHER TRUMP HAS TAKEN A WHOLE
[000:10:54;520] NEW PERSPECTIVE ON ASSAD.
[000:10:56;288] CLEARLY HE HAS.
[000:10:57;256] BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN HE NEEDS TO
[000:10:59;959] MAKE ASSAD THE FOCUS OPEN
[000:11:02;361] AMERICAN REGIME CHANGE.
[000:11:03;262] WE HAVE ATTEMPTED THAT FOR SIX
[000:11:05;998] YEARS.
[000:11:06;298] IT HASN'T WORKED.
[000:11:07;299] WE'VE HAD THAT AS OUR FORMAL
[000:11:10;369] POLICY SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:11:11;537] ARTICULATED THAT IN 2007.
[000:11:13;339] WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD SAY,
[000:11:14;674] I WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFE
[000:11:17;677] HAVENS THAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT.
[000:11:19;445] TURN THEM INTO AUTONOMOUS PARTS
[000:11:21;814] OF SYRIA OVER TIME AND HELP THE
[000:11:24;450] REGIONS IF WE EVER GET TO A
[000:11:26;752] PEACEFUL PERIOD TO HELP
[000:11:27;820] RECONSTRUCT THEMSELVES, HE
[000:11:29;021] DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY MONEY
[000:11:30;423] OR DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT AND HOPE
[000:11:38;130] THAT SOME OTHER PROCESS PUSHES
[000:11:39;965] HIM OUT OF POWER.
[000:11:41;367] THAT MAY NOT WORK ANY TIME SOON
[000:11:43;102] BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UN PRECEDE
[000:11:49;208] PRECEDENTED.
[000:11:49;608] LIKE SERBIA AND BOSNIA AND
[000:11:51;911] KOSOVO.
[000:11:52;244] WE DID NOT MAKE REGIME CHANGE A
[000:11:54;447] FOREIGN POLICY GOAL.
[000:12:00;152] HIS OWN PEOPLE UNSEEDED HIM AND
[000:12:02;154] ENDED UP IN A WAR TIMES TRIAL
[000:12:06;892] BEFORE HIS DEATH.
[000:12:07;693] THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO
[000:12:09;361] THINK THIS THROUGH THAT ALLOW
[000:12:10;696] YOU TO BE TOUGH ON ASSAD AND
[000:12:15;634] KNOW IT'S TOUGH TO OVERTHROW
[000:12:17;937] HIM.
[000:12:18;237] >> Shepard: IT'S HARD TO KNOW
[000:12:19;872] WHAT HAS CHANGED.
[000:12:20;873] IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE
[000:12:22;441] SYRIAN REGIMES TO USE BARREL
[000:12:24;343] BOMBS TO KILL BABIES IN THEIR
[000:12:26;178] BEDS BY THE HUNDREDS OF
[000:12:27;847] THOUSANDS IN WHAT IS
[000:12:29;782] UNQUESTIONABLY A SERIES OF WAR
[000:12:32;251] CRIMES.
[000:12:32;585] NOW THERE'S VIDEO OF THIS AS
[000:12:34;320] HORRIFIC AS IT IS, THERE IS NO
[000:12:37;323] CHANGE IN ACTION AND ATTITUDE.
[000:12:39;024] THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A
[000:12:41;093] THEME.
[000:12:41;393] >> I AGREE WITH THAT 100%.
[000:12:43;662] I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS
[000:12:45;164] THE EDUCATION OF AN AMERICAN
[000:12:46;632] PRESIDENT.
[000:12:46;999] ALL OF US HAS BEEN HARDENED BY
[000:12:49;135] THE WARS OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO
[000:12:50;503] THE POINT THAT IT WAS EASIER TO
[000:12:52;004] FRANKLY TURN OFF THE TELEVISION
[000:12:53;405] AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THESE
[000:12:55;441] TRAGEDIES BECAUSE WE BEGAN TO
[000:12:56;776] DOUBT IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING
[000:12:58;477] ABOUT THEM ANYWAY.
[000:12:59;245] OF COURSE, FOR MANY REPUBLICANS,
[000:13:01;180] IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
[000:13:02;081] POLICIES THAT WERE CAUSING THE
[000:13:03;482] PROBLEMS PREVIOUSLY.
[000:13:05;117] WE'VE HEARD SEAN SPICER SAY THAT
[000:13:07;653] THIS WEEK.
[000:13:08;521] BUT TODAY OR YESTERDAY,
[000:13:09;822] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO CONFRONT
[000:13:11;323] THIS VISUAL BEFORE HIS OWN EYES
[000:13:13;192] ON HIS WATCH.
[000:13:14;660] I THINK IT'S GOT TO FEEL
[000:13:15;761] DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN
[000:13:17;229] THAT OVAL OFFICE THAN IT WOULD
[000:13:18;764] HAVE EVER FELT AS A CONSUMER OF
[000:13:20;666] THE NECESSARY.
[000:13:21;167] THAT'S WHAT'S CHANGED.
[000:13:22;368] IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH MR. TRUMP
[000:13:24;503] HIMSELF HAS BECOME ENGAGED IN
[000:13:26;338] THE WHOLE PROCESS.
[000:13:27;239] >> Shepard: THANKS, MICHAEL.
[000:13:28;707] I APPRECIATE IT.
[000:13:30;075] THE PRESIDENT NOW TELLS "THE NEW
[000:13:31;544] YORK TIMES" WITH NO EVIDENCE TO
[000:13:32;545] BACK IT UP THAT THE FORMER
[000:13:35;080] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR SUSAN
[000:13:36;682] RICE MAY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME.
[000:13:42;321] THE IDENTITIES WERE REVEALED IN
[000:13:45;191] INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AFTER THEY
[000:13:46;926] WERE MENTIONED IN INTERCEPTED
[000:13:50;062] COMMUNICATIO
[000:13:53;365] COMMUNICATIONS.
[000:13:53;833] THE PRESIDENT DID NOT OFFER A
[000:13:54;567] SLIVER OF EVIDENCE AND REFUSED
[000:13:55;768] TO SAY IF HE'S SEEN ANY NEW
[000:13:57;403] INTELLIGENCE THAT WOULD BACK
[000:13:58;137] THIS UP.
[000:13:58;838] THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX
[000:14:02;975] NEWS DECK ON A WEDNESDAY
[000:14:03;876] AFTERNOON.
[000:16:04;830] Over hereNo!ver here!
[000:16:07;099] (Dog barking)
[000:16:09;268] Whoever threw it
[000:16:09;268] has to go get it.
[000:16:11;637] Not me!
[000:16:11;637] Somebody will get it...
[000:16:13;639] ♪
[000:16:16;408] (Dog barking)
[000:16:20;012] Anyone can dream.
[000:16:22;281] Making it a reality
[000:16:22;281] is the hard part.
[000:16:24;616] From the B-2 to
[000:16:24;616] the upcoming B-21,
[000:16:26;819] Northrop Grumman
[000:16:26;819] stealth bombers give
[000:16:28;087] America an advantage
[000:16:28;087] in a turbulent world.
[000:16:30;522] And we're looking for a
[000:16:30;522] few dreamers to join us.
[000:16:37;363] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS
[000:16:38;130] HE THINKS THE FORMER NATIONAL
[000:16:40;566] SECURITY ADVISERS SUSAN RICE MAY
[000:16:42;768] HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME WHEN SHE
[000:16:43;869] ASKED FOR THE NAMES OF THE
[000:16:45;471] PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN FOREIGN
[000:16:49;742] SURVEILLANCE.
[000:16:50;175] THE NEW YORK TIMES BROKE THE
[000:16:52;978] STORY.
[000:16:53;445] THE TIMES REPORTS THE PRESIDENT
[000:17:01;086] DID NOT SUPPORT ANY OWED TO
[000:17:04;490] SUPPORT HIS CLAIMS.EY WERE SURV
[000:17:08;927] TARGETS AND THE NAMES OF PEOPLE
[000:17:10;529] WITHIN TRUMP'S ORBIT SHOWED UP.
[000:17:12;898] ANALYSTS SAY IT IS LEGAL FOR A
[000:17:14;967] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TO ASK
[000:17:16;735] FOR THE NAMES OF AMERICANS
[000:17:18;437] MENTIONED IN INTELLIGENCE
[000:17:19;638] REPORTS.
[000:17:20;406] SHE SAYS THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.
[000:17:22;041] RICE SAID SHE HAD TO DO THAT AS
[000:17:23;609] PART OF HER JOB.
[000:17:24;676] SHE DENIED SHE LEAKED ANY
[000:17:27;246] INFORMATION TO ANYONE.
[000:17:28;347] SO FAR THERE IS NO PROOF OF ANY
[000:17:30;449] KIND OF WHICH FOX NEWS IS AWARE
[000:17:32;051] THAT SHE DID.
[000:17:33;752] THE CHIEF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
[000:17:36;188] CORRESPONDENCE CATHERINE
[000:17:36;822] HERRIDGE IS IN WASHINGTON.
[000:17:37;790] HOW DOES THIS UNMASKING WORK?
[000:17:40;826] >> OKAY.
[000:17:41;960] UNMASKING IS A SIMPLE PROCESS.
[000:17:44;129] IN THIS CASE, THE NATIONAL
[000:17:46;365] SECURITY ADVISER, SUSAN RICE,
[000:17:49;268] WOULD HAVE CONTACTED THE NSA,
[000:17:51;103] THE AGENCY THAT RUNS
[000:17:53;305] SURVEILLANCE AND ASKED TO HAVE
[000:17:55;774] U.S. PERSON 1 OR AMERICAN 1
[000:17:57;609] IDENTIFIED BY THEIR NAME.
[000:17:58;811] THE NSA WOULD HAVE TO BE
[000:18:01;213] SATISFIED THAT THIS IS A
[000:18:03;515] REASONABLE RE-QUEST AND HAS A
[000:18:05;884] NATIONAL SECURITY FOUNDATION FOR
[000:18:07;453] THEM TO IDENTIFY THAT AMERICAN.
[000:18:09;788] WHAT IS ILLEGAL HERE IS IF THOSE
[000:18:12;658] NAMES, ONCE THEY'RE IDENTIFIED,
[000:18:14;460] ARE THEN GIVEN TO THE MEDIA OR
[000:18:17;663] TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T HAVE A
[000:18:19;498] NEED TO KNOW.
[000:18:20;399] THERE'S ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT ON
[000:18:22;568] THIS, WHICH DOES RAISE QUESTIONS
[000:18:24;069] ABOUT WHAT SUSAN RICE SAID TO
[000:18:26;705] NBC YESTERDAY.
[000:18:27;306] SHE SAID THIS WAS ALL IN THE
[000:18:29;007] COURSE OF THE RUSSIA
[000:18:30;909] INVESTIGATION.
[000:18:31;343] WHILE WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY
[000:18:32;444] REVIEW THE DOCUMENTS,
[000:18:34;546] CONGRESSMAN PETER KING, A
[000:18:36;548] REPUBLICAN ON THE HOUSE
[000:18:37;749] INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS
[000:18:38;717] BRIEFED ON THE DOCUMENTS AND HE
[000:18:40;385] SAID NOTHING IN THEM RELATED TO
[000:18:41;587] RUSSIA AND THE DETAILS WERE
[000:18:46;658] HIGHLY PERSONAL IN NATURE.
[000:18:48;527] >> THIS IS INFORMATION ABOUT
[000:18:50;829] EVERYDAY LIVES, WHO THEY WERE
[000:18:52;965] TALKING TO, MEETING TO EAT,
[000:18:54;399] NOTHING OF ANY SUBSTANCE OF
[000:18:58;537] VALUE UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO
[000:19:00;839] LAY SOMETHING OUT ON SOMEBODY.
[000:19:02;741] >> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH
[000:19:04;510] CONCLUSIONS WHO HAS MORE MERIT
[000:19:05;644] TO THE STORY UNTIL WE CAN SEE
[000:19:07;513] THE DOCUMENTS, IF THEY'RE EVER
[000:19:09;481] DECLASSIFIED.
[000:19:10;449] THIS SEEMS TO ME A CLASSIC CASE
[000:19:12;551] OF THE GLASS BEING HALF FULL,
[000:19:15;754] HALF EMPTY.
[000:19:16;622] THOSE THAT SUPPORT THE OBAMA
[000:19:18;690] ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY WERE
[000:19:20;092] DOING DUE DILIGENCE.
[000:19:21;660] THOSE THAT SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT
[000:19:23;662] SAID IT AMOUNTED TO POLITICAL
[000:19:26;031] SPYING.
[000:19:26;365] >> Shepard: MIGHT SHE BE CALLED
[000:19:27;366] AS A WITNESS?
[000:19:28;167] >> IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY.
[000:19:29;668] WE HEARD FROM A RANKING
[000:19:31;203] DEMOCRAT.
[000:19:31;570] HE WAS SPOKING TO CNN THIS
[000:19:32;671] MORNING AND HE SAID THAT THEY
[000:19:33;805] WOULD BE OPEN TO HAVING RICE
[000:19:35;641] TESTIFY, BUT HE DIDN'T SPEAK TO
[000:19:36;708] THE MERITS OF WHAT HER TESTIMONY
[000:19:40;012] WOULD BE.
[000:19:40;979] >> THAT'S A FAR CRY FROM ANY
[000:19:44;750] SUGGESTION THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS
[000:19:46;685] WIRETAPPING DONALD TRUMP.
[000:19:48;187] THEY'RE TRYING TO THROW UP THIS
[000:19:49;988] SMOKE SCREEN IN AN EFFORT NOT
[000:19:51;123] ONLY TO DIVERT THE ATTENTION OF
[000:19:52;758] OUR COMMITTEE FROM THE RUSSIAN
[000:19:54;626] INVESTIGATION BUT TO SOMEHOW
[000:19:56;862] JUSTIFY THESE UNJUSTIFIABLE
[000:19:59;631] COMMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT.
[000:20:01;266] >> THAT WASN'T THE SOUND BITE I
[000:20:02;601] WAS EXPECTING.
[000:20:03;702] HE SAID THAT HE WAS OPEN TO
[000:20:05;370] HAVING HER.
[000:20:06;004] RIGHT THERE HE'S SAYING THIS IS
[000:20:07;172] AN EFFORT BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO
[000:20:18;217] CHANGE THE MEANING.
[000:20:20;219] HE SAID HE WOULD BE OPEN TO
[000:20:21;653] HAVING RICE TESTIFY BUT IT'S
[000:20:22;821] GOING TO DEPENDS ON WHAT THEY
[000:20:24;356] FIND IN THE COURSE OF THEIR
[000:20:26;959] INVESTIGATION.
[000:20:27;392] SUSAN RICE SAYS SHE NEEDS TO SEE
[000:20:29;595] HOW THINGS DEVELOP BEFORE SHE
[000:20:30;629] WOULD MAKE THAT KIND OF
[000:20:32;331] COMMITMENT.
[000:20:32;731] >> Shepard: CATHERINE HERRIDGE
[000:20:33;498] IN WASHINGTON, THANK YOU.
[000:20:34;700] >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
[000:20:35;434] >> Shepard: AT THE ROOT OF THIS,
[000:20:36;668] THE RUSSIANS INTERFERED IN THE
[000:20:38;503] UNITED STATES PRESIDENTIAL
[000:20:39;504] ELECTION.
[000:20:39;871] THAT IS NOT IN QUESTION.
[000:20:41;406] THEY WORKED TO HELP DONALD
[000:20:42;941] TRUMP'S CHANCES OF BECOMING
[000:20:44;209] QUESTION AND HURTING HILLARY
[000:20:45;644] CLINTON'S CHANCES.
[000:20:46;511] THERE'S THREE SEPARATE
[000:20:48;013] INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS NOW IN
[000:20:48;814] THE HOUSE, THE SENATE AND BY THE
[000:20:50;849] FBI ON A CRIMINAL LEVEL AND THE
[000:20:53;485] QUESTION REMAINS WAS THERE
[000:20:56;521] COLLUSION BETWEEN TEAM TRUMP AND
[000:20:57;489] THE EFFORTS TO INTERFERE IN THE
[000:21:01;693] ELECTION.
[000:21:02;060] THAT'S THE MATTER BEING
[000:21:04;029] INVESTIGATED.
[000:21:04;463] THE NEWS CONTINUES AFTER THIS.

[000:22:21;573] You need one of these.

[000:22:24;076] that covers you part way,
[000:22:27;713] so when it comes to
[000:22:27;713] pain relievers,

[000:23:19;214] Your insurance company
[000:23:20;248] raises your rates.

[000:24:26;314] FATHER, HE KNOWS IT.
[000:24:27;816] PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDED TO
[000:24:29;518] QUESTIONS WHY SHE HASN'T COME
[000:24:31;219] OUT AGAINST SOME OF HER FATHER'S
[000:24:33;788] AGENDA.
[000:24:34;122] >> I RESPECT THE FACT THAT HE
[000:24:35;624] ALWAYS LICENSE.
[000:24:36;291] THAT'S HOW HE WAS IN BUSINESS,
[000:24:38;126] THAT'S HOW HE IS AS PRESIDENT.
[000:24:39;327] I SPEAK UP FREQUENTLY.
[000:24:41;463] MY FATHER AGREES WITH ME ON SO
[000:24:43;265] MANY ISSUES.
[000:24:44;232] WHERE HE DOESN'T, HE KNOWS WHERE
[000:24:46;034] I STAND.

[000:24:52;807] AN UNPAID ROLE IN THE WHITE

[000:24:54;910] AFTER THE ELECTION, SHE SAID SHE
[000:24:56;645] WOULD NOT BE WORKING IN THE
[000:24:59;014] ADMINISTRATION.
[000:24:59;481] SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED HER
[000:25:00;448] SAYING SHE WAS ADVISING THE
[000:25:02;684] PRESIDENT WITHOUT HAVING
[000:25:03;885] GOVERNMENT ETHIC RULES.
[000:25:05;687] SHE SAID SHE TOOK THE OFFICIAL
[000:25:07;522] TITLE TO SHOW SHE'S HOLDING
[000:25:09;191] HERSELF TO THE HIGHEST ETHICAL
[000:25:11;359] STANDARDS.
[000:25:11;760] JONATHAN HUNT WITH THIS.
[000:25:12;727] WHAT ELSE DID THE FIRST DAUGHTER
[000:25:14;629] HAVE TO SAY?
[000:25:15;697] >> WELL, SHEP, THE MAIN FOCUS IS
[000:25:18;200] THIS ISSUE OF NOT SPEAKING OUT
[000:25:23;171] PUBLICLY.
[000:25:24;873] IVANKA TRUMP SAID PUBLIC SILENCE
[000:25:26;808] DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S SILENT IN
[000:25:28;476] PRIVATE.
[000:25:29;311] >> I THINK THERE'S MULTIPLE WAYS
[000:25:32;280] TO HAVE YOUR VOICE HEARD.
[000:25:33;682] IN SOME CASES, IT'S PROTEST,
[000:25:35;517] GOING ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS AND
[000:25:38;086] TALKING ABOUT OR DENOUNCING
[000:25:39;621] EVERY ISSUE YOU DISAGREE WITH.
[000:25:43;725] OTHER TIMES IT'S QUIETLY AND
[000:25:46;094] DIRECTLY AN CANDIDLY.
[000:25:49;164] >> SHE WAS ASKED IF SHE FELT
[000:25:51;233] COMPLICIT AS SHE'S BEING
[000:25:54;803] PARODIED AS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:25:56;404] HARSHER POLICIES.
[000:25:57;539] >> IF BEING COMPLICIT IS WANTING
[000:26:00;508] TO BE A FORCE FOR GOOD AND TO
[000:26:03;044] MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT, THEN I'M
[000:26:08;817] COMPLICIT.
[000:26:10;518] I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CRITICS
[000:26:12;120] THAT MAY SAY THAT OF ME, IF THEY

[000:26:15;423] AND UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION THAT
[000:26:17;092] I'M NOW IN WOULD DO ANY
[000:26:19;628] DIFFERENTLY THAN I'M DOING.

[000:26:22;364] THAT ANSWER IN PARTICULAR
[000:26:23;565] SOUNDED LIKE A YOUNG WOMAN STILL
[000:26:25;634] WORKING HER WAY THROUGH WHAT IS,
[000:26:26;935] AS SHE PUT IT, AN UNPRECEDENTED
[000:26:30;005] SITUATION.

[000:27:29;531] ITS DICTATOR A BIG PROBLEM IN
[000:27:31;466] THE WAKE OF THE LATEST MISSILE
[000:27:33;702] LAUNCH.
[000:27:34;035] IT ALSO COMES AHEAD OF A VERY
[000:27:36;104] IMPORTANT MEETING BETWEEN
[000:27:37;005] PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHINA'S
[000:27:39;474] LEADER.
[000:27:39;908] REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID
[000:27:41;509] THAT THE UNITED STATES IS READY
[000:27:42;777] TO GO IT ALONE IN NORTH KOREA IF
[000:27:45;146] NECESSARY.
[000:27:45;547] SO WHAT TO EXPECT NOW?
[000:27:47;549] WE'RE APPROACHING THE BOTTOM OF
[000:27:48;950] THE HOUR AND THE TOP OF THE
[000:27:49;651] NEWS.
[000:27:50;719] Ooh...
[000:28:53;047] Psst.
[000:28:53;715] Hey...
[000:28:54;816] ...where you going?
[000:28:55;950] We've got that thing!
[000:28:56;951] You know...Diarrhea?
[000:28:58;219] Abdominal pain?
[000:28:59;454] But we said we'd be there...
[000:29:00;555] Woap, who makes the
[000:29:00;555] decisions around here?
[000:29:02;857] It's me.
[000:29:04;058] Don't think I'll make it.
[000:29:06;027] Stomach again...Send!
[000:29:07;796] If you're living with frequent,
[000:29:08;930] unpredictable diarrhea
[000:29:08;930] and abdominal pain,
[000:29:10;965] you may have Irritable Bowel
[000:29:10;965] Syndrome with Diarrhea
[000:29:13;668] or IBS-D - a condition that can
[000:29:13;668] be really frustrating.
[000:29:16;871] Talk to your doctor
[000:29:16;871] about VIBERZI...
[000:29:18;406] a different way to treat IBS-D.
[000:29:19;741] VIBERZI is a
[000:29:19;741] prescription medication
[000:29:21;543] you take every day
[000:29:22;710] that helps proactively manage
[000:29:24;212] both diarrhea and abdominal pain
[000:29:25;980] at the same time.
[000:29:26;948] So you stay ahead
[000:29:26;948] of your symptoms.
[000:29:28;583] VIBERZI can cause new or
[000:29:28;583] worsening abdominal pain.
[000:29:31;019] Do not take VIBERZI if you have
[000:29:31;019] or may have had:
[000:29:33;054] pancreas or
[000:29:33;054] severe liver problems,
[000:29:34;389] problems with alcohol abuse,
[000:29:35;557] long-lasting or
[000:29:35;557] severe constipation,
[000:29:38;059] or a blockage of your bowel
[000:29:38;059] or gallbladder.
[000:29:39;794] If you are taking VIBERZI,
[000:29:41;162] you should not take medicines
[000:29:41;162] that cause constipation.
[000:29:43;097] The most common side effects of
[000:29:43;097] VIBERZI include
[000:29:44;799] constipation, nausea, and
[000:29:44;799] abdominal pain.
[000:29:48;102] Stay ahead of IBS-D
[000:29:49;971] with VIBERZI.

[000:30:08;990] MISSION.

[000:30:44;893] THERE'S NO REPORTS OF ANY

[000:30:47;328] A FIRE DEPARTMENT TOLD LOCAL

[000:30:58;172] ♪ Tresiba® ready ♪
[000:31:00;141] Tresiba®

[000:31:01;609] long-acting
[000:31:01;609] insulin
[000:31:02;977] that lasts
[000:31:02;977] even longer
[000:31:04;279] than 24 hours.

[000:31:09;918] Tresiba® works
[000:31:10;919] like my body's

[000:31:11;920] Releases slow

[000:31:13;121] providing
[000:31:14;122] powerful
[000:31:14;122] A1C reduction.
[000:31:15;657] I'm always on call.
[000:31:16;991] An insulin that fits
[000:31:16;991] my schedule is key.
[000:31:19;928] ♪ Tresiba® ready ♪
[000:31:22;130] I can take Tresiba®
[000:31:22;130] any time of day.
[000:31:24;098] So if I miss
[000:31:24;098] or delay a dose,
[000:31:25;533] I take it when I remember,
[000:31:26;834] as long as there's at least
[000:31:26;834] 8 hours between doses.
[000:31:29;304] Once in use,
[000:31:29;304] it lasts 8 weeks
[000:31:30;939] with or without
[000:31:30;939] refrigeration,
[000:31:32;574] twice as long
[000:31:32;574] as the Lantus® Pen.
[000:31:34;676] (announcer) Tresiba® is used
[000:31:34;676] to control high blood sugar
[000:31:36;077] in adults with diabetes.
[000:31:37;445] Don't use Tresiba® to treat
[000:31:37;445] diabetic ketoacidosis,
[000:31:39;814] during episodes
[000:31:39;814] of low blood sugar,
[000:31:41;382] or if you are allergic to any
[000:31:41;382] of its ingredients.
[000:31:43;551] Don't share needles
[000:31:44;552] or insulin pens.
[000:31:45;553] Don't reuse needles.
[000:31:46;821] The most common side effect
[000:31:46;821] is low blood sugar,
[000:31:48;523] which may cause dizziness,
[000:31:49;791] sweating, confusion,
[000:31:49;791] and headache.
[000:31:51;526] Check your blood sugar.
[000:31:52;961] Low blood sugar can be serious
[000:31:52;961] and may be life-threatening.
[000:31:55;063] Injection site reactions
[000:31:55;063] may occur.
[000:31:56;898] Tell your prescriber
[000:31:56;898] about all medicines you take
[000:31:58;566] and all your medical
[000:31:58;566] conditions.
[000:31:59;867] Taking TZDs
[000:31:59;867] with insulins like Tresiba®
[000:32:02;003] may cause serious side effects
[000:32:02;003] like heart failure.
[000:32:04;138] Your insulin dose
[000:32:04;138] shouldn't be changed
[000:32:05;406] without
[000:32:05;406] asking your prescriber.

[000:36:52;326] INDICATING HE SHOULD HAVE DONE
[000:36:53;327] SOMETHING.
[000:36:53;694] THAT IS A THREAT.
[000:36:54;528] MAYBE MORE SUBTLE, BUT CLEARLY
[000:36:57;899] ASSAD UNDERSTANDS WHAT HE'S
[000:36:59;533] TALKING ABOUT.
[000:37:00;801] >> AND DOES KIM JONG-UN TAKE
[000:37:02;637] SOMETHING FROM THAT?
[000:37:03;371] DO WE HAVE A WAY TO KNOW?
[000:37:06;374] >> Shepard: WHAT KIM JONG-UN
[000:37:07;108] WOULD DO, HE HAS LINKS WITH IRAN
[000:37:08;876] AND SYRIA WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED.
[000:37:10;378] THAT I HAVE CHINA IN THE
[000:37:11;646] BACKGROUND.
[000:37:12;046] THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IF HE
[000:37:13;147] THINKS THE U.S. IS GOING TO
[000:37:15;216] COMMIT MILITARY FORCE IN THE
[000:37:16;484] MIDDLE EAST, HE KNOWS THAT WE'RE
[000:37:18;119] NOT GOING TO DO VERY MUCH IN
[000:37:20;154] NORTH ASIA, WHICH MEANS HE COULD
[000:37:23;090] STARTING A PROVOCATION AGAINST
[000:37:25;126] SOUTH KOREA.
[000:37:25;559] THAT'S HOW THESE THINGS REALLY
[000:37:27;895] SORT OF SPREAD FROM ONE REGION
[000:37:30;531] TO THE OTHER.
[000:37:32;500] THIS LOOKS LIKE 1914 WHEN THINGS
[000:37:35;136] GET OUT OF CONTROL.
[000:37:36;537] >> Shepard: IS THAT HOW IT
[000:37:37;738] FEELS?
[000:37:38;039] >> VERY MUCH SO.
[000:37:39;807] CLEARLY TWO PREDECESSORS DEALT
[000:37:42;276] HIM A BAD HAND.
[000:37:43;210] YOU HAVE A SITUATION RIGHT NOW
[000:37:44;679] THAT IS VOLATILE.
[000:37:45;646] ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.
[000:37:48;449] THAT IS THE REASON WRITE THE
[000:37:50;017] CHINESE PRESIDENT IS
[000:37:51;986] CONSEQUENTIAL.
[000:37:52;420] THEY'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT
[000:37:54;488] THE USE OF FORCE IN NORTH KOREA.
[000:37:57;258] >> A KOREAN WAR, ANOTHER KOREAN
[000:37:59;694] WAR, COULD BE THE DEATH OF
[000:38:01;929] MILLIONS.
[000:38:02;296] >> CLEARLY.
[000:38:03;931] YOU HAVE 25 MILLION SOUTH
[000:38:07;234] KOREANS THAT LIVE IN SEOUL.
[000:38:09;403] NORTH KOREA HAS THE WORLD'S
[000:38:10;638] FOURTH LARGEST ARMY.
[000:38:11;706] ABOUT 70% OF THAT ARMY IS FOR
[000:38:14;976] WARNED DEPLOYED BY THE DMZ.
[000:38:18;112] THEY HAVE HIGH EXPLOSIVES,
[000:38:19;914] CHEMICAL WEAPONS, BIOLOGICAL
[000:38:22;450] AGENTS AND NUKES.
[000:38:23;517] THE CASUALTIES ON THE FIRST
[000:38:25;419] HOURS WOULD BE IN THE HUNDREDS
[000:38:26;721] OF THOUSANDS.
[000:38:27;989] YOU TALK ABOUT A FULL SCARE WAR,
[000:38:29;623] WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
[000:38:31;826] THIS BEFORE.
[000:38:32;393] >> Shepard: AND CHINA CAN HELP
[000:38:33;728] US HOW?
[000:38:35;196] >> CHINA CAN HELP US.
[000:38:36;864] THEY CAN CUT OFF NORTH KOREA'S
[000:38:39;233] FLOWS OF CASH.
[000:38:40;234] >> Shepard: MONEY.
[000:38:40;801] >> BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE NOT GOING
[000:38:42;036] TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE
[000:38:44;271] BEEN BEHIND NORTH KOREA.
[000:38:45;406] THEY'VE GIVEN THEM MUCH OF THE
[000:38:47;708] TECHNOLOGY.
[000:38:48;109] FOR INSTANCE, THEIR MOBILE
[000:38:49;877] MISSILES ARE RIDING ON CHINESE
[000:38:51;579] LAUNCHES AND THE MISSILES THAT
[000:38:58;652] NORTH KOREA TESTED LOOK SIMILAR
[000:39:00;021] TO THE JL-1.
[000:39:02;790] TRUMP NEEDS TO ASK THEM HOW THAT
[000:39:04;725] HAPPENED.
[000:39:05;092] >> Shepard: THANK YOU.
[000:39:05;793] >> THANK YOU.
[000:39:06;961] >> Shepard: MORE THAN 100 NAVY
[000:39:08;863] INSTRUCTOR PILOTS HAVE GONE ON
[000:39:11;532] STRIKE REFUSING TO FLY SINCE
[000:39:13;300] LATE LAST WEEK.
[000:39:14;268] THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE
[000:39:16;003] EXCLUSIVE REPORTING OF OUR
[000:39:18;439] JENNIFER GRIFFIN.
[000:39:18;939] THE NAVY IS NOW RESPONDED BY
[000:39:22;076] GROUNDING SOME TRAINING JETS.
[000:39:23;377] FOX REPORTS THE INSTRUCTOR
[000:39:25;212] PILOTS SAY THAT THEY'RE UPSET
[000:39:27;715] BECAUSE DEFENSE OFFICIALS HAVE
[000:39:29;316] FAILED TO FIX AN ISSUE WITH THE
[000:39:31;018] OXYGEN SYSTEMS ON THEIR TRAINING
[000:39:32;953] JETS.
[000:39:33;354] MULTIPLE FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS HAVE
[000:39:35;556] TOLD FOX NEWS THAT POISON IN THE
[000:39:38;059] OXYGEN SYSTEMS CAN STRIKE
[000:39:39;393] WITHOUT WARNING CAUSING THEM TO
[000:39:41;362] BECOME DISORIENTED.
[000:39:42;963] NAVY OFFICIALS HAVE ADMITTED TO
[000:39:45;099] FOX NEWS THAT THE OXYGEN SYSTEMS
[000:39:46;834] ARE A PROBLEM AND THAT THEY ARE
[000:39:48;235] WORKING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.
[000:39:50;204] REPORTERS GRIFFIN AND TOMLINSON
[000:39:52;873] WERE ADVISING VICE PRESIDENT
[000:39:53;974] MIKE PENCE'S SON, THE MARINE
[000:39:57;311] FIRST LIEUTENANT, MICHAEL PENCE,
[000:39:58;546] IS AMONG THE HUNDREDS OF
[000:39:59;880] STUDENTS PILOTS THE STRIKE HAS
[000:40:01;715] AFFECTED.
[000:40:02;083] NOW FOR A LIVE LOOK AT THE DOW.
[000:40:04;218] WHEN THE PRESIDENT SPOKE EARLIER
[000:40:05;853] TODAY, THE DOW WAS UP ABOUT 160
[000:40:08;322] POINTS.
[000:40:08;856] SINCE THEN, IT HAS NOSE DIVED
[000:40:11;392] AFTER A NEW REPORT THAT CLAIMED
[000:40:17;198] THAT AMERICAN BUSINESS ADDED
[000:40:19;433] 263,000 JOBS LAST MONTH.
[000:40:20;468] THAT'S ACCORDING TO ADP A
[000:40:21;836] COMPANY THAT PROCESSES PAYROLL.
[000:40:23;404] THAT'S NEARLY 80,000 MORE JOBS
[000:40:25;439] THAN ANALYSTS PREDICTED.
[000:40:27;341] THAT'S WHY THE MARKET WENT UP
[000:40:28;476] THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE
[000:40:29;677] AFTERNOON.
[000:40:30;044] THIS IS A GRAPH OF THE ADP'S JOB
[000:40:33;013] NUMBERS SINCE THE RECESSION.
[000:40:35;216] THE LABOR DEPARTMENT'S OFFICIAL
[000:40:37;518] MONTHLY JOBS REPORT CAME OUT
[000:40:38;619] FRIDAY.
[000:40:38;953] IN THE PAST, THE ADP'S NUMBERS
[000:40:41;288] HAVE DIFFERENT FROM THE
[000:40:42;623] GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL COUNT.
[000:40:43;491] THE BIG NEWS HERE, WHAT HAS
[000:40:44;892] HAPPENED SINCE THE PRESIDENT
[000:40:45;960] SPOKE.
[000:40:46;460] JERRY WILLIS IS WITH US.
[000:40:48;429] THIS MOST RECENT REPORT IS AN
[000:40:50;331] INTERESTING ONE.
[000:40:50;998] TO ME, GERRI, WHAT HAS HAPPENED
[000:40:57;138] SINCE THE PRESIDENT SPOKE, A
[000:41:00;007] 180-POINT DIVE IS DIRECTLY
[000:41:02;209] RELATED, RIGHT?
[000:41:02;710] >> YEAH, SOME RELATION.
[000:41:04;044] WE STARTED OUT 180 POINTS.
[000:41:06;447] A BIG GAIN DUE TO THE ADP
[000:41:08;516] REPORT.
[000:41:08;849] WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT?
[000:41:10;951] IT'S REALLY THE CRYSTAL BALL
[000:41:15;256] FRIDAY'S JOB REPORT.
[000:41:15;990] THE NUMBERS, THE BIGGEST GAINS
[000:41:20;227] SINCE DECEMBER 2014.
[000:41:21;462] ALL EYES ON THE REPORT TODAY.
[000:41:23;130] COULDN'T HOLD THE GAINS, NOT AT
[000:41:24;598] ALL.
[000:41:24;865] LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE SECTORS
[000:41:26;500] DOING WELL HERE.
[000:41:27;768] PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.
[000:41:28;869] BY THAT, I MEAN WHITE COLLARED
[000:41:31;172] JOBS, BACK OFFICE JOBS, UP A
[000:41:33;174] BUNCH.
[000:41:33;641] HOSPITALITY LOOKING GOOD HERE.
[000:41:35;042] THAT SPEAKS WELL TO TOURISM.
[000:41:37;077] HEALTHCARE UP.
[000:41:38;412] TYPICALLY IS.
[000:41:39;280] TYPICALLY DOES WELL.
[000:41:40;214] THE SHOCKER.
[000:41:42;016] MANUFACTURING UP 30,000.
[000:41:43;450] THAT'S THE SECTOR THAT TRUMP
[000:41:44;618] TALKS ABOUT OVER AND OVER AND
[000:41:47;021] OVER AGAIN.
[000:41:49;290] OF COURSE, WE TALK ABOUT THE
[000:41:50;524] LEADING SECTORS, WE'LL SEE MORE
[000:41:53;460] DETAIL FRIDAY BECAUSE THAT'S
[000:41:54;662] WHEN WE GET PRIVATE AND PUBLIC
[000:41:56;864] SECTOR JOBS TOGETHER.
[000:41:57;731] WE'LL SEE BOTH COMING IN.
[000:42:01;001] LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HANG ON TO
[000:42:02;803] THE MEAGER GAINS AT THIS HOURS,
[000:42:04;471] WHICH ARE NOT AS GREAT.
[000:42:05;539] I HAVE TO TELL YOU, SHEP,
[000:42:08;642] LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS,
[000:42:10;277] EXPECTATIONS FOR FRIDAY, GAINS
[000:42:11;545] OF 180,000 JOBS AND WE WILL
[000:42:14;481] STICK AT 14.7%.
[000:42:17;184] THAT'S THE EXPECTATION OUT
[000:42:18;652] THERE.
[000:42:18;986] >> Shepard: YOU KNOW WHERE I'M
[000:42:19;820] GOING TO LOOK FOR YOU?
[000:42:21;322] >> WHERE'S THAT?
[000:42:22;356] >> Shepard: ON KENNEDY TONIGHT.
[000:42:24;091] FOR OUR VIEWERS THAT KNEW -- I
[000:42:26;227] WAS IN STUDIO JUST A FEW MINUTES
[000:42:28;596] AGO.
[000:42:28;896] YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT.
[000:42:30;531] >> I DIDN'T.
[000:42:31;165] >> Shepard: GERRI'S IS KENNEDY'S
[000:42:34;335] GUEST TONIGHT ON THE FOX
[000:42:35;803] BUSINESS NETWORK.
[000:42:36;937] CANDY DEAD A PROGRAM EVERY NIGHT
[000:42:38;339] AT 8:00, RIGHT?
[000:42:39;306] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:42:40;741] >> Shepard: AND A WHOLE
[000:42:41;809] DIFFERENT GERRI WILLIS.
[000:42:43;677] OUR SURVIVOR AND HERO WILL BE
[000:42:45;346] THERE TALKING ABOUT HER LIFE.
[000:42:46;513] YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.
[000:42:47;615] I KNOW 8:00 IS A BUSY HOUR FOR
[000:42:49;883] EVERYBODY, BUT IF YOU CAN'T GO
[000:42:51;185] SEE IT, DVR IT.
[000:42:55;356] >> TUNE IN.
[000:42:56;991] IT'S KENNEDY, KENNEDY, KENNEDY.
[000:43:00;761] >> Shepard: YOU CAN DVR WHATEVER
[000:43:01;795] ELSE IS GOING ON.
[000:43:02;796] YOU WANT TO SEE THIS.
[000:43:03;931] YOU GOT TO SEE IT.
[000:43:08;469] GERRI, GOD BLESS YOU.
[000:43:10;337] >> THANK YOU.
[000:43:11;005] >> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:43:12;106] TAKING ANOTHER WHACK AT
[000:43:13;907] HEALTHCARE.
[000:43:14;308] MIKE PENCE IS ON THE HILL WITH
[000:43:16;610] LAWMAKERS.
[000:43:17;211] THIS BATTLE IS STARTING TO SOUND
[000:43:18;946] LIKE A BROKEN RECORD WITH THE
[000:43:20;748] SAME OLD PROBLEM.
[000:43:21;248] HEALTHCARE NEXT.
[000:46:27;000] >> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:46:28;368] TOUTING WHAT IT CALLS PROGRESS
[000:46:29;603] ON A NEW HEALTHCARE BILL AFTER
[000:46:32;206] VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND
[000:46:33;006] MET WITH REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ON
[000:46:35;242] CAPITOL HILL LAST NIGHT.
[000:46:36;810] BUT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
[000:46:37;945] WILL NOT PUT A TIMELINE ON ANY
[000:46:40;647] OF THIS.
[000:46:42;349] CONSERVATIVE FREEDOM CAUCUS
[000:46:43;050] CHAIRMAN MARK MEADOWS SAID
[000:46:44;952] REPUBLICANS LEFT WITHOUT AN
[000:46:46;153] AGREEMENT.
[000:46:46;520] BUT BOTH CONSERVATIVE AND
[000:46:47;688] MODERATE REPUBLICANS SAID
[000:46:48;789] THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS AND THAT
[000:46:51;358] IT WAS A GOOD TALK.
[000:46:52;526] BOTH SIDES ARE AT ODDS ABOUT
[000:46:54;561] REPEALING SOME OBAMACARE
[000:46:56;029] REGULATION.
[000:46:56;430] MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS
[000:46:57;264] SAID THE LAST BILL DIDN'T GO FAR
[000:46:59;500] ENOUGH TO ROLL BACK REGULATIONS
[000:47:00;868] AND MODERATES SAY WE DON'T WANT
[000:47:02;269] TO LOSE THE BENEFITS, WHICH IS
[000:47:04;605] EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID THIS DAY
[000:47:06;206] THIS STARTED.
[000:47:07;140] THE NATIONAL REPORTER FROM
[000:47:11;345] POLITICO IS OUT.
[000:47:12;279] PAUL RYAN SAID YEAH, WE'RE
[000:47:13;914] MAKING PROGRESS BUT NO TIME
[000:47:16;016] LINE.
[000:47:16;316] IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS NOT A
[000:47:17;684] REAL THING, DOESN'T IT?
[000:47:20;821] >> IT DOES.
[000:47:21;688] IT'S CONTINUING TO HAVE THE SAME
[000:47:23;757] SORTS OF CONVERSATION.
[000:47:25;058] IT'S PROGRESS AND THEY'RE MAKING
[000:47:27;661] PROGRESS.
[000:47:28;028] BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY -- THE
[000:47:30;764] CONSERVATIVES IN THE HOUSE
[000:47:31;565] FREEDOM CAUCUS AND THE MODERATES
[000:47:33;600] IN THE TUESDAY GROUP REALLY HAVE
[000:47:37;437] FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT GOALS
[000:47:38;906] HERE.
[000:47:39;206] THE MEMBERS OF THE FREEDOM
[000:47:45;712] CAUCUS ARE PRIORITIZING
[000:47:46;947] STRIPPING BACK THE REGULATIONS
[000:47:48;181] IN THE OBAMACARE AND THEY THINK
[000:47:50;584] THE ORIGINAL BILL DIDN'T GO FAR
[000:47:52;352] ENOUGH.
[000:47:52;686] THE MODERATES IN THE TUESDAY
[000:47:53;420] GROUP HAVE A DIFFERENT PRIORITY.
[000:47:59;359] THEY WANT TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH
[000:48:01;261] INSURANCE.
[000:48:02;262] THERE'S NOT A THEORETICAL
[000:48:04;364] PROCESS THAT ONE BILL CAN'T DO
[000:48:07;501] BOTH.
[000:48:07;801] BUT WHITE HOUSE AT LEAST RIGHT
[000:48:09;336] NOW HASN'T PUT FORWARD A BILL
[000:48:12;105] THAT WOULD DO BOTH THINGS AND
[000:48:13;807] SATISFY BOTH GROUPS.
[000:48:14;675] >> SO THEY TALK AND THEY SAY
[000:48:16;310] THAT TALKING IS GOING WELL, BUT
[000:48:18;745] IT SOUNDS LIKE TO HEAR FROM PAUL
[000:48:20;781] RYAN, THEY'RE NOT GETTING
[000:48:24;151] ANYWHERE.
[000:48:24;518] THIS COMPLICATES MATTERS FOR THE
[000:48:26;320] BUDGET.
[000:48:26;653] THEY COULD HAVE SAVED $880
[000:48:29;122] BILLION.
[000:48:29;456] NOW THEY CAN'T.
[000:48:30;090] I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO BUDGET
[000:48:31;925] NOW.
[000:48:32;225] >> THAT WAS THE SPEAKER'S CASE
[000:48:34;361] FOR GOING HEALTHCARE FIRST.
[000:48:35;696] THAT BY SAVING MONEY, BY
[000:48:38;031] STRIKING A HEALTHCARE DEAL, IT
[000:48:38;932] WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DO TAX
[000:48:41;168] REFORM AND DO A BUDGET.
[000:48:42;836] BECAUSE YOU WOULD MAKE PROGRESS
[000:48:45;706] IN CHIPPING AWAY AT THE SAVINGS
[000:48:47;507] YOU'D GET FROM DOING IT.
[000:48:50;010] ONE INTERESTING THING THAT
[000:48:53;647] EMERGED FROM THE TALKS IS THAT
[000:48:55;949] THE TUESDAY GROUP AND THE
[000:48:57;417] FREEDOM CAUCUS EMERGED WITH
[000:48:59;720] DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT
[000:49:01;755] EXACTLY THIS BILL WOULD LOOK
[000:49:02;956] LIKE.
[000:49:03;256] >> Shepard: YOU KNOW HOW THAT
[000:49:05;125] HAPPENED.
[000:49:05;492] >> THE WHITE HOUSE THROUGH MIKE
[000:49:07;427] PENCE PITCHED THEM TWO DIFFERENT
[000:49:09;730] BILLS OR IF THE MEMBERS HAD
[000:49:12;599] DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS.
[000:49:14;901] BUT IF TWO DIFFERENT PIECES WERE
[000:49:17;137] PITCHED, THAT'S AN OVERSIGHT BY
[000:49:18;305] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:49:18;905] >> Shepard: WASN'T THIS A CASE
[000:49:20;507] OF WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT
[000:49:22;609] TO HEAR, DON'T LOOK?
[000:49:24;444] THEY TOLD THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE,
[000:49:26;146] YEAH, WE'RE SAVING MONEY.
[000:49:27;214] THEY TOLD THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU
[000:49:29;650] WANT IT, YOU CAN KEEP IT.
[000:49:31;284] NEITHER ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE
[000:49:32;886] TRUE AND THEY READ IT AND WENT
[000:49:35;656] WOW.
[000:49:35;956] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE READ IT AND
[000:49:38;091] 17% SUPPORTED.
[000:49:39;226] AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE
[000:49:40;627] TALKING ABOUT IT BUT NOT DOING
[000:49:41;895] ANYTHING BUT TALKING ABOUT IT.
[000:49:43;497] IS THAT FAIR?
[000:49:44;297] WHAT IS THAT?
[000:49:45;232] >> AT THE VERY LEAST, THE
[000:49:47;868] MEMBERS OF TWO GROUPS HAD
[000:49:49;970] DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDINGS WHAT
[000:49:51;238] WOULD BE IN THE LEGISLATION.
[000:49:53;106] AS MY COLLEAGUE PUT IT, IT WAS
[000:49:55;008] EITHER A CASE OF THE
[000:49:56;109] ADMINISTRATION PITCHING TWO
[000:49:58;545] DIFFERENT THINGS TO THE

[000:50:00;447] HEARING WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR
[000:50:02;182] FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT.
[000:50:03;116] WHATEVER THE CASE, NO SUCCESSFUL
[000:50:07;421] COMPROMISE REACHED.
[000:50:08;021] SO WE'RE NO FURTHER ALONG THAN

[000:54:29;449] ACCESSING INFORMATION ALMOST
[000:54:31;618] IMMEDIATELY.
[000:54:32;018] THERE'S STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT
[000:54:34;220] WE'RE COMPROMISING OUR OWN
[000:54:35;722] MEMORIES BY CONSTANTLY ACCESSING
[000:54:38;058] THINGS ON THE WEB.
[000:54:39;025] >> Shepard: THERE'S NO DOUBT.
[000:54:40;393] >> SO WHY NOT CUT OUT THE
[000:54:44;664] MIDDLEMAN AND PUT THE HARDWARE

[000:55:08;855] >> IT'S NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
[000:55:11;224] ANYTHING.
[000:55:11;591] THINK OF THE COOL STUFF THAT YOU
[000:55:13;493] CAN ACCESS AND THE INFORMATION
[000:55:15;628] YOU'LL HAVE.
[000:55:16;529] A VERY SHORT LEAP FROM HAVING
[000:55:18;231] SOME SORT OF A MECHANICAL HARD
[000:55:22;402] DRIVE IMPLANTED IN YOUR
[000:55:24;938] PHYSIOLOGY IS THE ABILITY TO
[000:55:27;273] FLY.
[000:55:27;540] HOW GREAT WOULD THAT BE?
[000:55:28;708] IT'S LIKE A LIVING, LUCID DREAM.
[000:55:31;077] YOU WON'T NEED THE MATRIX.
[000:55:32;612] YOU WON'T NEED TO BE PLUGGED IN

[000:55:38;385] TO THE GRAND CANYON NOW.
[000:55:39;753] >> WE'RE IN THE MATRIX NOW.
[000:55:42;689] >> WE COULD BE.
[000:55:43;590] THERE'S PHILOSOPHIES --
[000:55:46;192] >> Shepard: WE'RE AN ANT FARM.
[000:55:48;061] LIKE A CHILD ANT FARM SOMEWHERE
[000:55:49;829] IN ANOTHER WORLD.
[000:55:50;630] I BET THAT KID IS LAUGHING.
[000:55:54;934] I FEEL LIKE IT'S THE ONLY THING
[000:55:56;369] TO EXPLAIN IT ALL.
[000:55:57;637] WE'RE AN ANT FARM OF SOME KID --
[000:56:00;540] >> AND THAT COULD BE AN
[000:56:04;577] EXPLANATION, THAT WE ARE PART OF
[000:56:07;347] A MASSIVE COMPUTER MODEL.
[000:56:09;716] WE'RE REALLY JUST -- WHAT DID
[000:56:13;920] SPENOZA CALL HIM?
[000:56:14;754] LIKE NOADS OR SOMETHING LIKE
[000:56:16;523] THAT.
[000:56:16;823] THEY GO -- AND SET INTO MOTION
[000:56:18;491] AND WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER OUR
[000:56:19;993] LIVES.
[000:56:20;326] >> Shepard: IF WE WERE TO CALL
[000:56:22;195] I.T., THEY'D SAY UNPLUG IT AND
[000:56:24;130] PLUG IT BACK IN.
[000:56:26;366] MAYBE THAT WOULD FIX IT.

[001:00:34;180] WHAT GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES
[001:00:35;982] MANY, MANY LINES BEYOND A RED
[001:00:38;451] LINE.
[001:00:39;519] >> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
