HERE'S SHEPARD SMITH.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
>> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THE

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
WEST COAST.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
3:00 AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
STATES IS WARNING HIS FIRED FBI

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
DIRECTOR AGAINST LEAKING TO THE

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
MEDIA AND SUGGESTING THERE MAY

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
BE TAPES OF THEIR CONVERSATIONS.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
MINUTES AGO, WE HEARD FROM THE

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN ON THAT

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
LIVE ON TELEVISION, WHICH IS

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
INTERESTING CONSIDERING THE

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
PRESIDENT FLOATING THE IDEA OF

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
CANCELLING PRESS BRIEFINGS

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
BECAUSE IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
HIS PEOPLE TO BE TOTALLY

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
ACCURATE.

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AND THE LAWYERS HAVE SAID

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE TAX

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
RETURNS AND HE HASN'T MADE MONEY

30
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
FROM RUSSIAN SOURCES WITH A FEW

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
EXCEPTIONS.
AND VLADIMIR PUTIN SAYS HE CAN

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
HELP REDUCE KIM JONG-UN'S

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
NUCLEAR THREAT.

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
LET'S GET TO IT.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
>> FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
THIS FRIDAY AFTERNOON, THE WHITE

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
HOUSE IS REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORDED

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FORMER

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
FBI DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
THAT'S AFTER HE SENT THIS TWEET.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
THAT LED TO THIS EXCHANGE IN

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
TODAY'S WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
>> DID PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORD

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH JAMES

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
COMEY?

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
>> I ASSUME YOU'RE REFERRING TO

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
THE TWEET.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE HAS

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
>> WHY DID HE TWEET THAT?

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
WHAT SHOULD WE INTERPRET FROM

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THAT?

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
FURTHER TO ADD.
>> ARE THERE RECORDING DEVICES

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR THE

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
RESIDENCE?
>> THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER TO

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
ADD ON THAT.

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
>> DID HE THREATEN MR. COMEYTO ?

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
>> IT'S NOT A THREAT.

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
THE TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'M MOVING ON.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
>> Shepard: HISTORIANS ARE

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
COMPARING THE TWEET WITH

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
PRESIDENT NIXON THAT RECORDED

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
NOW THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IS

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
RESPONDING TO THE PRESIDENT'S

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
TWEET.
THE COMMITTEE IS CONDUCTING ITS

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
OWN INVESTIGATION TO RUSSIAN

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
MEDDLING AND POTENTIAL COLLUSION

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
ADAM SCHIFF SAID IF THE

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
PRESIDENT HAS TAPES OF HIS

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
CONVERSATIONS OF DIRECTOR COMEY,

77
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
IT'S BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
HIMSELF MADE THEM.

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
FOR A PRESIDENT THAT BASE LESSLY

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ACCUSES OF WIRE TAPING, THAT

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
MR. TRUMP WOULD HAVE ENGAGED IN

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
SUCH CONDUCT IS STAGGERING.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD PROVIDE ANY

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
SUCH RECORDINGS TO CONGRESS OR

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
ADMIT, ONCE AGAIN, TO HAVE MADE

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A THREATENING STATEMENT.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THE CONGRESSMAN IS REFERRING TO

88
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNFOUNDED

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
CLAIM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
TRUMP TOWER WIRETAPPED.

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
BACK IN MARCH, DIRECTOR COMEY

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SAID THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
BACK UP THAT CLAIM.

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
ASIDE FROM A LETTER, WE HAVEN'T

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
HEARD FROM JAMES COMEY SINCE THE

96
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
PRESIDENT AXED HIM.

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
ABC NEWS NOW CITES SOURCES THAT

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
SAY THAT COMEY WAS FURIOUS AT

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
THE LACK OF RESPECT THE WHITE

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
HOUSE SHOWED HIM.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
REMEMBER, HE WAS IN LOS ANGELES

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
GIVING A SPEECH TO BUREAU

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
EMPLOYEES WHEN NEWS OF HIS

104
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
FIRING FLASHING ON TV SCREENS.

105
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
THAT'S HOW HE LEARNED OF IT.

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WHITE HOUSE

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
OFFICIALS CLAIM THE FBI RANK AND

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
FILE LOST CONFIDENCE IN DIRECTOR

109
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
COMEY AS PART OF THE REASONING

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
FOR THE FIRING.

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
BUT IN A CONTRADICTION, THE

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
PRESIDENT SAID THAT WAS NOT

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
TRUE.
THEN THERE'S THIS FROM THE

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
OFFICIAL MATTHEW MILLER.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
HE TWEETED, ONE THING I LEARNED

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
AT DOJ, HE LEAVES A PROTECTIVE

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
PAPER TRAIL WHEN HE DEEMS

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE

120
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
HAPPENED.

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
STAY TUNED.

122
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS ON

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THE NORTH LAWN.

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
WHAT ELSE IS THE PRESIDENT

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
SAYING?
>> NOT A WHOLE LOT, SHEP.

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
THIS MORNING AFTER THE PRESIDENT

128
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
SAID AT THAT TWEET AT THE UPPER

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
PRESS OFFICE WHEN I TALKED TO

130
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
SEAN SPICER AND SARAH HUCKABEE

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
SANDERS AND I ASKED THEM ABOUT

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
THIS, WHEN THE PRESIDENT TALKS

133
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
TO SOMEBODY AS HE DID ON THE

134
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
TELEPHONE WITH THE FBI DIRECTOR,

135
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ARE THE CALLS LOGGED OR ARE

136
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THERE TRANSCRIPTS MADE OF THEM?

137
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T GO INTO

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
MORE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAN THAT.

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
OF COURSE, THEY REITERATED THAT.

140
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
THE DIRECT OF COLUMBIA IS A

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ONE-PARTY CONSENT RECORDING

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
DISTRICT.
IT'S NOT A STATE.

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
ONLY ONE PARTY CONSENTING BEFORE

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
YOU CAN RECORD SOMEBODY.

146
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
THE ONLY OTHER CASE WHERE

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
SOMEBODY WAS RECORDED HERE AT

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE WAS A

149
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
HEATED CONVERSATION BETWEEN A

150
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
WHITE HOUSE STAFFER AND A

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
REPORTER.

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
SOMEBODY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE

153
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
PRESS OFFICE RECORDED THAT.

154
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I ACTUALLY LISTENED TO THAT

155
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
CONVERSATION.
BUT SHEP, NOTHING TO INDICATE AT

156
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
THIS POINT THAT THE PRESIDENT

157
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
HAS ANY KIND OF NIXONIAN TAPING

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
SYSTEM IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR ANY

159
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
TRANSCRIPTS OR RECORDINGS MADE

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
OF THE TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS

161
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
THAT HE HAD WITH THE FORMER FBI

162
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
DIRECTOR.
>> Shepard: JOHN, THERE'S

163
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
REPORTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
MONTHS AGO ASKED DIRECTOR COMEY

165
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
TO PLEDGE HIS LOYALTY.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THERE WERE REPORTS IN "THE NEW

167
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
YORK TIMES" HE MAY HAVE DONE
SEEN AT A DINNER.

168
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING

169
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
ON THIS?
>> THAT'S WHAT THE TWEET WAS

170
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
ABOUT IN TERMS OF LEAKING.

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
THERE'S A STORY IN "THE NEW YORK

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
TIMES" THAT QUOTES A SOURCE

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
CLOSE TO COMEY SAYING HE ASKED

174
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
FOR A LOYALTY PLEDGE.

175
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
HERE'S HOW SEAN SPICER HANDLED

176
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
THAT QUESTION.
>> DID THE PRESIDENT IMPLORE HIM

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
TO PLEDGE HIS LOYALTY?

178
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
IS THAT TRUE?

179
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
>> NO.

180
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
>> FOR IMPORTANT IS IT THAT THE

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
FBI DIRECTOR BE LOYAL TO THE

182
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
PRESIDENT?
IS THAT A QUALITY THE PRESIDENT

183
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
WANTS TO SEE IN ANY ONE,

184
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
PARTICULARLY THE FBI DIRECTOR?

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTS LOYALTY

186
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
TO THE COUNTRY AND RULE OF LAW.

187
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
>> SO I DID KNOW SOMEBODY, SHEP,

188
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THAT WAS THE HEAD OF AN AGENCY

189
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
THAT WAS A HOLDOVER FROM THE

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHO WHEN

191
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THE PRESIDENT TOOK OVER WAS

192
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT LOYALTY.

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
HIS ANSWER WAS I'M LOYALTY TO

194
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

195
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
NOT TO ANY ONE POLITICIAN IN

196
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
PARTICULAR.
SHEP?

197
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
>> Shepard: JOHN, ANOTHER

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
STUNNING MOVE THIS MORNING.

199
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SUGGESTED HE

200
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
MIGHT DO AWAY WITH THE DAILY

201
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
PRESS BRIEFING AFTER HE

202
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
CONTRADICTED HIS OWN
ADMINISTRATION OVER WHY AND WHEN

203
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
HE DECIDED TO FIRE JAMES COMEY.

204
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THE PRESIDENT TWEETED AS A VERY

205
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
ACTIVE PRESIDENT WITH LOTS OF

206
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
THINGS HAPPENING, IT'S NOT

207
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
POSSIBLE FOR MY SURROGATES TO

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
STAND AT THE PODIUM WITH PERFECT

209
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
ACCURACY.
MAYBE THE BEST THING TO DO IS

210
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
CANCEL ALL PRESS BRIEFINGS HAND

211
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
OUT WRITTEN RESPONSES FOR THE

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
SAKE OF ACCURACY.

213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT SAYS IT'S

214
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIS OWN

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
COMMUNICATIONS TEAM TO BE ON THE

216
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
SAME PAGE THAT HE'S ON ALL THE

217
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
TIME.
THE WHITE HOUSE INITIALLY SAID

218
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT ACTED ON

219
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HIS

220
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE HE FIRED

221
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
COMEY.
YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT TOLD NBC

222
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
NEWS HE WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY

223
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
ANYWAY.

224
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS AT THE

225
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
WHITE HOUSE.

226
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
DID THE PRESIDENT JUST DOUBLE

227
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
DOWN ON THIS WITH AN INTERVIEW

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
WITH ONE OF OUR FOLK?

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
>> SPECIFICALLY TO THAT POINT,

230
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
HE SAID HE'S MOVING SO FAST HIS

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
PRESS OFFICE CANNOT KEEP UP WITH

232
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
HIM.
WATCH THIS EXCHANGE BETWEEN

233
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
JUDGE JANINE AND THE PRESIDENT.

234
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
>> ARE YOU MOVING SO QUICKLY

235
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
THAT YOUR COMMUNICATIONS KEPT

236
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CANNOT KEEP UP WITH YOU?

237
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
>> YES, THAT'S TRUE.

238
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
>> SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THAT?

239
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
>> WE DON'T HAVE PRESS

240
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
CONFERENCES AND WE DO --

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
>> YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

242
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
>> DON'T HAVE THEM UNLESS I HAVE

243
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THEM EVERY TWO WEEKS AND I DO

244
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THEM MYSELF.
WE DON'T HAVE THEM.

245
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

246
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE A LEVEL

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OF HOSTILITY THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

248
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SARAH HUCKABEE IS A LOVELY YOUNG

249
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
WOMAN.

250
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
YOU KNOW SEAN SPICER.

251
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
HE'S A NICE MAN.

252
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
>> IS HE'S YOUR PRESS SECRETARY

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
TODAY AND TOMORROW?

254
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
>> HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB BUT HE

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
GETS BEAT UP.

256
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
>> WILL HE BE THERE TOMORROW?

257
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
>> HE'S BEEN THERE FROM THE

258
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
BEGINNING.
>> THE PRESIDENT KNEW WHAT THE

259
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
REASONS WERE FOR COMEY'S FIRING.

260
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
THEY WERE NOT ARTICULATED OR

261
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THEY'RE COMING UP WITH AN

262
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ALTERNATE CASE FOR WHY HE WAS

263
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
FIRED.
THE REAL REASON WASN'T

264
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
ARTICULATED TO THE VICE

265
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
PRESIDENT.
WEDNESDAY MORNING HE WENT OUT

266
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THERE AND GAVE AN INCOMPLETE

267
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ANSWER AS WELL.

268
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
SO SEE WHERE IN GOES.

269
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
>> Shepard: JOHN, THANK YOU.

270
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS SAY A

271
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
REVIEW OF HIS LAST DECADE OF TAX

272
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
RETURNS DOES NOT REFLECT ANY

273
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
INCOME OF ANY TYPE FROM RUSSIAN

274
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
SOURCES FOR ANY DEBT OWED TO

275
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
RUSSIAN LENDERS.

276
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
BUT THE LAWYERS CLAIM THERE'S

277
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SOME EXCEPTIONS.

278
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
FOR INSTANCE, A PROPERTY SOLD TO

279
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A RUSSIAN BILLIONAIRE FOR $95

280
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
MILLION IN 2008.

281
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NOT RELEASED

282
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
THE TAX RETURNS SO FOX NEWS

283
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
CANNOT CONFIRM ANY OF THIS.

284
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
MEANTIME, THE LAW FIRM WHICH

285
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
WROTE THE LETTER FOR THE

286
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PRESIDENT HAS EXTENSIVE TIES TO

287
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
RUSSIA AND ACCORDING TO A PRESS

288
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
RELEASE ON HIS OWN WEB SITE, THE

289
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
LAWSUIT WON A RUSSIAN LAW FIRM

290
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OF THE YEAR AWARD IN 2016.

291
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK'S GERRI

292
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
WILLIS IS HERE.
THAT'S ALMOST FUNNY.

293
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
>> IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.

294
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
>> IT IS FUNNY.

295
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
>> THE FIRM IS MORGAN LEWIS.

296
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I HAVE A COPY OF THE LETTER

297
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
HERE.
YOU CAN SEE THE LETTER THEY

298
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
WROTE ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENT.

299
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
LET'S BE CLEAR.

300
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
TRUMP IS THE CLIENT OF THIS

301
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
ORGANIZATION.
THEY REPORT TO HIM.

302
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HE'S PAYING THE 48 -- FREIGHT

303
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
HERE.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IF YOU READ

304
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
BETWEEN THE LINES HERE,

305
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
UNDERSTAND THAT MAJOR COMPANIES

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IN RUSSIA USE SUBSIDIARIES IN

307
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
OTHER PLACES LIKE CYPRESS, LIKE

308
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
AT THE END OF THE DAY, MAYBE

310
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT

311
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
WE'RE NOT SEEING.

312
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
>> Shepard: WHY DID THIS LETTER

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
COME ABOUT?
DID SOMEONE ASK FOR THIS?

314
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
>> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ASKED

315
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
FOR THIS LETTER AS PART OF HIS

316
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
INVESTIGATION.

317
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I TRIED TO REACH OUT TO HIS

318
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
OFFICE TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY

319
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
MAKE OF THIS LETTER, IF IT

320
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
SATISFIES THEM.

321
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I WAS UNABLE TO DO SO.

322
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
IN AN INVESTIGATION THIS MIGHT

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
BE STEP NUMBER 1.

324
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
YOU WANT TO SEE THE RESULTS, THE

325
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
FILINGS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT'S

326
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
GOING ON.

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
>> Shepard: THE TAX RETURNS

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

329
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
>> IT WOULD HELP.
WHAT DOES THE IRS DO FOR A LIST

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
SOMETHING THEY MATCH W 2s WITH

331
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
REPORTED INCOME.

332
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE, IT'S

333
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
ANOTHER THING.
>> Shepard: THEY DO A GREAT JOB.

334
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
NEVER SPEAK POORLY.

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
>> WE LOVE THE IRS.

336
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
>> Shepard: OBVIOUSLY.

337
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> THEY'RE OUR FAVORITE PEOPLE.

338
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
>> Shepard: THEY ARE.

339
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
GO METS!

340
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

341
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

342
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU.

343
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
MORE FROM CHRIS WALLACE COMING

344
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
UP FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK ON

345
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
THIS MERCIFULLY FRIDAY AGAINST.

346
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
STAY WITH US.

347
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
♪

348
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
To err is human.

349
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
To anticipate is Lexus.

350
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Experience the Lexus RX
with Advanced Safety standard.

351
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Experience amazing.

352
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the uncertainties of Hep C.

353
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Wondering, What if?

354
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I let go of all those feelings.

355
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Because I am cured with Harvoni.

356
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Harvoni is a revolutionary

357
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
treatment for the most common

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
type of chronic hepatitis C.

359
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's been prescribed to more

360
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
than a quarter million people.

361
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And is proven to cure up to

362
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
99% of patients who have had no

363
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
prior treatment with 12 weeks.

364
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Certain patients can be cured

365
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
with just 8 weeks of Harvoni.

366
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Before starting Harvoni,

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
your doctor will test to see if

368
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you've ever had hepatitis B,

369
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
which may flare up and cause

370
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
serious liver problems during

371
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and after Harvoni treatment.

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Tell your doctor if you've

373
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
ever had hepatitis B,

374
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
a liver transplant,

375
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
other liver or kidney problems,

376
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
HIV or any other medical

377
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
conditions and about all

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
the medicines you take

379
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
including herbal supplements.

380
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Taking amiodarone with Harvoni

381
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
can cause a serious slowing

382
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
of your heart rate.

383
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Common side effects of Harvoni

384
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
include tiredness,

385
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
headache and weakness.

386
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ready to let go of Hep C?

387
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Ask your Hep C Specialist
about Harvoni.

388
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
>> Shepard: CONTINUING COVERAGE

389
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
OF THE PRESIDENT'S SUGGESTION

390
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THAT CONVERSATIONSES  IN THE

391
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
OVAL OFFICE MAY BE RECORDED.

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
CHRIS WALLACE JOINS US WITH

393
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
MORE.

394
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
THIS WAS COMMON PRACTICE IN THE

395
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
NIXON ADMINISTRATION?

396
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
RECORDING CONVERSATIONS.

397
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
>> WHEN I HEARD THAT EXCHANGE

398
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
TODAY BETWEEN JEFF MASON, WHITE

399
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
HOUSE REPORTER, AND SEAN SPICER

400
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
SPEAKING FROM THE PODIUM IN THE

401
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
BRIEFING ROOM FOR THE PRESIDENT

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
OF THE UNITED STATES, IT TOOK MY

403
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
BREATH AWAY.

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
THAT'S WHAT IN WATERGATE THEY

405
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
CALL A NONDENIAL DENIAL.

406
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY, IS

407
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THERE A RECORDING DEVICE IN THE

408
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
OVAL OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
THE UNITED STATES.

410
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
HE SAID I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU

411
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
ON THAT.
HE COULD HAVE SAID NO.

412
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
HE COULD HAVE SAID YES.

413
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
HE SAID I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU

414
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
ON THAT.

415
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
THAT IS A NONDENIAL DENIAL.

416
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
IT MAY JUST BE THAT THE

417
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
PRESIDENT IS TROLLING THE PRESS

418
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
CORPS AND SAYING WORK YOURSELF

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
INTO A FRENZY ABOUT THIS AND

420
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
TURNS OUT IT NOTHING.

421
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

422
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
WHY WOULD HE WANT TO DECREASE

423
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
THE CREDIBILITY WHICH IS ALREADY

424
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
IN QUESTION OF THIS WHITE HOUSE

425
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
AND COMMENTS MADE FROM THAT

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
PODIUM?

427
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE PLAYING

428
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
A VERY DANGEROUS GAME WITH THE

429
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
CURRENCY OF THE CREDIBILITY OF

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

431
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
STATES.
>> Shepard: THIS FIRST CAME UP

432
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
IN THE CONTEXT OF DISCUSSION

433
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
REGARDING JAMES COMEY.

434
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
THIS IS THE TWEET THAT CAME FROM

436
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING WHEN

437
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
HE SAID, YOU KNOW, HE BETTER

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
HOPE THERE'S NO TAPES IF HE WILL

439
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
KEEP LEAKING, THIS GOES BACK TO

440
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
YESTERDAY WHEN THE PRESIDENT

441
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
TOLD LESTER HOLT ON THREE

442
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
SEPARATE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING

443
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
ONCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, A WEEK

444
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
AFTER THE INAUGURATION, THAT

445
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
COMEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT HE

446
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
WAS NOT A TARGET OF THE

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
INVESTIGATION.

448
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
THAT ALWAYS SEEMED DUBIOUS GIVEN

449
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ARGUE THAT

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
COMEY HAD AN OVERLY INFLATED

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
SENSE OF HIS OWN INTEGRITY.

452
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
BUT THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD SAY

453
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
TO THE POTENTIAL TARGET OF AN

454
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
INVESTIGATION, YOU'RE OFF THE

455
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
HOOK, THAT ALWAYS SEEMED

456
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
UNLIKELY.
SURE ENOUGH THIS MORNING, COMEY

457
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
THROUGH SOURCES, ASSOCIATES,

458
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
LEAKED THE STORY TO "THE NEW

459
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
YORK TIMES," TOLD A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY THAT SAID THAT

460
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR THE

461
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
DINNER AND AT THE DINNER ASKED

462
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
HIM THREE SEPARATE TIMES, WILL

463
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
YOU PLEDGE YOUR LOYALTY TO ME.

464
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
COMB MY REFUSED TO DO SO.

465
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
THAT LED TO THE TWEET.

466
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
LOOK, HERE'S THE REAL THING THAT

467
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I WONDER ABOUT HERE, SHEP.

468
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
IF THE WHOLE POINT A WEEK AGO

469
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS FED

470
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
UP WITH THE HIGH PROFILE OF THE

471
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND THE

472
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
HIGH PROFILE OF JAMES COMEY,

473
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
LOOK AT EVERY STEP THAT'S BEEN

474
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
TAKEN IN THE LAST SEVEN DAYS.

475
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
YOU SAID IF HE HAD GONE ABOUT IT

476
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
AS PURPOSELY TO RAISE COMEY'S

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
PROFILE AND RAISE QUESTIONS

478
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
ABOUT THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION,

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER

480
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
THAN HE HAS.
I FIND IT ONE OF THE MOST

481
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
ASTONISHING WEEKS THAT I'VE EVER

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
COVERED IN THIS TOWN.

483
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
>> Shepard: WHAT DOES THIS TELL

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
US ABOUT THE INNER WORKINGS OF

485
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
THE WHITE HOUSE?

486
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE TRUST OF

487
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
THE PEOPLE ON BIG MATTERS, IF

488
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
AND WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS?

489
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
BECAUSE SOMETHING WILL.

490
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
>> WELL, YOU WONDER ABOUT THE

491
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
TRUST OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE

492
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
WHITE HOUSE.

493
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
THE PRESIDENT WAS FURIOUS ON

494
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
TUESDAY AFTER HE SUDDENLY

495
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
ANNOUNCED COMEY'S FIRING THAT

496
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
THERE WASN'T A MORE CONCERTED

497
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
EFFORT ON HIS COMMUNICATIONS

498
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
TEAM TO DEFEND HIM.

499
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
THE REASON WAS, THEY DIDN'T SET

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
UP TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT AND

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
ORGANIZE.
THERE'S A CREDIBLE TEAM.

502
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
THEY COULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER AN

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
ARGUMENT.
THEN OF COURSE, THE OTHER THING,

504
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
TURNED OUT THE ORIGINAL REASON

505
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
THAT THEY WERE GIVEN AND THE

506
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
PRESIDENT HIMSELF PUT IN HIS

507
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
LETTER FIRING COMEY TURNS OUT

508
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
NOT TO HAVE BEEN TRUE.

509
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
HE SAID IN A LETTER I DID THIS

510
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
UNDER RECOMMENDATION OF THE

511
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE DEPUTY

512
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE OF THE

513
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
WAY COMEY HANDLED THE CLINTON

514
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
INVESTIGATION.

515
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
YESTERDAY HE SAID IT WASN'T

516
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
TRUE.

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
HE PLANNED TO FIRE HIM BEFORE HE

518
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
MET WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
SO EVERY STEP HE'S TAKEN THIS

520
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
WEEK HAS CUT INTO THE

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
CREDIBILITY OF THIS WHITE HOUSE,

522
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE

523
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THE WHITE HOUSE AND CLEARLY I

524
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
THINK THE TRUST THAT THE

525
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE PAY TO THIS

526
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE

527
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
STAFF.
>> Shepard: CHRIS, YOU COVERED A

528
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
LOT OF WHITE HOUSES.

529
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I WONDER IF THE OBJECTIVE

530
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
JOURNALIST YOU ARE, HOW YOU

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
WOULD DESCRIBE THE STATE OF THIS

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
WHITE HOUSE IN THIS PRESIDENCY

533
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
AT THIS MOMENT.

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT

535
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
A LOT TODAY.

536
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT

537
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
AND I FIND IT TROUBLING AND

538
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
TROUBLED.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GAME

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
THAT THEY'RE PLAYING.

540
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
IT ISN'T A GAME.

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
YOU'RE DEALING WITH VERY SERIOUS

542
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
ISSUES.
IF THE PRESIDENT IS UPSET --

543
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
JUST THINK OF THIS.

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE WANTS

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
TOLD LESTER HOLT, I WANT TO GET

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RUSSIA

547
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
INVESTIGATION.
IT WANT IT DOWN QUICKLY BUT FIND

548
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
OUT.
TODAY HE SENDS OUT A TWEET AND

549
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
HE SENT ONE OUT EARLIER IN THE

550
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
WEEKS SAYING IT'S A HOAX AND A

551
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
TAX-PAYER FUNDED CHARADE.

552
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
DOES HE WANT TO GET TO THE

553
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
BOTTOM OF THE RUSSIA

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
INVESTIGATION OR JUST WANT TO

555
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
GET TO THE END OF THE RUSSIA

556
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
INVESTIGATION?
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION.

557
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000

560
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE

561
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
UNITED STATES.

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
THIS IS THE MAN WHO IS RUNNING

563
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
THE COUNTRY.

564
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
THIS IS THE MAN THAT WE HAVE TO

566
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
CRISIS, AND THERE WILL BE A

567
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
CRISIS.

EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED

569
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
THIS WEEK HAS CHIPPED AWAY AT

570
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
THAT CREDIBILITY.

571
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
IT'S A VERY DISTRESSING

572
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
SITUATION.

573
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000

THESE THINGS OF THE VIEW OF

575
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THOSE THAT SUPPORT AND THE VIEWS

576
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
OF THOSE THAT ARE CRITICS.

577
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
IN THIS CASE IT COMES FROM ALL

578
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
SIDES.
THERE'S A GENERAL OBSERVATION

579
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
THAT WE'RE IN A LEGAL OF UNUSUAL

580
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE

581
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
HAD ANY CONTACT CAN'T FIND

582
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
REFERENCE TO HISTORICALLY.

583
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOU

584
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
MIGHT GET OUT OF THIS CYCLE,

585
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
THIS CYCLE THAT THIS WHITE HOUSE

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000

587

CHRIS, IT'S CLEARLY ALL STOPPED.

590

>> YEAH.

591
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
THAT'S ANOTHER POINT THAT I FIND

592
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
ASTONISHING.

593
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE SOME

594
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
MOMENTUM FINALLY FOR HIS

595

IT.

600
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
IT HAD PASSED THE HOUSE.

601
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
A MAJOR BARRIER.

602
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000

604
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000

605
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
WE WERE GETTING DOWN TO SERIOUS

TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM.

608

TALK ABOUT TRADE.

609
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
SUDDENLY WE HAVE SPEND A WEEK

610
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
AND IT'S GOING TO GO ON LONGER

611
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
THAN THIS.
THIS WON'T BE OVER SUNDAY.

612
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
THIS WILL GO INTO NEXT WEEK AND

613
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
MAYBE BEYOND.

614
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
THERE'S TALK ABOUT ROD

ANNOUNCEMENT OF A REPLACEMENT

623
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
BE CONTROVERSIAL.

624
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
THIS WILL STOP ALL OF THE

625

634
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
THANK YOU.

635
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I was always
"the girl with psoriasis."

636
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
People don't stare anymore.

637
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I never joined in.

638
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That wasn't fair to any of us.

639
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I was covered.

640
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I tried lots of things
over the years.

641
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But I didn't give up.

642
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I kept on fighting.

643
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I found something that worked.

644
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That still works.

645
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Now?

646
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
SEE ME.

647
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
SEE ME.

648
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I found clear skin that lasts.

649
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
See if COSENTYX could make a
difference for you-

650
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
COSENTYX is proven to help
people with moderate

651
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
to severe plaque psoriasis...

652
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
...find clear skin that
can last.

653
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't use if you're allergic
to COSENTYX.

654
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Before starting COSENTYX,

655
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
you should be checked
for tuberculosis.

656
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
An increased risk of infections
and lowered ability

657
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
to fight them may occur.

658
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Tell your doctor if you have an
infection or symptoms.

659
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Or if you have received a
vaccine or plan to.

660
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you have inflammatory
bowel disease,

661
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
tell your doctor if symptoms
develop or worsen.

662
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Serious allergic reactions
may occur.

663
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
SEE ME
to know...

664
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
...clear skin can last.

665
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't hold back...

666
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
...ask your dermatologist if
COSENTYX can help you

667
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
find clear skin that lasts.

My Dell Small Business Advisor

UNDER THE SMART ON CRIME PLAN,

If their Alzheimer's
is getting worse,

813
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
ask about once-a-day NAMZARIC.

814
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
NAMZARIC is approved for

815
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
moderate to severe
Alzheimer's disease

816
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
in patients who are
taking donepezil.

817
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It may improve cognition
and overall function,

818
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and may slow the worsening
of symptoms for a while.

819

NAMZARIC does not change

820

the underlying
disease progression.

821
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
or any of the ingredients
in NAMZARIC.

824
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Tell the doctor
about any conditions;

825
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
including heart, lung, bladder,
kidney or liver problems,

826
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000

827
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
or procedures with anesthesia.

Serious side effects may occur,

829
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
including muscle
problems if given anesthesia;

830
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
slow heartbeat, fainting,
more stomach acid

831
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
which may lead to
ulcers and bleeding;

832
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
nausea, vomiting,
difficulty urinating,

833
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
seizures, and worsening
of lung problems.

834
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Most common side effects
are headache, diarrhea,

835

THEY WANT TO ISOLATE NORTH KOREA

924
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
DIPLOMATICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY,

925
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
PARTICULARLY WANTS TO GET CHINA

926
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
ON BOARD THERE.

927
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
HOWEVER, THE NEWLY-ELECTED SOUTH

928
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
KOREAN PRESIDENT WAS PUSHING FOR

929
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
MORE DIALOGUE WITH NORTH KOREA.

930
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
THE UNITED STATES SAYS THEY

931
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
WOULD ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION

932
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
WITH NORTH KOREA ONLY AFTER IT

933
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
CHANGES ITS BEHAVIOR.

934
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SPECIFIC TO

935
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
THE U.S. ON WHAT THE CONDITIONS

936
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
COULD BE, SHEP.

937
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
>> Shepard: WHAT IS THE LATEST

938
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
ON THE FOUR AMERICANS THE NORTH

939
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
KOREANS HAVE DETAINED?

940
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
>> WE'RE HEARING FROM NORTH

941
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
KOREAN STATE MEDIA.

942
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
NORTH KOREA RESERVES THE RIGHT

943
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
TO RUTHLESSLY PUNISH AMERICAN

944
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
CITIZENS THEY HAVE ARRESTED AND

945
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
THE IDEA THAT THESE CAPTIVES

946
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY NORTH KOREA

947
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
TO BE USED AS BARGAINING CHIPS

948
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
IS PURE IGNORANCE.

949
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
THEY SAID THEY WILL REVEAL THE

950
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
EXTENT OF THE CHARGES AGAINST

951
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
THESE FOUR AMERICANS.

952
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
THE PROBLEM HERE, SHEP, THE

953
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
UNITED STATES ALSO HAS NO

954
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NORTH

955
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
KOREA.

956
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

957
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
SWEDISH EMBASSY OR THE RULES

958
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED, THE

959
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
SWEDISH OFFICIALS SHOULD CHECK

960
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
ON THESE AMERICANS IN A COUPLE

961
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
DAYS.
BUT THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT

962
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
SAYS THOSE MEETINGS AND

963
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
CHECK-ONS ARE CONSTANTLY PUSHED

964
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
BACK, DELAYED, SOMETIMES NEVER

965
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
HAPPEN.

966
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
EARLIER THIS WEEK THE STATE

967
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
DEPARTMENT REISSUED TRAVEL

968
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
WARNING TO NORTH KOREA TELLING

969
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
AMERICANS NOT TO GO THERE

970
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
BECAUSE THOSE ARRESTED ARE

971
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
TREATED BY THE WARTIME LAW OF

972
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
NORTH KOREA.

973
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
FOUR AMERICANS THERE NOW, SHEP.

974
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
>> Shepard: RICH EDSON FROM THE

975
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
STATE DEPARTMENT.
LIKE WE NEEDED A WARNING NOT TO

976
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
GO THERE.

977
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I DON'T KNOW.

978
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
AND NOW AUTHOR OF "NUCLEAR SHOW

979
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
DOWN TAKES ON THE WORLD", ARTHUR

980
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
CHANG.
WHERE ARE WE NORTH KOREA?

981
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
LOOKS LIKE A MESS.

982
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
>> YEAH, IT CONTINUES TO BE A

983
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
MESS.

984
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

985
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
CONSUMED BY THE COMEY FIRING.

986
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO

987
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
NORTH KOREA.

988
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
NOW YOU HAVE PUTIN MAKING

989
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
COMMENTS ABOUT BEING A

990
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE.
>> Shepard: YEAH WHAT DO YOU

991
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
MAKE OF THIS?

992
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
>> I DON'T THINK PUTIN WILL GET

993
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
INVOLVED.
THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED IN 2003.

994
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
THEY WERE A MEMBER BUT NEVER

995
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
PARTICIPATED.

996
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
IF PUTIN -- LAST THING HE WANTS

997
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
TO GET IN A COMPETITION ABOUT

998
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
SUPPORTING NORTH KOREA.
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO

999
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THAT OR THE INTEREST IN HIS FAR

1000
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
EAST.

1001
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
SO HE'S GOING TO SAY THINGS LIKE

1002
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
THIS BECAUSE THE SOUTH KOREAN

1003
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
PRESIDENT CALLS HIM.

1004
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
IT STROKES HIS EGO.

1005
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE TOO

1006
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
INVOLVED.
>> Shepard: THE NORTH KOREAN SAY

1007
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
THEY'RE GOING TO DO A SIXTH

1008
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
NUCLEAR TEST.
WHERE IS OUR LEVERAGE WITH CHINA

1009
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
AND HOW DO WE APPLY IT?

1010
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
>> OUR LEVERAGE IS, WE CAN

1011
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
UNPLUG CHINESE BANKS FOR MONEY

1012
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
LAUNDERING FROM THE CHINESE.

1013
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
WE HAVE NEVER DONE IT.

1014
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA THREATENED TO DO

1015
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
THAT IN SEPTEMBER.

1016
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
BUT HE NEVER CARRIED THROUGH.

1017
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS IN

1018
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
THIS COOPERATIVE FACE WITH

1019
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
CHINA.
THEY'RE NOT THREATENING

1020
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
ANYTHING.

1021
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
WE DO HAVE IT.
WE DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL

1022
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
WILL.

1023
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE LEVERAGE

1024
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
THAN CHINA THAN CHINA HAS OVER

1025
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
US BUT WE DON'T USE IT.

1026
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
IT'S A HOLD RIGHT NOW.

1027
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
>> Shepard: PRACTICALLY

1028
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
SPEAKING, I'M CURIOUS TO FIND

1029
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY

1030
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
MAKE A SIXTH TEST.

1031
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
EVEN THE CHINESE HAVE WARNED

1032
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
THEM.
>> THE CHINESE HAVE AND WILL

1033
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
POSE MORE PRESSURE ON THEM.

1034
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
THE BALL IS IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

1035
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
COURT.
NORTH KOREA WON'T GET THE

1036
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
ABILITY TO LAND A NUKE ON

1037
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
U.S.
HE HAS THREE OR FOUR YEARS TO

1038
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
STOP THEM.

1039
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
>> Shepard: WHERE DO WE GET THAT

1040
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
NUMBER?

1041
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
>> THAT'S THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT

1042
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
WOULD TAKE FOR NORTH KOREA TO

1043
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY, THE HEAT

1044
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
SHIELDING TO PUT A NUCLEAR

1045
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
WARHEAD ON A BALLISTIC MISSILE.

1046
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
THEY HAVE NUKES FOR INTERMEDIATE

1047
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
RANGE MISSILES THAT CAN HIT

1048
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
JAPAN.

1049
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY GET TOO

1050
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
FAR INTO THE AMERICAN HOMELAND.

1051
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
THAT'S THAT FOUR-YEAR TIME

1052
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
FRAME.
PEOPLE SAY THREE, SOME SAY FIVE.

1053
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
IT'S REALLY CLOSE.

1054
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
PROBABLY WITHIN PRESIDENT

1055
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
TRUMP'S TERM.

1056
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
>> Shepard: IS PERCEIVED

1057
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
DISARRAY IN WASHINGTON, DOES

1058
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON NORTH

1059
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
KOREA RIGHT NOW?

1060
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
>> YES, WITH HISTORY AS A GUIDE.

1061
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
THEY THEY WE'RE NOT LOOKING OR

1062
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
WE'RE NOT IN A CAPACITY TO

1063
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
RESPOND.

1064
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
RIGHT NOW WITH THE FOE
CONTRIBUTION ON DOMESTIC

1065
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
AFFAIRS, IT'S A PERFECT TIME FOR

1066
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
KIM JONG-UN TO SET OFF THAT

1067
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
SIXTH NUCLEAR TEST.

1068
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
HE WANTED TO NOT DO IT BEFORE

1069
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
MAY 9th.
THAT'S THE SOUTH KOREAN

1070
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
ELECTION.

1071
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
HE DIDN'T WANT TO DERAIL THE

1072
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
CHANCES OF THE NEW PRESIDENT WHO

1073
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
IS PRO NORTH KOREA.

1074
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
NOW MOON HAS BEEN ELECTED.

1075
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
NORTH KOREA CAN SET THAT TEST

1076
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
OFF ANY TIME THEY THINK IS

1077
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS.

1078
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I THINK THEY WILL WAIT A FEW

1079
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
WEEKS.
WE'LL WAIT.

1080
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
>> Shepard: GORDON CHANG.

1081
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THANKS.

1082
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000

SINCE THE HOUSE PASSED ITS

1092
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000

1094
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000

EVERYBODY IS AT THE TABLE.

1115
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BASIS

1116
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
WAS FOR MAKING UP THIS GROUP.

1117
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
REALLY IS UP TO THE LEADERS TO

1118
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
DECIDE WHOM THEY WANT.

1119
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
MIKE?
>> I'M TOLD THE MAJOR AREAS OF

1131
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
DISCUSSIONS ARE DIVIDED INTO

1132
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
FOUR KEY GROUPS, MAJOR BUCKETS

1133
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
THEY'RE LOOKING AT.

1134
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICAID EXPANDED

1135
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
UNDER OBAMACARE.

1136
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
WHAT DO THEY DO GOING FORWARD?

1137
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT AN ABRUPT

1138
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
CUT OFF.

1139
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
TAX CREDITS TO HELP POOR PEOPLE

1140
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
AFFORD INSURANCE.
INSURANCE REGULATIONS INCLUDING

1141
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS.

1142
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
MANY REGULATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN

1143
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
OBAMACARE, MANY REPUBLICANS WANT

1144
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
TO GET RID OF THEM.

1145
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
SOME ARE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED

1146
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
ABOUT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING

1147
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
CONDITIONS.
AND THEN INSURANCE MARKET

1148
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
STABILITY.
MANY HEADLINES ABOUT INSURERS

1149
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
PULLING OUT OF OFFERING PLANS IN

1150
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
CERTAIN STATES.

1151
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
HOW DO YOU GET MORE COMPETITION

1152
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS?

1153
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
AS WE HEARD BEFORE, IT'S

1154
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
COMPLICATED.
>> Shepard: THANKS, MIKE.

1155
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
IN OHIO TODAY, SIX CHILDREN ARE

1156
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
LIVING WITH A TERRIBLE NEW

1157
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
REALITY.
THEIR FATHER, THE POLICE CHIEF,

1158
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
WILL NEVER WALK THROUGH THE DOOR

1159
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
AGAIN.

1160
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
HE RESPONDED TO A REPORT OF A

1161
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
GUNMAN AT A NURSING HOME.

1162
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
THE GUNMAN SHOT HIM DEAD.

1163
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
THAT BRAVE POLICE CHIEF WAS ONE

1164
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000

1165
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
AHEAD, THE EFFORT TO FIND OUT

1166
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY.

1167
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Hey, The Future,
what's her problem?

1168
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Apparently, I kept her up
all night.

1169
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
She said The Future
freaks her out.

1170
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
How come no one
likes me, Jim?

1171
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Intel does!

1172
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Just think of everything
Intel's doing right now

1173
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
with Artificial Intelligence.

1174
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And pretty soon AI
is going to help executives

1175
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
like her see trends to stay
ahead of her competition.

1176
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
No more sleepless nights.

1177
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
- We're going to be friends!
- I'm sorry about this.

1178
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Don't be embarrassed
of me, Jim.

1179
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm getting excited
about this!

1180
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We know the future.

1181
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
We're going to be friends!

1182
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Because we're building it.

1183
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
>> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS NOW.

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
BEGUN A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE

SUSPECT IN HIS SIGHT.

THAT HE WAS THE LAST IN HIS

1201
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
DEPARTMENT TO HEAR FROM HIM.

1202
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
THE SUSPECT IS DEAD.

1203
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW HE DIED.

1204
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
THE CHIEF WAS JUST THREE WEEKS

1205
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000

TODAY.

1214
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS IF

1215
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN

1216
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
THE SHOOTER AND THE EMPLOYEES

1217
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000

BRAVERY OF THAT SHERIFF THAT RAN

THE DEPUTIES WERE IN ROUTE TO

1236
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
BACK HIM UP.

1237
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
WHEN DEPUTIES ARRIVED, THEY

OFFICIALS IN GREAT BRITAIN SAID

IT HIT THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH

1255
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
SYSTEM, WHICH IT DID.

1256
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
THEN THE PRIME MINISTER, THERESA

00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
MAY, SAID THE ATTACK HAD A

1258
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
BIGGER IMPACT THAN THAT.

1259

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
MORE WOMEN TO THE RANKS OF THE

THAT'S NEXT.

1274
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
What's the best way to get

1275
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
two servings of veggies?

1276
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
V8 or a powdered drink?

1277
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Ready, go.

1278
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Ahhhhhhhh!
Shake! Shake!
Shake! Shake! Shake!

1279
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Done!

You gotta shake it!

I shake it!

1282
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Glad I had a V8.

WATCH.
>> NO ONE KNOWS WHERE IT COMES

1304
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
FROM.
BUT SOME HAVE IT AND SOME DON'T.

1305
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
IT'S THE FIGHTING SPIRIT.

1306
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
IT CONSUMES FEAR AND WEAKNESS.

1307
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
>> AND DEMCO SAYS FILMING WAS

1308
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
TOUGH BECAUSE SHE WAS SUBMERGED

1309

HOLDING A RIFLE IN THE WATER AND

1310
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000

SHE'S NOW IN OKINAWA, JAPAN.

1312
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,000
THERE'S 83,000 MARINES AND 8%

1313
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
ARE WOMAN.
BUT THEY HOPE BY 2019, 10% WILL

1314
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
BE WOMANS.

1315
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
SHEP?

1317
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
MARINES NOT LONG AGO THEY WERE

1318
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
COMPLAINING ABOUT WOMEN IN THE

1320
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
COMPLAINED.
AND SECRETARY DEFENSE ASH CARTER

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
THAT DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS AND

1322
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
SINCE THEN, 74% OF WOMEN HAVE

1323
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
MOVED TO MARINE COMBAT

1324
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000

THE MARINES HAD A SCANDAL WHEN A

00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
SOMETIMES CALLING THE WOMEN OUT

1331

BY NAME OR WHERE THEY WERE

1332
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
BASED.
AFTER THE NAVY INVESTIGATED,

1333
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
THERE WERE NUMEROUS LEVELS OF

1334
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
DISCIPLINE HANDED OUT INCLUDING

1335
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
SEVERAL DEMOTIONS.

1336
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000

TODAY.
A WATER LEAK CUT IT SHORT.

1343
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
NASA OFFICIALS SAY THE LEAK CAME

1344
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000

WHITSON HOLDS THE REPORT FOR

1352
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
MORE SPACE WALKS THAN ANY OTHER

1353
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000

THIS WAS HER NINTH.

1354
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
THE POPE WAS IN PORTUGAL WHERE

1355
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
HE'S SET TO NAME TWO NEW SAINTS

1356
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000

IT WILL HAPPENED IN A SHRINE IN

FATIMA.

1359
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000

00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
TWO CHILDREN THAT SAID THE

HERE'S A PHOTO OF THE POPE

1376
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
PRAYING AT FATIMA.

1377

1379
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
AN AMERICAN PILOT BECAME THE

1380
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
FIRST WOMAN TO FLY AROUND THE

1381
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
WORLD'S BIGGEST OCEAN AND

1382
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
HAPPENED IN THIS DAY IN HISTORY.

1383
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
A naturally aspirated
5.0-liter V8 engine.

1384
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
A 10-speed Direct-Shift
transmission.

1385
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
A meticulously
crafted interior.

1386
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
All of these are feats
of engineering.

1387
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Combining them with

1388
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
near-perfect weight
distribution...

1389
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
...is a feat of amazing.

1390
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Experience the first-ever

1391
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
471-horsepower
Lexus LC 500

1392
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
or the Multistage
Hybrid LC 500h.

1393
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Experience Amazing.

1394
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
(announcer VO)
there's a moment of truth.etes,

1395
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And now with Victoza®

1396
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
a better moment of proof.

1397
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Victoza® lowers my A1C
and blood sugar

1398
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
better than
the leading branded pill,

1399
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
which didn't get me to my goal.

1400
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Lowers my A1C better

1401
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
than the leading
branded injectable.

1402
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The one I used to take.

1403
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And better than that
diabetes pill I used to take.

1404
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
(Jeff)
Victoza® works with your body

1405
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
to lower blood sugar
in three ways--

1406
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
in the stomach, the liver,

1407
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and the pancreas.

1408
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And while it
isn't for weight loss,

1409
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Victoza® may help you
lose some weight.

1410
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Non-insulin Victoza® comes in
a pen and is taken once a day.

1411
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
(announcer VO)
Victoza® is not recommended

1412
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
as the first medication
to treat diabetes,

1413
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and is not for people
with type 1 diabetes

1414
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
or diabetic ketoacidosis.

1415
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Do not take Victoza® if you have
a personal or family history

1416
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
of medullary thyroid cancer,

1417
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia
syndrome type 2,

1418
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
or if you are allergic
to Victoza®

1419
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
or any of its ingredients.

1420
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Stop taking Victoza®
and call your doctor right away

1421
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
if you get a lump or swelling
in your neck

1422
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
or if you develop any allergic
symptoms including itching,

1423
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
rash, or difficulty breathing.

1424
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Serious side effects may happen,
including pancreatitis.

1425
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So, stop taking Victoza®
and call your doctor right away

1426
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
if you have severe pain
in your stomach area.

1427
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Tell your doctor
your medical history.

1428
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Taking Victoza® with
a sulfonylurea or insulin

1429
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
may cause low blood sugar.

1430
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The most common side effects
are headache, nausea,

1431
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
diarrhea, and vomiting.

1432
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Side effects
can lead to dehydration,

1433
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
which may cause kidney problems.

1434
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Now's the time for

1435
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
a better moment of proof.

1436
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Ask your doctor about Victoza®.
