      I was playing golf        
          days ago...           

288
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,624

   Wait, what, what happened?   

291
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,361
   I was having a good round,   

292
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,463
  and then my friend, Sheila,   

293
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,465
    right as I was stepping     
        into the tee box        

294
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,100
mentioned a tip a pro gave her.

    No.                         

296
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:09,968
                       Yep.     

297
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,668
          Did it help?          

298
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,970
 It completely ruined my game.  

299

      Well, the truth is,

     that advice was never

   with moderate to severe RA

       did not work well.       

316
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,135
  XELJANZ XR can reduce pain,   

317
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,970
      swelling and further      
         joint damage,          

318
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,605
   even without methotrexate.   

319
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,608
   XELJANZ XR can lower your    
  ability to fight infections,  

320
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,143
    including tuberculosis.     

321
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,612
    Serious, sometimes fatal    
      infections, lymphoma      

322
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,314
and other cancers have happened.

323
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,950
     Don't start XELJANZ XR     
   if you have an infection.    

324
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,685
      Tears in the stomach      
         or intestines,         

325
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:01,919
     low blood cell counts      

326
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:02,987
     and higher liver tests     

327
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,789
     and cholesterol levels     
         have happened.         

328
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,325
Your doctor should perform blood
     tests before you start     

329
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,160
  and while taking XELJANZ XR,  

330
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,995
and monitor certain liver tests.

331
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,497
    Tell your doctor if you     
        were in a region        

332
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,132
    where fungal infections     
           are common           

333
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,299
    and if you have had TB,     

334
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,501
       hepatitis B or C,        

335
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,202
  or are prone to infections.   

336
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:18,936
            Needles.            

337
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,171

338
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,039
          But for you,          

339
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:21,939
         one pill a day         

340
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,541
  may provide symptom relief.   

341
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,977
        Ask your doctor         
       about XELJANZ XR.        

342
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:26,844
        An "Unjection™".        

343
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,314
 What is the Power of Pacific?  

344
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,583
    It's life insurance and     
    retirement solutions to     

345
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,486
   help you reach your goals.   

346
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,555
   It's having the confidence   
      to create the future      

347
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,124
 that's most meaningful to you. 

348
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,394
It's protection for generations 
          of families,          

349
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,298
   and 150 years of strength    
         and stability.         

350
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,668
    And when you're able to     
      harness all of that,      

351
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,304
  That's the Power of Pacific.  

352
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,974
    Ask a financial advisor     
      about Pacific Life.
