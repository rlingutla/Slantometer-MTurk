00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
MICHAEL FREE STUFF FINNEY, WE'LL

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
SEE YOU SOON.
>> BYE-BYE.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
>>> TONIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
WARNING TO THE FBI DIRECTOR WHO

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
HE JUST FIRED.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
SAYING JAMES COMEY, BETTER HOPE

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
THAT THERE ARE NO TAPES.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
AFTER THE PRESIDENT SAYS THEY

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
HAD THREE CONVERSATIONS CLEARING

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
HIM.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
IS THAT A THREAT TO THE MAN WHO

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
WAS HEADING THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS ASKED,

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
ARE CONVERSATIONS BEING
RECORDED?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
THEIR ANSWER.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
>>> ALSO BREAKING, THE POLICE
CHIEF SHOT AND KILLED.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
TWO NURSING HOME EMPLOYEES ALSO

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
DEAD.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
RESIDENTS RACED TO SAFETY.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
>>> THE MOTHER'S DAY STORM, THE

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
NOR'EASTER MOVING UP THE COAST

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
TONIGHT.
>>> AND THE NEW SURVEILLANCE

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
FROM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
THE MOTHER WHO WAS TOLD HER

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
8-YEAR-OLD BOY FAINTED.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
DOES THE VIDEO TELL A DIFFERENT

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
STORY?

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
AND HOW LONG WAS HE LEFT THERE,

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
DAYS LATER, TAKING HIS OWN LIFE.

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
>>> AND THE DEADLY COLLISION
WITH A BUS.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
TRAFFIC HALTED FOR MILES.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
>>> AND, BREAKING NOW, THE

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
MASSIVE, FAST-MOVING U.S. CYBER
ATTACK.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
U.S. COMPANIES SHUTTING DOWN
THEIR COMPUTERS.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
BRIAN ROSS STANDING BY.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
>>> GOOD EVENING, IT'S GREAT TO

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
HAVE YOU WITH US ON A FRIDAY
NIGHT.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S MESSAGE FOR FIRED FBI

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETING THAT

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THERE
ARE NO TAPES OF WHAT THEY SAID.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
THE PRESIDENT SAYING COMEY TOLD

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
HIM HE'S NOT UNDER

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
INVESTIGATION.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
BUT TONIGHT, MAJOR NEW

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
QUESTIONS.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
IS THE WHITE HOUSE RECORDING
CONVERSATIONS?

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
ARE THERE TAPES?
AND IS THE PRESIDENT THREATENING

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
THE MAN WHO WAS LEADING THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION?

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
TONIGHT, HOW THE WHITE HOUSE

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
ANSWERS.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
JONATHAN KARL LEADING US OFF.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
>> Reporter: HE'S ALREADY FIRED
HIM.

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
AND TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMED

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
AN APPARENT THREAT AT FORMER FBI

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
TWEETING, COMEY HAD BETTER HOPE

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
THERE ARE NO TAPES BEFORE HE

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
STARTS LEAKING TO THE PRESS.
WAIT A MINUTE, TAPES?

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TAPING HIS

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
WHITE HOUSE CONVERSATIONS?

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
TODAY AFTER THE TWEET, A

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
NONDENIAL.

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
>> WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT YOU

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
SAID THERE MIGHT BE TAPE

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
RECORDINGS?

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
>> THAT, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT.
I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
ALL I WANT IS FOR COMEY TO BE

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
HONEST, AND I HOPE HE WILL BE.

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE, I HOPE.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
>> Reporter: A RECORDING WOULD

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
REVEAL WHETHER COMEY SAID WHAT
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS HE SAID

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
>> I SAID, IF IT'S POSSIBLE,

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW, AM I
UNDER INVESTIGATION?

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
HE SAID, YOU ARE NOT UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
>> Reporter: TODAY, THE WHITE
HOUSE WAS PRESSED ON WHETHER THE

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
PRESIDENT WAS THREATENING COMEY.

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
AND WHETHER ANY RECORDINGS

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
ACTUALLY EXIST.

81
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
>> DID PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORD

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH COMEY?

83
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
>> I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT.

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
FURTHER TO ADD ON THAT.

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> ARE THERE RECORDING DEVICES

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR RESIDENCE?

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
>> I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
ADD.
>> DOES HE THINK IT'S

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
APPROPRIATE TO THREATEN SOMEONE

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
LIKE MR. COMEY NOT TO SPEAK?
>> THAT'S NOT A THREAT.

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HE SIMPLY STATED A FACT.
THE TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'M MOVING ON.

94
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> Reporter: SEAN SPICER REFUSED

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
TO CONFIRM OR DENY WHETHER OR

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE IS BUGGED.

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
SEAN, DID YOU ASK THE PRESIDENT

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
IF HE'S INSTALLED LISTENING

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
DEVICES IN THE WHITE HOUSE?

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
DID YOU ASK THE PRESIDENT IF HE

101
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
INSTALLED LISTENING DEVICES?

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
SECRET WHITE HOUSE RECORDINGS

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
ARE NOT UNPRECEDENTED.

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
KENNEDY AND LBG SECRETLY TAPED

105
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
THEIR OVAL OFFICE MEETINGS.

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
AND SO DID RICHARD NIXON.
NIXON'S TAPES HELPED BRING DOWN

107
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
HIS PRESIDENCY, AND NO PRESIDENT

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
SINCE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
INSTALLING LISTENING DEVICES IN

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
>> JON, THE QUESTION TONIGHT IS,

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
IS THIS WHITE HOUSE RECORDING

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
CONVERSATIONS, OR WERE THOSE

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
JUST WORDS IN A TWEET?

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
SEAN SPICER REFUSING TO SAY

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
WHETHER THEY WERE RECORDING
PEOPLE?

117
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
>> Reporter: I THOUGHT IT WAS

118
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
STRIKING THAT HE DID NOT KNOCK

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
DOWN OR DENY THAT THE WHITE
HOUSE AND OVAL OFFICE IS BUGGED.

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
AND NOW, TWO TOP DEMOCRATS

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IN THE HOUSE SAYING THEY WANT TO

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
SEE ANY TAPES RELATED TO THE

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
COMEY FIRING.
AND THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE,

125
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
WHICH IS LEADING THE
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA, TELLS

126
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
ABC NEWS, IF THERE ARE TAPES,

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
THEY SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
HANDED OVER.
>> JON, THANK YOU.

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
>>> THIS EVENING, JAMES COMEY'S

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SIDE OF THE STORY BEGINNING TO

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
EMERGE.

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
SOURCES CLOSE TO HIM SAYING HE'S
FURIOUS.

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE DINNER

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
BETWEEN THE TWO, COMEY'S CAMP

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
SAYING THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM

136
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
TO BE LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT.
AND TONIGHT, ONE KEY PLAYER

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
SAYING COMEY SAID HE WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE GOING INTO THE

138
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
DINNER.

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
PIERRE THOMAS AGAIN TONIGHT.

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
>> Reporter: TONIGHT, TWO MEN.

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT
STORIES.

142
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED SOURCES IN

143
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
COMEY'S CIRCLE SAY, AT THAT

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
JANUARY DINNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP
ASKED COMEY MORE THAN ONCE

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
WHETHER HE WOULD BE LOYAL TO

147
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
HIM.

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
OUR SOURCES SAY COMEY ONLY

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
PROMISED TO BE HONEST.

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BUT TODAY, THE PRESIDENT FLATLY
DENIED THAT EVER HAPPENED.

151
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
>> DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BE A BAD QUESTION TO ASK.

155
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I THINK LOYALTY TO THE COUNTRY,

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
TO THE UNITED STATES, IS

157
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
IMPORTANT.
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
LOYALTY.

159
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
NUMBER ONE, NUMBER TWO, I DON'T

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
KNOW HOW THAT GOT THERE.
BECAUSE I DIDN'T ASK THAT

161
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
QUESTION.

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
>> Reporter: MULTIPLE SOURCES

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
ALSO TELL ABC NEWS THEY DO NOT

164
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
BELIEVE COMEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT
HE WAS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION,

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
AS TRUMP CLAIMED.

166
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
>> HE WANTED TO STAY ON AS FBI
HEAD, AND I SAID I WOULD

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
CONSIDER IT.

168
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

169
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
AND WE HAD A NICE DINNER.

170
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
AT THAT TIME, HE TOLD ME YOU ARE

171
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, WHICH I

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
KNEW ANYWAY.

173
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
>> Reporter: FORMER DIRECTOR

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
CLAPPER MET COMEY ON THE DAY OF

176
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
THE DINNER, AND SAID COMEY WAS

177
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
WORRIED HOW IT WOULD APPEAR.

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
>> HE MENTIONED HE HAD BEEN

179
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HAVE DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT.

181
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
AND HE WAS UNEASY WITH THAT.

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000

424

AND THE IRONY IS, THE ATTACKS

425
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
ARE BASED IN PART ON TOOLS

426
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000

AT LEAST SIX CARS SET ABLAZE.

JUST IN TIME FOR MOTHER'S DAY.

450
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
ONE THING TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS

451
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND, ESPECIALLY

452
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
IF YOU'RE ON FACEBOOK.

453
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
ng,

454
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
discomfort,

455
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
cramps, and gas.
(Sigh)

456
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Try ProNourish drink,

457
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
a unique nutritional drink

458
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that's high in protein
and fiber.

459
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And ProNourish has no gluten
or high fructose corn syrup,

460
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and it's low
in FODMAP ingredients

461
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that may trigger
digestive sensitivities.

462
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's your delicious
anytime, anywhere
mini-meal or snack.

463
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
ProNourish.

464
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Nutrition you can
feel good about.

465
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
could be preventedrrent
with the right steps.

466
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And take it from me,
every step counts.

467
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A Bayer aspirin regimen
is one of those steps

468
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
in helping prevent
another stroke.

469
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Be sure to talk
to your doctor

470
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
before you begin
an aspirin regimen.

471
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you have moderate

472
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to severe plaque psoriasis,

473
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
isn't it time

474
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
to let the real you
shine through?

475
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Introducing Otezla, apremilast.

476
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Otezla is not an injection

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
or a cream.

478
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a pill that treats
plaque psoriasis differently.

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Some people who took Otezla

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
saw 75% clearer skin
after 4 months.

481
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And Otezla's
prescribing information

482
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
has no requirement for
routine lab monitoring.

483
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't take Otezla
if you are allergic

484
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
to any of its ingredients.

485
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Otezla may increase
the risk of depression.

486
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a history

487
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
of depression
or suicidal thoughts,

488
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
or if these feelings develop.

489
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Some people taking Otezla
reported weight loss.

490
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Your doctor should
monitor your weight

491
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and may stop treatment.

492
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Side effects
may include
diarrhea, nausea,

493
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
upper respiratory
tract infection,

494
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and headache.

495
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Tell your doctor

496
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
about all the
medicines you take,

497
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and if you're pregnant
or planning to be.

498

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
>>> AND WE HAVE A MASSIVE RECALL

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
TONIGHT.

545
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
MORE THAN 1 MILLION POPULAR
PICKUPS INVOLVED.

546
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT.

547
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
on my long-term control
medicine.

548
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I talked to my doctor and
found a missing piece

549
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
in my asthma treatment with
BREO.

550
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Once-daily BREO prevents asthma
symptoms.

551
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
BREO is for adults
with asthma not well controlled

552
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
on a long-term asthma control
medicine,

553
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
like an inhaled corticosteroid.

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
BREO won't replace a rescue
inhaler

555
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
for sudden breathing problems.

556
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
BREO is specifically designed
to open up airways

557
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
to improve breathing for a full
24 hours.

558
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
BREO contains a type of medicine

559
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that increases the risk of death

560
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
from asthma problems
and may increase the risk
of hospitalization

561
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
in children and adolescents.

562
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
BREO is not for people whose

563
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
asthma is well controlled on a

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
long-term asthma control
medicine,

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
like an inhaled corticosteroid.

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Once your asthma is well
controlled,

567
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
your doctor will decide if you

568
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
can stop BREO and prescribe a

569
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
different asthma control
medicine,

570
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
like an inhaled corticosteroid.

571
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do not take BREO more than
prescribed.

572
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
See your doctor if your asthma

573
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
does not improve or gets worse.

574
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Ask your doctor
if 24-hour BREO

575
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
could be a missing
piece for you.

578
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
when this guy got a flat tire

579
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
in the middle of the night.

580
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hold on Dad...

581
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Liberty did what?

582
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah, Liberty Mutual 24-Hour
Roadside Assistance

583
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
helped him to fix his flat

584
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
so he could get home safely.

585
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
My dad says our insurance
doesn't have that.

586
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't worry - I know what a
lug wrench is, Dad.

587
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Is this a lug wrench?

588
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Maybe?

589
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000

Liberty Mutual Insurance.

593
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
As after a DVT blood clot,ital

594
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I sure had a lot
to think about.

595
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What about the
people I care about?

596
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
...including this little girl.

597
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And what if this
happened again?

598
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I was given warfarin
in the hospital,

599
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
but wondered, was this the
best treatment for me?

600
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I asked my doctor.

601
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And he recommended ELIQUIS.

602
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots

603
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and reduces the risk of
them happening again.

604
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots.

605
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
ELIQUIS also had

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
significantly
less major
bleeding

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
than the
standard
treatment.

608
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Both made me
turn around my
thinking.

609
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't stop ELIQUIS
unless your doctor tells you to.

610
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

611
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
an artificial heart valve

612
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
or abnormal bleeding.

613
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If you had a spinal injection
while on ELIQUIS

614
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
call your doctor right away

615
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
if you have tingling,
numbness, or muscle weakness.

616
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
While taking ELIQUIS,
you may bruise more easily

617
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
...and it may take longer
than usual for bleeding to stop.

618
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Seek immediate medical care
for sudden signs of bleeding,

619
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
like unusual bruising.

620
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
ELIQUIS may increase
your bleeding risk

621
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
if you take
certain medicines.

622
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Tell your doctor
about all planned

623
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
medical or dental
procedures.

624
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
ELIQUIS treats
DVT and PE
blood clots.

625
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Plus had
less major
bleeding.

626
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Both made ELIQUIS
the right treatment for me.

627
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Ask your doctor if switching
to ELIQUIS is right for you.
