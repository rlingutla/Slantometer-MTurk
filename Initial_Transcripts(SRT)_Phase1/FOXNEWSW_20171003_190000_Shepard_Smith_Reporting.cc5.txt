[000:01:56;032] ANOTHER IN THE HALL OUTSIDE THE
[000:01:58;368] HOTEL ROOM DOOR SO HE WOULD KNOW
[000:02:01;271] WHEN THE COPS APPROACHED.
[000:02:02;539] AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED
[000:02:03;540] THAT REPORT.
[000:02:04;240] WE ARE GETTING A LOOK INTO THE

[000:02:08;044] GUNMAN CARRIED OUT THE DEADLIEST
[000:02:10;079] SHOOTING IN MODERN AMERICAN

[000:02:27;797] YOU CAN SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE
[000:02:30;099] A USED ROOM SERVICE TRAY.
[000:02:31;467] YOU CAN SEE THE BREACHED DOOR
[000:02:33;837] ITSELF THERE COVERED WITH THE
[000:02:36;139] YELLOW POLICE TAPE.
[000:02:37;307] THE SWAT TEAM BROKE DOWN THE

[000:02:40;677] THE GUNMAN ALREADY TO FIND OUT
[000:02:42;378] HE ALREADY KILLED HIMSELF.
[000:02:43;479] INVESTIGATORS LOOKING INTO THE

[000:02:50;753] OFFICIALS TELL FOX NEWS, STEPHEN
[000:02:54;390] PADDOCK SENT ABOUT $100,000
[000:02:57;660] OVERSEAS.
[000:02:58;061] THE MONEY MAY HAVE GONE TO HIS

[000:03:00;797] LOOKING INTO IT AND HAVE NOT
[000:03:02;198] CONFIRMED THAT.

[000:03:18;281] MODIFIES WEAPONS TO MAKE THEM
[000:03:20;917] FULLY AUTOMATIC.

[000:03:29;559] POLICE OFFICERS SAY 23 FIREARMS
[000:03:31;561] WERE FOUND THERE.
[000:03:32;161] WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE

[000:03:35;398] TO SAVE OTHERS.
[000:03:36;866] FIRE OFFICIALS SAY OFF DUTY
[000:03:39;602] FIREFIGHTERS WERE SHOT WHILE
[000:03:42;071] TAKING ACTION.

[000:03:50;580] THEY WENT TO WORK HELPING OTHER
[000:03:54;017] MEMBERS IN THE AUDIENCE.
[000:03:56;286] TWO OF THESE MEMBERS WERE SHOT
[000:03:57;553] WHILE PERFORMING CPR.
[000:04:00;857] THIS IS A TRUE FEAT OF HEROISM
[000:04:04;360] ON THEIR PART.

[000:04:33;256] THE GUARD WE'RE TOLD SURVIVED.
[000:04:36;793] STEPHEN PADDOCK LIVED IN A
[000:04:39;862] RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN
[000:04:44;767] MESQUITE, NEVADA.
[000:04:45;268] HE WAS A 64-YEAR-OLD FORMER

[000:04:59;182] THAT DECADES AGO WAS ON THE
[000:05:01;017] FBI'S MOST WANTED LIST.
[000:05:02;618] FAMILY MEMBERS SAY THEY ALSO
[000:05:04;921] CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT WOULD
[000:05:05;955] MOTIVATE PADDOCK TO CARRY OUT
[000:05:07;724] THE MASSACRE.
[000:05:08;524] ACCORDING TO HIS BROTHER,
[000:05:09;525] STEPHEN PADDOCK WAS A
[000:05:11;127] MULTIMILLIONAIRE.
[000:05:11;627] HE MADE MUCH OF THE MONEY FROM
[000:05:13;563] REAL ESTATE AND LIVED A
[000:05:15;164] COMFORTABLE LIFE.
[000:05:15;832] THE BROTHER SAYS THE GUNMAN
[000:05:17;800] DIDN'T CARE ABOUT RELIGION OR
[000:05:19;702] POLITICS.
[000:05:20;803] INVESTIGATORS SAY PADDOCK WAS
[000:05:21;838] THE ONLY SHOOTER.

[000:05:32;849] HAPPENED.
[000:05:33;216] HE SAID I'M SORRY FOR THE HURT
[000:05:35;685] AND PAIN EVERYONE IS FEELING
[000:05:37;620] RIGHT NOW.
[000:05:38;021] THERE'S WORDS I CAN SAY TO TAKE
[000:05:39;522] THAT PAIN AWAY.
[000:05:40;823] JASON ALDEAN ADDED, TIME TO COME
[000:05:43;793] TOGETHER AND STOP THE HATE.

[000:05:48;931] INCLUDING VIDEO IN JUST A
[000:05:50;366] MOMENT.
[000:05:50;700] BUT FIRST, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
[000:05:53;069] SPEAKING.
[000:05:53;436] THIS IS HAPPENING IN PUERTO
[000:05:54;971] RICO.
[000:05:55;271] YOU'LL REMEMBER, THAT HE'S
[000:05:56;339] HELPING HAND OUT SUPPLIES AT A
[000:05:59;442] CHURCH THERE ABOUT TEN MILES
[000:06:01;344] NORTH OF -- SOUTH OF SAN JUAN.
[000:06:04;714] LET'S LISTEN IN.
[000:06:22;465] >> I SEE AN INCREDIBLE JOB DONE
[000:06:24;567] BY FEMA, THE COAST GUARD, THE
[000:06:27;303] ARMY, THE NAVY, THE AIR FORCE,
[000:06:29;205] THE MARINES.
[000:06:30;106] THE JOB OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS
[000:06:32;275] HAS BEEN SOMETHING LIKE I HAVE
[000:06:33;743] NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
[000:06:34;410] WHAT FEMA HAS DONE, WHAT THE
[000:06:38;147] PEOPLE THAT GOT HERE BEFORE THE
[000:06:39;482] HURRICANE HAVE DONE -- AND THE
[000:06:40;983] GOVERNOR IS WITH US.
[000:06:42;618] YOUR MAYOR IS WITH US ALSO, THE
[000:06:47;090] GOVERNOR.
[000:06:47;457] WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF
[000:06:49;559] RECOVERY IN TERMS OF SAVING
[000:06:51;227] LIVES, 16 LIVES.
[000:06:52;662] THAT'S A LOT.
[000:06:53;930] BUT YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE
[000:06:55;465] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT DIED IN
[000:06:57;967] OTHER HURRICANES AND FRANKLY
[000:06:59;669] WE'RE NOT NEARLY AS SEVERE.
[000:07:02;638] I JUST HAVE SUCH RESPECT FOR
[000:07:04;507] FEMA AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT
[000:07:06;409] GOT HERE EARLY.
[000:07:07;410] GOVERNOR, YOU MAY WANT TO SAY
[000:07:09;011] SOMETHING.
[000:07:09;745] >> WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE
[000:07:12;248] PRESIDENT, GRATEFUL FOR THE
[000:07:13;983] EFFORTS THAT THE FEDERAL
[000:07:14;984] GOVERNMENT HAS EMBARKED.
[000:07:16;219] THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT.
[000:07:17;453] WE HAVE ALL THE WAY FROM MAYORS
[000:07:20;389] TO FEMA, THE DODs, GENERAL
[000:07:24;127] BUCHANAN IS HERE AS WELL.
[000:07:26;028] WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS IF WE
[000:07:29;165] DIDN'T HAVE THOSE SUPPORT.
[000:07:30;933] OF COURSE, WE RECOGNIZE AND THE
[000:07:33;069] PRESIDENT RECOGNIZES WE STILL
[000:07:34;604] NEED TO DO MORE.
[000:07:35;571] WE KNOW WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER,
[000:07:37;006] THIS IS A COMMITMENT BY THE
[000:07:38;608] PRESIDENT, THE FIRST LADY BEING
[000:07:40;143] HERE SHOWS A COMMITMENT TO BEING
[000:07:41;911] HERE FOR THE LONG HAUL, HELPING
[000:07:44;580] US GET THE EMERGENCY HELP,
[000:07:46;682] HELPING US GET STABILITY AND
[000:07:50;186] BUILDING PUERTO RICO STRONGER
[000:07:51;287] THAN BEFORE.
[000:07:52;922] >> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU.
[000:07:55;057] ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MAY HEARD
[000:07:56;759] ON THE MAINLAND THAT IS NOT
[000:08:01;264] HAPPENING HERE.
[000:08:02;031] PEOPLE WERE ON THE ISLAND BEFORE
[000:08:03;533] THE HURRICANE, BEFORE, DURING
[000:08:05;601] AND AFTER MARIA.
[000:08:07;937] SO WE'VE BEEN HIT BY A HURRICANE
[000:08:10;473] CAT 5 IN LESS THAN TEN DAYS, ONE
[000:08:12;742] AFTER THE OTHER.
[000:08:15;011] SO IT'S NOT BY THE NAVY AND THE
[000:08:18;247] COAST GUARD.
[000:08:19;248] THEY ARE RESCUING MORE THAN 800
[000:08:21;584] PEOPLE AND STILL ONGOING IN
[000:08:25;021] RESCUE MISSIONS.
[000:08:31;627] FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,
[000:08:34;564] THE PUERTO RICAN HAS WORKED WITH
[000:08:37;433] THE GOVERNOR, TO DEAL WITH THIS
[000:08:40;736] ISSUE.
[000:08:41;037] WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE.
[000:08:41;771] WE'RE USED TO HAVING A HURRICANE
[000:08:43;039] BUT NEVER LIKE THIS ONE.
[000:08:44;273] THIS IS A MAJOR ONE.
[000:08:46;142] DEVASTATION.
[000:08:46;642] THANKS FOR ALL OF THE HELP AND
[000:08:49;779] ALL THE RESOURCES.
[000:08:55;418] ALL FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ON THE
[000:08:56;986] ISLAND BECAUSE OF YOU.
[000:08:59;589] >> THANK YOU.
[000:09:04;527] >> THE POWER GRID WAS DEVASTATED
[000:09:06;662] BEFORE THE HURRICANES EVEN HIT.
[000:09:08;097] THEN THE HURRICANES HIT.
[000:09:09;498] THEY WIPED THEM OUT.
[000:09:10;566] WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF
[000:09:12;401] GENERATORS THAT HAVE BEEN
[000:09:13;169] BROUGHT TO THE ISLAND.
[000:09:13;970] MOST OF THE HOSPITALS ARE OPEN.
[000:09:16;205] AT LEAST PARTIALLY OPEN.
[000:09:19;141] MOST OF THEM NOW ARE OPEN.
[000:09:22;712] AGAIN, THE JOB DONE HERE IS
[000:09:24;146] NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.
[000:09:25;514] IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE.
[000:09:27;083] I APPRECIATE VIRTUALLY -- THIS
[000:09:28;985] IS THE MAYOR FROM THIS VERY
[000:09:32;088] IMPORTANT AREA.

[000:09:41;964] BEHALF OF THE 3.5 MILLION U.S.
[000:09:44;634] CITIZENS.
[000:09:45;001] IS A TEAM.
[000:09:45;401] YOUR PEOPLE ARE DOING THE RIGHT
[000:09:46;869] STUFF FOR US.
[000:09:48;137] WE AS THE MAYOR -- THIS IS A
[000:09:53;376] TEAM.
[000:09:53;909] THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE AND THE
[000:09:55;144] HELPING OF THOUSANDS AND
[000:09:56;145] THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
[000:09:56;779] THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
[000:09:57;847] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
[000:09:59;282] EVERYBODY.
[000:09:59;649] >> WHAT DID YOU MEAN EARLIER
[000:10:03;953] THAT THEY COULD DO MORE?
[000:10:05;254] >> Shepard: NOW THE PRESIDENT
[000:10:06;122] WILL WALK IN THE BUILDING AND
[000:10:09;458] BEGIN THIS EFFORT OF
[000:10:10;726] DISTRIBUTING SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE
[000:10:13;129] WHO WERE THERE.
[000:10:15;431] SO LET'S LISTEN TO THIS.
[000:10:31;047] [APPLAUSE]
[000:12:00;436] [APPLAUSE]
[000:12:03;072] >> THANK YOU.
[000:12:06;876] THANK YOU.
[000:13:50;012] >> Shepard: THERE YOU HAVE IT.
[000:13:51;313] LOTS OF PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THE
[000:13:52;948] PRESIDENT.
[000:13:53;315] SOME WELL-WISHES, SOME CHEERS
[000:13:54;917] AND APPLAUSE AND SOME SUPPLIES
[000:13:56;218] TO BE HANDED OUT THERE.
[000:13:58;921] OF COURSE, THE REAL PROBLEM IN
[000:14:00;756] PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN WITH
[000:14:01;857] DISTRIBUTION.
[000:14:02;291] SO MANY OF THE DRIVERS OF THE
[000:14:03;859] TRUCKS THAT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE
[000:14:06;295] THE PRODUCTS, THAT ARE NECESSARY
[000:14:08;797] FOR SURVIVAL AROUND THE ISLAND,
[000:14:10;833] THOSE DRIVERS HAVE LOST IN MANY
[000:14:12;434] CASES THEIR HOMES OR THEIR
[000:14:14;036] ABILITY TO GET WHEREVER THEY
[000:14:15;137] NEED TO GO TO DRIVE THE
[000:14:16;405] VEHICLES.
[000:14:16;772] SO THEY'RE HAVING A LOT OF
[000:14:18;774] PROBLEMS WITH DISTRIBUTION.
[000:14:20;776] HURTING A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SMALL
[000:14:23;846] TOWNS AND OUTSIDE OF SAN JUAN.
[000:14:25;314] TO HEAR IT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,
[000:14:26;682] THEY'RE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY
[000:14:28;417] CAN TO GET THE DISTRIBUTION
[000:14:29;952] CHANNELS IN LINE SO THAT NO ONE
[000:14:32;955] ELSE LOSES THEIR LIVES IN THE
[000:14:36;458] HORROR THAT HAS BEEN PUERTO
[000:14:37;860] RICO.
[000:14:42;164] IN JUST A MOMENT, WE'LL RETURN
[000:14:43;799] TO TRACE GALLAGHER WHO IS IN
[000:14:45;401] LAS VEGAS.

[000:15:00;115] WHERE HE WAS SHOOTING AT LEAST
[000:15:01;417] ONE OF THEM AND IN A HALL SO HE

[000:15:10;793] Patrick woke up
[000:15:10;793] with a sore back.
[000:15:17;499] But he's got work to do.
[000:15:19;335] So he took Aleve this morning.
[000:15:24;039] If he'd taken Tylenol,
[000:15:25;274] he'd be stopping for
[000:15:25;274] more pills right now.
[000:15:28;243] Only Aleve has the
[000:15:28;243] strength to stop tough pain
[000:15:30;879] for up to 12 hours
[000:15:30;879] with just one pill.
[000:15:33;949] Tylenol can't do that.
[000:15:36;385] Aleve. All Day Strong.
[000:15:36;385] All Day Long.
[000:15:40;789] Check this Sunday's paper
[000:15:42;057] for extra savings on

[000:17:52;521] REPORTING OF THE DAILYMAIL.COM
[000:17:57;993] FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT THE
[000:18:00;295] GUNMAN HAD CAMERAS REPORTING HIS
[000:18:02;264] CARNAGE.
[000:18:02;598] IN ADDITION, WE LEARNED MORE
[000:18:03;799] ABOUT THE WEAPONS THAT HE HAD IN
[000:18:05;367] THE ROOM.
[000:18:06;034] 23 IN THE ROOM TOTAL.
[000:18:08;470] MORE THAN 40 IN HIS POSSESSION
[000:18:11;440] AT HIS HOMES AND THERE.
[000:18:13;342] INSIDE THE ROOM, 4  DDM-4
[000:18:22;184] RIFLES.
[000:18:22;518] SOME HAD BEEN AUGMENTED, AFTER
[000:18:25;721] MARKET, SO THEY COULD BECOME
[000:18:26;822] AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND MANY MORE.
[000:18:28;757] TRACE GALLAGHER IS LIVE IN
[000:18:30;959] VEGAS.
[000:18:31;260] WHAT ARE INVESTIGATORS DOING AT
[000:18:33;262] THE SCENE TODAY.
[000:18:33;962] >> SHEP, THERE'S A COUPLE OF
[000:18:35;297] CRIME SCENES AS YOU KNOW.
[000:18:37;332] RIGHT NOW THEY'RE GOING BACK TO
[000:18:39;101] THE CRIME SCENE IN MESQUITE.
[000:18:41;203] THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND 17
[000:18:42;938] WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES.
[000:18:46;108] THEY PULLED HARD DRIVES AS WELL.
[000:18:48;544] WE'LL HAVE MORE IN A NEWS
[000:18:50;412] CONFERENCE.
[000:18:50;813] AT THE HOTEL, THEY WERE STILL ON
[000:18:52;347] SCENE PROCESSING THE WEAPONS AND
[000:18:54;850] THE AMMUNITION.
[000:18:55;784] THAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE
[000:18:57;019] MORE DAYS.
[000:18:57;820] THEY WITH BACK HERE EARLY THIS
[000:19:00;389] MORNING.
[000:19:00;722] THE MANDALAY BAY IS FULLY OPEN

[000:19:05;127] IS COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

[000:19:08;897] TOOK PLACE, STILL SHUT DOWN TO
[000:19:10;399] THE MEDIA AND THERE'S STILL
[000:19:12;301] INVESTIGATORS CRAWLING ALL OVER
[000:19:14;002] THIS PLACE TRYING NOT TO DISTURB
[000:19:16;371] THE EVIDENCE BY WEARING BOOTIES.
[000:19:19;007] YOU CAN TELL THE CARS TELL THE
[000:19:20;642] STORY HERE.
[000:19:21;210] STILL HUNDREDS OF CARS AROUND
[000:19:22;477] THIS AREA.
[000:19:23;011] WE HAD SOME PEOPLE COME OUT LAST
[000:19:24;947] NIGHT ASKING US IF THEY COULD
[000:19:26;982] GET THEIR CAR, ASKING POLICE.
[000:19:29;284] THEY'RE BEING TOLD NO.
[000:19:30;519] WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT EVERY CAR
[000:19:32;721] HAS TO MATCH UP TO A CERTAIN
[000:19:34;489] PERSON.
[000:19:34;823] AS WE ALL KNOW, SOME OF THESE
[000:19:37;359] CARS WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY
[000:19:38;861] THEIR OWNERS.
[000:19:39;828] THE FBI IS ON SCENE.
[000:19:40;996] THEY'RE MAPPING CARS OVER HERE.
[000:19:42;731] THERE'S A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.
[000:19:43;966] SOME OF THESE CARS TRIED TO GET
[000:19:46;201] OUT WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED
[000:19:48;904] AND RAN INTO A DEAD END.
[000:19:52;341] THE GREEN JEEP HAS BLOOD-STAINED
[000:19:55;577] HAND PRINTS ON THE HOOD.
[000:19:56;778] IF YOU LEAVE THE CAR, LOOK
[000:19:59;781] AROUND THE GROUND AND THERE'S
[000:20:02;017] BLOOD PRINTS ALL THE WAY OUT
[000:20:04;920] HERE.
[000:20:05;220] THIS DOESN'T GIVE US MOTIVE BUT
[000:20:07;422] GIVES US AN IDEA HOW THE
[000:20:08;924] INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO MAP
[000:20:09;758] THIS INVESTIGATION, WHICH COULD
[000:20:11;193] GO ON FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS, SHEP.
[000:20:14;096] >> Shepard: TRACE GALLAGHER ON
[000:20:15;130] SCENE.
[000:20:15;430] EACH ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN
[000:20:17;633] LAS VEGAS HAS HIS OR OWN STORY.
[000:20:19;301] ALL OF THEM HAVE PEOPLE THAT
[000:20:21;103] CARE ABOUT THEM, WHO MISS THEM,
[000:20:23;805] WHO MOURN THEM.
[000:20:24;840] WE'LL REMEMBER THE ONES ABOUT
[000:20:26;575] WHICH WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND TELL
[000:20:28;510] YOU ABOUT THEIR LIVES NEXT.
[000:20:30;812] FIRST, TWO YEARS AGO, THE
[000:20:33;181] REPLICA EIFFEL TOWER AT THE
[000:20:35;183] PARIS CASINO IN LAS VEGAS WENT
[000:20:36;919] DARK IN MEMORY OF ALL THAT WENT
[000:20:39;821] DIED IN A TERROR ATTACK IN THE
[000:20:42;557] FRENCH CAPITOL.
[000:20:43;759] LAST NIGHT, THE ORIGINAL
[000:20:45;861] RETURNED THE RESPECT.
[000:20:47;496] DARKENING THOSE THAT WERE KILLED
[000:20:48;664] IN LAS VEGAS AND A WEEKEND
[000:20:51;066] TERROR ATTACK IN MARSEILLE.
[000:20:57;205] THE NEWS CONTINUES NEXT.
[000:20:58;373] al stooe
[000:20:59;441] when this guy got a flat tire
[000:21:00;709] in the middle of the night,
[000:21:01;743] so he got home safe.
[000:21:04;947] Yeah, my dad says our
[000:21:04;947] insurance doesn't have that.
[000:21:07;416] What?!
[000:21:08;283] You can leave worry behind
[000:21:09;651] when Liberty stands with you™.
[000:21:11;353] Liberty Mutual Insurance.

[000:21:15;223] with an ingredient
[000:21:17;459] originally discovered...
[000:21:18;994] in jellyfish.
[000:21:20;228] In clinical trials,
[000:21:20;228] Prevagen has been shown
[000:21:22;431] to improve short-term memory.
[000:21:25;133] Prevagen. The name to remember.
[000:24:14;002] >> Shepard: MUCH OF THE FOCUS IN
[000:24:15;737] LAS VEGAS HAS BEEN ON THE
[000:24:17;005] SHOOTER FOLLOWING THE MASSACRE.
[000:24:18;907] BUT STORIES AFTER HEROISM
[000:24:22;043] CONTINUE TO EMERGE.
[000:24:22;878] FOR INSTANCE, 30-YEAR-OLD COPY
[000:24:25;347] MACHINE REPAIR MAN JONATHAN
[000:24:28;049] SMITH.
[000:24:28;350] ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON
[000:24:30;785] POST," THE FATHER OF THREE WAS
[000:24:32;287] SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY BUT
[000:24:33;889] STAYED BEHIND TO DIRECT DOZENS
[000:24:35;123] OF PEOPLE TO SAFETY.
[000:24:37;225] A BULLET STRUCK HIM IN THE NECK
[000:24:39;361] LEAVING HIM WITH A CRACKED RIB
[000:24:41;563] AND BRUISED LINK.
[000:24:42;998] THEN THERE'S 29-YEAR-OLD MARINE
[000:24:46;401] VETERAN TAYLOR WINSTON WHO SAID
[000:24:48;904] HE STOLE A TRUCK TO DRIVE PEOPLE
[000:24:50;172] TO THE HOSPITAL.
[000:24:51;106] HE TRANSPORTED BETWEEN 20 AND 30
[000:24:54;609] PEOPLE AND LATER RETURNED THE
[000:24:56;044] KEYS TO THE TRUCK'S OWNER AND
[000:24:58;346] THEN THERE'S TRAVIS PHIPPEN AN
[000:25:01;449] EMT.
[000:25:01;883] HE STAYED BEHIND TO REVIVE HIS
[000:25:03;485] FATHER THAT WAS SHOT.
[000:25:04;653] ONE OF THE GUNMAN'S BULLETS HIT
[000:25:07;189] TRAVIS WHO IS EXPECTED TO
[000:25:08;757] SURVIVE.
[000:25:09;090] HIS FATHER DID NOT MAKE IT OUT
[000:25:12;394] ALIVE.
[000:25:12;827] HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WENT TO
[000:25:14;462] HOSPITALS AFTER THE SHOOTING AND
[000:25:15;931] SOME DOCTORS HAVE SAID IT WAS
[000:25:17;966] VERY TOUGH TO KEEP UP AS THE
[000:25:20;902] PATIENTS KEPT COMING.
[000:25:22;704] OUR CHIEF CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN
[000:25:24;272] HUNT IS LIVE AT UNIVERSITY
[000:25:25;407] MEDICAL CENTER IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:25:27;209] JONATHAN, HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE
[000:25:28;343] STILL LISTED AS CRITICAL?
[000:25:30;212] >> WELL, THERE'S TWO HOSPITALS
[000:25:31;947] WITH CRITICAL PATIENTS NOW.
[000:25:34;149] OVER AT SUNRISE MEDICAL, THEY
[000:25:35;884] HAVE 33 IN CRITICAL CONDITION.
[000:25:37;953] HERE AT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
[000:25:40;288] CENTER, 20 REMAIN AT THIS POINT
[000:25:42;791] IN THE ICU.
[000:25:43;758] I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE SURGEONS
[000:25:46;027] WHO HAS BEEN WORKING DAY AND
[000:25:47;229] NIGHT HERE.
[000:25:47;963] HE SAID MANY OF THE GUNSHOT
[000:25:50;432] WOUNDS WERE SO HORRIFIC, A LOT
[000:25:53;068] OF THE STAFF WILL LIKELY NEED
[000:25:56;905] PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.
[000:25:57;872] LISTEN HERE.
[000:25:58;707] >> THERE WAS A LOT OF ANXIETY
[000:26:02;811] AND LOSS OF FOCUS.
[000:26:04;579] THAT CAN BE EASILY CORRECTED.
[000:26:06;982] THE UNCONSCIOUS FORMS OF STRESS
[000:26:09;651] ARE THINGS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE IN
[000:26:10;685] THE SECOND AND THIRD DAY.
[000:26:12;487] WE HAVE DEBRIEFING TEAMS
[000:26:14;055] OFFERING SERVICE TO THE STAFF.
[000:26:15;257] >> A REMINDER, SHEP, AS WELL AS
[000:26:20;528] SO MANY PHYSICAL SCARS, THERE
[000:26:22;530] WILL BE MANY MENTAL SCARS THAT
[000:26:26;568] WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL.
[000:26:28;570] >> TELL US HOW THE MURDERER
[000:26:31;106] MODIFIED THE WEAPONS TO SHOOT
[000:26:32;407] MORE BULLETS QUICKLY.
[000:26:34;142] >> YEAH,  WE TALKED TO AN ATF
[000:26:38;747] SERVICE THAT SAID SOME OF THE
[000:26:40;582] WEAPONS WERE MODIFIED AS WHAT IS
[000:26:42;284] CALLED A SLIDE-FIRE MECHANISM.
[000:26:45;287] THE INFORMATION APPARENTLY AND
[000:26:46;154] THE COMPONENTS TO DO THAT EASILY
[000:26:48;256] AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.
[000:26:49;691] THIS VIDEO IS FROM ONE SUCH
[000:26:51;493] SITE.
[000:26:51;793] WE DON'T KNOW THAT MR. PADDOCK
[000:26:54;529] USED THIS PARTICULAR SITE, OF
[000:26:55;730] COURSE, BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF
[000:26:56;765] WHAT IS OUT THERE.
[000:26:58;066] WHAT IT DOES, ACCORDING TO OUR
[000:27:01;036] SOURCE, IS CHANGED THE SHOULDER
[000:27:03;471] REST AND EFFECTIVELY MAKE THE
[000:27:08;109] TRIGGER MIMIC FULLY AUTOMATIC
[000:27:10;445] OPERATION.
[000:27:11;880] OUR SOURCE SAYS THAT IT
[000:27:13;648] BASICALLY TURNS A SEMIAUTOMATIC
[000:27:15;750] RIFLE INTO A MACHINE GUN AND
[000:27:18;219] REMEMBER, PADDOCK WAS ARMED WITH
[000:27:21;256] MORE THAN ONE MACHINE GUN.
[000:27:22;490] THAT'S THE KIND OF FIREPOWER
[000:27:24;926] THAT RAINED DOWN ON THOSE
[000:27:26;728] INNOCENT CONCERT GOERS.
[000:27:31;966] >> THANKS, JONATHAN.
[000:27:33;268] FIRST A LOOK AT MORE OF THE
[000:27:36;137] VICTIMS.
[000:27:37;238] MEN AND WOMEN MURDERED AT A WARM
[000:27:42;844] WEEKEND NIGHT IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:28:00;662] People would stare.
[000:31:08;116] Psoriasis does that.
[000:31:10;451] It was tough getting out there
[000:31:10;451] on stage.
[000:31:14;789] I wanted to be clear.
[000:31:16;257] I wanted it to last.
[000:31:17;992] So I kept on fighting.
[000:31:19;127] I found something that worked.
[000:31:21;129] And keeps on working.
[000:31:22;530] Now?
[000:31:23;264] They SEE ME.
[000:31:24;766] SEE ME.
[000:31:26;067] See if COSENTYX could make a
[000:31:26;067] difference for you-
[000:31:28;369] COSENTYX is proven to help
[000:31:28;369] people with moderate
[000:31:30;505] to severe plaque psoriasis...
[000:31:31;973] ...find clear skin that
[000:31:31;973] can last.
[000:31:34;609] Don't use if you're allergic
[000:31:34;609] to COSENTYX.
[000:31:36;544] Before starting COSENTYX,
[000:31:37;645] you should be checked
[000:31:37;645] for tuberculosis.
[000:31:39;380] An increased risk of infections
[000:31:39;380] and lowered ability
[000:31:41;516] to fight them may occur.
[000:31:42;684] Tell your doctor if you have
[000:31:43;785] an infection or symptoms.
[000:31:45;086] Or if you have received a
[000:31:45;086] vaccine or plan to.
[000:31:47;221] If you have inflammatory
[000:31:47;221] bowel disease,
[000:31:48;823] tell your doctor if symptoms
[000:31:48;823] develop or worsen.
[000:31:50;892] Serious allergic reactions
[000:31:50;892] may occur.
[000:31:52;727] Never give up.
[000:31:53;761] SEE ME.
[000:31:54;495] SEE ME.
[000:31:55;330] Clear skin can last.
[000:31:58;333] Don't hold back...
[000:31:59;467] ...ask your dermatologist
[000:32:00;702] if COSENTYX can help you
[000:32:02;537] find clear skin that lasts.
[000:32:10;411] >> I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE
[000:32:11;412] FOX REPORT.
[000:32:11;913] MORE OF TODAY'S HEADLINES.
[000:32:13;381] THE U.S. BOOTING MORE THAN HALF
[000:32:15;516] OF CUBA'S DIPLOMATS FROM
[000:32:17;752] WASHINGTON.
[000:32:18;152] THIS COMES AFTER A MYSTERIOUS
[000:32:21;255] SONIC ATTACK AGAINST AT LEAST 22
[000:32:23;358] AMERICANS IN HAVANA.
[000:32:24;792] THE SYMPTOMS ARE BRAIN DAMAGE
[000:32:25;893] AND HEARING LOSS.
[000:32:26;928] THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS DENIED
[000:32:28;396] ANY INVOLVEMENT.
[000:32:29;931] THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO
[000:32:31;132] PULLING MOST OF ITS STAFF OUT OF
[000:32:33;201] CUBA AND WARNING AMERICANS
[000:32:35;637] AGAINST TRAVELING THERE.
[000:32:37;572] NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER A MASSIVE
[000:32:41;042] EARTHQUAKE ROCKED MEXICO, SEARCH
[000:32:43;678] TEAMS ARE STILL PULLING OUT
[000:32:47;215] BODIES.
[000:32:48;149] THE QUICK KILLED MORE THAN 300
[000:32:51;119] AND DAMAGED THOUSANDS OF HOMES.
[000:32:53;454] MUSIC FANS REMEMBERING TOM PETTY
[000:32:55;356] LEAVING CANDLES AND FLOWERS ON
[000:32:58;693] HIS HOLLYWOOD STAR.
[000:33:01;829] HIS MANAGER SAID HE WENT INTO
[000:33:03;398] CARDIAC ARREST AND DIED AT THE
[000:33:04;599] HOSPITAL.
[000:33:04;966] HE WAS 66.
[000:33:05;566] THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH SHEP
[000:33:06;401] AFTER THIS.
[000:33:07;135] eed in retirement?
[000:33:10;405] Then we found out how many years
[000:33:10;405] that money would last them.
[000:33:13;474] How long do you
[000:33:13;474] think we'll keep --
[000:33:14;609] Oooooohhh! You stopped!
[000:33:15;610] You're gonna leave me
[000:33:15;610] back here at year 9?
[000:33:18;146] How did this happen?
[000:33:19;614] It turned out, a lot
[000:33:19;614] of people fell short,
[000:33:21;649] of even the average
[000:33:21;649] length of retirement.
[000:33:23;651] We have to think about
[000:33:23;651] not when we expect to live to,
[000:33:26;888] but when we could live to.
[000:33:28;322] Let's plan for income that lasts
[000:33:28;322] all our years in retirement.
[000:33:32;493] Prudential.

[000:35:23;437] ISLANDS WHICH ARE STILL
[000:35:25;039] RECOVERING FROM HURRICANES IRMA
[000:35:26;174] AND MARIA.
[000:35:27;608] WE'LL HAVE THAT FOR YOU WHEN WE
[000:35:29;544] GET IT.
[000:35:30;111] TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH
[000:35:31;212] STORM VICTIMS IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:35:33;848] OFFICIALS SAY ABOUT 95% OF THAT
[000:35:36;017] ISLAND STILL HAS NO ELECTRICITY.
[000:35:38;052] THAT INCLUDES SOME HOSPITALS.
[000:35:39;554] LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL
[000:35:41;522] DESPERATE NEED OF THE BASICS.
[000:35:43;658] FOOD, FRESHWATER, FUEL AND
[000:35:45;026] MONEY.
[000:35:45;326] THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT COMES AS
[000:35:47;094] CRITICS SAY THAT THE FEDS HAVE
[000:35:49;063] BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND.
[000:35:50;565] PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR HAS
[000:35:52;700] DEFENDED THE TRUMP
[000:35:53;634] ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS.
[000:35:54;702] THE MAJOR OF SAN JUAN SAID LAST
[000:35:56;437] WEEK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
[000:35:58;139] KILLING US WITH INEFFICIENCY.
[000:36:00;107] THAT'S A QUOTE.
[000:36:01;275] SHE ALSO SAID THAT PUERTO RICO
[000:36:03;144] WAS HEADING TOWARDS GENOCIDE
[000:36:04;979] BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS.
[000:36:06;514] PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER THE WEEKEND
[000:36:07;982] PUSHED BACK SAYING THE MAJOR AND
[000:36:10;151] OTHERS HAVE SHOWN POOR
[000:36:11;953] LEADERSHIP.
[000:36:12;353] THE PRESIDENT ALSO TWEETED THAT
[000:36:14;522] THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS
[000:36:16;123] PROGRESS.
[000:36:16;524] DESPITE THAT, AS HE PUT IT,
[000:36:20;261] POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INGRATES
[000:36:23;564] WE'RE SAYING.
[000:36:25;433] THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD
[000:36:26;367] JOHN ROBERTS BEFORE LEAVING THE
[000:36:27;702] WHITE HOUSE THIS MORNING.
[000:36:29;403] >> I THINK SHE'S COME BACK A
[000:36:31;739] LONG WAY.
[000:36:32;840] NOW ACKNOWLEDGING WHAT A GREAT
[000:36:34;442] JOB WE'VE DONE.
[000:36:35;209] PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THAT.
[000:36:37;144] TEXAS AND FLORIDA, WE GOT AN A
[000:36:39;113] PLUS.
[000:36:39;413] I TELL YOU WHAT, WE'VE DONE JUST
[000:36:41;749] AS GOOD IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:36:43;351] IT'S A MUCH TOUGHER SITUATION.
[000:36:45;553] BUT NOW THE ROADS ARE CLEARED,
[000:36:48;222] COMMUNICATIONS ARE STARTING TO
[000:36:49;323] COME BACK.
[000:36:50;625] WE NEED THEIR TRUCK DRIVERS.
[000:36:52;059] THEIR DRIVERS HAVE TO START
[000:36:53;961] DRIVING TRUCKS.
[000:36:54;562] WE HAVE TO DO THAT.
[000:36:57;331] ON A LOCAL LEVEL, WE NEED MORE
[000:36:59;233] HELP.
[000:36:59;533] THE FIRST RESPONDERS, MILITARY,
[000:37:02;303] FEMA HAVE DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB
[000:37:04;538] IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:37:05;106] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:37:06;207] SHOOK HANDS WITH THE SAN JUAN
[000:37:07;942] MAYOR JUST BEFORE A BRIEFING ON
[000:37:09;911] THE RELIEF EFFORTS.
[000:37:11;012] YOU CAN MAKE OUT A LITTLE BIT OF
[000:37:12;813] THAT OR WHAT SHE SAID TO THE
[000:37:15;616] PRESIDENT.
[000:37:20;855] HERE, LOOK.
[000:37:24;592] >> Shepard: DURING THE BRIEFING
[000:37:25;760] WHEN THEY THANKED FEDERAL AND
[000:37:27;461] LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR THEIR
[000:37:28;896] EFFORTS, HE DID NOT MENTION THE
[000:37:31;165] MAYOR.
[000:37:31;465] THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THE
[000:37:39;240] TRUCKERS.
[000:37:40;875] ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTERS ON
[000:37:42;677] THE GROUND, MANY OF THOSE THAT
[000:37:44;145] WOULD MOVE THE SUPPLIES HAVE
[000:37:46;180] LOST THEIR HOMES AND VEHICLES IN
[000:37:47;348] THE STORM.
[000:37:47;848] SOME OF THE TRUCKERS CAN'T BE
[000:37:50;284] REACHED BECAUSE THERE'S NO
[000:37:51;419] COMMUNICATION WORKING IN SO MANY
[000:37:53;120] AREAS STILL.
[000:37:53;788] REPORTS THAT A UNION TRUCKER'S
[000:37:56;357] STRIKE ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS ARE
[000:37:58;926] NOT TRUE.
[000:38:00;328] THEY ARE IN FACT FAKE NEWS
[000:38:02;463] SPREAD LARGELY BY A WEBSITE
[000:38:04;598] CALLED CONSERVATIVE TREE HOUSE
[000:38:06;100] AND THEN OVER TWITTER AND
[000:38:08;135] FACEBOOK.
[000:38:08;803] AGAIN, THERE'S NO TRUCKER'S
[000:38:11;138] STRIKE.
[000:38:11;472] THAT'S FAKE NEWS.
[000:38:12;239] THE TRUCKERS IN PUERTO RICO ARE
[000:38:15;743] VICTIMS, TOO.
[000:38:16;744] THE CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:38:18;846] CORRESPONDENT HAS AN UPDATE.
[000:38:20;681] HI, JOHN.
[000:38:21;082] >> GOOD AFTERNOON, SHEP.
[000:38:23;985] THERE'S SO MANY VICTIMS IN
[000:38:25;886] PUERTO RICO AND THE PRESIDENT
[000:38:26;620] GOT TO MEET A FEW OF THEM.
[000:38:28;622] THE PRESIDENT WITH HIGH PRAISE
[000:38:29;824] FOR THE FEDERAL RESPONSE AND THE
[000:38:32;193] MILITARY.
[000:38:32;560] THE PRESIDENT THANKING VERY MUCH
[000:38:35;863] PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR WHO
[000:38:37;898] ALIGNS WITH DEMOCRATS FOR
[000:38:39;400] LEAVING POLITICS OUT OF THIS
[000:38:41;635] THING.
[000:38:41;936] THE DISCUSSION ABOUT STORM
[000:38:43;938] RELIEF.
[000:38:44;271] LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:38:46;040] SAID JUST A LITTLE WHILE AGO.
[000:38:47;708] >> HE WAS TREMENDOUSLY
[000:38:51;178] SUPPORTIVE.
[000:38:51;579] HE KNEW THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM
[000:38:52;580] THAT YOU HAD AT THE BEGINNING
[000:38:54;782] BEFORE AND THE LEVEL OF WHAT
[000:38:56;417] HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE
[000:38:59;120] TREMENDOUS STORMS THAT HAVE HIT
[000:39:01;122] YOUR BEAUTIFUL ISLAND.
[000:39:01;856] TO THE GOVERNOR, I WANT TO TELL
[000:39:03;724] YOU THAT RIGHT FROM THE
[000:39:06;193] BEGINNING, THIS GOVERNOR DID NOT
[000:39:07;561] PLAY POLITICS.
[000:39:08;729] HE DIDN'T PLAY IT AT ALL.
[000:39:10;765] HE WAS SAYING IT LIKE IT WAS.
[000:39:12;233] HE WAS GIVING US THE HIGHEST
[000:39:14;235] GRADES.
[000:39:14;568] ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY, I WANT
[000:39:17;204] TO THANK YOU.
[000:39:18;039] >> THE PRESIDENT SPENDING SOME
[000:39:19;040] TIME WITH RESIDENTS IN A
[000:39:22;476] SAN JUAN NEIGHBORHOOD AND WENT
[000:39:24;145] TO A LOCAL CHURCH, WHICH IS A
[000:39:26;947] DISTRIBUTION POINT FOR RELIEF
[000:39:33;521] SUPPLIES AND HANDING OUT RICE
[000:39:34;922] AND PAPER TOWELS.
[000:39:36;057] THE PRESIDENT HAS TWEETED ABOUT
[000:39:38;292] THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY
[000:39:39;627] IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO REBUILD
[000:39:41;662] PUERTO RICO AND JOKED THIS
[000:39:43;264] MORNING THE DISASTER HAS
[000:39:45;766] STRETCHED THE FEDERAL BUDGET A
[000:39:47;068] LITTLE BIT THIN.
[000:39:47;635] LISTEN HERE.
[000:39:48;235] >> I HATE TO TELL YOU, PUERTO
[000:39:50;571] RICO, BUT YOU'RE THROWING OUR
[000:39:52;006] BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF WHACK.
[000:39:53;407] WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IN
[000:39:55;543] PUERTO RICO.
[000:39:55;976] THAT'S FINE.
[000:39:56;877] WE SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.
[000:39:58;879] >> ON CAPITOL HILL, SENATOR
[000:40:02;349] CHUCK SCHUMER OF NEW YORK SAID
[000:40:04;285] HE DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE JOKE
[000:40:07;488] SAYING IT LOOKS LIKE THE
[000:40:10;624] PRESIDENT WAS BLAMING PUERTO
[000:40:12;059] RICO.
[000:40:12;359] A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO
[000:40:13;727] BLOW THE LINES FOR DISASTER
[000:40:16;030] RELIEF AND THE ENORMOUS DEBT IN
[000:40:17;565] PUERTO RICO.
[000:40:17;998] THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MAKE SURE
[000:40:19;066] THE FOCUS IS ON DISASTER RELIEF
[000:40:21;769] AND ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT PUERTO
[000:40:23;637] RICO'S DEBT WILL HAVE TO WAIT
[000:40:25;406] UNTIL LATER, UNTIL AFTER THEY
[000:40:27;608] HAVE RECOVERED FROM THE STORM.
[000:40:28;776] >> Shepard: JOHN, THE PRESIDENT
[000:40:29;577] WHILE IN PUERTO RICO TALKED
[000:40:31;145] ABOUT THE HORRIBLE MURDER
[000:40:33;747] RAMPAGE IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:40:34;615] >> YEAH.
[000:40:35;449] HE GETS BACK FROM PUERTO RICO
[000:40:36;383] LATE TONIGHT, TOMORROW MORNING
[000:40:37;485] AND WILL HEAD OUT TO LAS VEGAS.
[000:40:39;120] THE PRESIDENT SAYING A WHILE AGO
[000:40:41;155] IN TERMS OF THE TRIP TO
[000:40:42;623] LAS VEGAS, HE LOOKS FORWARD TO
[000:40:45;426] PAYING HIS PERSONAL RESPECTS AND
[000:40:48;062] CONDOLENCES TO EVERYONE.
[000:40:49;396] SUCH A TRAGEDY, SO UNNECESSARY.
[000:40:52;533] I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING
[000:40:54;835] TOMORROW.
[000:40:55;202] THE FIRST LADY WILL BE COMING
[000:40:56;604] WITH ME AND PAYING OUR RESPECTS.
[000:40:59;140] THE PRESIDENT SAID HIS ANXIOUS
[000:41:02;743] TO GET A FULL UNDERSTANDING WHY
[000:41:04;145] THE GUNMAN DID THIS AND A HIGH
[000:41:07;281] PRAISE FOR POLICE THAT RAN
[000:41:08;349] TOWARDS DANGER AND TRACKED DOWN
[000:41:09;884] WHERE HE WAS FIRING FROM.
[000:41:11;519] LISTEN HERE.
[000:41:13;087] >> WE HAVE A TRAGEDY.
[000:41:17;124] WHAT HAPPENED IN LAS VEGAS IS IN
[000:41:18;292] MANY WAYS A MIRACLE.
[000:41:21;128] THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE
[000:41:23;464] SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB.
[000:41:26;000] WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GUN LAWS.
[000:41:31;172] HIS A SICK MAN, DEMENTED MAN.
[000:41:34;308] WE'RE LOOKING INTO HIM VERY
[000:41:36;243] SERIOUSLY.
[000:41:36;610] BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH A VERY,
[000:41:38;746] VERY SICK INDIVIDUAL.
[000:41:39;813] >> A LOT OF THORNY POLITICAL
[000:41:42;183] ISSUES LIE AHEAD.
[000:41:43;350] DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT GUN
[000:41:44;718] CONTROL.
[000:41:45;052] A BILL IN CONGRESS THAT APPEARS
[000:41:47;688] TO HAVE BEEN SHELVED FOR NOW
[000:41:50;724] THAT MAKES SILENCERS ILLEGAL.
[000:41:53;394] I ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HIS
[000:41:54;895] POSITION.
[000:41:55;262] HE SAID WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT
[000:41:57;131] LATER.
[000:41:57;431] >> Shepard: THANK YOU, JOHN.
[000:41:58;399] IN PUERTO RICO, SOME BUSINESSES
[000:41:59;767] ARE STARTING TO REOPEN.
[000:42:01;268] AS WE HEARD, MANY AREAS OF THE
[000:42:03;504] ISLAND ARE STILL DEVASTATED AND
[000:42:05;706] IN NEED OF SO MUCH HELP.
[000:42:07;741] SOME FAMOUS PUERTO RICANS ARE
[000:42:10;044] CHIPPING IN.
[000:42:12;413] GERALDO RIVERA REPORTS FROM
[000:42:14;315] SAN JUAN.
[000:42:14;682] >> SHEP, PUERTO RICO IS SLOWLY
[000:42:16;884] GETTING BACK ON ITS FEET.
[000:42:19;587] A LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY.
[000:42:21;322] 95% OF THE PEOPLE ARE STILL
[000:42:24;225] WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER.
[000:42:26;093] EVEN HERE ON TOURIST STRIP.
[000:42:27;928] HALF THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
[000:42:29;129] RUNNING WATER AND A THIRD OF
[000:42:30;731] THEM HAVE ANY KIND OF CELL
[000:42:31;665] SERVICE OR INTERNET.
[000:42:32;566] THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM, NO
[000:42:34;969] COMMUNICATIONS.
[000:42:35;436] ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS
[000:42:37;204] UNDERREPORTED IS HOW THE PUERTO
[000:42:38;405] RICAN FAMILY, THE EXTENDED
[000:42:41;208] FAMILY, NEIGHBORS, RELATIVES AND
[000:42:42;443] SO FORTH ARE COMING TOGETHER TO
[000:42:44;845] HELP PEOPLE.
[000:42:45;713] J-LO DONATING A BUNCH OF MONEY.
[000:42:51;819] RICKY MARTIN CAME YESTERDAY.
[000:42:54;321] LOOK AT THIS CREW FROM QUEENS,
[000:42:55;889] NEW YORK.
[000:42:56;890] NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OTHER
[000:42:59;226] VOLUNTEERS BRINGING AID AND
[000:43:01;228] ASSISTANCE TO THEIR PUERTO RICAN
[000:43:05;933] FAMILY.
[000:43:06;267] >> WE CAME.
[000:43:06;700] THESE ARE DONATIONS THAT CAME
[000:43:08;068] FROM NEW YORK CITY.
[000:43:08;802] WE'RE GOING OUT TODAY TO TAKE
[000:43:10;571] CARE OF THEM.
[000:43:11;705] >> SHEP, MANY HERE IN PUERTO
[000:43:14;041] RICO ARE WORRIED THE PRESIDENT
[000:43:15;609] OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD BE
[000:43:17;645] DIVERTED BY THE AWFUL TRAGEDY IN
[000:43:19;013] LAS VEGAS.
[000:43:19;413] THE FOLKS ARE DELIGHTED THAT HE
[000:43:20;848] IS MAKING THE VISIT HERE TO
[000:43:23;250] PUERTO RICO AND WILL GO ON TO
[000:43:26;120] NEVADA ON WEDNESDAY.
[000:43:27;054] THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF
[000:43:28;222] LOOTING HERE IN PUERTO RICO.
[000:43:29;156] I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
[000:43:30;391] ACCORDING TO THE OFFICIALS, THE
[000:43:32;926] CRIME RATE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS
[000:43:35;663] IT WAS.
[000:43:36;163] THOSE REPORTS ARE EXAGGERATED.
[000:43:37;598] WHAT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED IS HOW
[000:43:39;099] THE PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE ARE
[000:43:41;068] COMING TOGETHER TO HELP EACH
[000:43:44;004] OTHER.
[000:43:44;972] REPORTING FROM SAN JUAN, SHEP,
[000:43:46;774] BACK TO YOU.
[000:43:47;508] >> Shepard: THANKS, GERALDO.
[000:43:49;843] BETWEEN THE CRISIS IN PUERTO
[000:43:52;846] RICO AND THE MASSACRE IN
[000:43:56;250] LAS VEGAS, THE PRESIDENT IS PUT
[000:43:57;751] TO A TEST.
[000:43:58;385] MORE ON HIS ROLE AS CONSOLER IN
[000:43:59;720] CHIEF NEXT.
[000:47:06;039] >> MORE ON THE PRESIDENT'S TRIP
[000:47:07;808] TO PUERTO RICO AFTER OFFICIALS
[000:47:09;009] THERE CRITICIZED THE FEDERAL
[000:47:10;644] RESPONSE TO HURRICANE MARIA.
[000:47:11;879] AT LEAST THE LOCAL MAYOR DID AND
[000:47:14;548] SOME OTHERS.
[000:47:16;083] PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR HAS
[000:47:17;651] PRAISED THE TRUMP
[000:47:18;852] ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO
[000:47:19;786] THAT DEADLY STORM.
[000:47:23;957] LET'S BRING IN ALEX FROM
[000:47:27;461] POLITICO.
[000:47:28;595] SAN JUAN IS COMING ALONG WELL.
[000:47:30;831] SOME OTHERS ARE NOT.
[000:47:32;132] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:47:33;333] THIS IS A REALLY TROUBLING
[000:47:35;702] SITUATION, WHAT YOU SAW TODAY IS
[000:47:38;405] THE PRESIDENT TRAVELED THERE AND
[000:47:40;307] TRIED TO BEST SPIN FORWARD ON
[000:47:42;643] WHAT HIS ADMINISTRATION'S
[000:47:43;710] EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SO FAR.
[000:47:45;445] EVEN AS HE'S GOTTEN TO THIS
[000:47:46;947] FIGHT WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS
[000:47:49;149] THERE.
[000:47:49;449] A LOT OF THIS SEEMED TO BE ABOUT
[000:47:52;386] THE PRESIDENT TRYING TO DEFEND
[000:47:53;987] HIMSELF AND HIS WHITE HOUSE AND
[000:47:55;289] HOW THEY HAVE DONE SO FAR IN
[000:47:57;824] MANAGING THIS CRISIS.
[000:48:00;127] >> Shepard: IT WAS A BIT OF A
[000:48:01;128] PRESS AVAILABILITY AND PHOTO
[000:48:04;298] OPPORTUNITY THERE UNLIKE ANY
[000:48:08;201] I'VE SEEN WITH PREVIOUS
[000:48:09;970] PRESIDENTS AT DISASTERS.
[000:48:11;471] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:48:12;539] YOU GOT THE SENSE THAT THE
[000:48:13;807] PRESIDENT WAS TRYING TO PUT ON A
[000:48:15;442] SHOW HERE AND TRYING TO
[000:48:18;545] ADVERTISE HIMSELF AND WHAT HE'S
[000:48:20;047] DONE AND DEFEND HIMSELF AND HIS
[000:48:21;748] ADMINISTRATION.
[000:48:22;215] YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING ABOUT
[000:48:24;885] THIS TRIP AND WHAT YOU'LL ALSO
[000:48:26;587] SEE WITH THIS TRIP THAT WILL
[000:48:28;922] COME TOMORROW WITH LAS VEGAS.
[000:48:32;960] THIS SQUEAK SPOTLIGHTS A ROLE
[000:48:35;228] THAT TRUMP HADN'T NECESSARILY
[000:48:37;130] EXPECTED TO PLAY WHEN HE FIRST
[000:48:38;532] RAN FOR PRESIDENT, WHICH IS THAT
[000:48:40;300] OF CONSOLER IN CHIEF.
[000:48:41;802] THAT OF A LEADER THAT IS COMING
[000:48:44;271] TO THE COMFORT --
[000:48:45;172] >> Shepard: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE
[000:48:45;973] WOULDN'T EXPECT TO DO THAT.
[000:48:48;141] EVERY PRESIDENT FOREVER HAS HAD
[000:48:49;309] TO DO THAT.
[000:48:50;344] LOOK HOW GREAT RONALD REAGAN WAS
[000:48:51;211] AT IT ON THE HEELS OF THE
[000:48:53;447] CHALLENGER DISASTER.
[000:48:54;615] EACH PRESIDENT SINCE THEN HAS
[000:48:56;350] HAD A SHINING MOMENT IN TIMES OF
[000:48:58;385] NEED, I WOULD SAY.
[000:48:59;319] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:49:00;053] AT ONE TIME OR THE OTHER.
[000:49:01;922] YOU'RE SEEING A PRESIDENT THAT
[000:49:03;490] CAMPAIGNED ON THE IDEA THAT HE
[000:49:04;257] WAS GOING TO BE A STRONG MAN
[000:49:07;227] LIKE FIGURE, A FIGURE OF
[000:49:09;229] STRENGTH.
[000:49:09;596] HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT HE
[000:49:11;531] DIDN'T REALLY CAMPAIGN ON.
[000:49:12;899] >> Shepard: ALEX, HAVE TO CUT IT
[000:49:15;502] SHORT.
[000:49:15;802] THERE'S NEW INFORMATION COMING
[000:49:16;536] IN TO FOX NEWS ABOUT THE
[000:49:19;272] INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS
[000:49:20;340] MASSACRE, INCLUDING WORD THAT
[000:49:22;009] THE FEDS HAVE TALKED WITH AN
[000:49:23;410] IMMEDIATE RELATIVE OF THE
[000:49:26;480] GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.
[000:49:27;214] WE HAVE BRAND NEW DETAILS.
[000:49:30;384] OUR CHIEF INTELLIGENCE
[000:49:32;853] CORRESPONDENT CATHERINE HERRIDGE
[000:49:35;222] JUST PULLED THEM TOGETHER.
[000:49:36;156] LIVE TO HER NEXT.
[000:49:40;093] KEEPING ME FROM THE
[000:49:40;093] THINGS I LOVE TO DO.
[000:49:43;030] TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR,
[000:49:44;765] AND CALL
[000:49:44;765] 844-214-2424.
[000:49:52;606] I just saved thousands
[000:49:52;606] In less than a minute, I found
[000:49:52;606] out how much home I can afford.
[000:49:55;609] I like how you shop for loans
[000:49:57;277] the same way you
[000:49:57;277] shop for flights online.
[000:49:59;513] I didn't realize at LendingTree
[000:50:01;114] you can save money
[000:50:01;114] on almost any sort of loan.
[000:50:03;450] I consolidated my credit card
[000:50:03;450] debt with a personal loan.
[000:50:07;454] I found a new credit card
[000:50:07;454] with 0% interest for 15 months.
[000:50:11;858] You just shop, compare,
[000:50:11;858] and save. And it's all free.
[000:50:15;128] Go to LendingTree right now
[000:50:16;963] and start saving.
[000:52:50;634] >> Shepard: BREAKING NEWS NOW.
[000:52:51;835] WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE
[000:52:53;904] INVESTIGATION OF THE MASSACRE IN
[000:52:55;605] LAS VEGAS.
[000:52:56;106] A U.S. GOVERNMENT SOURCE SAYS
[000:52:57;474] THE FEDS HAVE INTERVIEWED A
[000:52:59;609] RELATIVE OF THE SHOOTER'S
[000:53:02;078] GIRLFRIEND AND WE HAVE JUST
[000:53:03;180] LEARNED THAT IN THE 70s AND 80s,
[000:53:04;781] THE SHOOTER WORKED AS A LETTER
[000:53:07;350] CARRIER AND AN IRS AGENT
[000:53:11;054] SEPARATELY FOR A TOTAL OF A
[000:53:13;957] DECADE.
[000:53:14;291] SO WHAT ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW
[000:53:15;392] WITH THE GIRLFRIEND'S FAMILY?
[000:53:16;760] CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS THAT LIVE
[000:53:17;928] IN WASHINGTON.
[000:53:19;896] KATHERINE?
[000:53:20;263] >> I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
[000:53:21;631] INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY
[000:53:22;399] WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
[000:53:24;301] PRODUCER, JAKE GIBSON.
[000:53:25;569] WE CONFIRMED THROUGH A U.S.
[000:53:27;504] GOVERNMENT SOURCE THAT FEDERAL
[000:53:29;472] INVESTIGATORS HAVE INTERVIEWED A
[000:53:31;208] IMMEDIATE RELATIVELY MARILOU
[000:53:32;842] DANLEY.
[000:53:33;176] THIS RELATIVE SAID TO THE FBI
[000:53:34;811] THAT THEY FOUND PADDOCK UNSTABLE
[000:53:36;446] AND HE MADE THEM UNCOMFORTABLE.
[000:53:38;048] FBI OFFICIALS DECLINED TO
[000:53:39;649] COMMENT ON THIS INTERVIEW ONE
[000:53:41;251] WAY OR THE OTHER TO FOX NEWS
[000:53:48;592] EARLIER TODAY.
[000:53:50;026] AND THE FBI RAN PADDOCK THROUGH
[000:53:53;129] THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM.
[000:53:54;064] WE'RE TOLD IT WILL TAKE A DAY OR
[000:53:55;432] TWO TO PROCESS HIS RECORD.
[000:53:57;067] THE FBI INDICATED IN CONNECTION
[000:53:59;035] TO TERROR WAS MADE BEFORE THE
[000:54:00;870] FULL ANALYSIS OF HIS ELECTRONICS
[000:54:03;673] WAS COMPLETE, SHEP.
[000:54:05;075] >> Shepard: CATHERINE, WHAT DO
[000:54:05;909] WE KNOW ABOUT THE MONEY THAT
[000:54:07;711] THIS MURDERER SENT OVERSEAS
[000:54:10;914] PRIOR TO THE MASSACRE?
[000:54:13;717] >> INVESTIGATORS HAVE DISCOVERED
[000:54:15;585] THAT PADDOCK SENT TENS OF
[000:54:17;954] THOUSANDS OVERSEAS AND MAY HAVE
[000:54:19;356] BEEN TO THE GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU
[000:54:21;057] DANLEY.
[000:54:21;491] THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.
[000:54:23;026] THEY THINK IT WAS TO THE
[000:54:24;928] PHILIPPINES BUT THERE'S
[000:54:27;230] CONFUSION OVER HER LOCATION AND
[000:54:29;232] WHETHER SHE'S IN JAPAN.
[000:54:30;400] HE SEND A LOT OF MONEY OVERSEAS
[000:54:34;404] BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND
[000:54:36;673] INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO
[000:54:37;374] DETERMINE IF IT WENT TO THIS
[000:54:38;675] GIRLFRIEND OR SOMEONE ASSOCIATED
[000:54:40;777] WITH HER, SHEP.
[000:54:41;845] >> Shepard: CATHERINE A LOT OF
[000:54:44;214] GAPS IN THE STORY OF THIS MAN.
[000:54:46;383] AUTHORITIES SAY IT'S SO RARE TO
[000:54:47;417] HAVE A SHOOTING WITHOUT A
[000:54:49;119] MOTIVE.
[000:54:49;452] SOMETHING THEY HAVE NOT FOUND.
[000:54:50;420] >> EVERYONE I SPEAK TO ABOUT
[000:54:53;156] THIS CASE, SHEP, TALKS ABOUT IT
[000:54:54;557] AS BEING AN ANOMALY.
[000:54:59;929] YOU KNOW FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE
[000:55:01;131] COVERING THESE EVENTS, THAT
[000:55:03;233] USUALLY WITHIN 24 HOURS YOU HAVE
[000:55:04;601] A GOOD SENSE OF THE SHOOTER AND
[000:55:06;136] A LIKELY MOTIVATION.
[000:55:07;904] THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF PRESENCE
[000:55:09;572] ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR THEY HAVE
[000:55:11;274] BEEN ON BLOGS WRITING ABOUT
[000:55:12;676] THEIR POINT OF VIEW.
[000:55:13;843] THIS GUY IS REALLY A GHOST WHEN
[000:55:16;413] IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND NO
[000:55:18;214] ONE HAS COME FORWARD IN A VERY
[000:55:20;150] PUBLIC WAY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
[000:55:21;251] HIS MOTIVATION MAY HAVE BEEN ON
[000:55:23;453] THE IDEOLOGY.
[000:55:24;854] BUT WHAT IS CLEAR FROM THE SCOPE
[000:55:25;955] OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE
[000:55:28;124] LOCATIONS, THE FIREPOWER, THE
[000:55:30;226] AMMUNITION, ALL OF THESE THINGS
[000:55:31;528] WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST
[000:55:32;929] 24 HOURS IS THAT IT TOOK
[000:55:35;131] SIGNIFICANT PREMEDDATION, RIGHT?
[000:55:36;499] IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
[000:55:38;134] THROW TOGETHER ON SHORT NOTICE.
[000:55:39;235] >> Shepard: NOT THIS CLEARLY.
[000:55:40;470] >> YEAH.
[000:55:40;870] >> Shepard: NICE TO TALK WITH
[000:55:41;905] YOU.
[000:55:42;172] THANK YOU.
[000:55:42;572] >> YOU BET.
[000:55:43;273] >> Shepard: WE'LL BE BACK WITH A
[000:55:45;241] LOOK AT TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS
[000:55:47;811] COURT VERDICTS IN AMERICAN
[000:55:49;112] HISTORY AND BOTH OF THEM
[000:55:49;779] HAPPENED ON THIS DAY.
[000:55:51;648] (AVO)
[000:55:51;648] When you have type 2 diabetes,
[000:55:51;648] you manage your A1C,
[000:57:28;978] but you also have a higher risk
[000:57:28;978] of heart attack or stroke.
[000:57:31;648] Non-insulin Victoza®
[000:57:31;648] lowers A1C,
[000:57:34;951] and now reduces
[000:57:34;951] cardiovascular risk.
[000:57:37;720] Victoza® lowers my
[000:57:37;720] A1C and blood sugar
[000:57:40;657] better than
[000:57:40;657] the leading
[000:57:40;657] branded pill.
[000:57:42;392] (AVO)
[000:57:42;392] And for people with
[000:57:42;392] type 2 diabetes
[000:57:44;527] treating cardiovascular disease,
[000:57:44;527] Victoza® is NOW approved
[000:57:47;997] to lower the risk of major
[000:57:47;997] cardiovascular events
[000:57:50;667] such as heart attack,
[000:57:50;667] stroke, or death.
[000:57:52;602] And while it isn't
[000:57:52;602] for weight loss,
[000:57:54;838] Victoza® may
[000:57:54;838] help you lose some weight.
[000:57:57;140] (AVO)
[000:57:57;140] Victoza® is not for people with
[000:57:57;140] type 1 diabetes
[000:57:59;943] or diabetic ketoacidosis.
[000:58:01;678] Do not take Victoza® if you have
[000:58:01;678] a personal or family history
[000:58:04;581] of medullary thyroid cancer,
[000:58:06;349] Multiple Endocrine
[000:58:06;349] Neoplasia syndrome type 2,
[000:58:09;018] or if you are allergic
[000:58:09;018] to Victoza®
[000:58:10;687] or any of its ingredients.
[000:58:12;355] Stop taking Victoza® and get
[000:58:12;355] medical help right away
[000:58:14;858] if you get symptoms of a serious
[000:58:14;858] allergic reaction such as rash,
[000:58:18;328] swelling, difficulty breathing
[000:58:18;328] or swallowing.
[000:58:20;630] Serious side effects may happen,
[000:58:20;630] including pancreatitis.
[000:58:23;299] So, stop taking Victoza®
[000:58:23;299] and call your doctor right away
[000:58:25;869] if you have severe pain
[000:58:25;869] in your stomach area.
[000:58:28;304] Tell your doctor
[000:58:28;304] your medical history.
[000:58:30;306] Gallbladder problems have
[000:58:30;306] happened in some people.
[000:58:32;308] Tell your doctor right away
[000:58:32;308] if you get symptoms.
[000:58:34;644] Taking Victoza® with
[000:58:34;644] a sulfonylurea or insulin
[000:58:36;913] may cause low blood sugar.
[000:58:38;648] Common side effects are nausea,
[000:58:38;648] diarrhea, vomiting,
[000:58:41;284] decreased appetite,
[000:58:41;284] indigestion, and constipation.
[000:58:43;987] Side effects
[000:58:43;987] can lead to dehydration,
[000:58:45;889] which may cause kidney problems.
[000:58:47;390] Ask your doctor
[000:58:47;390] about Victoza®.
[000:59:01;371] >> Shepard: ON THIS DAY IN
[000:59:03;606] HISTORY, THE COURT HANDED DOWN
[000:59:07;076] TWO DIFFERENT VERDICTS TO O.J.
[000:59:10;313] SIMPSON.
[000:59:10;647] IN 1995, HE WAS CLEARED OF
[000:59:14;417] MURDERS NICOLE SIMPSON AND RON
[000:59:16;986] GOLDMAN.
[000:59:18;488] O.J. LED POLICE ON A LOW SPEED
[000:59:20;757] CHASE ACROSS L.A.
[000:59:22;425] PROSECUTORS SAID THEY HAD A
[000:59:23;860] MOUNTAIN OF EVIDENCE, A TRAIL OF
[000:59:25;228] BLOCK FROM ROCKINGHAM TO BUNDY.
[000:59:31;334] BUT JOHNNY COCHRAN SAID IF THE
[000:59:33;836] GLOVE DOESN'T FIT, YOU MUST
[000:59:36;573] ACQUIT AND THE JURY DID THIS DAY
[000:59:38;274] 22 YEARS AGO TODAY.
[000:59:39;208] AND ON THIS DATE, A.J. WAS
[000:59:41;377] CONVICTED ON CHARGES RELATED TO
[000:59:42;712] AN ARMED ROBBERY IN LAS VEGAS.
[000:59:45;481] INVESTIGATOR SAY HE STOLE SPORTS
[000:59:47;584] MEMORABILIA.
[000:59:48;184] O.J. SAID HE WAS JUST TRYING TO
[000:59:50;320] GET HIS STUFF BACK.
[000:59:51;220] THE JUDGE SENTENCED HIM TO 33
[000:59:53;556] YEARS IN PRISON.
[000:59:54;791] JUST TWO DAYS AGO HE WENT FREE
[000:59:57;760] ON PAROLE AFTER A COURT FOUND
[001:00:00;229] O.J. SIMPSON GUILTY NINE YEARS
[001:00:03;333] AGO TODAY.
[001:00:05;001] SHOULD NEWS BREAK OUT, WE'LL
[001:00:07;904] BREAK IN.
[001:00:08;504] BREAKING NEWS CHANGES EVERYTHING

[001:00:44;440] WAY OF SHOWING IT.
[001:00:45;408] THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THAT
