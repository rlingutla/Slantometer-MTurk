[000:00:01;735] THAT'S IT FOR THE SPECIAL REPORT
[000:00:02;902] FROM WASHINGTON WHERE WE REMAIN
[000:00:05;338] PROUD AND FEARLESS.
[000:00:06;272] HAVE A GREAT FATHER'S DAY
[000:00:06;940] WEEKEND.
[000:00:18;351] >>> THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.
[000:00:19;386] NO WORD FROM THE COMMANDER IN
[000:00:20;754] CHIEF AS THE UNITED STATES GETS
[000:00:21;821] READY TO STEP INTO ANOTHER WAR.
[000:00:24;891] INSTEAD, THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:00:26;393] STAFFERS LAY OUT A VAGUE PLAN TO
[000:00:28;561] ARM THE REBELS IN SYRIA.
[000:00:31;798] >> THERE NEEDS TO BE A
[000:00:33;299] CONSEQUENCE FOR A REGIME THAT
[000:00:35;101] USES CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:00:35;935] >> NOW THE UNITED STATES IS
[000:00:38;872] PLANNING TO SEND MILITARY
[000:00:39;906] ASSISTANCE.
[000:00:40;740] CRITICS SAY WE NEED TO DO MORE.
[000:00:42;308] >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GIVING
[000:00:44;010] THEM MORE LIGHT WEAPONS?
[000:00:45;779] IT IS INSANE.
[000:00:46;980] >> AND WHY THIS IS NOT ABOUT
[000:00:48;448] ONLY SYRIA BUT AN ENTIRE REGION
[000:00:50;583] THREATENING TO BLOW UP WITH HELP
[000:00:52;685] FROM THE TERRORIST GROUP
[000:00:55;321] HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS.
[000:00:56;856] AMERICAN INTERESTS AT STAKE AND
[000:01:01;494] THE PRESIDENT'S NEXT MOVE.
[000:01:03;830] >>> A SPORTS BAR DECK COLLAPSES.
[000:01:06;266] DOZENS OF PEOPLE PLUNGE INTO THE
[000:01:08;068] WATER.
[000:01:09;235] >> WE JUST SAW THE BAR FALLING
[000:01:10;270] INTO THE BAY.
[000:01:13;673] TONIGHT A LOOK AT THE FIRST
[000:01:15;341] FRANTIC MOMENTS AFTER THE DECK
[000:01:16;943] CAME CRASHING DOWN AT CHECKERS.
[000:01:21;548] BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS FRIDAY
[000:01:23;483] NIGHT, OUR NATION IS ABOUT TO
[000:01:24;884] GET INVOLVED IN A CIVIL WAR IN
[000:01:26;286] THE MIDDLE EAST.
[000:01:27;187] THINK OF IT.
[000:01:28;054] MAKE NO MISTAKE, IT IS A PROXY
[000:01:31;624] WAR.
[000:01:31;891] THE PLAYERS INCLUDE HEZBOLLAH,
[000:01:33;593] LEBANON, RUSSIA AND THE SYRIAN
[000:01:34;761] GOVERNMENT ON ONE SIDE WITH THE
[000:01:36;362] SYRIAN REBELS AND NOW THE UNITED
[000:01:38;932] STATES ON THE OTHER.
[000:01:39;599] SO WHAT'S THE GOAL?
[000:01:40;700] WHAT'S THE END GAME?
[000:01:42;202] WHAT ARE THE LIMITS?
[000:01:44;471] WHAT IF WE HELP THE REBELS AND
[000:01:46;673] THE IRAN AND THE OTHER SIDE
[000:01:48;675] WINS?
[000:01:48;975] WHAT THEN?
[000:01:49;676] IF THE WHITE HOUSE KNOWS OR HAS
[000:01:50;543] A PLAN, IT IS NOT TELLING THE
[000:01:52;312] AMERICAN PEEL.
[000:01:53;146] LAST NIGHT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT
[000:01:54;581] THE PRESIDENT, ANNOUNCED THE
[000:01:56;149] U.S. NOW HAS HIGH CONFIDENCE
[000:01:57;450] THAT THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS USED
[000:01:59;252] CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO KILL AT
[000:02:00;553] LEAST 100 PEOPLE.
[000:02:01;921] PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID THAT
[000:02:03;056] THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:02:04;257] WOULD CROSS A RED LINE AND HIS
[000:02:06;392] ADMINISTRATION IS MAKING MOVES
[000:02:07;894] TO START ARMING SYRIAN
[000:02:10;763] OPPOSITION FORCES.
[000:02:11;531] WHAT KIND OF MOVES?
[000:02:14;434] A GOOD QUESTION.
[000:02:15;301] >> I'M NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE
[000:02:17;103] DETAILS OF WHAT WE WILL PROVIDE
[000:02:18;972] BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT SCALE AND
[000:02:21;141] SCOPE OF WHAT WE'VE PROVIDED IN
[000:02:21;908] THE PAST.
[000:02:26;079] >> SHE DOES SAY THE OPTIONS DO
[000:02:27;714] NOT INCLUDE PUTTING AMERICAN
[000:02:29;149] TROOPS ON THE GROUND.
[000:02:29;916] THE UNITED NATIONS ESTIMATES AT
[000:02:31;117] LEAST 93,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN
[000:02:34;187] SYRIA'S TWO-YEAR CIVIL WAR.
[000:02:35;955] SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS SAY WE
[000:02:37;690] NEED TO DO MORE TO HELP THE
[000:02:38;858] CIVILIANS DYING AT THE HANDS OF
[000:02:39;659] A DICTATOR.
[000:02:41;394] MARCO RUBIO RELEASE AD STATEMENT
[000:02:43;096] WHICH READS IN PART, THERE IS NO
[000:02:45;231] MORE TIME FOR HALF MEASURES.
[000:02:46;966] OF COURSE, SYRIA IS SO
[000:02:48;701] IMPORTANT, LARGELY BECAUSE OF
[000:02:49;936] ITS LOCATION.
[000:02:50;803] RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN
[000:02:52;272] ALREADY VERY TENSE REGION.
[000:02:53;473] TO THE EAST, JUST PAST IRAQ IS
[000:02:56;976] IRAN.
[000:02:57;277] AND AN ALLY THAT HAS BEEN
[000:02:59;145] SENDING SUPPLIES TO THE SYRIAN
[000:03:00;713] REGIME.
[000:03:01;047] ON THE SYRIA'S WESTERN BORDER,
[000:03:03;750] LEBANON WHERE THE TERRORIST
[000:03:04;417] GROUP HEZBOLLAH RENEWED ITS
[000:03:05;818] PLEDGE OF ASSISTANCE TO SYRIA'S
[000:03:07;320] LEADER.
[000:03:07;654] AND SOUTH OF THAT IS ISRAEL.
[000:03:09;789] A NATION WHICH RECENTLY TARGETED
[000:03:12;959] SUSPECTED WEAPONS SHIPMENTS NEAR
[000:03:15;728] DAMASCUS AND TO SYRIA'S NORTH,
[000:03:16;596] TURKEY WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS
[000:03:18;164] ENGAGED IN A CRACKDOWN OF ITS
[000:03:19;766] OWN AGAINST PROTESTERS.
[000:03:22;035] MORE CONTEXT ON ALL OF THAT IN A
[000:03:24;337] MOMENT ALONG WITH SYRIA'S
[000:03:27;440] REACTION.
[000:03:27;807] FIRST LET'S GET TO ED HENRY AT
[000:03:29;175] THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:03:29;909] IF YOU CAN, PLEASE EXPLAIN TO US
[000:03:31;311] WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IN THE
[000:03:32;979] BUILDING BEHIND YOU.
[000:03:34;747] >> Reporter: THEY'RE BEING AS
[000:03:35;848] VAGUE AT THE WHITE HOUSE AS YOU
[000:03:36;649] SAID A MOMENT AGO IN TERMS OF
[000:03:38;218] DETAILS OF EXACTLY WHAT THE U.S.
[000:03:39;986] MILITARY IS GOING TO DO.
[000:03:40;987] WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIECE
[000:03:43;056] TOGETHER ARE INDICATIONS THAT
[000:03:43;790] WE'RE GOING TO BE SENDING SMALL
[000:03:45;625] ARMS.
[000:03:46;392] NOT THE HEAVY ARMS.
[000:03:49;829] NOT THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES
[000:03:51;864] THAT SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND
[000:03:52;932] OTHERS HAVE BEEN SAYING YOU
[000:03:53;666] REALLY NEED TO HELP THE REBELS
[000:03:56;302] TURN THE TIDE AGAINST PRESIDENT
[000:03:58;071] ASSAD.
[000:03:58;438] ABOUT ALL THEY ARE SAYING
[000:03:59;939] DIRECTLY IS THAT THEY IN NO WAY
[000:04:02;742] PLAN TO SEND U.S. GROUND TROOPS
[000:04:05;545] TO HAVE A DIRECT WAR INSIDE
[000:04:07;981] SYRIA.
[000:04:08;348] TAKE A LISTEN TO BEN RHODES.
[000:04:10;183] >> WE DON'T THINK IT IS IN OUR
[000:04:14;320] NAL NATIONAL INTERESTS TO SEND
[000:04:15;922] TROOPS.
[000:04:16;256] WE NEED TO BE HUMBLE ABOUT OUR
[000:04:17;390] ABILITY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM LIKE
[000:04:19;092] SYRIA.
[000:04:19;626] CERTAINLY ON OUR OWN.
[000:04:21;027] >> Reporter: AND THE OTHER THING
[000:04:22;462] THEY'RE BASICALLY RULING OUT AT
[000:04:25;531] LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM IS A
[000:04:26;232] NO-FLY ZONE OVERSEER I CAN'T.
[000:04:30;637] YOU'LL REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:31;371] ADVOCATED THAT.
[000:04:34;207] THAT WORKED IN 2011 HELPED GET
[000:04:36;809] GADHAFI OUT OF POWER.
[000:04:37;877] THEY'RE SAYING AT THE WHITE
[000:04:38;745] HOUSE, IT WILL BE MUCH MORE
[000:04:41;614] EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED TO
[000:04:42;315] ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT OVERSEER
[000:04:43;349] I CAN'T SO THEY'RE NOT PLANNING
[000:04:45;485] TO DO THAT.
[000:04:46;185] >> WE ENDED UP IN IRAQ FOR
[000:04:48;221] ANOTHER DECADE.
[000:04:49;055] THAT DIDN'T WORK ANY WAY.
[000:04:51;357] ONE MORE THING.
[000:04:53;192] 90,000 PLUS PEOPLE DID.
[000:04:55;028] YET THE FOCUS STILL SEEMS TO BE
[000:04:57;964] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:04:58;498] >> Reporter: RIGHT.
[000:04:59;065] THE WHITE HOUSE TRIED TO PUSH
[000:05:00;233] BACK ON THAT DICHOTOMY OF SAYING
[000:05:01;734] OF COURSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE
[000:05:03;403] 90,000 WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED.
[000:05:04;404] IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE RED
[000:05:05;972] LINE OVER THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:05:07;473] THAT APPARENTLY KILL 150 PEOPLE
[000:05:09;208] IN SYRIA.
[000:05:10;376] THEY SAY THEY CARE ENOUGH ABOUT
[000:05:11;577] THE TENS OF THOUSANDS THAT THAT
[000:05:13;212] IS WHY THEY SAID ASSAD SHOULD GO
[000:05:15;014] MONTHS AGO.
[000:05:16;382] THAT'S WHY THEY IMPLEMENTED
[000:05:17;684] SANCTIONS TO TRY TO PUSH HIM OUT
[000:05:19;085] OF POWER.
[000:05:19;819] BUT JOHN McCAIN SAID THAT IS NOT
[000:05:21;087] GOOD ENOUGH.
[000:05:21;988] HE SAID THE PROBLEM HERE IS
[000:05:23;589] THERE'S BEEN TOO MUCH FOCUS ON
[000:05:24;524] THAT RED LINE.
[000:05:25;591] NOT ENOUGH ON THE FOCUS ON THE
[000:05:27;360] SLAUGHTER OF THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
[000:05:29;896] TAKE A LISTEN.
[000:05:32;298] >> WE'VE DETERMINED THAT ASSAD
[000:05:34;100] HAS KILLED ABOUT 100 TO 150
[000:05:36;636] PEOPLE WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:05:37;904] HOW DID HE KILL THE OTHER
[000:05:40;139] 93,000?
[000:05:40;473] IT IS JUST, WHAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:05:41;841] DID WAS HE GAVE THEM A RED LINE
[000:05:43;676] BUT GAVE THEM A GREEN LIGHT TO
[000:05:47;013] DO EVERYTHING ELSE.
[000:05:48;181] >> YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE NOT
[000:05:49;549] HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT IN ALL
[000:05:50;683] OF THIS IN THE LAST FEW DAYS.
[000:05:51;984] WHEN WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM IS
[000:05:53;486] NEXT WEEK.
[000:05:53;986] THE G-8 SUMMIT IN NORTHERN
[000:05:55;922] IRELAND.
[000:05:56;389] HE'LL BE MEETING WITH ALLIES
[000:05:57;323] LIKE THE BRITS AND THE FRENCH
[000:05:58;791] WHO HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE ON
[000:06:00;026] THIS ISSUE.
[000:06:01;060] BUT ALSO INTERESTING, THE
[000:06:02;095] PRESIDENT ON MONDAY WILL HAVE A
[000:06:03;629] ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH THE
[000:06:04;997] RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR
[000:06:06;265] PUTIN.
[000:06:06;566] RUSSIA HAS NOT BEEN AN ALLY ON
[000:06:08;768] THIS.
[000:06:09;068] RUSSIA IS HELPING ASSAD IN
[000:06:13;272] SYRIA.
[000:06:13;606] THAT WILL BE A PIVOTAL MEETING
[000:06:15;742] ON MONDAY.
[000:06:16;509] >> THE SYRIAN REGIME IS NOW
[000:06:18;378] ACCUSING THE UNITED STATES OF
[000:06:19;445] USING CHEAP TACTICS IN PUTTING
[000:06:21;214] OUT A STATEMENT THAT WAS FULL OF
[000:06:26;352] LIES.
[000:06:27;553] IN RUSSIA A TOP FOREIGN AFFAIRS
[000:06:31;391] ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT SAID
[000:06:32;625] THE CLAIMS DID NOT LOOK
[000:06:34;227] CONVINCING.
[000:06:34;627] LET'S GET TO THE FOX REPORT'S
[000:06:37;764] CHIEF CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN
[000:06:39;766] HUNT.
[000:06:40;066] THERE IS A LITTLE MORE GOING ON
[000:06:41;868] ON SYRIA.
[000:06:42;602] >> IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO ANSWER
[000:06:44;070] THE QUESTION WHY NOW FOR U.S.
[000:06:46;172] ACTION, THE DEPUTY NATIONAL
[000:06:47;440] SECURITY ADVISER BEN RHODES
[000:06:50;109] ADMITTED THAT REBEL LOSSES
[000:06:51;844] THE GROUND IN SYRIA HAD AT LEAST
[000:06:54;647] AS MUCH TO DO WITH CHANGING
[000:06:57;717] PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CALCULUS AS
[000:06:58;985] DID THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:07:03;923] >> PARTICULARLY URGENT RIGHT NOW
[000:07:05;491] IN TERMS OF THE SITUATION ON THE
[000:07:07;226] GROUND IN SOME RESPECT, BECAUSE
[000:07:09;862] WE HAVE SEEN HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN
[000:07:13;499] INCREASE THEIR OWN INVOLVEMENT
[000:07:15;234] IN THE CONFLICT.
[000:07:16;335] >> AND HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS HAVE
[000:07:18;671] MADE A VERY REAL DIFFERENCE.
[000:07:21;007] JOINING PRESIDENT ASSAD'S FORCES
[000:07:22;575] IN THE RECENT BATTLE FOR THE
[000:07:26;479] CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TOWN OF
[000:07:28;748] QUSAIR AND WINNING ALONGSIDE THE
[000:07:30;850] EARL OF PRESIDENT ASSAD.
[000:07:32;185] THAT BY THE WAY WAS A CITY THAT
[000:07:34;821] THE REBELS HAD HELD FOR ONE
[000:07:36;589] YEAR.
[000:07:36;889] >> THE VIEWERS WILL REMEMBER
[000:07:37;990] THAT HEZBOLLAH FOUGHT ISRAEL IN
[000:07:40;860] THE SOUTH OF LEBANON AND
[000:07:42;195] ACCORDING TO MANY OBSERVERS,
[000:07:43;696] ISRAEL LOST.
[000:07:44;397] NOW HEZBOLLAH'S LEADER IS
[000:07:46;632] SPEAKING OUT ON THIS.
[000:07:47;500] >> YEAH.
[000:07:48;134] HE GAVE A SPEECH IN ONE OF HIS
[000:07:53;005] STRONGHOLDS AT BEIRUT, LEBANON.
[000:07:55;341] HE SAID THAT HEZBOLLAH HAS MADE
[000:07:58;044] A CALCULATED DECISION TO SUPPORT
[000:08:00;346] PRESIDENT ASSAD OF SYRIA AND
[000:08:02;882] THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
[000:08:05;051] ACCORDING TO DAVID SHENKER OF
[000:08:06;319] THE WASHINGTON INSTITUTE, THAT
[000:08:07;487] SORT OF SUPPORT MAKES A REAL
[000:08:08;721] DIFFERENCE.
[000:08:09;121] LISTEN.
[000:08:14;193] >> THEY ARE GETTING THE SUPPORT
[000:08:16;095] FROM RUSSIA, HEZBOLLAH, THEY CAN
[000:08:19;398] REVERSE THE MOMENTUM ENTIRELY
[000:08:20;666] AND WIN.
[000:08:21;300] THIS IS NOT IN OUR INTERESTS
[000:08:22;969] EITHER.
[000:08:23;302] >> NOW YOU HAVE HEZBOLLAH, IRAN
[000:08:25;004] AND FOR THE MOMENT, AT LEAST,
[000:08:27;106] RUSSIA ON ONE SIDE OF THIS
[000:08:29;542] CONFLICT.
[000:08:30;142] THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN
[000:08:32;512] POWERS ON THE OTHER.
[000:08:33;846] YOU HAVE THIS MAJOR SPLIT
[000:08:36;983] BETWEEN SUNNI AND SHIA MUSLIMS.
[000:08:39;085] THIS WHATEVER PATH WE CHOOSE
[000:08:41;153] WILL NOT BE EASY.
[000:08:42;622] >> AND VERY COMPLICATED.
[000:08:44;023] WE DID GET WORD OF MASS
[000:08:46;659] DEFECTIONS OF SYRIAN OFFICIALS.
[000:08:49;128] TURKISH STATE MEDIA REPORT AS
[000:08:50;863] MANY AS 73 SYRIAN MILITARY
[000:08:52;031] OFFICERS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE
[000:08:54;066] JUST CROSSED THE BORDER INTO
[000:08:55;635] TURKEY WHERE THEY'RE SEEKING
[000:08:57;770] REFUGE.
[000:08:58;204] 202 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN
[000:09:00;306] ALL, THEY TELL US.
[000:09:01;474] ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THEY ARE
[000:09:03;009] NOW IN A TURKISH REFUGEE CAMP
[000:09:04;744] WITH OTHER DEIF HE CANNERS.
[000:09:06;212] >>> A QUICK UPDATE ON THE NUMBER
[000:09:10;383] OF HIGH CRIMINAL PROFILES WE'RE
[000:09:12;952] FOLLOWING.
[000:09:13;352] FIRST, THE JUDGE REJECTED THE
[000:09:16;455] FT. HOOD SOLDIER'S DEFENSE THAT
[000:09:18;391] HE SHOT TALIBAN LEADERS IN
[000:09:19;926] AFGHANISTAN.
[000:09:20;359] THE JUDGE SAID NONE OF THE
[000:09:21;394] SOLDIERS POSED AN IMMEDIATE
[000:09:22;828] THREAT TO ANYBODY OVERSEAS.
[000:09:26;766] MAJOR YOU NEEDAL HASAN IS FACING
[000:09:30;436] MANY COUNTS OF MURDER.
[000:09:33;072] >>> AND GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAS A

[000:09:38;311] ZIMMERMAN.
[000:09:39;145] UNCOVERING THE MALICIOUS
[000:09:41;213] PROSECUTION OF MY SON, GEORGE.
[000:09:42;748] THE JUDGE ORDERED 23 POTENTIAL

[000:09:45;451] TUESDAY FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF
[000:09:46;986] QUESTIONING.
[000:09:47;420] GEORGE ZIMMERMAN HAS PLEAD NOT
[000:09:49;322] GUILTY TO MURDER IN THE
[000:09:50;122] SECOND-DEGREE AND SAID HE SHOT

[000:31:07;065] LEAK MORE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
[000:31:07;799] BASED ON THIS SEARCH IS SEEN AS
[000:31:09;901] CREDIBLE.
[000:31:10;268] >> NOW SOME SENATORS SAY THEY'RE
[000:31:11;402] TRYING TO LIMIT THE

[000:31:25;850] VERIFIABLE LINK TO TERRORISM OR
[000:31:28;653] ESPIONAGE.
[000:31:29;020] THE STATEMENT READS IN PART, THE
[000:31:31;055] DISCLOSURES OF THE LAST WEEK
[000:31:32;223] HAVE MADE CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN
[000:31:33;424] PEOPLE THE LAW IS BEING
[000:31:34;792] INTERPRETED IN A WAY THAT
[000:31:36;261] DAMAGES THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES
[000:31:37;595] AND THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET
[000:31:39;530] UP TO KEEP AMERICANS UNAWARE OF
[000:31:41;833] THE INTRUSION.
[000:31:43;301] NSA WHISTLE BLOWERS ARE RAISING
[000:31:44;802] NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A PROGRAM
[000:31:46;504] PUBLICLY DESCRIBED BY THE FBI
[000:31:48;740] DIRECTOR DURING CONGRESSIONAL
[000:31:49;741] TESTIMONY TWO YEARS AGO.
[000:31:51;476] IN THE WAKE OF THE FT. HOOD
[000:31:52;844] TERRORIST ATTACK WHICH ALLOWS
[000:31:54;045] FOR THE COLLECTION OF E-MAIL
[000:31:56;147] FROM A U.S. CITIZEN ON U.S. SOIL
[000:31:59;183] IN REAL-TIME.
[000:32:00;218] WE PUT IN PLACE TECHNOLOGICAL
[000:32:03;021] IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE
[000:32:04;355] CAPABILITIES OF A DATABASE TO
[000:32:06;190] PULL TOGETHER PAST E-MAILS AND
[000:32:07;792] FUTURE ONES AS THEY COME IN.
[000:32:10;128] SO THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN
[000:32:14;966] INDIVIDUALIZED SEARCH.
[000:32:16;134] THE DATABASE IS SEPARATE FROM
[000:32:19;270] THE P.R.I.S.M. PROGRAM, THE NSA
[000:32:23;741] REFERRED FOX TO THE FBI AND
[000:32:25;643] THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT
[000:32:26;511] BY THE BUREAU WHERE THEY WERE
[000:32:30;348] STUDYING THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE
[000:32:31;950] TESTIMONY.
[000:32:32;383] >> THANK YOU, MA'AM.

[000:32:36;587] REPORTEDLY WARNING AIRLINES, DO
[000:32:38;289] NOT LET ED SNOWDEN ON ANY
[000:32:40;191] FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.
[000:32:42;193] BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL
[000:32:43;127] NOT ALLOW HIM INTO THE COUNTRY.
[000:32:45;430] AND THEY'RE THREATENING TO FINE
[000:32:47;398] AIRLINES MORE THAN $3,000 IF HE
[000:32:49;100] DOES GO INTO THE U.K.
[000:32:50;468] THAT WILL DO IT.
[000:32:51;269] I MEAN, $3,000.
[000:32:52;603] THAT WILL BRING THE AIRLINE
[000:32:54;238] DOWN.
[000:32:54;639] NOW ONE COMMUNIST BACKED
[000:32:56;174] NEWSPAPER IN CHINA IS SUGGESTING
[000:32:57;809] THE GOVERNMENT HANG ON TO
[000:32:59;243] SNOWDEN FOR A WHILE.
[000:33:02;080] TRACE GALLAGHER, THIS GOVERNMENT
[000:33:04;882] IS CALLING TO GET OUT OF HIM
[000:33:06;517] WHAT THEY CAN.
[000:33:06;985] >> EXACTLY.
[000:33:07;885] MILK HIM OF ALL HIS INFORMATION
[000:33:09;721] AND THEN SEND HIM BACK TO THE
[000:33:10;788] UNITED STATES.
[000:33:11;422] THEY BELIEVE THE SECRETS HE HAS
[000:33:12;657] ARE VITAL TO CHINESE NATIONAL
[000:33:14;525] SECURITY AND NATIONAL INTERESTS.
[000:33:15;860] NOW, KEEP IN MINE THIS EDITORIAL
[000:33:18;129] COMES ON THE HEEL OF SNOWDEN
[000:33:20;031] SAYING THE U.S. HAS BEEN SPYING
[000:33:21;232] ON HONG KONG AND CHINESE
[000:33:23;534] COMPUTERS FOR YEARS.
[000:33:24;802] IT READS IN PART, QUOTING HERE,
[000:33:27;405] MAYBE HE HAS MORE EVIDENCE.
[000:33:28;639] THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
[000:33:29;674] LET HIM SPEAK OUT AND ACCORDING
[000:33:30;942] TO WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS
[000:33:32;710] PUBLIC, USE IT AS EVIDENCE TO
[000:33:35;246] NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITED STATES
[000:33:36;948] OPENLY OR IN PRIVATE.
[000:33:37;915] THE EDITORIAL WAS WRITTEN BY A
[000:33:40;218] NEWSPAPER THAT HAS LONG

[000:33:48;426] BARGAINING CHIP.
[000:33:49;327] LISTEN.
[000:33:49;761] >> CLEARLY, BEIJING IS NOW IN A
[000:33:52;130] CAT BIRD SEAT.
[000:33:52;730] IT CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP
[000:33:54;332] HIM OR SEND HIM BACK.
[000:33:55;633] THE CHINESE WHO ARE RUTHLESSLY
[000:33:57;335] PRACTICING MATTIC WILL DO
[000:33:59;237] EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN.
[000:34:00;605] I THINK THAT GLOBAL TIMES
[000:34:02;006] EDITORIAL THAT YOU REFERRED TO
[000:34:03;074] IS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING THE
[000:34:04;876] PRICE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
[000:34:06;310] TO PAY TO GET SNOWDEN BACK.
[000:34:08;212] WHEN WE GET HIM BACK, HE WILL
[000:34:09;647] HAVE DISCLOSED EVERYTHING TO
[000:34:12;617] BEIJING.

[000:34:22;293] STAPLES OR BEST BUY FOR $10.
[000:34:24;762] NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS TELL

[000:34:28;800] DRIVES AND OTHER OUTSIDE STORAGE
[000:34:30;168] DEVICES ARE FROWNED UPON.
[000:34:31;803] BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A SYSTEMS
[000:34:33;471] ADMINISTRATOR HE WOULD HAVE MORE
[000:34:34;906] LATITUDE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF
[000:34:36;607] STORAGE DEVICE ON HIM.
[000:34:39;544] >> CBS IS CONFIRMING THAT

[000:35:09;173] HE CAN'T RUN FOR A THIRD TERM
[000:35:11;676] UNDER THE IRANIAN RULES.
[000:35:12;710] OFFICIALS SAY THEY STENLED
[000:35:14;078] VOTING BY FIVE HOURS BECAUSE THE
[000:35:15;446] LINES ARE SO LONG.
[000:35:16;681] AND THE HIGH TURNOUT COULD MEAN
[000:35:18;850] MORE MODERATE VOTERS COULD SHOW

[000:43:59;670] WHO HAD STOPPED TAKING PROPECIA.
[000:44:02;806] THEY FOUND THOSE GUYS APPEARED

[000:44:24;762] IT IS CLINICAL DEPRESSION.
[000:44:26;130] THE THING IS, DOCTORS SAY
[000:44:28;165] TREATING IT IS DIFFICULT PROCESS
[000:44:29;366] OF TRIAL AND ERROR.
[000:44:31;502] AND THAT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL
[000:44:33;470] APPROACH DOESN'T WORK.
[000:44:34;138] NOW A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS AT
[000:44:36;240] EMORY UNIVERSITY IN ATLANTA SAYS
[000:44:37;875] THAT A QUICK BRAIN SCAN COULD
[000:44:39;677] HELP SOLVE ALL OF THAT.
[000:44:43;313] AND SAVE LIVES.
[000:44:45;049] JONATHAN HAS THE NEWS TONIGHT.
[000:44:47;518] >> Reporter: RESEARCHERS DO
[000:44:50;754] BELIEVE NOW THAT BRAIN SCANS
[000:44:52;156] WILL HELP DOCTORS PREDICT THE
[000:44:53;624] BEST POSSIBLE TREATMENT FOR
[000:44:55;392] THEIR PATIENTS WITH CLINICAL
[000:44:57;394] DEPRESSION.
[000:44:57;895] THE NEW STUDY SUGGESTS ACTIVITY
[000:44:59;797] LEVELS IN A SMALL REGION OF THE
[000:45:01;131] BRAIN CALLED THE ANTERIOR WILL
[000:45:08;472] RESPOND TO THERAPY.
[000:45:09;339] THEY MEASURE THE ACTIVITY AND
[000:45:10;674] THEN RANDOMLY ASSIGN PATIENTS TO
[000:45:13;277] 12 WEEKS OF TREATMENT.
[000:45:14;745] EITHER WITH THE COMMON
[000:45:18;215] ANTI-DEPRESSANT OR PSYCHO
[000:45:19;049] THERAPY.
[000:45:19;416] AND HERE'S WHAT THEY FOUND.
[000:45:22;419] >> THE PATIENTS WHO DO THE BEST
[000:45:25;856] ON THE DRUG HAVE HIGH ACTIVITY
[000:45:28;726] AND THE PATIENTS WHO DO THE BEST
[000:45:32;596] ON THERAPY HAVE LOW.
[000:45:33;630] >> THE GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE
[000:45:35;332] WELL AND TO DO IT AS FAST AS
[000:45:36;934] POSSIBLE.
[000:45:37;301] TO GET THEM WHAT THEY NEED AND
[000:45:38;969] AT THE SAME TIME ENSURE WE DON'T
[000:45:40;204] GIVE THEM A TREATMENT THAT WON'T
[000:45:42;439] WORK FOR THEM.
[000:45:45;075] >> THE HOPE IS THAT THIS WILL
[000:45:45;809] LEAD TO ADDITIONAL RESEARCH THAT
[000:45:47;745] ELIMINATES THE HIT AND MISS
[000:45:49;680] FACTOR INVOLVED WITH TREATING

[000:45:59;289] A SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT TO
[000:46:00;491] CONTROL HER OWN DEPRESSION.
[000:46:05;429] SHE SAID ELIMINATING THAT WAIT
[000:46:07;197] TIME COULD HELP.
[000:46:08;198] >> IT IS A FATAL DISEASE.
[000:46:09;533] MANY PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE AND
[000:46:11;101] THEY DO IT IN THE TIME THAT
[000:46:12;469] THEY'RE WAITING, QUITE OFTEN.
