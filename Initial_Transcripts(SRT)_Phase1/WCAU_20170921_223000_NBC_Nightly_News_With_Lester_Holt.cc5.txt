[000:14:17;823] For adults with advanced
[000:14:17;823] non-small cell lung cancer,
[000:14:20;626] previously treated with
[000:14:20;626] platinum-based chemotherapy,
[000:14:22;895] including those with an
[000:14:22;895] abnormal ALK or EGFR gene
[000:14:26;632] who've tried an FDA-approved
[000:14:26;632] targeted therapy,
[000:14:28;868] here's a question:
[000:14:28;868] Who wouldn't want a chance
[000:14:31;003] for another...?
[000:14:33;105] Who'd say no to a...?
[000:14:35;674] Who wouldn't want...
[000:14:35;674] a chance to live longer.
[000:14:39;078] OPDIVO (nivolumab).
[000:14:41;046] OPDIVO demonstrated longer
[000:14:41;046] life versus chemotherapy.
[000:14:44;850] Over 40,000 of these
[000:14:44;850] patients have been
[000:14:47;052] prescribed OPDIVO.
[000:14:48;520] OPDIVO works with
[000:14:48;520] your immune system.
[000:14:50;689] OPDIVO can cause your immune
[000:14:50;689] system to attack normal
[000:14:53;492] organs and tissues in your
[000:14:53;492] body and affect how they work.
[000:14:55;961] This may happen any time
[000:14:55;961] during or after treatment
[000:14:58;063] has ended, and may become
[000:14:58;063] serious and lead to death.
[000:15:00;499] See your doctor right away
[000:15:00;499] if you experience new or
[000:15:02;568] worsening cough; chest
[000:15:02;568] pain; shortness of breath;
[000:15:05;004] diarrhea; severe stomach
[000:15:05;004] pain or tenderness;
[000:15:07;439] severe nausea or
[000:15:07;439] vomiting; extreme fatigue;
[000:15:10;009] constipation;
[000:15:10;009] excessive thirst or urine;
[000:15:12;344] swollen ankles;
[000:15:12;344] loss of appetite;
[000:15:14;346] rash; itching;
[000:15:14;346] headache; confusion;
[000:15:16;348] hallucinations;
[000:15:16;348] muscle or joint pain;
[000:15:18;384] flushing; fever;
[000:15:18;384] or weakness,
[000:15:20;052] as this may keep
[000:15:20;052] these problems
[000:15:21;053] from becoming
[000:15:21;053] more serious.
[000:15:22;955] These are not
[000:15:22;955] all the possible
[000:15:24;023] side effects
[000:15:24;023] of OPDIVO.
[000:15:25;291] Tell your doctor about all
[000:15:25;291] your medical conditions,
[000:15:27;393] including immune
[000:15:27;393] system problems,
[000:15:29;028] or if you've had an
[000:15:29;028] organ transplant,
[000:15:30;763] or lung, breathing,
[000:15:30;763] or liver problems.
[000:15:35;034] Because who
[000:15:35;034] wouldn't want...that?
[000:15:37;937] Ask your doctor
[000:15:37;937] about OPDIVO.
[000:15:40;105] See OpdivoTV.com for
[000:15:40;105] this and other indications.

[000:15:57;356] Because he chooses to

[000:18:52;064] The day after chemo might mean
[000:18:53;565] a trip back to
[000:18:53;565] the doctor's office,
[000:18:55;300] just for a shot.
[000:18:56;468] But why go back there,
[000:18:56;468] when you can stay home...
[000:18:59;471] ...with Neulasta Onpro?
[000:19:01;673] Strong chemo can put you
[000:19:01;673] at risk of serious infection.
[000:19:04;309] Neulasta helps
[000:19:04;309] reduce infection risk
[000:19:06;311] by boosting your
[000:19:06;311] white blood cell count,
[000:19:07;846] which strengthens
[000:19:07;846] your immune system.
[000:19:09;481] In a key study,
[000:19:10;682] Neulasta reduced the risk
[000:19:10;682] of infection from 17% to 1%...
[000:19:14;186] ...a 94% decrease.
[000:19:16;221] Applied the day of chemo,
[000:19:17;489] Neulasta Onpro is designed to
[000:19:17;489] deliver Neulasta the next day.
[000:19:20;592] Neulasta is for
[000:19:20;592] certain cancer patients
[000:19:22;327] receiving strong chemotherapy.
[000:19:24;163] Do not take Neulasta
[000:19:24;163] if you're allergic to
[000:19:25;731] Neulasta or Neupogen
[000:19:25;731] (filgrastim).

[000:19:43;882] The most common side effect
[000:19:43;882] is bone and muscle ache.
[000:19:46;185] So why go back there?
[000:19:47;819] If you'd rather be home,
