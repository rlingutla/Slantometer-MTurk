[000:00:06;806] JUST BACK FROM A YEAR OF
[000:00:07;741] SERVICE AT GUANTANAMO BAY AND
[000:00:08;541] SURPRISED HIS DAUGHTER.
[000:00:10;677] 100 MILITARY OFFICERS WERE
[000:00:12;145] SENT HOME RECENTLY.
[000:00:14;381] THAT'S ALL FOR TONIGHT.
[000:00:14;981] THANKS FOR JOINING US.
[000:00:19;452] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP DOUBLING
[000:00:20;120] DOWN AFTER A NEW WAVE OF NFL
[000:00:24;391] PROTEST, CRITICIZING PLAYERS
[000:00:25;058] WHO REFUSED TO STAND FOR THE
[000:00:25;859] NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:00:28;962] I'M RICK LEVENTHAL.
[000:00:29;529] THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.
[000:00:38;905] MORE THAN 130 PLAYERS AND
[000:00:39;672] COUNTING, SITTING, KNEELING OR
[000:00:40;440] RAISING THEIR FIST DURING THE
[000:00:41;174] STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
[000:00:41;741] ONE TEAM, THE PITTSBURGH
[000:00:42;375] STEELERS STAYED IN THERE
[000:00:44;044] LOCKER ROOM.
[000:00:44;444] SOME LOCKED ARMS IN SOLIDARITY
[000:00:45;845] BUT SOME TEAM OWNERS WERE
[000:00:48;481] JOINING THEM.
[000:00:48;915] MANY ARE CONDEMNING THE
[000:01:07;700] PRESIDENT FOR COMMENTS THEY
[000:01:08;401] SAY ARE DIVISIVE.
[000:01:08;902] THE PRESIDENT ISN'T BACKING
[000:01:09;569] DOWN.
[000:01:09;869] A SHORT TIME AGO HE SAID
[000:01:10;537] SPORTS FAN SHOULD NEVER
[000:01:11;137] CONDONE PLAYERS THAT DO NOT
[000:01:11;838] STAND PROUD FOR THE NATIONAL
[000:01:12;539] ANTHEM WEATHER COUNTRY.
[000:01:13;139] NFL SHOULD CHANGE POLICY.
[000:01:13;807] KRISTIN FISHER IS REPORTING
[000:01:14;507] FROM SOMERSET NEW JERSEY NEAR
[000:01:15;241] THE PRESIDENTS PRIVATE GOLF
[000:01:15;909] CLUB.
[000:01:16;209] THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH
[000:01:16;843] REPORTERS LAST HOUR.
[000:01:17;410] WHAT IS HE SAYING NOW.
[000:01:18;111] >> IN SOME WAYS HE IS DIGGING
[000:01:18;878] IN AND IN SOME WAYS HE'S
[000:01:19;546] TAKING A STEP BACK.
[000:01:23;983] THIS MORNING ON TWITTER, HE
[000:01:24;784] ENCOURAGE SOME FANS TO GO TO
[000:01:25;685] GAMES AND HE RETWEETED SOMEONE
[000:01:28;988] WHO SAID THEY SHOULD BOYCOTT
[000:01:36;896] THE NFL.
[000:01:37;230] PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED
[000:01:37;864] DIRECTLY, ARE YOU CALLING ON
[000:01:38;565] YOUR SUPPORTERS TO BOYCOTT THE
[000:01:39;299] NFL.
[000:01:39;566] HE SAID NO.
[000:01:39;966] HE IS DIGGING IN HIS CRITICISM
[000:01:47;173] OF THE NFL PLAYERS WHO
[000:01:47;941] CONTINUE TO TAKE ANY DURING
[000:01:48;675] THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:01:49;242] HE SAYS THIS IS ABOUT RESPECT
[000:01:49;976] FOR OUR FLAG AND RESPECT FOR
[000:01:50;844] OUR COUNTRY AND NOTHING ELSE.
[000:01:52;579] >> THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
[000:01:53;346] RACE.
[000:01:53;646] I NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT
[000:01:54;881] RACE.
[000:01:56;783] THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
[000:01:57;684] RACE OR ANYTHING ELSE.
[000:01:58;284] THIS HAS TO DO WITH RESPECT
[000:02:00;920] FOR OUR COUNTRY AND RESPECT
[000:02:01;721] FOR OUR PLAYERS.
[000:02:07;393] >> THIS MORNING THE TREASURY
[000:02:08;094] SECRETARY STEVE HIT THE SUNDAY
[000:02:08;828] SHOWS TO TALK ABOUT TAX REFORM
[000:02:10;597] EMMA BUT HE WAS ALSO ASKED
[000:02:15;602] ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP TAKING
[000:02:18;705] THIS SITE WITH THESE POPULAR
[000:02:20;940] PLAYERS NOW.
[000:02:21;341] HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.
[000:02:25;311] >> THE NFL HAS ALL DIFFERENT
[000:02:25;979] TYPES OF ROLES.
[000:02:26;479] YOU CAN HAVE STICKERS ON YOUR
[000:02:28;681] HELMET, YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR
[000:02:29;616] JERSEYS TUCKED IN, I THINK
[000:02:32;986] WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING
[000:02:33;786] IS THAT THE OWNER SHOULD HAVE
[000:02:35;321] A ROLE THAT PLAYERS SHOULD
[000:02:45;398] HAVE TO STAND AND RESPECT FOR
[000:02:46;399] THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:02:46;966] THIS ISN'T ABOUT DEMOCRATS OR
[000:02:47;667] REPUBLICANS, IT'S NOT ABOUT
[000:02:48;334] RACE, IT'S NOT ABOUT FREE
[000:02:49;002] SPEECH.
[000:02:49;335] THEY CAN DO FREE SPEECH ON
[000:02:50;036] THEIR OWN TIME.
[000:02:50;503] THIS IS ABOUT RESPECT FOR THE
[000:02:51;204] MILITARY AND THE FIRST
[000:02:52;205] RESPONDERS IN THE CONCRETE.
[000:02:58;545] >> I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF
[000:02:59;412] PEOPLE OUT THERE TONIGHT WHO
[000:03:00;246] SAY THIS IS ONE BIG
[000:03:00;947] DISTRACTION TO TAKE AWAY FROM
[000:03:01;781] THE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE
[000:03:02;482] DAY.
[000:03:02;749] RICK, IF THIS IS A
[000:03:03;383] DISTRACTION, IT CERTAINLY IS
[000:03:04;617] WORKING.
[000:03:06;986] >> NO DOUBT.
[000:03:07;387] IT'S NOT JUST PROFESSIONAL
[000:03:08;054] FOOTBALL.
[000:03:08;421] HE ALSO HAS SOME A PROBLEM
[000:03:09;722] WITH SOME OF THE PLAYERS IN
[000:03:10;657] THE NBA.
[000:03:15;995] THERE IS AN INVITATION TO THE
[000:03:16;963] WHITE HOUSE BEING RESCINDED.
[000:03:17;664] WHERE DOES THAT CONTROVERSY
[000:03:20;099] STAND.
[000:03:20;466] >> WE ARE SEEING THE SPREAD TO
[000:03:21;234] OTHER TEAMS IN OTHER SPORTS.
[000:03:22;869] JUST BRING US UP TO SPEED, HE
[000:03:26;206] SAID HE WAS HESITANT TO GO TO
[000:03:27;240] THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER WINNING
[000:03:28;041] THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP ARE THE
[000:03:35;915] PRESIDENT CALLED YESTERDAY AND
[000:03:36;649] SAID FINE, I'M RESCINDING MY
[000:03:37;350] INVITATION AND NOW THE ENTIRE
[000:03:38;084] TEAM ISN'T GOING.
[000:03:38;585] PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY, HE
[000:03:39;252] PRAISED THE DIFFERENT TEAM IN
[000:03:40;520] A DIFFERENT SPEED AND
[000:03:41;087] TRANSPORT.
[000:03:41;454] THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS JUST
[000:03:46;626] ONE THE CUP.
[000:03:47;060] IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT
[000:03:50;396] STATEMENT.
[000:03:50;763] THE PITTSBURGH PENGUINS
[000:03:52;665] RESPECT THE OFFICE OF THE
[000:03:53;399] PRESIDENT AND THE LONG
[000:04:00;139] TRADITION OF CHAMPIONSHIP
[000:04:00;807] TEAMS VISITING THE WHITE
[000:04:01;407] HOUSE.
[000:04:01;708] ANY AGREEMENT OR DISAGREEMENT
[000:04:02;442] WITH THE POLITICS, POLICY OR
[000:04:05;378] AGENDA CAN BE EXPRESSED IN
[000:04:06;579] OTHER WAYS.
[000:04:06;980] WE ARE CERTAINLY SEEING
[000:04:07;580] PLAYERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
[000:04:10;316] ACROSS THE NFL, OWNERS
[000:04:10;917] INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP OWN
[000:04:12;285] FRIEND AND DONOR, THE OWNER OF
[000:04:18;424] THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS
[000:04:19;058] COMING OUT THINK THEY ARE
[000:04:19;926] DISAPPOINTED IN THE
[000:04:22;228] PRESIDENTIAL REMARKS THIS
[000:04:24;430] WEEKEND.
[000:04:24;831] >> KRISTIN FISHER, THANK YOU
[000:04:25;498] SO MUCH.
[000:04:25;832] FOR MORE LET'S GO TO JIM
[000:04:26;466] GRAY.
[000:04:27;233] THE FORECASTER AT FOX NEWS
[000:04:28;801] SPORTS.
[000:04:31;804] THEY MUST BE CRINGING OVER
[000:04:36;009] THIS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:04:36;709] >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
[000:04:37;243] THIS IS NOTHING THEY WANTED,
[000:04:37;944] AND NOW THEY ARE IN RESPONSE
[000:04:41;147] MODE AND THEY KNOW THE
[000:04:45;285] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
[000:04:46;085] HAS A TREMENDOUS FOLLOWING AND
[000:04:46;819] CAN BE VERY DAMAGING TO THEIR
[000:04:47;620] GAME.
[000:04:47;920] THEY HAVE GALVANIZED.
[000:04:48;488] THEY HAVE UNIFIED UNDER THESE
[000:04:49;188] DIVISIVE COMMENTS AND I THINK
[000:04:49;889] WHAT STRUCK THE MOST IS WHEN
[000:04:50;623] THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY SHOULD
[000:04:51;391] BE FIRED.
[000:04:55;928] THE NFL PLAYERS BELIEVE THIS
[000:04:56;696] IS SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT THEY
[000:04:57;463] ARE TRYING TO CHANGE AND NOT
[000:04:58;364] TRYING TO BE DISRESPECTFUL TO
[000:04:59;966] THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE THEM IN
[000:05:00;900] THE MILITARY.
[000:05:01;334] THEY SEND A VERY MIXED MESSAGE
[000:05:18;518] , AND MANY OF THE FANS, 70% OF
[000:05:19;786] THE FANS ARE AGAINST THE
[000:05:20;486] KNEELING.
[000:05:20;853] THEY LOOK AT IT AS VERY
[000:05:21;521] DISRESPECTFUL AND THAT'S WHAT
[000:05:22;255] THE PRESIDENT IS COMMENTING
[000:05:22;955] ON.
[000:05:23;222] THEY SEE THAT SOCIAL JUSTICE
[000:05:23;923] AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
[000:05:24;557] STOP.
[000:05:24;857] THIS HAS BROUGHT THE ENTIRE
[000:05:25;525] NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE
[000:05:26;159] TOGETHER.
[000:05:26;592] >> WE SAW THAT EARLIER TODAY
[000:05:27;293] WHEN A LARGE GROUP OF PATRIOTS
[000:05:28;027] WERE AMONG THE PLAYERS TAKING
[000:05:28;728] A KNEE IN FOXBORO.
[000:05:29;262] SOME PEOPLE WERE YELLING STAND
[000:05:29;996] UP AT THEIR OWN TEAM.
[000:05:31;731] >> BOTH TEAMS WERE ALSO BOOED
[000:05:32;465] IN TENNESSEE.
[000:05:39;505] THE SEAHAWKS AND THE TITANS
[000:05:40;273] DID NOT COME OUT.
[000:05:40;807] THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS DID
[000:05:41;507] NOT COME OUT BECAUSE THEIR
[000:05:42;175] HEAD COACH THAT OUR PLAYERS
[000:05:42;942] SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE.
[000:05:46;112] THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PICK
[000:05:46;879] SIDES SO I'M GOING TO KEEP ALL
[000:05:47;947] OF THEM INSIDE THE LOCKER
[000:05:48;648] ROOM.
[000:05:48;948] THERE WAS ONE PLAYER WHO DID
[000:05:49;682] COME OUT FOR THE NATIONAL
[000:05:53;186] ANTHE ANTHEM.
[000:05:58;291] OF COURSE HE WAS AN ARMY
[000:05:58;958] RANGER AND HAD THREE TOURS IN
[000:05:59;826] AFGHANISTAN SO HE WAS THE LONE
[000:06:00;727] STEELER, BUT MIKE JUST SAID
[000:06:01;527] THIS IS NOT ABOUT FOOTBALL AND
[000:06:02;428] I'M NOT PUTTING MY GUYS IN THE
[000:06:08;067] CENTER OF THIS DIVISIVE
[000:06:08;701] POLITICS.
[000:06:09;135] >> THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST
[000:06:09;869] POWERFUL IMAGE OF THE DAY.
[000:06:11;037] HE'S ONE OF MAYBE ONLY THREE
[000:06:21;881] MEMBERS ARE PLAYERS IN THE NFL
[000:06:22;782] WHO SERVED IN THE MILITARY
[000:06:23;583] PRIOR TO PLAYING FOOTBALL, AND
[000:06:24;317] THERE HE IS, NOT STANDING WITH
[000:06:25;251] HIS TEAM BUT COMING OUT TO
[000:06:26;285] SHOW RESPECT FOR THE FLAG
[000:06:26;986] DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:06:36;796] >> YES, IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL
[000:06:37;597] MOMENT.
[000:06:37;997] >> THE FANS DON'T LIKE THIS AT
[000:06:38;765] ALL.
[000:06:39;031] LOOK, THIS IS ONE OF THE
[000:06:39;699] PLACES WHERE FANS GO TO ESCAPE
[000:06:40;500] ALL THIS, WHERE PEOPLE CAN SIT
[000:06:41;401] DOWN ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOON OR
[000:06:43;169] SATURDAY NIGHT AND WATCH
[000:06:45;371] FOOTBALL GAMES AND REALLY GET
[000:06:46;139] AWAY FROM ALL THIS, AND NOW,
[000:06:47;039] THIS IS FRAYING THE VERY
[000:06:47;807] FABRIC OF THIS WEB THAT WE
[000:06:51;477] HAVE AND THE SOCIETY IS NOW
[000:06:57;417] SHREDDED, BUT ONE OF THE LAST
[000:06:58;418] REFUGE, ONE OF THE LAST PLACES
[000:06:59;318] WE CAN GO.
[000:06:59;685] WE CAN'T TALK POLITICS OR RACE
[000:07:00;586] OR RELIGION AND NOW IT'S GOING
[000:07:01;487] TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE
[000:07:02;588] CAN'T TALK SPORT.
[000:07:03;156] >> THE TRUTH OF IT IS, EVEN
[000:07:03;856] THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTED
[000:07:04;557] THAT THE TEAM OWNER SHOULD
[000:07:05;224] FIRE THE PLAYERS, IN MOST
[000:07:11;831] CASES THEY CAN'T FIRE THEM
[000:07:12;532] BECAUSE OF THE UNION RULES IN
[000:07:13;499] THE CONTRACT THEY SIGNED.
[000:07:15;935] >> FORGET ABOUT THAT, THEY
[000:07:16;602] COULDN'T WITHSTAND THE
[000:07:17;170] BACKLASH IN THE COMMUNITY.
[000:07:18;371] PEOPLE ARE NOT AGAIN SOCIAL
[000:07:19;839] JUSTICE.
[000:07:23;309] SO WHILE IT MAY BE THE WRONG
[000:07:24;310] TIME TO BE SENDING THIS
[000:07:25;144] MESSAGE, THEY ARE USING THE
[000:07:26;479] PLATFORM.
[000:07:26;846] THEY ARE USING A PLACE WHERE
[000:07:27;780] THEY CAN GET THE ATTENTION
[000:07:28;514] THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY AND
[000:07:31;350] WARRANTED, WHERE THEY CAN
[000:07:32;018] BRING ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY
[000:07:35;021] SEE AS WRONGS OF SOCIETY.
[000:07:35;721] A LOT OF THIS HAD DIED DOWN.
[000:07:38;524] A LOT OF IT WAS ON THE BACK
[000:07:40;760] BURNER.
[000:07:43;863] THERE IS A HANDFUL OF GUYS WHO
[000:07:44;964] ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS AND
[000:07:53;339] PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS SPEECH
[000:07:54;073] ALABAMA BROUGHT THIS ISSUE
[000:07:54;740] BACK TO THE FOREFRONT.
[000:07:55;341] HERE HAS BEEN THE RESULT.
[000:07:55;975] WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS UNLIKE ANY
[000:07:56;876] OTHER TIME IN OUR COUNTRY.
[000:08:06;319] WE'VE HAD GUYS GOING FOR
[000:08:07;086] SOCIAL CHANGE.
[000:08:07;520] TOMMY SMITH AND JOHN CARLOS,
[000:08:08;221] THE 1968 OLYMPICS WHEN THEY
[000:08:08;955] ROSE THEIR FISTS UP IN THE AIR
[000:08:09;922] ON THE VICTORY PLATFORM,
[000:08:10;556] MUHAMMAD ALI THROUGHOUT HIS
[000:08:11;224] CAREER IN THE 60s AND 70s
[000:08:12;091] AND 80s, BUT NEVER HAVE WE
[000:08:12;959] EVER SEEN AN ENTIRE LEAGUE
[000:08:16;395] VIRTUALLY IN UNISON SPEAK OUT
[000:08:17;230] IN THE WAY THEY SPOKE TODAY.
[000:08:18;130] >> AND CLEARLY THIS IS NOT
[000:08:18;831] OVER YET.
[000:08:19;198] WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
[000:08:24;170] >> THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING
[000:08:24;837] AFTER A SHOOTING IN A CHURCH
[000:08:32;545] IN TENNESSEE, SOUTHEAST OF
[000:08:33;212] NASHVILLE.
[000:08:33;579] A WOMAN IS DEAD.
[000:08:34;080] AS MANY AS SIX OTHERS ARE
[000:08:34;747] INJURED.
[000:08:35;081] AUTHORITIES SAY A MASKED
[000:08:36;616] GUNMAN OPENED FIRE JUST AFTER
[000:08:40;052] SERVICES LET OUT.
[000:08:43;456] AND USHER AT THE CHURCH TRIED
[000:08:44;357] TO INTERVENE.
[000:08:44;857] >> HE CONFRONTED THE GUY, WAS
[000:08:50;229] PISTOL WHIPPED AND HE WENT
[000:08:50;963] AFTER HIS CAR.
[000:08:51;430] WE SEIZED THE WEAPON, CAME
[000:08:52;098] BACK INSIDE AND THEN THE
[000:08:54;567] GUNMEN SHOT HIMSELF.
[000:08:58;538] >> THE VICTIMS WERE ADULTS,
[000:08:59;205] MANY OVER THE AGE OF 60.
[000:09:00;373] JONATHAN IS REPORTING LIVE
[000:09:05;578] FROM TENNESSEE.
[000:09:06;045] FBI INVESTIGATING WHETHER RACE
[000:09:06;779] MAY HAVE BEEN A MOTIVE.
[000:09:11;751] >> YES, AS FAR AS LOCAL
[000:09:12;451] POLICE, THEY ARE PURSUING
[000:09:13;085] SEVERAL LEADS.
[000:09:13;519] THEY WON'T SPECULATE PUBLICLY
[000:09:16;289] ON ANY MOTIVE.
[000:09:16;722] FEDERAL OFFICIALS HAVE
[000:09:19;825] CONFIRMED THAT THE FBI WILL BE
[000:09:21;060] LAUNCHING A CIVIL RIGHTS
[000:09:23;529] INVESTIGATION WITH THE
[000:09:29;835] SHOOTING.
[000:09:30;202] AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED
[000:09:30;903] THEM AS EMMANUEL SAMPSON.
[000:09:31;571] HE IS A 25-YEAR-OLD
[000:09:32;104] AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE.
[000:09:32;672] HE HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM
[000:09:35;241] HOSPITAL AND WILL BE CHARGED
[000:09:36;943] WITH MURDER AND ATTEMPTED
[000:09:37;610] MURDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE
[000:09:38;377] SHOOTING SPREE.
[000:09:38;844] THE GUNMAN FATALLY SHOT
[000:09:42;014] 39-YEAR-OLD MELANIE SMITH IN
[000:09:44;483] THE CHURCH PARKING LOT AND
[000:09:45;284] WENT INSIDE THE CHURCH
[000:09:45;885] BUILDING, OPENING FIRE,

[000:21:34;309] EARTHQUAKE AND THE MORE
[000:21:34;910] POWERFUL ONE EARLIER THIS
[000:21:35;544] MONTH.
[000:21:43;118] >> HURRICANE MARIA CAUSED
[000:21:43;752] HEAVY DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO
[000:21:44;486] WHERE THE POWER AND PHONE
[000:21:45;120] SERVICE IS STILL OUT FOR MOST
[000:21:46;021] OF THE ISLAND.
[000:21:49;057] NOW A THREAT OF A DAM COLLAPSE
[000:21:50;092] IS FORCING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
[000:21:50;892] FROM THEIR HOME.
[000:21:51;360] GARRETT IS IN SAN JUAN.
[000:21:59;234] >> SOME OF THE BEST NEWS I CAN
[000:22:00;335] REPORT IS THAT COMMUNICATIONS
[000:22:01;069] ARE SLOWLY RETURNING IN SAN
[000:22:02;404] ONE.
[000:22:08;176] AT&T DISPATCHED SOME OF THE
[000:22:09;011] CREWS TO REBUILD AND REPAIR
[000:22:09;745] THE CELL TOWERS HERE IN PUERTO
[000:22:10;846] RICO.
[000:22:11;146] THIS LAST HOUR WE STARTED
[000:22:16;318] GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SIGNAL
[000:22:17;185] ON OUR CELL PHONE WHICH HAD
[000:22:18;153] PREVIOUSLY BEEN NONEXISTENT.
[000:22:23;759] THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE
[000:22:24;693] TOUGHEST, MOST CHALLENGING
[000:22:25;360] PART FOR PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO
[000:22:26;128] AS WELL IS BACK IN THE
[000:22:27;696] STATES.
[000:22:33;435] THAT DISCONNECT, NOT BEING
[000:22:34;102] ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOUR LOVED
[000:22:35;003] ONES AND LET THEM KNOW HOW
[000:22:35;904] YOU'RE DOING.
[000:22:36;338] IN FACT, FOLKS HAVE DRIVEN AS
[000:22:37;072] FAR AS 40 OR 50 MILES TO TRY
[000:22:38;106] TO FIND CELL PHONE SIGNAL TO
[000:22:39;041] BE ABLE TO PLACE A CALL OR
[000:22:40;075] MAKE A TEXT OR JUST SEND THAT
[000:22:41;143] MESSAGE OUT.
[000:22:41;543] ALONG THE HIGHWAY IS ONE OF
[000:22:45;213] THE FEW PLACES THAT HAS
[000:22:45;881] SIGNAL.
[000:22:46;214] YOU CAN SEE LONG LINES OF CARS
[000:22:49;684] STOPPING TO TRY TO CONNECT
[000:22:50;452] WITH THEIR LOVED ONE.
[000:22:52;721] THEY HAVE SLOWLY STARTED TO
[000:22:53;422] COME INTO THE COUNTRY.
[000:22:55;690] FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, AFTER
[000:22:56;658] LOSING THEIR HOME, THE LONG
[000:23:02;097] LINES FOR FUEL, FOOD AND
[000:23:02;864] WATER, ALONG WITH THE PROSPECT
[000:23:03;632] OF GOING MONTHS WITHOUT POWER
[000:23:04;399] IS JUST TOO MUCH AND HUNDREDS
[000:23:06;401] OF THEM ARE NOW TRYING TO FIND
[000:23:08;270] A WAY.
[000:23:15;610] >> IT'S TERRIBLE.
[000:23:16;111] EVERYONE IS FIGHTING FOR
[000:23:16;745] GASOLINE.
[000:23:17;112] MY HUSBAND GOES OUT AT FOUR IN
[000:23:17;879] THE MORNING EVERY DAY TO GET
[000:23:18;580] GASOLINE FOR THE GENERATOR.
[000:23:19;247] GETS BACK AT TWO OR
[000:23:20;015] 3:00 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
[000:23:20;715] WITH TEN DOLLARS AT THE MOST.
[000:23:21;983] WE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE.
[000:23:22;651] WE CAN SURVIVE THAT WE HAVE A
[000:23:24;920] LITTLE GIRL AND IT'S
[000:23:25;887] COMPLICATED.
[000:23:26;288] THIS IS CRAZY.
[000:23:34;563] >> IN WESTERN PUERTO RICO, THE
[000:23:35;297] THREAT OF A COLLAPSING DAM HAS
[000:23:36;131] FORCED 8000 PEOPLE TO
[000:23:36;731] EVACUATE.
[000:23:37;099] OFFICIALS SAY THAT DAM COULD
[000:23:37;899] STILL BREAK AT ANY MOMENT.
[000:23:40;902] AFTER RECEIVING MORE RAIN
[000:23:41;570] TODAY, THE NATIONAL WEATHER
[000:23:44;840] SERVICE EXTENDED A FLASH FLOOD
[000:23:45;674] WARNING UNTIL 815 TONIGHT.
[000:23:55;884] OFFICIALS ACROSS THE TERRITORY
[000:23:56;618] ARE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS
[000:23:57;319] JUST WHAT HOW WIDESPREAD THE
[000:23:58;053] DAMAGES AND HOW BAD IT IS IN
[000:23:59;154] SOME AREAS, PARTICULARLY THOSE
[000:24:00;355] SMALL TOWNS ALONG THE WESTERN
[000:24:01;156] AND SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS
[000:24:01;923] OF THE TERRITORY WHERE THE
[000:24:02;624] STORM REALLY DAMAGED
[000:24:04;659] SEVERELY.
[000:24:07;963] THEY ARE TRYING TO REESTABLISH
[000:24:08;763] COMMUNICATION THERE.
[000:24:09;297] TODAY THE GOVERNOR SAID THE
[000:24:10;465] DEATH TOLL REMAINED AT TEN.
[000:24:13;001] THAT NUMBER COULD STILL RISE
[000:24:16;538] AS THE INDICATIONS ARE
[000:24:18;974] REESTABLISHED.
[000:24:21;443] THIS WEEKEND PUERTO RICO
[000:24:24;713] CONGRESSWOMAN SAID FEMA
[000:24:27;015] ADMINISTRATOR AS WELL AS
[000:24:31;153] FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO

[000:24:32;621] THE ISLAND TOMORROW TO SURVEY
[000:24:34;156] THE DAMAGE FOR THEMSELVES.
[000:24:34;823] PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID HE
[000:24:39;761] PLANS TO VISIT THE ISLAND.
[000:24:40;462] NO DATE OR TIME HAS BEEN
[000:24:41;863] SCHEDULED FOR THAT VISIT.
[000:24:51;072] >> A SHOW SOLIDARITY ACROSS
[000:24:51;773] THE NFL.
[000:24:52;107] PLAYERS AND OWNERS STAND UP
[000:24:52;807] FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
[000:24:53;375] THIS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:24:54;042] CALL FOR PLAYERS AND PROTEST
[000:24:55;243] TO BE FIRED.
[000:25:03;218] WHAT DO THE FANS THINK?
[000:25:03;885] WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM.
[000:25:04;519] AN INFAMOUS FIGURE IN POLITICS
[000:25:05;353] NOW EYEING A POLITICAL COME
[000:25:06;221] BACK AFTER A REMARKABLE FALL
[000:25:06;922] FROM GRACE.
[000:25:07;722] >> HAD I BEEN GIVEN A CIVIL
[000:25:11;193] FINE WITH THEY STILL FEEL I

[000:25:15;764] MARK I HEAR OVERWHELMING
[000:25:16;998] MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY
[000:25:18;500] YES.
[000:25:33;448] Upeace of mind.s
[000:25:34;516] We had a power outage
[000:25:34;516] for five days total.
[000:25:37;219] We lost a lot of food.
[000:25:38;453] We actually filed
[000:25:38;453] a claim with USAA
[000:25:40;222] to replace that spoiled food.
[000:25:41;723] And we really appreciated that
[000:25:43;158] We're the Webber family and
[000:25:44;693] we are USAA members for life.
[000:26:32;607] I AM TOTALLY BLIND.
[000:26:34;142] AND NON-24 CAN THROW MY
[000:26:34;142] DAYS AND NIGHTS OUT OF SYNC,
[000:26:37;946] KEEPING ME FROM THE
[000:26:37;946] THINGS I LOVE TO DO.
[000:26:40;882] TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR,
[000:26:42;617] AND CALL
[000:26:42;617] 844-214-2424.
[000:26:48;156] Endless Shrimp is back
[000:26:49;224] at Red Lobster.
[000:26:50;558] And we went all out
[000:26:51;893] to bring you even more
[000:26:51;893] incredible shrimp
[000:26:53;995] and new flavors.
[000:26:55;497] Like new
[000:26:55;497] Nashville Hot Shrimp,
[000:26:57;432] drizzled with
[000:26:57;432] sweet amber honey,
[000:26:59;401] and new grilled
[000:26:59;401] Mediterranean Shrimp
[000:27:01;303] finished with a savory blend
[000:27:02;871] of green onions,
[000:27:02;871] tomatoes, and herbs.
[000:27:05;140] Feeling hungry yet?
[000:27:06;808] Good, 'cause there's plenty
[000:27:06;808] more where these came from.
[000:27:08;943] Like Garlic Shrimp Scampi,
[000:27:10;679] and other classics you love.
[000:27:12;814] As much as you want,
[000:27:12;814] however you want them.
[000:27:14;683] But hurry, Endless Shrimp
[000:27:14;683] won't be here long.
[000:27:19;154] If you have moderate to severe
[000:27:19;154] plaque psoriasis,...t them.
[000:27:21;456] ...isn't it time to let the real
[000:27:21;456] you shine through?
[000:27:24;926] Maybe it's time for Otezla
[000:27:24;926] (apremilast).
[000:27:27;195] Otezla is not an injection or a
[000:27:27;195] cream.
[000:27:29;998] It's a pill that treats plaque
[000:27:29;998] psoriasis differently.
[000:27:32;834] With Otezla, 75% clearer skin
[000:27:32;834] is achievable after just 4
[000:27:32;834] months,...
[000:27:37;472] ...with reduced redness,...
[000:27:38;473] ...thickness, and scaliness of
[000:27:38;473] plaques.
[000:27:40;342] And the Otezla prescribing
[000:27:40;342] information has...
[000:27:42;744] ...no requirement for routine
[000:27:42;744] lab monitoring.
[000:27:45;013] Don't use if you're allergic to
[000:27:45;013] Otezla.
[000:27:46;681] Otezla may cause severe
[000:27:46;681] diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
[000:27:50;285] Tell your doctor if these occur.
[000:27:51;619] Otezla is associated with an
[000:27:51;619] increased...
[000:27:53;855] ...risk of depression. Tell your
[000:27:53;855] doctor if you have...
[000:27:55;957] ...a history of depression...
[000:27:57;058] ...or suicidal thoughts,...
[000:27:58;259] ...or if these feelings develop.
[000:27:58;259] Some people taking Otezla...
[000:28:00;929] ...reported weight loss.
[000:28:02;163] Your doctor should monitor your
[000:28:02;163] weight and may stop treatment.
[000:28:04;599] Other side effects include
[000:28:04;599] upper...
[000:28:06;000] ...respiratory tract infection
[000:28:06;000] and headache.
[000:28:08;136] Tell your doctor about all the
[000:28:08;136] medicines you take...
[000:28:10;105] ...and if you're pregnant or
[000:28:10;105] planning to be.
[000:28:12;006] Ask your dermatologist
[000:28:12;006] about Otezla today.
[000:28:14;209] Otezla. Show more of you.
[000:28:19;381] This iNot this John Smith.Smith.
[000:28:21;716] Or this John Smith.
[000:28:23;985] Or any of the other hundreds of
[000:28:23;985] John Smiths that are
[000:28:26;054] Humana Medicare Advantage
[000:28:26;054] members.
[000:28:28;757] No, it's this John Smith.
[000:28:31;025] Who we paired with a Humana team
[000:28:31;025] member to help address his
[000:28:33;428] own specific health needs.
[000:28:36;431] At Humana, we take a personal
[000:28:36;431] approach to your health,
[000:28:39;067] to provide care that's just as
[000:28:39;067] unique as you are.
[000:28:42;437] No matter what your name is.
[000:29:05;527] I'M RICK LEVENTHAL.
[000:29:06;094] THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.
[000:29:06;694] PRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVED BACK
[000:29:07;395] AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER A
[000:29:08;029] WEEKEND OF CONTROVERSY.
[000:29:08;663] THE PRESIDENT WENT ON THE
[000:29:09;330] ATTACK AGAINST NFL PLAYERS WHO
[000:29:10;031] REFUSE TO STAND FOR THE
[000:29:10;632] NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:29:11;099] HE CALLED THEM AS OB AND SAID
[000:29:15;003] TEAM OWNER SHOULD FIRE THEM.
[000:29:15;703] THAT IGNITED A WAVE OF PROTEST
[000:29:16;571] ACROSS THE LEAGUE.
[000:29:17;071] MORE THAN 130 PLAYERS AND
[000:29:17;705] COUNTING SITTING, KNEELING OR
[000:29:18;440] RAISING THEIR FIST DURING THE
[000:29:19;174] STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
[000:29:19;741] THE PITTSBURGH PLAYERS STAYED
[000:29:23;645] IN THE LOCKER ROOM WHILE THE
[000:29:24;612] ANTHEM WAS PLAYED.
[000:29:30;051] BRIAN, HOW ARE FANS REACTING
[000:29:30;819] TO TODAY'S PROTEST.
[000:29:36;891] >> WE ARE AT RED'S RESTAURANT
[000:29:37;625] AND BAR WHERE THE JETS BEAT
[000:29:43;731] THE DOLPHINS.
[000:29:44;165] THE PEOPLE HERE LOVE TO WIN.
[000:29:44;933] IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
[000:29:48;203] LOOK, SOME PEOPLE SAY
[000:29:52;507] GENERALLY THEY DO NOT LIKE THE
[000:29:53;441] FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE USING THE
[000:29:54;342] NATIONAL ANTHEM TO PROTEST.
[000:29:55;043] IN FACT MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE
[000:29:56;444] THAT.
[000:30:01;316] WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER OR
[000:30:02;183] NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BOYCOTT
[000:30:03;051] THE SPORT OR HOW FAR THEY'RE
[000:30:03;985] WILLING TO GO TO SUPPORT THAT
[000:30:04;919] OR GO AGAINST IT, THEY ARE NOT
[000:30:05;987] WILLING TO BOYCOTT.
[000:30:06;554] HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THE FOLKS
[000:30:07;422] SAID TO US.
[000:30:09;824] >> I THINK OUR YOUNG MEN AND
[000:30:10;692] WOMEN FOUGHT FOR US TO HAVE
[000:30:11;626] THE RIGHT TO EITHER STAND UP
[000:30:12;560] OR TAKE THAT KNEE.
[000:30:13;828] IT'S JUST WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.
[000:30:24;939] IF IT'S A WAY TO GET THE
[000:30:26;040] MESSAGE ACROSS IN TERMS OF
[000:30:26;808] WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR.
[000:30:27;475] WHY NOT.
[000:30:27;809] YOU JUST HAVE TO SUPPORT THEM
[000:30:28;543] NO MATTER WHAT.
[000:30:29;110] >> CAN WE JUST HAVE OUR
[000:30:29;711] SUNDAYS WITH FOOTBALL.
[000:30:30;678] LOOK.
[000:30:31;713] I'M TRYING TO ENJOY SUNDAY
[000:30:32;480] WITH MY WIFE.
[000:30:34;015] WERE TALKING ABOUT POLITICS
[000:30:35;350] NOW.
[000:30:35;617] IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.
[000:30:52;667] >> LISTEN, I'M A VETERAN.
[000:30:53;301] THOSE GUYS ARE GETTING PAID
[000:30:54;002] MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND I
[000:30:54;002] USED
[000:30:54;903] TO GET A PAYCHECK OF $750 IN
[000:30:55;870] THE MILITARY.
[000:30:56;304] IF YOU CAN'T STAND FOR THE
[000:30:56;938] NATIONAL ANTHEM, THEN GET OFF
[000:30:57;639] THE FIELD.
[000:30:58;072] >> I THINK IT TURNED THE WHOLE
[000:30:58;806] THING FROM AWFUL.
[000:30:59;874] IT WAS A GREAT MOVE ON
[000:31:00;642] PRESIDENT TRUMP TO DO IT.
[000:31:07;916] >> THAT WAS JUST SOME OF THE
[000:31:08;883] OPINIONS WE GOT HERE TODAY.
[000:31:09;584] MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST TELLING
[000:31:19;961] US THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE
[000:31:21;095] FACT THAT POLITICS ARE GETTING
[000:31:21;863] INVOLVED WITH THEIR NFL
[000:31:22;463] SUNDAY.
[000:31:22;797] IN FACT, A LOT OF
[000:31:23;298] CONVERSATIONS WERE
[000:31:23;831] UNCOMFORTABLE.
[000:31:24;265] PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO
[000:31:24;999] TALK ABOUT IT.
[000:31:25;433] IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET PEOPLE
[000:31:26;367] WHO WANTED TO SPEAK BECAUSE
[000:31:27;135] IT'S NOT A GOOD MIX FOR THESE
[000:31:28;069] FOLKS.
[000:31:28;369] THEY JUST WANT TO SEE THE
[000:31:29;804] GAME.
[000:31:34;275] >> SOME FANS SAY THEY ARE
[000:31:35;043] GOING TO STOP WATCHING BECAUSE
[000:31:35;810] OF HIS PROTEST?
[000:31:36;344] >> WE SPOKE TO A COUPLE FANS
[000:31:37;078] WHO SAY THEY KNOW OF PEOPLE
[000:31:39;581] WHO WILL STOP WATCHING BECAUSE
[000:31:40;381] OF THIS.
[000:31:40;715] OR WHO HAVE STOPPED WATCHING.
[000:31:42;016] IN FACT THERE WAS A SURVEY
[000:31:43;785] DONE FROM JD POWER IN JULY AND
[000:31:46;120] IT SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER ONE
[000:31:48;656] REASON THAT PEOPLE STOPPED
[000:31:49;324] WATCHING FOOTBALL RECENTLY IS
[000:31:53;695] BECAUSE OF THESE NATIONAL
[000:31:54;362] ANTHEM PROTEST.
[000:31:55;463] BEHIND THAT WERE THE
[000:32:07;241] COMMERCIALS ARE GAME DELAYS
[000:32:07;942] AND EVEN THE PRESIDENTIAL
[000:32:08;610] ELECTION.
[000:32:08;977] BUT THAT'S AN INTERESTING POLL
[000:32:09;744] BECAUSE IT DOES SHOW WITH THE
[000:32:10;511] PRESIDENT WAS SAYING IN TERMS
[000:32:11;245] OF FANS NOT NECESSARILY LIKING
[000:32:11;980] THE WAY THE GAME IS OR NOT
[000:32:12;814] LIKING THE ANTHEM, I GUESS
[000:32:13;581] THAT WOULD SORT OF SUPPORT
[000:32:14;315] THAT.
[000:32:14;616] IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF FANS
[000:32:15;516] WE SPOKE TO TODAY THAT WERE
[000:32:16;417] WILLING TO BOYCOTT, WE DID NOT
[000:32:17;352] FIND THAT TODAY.
[000:32:17;852] WE WILL SEE HOW THEY FEEL.
[000:32:20;254] THIS IS THE FIRST WEEK IN
[000:32:21;155] WHICH WE'VE SEEN THIS AT THIS
[000:32:24;826] LEVEL IN TERMS OF PRESIDENT
[000:32:28;563] TRUMP GETTING INVOLVED.
[000:32:29;163] I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW
[000:32:29;864] WILL THIS AFFECT THE SPORT.
[000:32:42;377] >> YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE NAME
[000:32:43;111] AND YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THAT
[000:32:43;878] INTERVIEW THAT ONE OFF THE
[000:32:44;545] RAIL.
[000:32:45;713] MICHAEL GRAHAM WENT TO THE BIG
[000:32:46;681] HOUSE BUT NOW HE'S BACK AND HE
[000:32:49;617] TALKS TO US ABOUT HIS PLANS
[000:32:50;518] FOR THE FUTURE.
[000:32:52;920] MICHAEL GRAHAM WAS THE RIGHT
[000:32:54;622] RISING STAR IN THE REPUBLICAN
[000:33:02;330] PARTY.
[000:33:02;630] HE WAS THE ONLY ELECTED
[000:33:03;231] REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS
[000:33:03;831] REPRESENTING NEW YORK CITY
[000:33:08;536] FROM 2011 UNTIL 2015.
[000:33:09;103] A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO A
[000:33:09;837] RESTAURANT HE ONCE OWNED LED
[000:33:13;307] THE CHARGES OF FRAUD AND TAX
[000:33:14;242] EVASION AND THEN THIS
[000:33:15;543] HAPPENS.
[000:33:19;414] >> OF PEOPLE SAID WHAT ARE
[000:33:20;114] YOUR BIGGEST REGRETS, IT'S NOT
[000:33:29;824] HAVING CHILDREN IS PROBABLY
[000:33:30;525] NUMBER ONE BUT WITHIN THE TOP
[000:33:31;325] THREE IS THAT INTERVIEW.
[000:33:32;060] >> THE REPORTER AND LOCAL
[000:33:32;694] NETWORK HAD AGREED TO STAY ON
[000:33:33;461] TOPIC BUT DIDN'T.
[000:33:33;961] HE LOST HIS COOL AND THEN WENT
[000:33:36;197] HOME.
[000:33:36;564] >> I WALK IN AND I SAID MOM, I
[000:33:37;298] KNOW.
[000:33:37;598] DON'T SAY IT.
[000:33:38;533] SHE SAID NO, YOU DON'T KNOW.
[000:33:39;367] YOU KNOW WE LOOK LIKE?
[000:33:41;803] I SAID NO, WHO DO I LOOK
[000:33:44;038] LIKE.
[000:33:48;176] SHE SAID YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR
[000:33:48;910] FATHER.
[000:33:49;243] I SAID WHY MY FATHER SON.
[000:33:50;678] SHE SAID BUT YOUR FATHER COULD
[000:33:56;918] GET A WE AWAY WITH IT.
[000:33:57;719] YOUR CONGRESSMAN, YOU CAN'T.
[000:33:58;419] IT HIT ME LIKE A TON OF
[000:33:59;220] BRICKS.
[000:34:00;288] >> HE PLED GUILTY TO A SINGLE
[000:34:01;189] COUNT OF TAX FRAUD FOR PAYING
[000:34:07;061] ILLEGAL WORKERS OFF THE
[000:34:07;695] BOOKS.
[000:34:07;995] HE RESIGNED FROM CONGRESS AND
[000:34:08;730] SERVED SEVEN MONTHS IN PRISON.
[000:34:17;939] >> WHAT WAS THAT LIKE FOR
[000:34:18;606] YOU.
[000:34:18;940] >> HORRIBLE.
[000:34:19;340] ONE OF THE WORST EXPENSES OF
[000:34:20;074] MY LIFE.
[000:34:20;408] I WOULDN'T WISH IT ON MY
[000:34:21;109] ENEMY.
[000:34:21;409] HE SAID HIS CASE WAS POLITICAL
[000:34:22;143] HE MOTIVATED AND HIS CRIME
[000:34:22;777] DESERVE NO TIME.
[000:34:23;311] >> IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF
[000:34:24;011] NEW YORK CITY, THERE HAVE BEEN
[000:34:24;779] TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CIVIL
[000:34:25;546] FINES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
[000:34:29;016] LABOR TO RESTAURANT OWNERS FOR
[000:34:31;385] THIS EXACT SAME CONDUCT.
[000:34:32;019] I'M THE FIRST TO BE CRIMINALLY
[000:34:33;554] CHARGED.
[000:34:33;888] MICHAEL GRAHAM SAYS HE IS
[000:34:34;655] READY TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE
[000:34:35;923] AGAIN.
[000:34:37;158] >> SHOULD I RUN?
[000:34:39;694] >> IF YOU DO, YOU'VE GOT MY
[000:34:41;262] VOTE.
[000:34:42;797] >> I APPRECIATE THAT.
[000:34:43;364] I DON'T RUN UNLESS I KNOW I
[000:34:44;966] CAN WIN.
[000:34:46;300] WHEN I GO OUT AND I SHAKE
[000:34:47;335] THESE HANDS AND PEOPLE HUG ME
[000:34:48;269] AND THEY TELL ME YOU HAVE NO
[000:34:51;339] IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
[000:34:52;173] BEHIND YOU, I JUST KNOW IT.
[000:34:52;907] I FEEL IN MY HEART.
[000:34:54;509] RICK: JOINING ME NOW, MICHAEL
[000:34:57;011] GRAHAM.
[000:34:57;345] THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
[000:34:59;781] LET'S GET IT OUT OF THE WAY,
[000:35:00;848] MAKE IT FO OFFICIAL.
[000:35:07;121] ARE YOU RUNNING FOR CONGRESS.
[000:35:07;889] >> I THINK IT'S A DECISION
[000:35:08;556] THAT THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
[000:35:09;257] DECIDE.
[000:35:09;590] I HAVE A BIG RALLY COMING UP
[000:35:10;324] SUNDAY OCTOBER 1 AND IF THE
[000:35:11;192] PEOPLE REALLY WANT ME TO RUN
[000:35:12;093] THEN YES I'M GOING TO RUN.
[000:35:14;829] >> BASED ON THE PEOPLE WHO WE
[000:35:15;830] SAW IN THE DINER THAT DAY,
[000:35:16;597] THEY WANT YOU TO RUN.
[000:35:17;298] >> PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE I'VE
[000:35:18;699] BEEN, WHAT I'M GETTING
[000:35:22;003] CONSISTENC CONSISTENTLY IS
[000:35:24;705] WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU,
[000:35:25;406] WE'VE MISSED YOU.
[000:35:27;608] THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN I WAS
[000:35:28;543] THE CONGRESSMAN, WHEN I WAS
[000:35:29;343] REPRESENTING THESE PEOPLE, I
[000:35:32;480] GAVE MY HEART MY SOUL.
[000:35:33;114] I WAS EVERYWHERE.
[000:35:33;614] I WAS WITH THEM.
[000:35:34;115] THERE WERE DAYS WHERE
[000:35:35;950] LITERALLY I WOULD SHOW UP AT
[000:35:36;851] SOMEONE'S HOUSE BECAUSE I KNOW
[000:35:38;553] THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH REALLY
[000:35:39;387] DIFFICULT TIMES.
[000:35:39;854] I WOULD HUG THEM AND THERE WAS
[000:35:42;890] A TIME WHERE WE ACTUALLY CRIED
[000:35:44;492] TOGETHER.
[000:35:47;795] I REALLY KNEW MY
[000:35:48;329] CONSTITUENTS.
[000:35:48;763] THEY GOT TO KNOW ME AND IT WAS
[000:35:49;630] VERY PERSONAL.
[000:35:50;131] >> YOU HAVE A COUPLE HURDLES
[000:35:51;265] HERE.
[000:35:51;833] I KNOW YOU WANT TO FOCUS NOT
[000:35:53;901] TO BE ON THAT ONE INTERVIEW OR
[000:35:57;638] THAT ONE REPORT, OR THE TIME
[000:35:58;539] THAT YOU SPENT IN A FEDERAL
[000:36:02;476] LOCKUP.
[000:36:02;810] YOU WANTED TO BE ON YOUR
[000:36:03;511] NEARLY 20 YEARS OF PUBLIC
[000:36:04;212] SERVICE.
[000:36:07;348] >> YOUR TIME IN THE GULF WAR,
[000:36:08;115] YOUR TIME IS AN UNDER
[000:36:12;086] UNDERCOVER AGENT.
[000:36:12;753] >> FIRST OF ALL YES.
[000:36:15;690] DO I HAVE THREE DELIVERY BOYS
[000:36:27;501] AND A KITCHEN WORKER OFF THE
[000:36:28;469] BOOKS FOR A COUPLE YEARS,
[000:36:29;136] MYSELF AND TWO OTHER PARTNERS,
[000:36:29;971] YES I DID AND I OWN THAT.
[000:36:30;905] I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT
[000:36:31;873] OR HIDING.
[000:36:32;240] THAT'S A CIVIL MATTER.
[000:36:32;807] AT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.
[000:36:33;507] EVERYONE BUT ME.
[000:36:33;975] I FOUND OUT 14 MONTHS BEFORE
[000:36:36;811] THE INDICTMENT THAT A DEAL WAS
[000:36:38;112] MADE WITH LORETTA LYNCH.
[000:36:38;746] I KNEW SHE WAS CORRUPT.
[000:36:55;263] I WAS TOLD IF SHE TOOK ME DOWN
[000:36:56;497] SHE WOULD BE THE NEXT ATTORNEY
[000:36:57;431] GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES
[000:36:58;132] FOR TWO MONTHS AFTER WHAT I
[000:36:59;133] WOULD CALL A SHAM INDICTMENT,
[000:36:59;867] SHE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
[000:37:00;668] OF THE UNITED STATES.
[000:37:01;302] >> YOU'RE SAYING SHE TARGETED
[000:37:02;036] YOU TO ADVANCE HER OWN
[000:37:02;603] CAREER.
[000:37:03;004] >> THERE IS NO QUESTION.
[000:37:03;704] >> WILDS WHAT I WOULD BE THE
[000:37:04;405] FIRST AND ONLY PERSON IN THE
[000:37:05;139] HISTORY OF NEW YORK CITY TO
[000:37:05;873] NOT GET A CIVIL FINE.
[000:37:06;540] >> YOU MADE THAT POINT IN THE
[000:37:07;408] CASE THAT SOME PEOPLE DO
[000:37:08;109] THIS.
[000:37:09;143] YOUR POINT WAS THAT YOU
[000:37:14;682] WEREN'T TAKING MONEY AND PUT
[000:37:15;449] IT IN YOUR POCKET.
[000:37:15;983] YOU ARE TAKING MONEY TO PAY
[000:37:16;817] THE PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T PAY ON
[000:37:17;818] THE BOOKS.
[000:37:18;252] >> AND I NEVER TOOK THE RIGHT
[000:37:18;953] AFTER THE REALITY IS, ANY
[000:37:19;687] ACCOUNT WOULD TELL YOU, I
[000:37:20;488] WASN'T DOING IT TO MAKE MONEY,
[000:37:21;389] YOU CAN'T GET IT DISHWASHER
[000:37:22;790] UNDER THE BOOKS.
[000:37:23;291] SO MOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A
[000:37:24;058] KIT ON THE BICYCLE TO
[000:37:25;393] DELIVER.
[000:37:35;870] IT'S NOT RIGHT.
[000:37:36;337] I WAS WRONG PRODUCTION OF DONE
[000:37:37;104] IT.
[000:37:37;371] I SHOULD'VE HAD THE COURAGE TO
[000:37:38;139] FAIL, CLOSE THE RESTAURANT AND
[000:37:38;873] POSSIBLY EVEN LOSE MY HOUSE.
[000:37:39;607] THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE
[000:37:40;308] AND I REGRET THAT FOR THE REST
[000:37:41;409] OF MY LIFE.
[000:37:41;876] >> I KNOW YOU BELIEVE YOUR
[000:37:42;543] FOREIGN-POLICY EXPENSE CAN
[000:37:43;177] HELP ON CAPITOL HILL,
[000:37:46;447] INCLUDING YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH
[000:37:49;684] NORTH KOREA.
[000:37:50;084] TELL ME ABOUT IT.
[000:37:50;651] >> THERE'S NO QUESTION.
[000:37:51;252] I THINK MY FOREIGN-POLICY
[000:37:51;919] EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO MY
[000:37:52;520] LOYALTY.
[000:37:52;853] I'M A MARINE THROUGH AND
[000:37:53;487] THROUGH.
[000:37:54;922] I ALMOST GOT KILLED IN THE
[000:37:55;890] GULF WAR.
[000:37:57;058] MY HUMMER HIT A TANK AND BY
[000:38:04;832] THE GRACE OF GOD I SURVIVED.
[000:38:05;633] AND THEN I WALKED THAT VERY
[000:38:06;567] NIGHT DOWN THAT MINEFIELD TO
[000:38:07;368] BRING PRISONERS BACK TO
[000:38:08;502] SAFETY.
[000:38:11;372] SO, I HAVE A SPINE.
[000:38:12;039] THERE'S A LOT OF MEMBERS OF
[000:38:12;974] CONGRESS WITH A VERY WEAK
[000:38:13;741] SPINE THAT HAVE TURNED THEIR
[000:38:14;508] BACK ON OUR PRESIDENT AND HAS
[000:38:21;582] UNDERMINED THE AGENDA THAT
[000:38:22;249] EVERYONE VOTED FOR.
[000:38:22;783] FIRST AND FOREMOST, I WOULD BE
[000:38:23;517] THERE TO HAVE OUR PRESIDENT'S
[000:38:24;285] BACKPACK THAT'S NUMBER ONE.
[000:38:24;986] NUMBER TWO, YES, WE HAVE A
[000:38:25;686] VERY PRECARIOUS, VERY
[000:38:26;354] DIFFICULT SITUATION WITH NORTH
[000:38:27;088] KOREA AND IT'S GETTING WORSE.
[000:38:33;094] WE HAD THE CLINTON
[000:38:33;761] ADMINISTRATION THAT TRIED TO
[000:38:34;462] BRIBE THEM.
[000:38:34;862] THAT DIDN'T WORK.
[000:38:35;363] FAST-FORWARD AND YOU HAVE
[000:38:35;997] EIGHT YEARS OF AN APPEASEMENT
[000:38:36;731] POLICY BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.
[000:38:37;398] NOW WHAT WE HAVE?
[000:38:37;932] NOW HAVE A LUNATIC WITH THE
[000:38:41;969] CAPABILITY, VERY SOON, ICBMS
[000:38:44;205] WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT CAN
[000:38:51;212] POSSIBLY STRIKE NOT ONLY THE
[000:38:52;046] UNITED STATES BUT OUR ALLIES.
[000:38:52;747] I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS
[000:38:53;447] TAKEN SUCH A HARSH STANCE, BUT
[000:38:56;384] THAT'S BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE
[000:38:57;351] NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO
[000:38:58;986] NORTH KOREA, AND MAYBE HE'S
[000:39:04;825] NOT MENTALLY STABLE TO HEAR
[000:39:05;593] IT, BUT ALLIES NEED TO KNOW
[000:39:06;527] THAT OUR RESOLVING COMMITMENT
[000:39:07;228] IS UNWAVERING.
[000:39:07;661] THAT MEANS JAPAN, WE REALLY
[000:39:08;529] HAVE TO MAKE SURE ARE UNDE
[000:39:19;640] ALLIES UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE
[000:39:20;374] HERE FOR THEM.
[000:39:20;808] THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
[000:39:21;442] SITUATION.
[000:39:21;876] >> NOT TO SWITCH TOPICS BUT
[000:39:22;576] THE PRESIDENT ALSO TOOK A
[000:39:23;244] HARSH STANCE AGAINST NFL
[000:39:23;878] PLAYERS.
[000:39:24;211] AS A VETERAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL
[000:39:24;945] ABOUT PLAYERS KNEELING DURING
[000:39:34;388] THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
[000:39:35;022] >> I THINK THERE ARE TWO
[000:39:35;623] ISSUES.
[000:39:35;956] NUMBER ONE, AS SOMEONE WHO
[000:39:36;624] WATCHES THE FOOTBALL GAMES,
[000:39:37;324] THIS IS MY ESCAPE.
[000:39:37;858] I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT
[000:39:38;559] POLITICS.
[000:39:38;926] I WANT TO WATCH A GAME AND GET
[000:39:39;693] AWAY FROM THAT.
[000:39:40;161] THAT'S THE FIRST THING.
[000:39:40;761] THE SECOND THING, NOT ONLY AS
[000:39:41;896] A VETERAN BUT AS SOMEONE WHO
[000:39:46;467] HAS SHARED THE BLOOD SWEAT AND
[000:39:47;435] TEARS WITH THOSE THAT HAVE
[000:39:48;102] GIVEN THEIR LIVES AND THEIR
[000:39:48;969] LIMBS, ABOUT THE FAMILIES OF
[000:39:50;704] SOMEONE WHO LOST A SON OR
[000:39:51;605] DAUGHTER OR LOVED ONE IN
[000:39:52;373] COMBAT AND THEY HAVE TO SEE,
[000:40:01;916] PEOPLE WHO WE SHOULD BE
[000:40:02;683] LOOKING UP TO, SPORTS FIGURES,
[000:40:03;484] PEOPLE THAT OUR CHILDREN LOOK
[000:40:04;218] UP TO, THEY MAKE MILLIONS OF
[000:40:05;152] DOLLARS IN A VERY TALENTED.
[000:40:05;853] TO TURN YOUR BACK ON THE
[000:40:06;720] NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND OUR FLAG,
[000:40:07;421] IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT I
[000:40:09;323] THINK STRIKES AT THE HEART OF
[000:40:11;425] WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS.
[000:40:12;026] AS A VETERAN, IT'S OFFENSIVE.
[000:40:15;996] >> MICHAEL GRAHAM, TELL US,
[000:40:20;101] YOU'RE RUNNING.
[000:40:20;568] JUST TELL US LIVE ON TV.
[000:40:23;237] >> I WILL SAY THIS.
[000:40:24;839] THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN
[000:40:27;508] OVERWHELMING, I'M ENERGIZED,
[000:40:29;777] I'M VERY EXCITED, EVERYONE
[000:40:30;478] I'VE SPOKEN TO IS EXTREMELY
[000:40:33;848] ENTHUSIASTIC AND I THINK THAT
[000:40:36;083] ON SUNDAY, IF WE HAVE A HUGE
[000:40:37;985] TURNOUT YOU WILL GET THE
[000:40:38;786] ANSWER YOU WANT.
[000:40:40;154] >> THAT'S WHEN IT'S OFFICIAL.

[000:42:46;447] I NEEDED SOMETHING MORE TO HELP
[000:42:46;447] CONTROL MY TYPE 2 DIABETES.
[000:42:50;217] MY A1C WASN'T WERE
[000:42:50;217] IT NEEDED TO BE.

[000:42:58;492] BY ACTIVATING WHAT'S WITHIN ME
[000:43:00;394] WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.
[000:43:03;163] TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.
[000:43:04;632] IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO
[000:43:04;632] DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSE TO DO,
[000:43:07;001] RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.
[000:43:08;769] I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
[000:43:08;769] AND IT WORKS 24/7.
[000:43:12;172] IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN
[000:43:14;074] AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
[000:43:14;074] A LITTLE WEIGHT.
[000:43:16;610] TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY

[000:43:22;616] WHEN USED WITH
[000:43:22;616] DIET AND EXERCISE.
[000:43:24;752] TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.
[000:43:26;854] IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST
[000:43:26;854] MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,
[000:43:29;490] OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
[000:43:29;490] TYPE 1 DIABETES
[000:43:31;425] OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.
[000:43:33;861] DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY

[000:43:50;077] RASH, OR TROUBLE BREATHING.
[000:43:53;547] SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY
[000:43:53;547] INCLUDE PANCREATITIS,
[000:43:56;283] WHICH CAN BE FATAL.
[000:43:58;218] TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
[000:43:58;218] SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN,
[000:44:00;888] INCREASES YOUR RISK
[000:44:00;888] FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

[000:44:03;624] NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,
[000:44:06;660] DECREASED APPETITE
[000:44:06;660] AND INDIGESTION.
[000:44:09;096] SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
[000:44:09;096] LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,
[000:44:11;398] WHICH MAY MAKE EXISTING

[000:44:14;168] ME REACH MY BLOOD SUGAR GOALS.
[000:44:18;405] WITH TRULICITY, I CLICK TO

[000:44:21;075] IF YOU WANT HELP IMPROVING
[000:44:21;075] YOUR A1C AND BLOOD SUGAR,
[000:44:24;178] ACTIVATE YOUR WITHIN.
[000:44:25;879] ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
[000:44:25;879] ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.
[000:44:51;004] >> WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND
[000:44:54;975] WHEN THIS TAPE CAME OUT?
[000:44:59;113] >> WHEN I DO THAT WAS COMING
[000:45:00;013] OUT, ALL THE LAWYERS SAID IF
[000:45:06;153] YOU WANT TO STOP, STOP.
[000:45:06;754] YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FORWARD.
[000:45:07;588] THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY
[000:45:08;489] BEING OFFERED.
[000:45:08;922] THIS WILL NEVER SEE THE LIGHT
[000:45:09;623] OF DAY.
[000:45:09;957] I SAID I CAN'T DO THAT.
[000:45:10;657] >> OF THIS TAPE WASN'T LEAKED,
[000:45:11;892] SUPPOSE THERE IS NO.
[000:45:16;864] [INAUDIBLE]
[000:45:25;105] >> THAT'S A PREVIEW OF
[000:45:25;706] TONIGHT'S EPISODE OF OBJECTIVE
[000:45:26;440] FIGHT.
[000:45:26;740] HARVEY LEVIN SITTING DOWN WITH
[000:45:27;474] HULK HOGAN FOR THAT WIDE
[000:45:28;575] RAISING INTERVIEW.
[000:45:31;378] HIS USE OF A RACIAL SLUR, AND
[000:45:32;413] ALSO THE LOW POINT IN HIS LIFE
[000:45:33;514] WHEN HE CONSIDERED SUICIDE.
[000:45:34;848] JOINING ME NOW TO TALK MORE
[000:45:35;749] ABOUT IT IS THE EXECUTIVE
[000:45:37;618] PRODUCER.
[000:45:37;985] THANKS FOR BEING WITH US
[000:45:38;619] EVERY.
[000:45:38;986] >> AS SOMEONE WHO COVERS
[000:45:46;493] CELEBRITIES AND PROFESSIONAL
[000:45:47;194] ATHLETES, I HAVE TO ASK YOU
[000:45:47;895] FIRST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN
[000:45:48;762] THE NFL.
[000:45:49;096] YOUR REACTION TO THE PROTEST.
[000:45:50;497] >> LOOK.
[000:45:51;999] I AM REALLY UPSET WITH WHAT
[000:45:55;068] THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE HERE.
[000:45:57;137] I THINK IT'S REALLY WRONG FOR
[000:45:59;306] SOMEONE IN HIS POSITION TO GET
[000:46:02;476] PERSONAL LIKE THAT AND TO CALL
[000:46:05;779] THEM SOP.
[000:46:06;146] WHAT HE HAS DONE IS HE HAS NOW
[000:46:09;149] MADE THIS PARTISAN, POLITICAL,
[000:46:18;725] AND THERE ARE PROBABLY PEOPLE
[000:46:19;460] WHO WOULD'VE NEVER TAKEN ANY
[000:46:20;260] WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE A KNEE.
[000:46:21;195] NOW IT DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO DO
[000:46:23;330] WITH BLACK LIVES MATTER, IT
[000:46:24;064] HAS TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP.
[000:46:24;898] IN A WAY DIDN'T DO HIMSELF A
[000:46:30;571] FAVOR.
[000:46:30;871] I'M PRETTY UPSET BY IT.
[000:46:31;572] >> YOU SAT DOWN WITH HIM.
[000:46:32;239] YOUR FIRST SHOW WAS ABOUT THE
[000:46:32;940] PRESIDENT.
[000:46:33;307] WERE YOU SURPRISED?
[000:46:34;775] OR DOES THIS FIT INTO THE
[000:46:35;676] PRESIDENT THAT YOU KNOW?
[000:46:40;914] >> THERE IS A BIGGER
[000:46:41;482] DISCUSSION HERE, BUT I'M NOT
[000:46:42;216] SURE I KNOW THE MAN THAT I'M
[000:46:47;054] SEEING NOW BECAUSE IT'S
[000:46:47;654] DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSON I
[000:46:48;455] KNEW BEFORE.
[000:46:48;922] >> TELL US ABOUT THE SHOW,
[000:46:53;794] THERE'S A PRETTY UNIQUE
[000:46:54;428] CONCEPT BEHIND IT.
[000:46:55;028] >> THE IDEA RICK, IS THAT WE
[000:46:56;396] TAKE OBJECTS THAT PEOPLE
[000:46:57;030] CHOOSE TO KEEP OVER A
[000:46:59;600] LIFETIME, FROM CHILDHOOD ON,
[000:47:00;300] AND WE USE THOSE OBJECTS AS
[000:47:03;871] KIND OF A JUMPING OFF POINT.
[000:47:13;447] THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO CHOOSE
[000:47:14;414] THE OBJECT.
[000:47:14;815] THEY ARE INVESTED IN IT AND
[000:47:15;516] THEY HAVE CONTROL AT THE
[000:47:16;183] BEGINNING.
[000:47:16;550] I THINK IT OPENS THEM UP MORE
[000:47:18;018] THAN IF YOU ARE JUST SITTING
[000:47:18;986] ON A SOFA TALKING TO THEM.
[000:47:19;786] WE'VE DONE THIS NOW WITH A
[000:47:20;687] BUNCH OF PEOPLE, FROM BUSINESS
[000:47:26;326] AND SPORTS PEOPLE AND WORLD
[000:47:27;027] LEADERS.
[000:47:27;361] IT JUST OPENS PEOPLE UP AND
[000:47:33;467] THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS MORE
[000:47:34;234] CANDIDLY THAN THEY GENERALLY
[000:47:34;935] DO.
[000:47:35;269] >> THE STUFF THAT THEY HAVE
[000:47:38;338] SAVED, THEY TALK ABOUT THAT
[000:47:43;477] AND RELATE TO THAT AND THAT
[000:47:44;478] LEADS THEM INTO MORE PERSONAL
[000:47:45;212] STUFF.
[000:47:45;579] >> YES, AND I WILL SAY, THIS
[000:47:46;380] IS NOT JUST EXPENSIVE STUFF
[000:47:47;114] THAT THEY KEEP.
[000:47:49;416] THERE IS ONE ITEM, IT'S IRAQ.
[000:47:55;355] IT HAS REAL MEANING TO HIM.
[000:48:00;260] WAS PASSED ON TO HIS SON AND
[000:48:01;395] BACK TO HIM AND THERE IS
[000:48:02;296] MEANING IN THINGS.
[000:48:08;035] TYLER HAS A PAIR OF WALMART
[000:48:16;643] PAJAMAS THAT REALLY MEAN
[000:48:17;311] SOMETHING TO HIM.
[000:48:17;811] THIS IS A VERY RICH MAN.
[000:48:18;478] THESE PAJAMAS MEAN SOMETHING
[000:48:19;179] TO HIM.
[000:48:19;580] IT'S NOT JUST THE EXPENSIVE
[000:48:21;915] STUFF.
[000:48:22;883] >> WHAT IS HIS THING THAT HE
[000:48:25;319] IDENTIFIES WITH THE MOST.
[000:48:27;087] CAN YOU TELL US?
[000:48:30;057] >> I WANT TO SAY WHIP CREAM,
[000:48:32;359] BUT THERE'S A STORY BEHIND
[000:48:34;127] THAT.
[000:48:37;598] I WILL SAY THIS, THE THING
[000:48:39;399] ABOUT MARK, WHO IS JUST A
[000:48:41;635] FANTASTIC GUY, MARK, I TALKED
[000:48:45;472] TO HIM ABOUT POLITICS AND
[000:48:47;074] ABOUT RUNNING AND I CALLED BS
[000:48:49;876] ON HIM BECAUSE I DIDN'T
[000:48:50;677] BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SAYING,
[000:48:53;180] AND HE OPENED UP SOME.
[000:48:53;780] I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF
[000:48:58;018] MARK MAKES A RUN FOR
[000:48:58;619] PRESIDENT.
[000:48:59;052] >> ON THE GUIDE BE SURPRISED
[000:48:59;753] EITHER.
[000:49:00;087] THAT WOULD BE SOME SHOWDOWN.
[000:49:03;657] >> HE TALKS ABOUT IT AND HE
[000:49:04;524] GETS VERY SPECIFIC.
[000:49:08;695] I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
[000:49:09;329] SURPRISED.
[000:49:09;763] >> IF SOMEONE WAS DOING IN A
[000:49:12;733] AND OBJECTIFY ABOUT YOU, WHAT
[000:49:13;467] WOULD BE THAT ONE OBJECT YOU
[000:49:14;534] WOULD TALK ABOUT.
[000:49:20;240] >> HE PROBABLY INNOCENTLY
[000:49:20;907] WALKED INTO SOMETHING THAT IS
[000:49:21;642] SO SUPER EMBARRASSING FOR ME,
[000:49:22;342] BUT I WILL TELL YOU RICK.
[000:49:23;010] WHEN I PITCHED THE SHOW, WHEN
[000:49:29;149] I WAS TRYING TO SELL IT, I
[000:49:30;217] THOUGHT I HAVE TO HAVE AN
[000:49:31;151] OBJECT THAT I CAN BRING IN SO
[000:49:32;252] I CAN EXPLAIN IT.
[000:49:32;786] WHEN IN TO MY OFFICE IN MY
[000:49:36;089] HOME AND THERE WAS A GLOBE
[000:49:36;990] THAT I KEPT SINCE I WAS SIX
[000:49:38;091] YEARS OLD.
[000:49:38;458] IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.
[000:49:40;794] SO I PULLED THE GLOBE OFF THE
[000:49:41;828] SHELF AND I TOOK IT INTO THE
[000:49:44;197] ROOM AND AS I WAS TRYING TO
[000:49:45;298] FILM THE SHOW, I LOOK AT THE
[000:49:49;069] GLOBE.
[000:49:49;403] THE UNITED STATES ONLY HAD 48
[000:49:54;808] STATES.
[000:49:55;208] >> WOW.
[000:49:55;542] YOU REALLY DATING YOURSELF.
[000:49:58;745] >> WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME
[000:49:59;446] TONIGHT.
[000:49:59;780] GOOD LUCK WITH THE SHOW.
[000:50:00;547] BE SURE TO WATCH OBJECTIVE
[000:50:05;218] FIGHT.
[000:50:05;519] IT AIRS TONIGHT RIGHT AFTER
[000:50:06;186] FOX REPORT AT 8:00 P.M.
[000:50:07;254] EASTERN.
[000:50:13;493] A REPUBLICAN RUNOFF FOR AN
[000:50:14;327] ALABAMA SENATE SEAT IS
[000:50:14;961] CAPTURING THE NATION'S
[000:50:15;562] ATTENTION.
[000:50:15;929] THE INCUMBENT CANDIDATE HAS
[000:50:16;596] THE SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:50:18;799] BUT HIS COMPETITION IS PUTTING
[000:50:19;533] UP A FIGHT.
[000:50:19;933] THIS RACE COULD COME DOWN TO
[000:50:20;801] THE WIRE.
[000:50:36;516] put under a microscope,
[000:50:37;317] we could see all the
[000:50:38;051] bacteria that still exists.
[000:50:39;486] Polident's unique
[000:50:40;454] micro clean formula
[000:50:41;488] works in just 3 minutes,
[000:50:42;723] killing 99.99% of
[000:50:44;658] odor causing bacteria.
[000:50:46;259] For a cleaner,
[000:50:46;259] fresher,
[000:50:47;561] brighter denture
[000:50:47;561] every day.
[000:50:51;898] For a cleaner,
[000:50:51;898] fresher,
[000:50:51;898] 3 toddlers won't stop him..
[000:50:53;967] And neither will lower
[000:50:53;967] back pain.
[000:50:55;936] Because at a Dr. Scholl's Kiosk
[000:50:57;437] he got a recommendation for
[000:50:57;437] our Custom Fit Orthotic
[000:50:59;806] to relieve his foot,
[000:50:59;806] knee, or lower back pain,
[000:51:01;842] from being on his feet.
[000:51:03;376] Dr. Scholl's.
[000:51:03;376] Born to Move.
[000:51:08;081] When food is good
[000:51:08;081] and clean and real,
[000:51:11;618] it's ok to crave.
[000:51:14;955] And with Panera catering,
[000:51:14;955] there's more to go around.
[000:51:18;024] Panera.
[000:51:18;759] Food as it should be.
[000:53:49;025] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED A
[000:53:49;726] PROCLAMATION IMPLEMENTING
[000:53:50;360] TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON EIGHT
[000:53:51;061] COUNTRIES.
[000:53:51;428] THIS REPLACES THE EMBATTLED
[000:53:52;095] TRAVEL PLAN WHICH JUST EXPIRED
[000:53:52;829] TODAY.
[000:53:53;129] SOME OF THE AFFECTED COUNTRIES
[000:53:53;863] INCLUDE NORTH KOREA AND
[000:53:54;464] VENEZUELA AS WELL AS SIX
[000:53:55;131] OTHERS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST
[000:53:55;865] AND AFRICA.
[000:53:56;266] SECRETARY OF STATE REX
[000:53:56;866] TILLERSON SANG WITH THIS
[000:54:04;107] PROCLAMATION, THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:54:04;841] CARRYING OUT HIS DUTY TO
[000:54:05;475] PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:54:06;176] THE STATE DEPARTMENT WILL
[000:54:06;843] COORDINATE WITH OTHER FEDERAL
[000:54:07;544] AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THESE IN
[000:54:08;645] AN ORDERLY MATTER.
[000:54:09;346] WE CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY.
[000:54:16;586] THE STATE OF ALABAMA ON THE
[000:54:17;487] EVE OF ELECTION, INCUMBENT
[000:54:20;724] SENATOR LUTHER STRANGE AGAINST
[000:54:23;627] ROY MOORE IN A RACE WHERE
[000:54:27;364] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LOOMING
[000:54:28;031] LARGER THAN OTHER.
[000:54:28;965] PETER'S REPORTING FROM
[000:54:30;033] BIRMINGHAM.
[000:54:31;568] DOES HE THINK THE NFL
[000:54:35;071] CRITICISM AT HIS EVENT WILL
[000:54:35;839] CHANGE THIS RACE AT ALL?
[000:54:45;749] >> YES HE DOES.
[000:54:46;216] HE ACTUALLY THANKS IT WILL
[000:54:46;916] HELP HIM.
[000:54:47;284] HE THANKS BEING ASSOCIATED
[000:54:47;951] WITH THAT KIND OF CONDEMNATION
[000:54:49;219] OF KNEELING NFL PLAYERS ONLY
[000:54:56;326] HOPE HELPS HIS CHANCES.
[000:54:56;926] HE DOES NOT MIND THAT THE BIG
[000:54:57;961] HEADLINE FROM HIS OWN CAMPAIGN
[000:54:58;728] EVENT WITH SOMETHING OTHER
[000:54:59;396] THAN THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:55:01;665] ENDORSEMENT.
[000:55:04;834] >> I LOVE THAT HEADLINE.
[000:55:05;468] HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST
[000:55:06;202] PATRIOTIC CITIES IN THE
[000:55:06;803] COUNTRY, HUNTSVILLE AND A
[000:55:07;437] PATRIOTIC STATE.
[000:55:14;210] WE RESPECT THE FLAG.
[000:55:14;744] EVERYBODY HAS GOT THE RIGHT TO
[000:55:15;645] DO WHAT THEY WANT THE COUNTRY
[000:55:16;579] BUT THEY OUGHT TO RESPECT THE
[000:55:17;480] FLAG AND I THINK IT WAS WELL
[000:55:18;448] RECEIVED.
[000:55:18;815] I COULDN'T AGREE WITH THE
[000:55:19;482] PRESIDENT MORE.
[000:55:24;654] >> SENATOR STRANGE SAYS IN
[000:55:25;322] ALABAMA, THE PRESIDENT'S VISIT
[000:55:26;022] IS REALLY RESONATING BECAUSE
[000:55:26;723] IN ALABAMA, VOTERS REALLY WANT
[000:55:27;490] THE PRESIDENT TO SUCCEED AND
[000:55:28;325] HE IS OUT OF THIS RUNOFF.
[000:55:30;794] >> HOW IS THE CHALLENGER THIS
[000:55:34;931] WEEKEND.
