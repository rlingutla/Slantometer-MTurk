TO DESTROY A CHEMICAL WEAPON YOU

113
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
HAVE TO GET IT HOT.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A BOMB IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
IT'S GOING TO THROW IT AROUND

115

THE SURROUNDING AREA AND YOU

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
COULD SPREAD THE CHEMICAL

117

WEAPONS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY.

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
WE ALSO DON'T WANT THE SITES

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
STEAL THEM AND USE THEM IN A

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TERRORIST ATTACK LATER ON.

CHARACTERISTICS.

127
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC IS THEY

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
WANT TO DEGRADE ASSAD'S MILITARY

129

CAPABILITY TO A SIGNIFICANT

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
DEGREE.

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THEY'LL PROBABLY GO AFTER AIR

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
FIELDS SUCH AS THE ONE IN
DAMASCUS AND THE ONE THAT

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
DESTROYED HELICOPTERS AND

AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE.

137
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000

WE HAD A GREAT SPOT,
NOT EASY TO FIND, BUT WORTH IT.

721
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
BUT WITH COPD
MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,

722
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I THOUGHT
THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.

723
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
SO MY DOCTOR
PRESCRIBED SYMBICORT.

724
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
MY LUNG FUNCTION

725

STARTING WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.

726
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE
A RESCUE INHALER

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.

728
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
WITH SYMBICORT,
TODAY I'M BREATHING BETTER.

729
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
AND THAT MEANS...FISH ON!

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD

731
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
AND EMPHYSEMA.

732
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.

733
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
OF LUNG INFECTIONS,

734
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
OSTEOPOROSIS,
AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.

735
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION

736
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
BEFORE TAKING IT.

737
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000

I'D MISS OUR FAMILY TRADITION.
