PROMISING.

115
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.

116

CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY BASHAR

122
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
AL ASSAD WOULD CROSS THE RED

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
LINE.
AND IT IS THE PUBLIC PLEDGE

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
COUPLED WITH THE HORRIFIC

125
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000

PRESIDENT PREACHES CAUTION.

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
>> SOMETIMES WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

130
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IS THAT FOLKS WILL CALL FOR

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
IMMEDIATE ACTION, JUMPING INTO

132
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
STUFF THAT DOES NOT TURN OUT

WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
EASILY.
KEY PRESIDENTIAL AIDES ARE SPLIT

146
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000

INITIALLY AGGRESSIVE AND

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
SOFTENED UNTIL THE LATEST
PICTURES EMERGED AND TODAY IS

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
ADVOCATING AN AGGRESSIVE

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000

ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
DETERMINED.

162
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
NUMBER ONE, THAT THE U.S. GETS

163
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
ACTUAL PROOF THAT ASSAD USED

164
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

165
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND,

166
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
SECOND, THEY NEED TO HAVE A

167
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.

168
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000

MIGUEL ALMAGUER IS THERE.

MIGUEL, GOOD EVENING.

>> Reporter: LESTER, GOOD
EVENING.

194
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
THE MOONSCAPE HERE SPREADS FOR
MILES.

195
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
THIS FIRE IS MASSIVE.

196
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
SO FAR MORE THAN 106,000 ACRES

197
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
HAVE BEEN CHARRED, AND THE FIRE
IS GROWING LARGER AND LARGER

198
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
LIVE

199
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE THE
BURN ZONE IS THREE TIMES THE

200
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO.

201
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
AND TODAY THE BLAZE IS MOVING IN

202
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS.

203
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
THE INFERNO HAS ALREADY CREPT IN
TO YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK.

204
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
FOR NOW HAVE IT REMAINS SOME 20

205
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
MILES AWAY FROM YOSEMITE VALLEY,
ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S GREATEST

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
TREASURES.

207
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A WALL OF FLAMES, THE RIM FIRE

208
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
IS ON THE RUN IN NEARLY
INACCESSIBLE TERRAIN.

209
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
IT SHOWS NO SIGN OF SLOWING

210
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THE INFERNO IS NOW CLOSING IN ON

213
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
165 SQUARE MILES.

214
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000

215
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
FIRE ITSELF.

216
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I MEAN, IT'S MAKING ITS OWN
WEATHER.

217
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
THE 40,000-FOOT COLUMNS ARE

218
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
JUST UNREAL.

ARE LOSING GROUND.
EVEN THE AIR ATTACKS CAN'T SLOW

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
THIS BLAZE.

SET BACKFIRES TO MAKE THIS BLAZE

241
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
CLOSE IN ON ITSELF TO SUFFOCATE
ITSELF OUT.

242
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THE WORK SHIFT WILL LAST 36

243
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
HOURS, THEN A BREAK WHERE THEY

244
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000

AFTERNOON, THEY ARE WORRIED THEY

271
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
THIS BLAZE IS ROUGHLY 2%

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
CONTAINED AND COST $5 MILLION TO

>>> THE FIRE DANGER CONTINUES IN

276
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
TO THE WEEKEND ACROSS A HUGE

277
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE

278
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
SUDDENLY IT IS LIKE THE WILD,
WILD WEST.

279
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
A MASSIVE DUST STORM, A FREAK

280
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HAILSTORM AND NEW FLASH FLOOD
WARNINGS TONIGHT, ALL HITTING AT

ONCE.

282
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
FOR MORE ON THAT, WE GO TO

METEOROLOGIST JIM CANTORE AT

HI, JIM.

286
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
>> HEY, LESTER.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

287
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
YOU KNOW, THE IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW, WE

288
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN INTO WHAT IS

289
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
KNOWN AS THE SANTA ANA SEASON

290
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
FOR SOUTHERN

291
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
CALIFORNIA.
SO YOU DON'T SEE MANY RED DOTS.

292
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
IN THROUGH HERE.
ALL OF THESE DOTS REPRESENT ALL

293
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
OF THE LARGE FIRES

294
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
OUT THERE,

295
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
THE DOZENS OF LARGE FIRES OUT
THERE.

296
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
BUT AS WE GET IN TO THIS

297
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
WEEKEND, A DEEP SURGE OF

298
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL COME
NORTH, ACROSS THE WEST.

299
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
IT WON'T GET IN THE FIRE ZONES,

300
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
UNFORTUNATELY.

301
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
IT MAY HELP A COUPLE OF THESE,

302
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
BUT WE DON'T THINK IT WILL HELP
MANY.

303
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
LOOK AT THIS.

304
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
LOCALLY 2 TO 3 INCHES OF RAIN.
YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT IS MUCH

305
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
BUT THERE ARE SOME PLACES IN

306
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA THAT GET

307
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
2 TO 3 INCHES IN A YEAR, SO

308
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
THIS IS A TREMENDOUS FLOOD

309
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THREAT FOR THE WEST.
LET ME SHOW YOU THE KIND OF

310
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
WEATHER THAT ACCOMPANIES

311
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
MOISTURE ONCE YOU GET IT INTO

312
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
THE WEST.

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
LITTLETON, COLORADO, THIS

314
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
IS A STORM THAT GOT

315
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
UP TO EIGHT TO TEN MILES HIGH.

316
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
INSTEAD OF PRODUCING RAIN, WHEN

317
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
IT COLLAPSED, IT PRODUCED HAIL

318
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
AND TONS OF HAIL, ENOUGH IT HAD

319
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
TO BE REMOVED BY SNOWPLOWS IN

320
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
LITTLETON, COLORADO.

321
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OFF TO YUMA, ARIZONA, NO RAIN OR

322
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
NO HAIL HERE.

323
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING

324
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ABOUT DUST THAT FELL AND WAS

325
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
PUSHED FROM THESE STORMS BECAUSE

326
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
BASICALLY AS THESE STORMS

327
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
COLLAPSE, THE AIR BELOW IT IS

328
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
TOO DRY.

329
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
SO AS WE GO HURRICANELESS IN THE
ATLANTIC BASIN, A SERIOUS

330
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
TROPICAL FLOOD THREAT FOR THE
