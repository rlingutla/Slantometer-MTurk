[000:01:17;477] REPORTS OF A BREAK IN THE CASE.
[000:01:18;511] AND HERE'S THE QUESTION --
[000:01:20;113] HAS THE BOMBER BEEN SPOTTED
[000:01:20;847] ON A SURVEILLANCE TAPE?
[000:01:22;782] AS WE'VE HEARD THERE WAS
[000:01:24;350] VIDEOTAPE EVERYWHERE AT THAT
[000:01:25;952] MOMENT ON THAT DAY OF THE
[000:01:26;653] MARATHON.
[000:01:28;621] EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE
[000:01:29;656] IMAGES.
[000:01:32;859] AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT ON THIS
[000:01:34;461] NIGHT, 62 INJURED ARE STILL
[000:01:36;029] FIGHTING FOR RECOVERY IN THE
[000:01:37;630] HOSPITAL, AND 12 OF THEM REMAIN
[000:01:39;232] IN CRITICAL CONDITION.
[000:01:41;868] SO LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE
[000:01:43;503] LATEST NEWS RIGHT NOW FROM
[000:01:45;105] ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
[000:01:46;172] CORRESPONDENT, BRIAN ROSS.
[000:01:46;840] BRIAN?
[000:01:49;342] >> Reporter: DIANE, AUTHORITIES
[000:01:50;910] PUT OUT THE WORD TODAY, JUST 48
[000:01:52;512] HOURS AFTER THE BOMBS WENT OFF,
[000:01:54;114] THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE
[000:01:55;181] BOMBER.
[000:01:57;851] THE DEVELOPMENTS CAME ON A DAY
[000:01:59;385] OF UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS
[000:02:00;987] AND A SERIOUS CASE OF SECURITY
[000:02:02;088] JITTERS.
[000:02:05;258] >> THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
[000:02:06;326] THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
[000:02:07;894] >> Reporter: THE FEDERAL
[000:02:08;962] COURTHOUSE, WHERE ANY SUSPECT
[000:02:10;597] WOULD STAND TRIAL, WAS EVACUATED
[000:02:12;165] LATE THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE OF
[000:02:13;233] A BOMB THREAT THAT,
[000:02:14;300] UNDERSTANDABLY, WAS TAKEN VERY
[000:02:15;301] SERIOUSLY.
[000:02:16;402] >> WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU?
[000:02:18;004] >> CODE RED EVACUATION.
[000:02:19;572] >> CODE RED, EVACUATE THE
[000:02:20;640] BUILDING.
[000:02:22;275] >> Reporter: NO BOMB WAS FOUND.
[000:02:23;343] BUT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE
[000:02:25;478] FORCED A POSTPONEMENT OF A NEWS
[000:02:27;113] CONFERENCE WHERE OFFICIALS HAD
[000:02:28;148] PLANNED TO TALK ABOUT A POSSIBLE
[000:02:30;750] SUSPECT.
[000:02:32;886] AUTHORITIES SAY THE FBI IS
[000:02:33;953] FOCUSED ON PHOTOGRAPHS,
[000:02:36;089] INCLUDING SOME TAKEN BY A
[000:02:37;123] SURVEILLANCE CAMERA AT THE
[000:02:38;191] LORD & TAYLOR STORE, THAT SHOW
[000:02:39;792] A MAN IN THE RACE-DAY CROWD,
[000:02:40;860] USING A CELLPHONE, WITH A BLACK
[000:02:45;098] BAG STRAPPED ACROSS HIS CHEST
[000:02:46;699] THAT AUTHORITIES SAY MAY CONTAIN
[000:02:47;800] THE BOMB.
[000:02:49;369] THE KEY FRAMES ARE JUST A FEW OF
[000:02:50;436] THE MILLIONS OF FRAMES OF VIDEO
[000:02:52;038] EXAMINED IN THE LAST 36 HOURS BY
[000:02:53;640] A SPECIAL TEAM OF FBI FORENSIC
[000:02:55;708] EXPERTS, THE OPERATIONAL
[000:02:57;343] TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.
[000:02:59;445] THEY HAVE SET UP FACILITIES AT
[000:03:00;513] A RESTRICTED LOCATION NEAR THE
[000:03:01;581] BOSTON HARBOR.
[000:03:03;216] AND THEY ARE MASTERS AT WHAT IS
[000:03:05;351] KNOWN AS FACIAL RECOGNITION,
[000:03:07;453] THE NEW SCIENCE OF CONVERTING A
[000:03:09;589] FACE INTO A NAME, DEMONSTRATED
[000:03:11;157] HERE BY AN INDIANA COMPANY THAT
[000:03:12;759] WAS USED BY THE FBI FOLLOWING
[000:03:14;360] THE 9/11 ATTACKS.
[000:03:17;530] >> IN THIS INVESTIGATION, THERE
[000:03:19;165] WILL BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
[000:03:19;933] IMAGES.
[000:03:21;234] IF THEY HAVE A SUSPECT
[000:03:22;802] IDENTIFIED, THEY KNOW THE AREA
[000:03:24;437] THAT SUSPECT WAS IN, THEY'LL BE
[000:03:25;505] ABLE TO THEN TRACK THE PERSON
[000:03:27;073] BACK TO AN IMAGE AND SAY, HERE
[000:03:28;141] WE HAVE HIM.
[000:03:30;276] >> Reporter: THE FBI TECH AGENTS
[000:03:31;878] ARE ALSO EXAMINING TINY BITS OF
[000:03:32;946] DEBRIS RECOVERED AT THE CRIME
[000:03:33;980] SCENE.
[000:03:35;548] THERE ARE WIRE FRAGMENTS WITH
[000:03:37;150] MANUFACTURING NAMES, TINY NAILS
[000:03:38;751] USED AS SHRAPNEL, AS WELL AS THE
[000:03:40;920] MANGLED REMAINS OF THE PRESSURE
[000:03:43;056] COOKER THAT AGENTS SAY WAS USED
[000:03:44;657] TO BUILD THE BOMB, AND MAY WELL
[000:03:46;259] HAVE FINGERPRINTS STILL ON IT.
[000:03:48;394] >> ONE OF THE KEYS IN ANY TRIAL
[000:03:49;963] IS LINKING THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE
[000:03:51;531] TO THE SUSPECT.
[000:03:55;235] IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO
[000:03:56;869] MATCH THE BOMB TO THE BAD GUY.
[000:04:01;074] >> Reporter: ULTIMATELY, WHOEVER
[000:04:02;141] IS ARRESTED WILL ALMOST
[000:04:03;710] CERTAINLY FACE AT LEAST THREE
[000:04:05;311] COUNTS OF PREMEDITATED MURDER,
[000:04:06;946] FOR THE DEATHS OF 8-YEAR-OLD
[000:04:08;481] MARTIN RICHARD, 29-YEAR-OLD

[000:04:14;887] STUDENT LINGZI LU, A NATIVE OF
[000:04:16;456] CHINA.
[000:04:19;692] THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS A
[000:04:21;828] THOUSAND AGENTS ASSIGNED TO THIS
[000:04:22;829] CASE.
[000:04:24;964] TONIGHT THERE'S A SENSE FROM
[000:04:26;032] MANY OF THEM THAT THEY'RE
[000:04:27;066] GETTING MUCH CLOSER.
[000:04:29;235] >> BRIAN, THANK YOU.
[000:04:34;574] >>> WE WANT TO BRING IN RICHARD
[000:04:37;877] CLARK, WHO IS WAS A NATIONAL

[000:04:45;685] ADMINISTRATIONS.
[000:05:07;607] >> THERE'S GOOD NEWS THERE
[000:05:09;075] APPARENTLY THAT THEY HAVE SOME
[000:05:10;443] FACES.
[000:05:10;877] SO WE MAY BE IN ONE OF THOSE
[000:05:13;246] CASES THAT GETS CRACKED QUICKLY.
[000:05:17;283] TO.
[000:05:17;650] TOO EARLY TO TELL YET.

[000:05:23;956] LOCKERBIE PAN AM 103.
[000:05:26;559] >> IT WAS A 747 THAT BLEW UP AT
[000:05:29;562] ALTITUDE, SPREAD OVER A HUNDRED
[000:05:30;797] SQUARE MILES.
[000:05:32;765] THE FBI PUT THAT PLANE BACK
[000:05:33;700] TOGETHER JUST AS THEY ARE TODAY
[000:05:35;134] PUTTING THE BOMBS BACK TOGETHER.
[000:05:36;569] >> I KNOW YOU'LL BE STANDING BY

[000:05:56;556] TOXIN -- LETTERS SENT TO THE
[000:05:58;725] PRESIDENT AND TO A CENTER.
[000:05:59;425] THE TOXIN IS RICIN WHICH CAN

[000:06:03;830] NO ANTIDOTE.

[000:06:35;962] EASILY MADE FROM CASTOR BEANS,
[000:06:39;532] BY WOULD-BE BIOTERRORISTS.
[000:06:41;768] >> IF YOU INGEST ENOUGH, IT
[000:06:43;403] COULD BE VERY DAMAGING AND IT
[000:06:45;037] COULD KILL YOU.

[000:06:56;416] THE LETTERS NEVER REACHED THE

[000:06:59;652] >> THE MAIL SENT HERE IS
[000:07:01;487] SCREENED AND THE TESTS ARE TAKEN
[000:07:03;256] AT REMOTE SITES TO MITIGATE THE

[000:07:09;695] HILL.
[000:07:10;129] THE SECOND LETTER TO THE WHITE

[000:08:07;920] THE NEWTOWN SHOOTING.
[000:08:12;925] TONIGHT, IT HAS FAILED IN THE
[000:08:13;659] SENATE, AND THE PRESIDENT SPOKE
[000:08:14;427] JUST THIS AFTERNOON.
[000:08:15;061] ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
[000:08:15;728] CORRESPONDENT, JONATHAN KARL, IS
[000:08:16;496] THERE NOW.
[000:08:17;029] >> Reporter: THIS WAS THE SINGLE
[000:08:18;064] BEST CHANCE TO PASS ANY PART OF
[000:08:19;665] THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO COMBAT
[000:08:21;300] GUN VIOLENCE AND IT COULDN'T
[000:08:22;869] EVEN GET PASSED IN THE
[000:08:24;470] DEMOCRATICALLY-CONTROLLED
[000:08:25;137] SENATE.
[000:08:29;242] SURROUNDED BY VICTIMS OF GUN
[000:08:30;309] VIOLENCE, THE PRESIDENT ANGRILY
[000:08:31;878] DENOUNCED THE VOTE.
[000:08:34;013] >> THERE ARE NO COHERENT
[000:08:35;615] ARGUMENTS AS TO WHY WE WOULDN'T
[000:08:36;382] DO THIS.
[000:08:37;250] IT CAME DOWN TO POLITICS.
[000:08:39;352] SO ALL IN ALL THIS WAS A PRETTY
[000:08:40;419] SHAMEFUL DAY IN WASHINGTON.
[000:08:43;122] >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT WAS
[000:08:44;190] JOINED BY MARK BARDEN, WHO LOST
[000:08:45;191] HIS SON DANIEL IN THE SANDY HOOK
[000:08:46;259] MASSACRE.
[000:08:47;793] >> WE'LL RETURN HOME NOW,
[000:08:49;428] DISAPPOINTED, BUT NOT DEFEATED.
[000:08:52;598] WE RETURN HOME WITH THE
[000:08:54;200] DETERMINATION THAT CHANGE WILL
[000:08:55;801] HAPPEN.
[000:08:56;869] MAYBE NOT TODAY, BUT IT WILL
[000:08:57;937] HAPPEN.
[000:08:59;005] IT WILL HAPPEN SOON.
[000:09:00;072] >> THE AMENDMENT IS NOT AGREED
[000:09:01;107] TO.

[000:09:04;810] PRESIDENT PRESIDING, THE BILL
[000:09:05;912] FELL SHORT OF THE 60 VOTES IT
[000:09:06;646] NEEDED TO PASS.
[000:09:07;980] PROMPTING SOMEONE IN THE
[000:09:09;081] GALLERIES TO SHOUT OUT.
[000:09:12;285] >> ORDER IN THE SENATE.
[000:09:13;886] >> Reporter: THE VOTE WAS A
[000:09:14;954] CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT TO THE
[000:09:16;589] VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE WHO HAD
[000:09:18;157] BEEN PLEADING WITH SENATORS TO
[000:09:19;225] PASS THE BILL.
[000:09:20;826] MANY OF THEM WERE HERE TO WATCH
[000:09:21;861] AS THE VOTE WENT DOWN.
[000:09:24;497] 12-YEAR-OLD JAMES BARDEN WHOSE
[000:09:26;599] LITTLE BROTHER WAS MURDERED AT
[000:09:27;633] SANDY HOOK WAS THERE.
[000:09:29;769] >> I FEEL WE OWE IT TO DANIEL.
[000:09:32;972] 'CAUSE HIS LIFE NEEDS TO MEAN
[000:09:34;040] SOMETHING.
[000:09:38;311] AND NO ONE ELSE SHOULD HAVE TO
[000:09:39;045] DO THIS.
[000:09:40;446] >> Reporter: THIS WAS JUST ONE
[000:09:41;514] PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN
[000:09:42;582] THAT WOULD HAVE EXPANDED
[000:09:43;649] BACKGROUND CHECKS TO ALL
[000:09:45;217] PURCHASES AT GUN SHOWS AND
[000:09:45;918] ONLINE.
[000:09:47;353] THEY'RE NOW ONLY REQUIRED FOR
[000:09:48;354] GUNS BOUGHT AT GUN DEALERS.
[000:09:50;489] IT MEANS THE REST OF THE
[000:09:52;658] PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS EFFECTIVELY
[000:09:53;426] DEAD.
[000:09:54;794] ALTHOUGH JOE BIDEN TOLD US THE
[000:09:55;861] FIGHT IS NOT OVER.
[000:09:57;997] >> IT'S TIME FOR THE AMERICAN
[000:10:00;099] PEOPLE TO MAKE IT CLEAR JUST
[000:10:01;701] HOW DISPLEASED THEY ARE WITH
[000:10:03;269] THIS VOTE AND LET THEIR
[000:10:04;370] REPRESENTATIVES KNOW THAT.
[000:10:06;939] THIS IS FAR FROM OVER.
[000:10:09;075] >> Reporter: I JUST FINISHED
[000:10:10;142] TALKING TO THOSE SANDY HOOK
[000:10:10;876] FAMILIES.
[000:10:11;777] THEY ARE TIRED, EMOTIONALLY
[000:10:13;879] DRAINED, BUT THEY TELL ME
[000:10:15;481] THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED
[000:10:16;549] TO CONTINUE THIS FIGHT.
[000:10:18;117] BUT AS FAR AS THIS BILL, THIS
