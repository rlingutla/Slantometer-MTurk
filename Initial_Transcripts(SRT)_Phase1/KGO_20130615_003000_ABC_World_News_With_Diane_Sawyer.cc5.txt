[000:01:12;272] AN UNKNOWN HEADING INTO THIS

[000:01:14;407] WILL THEY HAVE A HOME TO RETURN
[000:01:15;141] TO?
[000:01:16;509] THIS IS FAST-MOVING.
[000:01:18;711] THIS EVENING, TAKE A LOOK.
[000:01:19;779] A NORMAN ROCKWELL NEIGHBORHOOD,
[000:01:20;847] JUST ONE HOME SPARED THERE.
[000:01:22;348] TREES COVERED IN ASH.
[000:01:25;051] JUST THE SKELETON OF A HOME

[000:01:50;510] MONSTROUS FIRE THAT'S KILLED TWO
[000:01:52;645] PEOPLE, DESTROYED ALMOST 400
[000:01:53;713] HOMES AND TURNED ENTIRE
[000:01:54;781] NEIGHBORHOODS INTO CHARRED
[000:01:55;482] WASTELANDS.
[000:02:00;687] >> WE GOT OUR TAILS KICKED FOR A
[000:02:03;723] COUPLE DAYS.

[000:02:10;363] BELIEVES SOMEONE STARTED THIS
[000:02:11;131] FIRE, BUT DOESN'T KNOW IF BY
[000:02:12;132] ACCIDENT OR ON PURPOSE.
[000:02:13;199] AND FOR NOW, THE FIRE ZONE IS
[000:02:14;234] STILL TOO DANGEROUS TO LET
[000:02:15;268] PEOPLE GO HOME.
[000:02:16;336] >> YOU DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING
[000:02:17;103] TO EVEN HAVE A HOME.

[000:02:28;581] UP AGAIN, FORCED TO DRIVE TO THE
[000:02:29;649] ONLY HOTEL THEY COULD FIND, TWO
[000:02:30;717] HOURS AWAY.

[000:02:34;988] IS -- IF ANYTHING, WE HAVE EACH
[000:02:37;123] OTHER AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE

[000:02:44;030] AGO, THE MASSIVE WALDO CANYON
[000:02:45;098] FIRE JUST A FEW MILES AWAY
[000:02:47;200] TURNED SHAWNA'S HOUSE INTO
[000:02:48;268] ASHES.
[000:02:50;403] >> THIS IS MY HOUSE.
[000:02:52;539] >> SO THIS IS THE HOUSE.

[000:03:01;481] AND THAT IT DOES GET BETTER.
[000:03:03;116] IT'S A JOURNEY OF HEALING.
[000:03:05;218] IT TAKES TIME.
[000:03:07;887] >> Reporter: FOR THOMAS, SOME OF
[000:03:08;922] THAT HEALING BEGAN WHEN HE WAS
[000:03:10;557] REUNITED WITH THE HORSE HE HAD
[000:03:11;291] TO LEAVE BEHIND.
[000:03:13;193] >> I'M REAL EXCITED TO SEE HIM.
[000:03:15;862] I THOUGHT I LOST HIM.
[000:03:18;565] >> Reporter: THIS ROADBLOCK HAS
[000:03:19;299] BEEN UP ALL DAY.
[000:03:20;667] BUT NOW THAT THE WEATHER IS
[000:03:22;302] STARTING TO COOPERATE, THEY'RE
[000:03:23;336] TAKING IT DOWN AND SOME PEOPLE
[000:03:24;938] WILL BE ALLOWED TO GO HOME.
[000:03:26;506] >> CLAYTON SANDELL, THANK YOU.
[000:03:29;175] >>> FROM THE FIRES IN THE WEST,
[000:03:31;311] TO THE EAST, TO THE STORMFRONT
[000:03:32;378] THAT LEFT A TRAIL OF
[000:03:33;446] DESTRUCTION.
[000:03:35;014] SEVERAL DEATHS ARE BEING BLAMED
[000:03:35;748] ON FALLING TREES.
[000:03:38;151] ABC'S GINGER ZEE ON THE REAL
[000:03:40;286] DANGER AND THE NEW SEVERE
[000:03:41;854] WEATHER THREAT AS WE HEAD INTO
[000:03:42;622] THE WEEKEND.
[000:03:46;092] >> Reporter: THE RAIN FELL IN
[000:03:46;859] SHEETS.
[000:03:48;761] IN WEST VIRGINIA, FLASH

[000:03:50;363] A RESCUER, HERE TRYING TO GET A
[000:03:51;431] CHILD TO SAFETY.
[000:03:53;600] DOWNED TREES KILLING AT LEAST
[000:03:54;634] THREE PEOPLE.
[000:03:56;236] MUCH OF THE TREE DAMAGE BEING
[000:03:57;270] BLAMED IN PART ON ALREADY
[000:03:58;371] SATURATED SOIL.
[000:04:01;074] YOUR TYPICAL SUBURBAN 85-FOOT
[000:04:02;609] TREE HAS ROOTS THAT EXTEND THREE
[000:04:04;210] TO FOUR FEET INTO THE GROUND.
[000:04:06;346] THREE TO FOUR INCHES OF RAIN CAN
[000:04:07;981] SOFTEN THE SOIL ENOUGH THAT
[000:04:09;549] WINDS CAN EASILY KNOCK IT DOWN.
[000:04:12;218] WATCH IT IN REAL TIME.
[000:04:14;854] WHEN A STORM HITS, HAVE SHELTER
[000:04:16;923] THAT YOU KNOW IS SAFE, EVEN IF
[000:04:18;491] TREES FALL INTO YOUR HOME.
[000:04:21;694] MORE DAMAGING WINDS ROLLING

[000:04:28;134] EASTERN NEBRASKA, PARTS OF

[000:04:42;248] MORNING.
[000:04:43;149] THANK YOU.
[000:04:44;183] >>> WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE MAJOR
[000:04:46;352] HEADLINE INVOLVING SYRIA AND
[000:04:47;920] WORD THAT THE U.S. IS NOW READY
[000:04:48;988] TO ARM THE REBELS.
[000:04:50;590] CONVINCED THAT PRESIDENT ASSAD
[000:04:51;658] USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST
[000:04:52;725] HIS OWN PEOPLE.
[000:04:54;294] TONIGHT OUR TEAM TACKLING THE
[000:04:55;328] BIG QUESTIONS.
[000:04:56;896] JUST WHAT KIND OF WEAPONS ARE WE
[000:04:57;697] GIVING?
[000:04:58;464] WHO ARE WE GIVING THEM TO?
[000:05:00;600] AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
[000:05:02;201] AMERICA AFTER THE WARS IN IRAQ
[000:05:02;969] AND AFGHANISTAN?
[000:05:04;337] IS SYRIA NOW NEXT?
[000:05:06;439] WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE BEGINNING
[000:05:07;540] WITH ALEX MARQUARDT, ON THE
[000:05:08;608] SYRIAN BORDER.
[000:05:09;175] HE LEADS US OFF.
[000:05:13;379] >> Reporter: IT HAS NOT BEEN AN
[000:05:14;480] EVEN FIGHT.
[000:05:17;650] FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS,
[000:05:19;218] PRESIDENT ASSAD'S ARMY
[000:05:20;853] INFLICTING UNTOLD DEATH AND
[000:05:22;388] DESTRUCTION, POUNDING AWAY WITH
[000:05:24;057] TANKS AND HEAVY ARTILLERY.
[000:05:27;760] WHILE THE REBELS RESPOND WITH
[000:05:29;896] MORTARS AND ROCKET-PROPELLED
[000:05:30;930] GRENADES.
[000:05:32;031] THE REGIME'S JETS STREAK ACROSS
[000:05:32;799] THE SKY.
[000:05:34;667] AS THE REBELS TRY TO TAKE THEM
[000:05:35;435] DOWN WITH WEAPONS THEY'VE
[000:05:36;235] STOLEN.
[000:05:38;871] SOME REBEL GROUPS ARE WELL
[000:05:40;473] EQUIPPED, WHILE MANY ARE
[000:05:42;041] DESPERATE FOR AMMUNITION AND
[000:05:43;676] RESORT TO HOME-MADE WEAPONS LIKE
[000:05:44;444] THIS GIANT SLINGSHOT.
[000:05:50;049] WE'VE SEEN THE SPARSE REBEL
[000:05:51;651] ARSENAL FIRST HAND.
[000:05:54;287] THE REGIME HAS TANKS, PLANES,
[000:05:55;888] HELICOPTERS AND YOU JUST HAVE
[000:05:56;956] AK-47s AND RPGs.
[000:05:59;125] HOW CAN YOU DEFEAT THEM IN
[000:05:59;792] ALEPPO?
[000:06:02;295] "WE HAVE GOD ALMIGHTY," HE SAID,
[000:06:03;863] "WHO IS FIGHTING WITH US."
[000:06:07;600] AMERICA NOW SAYS IT WILL SEND
[000:06:09;168] WEAPONS TO THE REBELS, SMALL
[000:06:11;337] ARMS, NOT THE ROCKETS NEEDED TO
[000:06:12;905] TAKE OUT TANKS OR PLANES.
[000:06:15;074] TONIGHT, WE MET A REBEL LEADER
[000:06:16;676] WHO SAYS, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
[000:06:19;846] THE WEAPONS WON'T BE GOOD ENOUGH
[000:06:21;447] FOR US TO WIN, HE SAID.
[000:06:23;049] I'M AFRAID THEY'LL JUST MAKE THE
[000:06:23;816] WAR GO ON LONGER.
[000:06:26;152] >> Reporter: THE OBAMA
[000:06:27;220] ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN HESITANT
[000:06:28;788] TO OFFER BIGGER WEAPONS, KNOWING
[000:06:29;889] HOW DISORGANIZED THE REBEL
[000:06:33;059] FORCES ARE AND RECOGNIZING THAT
[000:06:34;660] SOME OF THE STRONGEST AMONG
[000:06:35;728] THEM HAVE SWORN ALLEGIANCE TO
[000:06:36;496] AL QAEDA.
[000:06:37;864] THE FEAR BEING SOME OF THESE
[000:06:39;499] AMERICAN WEAPONS COULD EASILY
[000:06:40;233] FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS.
[000:06:41;601] DAVID?
[000:06:42;668] >> ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS.
[000:06:44;270] I WANT TO BRING IN ABC'S MARTHA
[000:06:45;304] RADDATZ.
[000:06:49;542] WE WERE ALL TALKING EARLIER
[000:06:51;144] ABOUT FEARS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY
[000:06:52;779] THAT THIS COULD BE A SLIPPERY
[000:06:53;846] SLOPE, THAT THIS COULD BE
[000:06:54;947] ANOTHER WAR WE'RE HEADED INTO.
[000:06:57;049] >> WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS
[000:06:58;618] SAID EMPHATICALLY, NO BOOTS ON
[000:06:59;685] THE GROUND IN SYRIA.
[000:07:01;320] BUT I DO THINK MANY AMERICANS
[000:07:03;423] WORRY ABOUT THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE.
[000:07:04;924] WE WERE AT WAR IN IRAQ FOR
[000:07:07;059] NEARLY TEN YEARS, ALTHOUGH WE
[000:07:08;127] WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE OVER IN NO
[000:07:08;928] TIME.
[000:07:11;330] AND WE ARE STILL IN AFGHANISTAN
[000:07:12;899] AFTER NEARLY 12 YEARS.
[000:07:16;102] WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS FROM
[000:07:17;170] THOSE CONFLICTS AND NO ONE LIKES
[000:07:18;805] TO SEE SUCH HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE
[000:07:20;907] SLAUGHTER IN SYRIA, BUT THERE
[000:07:22;508] ARE MANY MILITARY OFFICERS I'VE
[000:07:24;610] SPOKEN TO WHO ARE CONCERNED
[000:07:26;245] ABOUT THE GOAL IN SYRIA, WITH
[000:07:28;381] THE SMALL ARMS, AND EVEN MORE
[000:07:29;949] CONCERNED, DAVID, ABOUT WHAT
[000:07:31;551] HAPPENS NEXT IF THEY DON'T DO
[000:07:33;085] ANY GOOD.
[000:07:34;187] >> ALL RIGHT, MARTHA, THANK YOU.

[000:08:06;052] >> Reporter: HE IS MICHAEL
[000:08:06;752] KARKOC, 94.
[000:08:08;721] AN ASSOCIATED PRESS
[000:08:10;289] INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT KARKOC

[000:08:33;079] AND SERVING AS A LEADER IN THE
[000:08:34;180] LOCAL UKRAINIAN COMMUNITY.
[000:08:36;849] REPORTS OF HIS DARK PAST ONLY
[000:08:38;951] CAME TO LIGHT BECAUSE OF AN
[000:08:40;553] AMATEUR NAZI HUNTER OVER IN
[000:08:42;154] ENGLAND WHO STUMBLED ACROSS THE
