HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT?
>> Reporter: WELL, IT'S

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
PERFECTLY LEGAL, BUT IT IS
HIGHLY UNUSUAL, IF NOT

319
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
UNPRECEDENTED, FOR A POLITICAL
PARTY TO PAY THE PERSONAL LEGAL

ALL THE MORE NOTABLE, DAVID,

326
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000

PreserVision
AREDS 2

599
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000

the National Eye
Institute recommends

601
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to help reduce

602
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000

609
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THAT I MAY REACH MY BLOOD
SUGAR AND A1C GOALS

610
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000

WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

612
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000

613
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO

A LITTLE WEIGHT.

TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

622
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST
MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES,

OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES

624

For the strength and energy,

713
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
to get back to doing
what you love.

714
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Ensure, always be you.

715
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
with moderate to severe
rheumatoid arthritis?
How do you chase what you love

716
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Do what I did.

717
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Ask your doctor about HUMIRA.

718
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It's proven to help relieve pain
and protect joints

719
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
from further irreversible damage
in many adults.

720
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
HUMIRA works by targeting
and helping to block

721
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
a specific source
of inflammation

722
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
that contributes to RA symptoms.

723
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
HUMIRA has been clinically
studied for over 20 years.

724
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability
to fight infections,

725
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
including tuberculosis.

726
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,

727
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
including lymphoma, have
happened; as have blood, liver,

728
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and nervous system problems,
serious allergic reactions,

729
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and new or worsening
heart failure.

730
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Before treatment,
get tested for TB.

731
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Tell your doctor
if you've been to areas

732
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
where certain fungal infections
are common,

733
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and if you've had TB,
hepatitis B,

734
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
are prone to infections, or have
flu-like symptoms or sores.

735
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't start HUMIRA if
you have an infection.

736
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Ready for a new chapter?

737
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Talk to your rheumatologist
about HUMIRA.

738
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is HUMIRA at work.

739
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
>>> FINALLY TONIGHT, AMERICA

740
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000

749
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
BUT 70% OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT DON'T
