[000:24:00;27] WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES WERE  
[000:24:01;28] LIKE OVER THE LAST 16  
[000:24:03;25] HOURS, HOW NERVOUS THEY  
[000:24:04;29] WERE GOING THROUGH ANOTHER  
[000:24:06;00] NIGHT NOT KNOWING IF THE  
[000:24:07;27] SUSPECT WAS CAUGHT OR  
[000:24:08;28] KNOWING THAT HE WASN'T  
[000:24:10;23] CAUGHT.  
[000:24:11;14] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE  
[000:24:12;07] HEARD GUNSHOTS.  
[000:24:13;01] WE CAME BACK OVER TO OUR  
[000:24:14;19] CAMERA POSITION, COP
[000:24:15;12] STARTED SCREAMING DOWN THE  
[000:24:16;13] STREET TOWARDS THE SOUND OF  
[000:24:17;23] THE GUNSHOTS.  
[000:24:19;05] THERE IS A LOT OF ACTIVITY.  
[000:24:21;06] WE'RE STUCK HERE RIGHT NOW.  
[000:24:23;05] POLICE HAVE LOCKED DOWN THE  
[000:24:25;15] AREA.  
[000:24:25;28] IT SEEMS LIKE RESIDENTS ARE  
[000:24:27;23] CURIOSITY IS GETTING THE  
[000:24:28;15] BETTER OFTHEY ARE COMING OUT OF  
[000:24:29;15] THEIR HOMES TO TAKE A LOOK    
[000:24:30;23] I CAN SEE A COUPLE BLOCKS THERE IS
[000:24:32;12] A GROUP OF  
[000:24:33;03] THEM FORMING.  
[000:24:34;05] POLICE ARE KEEPING THEM OFF  
[000:24:34;26] TO THE SIDE ON THE SIDE OF  
[000:24:35;23] THE ROAD.  
[000:24:37;22] BUT IT IS A FLUID SITUATION  
[000:24:39;06] HERE TO SAY THE LEAST.  
[000:24:41;27] WITHOUT DOUBT, CHRIS.  
[000:24:42;23] LOOKING AT THE VIDEO I CAN TELL FROM
[000:24:45;22] WATCHING THROUGHOUT THE DAY  
[000:24:47;09] THE MEANING OF ALL THOSE ON  
[000:24:48;22] SCENE IN WATER TOWN IS  
[000:24:49;28] COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN  
[000:24:50;21] WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE  
[000:24:51;26] EARLY MORNING HOURS TOY  
[000:24:52;19] WHEN ALL OF THIS BEGAN.  
[000:24:54;03] ONCE THE SUN C
[000:24:54;20] WAS A VERY TENSE PLACE.  
[000:24:56;10] IT LOOKED LIKE AN ARMED  
[000:24:57;25] CITY AT WAR.  
[000:24:58;21] THERE WERE MILITARY  
[000:24:59;19] VEHICLES AND SWAT IN FULL  
[000:25:01;15] BODY ARMOR.  
[000:25:02;11] AND REALLY THE CITY HAD  
[000:25:03;26] BEEN LOCKED DOWN TO A  
[000:25:05;05] DEGREE THAT BOSTON HAS  
[000:25:07;03] NEVER EXPERIENCED IN ITS  
[000:25:08;22] LONG AND STORIC HISTORY.  
[000:25:13;12] BECAUSETONIANS RESPONDED  
[000:25:14;09] WELL ESPECIALLY THERE IN  
[000:25:15;10] WATER TOWN.  
[000:25:16;01] WE ARE GETTING BACKGROUND  
[000:25:17;05] INFORMATION OF GREAT  
[000:25:18;00] INTEREST TO ME.  
[000:25:18;18] WE HAVE JUST GOTTEN THIS  
[000:25:19;27] FROM A SOURCE AT THE FBI.  
[000:25:21;00] THIS IS FROM OUR JUSTICE  
[000:25:23;14] PRODUCER MICHAEL LAVIGNE.  
[000:25:24;23] I'M JUST GOING TO QUOTE  
[000:25:25;21] THIS FOR YOU.  
[000:25:26;17] TWO YEARS AGO AN UNNAMED  
[000:25:28;19] FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ASKED  
[000:25:29;12] THE FBI TO CHECK OUT THE  
[000:25:30;22] OLDER OF THESE TWO  
[000:25:32;11] BROTHERS.  
[000:25:32;26] THE BROTHER WHO DIED LAST  
[000:25:33;25] NIGHT IN A SHOOTOUT WITH  
[000:25:35;10] POLICE BECAUSE THAT FOREIGN  
[000:25:37;00] GOVERNMENT, NOT THE U.S.  
[000:25:38;25] GOVERNMENT, IT NOTES HERE,  
[000:25:39;28] HAD CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE  
[000:25:42;03] EXTREMIST TIES.  
[000:25:43;01] TWO YEARS AGO WITH A MAN  
[000:25:44;07] WHO DIED OVERNIGHT.  
[000:25:45;26] THE FBI FULLY SCRUBBED THIS  
[000:25:48;12] INDIVIDUAL SCRUBBED  
[000:25:49;07] MEANING THEY CHECKED OUT  
[000:25:50;04] EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM AND  
[000:25:50;28] THEN EVENTUALLY WENT --  
[000:25:53;11] ENDED UP TALKING TO HIM  
[000:25:54;16] QUOTING NOW:  WE DID NOT  
[000:25:55;24] FIND ANYTHING, THE OFFICIAL  
[000:25:57;08] SAYS.  
[000:25:57;21] THE FBI REPORTED BACK TO  
[000:25:58;18] THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT  
[000:25:59;14] IT FOUND NOTHING BUT TOLD  
[000:26:00;22] THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO  
[000:26:01;17] FOLLOW UP IF THEY HAD ANY  
[000:26:03;11] MORE CONCERNS.  
[000:26:03;29] AND THAT FOREIGN  
[000:26:05;06] GOVERNMENT, WHATEVER  
[000:26:05;26] GOVERNMENT IT IS, AND MOST  
[000:26:07;07] LIKELY WE WILL LEARN THAT  
[000:26:08;04] WITHIN THE HOURS OR DAYS  
[000:26:09;25] AHEAD, THE FOREIGN  
[000:26:10;28] GOVERNMENT NEVER FOLLOWED  
[000:26:11;22] UP, QUOTE, IN ANY WAY  
[000:26:13;11] SHAPE, OR FORM.  
[000:26:14;10] AGAIN, THAT'S FROM A SOURCE  
[000:26:15;14] CLOSE TO THE FBI.  
[000:26:17;00] FAST FORWARD NOW TO JUST A  
[000:26:18;04] FEW MINUTES BEFORE 7:00  
[000:26:19;26] TONIGHT IN WATERTOWN  
[000:26:21;12] MASSACHUSETTS WHERE SHOTS  
[000:26:22;05] RANG OUT.  
[000:26:22;22] NOW THERE IS A ROBOT GOING  
[000:26:24;15] IN IT'S OUR STANDING TO  
[000:26:25;23] CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE  
[000:26:26;28] ANY BOMBS THERE.  
[000:26:27;21] A ROBOT WITH CAMERA SO  
[000:26:29;24] AUTHORITIES ON SCENE CAN  
[000:26:30;18] LOOK AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES  
[000:26:31;27] WHETHER THIS MAN WHO IS  
[000:26:32;27] DOWN IN THE STREET IN THE  
[000:26:34;00] CITY THERE IN A RESIDENTIAL  
[000:26:35;26] NEIGHBORHOOD MAY HAVE LEFT  
[000:26:36;19] ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES  
[000:26:38;07] BEHIND.  
[000:26:38;27] AND AT SOME POINT, IN THE  
[000:26:40;13] NEAR TERM, WE EXPECT TO  
[000:26:41;22] HEAR FROM POLICE ABOUT WHAT  
[000:26:43;17] HAS JUST HAPPENED AND  
[000:26:44;17] WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE THAT  
[000:26:45;21] BOSTON AND THE UNITED  
[000:26:47;05] STATES' NIGHTMARE IS AT  
[000:26:48;08] LEAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE  
[000:26:50;00] AT LEASE -- LEAST THIS  
[000:26:52;16] STAGE OF IT.  
[000:26:54;28] WFXT FOR BOSTON HAS BEEN  
[000:26:55;27] COVERING THIS 24 HOURS A  
[000:26:57;01] DAY AND IS LIVE ON SCENE  
[000:26:58;09] NOW WITH THE FIRST  
[000:26:59;19] REPORTER, TO MY KNOWLEDGE  
[000:27:00;18] WHO WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM  
[000:27:01;21] THAT INDEED A SUSPECT WAS  
[000:27:02;22] DOWN AND SHE CITED LOCAL  
[000:27:04;08] POLICE SOURCES FOR THAT.  
[000:27:05;18] LET'S LISTEN IN.  
[000:27:06;06] >> WE NEED TO BE A NORMAL  
[000:27:07;14] CITY AGAIN.  
[000:27:08;04] EVERYBODY STARTED COMING  
[000:27:09;08] OUT.  
[000:27:09;20] YOU COULD SEE EVERYBODY  
[000:27:10;15] HANGING OUT ON THE PORCH.  
[000:27:11;12] >> HANG ON ONE SECOND.  
[000:27:12;20] >> IT'S LIKE THE FIRST  
[000:27:14;04] BREATH OF FRESH AIR THEY  
[000:27:15;09] HAVE HAD IN A WHILE.  
[000:27:16;06] WE JUST GOT RIGHT DOWN THE  
[000:27:17;10] STREET AS WE WERE STARTING  
[000:27:18;07] TO HEAD BACK.  
[000:27:18;29] WE SAW LAW ENFORCEMENT  
[000:27:19;25] STARTING TO LEAVE AND THEN  
[000:27:20;19] ALL OF THIS JUST UNFOLDED  
[000:27:22;05] SO QUICK SO FAST.  
[000:27:24;06] >> ALL RIGHT, JARED, HANG  
[000:27:24;29] ON ONE SECOND, JARED.  
[000:27:26;13] WE WANT TO REASSESS THE  
[000:27:28;02] SCENE HERE AND STAND BY ON  
[000:27:29;12] THE PHONE.  
[000:27:29;29] WE WANT TO SHOW THIS IS  
[000:27:30;29] WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE 67  
[000:27:32;15] FRANKLIN STREET AND THERE  
[000:27:33;08] WAS TALK OF SUSPECT  
[000:27:35;03] POTENTIALLY HIDING IN A  
[000:27:35;25] BOAT AND WE GET A BETTER  
[000:27:37;06] LOOK AT IT NOW AS WE PULL  
[000:27:38;20] THIS IMAGE IN CLOSER.  
[000:27:40;02] CAN YOU SEE THAT TRAILER IN  
[000:27:40;26] THE BACKYARD.  
[000:27:42;27] AGAIN, THERE WAS TALK THAT  
[000:27:44;02] POTENTIALLY THE SUSPECT WAS  
[000:27:45;02] FOUND IN THAT TRAILER.  
[000:27:47;23] GUNFIRE, 20 TO 30 SHOTS WE  
[000:27:48;28] HAVE HEARD.  
[000:27:49;17] WE BELIEVE AGAIN THIS IS 67  
[000:27:51;15] FRANKLIN STREET IN WATER  
[000:27:52;15] TOWN.  
[000:27:52;28] AND THE SUSPECT IS DOWN.  
[000:27:55;22] >> AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT  
[000:27:57;02] HIS CONNECTION IS TO THIS  
[000:27:58;21] HOUSE.  
[000:27:59;04] >> HOLD ON ONE SECOND.  
[000:28:00;07] WE ARE GETTING WORD IN  
[000:28:00;28] RIGHT NOW FROM SOURCES AS  
[000:28:02;17] WELLING.  
[000:28:04;20] -- WELL.  
[000:28:05;09] WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE  
[000:28:06;06] SUSPECT IS ALIVE SURROUNDED  
[000:28:09;19] AND STILL MOVING.  
[000:28:10;23] SO THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE  
[000:28:15;15] SURROUNDED BY LAW  
[000:28:16;14] ENFORCEMENT, BUT STILL  
[000:28:17;08] MOVING.  
[000:28:19;02] SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE  
[000:28:21;11] RIGHT NOW AT 7:28 IN THE  
[000:28:23;06] EVENING AS POLICE HAVE THIS  
[000:28:25;05] NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDED AS  
[000:28:26;14] WELL.  
[000:28:26;27] THIS IS FRANKLIN STREET IN  
[000:28:28;07] WATERTOWN.  
[000:28:28;22] WE HEARD 20 TO 30 SHOTS  
[000:28:30;18] FIRED BY EYEWITNESS  
[000:28:32;05] ESTIMATES.  
[000:28:32;20] AND WE BELIEVE THEY ARE AT  
[000:28:35;13] 67 FRANKLIN STREET.  
[000:28:36;12] SOURCES TELL US THE SUSPECT  
[000:28:37;08] IS ALIVE AND SURROUNDED.  
[000:28:39;07] STILL MOVING.  
[000:28:40;01] >> IT WAS JUST ABOUT 30  
[000:28:41;25] MINUTES AGO THAT THE  
[000:28:42;22] GOVERNOR LIFTED THE ORDER  
[000:28:43;19] TO STAY AT HOME.  
[000:28:44;19] SO SO MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT  
[000:28:46;01] TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH  
[000:28:47;24] AIR AND AS SOON AS THEY  
[000:28:49;04] WALKED OUTSIDE THEY HEARD  
[000:28:51;24] SOME 20 TO 30 GUNSHOTS  
[000:28:55;12] FIRED IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.  
[000:28:56;24] A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.  
[000:28:57;22] LOTS OF HOMES HERE AND IF  
[000:28:59;10] YOU LOOK AT THIS ARROW  
[000:29:03;08] BOAT IS THAT THEY BELIEVE A  
[000:29:04;15] SUSPECT WAS HIDING.  
[000:29:05;23] LET'S GET TO BOB WARD RIGHT  
[000:29:07;14] NOW.  
[000:29:08;25] >> HI SARAH AND MARK, AN  
[000:29:10;21] AMAZING TURN OF EVENTS

[000:29:14;12] ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE  
[000:29:15;05] GOING TO RESUME THE SEARCH  
[000:29:16;03] IN ANOTHER WAY.  
[000:29:16;28] I HEARD SHOTS FIRED.  
[000:29:18;08] AS MANY AS 30 SHOTS FIRED  
[000:29:20;06] JUST DOWN THE STREET JUST A  
[000:29:21;10] FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE  
[000:29:23;08] OUR POLICE HAVE BEEN  
[000:29:24;05] SEARCHING FOR THIS SUSPECT  
[000:29:25;23] NUMBER 2 FOR HOURS.  
[000:29:26;15] MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME  
[000:29:27;22] THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS  
[000:29:29;15] PERSON YET.  
[000:29:30;10] BUT THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE.

[000:29:34;05] I HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE  
[000:29:34;28] SAYING THAT HE IS  
[000:29:36;20] SURROUNDED.  
[000:29:37;06] THEY HAVE GOT HIM CORNERED.

[000:29:40;27] ARSENAL STREET IN  
[000:29:41;29] WATERTOWN.  
[000:29:42;14] I'M A GOOD DISTANCE AWAY  
[000:29:43;11] FROM WHERE THE EVENTS ARE  
[000:29:44;16] TAKING PLACE BUT THE POLICE  
[000:29:45;13] HAVE MOVED THE PRESS BACK  
[000:29:48;17] SUBSTANTIALLY.  
[000:29:49;04] AND WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON

[000:30:05;17] FOR THIS TO BE OVER.  
[000:30:06;25] IT APPEARS THIS MAY BE  
[000:30:08;14] RESOLVING ITSELF FINALLY  
[000:30:10;05] AFTER THE HORRIBLE BOMBINGS  
[000:30:11;18] ON MONDAY.  
[000:30:12;06] IT SEEMS THAT FRIDAY  
[000:30:14;10] EVENING THAT THINGS MAY  
[000:30:15;18] FINALLY BE COMING TO A  
[000:30:16;23] CLOSE.

[000:31:39;10] MOMENT.  
[000:31:39;24] WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM  
[000:31:40;23] STATIONED ALL OVER THE  
[000:31:42;08] AREA.  
[000:31:43;11] AS IT SO HAPPENS THEY ARE  
[000:31:44;15] THE ONES RIGHT BY THE SPOT  
[000:31:45;29] WHERE THIS WENT DOWN JUST  
[000:31:47;18] ABOUT 35 MINUTES AGO.  
[000:31:48;16] SUSPECT IS ALIVE AND  
[000:31:50;02] SURROUNDED AND BELIEVED TO  
[000:31:50;28] BE THE SECOND OF TWO KNOWN  
[000:31:53;12] SUSPECTS IN THE BOMBING AT  
[000:31:55;09] THE MARATHON HERE IN BOSTON  
[000:31:56;09] ON MONDAY.  
[000:31:57;21] OUR CORRESPONDENT MIKE  
[000:31:58;24] TOBIN IS NEARBY AND ON  
[000:32:00;10] SCENE IN WATERTOWN.  
[000:32:01;18] MIKE, IT'S MY STANDING THAT  
[000:32:02;28] THE SCENE JUST WAS OVERRUN  
[000:32:04;19] IN A MATTER OF JUST A  
[000:32:06;00] COUPLE OF MINUTES.  
[000:32:08;04] >> IT HAPPENED VERY  
[000:32:09;27] RAPIDLY.  
[000:32:10;11] AND THE SCENE WE ARE  
[000:32:11;01] TALKING ABOUT GROUND ZERO  
[000:32:11;24] IS JUST ABOUT TWO BLOCKS IN  
[000:32:13;19] THAT DIRECTION SHEP.  
[000:32:14;25] THE WAY IT ALL WENT DOWN IS  
[000:32:16;26] THAT SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER  
[000:32:18;06] WAS LIFTED.  
[000:32:19;02] AND AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS  
[000:32:20;22] LIFTED, YOU COULD HE SEE  
[000:32:21;15] THE PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE  
[000:32:22;28] STREET.  
[000:32:23;17] THE CABIN FEVER HAD GOTTEN  
[000:32:24;23] THE BEST OF THEM.  
[000:32:25;17] A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T SEEM  
[000:32:27;01] TO HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO.  
[000:32:28;05] THEY WILL WANTED TO GET OUT  
[000:32:29;00] OF HOUSE AND WALK AROUND.  
[000:32:30;16] SHORTLY AFTER THAT, WE  
[000:32:31;09] STARTED SEEING SOME OF THE  
[000:32:32;08] POLICE VEHICLES ZOOMING UP  
[000:32:33;12] IN THIS DIRECTION.  
[000:32:34;04] THAT WASN'T UNCOMMON  
[000:32:35;28] THROUGH THIS PROCESS.  
[000:32:36;20] YOU WOULD OFTEN TIMES SEE  
[000:32:38;05] THE POLICE VEHICLES ZOOM   ING  
[000:32:41;15] IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN  
[000:32:42;24] ANOTHER.  
[000:32:43;08] ONE COP CAR AND ANOTHER  
[000:32:44;12] THREE, FOUR, THEY WERE ALL  
[000:32:45;16] GOING IN THE SAME  
[000:32:46;26] DIRECTION.  
[000:32:47;11] PRETTY SOON YOU HAD THE  
[000:32:48;13] POLICE HELICOPTER OVERHEAD  
[000:32:49;13] IT BECAME APPARENT THAT  
[000:32:50;09] SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.  
[000:32:51;18] SO, AND THAT IS HOW IT ALL  
[000:32:53;02] CAME DOWN.  
[000:32:53;23] THAT'S HOW IT TRANSPIRED.  
[000:32:55;03] NOW YOU HAVE THE  
[000:32:55;25] INFORMATION THAT, AGAIN,  
[000:32:56;21] ABOUT TWO BLOCKS IN THAT  
[000:32:58;14] DIRECTION YOU HAVE SOMEONE  
[000:32:59;07] WHO IS SURROUNDED RIGHT  
[000:33:00;25] NOW, ACCORDING TO THE  
[000:33:01;16] INFORMATION WE ARE GETTING  
[000:33:02;09] FROM OUR AFFILIATE SHEP.  
[000:33:04;05] >> Shepard: ALL RIGHT.  
[000:33:04;26] MIKE TOBIN ON SCENE.  
[000:33:05;27] STAND BY IF YOU WOULD.  
[000:33:07;19] THIS IS THE EXACT SAME AREA  
[000:33:09;17] THAT WAS CORDONED OFF AND  
[000:33:11;01] LOCKED DOWN FOR THE  
[000:33:12;10] ENTIRETY OF THE DAY.  
[000:33:13;28] A 20 BLOCK AREA WHERE  
[000:33:15;00] SWATTED TEAMS AND ARMORED  
[000:33:17;21] PERSONNEL -- ARMORED --  
[000:33:18;21] BODY ARMORED PEOPLE,

[000:33:28;13] LIVE LOCAL COVERAGE TO YOU.  
[000:33:30;28] >> 35 MINUTES AGO ON THE

[000:33:33;09] GUNFIRE LAST NIGHT RESULTED  
[000:33:34;06] IN THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE  
[000:33:35;16] SUSPECTS.  
[000:33:36;01] TONIGHT WE'RE TOLD THAT A  
[000:33:38;02] SUSPECT IS DOWN BUT THAT  
[000:33:39;02] SUSPECT IS STILL ALIVE AND  
[000:33:40;19] SURROUNDED AT THIS HOUR.  
[000:33:41;11] WE BELIEVE IT TO BE 67  
[000:33:43;00] FRANKLIN STREET IN  
[000:33:45;26] WATERTOWN.  
[000:33:46;11] THEY HAVE THE BOMB SQUAD ON  
[000:33:47;07] HAND AS WELL.  
[000:33:48;04] VERY FLUID SITUATION AS YOU  
[000:33:49;18] CAN IMAGINE.  
[000:33:51;20] IT APPEARS PROGRESS  
[000:33:52;25] SOMETHING MADE WE'RE TOLD  
[000:33:53;23] FROM THE SCENE.  
[000:33:54;21] PROGRESS BEING MADE TO  
[000:33:56;03] APPREHEND THE SUSPECT.  
[000:33:57;10] AGAIN, WE ARE VERY  
[000:33:58;13] INTERESTED TO KNOW WHO THIS  
[000:33:59;13] SUSPECT IS.  
[000:34:00;07] IS IT, IN FACT, SUSPECT  
[000:34:02;12] NUMBER 2 FROM THE BOSTON  
[000:34:03;09] MARATHON BOMBINGS?  
[000:34:04;17] >> A LOT OF RESIDENTS  
[000:34:06;04] COMING OUT OF THEIR HOUSE  
[000:34:06;28] TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH  
[000:34:08;16] AIR AFTER THE GOVERNOR  
[000:34:09;14] LIFTED THAT STAY-AT-HOME  
[000:34:11;24] BAN.  
[000:34:12;06] THEY CAME OUT TO HEAR THE  
[000:34:13;15] GUNSHOTS FIRED.  
[000:34:14;22] SOME 20 TO 30 GUNSHOTS.  
[000:34:16;18] THE SOUNDS REMINISCENT WHEN  
[000:34:18;28] WE HEARD EARLIER THIS  
[000:34:20;15] MORNING GUN BATTLE WITH 200  
[000:34:22;08] GUNSHOTS FIRED AND THE  
[000:34:23;03] DEATH OF SUSPECT NUMBER 1.  
[000:34:24;11] RIGHT NOW WE KNOW SUSPECT  
[000:34:25;22] NUMBER 2 IS ALIVE.  
[000:34:27;08] HE IS SURROUNDED.  
[000:34:28;11] HE IS STILL MOVING.  
[000:34:31;08] WE KNOW HE WAS POSSIBLY  
[000:34:32;07] HIDING IN A BOAT AT 67  
[000:34:34;05] FRANKLIN STREET AND WE KNOW  
[000:34:35;09] THERE IS A BIG POLICE  
[000:34:38;01] PRESENCE.  
[000:34:38;16] EVERYONE HAS MOVED FROM  
[000:34:39;09] THEIR OTHER SCENES TO THIS  
[000:34:41;01] SCENE AND WHAT A SCENE FOR  
[000:34:42;13] THE NEIGHBORS OF FRANK LIB  
[000:34:44;13] STREET HERE IN WATERTOWN.  
[000:34:46;06] >> CERTAIN SOLID A MAJOR  
[000:34:47;07] SCENE AS THE DEVELOPMENTS  
[000:34:48;29] DEVELOPING RAPIDLY HERE  
[000:34:49;27] RIGHT NOW AS WE HAVE LAW  
[000:34:51;15] ENFORCEMENT FROM ALL OVER  
[000:34:53;21] DESCENDING ON THIS  
[000:34:54;11] NEIGHBORHOOD IN WATER TOWN.  
[000:34:55;27] WE TALKED WITH WITH MARY  
[000:34:57;28] SULLIVAN AN EYEWITNESS WHO  
[000:34:58;24] SAID SHE WAS GETTING OUT  
[000:35:00;14] BECAUSE THE LOCKDOWN HAD  
[000:35:01;17] BEEN LIFTED AND SHE WENT  
[000:35:02;28] OUT AND WAS GOING TO TAKE  
[000:35:04;09] THING TO FOR A WALK AS THEY  
[000:35:05;25] OFTEN DO AND SUDDENLY HEARD  
[000:35:07;15] THE GUNFIRE AND KNEW THINGS  
[000:35:09;29] WERE NOT NORMAL.  
[000:35:11;05] AND TOAD IT WHEN SHE SAW  
[000:35:13;15] THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RACING  
[000:35:14;19] THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD  
[000:35:15;11] AND EVENTUALLY DOWN TO THIS  
[000:35:17;10] LOCATION RIGHT HERE WHERE  
[000:35:18;03] WE ARE TOLD THROUGH SOURCES  
[000:35:20;17] AT 67 FRANKLIN STREET THAT  
[000:35:21;25] THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS  
[000:35:23;07] PERSON IN CUSTODY YET.  
[000:35:24;11] THEY DO HAVE HIM CORNERED.  
[000:35:26;13] AND RIGHT NOW BASICALLY  
[000:35:28;03] WHAT YOU HAVE IS A  
[000:35:30;01] STANDOFF.  
[000:35:30;16] DON'T FORGET THERE IS THE  
[000:35:31;09] AMBULANCE BEING BACKED UP  
[000:35:32;07] RIGHT HERE.  
[000:35:32;23] WE SAW THAT EARLY ON WHICH  
[000:35:34;20] GAVE US A THOUGHT THAT  
[000:35:36;10] POTENTIALLY SOMEONE HAD  
[000:35:37;02] BEEN WOUNDED.  
[000:35:37;20] RIGHT NOW THOUGH WE DON'T  
[000:35:39;11] HAVE THAT VERIFIED BUT  
[000:35:41;19] CERTAINLY HAVE IT ON HAND  
[000:35:43;22] AND HAVE IT AT THE READY  
[000:35:45;23] RIGHT NOW THEY WILL STAY  
[000:35:46;20] IT'S A STANDOFF BETWEEN  
[000:35:47;26] AUTHORITIES AND THE SUSPECT  
[000:35:48;29] THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE  
[000:35:50;27] HIDING IN A BOAT.  
[000:35:51;17] >> WE KNOW WHAT THE SUSPECT  
[000:35:53;12] IS CAPABLE OF IN TERMS OF A  
[000:35:55;09] BOMBS.  
[000:35:55;22] WEAVE KNOW THEY HAVE A  
[000:35:57;04] ROBOT GOING INTO THIS BOAT  
[000:35:58;19] ON THE TRAILER TO CHECK IT  
[000:36:00;11] OUT IN THE BACKYARD TO MAKE  
[000:36:01;16] SURE THERE ARE NO  
[000:36:03;08] EXPLOSIVES.  
[000:36:04;03] WE KNOW TODAY THEY FOUND A  
[000:36:05;25] PRESSURE COOK ERM BOMB AS  
[000:36:07;27] WELL AS OTHER PIPE BOMBS IN  
[000:36:09;28] THE STREET NEAR THEIR HOME  
[000:36:11;02] OF CAMBRIDGE:  SO THEY ARE  
[000:36:14;11] BEING AS CAUTIOUS AND  
[000:36:15;11] CAREFUL AS THEY POSSIBLY  
[000:36:16;12] CAN TO KEEP THE NEIGHBORS  
[000:36:17;11] IN THIS RESIDENTIAL AREA  
[000:36:19;05] SAFE.  
[000:36:19;18] >> IT'S BEEN A LONG WAIT  
[000:36:21;24] OBVIOUSLY FOR A LOT OF  
[000:36:23;03] PEOPLE ON N. WASHINGTON.  
[000:36:24;18] BEEN ON EDGE FOR A WHILE.

[000:36:36;08] A LOT OF ACTIVITY OUT  
[000:36:37;15] THERE.  
[000:36:37;28] WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE  
[000:36:38;20] AMBULANCE MOVE YET.  
[000:36:39;10] IT HAS BEEN STATIONARY  
[000:36:40;11] SINCE IT GOT THERE.  
[000:36:41;05] A VERY QUIET CROWD RIGHT  
[000:36:42;26] NOW.  
[000:36:43;09] EVERYBODY IS WONDERING  
[000:36:44;00] WHAT'S GOING ON.

[000:36:48;00] HERE ON SCENE AND HE WAS  
[000:36:49;16] RIGHT THERE RUNNING RIGHT  
[000:36:51;08] AHEAD OF US TOWARD THE  
[000:36:53;03] ACTIVITY.  
[000:36:53;18] AND, PAUL, WHAT DID YOU  
[000:36:55;08] HEAR?  
[000:36:55;21] >> I HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.  
[000:36:58;22] I FIRST WHAT I HEARD OR SAW  
[000:37:00;05] WAS I PULLED OVER AND THE  
[000:37:01;27] SWAT TEAM HAD GONE BY ME.  
[000:37:04;01] THREE TRUCKS WENT BY AND I  
[000:37:06;28] SAID SOMETHING IS GOING ON  
[000:37:08;25] TO JANEL.  
[000:37:10;24] I SAID RAPID GUNFIRE OVER  
[000:37:12;19] AND OVER BOOM BOOM BOOM  
[000:37:13;29] BOOM BOOM.  
[000:37:14;23] I WAS TALKING WITH FRED I  
[000:37:16;03] SAID THIS IS GOING DOWN  
[000:37:17;04] RIGHT NOW.  
[000:37:17;22] THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT  
[000:37:18;23] NOW.  
[000:37:19;05] I WAS PRETTY SURE OF IT.  
[000:37:20;05] I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS  
[000:37:20;28] GOING ON.  
[000:37:22;06] SOMEBODY IS BEING SHOT AT  
[000:37:23;22] IT AND WE KEPT FOLLOWING  
[000:37:29;02] THE.  
[000:37:29;14] WE COULDN'T GO ON FRANKLY.  
[000:37:30;15] WE SLOWED DOWN.  
[000:37:31;27] SWAT TEAM PEOPLE GET OUT  
[000:37:33;08] AND THEY ALL DISPERSE RIGHT  
[000:37:35;09] OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.  
[000:37:36;14] LAY DOWN IN -- I DIDN'T SEE  
[000:37:38;02] ANYBODY GOING BACK.  
[000:37:38;27] MY STANDING WAS THAT IT WAS  
[000:37:40;05] IN A BOAT.  
[000:37:43;02] AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE  
[000:37:44;19] TO DEFINE IT BUT YOU COULD  
[000:37:45;27] JUST TELL SOMETHING BIG WAS  
[000:37:47;27] HAPPENING.  
[000:37:48;12] SOMETHING REALLY BIG.  
[000:37:49;04] ALL OF A SUDDEN CARS CAME  
[000:37:50;03] FROM EVERYWHERE.  
[000:37:50;21] >> THEY ARE SAYING THAT ONE  
[000:37:51;17] OF THE SUSPECTS IS LIKELY  
[000:37:53;10] ONE OF THE SUSPECTS HERE IN  
[000:37:54;25] THIS WHOLE THING IS DOWN.  
[000:37:56;29] SO WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON  
[000:37:58;06] ALL OF THIS AS IT IS  
[000:37:59;21] STARTING TO SINK IN.  
[000:38:00;26] >> IT'S THE FEELING OF  
[000:38:02;25] RELIEF BECAUSE I'M  
[000:38:06;21] WATERTOWN RESIDENT AND MOST  
[000:38:07;15] OF THE DAY I WAS COOKED UP  
[000:38:08;28] AND I LEFT THE HOUSE.  
[000:38:10;12] I WENT UP AND ALL THE ALL  
[000:38:13;14] OF A SUDDEN THEY WAYMAN  
[000:38:15;11] BACK.  
[000:38:15;24] WE WILL TAKE A RIDE TO SEE  
[000:38:16;27] IF WE CAN GET CLOSE TO  
[000:38:19;01] DECKS E. AVENUE THAT WASN'T  
[000:38:20;22] POSSIBLE.  
[000:38:21;07] WE TOOK A RIGHT.  
[000:38:22;11] WHATEVER IT IS WE WERE  
[000:38:24;01] REACHING WHEN ALL THE  
[000:38:25;25] GUN --  
[000:38:26;08] >> JARED, CAN YOU HOLD ON  
[000:38:27;06] ONE SECOND PLEASE?  
[000:38:28;11] JARED?  
[000:38:30;00] >> WHAT THEY HAD TO DO.  
[000:38:31;09] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
[000:38:32;01] >> JARED, THANK YOU.  
[000:38:33;14] JARED, I'M JUST GOING TO  
[000:38:34;22] TELL TO YOU STAY ON HOLD.  
[000:38:35;21] WE HAVE, UNDERSTAND THAT  
[000:38:37;03] THE SUSPECT IS IN THE BOAT.  
[000:38:39;18] HE IS INDEED IN THE BOAT.  
[000:38:40;26] AGAIN, LOOK AT THE TRAILER  
[000:38:41;23] BACK HERE AT 67 FRANKLIN  
[000:38:44;07] STREET.  
[000:38:44;26] APPARENTLY HE IS IN THE  
[000:38:45;18] BOAT AND REFUSING TO COME  
[000:38:47;05] OUT.  
[000:38:47;17] HE IS SURROUNDED BY LAW  
[000:38:48;15] ENFORCEMENT IN THE  
[000:38:49;21] BACKYARD.  
[000:38:50;23] IT'S 67 FRANKLIN STREET IN  
[000:38:51;19] WATER TOWN.  
[000:38:52;06] HE IS IN THERE.  
[000:38:53;05] HE IS ALIVE BUT IS HE  
[000:38:54;15] REFUSING TO COME OUT.  
[000:38:55;16] SO THERE IS A NEGOTIATION  
[000:38:56;18] PERIOD GOING ON RIGHT NOW  
[000:39:02;25] THIS A STANDOFF, THIS WOULD  
[000:39:06;04] OBVIOUSLY BE SUSPECT NUMBER  
[000:39:07;07] 2.  
[000:39:07;18] WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT AS OF  
[000:39:09;00] YET.  
[000:39:09;12] THE FACT IS THAT HE IS HOLD  
[000:39:10;06] UP IN A BOAT IN A BACKYARD  
[000:39:12;00] IS ALIVE AND IS REFUSING TO

[000:42:52;11] POLICE WERE TOLD HAVE  
[000:42:53;08] SURROUNDED THIS BOAT IT IS  
[000:42:54;06] THE BELIEF OF ALL INVOLVED  
[000:42:55;20] THAT THIS IS THE SUSPECT.  
[000:42:56;24] THE SECOND SUSPECT IN THE  
[000:42:57;29] BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING  
[000:43:00;19] THAT HAPPENED MONDAY  
[000:43:04;07] AFTERNOON BEFORE 3:00.  
[000:43:05;19] NOW ANOTHER STANDOFF AFTER  
[000:43:07;09] ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE NIGHT  
[000:43:08;10] IN WATER TOWN WHEN THESE  
[000:43:10;08] TWO SUSPECTS REPORTEDLY IN  
[000:43:13;00] A STOLEN OR CAR JACKED CAR  
[000:43:14;15] AS POLICE ARE CHASING THEM  
[000:43:15;16] AND A GUN FIGHT IS ONGOING.  
[000:43:17;23] THE OLDER OF THESE TWO  
[000:43:19;08] BROTHERS, IT'S OUR STANDING  
[000:43:20;07] IS SAID TO HAVE THROWN ONE  
[000:43:24;23] OF THESE PRESSURE COOKER  
[000:43:26;26] BOMBS OUTS AND TOWARD  
[000:43:28;03] POLICE.  
[000:43:28;27] INSTEAD OF THE LID LOCK  
[000:43:31;00] SOLID, THAT LID CAME OFF  
[000:43:32;03] BEFORE IT WAS ABLE TO  
[000:43:33;13] EXPLODE.  
[000:43:33;27] IT DID LESS DAMAGE THAN IT  
[000:43:35;09] OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE.  
[000:43:36;04] IT'S FURTHER OUR STANDING  
[000:43:37;22] THAT THERE WAS LARGE NUMBER  
[000:43:38;29] OF POLICE OFFICERS AROUND  
[000:43:39;22] THIS AREA.  
[000:43:40;14] AND HAD THAT BOMB WORKED  
[000:43:42;10] PROPERLY, THIS STORY WOULD  
[000:43:43;07] HAVE TAKEN ITSELF TO AN  
[000:43:44;23] ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL.  
[000:43:46;00] THANKFULLY, IN THIS CASE,  
[000:43:47;02] THAT DIDN'T WORK.  
[000:43:50;09] WE'RE TOLD THEY HAD  
[000:43:51;26] IMPROVISED GRENADES AS WELL  
[000:43:53;04] AND HURLED THOSE TOWARDS  
[000:43:54;16] THE VEHICLE.  
[000:43:55;20] STANDOFF ENDED AND THE CAR  
[000:43:56;23] CAME TO A STOP.  
[000:43:57;22] THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT THE  
[000:43:59;00] OLDER OF THE PRO BROTHERS  
[000:44:00;08] DIED IN WHAT WE ARE LED TO  
[000:44:01;21] BELIEVE WAS A SHOOTOUT WITH  
[000:44:03;07] POLICE.  
[000:44:03;21] AND THIS YOUNGER SUSPECT  
[000:44:04;25] TOOK OFF ON FOOT.  
[000:44:07;01] IT'S THE DARK OF NIGHT.  
[000:44:08;25] THE WATER TOWN POLICE WILL  
[000:44:10;07] TELL YOU AND THEY DID TO  
[000:44:11;17] THE WORLD TODAY.  
[000:44:12;11] WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH  
[000:44:14;02] MANPOWER TO LOCKDOWN THIS  
[000:44:16;05] NEIGHBORHOOD.  
[000:44:16;22] OR THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY  
[000:44:17;20] DID.  
[000:44:18;02] BECAUSE THEY WENT  
[000:44:20;15] DOOR-TO-DOOR, THEY TELL US  
[000:44:21;16] EVERY HOUSE IN WATER TOWN  
[000:44:22;15] FOR A 20 SQUARE BLOCK  
[000:44:26;01] RADIUS SEARCHED THE ATTIC.  
[000:44:28;08] EVERY FRONT PORCH HAS AN  
[000:44:29;16] AREA UNDERNEATH IT AND  
[000:44:30;28] THERE IS A -- PLENTY OF  
[000:44:32;10] PLACES WHO HIDE THE WAY  
[000:44:33;20] CONSTRUCTION IS DONE IN  
[000:44:34;19] WATER TOWN BUT THEY  
[000:44:35;15] SEARCHED IT ALL AND  
[000:44:36;11] COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.  
[000:44:37;06] THEY SEARCHED THIS BOAT IN  
[000:44:38;01] THE BACK OF THIS HOME AT 57  
[000:44:40;13] FRANKLIN STREET AS WELL.  
[000:44:41;12] AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS  
[000:44:42;15] NOTHING THERE.  
[000:44:43;28] BUT, THE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN  
[000:44:45;04] THAT HOUSE ACCORDING TO THE  
[000:44:46;15] MOST RECENT REPORTS CALLED  
[000:44:47;08] UP THE POLICE AND GOES,  
[000:44:48;20] HEY, YOU SEARCHED HERE BUT  
[000:44:49;17] IT LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW.  
[000:44:51;01] THERE IS A DOOR TO THE SHED  
[000:44:52;09] OPEN.  
[000:44:52;22] SHE WENT OUT AND LOOKED,

[000:44:54;26] INSIDE THE SHED SHE  
[000:44:56;04] REPORTED TO POLICE.  
[000:44:56;24] AND THERE WAS BLOOD ON THE  
[000:44:58;20] FLOOR.  
[000:44:59;03] SO POLICE CAME BACK.  
[000:45:00;07] AND IT'S OUR STANDING THAT  
[000:45:01;14] THEY SEARCHED THE AREA.  
[000:45:02;17] THERE IS SOME REPORTS NOW  
[000:45:03;22] THAT THEY MAY HAVE ACTUALLY  
[000:45:04;17] FOUND THE GUY INSIDE THIS  
[000:45:05;26] BOAT WITH THE TARP OVER IT  
[000:45:06;27] BY USING IMAGES FROM A  
[000:45:09;03] HELICOPTER.  
[000:45:09;19] BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT.  
[000:45:11;00] OUR LOCAL RADIO STATION IS  
[000:45:12;13] REPORTING THAT AT ANY RATE,  
[000:45:13;08] WE ARE PRETTY COMFORTABLE  
[000:45:14;20] AT THIS POINT WITH THE  
[000:45:15;11] REPORTING OF WFXT FOX 25 IN  
[000:45:19;08] BOSTON.  
[000:45:19;22] THE BOAT IS SURROUNDED,  
[000:45:20;27] THIS GUY IS INSIDE IT IS HE  
[000:45:22;27] BLEEDING?  
[000:45:23;12] WE DON'T KNOW.  
[000:45:23;29] HE IS NOT COMING OUT AT  
[000:45:25;02] THIS MOMENT.  
[000:45:25;29] WE HAVE CORRESPONDENTS AND  
[000:45:27;11] CREWS ON SCENE FOX 25 LIVE  
[000:45:30;29] TO YOU ACROSS THE NATION.  
[000:45:32;08] >> BOTTOM LINE IS THEY WANT  
[000:45:33;07] TO GET HIM AS YOU SAID,  
[000:45:34;12] THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM  
[000:45:35;20] ALIVE.  
[000:45:36;03] >> IT IS A VERY TENSE  
[000:45:37;14] SITUATION RIGHT NOW OUTSIDE  
[000:45:39;13] 67 FRANKLIN STREET WHERE  
[000:45:40;11] THERE IS A STANDOFF WITH  
[000:45:42;02] THE SUSPECT NUMBER 2 HIDING  
[000:45:45;15] IN THAT BOAT.  
[000:45:46;06] WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE  
[000:45:47;11] HAS BEEN IN THAT BOAT IF  
[000:45:48;11] IT'S BEEN ALL DAY SINCE  
[000:45:49;22] THIS MORNING WHEN HE  
[000:45:51;12] ESCAPED THE GUN FIGHT.  
[000:45:52;11] WE DON'T KNOW IF HE IS  
[000:45:53;27] INJURED IN THAT BOAT BUT WE  
[000:45:55;07] DO KNOW HE IS ALIVE.  
[000:45:57;00] IS HE SURROUNDED BY A  
[000:45:57;23] NUMBER OF AUTHORITIES, BUT  
[000:45:58;17] HE DOES NOT WANT TO COME  
[000:45:59;25] OUT.  
[000:46:02;15] >> BOB WARD, GO AHEAD.  
[000:46:09;08] >>  
[000:46:11;13] >> WE'RE IN A PARKING LOT.  
[000:46:12;12] >> BOB, I'M SORRY WE CAN'T  
[000:46:13;26] HEAR YOU AND WE DO WANT TO  
[000:46:15;11] UPDATE PEOPLE ON THE  
[000:46:16;14] LATEST.  
[000:46:16;28] I UNDERSTAND NOW SOURCES  
[000:46:17;20] TELLING US THAT THE ROBOT  
[000:46:18;19] IS INDEED HEADED INTO THAT  
[000:46:20;00] AREA WHERE THE BOAT IS  
[000:46:23;25] RIGHT NOW.  
[000:46:24;22] SWAT TEAM PULLED BACK.  
[000:46:26;18] THE INDIVIDUAL KNOWS THEY  
[000:46:27;11] ARE SURROUNDED.  
[000:46:29;23] SENDING IN A BOMB ROBOT AND  
[000:46:31;06] SEE THE IMAGES.  
[000:46:32;02] I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE A  
[000:46:33;10] CAMERA ON THERE.  
[000:46:34;16] TAKE A LOOK AROUND.  
[000:46:35;27] OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT PUTTING A  
[000:46:37;07] HUMAN LIFE IN HARM'S WAY.  
[000:46:38;23] >> THIS IS SO IMPORTANT  
[000:46:39;29] MARK, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT  
[000:46:42;08] THIS SUSPECT LIKED BOMBS.  
[000:46:45;13] WE KNOW THE PRESSURE COOKER  
[000:46:47;11] BOMBS THAT WERE USED IN THE  
[000:46:48;19] BOSTON MARATHON.  
[000:46:49;15] PRESSURE COOKER BOMB WAS  
[000:46:50;27] FOUND TODAY IN CAMBRIDGE.  
[000:46:52;05] WE KNOW PIPE BOMBS WERE  
[000:46:53;09] FOUND TODAY IN CAMBRIDGE.  
[000:46:54;19] AND WE KNOW THAT PIPE BOMBS  
[000:46:56;03] WERE FOUND ON COMMONWEALTH  
[000:46:58;03] AVENUE IN BOSTON AS WELL SO  
[000:47:00;26] THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND  
[000:47:03;09] DELICATE SITUATION.  
[000:47:04;00] THEY WANT TO BRING THIS  
[000:47:05;05] ROBOT IN TO THE BOAT TO  
[000:47:06;06] MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO  
[000:47:08;03] EXPLOSIVES.  
[000:47:08;19] HE THEY WANT TO KEEP THIS  
[000:47:09;17] SUSPECT NUMBER 2 ALIVE.  
[000:47:11;10] HE HAS IMPORTANT  
[000:47:12;22] INFORMATION THAT  
[000:47:13;11] AUTHORITIES NEED AS THEY  
[000:47:14;25] CONTINUE THIS  
[000:47:15;12] INVESTIGATION.  
[000:47:16;24] THEY DON'T WANT TO DO  
[000:47:17;25] ANYTHING THAT WOULD  
[000:47:18;27] NECESSITATE HIM POTENTIALLY  
[000:47:19;22] TAKING HIS OWN LIFE IN THIS  
[000:47:22;00] SITUATION.  
[000:47:22;15] HE IS FROM A DIRE SITUATION  
[000:47:23;09] AT THIS POINT.  
[000:47:23;26] IS HE TOTALLY SURROUNDED.  
[000:47:25;15] AS BOB WARD SAID HIS  
[000:47:26;19] SOURCES TELL HIM THIS GUY  
[000:47:28;13] HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE TO  
[000:47:29;13] GO AT THIS POINT.  
[000:47:30;02] YOU THINK ABOUT THE DRAGNET  
[000:47:31;14] THEY CAST SO WIDE ALL THE  
[000:47:32;21] COMMUNITIES AROUND BOSTON,  
[000:47:33;14] BOSTON IN LOCKDOWN, SEVERAL  
[000:47:34;24] OTHER COMMUNITIES AROUND  
[000:47:35;16] THE WATER TOWN AREAS.  
[000:47:36;24] CITIES AND TOWNS LOCKED  
[000:47:37;26] DOWN ALL DAY.  
[000:47:38;21] NOW IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.  
[000:47:40;00] A BACKYARD, 67 FRANKLIN  
[000:47:41;27] STREET IN WATER TOWN.  
[000:47:42;28] A BOAT, INSIDE THE BOAT THE  
[000:47:48;02] SUSPECT.  
[000:47:48;16] >> IT IS POSSIBLE, MARK,  
[000:47:49;19] THAT THIS SUSPECT --  
[000:47:51;01] SUSPECT NUMBER 2 IS INJURED  
[000:47:52;24] FROM THIS MORNING'S GUN  
[000:47:54;09] BATTLE, DURING THAT GUN  
[000:47:55;10] BATTLE THERE WERE SOME 200  
[000:47:59;02] SHOTS FIRED.  
[000:48:00;18] HIS BROTHER DIED DURING  
[000:48:01;13] THAT GUN BATTLE.  
[000:48:02;12] IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT HE  
[000:48:04;05] TOO HAS AN INJURY AGAIN  
[000:48:08;14] THIS WAS 67 FRANKLIN STREET  
[000:48:10;02] IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US  
[000:48:11;18] IN WATER TOWN WHERE SUSPECT  
[000:48:15;11] NUMBER 2 FROM THE BOSTON

[000:48:18;17] THAT YOU SEE RIGHT THERE  
[000:48:19;23] WITH THE TARP UNDER HIM.  
[000:48:20;29] HE HAS BEEN HIDING THERE.  
[000:48:21;26] WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE  
[000:48:23;04] HAS BEEN HIDING THERE FOR.  
[000:48:25;08] BUT HE IS SURROUNDED.  
[000:48:27;00] THIS IS STANDOFF AND YOU

[000:48:43;00] WALKING THIS WAY OR OTHER  
[000:48:44;29] WAY.  
[000:48:45;11] THEY ARE OUT OF THEIR

[000:48:46;26] OF WATERTOWN RIGHT NOW.

[000:48:49;26] THE SUSPECT CONSIDERED  
[000:48:50;20] INSIDE THIS BOAT ACCORDING

[000:52:09;04] EXPLOSIONS ARE ARE  
[000:52:10;05] HAPPENING.  
[000:52:10;20] WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SWAT  
[000:52:12;16] TEAM WAS SENDING IN SOME  
[000:52:13;26] KIND OF A ROBOTIC DEVICE TO  
[000:52:15;29] THAT AREA.  
[000:52:19;11] THERE IS NO WARNING THAT  
[000:52:20;07] THEY WERE GOING TO TRY  
[000:52:22;01] TO -- THERE IS IS NO  
[000:52:22;21] WARNING THAT THEY WERE  
[000:52:25;14] GOING -- WE KNOW THAT WE

[000:52:28;17] EXPLOSIONS OUT HERE IN THE  
[000:52:29;18] AREA WHERE SUSPECT NUMBER 2  
[000:52:32;29] TRAPPED.  
[000:52:33;13] >> THEY SEEM TO BE COMING  
[000:52:34;10] IN THE BACKYARD OF THAT  
[000:52:35;14] HOME AT 67 FRANKLIN STREET?  
[000:52:37;17] >> SARAH, I CAN'T TELL.  
[000:52:42;03] [AUDIO BREAKING UP]  
[000:52:49;22] SUSPECT NUMBER 2 IS  
[000:52:50;29] SURROUNDED.  
[000:52:51;15] >> AGAIN, THE SUSPECT  
[000:52:52;15] COMPLETELY SURROUNDED AND  
[000:52:53;13] NOW LATE WORD THAT ARE AS  
[000:52:55;19] MANY AS 8 TO 10 BLASTS AND  
[000:52:59;06] JUST HEARD TWO MORE.  
[000:53:00;08] WE ARE SEEING FLASHES IN  
[000:53:01;21] LIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE  
[000:53:03;06] STROBE LIGHTS COMING FROM  
[000:53:03;29] THE VEHICLE.  
[000:53:04;18] EVERY SO OFTEN WE HAVE SEEN  
[000:53:06;18] A COUPLE OF BRIGHT WHITE  
[000:53:08;14] FLASHES.  
[000:53:08;28] NOT SURE IF THOSE ARE  
[000:53:10;17] RELATED.  
[000:53:11;01] BOB SAID THERE HAS BEEN 8  
[000:53:12;15] TO 10 EXPLOSIONS THAT HE  
[000:53:13;17] HAS HEARD.  
[000:53:14;07] AND THIS ALL HAPPENING IN  
[000:53:15;03] THE BACKYARD AT 67 FRANKLIN  
[000:53:16;25] STREET WHERE WE BELIEVE  
[000:53:18;00] SUSPECT 2 IS HOLD UP IN  
[000:53:18;25] THIS BOAT THAT YOU SEE ON  
[000:53:19;28] THE RIGHT PICTURE HERE IN  
[000:53:21;03] THE ARROW WITH THE TARP ON  
[000:53:22;07] IT THAT HE HID IN THERE.  
[000:53:24;07] SWAT TEAM SURROUNDED HIM.  
[000:53:28;02] HAD HIM SURROUNDED.  
[000:53:31;25] BASH TAKE A LOOK AROUND  
[000:53:32;22] BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY  
[000:53:33;13] CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT  
[000:53:34;17] THAT THERE COULD BE  
[000:53:35;15] EXPLOSIVES THERE AS WELL.  
[000:53:37;04] ONCE THAT ROBOTIC DEVICE  
[000:53:38;11] WENT IN, WE UNDERSTAND THAT  
[000:53:40;02] POTENTIALLY THAT IS WHEN WE  
[000:53:41;19] STARTED TO HEAR SOME OF THE  
[000:53:43;14] EXPLOSIONS.  
[000:53:44;00] >> THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:53:44;18] BOB WARD SAID HE HEARD SOME  
[000:53:46;04] 8 TO 10 EXPLOSIONS IN THAT  
[000:53:51;10] AREA POSSIBLY COMING FROM  
[000:53:52;03] THE BACKYARD WHERE THAT  
[000:53:52;28] SUSPECT IS HOLD UP IN A  
[000:53:53;28] BOAT THAT YOU SEE RIGHT  
[000:53:55;12] THERE.  
[000:53:55;25] IT IS NIGHT FALL RIGHT NOW.  
[000:53:56;19] AND IT'S AMAZING HOW THIS  
[000:53:58;05] STORY HAS CHANGED IN A  
[000:53:59;29] MATTER OF SECONDS MARK.  
[000:54:01;27] >> IT CERTAINLY IS.  
[000:54:03;03] THIS WAS ALL DAY PRESENCE.  
[000:54:05;10] >> THE POLICE IN WATERTOWN  
[000:54:08;05] OUGHT NIGHT.  
[000:54:08;21] THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FROM  
[000:54:09;17] THE TIME THAT THE CAR CHASE  
[000:54:11;03] ENDED UP IN WATERTOWN.  
[000:54:12;18] WE HAD SHOOTOUT, A FIRE  
[000:54:13;29] FIGHT LAST NIGHT WITH  
[000:54:14;27] POLICE RESULTING IN SUSPECT  
[000:54:18;09] NUMBER 1' DEMISE AS IT  
[000:54:19;15] TURNED OUT AS HE WAS GUNNED  
[000:54:21;03] DOWN.  
[000:54:21;16] THEN WE ALSO HAD THE FOOT  
[000:54:22;10] CHASE THAT ENSUED FOR THIS  
[000:54:24;00] INDIVIDUAL HERE IT APPEARS.  
[000:54:25;08] THIS WOULD BE SUSPECT  
[000:54:26;01] NUMBER 2.  
[000:54:26;21] THROUGHOUT THE DAY  
[000:54:27;21] WATERTOWN WAS IN LOCKDOWN  
[000:54:28;23] AS WERE ALL THE COMMUNITIES  
[000:54:30;04] AROUND IT AS WAS THE CITY  
[000:54:31;12] OF BOSTON.  
[000:54:32;12] AS NIGHT.  
[000:54:33;17] >> Shepard: WE ARE  
[000:54:34;08] LISTENING TO WFXT IN BOSTON  
[000:54:37;06] LIVE COVERAGE OF DEVELOPING  
[000:54:38;06] STORY IN WATERTOWN.  
[000:54:39;06] IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THE  
[000:54:40;11] SUSPECT THERE IN THE BOSTON  
[000:54:43;05] MARATHON BOMBING WAS  
[000:54:45;23] UNDERNEATH THIS BOAT TARP  
[000:54:47;14] AND NOW THERE ARE REPORTS  
[000:54:48;13] OF ALL OF THESE EXPLOSIONS  
[000:54:51;01] AND THE EXPLOSIONS, THOUGH  
[000:54:52;16] THEY ARE BEING REPORTED BY  
[000:54:54;21] THE LOCAL REPORTER AS A  
[000:54:55;19] SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS, IT'S  
[000:54:57;03] POSSIBLE THAT WHEN THEY  
[000:54:57;25] SENT THIS ROBOT IN TO DO  
[000:54:59;27] THE EXPLORATION OF THE  
[000:55:01;03] AREA, TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEOS  
[000:55:02;13] AND THE REST, THEY COULD  
[000:55:04;02] HAVE SET OFF A FLASH BANG  
[000:55:05;20] IN THERE.  
[000:55:06;17] IF YOU REMEMBER THE  
[000:55:07;11] SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN  
[000:55:08;29] CALIFORNIA WHEN THE MAN WAS  
[000:55:11;08] GOING TO -- HE WAS SHOOTING  
[000:55:12;15] A BUNCH OF COPS OUT THERE.  
[000:55:13;29] AND AUTHORITIES SET OFF  
[000:55:14;28] FLASH BANGS INSIDE THE  
[000:55:16;07] BUILDING TO TRY AND RESCUE  
[000:55:18;01] THE HOSTAGE SHOWS FLASH  
[000:55:19;27] BANGS ENDED UP SETTING THE  
[000:55:21;03] HOUSE ON FIRE, REMEMBER?  
[000:55:22;07] IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT'S  
[000:55:23;10] THE SAME THING THAT'S GOING  
[000:55:24;13] ON NOW.  
[000:55:25;06] IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS  
[000:55:28;02] ISN'T AN ESCALATION BUT  
[000:55:29;10] PART OF THE ONGOING  
[000:55:30;16] PROCESS.  
[000:55:31;00] WE HAVE NOTHING TO INDICATE  
[000:55:32;19] ANY FURTHER HAVE BEEN  
[000:55:33;22] INJURED THERE AT LEAST AT  
[000:55:35;03] THIS MOMENT.  
[000:55:35;19] SO WE DON'T GET AHEAD OF  
[000:55:37;26] OURSELVES IN THE REPORTING  
[000:55:39;12] WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT IS  
[000:55:41;16] THAT THE SUSPECT IS NOW  
[000:55:42;22] SURROUNDED IN THE BACKYARD  
[000:55:43;16] OF A STREET IN FRANKLIN  
[000:55:44;21] STREET IN WATERTOWN.  
[000:55:45;24] AUTHORITIES HAVE COME FROM  
[000:55:46;17] BOSTON AND DID IMMEDIATELY  
[000:55:47;27] FROM OUR POSITION IN  
[000:55:48;29] DOWNTOWN BOSTON WE WATCHED  
[000:55:49;25] THEM HEADING IN THAT  
[000:55:51;05] DIRECTION.  
[000:55:52;04] WE BELIEVE THERE ARE  
[000:55:53;07] SOMEWHERE AROUND HUNDREDS  
[000:55:54;01] OF OFFICERS ON SCENE AND  
[000:55:55;02] THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IS  
[000:55:57;03] SURROUNDED.  
[000:55:57;22] WHAT THESE NEW EXPLOSIONS  
[000:55:59;07] ARE, WE DON'T YET KNOW.  
[000:56:00;25] THEY WERE WORKING TO MAKE  
[000:56:01;24] CONTACT WITH A NEIGHBOR AND  
[000:56:02;24] WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN  
[000:56:03;20] WE DO.  
[000:56:04;11] NOW BACK TO LOCAL COVERAGE  
[000:56:05;10] FROM FOX 25 WFXT FOR NEW  
[000:56:09;06] ENGLAND.  
[000:56:09;20] >> THIS WHOLE CROWD HERE,  
[000:56:11;01] DOZENS OF PEOPLE.  
[000:56:11;26] YOU COULDN'T HEAR A PIN  
[000:56:13;00] DROP IT'S SO QUIET OUT HERE  
[000:56:14;15] RIGHT NOW.  
[000:56:15;03] WE HEARD A SERIES -- MANY  
[000:56:16;28] HERE BELIEVE INCLUDING  
[000:56:17;29] MYSELF THAT THERE WERE  
[000:56:19;05] GUNSHOTS FIRED.  
[000:56:20;03] WE HEARD TWO FAINT POPS.  
[000:56:23;01] ONE OF THOSE TWO DEFINITELY  
[000:56:25;15] SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT.  
[000:56:26;26] THEN WE HAD A LULL OF ABOUT  
[000:56:29;03] 30 SECONDS.  
[000:56:29;19] AND THEN WE HEARD A LOUD  
[000:56:31;10] BOOM.  
[000:56:31;26] AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT  
[000:56:35;15] WAS.  
[000:56:35;27] COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLOSIVE  
[000:56:37;05] OR COULD HAVE BEEN A  
[000:56:38;15] GUNSHOT.  
[000:56:38;29] AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE WE  
[000:56:39;26] HEARD TWO MORE POPS WHICH  
[000:56:43;15] SOUNDED LIKE GUNSHOTS.  
[000:56:45;06] EVERYONE HERE IS LISTENING  
[000:56:46;02] TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WAS  
[000:56:50;01] EXACTLY.  
[000:56:50;15] EVERYBODY YELLED GUNSHOTS  
[000:56:51;12] WHEN THEY HEARD THE NOISE.  
[000:56:52;27] I'M STANDING HERE WITH DAWN  
[000:56:54;05] WHO ACTUALLY HEARD THE  
[000:56:55;19] SOUNDS AS WELL.  
[000:56:56;07] WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE TO  
[000:56:57;29] YOU?  
[000:56:58;11] >> WELL, FIRST I HEARD  
[000:57:01;16] ABOUT -- TWO POPS, YOU  
[000:57:03;05] KNOW LOUD DISTINCT POPS,  
[000:57:07;06] GUNSHOTS.  
[000:57:07;21] ABOUT 10 SECOND INTERVAL  
[000:57:08;15] AND THEN WE HEARD A THIRD  
[000:57:10;11] SHOT.  
[000:57:10;24] AND THEN A COUPLE MINUTES  
[000:57:12;18] WENT BY.  
[000:57:14;22] TIME IS KIND OF FUZZY RIGHT  
[000:57:15;28] NOW AND THEN WE HEARD  
[000:57:19;05] THAT'S THE LAST WE HAVE  
[000:57:20;05] HEARD.  
[000:57:20;28] >> AND IT'S REALLY QUIET ON  
[000:57:22;18] SCENE RIGHT NOW.  
[000:57:23;24] EVERYONE -- EVERYBODY IS  
[000:57:26;06] TRYING TO LISTEN IN AND GET  
[000:57:27;12] A GRASP FOR WHAT EXACTLY  
[000:57:28;29] THOSE SOUNDS WERE.  
[000:57:29;21] >> JARED I'M GOING TO STOP  
[000:57:31;03] YOU FOR JUST A MOMENT TO  
[000:57:32;09] SAY WE ARE GETTING FROM BOB  
[000:57:33;28] WARD.  
[000:57:34;11] HE BELIEVES THEY MAY HAVE  
[000:57:35;23] BEEN FLASH BANKS.  
[000:57:36;18] I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME  
[000:57:37;29] EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY  
[000:57:38;22] AS YOU ARE A MARINE WHO  
[000:57:40;10] ALSO WORKED WITH  
[000:57:41;23] EXPLOSIVES, SO TELL US A  
[000:57:42;15] LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND  
[000:57:43;12] WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OR  
[000:57:44;18] DIDN'T HEAR.  
[000:57:51;18] >> RIGHT, ONE OF THOSE WAS  
[000:57:52;25] VERY LOUD.  
[000:57:53;12] IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A  
[000:57:55;04] GUNSHOT TO ME.  
[000:57:56;05] IT DID SOUND LIKE A FLASH  
[000:57:58;28] BANG.  
[000:57:59;11] I CAN'T SEE IT.  
[000:57:59;29] IT DID SOUND MORE OF LIKE  
[000:58:00;28] AN EXPLOSIVE.  
[000:58:01;20] I FIGURED IT WAS EITHER A  
[000:58:03;19] FLASH BANG OR PIPE BOMB.  
[000:58:05;18] NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT'S  
[000:58:06;26] ON SCENE.  
[000:58:11;16] IT DID SOUND MORE THAN  
[000:58:13;06] GUNSHOT ONE OF THOSE  
[000:58:14;03] SOUNDS, A LITTLE MORE  
[000:58:15;08] FAINT.  
[000:58:15;21] >> JARED, I JUST WANT TO  
[000:58:16;17] PASS ALONG TO THE AUDIENCE  
[000:58:17;19] BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING NEW  
[000:58:19;25] INFORMATION.  
[000:58:20;11] SOURCES TELLING US NOW THAT  
[000:58:22;04] THE SUSPECT IS INJURED FROM  
[000:58:25;05] LAST NIGHT FROM LAST  
[000:58:26;15] NIGHT'S CAR CHASE.  
[000:58:27;10] THE FIRE FIGHT THAT ENSUED  
[000:58:29;06] AND THEN HIS SUBSEQUENT  
[000:58:30;17] FLEEING ON FOOT.  
[000:58:31;09] SO WE'RE TOLD AGAIN THAT  
[000:58:33;19] THE SUSPECT WAS INJURED IN  
[000:58:34;26] LAST NIGHT'S SHOOTOUT.  
[000:58:39;29] AND SO NOW WE KNOW HE IS  
[000:58:42;04] INJURED, HE IS IN THAT  
[000:58:43;25] BOAT.  
[000:58:44;08] HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME  
[000:58:45;02] OUT.  
[000:58:45;14] SOME TYPE OF ROBOTIC DEVICE  
[000:58:46;29] HAS GONE IN TO SEE WHAT IT  
[000:58:48;10] LOOKS LIKE IN THAT AREA,  
[000:58:50;11] POTENTIALLY WHETHER OR NOT  
[000:58:51;04] HE IS THE SUSPECT THEY HAVE  
[000:58:52;00] BEEN LOOKING FOR ALTHOUGH  
[000:58:53;10] WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO  
[000:58:54;16] BELIEVE IT MAY BE.  
[000:58:59;10] OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO  
[000:59:00;04] TRY TO TAKE HIM OUT ALIVE.  
[000:59:01;12] THERE IS A QUESTION HERE.  
[000:59:02;08] DOES HE WANT TO COME OUT  
[000:59:03;09] AND HE SIMPLY CAN'T BECAUSE  
[000:59:04;16] HE IS INJURED?  
[000:59:05;21] >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.  
[000:59:06;26] WE DON'T
