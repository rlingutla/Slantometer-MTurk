551
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
HIS LAWYER PROVIDED PHOTOS OF

552
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
WHAT HE SAYS WAS A "FIGHT CLUB,"

553
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
JUST LIKE THE MOVIE, THAT HE
SAYS LEFT NOVACECK WITH A BROKEN

554
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
NOSE.

555
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
NOVACEK IS SUING OVER ANOTHER
ALLEGED INCIDENT.

556
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
>> HE WAS BEATEN WITH A BASEBALL

557
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
BAT AND KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS.
>> Reporter: HE SAYS THE

558
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
INCIDENT LED TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN

559
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
INJURY AND SEVERE MEMORY LOSS.
THE LAWSUIT SAYS THAT INCIDENT

560
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
TOOK PLACE ON OCTOBER 11, 2015,

561
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
BUT THE FRATERNITY SAYS NOVACEK

562
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
WAS NOT EVEN IN OKLAHOMA THAT

563
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000

POSTED FROM THE DALLAS COWBOY'S
GAME.

565
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
NOVACEK'S LAWYER SAYS HIS CLIENT

566
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
CANNOT BE SURE OF THE EXACT DATE

567
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
BECAUSE OF THE MEMORY LOSS.

568
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
SO THEY'RE AMENDING THE LAWSUIT.

569
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
THE FRATERNITY SAYS IT DOES NOT

570
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000

588
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
(Sigh)
And this wrestling ticket.

589
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Which you still owe me for.

590
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Seriously? $25?

591
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I didn't even want to go.

592
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Ahh, your diary!

593
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
"Mom says it is
totally natural..."

594
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
$25 is nothing.

595

(Alert beep)

596
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Abracadabra, bro.

599
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Settle up with your friends
on October 17th

600
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When it comes to strong bones,
are you on the right path?

601
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We have postmenopausal
osteoporosis...

602
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
..and a high risk for fracture,
so with our doctors...

603
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
...we chose Prolia®...

604
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
...to help make our bones
stronger.

605
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Only Prolia® helps strengthen
bones...

606
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
...by stopping cells that damage
them...

607
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
...with 1 shot every 6 months.

608
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do not take Prolia® if you have
low blood calcium, are pregnant,

609
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
are allergic to it, or take
XGEVA®.

610
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Serious allergic reactions, like
low blood pressure; trouble
breathing;

611
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
throat tightness; face, lip or
tongue swelling...

612
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
...rash, itching or hives have
happened.

613
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Tell your doctor about dental
problems, as severe jaw bone...

614
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
...problems may happen or new or
unusual pain in your hip groin,
or thigh,

615
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
as unusual thigh bone fractures
have occurred.

616
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
peak to your doctor before
stopping Prolia®,

617
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
as spine and other bone
fractures have occurred.

618
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Prolia® can cause serious side
effects, like low blood calcium;

619
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
serious infections, which could
need hospitalization;

620
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
...skin problems; and severe
bone, joint, or muscle pain.

621
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If your bones aren't getting
stronger...

622
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
...isn't it time for a new
direction?

623
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why wait? Ask your doctor about
Prolia®.

624
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
eight hundred dollars whenlmost

625
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
we switched our auto and
home insurance.

626
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Liberty did what?

627
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, they saved us a ton,

628
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
which gave us a little wiggle
room in our budget.

629
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wish our insurance did that.

630
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Then we could get a real

631
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
babysitter instead of
your brother.

632
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hey, welcome back.

633
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This guy... right?

634
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes.

635
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Ellen.

636
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's my robe.

637
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You could save seven hundred
eighty two dollars

638
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
when Liberty stands with you.

639
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
LIBERTY MUTUAL INSURANCE.

640
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I even accept I have a higher
risk of stroke due to AFib,
I accept I take easier trails
than I used to.

641
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
a type of irregular heartbeat
not caused

642
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
by a heart valve problem.

643
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But no matter what path I take,
I go for my best.

644
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So if there's something better
than warfarin,

645
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll go for that too. ELIQUIS.

646
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
ELIQUIS reduced the risk of
stroke better than warfarin,

647
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
plus had less
major bleeding
than warfarin.

648
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
ELIQUIS had both.

649
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't stop taking ELIQUIS unless
your doctor tells you to,

650
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
as stopping increases your risk
of having a stroke.

651
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and in
rare cases fatal bleeding.

652
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
an artificial heart valve

653
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
or abnormal bleeding.

654
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
While taking ELIQUIS, you may
bruise more easily...

655
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
...and it may take longer than
usual for any bleeding to stop.

656
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Seek immediate medical care for
sudden signs of bleeding,

657
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
like unusual bruising.

658
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
ELIQUIS may increase your
bleeding risk

659
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
if you take certain medicines.

660
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Tell your doctor about all
planned medical

661
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
or dental procedures.

662
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm still going
for my best.

663
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And for ELIQUIS.

664
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Ask your doctor about ELIQUIS.
