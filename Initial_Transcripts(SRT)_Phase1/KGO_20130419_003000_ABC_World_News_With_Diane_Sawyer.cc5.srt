LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT A REMOTE

118

CONTROLLED UNIT HAD BEEN USED IN

119

EXNS.

156
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CELLPHONE

157
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WAS USED TO TRIGGER ONE OF THE

158
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
EXPLOSIONS.

159
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000

LOCAL AREA AT THE TIME OF THE

BOMBINGS, TO SEE IF THEY CAN

164
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
TRACE IT BACK TO THE BOMBER.

165
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THE SOURCE SAID IT'S A

166
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS BUT A TOP

167
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
PRIORITY.

168
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
>> AS YOU WATCH THE TAPES GO BY

169
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000

SO OFTEN, TELL US THE KIND OF

171
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
DETAIL THE FBI IS ASKING

EVERYONE TO NOTICE.

173
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
>> ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE

174
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
AS YOU LOOK AT THE TAPE IS THAT

175
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
THE BLACK BACKPACK IS ONE

176
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CRITICAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

177
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME THAT

178
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BACKPACK IS THE ONE THAT THEY

179
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
RECOVERED THE MOST MATERIAL

180
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
FROM.

181
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THE OTHER THING IS THAT EVERY

182
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN THAT FRAME,

183
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
THE HAT, THE COAT, THE PANTS,

184
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THEY WANT THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT

185
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
THAT BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE

186
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE WOULD

187
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
NOTICE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

188
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
AND TO LOOK OVER EVERY FRAME BY

189
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
FRAME, THEY SENT EVERYONE TO THE

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
WEBSITE, FBI.GOV TO CHECK IT

191
