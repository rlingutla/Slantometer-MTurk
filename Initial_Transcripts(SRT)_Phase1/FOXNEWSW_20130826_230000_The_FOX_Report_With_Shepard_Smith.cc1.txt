[000:02:20;05] BUT U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE  
[000:02:21;00] ALREADY MADE THEIR OWN  
[000:02:22;00] CONCLUSIONS.  
[000:02:22;16] >> YEAH, THEY MAY HAVE  
[000:02:23;10] DECIDED TO DO THAT JON,  
[000:02:24;23] SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE  
[000:02:26;02] DIFFICULTY THOSE YATIONS  
[000:02:27;15] WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE  
[000:02:28;28] FACED IN DOING THEIR JOB  
[000:02:32;14] INSIDE SYRIA.  
[000:02:33;29] TODAY FOR INSTANCE THEIR

[000:02:44;08] ONE VEHICLE WAS HIT.  
[000:02:46;06] NO INJURIES REPORTED.  
[000:02:48;28] AND THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS  
[000:02:50;09] DID THEN GO ON TO THE

[000:02:53;03] INTERVIEWED SOME OF THE  
[000:02:54;21] ALLEGED VICTIMS OF THE  
[000:02:55;28] ATTACK AND SOME DOCTORS WHO  
[000:02:57;15] HAD TREATED THEM.  
[000:02:58;22] BUT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN  
[000:02:59;19] KERRY WAS QUICK TO POINT  
[000:03:00;25] OUT TODAY THAT THE SYRIAN  
[000:03:02;28] GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN  
[000:03:03;18] ANYTHING BUT HELPFUL TO  
[000:03:05;13] THOSE INSPECTORS.  
[000:03:06;09] LISTEN.  
[000:03:13;14] INSTEAD FOR FIVE DAYS THEY  
[000:03:15;06] REFUSED INVESTIGATORS TO  
[000:03:15;28] THE SITE OF THE ATTACK THAT  
[000:03:17;19] WOULD ALLEGEDLY EXONERATE  
[000:03:19;13] THEM.  
[000:03:19;26] INSTEAD IT ATTACKED THE  
[000:03:22;20] AREA FURTHER SHELLING IT  
[000:03:25;17] AND SYSTEMATICALLY  
[000:03:26;07] DESTROYING EVIDENCE.  
[000:03:26;27] THAT'S NOT THE BEHAVIOR OF  
[000:03:27;27] A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS  
[000:03:28;23] NOTHING TO HIDE.  
[000:03:29;17] >> NOW, THERE IS NO  
[000:03:31;16] INDICATION AT THIS MOMENT  
[000:03:32;23] WHEN THOSE UNITED NATIONS  
[000:03:34;21] INSPECTORS MIGHT LEAVE  
[000:03:37;18] SYRIA FOR ANYONE READING  
[000:03:44;01] THE TEA LEAVES THAT ACT

[000:04:02;12] RELEASED BY STATE RUN  
[000:04:03;22] SYRIAN MEDIA WE CANNOT  
[000:04:05;17] INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THEM.  
[000:04:06;11] IN THE INTERVIEW PRESIDENT  
[000:04:07;24] ASSAD SAID QUOTE:  THINK

[000:04:15;28] SPREAD OR HOW IT WILL END.  
[000:04:17;13] ASKED HOW HE BELIEVES IT  
[000:04:18;18] MIGHT END FOR THE U.S., HE  
[000:04:21;05] SAID WHAT IT SUFFERED IN  
[000:04:22;07] ALL ITS WARS FROM VIETNAM  
[000:04:25;16] UNTIL NOW FAILURE.  
[000:04:27;13] THOSE QUOTES APPEAR TO BE  
[000:04:29;06] AFFIRMATION OF WHAT WE HAVE  
[000:04:30;23] SAID MANY TIMES HERE BEFORE  
[000:04:33;16] RK JON THAT LONG AGO

[000:07:14;28] ACTIVITY HE SAYS THIS  
[000:07:17;15] APPEARS TO BE SOLELY  
[000:07:18;24] MOTIVATED BY THE ROBBERY  
[000:07:20;00] ASPECT NOT RACE.  
[000:07:20;29] BOTH BOYS THERE WERE

[000:07:38;03] OVER 5 FEET TALL.  
[000:07:39;00] POLICE SAY HE THOUGHT BACK  
[000:07:40;15] AND THAT MAY HAVE  
[000:07:42;08] CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEVERITY  
[000:07:43;10] OF THE ATTACK.

[000:29:59;29] SAY THE U.S. NOW HAS FOUR  
[000:30:01;29] WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST OF  
[000:30:03;16] SYRIA READY TO STRIKE AT A  
[000:30:04;27] MOMENT'S NOTICE.  
[000:30:05;15] ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE  
[000:30:06;19] HOUSE.  
[000:30:07;02] SO, ED, WHAT IS NEXT FOR  
[000:30:08;00] THE PRESIDENT ON THIS  
[000:30:09;16] ISSUE?  
[000:30:09;29] >> THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION  
[000:30:11;04] JON.  
[000:30:11;16] THESE WERE THE STRONGEST  
[000:30:13;07] COMMENTS YET FROM ANYONED  
[000:30:15;07] IN THE ADMINISTRATION.  
[000:30:16;12] SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN  
[000:30:17;20] KERRY CAME OUT TODAY AND  
[000:30:19;21] RATHER DRAMATICALLY  
[000:30:20;20] DECLARED THAT IN FACT THE  
[000:30:21;23] U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES  
[000:30:22;15] THAT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL  
[000:30:23;19] ATTACK AND THAT THE SYRIAN  
[000:30:24;23] GOVERNMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE  
[000:30:25;20] FOR IT.  
[000:30:26;21] THEY FLATLY DECLARED THAT  
[000:30:28;16] AND JOHN KERRY WENT ON TO  
[000:30:29;23] TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT  
[000:30:31;15] WANTS TO HAVE  
[000:30:33;00] ACCOUNTABI   HINTING AT U.S. MILITARY
[000:30:35;13] ACTION.  
[000:30:35;27] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:30:36;29] >> WHAT WE SAW IN SYRIA  
[000:30:39;06] LAST WEEK SHOULD SHOCK THE  
[000:30:43;00] CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD IT.  
[000:30:44;04] IT DEFIES ANY CODE OF  
[000:30:46;17] MORALITY.  
[000:30:47;02] LET ME BE CLEAR.  
[000:30:49;15] THE INDISCRIMINATE  
[000:30:50;26] SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS, THE  
[000:30:52;00] KILLING OF WOMEN AND  
[000:30:52;25] CHILDREN AND INNOCENT  
[000:30:54;08] BYSTANDERS BIOCHEMICAL  
[000:30:55;02] WEAPONS IS IMMORAL  
[000:30:57;22] OBSCENITY.  
[000:30:58;08] >> NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT  
[000:30:59;23] GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY, THE  
[000:31:00;24] CHAIR OF THE JOINT CHIEFS  
[000:31:02;05] HAS PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT  
[000:31:03;15] WITH ONE PLAN THAT WOULD  
[000:31:05;01] INCLUDE GROUND TROOPS,  
[000:31:06;04] COULD INCLUDE HALF A  
[000:31:07;09] MILLION U.S. GROUND TROOPS,  
[000:31:08;16] BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS.  
[000:31:09;22] THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY  
[000:31:10;18] OPTION THE PRESIDENT HAS  
[000:31:11;13] RULED OUT.  
[000:31:12;01] HE SAID PUBLICLY MANY TIMES  
[000:31:13;15] HE WOULD NOT COMMIT U.S.  
[000:31:14;25] GROUND TROOPS.  
[000:31:15;25] THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION  
[000:31:17;02] INVOLVING CREWS MISSILES  
[000:31:17;24] THAT WOULD BE SHOT FROM  
[000:31:20;09] SUBMARINES.  
[000:31:20;25] ALSO PRECISION GUIDED  
[000:31:22;22] MISSILES.  
[000:31:23;07] FIRED FROM AIRPLANES THAT  
[000:31:24;00] WOULD BE FLYING BELOW  
[000:31:25;24] SYRIAN RADAR.  
[000:31:26;12] THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE  
[000:31:28;11] TABLE.  
[000:31:28;24] IT COULD VERY WELL BE ONE  
[000:31:29;17] OF THE OPTIONS THE  
[000:31:30;09] PRESIDENT USES JON.  
[000:31:31;27] >> Jon: THE PRESIDENT IS  
[000:31:33;06] UNDER PRETTY HEAVY PRESSURE  
[000:31:34;10] FROM REPUBLICANS TO ACT.  
[000:31:35;08] >> THAT'S RIGHT, JON IT WAS  
[000:31:36;19] ONE YEAR AGO THIS MONTH AT  
[000:31:38;02] A NEWS CONFERENCE HERE AT  
[000:31:39;07] THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THE  
[000:31:40;09] PRESIDENT FIRST DREW THAT  
[000:31:41;02] RED LINE FAMOUSLY IN TERMS  
[000:31:42;16] OF THE USE OF CHEMICAL  
[000:31:44;01] WEAPONS BY PRESIDENT ASSAD  
[000:31:45;10] IN SYRIA.  
[000:31:45;25] AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY IN  
[000:31:47;03] THE NEXT LINE AT THAT NEWS  
[000:31:48;19] CONFERENCE SAID THERE WOULD  
[000:31:49;19] BE QUOTE, ENORMOUS  
[000:31:51;07] CONSEQUENCES IF THAT LINE  
[000:31:52;00] WAS CROSSED.  
[000:31:52;22] THAT'S WHY REPUBLICAN JOHN  
[000:31:56;05] MCCAIN TODAY DECLARED THE  
[000:31:58;01] PRESIDENT BETTER BACK UP  
[000:31:58;23] THESE WORDS.  
[000:31:59;16] TAKE A LISTEN.  
[000:32:00;08] >> IF THE UNITED STATES  
[000:32:01;23] STANDS BY AND DOESN'T TAKE  
[000:32:04;07] VERY SERIOUS ACTION.  
[000:32:05;08] NOT JUST LAUNCHING CREWS  
[000:32:09;07] MISSILES, THEN AGAIN OUR  
[000:32:11;14] CREDIBILITY IN THE WORLD IS  
[000:32:13;09] DIMINISHED EVEN MORE IF  
[000:32:14;09] THERE IS ANY LEFT.  
[000:32:16;12] >> NOW, WHITE HOUSE  
[000:32:18;19] SPOKESMAN JAY CARNEY TODAY  
[000:32:19;12] REFUSED TO GET INTO ANY  
[000:32:20;23] HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT WHAT'S  
[000:32:21;16] THE NEXT MOVE FROM THE  
[000:32:22;11] PRESIDENT.  
[000:32:22;26] THEY OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KEEP  
[000:32:23;26] AS MUCH AS THIS BEHIND  
[000:32:25;24] CLOSE THE DOORS AS THEY  
[000:32:26;18] CAN.  
[000:32:27;00] BUT HE DID SAY THAT THERE  
[000:32:28;04] WILL BE SOME SORT OF A  
[000:32:29;16] RESPONSE THAT IT DEMANDS A  
[000:32:31;13] RESPONSE, BUT HE SAID THE  
[000:32:32;08] PRESIDENT HAS NOT MADE A  
[000:32:33;11] FINAL DECISION YET JON.  
[000:32:35;08] >> Jon: ED HENRY, THANK  
[000:32:36;05] YOU.  
[000:32:36;17] A NEW BOMBSHELL ALLEGATION  
[000:32:37;21] THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS  
[000:32:38;18] BEEN SPYING ON THE UNITED  
[000:32:39;27] NATIONS.  
[000:32:41;01] ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTS, NSA  
[000:32:42;26] LEAKER ED SNOWDEN GAVE TO

[000:32:56;23] THE NSA BUGGED THE EUROPEAN

[000:33:34;19] PROTECTED BY THE RELEVANT  
[000:33:35;28] INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS  
[000:33:36;21] LIKE THE VIENNA CONVENTION  
[000:33:38;05] HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED  
[000:33:40;02] INTERNATIONAL LAW.  
[000:33:41;29] >> DER SPIEGEL ALSO  
[000:33:43;14] REPORTING THAT THE NSA  
[000:33:44;13] SURVEILLANCE OF 80  
[000:33:45;17] EMBASSIES AND CONSULATES IS  
[000:33:46;26] PART OF A SPECIAL PROGRAM  
[000:33:47;22] KNOWN AS A SPECIAL  
[000:33:49;01] COLLECTION SERVICE JON.  
[000:33:50;21] >> Jon: SO WHAT ARE WE  
[000:33:51;26] HEARING FROM THE  
[000:33:52;26] ADMINISTRATION?  
[000:33:53;14] >> WELL, GIVEN THE  
[000:33:54;08] SENSITIVE NATURE OF THE  
[000:33:55;09] ALLEGATIONS, THE STATE  
[000:33:56;13] DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN READ  
[000:33:57;11] FROM HER NOTES PROVIDING A  
[000:33:59;08] SCRIPTIVE RESPONSE.  
[000:34:00;12] >> WE SAID THIS REPEATEDLY  
[000:34:02;03] THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO  
[000:34:03;09] COMMENT PUBLICLY ON EVERY  
[000:34:05;13] SPECIFIC ALLEGED  
[000:34:06;01] INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY AS A  
[000:34:07;07] MATTER OF POLICY.  
[000:34:08;02] WE HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THE

[000:34:11;05] INTELLIGENCE OF THE TYPE  
[000:34:11;27] GATHERED BY ALL NATIONS.  
[000:34:13;28] >> THE NEWEST LEAKS FROM  
[000:34:15;13] FORMER NSA CONTRACTOR  
[000:34:17;06] EDWARD SNOWDEN APPEARED TO  
[000:34:18;17] UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT'S  
[000:34:20;06] MOST EXPENSIVE DEFENSE OF

[000:34:23;06] >> I DON'T HAVE AN INTEREST  
[000:34:27;10] AND THE PEOPLE OF THE NSA  
[000:34:28;27] DON'T HAVE AN INTEREST IN  
[000:34:30;00] DOING ANYTHING OTHER THAN  
[000:34:32;26] MAKING SURE THAT WHERE WE  
[000:34:35;22] CAN PREVENT A TERRORIST  
[000:34:38;16] ATTACK.

[000:34:42;05] DEPARTMENT'S SCRIPTED  
[000:34:43;18] COMMENTS.  
[000:34:44;15] JON.  
[000:34:44;27] >> Jon: AND CATHERINE, WE  
[000:34:45;20] ARE LEARNING THAT SNOWDEN'S  
[000:34:46;24] DECISION TO FLY TO RUSSIA  
[000:34:48;01] MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE  
[000:34:50;02] SURPRISE THAT PRESIDENT  
[000:34:51;07] VLADIMIR PUTIN PUTIN  
[000:34:52;12] CLAIMED.  
[000:34:52;26] ACCORDING TO A RESPECTED  
[000:34:53;28] RUSSIAN NEWSPAPER SNOWDEN  
[000:34:55;00] SPENT TWO DAYS AT RUSSIA'S  
[000:34:57;00] CONSULATE IN HONG KONG  
[000:34:58;02] BEFORE HE FLEW TO MOSCOW.

[000:35:01;08] SHOWED HIS PLANE TICKET AND  
[000:35:02;11] ASKED FOR HELP.  
[000:35:03;10] HE EVENTUALLY FLEW TO  
[000:35:05;02] RUSSIA WHERE OFFICIALS  
[000:35:06;01] GRANTED HIM TEMPORARY  
[000:35:07;18] ASYLUM.  
[000:35:08;16] A NEW STOCK EXCHANGE COULD  
[000:35:10;10] SOON REPLACE THE NASDAQ AS  
[000:35:11;16] THE SECOND LARGEST IN THE  
[000:35:13;21] U.S.  
[000:35:14;03] THE DEAL WAS ANNOUNCED  
[000:35:14;24] TODAY AND IF REGULATORS

[000:35:22;29] THE NEW EXCHANGE WOULD TAKE  
[000:35:25;24] THE BATS GLOBAL MARKET  
[000:35:27;20] NAME.  
[000:35:28;03] THE CURRENT CEO CALLED IT  
[000:35:29;20] AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR  
[000:35:31;14] THE U.S. EQUITIES MARKET.  
[000:35:33;01] THE DEAL COMES ALMOST A  
[000:35:34;08] WEEK AFTER A TECHNICAL  
[000:35:36;03] GLITCH AT THE NASDAQ CAUSED  
[000:35:37;22] A FLY HOUR TRADING HALT.
