[000:00:50;650] HE WAS ALARMED AT THE RATE

[000:01:25;718] SUSPICION EVEN BY A WRONG
[000:01:26;653] CALL.
[000:01:27;220] THEN THEY CAN USE THE
[000:01:28;588] SYSTEM TO GO BACK IN TIME
[000:01:30;557] AND SCRUTINIZE EVERY
[000:01:32;358] DECISION YOU EVER MADE.
[000:01:33;893] >> Harris: HE SAYS HE HAS

[000:01:41;167] ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT MINING

[000:01:49;609] INFORMATION ABOUT THE
[000:01:50;310] PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN BY THE
[000:01:52;078] NSA.
[000:01:54;581] SNOWDEN IS A CONTRACTOR
[000:01:56;516] WORK FOR THE NSA.
[000:01:59;085] AND KATHERINE, IN JUST LAST
[000:02:01;020] FEW MINUTES THE STORY HAS
[000:02:02;689] BEEN UNFOLDING AS BREAKING
[000:02:04;824] DETAILS.
[000:02:05;191] WE GOT A STATEMENT FROM THE
[000:02:07;160] INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY,
[000:02:08;194] WHAT DOES IT SAY.
[000:02:09;596] >> Reporter: SHORT TIME AGO
[000:02:12;098] WE RECEIVED A STATEMENT

[000:02:19;239] INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS
[000:02:21;441] THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE BY
[000:02:25;311] RECENT DISCLOSURES.
[000:02:26;679] ANYBODY THAT HAS A SECURITY
[000:02:28;515] CLEARANCE HAS TO PROTECT
[000:02:30;783] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND
[000:02:32;585] ABIDE BY THE LAW.
[000:02:34;087] A REPORT HAS BEEN FILED AND
[000:02:36;122] THAT IS FIRST STEP TOWARD A
[000:02:38;825] CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
[000:02:39;592] >> Harris: WHAT MORE ARE WE
[000:02:42;595] LEARNING ABOUT SNOWDEN?
[000:02:43;630] >> IT COMES FROM AN
[000:02:45;398] INTERVIEW POSTED BY THE
[000:02:47;200] GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER,
[000:02:48;234] INFORMATION MUST BE SEEN IN
[000:02:49;469] THAT CON PARTICULARS.
[000:02:50;036] IN THE INTERVIEW HE CLAIMS
[000:02:51;171] TO BE A FORMER SYSTEMS
[000:02:54;841] ADMINISTRATOR THAT ALLOWED
[000:02:55;708] HIM A BROAD EITHER VIEW OF
[000:02:57;310] THE NSA PROGRAM.
[000:02:59;112] >> WHEN YOU ARE IN POSITION
[000:03:01;581] OF PRIVILEGED ACCESS LIKE
[000:03:04;117] OUR SYSTEM'S ADMINISTRATOR
[000:03:06;586] FOR THE INTELLIGENCE
[000:03:07;420] AGENCIES YOU ARE EXPOSED TO
[000:03:08;555] A LOT MORE INFORMATION ON A
[000:03:10;490] BROADER SCALE AN THE
[000:03:11;558] AVERAGE EMPLOYEE.
[000:03:12;759] BECAUSE OF THAT YOU SEE
[000:03:14;961] THINGS THAT MAYBE
[000:03:16;930] DISTURBING, BUT OVER THE
[000:03:17;864] COURSE OF A NORMAL PERSON'S
[000:03:19;732] CAREER YOU WOULD SEE ONE OR
[000:03:21;334] TWO INSTANCES.
[000:03:22;268] WHEN YOU SEE EVERYTHING,
[000:03:24;070] YOU SEE THEM ON A MORE
[000:03:26;139] FREQUENT BASIS.
[000:03:27;073] YOU RECOGNIZE SOME OF THESE
[000:03:28;408] THINGS ARE ABUSES.
[000:03:30;743] >> Reporter: ACCORDING TO
[000:03:31;778] THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER THE
[000:03:33;580] FINAL PHASE THREE WEEKS AGO
[000:03:35;782] AND NSA OFFICE IN HAWAII HE
[000:03:38;117] COPIED DOCUMENTS AND WENT
[000:03:39;052] TO HIS SUPERVISOR SAID HE
[000:03:43;289] NEEDED TIME OFF BECAUSE HE
[000:03:45;325] SUFFERED SEIZURES AND GOT
[000:03:46;459] ON THE PLANE TO HONG KONG.
[000:03:48;161] >> Harris: WHAT IS THE
[000:03:49;062] RESPONSE TONIGHT?
[000:03:50;697] >> FORMER EMPLOYEES SAY THE
[000:03:52;632] FLIGHT TO HONG KONG APPEARS
[000:03:54;200] TO BE AN EFFORT TO PUT HIM
[000:03:56;636] AS FAR OUT OF REACH OF THE
[000:03:58;671] U.S. GOVERNMENT BECAUSE HE
[000:04:00;406] UNDERSTANDS THE DEPTH OF
[000:04:01;674] THE LEAK.
[000:04:02;475] HE ADDRESSES THE LIKELIHOOD
[000:04:03;977] HE WILL BE EXTRADITED OR
[000:04:06;179] HANDED OVER FOR TRIAL AT
[000:04:07;046] SOME POINT.
[000:04:07;580] >> I COULD BE RENDERED BY
[000:04:09;916] THE C.I.A.
[000:04:11;684] PEOPLE COME AFTER ME OR
[000:04:13;586] THIRD PARTY PARTNERS OF
[000:04:15;021] THEM WORK CLOSELY WITH
[000:04:16;823] NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONS.
[000:04:21;060] >> Reporter: HE FEARS FOR
[000:04:22;595] HIS FAMILY ADDING THAT SOME
[000:04:24;197] STILL WORK IN THE U.S.
[000:04:25;365] GOVERNMENT.
[000:04:26;232] HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN
[000:04:28;167] ELIZABETH CITY, NORTH
[000:04:28;968] CAROLINA AND LATER MOVED TO
[000:04:32;005] MARYLAND BUT DESPITE AN
[000:04:33;973] ACADEMIC RECORD HE WAS
[000:04:34;907] GREAT WITH W COMPUTERS AND
[000:04:36;709] FOUND HIS WAYS INTO JOBS AT
[000:04:39;379] C.I.A. AND NSA.
[000:04:40;713] >> Harris: WHAT IS THE
[000:04:41;614] RESPONSE TONIGHT?
[000:04:42;715] DO WE KNOW FOR HIS FORMER
[000:04:45;151] EMPLOYER?
[000:04:45;518] >> WHEN CONTACT BY FOX
[000:04:46;753] NEWS, THERE IS NO COMMENT
[000:04:47;987] BY THE C.I.A.
[000:04:49;289] BRITISH NEWSPAPER REPORTS
[000:04:50;723] THAT HE WORKED VARIOUS
[000:04:52;592] CONTRACTORS AT NSA.
[000:04:54;360] LATE TODAY ONE OF THE
[000:04:55;662] LARGEST SECURITY FIRMS
[000:04:57;463] CONFIRMING ON ITS WEBSITE
[000:04:58;965] THAT SNOWDEN IS THE
[000:05:03;970] EMPLOYEE.
[000:05:04;837] THEY CAN CONFIRM HE HAS
[000:05:06;639] BEEN AN EMPLOYEE LESS THAN
[000:05:09;108] THREE MONTHS ASSIGNED TO A
[000:05:10;877] TEAM IN HAWAII.
[000:05:12;779] HE HAS CLAIMED TO HAVE
[000:05:14;981] LEAKED INFORMATION IS
[000:05:16;082] SHOCKING.
[000:05:16;816] FORMER OFFICIALS TELL FOX
[000:05:18;184] NEWS THAT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
[000:05:19;452] FOR CONTRACTORS TO HAVE THE
[000:05:20;620] KIND OF SECURITY CLEARANCE,
[000:05:22;188] BUT APPARENTLY GAVE HIM
[000:05:23;556] ACCESS TO THESE DOCUMENTS
[000:05:25;525] AND NSA AND CONGRESS HAS
[000:05:28;761] SUPPORTED OUTSOURCING AS
[000:05:30;163] PART OF RATIONALE TO REDUCE
[000:05:33;599] COSTS.
[000:05:33;900] >> Harris: IT WILL BE
[000:05:34;934] INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT
[000:05:36;836] ARGUMENTS SHAPE UP.
[000:05:37;770] SOME WOULD SAY WE WOULDN'T
[000:05:39;105] KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH
[000:05:40;573] THE NSA SNOOPING IF IT
[000:05:43;176] HADN'T BEEN FOR SOMEONE
[000:05:44;277] LIKE THIS.
[000:05:44;944] WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
[000:05:46;079] MOVING AHEAD.
[000:05:47;447] >> WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
[000:05:49;382] AT EXACTLY WHO IS EDWARD
[000:05:52;218] SNOWDEN.
[000:05:54;320] ACCORDING TO THE GUARDIAN,
[000:05:55;188] HE WAS BORN IN NORTH
[000:05:57;256] CAROLINA BEFORE HIS FAMILY
[000:05:58;858] MOVED TO MARYLAND.
[000:05:59;859] NOT FAR FROM THE NSA
[000:06:02;428] HEADQUARTERS.
[000:06:03;162] IN 2003 HE ENLISTED IN THE
[000:06:07;266] ARMY BUT WAS DISCHARGED
[000:06:08;601] AFTER BREAKING BOTH LEGS IN
[000:06:10;002] A TRAINING ACCIDENT.
[000:06:11;104] HE FIRST WORK AS AN NS A A
[000:06:14;974] AS SECURITY GUARD BEFORE
[000:06:17;210] TRANSFERRING TO C.I.A..
[000:06:18;077] THAT JOB GAVE HIM CLEARANCE
[000:06:19;679] TO ACCESS A WIDE ARRAY OF
[000:06:22;148] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[000:06:23;583] THEN IN 2009 HE TOOK HIS
[000:06:26;119] FIRST LEGALLY NSA JOB
[000:06:27;587] WORKING AT FACILITIES IN
[000:06:29;322] JAPAN AND HAWAII.
[000:06:30;323] BEFORE THIS NEWS BROKE,
[000:06:33;059] THIS WEEKEND WE HAD BEEN
[000:06:34;293] TELLING YOU THE OBAMA
[000:06:35;728] ADMINISTRATION HAD PROMISED
[000:06:36;929] A FULL INVESTIGATION INTO
[000:06:38;030] THE NSA LEAKS.
[000:06:39;332] NOW THAT SOMEONE HAS COME
[000:06:42;201] FORWARD, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
[000:06:45;772] ANDREW NAPOLITANO JOINS US
[000:06:47;073] BY PHONE.
[000:06:48;174] JUDGE ARE YOU WITH US?
[000:06:49;041] >> YES.
[000:06:49;842] >> Harris: FIRST EDWARD
[000:06:52;412] SNOWDEN ARE BLOWING THE
[000:06:54;914] WHISTLE BUT SOME PEOPLE
[000:06:56;482] WON'T CALL HIM A
[000:06:58;618] WHISTLEBLOWER.
[000:06:59;652] LET'S START THERE?
[000:07:00;653] >> FOR HIM TO QUALIFY AS A
[000:07:02;722] WHISTLEBLOWER HE WOULD NEED
[000:07:04;490] TO DEMONSTRATE, HIS
[000:07:08;227] BEHAVIOR ON WHICH HE BLEW A
[000:07:12;331] WHISTLE WAS ILLEGAL OR
[000:07:14;534] UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
[000:07:15;101] ON ITS FACE I SAY THAT
[000:07:18;538] BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN THE
[000:07:20;306] DOCUMENTS THAT THE
[000:07:20;840] GOVERNMENT FILED WITH THE
[000:07:22;842] COURT.
[000:07:23;309] ON ITS FACE THEY FILE A
[000:07:25;244] PROCEDURE.
[000:07:26;446] AND COURT AUTHORIZED THIS
[000:07:28;214] WARRANT OF THIS NATURE.
[000:07:30;349] CONTRARY TO THAT IS THE
[000:07:32;652] FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE
[000:07:34;420] CONSTITUTION WHICH WAS
[000:07:35;721] WRITTEN TO PROHIBIT THE
[000:07:37;490] TYPE OF FISHING EXPEDITION
[000:07:40;126] THAT THE GOVERNMENT ENGAGED
[000:07:41;461] IN HERE.
[000:07:41;794] YOU HAVE A STATUTE STATE
[000:07:45;097] SUPPORTS THE GOVERNMENT AND
[000:07:46;065] LANGUAGE IN THE
[000:07:47;200] CONSTITUTION ON ITS FACE
[000:07:48;634] SUPPORTS THE WHISTLEBLOWER.
[000:07:50;603] >> Harris: MEANWHILE, HE IS
[000:07:52;939] IN HONG KONG.
[000:07:53;806] WHAT HE SAID IN PART OF
[000:07:55;274] THAT TELEVISION INTERVIEW
[000:07:57;143] IS THAT HE IS HOPING THAT A
[000:07:59;846] COUNTRY RECOGNIZES FREE
[000:08:02;548] SPEECH WILL GIVE HIM
[000:08:04;350] ASYLUM?
[000:08:04;684] >> GOOD LORD, NOT IN CHINA.
[000:08:08;855] CHINA IS ONE OF THE MOST
[000:08:10;656] REPRESSIVE REGIMES ON THE
[000:08:11;491] PLANET.
[000:08:12;124] HONG KONG IS A UNIQUE PART
[000:08:14;660] OF CHINA, BUT HONG KONG IS
[000:08:17;363] GOVERNED BY CHINA AND THE
[000:08:19;699] CHINA AND UNITED STATES
[000:08:20;700] HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREAT.
[000:08:24;103] BECAUSE IT'S CHINA IT WILL
[000:08:25;838] BE A POLITICAL AS WELL AS
[000:08:28;140] LEGAL -- IF THE CHINESE
[000:08:29;942] GOVERNMENT WANTS TO
[000:08:30;810] COOPERATE WITH THE OBAMA
[000:08:33;079] ADMINISTRATION, SNOWDEN
[000:08:35;414] WILL BE ON PLANE U.S.
[000:08:40;052] MARSHALS BEFORE THE END OF
[000:08:41;354] THE WEEK.
[000:08:42;355] IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
[000:08:44;156] DOES NOT WANT TO COOPERATE
[000:08:46;626] HE MAY HAVE FOUND A SAFE
[000:08:49;929] HAVEN.
[000:08:50;229] >> Harris: WHAT ABOUT
[000:08:50;796] CHARGES AGAINST HIM?
[000:08:51;564] >> VERY SERIOUS.
[000:08:52;932] GOVERNMENT WILL CLAIM HE
[000:08:54;033] ENGAGED IN, THAT
[000:08:56;569] HE AIDED THE ENEMY AND
[000:09:00;239] SERIOUSLY HARMED GOVERNMENT
[000:09:02;375] PROGRAMS INTENDED TO
[000:09:04;977] PROTECT THE NATIONAL
[000:09:05;678] SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY.
[000:09:07;446] HIS DEFENSE WILL BE THE
[000:09:10;383] GOVERNMENT BEHAVED
[000:09:12;151] UNCONSTITUTIONALLY AND
[000:09:12;818] PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
[000:09:14;587] ABOUT IT.
[000:09:15;555] JURY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON
[000:09:17;423] WHO THEY BELIEVE.
[000:09:18;491] >> Harris: YOU ARE TALKING
[000:09:20;226] ABOUT SOMETHING MORE
[000:09:21;093] POLITICAL THAN LEGAL AS TO
[000:09:22;795] WHETHER HE WILL BE
[000:09:24;730] EXTRADITED.
[000:09:25;131] WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT AND
[000:09:26;432] LEADER OF CHINA WERE HERE.
[000:09:29;135] HE SINCE LEFT.
[000:09:30;336] YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THAT
[000:09:32;138] WOULD PLAY ANY PART TO
[000:09:34;073] EXTRADITE THIS PERSON?
[000:09:35;374] >> YES.
[000:09:37;243] THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA AND
[000:09:38;477] THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[000:09:41;480] STATES IN THE PAST 24 HOURS,
[000:09:46;052] THE COUNTRIES HAVE IMPROVED
[000:09:49;989] RELATIONSHIP FOR THE
[000:09:51;157] WEEKEND THEY SPENT
[000:09:52;391] TOGETHER.
[000:09:53;092] PRESIDENT OF CHINA IS NOT
[000:09:54;226] THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON.
[000:09:58;564] MOST POWERFUL IS THE HEAD
[000:09:59;398] OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
[000:10:01;701] PARTY BUT THEY ARE
[000:10:03;035] COLLEAGUES AND COLLABORATE
[000:10:04;270] ON THEIR DECISION TO SEND
[000:10:09;442] MR. SNOWDEN IS HERE.
[000:10:10;643] ONE HAS TO WONDER IF THE
[000:10:12;278] PRESIDENT OF CHINA KNEW IT
[000:10:13;613] WAS COMING WHEN HE WAS
[000:10:16;148] TALKING TO PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:10:17;516] THE LAST FEW DAYS.
[000:10:19;652] >> Harris: A LOT OF
[000:10:20;786] AMERICANS HAVE BEEN SAYING
[000:10:22;121] ON BLOGS AND ONLINE TONIGHT
[000:10:23;656] AS THE STORY IS BREAKING
[000:10:25;024] THEY FEEL SNOWDEN IS
[000:10:29;328] SOMEWHAT OF HERO THAT FEDS
[000:10:30;830] HAVE BEEN MONITORING US.
[000:10:32;832] IS THAT A DEFENSE POSSIBLY
[000:10:34;333] FOR HIM?
[000:10:34;967] >> THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
[000:10:36;235] THINK HE IS A HERO WOULD
[000:10:38;704] NOT BE A DEFENSE.
[000:10:39;739] WHAT WOULD BE A DEFENSE
[000:10:40;773] WOULD BE IF HIS LAWYERS CAN
[000:10:43;909] DEMONSTRATE THAT THE
[000:10:46;278] GOVERNMENT'S BEHAVIOR WAS
[000:10:47;380] SO WIDE OFF THE MARK OF
[000:10:49;749] AMERICAN VALUES AND SO
[000:10:50;950] CONTRARY TO THE
[000:10:52;051] CONSTITUTION THAT HE TOOK
[000:10:52;918] AN OATH TO UPHOLD AND
[000:10:55;321] BARACK OBAMA TOOK A VOTE TO

[000:31:27;151] MORAL OR WHAT IS NOT.
[000:31:30;989] IF HE WAS AWARE OF ANY
[000:31:34;392] ILLEGALITY.
[000:31:34;993] GO TO THE CONGRESS OR
[000:31:36;461] JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
[000:31:38;062] GO TO INSPECTOR GENUINE THE
[000:31:41;866] C.I.A. OR NSA.
[000:31:44;235] FOR HIM TO DECIDE ON HIS
[000:31:46;237] OWN TO COME FORWARD THIS IS

[000:31:51;142] HERO IT'S BEYOND ME.
[000:31:52;944] DO THEY REALIZE THE
[000:31:54;178] CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY
[000:31:54;979] ARE DOING HERE?
[000:31:56;080] IF THIS PROGRAM HAD NOT
[000:31:57;715] BEEN IN PLACE BACK IN 2009,
[000:32:02;220] THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED

[000:32:11;129] IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM.
[000:32:12;463] IF I WANT TO COMPARE THE
[000:32:14;632] HERO A PERSON WHO STOPPED
[000:32:16;534] THAT ATTACK AS HE WAS
[000:32:18;836] TRYING TO CARRY OUT THE
[000:32:20;338] UNITED STATES.
[000:32:26;110] ESPECIALLY THERE IS NO
[000:32:26;978] EVIDENCE OF ILLEGALITY.
[000:32:28;546] THIS IS CLEARLY IN
[000:32:30;348] COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.
[000:32:31;549] IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC
[000:32:33;251] OBJECTIONS, THERE IS A FISA
[000:32:35;453] COURT THAT MONITORS THIS ON
[000:32:36;487] A REGULAR BASIS.
[000:32:38;756] THERE IS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
[000:32:40;892] AND ESPECIALLY THE FISA
[000:32:41;926] COURT.
[000:32:42;327] THIS IS UNDER COURT
[000:32:44;595] SUPERVISION.
[000:32:44;996] >> Harris: ONE OF THE
[000:32:46;097] THINGS YOU WILL SEE WHEN
[000:32:47;498] YOU WATCH THE TAPE, HE SAYS
[000:32:50;001] HE KNEW THE RISKS BUT HE
[000:32:52;136] FELT THE ABUSES HE WAS
[000:32:54;806] WITNESSING AND POSSIBLY
[000:32:56;307] TAKING A PART IN IN TERMS
[000:32:57;875] OF MONITORING PHONE RECORDS
[000:33:00;511] AND SNOOPING, HE THOUGHT
[000:33:03;281] THOSE WERE SO EGREGIOUS AND
[000:33:06;884] PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LISTEN?
[000:33:08;586] >> WHO IS HE TO DECIDE TO
[000:33:10;688] PUT AMERICAN LIVES AT RISK?
[000:33:12;223] IF HE FELT THAT STRONGLY
[000:33:13;992] ABOUT IT, GO TO THE
[000:33:15;293] INSPECTOR GENERAL.
[000:33:15;860] GO TO THE JUSTICE
[000:33:17;595] DEPARTMENT.
[000:33:17;996] THE FACT IS YOU CANNOT HAVE
[000:33:20;565] EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE
[000:33:21;299] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDING
[000:33:22;333] WHAT LAW THEY ARE GOING TO
[000:33:23;334] FOLLOW AND WHAT LAW THEY
[000:33:24;535] ARE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW.
[000:33:26;971] AND WHY IS HE IN HONG KONG?
[000:33:29;507] TO BE IN CHINA IS THE
[000:33:33;811] LEADING COUNTRY IN THE
[000:33:35;246] WORLD AS FAR AS HACKING
[000:33:36;714] INTO US AND TRYING TO STEAL
[000:33:38;216] OUR SECRETS.
[000:33:39;083] IN MANY WAYS, INTELLIGENCE
[000:33:40;651] WISE IS AN ENEMY COUNTRY.
[000:33:43;621] WHY IS HE THERE SUBJECTING
[000:33:45;656] HIMSELF TO CHINESE
[000:33:47;358] INTELLIGENCE RAISES
[000:33:48;526] QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM.
[000:33:53;231] HE HAS DISCLOSED AN
[000:33:57;735] INCREDIBLE ASSISTANCE TO
[000:33:58;569] AL-QAEDA.
[000:33:59;670] AL-QAEDA IS TRYING TO KILL
[000:34:00;772] AMERICANS.
[000:34:01;139] THAT IS THE MESSAGE WE HAVE
[000:34:02;607] TO KEEP IN MIND.
[000:34:03;608] HIS ACTIONS AND VERY LIKELY
[000:34:05;309] COULD RESULT IN THE DEATHS
[000:34:07;078] OF INNOCENT AMERICAN LIVES.
[000:34:08;980] >> Harris: YOU MENTION WHY
[000:34:12;083] DID HE GO TO HONG KONG.
[000:34:14;085] WE KNOW HE WAS WITH A
[000:34:17;188] JOURNALIST WITH THE
[000:34:18;089] GUARDIAN.
[000:34:18;456] WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS
[000:34:20;425] AN AGREEMENT TO GO WITH
[000:34:21;559] THAT JOURNALIST.
[000:34:22;627] WE DO KNOW THIS IS A
[000:34:24;762] SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE
[000:34:27;098] TERRITORY OF CHINA AND
[000:34:27;999] THERE IS EXTRADITION
[000:34:29;534] BETWEEN HONG KONG AND THE
[000:34:30;501] UNITED STATES.
[000:34:31;569] WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS
[000:34:33;204] GOING FORTH.

[000:34:45;583] I HOPE OUR GOVERNMENT WILL
[000:34:47;652] REACH OUT CHINA.
[000:34:49;187] WE HAVE A TREATY WITH HONG

[000:36:53;144] WE HAD OPEN AND CLOSED
[000:36:55;179] HEARINGS.
[000:36:55;546] THAT IS THE PROPER WAY TO
[000:36:56;280] DO IT.
[000:36:57;248] UNFORTUNATELY FOR MR. SNOWDEN
[000:37:00;885] HAS CAUSED FAR MORE
[000:37:03;087] PROBLEMS FOR HIMSELF AND HE
[000:37:04;121] HAS DEFECTED.
[000:37:04;889] HE IS IN ENEMY TERRITORY
[000:37:06;591] RIGHT NOW.
[000:37:07;425] CHINA IS NOT AN ADVERSARY
[000:37:09;727] OF OURS BUT THERE IS
[000:37:11;929] HACKING GOING ON.
[000:37:12;663] WHATEVER INFORMATION IS IN
[000:37:13;864] HIS HEAD IS NOW WITH
[000:37:15;800] CHINESE IN SOME FORM.
[000:37:18;336] >> Harris: WOW!
[000:37:19;770] I HAD NOT HEARD ANYBODY PUT
[000:37:22;106] IT EXACTLY LIKE THAT.
[000:37:23;407] YOU HEARD CONGRESSMAN KING
[000:37:26;110] TALKING A LITTLE BIT BUT
[000:37:27;745] YOU DUG IN DEEPER.
[000:37:30;281] THAT HAS A LOT OF IMPACT?
[000:37:31;716] >> IT DOES.
[000:37:33;150] HE HAS GIVEN THE CHINESE A
[000:37:35;720] HUGE THING IN THE GAME.
[000:37:36;654] HE IS A FORMER C.I.A.
[000:37:38;456] OPERATIVE.
[000:37:39;123] I'M TELLING YOU WITH HIS
[000:37:40;324] ATTITUDE AND WAY HE HAS
[000:37:41;826] TALKED ABOUT AND HE IS
[000:37:43;628] DISGRUNTLED AND I SUSPECT
[000:37:46;163] HE HAS INFORMATION FROM
[000:37:47;198] C.I.A.
[000:37:48;032] RIGHT NOW, NSA IS PANICKING
[000:37:50;368] BECAUSE EVERYTHING HE TOOK
[000:37:51;802] THEY KNOW.
[000:37:52;303] ALL THE STUFF DOWNLOADED
[000:37:54;171] THEY ARE GOING BACK AND
[000:37:56;574] CHECKING AND RIGHT NOW,
[000:37:59;210] REPRESENTATIVE KING, NOW
[000:38:00;878] THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
[000:38:03;514] HE HAS DONE BECAUSE WE TO
[000:38:06;017] DO DAMAGE CONTROL.
[000:38:07;151] >> Harris: I DO WANT TO
[000:38:08;786] TELL OUR VIEWERS, YOU AND I
[000:38:10;021] WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT
[000:38:11;289] THE PROGRAM THAT THE NSA
[000:38:12;623] WAS RUNNING AS BEING AN
[000:38:14;191] OVERREACH IN YOUR OPINION?
[000:38:16;294] >> RIGHT.
[000:38:16;861] >> Harris: AS I UNDERSTAND
[000:38:18;229] IT YOU WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED
[000:38:22;566] EDWARD SNOWDEN HAD HE COME
[000:38:24;902] TO YOU?
[000:38:26;070] >> AS MUCH AS I THINK
[000:38:28;773] SENATOR PAUL AND OTHERS
[000:38:30;908] HAVE LEGITIMATE CRITICISM
[000:38:31;742] AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE
[000:38:32;643] DEBATE.
[000:38:33;110] WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A
[000:38:34;412] DEBATE IN THE OPEN.
[000:38:35;513] WITH THAT SAID,
[000:38:36;947] REPRESENTATIVE KING IS
[000:38:37;548] CORRECT, HE HAD NO RIGHT TO
[000:38:40;885] UNILATERALLY ON HIS OWN
[000:38:42;086] WITHOUT CHECKING OR ANYBODY
[000:38:45;056] WITHIN HIS CHAIN OF COMMAND
[000:38:46;824] TO GO PUBLIC ON THIS.
[000:38:47;892] I WENT PUBLIC AFTER
[000:38:49;560] CONGRESS GAVE ME PERMISSION
[000:38:51;329] TO DO THAT.
[000:38:52;630] THIS GUY DID NOT WANTED TO
[000:38:56;167] DO DAMAGE.
[000:38:57;001] HE HAS DONE DAMAGE AND DO
[000:38:58;636] MORE BY THE FACT HE IS
[000:39:01;138] SITTING IN CHINA.
[000:39:03;741] >> YOU WATCH HIM IN THIS
[000:39:05;276] INTERVIEW BY THE GUARDIAN
[000:39:06;711] NEWSPAPER, IT'S JUST WHY HE
[000:39:08;446] FELT THE DESPERATE NEED TO
[000:39:10;348] COME FORWARD.
[000:39:10;881] ONE OF THE THINGS, THE WAY
[000:39:14;285] THEY WERE COLLECTING
[000:39:15;720] INFORMATION ON EVERYDAY
[000:39:16;754] AMERICANS, HE THOUGHT IT
[000:39:18;289] COULD POSSIBLY FALL INTO
[000:39:20;057] THE WRONG HANDS.
[000:39:22;727] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:39:24;895] ANYBODY IN THE POSITION
[000:39:26;330] WITH ACCESS TECHNICAL
[000:39:28;933] CAPABILITIES I HAD COULD
[000:39:30;601] SUCK OUT SECRETS AND PASS
[000:39:31;969] THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET TO
[000:39:33;504] RUSSIA.
[000:39:34;004] THEY HAVE AN OPEN DOOR AS
[000:39:35;806] WE DO.
[000:39:36;140] >> Harris: IS HE RIGHT?
[000:39:37;408] >> NO, HE IS NOT.
[000:39:38;943] HE IS ESSENTIALLY, LIKE A
[000:39:42;747] MASTER AD MAN OVERSEEING
[000:39:47;852] I.T. -- I THINK HE HAS
[000:39:50;221] ACCESS TO BRIEFINGS.
[000:39:51;889] WE NEVER LEFT BRIEFING ON A
[000:39:54;291] NETWORK OR BECAUSE OF THIS
[000:39:56;293] POTENTIAL HAPPENING.
[000:39:56;861] HE IS NOT INVOLVED.
[000:39:57;628] HE IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE
[000:39:59;029] TEAM RUNNING THESE THINGS.
[000:40:01;399] SO AS MUCH AS I THINK THERE
[000:40:03;434] MAY BE VALID CONCERNS
[000:40:05;302] REGARDING THE ASKING OF THE
[000:40:07;705] PROGRAM, HE IS AN ADMIN
[000:40:10;608] GUY.
[000:40:11;242] HE HAD PROBLEMS IN THE ARMY,
[000:40:13;043] HE BROKE HIS LEGS.
[000:40:14;178] DIDN'T LIKE THE C.I.A. WAS
[000:40:15;946] RUNNING OPERATIONS.
[000:40:17;481] UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE
[000:40:18;482] GUY IS DISGRUNTLED.
[000:40:20;084] IT'S NOT ABOUT FIXING
[000:40:21;886] THINGS.
[000:40:22;219] IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO POKE
[000:40:23;921] SOMEONE IN THE EYE WITHOUT
[000:40:25;623] ANY INTEREST TO FIX WHAT
[000:40:28;025] WAS BROKEN.
[000:40:28;592] >> Harris: WHEN GREENWALD
[000:40:30;594] AND THE JOURNALIST FROM THE
[000:40:31;862] GUARDIAN WHO BROUGHT THIS
[000:40:33;731] INFORMATION TO THE WORLD
[000:40:36;100] CLAIM TO HAVE MORE, IF
[000:40:37;802] THERE ARE OTHER AMERICANS
[000:40:41;372] IN EDWARD NODEN'S SHOES AND
[000:40:44;108] THEY HAVE INFORMATION TO
[000:40:44;942] GET OUT THERE, WHAT WOULD
[000:40:46;143] YOU TELL THEM AT THIS
[000:40:47;745] POINT?
[000:40:48;078] >> I ADMIRE WHAT GLENN N
[000:40:52;249] DOES.
[000:40:52;750] IN THIS CASE HE IS WRONG.
[000:40:55;653] UNFORTUNATELY HE DOES HAVE
[000:40:57;121] MORE INFORMATION.
[000:40:57;621] I DON'T THINK HE HAS OTHER
[000:40:59;390] SOURCES, I THINK SNOWDEN
[000:41:02;293] HAS GIVEN FAR MORE TO HIM
[000:41:03;894] THAN HE IS WILLING TO
[000:41:05;029] ADMIT.
[000:41:05;996] THIS IS GOING TO BE
[000:41:08;232] TREASURE TROVE OF STUFF
[000:41:09;667] COMING OUT THE COMING
[000:41:10;801] WEEKS.
[000:41:11;702] NSA IS PRETTY MUCH AWARE
[000:41:15;206] WHAT HE TOOK WITH HIM.
[000:41:18;309] >> Harris: I TELL YOU, WHEN
[000:41:20;044] YOU AND I WERE GOING TO
[000:41:22;780] TALK SPEAK ABOUT OVERREACH
[000:41:23;981] BUT YOU HAVE GIVEN US THE
