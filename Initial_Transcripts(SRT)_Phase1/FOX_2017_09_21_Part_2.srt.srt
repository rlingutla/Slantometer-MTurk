ELECTRICITY TO THE ISLAND AND   

121
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,968
BROUGHT DOWN CELL PHONE TOWERS  
AND LEAVING MOST PEOPLE UNABLE  

122
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,038
TO CALL FOR HELP OR CALL FOR    
FAMILY MEMBERS.                 

123

MORE IMAGES TO SHARE IN THE     
SLIDE SHOW THIS AFTERNOON.      

124
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,912
THIS IS TYPICAL DAMAGE, I'M     
TOLD.                           

125
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,814

THE SAME AREA, AMBULANCES       
TRAPPED UNDER THE COLLAPSED

LOOK AT THAT.                   

129
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,726
THINK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO 
FREE UP THIS ROAD AND FREE UP   

130
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,596
THE POWER LINES?                
THERE'S A WHOLE ISLAND LIKE     

131
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,165
THAT.                           
HERE'S WHAT'S LEFT OF A HOUSE   

132
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:26,705
NEXT TO THE SOUTHERN COAST.     
THE ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR  

133
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,140
SAID IT WILL BE A HISTORIC      
EVENT.                          

134
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:36,882
AND THIS IS NEAR PUNTA CANA.    
YOU CAN SEE A DAMAGED RESTAURANT

135
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,851
IN THE AREA.                    
A CATEGORY THREE STORM BY THE

SPREAD DAMAGE IN ST. CROIX AND  

144
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:19,424
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.        
IT WAS A CAT FIVE MONSTER WHEN  

145
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:25,430
IT PASSED OVER-TUESDAY.

MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR BALCONIES.

THEY'RE WITHOUT ELECTRIC POWER. 
PEOPLE TRUDGING THROUGH THIS

OLDER PEOPLE GETTING HELP.      

151
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:52,757
IT'S TOUGH TO SEE PEOPLE WALK   
THROUGH WITH CHILDREN ON THEIR  

152
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,858
BACKS OR CARRYING THEIR ITEMS IN
PLASTIC.                        

153
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:58,530

WOOD WITH MACHETES AND HAMMERS  

154
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:05,403
AND BUILD A COOKOUT.

THE ROOFS, THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT 

160
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:29,961
GETTING ANYTHING.               
IT'S A DO-IT-YOURSELF OPERATION.

161
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:33,031
IT'S PEOPLE TAKING RUBBISH FROM 
HURRICANE IRMA AND TRYING TO USE

162
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,202
IT TO PROP UP A POWER LINE THAT 
WAS DOWNED BY HURRICANE MARIA.  

163
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,870
USING ONE HURRICANE TO HELP     
ANOTHER.                        

164
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,107

FROM THE COAST GUARD.           

165
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:47,579
RIGHT NOW MOODS ARE GOOD HERE.  
THE PEOPLE ARE RESILIENT.       

166
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,080
WITHOUT HELP QUICKLY, THAT COULD

HURRICANE'S PATH.

WINDS 20 TO 50 MILES AN HOUR.   
STILL MORE RAIN HERE.           

174

FLOODING.                       
THE TURKS AND CAICOS, IT WILL   

175

TROPICAL STORM JOSE.            

177
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,447
UP HERE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.   
THAT HAS CREATED A WEAKNESS IN  

178
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,150
THE ATMOSPHERE.                 
IT'S GOING TO ALLOW MARIA TO    

179
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,386
MOVE TO THE NORTH.

AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

182
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,299
GOING TO STAY BETWEEN THAT AREA.
IT'S A SLOW-MOVING STORM.

      Is that whole thing

284
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,173
       -they took forever       
       to pay you, right?

   No, I got paid right away,

      of it all, my agent-      

287
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,644
      -wouldn't even call       
        you back, right?

00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:30,147
ASSOCIATED PRESS.               
THIS IS A REVERSAL ON FACEBOOK'S

00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,183
PART.                           
ZUCKERBERG IS SAYING WE HAVE TO

333
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,090

THE SAME THING.                 

334
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,026
>> THAT'S RIGHT.                
SO THIS IS A BIG REVERSAL FOR   

335
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,095
THEM.                           
PREVIOUSLY THEY DECIDED THEY    

336
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,631
WEREN'T GOING TO TURN OVER THE  
CONTENTS OF THE ADS THAT THEY   

337
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:52,503
TRACED BACK TO RUSSIAN FIRMS    
THAT WRITE POLITICAL, ON TOPICS 

338
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,840
THAT WERE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL  
ISSUES TARGETED DURING THE      

339
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,142
CAMPAIGN.                       
A BIG TOPIC OF INTEREST FOR THE 

340
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,212
COMMITTEES AND LEADERS OF THE   
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE   

341
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:06,150
HAD BEEN TURNING OVER FOR THEM  
TO TURN OVER THE CONTENTS TO ARE

342
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:09,653
YOU VERY THEM AND SEE IF THE ADS
WERE TARGETED AT SPECIFIC       

343
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,590
GROUPS.                         
>> AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN 

344
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,893
TARGETED TOWARDS SPECIFIC       
GROUPS, WHETHER SOMEBODY LED THE

345
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:19,563
RUSSIANS TOWARD THAT.           
THAT IS THE HEART OF THIS       

346
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,866
INVESTIGATION, IS IT NOT?       
>> THAT'S RIGHT.                

347
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,703
AS THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE       
LOOKING AT THE RUSSIAN          

348
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:32,009
INTERFERENCE IN THE ELECTION BUT
LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS      

349
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,577
ANYBODY ON THE AMERICAN SIDE TO 
DIRECT WHERE THE ADS WOULD BE   

350
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,613
TARGETED.                       
ONE OF THE MAIN THING THEY'RE   

351
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,784
LOOKING AT, IF THEY'RE TARGETED 
AT SPECIFIC GROUPS THAT COULD   

352
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,920
DECREASE VOTER TURNOUT FOR      
HILLARY CLINTON OR INCREASE     

353
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:47,191
TURNOUT FOR TRUMP.              
SO WHAT THE COMMITTEES          

354
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:51,028
PARTICULARLY LOOKED AT, THAT'S  
SOMETHING THAT AN AMERICAN      

355
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:55,099
POLITICAL OPERATIVE WOULD KNOW. 
SO THAT'S OF PARTICULAR INTEREST

356
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:58,869
TO THEM AND LOOKING FOR WHETHER 
THERE WAS ANY COORDINATION      

357
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:03,307
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND  
RUSSIANS IS PART OF THIS RUSSIAN

358
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,443
INTERFERENCE.                   
SO FAR THE COMMITTEES HAVE SAID 

359
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,979
WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE OF          
COORDINATION BUT THEY HAVEN'T   

360
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,617
SAID ANYTHING CONCLUSIVELY.     
>> Shepard: WHICH TAKES US BACK 

361
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:18,656
TO PAUL MANAFORT WHO WAS WITH   
THE CAMPAIGN FOR A SHORT PERIOD 

362
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,292
OF TIME.                        
AT ANY RATE, IT'S CLEAR TO      

363
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:26,897
INVESTIGATORS THAT HE OFFERED A 
PRIVATE BRIEFING TO A RUSSIAN   

364
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,199
BILLIONAIRE WITH CLOSE TIES TO  
VLADIMIR PUTIN.                 

365
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:33,971
IT APPEARS THE FEDS WANT TO KNOW
WHY HE DID THAT AND A LOT ELSE. 

366
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:40,377
>> RIGHT.                       
SO YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN OFF OF A

367
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,681
BRIEFING FOR A RUSSIAN          
BILLIONAIRE WHO HAS BEEN        

368
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,716
DESCRIBED AS BEING CLOSE TO     
PUTIN.                          

369
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,086
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS     
DESCRIBED IN AN E-MAIL BETWEEN  

370
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:54,625
POWELL MANAFORT AND A FORMER    
WORKER OR FORMER EMPLOYEE OF HIS

371
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,729
A UKRAINIAN NATIONAL THAT WORKED
WITH HIM ON POLITICAL CONSULTING

372
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,599
IN THE UKRAINE.                 
SO WE DON'T KNOW -- WHAT WE     

373
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:06,770
DON'T KNOW YET, A LOT WE DON'T  
KNOW ABOUT THIS POINT, WHETHER  

374
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:13,577
THAT OFFER WENT TO THE RUSSIANS.
THE STORY WAS BROKE YET AND IT  

375
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,247
WAS NOTED THERE WERE NO         
BRIEFINGS THAT OCCURRED OR      

376
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:21,652
WHETHER THIS OFFER WAS ACTUALLY 
PASSED TO THE RUSSIANS.         

377
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:26,423
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE     
E-MAILS ARE LEGITIMATE AND      

378
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,859
ROBERT MUELLER HAS THEM IN HIS  
POSSESSION AS WELL AS           

379
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,428
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES.       
THEY'LL LOOK AT THIS WHEN THEY  

380
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:36,267
LOOK AT DIRECT TIES OR LINKS    
BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND  

381
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,768
RUSSIANS.                       
>> Shepard: THE BIG PICTURE     

382
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,905
QUESTION, WAS SOMEONE WITHIN THE
CAMPAIGN DIRECTING THE RUSSIANS 

383
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,208
WHERE TO PLACE THE ADS TO HELP  
DONALD TRUMP GET ELECTED AND    

384
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:48,345
HURT HILLARY CLINTON'S CHANCES  
TO THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE       

385
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,048
ANSWER.                         
BUT THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS   

386
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:55,519
WORKING ON IT NOW.              
CHAD DAY FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS. 

387
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,788

         Nobody's hurt,

 but there will still be pain.  

397
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,617
   It comes when your insurance 
   company says they'll only pay

398
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:43,287
     three-quarters of what     
    it takes to replace it.
