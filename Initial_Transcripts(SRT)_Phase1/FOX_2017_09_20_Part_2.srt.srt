MASSIVE PILE OF DEBRIS.         

8
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:32,398
 ST INCREDIBLE THE WORK THEY'RE 
DOING WITH SO MANY BUILDINGS

00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,327
THOSE BURIED UNDER THE CONCRETE

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,149
I HAVE TO SAY WE'LL BE DOING A  
LOT OF TRADING WITH THE UNITED  

22
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,717

WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT.          

23
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,088
WE HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW EACH

>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.    

26
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:38,697
GOOD TO BE HERE.                
AS YOU SAY, WE'VE HAD MANY      

27
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,833
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN             
REPRESENTATIVES AND OURSELVES ON

28
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:44,803
A WHOLE VARIETY OF ISSUES,

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,040
IMPORTANT FOR US AND OTHER      
ISSUES, FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES,  

30
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:52,077
SECURITY AND DEFENSE            
RELATIONSHIP, WHICH IS THE      

31
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,580
CLOSEST THAT WE HAVE.

>> THANK YOU.                   

34
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:23,876

QUESTIONS ANSWERED TODAY.       

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,378
LIVE PICTURES FROM MEXICO CITY  
WHERE STREET RESCUES ARE        

36
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,680
UNDERWAY, A SPLIT SCREEN HERE ON
THE RIGHT.                      

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,251
YOU CAN SEE THE STREETS OF THE  
CITY AND ON THE LEFT IS THE SPOT

38
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,921
WHERE THEY'RE SEARCHING FOR ANY 
POSSIBLE SURVIVORS FROM THE     

39
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,957
SCHOOL THAT COLLAPSED THERE.    
OUR CORRESPONDENT, JONATHAN HUNT

40
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,361
IS IN MEXICO CITY NEAR A        
COLLAPSED BUILDING WHERE WE'RE  

41
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,130
HEARING THERE MAY BE PEOPLE     
TRAPPED THERE AS WELL, JONATHAN?

42
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,300
>> YEAH, SHEP.                  
WE JUST ARRIVED IN MEXICO CITY  

43
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,570
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.              
WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE            

44
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,438
COMMUNICATIONS.                 
WE'RE GETTING YOU A PICTURE AT  

45
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,041
THIS POINT.                     
LET ME PAINT THE PICTURE FOR    

46
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,878
YOU.                            
I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF WHAT   

47
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,014
WAS A FIVE-STORY APARTMENT      
BUILDING.                       

48
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:06,318
EACH STORY OF THE BUILDING      
PANCAKED DOWN ON TO EACH OTHER  

49
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,520
RIGHT NOW.                      
SO IT NOW STANDS WHAT WOULD HAVE

50
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:14,459
BEEN ABOUT TWO STORIES HIGH.    
ALTHOUGH FIVE CRUSHED INTO EACH 

51
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,563
OTHER.                          
WE'RE TOLD THERE WAS LIKE 40    

52
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:23,101
APARTMENTS IN THAT BUILDING.    
RESCUERS ARE SWARMING AROUND IT 

53
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,305
RIGHT NOW TRYING TO FIND ANYBODY
THAT STILL MAY BE ALIVE IN THE  

54
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,639
RUBBLE.                         
THEY'VE BEEN BRINGING OUT A     

55
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,743
NUMBER OF BODIES TO THE BODIES  
OF TWO CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE    

56
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,514
BROUGHT OUT A SHORT TIME AGO.   
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE   

57
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,583
HERE.                           
A LOT OF OFFICIAL REFUGEE       

58
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,118
WORKERS OBVIOUSLY.              
I HAVE TO SAY ONE OF THE        

59
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,122
STRIKING THINGS WHEN YOU ARRIVE 
IN MEXICO CITY IS THE NUMBER OF 

60
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,292
VOLUNTEERS, THE NUMBER OF       
ORDINARY MEXICAN CITIZENS       

61
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,696
RUSHING TO HELP.                
WE DROVE HERE FROM THE AIRPORT, 

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,901
SHEP, IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES.  
LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PICKUPS,  

63
00:03:56,035 --> 00:04:00,572
MOTOR BIKES GETTING ALONG AS    
FAST AS THEY CAN.               

64
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,743
THOSE PICKUP TRUCKS OF MOTOR    
BIKES LOADED WITH PEOPLE JUST   

65
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,045
WANTING TO HELP.                
THEY'RE CARRYING SHOVELS,       

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,582
ANYTHING THAT MAY BE OF USE AS  
THEY TRY TO PERFORM THE RESCUES 

67
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,518
AROUND THIS CITY RIGHT NOW.     
WE'RE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF   

68
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,588
THE CITY, WHICH IS WARDS WHERE  
THE SCHOOL IS THAT YOU'RE       

69
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,659
TALKING ABOUT.                  
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE 

70
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:24,296
SCENES BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY  
CHILDREN STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR. 

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,000
THAT DIGGING WILL GO ON         
OBVIOUSLY UNTIL THEY HAVE       

72
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,435
ACCOUNTED FOR EVERYBODY WHO MAY 
HAVE BEEN IN THAT SCHOOL.       

73
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,939
THE SAME WITH THE BUILDING I'M  
STANDING IN FRONT OF RIGHT NOW. 

74
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:39,044
THE SAME WITH ALL OF THE 40 OR  
SO BUILDINGS THAT COLLAPSED HERE

75
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:45,384
IN MEXICO CITY.                 
                                

76
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,286
 THE PRESIDENT HAS DECLARED     
THREE DAYS OF MOURNING.         

77
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,223
IT'S RIGHT NOW A RESCUE         
OPERATION.                      

78
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:57,262
THE FOCUS IS FINDING PEOPLE     
UNDER THIS RUBBLE WHO MAY STILL 

79
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,165
BE ALIVE.                       
WE'RE TOLD, AS YOU LOOK AT THE  

80
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,101
PICTURES OF THE SCHOOL, THE     
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE       

81
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,906
SOUTHERN PART OF MEXICO CITY,   
THAT THEY FOUND ONE YOUNG GIRL  

82
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,741
ALIVE.                          
THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST TO GET 

83
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,445
TO HER.                         
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A VERY, VERY    

84
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,415
DIFFICULT OPERATION.            
A VERY DANGEROUS OPERATION.     

85
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,485
WHEN RESCUE WORKERS GO IN TO    
PERFORM THE OPERATIONS AS WE SAW

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,523
A FEW YEARS AGO IN HAITI,       
THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT  

87
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,225
RISK.                           
ONE WRONG MOVE, ONE WRONG PIECE 

88
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,063
OF CONCRETE OR ONE PIECE OF     
TIMBER MOVES AND MORE OF THE    

89
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,899
BUILDING CAN COME DOWN          
ENDANGERING THE LIVES OF THE    

90
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,868
RESCUE WORKERS.                 
IT'S A TENSE, DIFFICULT         

91
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,071
OPERATION, SHEP.                
>> Shepard: JONATHAN HUNT IN    

92
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:44,943
MEXICO CITY.                    
LIVE REPORTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

93
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:50,015
BACK TO CONTINUING COVERAGE OF  
HURRICANE MARIA PUMMELLING      

94
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,984
PUERTO RICO AND ST. CROIX AND   
OTHERS.                         

95
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,022
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW DEALING  
WITH ITS THIRD NATURAL DISASTER 

96
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:01,426
IN LESS THAN A MONTH.           
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPROVED AN 

97
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,397
EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR PUERTO
RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.    

98
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,967
THE MONSTER STORM COULD COST    
BILLIONS IN DAMAGE ACROSS THE   

99
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,336
CARIBBEAN.                      
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DEVASTATION

100
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,638
THAT HURRICANE IRMA HAS JUST    
LEFT BEHIND.                    

101
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,908
LET'S GO TO BROCK LONG NOW FROM 
FEMA WHO BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP

102
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,545
BY PHONE ON HURRICANE MARIA.    
SIR, NICE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.    

103
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,118
HOW IS THE BRIEFING?            
>> THE PRESIDENT REMAINS VERY   

104
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,822
ENGAGED AND HIS MESSAGE IS TAKE 
CARE OF PEOPLE.                 

105
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:35,560
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.        
WE KEPT 3,200 STAFF ON THE U.S. 

106
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,997
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO. 
THAT IS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT     

107
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,033
TEAMS TO MEDICAL TEAMS TO SEARCH
AND RESCUE TEAMS.               

108
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,104
THEY'RE STARTING TO DEPLOY OUT  
AS THE STORM -- ELEMENTS OF THE 

109
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,008
STORM PASS THROUGH.             
AND THEN WE'RE PREPARED TO OPEN 

110
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,279
UP AIRPORTS AND THE SHIPPING    
PORTS TO CONTINUE WITH MORE     

111
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,481
TEAMS AND COMMODITIES COMING IN 
UP.                             

112
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,518
>> Shepard: WHAT KIND OF REPORTS
SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GETTING    

113
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:04,322
FROM THE TEAMS FANNING OUT?     
>> SO IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AS  

114
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,126
THE SYSTEM PASSED TO THE SOUTH  
OF THE ISLANDS LAST NIGHT, THE  

115
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,963
WINDS EXPANDED AND THEY         
BASICALLY -- THEY HAD UP TO     

116
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,801
ABOUT 137 MILES PER HOUR WINDS. 
SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOF      

117
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,502
DAMAGE.                         
THEY DO HAVE DAMAGE TO THEIR    

118

00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,938
HISTORIC NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.
THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT DECISION

231
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:32,076
IS HIS TO KNOW FOR NOW.         
>> HAVE YOU DECIDED TO STAY OR  

232
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,679
LEAVE?                          
>> I HAVE DECIDED.              

233
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,516
>> WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?       
>> I'LL LET YOU KNOW.           

234
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,788
>> Shepard: HE WILL LET US KNOW.
HE MADE A COMMENT WITH A MEETING

235
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,091
WITH MAHMOUD ABBAS.             
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENT ON THE  

236
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:53,898
IRAN DEAL AFTER HE CALLED IT AN 
EMBARRASSMENT DURING A SPEECH TO

237
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,402
THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL      
ASSEMBLY.                       

238
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,573
THE PRESIDENT OF IRAN TOOK A    
SHOT BACK.                      

239
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,476
>> IT WILL BE A PERIOD OF       
DISAGREEMENT IN THE WORLD OF    

240
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,412
POLITICS.                       
THE WORLD WILL HAVE LOST A GREAT

241
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,949
OPPORTUNITY.                    
BUT SUCH UNFORTUNATE BEHAVIOR   

242
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:16,187
WILL NEVER IMPEDE IRAN'S COURSE 
OF PROGRESS AND ADVANCEMENT.    

243
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,258
>> Shepard: ROGUE NEWCOMERS TO  
THE WORLD OF POLITICS.          

244
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:25,830
OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE           
CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS IS   

245
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,932
HERE.                           
THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.          

246
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:33,872
>> THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF        
DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE JCP,     

247
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,876
JOINT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF     
ACTION.                         

248
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,946
THE CONVERSATIONS ARE CAN THE   
DEAL BE REOPENED.               

249
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:48,987
THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF SIX 
SIGNATORS TO THE DEAL.          

250
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:55,226
IF YOU CAN'T GET A BETTER DEAL, 
IS THE PRESIDENT BETTER TO PULL 

251
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,528
OUT.                            
AS A CANDIDATE, THE PRESIDENT   

252
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,330
SAID HE WAS GOING TO SCRAP THE  
DEAL.                           

253
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:02,533
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS           
RECERTIFIED THAT IRAN IS        

254
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:07,171
COMPLYING WITH THE DEAL AS      
ANOTHER DEADLINE COMES UP AS    

255
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,076
SOME ARE SAYING THE PRESIDENT   
WILL CONSIDER THE DECISION.     

256
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:16,547
THE WHITE HOUSE'S VIEW OF THE   
DEAL, IT ONLY DEALS WITH IRAN   

257
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:24,989
AND THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND     
DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE SUPPORT   

258
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:31,062
FOR TERROR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.    
YESTERDAY HE SAID AT THE U.N.,  

259
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:36,935
THE IRANIAN RESPOND TODAY BY    
SAYING THE FOLLOWING.           

260
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:44,409
>> IGNORANT, ABSURD AND HATEFUL 
RHETORIC FILLED WITH            

261
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,412
RIDICULOUSLY BASELESS           
ALLEGATIONS.                    

262
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:52,083
>> ABSURD HATEFUL RHETORIC.     
WE REPORT, YOU DECIDE.          

263
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,620
THE PRESIDENT HAS TAKEN SOME    
OTHER STEPS WITH REGARDS TO IRAN

264
00:15:55,754 --> 00:16:00,291
OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME WORK OF THE
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT UNILATERALLY  

265
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:04,896
IMPOSED SANCTIONS.              
IF HE DECIDED TO STAY IN THE    

266
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:13,771
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THE WHITE    
HOUSE COULD TAKE MORE STEPS TO  

267
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,307
REIGN IN IRAN'S BAD BEHAVIOR.   
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.            

268
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:22,814
>> AND THEY TALKED ABOUT THE    
MIDEAST PEACE DEAL.             

269
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,851
>> THE PRESIDENT MET WITH       
MAHMOUD ABBAS AND THE KING OF   

270
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,253
JORDAN.                         
HE MET WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME   

271
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,322
MINISTER.                       
THE PRESIDENT HAS A LOT INVESTED

272
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:37,028
IN THIS.                        
HIS SON-IN-LAW, JARED KUSHNER IS

273
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,931
THE POINT PERSON ON THIS.       
THEY HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF      

274
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,434
VISITS TO THE REGION.           
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. 

275
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,004
THE PRESIDENT HOLDING OUT HOPE  
THAT SOMETHING MAY BE POSSIBLE. 

276
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,172
LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID THIS     
MORNING.                        

277
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,009
>> WE'RE AT A VERY IMPORTANT    
JUNCTURE.                       

278
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:55,279
A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME AND WE'RE
GOING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.    

279
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,350
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT
IT AND IT'S NEVER HAPPENED.     

280
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,020
WE'RE FIGHTING VERY HARD.       
>> HE'S OPTIMISTIC.             

281
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:06,524
SHOULD WE GO THROUGH THE LIST OF
PRESIDENTS THAT WERE HOPEFUL AND

282
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:12,430
CAME AWAY WITH NOTHING.         
>> Shepard: IT'S A LONG ONE.    

283
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:19,370
>> IT IS.                       
>> Shepard: MICHAEL CROWLEY FROM

284
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,372
POLITCO.                        
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MICHAEL.       

285
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:26,377
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME, SHEP.  
>> Shepard: WHAT IS THE         

286
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:31,282
REPORTING WHERE WE ARE IN THIS. 
PULLING OUT HAS ENORMOUS        

287
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,150
CHALLENGES.                     
>> THAT'S RIGHT.                

288
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:37,789
SOME CRITICS OF THE DEAL, SOME  
THAT OPPOSED IT AT THE TIME THAT

289
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,892
IT WAS SEALED WITH SEVERAL      
COUNTRIES AS JOHN POINTED OUT,  

290
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,929
EVEN SOME OPPONENTS OF DOING    
THAT NOW SAY IT'S TOO LATE.     

291
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:50,334
THE COST OF UNDOING THIS DEAL   
ARE MUCH GREATER THAN TO OPPOSED

292
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,770
THE DEAL.                       
IRAN GOT A LOT OF FINANCIAL     

293
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,672
BENEFITS.                       
AS SOON AS THE DEAL WAS STRUCK  

294
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:59,310
IN JULY 2015, IRAN GOT BILLIONS 
OF IMMEDIATE PAY-OFF.           

295
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,778
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CLAW THAT
BACK.                           

296
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:12,223
IN FACT, CIA DIRECTOR MIKE      
POMPEO SPOKE TO BRET BAIER.     

297
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,859
BRET SAID YOU WERE A STRONG     
CRITIC.                         

298
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,728
AND POMPEO SAID THINGS LOOK     
DIFFERENT NOW BEING ON THE OTHER

299
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,099
SIDE OF THE DESK AND THE        
ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED.        

300
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,501
THE DEAL IS SIGNED.             
IRAN GOT THE BENEFITS.          

301
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:28,039
THOSE THAT DIDN'T LIKE THE DEAL 
ARE CAUTIOUS ABOUT BLOWING IT UP

302
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,774
RIGHT NOW.                      
>> Shepard: WILL THERE REAL     

303
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,044
INDICATORS THAT THEY'RE CHEATING
OR IS THE CONSENSUS THAT THINGS 

304
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,747
ARE GOING AS WELL AS COULD BE   
EXPECTED?                       

305
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,917
>> YOU KNOW, I GUESS WHAT YOUR  
DEFINITION OF CHEATING IS.      

306
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,888
THE INTERNATIONAL A COMIC ENERGY
AGENCY INSPECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN

307
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:49,193
GOING TO IRAN AND HAVE THIS VERY
SPECIFIC CHECKLIST OF TECHNICAL 

308
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,496
METRICS SAY THAT IRAN IS NOT    
CHEATING.                       

309
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,666
THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE.          
THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT IRAN GOT 

310
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,870
A LITTLE ABOVE THE AMOUNT OF    
HEAVY WATER THEY WERE SUPPOSED  

311
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,073
TO HAVE ON HAND.                
IF YOU TALK THE PEOPLE THAT     

312
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:06,611
ARE -- FOLLOW THIS CLOSELY, THEY
SAY IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

313
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,447
THE IAEA SAYS THEY'RE IN        
COMPLIANCE.                     

314
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,884
THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE, TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS,       

315
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,653
CONSERVATIVE, ISRAELI OFFICIALS 
SAY IT'S THE WRONG WAY TO THINK 

316
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,756
ABOUT IT.                       
THAT IT'S BROADER THAN THIS.    

317
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,925
IRANIAN BEHAVIOR YOU HAVE TO    
LOOK AT.                        

318
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,229
ARE THEY BECOMING MORE OF A     
CIVILIZED NATION THAT OBEYS THE 

319
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,965
SORT OF RULES OF THE ROAD       
INTERNATIONALLY.                

320
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,069
THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.       
THE DEAL SORT OF OBLIGATED IRAN 

321
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,373
TO BEHAVE BETTER IN THEIR       
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEREFORE      

322
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,509
THEY'RE NOT HONORING WHAT SOME  
TRUMP OFFICIALS HAVE CALLED THE 

323
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,547
SPIRIT OF THE DEAL.             
THE FRIENDS THAT SERVED UNDER   

324
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,884
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THE DEAL   
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IRANIAN  

325
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,689
BEHAVIOR, THE METRICS, THE      
RESEARCH, THE URANIUM ON HAND.  

326
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:56,928
THAT'S THE OPINION RIGHT NOW.   
>> MICHAEL CROWLEY FORE POLITCO.

327
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,596
THANK YOU.                      
>> THANKS, SHEP.                

328
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,264
>> Shepard: THE TOP REPUBLICAN  
IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SAYS

329
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,770
HE PLANS TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE 
LATEST GOP HEALTHCARE PLAN.     

330
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:09,974
BUT HE CAN LOSE ONLY ONE MORE   
REPUBLICAN VOTE AND STILL PASS  

331
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,210
THE BILL.                       
TODAY THE FORMER PRESIDENT      

332
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,779
BARACK OBAMA WEIGHED IN ON THIS 
MATTER.                         

333
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,548
ON THE BATTLE OVER HIS OWN      
HEALTHCARE LAW.                 

334
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,152
WE'LL GO LIVE TO CAPITOL HILL   
AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WATCH IN

335
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,189
MEXICO CITY WHERE THE SEARCH IS 
ON FOR SURVIVORS A DAY AFTER THE

336
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:32,029
QUAKE HIT WITH SO MANY WONDERING
WITH BUILDINGS COLLAPSED ALL    

337
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,533
OVER THE COUNTRY, HOW HIGH THE  
DEATH TOLL MAY BE.              

338
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:35,833
                  stimate.      

339
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,202
     I just snapped a photo     

340
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,904
and got an estimate in 24 hours.

341
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,739
      My insurance company      

342
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,441
definitely doesn't have that... 

343
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:45,759
<i>You can leave worry behind when</i> 

344
