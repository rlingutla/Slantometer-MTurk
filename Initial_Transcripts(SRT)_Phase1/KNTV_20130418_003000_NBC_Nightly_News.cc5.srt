SOME FALSE REPORTS TONIGHT BASED

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ON IMAGERY FROM THE SCENE.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
INVESTIGATORS APPEAR TO KNOW WHO

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR.

15

VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE WAHING
FROM THE SENATE GALLERY.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
AND THE PRESIDENT REACTS WITH

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
ANGER.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000

IS MOVING.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
AFTER A DAY OF FITS AND STARTS

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
AND SEVERAL FALSE REPORTS, IT

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
APPEARS THAT FROM A MOUNTAIN OF

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED AN IMAGE, A

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
SERIES OF IMAGES THAT LIKELY
SHOW THE BOMBER THAT POLICE ARE

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
LOOKING FOR.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
PARTS OF BOSTON ARE STILL SHUT

DOWN.

THIS IS THE BOMBING SCENE

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000

PROMISING LEADS.

66

DAYS SINCE THE BOMBING.

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WE ARE GETTING A CLOSE-UP LOOK

71
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
AT HOW THE BOMBS WERE MADE.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000

BACKPACK OR DUFFEL BAG AND

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
PLACING IT AT THE SPOT WHERE ONE

80
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
BOMB WENT OFF.
ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING

81
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
IMAGES, THEY SAY, COMES FROM A

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000

CAMERA HIGH UP ON A BUILDING,

84
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
ABLE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE CROWD.

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
ON A DAY WHEN INCORRECT NEWS

86
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
REPORTS OF AN ARREST DISTRACTED

87
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
OFFICIALS, INVESTIGATORS WERE

88
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO

89
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
DISCOVER, FIND, AND INTERVIEW

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
THAT PERSON.

THAT'S AT THE SCENE OF THE

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
SECOND BOMBING FOLLOWING THE

93
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000

WHILE INVESTIGATORS CANNOT BE
SURE THAT BAG CONTAINED THE BOMB

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
FEDERAL OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THAT IS THE SPOT WHERE THE

100
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
SECOND BOMB WENT OFF.
FORMER ATF BOMB INVESTIGATOR JIM

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
CAVANAUGH SAID IT IS OBVIOUS TO

102
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
HIM LOOKING AT THE PICTURES.

103
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
>> LARGE INJURIES WERE ON THE

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
SIDE OF IT.

105
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
DEBRIS FIELD TO THE LEFT.

RIGHT SIDE THAT INDICATE THE

108
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
BLAST WAS TO ONE SIDE OF THE

109
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
TRASH RECEPTACLE.
THIS WAS THE SCENE OF THE BLAST.

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
>> Reporter: WE ARE ALSO SEEING
CLOSE-UP PHOTOS OF THE ACTUAL

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
PIECES OF THE BOMB.

112
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
SHOWING THE PRESSURE COOKER

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
DEFORMED BY THE BLAST, ONE OF

114
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ITS LIDS BLOWN TO THE TOP OF A

115
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
NEARBY BUILDING.
THEY ARE A FAVORITE OF BOMB

116
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
MAKERS BECAUSE EXPLOSIVE
PRESSURE BUILDS UP BEFORE IT IS

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
RELEASED.
INVESTIGATORS CAN NOW BEGIN TO

118
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
TRACE DOWN WHERE COMPONENTS WERE

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
BOUGHT SINCE THEY KNOW THE MAKER

120
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OF THE PRESSURE COOKER, THE

121
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
TYPE OF RECHARGEABLE FLASHLIGHT

122
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
BATTERIES USED -- MADE IN CHINA,

123
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
BUT WIDELY AVAILABLE --

124
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
AND EVEN THE TYPE OF WIRE --

125
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
ALSO MADE IN CHINA -- USED TO

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
HOOK THE MAIN COMPONENTS
TOGETHER.

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
BOMB TECHNICIANS ARE EXAMINING

128
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
TWO ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
INCLUDED IN THE BOMBS TO SEE
WHETHER THEY WERE PARTS OF

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TIMERS OR RECEIVERS FOR A REMOTE

131
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
DETONATION SIGNAL.

132
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
ALL POTENTIALLY PROMISING LEADS,

133
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
SAYS A BOMB EXPERT.

134
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
>> IT DEPENDS ON HOW UNIQUE THE

135
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BOMB COMPONENTS ARE, HOW

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
IDENTIFIABLE THE CHARACTERISTICS

137
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
ARE, WHAT OTHER FORENSICS

138
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
INVOLVED IN THAT, WHETHER IT BE

139
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
FINGERPRINTS, DNA, ET CETERA.

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
>> Reporter: INVESTIGATORS ARE

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY ARE CLOSE

142
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
TO THE ANSWER OF WHO DID THIS

143
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
AND WHY IN AN INVESTIGATION

144
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
THAT'S MOVING VERY RAPIDLY ON
SEVERAL FRONTS.

145
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
>> ABOUT THAT RAPID SPEED AND

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
OPTIMISM, PETE WILLIAMS, THANKS.
WE WANT TO BRING IN THE FORMER

147
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

148
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER.

149
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
MICHAEL LEITER IS OUR NBC NEWS

150
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST.

151
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
YOU RECEIVED FROM YOUR SOURCES A

152
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
CAUTION TODAY THAT THIS PERHAPS

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
WAS RUNNING ON AHEAD OF ITSELF.

154
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
AND THIS CAN HAVE A BAD EFFECT

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
ON AN INVESTIGATION.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
WITH ALL THE MEDIA REPORTING

157
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ARRESTS, THEY
ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE

158
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
PERSON OR PEOPLE BEING SPOOKED

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
AND THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT

160
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
EXPECTATIONS AT THIS POINT.

161
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
FOR A WHILE PEOPLE WERE SAYING
IT'S NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH.

162
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
NOW PEOPLE EXPECT AN ARREST IN

163
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
THE NEAR HOURS AND THE FACT IS

164
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
KNOWING THE PERSON IT CAN STILL

165
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
TAKE SOME TIME.

166
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
>> NOW ABOUT THE EVIDENCE.

167
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
WE HAVE A BIG HAYSTACK HERE.
SO FAR WE HAVE FOUND SOME OF THE

168
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
NEEDLES DOWN TO THE ZIPPER PULL

169
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
ON WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE BAG

170
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
AND THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY.
WE ALSO HAVE IMAGERY -- TONS OF

171
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
IT -- AND THAT HAS TO BE A BIG

172
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
EARLY HELP.

173
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
>> THAT IS INVALUABLE.

174
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
IT'S SOMETHING EVEN THREE OR

175
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
FOUR YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE

176
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
HAD.

177
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
ALL OF THAT IMAGERY FROM THE

178
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
STORES, THE POLICE AND PEOPLE,

179
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE

180
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
FORENSIC EVIDENCE AND THE SECRET

181
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
INTELLIGENCE WE ARE NOT HEARING

182
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
ABOUT FROM HUMAN INTELLIGENCE

183
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
SOURCES, CELL PHONE RECORDS,

184
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
THINGS LIKE THAT.
THAT PAINTS THE MOSAIC FROM

185
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000

IT ON THE TIP OF AN UMBRELLA AND

492
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
STABBING HIM IN THE LEG.

493
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
ONLY A DROP CAN KILL IN 36 TO 48

494
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
HOURS.
>> IF YOU PURIFY IT, IT CAN

495
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
BECOME MUCH MORE LETHAL.

496
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
