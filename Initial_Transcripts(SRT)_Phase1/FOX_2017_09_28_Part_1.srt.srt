1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:05,838
ONE THAT THEY RIGHTFULLY        
SERVE.                          

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:12,911
>> THANK YOU.                   
YOU SAID THE PLAN WILL ADD $2.2 

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,314
TRILLION TO THE DEFICIT.        
IS IT WRONG?                    

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,317
>> WE THINK THEY'RE WRONG.      
WE THINK THEY'RE WRONG BECAUSE  

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:23,455
THE WAY THEY SCORE.             
BUT LET'S NOT ARGUE THAT.       

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,459
WE OFFICIALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS 
TAX PLAN WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC   

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:31,697
IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.      
WE KNOW THAT 1% CHANGE IN GDP   

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:35,501
WILL ADD $3 TRILLION BACK.      
SO IF THEY'RE RIGHT, WE'RE ONLY 

9
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:41,673
GOING TO PAY DOWN $80 BILLION   
OF THE DEFICIT.                 

10
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:45,244
I'LL LIVE WITH THAT.            
>> THANK YOU, GARY.             

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,180
ON THE CORPORATE SIDE, YOUR     
CRITICS SAY ON THE REPATRIATION 

12
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:53,519
OF OVERSEAS ASSETS THAT HISTORY 
WOULD SHOW THAT COMPANIES DON'T 

13
00:00:53,653 --> 00:01:04,430
ALWAYS USE THE ASSETS WHEN      
THEY'RE REWAIT -- REPATRIATED.  

14
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:10,869
HOW CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT?     
>> IF THAT'S OUR WORSE CASE     

15
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,540
SCENARIO, COMPANIES USE IT FOR  
BUY BACKS AND DIVIDENDS, WHAT   

16
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:21,380
HAPPENS?                        
THEY BUY BACK SHARES AND        

17
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,918
DIVIDENDS WITH GET MORE TAXES ON
GAINS AND DIVIDENDS AND THE     

18
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,821
PEOPLE DO WHAT?                 
THEY REINVESTMENT IN NEW CAPITOL

19
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,857
AND INVESTMENTS.                
WE'RE PUTTING ENTICING RULES    

20
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:35,661
INTO THE SYSTEM THAT WILL ENTICE
PEOPLE TO INVEST CAPITAL THE    

21
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,298
NEXT FIVE YEARS.                
WE'RE GIVING PEOPLE A FIVE-YEAR 

22
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,334
WRITE OFF TO EXPENSE.           
IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT'S FINE.   

23
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,939
WE KNOW THAT MONEY WILL GET     
INVESTED IN THE ECONOMY AND     

24
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:52,911
DRIVE WAGES, GROWTH AND         
PROSPERITY.                     

25
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,314
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKED IT TWICE   
AND YOU DIDN'T ANSWER.          

26
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,250
I GET YOUR MESSAGE ON THE MIDDLE
CLASS.                          

27
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,620
THIS TAX PLAN APPEARS IT WILL   
BENEFIT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS   

28
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,489
FAMILY.                         
WHY NOT BE CANDIDATE ABOUT THAT?

29
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,626
>> I TOLD YOU IT WILL BENEFIT   
THE MIDDLE CLASS.               

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,897
I THINK THAT'S WHAT AMERICAN    
TAXPAYERS CARE ABOUT, WHAT THEY 

31
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,999
TAKE HOME.                      
THEY CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE  

32
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,701
TO SPEND.                       
THAT'S WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT.    

33
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:19,238
THAT'S WHAT I CARE ABOUT.       
I CARE ABOUT -- I BET YOU CARE  

34
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,441
ABOUT WHAT YOU PAY IN TAXES.    
>> HE'S SAYING HE WON'T BENEFIT.

35
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,777
IT APPEARS THE WAY THIS IS PUT  
TOGETHER, HE ACTUALLY WILL.     

36
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,580
GETS TO THE IDEA OF WEALTHY     
AMERICANS AROUND THE COUNTRY    

37
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,716
WHICH PEOPLE DO CARE ABOUT.     
CAN YOU --                      

38
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,619
>> LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH THE  
COMPONENTS THAT YOU'RE OBSESSED 

39
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,255
ON FOR A MINUTE.                
SARAH WILL YELL AT ME.          

40
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,859
I'M TAKING TOO LONG HERE.       
YOU TALK ABOUT THE DEATH TAX.   

41
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,864
THAT BEING A GREAT BENEFIT.     
THE TWO BIGGEST DRIVERS FOR     

42
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:51,103
REPEAL OF THE DEATH TAX ARE THE 
NFIB AND THE FARM BUREAU.       

43
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,871
THAT'S SMALL BUSINESSES AND     
FARMS.                          

44
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,041
THOSE ARE THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS 
THAT SPEND THE MOST TIME        

45
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:00,179
LOBBYING ON THE REPEAL OF THE   
DEATH TAX.                      

46
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,948
DEATH TAX HAS THE BIGGEST EFFECT
ON THEM.                        

47
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,285
SMALL BUSINESSES AND FARMS.     
WEALTHY AMERICANS DO A LOT OF   

48
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,353
ESTATE PLANNING.                
THEY CAN USE TRUSTS.            

49
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:12,925
THEY CAN USE ALL TYPES OF THINGS
THAT ARE LEGAL WITHIN THE TAX   

50
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,694
CODE TO MAKES SURE THEY DON'T   
PAY DEATH TAX.                  

51
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:21,466
ON THE AMT, I'M NOT GOING TO GET
INTO DEEP, DEEP CALCULATIONS ON 

52
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,569
AMT.                            
BUT IN A BROAD BRUSH LEVEL, WHEN

53
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,940
YOU DO THE AMT, ONCE YOU GET RID
OF THE DEDUCTIONS OF STATE AND  

54
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:32,144
LOCAL TAXES, THAT'S THE BIGGEST 
ADD-BACK IN AMT.                

55
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,781
AMT IS IRRELEVANT ONCE YOU GET  
RID OF THE DEDUCTION OF STATE   

56
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,684
AND LOCAL TAXES.                
ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO 

57
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,887
PULL AT, YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT  
THE PLAN IN ITS ENTIRETY.       

58
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:46,725
THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE ONCE WE   
REDO THE PLAN AND SIMPLIFY.     

59
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:54,032
YES.                            
                                

60
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:54,733
                                
BE.                             

61
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,469
>> JUST AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION 
ON THAT.                        

62
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:01,740
YOU SAID THAT -- I CITED TO YOU 
THE WORRY OF GROUPS LIKE JIM    

63
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:05,978
MARTIN AND THE 60-PLUS SENIORS  
ASSOCIATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

64
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,680
DRAG OUT REPEAL OF THE DEATH    
TAX.                            

65
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:13,018
THAT IT WOULDN'T BE IMMEDIATE   
AND YOU SAID AT THE TIME IT WAS 

66
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,019
IMMEDIATE.                      
IS THAT FINAL?                  

67
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:18,357
IS IT AN IMMEDIATE REPEAL AND GO
OFF THE BOOKS AS SOON AS THE NEW

68
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,461
TAX REFORM PACKAGE IS PASSED?   
>> IN OUR OUT LINE, IT'S        

69
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,696
IMMEDIATE.                      
>> THE SAME WITH THE ALTERNATIVE

70
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,199
MINIMUM TAX?                    
>> IT'S IMMEDIATE.              

71
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,669
THE ONLY THING THAT PHASES OUT  
IS THE FIVE-YEAR EXPENSING.     

72
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:38,677
IT'S A FIVE-YEAR EXPENSE.       
>> SPEAKING OF SMALL BUSINESSES,

73
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:42,381
LET'S START NEGOTIATING.        
YESTERDAY SENATOR SCHUMER SAID  

74
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,584
DEMOCRATS MAY BE WILLING TO WORK
SOME KIND OF SMALL BUSINESS TAX 

75
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,753
RELIEF INTO WHATEVER COMES OUT  
OF THIS.                        

76
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,855
WHERE DO YOU START NEGOTIATING  
ON THAT?                        

77
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,925
WHAT OFFER DO YOU WANT TO MAKE  
TO THE DEMOCRATS?               

78
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,696
>> OUR OFFERS -- OUR OPENING    
OFFER AND FINAL OFFER ARE ON THE

79
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,365
TABLE.                          
WE WERE HAPPY TO START AT 25 AND

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,468
GO LOWER.                       
WE'RE HAPPY TO START ON 20 AND  

81
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,338
GO LOWER.                       
THERE'S THE OPENING OFFER.      

82

HE WANTS TO COUNTER SOMETHING   
LOWER, WE'RE NEGOTIABLE.        

83
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,245
THANK YOU.                      
>> THANK YOU, GARY.             

84
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,183
>> BOSS SAYS I HAVE TO GO.      
>> NOW TRY TO BE RESPECTFUL OF  

85
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:26,958
YA'LL'S TIME, WE HAVE TOM       
BOSSERT THAT WILL TAKE HURRICANE

86
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,294
RELIEF EFFORTS.                 
I'LL COME BACK AFTER THAT.      

87
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,430
>> THANKS, SARAH.               
GOOD AFTERNOON.                 

88
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:36,468
AS YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
PUT PEOPLE FIRST AND PAPERWORK  

89
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,104
SECOND.                         
HE'S HAD US PULL OUT THE STOPS  

90
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:44,643
AND PULL OUT AS MUCH FEDERAL    
RELIEF INTO PUERTO RICO AND THE 

91
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,246
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND WE'VE BEEN   
DOING THAT TO MEET HIS          

92
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,782
OBJECTIVES THE LAST EIGHT DAYS. 
I'M HERE TO TAKE QUESTIONS.     

93
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:56,621
I KNOW YOU HEARD REPORTING FROM 
SARAH.                          

94
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,125
>> AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE JONES
ACT, THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF       

95
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,928
ATTENTION THE LAST 72 HOURS.    
CRITICS SAY THE WHITE HOUSE     

96
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,897
SHOULD HAVE MOVED MORE QUICKLY  
IN WAIVING THE JONES ACT.       

97
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,167
LAWMAKERS AMONG THEM.           
WHY IS THAT AN UNFOUNDED        

98
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,469
COMPLAINT?                      
>> OKAY.                        

99
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:13,171
IT IS AN UNFOUNDED COMPLAINT.   
HERE'S WHY.                     

100
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:18,243
THE JONES ACT BRIEFLY STATED IS 
A RULE THAT FAVORS FLAGGED      

101
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,480
VESSELS, U.S. FLAGGED VESSELS.  
IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH U.S.    

102
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,483
FLAGGED VESSELS, THE CAPACITY IN
OTHER WORDS TO MEET THE NEEDS,  

103
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:28,487
THEN WE WAIVE THE JONES ACT.    
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WE HAD 

104
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,324
ENOUGH CAPACITY OF U.S. FLAGGED 
VESSELS TO TAKE MORE THAN OR TO 

105
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,027
EXCEED THE REQUIREMENT AND NEED 
OF DIESEL FUEL AND OTHER        

106
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,364
COMMODITIES TO PUERTO RICO.     
WHAT HAPPENED IS I THINK ALMOST 

107
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:47,038
17 OR 18 DAYS OF BACKLOGGED     
DIESEL FUEL NEED TO THE ISLAND. 

108
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:52,944
IT WAS MISREPORTED THAT WE HAD A
CAPACITY PROBLEM AND HAD TO     

109
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,446
WAIVE THE JONES ACT.            
NOT THE CASE.                   

110
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,985
THE IDEA IS WE PROVIDED AS MANY 
COMMODITIES AS NECESSARY TO THE 

111
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,922
ISLAND.                         
THE CHALLENGE WAS LAND-BASED    

112
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,791
DISTRIBUTION.                   
HOWEVER, LAST NIGHT THE GOVERNOR

113
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,128
CALLED ME A LITTLE AFTER 8:00   
AND SAID AT THIS POINT TO ENSURE

114
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,798
THAT THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS ARE   
MET AS WE MOVE FORWARD, MIGHT BE

115
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,569
A GOOD IDEA TO PROACTIVELY MAKE 
SURE THAT WE PULL OUT THE STOPS 

116
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,539
JUST IN CASE THAT CAPACITY      
PROBLEM RAN INTO THE REQUIREMENT

117
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:21,773
PROBLEM.                        
I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT.      

118
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,942
HE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE RIGHT   
THING TO DO.                    

119
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,711
WAIVED IT RIGHT AWAY.           
THAT WAS NOT TOO LATE.          

120
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:32,050
IT WAS NOT EVEN TOO EARLY.      
IT WAS JUST THE RIGHT THING     

121
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,719
PROACTIVELY.                    
>> RIGHT NOW, DISTRIBUTION IS   

122
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,123
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS.            
HOSPITALS ARE NOW UP AND RUNNING

123
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,792
AS NECESSARY TO BRING THE PEOPLE
WHOSE LIVES ARE AT RISK.        

124
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,162
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE COUNTRY  
WOULD YOU SAY YOU HAVE HAD A    

125
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,632
CHANCE TO EXPLORE TO SEE HOW    
THEY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS?

126
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,669
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THE
PERCENTAGE OF THE COUNTRY.      

127
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,406
IT ANSWER IT THIS WAY.          
THROUGH AERIAL SURVEILLANCE,    

128
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,712
WE'VE SEEN THE ENTIRETY PUERTO  
RICO.                           

129
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:06,918
SOME SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST    
SECTIONS ARE SPARSE.            

130
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:14,626
THE MOUNTAINOUS INTERIOR IS     
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN    

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,999
WITH ROTARY WINGED SUPPORT.     
BACK TO THE JONES ACT.          

132
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:26,304
WE HAD ENOUGH CAPACITY IN U.S.  
FLAGGED VESSELS TO GET THE      

133
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,007
COMMODITIESNER.                 
WE RAN INTO THE PRIORITY        

134
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,011
CHALLENGE OF DISTRIBUTING       
LAND-BASED COMMODITIES TO THE   

135
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,946
PEOPLE.                         
THAT'S A CHALLENGE OR FUNCTION  

136
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,549
OF TWO PROBLEMS.                
FIRST, CAPACITY OF THE LOCALS IN

137
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,185
THE STATE WERE DIMINISHED       
BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS

138
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,388
AS WELL THAT WORK FOR THE STATE 
AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.      

139
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,992
SECONDLY, THE DEBRIS AND DOWNED 
POWER LINES HAD TO BE PUSHED OUT

140
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,628
OF THE WAY.                     
WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT

141
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,463
NOW.                            
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE REMAINING. 

142
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:57,669
THE CENTRAL INTERIOR IS GOING TO
BE REVIEWED AND LOOKED A TO MAKE

143
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,073
SURE WE GET THE NEEDS OF THE    
PEOPLE MET.                     

144
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:10,749
>> HAD THE GOVERNOR NO REQUESTED
PROTECTIVELY A WAIVENER THE     

145
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:18,490
JONES ACT, WOULD YOU HAVE SEEN A
COMPELLING REASON TO SUGGEST IT?

146
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,626
>> MAYBE A HISTORICAL NOTE OF   
RELEVANCE, SOMETIMES WE'LL SEE  

147
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:26,965
THE CARRIERS REQUEST THE WAIVER.
SO YOU'LL HAVE FOREIGN-FLAGGED  

148
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,569
VESSELS OR U.S. VESSELS CARRIER 
COMPANIES CALL US AND SAY PLEASE

149
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,537
WAIVE IT.                       
THERE'S AN ISSUE.               

150
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:38,810
WE DIDN'T GET ANY CARRIER       
REQUESTS.                       

151
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,781
ONCE THE GOVERNOR CALLS AND SAYS
WE NEED IT, WE SHOULD LISTEN AND

152
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,851
THE PRESIDENT AGREED.           
>> IS THIS OVERHYPED IN SIMPLE  

153
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,986
TERMS?                          
>> MISUNDERSTOOD.               

154
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,388
SOME CRITICS THINK IT WAS A     
PRICE ISSUE.                    

155
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,058
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE MARKETS    
PRICE THESE THINGS.             

156
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:57,329
IT WAS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY   
THE U.S. TAX PAYNER A           

157
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,098
HUMANITARIAN EFFORT AND IT'S A  
WISE INVESTMENT TO SAVE LIVES.  

158
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:06,838
IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE THE U.S.  
VIRGIN ISLAND CITIZENS, PUERTO  

159
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:11,576
RICAN CITIZENS.                 
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.     

160
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,113
CAPACITY IS THE ISSUE.          
LIFE-SAVING REQUIREMENTS, THAT'S

161
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,317
THE NEED.                       
WE HAD THE CAPACITY MET.        

162
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,887
IN THE MIDDLE.                  
>> OKAY.                        

163
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,024
TOM, THE NEED IS IMMEDIATE.     
WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE

164
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:30,495
COMING, WHAT ARE THE            
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WITH AIR    

165
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,897
DROPPING IN CERTAIN AREAS?      
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT RUNNING

166
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,300
OUT OF WATER AND FOOD IN HOURS  
OR MINUTES.                     

167
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,902
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT     
CONVERSATION?                   

168
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:42,474
ONCE AGAIN, AN ISSUE OF HOUSING.
WE'RE HEARING ABOUT SHIPS,      

169
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,143
CRUISE SHIPS.                   
WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?          

170
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,212
>> SO A NUMBER OF THINGS        
HAPPENING.                      

171
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,080
WITH RESPECT TO DISTRIBUTION OF 
COMMODITIES.                    

172
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,316
THAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE   
RIGHT NOW.                      

173
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,152
THE RESTORATION OF POWER IS A   
BIG CHALLENGE.                  

174
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,289
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.              
ENERGY HERE, ELECTRIC POWER IS  

175
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:06,431
SUPPLYING THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE
PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE TO THE   

176
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,134
WOUNDED.                        
SO THERE'S A DUEL PRIORITY GOING

177
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:13,371
ON WITH EMERGENCY POWER AND THEN
BLOCKING, CLEARING, PUSHING OUT 

178
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,240
THE ROADS TO GET COMMODITIES    
DELIVERED.                      

179
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:19,210
THERE'S STILL A SHORTFALL THERE.
THAT IS DRIVERS FOR ALL OF THOSE

180
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,112
TRUCKS.                         
SO WE'RE PUSHING PERSONNEL TO   

181
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,114
AUGMENT STATE AND LOCAL         
AUTHORITIES TO CONTINUE TO PUSH 

182
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,152
THE COMMODITIES.                
WHAT YOU SAW TODAY IS SOME      

183
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,256
REPORTING OF SOME LOOP FOOTAGE  
OF SOME TRUCKS ON PORTS IN      

184
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,791
DOCKS.                          
WE'RE MOVING THE TRUCKS QUICKLY 

185
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,494
AND PRIORITIZING WHAT NEEDS TO  
COME OFF FIRST SO WE CAN GET    

186
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,031
GENERATORS --                   
>> WOULDN'T AIR DROPS CIRCUMVENT

187
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,001
THAT, HAVING TO REBUILD         
INFRASTRUCTURE AND MOVE THINGS  

188
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,769
AWAY?                           
>> IF AIR DROPS ARE UNDER       

189
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,173
CONSIDERATION, I'M NOT AWARE OF 
IT, BUT I WOULD PROMOTE IT IF   

190
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,974
IT'S FASTER GET FOOD AND WATER  
TO PEOPLE.                      

191
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,813
WE HAVE A ONE-STAR GENERAL,     
GENERAL KIM, IN PLACE WHO IS IN 

192
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,216
CHARGE OF GROUND FORCE          
OPERATIONS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S 

193
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,454
ONE PERSON IN CHARGE.           
IF HE RECOMMENDS AIR DROP, WE   

194
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:08,293
AIR DROP.                       
>> WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY    

195
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,230
NEED HELICOPTERS TO EVACUATE    
PEOPLE FROM REMOTE AREAS.       

196
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:16,868
HE SAYS THERE'S PEOPLE BURYING  
FAMILY MEMBERS IN FRONT YARDS.  

197
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,672
COMMUNICATIONS ARE BADLY NEEDED.
THEY LOOK AT APOCALYPTIC        

198
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,607
CONDITIONS BETWEEN 48 AND 72    
HOURS.                          

199
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:27,512
THERE'S A LITTLE DISCONNECT FROM
WHAT I'M HEARING HERE AND WHAT  

200
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:32,751
THEY'RE TELLING ME THERE.       
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE? 

201
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:37,756
>> YES.                         
IF THAT'S ACCURATE, IT NEEDS TO 

202
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,862
BE REMEDIATED IMMEDIATELY.      
I BELIEVE I'M CONFIDENT WE HAVE 

203
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:47,866
ENOUGH RESOURCES MARTIALED AND  
DEPLOYED FORWARD.               

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,069
AS I'VE EXPLAINED IN THE PAST,  
WE'VE HAD TO AUGMENT AND CHANGE 

205
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,038
OUR BUSINESS MODEL IN THE FIELD.
WE DID THAT THURSDAY.           

206
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,441
YOU SAW THE EFFECTS OVER THE    
WEEKEND.                        

207
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:00,411
WE HAVE TO AUGMENT THE LOCAL AND
STATE AUTHORITIES NOT JUST AT   

208
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,315
THE TOP BUT ALL THE WAY OUT     
THROUGH THE LOWER LEVEL.        

209
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,886
THERE'S FEDERAL OFFICIALS       
IDENTIFYING THE REQUIREMENTS AND

210
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,855
AUGMENTING THE STATE LEVEL TO   
VALIDATE THOSE REQUIREMENTS.    

211
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,591
FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE PROVIDING 
THEM.                           

212
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,195
WE'RE IN EVERY STAGE OF THE     
IDENTIFICATION, VALIDATION AND  

213
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,098
PROVISION OF REQUIREMENTS AND   
DELIVERY OF THEM TO PEOPLE IN   

214
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,534
NEED.                           
A COUPLE THINGS HERE.           

215
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:28,373
PEOPLE SEEING 28 AND 48 HORIZON 
PROBLEMS WHERE THEY DON'T SEE   

216
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,975
FEED AND WATER.                 
THAT FOOD AND WATER WILL GET TO 

217
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,946
THEM BEFORE THE DEADLINE ARISES.
I HAVE NO DOUBT.                

218
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,017
WE HAVE OVER 10,000 PEOPLE THERE
NOW AND THERE'S MORE ON THE WAY 

219
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,853
INCLUDING AERIAL SUPPORT.       
U.S.S. COMFORT.                 

220
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:47,759
THERE'S 12 COAST GUARD CUTTERS, 
THREE UNITED STATES NAVY SHIPS. 

221
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,594
SIX COMMERCIAL SHIPS WITH       
SUPPLIES IN ROUTE.              

222
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,964
THIS IS AS OF 5:00 A.M.         
THERE'S MORE SINCE.             

223
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,401
SEVEN ADDITIONAL SHIPS TO HOUSE 
RESPONDERS.                     

224
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:02,774
WE HAVE COMMODITIES DISTRIBUTION
EXCEEDING MILLIONS.             

225
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:08,179
SO IT'S ALL MOVING IN TODAY AND 
DISTRIBUTION PROBLEM IS BEING   

226
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,783
UNCLOGGED.                      
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY BEING BURIED

227
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,953
IN THE FRONT YARD, THAT'S       
TERRIBLE BUT IT'S NOT THE NORM. 

228
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,156
RIGHT NOW WE'VE SEEN 16         
FATALITIES CONFIRMED FROM THE   

229
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,259
STATE AUTHORITIES.              
NO FATALITY IS ACCEPTABLE.      

230
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,629
IF THAT NUMBER INCREASES, THAT  
WILL BE A DEVASTATING BLOW.     

231
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,131
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO
PREVENT THAT.                   

232
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,267
LOSS OF LIFE FROM THE STORM IS  
ONE THING.                      

233
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,204
LOSS OF LIFE THAT IS PREVENTIBLE
IS ANOTHER.                     

234
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,673
>> SENATOR RUBIO JUST BACK FROM 
THE ISLAND.                     

235
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,777
HE SAID THERE'S SIGNIFICANT     
LOGISTICAL CONCERNS.            

236
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:45,316
HE SAYS THERE'S NO CLEAR COMMAND
CONTROL BETWEEN LOCAL AND       

237
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:50,221
FEDERAL AGENCIES.               
HE SAID IT'S ALL LED BY DOD.    

238
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,591
IS THAT OPTION ON THE TABLE?    
>> IT'S BEING UNDERTAKEN.       

239
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,693
I WAS WITH THE SENATOR IN PUERTO
RICO.                           

240
00:14:55,828 --> 00:15:00,064
WHAT HE'S IDENTIFYING THERE IS  
SOMETHING THAT WE HAD A SOLUTION

241
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,335
FOR.                            
SO HE'S IDENTIFYING A           

242
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,771
TRADITIONAL PROBLEM.            
NORMALLY FEMA AND THE FEDERAL   

243
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,440
GOVERNMENT PROVIDE AID TO THE   
STATE AND THEY WORK IT OUT WITH 

244
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,543
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.          
WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED HERE AS OF

245
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,313
THURSDAY AND YOU SAW IT         
IMPLEMENTED OVER THE THE        

246
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,716
WEEKEND, A LACK OF CAPACITY     
COUPLED WITH THIS SEVERAL       

247
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,687
HUNDRED MILES AWAY DIVIDED BY AN
OCEAN ISLAND PROBLEM.           

248
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:29,594
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS PROVIDED  
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, LARGELY    

249
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,696
GUYS IN GREEN AND FEMALE        
EMERGENCY MANAGERS TO STAND NEXT

250
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:39,037
TO THE MUNICIPALITY LEADERS,    
WHETHER THEY'RE MAYORS OR LOCAL 

251
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,040
ELECTRIC AUTHORITIES LEADERS AND
BEING AUGMENTED BY FEDERAL      

252
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,776
FORCES.                         
WE'VE ADDRESSED THE CHALLENGES  

253
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,611
BY AUGMENTING THEM WITH FEDERAL 
STAFF.                          

254
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,980
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WASN'T    
NECESSARILY APPARENT TO THE     

255
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,249
SENATOR AS HE GOT THERE.        
HE IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM.        

256
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,284
IT WAS A PROBLEM ALREADY BEING  
FIXED.                          

257
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,554
IT'S ONE HE PROBABLY WASN'T ABLE
TO SEE AT THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL   

258
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:01,326
FOR TWO REASONS.                
ONE, HE DIDN'T GET OUT THERE TO 

259
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,295
THEM.                           
AND TWO, THERE WAS A            

260
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,631
COMMUNICATION PROBLEM OF GRAVE  
IMPORT THAT PERSISTS TO THIS    

261
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,199
DAY.                            
THAT COMMUNICATIONS PROBLEM IS  

262
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,902
TIED TO THE ELECTRIC POWER      
RESTORATION PROBLEM.            

263
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,738
IF I COULD BEFORE I TAKE THE    
NEXT QUESTION, LET ME EXPLAIN   

264
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:20,878
WHY AND HOW THE POWER           
RESTORATION PROCESS IS          

265
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:25,216
UNFOLDING.                      
WE PUT THE U.S. ARMY CORPS      

266
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,587
ENGINEERS IN CHARGE OF POWER    
RESTORATION.                    

267
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,458
THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF A LOT BUT  
NOT EVERYTHING.                 

268
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,827
THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO ARE   
STRONG AND COMPETENT.           

269
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,731
THEY'RE IN CHARGE AND THAT'S THE
BEST WAY TO HANDLE THINGS.      

270
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,767
WHERE THEY HAVE DIMINISHED      
CAPACITY, WE'RE TAKING EXTREME  

271
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,936
STEPS.                          
SO A DIRECT FEDERAL ASSISTANCE  

272
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,672
ORDER WAS GIVEN.                
A MISSION ASSIGNMENT WAS GIVEN. 

273
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:52,744
I'VE HEARD OTHERS ON TV QUIBBLE 
WHETHER IT'S A MISSION OR NOT.  

274
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,814
MAKE IT CLEAR, THE U.S. ARMY    
CORPS OF ENGINEERS HAS BEEN     

275
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,850
GIVEN TO RESTORE POWER ON PUERTO
RICO.                           

276
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,953
HE HAS SOME PRIORITIES.         
HIS PRIORITIES ARE TEMPORARY    

277
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:06,157
POWER GENERATION RIGHT NOW.     
THAT'S THE BIG DIESEL RUN       

278
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,294
GENERATORS SUPPORTING HOSPITALS 
AND LIFE-SAVING CAPABILITIES.   

279
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,933
TWO, PERMANENT GENERATION.      
HE WILL RESTORE THE POWER ON THE

280
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:20,238
SOUTH OF THE ISLAND.            
THREE, TRANSMISSION.            

281
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:28,046
THE BIG POWER LINES.            
NEXT, THE CAPILLARY POWER LINES 

282
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,449
TO THE HOMES.                   
I'M SURE THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO   

283
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:37,021
RICO HE SEE THE ARMY CORPS.     
>> IF AIR DROPS WOULD HELP, WHY 

284
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:43,861
ARE THEY NOT HAPPENING?         
IS IT A MILITARY ISSUE?         

285
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,331
>> IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THE STATE
GOVERNMENT AND THE              

286
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,300
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED  
THE FASTEST ROUTE AVAILABLE     

287
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,336
BEING GROUND BASED.             
IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE, I'M     

288
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,839
CONFIDENT BUT I WANT TO MAKE    
SURE I DON'T STEP IN BETWEEN    

289
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,675
SOMETHING THAT I CAN BE FAR     
REMOVED FROM.                   

290
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,546
IF THE GROUND FORCE COMMANDER   
HAS IDENTIFIED AN AIR DROP      

291
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,116
MISSION, I ENDORSE IT FROM HERE.
I WOULDN'T QUESTION HIS         

292
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,285
JUDGMENT.                       
IT WAS MY REPORTING FROM EARLIER

293
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,621
TODAY THEY IDENTIFIED THE       
FASTEST TO BE THROUGH           

294
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:16,360
GROUND-BASED MEANS BY CLEARING  
FIRST AND DELIVERING SECOND.    

295
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,463
THEY NEEDED SECURITY FORCES AND 
THEY APPLIED THEM.              

296
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:22,266
THERE'S A SECURITY FORCE FOR    
EACH OF THE DRIVERS TO FEEL     

297
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:26,737
SAFE.                           
>> SEVERAL AID FLIGHTS HAVE     

298
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:31,442
GOTTEN OUT OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
DELIVER FOOD AND WATER WITHOUT  

299
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,246
LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS.            
THERE'S REPORTS OF MISMANAGEMENT

300
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,281
COMING ALL THE WAY FROM THE     
PRESIDENT.                      

301
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,618
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?     
>> I'M NOT CERTAIN WHO YOU'RE   

302
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,255
TALKING ABOUT.                  
THERE'S POINT OF CRITICISM TO GO

303
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,524
AROUND.                         
I'M CONFIDENT --                

304
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,795
>> HE SAID THE PROBLEMS THAT    
YOU'RE HAVING LOGISTICALLY ARE  

305
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,764
OF YOUR OWN MAKING FROM NOT     
TAKING ACTION SOONER AND        

306
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:59,303
BRINGING IN THE MILITARY SOONER.
>> FIRST, I THANK THE MAYOR FOR 

307
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,339
PROVIDING AID.                  
HE'S WRONG IN THIS CASE.        

308
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,542
I CHALLENGE HIM TO GO DOWN AND  
GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING ON   

309
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,079
WHAT WE'VE DONE, WHAT WE'VE BEEN
DOING AND HOW BLOWN AWAY YOU'LL 

310
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,949
BE WHEN YOU SEE THE PICTURE.    
I'M CERTAIN THE MAYOR HAS HAD   

311
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,620
SOME POSITIVE EXPERIENCES.      
I WOULDN'T BE CRITICAL          

312
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,655
PERSONALLY.                     
PROBABLY LIKE WITH THE JONES    

313
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,057
ACT, HE'S NOT INFORMED ON THE   
QUESTION.                       

314
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,161
>> HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET 
SUPPLIES THROUGH AND WHY IT IS  

315
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,130
THERE'S 10,000 CONTAINERS IN THE
PORT OF SAN JUAN?               

316
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:30,701
>> TO MY POINT, WE'RE GETTING A 
LOT OF SUPPLIES THROUGH.        

317
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,539
MAYBE IT'S MISREPORTING.        
>> THE PRESIDENT REFERENCED SOME

318
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,641
OF THE DEBT AND ECONOMIC        
PROBLEMS THAT PUERTO RICO HAS   

319
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,576
BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FOR SOME   
TIME HERE.                      

320
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,415
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LACK  
OF CAPACITY, ARE YOU FAULTING   

321
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,685
LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR A LACK OF   
PREPAREDNESS?                   

322
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,320
>> NO.                          
LET ME BE CLEAR.                

323
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,623
WHEN I SAY "CAPACITY", I'M      
TALKING ABOUT THE CAPACITY      

324
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,760
PROBLEM OF PEOPLE BEING VICTIMS 
THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE     

325
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,564
FIRST RESPONDERS, REPAIRERS AND 
MANAGERS OF THE MUNICIPAL       

326
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,034
GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS.           
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO

327
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,236
RESTORE BASELINE MUNICIPAL      
GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS BECAUSE    

328
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,039
THEY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.        
THEIR HOMES ARE DESTROYED AND   

329
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,976
FAMILIES PUT IN PERIL.          
THAT'S THE CAPACITY PROBLEM I'M 

330
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,379
ADDRESSING.                     
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MONEY, THE  

331
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,584
ISLAND AUTHORITY IN GENERAL,    
PUERTO RICO WAS $72 BILLION IN  

332
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,053
DEATH.                          
THERE'S A RESTRUCTURING         

333
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,521
UNDERWAY.                       
THE CONGRESS WEIGHED IN.        

334
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,593
THAT $72 BILLION IS BEING       
HANDLED THROUGH BANKRUPTCY      

335
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,561
PROCEEDINGS.                    
>> HOW IS THAT IMPACTING IT?    

336
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,864
THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT IT UP.    
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT -- I   

337
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,934
KNOW THE PRESIDENT BROUGHT IT UP
IN TERMS OF RECOVERY.           

338
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,769
HERE'S HOW IT AFFECTS THE       
RESPONSE.                       

339
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,305
IT PUTS THE ISLAND IN A POSITION
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE       

340
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,041
FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET THE 
COST SHARE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL  

341
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:50,381
OF THESE GOODS AND RESOURCES,   
PERSONNEL AND MATERIAL FLOWING. 

342
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:55,219
IN THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED   
THAT, REALIZED THAT WOULD BE A  

343
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,457
PROBLEM AND HE TOOK THE STEP OF 
DOING A 100% FEDERAL COST SHARE 

344
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,727
ADJUSTMENT TO PAY FOR THIS FROM 
DEBRIS REMOVAL, TO DEBRIS       

345
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,264
PUSHING, POWER RESTORATION, THE 
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND ALL 

346
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,401
THE EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE        
MEASURES, POLICE, FIRE, EMS,    

347
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,603
TUCK DRIVERS.                   
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.            

348
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,539
180 DAYS.                       
SIX MONTHS FOR THE VIRGIN       

349
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:18,276
ISLANDS AND FOR PUERTO RICO     
UNTIL WE CAN GET OUR HANDS      

350
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,444
AROUND THIS.                    
ALL OF THOSE FUNCTIONS AND      

351
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,814
MISSIONS ARE ALL 100% FEDERAL   
COST SHARE.                     

352
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,150
WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY WORRIED   
ABOUT PEOPLE.                   

353
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,854
WE WANT THEM WORRIED ABOUT      
PEOPLE.                         

354
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,491
TWO MORE QUESTIONS.             
>> I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP A      

355
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,228
LITTLE BIT AS YOU'RE STARTING TO
ENVISION DOWN THE ROAD.         

356
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,065
ANY SORT OF BAILOUT MIGHT BE    
PART OF THIS SORT OF BROADER    

357
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,602
RECOVERY PACKAGE THAT YOU LOOK  
FOR IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL.        

358
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:51,876
ON THAT SUPPLEMENTAL, I KNOW THE
FIRST ONE WILL BE RELATIVELY    

359
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,445
SOON.                           
CAPITOL HILL SAYS IT COULD BE   

360
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,882
SOONER.                         
>> AS MY COLLEAGUE, MR. COHN    

361
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:02,553
ALLUDED TO, WE'RE WILLING TO    
NEGOTIATE WITH ACCORDING IF     

362
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,524
THERE'S A BETTER IDEA.          
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND    

363
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:12,363
THAT FEMA JUST GOT A $7.1       
BILLION APPROPRIATION ON OCTOBER

364
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,365
1.                              
WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR THAT IN  

365
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,601
THE FORM OF AN EMERGENCY        
SUPPLEMENTAL TO PROVIDE MONEY   

366
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,105
INTO THE FUNDS THAT DOES THIS   
LIFE-SUSTAINING EFFORT AND EVEN 

367
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,741
EARLY RECOVERY EFFORTS.         
WHETHER WE HAVE TO ADDRESS OR   

368
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,478
SHOULD ADDRESS AT THAT POINT THE
EXISTING $72 BILLION OF DEBT AND

369
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,314
HOW IT'S BEEN RESTRUCTURED IS   
SOMETHING THAT I'LL HAVE TO TAKE

370
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,718
MY LEAD FROM DEECONOMISTS ON AND
THE BUDGET HAWKS.               

371
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,922
I THINK THE BEST IDEA FOR US    
WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON PROCESS.   

372
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,826
THE ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY AND
THE WATER AUTHORITY, THOSE ARE  

373
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,763
THE TWO CONCERNING ELEMENTS THAT
HAVE TO BE REBUILD AND UNDER    

374
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:51,102
PROPER MANAGEMENT AND UNDER     
PROPER REBUILDING CODES AND     

375
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:57,041
STANDARDS TO MAKE SURE THEY MAKE
IT THROUGH ANOTHER HURRICANE.   

376
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,944
WE'RE GOING TO PUT FEDERAL MONEY
IN IT AND DO IT WISELY.         

377
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,613
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES IN THAT. 
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

378
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,716
THE DEBT RESTRUCTURING ISSUE IN 
THE NEXT GO AROUND.             

379
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:11,389
IF WE DO, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS UP 
TO THAT CHALLENGE.              

380
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:16,127
>> THE SUPPLEMENTAL WILL HAVE TO
COME IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE   

381
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:21,832
WEEKS.                          
OVER TO DIRECTOR MULVANEY.      

382
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:33,744
>> WHY HAS IT TAKEN EIGHT DAYS  
AND A THREE STAR GENERAL --     

383
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:42,753
>> IT DIDN'T REQUIRE A          
THREE-STAR GENERAL THREE DAYS   

384
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,990
AGO.                            
WE HAD A THREE-STAR GENERAL FROM

385
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,859
DAY MINUS 8 AND DAY MINUS TWO   
AND ALL THE WAY TILL TODAY.     

386
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,463
WE FORWARD DEPLOYED A ONE-STAR  
GENERAL TO TAKE CARE OF GROUND  

387
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,867
FORCE COMMAND ONCE WE REALIZED  
THE PROBLEM OF LOGISTICS        

388
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,403
DISTRIBUTION HAD OUTSTRIPPED THE
CAPACITY OF THE AFFECTED        

389
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,605
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT.           
THAT THREE-STAR GENERAL WAS     

390
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,445
THERE AND RUNNING AND           
COORDINATING OPERATIONS AS AN   

391
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,015
EXTENSION OF NORAD AND NORTHERN 
COMMAND.                        

392
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:18,355
WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO      
MARTIALING OF RESOURCES.        

393
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,425
THE THREE-STAR COMMAND STRUCTURE
THAT HE LACKED BACK THEN HAS    

394
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,629
BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND HAS BEEN  
IN PLACE FOR THIS RESPOND OUT OF

395
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,699
SAN ANTONIO AND AUGMENTED BY A  
NORTHERN COMMAND STRUCTURE      

396
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:32,937
THAT'S BEEN PRETTY ROBUST AND   
FORWARD LEANING HERE.           

397
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:37,308
THEY'VE DONE VOCAL AUTHORITY AND
NOT WAITING FOR PAPERWORK.      

398
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:42,279
THEY DON'T WAY FOR A GOVERNOR'S 
REQUEST.                        

399
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,049
PERHAPS MISUNDERSTOOD.          
NOW THE CHANGE MOVE HERE ON DAY 

400
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:49,386
EIGHT IS TO TAKE THE THREE-STAR 
GENERAL AND PUT HIM THERE,      

401
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,022
PHYSICALLY IN THE FIELD.        
I DON'T ANTICIPATE HE WILL BE   

402
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,126
THERE LONG BUT HE HAS TO HAVE   
HIS EYES ON IT AND MAKES SURE   

403
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,429
HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE       
INTERACTION WITH HIS FORCES AND 

404
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,264
THE GOVERNOR.                   
IT'S A DIFFERENT BUSINESS PLAN  

405
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,468
MODEL IN THE FELLED AND BECAUSE 
IT'S UNIQUE AND IT'S AN ISLAND, 

406
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,538
1100 MILES AWAY FROM THE NEAREST
LAND IN FLORIDA.                

407
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,641
ONCE HE'S SATISFIED OR WOULD    
EXPECT THE THREE-STAR GENERAL TO

408
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,611
RECEIVE BACK TO HIS APPROPRIATE 
COMMAND STRUCTURE.              

409
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:18,148
FOR NOW HE AND HIS ONE-START    
SUBORDINATE COMMAND WILL BE     

410
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:22,987
THERE AND WE'LL GET MORE PEOPLE 
THE NEXT COMING DAYS TO TRY TO  

411
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,589
ADDRESS THIS SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM
AND SIGNIFICANT NEED.           

412
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,993
IF THAT'S OKAY, THAT'S MY LAST  
QUESTION.                       

413
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,596
>> SAN ANTONIO IS THOUSANDS OF  
MILES FROM PUERTO RICO.         

414
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,867
WAS IT A MISTAKE LOOKING BACK TO
NOT HAVE THIS THREE-STAR GENERAL

415
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,270
ON THE GROUND EARLIER.          
>> NOT AT ALL.                  

416
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,606
THAT DOESN'T EFFECT IT.         
THE WAY WE STAGE EQUIPMENT AND  

417
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:47,244
HANDLE AREA COMMAND AND FIELD   
OPERATIONAL COMMAND.            

418
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,782
THIS IS TEXTBOOK AND IT'S DOWN  
WELL.                           

419
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,519
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE WE'LL   
HANDLE IT THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE.

420
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,989
PETER, IF I COULD, JOHN, THAT'S 
MY LAST QUESTION.               

421
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:08,966
IF I CAN, I'M GOING TO END BY   
SAYING PLEASE SAY A PRAYER FOR  

422
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,504
THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO AND   
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS AND FOR 

423
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:17,808
THE 10,000 PLUS FEDERAL WORKERS 
AND VOLUNTEER WORKERS, MEN AND  

424
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,245
WOMEN THAT ARE HELPING THOSE IN 
NEED.                           

425
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,948
HONESTLY, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
WILL REQUIRE WEEKS AND MONTHS OF

426
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:29,253
PATIENCE AS WE RESTORE POWER,   
GET FOOD AND WATER AND RETURN TO

427
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,556
NORMALCY.                       
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.           

428
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,928
PROUD OF PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE AND
THE GOVERNOR HAS OUR CONFIDENCE 

429
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,798
AND FAITH.                      
THANK YOU.                      

430
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,034
>> THANK YOU, TOM.              
WE'RE RUNNING LONG TODAY.       

431
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,606
I'M JUMP INTO QUESTIONS AND TRY 
TO TAKE A FEW BEFORE WE HAVE TO 

432
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:57,581
CUT OFF BEFORE THE DAY.         
>> IS THE PRESIDENT TAKING STEPS

433
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,584
TO CRACK DOWN ON TOM PRICE?     
>> AS THE PRESIDENT SAID        

434
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,353
YESTERDAY, HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH  
THE ACTIONS.                    

435
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:07,257
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE.     
THEY'RE CONDUCTING BOTH INTERNAL

436
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,961
AND AN I.G. FULL REVIEW TO BE   
CLEAR ALSO, THE WHITE HOUSE DOES

437
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:15,065
NOT HAVE A ROLE ON THE FRONT END
OF APPROVING PRIVATE CHARTER    

438
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,069
FLIGHTS AT THE AGENCIES.        
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE     

439
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:23,340
LOOKING INTO FROM THIS POINT    
FORWARD AND HAVE ASKED A HALT TO

440
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,611
BE PUT AT HHS ON ANY PRIVATE    
CHARTER FLIGHTS MOVING FORWARD  

441
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,347
UNTIL THOSE REVIEWS ARE         
COMPLETED.                      

442
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:34,318
>> DOES SECRETARY PRICE EXPECT  
TO KEEP HIS JOB IN THIS         

443
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,487
SEPARATION?                     
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS    

444
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,656
ADDRESSED THIS YESTERDAY.       
WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS       

445
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,925
PROCESS.                        
WE'RE GOING TO CONDUCT A FULL   

446
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,295
REVIEW AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.    
>> I HAVE TWO THINGS.           

447
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,767
THE FIRST, THE PRESIDENT HAS SIX
TIMES THE LAST COUPLE DAYS SAID 

448
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,503
THAT THE SENATOR IS IN THE      
HOSPITAL.                       

449
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:57,207
THAT'S REFERENCE TO SENATOR     
COCHRAN WHO IS NOT IN THE       

450
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,210
HOSPITAL AND THE REASON THIS IS 
RELEVANT QUESTION IS THE        

451
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,014
QUESTION SAID THEY HAVE THE     
VOTES FOR THE HEALTHCARE BILL TO

452
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,649
PASS.                           
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT SENATOR    

453
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,653
HE'S REFERRING TO AND IF IT IS  
SENATOR COCHRAN, WHY IF THE     

454
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,723
VOTES EXIST THE SENATE ISN'T    
VOTING ON THAT NOW?             

455
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,993
>> LOOK, OUR UNDERSTANDING IS   
THE SENATOR WAS PHYSICALLY      

456
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,563
UNABLE TO BE HERE THIS WEEK TO  
PARTICIPATE IN A VOTE.          

457
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,699
WE'RE GLAD THAT HE'S            
RECUPERATING.                   

458
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,802
THE POINT THAT WE'RE MAKING IS  
WE HAVE THE VOTES ON THE        

459
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:28,205
SUBSTANCE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY  
ON THE PROCESS, WHICH IS WHY    

460
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:31,809
WE'RE STILL CONFIDENT THAT WE   
CAN MOVE HEALTHCARE FORWARD AND 

461
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,346
GET IT DONE IN THE SPRING.      
>> OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENT      

462
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:41,418
DIDN'T SUPPORT ROY MOORE IN THE 
PRIMARY BUT HE'S MOVED TO WARMLY

463
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:46,724
EMBRACE HIM SINCE THEN.         
WHAT I'M WONDERING, JUDGE MOORE 

464
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:54,531
HAS HAD A A LOT OF CONTROVERSIAL
COMMENTS ABOUT BEING GUY TO     

465
00:28:54,666 --> 00:29:00,437
EQUAL TO BEASTALITY AND MUSLIMS 
SHOULDN'T SERVE.                

466
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,308
WHY SHOULD THOSE COMMENTS NOT   
QUALIFIED HIM HIM FROM A        

467
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,211
PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT?       
>> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,

468
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,748
I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO BACK  
AND FORTH ON POLITICAL          

469
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,650
ENDORSEMENTS FROM THE PODIUM.   
I'M NOT GOING TO WEIGH-IN ON A  

470
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,686
SPECIFIC RACE AHEAD OF TIME AT  
THIS POINT.                     

471
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,823
MATTHEW?                        
>> I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. 

472
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:28,999
AS YOU MENTIONED, JUDGE MOORE   
HOMOSEXUALALITY SHOULD BE       

473
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,667
ILLEGAL.                        
HE SAID KEITH ELLISON SHOULDN'T 

474
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,803
BE IN CONGRESS BECAUSE HE'S A   
MUSLIM.                         

475
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,806
WITHOUT ASKING ABOUT THE        
SPECIFICS OF THE RACE, DOESN'T  

476
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,842
TRUMP SHARE ANY OF THOSE VIEWS  
THAT I JUST MENTIONED?          

477
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,913
IF NOT, WHY DOES HE THINK THIS  
PERSON IS FIT TO BE A U.S.      

478
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,849
SENATOR?                        
>> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.       

479
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:51,789
I HAVE NOT TAKEN A DEEP DIVE ON 
EVERY COMMENT THAT THE SENATE   

480
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,291
NOMINEE HAS MADE.               
I CERTAINLY KNOW WHERE THE      

481
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,860
PRESIDENT STANDS ON THOSE ISSUES
AND WOULDN'T SEE ANY PARALLEL ON

482
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:00,263
THE TWO OF THEM ON THAT FRONT.  
>> ARE THERE ANY
