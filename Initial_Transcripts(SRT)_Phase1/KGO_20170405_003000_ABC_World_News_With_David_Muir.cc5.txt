[000:00:14;330] UNLEASHED IN SYRIA.
[000:00:16;866] WE ARE STAYING AWAY FROM THE
[000:00:17;467] MOST GRUESOME MOMENTS.
[000:00:20;136] FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AMONG THE
[000:00:20;737] VICTIMS.
[000:00:21;805] GASPING FOR AIR TO SURVIVE.
[000:00:24;140] AND THE MOMENT ANOTHER EXPLOSION
[000:00:24;774] HITS.
[000:00:27;310] OUR TEAM MAKING CONTACT WITH A
[000:00:29;879] DOCTOR ON THE GROUND.

[000:00:37;754] NOW, THE NEW QUESTION TONIGHT

[000:00:39;756] NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,
[000:00:40;323] SUSAN RICE.
[000:00:42;892] DID SHE ASK FOR NAMES?
[000:00:43;359] DID SHE UNMASK THEM?
[000:00:45;862] MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP TEAM CAUGHT
[000:00:47;564] UP IN SURVEILLANCE BY THE U.S.
[000:00:49;799] WHAT SHE IS SAYING TONIGHT.

[000:00:53;903] FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER
[000:00:54;504] CARTER PAGE.
[000:00:57;807] WERE RUSSIAN SPIES ACTIVELY
[000:00:58;374] TRYING TO RECRUIT HIM TO WORK
[000:00:58;975] FOR THEM?
[000:01:01;811] BRIAN ROSS FINDS HIM TODAY.
[000:01:07;951] >> DID YOU GIVE THEM DOCUMENTS?
[000:01:11;087] DID YOU RECEIVE DOCUMENTS FROM

[000:01:18;128] NEW REPORTING TONIGHT.
[000:01:22;899] >>> GOOD EVENING.
[000:01:24;000] IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
[000:01:24;634] ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.
[000:01:25;835] WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT
[000:01:26;436] WITH THE IMAGES THAT HAVE
[000:01:28;638] STUNNED THE WORLD.
[000:01:29;038] IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER
[000:01:31;274] SIX YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA, THERE
[000:01:32;275] COULD BE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
[000:01:33;843] THAN WHAT MANY HAVE ALREADY
[000:01:34;410] SEEN.
[000:01:35;445] TONIGHT, OUR TEAM HAS TAKEN
[000:01:37;447] GREAT CARE TO POUR THROUGH THE
[000:01:38;081] IMAGES FIRST, BUT WE WARN YOU,
[000:01:41;117] THEY'RE STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE.
[000:01:41;818] A CHEMICAL ATTACK.
[000:01:44;254] SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN
[000:01:44;854] AMONG THE VICTIMS.
[000:01:48;858] SURVIVORS BEING SPRAYED OFF,
[000:01:53;029] AFTER WAR PLANES DROPPED WHAT
[000:01:53;630] APPEARS TO BE A TOXIC GAS.
[000:01:54;164] THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDING.
[000:01:56;766] HERE'S JONATHAN KARL.
[000:02:00;870] >> Reporter: TONIGHT, OUTRAGE
[000:02:04;541] OVER THESE SCENES OF HORROR AND
[000:02:05;175] SUFFERING IN SYRIA.
[000:02:07;577] AN APPARENT WAR CRIME, A
[000:02:09;179] SUSPECTED SARIN GAS ATTACK BY
[000:02:11;781] THE GOVERNMENT KILLING DOZENS
[000:02:15;451] AND SICKENING MANY MORE, YOUNG
[000:02:17;887] CHILDREN AMONG THE VICTIMS.
[000:02:19;622] RESCUE WORKERS DESPERATELY WORK
[000:02:20;590] TO WASH THE CHEMICAL FROM THE
[000:02:21;791] VICTIMS.
[000:02:24;260] CHILDREN CLINGING TO LIFE,
[000:02:25;795] STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.
[000:02:27;931] >> THE GAS ATTACKS ARE
[000:02:28;965] CONTINUING EVERY DAY AND NO ONE
[000:02:32;302] IS DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THIS
[000:02:34;838] GAS ATTACK.
[000:02:35;672] >> Reporter: THIS ATTACK
[000:02:37;774] FOLLOWING TWO CHLORINE GAS
[000:02:38;341] ATTACKS OVER THE PAST WEEK.
[000:02:38;908] WHILE THIS LOCAL ACTIVIST
[000:02:40;910] REPORTED FROM ONE OF THOSE
[000:02:41;511] HOSPITALS, IT WAS HIT WITH
[000:02:42;078] ANOTHER AIRSTRIKE.
[000:02:45;849] THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THE
[000:02:48;685] ATTACK "REPREHENSIBLE" AND SAID
[000:02:49;319] IT "CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
[000:02:49;919] CIVILIZED WORLD."
[000:02:53;389] BUT THE STATEMENT ALSO TOOK AIM
[000:02:54;023] AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
[000:02:55;491] "THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
[000:02:57;026] BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME ARE A
[000:02:58;127] CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAST
[000:03:00;230] ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS AND
[000:03:01;164] IRRESOLUTION."
[000:03:03;766] THAT'S A REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT
[000:03:06;436] OBAMA'S FAILURE TO PUNISH SYRIA
[000:03:09;505] FOR CROSSING THE SO-CALLED RED
[000:03:10;139] LINE WHEN IT USED CHEMICAL
[000:03:10;707] WEAPONS IN 2013.
[000:03:12;609] PRESIDENT OBAMA IN FACT BOASTED
[000:03:13;810] THAT HE HAD WORKED OUT AN
[000:03:14;711] AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA AND SYRIA
[000:03:17;814] TO GET RID OF ASSAD'S CHEMICAL
[000:03:18;448] WEAPONS.
[000:03:20;383] >> ASSAD GAVE UP HIS CHEMICAL
[000:03:21;484] WEAPONS.
[000:03:24;087] THAT'S NOT SPECULATION ON OUR
[000:03:24;687] PART.
[000:03:25;588] >> Reporter: TRAGICALLY, THAT
[000:03:26;189] WAS NOT TRUE.
[000:03:28;191] AT LEAST SOME OF THE WEAPONS
[000:03:28;791] REMAINED.
[000:03:32;395] THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS
[000:03:33;830] WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
[000:03:34;430] HOLD ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING
[000:03:35;064] CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:03:37;800] HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT TODAY
[000:03:38;401] BUT HE DID SAY THIS IN A SPEECH
[000:03:41;204] ON THE ECONOMY.
[000:03:41;571] >> I'M NOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO
[000:03:43;273] BE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD.
[000:03:44;841] I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
[000:03:46;943] STATES, AND FROM NOW ON, IT'S
[000:03:49;012] GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.
[000:03:55;785] >> Reporter: SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:03:56;419] REX TILLERSON IGNORED QUESTIONS
[000:03:57;320] ON THE ATTACK.
[000:03:59;989] >> MR. SECRETARY, ANY COMMENT ON
[000:04:01;457] THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA?
[000:04:02;058] >> BASHAR AL ASSAD SHOULD STILL
[000:04:05;728] BE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA?
[000:04:06;195] >> Reporter: BUT JUST LAST WEEK
[000:04:06;829] TILLERSON SIGNALED A SIGNIFICANT
[000:04:08;731] CHANGE IN LONGTIME U.S. POLICY
[000:04:10;900] THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD MUST GO.
[000:04:13;970] >> I THINK THE STATUS IN THE
[000:04:17;807] LONGER TERM STATUS OF PRESIDENT
[000:04:19;676] ASSAD WILL BE DECIDED BY THE
[000:04:20;276] SYRIAN PEOPLE.
[000:04:23;813] >> Reporter: TONIGHT, THESE
[000:04:24;380] SYRIAN PEOPLE AREN'T DETERMINING
[000:04:25;415] THE STATUS OF ASSAD, THEY ARE
[000:04:27;016] TRYING TO SURVIVE HIS BRUTALITY.
[000:04:30;620] >> AND JON WITH US LIVE TONIGHT
[000:04:31;254] FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:04:33;823] SECRETARY TILLERSON DID NOT TAKE
[000:04:40;997] QUESTIONS ON THIS TODAY, BUT HE
[000:04:41;631] APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN TO HARSHER
[000:04:44;400] LINE IN A STATEMENT TODAY THAN
[000:04:45;034] JUST LAST WEEK?
[000:04:45;802] >> Reporter: A MUCH HARSHER
[000:04:46;369] LINE.
[000:04:47;270] A WRITTEN STATEMENT WHERE HE
[000:04:49;839] CONDEMNED ASSAD.
[000:04:54;677] REFERRING TO HIS BRUTAL,
[000:05:01;818] UNABASHED BARBARISM.
[000:05:03;653] AND HIS FUNDAMENTAL DISREGARD
[000:05:08;157] FOR HUMAN DECENCY.
[000:05:08;658] AND CALLED OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN,
[000:05:09;792] SAYING THEY BEAR GREAT MORAL
[000:05:10;393] RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS.
[000:05:11;027] BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRUMP
[000:05:11;661] ADMINISTRATION WILL DO ABOUT IT
[000:05:12;395] AND WHETHER THEY NOW WANT ASSAD
[000:05:13;029] TO GO.
[000:05:13;896] >> JON, THANK YOU.
[000:05:15;965] >>> WE TURN TO THE OTHER MAJOR
[000:05:17;800] HEADLINE INVOLVING THE WHITE
[000:05:19;102] HOUSE, AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:05:20;536] CLAIM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:05:21;804] WIRETAPPED TRUMP TOWER.
[000:05:23;272] SUSAN RICE ANSWERING QUESTIONS
[000:05:24;841] TONIGHT.
[000:05:26;843] DID SHE ASK THAT MEMBERS OF THE
[000:05:31;014] TRUMP TEAM WERE UNMASKED AFTER
[000:05:32;115] BEING SWEPT UP IN SURVEILLANCE
[000:05:33;816] ON FOREIGN THREATS?
[000:05:37;820] HERE'S CECILIA VEGA.
[000:05:40;923] >> Reporter: IT WAS EXACTLY ONE
[000:05:41;824] MONTH AGO THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:05:42;525] ACCUSED PRESIDENT OBAMA OF
[000:05:45;795] WIRETAPPING HIM IN TRUMP TOWER.
[000:05:47;163] AND TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:05:48;698] CONSERVATIVE ALLIES SAY OBAMA'S
[000:05:51;300] FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
[000:05:52;835] SUSAN RICE REVEALED THE
[000:05:54;470] IDENTITIES OF TRUMP ASSOCIATES
[000:05:55;104] SWEPT UP IN SURVEILLANCE.
[000:05:58;074] FROM RICE TODAY, A FIRM DENIAL.
[000:06:02;745] >> THIS IS NOT ANYTHING
[000:06:04;313] POLITICAL HAS BEEN ALLEGED.
[000:06:06;883] THE ALLEGATION IS THAT SOMEHOW
[000:06:07;984] OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
[000:06:09;519] UTILIZED INTELLIGENCE FOR
[000:06:10;553] POLITICAL PURPOSES.
[000:06:13;790] THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.
[000:06:14;590] >> Reporter: SOURCES TELL ABC
[000:06:17;794] NEWS THAT AS THE INTELLIGENCE
[000:06:18;861] COMMUNITY INVESTIGATED RUSSIA'S
[000:06:19;495] ELECTION MEDDLING, IN SOME
[000:06:20;430] CASES, TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
[000:06:22;498] TRANSITION OFFICIALS WERE PICKED
[000:06:25;568] UP IN SURVEILLANCE.
[000:06:26;002] RICE REQUESTING THEIR
[000:06:28;704] IDENTITIES.
[000:06:29;005] TODAY RICE SAID SHE DID INDEED
[000:06:31;374] ASK TO KNOW NAMES.
[000:06:32;608] A REQUEST KNOWN AS UNMASKING,
[000:06:33;376] DONE IN CASES WHERE U.S.
[000:06:34;544] SECURITY IS AT RISK.
[000:06:36;045] AMERICAN IDENTITIES THAT WOULD
[000:06:38;614] OTHERWISE BE ANONYMOUS ARE
[000:06:39;182] REVEALED TO THOSE WITH SECURITY
[000:06:41;751] CLEARANCE, LIKE RICE.
[000:06:43;286] >> IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE
[000:06:44;320] IMPORTANCE OF THE REPORT, AND
[000:06:47;957] ASSESS ITS SIGNIFICANCE, IT WAS
[000:06:48;591] NECESSARY TO FIND OUT, OR
[000:06:49;525] REQUEST THE INFORMATION AS TO
[000:06:50;126] WHO THAT U.S. OFFICIAL WAS.
[000:06:53;830] >> Reporter: RICE WOULDN'T SAY
[000:06:56;332] WHETHER ANY OF THOSE NAMES WERE
[000:06:56;966] TRUMP ASSOCIATES AND SHE
[000:06:57;500] VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT SHE
[000:06:58;868] LEAKED ANY NAMES.
[000:06:59;402] >> I LEAKED NOTHING TO NOBODY
[000:07:01;504] AND NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WOULD.
[000:07:03;573] >> Reporter: AND SAYS THE
[000:07:04;107] UNMASKING WAS A KEY PART OF HER
[000:07:04;740] JOB.
[000:07:08;711] >> WE CAN'T BE PASSIVE CONSUMERS
[000:07:09;812] OF THIS INFORMATION AND NOT --
[000:07:11;414] AND DO OUR JOBS EFFECTIVELY TO
[000:07:12;048] PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[000:07:16;552] IMAGINE IF WE SAW SOMETHING OF
[000:07:17;186] GRAVE SIGNIFICANCE THAT INVOLVED
[000:07:24;360] RUSSIA, OR CHINA, OR ANYBODY
[000:07:24;961] ELSE, INTERFERING IN OUR
[000:07:25;828] POLITICAL PROCESS AND WE NEEDED
[000:07:26;462] TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE
[000:07:27;096] OF THAT.
[000:07:27;997] FOR US NOT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND
[000:07:29;832] IT WOULD BE DERELICTION OF DUTY.
[000:07:30;633] >> Reporter: REPUBLICANS, NOT
[000:07:31;667] BUYING IT.
[000:07:32;201] SENATOR RAND PAUL TWEETING,
[000:07:33;202] "SMOKING GUN FOUND."
[000:07:34;270] SAYING --
[000:07:35;771] >> SO NOW WE KNOW THAT SOMEONE
[000:07:38;941] IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS
[000:07:41;544] EAVESDROPPING AND SPECIFICALLY
[000:07:43;646] SEARCHING A DATABANK LOOKING FOR
[000:07:44;280] THE TRUMP PEOPLE.
[000:07:44;680] >> NO.
[000:07:45;181] NO.
[000:07:45;815] >> THAT'S A BIG DEAL.
[000:07:46;716] >> Reporter: RICE MAINTAINS
[000:07:48;284] THERE WAS NOTHING ILLEGAL, NO
[000:07:51;454] SMOKING GUN, AND NO WIRETAPPING
[000:07:52;989] OF TRUMP TOWER.
[000:07:53;356] >> THERE WAS NO SUCH COLLECTION
[000:07:56;125] OR SURVEILLANCE ON TRUMP TOWER
[000:07:57;160] OR TRUMP INDIVIDUALS AND IT IS
[000:07:57;827] VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND,
[000:08:01;797] AND BY THAT I MEAN DIRECTED BY
[000:08:04;467] THE WHITE HOUSE OR TARGETED AT
[000:08:05;434] TRUMP INDIVIDUALS.
[000:08:05;835] >> LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA,
[000:08:08;604] AND SOME REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING
[000:08:09;238] FOR RICE TO TESTIFY.
[000:08:11;641] WHERE DOES THE WHITE HOUSE
[000:08:12;208] STAND?

[000:08:21;617] TROUBLING, BUT THE CALLS GROWING
[000:08:22;251] LOUDER.
[000:08:23;653] THE REPUBLICANS JUST SENT A

[000:19:17;673] I didn't think there was

[000:19:20;175] But then I realized there was.
[000:19:22;578] So, I finally broke the
[000:19:22;578] silence with my doctor
[000:19:24;379] about what I was experiencing.
[000:19:26;081] He said HUMIRA is
[000:19:26;081] for people like me
[000:19:27;916] who have tried
[000:19:27;916] other medications

[000:19:29;251] the symptoms

[000:19:37;159] And many achieved remission.

[000:21:56;732] weight gain and swelling
[000:21:56;732] of hands, legs, and feet.
[000:21:58;900] Don't drink alcohol while
[000:21:58;900] taking LYRICA.
[000:22:01;103] Don't drive or use machinery
