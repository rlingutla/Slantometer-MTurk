[000:00:06;639] PEOPLE TO STAY HOME.
[000:00:09;109] THE GREATER BOSTON AREA

[000:00:12;379] HEAVILY ARMED OFFICERS IN
[000:00:13;913] WATERTOWN SEARCHED FOR THE
[000:00:14;581] SUSPECT, HOUSE TO HOUSE.
[000:00:16;549] RESIDENTS TRAPPED IN THEIR
[000:00:18;618] HOMES, BUT ANXIOUS TO TALK,

[000:00:29;829] JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE INSIDE
[000:00:31;164] THIS STRANGE NIGHTMARE.
[000:00:33;266] >> 6:08 P.M.
[000:00:36;403] OFFICIALS TELL RESIDENTS THE
[000:00:37;103] IMMINENT THREAT IS OVER AND
[000:00:37;771] THEY'RE FREE TO LEAVE THEIR
[000:00:38;438] HOMES.

[000:00:41;107] APPREHENSION OF OUR SUSPECT THIS
[000:00:43;710] AFTERNOON, BUT WE WILL HAVE ONE.
[000:00:47;080] >> Reporter: NO ONE COULD HAVE
[000:00:48;681] GUESSED HOW QUICKLY THAT WOULD
[000:00:49;649] HAPPEN.

[000:00:51;518] 6:55 P.M.

[000:00:56;723] POLICE CONVERGED ON A HOUSE A
[000:00:58;825] HALF MILE FROM WHERE THEY HAD
[000:00:59;859] LAST SEEN THE SUSPECT MORE THAN
[000:01:00;894] 16 HOURS EARLIER.
[000:01:03;997] WATERTOWN RESIDENT
[000:01:05;065] DAVE HENNEBERRY HAD SEEN
[000:01:06;132] SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS IN THE BOAT
[000:01:06;866] IN HIS BACKYARD.
[000:01:09;169] >> HE LOOKS INSIDE JUST UNDER
[000:01:10;637] THE TARP, SEES A SMALL POOL OF
[000:01:12;505] BLOOD AT THAT POINT.
[000:01:14;240] >> Reporter: AT LEAST 12 MORE
[000:01:16;142] SHOTS ARE FIRED AS S.W.A.T.
[000:01:17;677] TEAMS AND A POLICE HELICOPTER
[000:01:19;179] TAKE UP POSITIONS AROUND AND

[000:01:20;947] NEW PICTURES RELEASED BY

[000:01:24;584] SHOW WHAT THEY SAY IS THE
[000:01:26;686] SUSPECT HIDING IN THE BOAT.
[000:01:27;754] UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS, A
[000:01:28;788] NEGOTIATOR IS RUSHED TO THE

[000:01:50;376] MOTIVATED THE SUSPECTS IS JUST
[000:01:51;111] BEGINNING.
[000:01:51;911] NBC'S NATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE
[000:01:59;119] CORRESPONDENT, MICHAELIS
[000:02:02;188] ISAKOFF, HAS SPENT THE DAY
[000:02:03;890] LOOKING INTO THE MATTER.
[000:02:05;191] >> INVESTIGATORS ARE INTENSELY
[000:02:05;925] FOCUSED ON THE BACKGROUND OF THE
[000:02:06;659] TSARNAEV BROTHERS AND WHAT DROVE
[000:02:07;393] THEM TO TERRORISM.
[000:02:10;430] MEANWHILE, FEDERAL PROSECUTORS
[000:02:11;164] ARE PREPARED TO FILE CRIMINAL
[000:02:11;865] TERRORISM CHARGES THAT COULD
[000:02:13;032] CARRY THE DEATH PENALTY AGAINST
[000:02:15;235] THE SURVIVING 19-YEAR-OLD
[000:02:15;869] SUSPECT.
[000:02:17;837] THE YOUNGER SUSPECT, DZHOKHAR
[000:02:19;939] TSARNAEV, CAPTURED LIVE LAST
[000:02:21;508] NIGHT, IS UNDER GUARD AT A
[000:02:22;175] BOSTON HOSPITAL.
[000:02:24;110] FEDERAL AGENTS ARE WAITING TO
[000:02:25;178] QUESTION HIM.
[000:02:27;247] AS SOON AS HIS MEDICAL CONDITION
[000:02:28;815] ALLOWS, ABOUT WHETHER HE HAD ANY
[000:02:34;053] ACCOMPLICES OR OVERSEAS
[000:02:34;654] CONNECTIONS.
[000:02:36;122] AUTHORITIES BELIEVE HIS OLDER
[000:02:37;690] BROTHER, TAMERLAN, KILLED IN A
[000:02:41;361] GUN BATTLE EARLY FRIDAY MORNING
[000:02:42;395] WHILE WEARING EXPLOSIVES
[000:02:43;029] STRAPPED TO HIS CHEST, MAY HAVE
[000:02:46;599] INSTIGATED THE PLOT AND
[000:02:48;468] PERSUADED DZHOKHAR TO JOIN HIM,
[000:02:49;469] BUT WHY?
[000:02:52;472] THE BROTHERS ORIGINALLY FROM
[000:02:56;676] CHECHNYA, WERE RAISED IN THE
[000:02:57;777] U.S., LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE,
[000:02:59;846] AND SEEMED TO FIT IN.
[000:03:01;247] BOTH WERE ATHLETIC.
[000:03:02;282] DZHOKHAR, A WRESTLER, AND
[000:03:02;916] TAMERLAN, A BOXER.
[000:03:03;416] WHO HOPED TO BE ON THE U.S.
[000:03:04;083] OLYMPIC TEAM.
[000:03:04;751] BUT IN RECENT YEARS, TAMERLAN
[000:03:06;653] HAD CHANGED AND BECAME
[000:03:08;354] RADICALIZED, ACCORDING TO HIS
[000:03:11;424] UNCLE, WHO SAYS HE THEN SPOKE TO
[000:03:12;725] A FAMILY FRIEND.
[000:03:13;326] >> HE SAID THERE IS SOMEONE WHO
[000:03:15;295] BRAINWASHED HIM, SOME NEWLY
[000:03:15;962] CONVERT TO ISLAM.
[000:03:18;631] >> Reporter: IN 2011, RUSSIAN
[000:03:21;601] INTELLIGENCE, CONCERNED ABOUT
[000:03:22;835] THE THREAT OF CHECH KNOWIAN
[000:03:25;371] TERRORISM ASKED THE FBI TO
[000:03:26;272] INVESTIGATE TAMERLAN,
[000:03:27;807] BASED ON INFORMATION THAT HE WAS
[000:03:28;541] A FOLLOWER OF RADICAL ISLAM AND
[000:03:32;212] THAT HE HAD CHANGED DRASTICALLY
[000:03:34;581] SINCE 2010, ACCORDING TO AN FBI
[000:03:36;115] STATEMENT.
[000:03:42;021] THE FBI SAYS A CHECKED
[000:03:42;622] DATABASES, INTERVIEWED TAMERLAN
[000:03:43;356] AND FAMILY MEMBERS, BUT QUOTE
[000:03:44;057] DID NOT FIND ANY TERRORISM
[000:03:44;724] ACTIVITY, DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN.
[000:03:45;425] THE FBI SAYS IT ASKED THE
[000:03:46;059] RUSSIANS FOR MORE, BUT NEVER GOT
[000:03:46;793] ANSWERS.
[000:03:53;499] >> WITHOUT ANY STRONG DEROGATORY
[000:03:54;234] INFORMATION, THE FBI WOULD STILL
[000:03:54;968] BE LIMITED IN WHAT IT COULD DO.
[000:03:56;869] >> Reporter: IN JANUARY, 2012,
[000:03:59;372] TAMERLAN FLEW TO RUSSIA FOR SIX
[000:04:00;106] MONTHS.
[000:04:00;907] WITHIN A MONTH OF HIS RETURN,
[000:04:03;743] IN AUGUST 2012, TAMERLAN SET UP
[000:04:06;846] THIS YOUTUBE ACCOUNT FULL OF
[000:04:08;748] ISLAMIE JIHADI POSTINGS, MANY IN
[000:04:11;117] RUSSIAN, REFLECTING HIS FORMER
[000:04:12;919] LIFE IN CHECHNYA.
[000:04:15;321] IN THIS VIDEO, A RADICAL
[000:04:18;224] PROPHECY.
[000:04:19;626] >> NO ONE CAN STOP THE JIHAD.
[000:04:22;228] >> Reporter: HIS PARENTS SAY
[000:04:23;696] THEIR SONS ARE NOT TERRORISTS
[000:04:25;865] AND HAVE BEEN FRAMED BY THE FBI.
[000:04:27;667] >> Translator: SOMEBODY CLEARLY
[000:04:28;401] FRAMED THEM.
[000:04:29;702] I DON'T KNOW WHO EXACTLY FRAMED
[000:04:30;436] THEM, BUT THEY DID.
[000:04:30;970] THEY FRAMED THEM AND THEY WERE
[000:04:31;704] SO COWARDLY THAT THEY SHOT THE
[000:04:32;438] BOY DEAD.
[000:04:34;173] >> Reporter: FEDERAL AGENTS ARE
[000:04:38;378] DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHAT
[000:04:39;045] MOTIVATED TAMERLAN AND HIS
[000:04:41;047] BROTHER BUT CONGRESSIONALS HAVE
[000:04:46;052] TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR FBI
[000:04:49;122] OFFICIALS ABOUT WHETHER THEY
[000:04:49;822] COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO STOP
[000:04:50;523] THEM.
[000:04:50;823] THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS
[000:04:51;491] DECIDED TO HAVE THE YOUNGER
[000:04:52;225] TSARNAEV QUESTIONED FOR THE
[000:04:53;293] FIRST 48 HOURS BY A SPECIAL HIGH
[000:04:54;027] VALUED INTERROGATION TEAM
[000:04:54;661] WITHOUT ADVISING HIM OF HIS
[000:04:57;797] RIGHTS TO COUNSEL UNDER WHAT IT
[000:04:59;399] CALLS A PUBLIC SAFETY EXCEPTION,
[000:05:00;133] BUT SENATOR JOHN McCAIN AND TWO
[000:05:02;402] REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TONIGHT
[000:05:03;303] SAYS THAT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH.
[000:05:05;371] THEY WANT TSARNAEV TREATED AS AN
[000:05:06;105] ENEMY COMBATANT UNDER THE LAWS
[000:05:06;839] OF WAR.
[000:05:08;941] LESTER?
[000:05:09;275] >> MICHAEL ISAKOFF, THANK YOU.
[000:05:11;644] FOR MORE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S
[000:05:12;345] ATTEMPTS TO FIND OUT WHAT
[000:05:13;513] MOTIVATED THESE SUSPECTS,
[000:05:15;081] WE'RE JOINED BY NBC'S CHIEF
[000:05:15;748] FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,

[000:05:18;618] IN OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU,
[000:05:19;485] ANDREA?
[000:05:20;920] >> GOOD EVENING, LESTER.
[000:05:23;022] INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, THE FBI,
[000:05:24;090] A GLOBAL SEARCH FOR WHAT
[000:05:28;061] MOTIVATED TAMERLAN TSARNAEV'S
[000:05:32;031] TERRORISM.
[000:05:32;899] WAS IT CHECHNYAN NATIONALISM, AT
[000:05:34;500] THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, THE
[000:05:36;035] PRESIDENT MET AGAIN IN THE
[000:05:36;703] SITUATION ROOM WITH HIS NATIONAL
[000:05:37;637] SECURITY ADVISERS.
[000:05:38;671] HE WAS BRIEFED BY THE FBI
[000:05:43;309] DIRECTOR AND TOP
[000:05:44;444] COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS AND
[000:05:45;178] OTHERS FOR 0 MINUTES.
[000:05:46;379] AN OFFICIAL TELLS US AFTERWARDS
[000:05:47;113] THAT SO FAR, THERE IS NO
[000:05:47;747] EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT,
[000:05:48;481] BUT THEY'RE LOOKING.
[000:05:51;084] THEY ALSO SAY THEY ARE GETTING
[000:05:52;485] GOOD COOPERATION NOW FROM
[000:05:54;153] RUSSIA, WITH WHOM AS YOU KNOW
[000:05:55;221] THE U.S. HAS HAD VERY ROCKY
[000:05:57;323] RELATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW
[000:05:58;825] YEARS.
[000:05:59;125] RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT
[000:06:00;827] VLADIMIR PUTIN SPOKE WITH
[000:06:01;861] PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST NIGHT AND
[000:06:02;595] THE TWO LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING
[000:06:03;429] THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING MORE
[000:06:06;699] CLOSELY TOGETHER ON
[000:06:07;233] COUNTERTERRORISM IN THE FUTURE.
[000:06:09;135] THE FBI AS YOU HEARD SAID AFTER
[000:06:12;872] INTERVIEWING TAMERLAN AT
[000:06:16;008] RUSSIA'S REQUEST IN 2011, THEY
[000:06:16;743] SOUGHT AND FAILED TO GET MORE
[000:06:17;443] INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA'S
[000:06:18;077] INTELLIGENCE AND STATE SECURITY
[000:06:18;811] AGENCIES, SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS
[000:06:19;545] STILL TO ANSWER.
[000:06:22;949] DID THESE BROTHERS JOIN EXISTING
[000:06:27;320] SEPARATE CHECHEN FACTIONS?
[000:06:28;721] IF SO, WHY WEREN'T THEY ATTACK
[000:06:29;455] ING RUSSIAN TARGETS?
[000:06:29;989] WHY DID THEY GO AFTER THEIR NEW
[000:06:30;723] HOMELAND, THE U.S.?
[000:06:31;257] THIS IS A BIG MYSTERY.
[000:06:33;960] TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:06:35;194] COMMENDING HIS FEDERAL
[000:06:36;429] OFFICIALS, ALSO STATE AND LOCAL
[000:06:37;196] OFFICIALS, BUT THEY
[000:06:39;098] ARE STILL ASKING WHY DID SOMEONE
[000:06:39;832] WHO WAS ALREADY IN THE FBI'S
[000:06:40;533] DATABASE GET THROUGH THE CRACKS.
[000:06:41;267] LESTER?
[000:06:43;002] >> ALL RIGHT, ANDREA MITCHELL,
[000:06:43;736] THANK YOU.
[000:06:46;873] >>> THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF
[000:06:48;975] WATERTOWN WHERE THIS ALL ENDED
[000:06:50;009] IS ONLY ABOUT 60 OFFICERS STRONG
[000:06:50;743] AND OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, IT
[000:06:52;111] WAS TESTED IN WAYS THAT EVEN THE
[000:06:53;679] BIGGEST POLICE FORCES WILL
[000:06:55;248] RARELY OR EVER EXPERIENCE.
[000:06:57;850] THIS AFTERNOON, I SPOKE WITH
[000:07:01;120] WATERTOWN POLICE CHIEF ED DEVOE
[000:07:03;256] ABOUT THE LARGER IMPLICATIONS OF
[000:07:04;624] WHAT HIS OFFICERS ACCOMPLISHED.
[000:07:08;094] BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN NOW,
[000:07:09;595] THE WEAPONS, THE FACT THEY HAD
[000:07:11;397] OTHER EXPLOSIVES, IN YOUR MIND,
[000:07:13;866] DO YOU THINK THEY WERE PREPARED
[000:07:14;600] TO ATTACK AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE?
[000:07:15;601] >> OH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
[000:07:16;302] FOR SURE, BUT MY GUT TELLS ME
[000:07:17;170] THAT YES.
[000:07:19;272] I MEAN, IF THEY HAVE ANOTHER YOU
[000:07:22;408] KNOW, PRESSURE COOKER BOMB, THEY
[000:07:25;511] WEREN'T SAVING THAT FOR THE
[000:07:27;113] WATERTOWN POLICE.
[000:07:29;982] THEY WERE SAVING THAT FOR
[000:07:32;351] SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE BOSTON
[000:07:34;454] MARATHON.
[000:07:34;821] >> Reporter: YOUR OFFICERS MAY
[000:07:35;555] HAVE STOPPED ANOTHER ATTACK.
[000:07:36;522] >> I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT.
[000:07:39;192] >> CHIEF DEVOE SAYS HE GETS
[000:07:41;561] CHOKED UP WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT
[000:07:42;295] THE CHEERS AND THANKS HIS MEN
[000:07:43;129] AND WOMEN GOT FROM THE CROWDS OF
[000:07:43;863] GRATEFUL RESIDENTS LAST NIGHT
[000:07:44;730] FOR THEIR JOB WELL DONE.
[000:07:48;367] >>> THE SUSPECT IS BEING HELD
[000:07:49;402] AND TREATED IN THE SAME HOSPITAL
[000:07:51;504] AS SOME OF THE VICTIMS OF
[000:07:55;675] MONDAY'S BOMBINGS, AND A POLICE
[000:07:56;709] OFFICER WHO WAS INJURED.

[000:08:02;048] LESTER.
[000:08:02;682] THE SUSPECT IS IN SERIOUS, BUT
[000:08:04;250] STABLE CONDITION HERE AT BETH
[000:08:05;785] ISRAEL AND YES, HE IS IN THE
[000:08:07;386] VERY SAME HOSPITAL AS MANY OF

[000:08:15;228] CHEERS OF JOY, TO A MOMENT OF
[000:08:15;928] SILENCE.
[000:08:19;599] THE CITY OF BOSTON MAY BE
[000:08:21;167] RELIEVED, BUT IT IS STILL IN

[000:08:45;658] ARE 55 MINUTES BEFORE HIS SHIFT
[000:08:46;559] WOULD HAVE ENDED.
[000:08:48;194] >> HE WAS A GREAT YOUNG MAN.
[000:08:48;861] HE WAS WISE BEYOND HIS YEARS.
[000:08:49;762] HIS GOAL WAS ALWAYS TO BECOME A
[000:08:54;967] POLICE OFFICER.
