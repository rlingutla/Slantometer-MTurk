YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
CAN'T DROP FIREFIGHTERS INTO THE
BURN ZONE.

279
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
IF THEY PUT CREWS DOWN ON THE

281
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
NOWHERE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
>> THE GUN, YOU'LL RECALL, WAS

548
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
NEVER FIRED AND FORD WAS NOT
HURT.

549
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
FROOME WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON
IN 2009.

550
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
>>> TOMORROW MARKS THE 50th

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH ON

552
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
WASHINGTON AND MARTIN LUTHER

553
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
KING'S LANDMARK "I HAVE A DREAM"

554
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
SPEECH.

555
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
DR. KING'S YOUNGEST DAUGHTER

556
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
BERNICE WAS JUST 5 MONTHS OLD

557
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
THAT DAY IN 1963.
WE SAT DOWN WITH HER RECENTLY AT

558
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
HISTORIC EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH

559
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
IN ATLANTA WHERE HER FATHER WAS

560
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
PASTOR.

561
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
SHE TALKED ABOUT THE SPEECH AND

562
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
MEMORIES OF HER FATHER.

563
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
HERE'S BERNICE KING IN HER OWN

564
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
WORDS.

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
>> HIM LIFTING ME UP IS EXACTLY

566
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
WHAT I REMEMBER GROWING UP WITH

567
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
MY FATHER.

568
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
YOU KNOW, AS I GREW UP, I HAD A

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
RANGE OF EMOTIONS.

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I BECAME, YOU KNOW, ANGRY.

571
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
ANGRY THAT HE LEFT, ANGRY AT GOD

572
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
FOR NOT PROTECTING HIM.

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
ANGRY AT WHITES AT THE TIME,

574
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
BECAUSE I FELT THEY WERE

575
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEATH.

576
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
ANGRY AT BLACKS BECAUSE I FELT

577
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
WE WEREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO

578
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
CONTINUE HIS WORK.

579
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
AND SO I THINK AT THAT MOMENT, I

580
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS

581
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
CONTRIBUTION, BUT AT THE SAME

582
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
TIME, I REALIZED THE MAGNITUDE

583
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
OF MY OWN LOSS.

584
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
IN THE SENSE THAT, YOU KNOW, WHY

585
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
MY DAD?

586
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
>> BECAUSE I HAVE A DREAM --

587
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
>> EVERY TIME HE SPEAKS, YOU

588
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
KNOW, HE'S CHALLENGING US TO BE

589
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
BETTER, TO DO MORE.

590
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
>> -- THAT MY FOUR LITTLE

591
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
CHILDREN WILL ONE DAY LIVE IN A
NATION WHERE THEY WILL NOT BE

592
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
JUDGED BY THE COLOR OF THEIR

593
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
SKIN, BUT BY THE CONTENT OF

594
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
THEIR CHARACTER.
I HAVE A DREAM.

595
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
>> THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF

596
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
REMEMBERING AND COMMEMORATING IS

597
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
NOT TO BE SATISFIED WITH JUST

598
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'VE

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
MADE, BUT IT'S ALSO TO FURTHER

600
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
INSPIRE US.

601
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
BECAUSE MY MOTHER SAYS TROUBLE

602
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
IS A NEVER ENDING PROCESS.

603
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
FREEDOM IS NEVER REALLY WON, YOU

604
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
EARN IT AND WIN IT IN EVERY

605
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
GENERATION.

606
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
>> FREE AT LAST.

607
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
FREE AT LAST.

608
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
THANK GOD ALL MIGHTY, WE ARE
FREE AT LAST.

609
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY

610
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
TIMES I LISTEN TO IT, IT'S

611
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
ALWAYS, WOW!

612
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I WISH HE WERE HERE.

613
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000

>>> OUR FINAL STORY TONIGHT IS

620
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
ABOUT A SMALL BUT EXTRAORDINARY

621
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
RAY OF HOPE IN A PLACE WHERE

622
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
THERE'S FAR TOO LITTLE HOPE.

623
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
THAT SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
JORDAN.

625
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
NBC'S ANN CURRY HAS THE STORY OF

626
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
ONE YOUNG BOY IN DESPERATE NEED

627
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
OF MEDICAL ATTENTION, AND A

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
DOCTOR WHO'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE

629
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
TO HELP HIM.

ZAATARI CAMP, A DOCTOR LEADS US

632
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
TO ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
HERE.

633
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
SULEMAN, A REFUGEE HIMSELF, WAS

634
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
DETERMINED TO GET HELP FOR A BOY
WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED IT.

635
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
>> WHEN I SAW HIM, THE LIFE IN

636
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
MY EYES DIED.
>> Reporter: THE LIFE IN YOUR

637
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
EYES DIED WHEN YOU SAW HIM?

638
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
>> WHEN I SAW HIM.
>> Reporter: SULEMAN TOOK US TO

639
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
THE BOY'S MOTHER.

640
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
MAY WE SEE YOUR SON?

641
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
SHE LED US DOWN UNMARKED ROADS

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
TO A PLACE WE COULD NOT HAVE

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
FOUND BY OURSELVES, INTO HER

644
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
SMALL SHELTER.

645
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
AND THERE HE WAS, HIS FACE

646
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
GAUNT, HIS ARMS LIKE TWIGS.

647
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
HIS NAME IS IBRAHIM.

648
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
HE IS 10 YEARS OLD, BORN IN

649
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
SYRIA WITH A CONDITION THAT

650
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
CAUSES HIS MUSCLES TO ATROPHY.
PHYSICAL THERAPY HAD HELPED HIM

651
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
WALK, HIS MOTHER SAYS, BUT

652
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
SYRIA'S WAR HAS CHANGED THAT.

653
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, HE'S

654
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
LOST MORE THAN 20% OF HIS BODY

655
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
WEIGHT, CAN NO LONGER STAND, AND

656
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
WON'T EAT.

657
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
WHY CAN'T YOU EAT?

658
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
HE SAYS "MY STOMACH FEELS
FUNNY."

659
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
HIS MOTHER FEARS FOR HIS LIFE.

660
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
SHE SAYS, I'M VERY SAD ABOUT MY

661
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
SON.
HIS FATHER WAS KILLED.

662
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
SINCE THEY FLED HERE, SHE'S

663
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
TRYING TO GET HELP AS HER SON'S

664
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
CONDITION WORSENS.

665
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
BUT SHE SAYS LOCAL CLINICS

666
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
TURNED HER AWAY.

667
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
WE SUGGESTED A CLINIC SHE DIDN'T

668
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
KNOW ABOUT, IN THIS SPRAWLING

669
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000

A RIDE THERE.

YOUNG PHYSICIAN ADMITTED

673
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
IBRAHIM, AND SOON DOCTORS WERE

674
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
GIVING HIM A CHECKUP.

675
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
THEY SAY THEY'LL REFER HIM TO A

676
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
SPECIALIST WHO MIGHT ONE DAY

677
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
HELP HIM WALK AGAIN.

678
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
IN THE MEANTIME, THEY OFFER

679
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND

680
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
WEEKLY CHECKUPS TO HELP HIM GAIN

681
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
WEIGHT AND GET STRONGER.

682
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
TODAY, THAT'S ENOUGH TO GIVE A

683
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
WORRIED MOTHER AND HER SON HOPE

684
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000

695
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
OVER FAIRFIELD, A NEIGHBORHOOD

696
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
RAVAGED BY FIRE.

697
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
THE PD TELLS US AT LEAST FIVE

698
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
HOMES HAVE BURNED, AND AT ONE

699
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
POINT AT LEAST TEN OTHERS WERE

700
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
THREATENED, INCLUDING AN

701
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
APARTMENT COMPLEX.

AS MANY AS 50 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

703
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
EVACUATED.
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE JUST

704
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
AFTER IT BROKE OUT AROUND 3:30

705
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
THIS AFTERNOON.

706
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
STILL WORKING TO CONTAIN THE

710
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
FIRE, BUT IT LOOKS AS IF THEY'VE

711
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
GOTTEN A HANDLE ON IT.

712
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000

713
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
