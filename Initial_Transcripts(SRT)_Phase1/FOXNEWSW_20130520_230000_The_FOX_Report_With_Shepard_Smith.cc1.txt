[000:03:47;16] SCHOOL WHERE EVERYONE IS  
[000:03:48;20] ACCOUNTED FOR.  
[000:03:49;26] AND THERE IS ANOTHER SCHOOL  
[000:03:51;17] BRIER CREEK ELEMENTARY  
[000:03:52;12] WHICH WE WATCHED AS  
[000:03:54;15] RESIDENTS WERE TRYING TO  
[000:03:55;13] BRING PEOPLE FROM  
[000:03:56;12] UNDERNEATH THE RUBBLE THE  
[000:04:00;02] SCHOOL CHILDREN HIT IN A  
[000:04:01;06] BATHROOM IN ONE CASE AS THE  
[000:04:03;02] TORNADO SWEPT RIGHT OVER.  
[000:04:04;19] THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES  
[000:04:05;23] COMING IN.  
[000:04:07;06] IT'S JUST THREE MINUTES  
[000:04:08;19] PAST 6:00 IN THE CENTRAL  
[000:04:10;00] TIME ZONE AND IN MOORE  
[000:04:12;14] OKLAHOMA A THE FOREVER  
[000:04:14;21] PIEWLS OUT YOU CAN SEE THE  
[000:04:16;09] PATH THAT THIS STORM CUT.  
[000:04:17;25] OUR STORM CHASER MENTIONED  
[000:04:19;01] A STORM THAT HIT IN 1999  
[000:04:21;08] THAT IS THE BELLWETHER FOR  
[000:04:22;16] EVERYBODY IN THIS PART OF  
[000:04:23;27] THE COUNTRY.  
[000:04:25;05] IT CUT A PATH THROUGH MOORE  
[000:04:27;04] AND SURROUNDING AREAS LIKE  
[000:04:28;18] NOTHING ANYONE HAD EVER  
[000:04:32;16] SEEN.  
[000:04:32;29] THE PATH OF THIS ONE IS  
[000:04:34;10] SIMILAR, THOUGH LONGER,  
[000:04:35;22] SIMILAR, THOUGH WIDER.  
[000:04:36;25] SO THIS STORM IS SIMILAR  
[000:04:38;17] BUT WORSE.  
[000:04:40;08] AND THAT WAS THE STORM BY  
[000:04:41;24] WHICH ALL OTHERS WERE JUDGE  
[000:04:44;06] DOLLARS.  
[000:04:44;20] IT IS AS IF HURRICANE  
[000:04:46;20] CAMILLE IN SOUTH  
[000:04:48;24] MISSISSIPPI AND LOUISIANA  
[000:04:49;17] WAS ORIGINALLY YOUR  
[000:04:50;08] HURRICANE OF RECORD.  
[000:04:51;04] THIS IS THE THING TO WHICH  
[000:04:52;08] WE POINT AS THE WORST IT  
[000:04:53;23] CAN BE.  
[000:04:55;08] THAT IS UNTIL HURRICANE  
[000:04:57;27] KATRINA CAME THROUGH.  
[000:04:59;05] AND CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE  
[000:05:00;25] ENTIRELY IT IS OUR BELIEF  
[000:05:02;08] THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT WE  
[000:05:04;20] HAVE HAD HERE.  
[000:05:05;19] HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS AFTER  
[000:05:07;17] 999, THE PROBLEM WAS THAT  
[000:05:08;18] SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE  
[000:05:10;27] ADEQUATE STORM SHELTERS.  
[000:05:11;19] THERE WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH  
[000:05:13;27] TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF  
[000:05:15;07] STORM SHELTERS.  
[000:05:16;05] EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEMS  
[000:05:16;28] WERE NOT UP TO DATE THERE  
[000:05:18;08] WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH TO DO  
[000:05:20;02] THAT AND TODAY THEY GOT 16  
[000:05:23;01] MINUTES' WARNING WHICH, IN  
[000:05:24;08] TORNADO ALLEY IS, A LONG  
[000:05:26;00] TIME THAT STORMS WERE ON  
[000:05:27;00] THE WAY.  
[000:05:28;14] IN TORNADO ALLEY YOUR  
[000:05:29;14] FAMILY HAS A PLAN IF YOU  
[000:05:31;26] HAVE ANY SENSE AT ALL OF  
[000:05:33;16] WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN  
[000:05:35;16] THAT SIREN GOES OFF.  
[000:05:37;01] AND JUST YESTERDAY, THEY  
[000:05:38;08] HAD SEVERE DAMAGE FROM  
[000:05:39;17] ANOTHER STORM.  
[000:05:40;05] SO THEY WERE PAYING  
[000:05:41;21] ATTENTION.  
[000:05:42;06] AND HOPEFULLY TODAY MANY  
[000:05:44;00] PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE SAVED  
[000:05:44;28] AS A RESULT.  
[000:05:46;16] KOKH IS ON SCENE AT ONE OF

[000:08:08;14] MISSOURI TORNADO TWO YEARS  
[000:08:09;09] AGO ALMOST TO THE DATE.

[000:28:53;16] UNDERSTANDING THIS TORNADO  
[000:28:54;10] SPENT SO MUCH TIME ON THE  
[000:28:55;07] GROUND THAT 30 SQUARE MILES  
[000:28:58;02] HAVE BEEN HIT BY IT IT IF  
[000:29:01;23] TRUE, WE ARE IN  
[000:29:03;09] RECORD-BREAKING TERRITORY.

[000:29:10;08] THE CHOPPER CONTINUE TO  
[000:29:11;06] COME IN.  
[000:29:12;05] ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF  
[000:29:13;03] THE SCREEN THAT'S THE  
[000:29:13;25] TORNADO AS IT WAS  
[000:29:14;29] DEVELOPING.  
[000:29:15;15] IT WAS JUST BEFORE 4:00  
[000:29:16;29] THIS AFTERNOON EASTERN  
[000:29:18;01] TIME.  
[000:29:18;14] SO 3:00 THERE.  
[000:29:19;09] WE HAVE LOTS OF MONITORS  
[000:29:21;06] COMING IN FROM ALL OVER THE  
[000:29:22;18] COUNTRY AND WE WERE  
[000:29:23;28] WATCHING AS THIS TORNADO  
[000:29:25;03] JUST A LITTLE SLIVER OF A  
[000:29:26;25] THING CAME DOWN OUT OF A  
[000:29:28;11] CLOUD AND IF YOU ARE A  
[000:29:29;27] FLORIDIAN AND YOU LIVE IN  
[000:29:30;24] THE SOUTH.  
[000:29:31;14] IT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU  
[000:29:32;17] MIGHT SEE COME DOWN OVER  
[000:29:33;28] THE GULF OF MEXICO AND JUST  
[000:29:34;25] SORT OF SLIP INTO THE WATER  
[000:29:36;02] AND AGAIN GO BACK INTO THE  
[000:29:37;20] SKY.  
[000:29:38;02] IT WAS JUST A TINY SKY.  
[000:29:43;09] CLOUD CEILING LOWERED AND  
[000:29:45;13] LOWERED.  
[000:29:45;27] THE CLOUDS WERE GETTING  
[000:29:47;04] CLOSER TO THE GROUND.  
[000:29:47;25] THE SIZE OF THE TORNADO AT  
[000:29:49;01] THE GROUND KEPT GETTING  
[000:29:50;06] WIDER AND WIDER.  
[000:29:51;09] GOING APPEAR WHAT APPEARED  
[000:29:52;04] TO BE WIDE OPEN SPACES.  
[000:29:54;03] THEN SUDDENLY YOU COULD  
[000:29:55;18] TELL THERE IS A FARM THERE  
[000:29:56;26] IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS ORB  
[000:29:59;24] FARM.  
[000:30:00;07] AT THIS POINT IT'S BETWEEN  
[000:30:01;01] 1 AND 2 MILES WIDE.  
[000:30:03;16] 106-ACRE FARM THERE WHERE  
[000:30:04;25] 75 TO 100 HORSES WERE  
[000:30:06;19] EITHER TAKEN AWAY BY THIS  
[000:30:10;13] STORM OR KILLED BY THIS  
[000:30:14;22] STORM.  
[000:30:15;05] FROM MOORE OKLAHOMA.  
[000:30:15;28] THAT THIS TORNADO WAS ON A  
[000:30:17;07] PATH SO EERILY SIMILAR TO  
[000:30:18;26] ONE FROM 1999.  
[000:30:20;19] AND SURE ENOUGH, THROUGH  
[000:30:22;07] THAT TOWN IT WENT, A MILE  
[000:30:24;26] WIDE AT THE BOTTOM, TO TWO  
[000:30:26;17] MILES AT SOME POINTS.  
[000:30:28;10] WITH WINDS UP TO 200 MILES  
[000:30:30;29] PER HOUR.  
[000:30:33;02] LIKE CLEAR CUTTING A  
[000:30:35;05] NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE CLEAR  
[000:30:35;29] CUTTING TREES WHERE HOUSES  
[000:30:37;17] COULD REPLACE THEM.  
[000:30:38;19] YET TODAY THE HOUSES WERE  
[000:30:40;20] ALREADY THERE AND MEN,  
[000:30:42;07] WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE IN  
[000:30:43;18] BASEMENTS LISTENING TO THE  
[000:30:44;25] NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE  
[000:30:45;17] RADIO AND HOPEFUL OTHERS

[000:30:48;22] BATHROOMS.  
[000:30:49;07] DOZENS OF KIDS IN A HALLWAY  
[000:30:50;13] AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  
[000:30:52;14] THEIR SAFE PLACE WHEN THE  
[000:30:54;00] ROOF CAME OFF THAT SCHOOL  
[000:30:55;17] AND THE WALLS BEGAN TO  
[000:30:57;16] SWAY.  
[000:30:57;29] AND THE WINDS WERE HOWLING  
[000:30:59;24] LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN AS YOU

[000:31:02;28] TIMES.  
[000:31:03;11] AND BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY,

[000:31:13;18] WHAT'S LEFT.

[000:35:56;19] THAT WAS THE CASE FOR A MAN  
[000:35:58;18] WHICH I SPOKE LIVE JUST TWO  
[000:36:00;02] HOURS AGO.

[000:36:11;22] INSIDE THE SCHOOL THAT THEY  
[000:36:13;11] ARE TRYING TO LOCATE.  
[000:36:15;18] THAT'S ONE EFFORT WE ARE  
[000:36:17;04] TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF  
[000:36:18;04] RIGHT NOW.  
[000:36:20;28] EVERYTHING IN MY SIGHT IS  
[000:36:22;08] COMPLETELY GONE.

[000:36:29;20] LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.  
[000:36:33;07] EVERYTHING THAT CAN I SEE  
[000:36:34;00] IS GONE.  
[000:36:35;11] IT'S JUST -- IT'S SAD.

[000:37:05;16] GONE.  
[000:37:08;26] >> REPORTING FROM A COUPLE  
[000:37:10;03] OF HOURS AGO AS WE WERE

[000:37:14;00] SITUATION IS.  
[000:37:15;03] YOU CAN TELL FROM THE  
[000:37:16;05] DESTRUCTION THAT THE  
[000:37:17;09] PHYSICAL DAMAGE IS BEYOND  
[000:37:19;16] BELIEF.  
[000:37:20;00] BUT OUR HOPE WAS THAT THE  
[000:37:22;06] VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAD  
[000:37:23;16] BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SHELTER  
[000:37:25;10] AND THAT THE LOSS OF LIFE  
[000:37:26;24] WOULD BE MINIMIZED.  
[000:37:28;12] WITH THAT AS A BACKGROUND,  
[000:37:29;20] I CAN TELL IT YOU THAT THE

[000:39:15;01] NEED TO TAKE SHELTER  
[000:39:16;06] IMMEDIATE CATTILY.  
[000:39:17;01] AND THEY RECEIVED THAT WORD  
[000:39:18;06] AFTER KNOWING THAT  
[000:39:19;02] NEIGHBORS IN A NEARBY TOWN  
[000:39:22;20] HAD HAD A DEVASTATING  
[000:39:24;16] TORNADO LESS THAN 18 HOURS  
[000:39:29;06] BEFORE.  
[000:39:29;20] THE WARNINGS WERE OUT.  
[000:39:30;13] THE EVACUATION ORDERS WERE  
[000:39:31;08] SENT OR THE SHELTER IN  
[000:39:33;00] PLACE ORDERS WERE SENT.  
[000:39:36;26] LATE IN THE SCHOOL DAY AT  
[000:39:40;05] PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY  
[000:39:47;09] PLACE DID NOT DO IT.  
[000:39:49;06] AUTHORITIES BELIEVE 24  
[000:39:50;29] THIRD GRADERS WILL NOT COME  
[000:39:52;01] OUT ALIVE.

[000:39:59;29] NATIONAL -- YOU CAN DONATE  
[000:40:00;26] TO THE RED CROSS AND SO THE  
[000:40:04;20] SALVATION ARMY THERE WILL  
[000:40:07;19] BE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD.  
[000:40:10;06] REMEMBER JOPLIN, MISSOURI  
[000:40:11;03] AND THE WIPING OUT OF A  
[000:40:12;18] LARGE PART OF THAT TOWN.  
[000:40:13;14] THE AREA OF DEVASTATION  
[000:40:14;08] HERE IS MUCH LARGER.  
[000:40:17;15] THE EXTENT OF THE  
[000:40:19;06] DEVASTATION IS MUCH WIDER.  
[000:40:20;29] AND WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW  
[000:40:22;25] MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN  
[000:40:32;24] TORNADO DEREK HAS NOT  
[000:40:33;26] PASSED.  
[000:40:37;12] NEXT TWO DAYS THE HEARTLAND  
[000:40:38;21] OF AMERICA CAN EXPECT THIS  
[000:40:39;27] SAME SORT OF THING.  
[000:40:43;07] SO IF YOU ARE IN THAT PART  
[000:40:44;14] OF THE WORLD PROBABLY THE  
[000:40:45;17] FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS  
[000:40:47;09] TO GET A PLAN TOGETHER FOR  
[000:40:49;08] HOW TO BE SAFE.  
[000:40:53;08] IN CASE YOU GET 16 MINUTES  
[000:40:54;20] OF WARNING WHICH FRANKLY  
[000:40:55;25] IS A LONG TIME.  
[000:40:58;04] THIS STORM WAS MOVING VERY  
[000:41:00;06] SLOWLY.  
[000:41:07;22] UNBELIEVABLE 200  
[000:41:08;10] MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.  
[000:41:09;01] WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT  
[000:41:09;24] PATH.  
[000:41:10;07] THE BROWN AREA IS WHERE THE  
[000:41:11;16] TORNADO WAS MOVING.  
[000:41:13;05] THE GREEN AREAS ARE TO THE  
[000:41:14;11] SIDE OF IT.  
[000:41:16;19] THAT'S THE PATH THE TORNADO  
[000:41:18;16] TOOK.  
[000:41:20;07] HOW MANY HOMES YOU CAN  
[000:41:21;06] COUNT ACROSS THERE THE CITY  
[000:41:26;05] MANAGER IS WITH US.  
[000:41:27;25] NIC NAZAR FROM NEARBY NEW  
[000:41:35;18] CASTLE CITY, OKLAHOMA.  
[000:41:37;22] MR. CITY MANAGER THIS NEWS  
[000:41:40;13] OF THESE SCHIRN IS VERY  
[000:41:43;03] DIFFICULT TO DISSEMINATE.  
[000:41:45;22] AND I WONDER HOW THE PEOPLE  
[000:41:47;04] OF YOUR SMALL TOWN ARE  
[000:41:50;28] COPING THIS LATE AFTERNOON.  
[000:41:55;11] I THINK THE THING FOR US  
[000:41:56;25] THIS IS SOMETHING THAT  
[000:41:58;04] HAPPENED IN THE PAST TO OUR  
[000:42:02;04] COMMUNITY AT MOORE.  
[000:42:05;05] [INAUDIBLE] VICTIMS AND  
[000:42:07;01] ESPECIALLY WHENEVER THEY  
[000:42:07;24] ARE CHILDREN.  
[000:42:09;08] TOUCHES EVERYONE.  
[000:42:11;10] THE THING THAT WE TRY TO

[000:47:50;17] SHUT DOWN IN THE AFTERMATH  
[000:47:51;20] OF THIS.  
[000:47:54;05] THE CITY OF OKLAHOMA LOOK

[000:47:56;09] AS PEOPLE TRY TO GET IN AND  
[000:47:57;28] HELP OR TRY TO MAKE THIS  
[000:48:02;08] LATE AFTERNOON.  
[000:48:03;06] MOORE HAS NOW SENT OUT WORD  
[000:48:04;20] THAT THEY NO LONGER NEED  
[000:48:06;17] HELP FROM OTHER CITIES AND  
[000:48:11;26] TOWNS THE RESCUE THEY CAN  
[000:48:14;15] ACCOMPLISH.  
[000:48:15;01] THEY HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO  
[000:48:15;25] DO SO.  
[000:48:16;08] AT THIS MOMENT THEY ARE  
[000:48:17;19] JUST WORKING TO TRY TO FIND  
[000:48:19;00] WHO MAY BE ALIVE OUT THERE.  
[000:48:20;14] IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

[000:48:22;18] GET TO ALL OF THE AREAS  
[000:48:24;25] AFFECTED NOW.  
[000:48:25;20] WHETHER THEY ARE ABLE TO  
[000:48:26;15] GET INTO ALL OF THEM IS  
[000:48:27;20] ANOTHER MATTER.  
[000:48:28;08] AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

[000:49:00;21] NOW.  
[000:49:01;03] THIS IS BREAKING NEWS ON

[000:49:02;23] WE WILL GO LIVE TO THE  
[000:49:03;22] SCENE AFTER THIS.
[000:49:10;00] Why are twice as many people  choosing
[000:49:10;20] Verizon  over any other carrier?
[000:49:14;05] Many choose us because we have  the
[000:49:14;26] largest 4GLTE network.
[000:49:19;05] Others, because of our  reputation
[000:49:19;25] for reliability.
[000:49:22;25] Or maybe it's because  we've received
[000:49:23;17] JD Power
[000:49:24;19] and Associates' customer service 
[000:49:25;09] award 4X in a row.
[000:49:28;18] In the end  there are countless reasons.
[000:49:31;11] But one choi.
[000:49:35;10] If you're suffering from  constipation
[000:49:36;26] Miralax or Metamucil may take  days
[000:49:37;18] to work.  or faster relief, try Dulcolax
[000:49:39;18] laxative tablets.  Dulcolax provides
[000:49:41;21] gentle relief  overnight unlike Miralax
[000:49:44;17] and Metamucil that can take up  to
[000:49:45;09] 3 days.  For predictable relief try
[000:49:47;09] Dulcolax.  You thought this beach
[000:49:51;23] couldn't  get any more tempting...
[000:49:54;10] ... you thought  wrong.
