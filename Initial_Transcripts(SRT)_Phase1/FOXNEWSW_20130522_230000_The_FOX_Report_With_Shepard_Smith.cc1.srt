00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
WHO DIED IN THE TORNADO

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
MONDAY.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
10 OF THOSE VICTIMS,

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
CHILDREN.
TWO OF THOSE INFANTS, LESS

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
THAN A YEAR OLD.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
ONE MAN WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
AMONG THOSE KILLED AT PLAZA

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
SAYS HE ARRIVED THERE 10

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
MINUTES AFTER THE TWISTER

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
HIT AND HE SAYS WHEN HE

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
FINALLY RETURNED TO HIS

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
HOUSE, WITHOUT HIS CHILD

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
HIS HOME WAS GONE.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
THE LATEST OFFICIAL

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ESTIMATES INDICATE THIS

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
DESTROYED UP TO 13,000

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
HOMES.
I MENTIONED EARLIER WE GOT

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A LOOK FROM THE SKY AND A

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
LENGTHY ONE.
WE WERE UP FOR HOURS

45
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
LOOKING AT THE DESTRUCTION
THE TORNADO INFLICTED.

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
IT IS A BROKEN LINE OF

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
OBLITERATION.
A SCAR ACROSS AMERICA'S

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
HEART LAND.
ONE THAT STRETCHES FOR MANY

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
MILES.
>> WE'RE STARTING IN PLAZA

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE THE

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
SEVEN CHILDREN DIED.

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
AND THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
WE WATCHED FROM THE

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
HELICOPTER TWO DAYS AGO AS

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
RESCUE WORKERS AND

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
NEIGHBORS WERE PULLING AWAY

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
ALL OF THE -- WHAT WAS LEFT

59
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
OF THE SCHOOL TO TRY TO GET

60
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
TO THE CHILDREN.

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
IN HOPES, IN HOPES THAT

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THEY COULD GET SOME OUT

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
ALIVE.
AS IT TURNED OUT, IT WAS AN

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
AWFUL SCENE THERE.

65
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
BUT THEY ARE HARD AT WORK

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
TODAY, TRYING TO REMOVE

67
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
WHAT'S THERE.
BECAUSE THE GOAL NOW IS TO

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES.

69
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
ALONG THE PATH OF THE

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
STORM.

73
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
THE SCHOOL ACROSS ABOUT A

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
FOUR TO FIVE MILE AREA OF

76
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
THE WORST OF DESTRUCTION.

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
YOU WILL SEE HOW THE WIDTH

78
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
OF THE STORM THE WIDTH OF

79
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
THIS TORNADO CHANGES AS WE

80
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
MOVE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.

81
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
SCOTT, TAKE US OUT THERE IF

82
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
YOU COULD.

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
AND THIS -- WE'RE IN THE

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
SCHOOL AREA NOW AND AS HE

85
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
ZOOMS, IN YOU WILL BE ABLE

86
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
TO SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR

87
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
AREA HOMES WERE REDUCED TO

88
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

89
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
WHERE THE STORM WAS AT ITS

91
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
WIDEST.

92
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
THINK OF THIS AS A FUNNEL

93
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
LIKE YOU WOULD USE IN YOUR

94
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
KITCHEN.
THE TIP OF THE FUNNEL IS

95
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
VERY THIN.

96
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
THE TOP IS VERY WIDE.

97
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
BUT IF YOU COULD PUSH THAT

98
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
FUNNEL DOWN INTO THE

99
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
GROUND, THE AREA WHICH IS

100
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
CONCENTRATED ON THE GROUND,

101
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
IT'S WIDER.

102
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

103
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
THAT'S WHY IN THIS AREA

104
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
THE WIDTH OF THE STORM THE

105
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
WIDTH OF THE TORNADO WAS
ABOUT TWO MILES.

106
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SO THE AREA OF DESTRUCTION

107
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
IS MASSIVE AND THE DENSITY

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
OF IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.

109
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
YOU DON'T SEE A BUNCH OF

110
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
HOUSES STILL THAT MIGHT BE

111
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
ABLE TO BUILD AROUND.

112
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
YOU SEE NOTHING BUT DEBRIS.

113
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY -- AS

114
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
IF A GIANT CAME IN AND

115
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
SQUISHED IT IN HIS HAND AND

116
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
DROPPED IT IT ON THE

117
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
GROUND.

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THROUGHOUT THIS AREA, NOW

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
THE PATH OF THE DESTRUCTION

120
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
IS THINNER.

121
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
THE CLOUDS LIFTED UP SOME.

122
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
AND THE AREA OF THE FUNNEL

123
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
CLOUD THAT WAS TOUCHING THE

124
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
GROUND IS SMALLER.
YOU WILL SEE SOME THE

125
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
DESTRUCTION ISN'T QUITE AS

126
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
SEVERE.

127
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS YOU

128
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
WILL SEE BLUE TARPS ON TOP

129
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
OF HOUSE AFTER HOUSE.

130
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE THEY
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

131
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
SALVAGE THE HOME.

132
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
BUT, BEHIND US, IT WASN'T

133
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

134
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
SCOTT, PULL OUT AND SHOW

135
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
FORWARD IF YOU WOULD, AND

136
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
YOU WILL SEE AHEAD OF US

137
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
THE PATH OF THE STORM WAS

138
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
MUCH THINNER, MEANING THE

139
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
CLOUDS HAD LIFTED HIGHER

140
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
AND THE PART OF THE CONE

141
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE

142
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
GROUND IS MUCH SMALLER.

143
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
THE WINDS GET STRONGER AND

144
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
WEAKER AS THE STORM MOVES

145
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ALONG LIKE ANYTHING ELSE

146
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IT PICKS UP ENERGY AND IN

147
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
SPURTS IT WILL BE STRONGER

148
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

149
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
WE ARE A LITTLE MORE THAN

150
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
HALFWAY THROUGH THE

151
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
DESTRUCTION OF THIS NOW.

152
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
AND YOU CAN SEE AGAIN I'M

153
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA

154
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS.

155
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
WE ARE FLYING ALONG A

156
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
STRAIGHT LINE.
AND AS YOU LOOK ALONG THAT

157
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
STRAIGHT LINE.

158
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER

159
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE AFTER

160
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
HOUSE, JUST COMPLETELY

161
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
OBLITERATED.

162
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
IF HE PULLS OUT JUST A

163
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
LITTLE BIT, YOU WILL SEE

164
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
THAT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT

165
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
OF THE SHOT, THERE ARE

166
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
HOUSES THAT ARE JUST FINE.

167
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
THIS ISN'T A TWO MILE WIDE

168
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
PATH IN THIS AREA.

169
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
IT'S MUCH THINNER THAN THAT

170
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
IN SOME AREAS IT'S JUST A

171
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
FEW HUNDRED YARDS WIDE.

172
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
BUT IF YOUR HOME WAS IN

173
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THAT AREA, YOUR HOME IS

174
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
DESTROYED.

175
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
IF YOU WERE JUST TO THE

176
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
LEFT OR RIGHT OF IT YOU

177
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
MIGHT HAVE SOME ROOF DAMAGE

178
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
AND THEN THE NEXT SERIES OF

179
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
HOUSES OVER, THERE MIGHT BE

180
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
DEBRIS FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR'S

181
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
HOME, WHAT USED TO BE YOUR

182
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
NEIGHBOR'S HOME ON TOP OF

183
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
YOUR HOUSE OR IN YOUR YARD.

184
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BUT YOUR HOUSE ITSELF IS

185
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
FINE.

186
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS

187
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
STORM.
NOW, BACK TO THE PATH OF IT

188
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
ITSELF.
AND WE ARE COMING INTO AN

189
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
AREA THAT'S MORE -- THAT'S

190
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000

191
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
YOU WILL SEE AN AREA WHERE

192
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000

DIRT AND REPLACED THE GRASS

194
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000

195
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000

197
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
AND JUST AHEAD OF US IS THE

198
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE

751
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
VEHICLE.
AND YOU CAN SEE MATTRESSES,

752
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
BOARDS, ON TOP OF EACH

753
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
OTHER COMING UP ON THE
LEFT-HAND SIDE IS GOING TO

754
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
BE AN UPROOTED TREE.

755
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
THIS TREE THAT YOU SEE HAS

756
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
ALL OF ITS NEEDLES AND

757
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
LEAVES STILL ON IT AND AS

758
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
YOU HAVE SEEN, SHEPARD THE

759
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
WINDS SO POWERFUL IT CAN

760
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
STRIP THE BARK RIGHT OFF OF

761
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
TREES.

762
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
LET'S GO AHEAD NOW AND

763
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
SWITCH BACK TO THE RIGHT

764
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
JEREMY IF WE CAN AND CAN

765
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
YOU SEE THAT THE DAMAGE IS

766
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
EXTREMELY RANDOM.

767
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
YOU HAVE SOME HOMES THAT

768
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
JUST MAY HAVE SOME SHINGLES

769
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
MISSING FROM THEM AND RIGHT

770
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
NEXT DOOR YOU HAVE TOTAL

771
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
DESTRUCTION.
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING

772
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
COMING UP ON THE RIGHTS

773
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
HERE.

774
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
THIS GARAGE COMPLETELY
STANDING BUT YOU CAN SEE

775
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
THAT THE HOME AND ALL OF

776
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
THE DEBRIS IN THE MIDDLE OF

777
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
THE HOME IS JUST ALL STREWN

778
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
ABOUT.

779
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
LET'S GO AGAIN TO THE LEFT

780
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THESE

781
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE AREAS

782
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
ARE RESTRICTED FOR OBVIOUS

783
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
REASONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE

784
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
TO LET THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

785
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
HERE COME AND GET TO THEIR

786
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
HOMES, GET TO THEIR

787
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
BELONGINGS AND TRY TO

788
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SALVAGE WHAT THEY CAN.

789
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

790
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
TODAY.

791
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
PEOPLE STANDING ON PILES OF

792
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
RUBBLE.
SAT WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND

793
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
NOW THEY FIND THEMSELVES

794
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
STANDING ON MERE SPLINTERED

795
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
BOARDS AND MATTRESSES AND

796
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
ELECTRICAL WIRES AND JUST

797
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
HEART BREAK IS WHAT IT IS.

798
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
AND SHEPARD BACK OUT HERE

799
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
LIFE TO US IN THE CAR, YOU

800
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
KNOW, THIS IS ONE THING

801
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
THAT WE ARE SEEING.

802
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
THE RESOLVE OF THESE

803
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
PEOPLE.
THEY SAY THAT THEY REBUILT

804
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
IN 1999.

805
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
YOU CAN TALK TO ME PEOPLE

806
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
WHEN THEY ARE ON TOP OF

807
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
THEIR-WHAT WAS THEIR HOME

808
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
AND THEY ARE IN GOOD

809
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
SPIRITS FOR THE MOST PART.

810
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
DESPITE EVERYTHING.

811
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING

812
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
THE RESOLVE.
AND THEY SAY WE HAVE

813
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
REBUILT BEFORE AND WE'RE

814
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

815
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000

STUDENTS IN ELEMENTARY

824

THEY HAVE BEEN DRONED TO

DEATH.
ONLY ONE OF THOSE AMERICANS

WAS EVEN THE TARGET OF THAT

834
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000

879
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OVER
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT

880
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
FEW TO ME HAVE BEEN AS

881
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
INSPIRING AS THAT OF

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
WHEN THE TORNADO WARNINGS

887
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
PARENTS OF HER CHILDREN

888
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
RUSHED TO THAT SCHOOL, GOT

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
THEIR KIDS, TOOK THEM AWAY.

890
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
BUT WHEN THE TORNADO HIT

891
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
SHE STILL HAD 10 CHILDREN

892
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
THERE.

893
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
THEIR LIVES IN HER HANDS.

894
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
HERE IS THERESA MOSIER.

895
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
>> YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN UP

896
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
AGAINST THE INSIDE WALL.

897
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
YOU HAVE THEM GET DOWN ON

898
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
THEIR KNEES.

899
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR

900
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
HEAD AND PUT THEIR HEADS

901
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
YOU KNOW, DOWN.

902
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
AND THEN AS WE HEARD IT

903
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
APPROACHING, BECAUSE YOU
COULD HEAR IT IT WAS LIKE

904
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
10 FREIGHT TRAINS.

905
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
AND AS IT APPROACHED, YOU

906
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
KNOW, I JUST PUT MY ARMS

907
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
OVER THE CHILDREN.

908
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING IS

909
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
GOING TO BE OKAY.

910
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, YOU

911
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE SO

912
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR

913
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
SAFETY.
THERE IS NOT A ONE OF US IN

914
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
THAT BUILDING THAT WOULD

915
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
NOT HAVE LAID DOWN OUR

916
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
LIVES FOR THOSE KIDS.

917
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
AND THEY WERE SCARED.

918
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
THEY ARE CRYING THEY ARE

919
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
UPSET.
BUT THOSE ARE THE BRAVEST

920
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE

921
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
WORLD.

922
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
>> I THINK THEY WOULD SAY

923
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
YOU ARE THE BRAVEST TEACHER

924
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
IN THE WORLD.

925
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
WELL, WHEN IT HAD HAD

926
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
PASSED OVER THROUGH THEIR

927
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
TEARS, THROUGH EVERYTHING,

928
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
THEY GOT UP THEY HELPED

THEIR CLASSMATES' LEGS.

931
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
THEY HELPED TO UNWIND WIRES

932
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
AND METAL THAT HAD WRAPPED

933
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
AROUND ANOTHER STUDENT'S

934
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
LEGS.

935
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
EVEN IN THAT THEY STILL

936
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
KNEW TO HELP THEIR

937
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
CO-WORKERS AND SO I'M SO

938
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
PROUD OF THEM.

939
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'M SO PROUD TO BE THEIR

940
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
TEACHER BECAUSE THEY ARE

941
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
REMARKABLE AND RESILIENT

942
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
CHILDREN.
>> THERE IS A LOT OF

943
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
FAMILIES THANKING YOU FOR

944
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN
ALIVE TODAY.

945
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
>> WELL, THERE WASN'T AN

946
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
OPTION.

947
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION NOT TO

948
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
KEEP THEM ALIVE.

949
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I HAVE CHILDREN OF MY OWN.

950
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
AND I KNOW THAT ANY TEACHER

951
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
IN THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE

952
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
DONE THE SAME EXACT THING.

953
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE

954
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
SURE THOSE CHILDREN SAW

955
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
THEIR PARENTS AGAIN.

956
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
AND THEIR PARENTS SAW THEM.

957
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
>> SHE CALLED THOSE FOURTH

958
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
GRADERS BRAVE AND

959
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
REMARKABLE.

960
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
SHEP.
I'M NOT SURE I HAVE MET

961
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
ANYBODY AS BRAVE OR AS

962
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
REMARKABLE AS THERESA

963
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
MOSIER HERSELF.

964
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.

965
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
>> Shepard: VERY

966
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
IMPRESSIVE.

967
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
JONATHAN, THANKS FOR HER
STORY.

968
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
WELL, FOR THE FIRST TIME

969
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS NOW

970
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
CONFIRMING FOUR AMERICAN

971
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
CITIZENS HAVE BEEN KILLED

972
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
IN WHAT IT CALLS SENSITIVE

973
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
COUNTER TERRORISM

974
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
OPERATIONS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

975
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
IT MEANS THE GOVERNMENT

976
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
DRONED THEM.

977
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
THE FEDS ARE ALSO ADMITTING

978
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
THAT THEY MEANT TO KILL

979
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
ONLY ONE OF THOSE

980
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
AMERICANS.

981
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS

982
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTED TO
RELEASE THE LIST BEFORE HE

983
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
GIVES A SPEECH ON NATIONAL

984
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
SECURITY.
THAT'S SET FOR TOMORROW.

985
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
JENNIFER GRIFFIN IS AT THE

986
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
PENTAGON FOR US TONIGHT.

987
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
WHO ARE THESE FOUR

988
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
AMERICANS WHOM OUR

989
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
GOVERNMENT KILLED?

990
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
>> WELL, IT'S INTERESTING

991
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
SHEPARD.

992
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
IN HIS LETTER TO CONGRESS

993
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC

994
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
HOLDER DID NOT ACTUALLY USE

995
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
THE WORD DRONE OR UNMANNED

996
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
AERIAL VEHICLE AS SOME NEWS

997
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED.

998
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
BUT INSTEAD, AS YOU

999
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
MENTIONED, HE USED THE

1000
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
PHRASE SENSITIVE COUNTER

1001
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
TERRORISM OPERATIONS TO

1002
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
DESCRIBE HOW THESE FOUR

1003
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
AMERICANS WERE KILLED.

1004
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE

1005
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
ADMINISTRATION HAS ADMITTED

1006
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
THAT IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

1007
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
KILLING THESE AMERICANS.

1008
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
WHO WERE THEY?

1009
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
WHO WERE THESE AMERICANS?

1010
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
ANWAR AL-AWLAKI WAS ONE OF

1011
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
THEM.
HE INTENDED TO BRING DOWN A

1012
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
U.S. PLANE WITH THE

1013
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
UNDERWEAR BOMBER.

1014
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT AL

1015
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
AWLAKI'S 16-YEAR-OLD SON

1016
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
WAS ALSO KILLED.

1017
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
IRAQMAN.

1018
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
THEN THERE WAS SAMIR KHAN.

1019
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
THE EDITOR OF INSPIRE

1020
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
MAGAZINE AND -- NORTH

1021
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
KOREAN WHO LEFT FOR

PAKISTAN IN 2008 AND

1023
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
INDICTED FOR A PLOT TO BLOW

1024
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
UP BRIDGES AND TUNNELS IN

1025
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
THE UNITED STATES.

1026
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
HOLDER SAYS ONLY AL AWLAKI,

1027
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
ANWAR AL-AWLAKI WAS

1028
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
TARGETED DIRECTLY, SHEPARD.

1029
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S MY

1030
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
UNDERSTANDING JENNIFER

1031
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
EXPECTED TO MAKE SOME VERY

1032
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
BIG NEWS ON GUANTANAMO BAY

1033
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
HIS SPEECH TOMORROW.

1034
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1035
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
IN FACT THE PRESIDENT
DURING HIS SPEECH TOMORROW

1036
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
PLANS TO ANNOUNCE WE KNOW

1037
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
ACCORDING TO SOURCES, PLANS

1038
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS

1039
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
LIFTING RESTRICTIONS ON THE

1040
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
TRANSFER OF DETAINEES FROM

1041
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
GUANTANAMO BAY TO YEMEN.

1042
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
THAT PROCESS HAD BEEN

1043
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
FROZEN.
THE TRANSFER OF THOSE

1044
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
DETAI YEMEN HAD BEEN

1045
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
FROZEN FOR SOME TIME.

1046
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THE RENEWED COOPERATION

1047
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
WITH YEMEN IS LIKELY TO

1048
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
DECREASE THE GITMO DETAINEE

1049
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
POPULATION WE'RE TOLD WHICH

1050
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000

1051
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000

1052
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
103 OF THOSE PRISONERS ARE

1053
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
CURRENTLY ON HUNGER STRIKE.

1054
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
THEY ARE BEING FORCE FED

1055
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
FOR THE PAST 100 DAYS.

1056
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
THE PRESIDENT, AS YOU WILL

1057
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
REMEMBER, PROMISED TO CLOSE

1058
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
GITMO WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE.

1059
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
BUT HE HAS BEEN STYMIED IN

1060
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
DOING SO SHEPARD.

1061
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
>> Shepard: JENNIFER

1062
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
GRIFFIN REPORTING FROM THE

1063

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
LITTLE DRAMA OVER ON

1065
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
CAPITOL HILL TODAY WHEN A

1066
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
TOP IRS OFFICIAL SHOWED UP
AT THE HEARING AND TOOK THE

1067
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
FIFTH.
ONE REPUBLICAN THOUGH SAID

1068
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
NOT SO FAST.

1069
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
LOIS LERNER IS THE HEAD OF

1070
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THE AGENCY'S TAX EXEMPT

1071
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
DIVISION.

1072
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
SHE HAS APOLOGIZED FOR

1073
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
STAFFERS TARGETING
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS THAT

1074
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
APPLIED FOR TAX EXEMPT

1075
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
STATUS.
TODAY SHE REFUSED TO ANSWER

1076
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

1077
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
SCANDAL.

1078
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
BUT ONE REPUBLICAN SAYS

1079
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
LERNER TRIED TO HAVE IT

1080
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
BOTH WAYS.

1081
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
BY ALSO PLEADING HER CASE

1082
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
IN AN OPENING STATEMENT.

1083
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
>> I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING

1084
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
WRONG.

1085
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I HAVE NOT BROKEN ANY LAWS.

1086
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW MY

1087
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
COUNSEL'S ADVICE AND NOT

1088
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
TESTIFY OR ANSWER ANY OF

1089
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
THE QUESTIONS TODAY.

1090
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
>> SHE JUST TESTIFIED.

1091
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
SHE JUST WAIVED HER FIFTH

1092
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

1093
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
PRIVILEGE.
YOU DON'T GET TO TELL YOUR

1094
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
SIDE OF THE STORY AND THEN

1095
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
NOT BE SUBJECTED TO

1096
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
CROSS-EXAMINATION.

1097
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
>> THE GENTLE LADY WHO HAS

1098
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
DEPARTED WAS ENTITLED TO

1099
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
ASSERT HER FIFTH AMENDMENT

1100
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME

1101
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
QUESTIONS HOW IT WAS DONE

1102
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
IT THERE COULD BE NO

1103
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
QUESTION THAT WE HAVE TO

1104
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
RESPECT IT.

1105
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
>> WELL, THAT'S CHAIRMAN

1106
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
DARRELL ISSA.
HE SAYS THE COMMITTEE WILL

1107
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
CALL LERNER BACK TO TESTIFY

1108
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
IF THE LAWYERS DECIDE SHE

1109
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
DID BREAK ANY RULES.

1110
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
DOUG McKELWAY IS ON THIS

1111
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
FROM WASHINGTON TONIGHT.

1112
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
DOUG?

1113
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
>> SHEP, WHEN SOMEBODY
CLAIMS THE FIFTH THEY

1114
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
USUALLY DO SOUGHT WITHOUT

1115
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
EQUIVOCATION.

1116
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
THEY STATE IT, AND THEN

1117
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
THEY SHUT UP.

1118
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
NOT SO LOIS LERNER.

1119
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN TREY

1120
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000

Others, because of our  reputation
for reliability.

>> ON THIS DAY IN 1999, THE

1693
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
PEOPLE OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA

1694
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
HAD BEEN CLEANING UP FOR 19

1695
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
DAYS.
FROM THE WORST TORNADO THAT

1696
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
HAD EVER STRUCK THIS AREA.

1697
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
19 DAYS LATER IT WAS AS IF

1698
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
IT MIGHT NEVER END.

1699
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000

THAT DAY THERE WAS SO MUCH

1702
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
WORK TO BE DONE.

1703
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THEY

1704
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO

1705
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000

1706
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
THEY HAD BEEN LOADING TRUCK

1707
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000

00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
OVERWHELMING.
IT WAS LIKE YOU GO TO THAT

YOU EAT FOR 30 MINUTES AND

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE

1716
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING.

1717
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
IT'S MUCH THE SAME WAY
