[000:00:12;379] MARATHON RUNNERS AND SPECTATORS
[000:00:13;113] VIOLENTLY INJURED.
[000:00:17;817] THE TWO EXPLOSIONS
[000:00:18;785] GOING OFF WITHIN SECONDS OF EACH
[000:00:19;953] OTHER AT BOSTON'S COPLEY SQUARE.
[000:00:20;687] >> AT FIRST IT SOUNDED LIKE A
[000:00:21;388] CANNON BLAST.
[000:00:22;222] IT FELT SO STRONG IT ALMOST BLEW
[000:00:23;623] MY HAT OFF.
[000:00:25;091] EVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING THE
[000:00:26;192] OTHER WAY.
[000:00:27;627] THERE WERE PEOPLE RUNNING OVER
[000:00:28;528] TOWARDS THEM TO HELP THE
[000:00:29;162] INJURED.
[000:00:30;363] THERE WERE REALLY BAD, BAD
[000:00:31;031] INJURIES.

[000:00:42;108] THE FIRST EXPLOSION WENT OFF ON
[000:00:42;842] BOYLSTON STREET.
[000:00:44;110] THE SECOND A BLOCK AWAY.
[000:00:46;246] A PLACE OF CELEBRATION INSTANTLY
[000:00:48;248] TRANSFORMED INTO A SCENE OF
[000:00:51;217] CHAOS.
[000:00:52;385] >> EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.
[000:00:53;353] EVERYONE WAS RELAXED AND HAPPY.
[000:00:56;089] THEN THE EXPLOSION RIGHT NEXT TO
[000:00:59;492] THE FINISH LINE.
[000:01:00;493] AND THEN WITHIN ANOTHER MAYBE 30
[000:01:01;227] SECONDS, ANOTHER EXPLOSION.
[000:01:03;596] AND THEN PANDEMONIUM STRUCK.
[000:01:08;868] >> Reporter: NOW THERE WAS A
[000:01:10;703] RACE OF A DIFFERENT KIND -- TO
[000:01:11;438] RESCUE PEOPLE AND SAVE THEM.
[000:01:13;540] >> I WAS CARRYING SOMEBODY WHO
[000:01:15;975] LOST BOTH OF THEIR LEGS IN THE
[000:01:17;577] EXPLOSION.
[000:01:20;680] IT WAS A LOT OF THEM WITH LOST
[000:01:22;248] LIMBS.
[000:01:22;549] CATASTROPHIC.
[000:01:23;917] >> IT WAS LOUD.
[000:01:25;085] IT WAS REALLY, REALLY LOUD.
[000:01:27;587] THEN CHAOS EVERYWHERE.

[000:01:55;215] INTO ACTION.

[000:01:58;885] FROM 96 COUNTRIES SIGNED UP FOR

[000:02:04;891] THOSE STILL ON THE COURSE WERE
[000:02:05;892] DIVERTED AWAY FROM THE FINISH
[000:02:06;893] LINE.
[000:02:09;329] AUTHORITIES WOULD NOT SPECULATE
[000:02:10;063] ON WHETHER IT WAS TERRORISM.
[000:02:11;164] >> WE ARE NOT BEING DEFINITIVE
[000:02:13;800] ON THIS RIGHT NOW.

[000:02:28;214] SENDING HELP TO BOSTON AS IS THE
[000:02:29;215] FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
[000:02:32;352] BOSTONIANS ARE TOLD TO STAY
[000:02:33;019] INDOORS.
[000:02:35;054] IF THEY HAVE TO GO OUT TO AVOID
[000:02:35;788] LARGE CROWDS.
[000:02:38;892] WHILE AUTHORITIES TRY TO FIGURE
[000:02:40;026] OUT WHO BROUGHT TO SUCH A

[000:02:42;495] PEOPLE IN BOSTON, BRIAN, HAVE
[000:02:44;564] ALWAYS CALLED THE VERY BEST DAY.
[000:02:45;331] >> ABSOLUTELY.
[000:02:48;001] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
[000:02:50;403] LET'S GO TO KATY TUR WHO MADE
[000:02:51;271] HER WAY UP THERE.
[000:02:52;805] AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE 15
[000:02:55;942] BLOCKS THAT ARE VIRTUALLY
[000:02:56;576] FROZEN.
[000:02:57;810] PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO
[000:03:01;447] SHELTER IN PLACE AND ONCE THEY
[000:03:03;516] GO OUT, AVOID CROWDS WHICH IS
[000:03:04;617] TRICKY ON THIS DAY WHICH IS A
[000:03:05;752] HOLIDAY EVERY YEAR.
[000:03:08;321] >> Reporter: IT'S PRETTY TRICKY
[000:03:09;622] IN THIS AREA, BRIAN.
[000:03:10;323] THIS IS THE BACK BAY OF BOSTON.
[000:03:11;591] IT IS A POPULAR AREA.
[000:03:13;326] IT IS A BUSY AREA ON A NORMAL
[000:03:14;427] DAY.
[000:03:15;428] IT IS CHAOTIC HERE DURING THE
[000:03:16;129] MARATHON IN A GOOD WAY.
[000:03:19;566] IT'S CELEBRATORY.
[000:03:20;567] THE BARS ARE OPEN.
[000:03:21;701] PEOPLE ARE OUT.
[000:03:22;268] RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE.
[000:03:23;002] THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING
[000:03:23;703] ON.
[000:03:24;704] I GUESS THEY ARE TRYING NOT TO
[000:03:25;438] CONGREGATE.
[000:03:26;105] FOR THE MOST PART IT'S QUIET FOR
[000:03:26;839] THIS AREA.
[000:03:27;974] AFTER THE EXPLOSION THERE WERE
[000:03:30;510] STREAMS OF PEOPLE WALKING THE
[000:03:31;377] STREETS.
[000:03:33;513] THE SUBWAYS WERE SHUT DOWN AND
[000:03:36;916] BECAUSE OF THAT, PEOPLE HAD TO
[000:03:38;251] WALK FOR MILES IN SOME CASES TO
[000:03:40;186] THEIR DESTINATION.
[000:03:41;221] IN FACT, WE ARE TWO BLOCKS FROM
[000:03:42;188] THE FINISH LINE.
[000:03:43;056] TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE THE
[000:03:43;890] EXPLOSIONS HAPPENED.
[000:03:46;459] WE SAW A WOMAN RIGHT OVER HERE,
[000:03:48;761] WITNESSES SAW HER STUMBLING TO
[000:03:49;696] THIS BLOCK WITH SHRAPNEL WOUNDS.
[000:03:52;432] NBC HAS CONFIRMED SHRAPNEL WAS
[000:03:58;471] PART OF THEEGS -- THESE
[000:03:59;639] EXPLOSIONS.
[000:04:00;240] THAT'S WHY THERE WERE LOWER LIMB
[000:04:00;974] INJURIES.
[000:04:01;541] PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING
[000:04:02;141] TOURNIQUETS APPLIED ON THE
[000:04:02;809] RACEWAY.
[000:04:03;776] BACK BAY IS NORMALLY A BUSY
[000:04:04;444] AREA.
[000:04:07;013] THE STREETS ARE CLOSED RIGHT
[000:04:07;714] NOW.
[000:04:08;081] THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
[000:04:10;750] ROADBLOCKS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.
[000:04:11;651] THERE WAS A GROUND STOP AT LOGAN
[000:04:12;385] AIRPORT.
[000:04:13;453] WE HAD TO CIRCLE OVER PROVIDENCE
[000:04:14;187] FOR QUITE A WHILE BEFORE THEY
[000:04:15;221] ALLOWED US TO LAND.
[000:04:17;624] AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE, A VERY
[000:04:18;858] HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE HERE.
[000:04:20;860] THE NATIONAL GUARD IS HERE AND
[000:04:23;696] PEOPLE ARE ON ALERT.
[000:04:25;131] THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING
[000:04:27;533] ON.
[000:04:28;301] THE POLICE COMMISSIONER ASKED
[000:04:29;269] EVERYBODY TO STAY INSIDE,
[000:04:29;902] EVERYBODY TO GO HOME IF THEY
[000:04:30;603] CAN.
[000:04:31;938] FROM WHAT YOU CAN TELL ALTHOUGH
[000:04:32;805] THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT HERE, MOST
[000:04:36;042] OF THEM HAVE HEEDED THAT ORDER,
[000:04:38;578] AT LEAST AROUND HERE.
[000:04:39;145] BRIAN?
[000:04:39;812] >> WE CAN SEE LOOKING AT TAPE OF
[000:04:41;914] THE FINISH LINE THE DIGITAL
[000:04:43;783] SEEMS TO SAY THIS WAS THE 4:09,
[000:04:44;517] FOUR HOUR, NINE MINUTE FINISHING
[000:04:45;251] MARK.
[000:04:47;020] IF YOU ARE CROSSING THE FINISH
[000:04:47;754] LINE AT THAT POINT IN THIS RACE
[000:04:48;588] YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL.
[000:04:49;322] TO FINISH AT ALL YOU HAVE DONE
[000:04:51;758] VERY WELL.
[000:04:53;993] BUT PEOPLE THOUGHT, AND YOU
[000:04:54;994] CAN'T BLAME THEM, THAT THIS WAS
[000:04:57;263] SOME KIND OF CANNON, A PLANNED
[000:05:02;602] THING.
[000:05:03;102] I HAD ONE EYEWITNESS DESCRIBE IT
[000:05:06;072] IN TERMS OF WORLD TRADE.
[000:05:07;840] THAT ONCE THE SECOND BUILDING
[000:05:08;541] WAS HIT THAT DAY WE KNEW IT WAS
[000:05:10;076] SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
[000:05:14;781] WELL ONCE THE SECONDARY
[000:05:15;381] EXPLOSION WENT OFF, THEY KNEW IT
[000:05:17;483] WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT OF THE
[000:05:20;053] CONSTRUCTION OF THE CITY LIKE A
[000:05:22;155] GAS MAIN.
[000:05:24;457] >> Reporter: CERTAINLY WHEN
[000:05:25;458] YOU'RE AT A MARATHON, ESPECIALLY
[000:05:27;994] IN BOSTON WHERE THEY HAVEN'T HAD
[000:05:30;530] ISSUES LIKE THEY HAVE HAD IN NEW
[000:05:31;964] YORK, NOBODY WAS EXPECTING
[000:05:34;100] SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.
[000:05:35;234] INITIALLY NOBODY THOUGHT -- THEY
[000:05:35;968] WEREN'T SURE IF IT WAS EVEN AN
[000:05:36;703] ACCIDENT, A GAS MAIN BREAK.
[000:05:37;370] PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
[000:05:38;104] GOING ON.
[000:05:38;938] WHEN THE SECOND EXPLOSION
[000:05:42;241] HAPPENED 15 SECONDS LATER PEOPLE
[000:05:43;042] STARTED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS
[000:05:44;944] SOMETHING FISHY, SOMETHING BAD.
[000:05:47;347] THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO
[000:05:50;316] GET SCARED, RUN AWAY.
[000:05:50;883] A BIT OF A CHAOTIC SCENE OUT
[000:05:51;584] HERE.
[000:05:51;884] BRIAN?
[000:05:54;087] >> KATY TUR ON THE STREETS OF
[000:05:57;290] BOSTON TONIGHT.
[000:05:59;225] FOR A 15-BLOCK AREA PEOPLE
[000:06:00;593] AREN'T ALLOWED.
[000:06:01;127] WE DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WILL
[000:06:01;861] BE ALLOWED BACK IN.

[000:06:02;995] OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE
[000:06:04;263] WILLIAMS HAS BEEN WORKING THIS
[000:06:05;098] STORY ALL DAY.
[000:06:05;698] PETE, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
[000:06:06;833] TONIGHT?
[000:06:08;134] >> TONIGHT AUTHORITIES CONFIRM
[000:06:09;936] THAT THERE WERE TWO BOMBS.
[000:06:11;771] WE KNOW THAT MUCH.
[000:06:12;772] BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY OTHERS
[000:06:13;940] WERE PLANTED.
[000:06:15;408] THEY SAY THERE WERE OTHER
[000:06:17;076] SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.
[000:06:18;344] AND THE WORD, OF COURSE, OF
[000:06:20;313] ANOTHER BOMB ELSEWHERE PLACED AT
[000:06:21;881] THE JFK LIBRARY IS APPARENTLY
[000:06:24;183] TURNING OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.
[000:06:25;752] AT LEAST FIVE OTHER PACKAGES
[000:06:27;019] HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE STREET,
[000:06:28;121] HAVE BEEN DEEMED SUSPICIOUS AND
[000:06:28;855] ARE BEING DESTROYED.
[000:06:32;959] BUT THERE IS NO FIRM
[000:06:34;127] CONFIRMATION OF WHETHER THEY
[000:06:37;130] WERE ACTUALLY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
[000:06:37;864] ALTHOUGH SOME OFFICIALS TONIGHT
[000:06:38;598] SAY THERE IS REASON TO THINK
[000:06:39;298] THAT SOME OF THEM WERE.
[000:06:40;366] WE ARE TOLD, BY THE WAY, THAT
[000:06:44;537] ONE OF THE TWO VICTIMS KILLED IN
[000:06:45;271] THE EXPLOSION WAS 8 YEARS OLD.
[000:06:46;639] BOSTON POLICE SAY THERE WAS NO
[000:06:47;907] SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE WARNING OF
[000:06:50;176] ANY KIND OF ATTACK.
[000:06:51;911] FEDERAL OFFICIALS TONIGHT SAY
[000:06:53;045] THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT
[000:06:54;180] THIS IS PART OF ANY LARGER
[000:06:55;715] THREAT.
[000:06:57;583] AT THIS POINT THEY BELIEVE IT IS
[000:06:58;317] CONFINED TO BOSTON.
[000:06:59;018] BUT A MEETING TONIGHT WILL
[000:07:01;788] DECIDE WHETHER ANY KIND OF
[000:07:02;455] NATIONAL ALERT WILL BE SENT OUT.
[000:07:04;557] THERE IS NO SUSPECT IN CUSTODY,
[000:07:06;959] AUTHORITIES SAY.
[000:07:10;663] BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING
[000:07:12;799] QUESTIONED INCLUDING SOME WITH
[000:07:14;267] INJURIES WHO WERE TAKEN TO
[000:07:14;934] BOSTON HOSPITALS.
[000:07:15;501] ONE OF THOSE, A PERSON IN WHOM
[000:07:16;269] THERE IS SOME INTEREST IS A

[000:07:54;173] PEOPLE ARE RUNNING TO THE FIRST.
[000:07:55;741] AND NUMBER TWO, THE NATURE OF
[000:07:57;310] THESE INJURIES.
[000:07:58;044] AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE APPARENTLY
[000:07:59;312] WITH ADDED SHRAPNEL.
[000:08:00;179] THAT HAUNTS EVERYBODY
[000:08:01;714] INVOLVED.
[000:08:02;882] >> YES, BRIAN.
[000:08:04;150] THE IDEA OF USING TWO EXPLOSIVE
[000:08:05;451] DEVICES, THE FIRST CHARGE WHICH
[000:08:06;552] ATTRACTS TO SOME EXTENT THE
[000:08:07;687] FIRST RESPONDERS -- POLICE,
[000:08:09;822] FIRE, MEDICAL -- AND THEN HAVE A
[000:08:11;824] SECOND CHARGE GO OFF THAT'S
[000:08:15;094] TARGETING THOSE RESPONDERS
[000:08:16;095] POTENTIALLY IS THE SIGN OF A
[000:08:20;633] MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACK.
[000:08:21;501] AS YOU NOTED, THE SHRAPNEL, THE
[000:08:22;235] IDEA THERE COULD HAVE BEEN BALL
[000:08:25;238] BEARINGS OR SOMETHING ELSE IN

[000:08:30;376] TRYING TO HAVE A SMALL EXPLOSION
[000:08:32;378] AND GET SOME ATTRACTION.
[000:08:33;679] THE SIGN OF A TERRORIST
[000:08:35;147] ORGANIZATION THAT'S TRYING TO

[000:08:44;123] ISN'T.

[000:09:08;147] CORRECT?

[000:09:14;854] YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES
[000:09:15;588] MERELY AS PRECAUTIONS.
[000:09:17;990] THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL

[000:09:32;338] PUTTING MORE POLICE ON THE
[000:09:33;272] SCENE.
[000:09:34;907] THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW
[000:09:35;608] SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
[000:09:36;142] IT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS TO
[000:09:36;876] MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SHOW
[000:09:37;610] OF FORCE AND SHOULD SOMETHING
[000:09:38;311] ELSE ARISE THAT THEY ARE IN A
[000:09:39;011] GOOD POSITION TO RESPOND.
[000:09:39;645] BUT IT IS NOT THE SIGN OF A
[000:09:40;313] SPECIFIC THREAT NECESSARILY.
[000:09:41;013] >> MICHAEL LEITER IN OUR
[000:09:41;647] WASHINGTON BUREAU.
[000:09:42;148] MICHAEL, THANK YOU AS ALWAYS.
[000:09:43;516] >>> ACROSS TOWN WE GO TO THE
[000:09:44;550] WHITE HOUSE.
[000:09:45;384] CHUCK TODD WAS STANDING IN THE
[000:09:46;118] BRIEFING ROOM WHEN THE PRESIDENT
[000:09:46;986] ENTERED AT ABOUT 6:10 TONIGHT TO
[000:09:50;089] GIVE HIS REMARKS ON WHAT THE
[000:09:56;629] WHITE HOUSE WAS SAYING SO FAR.
[000:09:57;330] CHUCK?
[000:09:59;498] >> I CAN TELL YOU THIS.
[000:10:00;633] ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT
[000:10:02;335] DID NOT SAY IS HE DID NOT CALL
[000:10:03;069] THIS TERRORISM.
[000:10:04;303] I CAN TELL YOU FROM TALKING TO
[000:10:05;204] SOURCES THIS WAS DISCUSSED AND
[000:10:05;938] THE DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO
[000:10:06;639] HAVE THE PRESIDENT USE THAT
[000:10:07;306] SPECIFIC WORD.
[000:10:10;042] A NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL
[000:10:11;577] E-MAILS AND SAYS THIS.
[000:10:14;280] ANY EVENT WITH MULTIPLE
[000:10:15;715] EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AS THIS
[000:10:16;549] APPEARS TO BE IS CLEARLY AN ACT
[000:10:18;417] OF TERROR AND WILL BE APPROACHED
[000:10:19;518] AS AN ACT OF TERROR.
[000:10:21;153] HOWEVER WE DO NOT KNOW WHO
[000:10:22;955] CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK.
[000:10:23;823] A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WILL
[000:10:26;659] DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS PLANNED
[000:10:27;393] AND CARRIED OUT BY A TERRORIST
[000:10:29;362] GROUP, FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC.
[000:10:30;062] THEY ARE CAREFUL WITH THEIR
[000:10:32;365] LANGUAGE.
[000:10:35;701] WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
[000:10:38;404] BRIEFED ALL DAY FROM THE FBI
[000:10:39;939] DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY
[000:10:41;707] DIRECTOR, CHIEF TERRORISM
[000:10:43;542] ADVISER.
[000:10:44;744] HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN GIVING
[000:10:45;411] BRIEFINGS TO THE LEADERSHIP IN
[000:10:46;479] CONGRESS.
[000:10:47;980] BUT I CAN TELL YOU IN TALKING TO
[000:10:48;814] OFFICIALS AROUND HERE, BRIAN,
[000:10:49;982] THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF
[000:10:50;616] FRUSTRATION OF HOW LITTLE THEY
[000:10:51;350] DO KNOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME
[000:10:52;051] WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS
[000:10:52;852] CLEARLY BEING VERY CAREFUL WITH
[000:10:54;253] THE LANGUAGE HE CHOSE TO USE.
[000:10:55;087] >> CHUCK TODD AT THE WHITE
[000:10:55;788] HOUSE, THANKS.

[000:10:58;224] WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK

[000:11:03;829] HOW THAT JOB MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN

[000:11:23;382] the way it's meant to be seen.

[000:12:04;957] MORE AWKWARD CONVERSATIONS
[000:12:06;258] THAN I'M EQUIPPED FOR,

[000:12:08;994] ON MY OWN.
[000:12:10;396] I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE ECONOMY
[000:12:11;597] MORE THAN A FEW TIMES

[000:12:32;418] [ Male Announcer ]
[000:12:32;418] YOU'VE REACHED THE AGE
[000:12:34;286] WHERE YOU DON'T BACK DOWN
[000:12:34;286] FROM A CHALLENGE.
[000:12:36;806] THIS IS THE AGE OF KNOWING
[000:12:36;806] HOW TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.
[000:12:39;508] SO, WHY LET
[000:12:39;508] ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION
[000:12:42;061] GET IN YOUR WAY?
[000:12:43;329] TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR
[000:12:43;329] ABOUT VIAGRA.
[000:12:45;130] 20 MILLION MEN ALREADY HAVE.
[000:12:47;233] ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOUR HEART
[000:12:47;233] IS HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.
[000:12:49;635] DO NOT TAKE VIAGRA IF YOU TAKE
[000:12:49;635] NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN;
[000:12:52;188] IT MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE DROP
[000:12:52;188] IN BLOOD PRESSURE.
[000:12:54;206] SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
[000:12:54;206] HEADACHE, FLUSHING,
[000:12:55;975] UPSET STOMACH,
[000:12:55;975] AND ABNORMAL VISION.
[000:12:57;743] TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
[000:12:57;743] SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP
[000:12:59;945] FOR AN ERECTION
[000:12:59;945] LASTING MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.
[000:13:01;914] STOP TAKING VIAGRA
[000:13:01;914] AND CALL YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY
[000:13:04;033] IF YOU EXPERIENCE
[000:13:04;033] A SUDDEN DECREASE OR LOSS
[000:13:05;785] IN VISION OR HEARING.
[000:13:06;869] THIS IS THE AGE
[000:13:06;869] OF TAKING ACTION.
[000:13:09;505] VIAGRA.
[000:13:10;706] TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.
[000:13:19;732] >>> WE ARE BACK TONIGHT.
[000:13:20;699] THIS IS THE SCENE AS IT
[000:13:22;101] HAPPENED.
[000:13:22;735] 2:50 P.M. THIS AFTERNOON IN
[000:13:24;670] BOSTON DURING THE MARATHON.
[000:13:25;838] THERE IS THE EXPLOSION.
[000:13:26;806] ONE RUNNER HIT BY SHRAPNEL GOES
[000:13:29;909] DOWN.
[000:13:30;209] THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE.
[000:13:31;911] BETWEEN THE POINT OF THE
[000:13:32;812] EXPLOSION AND THE CROWD POLICE,
[000:13:36;348] BOSTON EMS, RACE VOLUNTEERS WERE
[000:13:38;918] CAUGHT UP IN IT.
[000:13:39;885] THEY WERE AMONG THE TARGETS.
[000:13:41;487] SO HAVING SEEN THIS, HAVING
[000:13:42;922] WITNESSED THIS, THE QUESTION
[000:13:45;291] BECOMES HOW CAN WE EVER KEEP OUR
[000:13:48;861] PUBLIC EVENTS SAFE IF SOMEONE
[000:13:50;029] WAS ALLOWED TO GET TWO DEVICES
[000:13:52;431] THIS CLOSE TO THIS CLASSIC A DAY
[000:13:55;401] IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS?
[000:13:57;269] NBC'S TOM COSTELLO HAS BEEN
[000:13:58;838] LOOKING AT THIS CONUNDRUM FOR
[000:14:00;739] SECURITY PERSONNEL ALL DAY.
[000:14:02;107] TOM, EVENING.
[000:14:02;675] >> Reporter: HI, BRIAN.
[000:14:03;676] WE TALK ABOUT HOW SECURITY
[000:14:04;877] CHANGED AFTER 9/11.
[000:14:05;511] AND IT DID.
[000:14:06;679] BUT SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE BEEN
[000:14:09;949] DEALING WITH TERRORIST THREATS
[000:14:10;683] AT BIG GATHERINGS SINCE THE
[000:14:12;484] MUNICH GAMES IN 1972.
[000:14:14;486] TRYING TO ENSURE EVERYONE'S
[000:14:16;655] SAFETY IS A HERCULEAN CHALLENGE.
[000:14:21;727] FOR ANY POLICE AGENCY PLANNING
[000:14:24;396] FOR BIG CROWDS MEANS MONTHS OF
[000:14:26;866] NIGHTMARES.
[000:14:27;399] SECURES AND STEALING A COURSE
[000:14:29;401] LIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON WITH
[000:14:30;669] 20,000 RUNNERS AND HALF A
[000:14:32;471] MILLION SPECTATORS IS ALMOST AN
[000:14:35;174] IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE.
[000:14:35;741] BILL BRATTON WAS THE BOSTON
[000:14:37;543] POLICE COMMISSIONER BEFORE
[000:14:38;644] LEADING THE NYPD AND THE LAPD.
[000:14:42;081] >> IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY
[000:14:43;616] DIFFICULT, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE,
[000:14:45;184] THAT 26-MILE ROUTE.
[000:14:46;719] DOUBLE IT, 52 THE MILES BECAUSE
[000:14:48;554] YOU HAVE TWO SIDES OF THE
[000:14:50;322] STREET.
[000:14:50;656] MOST OF THE SECURITY WOULD BE
[000:14:52;324] FOCUSED ON THE FINISH LINE AREA
[000:14:53;826] WHERE THE ACTUAL BOMBING
[000:14:56;362] OCCURRED.
[000:14:56;729] >> Reporter: ATLANTA, 1996.
[000:14:58;230] A BACKPACK HOLDING PIPE BOMBS
[000:15:00;299] PACKED WITH NAILS EXPLODED IN
[000:15:02;434] OLYMPIC PARK.
[000:15:02;968] TWO DIED.
[000:15:04;003] MORE THAN A HUNDRED WOUNDED.
[000:15:05;537] IT WASN'T UNTIL 2003 THAT POLICE
[000:15:07;907] TRACKED DOWN DOMESTIC TERRORIST
[000:15:09;842] ERIC ROBERT RUDOLPH.
[000:15:11;343] >> GET BACK, PLEASE!
[000:15:13;379] >> Reporter: LONDON, 2005.
[000:15:14;079] A SERIES OF COORDINATED SUICIDE
[000:15:16;482] ATTACKS ON THE SUBWAY AND BUS
[000:15:18;784] SYSTEM LEFT 52 PEOPLE DEAD, 700
[000:15:20;886] INJURED.
[000:15:21;287] THE ATTACKERS USED HOME MADE
[000:15:24;423] EXPLOSIVES PACKED INTO
[000:15:26;158] BACKPACKS.
[000:15:26;525] THOSE ATTACKS ON FINDS OF THE
[000:15:28;193] SECRET SERVICE WHEN PRESIDENT
[000:15:29;328] OBAMA WAS SWORN IN FOR THE FIRST
[000:15:31;330] TIME IN 2009.
[000:15:34;266] DAN BONNGENO WAS THE LEAD SECRET
[000:15:37;803] SERVICE AGENT AS PEOPLE PACKED
[000:15:39;538] THE NATIONAL MALL IN DOWNTOWN
[000:15:41;307] D.C.
[000:15:43;242] A POTENTIAL TERRORIST COULD HAVE
[000:15:43;976] BEEN HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT.
[000:15:45;945] >> YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING.
[000:15:48;948] YOU REDUCE THE PROBABILITY TO
[000:15:50;349] HOPEFULLY SOMETHING MINUSCULE SO
[000:15:51;583] IF SOMETHING HAPPENS YOUR
[000:15:52;618] RESPONSE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP
[000:15:54;053] CASUALTIES TO A MINIMUM N TIMES
[000:15:56;322] SQUARE 2010.
[000:15:57;156] A CAR BOMB FAILED TO EXPLODE AND
[000:15:59;325] WAS DISARMED BEFORE IT COULD
[000:16:01;493] HURT ANYONE.
[000:16:02;127] TWO DAYS LATER A
[000:16:04;863] PAKISTANI-AMERICAN WAS CAUGHT
[000:16:05;564] TRYING TO BOARD A FLIGHT TO THE
[000:16:06;699] MIDDLE EAST.
[000:16:07;099] BIG SPORTING EVENTS LIKE THE
[000:16:09;401] BOSTON MARATHON HAD BEEN VIEWED
[000:16:11;603] AS INVITING TARGETS SINCE 9/11.
[000:16:13;372] THE MARINE CORPS MARATHON
[000:16:15;407] ATTRACTS 30,000 RUNNERS EACH
[000:16:17;209] YEAR.
[000:16:17;509] SUPER BOWL ORGANIZE OHHERS ARE
[000:16:18;510] OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR TOO MUCH
[000:16:20;045] SECURITY AT THE BIG GAME.
[000:16:21;747] AND SECURING EVERY POSSIBLE
[000:16:23;649] PUBLIC EVENT THAT COULD INVITE
[000:16:25;050] AN ATTACK IS RESPOND REASONABLE.
[000:16:27;319] MICHAELLE LEITER WAS THE COUNTER
[000:16:29;722] TERRORISM DIRECTOR UNDER
[000:16:31;323] PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH.
[000:16:32;491] >> YOU CAN'T PROTECT ALL OF THE
[000:16:34;860] PEOPLE AT ALL OF THE LARGE
[000:16:36;028] SPORTING EVENTS OR ANY PUBLIC
[000:16:38;964] GATHERING.
[000:16:39;498] THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE TERRORISTS
[000:16:41;233] HAVE.
[000:16:41;533] THEY CAN LOOK FOR THE SOFTEST,
[000:16:43;268] LEAST DEFENDED AREA.
[000:16:46;372] >> IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE
[000:16:48;374] TRASH BINS REMOVED, MAILBOXES
[000:16:50;909] REMOVED, EVEN THE MANHOLE COVERS
[000:16:53;278] SCREWED DOWN.
[000:16:53;979] THAT'S THE KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY
[000:16:56;048] SECURITY YOU GET IN A
[000:16:57;349] PRESIDENTIAL ZONE.
[000:16:58;017] PUTTING IN PLACE THAT KIND OF
[000:16:59;351] SECURITY AT AN OUTDOOR MARATHON,
[000:17:01;620] BRIAN, WOULD BE A DIFFERENT
[000:17:03;022] MATTER.
[000:17:03;789] >> AGAIN, HOW IRONIC THIS
[000:17:06;291] HAPPENED AT WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE
[000:17:07;726] MOST SECURE ZONE IN ALL OF
