[000:00:01;184] CALLED FOR HOME THE LAST SIX
[000:00:04;421] YEARS."
[000:00:04;754] ABC SAYS THE MOVE WAS PURELY
[000:00:06;489] BUSINESS DECISION BY THE NETWORK
[000:00:08;725] TO STOP SCHEDULING COMEDIES ON
[000:00:11;928] FRIDAY NIGHT.
[000:00:12;696] I'M MELISSA FRANCIS.
[000:00:15;198] HERE'S SHEP.
[000:00:15;999] >> Shepard: IT'S NOON ON THECOA.
[000:00:18;301] 3:00 AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
[000:00:20;737] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS FACING THE
[000:00:23;073] MORE SERIOUS ALLEGATION SINCE HE
[000:00:25;375] TOOK OFFICE.
[000:00:26;309] TURNING OVER CLASSIFIED SECRETS
[000:00:29;345] SINCE BECOMING PRESIDENT.
[000:00:30;480] HE SAYS HE DID NOTHING WRONG.
[000:00:32;649] SOME REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS
[000:00:34;050] DEMAND ANSWERS.
[000:00:35;752] NEW CLUES IN THE WORLDWIDE HACK
[000:00:37;320] ATTACK POINTING TO NORTH KOREA.
[000:00:39;089] COULD THE ROGUE NATION HAVE THE
[000:00:40;690] POWER TO CRIPPLE COMPUTERS
[000:00:42;625] AROUND THE GLOBE?
[000:00:44;694] AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
[000:00:48;164] HELD HOSTAGE.
[000:00:49;299] CYBER CRIMINALS SAY THEY STOLE A
[000:00:51;167] COPY OF THE BLOCKBUSTER BEFORE
[000:00:52;535] ITS RELEASE AND DEMANDING DISNEY
[000:00:54;604] PAY UP OR ELSE.
[000:00:55;638] LET'S GET TO IT.
[000:01:02;145] FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK,
[000:01:03;747] THE WHITE HOUSE IS REFUSING TO
[000:01:07;450] CONFIRM WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:01:11;187] SHARED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
[000:01:12;422] WITH THE RUSSIANS.
[000:01:14;557] THE ADMINISTRATION IS FOCUSING
[000:01:16;726] ON LEAKS RATHER THAN THE
[000:01:18;695] SUBSTANCE.
[000:01:19;062] THIS TIME, THE PRESIDENT IS
[000:01:21;064] ACCUSED OF THE ORIGINAL LEAK.
[000:01:22;932] TAKING INTELLIGENCE, SHARING IT
[000:01:24;167] WITH AN ADVERSARY IN THE OVAL
[000:01:26;770] OFFICE WHILE ONLY THAT COUNTRY'S
[000:01:28;872] MEDIA WERE IN THE ROOM.
[000:01:30;173] NO AMERICANS.
[000:01:31;074] AS CONGRESS AND THE FBI ARE
[000:01:33;710] INVESTIGATING RUSSIAN
[000:01:35;044] INTERFERENCE IN OUR ELECTION AND
[000:01:36;913] POSSIBLE TEAM TRUMP COLLUSION
[000:01:38;047] WITH THE RUSSIANS.
[000:01:41;117] SO FAR NO REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER
[000:01:42;685] HAS COME TO HIS DEFENSE.
[000:01:44;320] SOME ARE SILENT.
[000:01:45;789] SOME ARE EXPRESSING CONCERN.
[000:01:50;493] PAUL RYAN THROUGH A SPOKESMAN IS
[000:01:52;428] ASKING FOR A FULL EXPLANATION.
[000:01:56;065] SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE
[000:01:58;067] SAYS SHE HAS NOT BEEN INFORMED
[000:01:59;869] AND THAT "IT'S VERY SERIOUS" AND
[000:02:01;971] SHE WANTS TO "FIND OUT WHAT THE
[000:02:04;240] FACTS ARE."
[000:02:06;676] REPRESENTATIVE BARBARA COMSTOCK
[000:02:08;812] REPUBLICAN OF VERY ISSUED A
[000:02:10;346] STATEMENT SAYING "ONCE AGAIN
[000:02:12;382] WE'RE FACED WITH STORIES COMING
[000:02:14;184] FROM THE WHITE HOUSE THAT ARE
[000:02:16;352] HIGHLY TROUBLING.
[000:02:17;887] WE NEED IMMEDIATE CLASSIFIED
[000:02:21;024] BRIEFINGS SO THAT CONGRESS CAN
[000:02:22;625] KNOW AS MUCH AS RUSSIAN
[000:02:25;061] LEADERS".
[000:02:25;428] MOST STRIKING OF ALL, BOB CORKER
[000:02:27;330] FROM TENNESSEE SAYS THE WHITE
[000:02:29;265] HOUSE IS IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL
[000:02:31;167] AND THAT IT "HAS GOT TO DO
[000:02:33;870] SOMETHING SOON TO BRING ITSELF
[000:02:35;705] UNDER CONTROL AND IN ORDER."
[000:02:37;574] THEN THERE'S THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:02:40;076] CABINET.
[000:02:40;410] SEVERAL HOURS AGO, H.R. McMASTER
[000:02:43;046] SAID THE INFORMATION PRESIDENT
[000:02:44;647] TRUMP SHARED WITH THE RUSSIANS
[000:02:46;749] WAS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.
[000:02:51;054] HE WOULDN'T SAY IF THE
[000:02:52;388] INFORMATION WAS CLASSIFIED.
[000:02:53;523] >> WE DON'T SAY WHAT IS
[000:02:54;991] CLASSIFIED AND WHAT IS NOT
[000:02:56;392] CLASSIFIED.
[000:02:56;793] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HE SHARED
[000:02:58;161] IS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.
[000:02:59;429] THE STORY COMBINED WHAT WAS
[000:03:02;932] LEAKED WITH OTHER INFORMATION
[000:03:04;934] AND THEN INSINUATED ABOUT
[000:03:07;470] SOURCES AND METHODS.
[000:03:08;471] I WANTED TO MAKE CLEAR TO
[000:03:10;106] EVERYBODY THAT THE PRESIDENT IN
[000:03:12;542] NO WAY COMPROMISED ANY SOURCES
[000:03:14;444] OR METHODS IN THE COURSE OF THIS
[000:03:19;749] CONVERSATION.
[000:03:20;183] >> Shepard: "WHOLLY APPROPRIATE"
[000:03:22;252] USED NINE TIMES.
[000:03:23;253] THIS COMES FROM BUZZ FEED AND
[000:03:25;288] "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND OTHERS,
[000:03:28;191] REPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:03:33;630] REVEALED HIGHLY CLASSIFIED
[000:03:35;031] MATERIAL.
[000:03:35;665] ACCORDING TO THE REPORTS, THE
[000:03:38;635] PRESIDENT REVEALED SENSITIVE
[000:03:41;271] DETAILS THAT MAY HAVE QUOTED
[000:03:42;572] INFORMATION ABOUT THE ISLAMIC
[000:03:43;940] STATES.
[000:03:44;274] OUR COUSINS AT THE "WALL STREET
[000:03:47;810] JOURNAL" ARE REPORTING THAT
[000:03:50;079] INTELLIGENCE SOURCE WAS ISRAEL,
[000:03:51;681] AND THAT ISRAEL WAS NOT INFORMED
[000:03:53;650] THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE
[000:03:55;151] SHARING THAT INFORMATION WITH
[000:03:56;052] ANYONE MUCH LESS THE RUSSIANS.
[000:04:00;857] AS FOR THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING
[000:04:01;891] WITH THE RUSSIANS, "THE
[000:04:03;993] WASHINGTON POST" AND OTHERS
[000:04:05;295] REPORT "HE WENT OFF SCRIPT" AND
[000:04:07;630] GAVE DETAILS OF AN ISIS THREAT
[000:04:10;533] INVOLVING LAPTOP COMPUTERS ON
[000:04:12;035] AIR LANES.
[000:04:13;503] THE "WASHINGTON POST" TOLD THE
[000:04:15;638] RUSSIANS, I GET GREAT
[000:04:16;873] INTELLIGENCE.
[000:04:17;307] I HAVE PEOPLE BRIEF ME ON GREAT
[000:04:19;709] INTEL EVERY DAY.
[000:04:21;110] THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS MORNING
[000:04:23;212] LASHED OUT ON TWITTER POSTING AS
[000:04:26;449] PRESIDENT, I WANTED TO SHARE
[000:04:28;117] WITH RUSSIAN AT AN OPENLY
[000:04:29;852] SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE MEETING
[000:04:31;154] WHICH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT
[000:04:32;488] TO DO FACTS PERTAINING TO
[000:04:34;490] TERRORISM AND AIRLINE FLIGHT
[000:04:36;459] SAFETY.
[000:04:37;527] HUMANITARIAN REASONS.
[000:04:39;662] PLUS, I WANT RUSSIA TO STEP UP
[000:04:42;332] THEIR FIGHT AGAINST ISIS AND
[000:04:44;901] TERRORISM.
[000:04:45;268] I'VE BEEN ASKING DIRECTOR COMEY
[000:04:47;070] TO FIND MY LEAKERS IN THE
[000:04:48;771] INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
[000:04:49;839] OF COURSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
[000:04:51;274] MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS CAME
[000:04:52;608] JUST HOURS AFTER HE FIRED THE
[000:04:54;610] FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
[000:04:56;612] THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW ADMITTED
[000:04:58;648] THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION WAS AT
[000:05:00;483] LEAST ON HIS MIND WHEN HE MADE
[000:05:01;851] THE DECISION TO FIRE HIM.
[000:05:04;120] PRESIDENT TRUMP WARNED FORMER
[000:05:06;622] DIRECTOR COMEY NOT TO LEAK THEIR
[000:05:09;225] CONVERSATIONS AND SUGGESTED
[000:05:10;693] THERE MIGHT BE TAPES THEREOF.
[000:05:14;597] NOW THE PRESIDENT IS FIGHTING
[000:05:18;034] ACCUSATIONS THAT HE LEAKED SENSE
[000:05:20;036] TY INFORMATION.
[000:05:20;903] CANDIDATE TRUMP BASHED HILLARY
[000:05:22;572] CLINTON FOR LEAKING CLASSIFIED
[000:05:23;740] INFORMATION.
[000:05:24;140] IN THE MONTH OF JULY, HE
[000:05:26;476] TWEETED, "CROOKED HILLARY
[000:05:29;178] CLINTON AND HER TEAM WERE
[000:05:31;614] CARELESS IN SENSITIVE HIGHLY
[000:05:34;350] CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[000:05:35;051] NOT FIT."
[000:05:35;551] LATER THAT MONTH, CANDIDATE
[000:05:38;054] TRUMP TREATED "HILLARY CLINTON
[000:05:41;157] SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN SENSITIVE
[000:05:43;993] BRIEFINGS BECAUSE SHE'S A LOOSE
[000:05:46;095] CANNON AND BAD INSTINCTS."
[000:05:48;064] NOW THE SITTING PRESIDENT IS
[000:05:49;866] ACCUSED OF ACTIONS THAT ARE MORE
[000:05:52;568] DANGEROUS.
[000:05:53;036] ANDREW NAPOLITANO SAYS THESE ARE
[000:05:54;003] THE MOST SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS
[000:05:56;172] LEVELS AGAINST A SITTING
[000:05:57;106] PRESIDENT IN THE MODERN ERA.
[000:05:58;574] WE'LL HEAR FROM HIM SHORTLY.
[000:06:02;245] FIRST, JOHN ROBERTS LIVE FROM
[000:06:03;012] THE NORTH LAWN.
[000:06:04;414] JOHN?
[000:06:04;714] >> GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU.
[000:06:06;215] I'M BEING TOLD WHILE SINCE OF
[000:06:08;451] THIS INFORMATION MAY HAVE BEEN
[000:06:09;585] DEVELOPED BY ISRAEL, IT WASN'T
[000:06:11;487] IN THE FORM OF A SPECIFIC
[000:06:13;689] DOCUMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:14;557] PULLED OUT AND PRESENTED TO THE
[000:06:17;093] RUSSIANS AND SAID THIS IS WHAT
[000:06:18;428] WE'RE LEARNING.
[000:06:18;995] MORE IT WAS THERE WAS
[000:06:19;796] INFORMATION THAT WAS DEVELOPED
[000:06:20;730] IN ONE REGION AND THE PRESIDENT
[000:06:23;733] HAD A CONVERSATION IN GENERAL
[000:06:25;168] ABOUT THE THREATS THAT SOME OF
[000:06:26;536] THAT INFORMATION DESCRIBED AND
[000:06:27;770] THAT IT'S WRONG TO COMPLETELY
[000:06:29;372] CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN THE TWO
[000:06:32;008] THINGS.
[000:06:32;341] WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS TALKING
[000:06:33;376] TO THE RUSSIANS ABOUT IS THREATS
[000:06:35;578] TO AVIATION.
[000:06:36;345] THAT GOES BEYOND JUST THE LAPTOP
[000:06:38;414] BAN.
[000:06:38;714] A SECURITY OFFICIAL TOLD ME A
[000:06:39;816] SHORT TIME AGO THAT EVERY DAY WE
[000:06:42;852] HEAR NO END OF DIFFERENT WAYS
[000:06:44;620] AND CREATIVE WAYS THAT PEOPLE
[000:06:46;456] WANT TO BLOW UP AIRPLANES
[000:06:47;990] BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT AL-QUAIDA
[000:06:49;492] AND ISIS ARE STILL CONSUMED WITH
[000:06:51;894] THE IDEA OF BRINGING DOWN
[000:06:54;597] AIRLINERS.
[000:06:54;964] DON'T FORGET THAT RUSSIAN HAD
[000:06:56;099] THAT ATTACK ON OCTOBER 21, 2015
[000:06:58;534] IN WHICH 224 PEOPLE DIED WHEN
[000:07:01;137] ISIS BROUGHT DOWN A RUSSIAN
[000:07:02;371] AIRLINER THAT WAS TAKING OFF IN
[000:07:04;474] THE SINAI PART OF EGYPT.
[000:07:06;409] SO THE PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS
[000:07:09;078] METING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
[000:07:10;513] TURKEY SAID THAT HE BELIEVED
[000:07:12;515] THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO SHARE
[000:07:14;550] INFORMATION ANT A COMMON THREAT
[000:07:15;952] WITH A COUNTRY THAT HE WANTS TO
[000:07:17;987] BRING ON AS AN ALLY IN THE FIGHT
[000:07:19;789] OF ISIS.
[000:07:21;991] HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID.
[000:07:24;894] >> WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL
[000:07:28;598] MEETING WITH TRUSSIA.
[000:07:35;171] GENERAL McMASTERS SAID AND I
[000:07:37;573] KNOW HE FEELS WE HAD A GREAT
[000:07:39;375] MEETING WITH THE FOREIGN
[000:07:40;543] MINISTER.
[000:07:40;910] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREAT
[000:07:42;578] SUCCESS THE NEXT COMING YEARS
[000:07:43;813] AND WE WANT TO GET AS MANY TO
[000:07:45;815] HELP FIGHT TERRORISM AS
[000:07:47;850] POSSIBLE.
[000:07:48;217] >> WE'RE ALSO TOLD IN AN OFF
[000:07:50;853] CAMERA BRIEFING BY SEAN SPICER
[000:07:53;256] THAT THE PRESIDENT IS VERY UPSET
[000:07:55;758] ABOUT THIS LATEST LEAK,
[000:07:57;260] PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER
[000:07:58;027] IT'S THE LATEST IN A LONG LINE
[000:08:00;229] OF LEAKS.
[000:08:01;297] HERE'S SOME AUDIO WITHOUT
[000:08:03;232] PICTURES BECAUSE THIS IS AN OFF
[000:08:06;836] CAMERA BRIEFING WITH SEAN
[000:08:08;971] SPICER.
[000:08:09;305] >> WHAT HAS OCCURRED TODAY OR
[000:08:11;274] THE LAST LITTLE WHILE IN TERMS
[000:08:12;875] OF THESE LEAKS IS FRANKLY
[000:08:14;644] DANGEROUS.
[000:08:15;011] THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS
[000:08:18;014] BEEN GIVEN ACCESS TO INFORMATION
[000:08:20;349] IS PUSHING THAT INFORMATION OUT
[000:08:22;251] INTO THE MEDIA, UNDERMINES OUR
[000:08:24;554] NATIONAL SECURITY AND I DON'T
[000:08:25;454] THINK THERE'S ANY OTHER WAY TO
[000:08:28;858] SAY IT THAT IT IS FRANKLY
[000:08:31;427] DANGEROUS.
[000:08:31;794] >> WE HEARD THE SAME THING FROM
[000:08:33;496] GENERAL H.R. McMASTER WHEN HE
[000:08:36;098] SAID THAT WHAT REALLY IS A
[000:08:38;334] THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:08:39;936] ISN'T WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHARED
[000:08:41;704] WITH RUSSIANS BUT IT'S IN THE
[000:08:43;539] PUBLIC DOMAIN.
[000:08:44;440] SO I PRESSED THE NATIONAL PUBLIC
[000:08:46;442] SECURITY ADVISER SAID WHAT THE
[000:08:48;544] NSD IS DOING TO CURB SUCH
[000:08:51;147] THINGS.
[000:08:51;480] >> WHAT STEPS ARE YOU TAKING BY
[000:08:53;316] VIRTUAL OF DISCOVERING THIS AS
[000:08:55;718] YOU DID TO TRY TO LIMIT THE
[000:08:58;554] POTENTIAL FOR ANY MORE LEAKS OF
[000:08:59;956] NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION?
[000:09:00;990] >> I THINK NATIONAL SECURITY IS
[000:09:04;093] AT RISK BY THIS LEAK AND LEAKS
[000:09:05;795] LIKE THIS.
[000:09:06;295] THERE'S A NUMBER OF INSTANCES
[000:09:08;698] WHERE THIS HAS OCCURRED AND I
[000:09:10;199] THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
[000:09:11;367] INVESTIGATE THESE SORT OF THINGS
[000:09:13;002] AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE
[000:09:14;737] TRUSTED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS OUR
[000:09:17;840] GOVERNMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE
[000:09:19;575] FREE SHARING OF INFORMATION AND
[000:09:22;278] COLLABORATION.
[000:09:22;712] >> OF COURSE, THE NATIONAL
[000:09:26;816] SECURITY APPARATUS BELIEVES
[000:09:28;184] THESE LEAKS ARE BAD.
[000:09:29;952] OTHERS SAY THEY LIKE THE
[000:09:31;120] INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE
[000:09:31;854] PRESIDENT IS DOING IS GETTING
[000:09:33;356] OUT THERE.
[000:09:33;723] I SPOKE WITH ERIC ERICSON, A FOX
[000:09:38;394] NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
[000:09:39;528] HE SAYS HE KNOWS ONE OF THE
[000:09:41;297] PEOPLE THAT LEAKED THIS
[000:09:42;932] INFORMATION, HAS TALKED TO THAT
[000:09:44;000] PERSON ABOUT IT.
[000:09:45;434] THE REASON IS, THIS PERSON IS A
[000:09:47;336] TRUMP SUPPORTER, DOESN'T LIKE
[000:09:49;105] THE WAY THE PRESIDENT ISN'T
[000:09:50;673] LISTENING TO HIS AIDES.
[000:09:52;308] AND THOUGHT BY GETTING THIS
[000:09:53;476] INFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC
[000:09:55;845] DOMAIN, THE BLOW BACK MAY
[000:09:57;480] INFLUENCE THE PRESIDENT TO
[000:09:58;281] CHANGE HIS WAYS.
[000:09:59;749] SHEP?
[000:10:00;049] >> Shepard: ANYTHING FROM THE
[000:10:01;550] ISRAELIS?
[000:10:01;917] >> THIS FALLS INTO A NARRATIVE
[000:10:04;220] THAT WAS CREATED IN THE INITIAL
[000:10:06;055] STORY BY GIVING THIS INFORMATION
[000:10:07;189] TO THE RUSSIANS DEVELOPED BY A
[000:10:08;624] THIRD PARTNER, THE PRESIDENT MAY
[000:10:10;526] BE JEOPARDIZING THE INFORMATION
[000:10:12;295] SHARING PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE
[000:10:13;996] HAVE AROUND THE WORLD.
[000:10:14;997] BUT LISTENING TO THE ISRAELI
[000:10:17;900] AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES,
[000:10:18;934] THE RELATIONSHIP WHEN IT COMES
[000:10:20;736] TO INTELLIGENCE SHARING BETWEEN
[000:10:22;438] THE U.S. AND ISRAEL IS ON A FIRM
[000:10:33;516] FOOTING.
[000:10:33;849] THIS IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD.
[000:10:36;052] SO ANY IDEA THAT THIS HAS
[000:10:38;721] DAMAGED ISRAELI-U.S. RELATIONS
[000:10:42;124] IN TERMS OF INTELLIGENCE
[000:10:43;259] SHARING, SHEP, APPEARS TO BE
[000:10:44;894] KNOCKED DOWN BY THIS PARTICULAR
[000:10:46;162] STATEMENT.
[000:10:46;529] BUT THERE'S OTHER ISSUES THAT WE
[000:10:48;164] DON'T HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT
[000:10:49;699] THAT DO HAVE ISRAEL WORKED UP IN
[000:10:51;434] TERMS OF WHAT THE U.S. IS
[000:10:54;170] SAYING.
[000:10:54;503] >> Shepard: INDEED.
[000:10:55;604] THANKS, JOHN ROBERTS.

[000:16:02;978] THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WAS

[000:16:22;164] QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THIS

[000:16:23;799] IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE IS.
[000:16:25;501] >> I THINK THE ISSUE REALLY
[000:16:27;603] IS -- TRUMP CAN DECIDE TO

[000:16:32;574] SO WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS
[000:16:33;742] CLASSIFIED MIGHT NOT BE THE
[000:16:35;377] PROBLEM.
[000:16:35;711] THE PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT

[000:18:14;243] RE-ELECTED.
[000:18:14;643] WHEN STAYING WITH THE CURRENT
[000:18:16;044] CAUSES YOU PROBLEMS IN THE
[000:18:17;813] FUTURE, YOU ABANDON THE CURRENT
[000:18:19;481] THE HISTORY BOOKS TELL US.
[000:18:21;216] >> ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES
[000:18:23;152] THAT WE'RE TALKING TO EVERY DAY
[000:18:24;486] ARE LOOKING AT 2018.
[000:18:26;488] DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT BE ON THE

[000:24:10;265] AND THE THREAT TO NATIONAL
[000:24:11;633] SECURITY.
[000:24:12;000] THE WHITE HOUSE CALLING THE
[000:24:13;335] INFORMATION THE PRESIDENT SHARED
[000:24:14;536] WHOLLY A ROPE WHY IT AND
[000:24:16;404] REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER IT WAS
[000:24:18;807] CLASSIFIED.
[000:24:19;207] JUDGE NAPOLITANO IS HERE.
[000:24:21;676] IF YOU COULD ENCAPSULATE AS YOU
[000:24:23;345] DID FOR ME WHAT THE ACCUSATION
[000:24:24;980] HERE AND EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE
[000:24:27;449] THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT.
[000:24:28;350] >> THE PRESIDENT CAN DECLASSIFY
[000:24:30;552] ANYTHING.
[000:24:30;919] HE CAN WHISPER IT INTO YOUR EAR,
[000:24:33;822] IN WHICH CASE IT'S DECLASSIFIED
[000:24:35;957] JUST FOR YOU OR REMOVE IT FROM
[000:24:37;459] THE CATEGORY OF CLASSIFICATION,
[000:24:39;528] IN WHICH CASE IT BECOMES PUBLIC.
[000:24:41;930] IN THIS CASE HE DIDN'T WHISPER
[000:24:45;367] IT IN THEIR EAR BUT SAID IT TO
[000:24:47;369] THOSE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
[000:24:49;137] AMONG THEM WITH THE FOREIGN
[000:24:52;040] MINISTER TO RUSSIA AND THE
[000:24:55;710] AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA.
[000:24:57;512] SO ONE WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IS,
[000:25:00;348] BY NAMING THE CITY FROM WHICH
[000:25:03;485] THE INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION IN
[000:25:04;786] SYRIA CAME, THE PRESIDENT OF THE
[000:25:07;189] UNITED STATES TOLD OUR
[000:25:08;890] ADVERSARY, RUSSIA, WHERE OUR
[000:25:10;992] ALLIES, THE ISRAELIS HAVE THEIR
[000:25:13;128] SPIES LOCATED IN SYRIA.
[000:25:15;297] THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
[000:25:17;065] BECAUSE IN SYRIA THE RUSSIAN
[000:25:18;700] INTEREST IS ADVERSE TO THE
[000:25:21;469] AMERICAN INTEREST AND THE
[000:25:22;137] ISRAELIS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE
[000:25:25;140] AMERICANS.
[000:25:25;507] >> Shepard: SO WHAT YOU'RE
[000:25:26;841] SAYING THE PRESIDENT TOLD THE
[000:25:28;009] RUSSIAN SPY IN THE OVAL OFFICE,
[000:25:30;478] WE GOT INFORMATION FROM ISRAEL
[000:25:32;547] INSIDE SYRIA AND HERE'S WHERE
[000:25:34;783] THE SPIES ARE INSIDE IN SYRIA.
[000:25:37;152] >> HE APPARENTLY DID THAT
[000:25:38;486] WITHOUT USING THE NAME ISRAEL OR
[000:25:41;590] THE WORD "ISRAELI" BUT THESE
[000:25:44;960] GUYS KNEW OR COULD EASILY
[000:25:47;996] CALCULATE WHAT FOREIGN POWER HAD
[000:25:49;464] ENOUGH RESOURCES LOCATED IN
[000:25:51;800] SYRIA TO PRODUCE THE KIND OF
[000:25:53;702] INFORMATION THAT THE PRESIDENT
[000:25:55;770] WAS TALKING ABOUT.
[000:25:57;339] AGAIN, HE DIDN'T BREAK ANY LAW.
[000:25:59;941] OBVIOUSLY THE ALLEGATION THAT AN
[000:26:02;577] AMERICAN PRESIDENT GAVE TOP
[000:26:05;213] SECRET INFORMATION TO AN
[000:26:07;349] ADVERSARY IS GRAVE AND NEVER
[000:26:09;050] BEEN CHARGED BEFORE IN THE
[000:26:12;020] MODERN ERA.
[000:26:15;624] THE QUESTION IS HOW HARMFUL IS
[000:26:18;326] THIS AND WHAT THE CONCERN ABOUT
[000:26:19;494] IT IN THE FEATURE.
[000:26:20;595] >> Shepard: LEGALLY SPEAKING FOR
[000:26:22;097] THE PRESIDENT.
[000:26:22;564] >> ABSOLUTELY SAFE.
[000:26:23;632] THE STATUTE IS VERY CLEAR.
[000:26:25;800] THE PRESIDENT CAN CLASSIFY
[000:26:26;968] ANYTHING AND HE CAN DECLASSIFY
[000:26:31;139] ANYTHING.
[000:26:31;573] WHEN HE SAID I HAD THE RIGHT TO
[000:26:33;141] DO IT, HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
[000:26:35;210] >> Shepard: THE BIGGER PICTURE
[000:26:36;311] QUESTION IS FOR SOMEONE WITH A
[000:26:37;946] DIFFERENT EXPERTISE THAN MINE OR
[000:26:39;514] YOURS AND THIS WOULD BE HOW THAT
[000:26:41;683] WOULD AFFECT OTHERS.
[000:26:43;184] FOR INSTANCE, JORDAN, WHO IS
[000:26:45;687] ALWAYS KNOWN TO BE A VERY GOOD
[000:26:48;089] SOURCE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR NEWS
[000:26:49;291] THE WAR ON TERROR.
[000:26:50;458] WOULD SOME OF OUR ALLIES LIKE
[000:26:53;228] JORDAN BE CONCERNED ABOUT
[000:26:54;229] SHARING INFORMATION WITH US IF
[000:26:56;531] THEY THOUGHT THE INFORMATION
[000:26:58;366] MIGHT FIND ITS WAY TO THE
[000:27:00;268] RUSSIANS?
[000:27:00;635] >> THAT'S THE $64,000 QUESTION.
[000:27:02;570] I'M SURE GENERAL McMASTER AND
[000:27:04;673] HIS TEAM ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
[000:27:06;274] THAT.
[000:27:06;608] BECAUSE THEY RELY ON THE
[000:27:09;944] JORDANIANS AS THE JORDANIANS
[000:27:13;448] RELY ON US.
[000:27:15;450] THEY THINK THE EXCHANGE WOULDN'T
[000:27:19;988] BE GOOD.
[000:27:21;489] THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS WE HAVE A
[000:27:22;891] COMMON ENEMY.
[000:27:24;626] ISIS DESTROYED ONE OF THEIR
[000:27:27;362] FLIGHTS AROUND SEVERAL HUNDRED
[000:27:28;129] RUSSIAN CIVILIANS WERE MURDERED
[000:27:30;732] AND HE WANTED TO HELP THEM FIND
[000:27:32;267] OUT WHAT ISIS WAS UP TO AND
[000:27:33;968] WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED.
[000:27:35;437] I'M SURE IF GENERAL McMASTER
[000:27:37;472] AHEAD OF TIME, HE WOULD HAVE
[000:27:39;808] SUGGESTED THE PRESIDENT USE
[000:27:40;709] DIFFERENT WORDS.
[000:27:41;242] >> Shepard: THANK YOU.
[000:27:41;876] >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
[000:27:43;545] >> Shepard: PRESIDENT TRUMP

[000:37:26;494] THAT SOMEONE MIGHT DRAW THE
[000:37:28;095] CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE NORTH
[000:37:30;498] KOREANS?
[000:37:30;831] WE KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE
[000:37:31;933] WHATEVER THEY DO LOOK LIKE
[000:37:34;035] SOMEBODY ELSE DID IT?
[000:37:35;670] >> WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS
[000:37:39;140] ATTRIBUTION.
[000:37:39;540] WE SAW, WE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,
[000:37:43;177] BUT COMPANIES LIKE SAMANTAC AND
[000:37:46;847] SOME LABS IN RUSSIA, THEY SAW
[000:37:49;350] BITS AND PIECES OF THIS ATTACK
[000:37:51;252] THAT WAS USED IN PREVIOUS
[000:37:52;553] ATTACKS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS
[000:37:56;157] HAD A HAND IN.
[000:37:57;325] YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SONY
[000:37:59;093] PICTURES DEBACLE.
[000:37:59;961] WE THINK THE NORTH KOREANS WERE
[000:38:03;097] INVOLVED IN THE BANGLADESH
[000:38:06;233] SENTRA BANK ATTACK AND ANOTHER
[000:38:07;635] POLAND BANK ATTACK.
[000:38:08;569] SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, YOU
[000:38:11;472] SEE THE SAME FINGERPRINT,
[000:38:13;574] USUALLY LEADS YOU TO THE SAME
[000:38:15;009] CONCLUSION.
[000:38:15;409] PEOPLE CAN FAKE DATA AND CHANGE
[000:38:18;312] THINGS AROUND AROUND MAKE THINGS
[000:38:19;680] LOOK LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.
[000:38:22;550] BUT ENOUGH DATA POINTS SUGGEST
[000:38:24;652] THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAD SOME
[000:38:26;654] HAND IN THIS.
[000:38:27;355] >> Shepard: IF THEY HAD DONE
[000:38:28;756] THIS IN A PHYSICAL WAY, IN OTHER
[000:38:30;458] WORDS, USING HUMANS, GOING TO
[000:38:32;193] THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO DO
[000:38:33;427] WHAT THEY'RE ALLEGED TO HAVE
[000:38:35;029] DONE IN A CYBER WAY, THAT MIGHT
[000:38:37;631] BE CONSIDERED AN ACT OF PRETTY
[000:38:39;967] EXTREME AGGRESSION.
[000:38:41;836] SOME MIGHT TREND TOWARDS AN ACT
[000:38:43;337] OF WAR.
[000:38:45;172] WHY IS THIS NOT?
[000:38:46;574] >> WELL, BECAUSE CYBER IS A
[000:38:50;277] STRANGE THING.
[000:38:50;911] EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD THE
[000:38:54;115] INTERNET FOR SEVERAL DECADES
[000:38:55;950] NOW, WE DON'T THINK OF IT IN WAR
[000:38:58;319] CONCEPT.
[000:38:58;886] WE TALK NORTH KOREA AND THEIR
[000:39:00;287] NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS, THE
[000:39:02;256] MISSILE CAPABILITIES.
[000:39:03;491] WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEIR
[000:39:05;092] CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
[000:39:08;362] ALL AIMED AT SOUTH KOREA.
[000:39:10;264] THE THING ABOUT CYBER IS,
[000:39:12;533] THERE'S NO DISTANT ISSUE HERE.
[000:39:13;768] IF YOU FIRE A MISSILE, YOU HAVE
[000:39:16;137] TO MAKE TO IT JAPAN OR SOUTH
[000:39:19;140] KOREA.
[000:39:19;440] ON CYBER, THEY'RE INSIDE THE
[000:39:21;308] GATE.
[000:39:21;742] DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HERE IN
[000:39:23;377] THE UNITED STATES OR DOING
[000:39:24;378] THINGS ELSEWHERE.
[000:39:26;614] YOU ARE HERE.

[000:40:00;014] THE TURKS CALLED THE KURDS
[000:40:01;949] TERRORIST.
[000:40:02;416] PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAY THEY NEED

[000:40:08;589] TERRORISTS IS ANOTHER COUNTRY'S

[000:41:24;865] DOING SO WITH IRAN AND RUSSIA.
[000:41:27;902] THE UNITED STATES IS OBSERVING
[000:41:28;836] THE TALKS AND VIEWS THEM WITH

[000:41:41;916] HE SAID HE'S IMPRISONED HIS
[000:41:44;985] POLITICAL OPPONENTS.
[000:41:46;754] HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE CRITICIZED THE
[000:41:48;222] PRESIDENT FOR A MEETING LAST

[000:53:17;494] OFFICERS PUT DOWN SPIKE STRIPS
[000:53:18;395] BUT KEPT GOING.
[000:53:20;163] WHEN THE VEHICLE FINALLY
[000:53:22;866] STOPPED, THE PASSENGER STARTED
[000:53:25;368] FIRING AND SOMEONE SHOT HIM.
[000:53:26;970] IN NEW YORK, INVESTIGATORS ARE

[000:53:47;991] TRIAL.
[000:53:49;259] ACCUSATIONS HE STOLE SOMEONE'S
[000:53:50;794] JOKES.
[000:53:51;094] THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN AN DIG
[000:53:52;062] A HAS REFUSED TO THROW OUT A
[000:53:54;631] FEDERAL COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
[000:53:57;234] LAWSUIT.
[000:53:57;601] COMEDY WRITER CLAIMS HE POSTED
[000:53:59;135] THE JOKES ONLINE AND O'BRIEN
[000:54:01;371] LATER USED THEM ALMOST WORD FOR
[000:54:02;872] WORD ON HIS LATE NIGHT SHOW.
[000:54:04;674] THE LAWYERS HERE ARE COMPARING
[000:54:07;244] HIT ONLINE POSTS TO TIME STAMPED
[000:54:11;047] E-MAILS WITH WRITERS OF THE SHOW
[000:54:13;984] TO PROVE THE CASE.

[000:54:18;355] DENIED THE ALLEGATION SAYING THE
[000:54:20;957] MATERIAL WAS ORIGINAL.
[000:54:21;791] IF YOU EVER TOSSED TRASH IN THE
[000:54:24;961] OCEAN, A DECENT CHANCE THAT
[000:54:28;632] SCIENTISTS KNOW WHERE IT WENT.
[000:54:29;899] AN ISLAND THAT WOULD BE A
[000:54:32;302] TROPICAL PARADISE IS FULL OF 38
[000:54:34;170] MILLION PIECES OF GARBAGE AND NO
[000:54:35;872] PEOPLE.
[000:54:36;206] >> NO.
[000:54:36;539] IT'S PROBABLY HARD TO FIND A
[000:54:37;874] PLACE MORE REMOTE THAN THIS.
[000:54:40;644] HENDERSON ISLAND, HALFWAY
[000:54:42;312] BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CHILE --
[000:54:43;980] >> Shepard: MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.
[000:54:45;115] >> YEAH, IT IS.
[000:54:46;549] SIX MILES LONG, THREE MILES WIDE
[000:54:50;420] AND COVERED IN TRASH.
[000:54:52;555] 38 MILLION PEOPLES IS WHAT
[000:54:53;857] RESEARCHERS ARE ESTIMATING.
[000:54:55;892] THEY SAY MORE WASHES UP
[000:54:57;827] DAY.
[000:54:58;495] >> Shepard: WHY HERE?
[000:54:59;796] >> THE OCEAN CURRENTING CONVERGE
[000:55:02;766] IN THAT AREA.
[000:55:03;733] IT ACTS LIKE A SONG.
[000:55:05;435] THE FLOATING PIECES OF PLASTIC
[000:55:09;172] GET STUCK.
[000:55:09;673] THERE'S A HIGHER DENSITY OF
[000:55:12;375] TRASH HERE MORE THAN ANYWHERE IN
[000:55:13;710] THE WORLD.
[000:55:14;411] THIS HAS HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT
[000:55:15;779] ON THE WILDLIFE THERE.
[000:55:18;381] THE POOR CRAB HERE.
[000:55:20;116] THAT'S NOT WHAT SHOULD THEY LOOK
[000:55:22;085] LIKE.
[000:55:22;385] >> Shepard: YEAH.
[000:55:22;919] SHOULD LOOK LIKE DINNER.
[000:55:25;655] THAT ABE RIGHT.
[000:55:27;824] >> Shepard: ANYTHING OTHER THAN
[000:55:30;860] PLASTIC TO EAT SAID CRAB DINNER.
[000:55:34;764] SOMEBODY SHOULD CLEAN IT UP.
[000:55:35;732] >> IT'S HARD TO DO.
[000:55:36;966] IT'S SO FAR AWAY.
[000:55:38;234] IT'S ABOUT 3,000 MILES TO THE
[000:55:39;769] NEXT POPULATED CITY.
[000:55:42;205] SO IT'S TOUGH TO GET SUPPLIES
[000:55:44;374] THERE AND THEN TO GET SUPPLIES
[000:55:47;877] OFF OF THERE.
[000:55:49;145] >> Shepard: RISING SEE WILL
[000:55:50;480] PROBABLY WATCH IT AWAY.
[000:55:52;315] >> AND THEN GO TO THE ARCTIC,
[000:55:55;418] WHICH IS ALSO A MESS?
[000:55:57;053] THANKS, LILLY.
[000:55:58;221] WE'LL BE BACK WITH A FIRST LOOK
[000:56:00;757] AT THE WOMAN TO MAKE TO IT THE

[000:59:42;412] 30,000 FEET.
[000:59:43;780] SHE WAS FIVE FEET TALL AND 90
[000:59:46;649] POUNDS.
[000:59:46;983] ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE
[000:59:49;519] MOUNTAIN, AN AVALANCHE KNOCKED
[000:59:50;820] HER OUT FOR A WHILE AND BURIED
[000:59:52;555] THE GROUP'S CAMP.
[000:59:54;023] SHE LEFT THE TEAM AT THE CAMP
[000:59:56;359] AND 12 DAYS LATER REACHED THE

[001:00:36;099] THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO EXERCISE
[001:00:38;134] DISCIPLINE WHEN TALKING TO
[001:00:39;469] LEADERS.
[001:00:39;869] >> THE PRESIDENT IN NO WAY
