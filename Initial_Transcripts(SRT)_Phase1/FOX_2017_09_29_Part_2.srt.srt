THESE FLIGHTS WERE CLEARLY TO

POSSIBILITIES.

$51,000, THAT'S NO GUARANTEE

AS FAR AS PUERTO RICO IS        

63
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,100
CONCERNED, THAT'S BEEN GOING    
REALLY WELL.                    

64
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,670
IT'S BEEN TOTAL DEVASTATION.    
WE HAVE OVER 10,000 PEOPLE IN

WE'RE GETTING TRUCK DRIVERS     

66
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,645
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE FROM PUERTO  
RICO, THE DRIVERS JUST AREN'T

THERE.                          
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THEIR HOMES.

68

THEY HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS.       
LIKEWISE WITH THE POLICE FORCE. 

69
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:56,188
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING REALLY   
WELL CONSIDERING.               

70
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:01,560
RICK SCOTT, GOVERNOR WAS FLORIDA
WAS THERE.                      

71
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,861
HE'S GOING TO GET INVOLVED ALSO 
WITH PUERTO RICO.               

72
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,264

A BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT         

74
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:14,439
HAPPENS -- WE HAVE TO REBUILD.  
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, THE          

75
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:19,211
ELECTORATE IS GONE, THE ROADS   
ARE GONE, THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

76
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,913
ARE GONE.                       
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT WILL  

77
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,982
HAPPEN LATER.                   
IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION.         

78
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,686
THE LOSS OF LIFE IS ALWAYS      
TRAGIC.                         

79
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,725
BUT IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE THE    
RESULTS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH     

80
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,861
RESPECT TO LOSS OF LIFE.        
PEOPLE CAN'T BELIEVE HOW        

81
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:45,103
SUCCESSFUL THAT HAS BEEN        
RELATIVELY SPEAKING.

HAS BEEN UNBELIEVABLY GENEROUS  

85
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,479
WITH HIS STATEMENTS.            
HE'S BEEN PRAISING OUR EFFORTS. 

86
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,814
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT -- THIS
IS A TOTAL DEVASTATION.         

87
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,282
WHEN YOU LOOKS AT TEXAS AND WHEN
YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA, YOU KNOW,  

88
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,550
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT LEVEL.   
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN.           

89
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,951
WHEN YOU HAVE A CATEGORY FIVE   
WIFE OUT AN ISLAND LIKE THIS.   

90
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,152
YOU HAVE NOTHING.               
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ROADS, YOU   

91
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,387
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.            
YOU DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE TO    

92
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,688
OPERATE THE EQUIPMENT.          
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF  

93
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,792
TRUCK DRIVERS BEING BROUGHT IN  
TO THE ISLAND TO OPERATE THE

00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:41,860
TRUCKS.                         
BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE HAVE LOST  

95
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,261
THEIR HOMES.                    
SO THEY'RE UNABLE TO DO IT.     

96
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,897
AND THE POLICE HAVE LOST THEIR  
HOMES.                          

97
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:54,239
SO THEY'RE UNABLE TO DO IT.     
IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION, JOHN.   

98
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:58,343
>> WAS IT TOO EARLY TO SAY      
PUERTO RICO WAS A GOOD STORY?   

99
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,880
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT.        
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, WE'VE DONE 

100
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,016
AN INCREDIBLE JOB CONSIDERING   
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORK WITH.   

101
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:23,902
A VERY BIG QUESTION IS WHAT ARE 
WE GOING TO                     

102
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,673
            DO WITH THE POWER

103

OUT.                            

104
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:30,742
IT'S NOT LIKE LET'S GO BACK AND 
FIX IT.                         

105
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,910
THAT'S WHAT I DO.               
I'M A GOOD CONSTRUCTION GUY.    

106
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,111
YOU DON'T GO BACK AND FIX IT.   
THERE IS NOTHING.               

107
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,312
THE POWER GRID IS GONE.         
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF BIG         

108
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,413
DECISIONS.

113
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,957

00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:08,580
.                               
>> [QUESTION INAUDIBLE]         

118
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,018
>> WE'RE LOOKING AT PUERTO RICO.
THAT'S A VERY, VERY BIG THING   

119
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:18,823
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.           
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SPENDING        

120
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,125
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS RIGHT NOW. 
IT'S A TERRITORY.               

121
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,795
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.         
I KNOW THE PEOPLE VERY WELL.    

122
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,866
THEY'RE GREAT PEOPLE.           
THERE'S A MASSIVE INVESTMENT.   

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,904
YOU'RE REBUILDING ALL OF IT.    
AT SOME POINT, AS YOU KNOW,     

124
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,708
THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS -- 
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY    

125
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:41,179
ALREADY INVESTED IN PUERTO RICO 
BY OTHERS BEFORE THE STORMS.    

126
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,114
THAT MONEY HAS BEEN IN SERIOUS  
TROUBLE.                        

127
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,617
SO NOW ON TOP OF IT, A LOT OF   
OTHER MONEY.                    

128
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:51,923
SO A LOT OF -- LOOK, A DECISION 
HAS TO BE MADE.                 

129
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,793
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?       
PUERTO RICO WAS FLATTENED.      

130
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,228
A BIG DECISION COMES AS TO WHAT 
WE'RE GOING TO DO.              

131
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:06,137
I'M THERE TO HELP.              
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.            

132
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,273
>> [QUESTION INAUDIBLE]         
>> WE HAVE GREAT SECRETARIES AND

133
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,576
WE HAVE SOME THAT OWN THEIR OWN 
PLANES, AS YOU KNOW.            

134
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:17,983
THAT SOLVES THAT.               
BUT WE PUT IT AN ORDER NO MORE  

135
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:27,125
PLANES.                         
LOOK AT PAST ADMINISTRATIONS.   

136
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,627
LOOK AT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

137
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,095
TIME THAT THEY SPENT IN THE AIR,
THEY SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE 

138
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,096
AIR.                            
BUT I FELT VERY BADLY BECAUSE   

139
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,631
SECRETARY PRICE IS A GOOD MAN.  
BUT WE'RE LOOKING INTO IT AND   

140
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:40,772
WE'RE LOOKING TO IT STRONGLY.   
>> DO YOU CONSIDER IT A FIREABLE

141
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,908
OFFENSE?                        
>> WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.           

142
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:50,048
I'LL ANNOUNCE SOMETHING IN THE  
NEAR FUTURE.                    

143
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:56,921
>> [QUESTION INAUDIBLE]         
>> I HAVE A GREAT CABINET.      

144
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,423
WE SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS.   

145
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,825
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.       
WITH THE F-35 FIGHTER PLANE, ME,

146
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,529
MYSELF, I'VE SAID HUNDREDS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN          

147
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,365
NEGOTIATING.                    
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I     

148
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,602
DON'T LIKE SEEING ANYBODY EVEN  
HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT FLYING.   

149
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,606
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.   
WE'RE SAVING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS 

150
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,176
OF MONEY NO MATTER WHERE WE GO. 
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN      

151
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,712
FLORIDA OR TEXAS.               
WE'VE DONE THAT FOR RELATIVELY  

152
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,881
LITTLE COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER   
PEOPLE DO.                      

153
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,550
SO I DON'T LIKE TO SEE THAT     
HAPPEN.                         

154
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:31,022
I THINK IT'S A SHAME.           
AS A HUMAN BEING, TOM PRICE IS A

155
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:38,797
VERY GOOD MAN.                  
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.            

156
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,767
>> [QUESTION INAUDIBLE]

>> I'VE HAD FOUR MEETINGS FROM  

158
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,945
THE FED CHAIRMAN AND I'LL BE    
MAKING A DECISION OVER THE NEXT 

159
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:13,565
TWO OR THREE WEEKS.

161
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:20,438
HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB AT     
FEMA.                           

162
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,673

WORKING VERY HARD.              

163
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,141
YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT FEMA HAS 
DONE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE BETWEEN

164
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,242
ALL OF THESE HURRICANES AND     
DOING SO WELL.                  

165
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,610
BUT WE'LL BE MAKING THAT        
DECISION PROBABLY WITHIN A      

166
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,812
MONTH.

167

168
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:36,054

>> I'VE SPOKEN TO OTHER OWNERS. 

169
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,922
I REALLY THINK IT'S COMING      
TOGETHER.                       

170
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:42,627
I NOTICED LAST NIGHT OR I WAS   
TOLD -- I DIDN'T SEE IT, BUT I  

171
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,696
HEARD EVERYBODY STOOD FOR THE   
NATIONAL ANTHEM.                

172
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,967
THAT SHOWS RESPECT FOR OUR      
COUNTRY, OUR FLAG AND FOR THE

00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,703

SO YOU KNOW, I'M VERY HAPPY.    

174
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,872
I HEARD THAT.                   
AND THEY SHOULD STAND.          

175
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:58,076
YOU HAVE TO STAND.              
IT'S OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.       

176
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,313

OTHERWISE.                      

181
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,997

187

00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:37,061
I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING 
FOR GOOD GUYS OR BAD            

228
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,467
                     GUYS.      
THEY'RE LOOKING TO PLACE BLAME. 

229
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,634
THE PARTISANS TO THE LEFT ARE   
BLAMING TRUMP.                  

230
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,103
THE PARTISANS TO THE RIGHT ARE  
BLAMING THE INCOMPETENT PUERTO  

231
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,270
RICAN GOVERNMENT.               
I THINK THE REALITY -- THE      

232
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,705
PRESIDENT -- I DON'T DISAGREE   
WITH ANYTHING HE SAID REPORTING 

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,806
PUERTO RICO.                    
THE PERSONS OR THE TWO PEOPLE   

234
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:49,774
MOST TO BLAME ARE IRMA AND      
MARIA.                          

235
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,209
THE TWO HISTORIC DEVASTATING    
HURRICANES THAT HIT THIS ISLAND 

236
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,312
WITHIN A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS AND
KNOCKED IT TO ITS KNEES.        

237
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:59,017
THE DEVASTATION ACCURATELY      
PORTRAYED IS STEM TO STERN, EAST

238
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,686
TO WEST, NORTH TO SOUTH.        
I DON'T THINK THERE'S A PERSON  

239
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,591
IN THIS 3.4 MILLION RESIDENTS OF
THIS ISLAND WHO HAS BEEN LEFT   

240
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,127
UNAFFECTED.                     
THE SOUTH SIDE WHERE THE        

241
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:13,064
GOVERNMENT HAS NOT YET MADE     
THEIR SURVEYS, WHO HAVE BROUGHT 

242
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,567
DIRECT ASSISTANCE, IS STILL     
DEVASTATED.                     

243
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,238
ROADS BLOCKED EVERYWHERE.       
IF YOU NEED TO PLACE BLAME AT   

244
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,675
ALL, I THINK IT'S ON THE FAILURE
OF THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM. 

245
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:31,649
THE ELECTRICAL GRID.            
YOU KNOW, I WAS HERE SEPTEMBER A

246
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,151
YEAR AGO WHERE THE ELECTRIC     
POWER GRID WENT OUT FOR THREE   

247
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,486
DAYS BECAUSE OF A FIRE IN A     
SINGLE POWER PLANT.             

248
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:40,458
IRMA KNOCKED OUT 70% OF THE     
POWER GRID THAT WAS NOT YET     

249
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,729
RESTORED WHEN MARIA CAME AND    
KNOCKED OUT THE REST OF IT.     

250
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:48,132
THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T PUMP THE  
GAS OUT OF GROUND OR THE WATER  

251
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,135
OUT OF THE GROUND OR CAN'T RUN  
ELEVATORS OR AIR CONDITIONING.  

252
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,239
THAT'S WHY HOSPITALS ARE RELYING
ON EMERGENCY GENERATORS.        

253
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,876
THERE IS NO POWER.              
THE BANKRUPT AND THE PRESIDENT  

254
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:05,016
REFERRED TO THIS, TRACE,        
DIRECTLY, THE BANKRUPT PUERTO   

255
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,188
RICO ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY,  
PREPA, THEY'RE $36 BILLION IN   

256
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,423
DEBT.                           
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR POOR    

257
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:21,499
MAINTENANCE AND AN OLD SYSTEM.  
WHERE THE CABLES AND POLES ON   

258
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:28,439
THIS ISLAND, THERE ARE OUTAGES  
ON EVERY SINGLE BLOCK.          

259
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:37,715
IT'S GOING TO TAKE HUNDREDS AND 
HUNDREDS OF POLE MEN, LINEMEN TO

260
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,883
PUT TELEPHONE POLES IN TO STRING
IT UP.                          

261
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:39,951
THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO CELL PHONE
SERVICE.                        

262
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,086
THERE'S NO INTERNET.            
THAT'S WHY THE PANIC HAS BEEN   

263
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,022
GRIPPING THE PUERTO RICAN       
PEOPLE.                         

264
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,657
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING THE RIGHT
THING.                          

265
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,761
HE'S RIGHT, THIS IS WHERE THE   
RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD, TRACE.   

266
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:55,199
REMEMBER, THE POWER AUTHORITY,  
$6 BILLION IN DEBT AND BANKRUPT.

267
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,603
HOW MUCH IS THE UNITED STATES   
WILLING TO PAY TO HELP THE      

268
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,640
PUERTO RICAN PEOPLE STAY AWAY   
FROM SLIDING INTO THE THIRD     

269
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:03,975
WORLD?                          
RIGHT NOW PUERTO RICO IS IN THE 

270
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:10,848
DARK AGES.                      
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING OF 

271
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,350
THE SCALE OF THE MARTIAL PLAN   
THAT REBUILT EUROPE AFTER THE   

272
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,887
CHAOS AND THE ASHES AND THE     
DESTRUCTION OF WORLD WAR II.    

273
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,858
I SAY CALL IT THE TRUMP PLAN IF 
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.           

274
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,129
HE BUILT THESE IMPRESSIVE       
BUILDINGS AND THE HOTELS AND SO 

275
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,965
FORTH.                          
IF THE PRESIDENT IS COMMITTED TO

276
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:38,142
RAISING MULTIBILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO REBUILD THIS JUNK, TO STRING 

277
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:43,848
ELECTRIC POWER FROM TOWN TO     
TOWN.                           

278
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,049
THERE'S NOTICE WRONG WITH THE   
POWER PLANTS.                   

279
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,250
THAT'S THE IRONY.               
THE POWER PLANTS ARE FINE.      

280
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,554
IT'S THE GRID.                  
IT'S THE POWER CABLES           

281
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,122
THEMSELVES.                     
THE LINES THEMSELVES THAT HAVE  

282
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:57,094
NOT AND COULD NOT AND NEVER     
COULD WITHSTAND 150, 160, 170   

283
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,096
MILES AN HOUR WINDS, TRACE.     
>> Trace: AND A KEY TO THIS     

284
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,401
WHOLE THING, GERALDO, WHO WILL  
PAY FOR WHAT DOWN THERE.        

285
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,103
GREAT WORK IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO  
RICO.                           

286
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,740
THANKS, GERALDO.                
WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP   

287
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:16,547
SAID HE WILL DECIDE TONIGHT IF  
HIS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES   

288
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,082
SECRETARY TOM PRICE IS IN OR OUT
AFTER HE USED TAXPAYER MONEY FOR

289
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,418
EXPENSIVE CHARTER FLIGHTS.      
OUR POLITICAL PANEL WEIGHS IN   

290
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,485
NEXT.                           

291
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,958
       If you're approaching 65,

292
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,160
           now's the time to get
            your ducks in a row.

293
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:39,230
        To learn about Medicare,
       and the options you have.

294
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,932
       You see, Medicare doesn't
          cover everything -    

295
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,603
         only about 80% of your 
        Part B medical expenses.

296
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,505
          The rest is up to you.

297
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,241
  So if 65 is around the corner,
          think about an        

298
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,344
        AARP Medicare Supplement
            Insurance Plan,     

299
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,147
     insured by UnitedHealthcare
         Insurance Company.     

300
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:59,150
  Like all standardized Medicare
   supplement insurance plans,  

301
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,585
       they help cover some of  
      what Medicare doesn't pay.

302
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,522
       And could save you in    
    out-of-pocket medical costs.

303
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,656
                  So don't wait.

304
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,725
       Call to request your free
            Decision Guide.     

305
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,495
 And gather the information now 
to help you choose a plan later.

306
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,531
        These types of plans let
          you pick any doctor   

307
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,866
          or hospital that takes
            Medicare patients.  

308
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,902
          And there's a range of
           plans to choose from,

309
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,638
          depending on you needs
             and your budget.   

310
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,842
   So if you're turning 65 soon,
     call now and get started.  

311
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:28,279
       Because the time to think
      about tomorrow...is today.

312
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,613
                        Go long.

313
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,086

THAT CREATES ANOTHER CHALLENGE  
FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, GETTING    

350
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:41,412
ANOTHER SECRETARY IF PRICE WERE 
TO GO CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE.  

351
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,616
IN LIGHT OF HEALTHCARE BEING THE
NUMBER 1 ISSUE AFTER TAXES FOR  

352
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,820
THE PRESIDENT TO BE TACKLING.   
>> Trace: DO YOU AGREE, CAPRI,  

353
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:54,892
THAT THE $51,000 PAY BACK IS NOT
GOING TO CUT IT?                

354
00:24:55,026 --> 00:25:00,498
>> I CERTAINLY THINK THERE'S ANY
TIME THERE'S AN EXORBITANT      

355
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:10,875
AMOUNT OF TAX DOLLARS FOR AN    
UNJUSTIFIABLE USE, $500,000,    

356
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,345
$51,000, I'D SURMISE THAT       
$51,000 IS USED TO PAY BACK THE 

357
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,447
TRAVEL OF SECRETARY PRICE'S     
WIFE.                           

358
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:22,753
THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF      
SECRETARY MNUCHIN UTILIZING A   

359
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,589
GOVERNMENT PLANE TO GO TO       
KENTUCKY AND HANG OUT AT FORT   

360
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,894
NEXT AND MAYBE SEE THE ECLIPSE. 
SO I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS  

361
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:33,697
TWO CHOICES AT THIS POINT.      
ONE, EITHER ASK HIM, DEMAND HE  

362
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:37,468
PAY BACK THE FULL AMOUNT OF     
MONEY FOR THE TAX DOLLARS AND   

363
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:44,942
CREATE A POLICY WHEREBY NO      
MEMBER THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY    

364
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:47,211
JURISDICTION INTERNATIONALLY IS 
UTILIZING THESE PLANES OR HE    

365
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,780
LETS THEM GO.                   
THE OTHER THING THAT MAYBE HE'S 

366
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:53,050
DOING IS UTILIZING PRESIDENT    
TRUMP --                        

367
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:57,221
>> Trace: LET ME GET BRAD IN    
HERE.                           

368
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,491
WE HAVE TO GO.                  
THIS WAS THE GUY HEAD OF THE    

369
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,595
REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE.     
THIS IS ABOUT GOVERNMENT        

370
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,096
SPENDING.                       
SO I HAVE ONE SECONDS FOR YOU.  

371
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,833
GO AHEAD.                       
>> AND IN WASHINGTON, YOU HAVE  

372
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,470
TO DO AS I SAY.                 
AND NOT AS I DO.                

373
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,839
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE.             
YOU HAVE TO MEAN WHAT YOU SAY   

374
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:19,076
AND DO WHAT YOU ASK OTHER PEOPLE
TO EXPECT FROM YOU.             

375
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,012
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.         
>> Trace: RIGHT.                

376
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,416
BRAD, CAPRI, THANKS BOTH.       
>> THANK YOU.

382

     Okay, yep. Good night.

 When you have type 2 diabetes, 
      you manage your A1C,      

397
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,783
but you also have a higher risk 
   of heart attack or stroke.   

398
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:09,086
      Non-insulin Victoza®      
          lowers A1C,           

399
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,855
        and now reduces         
      cardiovascular risk.      

400
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,792
Victoza® lowers my              
A1C and blood sugar             

401
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:16,527
better than                     
the leading                     
branded pill.

             (AVO)

treating cardiovascular disease,
    Victoza® is NOW approved    

404
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,802
   to lower the risk of major   
     cardiovascular events      

405
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,737
such as heart attack,           
stroke, or death.               

406
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,972
       And while it isn't       
        for weight loss,        

407
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:31,275
          Victoza® may          
   help you lose some weight.

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,078
             (AVO)              
Victoza® is not for people with 
        type 1 diabetes         

409
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,813
   or diabetic ketoacidosis.    

410
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,716
Do not take Victoza® if you have
  a personal or family history  

411
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,484
  of medullary thyroid cancer,  

412
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,153
       Multiple Endocrine       
   Neoplasia syndrome type 2,   

413
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,822
     or if you are allergic     
          to Victoza®           

414
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:46,490
   or any of its ingredients.   

415
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,992
  Stop taking Victoza® and get  
    medical help right away     

416
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:52,463
if you get symptoms of a serious
allergic reaction such as rash, 

417
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:54,765
 swelling, difficulty breathing 
         or swallowing.         

418
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,434
Serious side effects may happen,
    including pancreatitis.     

419
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,003
    So, stop taking Victoza®    
and call your doctor right away 

420
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,439
    if you have severe pain     
     in your stomach area.      

421
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:04,441
        Tell your doctor        
     your medical history.      

422
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,443
   Gallbladder problems have    
    happened in some people.    

423
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,779
  Tell your doctor right away   
      if you get symptoms.      

424
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:11,048
      Taking Victoza® with      
   a sulfonylurea or insulin    

425
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,783
   may cause low blood sugar.   

426
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,419
Common side effects are nausea, 
      diarrhea, vomiting,       

427
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:18,122
      decreased appetite,       
 indigestion, and constipation. 

428
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,556
          Side effects          
    can lead to dehydration,
