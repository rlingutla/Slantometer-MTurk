LAURA INGLE IS IN FOR HARRIS

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
FAULKNER.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
FACING CHALLENGES AT HOME AND

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
ABROAD AS IT RAMPS UP THE SEARCH

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
FOR THE NEXT FBI DIRECTOR AND

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
RESPONSE ON THE LATEST NORTH

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
KOREAN MISSILE LAUNCH.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
THIS IS THE FOX REPORT.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
THE WHITE HOUSE IS RESPONDING TO

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
THE LATEST PROVOCATION FROM

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
NORTH KOREA.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
IT CAME JUST A DAY AFTER A
SENIOR NORTH KOREAN DIPLOMAT

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
SAID THEY WOULD ENGAGE IN TALK

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
WITH THE U.S.
MEANWHILE, THE ADMINISTRATION

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
WASTING NO TIME ON THE SEARCH

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
FOR A NEW FBI DIRECTOR.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
THEY ARE WEIGHING IN ON MORE

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
THAN A DOZEN CANDIDATES AND
INTERVIEWING AT LEAST EIGHT OF

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
THEM THIS WEEKEND.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID WE COULD

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT BY FRIDAY

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
BEFORE HEADING ON HIS FIRST

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
FOREIGN TRIP AS PRESIDENT.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
THIS IS HAPPENING AS THE

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO PUT

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
OUT A FIRE STORM AFTER JAMES

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
COMAY'S OUSTING.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
WHITE HOUSE COUNSELOR KELLYANNE

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
CONWAY SAID THAT IS NOT THE CA

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
CASE.
>> INDEPENDENT OF THAT, HIS

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
OVERSEES THE FBI, THAT'S HIS
JOB, HE CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
ON HIS OWN AND MADE THE

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
RECOMMENDATION.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
NOW, I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
EVERYONE IS SAYING JAMES COMEY
WAS INVESTIGATING.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
NO, HE WASN'T.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
THE FBI WAS INVESTIGATING AND

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
INVESTIGATE.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
LAURA: WE HAVE FOX TEAM COVERAGE

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
ON ALL OF THIS.
CAROLINE SHIVELY IS IN

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
WASHINGTON WITH THE LATEST ON

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
NORTH KOREA.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
FIRST WE GO TO KEVIN ON THE

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
NORTH LAWN AND WE HAVE HEARD THE

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO FILL THE

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
POST AT THE FBI BY FRIDAY.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
WHAT IS THE HURRY?

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
>> I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THEY FEEL THIS IS A POSITION

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
THEY CAN FILL WITH RELATIVE EASE
AND FIND A VERY HIGHLY QUALIFIED

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
CANDIDATE.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
IN FACT, YOU CAN MAKE A
PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT THAT

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
WHITTLING DOWN THE FIELD IS
PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE MOST

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
DIFFICULT PART HAS AS I SHOW YOU

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THE NAMES AND FACES WE'VE

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT, WE ARE

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
TALKING OF SOME OF THE MOST
HIGHLY QUALIFIED SPECIALISTS IN

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
THIS AREA.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
BIG NAMES INCLUDE FRAN TOWNSEND,

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
MIKE ROGERS, HIMSELF A FORMER

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
FBI AGENT AND HE HAS ALSO BEEN

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
ENDORSED BY A GROUP OF FORMER

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
AND CURRENT FBI AGENTS.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
FOR HIS PART, THE PRESIDENT
SPENT HIS SATURDAY DELIVERING

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
HIS VERY FIRST COMMENCEMENT

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ADDRESS AT LIBERTY UNIVERSITY.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
HE SAID THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE A

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
GREAT DEAL OF TIME TO WHITTLE

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
DOWN.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
>> BEFORE YOU LEAVE BEFORE
SATURDAY'S DEPARTURE.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
>> THESE ARE OUTSTANDING PEOPLE

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
WHO ARE VERY WELL KNOWN.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> BEFORE THE TRIP NEXT WEEK?

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
>> EVEN THAT IS POSSIBLE.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
>> SOURCES TELL FOX NEWS IT'S

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
UNLIKELY THE PRESIDENT WILL LOOK

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
FOR SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM A

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
SPECIFIC OR STRICTLY POLITICAL

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
BACKGROUND.
LIKELY HE WILL DRAW ON SOMEONE

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
WHO HAS EXPERIENCE FROM THE

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
SPECIFICALLY AND MAYBE SOMEONE

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
WHO CAN SAY THEY'VE DONE A BIT

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OF BOTH.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
LAURA: SOME FROM CAPITOL HILL
ARE FLOATING THEIR OWN IDEAS

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
ABOUT WHO THEY THINK MIGHT BE A

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
GOOD PERSON TO LEAD THE FBI.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING.

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
>> YOU WANT SOMEONE WHO IS NOT

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
JUST HIGHLY QUALIFIED.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
LAWMAKERS WILL TELL YOU YOU WANT

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT JUST

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
QUALIFIED, BUT PASSABLE AND THAT

102
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
MEANS APOLITICAL AS BEST YOU CAN

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
MANAGE THAT.
ONE NAME THAT'S BEEN TOSSED OUT,

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
IT'S COMPLETELY COUNTERINTUITIVE

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
BUT IT'S A NAME THAT PEOPLE ARE

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
TALKING ABOUT AND THAT IS
MERRICK GARLAND.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
CHIEF JUDGE MERRICK GARLAND.

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
REMEMBER HIM, NOMINATED FOR THE
SUPREME COURT.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
HE NEVER GOT AN UP OR DOWN VOTE.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
THERE ARE SOME WHO FEEL HE WOULD

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
BE A GREAT COMPROMISE CANDIDATE.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> THE OUTCOME OF INVESTIGATIONS

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
SHOULD NOT HAVE PARTISAN

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
AFFILIATION.
I THINK IN THIS INSTANCE THERE

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
MERRICK GARLAND WOULD BE A GOOD

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OPTION GIVEN THAT HE COULD HAVE

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
SO MUCH SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
OF THE AISLE.

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> I WOULD STRONGLY URGE THE

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
ADMINISTRATION TO PICK SOMEONE

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
WHO IS APOLITICAL.
ONE OF THE HEIGHTENED

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
RESPONSIBILITIES WE WILL HAVE IS

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
MAKING SURE THAT WHOEVER COMES

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
IN, THIS INVESTIGATION GOES ON

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
UNIMPEDED.

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
>> MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT,

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
GARLAND WOULD BE A VERY

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
LONGSHOT, BUT KEEP IN MIND THERE

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
ARE A NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS ON THE

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
HILL WHO FEEL THAT BECAUSE HE IS

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
APOLITICAL, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
MEDDLING IN THE 2016 ELECTION

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
CAMPAIGN.

137
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
KEEPING TRACK, IT ENDED SIX

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
MONTHS AGO.

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
LAURA: WE KNOW IT WILL BE AN

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
INTERESTING WEEK RIGHT WHERE YOU

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
ARE PAIRED NEW DETAILS ON THE

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
NORTH KOREAN MISSILE LAUNCH.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
U.S. OFFICIALS TELLING FOX NEWS
THE REGIME APPEARS TO HAVE FIRED

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
WHAT IS KNOWN AS A CAYENNE 17

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
BALLISTIC MISSILE.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
EXPERTS BELIEVE NORTH KOREA

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
WOULD USE THIS PARTICULAR

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
MISSILE TO TARGET SHIPS.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
OUT THIS WAS THE FIRST WEAPONS

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
TEST SINCE THE NEW SOUTH KOREAN

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE.
THE NORTH HAS CONDUCTED AT LEAST

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
TWO DOZEN TESTS OVER THE PAST

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
YEAR.

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
AT LEAST SEVEN OF THOSE FAILED.

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
THIS LATEST TEST APPEARS TO HAVE

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
SUNK THE IDEA OF THE U.S.

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
SPEAKING WITH NORTH KOREA.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
NIKKI HALEY SAYS THE U.S. CANNOT

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
LET UP.

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET INTO

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
KIM JONG-UN'S HEAD.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
HE IS IN A STATE OF PARANOIA.

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT ANYTHING

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
AND EVERYTHING AROUND HIM.
THIS WAS A MESSAGE TO SOUTH

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
KOREA AFTER THE ELECTION AND

168
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WHAT WE WILL DO IS TIGHTEN THE
SCREWS.

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
HE FEELS IT.
WE WILL CONTINUE WHETHER IT

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
SANCTIONS, PRESS STATEMENTS,

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
ANYTHING WE HAVE TO DO.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
LAURA: CAROLINE SHIVELY IS LIVE

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
IN WASHINGTON.

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
IF THIS IS A MEDIUM RANGE

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
MISSILE, WHAT DAMAGE CAN IT DO?

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
>> IT CAN DO SOME DEFINITE

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
DAMAGE.
WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THE NEWS

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
AGENCY SAID THE AIM WAS TO
VERIFY THAT THE MISSILE COULD

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
CARRY A LARGE SCALE NUCLEAR

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WARHEAD AND THEY ARE CALLING IT
A SUCCESS.

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
THERE IS WHAT U.S. OFFICIALS
SAY.

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
IT IS A SINGLE STAGE LIQUID
FUELED MISSILE, NOT THE SOLID

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
FUEL MISSILE THAT WAS TESTED

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
BACK IN FEBRUARY.

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
THAT CAUSED MORE CONCERN FOR
PENTAGON OFFICIALS.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
IT WAS IN THE AIR FOR ROUGHLY 30

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
MINUTES AND TRAVELED ABOUT
430 MILES ACCORDING TO THE SOUTH

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
KOREAN MILITARY.
A MEDIUM RANGE MISSILE CAN GO

189
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
FURTHER BUT THIS HAD A VERY HIGH

190
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
TRAJECTORY.

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
THE U.S. OFFICIALS THAT IT

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
SPLASHED DOWN IN THE SEAS

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
60 MILES SOUTH OF RUSSIA AND 25.

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
IT COULD NOT HAVE REACHED THE

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
U.S. BUT THE STATEMENT, JUST OUT

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
FROM THE NORTH REAFFIRMS IT IS

197
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
ONE OF KIM JONG-UN'S MAIN GOALS

198
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
FOR HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
DAN SULLIVAN OF ALASKA SAID HE

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
PLANS TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
NEXT WEEK THAT AUTHORIZES

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
GROUND-BASED INTERCEPTORS TO BE

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
LINED UP IN ALASKA AND

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
CALIFORNIA.

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
THAT IS A THIRD MORE THAN THE
U.S. HAS RIGHT NOW.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
>> WE KNOW THE U.S. IS PUSHING

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
BACK ON NORTH KOREA.

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
WE'VE BEEN REPORTING.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE

210
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY?

211
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
>> CHINA AND RUSSIA BOTH SAID

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

213
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
LAUNCH, BUT IT WAS A PRETTY

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
TEPID RESPONSE.

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
NOT THE U.S. THOUGH.
THEY SEEM TO BE PUSHING

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION TO GET

217
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
TOUGHER.

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
>> WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS

219
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
CONCERNED.
IT'S NOT JUST US AGAINST THEM.

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
YOU WILL SEE THE ENTIRE

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ISOLATE
NORTH KOREA AND LET THEM KNOW

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
>> THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL WILL

224
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
HOLD URGENT MEETINGS ON THE TEST

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THIS TUESDAY.

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
THE U.S., JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA
ALL ASKED FOR THE MEETING.

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
THEY HAVE ADOPTED TOUGH

228
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
SANCTIONS BUT THEY DON'T APPEAR

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
TO BE SLOWING KIM JONG-UN DOWN.

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
AMBASSADOR HALEY SAID MORE

231
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SANCTIONS COULD BE ON THE WAY

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
AND THE POTENTIAL MEETING

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
BETWEEN KIM JONG-UN AND

234
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP, NOT HAPPENING.

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
>> HAVING A MISSILE TEST IS NOT

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
THE WAY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
PRESIDENT.

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
HE ABSOLUTELY WON'T DO IT.

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
HE CAN SAY ALL THE CONDITIONS HE

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
WANTS.

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
UNTIL HE MEETS OUR CONDITIONS WE

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
AREN'T SITTING DOWN WITH HIM.

243
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
LAURA: YOU MENTION THE TIMING

244
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
JUST DAYS AFTER THE SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT CAME INTO OFFICE.

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
IT ALSO COMES AS THE U.S. AND

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
JAPANESE NAVIES HAVE COME

247
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
TOGETHER FOR WARGAMES IN THE

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
SOUTH PACIFIC.

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
LAURA: WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK
ABOUT.

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
LET'S BRING IN KEVIN RUDD WHO
JOINS US BY PHONE.

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
HE IS THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER

252
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OF AUSTRALIA AND PRESIDENT OF

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THE ASIA POLICY INSTITUTE.

254
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

255
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
>> DO YOU THINK THE RESPONSE

256
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

257
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO

258
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
CALM THE SITUATION DOWN?

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
HOW DO YOU THINK OUR ALLIES WILL

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HELP HANDLE THIS WITH DIPLOMACY?

261
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
>> REMEMBER THE KEY OBJECTIVE IS

262
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN NORTH

263
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
KOREAN BEHAVIOR.

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
EVERYTHING ELSE IS A SOUND AND

265
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
LIGHT SHOW.

266
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT CAN YOU

267
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
DO TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE IN

268
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
BEHAVIOR.

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
THE OUTCOME OF THE MAR-A-LAGO

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
MEETING WAS FOR THE TWO SIDES TO

271
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
WORK ON A COMMON DIPLOMATIC

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
STRATEGY TO BRING ABOUT THAT

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
CHANGE IN NORTH KOREA.

274
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
SO FAR, WITHOUT RESULT AS YOU'VE

275
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
JUST DISCUSSED WITH THE MOST

276
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
RECENT MISSILE TEST, BUT FROM

277
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE, THIS

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
MISSILE TEST BY THE NORTH KOREAN

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
IS THE LEAST WELCOMED

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
DEVELOPMENT.

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
IT SENDS A DIRECT SIGNAL TO THE

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
NEWLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF SOUTH

283
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
KOREA LESS THAN A WEEK AGO THAT

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE IN A
BELLIGERENT MOOD.

285
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
FROM CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE IN

286
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
BEIJING, IT WAS A MAJOR GLOBAL

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
CONFERENCE HOSTED HERE YESTERDAY

288
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
ON A BIG INFRASTRUCTURE

289
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
CONFERENCE.

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WHO UPSETS THE PARTY BUT THE GUY

291
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
NEXT DOOR.

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
HE DOESN'T DO A LOT IN TERMS OF

293
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
IMPROVING CHINA'S SENSE OF HUMOR

294
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ABOUT WHAT THE NORTH KOREAN

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
LEADER IS UP TOO.

296
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN

297
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
CALLING FOR EVEN STRONGER

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
SANCTIONS AND EVEN THOUGH THE

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
U.S. IS APPLYING PRESSURE, WE

300
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
HAVE NORTH KOREA WRITING A

301
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
LETTER TO THE CONGRESS

302
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
COMPLAINING ABOUT THESE

303
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
SANCTIONS.

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
>> THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE NORTH

306
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
KOREAN DIPLOMATIC BEHAVIOR HAS A

307
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
HISTORY OF BEING ALL OVER THE

308
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
PLACE.

309
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
SOMETIMES IT IS HARSH.

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING THAT

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ANYONE IN THE UNITED STATES

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
SHOULD TAKE TERRIBLY SERIOUSLY.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS PEOPLE WATCH

313
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
THEIR BEHAVIOR AND THE MISSILE

314
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
TEST IS AN ACTION BY THE NORTH

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
KOREANS WHICH IS BY DEFINITION
BELLIGERENT.

316
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
LET'S NOT GET DISTRACTED FROM

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THE CORE ACTION WHICH IS WHAT IS

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
THE UNITED STATES DOING WITH THE

319
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
CHINESE TO BRING ABOUT

320
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN NORTH

321
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
KOREAN BEHAVIOR?

322
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THE KEY TO THIS, IF THERE IS

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
FURTHER SANCTIONS AND WHETHER

324
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE SUPPLY OF

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
OIL FROM CHINA TO NORTH KOREA.

326
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
THIS IS THE CORE POINT OF

327
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
LEVERAGE.

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
NORTH KOREA DEPENDS ON CHINA OIL

329
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
TO KEEP THEIR ECONOMY RUNNING.

330
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH CHINA

331
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
LEVERAGE WOULD BEGIN TO HAVE AN

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
IMPACT.

333
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
LAURA: I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT

334
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
A REPORT THAT WAS OUT TODAY.

335
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
CONGRESS IS WEIGHING OPTIONS FOR

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
BOLSTERING SANCTIONS AGAINST

337
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
NORTH KOREA BY INCREASING THE

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
MISSILES ON THE WEST COAST.

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
THIS RECENT MISSILE CAME

340
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
60 MILES OFF RUSSIA.

341
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> THESE FALL INTO THREE

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
CATEGORIES.

343
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
SHORT RANGE WHICH CAN WORK FOR

344
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
THEM ACROSS THE PARALLEL WITH

345
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
SOUTH KOREA, MEDIUM RANGE WHICH

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
WOULD AFFECT JAPAN AND AMERICAN

347
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
DEPLOYMENTS IN GUAM, AND

348
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
LONG-RANGE MISSILES OR

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
INTERCONTINENTAL MISSILES WHICH

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
COULD REACH ALASKA AND THE U.S.

351
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
WEST COAST.

352
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE BEEN

353
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
TESTING THE FIRST TWO SETS OF

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
CATEGORIES OF THAT AND THAT IN

355
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
OF ITSELF IS DESTABILIZING.

356
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
THE CORE QUESTION IS, I

357
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
UNDERSTAND THE DEBATE IN THE

358
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
U.S. THAT THERE ARE ANTIMISSILE

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
DEFENSE.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
THAT IS A NORMAL REACTION TO
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS ARE DOING

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
AND IRRATIONAL REASON BUT IF

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
THEY REQUIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
MISSILES, AND THEY ALREADY HAVE

364
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A LARGE NUMBER OF BOMBS, IF THEY

365
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
ARE ABLE TO MILITARIZE THOSE

366
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND HAVE A LARGE

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
STOCK, THE DANGER FOR ALL OF US

368
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000

729
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
THAT IS THE SAME DAY THE

730
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
PRESIDENT WILL HEAD TO SAUDI

731
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
ARABIA KICKING OFF HIS FIRST

732
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
FOREIGN TRIP AS

733
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.

734
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
HE WILL ALSO GO TO ISRAEL AND

735
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
ROME VISITING THE CENTERS OF

736
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY.

737
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
THE TRIP IS SEEN AS A MAJOR

738
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
FOREIGN-POLICY TEST FOR

739
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

740
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
MR. GATES OFFERED THIS ADVICE.

741
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
>> I THINK OF WHEN IT COMES TO

742
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
THE ISSUES, I WOULD ADVISE HIM

743
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
TO STICK TO THE SCRIPT.

744
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
HE IS GOING TO HAVE SOME VERY

745
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AND HE WILL

746
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
TALK ABOUT SOME VERY TOUGH AND

747
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
COMPLICATED ISSUES IN ALL OF THE

748
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
PLACES HE VISITS.

749
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I THINK ANY TIME A PRESIDENT

750
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
DOES THINGS THAT ARE HUMANIZING,

751
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I THINK IT'S GOOD.

752
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
LAURA: LET'S BRING IN EVAN SIG

753
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
FREED, AUTHOR OF GOP, GPS AND

754
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
DOUG, FORMER ADVISOR TO

755
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
PRESIDENT BILL WINTON AND A FOX

756
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
WELCOME.

757
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS

758
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
STAYING ON MESSAGE THING.

759
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
WE HEAR THIS ADVICE FROM GATES

760
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN FROM TIME TO
TIME, THE PRESIDENT HAS A

761
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
TENDENCY TO GO OFF SCRIPT.

762
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
LET'S ASSUME HE DOES STICK TO
THE TALKING POINTS.

763
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
DOUG, WHAT DOES HE NEED TO PROVE
AND HOW DOES HE DO THAT.

764
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
>> HE NEEDS TO PROVE HE IS AN

765
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
AUTHENTIC AND SERIOUS

766
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED

767
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
STATES AND OUR POSITIONS, THAT

768
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
HE CAN ARTICULATE OUR POSITION

769
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH THE
SAUDI'S AND THE ISRAELIS WHO ARE

770
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
WORKING TOGETHER, HE CAN

771
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
ARTICULATE IN EUROPE OUR

772
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
POSITION WITH THE G-7 AND NATO

773
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HE IS

774
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
AUTHENTIC, CREDIBLE, AND

775
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
ASSERTIVE IN STANDING UP FOR OUR

776
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
INTERESTS AND OUR FOREIGN POLICY

777
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
POSITIONS.

778
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
LAURA: EVAN, ANY CONCERNS ON

779
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
YOUR PART OF HYMNS STICKING TO

780
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
THE SCRIPT.

781
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
>> HE DOES GO OFF SCRIPT

782
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
SOMETIMES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

783
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
FOREIGN-POLICY, HE HAS DONE VERY
WELL.

784
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
THE ONLY TIME THAT WAS A CONCERN

785
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
WAS RIGHT AFTER HE WAS ELECTED

786
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
WHERE HE HAD THE CALL WITH
TAIWAN WHICH GREATLY INFURIATED

787
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
THE CHINESE.

788
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
WHEN HE HAS TO AVOID IS DOING

789
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
SOMETHING THAT CAN GIVE

790
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
PERCEPTION TO ANOTHER COUNTRY OR

791
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
ALLY THAT HE IS SMEARING THEM OR

792
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
UPSETTING THEM.

793
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
LAURA: CALL IS SO IMPORTANT WITH

794
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
ALL THIS.
DOUG, TAKING A LOOK AT THE LAST

795
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
TWO PRESIDENTS ON THEIR FIRST

796
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
FOREIGN TRIP, PRESIDENT OBAMA

797
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
WENT TO CANADA IN 2009 AND

798
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
GEORGE W. BUSH TOOK HIS FIRST

799
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
FOREIGN TRIP TO MEXICO IN

800
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
FEBRUARY 2001.

801
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
IT TOOK A FEW EXTRA MONTHS BUT

802
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
THE PRESIDENT IS JUMPING IN,

803
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
GOING OVERSEAS.

804
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
GOOD MOVE?

805
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
BAD MOVE?

806
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
>> I THINK IT'S TH

807
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
THERE IS A NEW AND EMERGING

808
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
ALLIANCE BETWEEN ISRAEL, SAUDI

809
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
AND THE EGYPTIANS AND THAT'S

810
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
IMPORTANT, AND FOR NATO WHICH

811
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED

812
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
OBSOLETE AND REVERSED HIMSELF,

813
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
HE HAS TO REASSURE THEM TO MAKE

814
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
IT CLEAR HE WILL STAND UP

815
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
AGAINST RUSSIA AGGRESSION WHICH

816
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
IS STRONG IN THE BALKANS AND

817
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
EVER PRESENT IN COUNTRIES LIKE

818
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
ESTONIA, LITHUANIA AND LATVIA.

819
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
>> HE IS JUMPING RIGHT IN GOING

820
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
OVERSEAS.

821
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THIS IS A BIG TRIP.

822
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
>> HE HAS ALREADY ASSUAGED THE

823
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
NATO ALLIES WHEN HE MET WITH THE

824
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
SECRETARY GENERAL AT THE WHITE

825
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
HOUSE AND SAID WE ARE HERE AND

826
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
WE ARE A MEMBER AND WE WANT TO

827
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
BE WITH YOU ON THIS.

828
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

829
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
IN ADDITION TO SOLVING THE

830
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
PALESTINE CONFLICT IS THE G-7

831
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
AND NATO MEETINGS.

832
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
WITH NORTH KOREA'S AGGRESSION,
WE NEED TO HAVE ALL OF OUR

833
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
ALLIES ON THE SAME PAGE

834
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
ENCOUNTERING NORTH KOREA AND

835
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
STOPPING THEM FROM BAD BEHAVIOR

836
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
WHICH IS ENDANGERING ASIA AND

837
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

838
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
LAURA: ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE

839
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
BEEN LOOKING AT WITH VISITING

840
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
POPE FRANCIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S

841
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
TRIP AND POPE FRANCIS VIEWS.

842
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
>> I THINK THIS IS A WORK IN
PROGRESS.

843
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
THE PRESIDENT AND THE POPE
COULDN'T HAVE TWO MORE DIVERGENT

844
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
VIEWS.
THAT BEING SAID, FOR THE

845
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

846
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
NOT TO HAVE A HARMONIOUS

847
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POPE.

848
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
[INAUDIBLE]

849
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
>> WE CAN'T ENVISION THE BEING

850
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
COMBATIVE.

851
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
IT WILL BE A DECENT VISIT.

852
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT, ONE OF
HIS STRENGTHS, WHEN HE IS

853
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
ONE-ON-ONE WITH SOMEONE IN A

854
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
ROOM, HE IS MUCH BETTER THAN HE

855
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
IS IN A CROWD.

856
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I THINK POPE FRANCIS, THE TWO OF

857
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
THEM KNOW THEY WILL DISAGREE BUT

858
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I THINK THEY WILL FIND COMMON

859
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
GROUND.
I THINK THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER

860
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
AND HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE

861
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
SO THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER IN THE

862
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
FUTURE TO TACKLE THE MAJOR

863
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD AND HAVE

864
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
AN EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIP.

865
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
LAURA: THIS VISIT KICKS OFF ON

866
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
FRIDAY.

867
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRING

868
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
OF JAMES COMEY AND THE FBI.

869
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

870
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
COMPARISON TO NIXON AND
WATERGATE.

871
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
WE WANT TO BRING IN BOB FROM FOX

872
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
NEWS SUNDAY TALKING ABOUT THAT.

873
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
>> THIS IS NOT WATERGATE.

874
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT

875
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP, AT THIS POINT
WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN

876
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
COLLUSION.

877
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
IN THE CASE OF NIXON, HE HAD HIS

878
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, JOHN

879
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
DEAN, TESTIFY FOR FOUR DAYS THAT

880
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
THE PRESIDENT CORRUPTLY AND

881
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
ILLEGALLY LED THE OBSTRUCTION OF

882
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
JUSTICE.

883
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
YOU HAVE NOTHING COMPARABLE.

884
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
LAURA: DOUG, DO YOU AGREE?

885
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
>> I THINK WITH THE EARLY STAGES

886
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
OF THE RUSSIA, TRUMP POTENTIAL

887
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
COLLUSION ISSUE, THERE ARE LOTS

888
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT GENERAL

889
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
FLYNN DID OR DIDN'T DO, WHO PAUL

890
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
MANAFORT WAS WORKING WITH.
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

891
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
THE REASON I THINK THE FIRING OF

892
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
JAMES COMEY WAS SO UNFORTUNATE,

893
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
WE WERE BEGINNING THE

894
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
INVESTIGATION.

895
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
MORE FUNDS WERE REQUESTED,

896
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
SUBPOENAS HAD GONE OUT FOR

897
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
GENERAL FLYNN'S PAPERS.
I THINK IT IS A MUCH EARLIER

898
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
STAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAN

899
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
THE POINT WOODWARD WAS TALKING

900
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
ABOUT WITH WATERGATE.

901
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
TIME WILL TELL, LAURA.

902
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
LAURA: EVAN, HOW DO YOU SEE IT?
THIS IS A BIG POINT PEOPLE ARE

903
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
MAKING AND GOING BACK IN TIME TO

904
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
MAKE THIS COMPARISON.

905
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING

906
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THE COMPARISON.

907
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR AT THIS

908
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
POINT.
IT'S WAY TOO EARLY IN THE GAME.

909
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

910
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
THE PRESIDENT IS, AS JAMES COMEY

911
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
ADMITTED ON WEDNESDAY, WITHIN

912
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
HIS RIGHT TO FIRE THE FBI

913
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
DIRECTOR AT ANY POINT IN TIME.

914
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
THE SUBSEQUENT MESSAGE FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE HAS GOTTEN THE

915
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
PRESIDENT INTO HOT WATER BECAUSE

916
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
ON TUESDAY NIGHT HIS AIDES WENT
ON TV AND SAID IT'S TIME FOR THE

917
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION TO STOP

918
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
AND ON THURSDAY, HE SAID THE

919
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION PLAYED A
PART IN THAT.

920
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
NOW, IF THE PRESIDENT, I DON'T

921
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
SEE ANYTHING HAPPENING TO THE

922
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
PRESIDENT FOR SAYING THAT.

923
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
HOWEVER, IF JAMES COMEY WERE TO
GO OUT AND SAY YES, THE

924
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
PRESIDENT TRIED TO OBSTRUCT

925
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
JUSTICE AND INTERFERE, THAT'S A

926
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
MAJOR PROBLEM.
AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO

927
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
SEEING REPUBLICANS AND THE

928
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
COUNTRY AS A WHOLE SHOWS VERY

929
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
LITTLE ATTENTION BEING PAID TO

930
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
THIS IN COMPARISON.

931
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
LAURA: THE MILLION-DOLLAR

932
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
QUESTION, HE IS GOING TO PICK A

933
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
NEW PERSON.

934
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
WHAT KIND OF PERSON SHOULD HE
PICK?

935
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
WHO WILL HEAT PICK?

936
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
>> TWO VERY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.

937
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I THINK HE SHOULD PICK SOMEONE

938
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
OF INDEPENDENCE, NO TIES TO

939
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
POLITICS, SOMEONE LIKE RAY

940
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
KELLY, MIKE LEE OF UTAH

941
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
SUGGESTED MERRICK GARLAND, THE

942
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
JUDGE NOMINATED BY THE DEMOCRA

943
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
DEMOCRATS, SOME OF THE LIKE THAT

944
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
WOULD BE IDEAL.

945
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
MY PREDICTION HE WILL PICK JOHN

946
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
CORNYN, THE TEXAS SENATOR WHO

947
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
HAS BEEN A LOYAL DEFENDER OF

948
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGH THE

949
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
WHOLE INVESTIGATION.

950
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
>> DOUG JUST BIT ON THE MERRICK

951
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
HARLAND BAIT BECAUSE AS

952
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
REPUBLICANS WE WOULD ABSOLUTELY

953
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
SUPPORT THAT.

954
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTS SOMEONE WHO

955
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
CAN PASS 100 - 0.

956
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING
MENTIONED ARE ALL VERY QUALIFIED

957
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
AND CAPABLE.

958
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I AGREE WITH DOUG THAT JOHN

959
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
CORNYN WOULD BE A FANTASTIC
PICK.

960
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
HE HAS THE RESPECT OF THE SENATE

961
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND
HE UNDERSTANDS LAW-ENFORCEMENT

962
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
AS WELL AS HOW TO WORK WITH

963
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
CAPITOL HILL AND OTHERS.

964
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
LAURA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
BEING HERE.

965
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
ALWAYS INTERESTING.

966
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
IT WILL BE A VERY BIG WEEK.

967
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
WE WANT TO REMIND YOU TO TURN IN

968
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
LATER FOR JUDGE JEANINE'S

969
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
CONVERSATION WITH TRUMP WHERE HE

970
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
ADDRESSES HIS REMARKS ABOUT

971
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
ENDING LIVE WHITE HOUSE PRESS
BRIEFINGS.

972
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
>> WHEN WE HAVE THOSE PRESS
CONFERENCES, I ACTUALLY SAID WE

973
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BECAUSE

974
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
SARAH HUCKABEE --

975
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
>> FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WE BEEN

976
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
DOING THEM.
>> BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ACTION

977
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
LIKE THIS.
THIS IS CRAZY.

978
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
THERE ARE HIGHER RATINGS ON

979
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
THOSE PRESS CONFERENCES --

980
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
>> WOULD YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER
STOPPING THOSE PRESS

981
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
CONFERENCES.
>> WE WOULD DO IT IN A DIFFERENT

982
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
WAY.

983
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
A PIECE OF TAPE OR WITH A

984
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
PERFECTLY ACCURATE BEAUTIFUL

985
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
ANSWER.

986
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
>> IN WRITING?

987
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
>> THEY ARE ASKED A HUNDRED
QUESTIONS OR 50 QUESTIONS OR 20

988
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
QUESTIONS.

989
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
IF THEY GET ONE OUT OF 50 AND

990
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF, FIVE
OR 10%, THE NEXT DAY IT'S A

991
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
FRONT-PAGE STORY IN EVERY

992
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
NEWSPAPER.

993
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
PRESS CONFERENCES WEREN'T EVEN

994
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
COVERED FOR OBAMA.
THEY WERE ON C-SPAN AND C-SPAN

995
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
TO AND THERE WAS NOTHING GOING

996
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
ON.

997
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
THESE PRESS CONFERENCES LIKE THE

998
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
THING ON DAYTIME TELEVISION.

999
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
THEY'RE BLOWING AWAY EVERYTHING

1000
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
ON DAYTIME TELEVISION.

1001
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO IS STOP

1002
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
THEM.

1003
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
LAURA: SEE THE REST OF THAT

1004
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000

9:00 P.M. EASTERN RIGHT HERE ON

THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

1008

A 39-YEAR-OLD POLITICAL OUTSIDER

1009
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
BECAME THE YOUNGEST PRESIDENT IN
FRENCH HISTORY.

1010
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
WHAT HE VOWED TO DO IN FRONT OF

1011
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
A DIVIDED NATION IN HIS

1012
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
INAUGURATION SPEECH.

1013
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000

THAT STORY, STRAIGHT AHEAD.

1017
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
>> IT'S BETTER TO LIGHT ONE
CANDLE THAN TO CURSE THE

1018
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
DARKNESS.

1019
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000

isn't it time

to let the real you
shine through?

1053
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Introducing Otezla, apremilast.

1054
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Otezla is not an injection

1055
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
or a cream.

1056
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's a pill that treats
plaque psoriasis differently.

1057
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Some people who took Otezla

1058
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
saw 75% clearer skin
after 4 months.

1059
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And Otezla's
prescribing information

1060
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
has no requirement for
routine lab monitoring.

1061
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Don't take Otezla
if you are allergic

1062
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
to any of its ingredients.

1063
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Otezla may increase
the risk of depression.

1064
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Tell your doctor
if you have a history

1065
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
of depression
or suicidal thoughts,

1066
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
or if these feelings develop.

1067
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Some people taking Otezla
reported weight loss.

1068
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Your doctor should
monitor your weight

1069
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and may stop treatment.

1070
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Side effects
may include
diarrhea, nausea,

1071
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
upper respiratory
tract infection,

1072
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
and headache.

1073
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Tell your doctor

1074
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
about all the
medicines you take,

1075
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
and if you're pregnant
or planning to be.

1076
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Ask your dermatologist
about Otezla today.

HAD THIS TO SAY.

1091
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
>> EACH OF THESE OFFICERS WAS

1092
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
MORE THAN JUST A NAME.

1093
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
THEY WERE PERSONS WHO MEANT THE

1094
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
WHOLE WORLD TO SOMEONE, TO A

1095
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
PARENT, SIBLING, SPOUSE OR A

1096
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
CHILD.
WE ALSO REMEMBER THE ZEROS

1097
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
BECAUSE THAT IS OUR WAY OF

1098
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
REPAIRING A DEBT THAT CAN NEVER

1099
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
BE FULLY REPAID.

1100
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
>> 143 OF THE OFFICERS DIED LAST

1101
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
YEAR WHILE THE OTHER 251 DIED

1102
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000

1103
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
LAURA: EMMANUEL MACRON

00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
OFFICIALLY BECOMING THE YOUNGEST

PRESIDENT IN FRENCH HISTORY.

1106
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
VOTERS LOOKING ON AS THE

1107

39-YEAR-OLD IS SWORN IN AND LEFT

THE MESSAGE OF ENCOURAGEMENT IN

1109
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
HIS INAUGURATION SPEECH.

1110
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
>> I AM VERY PROUD TODAY TO

1111
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
PARTICIPATE IN THE INAUGURATION

1112
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
OF EMMANUEL MACRON BECAUSE HE

1113
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
REPRESENTS A HOPE FOR ME.

1114
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
>> I HADN'T VOTED FOR HIM BUT I

1115
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
AM CONFIDENT AND HOPE HE WILL BE

1116
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
A GOOD PRESIDENT.

1117
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
>> THE 39-YEAR-OLD LYRICAL

1118
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
OUTSIDER BOWED TO REFORM THE

1119
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
FRENCH ECONOMY AND TO RESTORE

1120
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
FRANCE'S STANDING IN THE WORLD.

1121
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
EMMANUEL MACRON IS A FOREIGN

1122
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
INVESTMENT BANKER AND ALSO THE

1123
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
FRENCH PRESIDENT ELECTED OUTSIDE

1124
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
THE TWO MAINSTREAM PARTIES.

1125
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
HE IS AN UNAPOLOGETIC SUPPORTER

1126
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WILL

1127
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
MEET WITH CHANCELLOR ANDREA

1128
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
MERKEL MONDAY.

1129
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
THEY WORK TOGETHER TO STABILIZE

1130
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
THE EU AFTER BRITAIN DECIDED TO

1131
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
LEAVE THIS YOU LAST SUMMER.

1132
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
HE IS NO POPULACE.

1133
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
HE PAINTED A PICTURE TODAY OF

1134
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
THE FRENCH ECONOMY THAT WILL
NEED TO EMBRACE AND GROW WITH

1135
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
TECHNOLOGY.

1136
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
IT WILL NEED TO BE OPEN TO THE

1137
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
WORLD.

1138
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
THE MESSAGE TODAY TO THE FRENCH

1139
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
PRESIDENT IS TO EMBRACE THE

1140
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
FUTURE AND EMBRACE IT WITH

1141
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
FRENCH VALUES.

1142
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
>> THE FRENCH PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS

1143
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
KNOWN HOW TO FIND THE ENERGY AND

1144
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
THE SPIRIT OF HOW TO CONFRONT

1145
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
PROFOUND CHANGE.

1146
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
THAT IS WHERE WE STAYE STANFORDS

1147
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
THIS MISSION I WILL HUMBLY SERVE

1148
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
OUR PEOPLE.

1149
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
>> DESPITE BEING ELECTED BY A

1150
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
MASSIVE MAJORITY, DEFEATING

1151
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
MAUREEN LE PEN, HE INHERITS I

1152
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
FRACTURED COUNTRY WITH DEEP

1153
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
DIVISION OVER FRANCE'S ROLE IN

1154
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
EUROPE AND IMMIGRATION.

1155
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
HE WILL HAVE TO FOUR VOTERS

1156
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
AGAIN IN THE COMING WEEKS WITH

1157
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
THE PARLIAMENT TERRY ELECTIONS

1158
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
IN JUNE.

1159
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
>> HIS NEW PARTY WILL NEED TO

1160
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
SCORE A BIG WIN OR HE WILL BE

1161
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
FORCED TO SHARE POWER WITH THE

1162
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
PEOPLE HE HAS REPEATEDLY

1163
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
CRITICIZED.

1164
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
LAURA: THANK YOU.

1165
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

1166
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
MOVING FORWARD ON PLANS TO BUILD

1167
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
THE BORDER WALL AND PROGRESS IS

1168
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
ABOUT TO TAKE A BIG STEP.

1169
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
>> DO NOT WORRY, WE ARE GOING TO

1170
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
BUILD THE WALL.

1171
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
DON'T WORRY.

1172
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT
per roll

1173
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
More "Doing Chores For Dad"
per roll

1174
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
More "Earning Something
You Love" per roll

1175
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Bounty is more absorbent,

1176
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
so the roll can last 50% longer
than the leading ordinary brand.

1177
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So you get more "Life" per roll.

1178
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Bounty, the Quicker Picker Upper

1179
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
LAURA: THE FLOW OF ILLEGAL
IMMIGRANTS INTO THE U.S. HAS

1180
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.

1181
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
THAT IS NOT STOPPING PRESIDENT
TRUMP FROM PUSHING AHEAD WITH

1182
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
HIS SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISES,

1183
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
BUILDING A BORDER WALL.

1184
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS WILL SOON

1185
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
BE ANNOUNCED.

1186
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
WILL CAR JOINS US WITH MORE FROM
L.A.

1187
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
WHERE DO THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW?

1188
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
>> IT APPEARS IT IS ONE STEP

1189
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
CLOSER TO REALITY.

1190
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
THERE IS STILL A BIG QUESTION,
WHO WILL FOOT THE BILL THAT

1191
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
COULD RANGE FROM
20 - $70 BILLION.

1192
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
LAST NIGHT JUDGE JEANINE ASKED

1193
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT HIS PLANS.
LISTEN TO HIS RESPONSE.

1194
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
>> ARE YOU WANT TO BUILD THE

1195
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
WALL.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1196
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
IS THERE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

1197
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

1198
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
>> MORE THAN 600 COMPANIES

1199
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
SIGNED UP TO DESIGN THE WALL.

1200
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
THE FINALISTS, WHICH WILL BE

1201
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
ANNOUNCED SOON, WILL BUILD

1202
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
PROTOTYPES NEAR THE BORDER IN
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

1203
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
ONE COMPANY IS DARTH HOLS PULSE

1204
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
TECHNOLOGY.

1205
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
IT WILL HAVE CONNECTION FIBERS
BUILT IN AND UNDERNEATH.

1206
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
>> WHERE WE CAN'T GET A WALL

1207
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
BUILT DUE TO A TRAIN OR

1208
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
ENVIRONMENTAL REASON, I THINK

1209
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
HAVING SOME SORT OF CENTER IS

1210
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
PART OF THAT PROCESS.

1211
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
>> COOL TECHNOLOGY, BUT AGAIN IT
WILL COME WITH A PRICE.

1212
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
YOU REMEMBER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

1213
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
MAINTAINED MEXICO WILL PAY FOR

1214
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
THE WALL, BUT THE NEIGHBOR TO

1215
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
THE SOUTH CONTINUES TO SAY THAT

1216
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE

1217
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
MENTIONED AT THE TOP THAT BORDER

1218
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
CROSSINGS ARE DOWN.

1219
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
DO WE KNOW WHY?

1220
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
>> BORDER AUTHORITIES ATTRIBUTE

1221
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
THE DROP TO THE SUPPORT THEY ARE

1222
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
RECEIVING FROM THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION AND NEWS COVERAGE

1223
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
OF IMMIGRATION BUS ACROSS THE

1224
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
COUNTRY.
WHEN YOU ADDED UP, THE NUMBERS

1225
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
HAVE DROPPED DRAMATICALLY.

1226
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
>> BACK IN OCTOBER, NOVEMBER,

1227
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
DECEMBER WE HAD BETWEEN

1228
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
750 - 900 PEOPLE A DAY.

1229
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
NOW WE ARE AVERAGING 150, 145 ON

1230
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
A DAILY BASIS.

1231
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
THAT FREES UP BORDER DETENTION

1232
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
CENTERS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HOLD

1233
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THEM FOR COURT DOWN THE LINE

1234
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
WHICH NORMALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN.

1235
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
LAURA: THANK YOU.

1236
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
ONE MAN PROVING YOU ARE NEVER

1237
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
TOO OLD TO PURSUE YOUR DREAM AND

1238
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
BREAK RECORDS WHILE YOU ARE AT

1239
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000

HIS INCREDIBLE FLIGHT HIGH ABOVE

But once a week

1251
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I let her play sheriff

1252

I use Tide to get out
those week old stains

1253
