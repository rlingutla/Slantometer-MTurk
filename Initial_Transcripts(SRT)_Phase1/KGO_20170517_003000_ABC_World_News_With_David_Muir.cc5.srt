TO COMEY, "I HOPE YOU CAN LET

ABC NEWS CONFIRMS PRESIDENT

62
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
TRUMP ALLEGEDLY SUGGESTED FORMER

FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SHUT

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000

MICHAEL FLYNN.

66
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A SOURCE CLOSE TO COMEY TELLS

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ABC NEWS, COMEY WROTE A MEMO IN

68
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
FEBRUARY THE DAY AFTER FLYNN WAS
FIRED.

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS GO, THE

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
PRESIDENT ALLEGEDLY TOLD COMEY.

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, HE IS A

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
GOOD GUY, I HOPE YOU CAN LET

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
THIS GO.

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHO FIRST

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
REPORTED THE MEMO SAYS IT WAS

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
PART OF A PAPER TRAIL COMEY

77
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
WANTED TO LEAVE BEHIND AS

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
EVIDENCE INTO WHAT HE CALLED

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
IMPROPER INFLUENCE INTO HIS

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
INVESTIGATION.
THE TIMES DIDN'T VIEW A COPY OF

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
THAT MEMO.

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
BUT SAYS ASSOCIATES OF COMEY

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
READ IT TO A REPORTER.
TONIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE IS

84
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
DISPUTING THE STORY.

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SAYING IN STATEMENT, THE

86
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
PRESIDENT HAS NEVER ASKED MR.
COMEY OR ANYONE ELSE TO END ANY

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
INVESTIGATION,

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
INCLUDING ANY INVESTIGATION

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
INVOLVING GENERAL FLYNN.

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
THIS IS NOT A TRUTHFUL OR

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF THE

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND MR. COMEY.

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID COMEY WAS
FIRED BECAUSE HE WAS NOT

94
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
COMPETENT, CALLING HIM A

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
SHOWBOAT.

96
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
THIS GALVANIZED MANY IN THE FBI.

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
THE ACTING DIRECTOR COMING TO

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
COMEY'S DEFENSE LAST WEEK.

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
>> IS IT ACCURATE THAT THE RANK

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
AND FILE NO LONGER SUPPORTED

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
DIRECTOR COMEY?

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
>> NO SIR, THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

103
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
>> Reporter: BUT HE ALSO SAID

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
YOU CANNOT STOP THE FBI FROM

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

106
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
>> SO THERE HAS BEEN NO EFFORT

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
TO IMPEDE OUR INVESTIGATION TO

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
DATE.

109
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
>> LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA.

110
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
THE WHITE HOUSE I KNOW IS

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
DENYING THIS.

112
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
BUT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT,

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
IS BASED IN PART LATE TODAY ON

114
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
TWO PEOPLE THEY SAY READ THE
JAMES COMEY MEMO.

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
PART OF A PAPER TRAIL THAT COMEY

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
DOCUMENTED AS THE TIMES PUT IT,
"IMPROPER EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
FLYNN AND RUSSIA."

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> Reporter: AND, DAVID, THE

120
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
TIMES SAID THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS

121
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
MEMO THEMSELVES BUT THEY SOURCED

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THESE TWO PEOPLE THEY SAY THEY

123
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
READ IT.
THE REACTION HAS BEEN POURING

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
IN.

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY TALKING

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY -- RAISING
THE POSSIBILITY OF OBSTRUCTION

127
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
OF JUSTICE.

128
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
THAT'S OF COURSE A FEDERAL

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
CRIME.

130
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
ONE SENATOR SAID THAT WE MAY BE
TALKING ABOUT AN IMPEACHMENT

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
PROCESS.

132
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
DAVID, I WAS JUST SPEAKING WITH

133
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A SOURCE ON CAPITOL HILL.

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
THIS JUST CAME IN, "I DON'T

135
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
THINK WE COULD BE STUNNED

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
ANYMORE GIVEN THE PAST WEEK.

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
THIS BLEW THAT OUT OF THE

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
WATER."
THE SAME REACTION AT THE WHITE

139
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
HOUSE TONIGHT.
>> ANOTHER LONG NIGHT AHEAD FOR

140
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
YOU, CECILIA.

141
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
THOMAS, WHO COVERS THE FBI.

143
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
PIERRE, YOU ACTUALLY CONFIRMED

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THIS EVENING THAT COMEY DID

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
WRITE A MEMO TO DOCUMENT HIS

146
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
INTERACTIONS WITH PRESIDENT

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
TRUMP.
THE SOURCE TOLD YOU THAT THE

148
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLEGEDLY ASKED
HIM TO GO EASY ON FLYNN.

149
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
>> DAVID, THE SOURCE SAID HE'S

150
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
SEEN THE COMEY MEMO, AND HE
CONFIRMED THE QUOTES IN "THE NEW

151
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
YORK TIMES" SPECIFICALLY,

152
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLEGEDLY

153
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
SAYING, I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
GO, HE'S A GOOD GUY.
DAVID, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS A

155
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
LOT OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE

156
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
DEFENSE OF COMEY WHO BELIEVE

157
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
HE'S A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND
HONOR, NOT PERFECT.

158
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BUT A MAN OF INTEGRITY.

159
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
AS FOR THE MOOD AT THE FBI

160
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS AND

161
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
THEY'RE CARRYING ON THEIR WORK.

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE,

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A NUMBER OF FORMER FBI AGENTS I

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
TALKED WITH ARE EXTREMELY ANGRY

165
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
AT THE WAY COMEY WAS FIRED.

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
DAVID.
>> PIERRE THOMAS WITH US

167
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
TONIGHT.
PIERRE, THANK YOU.

168
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
>>> ALL OF THIS COMES AS THE

169
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO SAY

170
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE

171
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
THE PRESIDENT GAVE CLASSIFIED

172
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS.
THAT HEADLINE BROKE LAST NIGHT

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
AS WE CAME ON.

174
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
OUR TEAM COULD HEAR THE YELLING

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
BEHIND THE WALLS OF THE WEST
WING.

176
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY

177
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
REVEALING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

178
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
ABOUT AN ISIS PLOT.
THAT INFORMATION COMING FROM AN

179
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
U.S. ALLY WHO HAD NOT GIVEN

180
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
PERMISSION TO SHARE IT.

181
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
TONIGHT, DID THE PRESIDENT'S

182
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
REVEAL PUT ANY SOURCES ALREADY

183
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
IN HARM'S WAY AT GREATER RISK?

THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND

LAST WEEK.

204
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
THE "WASHINGTON POST" FIRST

205
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000

SECRET INFORMATION, ABC NEWS HAS

211
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
LEARNED, GIVEN TO THE UNITED

212
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000

213
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
LESS THAN TWO HOURS AFTER THE

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
STORY BROKE, THE NATIONAL

215
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
SECURITY ADVISER EMERGED FROM

216
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
THE WEST WING TO SHOOT IT DOWN.

217
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
>> THE STORY THAT CAME OUT
TONIGHT AS REPORTED IS FALSE.

218
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
>> Reporter: THIS MORNING, THE

219
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
PRESIDENT SEEMED TO CONFIRM HE

220
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SHARED SENSITIVE INFORMATION

221
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
WITH THE RUSSIANS, TWEETING --

222
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
"AS PRESIDENT I WANTED TO SHARE

223
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
WITH RUSSIA, AT AN OPENLY

224
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE MEETING,

225
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
WHICH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT

226
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
TO DO, FACTS PRETRAINING TO

227
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
TERRORISM AND AIRLINE FLIGHT

228
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
SAFETY.

229
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
TODAY McMASTER WAS BACK,

230
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
CONFIRMING MANY OF THE DETAILS

231
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
IN THE "POST" STORY AND NOT
DENYING THE INFORMATION SHARED

232
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
WAS CLASSIFIED.

233
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
>> GENERAL, WHEN YOU CAME OUT

234
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AFTER THE STORY BROKE, YOU SAID

235
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT
DISCLOSE ANY SOURCES OR METHODS.

236
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
HE DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT

237
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
MILITARY OPERATIONS.

238
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
WHY WERE YOU DENYING THINGS THAT

239
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
WERE NOT EVEN REPORTED?

240
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
WHAT THE REPORT SAID IS THAT THE

241
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
PRESIDENT REVEALED CLASSIFIED

242
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN SHARED

243
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
BY ONE OF OUR ALLIES IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.

244
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SO THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY A YES

245
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
OR NO QUESTION HERE.

246
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
DID THE PRESIDENT SHARE

247
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH THE

248
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
RUSSIANS IN THAT MEETING?
>> AS I MENTIONED ALREADY, WE

249
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
DON'T SAY WHAT'S CLASSIFIED,

250
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
WHAT'S NOT CLASSIFIED.

251
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
WHAT I WILL TELL YOU AGAIN IS

252
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHARED
WAS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.

253
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
THE STORY COMBINED WHAT WAS

254
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
LEAKED WITH OTHER INFORMATION,

255
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
AND THEN INSINUATED ABOUT

256
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
SOURCES AND METHODS, SO I WANTED

257
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
TO MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYBODY THAT

258
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
THE PRESIDENT IN NO WAY

259
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
COMPROMISED ANY SOURCES OR
METHODS IN THE COURSE OF THIS

260
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
CONVERSATION.

261
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
>> Reporter: THE STORY IS A

262
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
POLITICAL NIGHTMARE FOR THE

263
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY

264
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
BECAUSE, AS A CANDIDATE, DONALD

265
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
TRUMP MADE SUCH AN ISSUE OUT OF

266
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
HILLARY CLINTON'S HANDLING OF

267
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

268
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE IN THE

269
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
OVAL OFFICE WHO DOESN'T

270
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE

271
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
WORD CONFIDENTIAL OR CLASSIFIED.

272
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
>> Reporter: PRESIDENTS HAVE THE

273
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AUTHORITY TO DECLASSIFY

274
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
ANYTHING, THE QUESTION IS, WHY

275
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
HE WOULD SHARE IT WITH AN

276
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ADVERSARY?

277
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
THE WHITE HOUSE INSISTS HE WAS

278
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
SOLICITING RUSSIAN HELP IN THE
FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.

279
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
THE "POST" STORY SUGGESTS TRUMP

280
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
WAS TRYING TO SHOW OFF, QUOTING
HIM TELLING THE RUSSIANS, "I GET

281
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
GREAT INTEL.

282
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I HAVE PEOPLE BRIEF ME ON GREAT

283
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
INTEL EVERY DAY."

284
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
McMASTER SAID THE PRESIDENT

285
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
COULD NOT HAVE TOLD THE RUSSIANS

286
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION

287
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW THE

288
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
SOURCE.

289
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
>> THE PRESIDENT WASN'T EVEN

290
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
AWARE OF WHERE THIS INFORMATION

291
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
CAME FROM.

292
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HE WASN'T BRIEFED ON THE SOURCE

293
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
OR METHOD OF THE INFORMATION

294
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
EITHER.

295
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
>> WASN'T AWARE OF WHERE THE

296
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
INFORMATION CAME FROM.

297
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
JONATHAN KARL LIVE WITH US AS

298
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
WELL.

299
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
YOU WERE IN THAT BRIEFING ROOM.
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY DIDN'T

300
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT THE

301
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
POTENTIAL OF CLASSIFIED

302
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
INFORMATION GIVEN OUT.

303
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE

304
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
BIGGER CONCERN HERE, IN THEIR

305
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
OPINION, IS WHO LEAKED WHAT
HAPPENED.

306
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
JON, THE INITIAL CALL -- THE

307
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
INITIAL CALL OF CONCERN TO THE

308
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
CIA AND THE NSA YOU HAVE

309
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
REPORTED HAS COME FROM WITHIN

310
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
THE WHITE HOUSE.

311
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
>> Reporter: HERE'S WHAT WE

312
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000

316
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD

317
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
SAID, SO, CLEARLY THERE WAS
ENOUGH CONCERN HERE AT THE WHITE

318
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
HOUSE ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT

319
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
REVEALED THAT THEY FELT THEY
NEEDED TO TELL THE CIA AND THE

AND THE IRONY OF THAT IS PRETTY

373
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
ASTOUNDING.

374
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000

RUSSIANS IN OVAL OFFICE, WAS

397
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000

COULD BE THE BIGGEST PLOT TO

TAKE DOWN A PLANE SINCE 9/11.

399
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000

PROVIDING SENSITIVE INFORMATION

AMERICA ON THE CONDITION THE

U.S. KEEP THE SOURCE SECRET.

414
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
>> THE REAL RISK IS NOT JUST
THIS SOURCE, BUT FUTURE SOURCES

415
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
OF INFORMATION ABOUT PLOTS

416
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000

INTELLIGENCE FROM INSIDE ISIS

419
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
INVOLVES AN ACTIVE PLOT TO BRING

420
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
DOWN A PASSENGER JET EN ROUTE TO

421
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
THE U.S., WITH A BOMB HIDDEN IN

422
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A LAPTOP THAT THE U.S. BELIEVES

423
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
CAN GET THROUGH AIRPORT

424
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
SCREENING MACHINES UNDETECTED.

425
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
THE INFORMATION IS SO RELIABLE

426
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
THAT THE U.S. IS CONSIDERING A
BAN ON LAPTOPS ON ALL FLIGHTS

427
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
FROM EUROPE TO THE U.S.

428
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
>> WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THE MOST

429
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
IS THEY WANT TO HAVE A LARGE

430
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
AIRPLANE BLOW UP IN FLIGHT.

431
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
>> Reporter: ISIS HAS ALREADY

432
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
TAKEN CREDIT FOR BLOWING UP A
RUSSIAN AIRLINER TWO YEARS AGO,

433
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
KILLING MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE,

434
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
CLAIMING THE BOMB WAS HIDDEN IN
A SOFT DRINK CAN.

435
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL

436
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
SECURITY ADVISER SAYS THAT

437
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
JUSTIFIES PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DISCLOSURES TO THE RUSSIANS.

438
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
>> THIS WAS THE CONTEXT OF THE

439
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
CONVERSATION IN WHICH IT WAS

440
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WHOLLY APPROPRIATE TO SHARE WHAT

441
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
THE THREAT WAS AS A BASIS FOR

442
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
COMMON ACTION AND COORDINATION.

443
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
>> Reporter: BUT MANY IN THE

COUNTERTERRORISM COMMUNITY SAY

445
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS A

446
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
MISTAKE.

447
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
>> RUSSIA IS NOT PART OF THE
ISIS COALITION.

448
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
THEY ARE NOT OUR PARTNER.

449
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
>> AND BRIAN ROSS WITH US NOW.
BRIAN REPORTED THERE THAT IT'S

450
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000

ALLY, WHO GAVE US THAT

452
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000

LOT OF PEOPLE ARE POINTING TO

THE FACT IF THIS CLASSIFIED

455
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
INFORMATION WAS GIVE ON THE

456
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
RUSSIANS THEY COULD GIVE IT TO

457
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
PLAYERS WHO ARE CLEARLY NOT

458
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
FRIENDS WITH ISRAEL.

459
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT -- DAVID.
INCLUDING IRAN, ALSO A SWORN

460
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
ENEMY OF ISRAEL.

461
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000

TRACTOR-TRAILERS AND THREE
SMALLER VEHICLES.

486
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
THE LEAKING FUEL SPREAD THE FIRE

487
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
TO THE OTHER VEHICLES.
THE FLAMES MOVED OVER THE

488

Then I found Aleve PM.

544
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The only one to combine
a safe sleep aid

545
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000

relieving strength of Aleve.

BACK IN A MOMENT.

623
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
after a DVT blood clot,

624
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I sure had a lot
to think about.

625
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What about the
people I care about?

626
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
...including this little girl.

627
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And what if this
happened again?

628
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I was given warfarin
in the hospital,

629
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
but wondered, was this the
best treatment for me?

630
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So I asked my doctor.

631
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And he recommended ELIQUIS.

632
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots

633
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and reduces the risk of
them happening again.

634
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
and PE blood clots.

635
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
ELIQUIS also had

636
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
significantly
less major
bleeding

637
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
than the
standard
treatment.

638
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Both made me
turn around my
thinking.

639
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't stop ELIQUIS
unless your doctor tells you to.

640
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
ELIQUIS can cause serious and
in rare cases fatal bleeding.

641
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
an artificial heart valve

642
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
or abnormal bleeding.

643
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you had a spinal injection
while on ELIQUIS

644
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
call your doctor right away

645
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
if you have tingling,
numbness, or muscle weakness.

646
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
While taking ELIQUIS,
you may bruise more easily

647
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
...and it may take longer
than usual for bleeding to stop.

648
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Seek immediate medical care
for sudden signs of bleeding,

649
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
like unusual bruising.

650
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
ELIQUIS may increase
your bleeding risk

651
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
if you take
certain medicines.

652
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Tell your doctor
about all planned

653
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
medical or dental
procedures.

654
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
ELIQUIS treats
DVT and PE
blood clots.

655
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Plus had
less major
bleeding.

656
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Both made ELIQUIS
the right treatment for me.

657
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ask your doctor if switching
to ELIQUIS is right for you.

742
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When you have allergies,

743
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
it can seem like triggers
pop up everywhere.

744
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Luckily there's Powerful,
24-hour, non-drowsy Claritin.

745

It provides relief
of symptoms

746

If you've had enough,

755
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
tell your doctor
what you've tried

756
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and how long you've been at it.

757
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
LINZESS works differently
from laxatives.

758
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
LINZESS treats adults with IBS

759
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
with Constipation
or Chronic Constipation.

760
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It can help relieve
your belly pain,

761
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and lets you have more frequent
and complete bowel movements

762
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that are easier to pass.

763
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Do not give LINZESS
to children less than six,

764
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and it should not be given
to children six to less than 18.

765
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It may harm them.

766
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't take LINZESS
if you have a bowel blockage.

767
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Get immediate help
if you develop

768

especially with bloody
or black stools.

770
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The most common side effect
is diarrhea, sometimes severe.

771
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
If it's severe,
stop taking LINZESS

772
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
and call your doctor
right away.

773
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Other side effects include gas,

774
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
