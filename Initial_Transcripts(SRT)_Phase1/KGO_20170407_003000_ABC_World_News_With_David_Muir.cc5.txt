[000:01:37;814] SAYING IN HIS WORDS, SOMETHING
[000:01:39;749] SHOULD HAPPEN.

[000:02:02;071] CORRESPONDENT MARTHA RADDATZ
[000:02:02;672] LEADING US OFF.

[000:02:06;276] TRUMP, WITH HIS STRONGEST WORDS
[000:02:07;377] YET ON THE CRISIS IN SYRIA.
[000:02:10;413] AS THIS PRESIDENT, NOW 77 DAYS
[000:02:13;049] INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, DECIDES
[000:02:14;083] WHETHER TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION.
[000:02:17;687] >> I THINK WHAT ASSAD DID IS
[000:02:18;288] TERRIBLE.
[000:02:20;290] I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA
[000:02:20;924] IS ONE OF THE TRULY EGREGIOUS
[000:02:21;858] CRIMES.
[000:02:25;495] AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
[000:02:27;096] AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
[000:02:27;730] HAPPEN.
[000:02:29;666] >> HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE
[000:02:32;769] RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT
[000:02:33;369] HAPPENED?
[000:02:34;904] >> AT SOME POINT I MAY.
[000:02:36;506] I HAVEN'T, BUT AT SOME POINT I
[000:02:37;507] MAY.
[000:02:39;008] >> DO YOU THINK THAT ASSAD
[000:02:40;577] SHOULD LEAVE POWER IN SYRIA?
[000:02:43;246] >> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN
[000:02:44;214] SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.
[000:02:46;316] AND HE'S THERE AND I GUESS HE'S
[000:02:47;383] RUNNING THINGS, SO SOMETHING
[000:02:50;453] SHOULD HAPPEN.
[000:02:51;487] >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT'S
[000:02:52;555] SECRETARY OF STATE, REX
[000:02:53;056] TILLERSON, A MAN OF FEW WORDS
[000:02:55;658] SINCE TAKING OFFICE, TONIGHT
[000:02:58;261] WITH HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL YET,
[000:02:59;329] FOCUSING ON SYRIA'S PRESIDENT.
[000:03:01;965] >> SIR, DOES ASSAD HAVE TO GO?
[000:03:05;034] >> ASSAD'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE IS
[000:03:12;842] UNCERTAIN CLEARLY, AND WITH THE
[000:03:14;911] ACTS HE HAS TAKEN, IT WOULD SEEM
[000:03:15;545] THERE IS NO ROLE FOR HIM TO
[000:03:16;479] GOVERN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
[000:03:17;513] >> WILL YOU AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:03:19;649] ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL
[000:03:20;183] COALITION TO REMOVE ASSAD?
[000:03:21;184] >> THOSE STEPS ARE UNDER WAY.
[000:03:24;287] >> Reporter: BUT IT WAS JUST ONE
[000:03:25;321] WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:03:26;956] SUGGESTED SOMETHING FAR
[000:03:28;458] DIFFERENT, SAYING THE SYRIAN
[000:03:30;026] PEOPLE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO
[000:03:30;660] GET RID OF ASSAD.
[000:03:33;162] THIS SHIFT COMES JUST 24 HOURS
[000:03:35;198] AFTER THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE
[000:03:37;367] WORLD WATCHING, SAID THOSE
[000:03:38;334] IMAGES OF CHILDREN GASSED HAD
[000:03:39;369] CHANGED HIS MIND.
[000:03:42;538] >> I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
[000:03:44;607] HAPPENED THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD
[000:03:45;642] SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY
[000:03:48;211] MUCH.
[000:03:50;280] I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
[000:03:51;314] ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,
[000:03:52;916] BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
[000:03:53;549] BE TELLING YOU.
[000:03:55;551] >> Reporter: BEFORE HE WAS
[000:03:58;354] PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP HAD LONG
[000:03:58;988] ARGUED AGAINST ACTION IN SYRIA,
[000:04:00;156] REPEATEDLY TWEETING ABOUT IT.
[000:04:02;759] BACK IN 2013, AFTER A CHEMICAL
[000:04:05;361] WEAPONS ATTACK, WHEN PRESIDENT
[000:04:06;963] OBAMA WAS WEIGHING MILITARY
[000:04:09;632] ACTION, TRUMP TWEETING, "DO NOT
[000:04:10;566] ATTACK SYRIA.
[000:04:11;601] IF YOU DO, MANY BAD THINGS WILL
[000:04:12;669] HAPPEN.
[000:04:15;772] AND FROM THAT FIGHT, THE U.S.
[000:04:16;372] GETS NOTHING!"
[000:04:18;908] TONIGHT, HE IS SIGNALING HIS
[000:04:19;509] STANCE HAS CHANGED.
[000:04:22;011] AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN
[000:04:23;046] SUPPORTING SYRIAN LEADER BASHAR
[000:04:26;182] AL ASSAD, SAID TODAY SUPPORT FOR
[000:04:30;320] ASSAD NOT UNCONDITIONAL, BUT
[000:04:31;354] URGING CAUTION.
[000:04:32;455] ON CAPITOL HILL, A LEADING
[000:04:33;456] REPUBLICAN SAID THIS IS A TEST
[000:04:34;090] FOR TRUMP.
[000:04:37;126] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO MAKE A
[000:04:39;162] DECISION THAT'S GOING TO DEFINE
[000:04:40;730] HIS PRESIDENCY ONE WAY OR THE
[000:04:41;798] OTHER.
[000:04:45;935] IF HE DOES NOTHING, THEN IT'S
[000:04:47;036] GOING TO BE OBAMA ON STEROIDS.
[000:04:48;004] >> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT
[000:04:49;105] HASN'T SAID WHAT HE WOULD DO IN
[000:04:49;739] SYRIA, BUT THERE ARE MANY
[000:04:50;606] MILITARY OPTIONS.
[000:04:51;641] HIT SYRIAN AIRFIELDS TO GROUND
[000:04:55;311] ASSAD'S AIR FORCE.
[000:04:56;879] GO AFTER MILITARY TARGETS SUCH
[000:04:58;414] AS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.
[000:04:59;048] WHAT COULD WE USE?
[000:05:01;017] SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILES OR
[000:05:01;617] U.S.-MANNED AIRCRAFT.
[000:05:03;653] RISKIER BUT WE HAVE HIGHLY
[000:05:06;756] SOPHISTICATED WARPLANES.
[000:05:08;825] >> AND MARTHA JOINS ME NOW.
[000:05:12;228] MARTHA WE KNOW
[000:05:12;562] THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEFENSE
[000:05:13;162] SECRETARY ARE NOW TOGETHER.
[000:05:13;796] HE'S BEING BRIEFED ON THE
[000:05:14;330] POTENTIAL OPTIONS.
[000:05:16;399] WE LEARNED THAT THE AIRCRAFT
[000:05:17;433] THAT DROPPED THE CHEMICAL
[000:05:18;468] WEAPONS WAS IN FACT A SYRIAN
[000:05:19;068] MILITARY AIRCRAFT.
[000:05:26;376] >> THEY SAY THERE'S NO QUESTION
[000:05:28;011] IT WAS A SYRIAN MILITARY
[000:05:29;512] AIRCRAFT.
[000:05:30;313] WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE EQUIPMENT
[000:05:31;848] THERE OVER SYRIA NOW THEY COULD
[000:05:32;882] ACTUALLY WATCH, GO BACK AND SEE
[000:05:33;983] WHAT KIND OF AIRCRAFT DROPPED
[000:05:34;951] THOSE MUNITIONS.
[000:05:37;487] >> WE HAVE MORE EQUIPMENT THERE.
[000:05:41;357] MARTHA, AS YOU BEEN REPORTING WE
[000:05:42;425] HAVE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS THERE
[000:05:43;459] IN RECENT WEEKS, WE LEARNED OF
[000:05:44;093] HUNDREDS BEING SENT INTO SYRIA.
[000:05:45;061] >> WE DO, DAVID, AND THAT'S A
[000:05:45;661] REAL CONCERN.
[000:05:46;596] IF MILITARY ACTION IS TAKEN
[000:05:49;699] THERE WILL BE A WARNING TO
[000:05:50;800] ASSAD -- DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR
[000:05:53;870] THOSE AMERICAN TROOPS, DO NOT
[000:05:54;871] TARGET THEM, BUT THERE'S A RISK.
[000:05:55;505] >> MARTHA, THANK YOU.
[000:06:00;610] >>> AND AS YOU HEARD MARTHA
[000:06:05;281] REPORT, ANY ACTION IF TAKEN
[000:06:05;848] COMES WITH GREAT RISK.
[000:06:06;849] OBAMA WEIGHED MILITARY ACTION
[000:06:07;884] BEFORE.
[000:06:08;418] NOW, RUSSIANS ARE INVOLVED AND
[000:06:09;218] AMERICAN TROOPS ARE THERE.
[000:06:12;288] WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE TARGET?
[000:06:16;392] AND WHAT ARE THE GREATEST RISKS?
[000:06:17;026] HERE'S BRIAN ROSS.
[000:06:20;029] >> Reporter: FOR THE U.S.
[000:06:21;064] MILITARY TONIGHT, AMONG THE
[000:06:22;165] OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED ARE THE
[000:06:24;200] VERY PLANS THE PENTAGON PLANNED
[000:06:25;768] FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN A PRIME
[000:06:26;369] TARGET WAS THE SPECIFIC MILITARY
[000:06:27;437] UNIT THAT GUARDED AND DEPLOYED
[000:06:32;775] SYRIA'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
[000:06:33;876] UNIT 450, OF THE SYRIAN AIR
[000:06:34;444] FORCE.
[000:06:35;411] >> IF YOU ARE GOING TO STRIKE IN
[000:06:36;045] A WAY THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED
[000:06:38;181] TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE, YOU'D
[000:06:39;582] HAVE TO HIT SOME PART OF UNIT
[000:06:40;650] 450.
[000:06:43;719] >> Reporter: THE HORRIFIC IMAGES
[000:06:44;353] THIS WEEK FROM SYRIA PUT A LIE
[000:06:47;924] TO THE SYRIAN AND USA CLAIMS
[000:06:48;991] THAT THE COUNTRY'S STOCKPILE OF
[000:06:52;095] SARIN GAS AND OTHER CHEMICAL
[000:06:52;695] WEAPONS HAD BEEN DESTROYED.
[000:06:54;664] BUT EVEN WITH A DIMINISHED
[000:06:55;698] SUPPLY, A DIRECT STRIKE ON
[000:06:58;301] WHATEVER CHEMICAL WEAPONS REMAIN
[000:06:59;335] STILL RUNS A SERIOUS RISK.
[000:07:01;437] >> IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIT THEM,
[000:07:02;472] IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO BLOW
[000:07:05;074] THEM UP, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GOING
[000:07:07;176] TO CREATE AGENT PLUMES, WHICH
[000:07:08;211] ARE GOING TO DAMAGE, YOU KNOW,
[000:07:08;845] CIVILIAN AREAS.
[000:07:11;347] >> Reporter: THE U.S. ATTACK
[000:07:12;381] PLAN IN 2013 INCLUDED SYRIAN
[000:07:13;916] AIRFIELDS, TANK DEPOTS AND EVEN
[000:07:15;985] THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN
[000:07:16;552] DOWNTOWN DAMASCUS.
[000:07:19;122] >> THEY CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH A
[000:07:21;724] TEN-FOOT BLOCK OF THAT BUILDING,
[000:07:23;259] SO RIGHT INTO A PARTICULAR
[000:07:24;360] OFFICE.
[000:07:25;895] >> Reporter: BUT ANY ATTACK NOW
[000:07:27;430] COULD BE LESS SWEEPING BECAUSE
[000:07:28;064] OF THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN
[000:07:30;566] SOLDIERS AND ADVISERS ACROSS
[000:07:31;167] SYRIAN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.
[000:07:36;305] ALONG WITH ADVANCED RUSSIAN
[000:07:38;508] ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSE SYSTEMS.
[000:07:39;509] >> LET'S BRING IN BRIAN ROSS.
[000:07:44;180] BRIAN, WE SHOULD CAUTION, WE
[000:07:45;815] DON'T KNOW ANY ACTION IF ANY AT
[000:07:46;816] ALL IS GOING TO BE TAKEN
[000:07:47;850] TONIGHT.
[000:07:50;486] BUT WE HEARD THOSE WORDS JUST 24
[000:07:51;487] HOURS AGO FROM THE U.S.
[000:07:52;555] AMBASSADOR, NIKKI HALEY ASKING
[000:07:56;159] HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE TO
[000:07:56;792] DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?
[000:07:58;361] THOSE WERE STRONG WORDS.
[000:07:59;996] AIMED AT RUSSIA, VLADIMIR PUTIN.
[000:08:01;731] WE HAVEN'T HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP
[000:08:04;200] ADDRESS PUTIN IN THAT WAY.
[000:08:05;234] IS THAT A TEST OF THAT
[000:08:05;768] RELATIONSHIP TOO?
[000:08:06;802] >> IN FACT, THE WORLD IS
[000:08:07;870] WATCHING TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT
[000:08:08;905] IS NOW PREPARED TO CHALLENGE
[000:08:09;939] RUSSIA AND ITS LEADER WHO HE HAS
[000:08:10;573] PRAISED SO MUCH, VLADIMIR PUTIN.
[000:08:13;576] >> BRIAN, THANK YOU.
[000:08:16;279] >>> AND AS WE KNOW,

[000:08:25;621] PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTED TO TALK
[000:08:26;255] ABOUT NORTH KOREA WITH HIM.
[000:08:27;256] PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVING JUST
[000:08:31;928] SAID THAT, IF CHINA DOESN'T FIX
[000:08:32;562] THE NORTH KOREAN ISSUE, THE U.S.
[000:08:33;196] WILL.

[000:09:02;258] ABOUT BOTH TRADE, NORTH KOREA
[000:09:02;858] AND MANY OTHER THINGS.
[000:09:03;826] >> Reporter: THROUGHOUT HIS
[000:09:04;427] CAMPAIGN, TRUMP HAD HARSH WORDS
[000:09:06;362] FOR CHINA.
[000:09:06;629] >> WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO ALLOW
[000:09:07;463] CHINA TO RAPE OUR COUNTRY AND
[000:09:08;064] THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
[000:09:09;031] THEY'RE TAKING OUR BUSINESS.
[000:09:10;066] THEY'RE TAKING OUR JOBS.
[000:09:11;634] THEY'RE MAKING OUR PRODUCT.
[000:09:14;237] CHINA'S WONDERFUL, BUT THEY'RE
[000:09:15;304] GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER.
[000:09:18;407] >> Reporter: BUT NOW TRUMP NEEDS
[000:09:19;442] CHINA TO TURN UP THE HEAT ON
[000:09:20;042] NORTH KOREA.
[000:09:21;544] JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO TWEETING,

[000:09:23;679] BADLY.
[000:09:25;681] CHINA HAS DONE LITTLE TO HELP!"
