[000:00:07;13] THAT IS IT FOR THIS  
[000:00:08;24] "SPECIAL REPORT," FAIR,  
[000:00:09;29] BALANCED AND STILL  
[000:00:11;04] UNAFRAID.

[000:00:46;15] FACE JUSTICE IN HONG KONG.  
[000:00:48;05] >> I THINK THE U.S.  
[000:00:49;09] GOVERNMENT WILL GO AFTER  
[000:00:51;12] HIM.  
[000:00:51;25] >> Shepard: AND LAWMAKERS  
[000:00:52;18] GET A CHANCE TO QUESTION  
[000:00:53;11] THE HEAD OF THE NSA.  
[000:00:54;15] >> THE NSA OBTAINED PHONE  
[000:00:56;11] RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF  
[000:00:58;20] INNOCENT AMERICANS WITH NO  
[000:01:00;08] CONNECTION TO TERRORISM.  
[000:01:02;25] >> IF DOZEN OF TERRORIST  
[000:01:04;20] EVENTS THAT THESE ARE  
[000:01:06;23] HELPED PREVENT.  
[000:01:11;05] >> Shepard: PLUS, THE  
[000:01:11;27] LITTLE GIRL WHO WON HER  
[000:01:13;12] FIGHT FOR AN ADULT LUNG  
[000:01:15;08] TRANSPLANT FINALLY GETS THE  
[000:01:16;15] SURGERY THAT COULD SAVE HER  
[000:01:17;25] LIFE.  
[000:01:20;09] BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS  
[000:01:21;19] WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THE NSA  
[000:01:23;16] LEAKER HAS APPARENTLY  
[000:01:25;29] RESURFACED.  
[000:01:26;15] SOMEWHERE IN HONG KONG ED  
[000:01:28;03] SNOWDEN REPORTEDLY SPOKE  
[000:01:29;03] WITH THE SOUTH CHINA  
[000:01:30;19] MORNING POST NEWSPAPER  
[000:01:31;16] TODAY AND CLAIMS THE UNITED  
[000:01:33;04] STATES HAS BEEN HACKING  
[000:01:34;26] CHINA'S COMPUTERS FOR  
[000:01:36;02] YEARS.  
[000:01:36;25] HE SAYS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  
[000:01:38;12] HAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF  
[000:01:40;08] SPY OPERATIONS GOING ON  
[000:01:41;10] AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,  
[000:01:44;16] 61000 TO BE EXACT.  
[000:01:45;27] AND JUST HOURS AFTER THE  
[000:01:48;03] NEW SNOWDEN INTERVIEW  
[000:01:49;11] POPPED UP IN THE PAPER, THE  
[000:01:50;20] HEAD OF THE SECRETIVE  
[000:01:52;17] NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY  
[000:01:53;24] TESTIFIED ON CAPITOL HILL.  
[000:01:54;23] GENERAL KEITH ALEXANDER  
[000:01:56;14] SAYS GOVERNMENT  
[000:01:57;02] SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS HAVE  
[000:01:58;04] HELPED PREVENT DOZENS OF  
[000:01:59;20] TERROR ATTACKS.  
[000:02:00;14] THE SENATORS DID NOT OBJECT  
[000:02:01;20] TO MONITORING SPECIFIC  
[000:02:02;23] TERRORIST SUSPECTS.  
[000:02:03;17] SOME DID ASK WHY IS THE  
[000:02:05;28] GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING THE  
[000:02:07;13] PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS  
[000:02:08;21] OF INNOCENT AMERICANS?  
[000:02:09;28] >> IF YOU KNEW THAT A  
[000:02:11;04] SUSPECT HAD MADE A CALL  
[000:02:12;21] INTO AREA CODE 312, THE  
[000:02:15;04] CITY OF CHICAGO, IT  
[000:02:17;27] CERTAINLY DEFIES LOGIC THAT  
[000:02:19;06] YOU NEED TO COLLECT AWFUL  
[000:02:20;07] OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS MADE  
[000:02:21;18] IN THE 312 AREA CODE ON THE  
[000:02:23;19] CHANCE THAT ONE OF THOSE  
[000:02:24;23] PERSONS MIGHT BE ON THE  
[000:02:25;20] OTHER END OF THE PHONE.  
[000:02:26;22] >> SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU  
[000:02:27;24] DON'T KNOW HE IS IN 312  
[000:02:30;15] YET?  
[000:02:30;28] BECAUSE WE HAD STORED THAT  
[000:02:31;23] DATA IN A DATABASE WE  
[000:02:34;08] COULD TAKE THAT NUMBER AND  
[000:02:35;09] GO BACKWARDS IN TIME AND  
[000:02:36;24] SEE WHO HE WAS TALKING TO.  
[000:02:40;09] >> Shepard: GENERAL  
[000:02:40;29] ALEXANDER SAYS HE WANTS TO  
[000:02:42;05] DECLASSIFY SOME OF THE  
[000:02:42;27] INFORMATION SO HE CAN TELL  
[000:02:45;02] ALL THE US ABOUT HOW THE  
[000:02:46;05] SURVEILLANCE WORKS.  
[000:02:46;26] HE SAYS IF THE GOVERNMENT  
[000:02:48;04] RELEASES TOO MANY DETAILS,  
[000:02:50;10] QUOTE:  AMERICANS WILL DIE.  
[000:02:51;22] LOTS TO COVER ON THIS.  
[000:02:52;27] SO TEAM FOX COVERAGE, TRACE

[000:03:03;00] >> SHEP, WHILE INTELLIGENCE  
[000:03:04;26] COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP AND  
[000:03:05;20] OFFICIALS CLAIM THE  
[000:03:06;12] SWEEPING COLLECTION OF DATA  
[000:03:07;29] DISRUPTED A 2009 PLOT  
[000:03:09;28] TARGETING THE NEW YORK CITY  
[000:03:10;29] SUBWAY SYSTEM BY BULL AZAZI  
[000:03:16;03] CONCEDED TO PATRICK LEAHY  
[000:03:17;18] THAT WAS SIMPLY NOT THE  
[000:03:19;00] CASE.  
[000:03:19;13] THE LEAD CAME FROM FOREIGN  
[000:03:20;26] SOURCES.  
[000:03:22;08] >> WITH A 702 SET OF  
[000:03:26;15] INFORMATION, BASED ON  
[000:03:28;11] OPERATIVES OVERSEAS WE SAW  
[000:03:31;07] CONNECTIONS INTO A PERSON  
[000:03:32;27] IN COLORADO.  
[000:03:33;19] THAT WAS PASSED TO THE FBI.  
[000:03:36;15] >> AND WHILE ALEXANDER SAID  
[000:03:38;11] THE DRILLDOWN ON AMERICAN  
[000:03:39;22] CITIZENS MUST BE CLEARED BY  
[000:03:41;06] A NATIONAL SECURITY COURT,  
[000:03:42;19] SENATORS SAYING IT WASN'T  
[000:03:43;28] ENOUGH GIVEN THE PERVASIVE  
[000:03:46;01] ENVIRONMENT OF MISTRUST.  
[000:03:47;03] >> THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS  
[000:03:50;04] FEARFUL THAT IN THIS  
[000:03:52;08] MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA YOU  
[000:03:54;15] GET, THAT THERE IS THE  
[000:03:56;25] ABILITY OF THE FEDERAL  
[000:03:57;27] GOVERNMENT TO SYNTHESIZE  
[000:04:00;29] THAT DATA AND LEARN  
[000:04:04;24] SOMETHING MORE.

[000:04:18;23] DIRECTOR OF THE CIA  
[000:04:20;25] RESIGNED.  
[000:04:21;10] >> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.  
[000:04:23;04] MIKE MORELL AFTER 33 YEARS  
[000:04:28;05] WITH THE AGENCY.  
[000:04:29;23] IT WAS MADE SOME TIME AGO.  
[000:04:31;10] HE WAS CENTER HE OF THE  
[000:04:32;22] TALKING POINTS CONTROVERSY.  
[000:04:34;01] THE ADMINISTRATION  
[000:04:34;26] ULTIMATELY BLAMED THE CIA  
[000:04:36;07] FOR PROVIDING BAD  
[000:04:37;13] INFORMATION TO THEN  
[000:04:38;08] AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE WHO  
[000:04:39;14] BLAMED A DEMONSTRATION THAT  
[000:04:40;20] SPUN OUT OF CONTROL FOR THE

[000:04:43;04] MORE RELATIVE'S MORRELL'S

[000:04:56;12] ADVISOR TO THE NATIONAL  
[000:04:57;06] SECURITY COUNCIL.  
[000:04:58;00] THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT  
[000:05:00;02] MORRELL'S RESIGNATION IS  
[000:05:00;26] NOT AT ALL CONNECTED TO  
[000:05:02;08] THESE NSA SCANDALS, SHEP.

[000:05:19;21] JUDGE TO EVEN THE  
[000:05:21;08] PRESIDENT.

[000:05:22;09] I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DO  
[000:05:24;08] THAT.  
[000:05:24;21] >> Shepard: WELL NOW AS I  
[000:05:25;15] REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS  
[000:05:26;17] NEWSCAST ED SNOWDEN IS  
[000:05:28;16] APPARENTLY MAKING NEW  
[000:05:30;09] CLAIMS ABOUT THE U.S.  
[000:05:31;16] ATTACKING CHINESE  
[000:05:33;11] COMPUTERS.  
[000:05:34;13] QUOTING:  WE HACK NETWORK  
[000:05:35;29] BACK BONES LIKE HUGE  
[000:05:38;21] INTERNET ROUTERS THAT GIVE  
[000:05:40;14] US ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF  
[000:05:42;16] THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS  
[000:05:43;09] WITHOUT HAVING TO HACK  
[000:05:44;29] EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.  
[000:05:46;04] ED SNOWDEN SAYS HUNDREDS OF  
[000:05:48;14] THOSE HACKING TARGETS ARE  
[000:05:49;19] IN HONG KONG AND CHINA'S  
[000:05:51;28] MAINLAND INCLUDING  
[000:05:52;19] UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND  
[000:05:53;12] PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

[000:06:02;13] COVERAGE WITH TRACE  
[000:06:03;12] GALLAGHER IN OUR WEST COAST  
[000:06:04;23] NEWS HUB.  
[000:06:05;13] DOES HE EXPLAIN WHY HE  
[000:06:06;25] ACCUSED THE UNITED STATES  
[000:06:07;19] OF TARGETING COMPUTERS ALL  
[000:06:08;19] OVER THE WORLD?  
[000:06:09;11] >> WELL BECAUSE HE SAYS  
[000:06:10;16] THAT AMERICA HAS LONG SAID  
[000:06:11;28] THAT IT DOES NOT TARGET  
[000:06:13;24] CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE  
[000:06:14;18] UNLIKE ITS ADVERSARIES,  
[000:06:16;16] SHEP.  
[000:06:16;29] HE CALLS THAT BLATANT  
[000:06:18;18] HYPOCRISY SAYING AND I'M  
[000:06:19;27] QUOTING HERE, NOT ONLY DOES  
[000:06:21;22] IT DO SO BUT IT IS SO  
[000:06:23;03] AFRAID OF IT BEING KNOWN  
[000:06:24;28] THAT IT IS WILLING TO USE  
[000:06:26;05] ANY MEANS SUCH AS  
[000:06:27;27] DIPLOMATIC INTIMIDATION TO  
[000:06:29;12] PREVENT THIS INFORMATION  
[000:06:30;06] FROM BECOMING PUBLIC MUCH  
[000:06:31;01] THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS  
[000:06:32;14] ASKED TODAY ABOUT TARGETING  
[000:06:34;17] FOREIGN COMPUTERS AND  
[000:06:35;11] RESPONDED THIS WAY.  
[000:06:36;11] LISTEN.  
[000:06:37;07] >> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE  
[000:06:39;19] BETWEEN, YOU KNOW GOING  
[000:06:42;06] AFTER ECONOMIC DATA AND  
[000:06:44;19] FINANCIAL INFORMATION, THAT  
[000:06:45;18] IS PART OF THE CYBER  
[000:06:48;15] ATTACKS.  
[000:06:49;09] OR SEEMS TO BE.  
[000:06:50;24] AND AN ISSUE WHICH THE  
[000:06:53;07] PRESIDENT WELCOMES THE  
[000:06:54;08] DEBATE ON AND THE  
[000:06:55;17] ADMINISTRATION HAS WELCOMED  
[000:06:56;26] THE DEBATE ON WHICH IS  
[000:06:58;29] SURVEILLANCE.  
[000:06:59;16] AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO  
[000:07:01;08] MEAN TO DO HARM.  
[000:07:04;16] >>  
[000:07:04;27] >> SO HER RESPONSE WASN'T  
[000:07:07;10] EXACTLY CRYSTAL CLEAR  
[000:07:08;18] SHEP.  
[000:07:09;01] EVEN EDWARD SNOWDEN ADMITS  
[000:07:10;08] HE HAS NO INFORMATION AT  
[000:07:11;17] ALL ABOUT ANY CHINESE  
[000:07:12;27] MILITARY TECHNOLOGY.  
[000:07:14;22] SHEP?  
[000:07:15;05] >> Shepard: HE SAYS THAT HE  
[000:07:15;29] CAN LEAVE HONG KONG ANY  
[000:07:16;25] TIME HE WANTS TO.  
[000:07:17;21] >> YEAH, HE SAID HE HAD  
[000:07:19;00] MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FLEE  
[000:07:20;08] BUT, INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO  
[000:07:21;26] STAY AND FIGHT.  
[000:07:22;27] AND IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH  
[000:07:23;22] THE CHINESE NEWSPAPER HE  
[000:07:24;19] IS CLEARLY TRYING TO PAINT  
[000:07:26;07] HIMSELF AS THE GOOD GUY  
[000:07:27;23] HERE.  
[000:07:28;06] SAYING TO THE NEWSPAPER,  
[000:07:28;29] AND I'M QUOTING AGAIN:   
[000:07:30;27] LAST WEEK THE AMERICAN  
[000:07:31;25] GOVERNMENT HAPPILY OPERATED  
[000:07:32;27] IN THE SHADOWS WITH NO  
[000:07:34;21] RESPECT FOR THE CONSENT OF  
[000:07:36;23] THE GOVERNED.  
[000:07:37;18] BUT NO LONGER.  
[000:07:38;25] EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY IS  
[000:07:40;20] DEMANDINGLITY  
[000:07:42;01] AND OVERSIGHT.  
[000:07:43;04] FOR NOW, HE IS STILL IN  
[000:07:44;25] HIDING BUT FORMER CIA AGENT  
[000:07:47;01] MIKE BAKER SAYS NOT FOR  
[000:07:48;18] LONG.  
[000:07:49;20] >> EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS  
[000:07:51;07] TRAINED.  
[000:07:51;21] EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS  
[000:07:52;15] BEEN IN OPERATIONS FOR A  
[000:07:53;12] LONG TIME, JUST  
[000:07:55;00] DISAPPEARING, GOING OFF THE  
[000:07:56;05] RADAR SCREEN ENTIRELY IS A  
[000:07:58;23] VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.  
[000:08:00;06] IT'S MORE DIFFICULT WHEN  
[000:08:01;18] YOU NOW HAVE BEEN IN THE  
[000:08:02;26] MEDIA AND EVERYBODY KNOWS  
[000:08:03;29] YOUR FACE AND YOUR  
[000:08:05;09] BACKGROUND STORY.  
[000:08:08;22] MIKE BAKER ALSO BELIEVES AS  
[000:08:09;24] SOON AS THE UNITED STATES  
[000:08:11;11] WANTS HIM THEY WILL GET  
[000:08:12;23] HIM.

[000:09:37;14] I KISSED HER GOOD BY.  
[000:09:38;16] IT WAS EASIER WAY TO SAY  
[000:09:40;15] GOODBYE TO HER THAN IF SHE  
[000:09:41;28] WERE AWAKE AND SCARED.

[000:22:17;14] SCAFFOLDING COMPANY BUT HE  
[000:22:18;10] COULD NOT CONFIRM WHETHER  
[000:22:19;11] THEY WERE WINDOW WASHERS.

[000:24:35;19] BUT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.  
[000:24:40;06] >> WHAT'S BEEN REALLY  
[000:24:41;21] FRUSTRATING FOR SOME FOLKS  
[000:24:42;17] IS THE MAIN EVACUATION  
[000:24:44;19] CENTER WHERE ALL THOSE  
[000:24:45;16] DISPLACED FAMILIES WERE

[000:25:10;17] THE WHEEL.  
[000:25:11;19] OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD BE  
[000:25:13;06] MORE DANGEROUS THAN  
[000:25:14;08] ACTUALLY TALKING ON A CELL  
[000:25:16;03] PHONE.  
[000:25:16;16] AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO  
[000:25:18;09] SEE THIS?

[000:25:21;09] YOUR BOAT:  THAT'SAS WE APPROACH THE
[000:25:24;18] BOTTOM OF THE HOUR AND THE  
[000:25:25;19] TOP OF THEÑi NEWS.

[000:25:50;09] OD. HELPING THE WORLD KEEP PROMISES.
[000:28:00;07] VO: I've always thought the best part
[000:28:00;27] about this country
[000:28:03;16] is that we get to create our future.
[000:28:08;09] You get to take ownership of the choices
[000:28:09;00] you make.
[000:28:13;17] The person you become.
[000:28:16;05] I've been around long enough to recognize
[000:28:16;27] the people who are out there owning
[000:28:17;15] it.
[000:28:24;00] The ones getting involved and staying
[000:28:24;21] engaged.
[000:28:31;01] They're not sitting by as their life
[000:28:31;21] unfolds.
[000:28:35;05] And they're not afraid to question
[000:28:35;24] the path they're on.
[000:28:38;11] Because the one question they never
[000:28:39;00] want to ask is
[000:28:42;03] "How did I end up here?"
[000:28:45;05] I started Schwab for those people.
[000:28:47;11] People who want to take ownership
[000:28:48;00] of their investments
[000:28:50;11] like they do in every other aspect
[000:28:51;00] of their lives.
[000:29:05;01] >> Shepard: SO THEY ARE NOT  
[000:29:06;26] GOING TO NEED A BIGGER BOAT  
[000:29:07;20] JUST MINOR REPAIRS.  
[000:29:09;09] FISHERMEN LOOKING FOR MAKE

[000:29:37;04] 300 POUNDS.  
[000:29:38;05] I'M SHERT THIS IS  
[000:29:53;08] REFERENDUM.  
[000:29:53;24] A VOTE TO TURN PLANS INTO A  
[000:29:55;22] WILL MATCHETT SPARKS TWO  
[000:29:56;18] WEEKS OF DEMONSTRATIONS IN  
[000:29:57;25] WHICH FOUR PEOPLE HAVE  
[000:30:00;11] REPORTEDLY DIED.

[000:30:20;28] HAVING IT.  
[000:30:27;02] RIOT.  
[000:30:34;19] BEFORE THE VIOLENCE STARTED  
[000:30:36;00] TWO WEEKS AGO.  
[000:30:36;22] >> I'M TERRIBLY ANGRY  
[000:30:39;13] BECAUSE THIS IS AGAINST  
[000:30:40;05] HUMAN RIGHTS.  
[000:30:41;09] >> MANY TOLD STORIES FROM  
[000:30:43;07] TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN  
[000:30:45;09] DEMONSTRATORS VOLUMES OF  
[000:30:46;07] TEAR GAS AND RUBBER BULLETS  
[000:30:48;29] ARE BONFIRES.  
[000:30:50;06] TURKISH MINISTER MOST OF  
[000:30:52;13] THE DEMONSTRATORS ARE.  
[000:30:55;21] THEY ARE SINCERE.  
[000:30:58;18] THEY HAVE GOOD WELL  
[000:31:01;28] INTENTIONS BUT CREATE  
[000:31:06;22] PSYCHOLOGY OF FEAR.  
[000:31:08;11] THERE.  
[000:31:08;24] >> THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF  
[000:31:10;06] PEOPLE NOW STREAMING HERE  
[000:31:11;10] INTO THIS AREA, THEY ARE  
[000:31:12;07] PREPARED NOT ONLY FOR THE  
[000:31:13;04] RAIN BUT ALSO FOR THE TEAR  
[000:31:14;13] GAS.

[000:31:20;06] HARD HATS THAT THEY HAVE TO  
[000:31:21;08] PROTECT AGAINST THE ROCK  
[000:31:22;08] AND RUBBER BULLETS THAT  
[000:31:23;03] WILL COME LATER.  
[000:31:24;10] >> WE ARE NOT MARGINAL.  
[000:31:25;23] NOT TERRORISTS, WE ARE JUST  
[000:31:28;05] LIVING IN THIS NORMAL  
[000:31:31;23] PEOPLE.  
[000:31:32;07] JUST DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS.  
[000:31:33;03] >> WELL THE UNREST IN  
[000:31:34;24] TURKEY COULD HAVE A BIG  
[000:31:36;09] IMPACT ON THE CRISIS NEXT  
[000:31:37;11] DOOR IN SYRIA.  
[000:31:38;28] TURKEY'S PRIME MINISTER IS  
[000:31:39;22] A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE  
[000:31:41;10] SYRIAN REBEL.  
[000:31:41;28] AND ANALYSTS SAY GOVERNMENT  
[000:31:45;18] RESPONSE COULD VERY MUCH  
[000:31:48;11] COMPLICATE PRESIDENT OBAMA  
[000:31:49;10] IN CIVIL WAR.  
[000:31:50;00] FOR THAT ANGLE WE TURN TO  
[000:31:52;25] THE JONATHAN HUNT LIVE IN  
[000:31:53;22] NEW YORK TONIGHT.  
[000:31:54;27] JONATHAN DIFFICULT LINE  
[000:31:55;23] FOR THE UNITED STATES TO  
[000:31:56;25] TREAD HERE.  
[000:31:57;14] >> IT IS SHEP, BECAUSE ON  
[000:31:58;27] THE ONE HAND THE U.S. HAS  
[000:32:02;20] LORDED PRIME MINISTER  
[000:32:05;07] ERDOGHAN AS A TRUE DEMOCRAT  
[000:32:06;13] AND PARTNER IN THE REGION.  
[000:32:07;22] ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS IS  
[000:32:08;17] THE SAME PRIME MINISTER ONE  
[000:32:10;22] ORDERED HIS SECURITY FORCES  
[000:32:12;11] TO CRACKDOWN ON THOSE  
[000:32:14;23] PROTESTERS.  
[000:32:15;12] USING WHATEVER MEANS IS  
[000:32:16;29] NECESSARY.  
[000:32:17;15] SO, AGAIN, WE HEAR U.S.  
[000:32:19;17] OFFICIALS TODAY USING THE  
[000:32:21;01] CAUTIOUS LANGUAGE, CALLING  
[000:32:23;01] EFFECTIVELY FOR RESTRAINT  
[000:32:24;19] ON ALL SIDES.  
[000:32:25;19] LISTEN.  
[000:32:29;21] >> PUNISH INDIVIDUALS FOR  
[000:32:31;09] EXERCISING THEIR RIGHT TO

[000:32:33;22] AND WE CONDEMN ATTEMPTS BY  
[000:32:35;24] ANY PARTY TO PROVOKE  
[000:32:37;29] VIOLENCE.  
[000:32:38;15] >> OF COURSE, ONLY LAST  
[000:32:39;13] MONTH THAT PRIME MINISTER  
[000:32:42;16] ERDOGHAN WELCOMED AT THE  
[000:32:43;10] WHITE HOUSE.  
[000:32:43;27] NEITHER HE OR PRESIDENT  
[000:32:44;27] OBAMA APPARENTLY AWARE AT  
[000:32:46;06] THE TIME THAT THE  
[000:32:47;10] FIGURATIVE STORM CLOUDS  
[000:32:48;09] WERE GATHERING, SHEP.  
[000:32:49;12] >> SYRIA TIE IN HERE IS  
[000:32:51;17] IMPORTANT, JONATHAN.  
[000:32:52;09] TURKEY IS IMPORTANT THERE.  
[000:32:53;15] >> IT IS.
