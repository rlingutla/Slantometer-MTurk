[000:01:05;098] CHOICE.
[000:01:07;200] WILL THE U.S. MILITARY TAKE
[000:01:08;868] ACTION AGAINST SYRIA?
[000:01:10;503] LATE TODAY SECRETARY OF STATE
[000:01:12;705] JOHN KERRY SAID IT IS CLEAR
[000:01:14;340] CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE DEPLOYED
[000:01:17;077] AGAINST THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, BUT
[000:01:19;245] WHO GAVE THAT ORDER AND WOULD

[000:01:52;178] U.S. HAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT IS
[000:01:52;879] TRUE.

[000:03:00;914] WARNING THAT THE U.S. WOULD FAIL
[000:03:03;082] AS IN VIETNAM.
[000:03:04;817] DIANE, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE
[000:03:05;818] PURPOSE OF ANY MILITARY STRIKE
[000:03:06;920] WOULD BE TO DETER AND PREVENT
[000:03:08;588] SYRIA FROM LAUNCHING ANY MORE
[000:03:10;290] CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACKS WHICH
[000:03:11;958] MEANS THE MILITARY STRIKE WOULD
[000:03:13;126] LIKELY COME WITHIN DAYS OR

[000:03:40;887] DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
[000:03:46;492] STATE, STEVE GANYARD.
[000:03:52;232] IS THERE ANY CHANCE THEY ARE
[000:03:52;932] TRYING TO TARGET CHEMICAL
[000:03:53;933] WEAPONS THEMSELVES?
[000:03:55;068] >> PROBABLY NOT THE CHEMICAL
[000:03:56;202] WEAPONS THEMSELVES.
[000:03:57;337] TO DESTROY A CHEMICAL WEAPON YOU
[000:03:58;071] HAVE TO GET IT HOT.
[000:03:59;038] A BOMB IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
[000:03:59;772] IT'S GOING TO THROW IT AROUND
[000:04:01;374] THE SURROUNDING AREA AND YOU
[000:04:02;575] COULD SPREAD THE CHEMICAL
[000:04:04;277] WEAPONS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY.
[000:04:05;411] WE ALSO DON'T WANT THE SITES
[000:04:07;146] OPEN SO SOMEONE CAN COME IN AND
[000:04:08;281] STEAL THEM AND USE THEM IN A
[000:04:09;983] TERRORIST ATTACK LATER ON.
[000:04:11;618] >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE TARGETS
[000:04:12;752] WILL BE AND WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO
[000:04:13;886] HIT THEM?
[000:04:14;520] >> THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE TWO
[000:04:15;655] CHARACTERISTICS.
[000:04:16;789] THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC IS THEY
[000:04:17;957] WANT TO DEGRADE ASSAD'S MILITARY
[000:04:18;691] CAPABILITY TO A SIGNIFICANT
[000:04:19;359] DEGREE.
[000:04:23;563] THEY'LL PROBABLY GO AFTER AIR
[000:04:25;198] FIELDS SUCH AS THE ONE IN
[000:04:25;865] DAMASCUS AND THE ONE THAT
[000:04:27;433] DESTROYED HELICOPTERS AND
[000:04:30;470] AIRCRAFT AND WANT TO CREATE A
[000:04:33;106] RUNWAY SO THEY CAN NOT BE USED
[000:04:34;207] AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE.
[000:04:36;342] THEY'LL PROBABLY WANT TO DO
[000:04:38;044] SOMETHING THAT'S VISIBLY
[000:04:39;712] COMPELLING SO THE WORLD CAN SEE
[000:04:40;913] THAT ASSAD HAS BEEN DELIVERED A
[000:04:42;582] PUNCH AND WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING
[000:04:43;316] ABOUT HIS USE OF CHEMICAL
[000:04:45;485] WEAPONS AGAINST CIVILIANS.
