1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
THAT WE WILL BUILD A ECONOMY

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
WE'RE ENCOURAGED TO SEE THE

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS DROPPED

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
AND WORK FORCE IS AT A 3 1/2

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
YEAR HIGH.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
THIS UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
CONGRESS TO WORK WITH US TO GROW

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING TAX

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
BUSINESS CANNOT BE OVERSTATED.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
WE HAVE A ONCE IN A GENERATION

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A TAX CODE

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
THAT IS SIMPLE, FAIR AND EASY TO

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
UNDERSTAND.
THAT MEANS GETTING RID OF THE

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
LOOP HOLES THAT BENEFIT THE

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
LOWERING TAXES ON THE MIDDLE

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
AMERICANS AND BUY THE GREAT

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
PRODUCTS MADE BY AMERICAN

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
MANUFACTURERS.
TODAY THE PRESIDENT SIGNED A

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
PROCLAMATION DECLARING OCTOBER 6

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
NATIONAL MANUFACTURING DAY.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
THIS HONORS THE MEN AND WOMEN

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
THAT CREATE THE PRODUCTS THAT

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
POWER OUR COMMUNITIES, IMPROVE

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
OUR LIVES AND DEFEND OUR NATION.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
THE PEOPLE WHO HAS THE PRESIDENT

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
SAYS BELIEVE IN THOSE BEAUTIFUL

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
WORDS "MADE IN THE U.S.A."

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
IN ADDITION TO THE 14 WORKERS

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
THE PRESIDENT HOSTED IN THE OVAL

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
OFFICE DURING TODAY'S

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
PROCLAMATION SIGNING, MORE THAN

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
500,000 PEOPLE AROUND THE

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
COUNTRY ARE PARTICIPATING IN

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
THOUSANDS OF EVENTS RELATED TO

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
MANUFACTURING DAY.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
AMONG THEM, NUMEROUS MEMBERS OF

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET AND

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
OUR TAX PLAN WOULD LEAD TO A

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
GREAT MANUFACTURING BOON.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
WE WOULD CUT TAXES ON BUSINESSES

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
OF ALL SIZES AND RESTORE THEIR

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
COMPETITIVE EDGE TO CREATE MORE

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES FOR OUR

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
WORKERS.
OUR PLAN WOULD ALLOW THEM TO

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
BRING BACK TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OVERSEAS.
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE BACK OUT

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
ON THE ROAD BUILDING SUPPORT FOR

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THIS PLAN, WHICH IS REALLY A

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
JOBS BILL.
HE WILL BE IN PENNSYLVANIA

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
MONDAY AND WE'LL HAVE MORE

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
DETAILS COMING SOON.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WITH THAT, WE'LL KICKOFF FRIDAY

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
WITH QUESTIONS.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
WE'LL START NOW IS.

60
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
KIND OF FUN.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
WE SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN AND

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
NOT JUST SAVE IT FOR FRIDAYS.

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
JOHN DECKER.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
>> THANK YOU, SARAH.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
THE BODY OF ANOTHER U.S. SOLDIER

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
HAS JUST BEEN DISCOVERED BY

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
LOCAL FORCES IN NIGER WHICH

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
BRINGS TO FOUR THE TOTAL NUMBER

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
OF GREEN BERETS THAT WERE KILLED

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
WEDNESDAY IN NIGER.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
SO FAR THERE'S NO RESPONSE TO

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THIS BY THE PRESIDENT, NO TWEET

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT, NO STATEMENT

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
FROM THE PRESIDENT.

75
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
CAN WE EXPECT SOME SORT OF

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
REPRISAL BY THE U.S. MILITARY IN

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
NIGER AS RELATES TO WHAT

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
HAPPENED WEDNESDAY?

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
>> I MADE A STATEMENT ON BEHALF

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
OF THE ADMINISTRATION YESTERDAY

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
IN THE OPENING.

82
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
OBVIOUSLY ANY TIME ONE OF THE

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
MEMBERS OF OUR GREAT MILITARY

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
ARE INJURED, WOUNDED OR KILLED

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
IN ACTION, THAT IT'S CERTAINLY

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
SERIOUSLY.

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
WE'RE CONTINUING TO REVIEW AND

91
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
LOOK INTO THIS.

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
AS WE HAVE MORE DETAILS, WE'LL

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
LET YOU KNOW.

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
CECILIA?
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY THE

95
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS?

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
WAS HE REFERRING TO MILITARY

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
ACTION WHEN HE SAID "CALM BEFORE

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
THE STORM?"

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
>> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
THE PRESIDENT HAS AS I HAVE FROM

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
THIS PODIUM ON QUITE A FEW

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
OCCASIONS, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT THE

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
PRESIDENT WILL DO.

105
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
AS HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
ADDITION TO THE COMMENTS, YOU'LL

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
>> HOW SERIOUSLY SHOULD AMERICAN

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ADVERSARIES FOR THAT MATTER TAKE

110
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
THESE COMMENTS?

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
>> I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE

112
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
SERIOUS.

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S

116
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
HIS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY.

117
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
IF HE FEELS THAT ACTION IS

118
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
NECESSARY, HE WILL TAKE IT.

119
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
STEVE?
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID HE

120
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
WANTS HIS MILITARY LEADERS TO

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
GIVE THEM MILITARY OPTIONS

122
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
FASTER, DOES HE FEELS LIKE

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
THEY'RE INTENTIONALLY

124
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
SLOW-WALKING THESE OPTIONS TO

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
HIM?
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

126
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
AS YOU KNOW, HE'S A PERSON THAT

127
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
LIKES TO TAKE ACTION AND TAKE IT

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
QUICKLY.

129
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD READ

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
INTO ANYTHING BEYOND THAT.

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
HE WANTS OPTIONS ON THE TABLE SO

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
HE CAN MAKE QUICK DECISIONS.

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
>> IS THAT A GENERAL COMMENT OR

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
DID HE MEAN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY?

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
>> A GENERAL COMMENT.

136
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT WAS IN

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
REFERENCE TO.
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
ONE ON THE SOLDIER THAT WAS

139
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
KILLED IN NIGER AND THE OTHER ON

140
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
DACA.
WHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT MADE

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
AWARE THERE WAS A FOURTH SOLDIER

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
MISSING IN ACTION?

143
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
WHEN DID HE BECOME AWARE THAT

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
THAT SOLDIER HAD BEEN KILLED AND

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
DISCOVERED BY LOCAL FORCES?

146
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
>> I BELIEVE THE NOTIFICATION

147
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
WAS YESTERDAY.
I'D HAVE TO GET CLARIFICATION ON

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
THE SPECIFIC TIMING OF WHEN THAT

149
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
TOOK PLACE.
>> WHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT MADE

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
AWARE THAT THAT SOLDIER'S BODY

151
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
WAS FOUND?

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
AGAIN, I KNOW THAT IT WAS PRETTY

153
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
SOON AFTER THAT HAD BEEN

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
DISCOVERED.
AS FAR AS AN EXACT TIME, I CAN'T

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
GIVE YOU THAT.

156
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I KNOW CHIEF KELLY KEPT HIM

157
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
UPDATED ON THAT SITUATION AS IT

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
EVOLVED.

159
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
>> AND ON DACA, THE PRESIDENT

160
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
WELCOMED HISPANIC AMERICAN

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
LEADERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
HE DID NOT MENTION HIS POSITION

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
TO END DACA DURING HIS REMARKS

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
THERE.

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
HE DID NOT RENEW HIS CALL FOR

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
CONGRESS TO PROTECT THOSE THAT

167
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
WILL BE VULNERABLE FOR

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
DEPORTATION IN MARCH.

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
WHY DID HE NOT BRING THAT UP?

170
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
>> LOOK, HE'S BEEN CLEAR.

171
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
THERE'S NO REASON TO CONTINUE TO

172
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
REITERATE THE SAME POSITION THAT

173
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
HE'S HELD.

174
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
HE CALLED ON CONGRESS TO ACT ON

175
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
IT.

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
YOU CAN EXPECT IN THE COMING

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
DAYS THAT HE WILL LAY OUT HIS

178
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
RESPONSIBLE IMMIGRATION REFORM.

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT TO HAPPEN

180
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
VERY SOON.
THAT'S ALL PART OF THE PROCESS

181
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
MOVING FORWARD.
HE HASN'T BEEN UNCLEAR ABOUT

182
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
WHAT HIS POSITION IS ON THAT

183
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
FRONT.

184
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
APRIL?
>> SARAH, GOING BACK TO THE CALM

185
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
BEFORE THE STORM, WHEN THE

186
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
PRESIDENT DEALS WITH WORLD

187
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
MATTERS LIKE THIS, ALL OPTIONS

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
ARE ON THE TABLE.

189
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
HAS THIS WHITE HOUSE EXHAUSTED

190
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
DIPLOMACY?

191
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
FOR HIM TO SAY THE CALM BEFORE

192
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THE STORM, LISTENING TO WHAT HE

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
HAD TO SAY.

194
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
>> WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUT

195
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
MAXIMUM ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC

196
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
KOREA.

198
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

199
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
THAT.

200
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRESIDENT

201
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
WILL KEEP ALL OF HIS OPTIONS ON

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
THE TABLE.
OUR POSITION HAS NOT CHANGED.

203
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
IT'S BEEN VERY CONSISTENT.

204
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
>> IS NORTH KOREA THE STORM?

205
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
>> THAT'S AN EXAMPLE.

206
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
WE HAVE A LOT OF BAD ACTORS.

207
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
NORTH KOREA, IRAN.

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SEVERAL EXAMPLE THERE'S.

209
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE

210
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
CONTRACEPTION WAIVER.

211
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
THE ACLU ANNOUNCED A LAWSUIT.

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
THEY SAID THE TRUMP

213
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
ADMINISTRATION IS PAYING FOR

214
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
WOMEN TO PAY FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS

215
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
BELIEFS.

216
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT

217
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
AUTHORIZE DISCRIMINATION IN THE

218
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
NAME OF RELIGION OR OTHERWISE.

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE?

220
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
>> I WOULD NEVER GET THE ACLU TO

221
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
TAKE ANY OF MY TALKING POINTS.

222
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THE

223
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
REASON TO PRACTICE ONE'S FAITH

224
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS

225
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
COUNTRY.

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
THAT'S ALL TODAY WAS ABOUT.

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD

228
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
PROTECT THAT RIGHT.

229
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
AS LONG AS DONALD TRUMP IS

230
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
PRESIDENT, HE WILL.

231
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
>> FOR THE ACLU, WHAT WOULD YOU

232
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
SAY TO THE WOMEN OUT THERE OR

233
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
THE FAMILIES OUT THERE THAT NOW

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
HAVE TO PAY MORE OUT OF THEIR

235
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
POCKET TO GET CONTRACEPTION

236
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
COVERAGE THAT THEY CHOOSE AND

237
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
THAT THEY DESIRE?

238
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
>> THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT

239
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
SUPPORTS THE FIRST AMENDMENT,

240
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
SUPPORTS THE FREEDOM OF

241
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
RELIGION.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
SHOULD BE AN ISSUE.

243
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
THE SUPREME COURT HAS VALIDATED

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
THIS DECISION ON MANY TIMES

245
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
OVER.

246
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEBODY THAT

247
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION.

248
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHAT THE

249
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
CONSTITUTION SAYS, TALK TO

250
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
CONGRESS ABOUT CHANGING IT.

251
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
>> GIVEN THE LAWSUITS THAT THE

252
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ACLU HAS FIRED, IS THE

253
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ADMINISTRATION PREPARED TO

254
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
DEFENSE THIS CONTRACEPTION

255
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
MANDATE BACK TO THE SUPREME

256
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
COURT IF NEED BE?

257
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
>> THE SUPREME COURT MADE CLEAR

258
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
WHAT THE POSITION IS.

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
IT SUPPORT WHAT'S THIS

260
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE.

261
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
>> BUT THIS WILL BE A LEGAL

262
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
FIGHT --

263
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
>> IF IT DOES, IT SHOWS THAT

264
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
THIS STRAIGHT IS ON THE RIGHT

265
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SIDE OF THE LAW.

266
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
>> AND ON THE CALM BEFORE THE

267
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
STORM ISSUE.

268
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

269
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
PRESERVE --
>> AS LONG AS YOU DON'T ASK THE

270
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
SAME QUESTION.

271
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> IT'S A FOLLOW UP.

272
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
YOU SAID THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

273
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
PRESERVE AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

274
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
IF HE WANTS TO PRESERVE AN

275
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, WHY WOULD

276
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
HE DANGLE HINTS ABOUT HIS

277
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
ACTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

278
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
>> I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID.

279
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT ANY

280
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
SPECIFIC ACTIONS AT ALL.

281
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
MATTHEW?
>> TWO QUESTIONS.

282
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
FIRST FOLLOWING UP ON THE HHS

283
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
CHANGE.

284
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE ANY

285
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ESTIMATES OF HOW MANY PEOPLE

286
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
COULD LOSE ACCESS TO BIRTH

287
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
CONTROL UNDER THIS CHANGE?

288
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
>> I'M NOT AWARE.

289
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'D REFER YOU TO HHS FOR

290
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
SPECIFI

291
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
SPECIFICS.
>> THE PRESIDENT REPEATED

292
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
EARLIER TODAY THAT THE U.S. IS

293
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
THE HIGHEST TAX NATION IN THE

294
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
WORLD.

295
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
IT'S NOT TRUE.
SO WHY DOES HE KEEP MAKING THAT

296
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
STATEMENT?
WHY DOES HE STICK TO THAT

297
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
TALKING POINT?
>> THERE ARE SPECIFIC SECTORS IN

298
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE AMONG THE

299
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
HIGHEST TAXED IN THE WORLD AND

300
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT

301
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
DATA.

302
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
JOHN?

303
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
>> I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS, SARAH.

304
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
THERE'S RUMORS THAT PRIME

305
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
MINISTER SABRIS WILL COME HERE

306
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
ON THE 17th, MEET WITH THE

307
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
PRESIDENT AND THEN MEET WITH THE

308
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
VICE PRESIDENT ON THE 18th.

309
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
WE'VE HAD NO CONFIRMATION.

310
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
IS THE PRIME MINISTER INVITED

311
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
AND IS HE COMING TO MEET THE

312
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT?

313
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
>> HE IS.

314
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I BELIEVE THAT DATE IS CORRECT.

315
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
THE 17th, I BELIEVE, THAT HE

316
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
WILL BE HERE.

317
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
>> THE OTHER THING, THE

318
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD A VACANCY

319
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
WITHOUT A PERMANENT SECRETARY OF

320
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
HOMELAND SECURITY FOR TWO

321
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
MONTHS, WHICH IS A RECORD FOR

322
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
THAT POSITION NOT OPERATING WITH

323
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A PERMANENT SECRETARY.

324
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE AN

325
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
ANNOUNCEMENT ON A CHOICE FOR

326
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
PERMANENT SECRETARY WITHIN DAYS

327
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
NEXT WEEK PERHAPS?

328
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
AND RUMORS ARE CONSISTENT, HE

329
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
WILL MAKE ELAINE DUKE THE

330
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
PERMANENT SECRETARY.

331
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
TRUE OR FALSE?
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF

332
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
ANY ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE

333
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
PRESIDENT MAY MAKE ABOUT A

334
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
PERMANENT PERSON.

335
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I WILL SAY ACTING SECRETARY DUKE

336
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
IS VERY COMPETENT, HAS MANAGED

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
THE DEPARTMENT WELL IN A TOUGH

338
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
AND TRYING TIME GIVEN THE

339
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
HURRICANE SEASON WE'VE HAD AND

340
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
CERTAINLY HAVE NOT WANTED TO

341
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
MAKE BIG SHIFTS IN LEADERSHIP

342
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
DURING THIS TIME.

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
WHILE THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON

344
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
THERE, IN TERMS OF A TIMETABLE,

345
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED WHEN WE

346
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

347
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID

348
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
ABOUT SECRETARY DUKE, THE

349
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
TESTIMONY YOU GAVE AS THE

350
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
PRESIDENT'S OPINION OF HER AS

351
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
WELL.

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
>> YES.
HE'S HAPPY WITH THE JOB THAT

353
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
SHE'S DONE AS THE ACTING

354
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
SECRETARY.
>> SENATOR CORNYN SAID THE

355
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
IMMIGRATION PRINCIPLES WOULD BE

356
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
HARMFUL TO DACA.

357
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
DACA SHOULD BE KEPT SEPARATE

358
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
ABOUT ANY ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

359
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE'S

360
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
RESPONSE TO THAT?

361
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
ARE YOU GUYS COMMITTED TO

362
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
ATTACHING LEGAL IMMIGRATION TO

363
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
THE DACA DEBATE?

364
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
>> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER

365
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
WE PUT FORWARD IS A RESPONSIBLE

366
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
IMMIGRATION REFORM AND NOT ONE

367
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
PIECE OF THIS PROCESS DEALT WITH

368
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
SEPARATELY.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

369
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
ADDRESSING ALL THE PROBLEMS SO

370
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THIS

371
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
AGAIN IN TWO, FOUR, FIVE, SIX

372
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
YEARS BUT PUTTING FORWARD A VERY

373
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THOROUGH AND FULL PLAN.

374
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE COMING

375
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IN VERY

376
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
SHORT ORDER.

377
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
FRED?

378
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
>> THANK YOU, SARAH.

379
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
TWO WEEKS.

380
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
FIRST, THERE'S A VIEW ON PAYDAY

381
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
LENDING.

382
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
>> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

383
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
>> JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

384
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
TOPIC.

385
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
THERE'S BEEN SOME HOUSE

386
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE THAT

387
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
THERE'S ALREADY CAUSE FOR FIRING

388
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
RICHARD.

389
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
GOING BACK TO HIS HANDLING OF

390
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
THE WELLS FARGO CASE.

391
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT -- HAS

392
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
HE APPROVED OF THE JOB HE'S DONE

393
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
SO FAR?

394
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
>> WHEN WE HAVE PERSONNEL

395
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
ANNOUNCEMENTS, WE'LL KEEP YOU

396
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
POSTED.

397
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
THAT'S TWO ALREADY.
I'M MOVING ON.

398
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
MARGARET?
>> TWO QUICK QUESTIONS.

399
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
THERE'S BEEN SOME RUMORS ABOUT

400
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
THE FUTURE OF SECRETARY REX

401
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
TILLERSON TODAY.
CAN YOU CONTINUE TO SAY THE

402
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
PRESIDENT REMAINS CONFIDENT IN

403
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
HIM AS SECRETARY OF STATE?

404
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
>> HE DOES.

405
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
AS HE SAID YESTERDAY OR TWO DAYS

406
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
AGO AS I SAID YESTERDAY, NOTHING

407
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
HAS CHANGED DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY

408
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
READ IN THE MEDIA OR WATCH ON

409
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
TV.

410
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I WOULD CERTAINLY TRUST THE

411
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
PRESIDENT IN MY COMMENTS FAR

412
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
ABOVE THOSE OF OTHER REPORTERS.

413
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, THE

414
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
PRESIDENT CAN MOVE MARKETS,

415
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
CAUSE MISCALCULATIONS.

416
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
YOU MENTIONED NORTH KOREA, IRAN

417
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
WITH CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

418
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
AN IMPLICATION THAT THERE'S SOME

419
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
SORT OF FORECASTING OF A

420
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
MILITARY ACTION.

421
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
CAN YOU CLARIFY IF WE'RE

422
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
INTERPRETING THINGS CORRECTLY?

423
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN SPECIFIC ABOUT

424
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
ANYTHING.
I'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT

425
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUT

426
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
MAXIMUM ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC

427
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH

428
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
KOREA.
I'M SAYING THAT ALL OPTIONS ARE

429
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ON THE TABLE AS THEY HAVE BEEN

430
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ANNOUNCE

431
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
WHAT ACTIONS WE'LL BE TAKING

432
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
UNTIL THAT MOMENT COMES.

433
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
>> WHY DID HE SAY THAT?

434
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
>> CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC

435
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING OPEN

436
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
TO LEGISLATION BANNING BUMP

437
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
STOCKS?

438
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
>> AS I SAID YESTERDAY, WE WANT

439
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.

440
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
WE WANT MORE INFORMATION.

441
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

442
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
THAT OVER THE COMING DAYS.

443
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
THAT'S THE CURRENT POSITION.

444
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
HASN'T CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY.

445
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
>> THANK YOU, SARAH.

446
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
TWO QUESTIONS IF I CAN.

447
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
>> WHY NOT?

448
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
>> I ASKED YOU ABOUT SENATOR

449
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
CORKER.
>> JUST NOT THREE.

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
>> JUST TWO.

451
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I ASKED YOU ABOUT SENATOR CORKER

452
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
AND THE COMMENTS HE MADE A FEW

453
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
WEEKS BACK.

454
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
EARLIER THIS WEEK HE SAID THAT

455
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
SECRETARY TILLERSON, MATTIS AND

456
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
KELLY ARE BASICALLY WHAT IS

457
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
KEEPING THE COUNTRY SEPARATED

458
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
FROM CHAOS AND HE SAID THERE'S

459
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE

460
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
THAT AREN'T PUTTING FORTH

461
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
POLICIES IN A COHERENT FASHION.

462
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE?

463
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS THE

464
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
ONE THAT IS KEEPING THE WORLD

465
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
FROM CHAOS.

466
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE TEAM AROUND

467
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
HIM HELPING LEAD THAT EFFORT.

468
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
HE'S HAD TREMENDOUS

469
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE

470
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
INTERNATIONAL STAGE BY WORKING

471
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
WITH ALLIES AND CONFRONTING

472
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
ENEMIES.

473
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO

474
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
THAT WITH THE TEAM AS THE

475
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
PRESIDENT LEADING THAT EFFORT.

476
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
>> IS GENERAL KELLY --

477
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
>> I'M COME BACK.

478
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
>> GETTING BACK TO THE CALM

479
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
BEFORE THE STORM COMMENTS.

480
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
THERE'S A THEORY IN WASHINGTON

481
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
AND FORGIVE ME IF YOU'VE BEEN

482
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
ASKED ABOUT IT BEFORE, THAT THE

483
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
PRESIDENT SUBSCRIBES TO THIS MAD

484
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
MAN THEORY, THAT IF HE MAKES A

485
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
LOT OF UNSETTLING OFF-PUTTING

486
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
COMMENTS THAT SORT OF THROW

487
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
PEOPLE OFF, THAT HE LIKES TO

488
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
KEEP HIS ADVERSARIES GUESSING.

489
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
THAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING

490
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
COMMENTS LIKE CALM BEFORE THE

491
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
STORM AND SO FORTH.

492
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF THAT?

493
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
IS THERE ANYTHING TO THAT?

494
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT

495
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
ADDRESSED THIS HIMSELF.

496
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LAY OUT HIS

497
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
GAME PLAN FOR OUR ENEMIEENEMIES.

498
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
IF YOU'RE ASKING, IS THE

499
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
PRESIDENT TRYING TO DO THAT?

500
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
ABSOLUTELY.

501
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
>> HE'S TRYING TO THROW PEOPLE

502
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
OFF?
>> I WON'T SAY HE'S TRYING TO

503
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
THROW PEOPLE OFF BUT HE'S NOT

504
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
TRYING TO BROADCAST OR TELEGRAPH

505
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
HIS EXACT ACTIONS.

506
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I THINK WE'VE SEEN WHAT A

507
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
FAILURE IT IS WHEN AN

508
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
ADMINISTRATION DOES THAT AND
THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT WILL DO

509
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
IT DIFFERENTLY AND DO IT BETTER.

510
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
>> JUST A FOLLOW UP.

511
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
SO WHEN PEOPLE ARE -- THEY SORT

512
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
OF CATCH THEIR BREATH IN THIS

513
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
TOWN, WHEN THEY SORT OF HOLD

514
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
THEIR BREATH IN THIS TOWN, WHEN

515
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
HE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU

516
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
HAVE A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.

517
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
IS THAT SOMEWHAT SATISFY
SOMETHING.

518
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
>> NO.
I PICTURE PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN

519
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
HOLDING THEIR BREATH.

520
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
THAT MIGHT BE A WELCOME SURPRISE

521
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
FOR MOST OF AMERICA.

522
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
GO AHEAD.

523
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
>> SARAH, ONE MORE THING TO PICK

524
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
UP ON WHAT MARGARET WAS TRYING

525
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
TO GET AT.
LET ME PUT IT TO YOU THIS WAY.

526
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
CAN YOU EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY

527
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS ACTUALLY

528
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
JUST BEING MISCHIEVOUS?

529
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
THAT HE WAS MESSING WITH THE

530
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
PRESS A LITTLE BIT WHEN HE MADE

531
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
THAT COMMENT.

532
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
>> I WOULDN'T SAY HE'S MESSING

533
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
WITH THE PRESS.

534
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I SAY WE HAVE SOME SERIOUS WORLD

535
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
ISSUES HERE.

536
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I THINK NORTH KOREA, IRAN BOTH

537
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
CONTINUE TO BE BAD ACTORS AND

538
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
THE PRESIDENT IS SOMETHING THAT

539
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
WILL ALWAYS LOOK FOR WAYS TO

540
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
PROTECT AMERICANS.

541
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
HE'S NOT GOING TO DICTATE WHAT

542
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
THOSE ACTIONS MAY LOOK LIKE.

543
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

544
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
BEYOND THAT THAT I CAN ADD ON

545
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
THAT FRONT.

546
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
>> AND ANOTHER QUESTION ON IRAN.

547
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
A COUPLE DAYS AGO SENATOR TOM

548
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
COTTON GAVE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE

549
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
SAYS THEY BELIEVES THE BEST

550
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
OUTCOME WOULD BE TO HAVE

551
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
CONGRESS REIMPOSE SANCTIONS.

552
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
WE WOULD USE THIS PERIOD OF 120,

553
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
90 DAYS TO RENEGOTIATE SEVERAL

554
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
TERMS OF THE DEAL.

555
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE THINK THAT

556
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
THAT SOUNDS LIKE APPLAUSABLE AND

557
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
GOOD WAY TO DO WITH THE IRAN

558
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
NUCLEAR DEAL?

559
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET AHEAD OF

560
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
THE PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON

561
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
THE DECISION HE HAS.

562
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU, THE

563
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
PRESIDENT ISN'T LOOKING AT ONE

564
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
PIECE OF THIS.

565
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
HE'S LOOKING AT ALL OF THE BAD

566
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
BEHAVIOR OF IRAN, NOT JUST THE

567
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
NUCLEAR DEAL AS BAD BEHAVIOR.

568
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
THE BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING,

569
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
DESTABILIZING OF THE REGION,

570
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
NUMBER 1 STATE SPONSOR OF

571
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
TERROR, ELICIT NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

572
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
HE WANTS TO LOOK FOR A BROAD

573
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
STRATEGY THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF

574
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
THOSE PROBLEMS.
THAT'S WHAT HIS TEAM IS FOCUSED

575
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
ON AND THAT'S WHAT HE WILL ROLL

576
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
OUT TO ADDRESS THAT AS A WHOLE

577
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
IN THE COMING DAYS.

578
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
STEVE?
>> IS IT THE PRESIDENT'S WISH --

579
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
>> AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO GET

580
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
INTO THE DETAILS OF THE
PRESIDENT'S DECISION UNTIL HE

581
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
MAKES THAT.
>> SARAH, ABOUT CUBA.

582
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
CBS NEWS IS REPORTING THAT THE

583
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
STORY IS GOING TO A NEW LEVEL.

584
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
THERE'S AMERICANS THAT DON'T

585
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT THAT

586
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
SAYING THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THESE

587
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
ATTACKS.
THERE'S A HANDFUL OF AMERICANS

588
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
THAT HAVE REPORTED THESE

589
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
SYMPTOMS.
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

590
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE VIEWING

591
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
THIS?

592
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET TO THE

593
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
BOTTOM OF IT?
>> SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE

594
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
SERIOUSLY.
WE'RE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE.

595
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
THE STATE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING

596
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
THE LEAD ON THIS EFFORT AND

597
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

598
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
INTO THIS UNTIL WE GET SOME REAL

599
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
ANSWERS.

600
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
>> JUST TO DRILL DOWN ON WHAT

601
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
YOU SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT THE

602
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
PRESS.

603
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
SAYING THAT WE OWE IT -- I DON'T

604
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
THINK ANYBODY DISAGREES THAT WE

605
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
SHOULD BE ACCURATE.

606
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
BUT DO YOU AND THE PRESIDENT

607
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT HAS A

608
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AS TRUTHFUL

609
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
AND HONEST AND HAS HE DONE IT

610
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
AND THOSE SURROGATES THAT HAVE

611
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
USED ALTERNATIVE FACTS AND WOULD

612
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
THEY NOT DO THAT?

613
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

614
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
WE ALL COME HERE EVERY DAY TO

615
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
GIVE YOU THE BEST AND MOST

616
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
ACCURATE INFORMATION THAT WE

617
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
CAN.

618
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
APRIL?

619
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
>> GOING BACK TO THE ANSWER

620
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND THE

621
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
PRESIDENT.

622
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
IS GENERAL KELLY PART OF THAT

623
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
LEADERSHIP TEAM WITH THE

624
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
PRESIDENT AS HE'S LEADING IN

625
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
THIS WHITE HOUSE?

626
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

627
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE

628
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
CONFIDENCE IN GENERAL KELLY?

629
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

630
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
>> TODAY IS FRIDAY.

631
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
CAN WE EXPECT A RESIGNATION

632
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
TODAY?
>> I DON'T THINK SO, APRIL.

633
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
DAVID?

634
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
>> SINCE WE LAST HEARD FROM YOU,

635
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
THE FORM PRODUCER HARVEY

636
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
WINESTEIN HAS BECOME THE SUBJECT

637
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

638
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
ALLEGATIONS.
AND THERE'S BEEN SOME DEMOCRATS

639
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
THAT HAVE HAD DONATIONS.

640
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT LATINOS

641
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
IN HOLLYWOOD WOULD BE DEPORTED

642
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
IF THE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED.

643
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
DOES THE PRESIDENT THESE THE

644
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
DONATIONS SHOULD GO BACK?

645
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
>> THAT'S A DECISION FOR THE

646
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE.

647
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS MONEY

648
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE, THAT'S

649
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
UP TO THEM.
THAT'S NOT A DECISION FOR US TO

650
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
MAKE.
>> ONE MORE -- I'M SORRY.

651
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
WHY HASN'T THE PRESIDENT FIRED

652
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
THE IRS HEAD?

653
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
HE TALKED ABOUT THE SCANDAL.

654
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
WHY DOES HE STILL HAVE A JOB?

655
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
>> I'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM AND GET

656
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
BACK TO YOU.

657
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
>> LAS VEGAS QUESTION.

658
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE

659
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
POLICE AND THEIR RESPONSE AFTER

660
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
THE MASS SHOOTINGS.

661
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
NEVADA --

662
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> CAN YOU SPEAK UP A LITTLE

663
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
BIT?
>> NEVADIANS CREDIT FEDERAL

664
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
MONDAY PROGRAMS TO TRAIN THEM TO

665
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
DEAL WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS TO

666
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
DEAL WITH THE GREAT RESPONSE.

667
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
YOU HAVE CUTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS

668
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
IN YOUR BUDGET PLANS?

669
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT?

670
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE

671
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD.

672
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
IF THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE WE

673
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
FEEL LIKE THE SAFETY AND

674
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
SECURITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS

675
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
MAY BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF CUTS,

676
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO

677
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
RE-VISIT IT AT THAT TIME.

678
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
JIM?

679
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
>> SARAH, THE NATION LOST 33,000

680
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
JOBS IN SEPTEMBER.

681
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I WAS CURIOUS WHAT THE

682
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
PRESIDENT -- HOW THE PRESIDENT

683
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
FEELS ABOUT THAT AND HE'S

684
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
STEPPING UP HIS EFFORTS TO

685
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
CONVINCE CONGRESS TO PASS MAJOR

686
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
TAX RETURNS BECAUSE OF THIS

687
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
SURPRISING JOB LOSS IN

688
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
SEPTEMBER.
>> I THINK TODAY'S REPORT SHOWS

689
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE

690
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
HURRICANE SEASON.

691
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
WHILE MANY DISPLACED WEREN'T

692
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
ABLE TO WORK, THE ECONOMY

693
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
REMAINS EXTREMELY STRONG.

694
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE

695
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
JOBS, WHICH IS WHY THE

696
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL.

697
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I THINK ONE THING TO REALLY KNOW

698
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
AND SOMETHING THAT THIS
ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO FOCUS ON

699
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
CERTAINLY MOVING INTO THE

700
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
FUTURE, I THINK TAX REFORM PLAY

701
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
AS BIG ROLE IN THIS.

702
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
ONE OF THE BIG IDENTIFIERS THAT

703
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IS THE

704
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
DROP IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE,

705
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
INCLUDING NEW LOADS FOR AFRICAN

706
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
AMERICANS, TEENS AND WOMEN,

707
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
WHICH IS CERTAINLY A GREAT STEP

708
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS.

709
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

710
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
REPEATEDLY SAID THAT WE SHOULD

711
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
LET OBAMACARE IMPLODE.

712
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
THERE'S A NEW REPORT IN "THE

713
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
WASHINGTON POST" THAT SET THAT

714
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP PERSONALLY

715
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
DIRECTED ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS TO DENY A REQUEST FROM

716
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF IOWA TO

717
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
FIX THE OBAMACARE MARKET IN THAT

718
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
STATE.

719
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
IS THAT TRUE?

720
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT

721
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
SPECIFIC DIRECTIVE.

722
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
SO I'D HAVE TO CHECK INTO THAT

723
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
AND GET BACK TO YOU.

724
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
>> IF IT IS TRUE --

725
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
>> I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON

726
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
HYPOTHETICALS WHERE I DON'T HAVE

727
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME.

728
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE

729
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
IRAN RECERTIFICATION PROCESS.

730
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT

731
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
DECIDES, WHEN HE MAKES THIS

732
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
DECISION NEXT WEEK, WOULD YOU

733
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
RATHER NOT HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY

734
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
90 DAYS AFTER THAT?

735
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
>> AGAIN, AS I SAID EARLIER,

736
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT

737
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
IS A BROAD STRATEGY, DOESN'T

738
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
JUST ADDRESS ONE PART OF I RAN'S

739
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
BAD BEHAVIOR AND ADDRESSES A

740
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES.

741
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SO THAT WOULD BE OUR FOCUS.

742
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
HOPEFULLY THEY WOULD BEGIN TO

743
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
NOT BE A BAD ACTOR AROUND WE

744
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS AT ALL.

745
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
OUR GOAL WOULD BE TO ADDRESS A

746
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
NUMBER OF FACTORS, NOTICE JUST

747
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
ONE OR TWO THING.

748
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
PETER?

749
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
>> A SECOND QUESTION.

750
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT HE

751
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
WANTED PAKISTAN TO GO AGAINST

752
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
AGENTS OF CHAOS.

753
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
THE FOREIGN MINISTER WAS HERE IN

754
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
THE WHITE HOUSE THIS WEEK TO

755
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
MEET GENERAL McMASTER.

756
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY CHANGE IN

757
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
PAKISTANI BEHAVIOR?

758
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
>> NOTHING SPECIFIC THAT I CAN

759
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
WEIGH INTO AT THIS TIME.

760
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

761
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
>> WILL THE PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN

762
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
FOR THE CANDIDATE IN VIRGINIA?

763
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
>> I'M NOT GROG TO WAY INTO

764
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
SPECIFIC RACES AND THE ACTIONS

765
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
WE MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE.

766
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
THAT'S A GREAT PLACE TO END THIS

767
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
FOR FRIDAY.

768
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I HOPE EVERYBODY HAS A GREAT

769
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
REST OF THE FRIDAY AND A GOOD

770
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
WEEKEND.

771
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
THANKS, GUYS.

772
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
>> Shepard: THE WHITE HOUSE

773
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
PRESS SECRETARY, SARAH SANDERS

774
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
WRAPPED UP THE BRIEFING.

775
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
THAT STARTED AFTER PRESIDENT

776
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
TRUMP WITH A WINK AND A WARNING

777
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
AFTER REMAINING WHAT HE MEANT

778
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
WHEN HE CALLED A MEETING WITH

779
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
THE MILITARY MELITERS THE CALM

780
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
BEFORE THE STORM.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

781
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

782
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.

783
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
>> THANK YOU.

784
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
>> Shepard: THE PRESIDENT MADE

785
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
THE ORIGINAL COMMENT LAST NIGHT

786
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

787
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
AT THAT TIME HE WAS MEETING WITH

788
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
HIS MILITARY LEADERS TO TALK

789
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
ABOUT MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY

790
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
ISSUES, INCLUDING IRAN, NORTH

791
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
KOREA AND ISIS.

792
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
LISTEN.
>> THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE

793
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
STORM.

794
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
>> WHAT STORM IS THAT,

795
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
MR. PRESIDENT?

796
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

797
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
>> WHAT STORM, MR. PRESIDENT?

798
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.

799
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
>> Shepard: YOU'LL FIND OUT.

800
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
WE WERE HOPING TO FIND OUT MORE

801
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
AT THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING

802
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
TODAY.

803
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
KRISTIN FISHER IS LIVE IN THE

804
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
BRIEFING ROOM.
WE DID NOT.

805
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
>> WE DID NOT FIND OUT ANY

806
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION.

807
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
THAT HAS BEEN THE MILLION DOLLAR

808
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
QUESTION ALL DAY HERE IN

809
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
WASHINGTON AND AROUND THE WORLD.

810
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
WHAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

811
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
REFERRING TO WHEN HE SAID THAT

812
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE THE

813
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
STORM.

814
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
YOU KNOW, REPORTERS IN THIS ROOM

815
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
ASK THAT QUESTION ABOUT AS MANY

816
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
TIMES AS YOU COULD POSSIBLY ASK

817
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
THE PRESS SECRETARY.

818
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
THEY ASKED HER, YOU KNOW, WAS

819
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
THIS INTENDED TO KEEP OUR

820
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
ADVERSARIES GUESSING?

821
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
PERHAPS WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

822
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
BEING MISCHIEVOUS OR MAYBE HE

823
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
JUST MESSING WITH THE PRESS.

824
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE SAID.

825
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
LISTEN TO THIS.

826
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
>> AS WE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE,

827
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS, AS I

828
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
HAVE FROM THIS PODIUM ON QUITE A

829
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
FEW OCCASIONS, WE'RE NEVER GOING

830
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
TO SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT THE

831
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DO.

832
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
AS HE SAID LAST NIGHT IN

833
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
ADDITION TO THOSE COMMENTS,

834
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

835
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE

836
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY

837
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
SERIOUS.

838
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
HE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT'S HIS

839
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
NUMBER 1 PRIORITY.

840
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
IF HE FEELS THAT ACTION IS

841
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
NECESSARY, HE WILL TAKE IT.

842
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
>> WAS HE REFERRING TO NORTH

843
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
KOREA?

844
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
WAS HE REFERRING TO SUPERIOR IS

845
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
FIGHTERS IN NIGER AFTER THE LOSS

846
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
OF GREEN BERETS THIS WEEK OR

847
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
MAYBE IRAN?

848
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

849
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
AS THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS

850
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
SECRETARY MADE CLEAR, SHE'S NOT

851
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
GOING TO GIVE MORE DETAILS.

852
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
SHE WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO HIM,

853
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
SHEP.

854
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
>> Shepard: KRISTIN, THE WHITE
HOUSE TALKING ABOUT THE TRUMP

855
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
ADMINISTRATION'S NEW LIMITS ON

856
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
MANDATORY BIRTH CONTROL COVERAGE

857
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR

858
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
OBAMACARE.
THE NEW POLICY LETS EMPLOYERS

859
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
REFUSE FREE CONTRACEPTIVES BY

860
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
CLAIMING A RELIGIOUS OR MORAL

861
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
OBJECTION.

862
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES

863
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
UNION HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AND

864
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
OTHERS ARE PLANNING TO DO THE

865
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
SAME THING.

866
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
BACK TO KRISTIN FISHER, A TOUCHY

867
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
SUBJECT THERE TODAY.

868
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
>> RIGHT.
SO BEFORE THESE EXEMPTIONS WERE

869
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
STRICTLY LIMITED TO RELIGIOUS

870
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
BELIEFS.

871
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
NOW THEY'VE BEEN EXPANDED TO

872
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
INCLUDE MORAL OBJECTIONS AS

873
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
WELL.
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

874
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
WHAT CONSTITUTES A MORAL

875
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
OBJECTION, HOW WILL THAT BE

876
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
DETERMINED.
THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THAT WILL

877
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
BE DETERMINED BY THE STATE.

878
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
THIS IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

879
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
ROLL BACK OF THE CONTRACEPTION

880
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
MANDATE BY THIS WHITE HOUSE AND

881
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
THE ACLU HAS NOW THREATENED TO

882
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
FILE A LAWSUIT.

883
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
JUST A MOMENT AGO, THE PRESS

884
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
SECRETARY WAS ASKED WHAT DOES

885
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
THE WHITE HOUSE THINK ABOUT

886
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
THIS?
COULD IT GO TO THE SUPREME

887
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
COURT?

888
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID.

889
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
>> I WOULD PROBABLY NEVER USE

890
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
THE ACLU TO GET MY TALKING

891
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
POINTS.

892
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE FREEDOM

893
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
TO PRACTICE ONE'S FAITH IS A

894
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN THIS

895
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
COUNTRY.
ALL OF US DO.

896
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
THAT'S ALL THAT TODAY WAS ABOUT.

897
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD

898
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
PROTECT THAT RIGHT.
AS LONG AS DONALD TRUMP IS

899
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
PRESIDENT, HE WILL.

900
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
>> THE FLIP SIDE IS COMING FROM

901
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
DEMOCRATS.

902
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
NANCY PELOSI CALLED THIS NEW

903
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
RULE DESPICABLE BECAUSE WHAT

904
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
THIS MEANS IS NOW THAT

905
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF

906
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ACROSS THIS

907
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
COUNTRY WILL NO LONGER HAVE

908
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
ACCESS TO FREE BIRTH CONTROL IF

909
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
THIS RULE GOES FORWARD, SHEP.

910
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
>> Shepard: THANK YOU, KRISTIN.

911
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
LET'S TURN TO CHRIS WALLACE NOW,

912
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
THE ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS SUNDAY"

913
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
LIVE WITH US IN D.C.

914
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
WITH A SMILE THE PRESIDENT SAYS,

915
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
YOU CAN TAKE THIS MEETING TO BE

916
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

917
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO THINK?

918
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
>> WELL -- LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW

919
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
IS THE ANSWER.

920
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
THE PRESIDENT REFUSES TO ANSWER.

921
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
YOU SAW SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS,

922
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
HIS CHIEF SPOKESPERSON REFUSED

923
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
TO ANSWER.

924
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
MY GUESS IS THE PRESIDENT IS

925
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
SITTING THERE WITH A TOP BRASS

926
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
OF THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY ON

927
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
EARTH EVER AND SAYING IT'S THE

928
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

929
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
HE'S NOT SAYING WE'RE ABOUT TO

930
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
STRIKE NORTH KOREA, WE'RE ABOUT

931
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
TO STRIKE IRAN.

932
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
HE'S NOT GOING TO TIP HIS HAND

933
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
ON IMMINENT MILITARY ACTION.

934
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
HE'S SAYING, WE HAVE THE MOST

935
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
POWERFUL MILITARY AND DON'T MESS

936
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
WITH US.
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

937
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
DO I THINK HE'S LAYING OUT A

938
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
SPECIFIC -- SOMETHING THAT WILL

939
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT DAYS, WEEKS,

940
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
HOURS, MONTHS?
NO.

941
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I THINK HE'S SAYING WE HAVE THAT

942
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
CAPABILITY.

943
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
THERE WAS A VERY GOOD QUESTION

944
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
ASKED IN THE BRIEFING, THIS

945
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
PRESIDENT LIKE RICHARD NIXON

946
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
SUBSCRIBES TO THE BAD MAN

947
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
THEORY.

948
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE TOOLS A

949
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
PRESIDENT CAN USE AS THE MOST

950
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
POWERFULMAN ON EARTH IS TO LAY

951
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
OUT TO ADVERSARIES THAT HE CAN

952
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
DO ANYTHING.

953
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
YOU BETTER BE CONCERNED.

954
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
THERE'S AN INTERESTING STORY

955
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
THAT CAME OUT LAST WEEK THAT HIS

956
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
TRADE REPRESENTATIVE WAS GOING

957
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
TO SOUTH KOREA TO NEGOTIATE A

958
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
NEW SOUTH KOREAN TRADE DEAL.

959
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
THE PRESIDENT SAID TO HIM, WE'RE

960
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
GOING TO ONLY GIVE THIS 30 DAYS.

961
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
WHEN THE TRADE REPRESENTATIVE

962
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
SAID, ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL THEM

963
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
30 DAYS.

964
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
HE SAID NO, NO.

965
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I MIGHT DROP OUT AT ANY POINT

966
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
AND PULL THE PLUG ON THIS AT ANY

967
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
MOMENT.
THE POINT BEING THAT SOUTH KOREA

968
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL CONFIDENT

969
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
IN THAT THEY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT

970
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
THIS PRESIDENT WILL DO.

971
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
MY GUESS IS THAT IS BASICALLY

972
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING

973
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
HERE.
>> Shepard: IF YOU'RE IN

974
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
NEW ORLEANS OR IN GULFPORT AND

975
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
YOU SAY THIS IS THE CALM BEFORE

976
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
THE STORM THAT MEANS THERE'S A

977
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
TROPICAL STORM OR HURRICANE

978
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
HEADED AND HELL COMING.

979
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
WHEN YOU SAY IT WITH YOUR

980
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
MILITARY LEADERS BEHIND YOU,

981
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
THIS MEETING OF THE LEADERS IS

982
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM,

983
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT SOME SORT

984
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
OF CONFLICT IS BREWING.

985
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
ARE YOU NOT?

986
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IT COULD

987
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
MEAN.

988
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
HERE'S THE MILITARY LEADERS,

989
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
CALM BEFORE THE STORM IS COMING.

990
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
IT'S NOT EXACTLY A CALMING,

991
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
COMFORTING THING.
>> IT ISN'T.

992
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
BUT I DON'T THINK HE WANTS IRAN

993
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
OR NORTH KOREA OR THE LEADERS OF

994
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
THOSE REGIMES TO BE CALM AND

995
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
COMFORTABLE.

996
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
IT'S LIKE WHEN HE SAID TO NORTH

997
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
KOREA, YOU KNOW, IF THEY PUSH US

998
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
TOO FAR, WE'LL RAIN DOWN FIRE

999
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
AND FURY ON THEM.

1000
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
HE'S NOT SAYING I'M ABOUT TO DO

1001
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
IT.
HE'S NOT SAYING NEXT TUESDAY AT

1002
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
3:00 P.M., WE'RE GOING TO TAKE

1003
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
THIS PARTICULAR TACTIC.

1004
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
HE'S SAYING I HAVE THAT

1005
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
CAPABILITY AND PREPARED TO USE

1006
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
IT IF NECESSARY.

1007
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
>> Shepard: THERE'S A NEW POLL

1008
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
OUT FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS.

1009
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
24% OF AMERICANS SAY THE UNITED

1010
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
STATES IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT

1011
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
DIRECTION.
67% DISAPPROVE OF THE

1012
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE.

1013
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
NORMALLY WHEN THINGS LIKE THIS

1014
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
HAPPEN, HE WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME

1015
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
ACTION TO CHANGE THE POLLS.

1016
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I WONDER HOW CONCERNED THEY ARE

1017
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
IF AT ALL?

1018
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
>> LOOK, HE'S BEEN LOW IN THE

1019
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
POLLS FOR QUITE A PERIOD OF TIME

1020
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
NOW.
HE BASICALLY HAS SUPPORT OF 34

1021
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
TO 40, OCCASIONALLY PICKS UP

1022
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
INTO THE 40%.

1023
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
HE'S UNDER WATER IN ALMOST ALL

1024
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
OF THE POLLS.

1025
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
HE'S NOT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION

1026
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS.

1027
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I THINK HE FEELS IN REASONABLY

1028
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
STRONG SHAPE.

1029
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE A FELLOW

1030
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
THAT KNOW WHAT'S HE WANTS TO DO

1031
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
HE'S GOTTEN HIGH MARKS ON SOME

1032
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
THINGS.
VERY HIGH MARKS ON THE REACTION

1033
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
TO IRMA AND HARVEY AND TEXAS AND

1034
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
FLORIDA.
NOT NEARLY AS HIGH MARKS ON HIS

1035
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
REACTION TO MARIA IN PUERTO

1036
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
RICO.

1037
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL

1038
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
BUMP ALONG.

1039
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

1040
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
THERE'S TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE

1041
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
VERY SUPPORTIVE AND THINK HE

1042
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
DOES THE RIGHT THINGS AND TIMES

1043
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
WHEN HE UPSETS PEOPLE.

1044
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
>> Shepard: AND ALSO IN THE

1045
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
NEWS, THIS CONTRACEPTION CHANGE.

1046
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
HOW IS THAT FLYING THERE

1047
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
POLITICALLY AND OTHERWISE?

1048
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
>> LOOK, IT'S THE USUAL

1049
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
SUSPECTS.

1050
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
IF YOU'RE A STRONG SUPPORTER OF

1051
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
BIRTH CONTROL, YOU'RE OUTRAGED

1052
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
BY THIS.

1053
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
THE PRESIDENT IS DRAMATICALLY

1054
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
INCREASING THE EXCEPTIONS.

1055
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
LET'S GO BACK.

1056
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
OBAMACARE AS PART OF OFFERING

1057
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
EMPLOYERS, OFFERING HEALTHCARE

1058
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
SERVICES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES,

1059
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
THEY HAVE TO OFFER AS A FREE

1060
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
BENEFIT BIRTH CONTROL.

1061
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
NOW WE HAVE THE FIGHT IN THE

1062
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
SUPREME COURT WHEN OBAMA WAS

1063
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
PRESIDENT.
THE HOBBY LOBBY, GROUPS THAT

1064
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
WERE EXEMPTED.

1065
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
NOW THE PRESIDENT WITH HIS HHS

1066
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
REGULATION IS DRAMATICALLY

1067
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
INCREASING THE EXCEPTIONS AND IS

1068
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

1069
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
GROUPS, NONPROFITS, TO PROPER IF

1070
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
ITS, RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS,

1071
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
NONRELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IF

1072
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
THEY HAVE A RELIGIOUS OR A MORAL

1073
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
OBJECTION, THEY CAN SAY THAT

1074
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO

1075
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
PROVIDE BIRTH CONTROL TO THEIR

1076
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
EMPLOYEES.
THE ACLU IS ALREADY FILING A

1077
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
SUIT ON THIS.

1078
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY END UP IN

1079
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
THE COURTS.

1080
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
>> Shepard: IT IS A BIT

1081
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
CONFUSING AS BIRTH CONTROL

1082
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
PREVENTS ABORTIONS FROM EVER

1083
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
HAPPENING.
IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO HAVE BIRTH

1084
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
CONTROL, FAMILY PLANNING COMES

1085
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
ALONG MORE EASILY AND WITHOUT

1086
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
THE CONTROVERSY THAT COMES ALONG

1087
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
WITH ABORTIONS.

1088
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE WORKING

1089
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
AGAINST ITSELF IN A WAY.

1090
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
>> WELL, YES, BUT THAT'S THE

1091
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
TENANT OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

1092
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING

1093
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
TO INTERFERE WITH LIFE.

1094
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
ABORTION INTERFERES WITH LIFE.

1095
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
THEY THINK THAT BIRTH CONTROL,

1096
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
ARTIFICIAL BIRTH CONTROL

1097
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
INTERFERES WITH LIFE.

1098
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
THERE ARE PLENTY OF RELIGIONS

1099
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
THAT HOLD TO THOSE TENANTS EVEN

1100
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
THOUGH YOUR POINT ABOUT THE LACK

1101
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
OF BIRTH CONTROL POSSIBLY

1102
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
LEADING TO UNWANTED PREGNANCIES

1103
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
IS ALSO TRUE.

1104
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
>> Shepard: ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.

1105
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND?

1106
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU PUT ME

1107
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
THROUGH MY PACES TODAY.

1108
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
LAS VEGAS IS A BIG STORY STILL.

1109
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
A TERRIBLE STORY.

1110
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
WE'RE STILL LEFT A WEEK LATER

1111
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
WITH THE QUESTION WHY AND WHEN

1112
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
WILL PEOPLE BE TALKING TO YOU?

1113
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
STEVE WYNN, ONE OF THE KINGS OF

1114
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
LAS VEGAS.

1115
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
THE HEAD OF TWO OF THE BIGGEST

1116
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
HOTELS AND CASINOS IN THAT TOWN.

1117
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WYNN

1118
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
DECIDE ADD YEAR AGO THAT

1119
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
LAS VEGAS WAS A SOFT TARGET.

1120
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
WHEN YOU HEAR THE KINDS OF

1121
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
THINGS -- WE'LL HAVE AN

1122
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SUNDAY --

1123
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
THAT HE DID TO TRY TO HARDEN THE

1124
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
WYNN HOTEL AND TO HARDEN THE

1125
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
ENCORE HOTEL IN TERMS OF

1126
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
BRINGING IN FORMER SEAL TEAMS

1127
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
SIX MEMBERS, FORMER CIA

1128
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
OFFICERS, HIDDEN DETECTORS,

1129
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
HIDDEN PROFILERS IN THE CASINOS.

1130
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIS

1131
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
PROPERTIES.

1132
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW THREAT,

1133
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
WHICH WE SAW FROM STEPHEN

1134
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
PADDOCK, WHICH IS KNOCKING OUT

1135
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
THE WINDOWS AND FIRING DOWN FROM

1136
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
THE 32nd FLOOR.

1137
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL TALK TO

1138
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
STEVE WYNN ABOUT, HOW DO YOU

1139
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
HANDLE AND PREVENT THAT WE'LL BE

1140
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
TALKING TO ERIC PRATT, THE

1141
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS

1142
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
OF AMERICA.

1143
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHILE THE

1144
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
NRA IS SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD

1145
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
REGULATE AND RESTRICT THE BUMP

1146
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
STOCKS, ERIC PRATT SAYS NO.

1147
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
WE'LL TALK TO HIM.

1148
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
>> Shepard: WE'LL WATCH THIS

1149
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
SUNDAY, CHRIS, ON "FOX NEWS

1150
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
SUNDAY."
LET'S GO TO MICHAEL CROWLEY FROM

1151
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
POLITCO.
I'M HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING

1152
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
AWAY FROM THE CALM BEFORE THE

1153
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
STORM THING, MICHAEL.

1154
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
HE SAID IT.

1155
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
NOBODY ASKED HIM ANYTHING ABOUT

1156
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
IT.
IT JUST CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

1157
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE VIDEO, HE HAS

1158
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHEN

1159
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1160
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
ALMOST FEELS LIKE A TEASE DURING

1161
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
A REALITY SHOW.

1162
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
SERIOUSLY.
WELL, YOU'LL SEE.

1163
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
CALM BEFORE THE STORM!

1164
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
>> HE'S A REALITY SHOW STAR,

1165
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
SHEP.

1166
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
HE BRINGS SOME OF THAT TO THE

1167
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
PRESIDENCY.
I DON'T SAY THAT LIGHTLY.

1168
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I THINK THE GUY REALLY DOES HAVE

1169
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
A SENSE OF DRAMA LIKE, THIS IT'S

1170
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT HE'S SORT

1171
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OF WORKING THE AUDIENCE.

1172
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
IT'S POSSIBLE THIS.

1173
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
A THROW-AWAY COMMENT THAT TOOK

1174
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

1175
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
INITIALLY.
NOW HE'S RUNNING WITH IT.

1176
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
HE'S ENJOYING IT.

1177
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING

1178
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
ABOUT.

1179
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
THERE AREN'T OFFICIALS AROUND

1180
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
HIM LEAKING THERE'S SOME SECRET

1181
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
MEETING.

1182
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I WOULD SAY MY MAIN GUESS IS

1183
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A MIND

1184
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
GAME HE'S PLAYING WITH NORTH

1185
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
KOREA.
HE'S TRYING TO GET INSIDE THE

1186
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
HEAD OF KIM JONG-UN.
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THIS

1187
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
IS PART OF IT, BUT IT WOULD BE

1188
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
CONSISTENT WITH THINGS LIKE

1189
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
TRUMP CALLING HIM NICKNAMES LIKE

1190
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
ROCKET MAN AND LITTLE ROCKET

1191
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
MAN.
MAKING THE NORTH KOREANS THINK

1192
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TRUMP'S

1193
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
NEXT MOVE IS.
HE COULD BE A LITTLE CRAZY.

1194
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
THE GUY WAVING THE GUN AROUND.

1195
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY?

1196
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
THINK I'M GOING TO TAKE THE

1197
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
CHANCE?

1198
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
IT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH

1199
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
THAT.
>> Shepard: YOU SAID I HOPE THE

1200
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
CIA IS RIGHT IN HIS ASSESSMENT

1201
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
OF KIM JONG-UN.

1202
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
>> RIGHT.

1203
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
THE CIA BELIEVES THAT KIM

1204
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
JONG-UN IS FUNDAMENTALLY

1205
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
RATIONALE.
THE KEY WAY TO TRANSLATE THAT

1206
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
IS, HE'S NOT SUICIDAL.

1207
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
HE'S NOT GOING TO GO DOWN -- HE

1208
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
DOESN'T WANT TO GO DOWN IN

1209
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
FLAMES.
HE LIKES HIS LIFE.

1210
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
NORTH KOREA IS A MISERABLE PLAY

1211
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
OVERALL.

1212
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
HE LIVES COMFORTABLY.

1213
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
THERE'S LIQUOR AND WOMEN AND

1214
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
NICE TECHNOLOGY IF HE WANTS IT.

1215
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS IF WE'RE

1216
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT DO

1217
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
SOMETHING TOTALLY IRRATIONAL AND

1218
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
UNEXPECTED.

1219
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
WHAT IS AMAZING AT THIS POINT,

1220
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
IT'S THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT

1221
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DECIDE, IS

1222
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
HE ACTING TOTALLY RATIONALLY.

1223
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
MAYBE THAT TRUMP IS TRYING TO

1224
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
PRESENT HIMSELF -- THERE'S A

1225
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
THEORY, THE MAD MAN THEORY.

1226
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
>> Shepard: EVERYBODY IS TALKING

1227
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
ABOUT THAT TODAY.

1228
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
CHRIS WALLACE MENTIONED IT.

1229
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I READ IT ON MY FEED.

1230
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
WHAT PROMPTED THIS?

1231
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

1232
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
>> I THINK IT'S THE WAY TRUMP

1233
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
APPROACHES THESE ISSUES, THIS

1234
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
GOES BACK TO THE NIXON

1235
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
ADMINISTRATION WHERE HE TRIED TO

1236
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
CULTIVATE AN IMAGE THAT HE WAS

1237
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
CAPABLE OF DOING ANYTHING, GOING

1238
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
NUCLEAR, FOR INSTANCE AGAINST

1239
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
THE CHINESE AND TRYING TO SCARE

1240
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
YOUR OPPONENT BY MAKING THEM

1241
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
THINK YOU'RE NOT A RATIONALE

1242
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
ACTOR.

1243
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
WHAT IS AMAZING, WE SPENT THIS

1244
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
TIME TRYING TO DECIDE IF THE

1245
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
NORTH KOREANS ARE NATIONAL.

1246
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SEE IF

1247
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
DONALD TRUMP IS RATIONALE.

1248
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
DOES HE PLAY BY THE OTHER RULES

1249
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
THAT AMERICAN PRESIDENTS HAVE?

1250
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
THEY FELT LIKE AMERICAN

1251
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
PRESIDENTS WOULD STAY WITHIN

1252
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
CERTAIN BOUNDARIES AND NOT

1253
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
INITIATE MILITARY ACTION.

1254
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
OR IS HE REALLY GOING TO GO FOR

1255
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
IT IN A WAY WE'VE NEVER SEN

1256
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
BEFORE?

1257
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
THEY DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW.

1258
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
TRUMP LIKES THAT.

1259
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
>> Shepard: MICHAEL CROWLEY,

1260
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
FOREIGN -- SENIOR FOREIGN

1261
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT FOR

1262
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
POLITCO.
THANKS AS ALWAYS.

1263
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
>> THANKS.
>> Shepard: AHEAD, THE

1264
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS

1265
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
CONCERT KILLER.

1266
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
NEW REPORTS ON WHAT THE GUNMAN

1267
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
HAD IN HIS ROOM AND QUESTIONS

1268
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
NOW.
LISTEN TO THE QUESTION THEY'RE

1269
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
TRYING TO ANSWER NOW.

1270
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS ROOM?

1271
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
AS THE AGENT CHASE DOWN CLUES

1272
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
AND SURVIVORS FACE CHANGED

1273
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
LIVES, THIS WEEK A RETIRED

1274
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
CARPENTER DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO

1275
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
PLACE 58 WHITE CROSSES ON THE

1276
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
STRIP.
ONE FOR EACH PERSON KILLED.

1277
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
HERE ONE WOMAN SITS NEAR THE

1278
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
CROSS FOR HER COUSIN,

1279
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
20-YEAR-OLD BAILEY SCHWIETZER.

1280
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
THE NEWS OF LAS VEGAS IS NEXT.

1281
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Prudential asked these couples:

1282
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
how much money do you
think you'll need in retirement?

1283
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then we found out how many years
that money would last them.

1284
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
How long do you
think we'll keep --

1285
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oooooohhh! You stopped!

1286
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You're gonna leave me
back here at year 9?

1287
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
How did this happen?

1288
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
It turned out, a lot
of people fell short,

1289
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
of even the average
length of retirement.

1290
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We have to think about
not when we expect to live to,

1291
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
but when we could live to.

1292
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Let's plan for income that lasts
all our years in retirement.

1293
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Prudential.
Bring your challenges.

1294
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
(AVO)
but you also have a higher risk
of heart attack or stroke.

1295
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Non-insulin Victoza®
lowers A1C,

1296
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and now reduces
cardiovascular risk.

1297
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Victoza® lowers my
A1C and blood sugar

1298
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
better than
the leading
branded pill.

1299
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
(AVO)
And for people with
type 2 diabetes

1300
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
treating cardiovascular disease,
Victoza® is NOW approved

1301
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
to lower the risk of major
cardiovascular events

1302
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
such as heart attack,
stroke, or death.

1303
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And while it isn't
for weight loss,

1304
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Victoza® may
help you lose some weight.

1305
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
(AVO)
Victoza® is not for people with
type 1 diabetes

1306
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
or diabetic ketoacidosis.

1307
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Do not take Victoza® if you have
a personal or family history

1308
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
of medullary thyroid cancer,

1309
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Multiple Endocrine
Neoplasia syndrome type 2,

1310
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
or if you are allergic
to Victoza®

1311
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
or any of its ingredients.

1312
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Stop taking Victoza® and get
medical help right away

1313
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
if you get symptoms of a serious
allergic reaction such as rash,

1314
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
swelling, difficulty breathing
or swallowing.

1315
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Serious side effects may happen,
including pancreatitis.

1316
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So, stop taking Victoza®
and call your doctor right away

1317
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
if you have severe pain
in your stomach area.

1318
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Tell your doctor
your medical history.

1319
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Gallbladder problems have
happened in some people.

1320
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Tell your doctor right away
if you get symptoms.

1321
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Taking Victoza® with
a sulfonylurea or insulin

1322
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
may cause low blood sugar.

1323
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Common side effects are nausea,
diarrhea, vomiting,

1324
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
decreased appetite,
indigestion, and constipation.

1325
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Side effects
can lead to dehydration,

1326
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
which may cause kidney problems.

1327
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Ask your doctor
about Victoza®.

1328
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
>> Shepard: BREAKING THIS HOUR.

1329
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
INVESTIGATORS IN LAS VEGAS ARE

1330
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER

1331
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
ANYBODY ELSE WAS IN THE

1332
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
LAS VEGAS KILLER'S HOTEL SWEET.

1333
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
THAT'S ACCORDING TO NBC NEWS.

1334
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
OFFICIALS TELL NBC THAT THEY

1335
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
FOUND A PHONE CHARGER IN THE

1336
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
ROOM THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE

1337
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
GUNMAN'S CELL PHONE.

1338
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
IN ADDITION, RECORDS SHOW

1339
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
SOMEBODY ELSE DID ACCESS THAT

1340
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
ROOM WHILE HIS CAR WAS GONE.

1341
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
THERE COULD BE A FEW

1342
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS.

1343
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW THE

1344
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
CORRECT ONE YET.

1345
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
THIS DEVELOPMENT AS

1346
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO
DETERMINE WHY THE GUNMAN FIRED

1347
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
ON A COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL

1348
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
KILLING 58 AND INJURING MORE

1349
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
THAN 400.

1350
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
DAN SPRINGER LIVE IN VEGAS THIS

1351
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
AFTERNOON.
DAN?

1352
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
>> SHEP, STILL NO CLEAR MOTIVE.

1353
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
THERE'S A NEWS CONFERENCE IN

1354
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

1355
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE YESTERDAY.

1356
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
SO WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS,

1357
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
A PICTURE IS EMERGING OF STEPHEN

1358
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
PADDOCK THAT PAYMENTS HIM AS A

1359
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
LOSER, ALONER THAT WOULD GO TO

1360
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
PROSTITUTES.

1361
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
PROSTITUTES HAVE BEEN TALKING TO

1362
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
HIM AND HE WAS CHEAP AND NEVER

1363
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
SHOWED EMOTION WHILE HE WAS WITH

1364
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
THEM.

1365
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
IT APPEARS THE MYSTERY WOMAN

1366
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
THAT HE WAS SEEN WITH GAMBLING

1367
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING WAS A

1368
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
HOOKER.

1369
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
HIS GIRLFRIEND SAID THAT HE

1370
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT IN RECENT

1371
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
WEEKS AND BECAME OBSESSED WITH

1372
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
MARILOU DANLEY'S EX-HUSBAND.

1373
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
BUT SHE TOLD POLICE SHE HAD NO

1374
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING MASS

1375
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
MURDER.

1376
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
THE CAR AT MANDALAY BAY HAD 50

1377
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
POUNDS OF TANNERITE AND

1378
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
AMMUNITION AND FERTILIZER.

1379
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
AND THERE'S NOW REPORTS THAT

1380
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
PADDOCK TRIED TO BUY TRACER

1381
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
AMMUNITION AT A PHOENIX GUN

1382
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
SHOW.
HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE

1383
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
THE GUN DEALER WAS SOLD OUT BUT

1384
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS

1385
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
RECORDING THAT HE HAD 1,000

1386
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
TRACER ROUNDS BUT DIDN'T USE

1387
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
THEM.

1388
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
TRACERS COULD HAVE MADE THIS

1389
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
SHOOTING MORE DEADLY, MORE

1390
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
ACCURATE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE

1391
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE

1392
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
ROUNDS WERE GOING.

1393
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
THAT RAPID FIRE HAIL OF BULLETS

1394
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
LASTED TEN MINUTES.

1395
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
WE JUST INTERVIEWED AN OFF DUTY

1396
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
EMT THAT WAS AT THE CONCERT WITH

1397
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
HIS WIFE.

1398
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
HE USED HIS BELT AS A TOURNIQUET

1399
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
ON A MAN'S LEG AND CARRIED

1400
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
SEVERAL TO A TENT INCLUDING A

1401
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
WOMAN SHOT IN THE BACK.

1402
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
THE EMT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SIDE

1403
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
THE WOMAN WHO HE'S RESCUED AND

1404
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
SAVED AT THE HOSPITAL.

1405
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
HE FEELS LIKE HE'S FAMILY WITH

1406
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
THEM JUST EMOTIONAL STORIES, ONE

1407
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
AFTER THE OTHER.

1408
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
>> Shepard: THANKS, DAN.

1409

STORMS THAT SLAMMED TEXAS AND

1460
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000

00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
The only egg that

1647
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
gives you so much more:

1648
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Better taste.

1649
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Better nutrition.

1650
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Better eggs.

1651
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Better nutrition.
I count on my Dell Small
Business Advisor,

1652
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
for tech advice.

1653
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
With one phone call,

1654
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I get products that suit my
needs,

1655
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
and I get back to business.

1656
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Woman: For the holidays,

1657
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
we get a gift for mom and dad.

1658
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And every year,
we split it equally.

1659
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Except for one of us.

1660
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I write them a poem instead.

1661
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And one for each of you too.
Woman:
Cool.

1662
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That actually yours...
That one. Yeah.

1663
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Regardless, we're
stuck with the bill.

1664
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
To many, words are the
most valuable currency.

1665
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Last I checked,
stores don't take words.

1666
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Man:
Some do. Oh.
(Alert beeps)

1667
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Not everyone can
be the poetic voice
of a generation.

1668
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I know, right?
Such a burden.

1669
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Settle up with your friends
on October 17th

1670
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
with the Bank of America
Mobile Banking App.

1671
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
>> Shepard: ON THIS DAY BACK IN

1672
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
1979, POPE JOHN PAUL II WAS THE

1673
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
FIRST POPE TO VISIT THE WHITE

1674
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
HOUSE.
HE ARRIVED IN D.C. IN AN

1675
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
OPEN-TOP LIMO.

1676
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
HE MET JIMMY CARTER, THE FIRST

1677
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
LADY AND THEIR DAUGHTER, AMY.

1678
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH THE CROWD ON

1679
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
THE SOUTH LAWN.

1680
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
THE POPE VISITED SIX CITIES ON

1681
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
THAT TRIP TO THE UNITED STATES.

1682
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
THE CROWDS WERE SO BIG, "TIME"

1683
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
MAGAZINE CALLED HIM -- I SHOULD

1684
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
SAY JOHN PAUL SUPERSTAR.

1685
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
THE POPE WOULD SURVIVE A

1686
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
SHOOTING AND BECAME A SAINT

1687
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
AFTER A PRESIDENT FIRST WELCOMED

1688
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
THE PONTIFF TO THE WHITE HOUSE

1689
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
38 YEARS AGO TODAY.

1690
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000

01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000

CHANGES EVERYTHING ON FOX NEWS

1693
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
CHANNEL.

1694
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
THE MARKETS ARE OFF A TAD BIT

1695
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
TODAY.

1696
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
THIS HAS BEEN THE CALM.

1697
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
THE STORM IS NEXT.

1698
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
"YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL CAVUTO IS

1699
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
NEXT.

1700
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

1701
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
SHEP, WE'RE AWAITING A POLICE

1705

1709
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
