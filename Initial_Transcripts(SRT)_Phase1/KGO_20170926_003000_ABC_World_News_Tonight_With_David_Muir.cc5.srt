HAVE CALLED FOR AN OPEN AND

363
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
BIPARTISAN PROCESS, BUT THIS IS

364
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE ONE AND ONLY PUBLIC HEARING
ON THE LATEST PLAN.

365
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
THE WITNESS LIST, MOSTLY

366
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, NOT
AVERAGE AMERICANS.

367
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
>> IT'S A FRAUD.

368
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
IT'S A FAKE.

369
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
IT'S JUST A FACADE.

370
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
THEY DON'T WANT US TO TESTIFY.
THEY DON'T WANT US TO BE HERE.

371
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
>> Reporter: EARLIER TODAY, EVEN

372
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO

373
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
ACKNOWLEDGE DEFEAT.
>> WE HAVE 52 VOTES, SO, WE

374
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
CAN'T LOSE ANY VOTES.

375
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I MEAN, PRACTICALLY.

376
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
SO, WE'RE GOING TO LOSE TWO OR

377
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
THREE VOTES AND THAT'S THE END
OF THAT.

378
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
>> BOTTOM LINE, MARY BRUCE LIVE

379
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
ON THE HILL, MARY, FIRST OF ALL,

380
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
DOES THIS APPEAR TO BE DEAD,

381
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
THIS EFFORT TONIGHT?
AND WE ALSO KNOW THEY'VE BEEN

382
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
TRYING TO DO THIS FOR SEVEN

383
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
YEARS, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS.

384
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THEY WANTED TO DO THIS WITH A

385
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
SIMPLE MAJORITY, NOW THAT WILL
NO LONGER BE AN OPTION?

386
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
>> Reporter: WELL, DAVID, RIGHT

387
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
NOW, THIS BILL IS GOING NOWHERE.

388
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WHICH MEANS IF REPUBLICANS WANT

389
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
TO OVERHAUL OBAMACARE, THEY'RE

390
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
LIKELY GOING TO HAVE TO WORK

391
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
WITH DEMOCRATS.

392
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
THEY'RE NOW GOING TO NEED 60

393
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
VOTES, EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

394
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
REPUBLICANS STILL CAN'T AGREE ON
A PATH FORWARD.

395
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
THE DIVIDES WITHIN THE

396
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
REPUBLICAN PARTY SEEM SIMPLY TOO

397
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
DEEP RIGHT NOW FOR THEM TO
FULFILL THEIR SIGNATURE PROMISE

398
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
DAVID?

399
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
>> ALL RIGHT, MARY.
NOW IT BECOMES A TEST FOR BOTH

400
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000

634
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
PASSENGERS HAVING TO ESCAPE.
WE'LL BE BACK.
With my moderate to severe
Crohn's disease,...

635
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
...I was always searching for
ways to manage my symptoms.

636
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Then I realized managing was
all I was doing.

637
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
When I finally told my doctor,

638
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
he said HUMIRA was for people
like me

639
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
who have tried other
medications,...

640
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but still experience the
symptoms

641
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
of moderate to severe
Crohn's disease.

642
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
In clinical studies,
the majority of patients
on HUMIRA

643
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
saw significant symptom
relief...

644
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
...and many achieved remission.

645
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
HUMIRA can lower your ability to
fight infections...

646
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
...including tuberculosis.

647
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Serious, sometimes fatal
infections and cancers,...

648
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
including lymphoma, have
happened;

649
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
as have blood, liver, and
nervous system problems,

650
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
serious allergic
reactions,...

651
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
...and new or worsening heart
failure.

652
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Before treatment, get tested
for TB.

653
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Tell your doctor if you've been
to areas

654
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
where certain fungal infections
are common,

655
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and if you've had TB,...

656
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
...hepatitis B, are prone to
infections,

657
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
...or have flu-like symptoms
or sores.

658
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Don't start HUMIRA if you have
an infection.

659
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
If you're still just managing
your symptoms,

660
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
ask your gastroenterologist
about HUMIRA.

661
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
With HUMIRA, remission
is possible.

662
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I tabut with my back paines,

663
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I couldn't sleep
and get up in time.

664
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Then I found Aleve PM.

665
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Aleve PM is the only one to
combine a safe sleep aid plus

666
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
the 12 hour pain relieving
strength of Aleve.

667
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm back.

668
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Aleve PM for a better AM.

669
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I CAN DO MORE TO LOWER MY A1C.

670
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
AND I CAN DO IT WITH
WHAT'S ALREADY WITHIN ME.

671
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
BECAUSE MY BODY CAN STILL O IIN
AND ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY
ACTIVATES MY BODY TO RELEASE IT.

672
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

675
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY

ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

WHEN USED WITH
DIET AND EXERCISE.

678
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST

OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES

680

OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.

681
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY

OR IF YOU'RE ALLERGIC

685
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

RASH, OR TROUBLE BREATHING.

SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS MAY
INCLUDE PANCREATITIS.

690
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN

691
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
INCREASES YOUR RISK
FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

692
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,

DECREASED APPETITE,
AND INDIGESTION.

694

SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,
