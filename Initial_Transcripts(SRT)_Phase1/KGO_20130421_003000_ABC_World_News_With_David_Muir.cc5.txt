[000:05:41;290] BROTHER DID ON A SIX-MONTH TRIP
[000:05:43;259] TO RUSSIA AND WHY THE FBI
[000:05:44;761] INVESTIGATED HIM TWO YEARS AGO
[000:05:45;828] AND THEN CLEARED HIM.
[000:05:47;830] ABC'S SENIOR JUSTICE

[000:05:53;236] >> GOOD EVENING, DAN.
[000:05:59;208] WITH THE MANHUNT NOW OVER, THE
[000:06:01;310] FBI IS LOOKING FOR A
[000:06:02;945] MOTIVE BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?
[000:06:03;679] WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED?
[000:06:04;380] WHERE DID THEY GET THAT
[000:06:05;048] TRAINING?
[000:06:05;515] IMMIGRANTS FROM THE RUSSIAN
[000:06:14;290] CAUCUSES, THE BROTHERS CAME WITH
[000:06:15;091] THEIR PARENTS TO THE U.S. AS
[000:06:15;825] CHILDREN.
[000:06:16;292] SEEKING REFUGEE STATUS.
[000:06:16;926] THEY THRIVED ATTENDING TOP

[000:06:18;928] STAR ATHLETE, GOLDEN GLOVE
[000:06:19;629] BOXER, PIANIST.
[000:06:23;699] YOUNGER BROTHER DZHOKHAR, 19,
[000:06:24;434] HAD JUST BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN,
[000:06:25;234] IRONICALLY, ON SEPTEMBER 11th OF
[000:06:25;968] LAST YEAR.
[000:06:26;836] ONCE A LIFEGUARD, HE WAS AN
[000:06:28;271] ALL-STATE WRESTLER AND COLLEGE
[000:06:29;038] STUDENT.
[000:06:31;107] >> I CERTAINLY CAN'T PUT IT
[000:06:32;542] TOGETHER THAT HE WAS A PERSON
[000:06:35;945] FIRING A WEAPON AND POTENTIALLY
[000:06:36;846] KILLING PEOPLE.
[000:06:38;181] >> Reporter: LAST NIGHT THE FBI
[000:06:39;682] ACKNOWLEDGED IT INTERVIEWED
[000:06:41;617] TAMERLAN IN 2011 BASED ON A TIP
[000:06:42;785] FROM THE RUSSIANS.

[000:06:46;155] RADICAL ISLAMIST, PREPARING TO
[000:06:47;590] LEAVE THE U.S., POSSIBLY FOR A
[000:06:55;298] TRIP TO THE CAUCUSES.
[000:06:56;699] AFTER LOOKING INTO TAMERLAN'S
[000:06:57;433] PHONE RECORDS, WEBSITES HE
[000:06:58;167] VISITED AND ASSOCIATES, THE FBI
[000:06:58;935] FOUND NO TIES TO TERRORISTS.
[000:06:59;669] BY LAW, FBI OFFICIALS SAID,
[000:07:00;470] MONITORING HAD TO STOP, BARRING
[000:07:01;537] NEW NEGATIVE INFORMATION.
[000:07:03;272] >> TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS
[000:07:05;541] COUNTRY, JUST LIKE HIM, THAT ARE
[000:07:07;543] TOUCHING EXTREMIST WEBSITES,
[000:07:08;945] THAT ARE ESPOUSING THINGS THAT
[000:07:10;046] AREN'T PARTICULARLY KIND TO
[000:07:14;050] AMERICANS, BUT THAT'S NOT
[000:07:14;951] AGAINST THE LAW HERE.
[000:07:16;052] >> Reporter: TAMERLAN'S FATHER
[000:07:17;186] SAID HIS SONS COULDN'T HAVE
[000:07:18;921] PLANNED THE ATTACK, BECAUSE THEY
[000:07:21;157] KNEW THE FBI WAS WATCHING THEM.
[000:07:22;291] BUT THEY APPARENTLY WERE NOT.
[000:07:24;060] AND NEVER KNEW THAT A DARK SIDE
[000:07:25;728] OF THE TWO BROTHERS HAD BEGUN TO
[000:07:26;496] EMERGE.
[000:07:28;564] TAMERLAN WAS CHARGED IN
[000:07:29;432] CAMBRIDGE WITH BEATING HIS
[000:07:30;833] FORMER GIRLFRIEND.

[000:07:33;402] VIDEOS, URGING JIHAD.
[000:07:38;107] ON HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL.
[000:07:41;410] AND DZHOKHAR BEGAN WRITING
[000:07:42;111] BIZARRE TWEETS.
[000:07:43;713] "A DECADE IN AMERICA ALREADY, I
[000:07:45;381] WANT OUT."
[000:07:51;954] AUTHORITIES NEVER SAW THIS
[000:07:52;655] COMING.
[000:07:55;892] TAMERLAN TRAVELED TO RUSSIA FOR
[000:07:56;692] SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR.
[000:07:57;326] THE FBI WANTS TO KNOW EXACTLY
[000:07:58;060] WHO HE SAW AND WHAT HE WAS
[000:07:58;761] DOING, DAN.

[000:08:04;233] YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE FBI
[000:08:05;001] ALL DAY.
[000:08:05;635] ARE THEY NOT EXPECTING ANY SENSE
[000:08:06;402] OF FRUSTRATION OR REMORSE OVER
[000:08:07;170] HAVING MISSED WHAT COULD HAVE
[000:08:07;904] BEEN A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE?
[000:08:14;710] >> THEY'LL DO A POSTMORTEM,
[000:08:17;547] WHICH IS NORMAL IN THESE CASES,
[000:08:19;415] BUT THEY SAID THEY DID WHAT THE
[000:08:20;216] LOU AND THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS.
[000:08:20;950] >> PIERRE, THANK YOU.
[000:08:21;584] >>> AND IN ORDER TO DIG DEEPER

[000:09:55;678] MARTHA RADDATZ.
[000:09:56;212] MARTHA, THANKS FOR COMING IN.
[000:09:57;046] WE APPRECIATE IT.
[000:09:59;315] LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OLDER
[000:10:00;016] BROTHER'S TRIP TO RUSSIA.
[000:10:00;750] WE KNOW THERE ARE ISLAMIC
[000:10:01;851] MILITANTS IN THIS PART OF
[000:10:02;985] RUSSIA, BUT DO THESE PEOPLE HAVE
[000:10:05;821] ANY HISTORY OF ATTACKING
[000:10:06;522] AMERICA?
[000:10:07;523] >> NOT THE CHECHENS.
[000:10:08;424] THEY HAVE NO HISTORY OF
[000:10:13;529] ATTACKING THE AMERICA.
[000:10:14;130] WHAT INVESTIGATORS WILL WANT TO
[000:10:14;897] FIND OUT IS WHETHER HE WENT TO
[000:10:15;831] SOME SORT OF TRAINING CAMP, SOME
[000:10:18;034] RADICAL TRAINING CAMP THAT DID
[000:10:19;201] HAVE A BEEF WITH AMERICA.
[000:10:22;305] WHO FUNDED HIM, IF HE HAD ANY
[000:10:23;072] SORT OF EXTRA FUNDING.
[000:10:24;607] DID HE LEARN HOW TO BUILD THOSE
[000:10:27;176] BOMBS THERE, OR DID HE BUILD
[000:10:28;044] THEM ON THE INTERNET?
[000:10:31;714] THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL BE LOOKING
[000:10:32;481] AT AND THEY WILL INTERVIEW
[000:10:35;818] EVERYBODY THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO
[000:10:36;585] SEE WHERE THOSE DARK MONTHS LED.
[000:10:37;353] >> IF THEY RULE OUT SOME SORT OF
[000:10:38;120] FOREIGN PLOT, AND THAT'S A BIG
[000:10:38;854] IF AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD MAKE
[000:10:41;524] THESE TWO BROTHERS, ASSUMING
[000:10:42;258] THEY'RE PROVEN TO BE GUILTY, IT
[000:10:46;662] WOULD MAKE THEM LONE WOLVES,
[000:10:47;496] WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT, HAS
[000:10:49;165] BEEN KEEPING UP NATIONAL
[000:10:50;032] SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE MIDDLE
[000:10:50;833] OF THE NIGHT FOR YEARS NOW.
[000:10:52;034] >> YES, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ONE
[000:10:54;570] LONE WOLF, WHO THEY BELIEVE
[000:10:55;471] PROBABLY CONVINCED HIS BROTHER
[000:10:57;173] TO BE ANOTHER ONE, THEN YOU
[000:10:58;307] DON'T KNOW WHERE THE REST OF
[000:10:59;175] THEM ARE.
[000:11:01;143] WHAT WILL INSPIRE THEM, HOW THEY
[000:11:03;979] MIGHT GET RADICALIZED.
[000:11:05;114] THAT'S A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO.

[000:14:35;491] STAYING ACTIVE CAN ACTUALLY
[000:14:35;491] EASE ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS.
[000:14:38;460] BUT IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS,
[000:14:39;862] STAYING ACTIVE
[000:14:39;862] CAN BE DIFFICULT.
[000:14:41;964] PRESCRIPTION CELEBREX
[000:14:41;964] CAN HELP RELIEVE ARTHRITIS PAIN
[000:14:44;633] SO YOUR BODY
[000:14:44;633] CAN STAY IN MOTION.
[000:14:46;502] BECAUSE JUST ONE
[000:14:46;502] 200MG CELEBREX A DAY
[000:14:49;305] CAN PROVIDE 24 HOUR RELIEF
[000:14:51;473] FOR MANY WITH ARTHRITIS PAIN
[000:14:51;473] AND INFLAMMATION.
[000:14:54;143] PLUS, IN CLINICAL STUDIES,
[000:14:55;578] CELEBREX IS PROVEN TO IMPROVE
[000:14:55;578] DAILY PHYSICAL FUNCTION
[000:14:58;047] SO MOVING IS EASIER.
[000:14:59;715] CELEBREX CAN BE TAKEN
[000:14:59;715] WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD.
[000:15:02;518] AND IT'S NOT A NARCOTIC.
[000:15:04;453] YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR
[000:15:04;453] SHOULD BALANCE THE BENEFITS
[000:15:06;121] WITH THE RISKS.
[000:15:07;556] ALL PRESCRIPTION NSAIDS,
[000:15:07;556] LIKE CELEBREX, IBUPROFEN,
[000:15:10;092] NAPROXEN AND MELOXICAM
[000:15:11;260] HAVE THE SAME
[000:15:11;260] CARDIOVASCULAR WARNING.
[000:15:13;596] THEY ALL MAY INCREASE
[000:15:13;596] THE CHANCE
[000:15:15;064] OF HEART ATTACK OR STROKE,
[000:15:15;064] WHICH CAN LEAD TO DEATH.
[000:15:17;666] THIS CHANCE INCREASES
[000:15:17;666] IF YOU HAVE HEART DISEASE
[000:15:19;501] OR RISK FACTORS
[000:15:19;501] SUCH AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
[000:15:21;770] OR WHEN NSAIDS ARE TAKEN
[000:15:21;770] FOR LONG PERIODS.
[000:15:23;872] NSAIDS, LIKE CELEBREX,
[000:15:25;441] INCREASE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS
[000:15:25;441] SKIN OR ALLERGIC REACTIONS
[000:15:27;743] OR STOMACH AND INTESTINE
[000:15:27;743] PROBLEMS,
[000:15:29;311] SUCH AS BLEEDING AND ULCERS,
[000:15:30;713] WHICH CAN OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
[000:15:30;713] AND MAY CAUSE DEATH.
[000:15:33;215] PATIENTS ALSO TAKING ASPIRIN
[000:15:33;215] AND THE ELDERLY
[000:15:34;950] ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR
[000:15:34;950] STOMACH BLEEDING AND ULCERS.
[000:15:37;052] DON'T TAKE CELEBREX
[000:15:38;520] IF YOU HAVE BLEEDING
[000:15:38;520] IN THE STOMACH OR INTESTINE,
[000:15:40;556] OR HAD AN ASTHMA ATTACK, HIVES,
[000:15:41;957] OTHER ALLERGIES TO ASPIRIN,

[000:15:44;493] SWELLING OF THE FACE OR THROAT,
[000:15:46;996] OR TROUBLE BREATHING.

[000:15:48;197] YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY.
[000:15:49;865] AND FIND AN ARTHRITIS TREATMENT
[000:15:49;865] FOR YOU.
[000:15:52;401] VISIT CELEBREX.COM AND ASK
[000:15:52;401] YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CELEBREX.
[000:15:56;138] FOR A BODY IN MOTION.

[000:16:14;189] constipation,
[000:16:15;758] Miralax or Metamucil may take
[000:16:15;758] days to work.
[000:16:17;926] For faster relief, try Dulcolax
[000:16:17;926] laxative tablets.
[000:16:20;529] Dulcolax provides gentle relief
[000:16:20;529] overnight unlike Miralax
[000:16:23;465] and Metamucil that can take up
[000:16:23;465] to 3 days.
