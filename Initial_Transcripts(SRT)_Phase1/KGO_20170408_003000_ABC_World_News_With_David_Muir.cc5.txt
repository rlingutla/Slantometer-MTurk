[000:00:22;138] WE HAVE NEW DETAILS FROM INSIDE
[000:00:25;241] THE WAR ROOM.
[000:00:26;076] >>> AND THE WARNING FROM RUSSIA
[000:00:27;277] NOW, AND THEIR MESSAGE FOR
[000:00:28;411] PRESIDENT TRUMP.
[000:00:28;778] THE HEADLINE LATE TODAY.

[000:00:34;050] AGAIN FROM THAT AIRBASE THE U.S.
[000:00:34;684] BOMBED.
[000:00:38;154] >>> ALSO BREAKING TONIGHT, THE
[000:00:39;322] DEADLY TERROR ATTACK.
[000:00:42;892] A TRUCK BARRELING RIGHT INTO A

[000:00:43;993] RUNNING DOWN VICTIMS.
[000:00:44;994] THE GLOBAL BULLETIN.

[000:00:46;229] AND LATE WORD NOW OF AN ARREST.
[000:00:47;564] WE'RE ON THE SCENE IN SWEDEN.
[000:00:51;334] >>> THE NATIONWIDE MANHUNT HERE
[000:00:51;968] AT HOME.
[000:00:53;803] SCHOOLS SHUT DOWN.
[000:00:54;204] A SUSPECT CONSIDERED "EXTREMELY
[000:00:56;940] DANGEROUS."
[000:00:57;240] POLICE SAY HE MADE THIS VIDEO
[000:00:58;074] MAILING A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT
[000:00:59;542] TRUMP.
[000:01:00;577] >>> AND THE PICTURES COMING IN
[000:01:02;078] NOW.
[000:01:03;279] THE FIRES BREAKING OUT ALONG
[000:01:04;748] THIS HIGHWAY IN FLORIDA DURING
[000:01:06;082] SPRING BREAK.
[000:01:06;416] THOUSANDS OF ACRES ALREADY
[000:01:14;090] >>> GOOD EVENING.
[000:01:15;158] IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
[000:01:18;795] HERE ON A VERY BUSY FRIDAY
[000:01:19;362] NIGHT.
[000:01:20;830] WE'RE GETTING A MUCH CLEARER
[000:01:21;431] PICTURE OF WHAT LED TO PRESIDENT
[000:01:22;065] TRUMP'S ORDER TO TAKE MILITARY
[000:01:23;433] ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.
[000:01:26;035] LAST NIGHT, THE WORLD SAW THE
[000:01:32;308] MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA, MORE
[000:01:33;343] THAN 50 TOMAHAWK MISSILES FIRED.
[000:01:38;114] IT CAME JUST TWO DAYS AFTER THE
[000:01:43;186] HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK ON
[000:01:43;753] FAMILIES, SO MANY CHILDREN AMONG
[000:01:44;387] THE VICTIMS.
[000:01:45;255] OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE PROOF
[000:01:45;855] THE PLANE THAT DROPPED THAT
[000:01:50;093] TOXIC GAS WAS A SYRIAN FIGHTER
[000:01:53;129] JET THAT TOOK OFF FROM THIS
[000:01:54;097] BASE.
[000:01:57;400] AND NOW, WORD THAT SYRIAN PLANES
[000:01:58;802] ARE TAKING OFF FROM THAT
[000:01:59;836] AIRFIELD ALL OVER AGAIN.
[000:02:05;041] HERE'S MARTHA RADDATZ, LEADING
[000:02:05;675] US OFF.
[000:02:11;281] >> Reporter: UNDER THE COVER OF
[000:02:11;915] DARKNESS, DOZENS OF U.S.
[000:02:14;083] TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILES FIRED
[000:02:17;020] INTO SYRIA FROM TWO NAVY
[000:02:18;087] WARSHIPS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.
[000:02:19;088] RAINING DOWN ON THE SHAYRAT
[000:02:20;657] AIRBASE, WHERE THE SYRIAN PLANE
[000:02:24;260] CARRYING THOSE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
[000:02:24;894] HAD TAKEN OFF.
[000:02:28;998] THE CRUISE MISSILES ALREADY
[000:02:29;566] LAUNCHED AS THE PRESIDENT WAS
[000:02:31;100] WRAPPING UP HIS FIRST DINNER
[000:02:32;635] WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT AT
[000:02:34;070] MAR-A-LAGO.
[000:02:38;107] HOURS EARLIER, ABOARD AIR FORCE
[000:02:38;741] ONE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD
[000:02:39;876] SIGNALED TO THE WORLD THAT
[000:02:42;111] MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA
[000:02:42;712] WAS A STRONG POSSIBILITY.
[000:02:47;684] >> I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN
[000:02:48;251] SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.
[000:02:51;354] AND HE'S THERE, AND I GUESS HE'S
[000:02:51;988] RUNNING THINGS.
[000:02:54;090] SO SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN.
[000:02:55;992] >> Reporter: SOON AFTER LANDING
[000:02:57;360] IN FLORIDA, THE PRESIDENT WOULD
[000:02:58;628] GIVE HIS COMMANDERS THE GREEN
[000:03:00;196] LIGHT.
[000:03:00;396] THE PENTAGON USING MILITARY
[000:03:01;731] CHANNELS TO LET THE RUSSIANS
[000:03:06;102] KNOW, THIS WAS NOT AN ATTACK ON
[000:03:07;437] THEIR TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT IN
[000:03:09;372] SYRIA.
[000:03:13;309] SYRIAN TELEVISION SHOWING WHAT
[000:03:19;215] IT SAID WAS THE U.S. ASSAULT IN
[000:03:21;618] THE DISTANCE.
[000:03:24;020] SYRIAN OFFICIALS CLAIMING AT
[000:03:28;691] LEAST SEVEN WERE KILLED.
[000:03:29;759] THE PENTAGON SAYS IT STRUCK ALL
[000:03:30;393] 59 OF ITS TARGETS.
[000:03:30;793] DESTROYING AT LEAST 20 SYRIAN
[000:03:31;394] AIRCRAFT, AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS,
[000:03:32;328] RADAR AND AMMUNITION SUPPLY
[000:03:32;896] BUNKERS.
[000:03:33;363] ONCE THOSE MISSILES FELL, THE
[000:03:33;963] PRESIDENT HUDDLED WITH HIS
[000:03:35;465] NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM TO ASSESS
[000:03:36;099] THE DAMAGE.
[000:03:42;071] THE RETALIATION COMING JUST 60
[000:03:42;705] HOURS AFTER THE WORLD SAW THE
[000:03:44;807] FIRST HORRIFIC IMAGES OF THAT
[000:03:45;408] CHEMICAL ATTACK, IMAGES THAT
[000:03:49;012] PUSHED THE PRESIDENT TO ACT.
[000:03:50;079] >> TONIGHT, I ORDERED A TARGETED
[000:03:52;615] MILITARY STRIKE ON THE AIRFIELD
[000:03:58;087] IN SYRIA FROM WHERE THE CHEMICAL
[000:03:58;855] ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED.
[000:04:00;390] >> Reporter: THE PENTAGON
[000:04:02;492] PROVIDING EVIDENCE IT SAYS SHOWS
[000:04:04;560] ASSAD WAS BEHIND THE WAR CRIME.
[000:04:06;629] THE FLIGHT PATH DATA OF THE
[000:04:08;231] SYRIAN WARPLANE.
[000:04:12;402] AND TONIGHT, THE U.S. MILITARY
[000:04:13;436] LOOKING INTO WHETHER THE
[000:04:14;170] RUSSIANS KNEW ABOUT THAT
[000:04:17;040] CHEMICAL ATTACK OR ASSISTED IN
[000:04:17;674] ANY WAY.
[000:04:20;176] TODAY AT THE UNITED NATIONS,
[000:04:20;777] AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY WARNED
[000:04:23;279] THAT THE U.S. COULD STRIKE
[000:04:23;846] AGAIN.
[000:04:25;348] >> THE UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
[000:04:29;585] MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.
[000:04:30;119] WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE.
[000:04:32;155] >> SO LET'S BRING IN MARTHA,
[000:04:33;389] LIVE IN WASHINGTON.
[000:04:35;224] WE'RE LEARNING TONIGHT AS WE
[000:04:35;825] COME ON THAT THE RUSSIANS HAVE
[000:04:37;327] SUSPENDED THE HOTLINE THAT HAD
[000:04:39;362] BEEN SET UP BETWEEN THE RUSSIANS
[000:04:44;600] AND THE PENTAGON INVOLVING
[000:04:45;168] AIRCRAFT OVER SYRIA?
[000:04:46;669] >> Reporter: THE HOTLINE WAS SET
[000:04:47;303] UP TO DECONFLICT THE AIRCRAFT
[000:04:50;073] FLYING MISSIONS OVER SYRIA, SO
[000:04:51;374] THE U.S. AND RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT
[000:04:52;909] DON'T RUN INTO EACH OTHER.
[000:04:55;011] BUT THERE ARE RADARS AND OTHER
[000:04:56;546] BACKUPS.
[000:04:56;779] SO THERE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF
[000:04:57;413] CONCERN.
[000:05:01;250] BUT ANOTHER SIGN, THE RUSSIANS
[000:05:02;085] ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE AMERICAN
[000:05:03;386] ATTACKS ON SYRIA.
[000:05:03;820] >> MARTHA, THANK YOU.
[000:05:06;456] >>> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THIS
[000:05:07;991] WAS A CAREFULLY TARGETED STRIKE,
[000:05:10;093] AIMED TO SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE.
[000:05:19;969] I WANT TO BRING IN RETIRED
[000:05:21;004] COLONEL STEPHEN GANYARD, WHO HAS
[000:05:21;637] FLOWN OVER THAT REGION.
[000:05:22;138] 59 TOMAHAWK MISSILES WERE
[000:05:22;672] LAUNCHED FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN,
[000:05:23;606] AND GUIDED BY ADVANCED
[000:05:24;107] NAVIGATION SYSTEMS TO AVOID
[000:05:24;674] DETECTION?
[000:05:33;383] >> THAT'S RIGHT.
[000:05:33;750] THE MISSILES DROP DOWN LOW.
[000:05:44;460] THEY FLEW OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN
[000:05:45;094] SEA FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 30
[000:05:46;095] MINUTES AND AN HOUR.
[000:05:46;963] AND PROBABLY CAME ASHORE OVER
[000:05:50;099] LEBANON TO AVOID SOME OF THE
[000:05:51;134] SURFACE TO AIR MISSILE SYSTEMS
[000:05:52;702] THE RUSSIANS HAVE IN THE
[000:05:53;236] NORTHWEST OF THE COUNTRY.
[000:05:53;770] AND WENT NORTH, WENT AFTER 59
[000:05:54;370] CAREFULLY PICKED TARGETS AROUND
[000:05:55;304] THE AIRFIELD.
[000:05:55;638] >> JUST 30 TO 40 MINUTES,
[000:05:56;372] INCREDIBLE SPEED.
[000:05:56;873] AND TAKE US DEEPER INTO THE
[000:06:03;146] MILITARY CHOICE THEY MADE HERE.
[000:06:03;780] WE KNOW PRESIDENT OBAMA
[000:06:05;181] CONSIDERED MILITARY ACTION AFTER
[000:06:05;815] THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN 2013.
[000:06:06;382] PARTS OF THAT PLAN WERE FAR MORE
[000:06:07;817] INVOLVED THAN WHAT WE SAW
[000:06:09;452] OVERNIGHT.
[000:06:10;086] >> THE PENTAGON OFFERED
[000:06:13;056] PRESIDENT TRUMP SEVERAL CHOICES.
[000:06:14;123] HE COULD GO WITH A LARGE STRIKE
[000:06:19;195] WITH A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN, OR
[000:06:20;763] SOMETHING VERY FOCUSED THAT
[000:06:21;330] WOULD SEND A MESSAGE.
[000:06:21;798] HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT OVERTHROW
[000:06:22;899] ASSAD, BUT WAS MAKING A VERY
[000:06:26;069] CLEAR STATEMENT, SAYING YOU NEED
[000:06:27;537] TO STOP GASSING YOUR PEOPLE, OR
[000:06:30;106] WE'LL BE BACK IN A BIG WAY.
[000:06:33;476] >> COLONEL GANYARD, THANK YOU.
[000:06:34;410] >>> AND THIS EVENING, WE'RE ALSO
[000:06:35;845] LEARNING WHO WAS IN THE WAR ROOM
[000:06:36;479] AS THIS UNFOLDED.
[000:06:38;981] PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HOSTING
[000:06:39;549] CHINA'S PRESIDENT.
[000:06:40;550] AND WE HAVE LEARNED THE MOMENT
[000:06:45;488] HE TOLD PRESIDENT XI WHAT WAS
[000:06:46;089] HAPPENING.
[000:06:46;789] JONATHAN KARL HAS THE STORY.
[000:06:49;892] >> Reporter: THAT IMAGE OF THE
[000:06:50;526] PRESIDENT GETTING HIS FIRST
[000:06:51;527] REPORTS ON THE SYRIAN AIR
[000:06:53;029] STRIKES.
[000:06:54;063] A PORTRAIT OF A NEW COMMANDER IN
[000:06:55;631] CHIEF AND HIS NATIONAL SECURITY
[000:06:56;265] TEAM.
[000:06:57;467] AT THE TABLE, HIS SON-IN-LAW
[000:06:58;201] JARED KUSHNER.
[000:07:00;336] ALSO PRESENT, BUT TAKING A BACK
[000:07:01;337] SEAT, RECENTLY DEMOTED CHIEF
[000:07:02;905] STRATEGIST STEVE BANNON.
[000:07:06;142] THE PHOTO EDITED.
[000:07:08;611] THE PAPERS MADE BLANK, TO
[000:07:09;445] PROTECT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[000:07:12;315] IT'S A REMARKABLE TURN FOR A MAN
[000:07:12;949] WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY URGED AN
[000:07:14;884] AMERICA FIRST APPROACH TO WAR
[000:07:15;885] AND PEACE.
[000:07:17;453] SYRIA, HE ONCE SAID, IS NOT
[000:07:18;020] AMERICA'S PROBLEM.
[000:07:21;090] BUT THIS WEEK, THE PRESIDENT SAW
[000:07:21;724] THOSE IMAGES.
[000:07:23;693] THE HORRORS OF CHILDREN HIT WITH
[000:07:24;327] DEADLY NERVE GAS.
[000:07:27;497] >> I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK
[000:07:28;898] ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY HAD A BIG
[000:07:29;532] IMPACT ON ME.
[000:07:32;568] BIG IMPACT.
[000:07:33;469] >> Reporter: IN TAKING THIS
[000:07:34;036] ACTION, TRUMP SEEMED MORE LIKE
[000:07:37;206] HILLARY CLINTON, WHO HAD URGED
[000:07:37;840] PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ACT IN SYRIA.
[000:07:39;475] AND JUST HOURS BEFORE TRUMP
[000:07:40;843] ORDERED THE AIR STRIKES, MRS.
[000:07:42;111] CLINTON BASICALLY ENDORSED THE
[000:07:43;980] MOVE AGAINST BASHAR AL ASSAD.
[000:07:48;651] >> I REALLY BELIEVE THAT WE
[000:07:50;086] SHOULD HAVE AND STILL SHOULD
[000:07:54;357] TAKE OUT HIS AIRFIELDS AND
[000:07:56;459] PREVENT HIM FROM BEING ABLE TO
[000:07:57;493] USE THEM TO BOMB INNOCENT PEOPLE
[000:08:00;630] AND DROP SARIN GAS ON THEM.
[000:08:01;197] SO --
[000:08:05;301] >> Reporter: THE AIR STRIKE
[000:08:06;102] COMES AMID NEW PROVOCATIONS FROM
[000:08:08;404] NORTH KOREA, AND ON THE SAME DAY
[000:08:09;038] TRUMP WAS MEETING WITH CHINA'S
[000:08:10;106] PRESIDENT XI JINPING.
[000:08:12;575] AT THE END OF THEIR FORMAL
[000:08:14;110] DINNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP INFORMED
[000:08:15;211] PRESIDENT XI ABOUT HIS MILITARY
[000:08:15;845] ATTACK.
[000:08:18;080] NOT LONG AGO, TRUMP CALLED CHINA
[000:08:19;348] A JOB-KILLING ENEMY OF AMERICA.
[000:08:21;484] TODAY, THAT TALK WAS GONE.
[000:08:25;054] REPLACED BY SOMETHING CLOSER TO
[000:08:25;688] FRIENDSHIP.
[000:08:27;490] >> THE RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPED BY
[000:08:30;760] PRESIDENT XI AND MYSELF I THINK
[000:08:33;362] IS OUTSTANDING.
[000:08:33;729] WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING
[000:08:35;965] TOGETHER MANY TIMES IN THE
[000:08:36;532] FUTURE.
[000:08:37;533] >> Reporter: BUT THE
[000:08:38;000] ADMINISTRATION'S TONE IS ALSO
[000:08:38;601] CHANGING TOWARDS ANOTHER WORLD
[000:08:41;170] POWER -- RUSSIA.
[000:08:42;138] CANDIDATE TRUMP OFTEN TALKED OF
[000:08:45;308] PARTNERING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN.
[000:08:45;942] BUT NOW SECRETARY OF STATE REX
[000:08:47;410] TILLERSON BLAMED RUSSIA IN PART
[000:08:50;079] FOR THE ACTIONS OF ITS ALLY
[000:08:51;447] SYRIA, SAYING RUSSIA WAS EITHER

[000:08:54;283] P JUST INCOMPETENT.A TH THE

[000:09:08;331] HE'S HEADING TO RUSSIA NEXT
[000:09:08;898] WEEK?
[000:09:15;004] >> Reporter: YES, THIS WILL BE
[000:09:15;638] THE HIGHEST-LEVEL TRUMP OFFICIAL
[000:09:18;074] TO VISIT MOSCOW YET.
[000:09:21;210] AND THE BIG TEST OVER WHETHER
[000:09:21;811] THIS DISAGREEMENT WILL END HOPES
[000:09:22;812] OF A WARMER RELATIONSHIP WITH
[000:09:25;348] VLADIMIR PUTIN.
[000:09:26;082] >> JON, THANK YOU.
[000:09:26;949] >>> AND TONIGHT, RUSSIA, WITH A
[000:09:30;052] WARNING FOR THE UNITED STATES.
[000:09:31;587] AND A MESSAGE AIMED AT PRESIDENT
[000:09:33;456] TRUMP.
[000:09:34;190] RUSSIAN OFFICIALS CALLING WHAT
[000:09:36;325] THEY SAW LAST NIGHT, A CLEAR ACT
[000:09:36;959] OF AGGRESSION.
[000:09:38;894] TESTING WHAT JON JUST POINTED
[000:09:41;497] OUT, HOPE FOR A BETTER
[000:09:42;098] RELATIONSHIP WITH VLADIMIR
[000:09:42;665] PUTIN.
[000:09:45;468] HERE'S BRIAN ROSS.
[000:09:47;203] >> Reporter: THE RUSSIAN
[000:09:48;738] PROPAGANDA MACHINE IS WORKING
[000:09:49;338] OVERTIME TONIGHT.
[000:09:54;110] RUSSIAN TV OUTLETS QUICKLY
[000:09:54;677] DISTRIBUTED THIS FOOTAGE OF WHAT
[000:09:55;311] IT CALLED THE FAILED U.S.
[000:09:56;045] ATTACK.
[000:09:58;681] A REPORTER INSIDE A FORTIFIED
[000:09:59;649] HANGAR, DAMAGED BUT STILL

[000:10:17;433] COUNTRY'S HIGH HOPES FOR DONALD

[000:20:22;371] As after a DVT blood clot,ital
[000:20:24;006] I sure had a lot
[000:20:24;006] to think about.
[000:20:25;707] What about the
[000:20:25;707] people I care about?
[000:20:27;643] ...including this little girl.
[000:20:29;444] And what if this
[000:20:29;444] happened again?
[000:20:31;713] I was given warfarin
[000:20:31;713] in the hospital,
[000:20:33;515] but wondered, was this the
[000:20:33;515] best treatment for me?
[000:20:36;151] So I asked my doctor.
[000:20:37;486] And he recommended ELIQUIS.
[000:20:39;254] ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:20:39;254] and PE blood clots
[000:20:41;990] and reduces the risk of
[000:20:41;990] them happening again.
[000:20:44;559] Yes, ELIQUIS treats DVT
[000:20:44;559] and PE blood clots.
[000:20:47;596] ELIQUIS also had
[000:20:48;897] significantly
[000:20:48;897] less major
[000:20:48;897] bleeding
[000:20:50;799] than the
[000:20:50;799] standard
[000:20:50;799] treatment.
[000:20:52;367] Both made me
[000:20:52;367] turn around my
[000:20:52;367] thinking.
[000:20:54;836] Don't stop ELIQUIS
[000:20:54;836] unless your doctor tells you to.
[000:20:56;905] ELIQUIS can cause serious and
[000:20:56;905] in rare cases fatal bleeding.
[000:21:00;108] Don't take ELIQUIS if you have
[000:21:00;108] an artificial heart valve
[000:21:02;311] or abnormal bleeding.
[000:21:03;779] If you had a spinal injection
[000:21:03;779] while on ELIQUIS
[000:21:05;847] call your doctor right away
[000:21:07;049] if you have tingling,
[000:21:07;049] numbness, or muscle weakness.
[000:21:09;151] While taking ELIQUIS,
[000:21:09;151] you may bruise more easily
[000:21:11;687] ...and it may take longer
[000:21:11;687] than usual for bleeding to stop.
[000:21:14;056] Seek immediate medical care
[000:21:14;056] for sudden signs of bleeding,
[000:21:16;391] like unusual bruising.
[000:21:17;726] ELIQUIS may increase
[000:21:17;726] your bleeding risk
[000:21:19;695] if you take
[000:21:19;695] certain medicines.
[000:21:20;929] Tell your doctor
[000:21:20;929] about all planned
[000:21:22;931] medical or dental
[000:21:22;931] procedures.
[000:21:24;399] ELIQUIS treats
[000:21:24;399] DVT and PE
[000:21:24;399] blood clots.
[000:21:27;336] Plus had
[000:21:27;336] less major
[000:21:27;336] bleeding.
[000:21:29;404] Both made ELIQUIS
[000:21:29;404] the right treatment for me.
[000:21:32;007] Ask your doctor if switching
[000:21:32;007] to ELIQUIS is right for you.

[000:21:41;049] Microsoft and its partners are

[000:21:48;523] There are over 100 million
[000:21:50;092] pieces of DNA in every sample.
[000:21:53;128] With the Microsoft Cloud,
[000:21:54;429] we can analyze the data
[000:21:56;031] faster than ever before.
[000:21:58;133] If we can detect new viruses
[000:21:59;701] before they spread,
[000:22:00;736] we may someday prevent outbreaks

[000:23:54;216] OR ADEMPAS® FOR

[000:25:15;830] products I've used.
[000:25:17;933] Enough!
[000:25:19;467] I've tried enough laxatives
[000:25:20;869] to cover
[000:25:20;869] the Eastern Seaboard.
[000:25:23;638] I've climbed a Mount Everest

[000:25:26;641] Enough!
[000:25:28;310] (AVO)
[000:25:28;310] If you've had enough,

[000:25:30;078] what you've tried
[000:25:30;078] and how long you've been at it.
[000:25:32;347] LINZESS works differently
[000:25:33;682] from laxatives.
[000:25:34;783] LINZESS treats adults
[000:25:35;884] with IBS with Constipation
[000:25:37;485] or Chronic Constipation.
[000:25:39;120] It can help
[000:25:39;120] relieve your belly pain,
[000:25:40;655] and lets you have more frequent
[000:25:40;655] and complete bowel movements
[000:25:42;824] that are easier to pass.
[000:25:44;960] Do not give LINZESS
[000:25:44;960] to children under six,
[000:25:46;861] and it should not be given
[000:25:46;861] to children
[000:25:48;063] six to less than eighteen.
[000:25:48;063] It may harm them.
[000:25:50;465] Don't take LINZESS if you have
[000:25:50;465] a bowel blockage.
[000:25:52;867] Get immediate help
[000:25:52;867] if you develop unusual
[000:25:54;736] or severe stomach pain,
[000:25:56;004] especially with bloody
[000:25:56;004] or black stools.
[000:25:58;106] The most common side effect
[000:25:58;106] is diarrhea, sometimes severe.
[000:26:01;343] If it's severe
[000:26:01;343] stop taking LINZESS
[000:26:03;278] and call your doctor right away.
[000:26:05;013] Other side effects include gas,
[000:26:06;481] stomach-area pain
[000:26:06;481] and swelling.
[000:26:08;383] Talk to your doctor about
[000:26:09;651] managing your symptoms
[000:26:10;652] proactively with LINZESS.
