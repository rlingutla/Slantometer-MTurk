[000:09:40;680] WEATHER CHANNEL HEADQUARTERS.
[000:09:41;380] HI, CHRIS.
[000:09:43;416] >> GOOD EVENING TO YOU, LESTER.
[000:09:45;885] THESE STORMS ARE STILL STRONG
[000:09:47;687] AND STILL DANGEROUS AS WE'RE
[000:09:48;387] TRACKING THEM RIGHT NOW.
[000:09:49;388] LET'S TAKE A LOOK WHERE CLOUDS
[000:09:50;122] AND RAIN ARE RIGHT NOW.
[000:09:53;726] IT'S A LINE OF STORMS THAT WE'RE
[000:09:55;328] LOOKING AT HERE, AND THIS IS
[000:09:57;029] OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HERE
[000:09:57;730] THIS AFTERNOON AND THE EVENING.
[000:09:58;698] STILL A CHANCE FOR DAMAGING
[000:10:00;166] WINDS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO DOWN
[000:10:01;867] TREES AND POWER LINES.
[000:10:05;738] ALSO LARGE HAIL, AND POSSIBLY A
[000:10:07;373] FEW TORNADOES.
[000:10:07;907] NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK
[000:10:09;508] AND SHOW YOU WHAT THE RADAR IS
[000:10:10;276] GOING TO LOOK LIKE TONIGHT.
[000:10:12;311] SO THIS IS THE FUTURE RADAR.
[000:10:13;846] AND AS WE GO THROUGH TIME HERE
[000:10:15;881] DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS,
[000:10:16;749] YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THINGS
[000:10:18;050] REALLY CLEAR OUT.
[000:10:18;784] WE'RE GOING TO WATCH THESE
[000:10:19;752] STORMS MOVE OUT BY TONIGHT, AND
[000:10:22;221] THEN TOMORROW MUCH MORE ON THE
[000:10:23;689] WAY OF IMPROVEMENT.
[000:10:24;890] THE NORTHEAST A FEW SHOWERS
[000:10:25;891] EXPECTED.
[000:10:26;659] AND LESTER, IN COLORADO, AFTER A
[000:10:28;394] WEEK OF RECORD TEMPERATURES WITH
[000:10:29;762] HIGHS IN THE 90s, STILL NO
[000:10:32;098] SIGNIFICANT RELIEF FOR
[000:10:32;698] FIREFIGHTERS IN SIGHT.
[000:10:33;833] >> CHRIS WARREN, THANK YOU.
[000:10:35;401] >>> AN IMPORTANT DECISION FROM
[000:10:38;838] THE SUPREME COURT TODAY THAT IS
[000:10:40;106] LOOK LIKELY TO INFLUENCE THE
[000:10:41;407] EMERGING FIELD OF GENETIC
[000:10:45;378] MEDICINE AND MAKE SOME MEDICAL
[000:10:46;112] TESTS CHEAPER.
[000:10:49;515] THE ISSUE IS WHETHER PARTS OF
[000:10:50;216] THE HUMAN BODY, INDIVIDUAL GENES
[000:10:53;352] COULD BE OWNED BY A PATENTED
[000:10:56;222] COMPANY.
[000:10:57;590] PETE WILLIAMS HAS MORE ON THIS
[000:10:58;324] TONIGHT.
[000:10:58;791] >> Reporter: THE COURT'S
[000:10:59;625] DECISION INVOLVES THE MEDICAL
[000:11:00;326] TESTS THAT ACTRESS ANGELINA
[000:11:01;093] JOLIE TOOK BEFORE DECIDING
[000:11:01;761] UNDERGO A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY LAST
[000:11:02;495] MONTH.
[000:11:05;631] >> I FEEL GREAT.
[000:11:06;832] I FEEL WONDERFUL, AND I'M VERY,
[000:11:08;501] VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE
[000:11:09;235] SUPPORT.
[000:11:09;568] IT'S BEEN AWESOME.
[000:11:10;369] >> Reporter: THE TEST DETECTS
[000:11:11;470] MUTATIONS IN TWO GENES THAT CAN
[000:11:12;204] PREDICT HIGHER RATES OF BREAST
[000:11:12;938] AND OVARIAN CANCERS.
[000:11:13;472] ONLY ONE COMPANY PERFORMS IT,
[000:11:18;210] MYRIAD GENETICS OF UTAH.
[000:11:21;614] AFTER DISCOVERING WHICH OF THE
[000:11:22;682] BODY'S TWO GENES CAN SIGNAL A
[000:11:24;650] CANCER RISK, IT WAS GIVEN A
[000:11:25;651] PATENT ON THE ACTUAL GENES.
[000:11:28;387] ELIZABETH OF MASSACHUSETTS WAS
[000:11:29;121] AMONG THOSE SUING, CLAIMING
[000:11:29;789] MYRIAD'S MONOPOLY MADE THE TEST
[000:11:30;523] TOO EXPENSIVE.
[000:11:34;460] >> MY GENETIC COUNSELOR AT THE
[000:11:35;861] TIME TOLD ME THAT MY HEALTH
[000:11:37;263] INSURANCE WOULD NOT COVER THE
[000:11:37;963] GENETIC TESTING.
[000:11:41;500] >> Reporter: TODAY A UNANIMOUS
[000:11:42;401] SUPREME COURT SAID MYRIAD WAS
[000:11:43;436] NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A PATENT
[000:11:45;504] BECAUSE IT DID NOT CREATE
[000:11:46;739] ANYTHING.
[000:11:47;106] A HUMAN GENE, THE COURT SAID, IS
[000:11:48;674] A PRODUCT OF NATURE AND CANNOT
[000:11:49;542] BE PATENTED.
[000:11:51;644] IN RESPONSE, MYRIAD SAYS ENOUGH
[000:11:53;979] OF ITS OTHER PATENTS SURVIVED TO
[000:11:56;649] PROTECT ITS TESTS FROM
[000:11:58;617] COMPETITION, BUT THE DECISION
[000:11:59;752] FREES UP GENES FOR MORE RESEARCH
[000:12:02;021] AND FOR OTHER COMPANIES TO TRY
[000:12:04;190] OFFERING A CANCER SCREENING TEST
[000:12:04;924] OF ITS OWN.
[000:12:06;325] >> A GOOD DAY FOR PATIENT
[000:12:06;959] ADVOCATES AND INDIVIDUAL
[000:12:07;593] PATIENTS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR
[000:12:08;294] ACCESS TO CHEAPER AND
[000:12:08;861] ALTERNATIVE TESTS.
[000:12:09;361] WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A MONOPOLY
[000:12:10;563] ON THE GENE, YOU CAN'T STOP
[000:12:11;397] COMPETITORS FROM COMING IN.
[000:12:15;334] >> Reporter: MYRIAD'S
[000:12:16;235] CHALLENGERS SAY THE RULE COG
[000:12:17;536] ALSO CREATE MORE COMPETITION IN
[000:12:19;939] TESTS FOR NEUROMUSCULAR AND
[000:12:21;507] HEART DISEASES, AND COULD
[000:12:22;875] STIMULATE MORE RESEARCH TO FIND
[000:12:24;176] OTHER HUMAN GENES LINKED TO
[000:12:25;778] SPECIFIC DISEASES.
[000:12:26;579] STILL TO COME RULING ABOUTS ON
[000:12:28;647] SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, THE FUTURE OF
[000:12:29;949] AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, AND THE
[000:12:30;616] VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
[000:12:34;086] THE NEXT DAY FOR DECISIONS IS
[000:12:34;820] THIS COMING MONDAY.
[000:12:36;622] PETE WILLIAMS AT THE SUPREME
[000:12:37;323] COURT.
[000:12:37;990] >>> NEW DEMANDS FROM CONGRESS
[000:12:38;691] TODAY FOR AN EXPLANATION OF
[000:12:39;358] BROAD GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE
[000:12:40;059] PROGRAMS ARE NECESSARY.
[000:12:41;527] A WEEK AFTER THE EXISTENCE OF
[000:12:46;198] THE PROGRAMS WAS LEAKED, GENERAL
[000:12:48;300] KEITH ALEXANDER, THE HEAD OF THE
[000:12:51;137] NSA SAID THE GOVERNMENT WOULD
[000:12:52;538] RELEASE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT
[000:12:53;606] THEM, AND ALSO NEW DETAILS ABOUT
[000:12:55;608] SPECIFIC TERRORIST PLOTS.
[000:12:56;342] FOR HIS PART, FBI DIRECTOR
[000:12:58;244] ROBERT MUELLER SAYS THE LEAKS BY
[000:12:58;978] A FORMER GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR
[000:12:59;712] HAVE CAUSED SIGNIFICANT HARM TO
[000:13:05;017] THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS, AND HE
[000:13:05;985] SAID TERRORISTS WILL ADJUST
[000:13:06;652] THEIR TACTICS.
[000:13:10;322] >>> AT LEAST ONE PERSON HAS BEEN
[000:13:11;557] KILLED AND DOZENS MORE HURT,
[000:13:13;459] SOME OF THEM CRITICALLY, AFTER A
[000:13:15;427] MASSIVE EXPLOSION AT A CHEMICAL
[000:13:16;162] PLANT IN LOUISIANA.
[000:13:16;929] AN EMPLOYEE CAUGHT THE MOMENT OF
[000:13:17;663] IMPACT ON CAMERA AS WORKERS RAN
[000:13:18;397] FOR THEIR LIVES.
[000:13:19;198] THE FIRE BURNED FOR HOURS.
[000:13:20;166] IT'S NOW OUT, AND OFFICIALS SAY
[000:13:21;634] EVERYONE HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR.
[000:13:23;335] EARLY TESTS DID NOT INDICATE
[000:13:25;638] DANGEROUS LEVELS OF CHEMICALS IN
[000:13:26;372] THE AIR.
[000:13:30;843] >>> STILL AHEAD TONIGHT, A BIG
[000:13:33;312] SPIKE IN A DIFFERENT FORM OF
[000:13:35;014] DEMENTIA THAN WE'RE USED TO
[000:13:35;681] SEEING.
[000:13:36;348] MEMORY LOSS ISN'T THE FIRST RED
[000:13:37;082] FLAG.
[000:13:37;650] UNUSUAL WARNING SIGNS DOCTORS
[000:13:42;354] ARE SEEING NOW IN YOUNGER
[000:13:42;988] PATIENTS.
[000:13:43;355] >>> AND, LATER, WHICH AIRLINES
[000:13:44;089] ARE BEST AT GETTING YOU THERE ON
[000:13:44;824] TIME AND WHICH ARE STRUGGLING TO
[000:13:45;558] KEEP UP.
[000:13:48;611] THE NEW NUMBERS ARE OUT.
[000:13:49;278] WE'LL TELL THEM TO YOU.
[000:15:54;053] >>> WE'RE BACK WITH HEALTH NEWS
[000:15:55;287] AND A DISEASE THAT IS
[000:15:56;922] INCREASINGLY BEING RECOGNIZED.
[000:15:58;390] IT'S A DETERIORATION OF THE
[000:15:59;825] BRAIN THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM
[000:16:00;659] ALZHEIMER'S AND CAUSES DIFFERENT
[000:16:01;393] PROBLEMS.
[000:16:03;762] BUT AS NBC'S CHIEF SCIENCE
[000:16:05;531] CORRESPONDENT ROBERT BAZELL
[000:16:06;865] REPORTS, IT STILL CAUSES
[000:16:07;666] PEOPLE'S LIVES TO SLIP AWAY.
[000:16:10;002] >> Reporter: TWO YEARS AGO,
[000:16:12;905] 62-YEAR-OLD BARBARA WHITMARCH
[000:16:16;475] WAS A HIGHLY REGARDED SCIENTIST
[000:16:18;444] AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF
[000:16:21;313] HEALTH.
[000:16:21;647] SHE AND HUSBAND JOHN MARRIED 30
[000:16:23;415] YEARS, HAD RAISED SIX CHILDREN.
[000:16:24;750] >> WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR
[000:16:26;618] BREAKFAST?
[000:16:26;986] >> Reporter: THEN JOHN BEGAN TO
[000:16:27;953] NOTICE CHANGES.
[000:16:28;887] >> HER ABILITY TO FEEL EMPATHY,
[000:16:30;589] HER PERSONALITY JUST DISAPPEARED
[000:16:31;423] OVER A PERIOD OF TIME.
[000:16:33;559] THAT'S THE HARDEST PART OF THIS
[000:16:34;293] DISEASE.
[000:16:34;660] I WOULD ASK HER, IS ANYTHING
[000:16:35;361] WRONG?
[000:16:35;661] SHE WOULD SAY NO, I LOVE YOU,
[000:16:36;362] EVERYTHING IS FINE.
[000:16:39;865] BUT SHE WASN'T THERE.
[000:16:40;632] AND SHE SAID IT IN THAT FLAT
[000:16:41;333] WAY.
[000:16:42;601] >> Reporter: JOHN, ALSO A
[000:16:43;435] SCIENTIST, WAS WORRIED AND ASKED
[000:16:44;169] HER TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST.
[000:16:48;574] ULTIMATELY, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED
[000:16:52;745] WITH FRONT TEMP ROLL DEMENTIA,
[000:16:55;280] OR FTD, A DISEASE THAT STRIKES A
[000:16:57;082] DIFFERENT PART OF THE BRAIN THAN
[000:16:57;816] ALZHEIMER'S.
[000:16:58;484] >> THERE'S A HUGE LOSS OF
[000:16:59;118] TISSUE.
[000:16:59;551] >> Reporter: IT DOESN'T START
[000:17:00;252] WITH MEMORY PROBLEMS, BUT WITH
[000:17:00;986] PERSONALITY CHANGES.
[000:17:01;520] >> IT'S A TRAGIC PROBLEM,
[000:17:02;221] BECAUSE OFTEN THE FIRST
[000:17:07;693] MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DISEASE
[000:17:08;794] ARE BAD JUDGMENTS, A DISRUPTION
[000:17:10;462] OF FAMILY INFRASTRUCTURE
[000:17:11;096] HAPPENS.
[000:17:11;964] >> Reporter: NOW BARBARA LIVES
[000:17:13;399] IN A LOCKED NURSING HOME.
[000:17:18;170] SHE MOVES COMPULSIVELY AND
[000:17:20;506] CONSTANTLY.
[000:17:20;906] >> DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD I'LL BE?
[000:17:25;444] ROAR SHE SELDOM RECOGNIZES JOHN
[000:17:27;579] OR THEIR CHILDREN AND RARELY
[000:17:28;280] SPEAKS.
[000:17:29;615] UNTIL RECENTLY DOCTORS THOUGHT
[000:17:31;216] FTD WAS RARE, BUT THAT VIEW IS
[000:17:32;117] CHANGING.
[000:17:34;319] >> WE'RE STARTING TO REALIZE
[000:17:36;855] THAT FRONTAL DEMENTIA IS MORE
[000:17:40;259] COMMON IN PEOPLE THAN PEOPLE
[000:17:42;261] WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE UNDER
[000:17:42;995] THE AGE OF 60.
[000:17:44;596] >> Reporter: BEFORE HER ILLNESS,
[000:17:45;330] BARBARA WATCHED HER WEIGHT
[000:17:45;998] CLOSELY.
[000:17:46;331] SHE HAS GAINED 30 POUNDS IN A
[000:17:47;032] YEAR.
[000:17:47;633] >> FOOD IS PROBABLY CENTRAL TO
[000:17:52;504] HER THINKING, HER BEHAVIOR, HER
[000:17:53;238] WALKING.
[000:17:53;906] SHE FORAGES, IF YOU WILL.
[000:17:57;142] >> Reporter: THERE IS NO
[000:17:57;776] TREATMENT FOR FTD.
[000:17:58;477] VICTIMS' BRAINS CONTINUE
[000:17:59;411] DETERIORATING AND THEY DIE
[000:18:00;079] WITHIN YEARS.
[000:18:02;214] NOT ONLY IS FTD FAR MORE COMMON
[000:18:03;682] THAN MOST PEOPLE REALIZE,
[000:18:04;883] STUDYING IT COULD PROVIDE CLUES
[000:18:09;321] TO OTHER IMPORTANT CONDITIONS,
[000:18:11;824] INCLUDING LOU GEHRIG'S DISEASE
[000:18:12;758] AND HUNTINGDON'S DISEASE.
[000:18:14;159] >> GIVE ME A KISS, SOMETHING.
[000:18:15;928] >> Reporter: AND JUST AS
[000:18:16;995] IMPORTANT, THEY SAY, MORE
[000:18:18;831] AWARENESS OF THE DISEASE COULD
[000:18:20;666] SPARE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS THE
[000:18:22;034] PAIN OF BELIEVING THEIR LOVED
[000:18:22;835] ONES NO LONGER CARE.
[000:18:24;670] ROBERT BAZELL, NBC NEWS,
[000:18:25;304] SACRAMENTO.
[000:18:28;974] >>> WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH
[000:18:30;509] A BIG CHANGE TO SOMETHING THAT
[000:18:31;710] HAS BEEN AN AMERICAN TRADITION
[000:18:32;444] FOR CENTURIES.
[000:18:32;844] For our families...
[000:21:05;697] our neighbors...
[000:21:07;132] and our communities...
[000:21:08;767] America's beverage companies
[000:21:08;767] have created...
[000:21:11;003] a wide range of new choices.
[000:21:12;971] Developing smaller portion sizes
[000:21:12;971] and more..
[000:21:15;941] low and no-calorie
[000:21:15;941] beverages...
[000:21:17;809] adding clear calorie labels so
[000:21:17;809] you know...
[000:21:19;778] exactly what you're choosing...
[000:21:21;380] and in schools, replacing
[000:21:21;380] full-calorie soft drinks...
[000:21:24;116] with lower-calorie options.
[000:21:26;051] With more choices and fewer
[000:21:26;051] calories...
[000:21:28;553] America's Beverage Companies are
[000:21:28;553] delivering.
[000:21:35;927] >>> THE CENSUS IS TELLING US A
[000:21:38;597] LOT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE
[000:21:40;299] AND THE RAPIDLY CHANGING MAKEUP
[000:21:41;500] OF OUR POPULATION.
[000:21:44;403] WE LEARNED TODAY THAT LAST YEAR,
[000:21:45;504] MORE NON-HISPANIC WHITE
[000:21:47;072] AMERICANS DIED THAN WERE BORN.
[000:21:48;774] THAT GROUP IS STILL THE NATION'S
[000:21:50;208] LARGEST, BUT IT HAS BEEN
[000:21:51;677] SHRINKING FOR YEARS.
[000:21:55;514] AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, MINORITY
[000:21:57;316] GROUPS NOW ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT
[000:21:58;550] HALF OF AMERICAN CHILDREN UNDER
[000:21:59;451] THE AGE OF 5.
[000:22:00;385] IN 2012, THE HISPANIC POPULATION
[000:22:04;189] GREW THE MOST IN SHEER NUMBERS.
[000:22:05;090] BUT THE ASIAN POPULATION FOR THE
[000:22:08;727] FIRST TIME IS NOW THE FASTEST
[000:22:09;728] GROWING POPULATION IN THE
[000:22:10;362] COUNTRY.
[000:22:10;696] >>> THE LATEST REPORT CARD ON
[000:22:12;197] HOW AIRLINES ARE DOING IS OUT.
[000:22:13;665] IT'S FOR APRIL AND OVERALL, IT
[000:22:14;866] SHOWS BELOW-AVERAGE PERFORMANCE.
[000:22:16;101] FIRST, THE GOOD NEWS.
[000:22:19;738] THE BEST PERFORMERS WERE
[000:22:21;373] HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, ALASKA
[000:22:22;541] AIRLINES, AND DELTA, WITH
[000:22:24;876] ON-TIME ARRIVALS ABOVE 85%.
[000:22:27;012] THE WORST PERFORMERS WERE
[000:22:28;213] AMERICAN EAGLE, WHICH WAS ON
[000:22:30;482] TIME JUST UNDER 67% OF THE TIME,
[000:22:33;151] FOLLOWED BY FRONTIER AND
[000:22:36;121] EXPRESSJET.
[000:22:36;521] AND AMONG AIRPORTS, PASSENGERS
[000:22:38;357] WERE MOST LIKELY TO BE DELAYED
[000:22:39;458] FLYING INTO NEWARK.
[000:22:40;859] >>> NOW HEAR THIS.
[000:22:41;827] THE U.S. NAVY RETROFITTING THE
[000:22:45;397] WAY IT COMMUNICATES FROM A
[000:22:46;631] SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FROM
[000:22:48;400] THE OLD TELETYPE DAYS TO E-MAIL.
[000:22:50;068] AS PART OF THE CHANGE, THE
[000:22:51;536] SERVICE SAID IN A MEMO THAT IT'S
[000:22:53;505] NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE TO LIMIT
[000:22:54;806] NAVY MESSAGES ENTIRELY TO UPPER
[000:22:58;243] CASE, AND THAT ALL NAVY COMMANDS
[000:23:00;045] ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE STANDARD
[000:23:02;447] MIXED-CASE CHARACTERS.
[000:23:03;014] THAT'S UPPER AND LOWER CASE.
[000:23:06;785] BUT TRADITION IS HARD TO CHANGE,
[000:23:07;919] AND AS YOU CAN SEE, THE
[000:23:09;755] ANNOUNCEMENT ITSELF WAS IN ALL
[000:23:11;723] CAPS.
