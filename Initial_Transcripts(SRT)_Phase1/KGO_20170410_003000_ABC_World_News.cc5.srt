00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So I talked to my doctor

661
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and he prescribed LYRICA.

662
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Nerve damage from diabetes

663
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
causes diabetic nerve pain.

664
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
LYRICA is FDA approved

665
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
to treat this pain.

666
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
LYRICA may cause serious
allergic reactions

667
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
or suicidal thoughts
or actions.

668
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Tell your doctor right away

669
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
if you have these,

670
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
new or worsening depression,

671
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
or unusual changes in mood
or behavior.

672
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Or swelling, trouble breathing,

673
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
rash, hives, blisters, muscle
pain with fever,

674
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
tired feeling or blurry vision.

675
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Common side effects are
dizziness, sleepiness,

676
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
weight gain and swelling
of hands, legs, and feet.

677
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Don't drink alcohol while
taking LYRICA.

678
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Don't drive or use machinery

679
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
until you know how LYRICA
affects you.

680
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Those who have had a drug or
alcohol problem

681
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
may be more likely
to misuse LYRICA.

682
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Now I have less diabetic
nerve pain.

683
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And I love keeping their little
feet safe and sound.

684
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Ask your doctor about
LYRICA.

685
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If you are eligible,

686
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000

742
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
UP AND THAT SHE FOUND A DOCTOR

743
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
