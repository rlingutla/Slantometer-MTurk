00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
THEY RANGE, WE HAVE TEN IN

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
CRITICAL CONDITION RIGHT NOW.

207
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
12 IN SERIOUS.

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
AND 15 ARE LISTED IN FAIR OR

209
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
GOOD CONDITION AT THE MOMENT.

210
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
>> WHAT KIND OF INJURIES ARE YOU

211
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
SEEING?
>> WE'RE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM

212
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
JUST MINOR LACERATIONS TO SEVERE

213
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
HEAD INJURIES AND ABDOMINAL

214
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MOST LIKELY FROM PUNCTURES FROM

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
FLYING DEBRIS.

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
>> WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT

218
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
THOSE CHILDREN IN THE TWO

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SCHOOLS, WHO WERE INSIDE.

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
ANY OF YOUR CHILDREN FROM THOSE

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
SCHOOLS, AND WHAT ABOUT THEIR

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000

CHILDREN OF THOSE 37.

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I KNOW THAT TWO OF THE 37 WERE

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
FROM THAT SCHOOL.

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
>> AND IS IT POSSIBLE, WITH

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
PRIVACY, TO GIVE US ANY SENSE OF

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
THEIR CONDITION?

230
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
>> WELL, THANKFULLY NONE OF THE

231
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
FIVE CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

232
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
NOW ARE LISTED IN CRITICAL.

233
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
ONE IN SERIOUS AND THE OTHERS

234
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
ARE FAIR OR GOOD.

235
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

236
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
>> THAT'S REALLY GREAT NEWS.

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
HOW MANY MORE PATIENTS CAN YOU

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
RECEIVE?
HOW MUCH ARE YOU EQUIPPED TO

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
RECEIVE?

240
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
>> WELL, WE DO RUN THE BUSIEST

241
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
ER IN THE STATE, SO WE ARE

242
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH VOLUME.

243
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
MAYBE NOT TO THE EMOTIONAL

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
EXTENT OF THIS TRAGEDY, BUT WITH

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ONLY TEN CRITICAL AT THE MOMENT,

246
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
WE'RE CAPABLE OF HANDLING

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
ANYMORE.
>> GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
YOU'RE HEARING AROUND TOWN.

249
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
ARE THERE AMBULANCES GOING OUT

250
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
ALL OVER TOWN, OR ARE YOU STILL

251
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
LOOKING FOR REINFORCEMENTS?

252
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
>> WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THE

253
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ROADS ARE STILL IMPASSABLE IN

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
THAT AREA, SO IT'S TAKING A

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO

256
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
GET OUT OF THE AREA AND TO OUR

257
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
HOSPITAL.

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THE AMBULANCES ARE SHOWING UP,

259
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PATIENT AT A

260
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
TIME, THEY'RE BRINGING THREE AND

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
FOUR PATIENTS AT A TIME.

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST ARRIVING BY

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
PRIVATE VEHICLE AS WELL.

264
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
>> AGAIN, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH

265
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
FOR PHONING INTO US.

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
NIGHT.
>> CERTAINLY DIANE.

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
>> WE WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST

269
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
AS YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR

270
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
EVERYBODY ELSE.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

271
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
>> THANK YOU.

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
>> AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO BEEN

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
HEARING EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTIONS,

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
VIVID ONES, OF THE UTTER

275
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
DESTRUCTION ON THE GROUND.

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
EARLIER, MELISSA NEWTON SPOKE

277
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
ABOUT THE DEVASTATION SHE SAW

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
WHEN SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE HER

279
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
DOOR.

280
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
>> I LOOKED TO THE WEST AND I

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
SEE IT.
HAIL THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS

282
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
POUNDING MY CAR AT THE TIME.

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
GOT HOME FAST AS POSSIBLE, GOT

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
OUR DOGS, AND GOT INTO THE

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
SHELTER, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
LATER, WE WERE HIT.

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS COVERED IN

288
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
DEBRIS.
SHINGLES AND PIECES OF SHEET

289
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
ROOT AND WOOD IN OUR YARD AND

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
ALL ACROSS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

291
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
SOME HOMES COMPLETELY GONE.

292
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
IT'S DEVASTATING.

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
THERE ARE TWO BY FOURS GOING

294
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
THROUGH PEOPLE'S ROOFS LIKE

295
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
PROJECTILE OBJECTS.

296
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
HEARING THE STORM GOING OVER MY

297
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
HOUSE, WHICH ROARING, WHIRLING

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
SOUND, IT WAS SO LOUD.

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
OUR DOGS WERE DOWN ON THE GROUND

300
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
JUST SHAKING, BLESS THEIR

301
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
HEARTS.

302
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
IT WAS A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
THANK GOD WE HAD A SHELTER.

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
>> AND SO MANY HAD SHELTERS.

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
NOW, I WANT TO CHECK BACK IN

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
WITH ABC'S METEOROLOGIST JINKER

307
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
ZEE FOR A MOMENT.

308
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
SHE'S ON THE GROUND IN MOORE,

309
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OKLAHOMA.

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
GINGER, IN THESE MOMENTS, WHAT

311
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW?

312
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
>> Reporter: WELL, WE SET UP

313
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
RIGHT AWAY, AT BRIARWOOD

314
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ELEMENTARY, ONE OF THE SCHOOLS

315
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
HARDEST HIT.

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
WE MET ONE WOMAN LOOKING FOR HER

317
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
NIECE.

318
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
SHE STILL HADN'T FOUND HER.

319
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
SHE KNEW SHE WAS OKAY, BUT STILL

320
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
HADN'T BEEN RE-UNITED.
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THOSE

321
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
TYPES OF STORIES.

322
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
ALSO AT THIS POINT I'M SEEING

323
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
THE WARREN THEATER, NOW WE'RE

324
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
SEEING SOME OF THE WALLS UP, BUT

325
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
JUST PEOPLE WALKING THE STREETS.

326
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
REFUGEES WITH SUITCASES OF ALL

327
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
TWHA HAVE LEFT, WHAT THEY'VE

328
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
BEEN ABLE TO GET BEFORE THE SUN

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
SETS HERE IN MOORE.

330
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
>> ARE YOU STILL SEEING PEOPLE

331
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
DIGGING THROUGH THEIR HOMES?

332
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
>> ABSOLUTELY.

333
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
THE WATER IS SPOUTING OUT OF THE

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
PLUMING AND THEY'RE STILL
DIGGING THROUGH TRYING TO FIND

335
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
THINGS BEFORE THE SUN SETS.

336
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
ONE WOMAN TOLD US, WE JUST WANT

337
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
TO FIND OUR OWN THINGS BEFORE

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

339
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
>> AND INITIALLY, WE SAW ALL

340
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
THOSE FIRES BURNING, HAVE THEY

341
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
GONE OUT?
>> WE STILL SEE SOME PLUMES OF

342
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
SMOKE.
I SAW A COUPLE BEFORE ME MOVED

343
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
TO A DIFFERENT AREA.

344
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S OVER

345
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
WITH YET.

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
THE SMELL OF GAS IS PERMEATING

347
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
STILL.

348
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
IT'S ALMOST SICKENING WHEN

349
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
YOU'RE STANDING THERE.

350
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
>> AND OF COURSE SO DANGEROUS.

351
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
THANK YOU, GINGER AND I KNOW

352
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
YOU'RE STANDING BY FOR THE REST

353
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
OF THE BROADCAST.
I WANT TO TURN TO ABC'S SAM

VIOLENT STORMS HAVE BEEN IN THIS

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
AREA.

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
AND THE THIRD DAY SEEMED TO HAVE

363
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
DROPPED THE WORST TORNADO OF

364
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
THEM ALL.

365
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
WE'LL HAVE PICTURES FROM STORM

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
CHASER VIDEOS.

367

HOW MUCH OUR ADVICE
AND GUIDANCE COSTS.

725
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
SPOILER ALERT: IT'S LOW.

726
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
IT'S GUIDANCE ON YOUR TERMS,
NOT OURS.

727
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
E-TRADE. LESS FOR US.
MORE FOR YOU.

728
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I WORKED A PATROL UNIT FOR 17
YEARS IN THE CITY OF BALTIMORE.

729
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
WHEN I FIRST STARTED
EXPERIENCING THE PAIN,

730
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A NUMBNESS

731
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
BUT YET YOU HAVE THE PAIN

732
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
LIKE THOUSANDS OF NEEDLES
STICKING IN YOUR FOOT.

733
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
IT WAS PROGRESSIVELY
GETTING WORSE,

734
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
AND AT THAT POINT,
I KNEW I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

735
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
WHEN I WENT BACK
TO MY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL,

736
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
THAT'S WHEN SHE SUGGESTED
THE LYRICA.

737
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
ONCE I STARTED
TAKING THE LYRICA,

738
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
THE PAIN STARTED SUBSIDING.

739
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000

THAT DIABETES DAMAGES NERVES.

741
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
