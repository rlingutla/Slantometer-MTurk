         have happened.         

238
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,932
Your doctor should perform blood
     tests before you start     

239
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,767
  and while taking XELJANZ XR,  

240
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,602
and monitor certain liver tests.

241
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,137
    Tell your doctor if you     
        were in a region        

242
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,706

243
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:15,873
    and if you have had TB,

248
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:21,679
          But for you,          

249
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,513
         one pill a day         

250
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,182
  may provide symptom relief.   

251
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,551
        Ask your doctor         
       about XELJANZ XR.        

252
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,452

256

          Conditioner.          

260
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,984
 Remember that accident I got in

261
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,319
            with the pole, and I
            had to make a claim 
            and all that?       

262
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,320
Is that whole thing             
still dragging on?              

263
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:03,321
            No, I took some pics
