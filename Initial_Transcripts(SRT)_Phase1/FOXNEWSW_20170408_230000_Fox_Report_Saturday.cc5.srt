TO REFURBISH THE TOWER.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
IT WILL COST ABOUT $42 MILLION

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
WILL TAKE HALF A YEAR JUST TO

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
PUT UP THE SCAFFOLDING.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000

AMERICAN TOMAHAWK MISSILES

NEARLY LEVELING A SYRIAN AIRBASE

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
HANGER.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
>> DEMOLISHED AND RUNWAYS DAMAGE

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
THE SYRIAN FORCES ARE LASHING

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
OUT AT REBEL TARGETS.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THE

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
GLOBAL REACTION POURS IN?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
THE MAN WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
LADEN SAYS DIPLOMACY MUST BE A

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
FACTOR.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
>> THEIR PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
PLANNING THIS SINCE 2003.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
THE PLAN WILL BE THERE BUT AGAIN

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAR COME IS
GOING TO BE DIPLOMACY.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
JULIE: WE HAVE TO "FOX NEWS"

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
TEAM COVERAGE.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
WE BEGIN WITH KRISTIN FISHER WHO

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
THIS WEEKEND AT MAR-A-LAGO IN

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
FLORIDA AND KRISTIN IT'S BEEN

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
OVER 48 HOURS SINCE HE TOOK HIS

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
VERY FIRST BIG MILITARY ACTION

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
AS PRESIDENT.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
ANY INDICATION OF HOW HE'S DOING

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
TONIGHT?

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
>> BY ALL ACCOUNTS PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S VERY PLEASED THAT HIS

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
DECISION TO STRIKE AND WITH HOW

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
IT'S PLAYING OUT.
HIS DECISION TO STRIKE HAS

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PRAISE FROM

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
THE SAUDI TEAM CALLED A

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
COURAGEOUS ACT AND SPRAYS BY

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
CAPITOL HILL.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
THE ONE AREA WHERE PRESIDENT

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
TRUMP HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
THAT WAS HIS DECISION TO ACT

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BUT EVEN

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
ON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
THAT DECISION TODAY IN A LETTER
TO CONGRESS.

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
HE WROTE THAT I ACTED IN THE

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
FOREIGN-POLICY INTERESTS OF THE
UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO MY

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
CONDUCT FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AS

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE.

68
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
THE U.S. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
ACTION AS NECESSARY AND

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
APPROPRIATE TO FURTHER ITS

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
IMPORTANT NATIONAL INTERESTS.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
THE TWO BIG TAKEAWAYS THERE ARE

73
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATING

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
WHAT THE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
NIKKI HALEY SAID YESTERDAY, THAT
THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO TAKE

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
FURTHER ACTION IF NECESSARY IF

77
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
ASSAD DOES NOT STOP THE CHEMICAL

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
WEAPONS ATTACKS AGAINST HIS OWN

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
PEOPLE AND THEN IT ALSO, THEY

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES HE

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WITHOUT

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
RECEIVING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
TO DO SO.

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I AM SURE A LOT OF FOLKS ON

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
CAPITOL HILL WOULD DISAGREE WITH

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
THAT.
JULIE: WHAT ARE YOU HEARING

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
KRISTIN ABOUT ALL THESE REPORTS

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OF A SHAKEUP WITH SENIOR WHITE

89
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
HOUSE STAFF?

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
ANY TRUTH TO THEM?

91
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
>> THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO TRUTH

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
THAT THIS HAS KIND HAVE BEEN

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
BREWING FOR SOME TIME.
THE MAIN SOURCE OF CONFLICT IS

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
BETWEEN SENIOR ADVISER JARED

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
KUSHNER AND STEVE BANNON.

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
AND THEN OF COURSE IS A
NONINTERVENTIONIST.

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
HE BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD NOT

98
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
INTERVENE IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA

99
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE
ARGUED AGAINST THE STRIKE.

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
LAST NIGHT AT THE PRESIDENTS

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
REQUEST THE TWO SAT DOWN AT

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
MAR-A-LAGO BUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL

103
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
DIVISIONS REMAIN.

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

105
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER COREY

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
LEWANDOWSKI PUTS IT IN
PERSPECTIVE.

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
>> ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PRETEND

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
PRESIDENT MAY FIND THEMSELVES

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
BACKTRACKING VERY QUICKLY WHAT

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
WE KNOW IS THE PRESIDENT IS THE

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
ONE WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS IN

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHO IS

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
GOING TO LEAD.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
>> THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING
ANY REPORTS OF A STAFF SHAKEUP

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
IS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
THE GOOD WEEK THE PRESIDENT

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
TRUMP'S HAD.

119
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
JULIE: TO SERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE TRUMP

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ADMINISTRATION?

122
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
>> I THINK THIS RIFT BETWEEN

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
BANNON AND KUSHNER IS INDICATIVE

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
OF THE CROSSROADS THAT PRESIDENT

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
TRUMP IS AT.

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING TO

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
CONTINUE ON WITH HIS AMERICA

128
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
FIRST THEME INSTEAD OF COUNTRIES

129
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
LIKE SYRIA OR IS HE BECOMING A
BIT MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
INTERVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT

131
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
HE WARNED AGAINST ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS HE NOW

133
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
TURNING ON RUSSIA A COUNTRY THAT

134
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
STRONGLY SUPPORTED BASHAR

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
AL-ASSAD ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
HAVE BEEN ALL THESE REPORTS BY

137
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS HIS

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
ASSOCIATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOO

139
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
COZY WITH RUSSIA AND THERE ARE

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO
WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF HIS

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ASSOCIATES BROKE THE LAW.

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH AND

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
THAT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

144
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
WILLING TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE.

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE HIS MIND

146
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
TO DEFAULT.

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS

148
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
EVOLVE INTO WHAT?

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF POLICIES HE
GOING TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AND

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
WILL IT ALIGN WITH THE JARED

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
KUSHNER BRANCH OF THE WEST WING

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
OR WHAT SIDE MORE WITH STEVE
BANNON?

153
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
JULIE: KRISTIN FISHER FOR

154
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
TONIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

155
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
THE U.S. ATTACK APPARENTLY HAS

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
NOT SLOWED SYRIA DOWN MUCH.

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
THAT IS THE WORD.

158
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
JUST HOURS LATER SYRIAN

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
WARPLANES FROM OTHER BASES

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
APPARENTLY STRUCK OPPOSITION

161
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
TARGETS INCLUDING ONE NEAR THE

162
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
SITE OF A DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
WHICH PROVOKED THE U.S. RESPONSE

164
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OF THE VERY FIRST PLACE.

165
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE JOHN

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
McCAIN SEEN THE AMERICAN

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
STRIKE WAS A GOOD START BUT MORE

169
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
LISTEN.

171
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
>> I WOULD ARGUE FOR A NO-FLY

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
ZONE AND ARMING AND TRAINING THE

173
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
FREE SYRIAN ARMY.

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST

175
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
CONTINUE TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQA

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
AND STOP THIS FLOW THAT IS

177
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
COMING OUT OF RAQQA AND BEING

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
SENT TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
STATES TO PREVENT TERROR.

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
THE RIGHT FIRST STEP AND I THINK

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE

183
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

184
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
JULIE: PENTAGON PRODUCER LUKE IS

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
THOMAS AND IS LIVE WITH THE VERY

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000

JULIE: AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

248
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
EXPECT MORE AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
AGAINST ASSAD REGIME BECAUSE IT

250
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE

251
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
HAS HINTED THAT THERE ARE MORE

252
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
TO COME AND OF COURSE THEIR

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
POLICY AT THIS POINT AT LEAST

254
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE

255
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
CLEAR IS THAT HE DOESN'T PLAN ON

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
HEAR WHAT THEIR PLAN IS UNTIL IT

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
HAPPENS.

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
AS WAS ALLUDED TO THIS WEEK

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED MORE

266
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
REGIME.
MADE THE DECISION IN FOUR HOURS

LATER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE

268
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000

MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE BUT

276
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE

277
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
NECESSARY.

278
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK.

NATION BUT RUSSIA REMAINS THE

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
MOST CRITICAL.
KATIE LOGAN HAS MORE FROM OUR

OF U.S. DECISION.
IT WAS THESE IMAGES OF THE

315
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
HORRIFIC CHEMICAL STRIKE IN

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
NORTHERN SYRIA WHICH SPARKED

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
GLOBAL OUTRAGE THAT LED TO THE

318
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE.

319
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
WHETHER RUSSIA MAY HAVE

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
SUPPORTED US.
GOVERNMENT IN CARRYING OUT THE

322
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000

323
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
THE RUSSIAN REACTION TO THE KEY

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
ROLE IN SYRIA WHILE STANDING BY
ASSAD AGGRESSION.

325
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
RUSSIA HAS BEEN THE MOST

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
CRITICAL OF THE U.S. MISSILE

327
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
STRIKE SAYING THEY WERE IN

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.

329
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
IT ALSO SAYS IT'S A SETBACK FOR

330
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. AND MAY

331
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR
THE REGION.

332
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
RUSSIA KEEPS UP A STRONG

THE COMPANY.

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
YESTERDAY THIS RUSSIAN WARSHIP

CRITIC OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
EXPRESSING DOUBT OF U.S. STRIKE

347
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
ON SYRIA SAYING THE PRESIDENT

348
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
SHOULD OBEY THE CONSTITUTION AND

349
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
ASK OR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL

350
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
BEFORE USING MILITARY ACTION.

351
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
>> WAR HAS CAUSED THESE REFUGEES

352
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
TO FLEE SO WILL MORE WAR

353
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
ACCELERATE OR ACCENTUATE THE

354
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
CURRENT INVOLVEMENT?

355
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
WILL THERE BE LESS REFUGEES
UNLESS DEATH?

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I WOULD SAY THERE WOULD BE MORE

357
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
DEATHS AND MORE REFUGEES.
I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR BOMBING

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
WILL LEAD TO PEACE.

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
JULIE: BUT SENATOR IF WE DON'T

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
WOMAN AND CHILD?

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
>> IS DOING IT ON HIS OWN.

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DEPLORABLE.

365
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
ATROCITY IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO

366
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
DISOBEY THE CONSTITUTION.

367
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000

386
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
BY ACTIVATING
WHAT'S WITHIN ME

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
WITH ONCE-WEEKLY TRULICITY.

388
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

389
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
IT HELPS ACTIVATE MY BODY TO
DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
RELEASE ITS OWN INSULIN.

391
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
TRULICITY RESPONDS WHEN
MY BLOOD SUGAR RISES.

392
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I TAKE IT ONCE A WEEK,
AND IT WORKS 24/7.

393
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
IT COMES IN AN EASY-TO-USE PEN

394
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
AND I MAY EVEN LOSE
A LITTLE WEIGHT.

395
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
TRULICITY IS A ONCE-WEEKLY
INJECTABLE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE

396
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUGAR IN
ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES

397
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
WHEN USED WITH
DIET AND EXERCISE.

398
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
TRULICITY IS NOT INSULIN.

399
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
IT SHOULD NOT BE THE FIRST
MEDICINE TO TREAT DIABETES

400
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
OR FOR PEOPLE WITH
TYPE 1 DIABETES

401
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
OR DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS.

402
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
DO NOT TAKE TRULICITY
IF YOU OR A FAMILY MEMBER

403
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
HAS HAD MEDULLARY
THYROID CANCER,

404
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
IF YOU'VE HAD MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE
NEOPLASIA SYNDROME TYPE 2,

405
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
OR IF YOU ARE
ALLERGIC TO TRULICITY.

406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
STOP TRULICITY AND CALL
YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY

407
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS

408
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
SUCH AS ITCHING, RASH,
OR TROUBLE BREATHING;

409
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A LUMP OR SWELLING IN YOUR NECK;

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS
MAY INCLUDE PANCREATITIS,

412
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
WHICH CAN BE FATAL.

413
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
TAKING TRULICITY WITH A
SULFONYLUREA OR INSULIN

414
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
INCREASES YOUR RISK
FOR LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, VOMITING,

416
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
DECREASED APPETITE
AND INDIGESTION.

417
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
SOME SIDE EFFECTS CAN
LEAD TO DEHYDRATION,

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
WHICH MAY MAKE EXISTING
KIDNEY PROBLEMS WORSE.

Bounty is more absorbent,Mom"

than the leading ordinary brand.

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So you get more "Life" per roll.

431
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Bounty, the Quicker Picker Upper

432
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000

433
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000

Delicious.

435
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000

Eggland's Best.

445

Make sure the germs they
bring home don't stick around.

Use Clorox
disinfecting products.

455

better than Clorox.

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
WHY POLICE ARE INTENSIFYING

593

THEIR SEARCH FOR A MAN THEY SAY

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
NATIONAL POLITICS.

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
>> MY DAD ACTUALLY KNOWS HIM SO

597
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
IT'S EVEN MORE AWKWARD THAT

598
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
SOMEONE SO INNOCENT COULD DO

599
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
SOMETHING SO TERRIFYING

600
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Hey, how's it going?

601
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Um... who are you?

602
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm Val. The Orange Money
retirement squirrel from Voya.

603
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I represent the money you save
for the future. See?

604
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
We're putting away acorns to
show the importance of being
organized.

605
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That's smart. Who's he?

606
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He's the green money you can
spend now. What's up?

607
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh you know, gonna pay some
bills, maybe buy a new tennis
racket.

608
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Tennis racket for a squirrel?

609
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He's got a killer backhand.

610
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When it's time to get organized
for retirement, it's time to get
Voya.

611
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Various: (Shouting) Heigh!

Woman:
On the Gulf Coast,

new ExxonMobil projects

617
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
are expected to create
over 45,000 jobs.

618
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And each job created
by the energy industry

619
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
supports two others
in the community.

620
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Altogether,

621
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
the industry supports over
9 million jobs nationwide.

622
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
These are jobs that natural
gas is helping make happen,

623
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
all while reducing
America's emissions.

624
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Energy lives here.

625
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
can make any occasion feel
more special.ie
all while reducing
America's emissions.

626
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So she makes her pie crust
from scratch.

And sprinkles on brown sugar
streusel.

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So that you can spend more time

629
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
making special moments with
your family.

to Esurance could save hundreds.

641
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So if you switch to Esurance,

642
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000

THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT OFFERED

WHICH ON BALANCE WAS GOOD
$15 BILLION OVER EIGHT YEARS FOR

957

INSISTING ON THEIR EXTRANEOUS

UNLESS THE PRESIDENT ASKED FOR

Woman:
On the Gulf Coast,

1379
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
new ExxonMobil projects

1380
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
are expected to create
over 45,000 jobs.

1381
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And each job created
by the energy industry

1382
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
supports two others
in the community.

1383
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Altogether,

1384
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
the industry supports over
9 million jobs nationwide.

1385
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
These are jobs that natural
gas is helping make happen,

1386
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
all while reducing
America's emissions.

1387
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Energy lives here.

1388
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
all while reducing
America's emissions.
WHY PAUSE A
SPONTANEOUS MOMENT?

1389
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
CIALIS FOR DAILY USE TREATS ED
AND THE URINARY SYMPTOMS OF BPH.

1390
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
TELL YOUR DOCTOR
ABOUT YOUR MEDICINES,

1391
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
AND ASK IF YOUR HEART IS
HEALTHY ENOUGH FOR SEX.

1392
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
DO NOT TAKE CIALIS IF YOU
TAKE NITRATES FOR CHEST PAIN,

1393
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
OR ADEMPAS® FOR
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION,

1394
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
AS THIS MAY CAUSE AN UNSAFE
DROP IN BLOOD PRESSURE.

1395
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL IN EXCESS.

1396
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
TO AVOID LONG-TERM INJURY,
GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY

1397
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
FOR AN ERECTION LASTING
MORE THAN FOUR HOURS.

1398
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
IF YOU HAVE A SUDDEN DECREASE
OR LOSS OF HEARING OR VISION,

1399
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
OR AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
STOP TAKING CIALIS

1400
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
AND GET MEDICAL HELP RIGHT AWAY.

1401
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT CIALIS.

1402

More "Doing Chores For Dad"

1404
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
More "Earning Something
You Love" per roll

1405
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Bounty is more absorbent,

1406
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
so the roll can last 50% longer
than the leading ordinary brand.

1407
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So you get more "Life" per roll.

1408
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Bounty, the Quicker Picker Upper

1409
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
gives you a reason to slow down
and pull up a seat to the table.

1410
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
That's why she takes the time to
season her turkey to perfection,

1411
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
and make stuffing from scratch.

1412
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So that you can spend time

1413
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
on what really matters.

1414
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Marie Callender's.

1415
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
It's time to savor.

1416
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Our 18 year old wase Army
in an accident.'98.

1417
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
When I call USAA
it was that voice asking me,

1418
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
"Is your daughter ok?"

1419
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
That's where I felt relief.

1420
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
We're the Rivera family,

1421
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
and we will be with USAA
for life.

TALK ABOUT BUYER'S REGRESSION.

1440
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
LUCKILY THE STORE CLERK WAS FINE

1441
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
AND DIDN'T GET HIT IN THE HEAD

1442
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
