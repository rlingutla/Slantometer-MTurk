INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
TONIGHT -- TONIGHT I ORDERED A TARGETED MILITARY STRIKE ON AIRFIELD IN SYRIA.
AS U.N.
THAT'S IMPORTANT.
THE STRIKES GIVE THE SYRIAN BITE AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE.
YOU PROBABLY SEEN THE PICTURE GONE VIRAL OF HIM HOLDING HIS TWIN BABIES.
TO STEP UP AND BEGIN THAT LEADING IN CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT HE NEEDS.
HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT THE AMERICAN STRIKES.
HE HAS THAT TIME AND FLEXIBILITY TO DO SO.
AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RUSSIA?
NOT ONLY A PLANE STILL TAKING OFF FROM THE AIRBASE, THERE STILL BOMBING THE TOWN.
NEW QUESTIONS SURROUNDING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND WHETHER HIS TEAM ARE ACTUALLY ON THE SAME PAGE, AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS NIKKI HALEY SIGNALS THAT PRESIDENT MAY BE IN FAVOR OF REGIME CHANGE IN SYRIA, WE GO TO THAT NOW, BUT SECRETARY OF SAY THE TILLERSON SAID IT IS UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, NATIONAL CLEAR FI FID THOSE COMMENTS.
REPORTER WHICH WEEK'S AIRSTRIKES WERE MEANT TO WEAKEN THE ASSAD REGIME AS A RESPONSES TO THEIR USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPON, TRUMP ADMINISTRATION KNOWS THAT ISIS FIGHTERS WHO SET UP SHOP IN SYRIA ARE A MAJOR NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN AS WELL.
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE A SAY IN USE OF MILITARY FORCE AROUND THE WORLD.
LEADERS MUST LEAVE.
AMBASSADOR HALEY POINTING OUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW A POLITICAL SOLUTION.
WE KNOW THIS WILL BE HARD WORK.
ARE YOU CONCERNED THE EMOTION BASED UPON THE NEED FOR POLICY?
THE U.S. NAVY SEAL, HE HAS SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN THAT WAY.
HE WAS REUNITED WITH FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DID SURVIVE, THOUGH HE LOST 22.
AND SAID THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO GET INVOLVED IMMEDIATELY, SCOTT TAYLOR A FORMER NAVY SEAL, AND MEMBER OF HOMELAND SECURITY, HE WILL JOIN ME LATER THIS HOUR, STAY CLOSE.
