INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND THEN PANDEMONIUM STRUCK.
THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, THAT 26-MILE ROUTE.
EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.
THEN CHAOS EVERYWHERE.
AUTHORITIES WOULD NOT SPECULATE ON WHETHER IT WAS TERRORISM.
RACE OF A DIFFERENT KIND -- TO RESCUE PEOPLE AND SAVE THEM.
INSTEAD THIS YEAR IT TURNED INTO A HORRIBLE DAY.
A PLACE OF CELEBRATION INSTANTLY TRANSFORMED INTO A SCENE OF CHAOS.
THE MARINE CORPS MARATHON ATTRACTS 30,000 RUNNERS EACH YEAR.
PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING TOURNIQUETS APPLIED ON THE RACEWAY.
THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE TERRORISTS HAVE.
THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO GET SCARED, RUN AWAY.
EVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING THE OTHER WAY.
DOUBLE IT, 52 THE MILES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO SIDES OF THE STREET.
THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW SOMETHING SPECIFIC.
CORRECT?
THE TWO EXPLOSIONS GOING OFF WITHIN SECONDS OF EACH OTHER AT BOSTON'S COPLEY SQUARE.
AT FIRST IT SOUNDED LIKE A CANNON BLAST.
EVERYBODY WAS RUSHING.
