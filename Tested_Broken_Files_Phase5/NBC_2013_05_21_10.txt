MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME.
OUR REPORT ON THAT TONIGHT FROM NBC'S TOM COSTELLO.
THEY WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USUALLY AT TINKERFIELD OR FAA.
MM-HMM.
IT WAS LOUD.
LOOK AT THAT.
THE STREETS ARE JUST GONE.
PARENTS OF OTHER STUDENTS TELL NBC NEWS CHILDREN WERE IN THAT AUDITORIUM.
SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO IDENTIFY VARIOUS AREAS OF NEED.
AMONG THEM 9-YEAR-OLD JANAE HORNSBY.
HAD NOT BUILT ANY COMMUNITY TORNADO SHELTERS BECAUSE THE TOWN SAID IT FACED ONLY A 1% TO 2% CHANCE OF A TORNADO EVER HITTING ON ANY SPRING DAY.
SO WE MADE IT TO THE CORNER OF THE STORM SHELTER BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO LEAVE.
HAVE SAFE ROOMS, BUT THEY'RE EXPENSIVE.
ITS VERY BEGINNING AS IT STARTED TO MARCH ALONG ITS PATH.
AND WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE FROM HERE RIGHT AFTER THIS.
SAME BATHROOM CROUCHED UNDER A SINK.
YES, SIR.
THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION OF THOSE EARLY HOURS OF A HECTIC SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION.
TWO ISSUES EMERGED THERE, THE BRAVERY OF THE TEACHERS AND, SECOND, THIS ISSUE OF WHY THERE WASN'T A SHELTER THERE.
HE RODE OUT THE ASSAULT IN A NEIGHBOR'S STORM SHELTER.
