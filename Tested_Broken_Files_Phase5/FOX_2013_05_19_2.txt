INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
ONE OF THE MAIN INGREDIENTS WE NEED FOR THE STORMS IS THE WARM AIR AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND LOOK AT THIS HARRIS TALKING FRONT.
PARKED, OF COURSE.
THE WEIRDEST THING I HAVE SEEN.
WICHITA'S MAYOR SAID THEY ARE DOING A FABULOUS JOB.
IT IS NOT NORMALLY HUMID IN NORTH TEXAS AND THE SOUTHERN PART OF OKLAHOMA.
YOU SEE ON THE BACK EDGE OF IT THERE IN OKLAHOMA CITY A LITTLE PEEK OF DAYLIGHT AND PEOPLE THERE ARE TOLD T HEED THE WARNINGS WITH BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN BREAKS LIKE THIS IN THE SKIES AND THEN SUDDENLY A WALL CLOUD AND SUDDENLY A LARGE FUNNEL.
OKLAHOMA CITY AND THEN SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY, THE VERY FIRST REPORT [BREAK IN AUDIO] AND THAT IS ABOUT 17 MILES NORTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY, DEBRIS BUT NO INJURIES WE ARE TOLD.
ZOOM DOWN RIGHT THERE AND THEN TAKE A PEEK AT THAT WITH THE VELOCITY SHOTS BECAUSE THIS HAPPENS TO BE ACTUALLY SHOWING THE STRONG ROTATION.
TORNADO WARNINGS SEVERAL IN AND AROUND OKLAHOMA CITY.
I MEAN HARRIS, OBVIOUSLY WE ARE THIS THIS WORLD OF CELL PHONES AND WANNABE STORM CHASERS AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY SCARES ME IS THIS IS WHERE WE WILL SEE THE DEATHS UNFORTUNATELY.
THANKS, JOHN.
I SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE THERE NOT VERY LONG AGO AND THEY HE SAID THAT THEY WERE STARTING TO SEE SOME CLIMATIC ACTIVITY LITERALLY OUT OF THE BACK OF THEIR OFFICE DOOR.
WE BELIEVE A TOUCHDOWN HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK.
SO DIFFERENT THAN A HURRICANE.
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH JENNIFER MONROE THE PUBLIC INFORMATION SPECIALIST FOR THE TOWN OF EDMOND, OKLAHOMA JUST OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA CITY WHERE THEY HAVE SEEN SO MUCH TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AND DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND EVEN SOME INJURIES.
I MEAN THERE IS GOING TO BE OTHER INJURIES AND ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF TORNADO BUT NOT THE TORNADO ITSELF AND THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING TOO.
LIVE COVERAGE OF THE TORNADO OUTBREAK.
I'M TOLD SOME OF THE LIGHTS YOU WILL SEE THAT ARE HITTING TRANSFORMERS GOING OUT AS THE SYSTEMS MOVE THROUGH WITH ALL THEIR POWER.
I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET YOU ANOTHER VIEW OF IT.
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TORNADO CONDITIONS THERE.
