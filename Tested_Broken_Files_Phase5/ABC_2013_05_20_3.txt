PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
OUR EXTREME WEATHER TEAM RIGHT THERE IN THE HEART OF TORNADO ALLEY, WITH THE VERY LATEST ON "WORLD NEWS."
MOMENTS AGO I SPOKE TO A HOSPITAL 12 MILES FROM MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WHERE THE INJURED ARE BEING CARED FOR RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS THE THIRD DAY THAT VIOLENT STORMS HAVE BEEN IN THIS AREA.
SHE GOT HER ARM INJURED.
AND THE THIRD DAY SEEMED TO HAVE DROPPED THE WORST TORNADO OF THEM ALL.
UNBELIEVABLE DESTRUCTION.
IN SOME PARTS, EVERYTHING LEVELED.
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN IN THE TWO SCHOOLS, WHO WERE INSIDE.
WE WERE PULLING WALLS OFF OF PEOPLE.
IT WAS JUST DEBRIS.
NATIONAL GUARD DESCENDING AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAMS RACING INTO TOWN.
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN YET.
BUT THE GYM, TORN APART.
I WANT TO TURN TO ABC'S SAM CHAMPION 26 MILES AWAY FROM LAKE THUNDERBIRD, OKLAHOMA.
WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THE ROADS ARE STILL IMPASSABLE IN THAT AREA, SO IT'S TAKING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET OUT OF THE AREA AND TO OUR HOSPITAL.
IT IS MIND-BLOWING.
YEAH, SHE WAS ON TOP OF ME.
AND THEY GOT UNDER THERE AND SOME OF THE BLOCKS COLLAPSED ON THEM.
THE AMBULANCES ARE SHOWING UP, INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PATIENT AT A TIME, THEY'RE BRINGING THREE AND FOUR PATIENTS AT A TIME.
THEY GOT DOWN.
