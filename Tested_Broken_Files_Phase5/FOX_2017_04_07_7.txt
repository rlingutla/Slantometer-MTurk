INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
RETALIATING IN THAT WAY, IN THAT MEASURED WAY.
RUSSIA WAS ABLE TO SUCCEED AND ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY INTENDED TO DO, PROP UP THE REGIME WHEN THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING OVERTHROWN IN 2015.
SUPPORT A BLOODY DICTATOR, THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD KNOW IT.
THE RUSSIANS OR THE SYRIAN REGIME WAS TRYING TO DESTROY AND COVER UP EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS.
WAS A MESSAGE.
MORE OF A RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF DETERRENCE.
OFFICIALS SAY THE STRIKES WIPED OUT MOST OF THEM, BUT THEY SAY A COUPLE ARE LEFT.
I WISH HE CAME BEFORE.
ANY COUNTRY THAT CHOOSES TO DEFEND THE ATROCITIES OF THE REGIME WILL HAVE TO DO SO IN PUBLIC VIEW FOR THE WORLD TO HEAR.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE THE AIR STRIKES TARGETED.
CLEARLY A LOT CHANGED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
INSTEAD OF A OVERWORKED STATEMENT ABOUT A JOINT FIGHT BETWEEN THE ENEMY, ISIS, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROVED THAT THEY WILL FIGHT THE LEGITIMATE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN A TOUGH CONTRADICTION WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WITHOUT U.N. APPROVAL.
YOU WHETHER IT WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO OR NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STRATEGY IS.
WE SQUANDERED ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES, SHEP, TO DO SOMETHING FAVORABLE HERE FOR THE SYRIAN PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS.
STRIKE COULD LEAD TO A POLITICAL SOLUTION AND THERE'S A CLEAR PATH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GET THERE.
THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER IS NOW SAYING THAT THE SYRIAN STRIKES HAVE PUT THE UNITED STATES ON THE VERGE OF A MILITARY CLASH.
THIS WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT EVERYTHING IS.
THIS RESPONSE WAS A ONE-TIME RESPONSE HOPEFULLY TO DETER FUTURE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
AMBASSADOR HALEY CALLED OUT MOSCOW SAYING THE RUSSIANS HAVE STOOD BESIDE SYRIA EVERY TIME BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS CROSSED THE LINE OF HUMAN DECENCY.
WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?
