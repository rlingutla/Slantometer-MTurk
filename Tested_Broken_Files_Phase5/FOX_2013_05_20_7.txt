IN CASE YOU GET 16 MINUTES OF WARNING WHICH FRANKLY IS A LONG TIME.

IT CUT A PATH THROUGH MOORE AND SURROUNDING AREAS LIKE NOTHING ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN.
AND DOWN BELOW YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO BECOME RESCUERS THIS AFTERNOON LOOKING FOR ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED BENEATH ANYBODY WHO MIGHT NEED HELP  THEY ARE COMPARING THIS TO THE GREAT STORM OF 1999 WHICH RECORD THROUGH THIS AREA BETWEEN 900 P.M. AND MIDNIGHT.

WE DO NOT YET KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HURT OR DEAD.
VASTLY COMPLICATING MATTERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE.
