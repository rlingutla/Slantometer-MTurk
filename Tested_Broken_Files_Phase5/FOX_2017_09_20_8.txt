THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WERE PEOPLE EVACUATED EFFICIENTLY?
THE WINDS BEGAN AT 100 A.M.
THIS IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE DAMAGE IN ST. CROIX, ONE OF THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.
THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX MARIA AS IT BATTERS PUERTO RICO.
SO COMMUNICATIONS ARE ALSO VERY LIMITED AND THE ISLAND'S POWER AUTHORITY IS MASSIVELY IN DEBT.
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND DO NOT HAVE COMMUNICATION AT THIS TIME.
THE NUMBER 1 CLIENT IS THE WATER COMPANY.
THE ISLAND'S REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS AND RIDING OUT THE STORM IN A CLOSET EAST OF SAN JUAN.
OFFICIALS IN ST. CROIX WARNED PEOPLE TO STAY AWAKE MOST OF THE NIGHT AND KEEP THEIR SHOES ON IN CASE THEY NEEDED TO RUN.
PULLING TO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND AROUND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST.
I WANT TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND FEMA DIRECTOR FOR THEIR CALLS AND THEIR DILIGENCE.
THESE HURRICANES CAUSING MORE PROBLEMS FOR AN ISLAND THAT HAS SPENT YEARS IN FINANCIAL CRISIS.
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WINDS.
WE SAW POWER CREWS OUT ON FOOT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.
WE'VE SEEN TREES SNAPPED, PARTS OF WELL-MADE STRUCTURES COLLAPSE.
THE RUSSIA ARE THE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS STAYING TO THE NORTH OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE IDEA OF THE D.R.
THAT WAS 145 MILES PER HOUR WINDS EARLIER THIS MORNING.
THE WINDS WERE DRAMATIC AND POSSIBLY DEADLY.
FEARS ARE FOR THE VERY YOUNG AND THE VERY OLD.
