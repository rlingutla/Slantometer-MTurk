WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS FEARFUL THAT IN THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA YOU GET, THAT THERE IS THE ABILITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SYNTHESIZE THAT DATA AND LEARN SOMETHING MORE.
THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST NEWSPAPER REPORTS SNOWDEN PROVIDED UNVERIFIED DOCUMENTS TO PROVE HIS STORY.
71% SAY WE CAN DO BETTER.
ED?
TODAY DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAID SHE WAS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS AND THEIR ACCESS TO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION BUT AN EXPERT SAYS THE CHALLENGE FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE'S SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH WALL STREET AND SILICON VALLEY FOR THE BEST TECHNICAL MINDS.
I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DO REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS NEWSCAST ED SNOWDEN IS APPARENTLY MAKING NEW CLAIMS ABOUT THE U.S.
YEAH, HE SAID HE HAD MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FLEE BUT, INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO STAY AND FIGHT.
HE CALLS THAT BLATANT HYPOCRISY SAYING AND I'M QUOTING HERE, NOT ONLY DOES IT DO SO BUT IT IS SO AFRAID OF IT BEING KNOWN THAT IT IS WILLING TO USE ANY MEANS SUCH AS DIPLOMATIC INTIMIDATION TO PREVENT THIS INFORMATION FROM BECOMING PUBLIC MUCH THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS ASKED TODAY ABOUT TARGETING FOREIGN COMPUTERS AND RESPONDED THIS WAY.
THE NSA DIRECTOR IS ALSO DEBUNKING ONE OF SNOWDEN'S PREVIOUS CLAIMS.
FIRST QUESTION ASKED HOW FOLKS FEEL ABOUT THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL LEADERS.
SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T KNOW HE IS IN 312 YET?

WELL BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT AMERICA HAS LONG SAID THAT IT DOES NOT TARGET CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE UNLIKE ITS ADVERSARIES, SHEP.
AND HE NOTES THE PROCESS OF GETTING A SECURITY CLEARANCE IS THE SAME WHETHER YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE OR A CONTRACTOR.
NOW HE SAYS HE IS READY TO FACE JUSTICE IN HONG KONG.
HERE, REMEMBER THIS?
5% SAY THEY HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE.
52% SAYING HE SHOULD RESIGN.
