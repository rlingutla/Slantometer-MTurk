THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
RIGHT NOW THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THAT VERIFIED BUT CERTAINLY HAVE IT ON HAND AND HAVE IT AT THE READY RIGHT NOW THEY WILL STAY IT'S A STANDOFF BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND THE SUSPECT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HIDING IN A BOAT.
AND SO NOW WE KNOW HE IS INJURED, HE IS IN THAT BOAT.
JARED?
THROUGHOUT THE DAY WATERTOWN WAS IN LOCKDOWN AS WERE ALL THE COMMUNITIES AROUND IT AS WAS THE CITY OF BOSTON.
GOING AROUND THE BASE -- YOU SEE THE WINDOWS DOWN THERE WITH THE WHITE SHUTTERS, THEY WERE WALKING AROUND THE FRONT OF THAT HOME.
WE SAW PEOPLE WITH WEAPONS RUSHING HURRIED AROUND THE EDGE OF THE HOME AT THE END OF THE STREET.
IT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD OF LARGER HOMES.
ABOUT 10 SECOND INTERVAL AND THEN WE HEARD A THIRD SHOT.
THEY SEARCHED THIS BOAT IN THE BACK OF THIS HOME AT 57 FRANKLIN STREET AS WELL.
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS CONNECTION IS TO THIS HOUSE.
SOURCES TELLING US NOW THAT THE SUSPECT IS INJURED FROM LAST NIGHT FROM LAST NIGHT'S CAR CHASE.
IT MIGHT BE THAT THIS SUSPECT IS INDEED DOWN AS MY STATE POLICE SOURCE IS TELLING ME.
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM STATIONED ALL OVER THE AREA.
THE IDENTITY, THEY TOLD US TO GET OUT OF THE AREA.
[HELICOPTER] [GUNFIRE]  HOLY, HOLY.
IT'S VERY TENSE.
CAN SEE THEY ARE NOT SPEEDING ANYMORE AND THE SIRENS ARE NOT BLARING.
BLACK TRUCKS AND THE DEA AND EVERYTHING.
WE HAVE A RESIDENT FROM WATERTOWN WHO LIVES A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE SPOT WHERE THIS ACTIVITY IS GOING.
RIGHT.
