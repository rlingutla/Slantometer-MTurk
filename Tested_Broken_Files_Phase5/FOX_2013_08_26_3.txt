THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THEY OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KEEP AS MUCH AS THIS BEHIND CLOSE THE DOORS AS THEY CAN.
PRESIDENT ASAN AS DEFIANT AS EVER?
WE WILL WILL GO LIVE TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE LATEST ON THE MILITARY OPTIONS COMING UP ON "THE FOX REPORT."
DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL SAYS THE U.S. IS LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS TO RESPOND TO A SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN.
IN THE INTERVIEW PRESIDENT ASSAD SAID QUOTE  THINK MEANING THE UNITED STATES CAN START A WAR BUT THEY WILL NOT KNOW WHERE IT WILL SPREAD OR HOW IT WILL END.
JOHN KERRY SAYS EVIDENCE IS REAL AND COMPELLING, HE SAYS THERE MUST BE CONSEQUENCES.
BUT U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE ALREADY MADE THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS.
THESE WERE THE STRONGEST COMMENTS YET FROM ANYONED IN THE ADMINISTRATION.
UNITED STATES IS LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS.
THIS IS THE FOX REPORT, TONIGHT, OF THE EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA IS UNDENIABLE.
FIRED FROM AIRPLANES THAT WOULD BE FLYING BELOW SYRIAN RADAR.
THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE TABLE.
IST WARSHIPS IN STRIKING DISTANCE OF SYRIA.
THAT'S WHY REPUBLICAN JOHN MCCAIN TODAY DECLARED THE PRESIDENT BETTER BACK UP THESE WORDS.
THAT FROM SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY.
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IS CONSIDERING THE OPTIONS FOR A POSSIBLE MILITARY RESPONSE.
YEAH, THEY MAY HAVE DECIDED TO DO THAT JON, SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY THOSE YATIONS WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE FACED IN DOING THEIR JOB INSIDE SYRIA.
UNDER PRETTY HEAVY PRESSURE FROM REPUBLICANS TO ACT.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY CAME OUT TODAY AND RATHER DRAMATICALLY DECLARED THAT IN FACT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL ATTACK AND THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
THAT'S THE WORD FROM PENTAGON OFFICIALS.
