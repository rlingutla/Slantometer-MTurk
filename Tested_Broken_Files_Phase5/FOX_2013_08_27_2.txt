INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
MEANTIME, THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL SAYS DIPLOMACY IS STILL BY FAR THE PREFERRED MEANS OF ENDING THIS CRISIS.
IF ANY AGGRESSION WERE TO TAKE PLACE, WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS.
ALSO WORTH NOTING BILL THAT THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HAS RECALLED PARLIAMENT FROM ITS SUMMER RECESS.
OR NO ACTION.
WHAT WOULD A U.S. MILITARY STRIKE LOOK LIKES A IT STANDS NOW?
SAYING THERE MUST BE A RESPONSE TO LAST WEEK'S ATTACK.
THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED HUNDREDS THERE.
LEAST SOME OF THEM ANY WAY SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD NOT BE SOME SORT OF SYMBOLIC HIT OR ATTACK, ED?
NOW THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS THERE IS NO DOUBT THE U.S. WILL RESPOND.
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE BBC, HAGEL SAID U.S. WARSHIPS ARE STANDING BY AWAITING ORDERS.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO OPERATE UNILATERALLY WITHOUT CONGRESS.
BUT SYRIA REMAINS DEFIANT.
JOE BIDEN SAID THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO IS TO BLAME.
NATIONAL SECURITY IS STRENGTHENED WHEN WE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL NORMS.
THE WHITE HOUSE PLANS TO SHOW SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS BEHIND THE ATTACK.
AND THE WORLD SHUNNED DISTANT IDOLLY BY.
TO SURRENDER OR TO DEFEND OURSELVES USING THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE.
CHUCK HAGEL SPOKE TO HIS BRITISH AND FRENCH COUNTER PARTS BY PHONE TODAY.
BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO EXPLAIN THE MISSION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MCCAIN SAYING TONIGHT HE CAN'T JUST BE SOME SYMBOLIC MOVE TO BACK UP THE PRESIDENT'S RHETORIC FROM LAST SUMMER ABOUT A RED LINE ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
ANY PLANS TO SECURE ASSAD'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD REQUIRE SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
