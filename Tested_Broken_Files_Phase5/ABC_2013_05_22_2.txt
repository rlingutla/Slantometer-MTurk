EVENING, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME TONIGHT WE HEAR AND SEE THE MOMENT THAT TORNADO HIT ONE OF THOSE TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.
IT'S JUST NOT -- THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO BE TOUGH, GET UP AND GET IT DONE.
 THIS WEEK WE WATCHED ABC'S MIKE BOETTCHER, WALK THE STREETS IN OKLAHOMA, HIS HOME STATE.
WOW, OH, MY GOD.
COMPLETE DARKNESS.
[ WIND AND SCREAMING ] FROM THE TORNADO TOOK HOLD OF THAT SCHOOL, THAT BATHROOM, FELT THE AIR PUSHING DOWN.
WE'LL COME TOGETHER AND BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.
THAT CONVERSATION HAS BEGUN.
IT'S ALMOST OVER!
TEACHER WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT SHE WAS SEEING.
THIS IS WHERE WE WALKED DOWN, AND I WAS RIGHT HERE.
WE'VE DONE IT ONCE ALREADY.
WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.
YEAH.
SO MANY STORIES, BUT THAT WAS TRULY STUNNING.
SHE TELLS DAVID MUIR HOW THEY ALL MADE IT OUT.
IT'S ALMOST OVER.
PLAYGROUND HERE?
BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL VISIT OKLAHOMA THIS WEEKEND, AND ABC'S DAVID MUIR LEADS OUR COVERAGE ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH THAT EXCLUSIVE.
THIS IS THE PLAYGROUND.
