HER NAME IS FLY.
EVEN FAMILY PHOTOS LIKE THIS, A FATHER AND A MOTHER AND MAYBE THEIR LITTLE GIRL.
TODAY WE WENT TO MEET THEM.
COMING RIGHT FOR THE SCHOOL.
SHE HAS LOST HER HOME TO A TORNADO -- TWICE.
WATCH THIS.
THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME.
BUT AMID THE WRECKAGE, THERE IS A LOOK TO THE FUTURE.
A LITTLE GIRL'S PINK TIARA.
TWO TIMES IN THAT CELLAR.
AND TONIGHT FAMILIES SHOW US HOW THEY EMERGED FROM UNDERGROUND SHELTERS TO SEE THEIR HOMES SIMPLY ERASED.
JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON THE AIR, ANOTHER VISIT TO THE HOME RIGHT HERE BESIDE US.
AND COMING UP NEXT HERE, HOW THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER STILL WAVES IN OKLAHOMA TONIGHT.
THOSE TWO INGREDIENTS MIX TOGETHER AND OFTEN AND, UNFORTUNATELY, MAKE FOR DEVASTATION.
AND THAT WE BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER, NO MATTER WHAT.
HIS CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS THAT HAD BEEN IN HIS ATTIC, WERE IN HIS DRIVEWAY.

WE BEGIN WITH A SPECIAL EDITION OF "WORLD NEWS" TONIGHT.
