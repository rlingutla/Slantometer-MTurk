THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
OUR FIRST LOOK AT GROUND ZERO WHERE HURRICANE MARIA MADE LANDFALL, AND WE'RE WITH THE MILITARY AMID A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS LIKE FEW WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET IT LINKED INTO THE FAA SYSTEM.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP, WE'VE PUT A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS ON OUR WEBSITE.
ALSO A 2 TO 4-FOOT STORM SURGE AND DANGEROUS SURF BEFORE THIS STORM TURNS FURTHER OUT TO SEA.
OR PEOPLE JUST A SHORT DISTANCE FROM US GATHERED IN A LONG LINE FOR A RESTAURANT ABLE TO SERVE FOOD.
THE MARINES ARE HERE, THE MARINES ARE LANDING.
WHILE IT'S NOT A THREAT TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE U.S., TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ARE EXPECTED ON THE OUTER BANKS OF NORTH CAROLINA.
GAS STATIONS.
THE U.S. MILITARY DELIVERING HUMANITARIAN AID, LAUNCHING RELIEF MISSIONS FROM THE "USS KEARSARGE" BY AIR AND SEA.
SAN JUAN PASTOR ANTONIO FONT RUNS THIS MASSIVE CHURCH THAT HIS FATHER BUILT AND MARIA RIPPED APART.
TO HELP CLEAR ROADS.
SEE THE RAMP IS LINED WITH PLANES FROM NATIONAL GUARD UNITS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, KENTUCKY AND TEXAS AND MISSOURI.
WHAT'S IT LIKE FLYING INTO THE HURRICANE ZONES IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING OUT THE WINDOW WHEN YOU'RE DESCENDING?
THIS WOMAN SNAGGING WATER FROM THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN.
AND THIS WOMAN HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH HER FAMILY IN INDIANAPOLIS.
AND TO SEE IT JUST DESTROYED IN JUST A FEW HOURS IS REALLY SAD, BUT WE ARE A CHURCH OF HOPE.
IT'S A LITTLE DISTRACTING, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
A LOT OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE USE TO NAVIGATE AREN'T UP.
THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.
WE SPEND MOST OF THE TIME TRYING TO DO THIS OVERSEAS, OVER IN A WAR ZONE.
