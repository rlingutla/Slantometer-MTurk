INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE STORM HIT AND BLEW AWAY THE MAYOR'S ROOF.
THE POWER IS OFF.
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH WOODEN HOUSES.
I KNOW THIS NATION AND THE GENEROUS PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL RESPOND AS THEY ALWAYS DO.
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO REMEMBER THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS JUST LIKE ALL OF US.
SO IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AS THE SYSTEM PASSED TO THE SOUTH OF THE ISLANDS LAST NIGHT, THE WINDS EXPANDED AND THEY BASICALLY -- THEY HAD UP TO ABOUT 137 MILES PER HOUR WINDS.
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW DEALING WITH ITS THIRD NATURAL DISASTER IN LESS THAN A MONTH.
OUR VIEWERS WATCHING ACROSS THE 48 AND AROUND THE WORLD THIS AFTERNOON, WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO HELP YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO?
FORECASTERS SAY HURRICANE FORCE WINDS EXTEND 60 MILES FROM THE EYE OF MARIA.
THE RAIN HORIZONTAL AND ALL THE TREES ON THE GROUND.
IN SOME CASES, THEY'RE DANGEROUS BY YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE UNDERFUNDED AND COULD BE OVERWHELMED BY THE STORM.
IT'S THE THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN A MONTH THAT A HURRICANE LANDFALL ON THE U.S.
ACTUALLY, A LOT OF COMMUNICATION TOWERS WENT DOWN AND ARE OFF LINE.
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE NOW?
NOW ALL OF PUERTO RICO IS WITHOUT POWER RIGHT NOW.
OFFICIALS SAY THE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS STORM KNOCKED OUT POWER TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND.
THEY WERE WALKING TO TRY TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE.
GOING FORWARD, FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES.
THEY DO HAVE DAMAGE TO THEIR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.
THE STORM HAS SNAPPED PALM TREES, PEELED OFF ROOFTOPS.
