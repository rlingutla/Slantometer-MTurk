THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AT THIS POINT IT'S BETWEEN 1 AND 2 MILES WIDE.
IT REMINDS ME WHEN I DROVE THROUGH JOPLIN, MISSOURI TO GO SEE MY PARENTS WHERE THE HEART OF THAT FRMT-5 HIT.
ONE OF TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLINGS STRUCK BY THIS MASSIVE TORNADO THIS AFTERNOON ALL STUDENTS AT BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ARE NOW ACCOUNTED FOR.
CUTTING JUST TO THE SOUTH AND MOORE.
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT PATH.
BEAR WITH ME.
THAT THIS TORNADO WAS ON A PATH SO EERILY SIMILAR TO ONE FROM 1999.
A SCENE OF UNTHINKABLE DEVASTATION.
ANDREA ASH'S HUSBAND AND HER SON ARE OVER THERE TRYING TO GET DESPERATELY TO THAT VICTIM.
WE DO KNOW THAT DOZENS OF PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED.
OF COURSE, THE CHOPPERS HOVER.
THE AREA OF DEVASTATION HERE IS MUCH LARGER.
RUSHED GLANCES TO BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY COOL ONE OF TWO WE MENTIONED TO THE MOORE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SEVERAL HOMES BUSINESSES AND INTERSECTIONS SPAWNING TO MULTIPLE INJURIES.
THOSE WHO SURVIVED HAVE BECOME RESCUE WORKERS.
BUT THE LATEST NEWS IS BAD.
AND I WONDER HOW THE PEOPLE OF YOUR SMALL TOWN ARE COPING THIS LATE AFTERNOON.
SIMILAR NEIGHBORHOODS HIT NOW LEVELED.
WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT SORT OF INJURIES THEY HAVE, SEPTEMBER WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD IN THE LAST HOUR.
THEY VASTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SHELTERS TORNADO SHELTERS STORM SHELTERS THEY GOT WORD TODAY 16 MINUTES BEFORE THIS MASSIVE TORNADO CAME TO TOWN THEY NEED TO TAKE SHELTER IMMEDIATE CATTILY.
LATE IN THE SCHOOL DAY AT PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY PLACE DID NOT DO IT.
