INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW THERE WERE CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN THE PAST, THAT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS PRESIDENT HAD BEEN BUTCHERING HIS OWN CIVILIANS TO THE TUNE OF 500,000 PEOPLE OVER SEVEN YEARS.
THERE WILL BE A RANGE OF OPTIONS PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT ON HOW HE COULD RESPOND MILITARY.
THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER POLITICAL DEBATE AND WHOLE OTHER HURDLE.
LET'S GO BACK TO A.B.
HE CHOSE THE BAD OPTION THAT WAS TO REMAIN OUT OF THIS CONFLICT LARGELY.
PEOPLE IS A WAR CRIME.
THERE'S RUSSIANS EVERYWHERE THERE.
HE DIDN'T ACT.
GLENN WAS THE FIRST AMERICAN TO ORBIT THE EARTH.
THE NEWS WITH SHEP CONTINUES AFTER THIS.
THIS IS A VERY BIG CHANGE OF MIND AFTER THE ATTACK.
A ROUTINE LEADER SUMMIT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE ALL TOGETHER.
ARE WE GOING TO GO TO WAR AGAINST THEM OR ARE WE GOING TO TRY TO COAX THE RUSSIANS INTO DEPOSING AL-ASSAD WITH US?
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE DIFFUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN ST. PETERSBURG AND ARRESTED THREE PEOPLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBWAY BOMBING.
HE SAID THE UNITED STATES IS ORGANIZING AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO RESPOND TO BASHAR AL-ASSAD'S CHEMICAL ATTACK ON HIS OWN PEOPLE.
A SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A REBEL FACTORY.
THOSE ARE THE VERY BIG QUESTIONS THAT HAVE JUST ARISEN ON AN ENORMOUS NEWS DAY.
AGAIN THAT MEETING IN RUSSIA SAYS IT WILL BE SO PIVOTAL.
STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE UNITED STATES WITH SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON STILL EXPLORE A RELATIONSHIP WORKING TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA ON AREAS THAT BENEFIT THE UNITED STATES.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL BREAK.
