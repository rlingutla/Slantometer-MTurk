PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
TONIGHT IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE COMING OUT.
LOOK AT THAT SCHOOL, GUYS.
AN ENORMOUS, PERHAPS HISTORIC PATH OF DESTRUCTION AFTER A DIRECT HIT FROM A TORNADO ESTIMATED AT A MILE WIDE.
THESE HOMES ARE FLATTENED.
THERE IS A PUNGENT ODOR TO HAVE NATURAL GAS AND GASOLINE.
IT IS A SCENE OF UTTER DESTRUCTION, ALMOST BEYOND WORDS.
SADLY, I FATHER YOU ARE RIGHT.
SHE'S OKAY.
MIKE SEIDEL, NOT MUCH LEFT IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
CARS ON TOP OF CARS.
HONESTLY IT'S NOT JUST THE SCHOOL THAT GOT HIT.
I STILL HAVE A LITTLE GIRL BURIED IN THERE.
WE WERE INSIDE THE CELLAR DOOR.
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE OUTSIDE OF MOORE.
WE DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.
WE THOUGHT WE DIED.
AS A PARENT THIS IS KIND OF HARD TO REPORT ON.
WE TALKED TO ONE SCHOOL TEACHER A LITTLE BIT AGO.
VIOLENT, VIOLENT MOTION, A HUGE DEBRIS CLOUD AROUND IT.
