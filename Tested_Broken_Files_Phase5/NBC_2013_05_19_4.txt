OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT'S GOING TO BE HEADING FOR --  RIGHT IN FRONT OF US!
BASEBALL-SIZED HAIL.
I JUST DON'T TAKE CHANCES WITH TORNADOES.
SO THE TURNING OF THOSE WINDS ALLOWS THE STORMS TO DEVELOP ROTATION.
JUST WITHIN THE LAST HOUR WE HEARD THE TORNADO SIRENS MULTIPLE TIMES.
ONE MILE SOUTH OF WATERLOO ROAD.
KELLY, WHAT AREAS ARE ON ALERT?
WOW!
THEY COULD BE LARGE AND LONG-LIVED, THAT MEANS LASTING FOR MILES ON THE GROUND.
IN OKLAHOMA CITY, 70-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS TOOK DOWN BLOCK AFTER BLOCK OF POWER LINES.
BIG-TIME DEBRIS CLOUD.
RESIDENTS ARE AWARE TONIGHT AND MONDAY COULD BE EVEN WORSE.
SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS AND TORNADO WATCHES ARE UP IN AT LEAST SIX STATES TONIGHT.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE TORNADO WATCHES FROM GO FROM WISCONSIN AS WELL AS THE TWIN CITIES, DOWN INTO TULSA.
REMIND FOLKS THE WEATHER CHANNEL IS COVERING THIS ONLINE AND ON CABLE.
THE PICTURES ARE VERY DRAMATIC, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED THIS UNFOLD LIVE ON THE WEATHER CHANNEL.
IT IS RIGHT OVER US BUT WE CAN STILL SEE IN CONTACT WITH THE GROUND FARTHER OFF TOWARD THE NORTHEAST.
I PROBABLY DRIVE BACK CLOSE TO OKLAHOMA CITY AND JUST STAY IN THAT UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE FOR A WHILE.
THERE IS A CLEARING NOW BUT LESTER, WE'RE TOLD THE VERY WORST OF THIS STORM COULD BE STILL TO COME TONIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW.
SEVERE WEATHER BREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW FROM THE PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES.
