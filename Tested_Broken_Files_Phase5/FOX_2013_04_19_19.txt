BOB, I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE.
WE HAVE CORRESPONDENTS AND CREWS ON SCENE FOX 25 LIVE TO YOU ACROSS THE NATION.
BOB, IS THERE A HELICOPTER OVERHEAD AT THIS POINT?
AND WE BELIEVE THEY ARE AT 67 FRANKLIN STREET.
I HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.
AND IT'S A STREET THAT -- THE CIRCLE OF STREETS THAT I TAKE MY DOG WITH AND WE WERE JUST READY TO COME TO THE END OF RUSSELL AND CROSS OVER AND WE JUST HEARD LIKE THIS POP, POP POPPING KIND OF LIKE FIREWORK POPCORN FIRE.
HE IS IN THERE.
A 20 BLOCK AREA WHERE SWATTED TEAMS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL -- ARMORED -- BODY ARMORED PEOPLE, AUTHORITIES FROM THE FBI THE LOCAL POLICE, THE STATE POLICE ALL WENT IN AND NOW THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND HIM.
BUT IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO GO THERE WE HEARD FROM AUTHORITIES EARLIER TODAY THEY CAN'T BE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE INVOLVED BESIDES THESE TWO SUSPECTS.
SWAT TEAM PULLED BACK.
AND WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON IT.
