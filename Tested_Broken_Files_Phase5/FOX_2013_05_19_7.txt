PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT HAS BEEN BETTER OF SIX HOURS OR MORE WHERE THEY HAVE GONE FROM WATCHES TO WARNINGS.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS AREA OF THE COUNTRY THEY ARE USED TO IT AND HOPEFULLY THEY ARE HEEDING THE WARNINGS AS WE BRING THEM TO THEM.
CONFIRMED REPORTS OF TORNADOES ON THE GROUND IN THE NORMAN, OKLAHOMA AREA.
AND IT HAPPENED AS THE SUN WAS SETTING.
BUT SOUTH OF THAT WE ARE IN THE THE COLDER DRYER AIR.
I MADE SURE THEY HAD THEIR CELL PHONES CHARGE AND KNEW WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO GO IF IT HITS.
AS WE TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT BREAK LET'S WATCH AND LISTEN.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE AS IT WAS COMING ACROSS YOUR TOWN?
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE DEPENDING ON THEIR WEATHER PEOPLE TO WARN THEM AND KEEP THEM OUT OF HARM'S WAY.
HEADING BACK DOWN TOWARDS PINK AND LITTLE AXE THERE FOR YOU IN NORTHEASTERN MCLEAN COUNTY.
THESE ARE TWO REALLY SIGNIFICANT STORMS RIGHT NOW.
RIGHT ALONG RIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY RIGHT THERE.
AFTERWARDS WE WENT OUTSIDE TO LOOK AROUND AND MY HUSBAND DUG A COUPLE OF LARGE HAIL STONES THAT HAD ACTUALLY GONE DOWN INTO THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO FIND SOMETHING TO COMPARE IT TO AND THAT IS A GRAPEFRUIT NEXT TO THE HAIL PIECES DALLAS.
I AM KEEPING MY EYES ON THAT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS IS POPPING.
A LOT OF ADVANCE NOTICE TO GO TO YOUR SHELTERS AND YOU COULD ALMOST TRACK IT FOR MILES AND MILES JUST BY LISTENING TO OUR MEDIA.
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE STORY TALKING WITH STORM CHASERS AND BRINGING YOU AS MUCH VIDEO COMING IN TO FOX NEWS.
TAKE CHASER NET TWO FULL, PLEASE.
THAT WAS LIVE VIDEO HE THAT YOU SAW THERE.
WHAT HAPPENS IS WE ARE SCANNING THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND HERE AND THAT IS WHY EVERYTHING LOOKS SO FUNNY AND USUALLY SOMETHING SO CLOSE TO THE RADAR IT IS HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON.
THIS IS EDMOND, OKLAHOMA WHERE WE KNOW THERE WAS A LARGE TOUCHDOWN.
