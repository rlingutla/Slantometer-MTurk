INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THAT'S NOT SPECULATION ON OUR PART.
HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT TODAY BUT HE DID SAY THIS IN A SPEECH ON THE ECONOMY.
OVER THESE SCENES OF HORROR AND SUFFERING IN SYRIA.
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND FROM NOW ON, IT'S GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.
CHANGE IN LONGTIME U.S. POLICY THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD MUST GO.
REX TILLERSON IGNORED QUESTIONS ON THE ATTACK.
MR. SECRETARY, ANY COMMENT ON THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA?
BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL DO ABOUT IT AND WHETHER THEY NOW WANT ASSAD TO GO.
GASPING FOR AIR TO SURVIVE.
BUT THE STATEMENT ALSO TOOK AIM AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
AT LEAST SOME OF THE WEAPONS REMAINED.
BASHAR AL ASSAD SHOULD STILL BE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA?
WHILE THIS LOCAL ACTIVIST REPORTED FROM ONE OF THOSE HOSPITALS, IT WAS HIT WITH ANOTHER AIRSTRIKE.
I THINK THE STATUS IN THE LONGER TERM STATUS OF PRESIDENT ASSAD WILL BE DECIDED BY THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
THE IMAGES ARE DISTURBING.
CHILDREN CLINGING TO LIFE, STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.
AND THE MOMENT ANOTHER EXPLOSION HITS.
THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HOLD ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
OUR TEAM MAKING CONTACT WITH A DOCTOR ON THE GROUND.
FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AMONG THE VICTIMS.
