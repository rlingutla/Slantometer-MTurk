THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS, LOOKING AT THE PLACE THEY ONCE CALLED HOME, A BABY DOLL IN THEIR HANDS.
AND, ACCORDING TO THAT STUDY, SHE IS ONE IN 100 TRILLION, THOSE LONG ODDS YOUR HOME GETS HIT BY AN EF-4 TORNADO TWICE.
THOUGH AUTHORITIES WON'T SAY FOR SURE IF THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY CHILDREN STILL INSIDE.
THE INTERNET IS SPREADING ANIMALS STORIES AND THE NEED FOR HELP.
THIS IS IT NOW.
ALL FIFTH GRADERS RIGHT HERE!
WE HAVE NEW PICTURES, PROVING THE EPIC SIZE OF THE TORNADO IN OKLAHOMA.
YOU MET WITH ONE OF THEM?
I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THEY'RE FINDING.
I WANT MY MOM.
OKAY.
AND THEN, UM, I FELL BACK, AND ALL THE DIRT THAT GOT IN MY EYES AND I FELL.
THE TEACHERS AT PLAZA TOWERS DIDN'T HAVE THAT BLESSING.
FOREVER.
SOMEBODY'S KEYS THEY LEFT BEHIND.
THAT STUNNING RESEMBLANCE TO MONDAY'S PATH.
THAT WE'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR EACH OTHER.
WE MIGHT HAVE ONE HORSE LEFT OUT OF ALL OF THEM.
EXTRAORDINARY.
THIS IS THE CELLAR WHERE THEY RODE IT OUT AND SURVIVED.
