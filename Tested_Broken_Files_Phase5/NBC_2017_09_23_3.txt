PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
CLUSTER HOPING, PRAYING FOR ONE MEASLY BAR OF CELL SERVICE.
FAMILIES, THEIR ONLY CONNECTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS ONE SPOTTY A.M. RADIO STATION.
BACK HOME, THEY CAN'T HEAR FROM US, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
THE ACTUAL NUMBER WAS MUCH LOWER, JUST HUNDREDS IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES NEAR THE DAM.
THOUSANDS TOLD SO EVACUATE BEFORE WHAT COULD BE AN EPIC FLOOD.
AIRLIFTING AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER TO START THE PROCESS OF RECOVERY.
THE IDEA IS TO USE THIS AIRFIELD AS A STAGING GROUND FOR THE BROADER RELIEF EFFORT.
THIS IS WHAT WE DO ALL DAY.
WE'VE LANDED HERE IN SAINT THOMAS WHERE THE AIRFIELD IS MOSTLY CLEAR OF DEBRIS, THEY'RE BRINGING IN AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL MOBIL COMMAND TOWER.
NEVER HAS IT FELT SO ALONE.
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN, AS FAST AS WE CAN, AS FAST AS WE'RE ALLOWED.
