LIVE COVERAGE FROM WFXT FOX FOR BOSTON AND THE SURROUNDING.
HIS BROTHER WAS FOUND TO HAVE AN IED ON HIMSELF THIS MORNING WHEN THEY IDENTIFIED HIM LATER AFTER HE PASSED AWAY AT BRIGHAM WOMEN'S -- BETH -- HOSPITAL I SHOULD SAY.
THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT THE OLDER OF THE PRO BROTHERS DIED IN WHAT WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE WAS A SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HEARD GUNSHOTS.
THERE WAS THIS THOUGHT OF, YOU KNOW, WE ARE DONE FOR THE NIGHT AND YOU KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK HARD THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT WE FELT LIKE THINGS HAD QUIETED DOWN.
AND THAT YOU HEARD WAS THE SOUND OF 20 TO 30 GUNSHOTS FIRED JUST MOMENTS AGO.
BECAUSETONIANS RESPONDED WELL ESPECIALLY THERE IN WATER TOWN.
HE HAS BEEN HIDING THERE.
THEY SEEM TO BE COMING IN THE BACKYARD OF THAT HOME AT 67 FRANKLIN STREET?
NOW IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.
AND SHE NOTICED WHAT LOOKED BOAT.
I WOULD SAY 10 EXPLOSIONS RIGHT NOW MARK.
APPARENTLY HE IS IN THE BOAT AND REFUSING TO COME OUT.
JUST TRYING TO WATCH AS CLOSELY I CAN.
WE JUST GOT RIGHT DOWN THE STREET AS WE WERE STARTING TO HEAD BACK.
BUT THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE.
EVERYBODY YELLED GUNSHOTS WHEN THEY HEARD THE NOISE.
BOB AGAIN YOUR SOURCES AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO MAYBE ARE JOINING US RIGHT NOW.
