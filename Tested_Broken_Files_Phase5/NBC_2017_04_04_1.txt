OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
MEDICS AND VOLUNTEERS IN THIS REBEL CONTROLLED PART OF SYRIA RUSHED THE INJURED TO LOCAL CLINICS, THEY CLAIM SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD'S REGIME FIRED WITH A CHEMICAL NERVE AGENT BANNED, SARIN.
WITNESSES SAY IT WAS A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD WARNED THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD CROSS A RED LINE.
NOW, IS PRESIDENT TRUMP WILLING TO STEP IN?
ONE OF THE DEADLIEST OF ITS KIND IN SYRIA'S SIX YEARS CIVIL WAR.
TONIGHT, CHEMICAL ATTACK.
IN 2013, THE U.S. THREATENED WAR WHEN MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER ALLEGED CHEMICAL ATTACK.
THE SYRIAN ARMY DENIES IT USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
FIRST RESPONDERS DOUSED THE VICTIMS WITH WATER AND STRIPPED OFF THEIR CLOTHES TO WASH OFF WHAT THEY SAID WAS A CHEMICAL WEAPON.
THERE ARE UPSETTING IMAGES IN THIS REPORT.
AND ANOTHER TROUBLE SPOT OVERSEAS, SYRIA, THE WORLD REACTING WITH HORROR AND REVULSION TO THE APPARENT POISON GAS ATTACK THAT KILLED DOZENS OF CIVILIANS AND SICKENED DOZENS MORE, MANY SMALL CHILDREN.
THERE, A FATHER KISSED HIS DAUGHTER GOOD-BYE.
BUT WHEN RUSSIA BROKERED A DEAL, A U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE NEVER CAME.
CHILDREN GASPING FOR AIR, ASSAD BLAMED FOR A GRISLY MASSACRE ON HIS OWN PEOPLE.
IN A STATEMENT ON TODAY'S ATTACK, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE BASHAR AL ASSAD REGIME ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAST ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS.
NO ONE IS DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THESE DEATH ATTACKS.
VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO A MAKESHIFT CLINIC BUILT IN A CAVE TO PROTECT IT.
A WORD OF CAUTION.
THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT POINTING THE FINGER OF BLAME TO SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD, ALSO CALLING OUT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, SUGGESTING IF IT STOOD UP TO ASSAD DURING ITS WATCH, THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED.
AMAZINGLY, THE ACTIVIST SURVIVED.
