INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
YESTERDAY THIS RUSSIAN WARSHIP PASSED THROUGH TURKISH WATERS HEADING TOWARDS THE SYRIAN COAST.
WAR HAS CAUSED THESE REFUGEES TO FLEE SO WILL MORE WAR ACCELERATE OR ACCENTUATE THE CURRENT INVOLVEMENT?
I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR BOMBING WILL LEAD TO PEACE.
JULIE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXPECT MORE AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ASSAD REGIME BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HINTED THAT THERE ARE MORE TO COME AND OF COURSE THEIR POLICY AT THIS POINT AT LEAST WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE CLEAR IS THAT HE DOESN'T PLAN ON MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
I WOULD SAY THERE WOULD BE MORE DEATHS AND MORE REFUGEES.
SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE THE RIGHT FIRST STEP AND I THINK HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
BY ALL ACCOUNTS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VERY PLEASED THAT HIS DECISION TO STRIKE AND WITH HOW IT'S PLAYING OUT.
WE BEGIN WITH KRISTIN FISHER WHO IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT THIS WEEKEND AT MAR-A-LAGO IN FLORIDA AND KRISTIN IT'S BEEN OVER 48 HOURS SINCE HE TOOK HIS VERY FIRST BIG MILITARY ACTION AS PRESIDENT.
THE SAUDI TEAM CALLED A COURAGEOUS ACT AND SPRAYS BY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON CAPITOL HILL.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOVE TO STRIKE THE SYRIAN AIRBASE WINNING PRAISE FROM OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD WHILE RUSSIA AND IRAN ARE PREVENTING THE ATTACK -- CONDEMNING THE ATTACK.
