OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
OW IF THEY KIND OF SLIPPED IN BUT WE DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF PRESENCE AND THEN WITHIN -- I CAN'T TELL YOU WITHIN TWO MINUTES THE PLACE WAS SUR S COMPLETELY SURROUNDED.
IT REALLY GOT QUIET AFTER THAT PRESS CONFERENCE.
A LOT OF MOVEMENT.
HE HAS IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT AUTHORITIES NEED AS THEY CONTINUE THIS INVESTIGATION.
SHE SAID SHE AND PHOTOGRAPHER MAT TOMLIN WERE RIGHT IN THE AREA AND ACTUALLY HEARD THOSE SHOTS FIRED AND MOMENTS LATER A RUSH OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THE SCENE ON FRANKLIN STREET WHICH IS ON WATER TOWN.
AS BOB WARD SAID HIS SOURCES TELL HIM THIS GUY HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE TO GO AT THIS POINT.
HE WE ARE TRYING TO LISTEN AS WELL.
THAT IS THE WORD.
SO, RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS FAIRLY PEACEFUL WHEN WE HEAR WHAT PAUL SUTHERLAND, AN EYEWITNESS JUST TOLD JARED HOLBROOK ON THE PHONE.
AND AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS LIFTED, YOU COULD HE SEE THE PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE STREET.
TIME IS KIND OF FUZZY RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE HEARD THAT'S THE LAST WE HAVE HEARD.
THEY DID AND IT WAS AFTER THAT, WE'RE LED TO BELIEVE THAT SHE'S SHOTS BEGAN RAPID FIRE, 20 TO 30 SHOTS ACCORDING TO THE LOCALS.
THEY HAVE THE BOMB SQUAD ON HAND AS WELL.
AND WE WERE -- IT'S JUST ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE DOING OUR LIVE SHOT.
DOES HE WANT TO COME OUT AND HE SIMPLY CAN'T BECAUSE HE IS INJURED?
YES.
AND WE ALSO HAD A FIRE RESCUE TRUCK BACK INTO THE AREA AS WELL.
PROGRESS BEING MADE TO APPREHEND THE SUSPECT.
WE HAVE GOT ANOTHER STANDOFF HERE.
A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. LOTS OF HOMES HERE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ARROW BOAT IS THAT THEY BELIEVE A SUSPECT WAS HIDING.
