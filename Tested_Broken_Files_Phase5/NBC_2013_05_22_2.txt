OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE FATHER OF JENAE HORNSBY ANOTHER THIRD GRADER, SPOKE OF THE SEARCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER.
A THIRD OF THE TOWN WAS DESTROYED.
WHEN WE COME BACK, A MESSAGE OF HOPE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, ARE IN FOR.
A VIEW WE HAVEN'T SEEN UNTIL NOW OF THE OKLAHOMA NEIGHBORHOOD AND SCHOOL THAT TOOK A DIRECT HIT.
WE ARE JUST BACK FROM MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WHERE LIFE WON'T BE NORMAL FOR YEARS, WHERE THE EARTH HAS BEEN WIPED CLEAN IN SOME PLACES, AND WHERE THE DEATH TOLL STANDS STILL AT 24, 324 PEOPLE INJURED, TEN CHILDREN INCLUDING TWO INFANTS ARE AMONG THE DEAD.
ALSO HOW SO MANY PEOPLE SURVIVED BY HIDING AND RIDING IT OUT IN SOME UNUSUAL PLACES.
EMERGING IN JOPLIN, ONE THAT LOOKS ALMOST NOTHING LIKE THIS 22-MILE PATH OF DESTRUCTION.
THAT'S A HUGE IMPACT IN A TOWN OF ONLY 56,000.
HEARD AN INTERIOR ROOM WAS THE FASTEST PLACE TO SHELTER IN A PINCH.
AMONG THEM 65-YEAR-OLD HEMMET BONDI.
IF YOU ASK MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE, THEY ARE GOING TO REBUILD AND PROBABLY GET A STORM SHELTER.
FOLLOWING THE RAREST OF ALL TORNADOES, THE EF5, THE MOST POWERFUL ON EARTH.
CONCERN HERE, CLEANING UP AS HEAVY EQUIPMENT CREWS MOVED IN TODAY, SO DID AN ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS, LOADED WITH RAKES, SHOVELS, AND BIG HEARTS.
THEN THE CHILDREN KILLED AT PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LIKE BEST FRIENDS AN TONE I CAN'T CANDELARIA AND EMILY CONATZER.
THERE IS PLENTY OF INSPIRATION TO BE FOUND HERE.
75% OF HOMES HAVE BEEN REBUILT, AND 80% OF NEW HOMES NOW INCLUDE A SAFE ROOM.
THIS IS WHAT BEING OKLAHOMAN IS ABOUT.
ALL I HEARD WAS A -- AND IT WAS QUIET.
JOPLIN IS A CITY OF HOPE.
BACK IN JOPLIN, THE FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE LEARNED THESE PAST TWO YEARS.
