OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT'S ALMOST OVER!
BUT WE NOTICED MRS. MARINELLI'S FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM IN TACT.
SHE SAID MANY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
AND SO MANY OF THEM HAD CHILDREN SOMEPLACE ELSE IN THOSE SCHOOLS.
AND WE SAW THE MOMENT LITTLE SAM FOUND HIS MOTHER, LOOKING UP AT HER, CONCRETE GRIT IN HIS HAIR.
THE CHILDREN BURYING THEIR HEADS AT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY, TRAPPED UNDER THAT TORNADO HOVERING OVERHEAD.
AND -- AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.
AND THE BRAVERY IN OKLAHOMA THIS WEEK.
TOUR OF THAT OTHER SCHOOL, TOO, PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY, WHERE THEY LOST SEVEN LITTLE FACES IN ONE HALLWAY.
I WILL REMEMBER SHE GAVE ME CUPCAKES.
THE SCHOOLWORK RIGHT THERE ON THE DESK WHERE IT WAS LEFT.
MOST EVERYTHING THERE IS GONE.
BOTH SURVIVED.
YES.
WHEN SHE TOOK US BACK THIS WEEK, SHE SHOWED US WHERE HE WAS, IN THE BACK CORNER OF THAT ROOM.
AND JUST BEFORE THAT TORNADO HIT, THEY WERE WRITING WHAT THEY LIKED MOST ABOUT THEIR TEACHER.
SHE TAUGHT THE AUTISTIC CHILDREN.
SO MANY TEACHERS.
ABOUT HER OWN DAUGHTER IN THE FOURTH GRADE OR HER SON IN THE FIRST GRADE.
MRS. DIEDZIK, WHO WAS HELPING HER OWN STUDENTS --  YOU ARE SAFE AND YOU ARE FINE.
