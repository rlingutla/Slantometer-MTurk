INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
OBVIOUSLY THE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN SYRIA WITH THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK HERE IN THE PAST DAY HAVE JUST I THINK HORRIFIED ALL OF US AND BROUGHT TO THE FRONT PAGES INTO OUR TELEVISION SCREENS AS WELL.
THAT I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT BASES AND MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS THERE.
IN 2015, THE RUSSIANS WENT IN AND OWNED THE AIR BASES.
HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN IN ON THAT EFFORT FOR A LONG TIME AS THE UNITED STATES SUPPORTS THE REBELS.
THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR.
86 PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING DOZENS OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
TODAY SENATOR RAND PAUL FROM KENTUCKY SAID IF WE WANT TO CARRY OUT STRIKES IN SYRIA, THERE SHOULD BE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL.
THEY DON'T WANT TO.
REGIME CHANGE.
SO THIS CHEMICAL ATTACK REPRESENTING A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN THE POSITION, MUCH MORE DETAILED FROM THE UNITED STATES AND SECRETARY TILLERSON THAN HE SPOKE ABOUT A WEEK AGO IN TURKEY.
WE'VE HAD VERY BAD RESULTS.
NOW THE QUESTION IS, DO WE LAUNCH WITH A COALITION THAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED A MILITARY STRIKE TO REMOVE THE MURDEROUS DICTATOR FROM THAT COUNTRY?
SO THE POTENTIAL FOR AN ACCIDENT, WHICH WE ALMOST HAD IN 2015 WITH OUR MORE LIMITED AIR STRIKES WITH THE RUSSIANS AND STARTING WORLD WAR III WITH THEM IS VERY HIGH.
A.B.
I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE FOX REPORT.
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO STOP IT.
TILLERSON GOES TO MOSCOW TO TRY TO KEEP AN AVENUE OPEN ON ISSUES THAT WE CAN WORK ON WITH THE RUSSIANS.
THE RUSSIANS SAY THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD SHOULD STAY IN POWER.
THAT'S THE QUESTION.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.
