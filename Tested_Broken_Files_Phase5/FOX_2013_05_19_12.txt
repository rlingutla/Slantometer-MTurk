INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND I MEAN LARGE.
HEAVY RAIN AND THE RISK FOR TORNADOES.
AND IN JUST THE LAST HOUR OR SO WE HAVE SEEN MOST OF THOSE GET INTO THE WARNING CATEGORY WHICH MEANS IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE FOR TWISTERS TO DROP OUT OF THE SKY.
THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY ALARMING WITH THESE.
AS THOSE SYSTEMS COLLIDE.
I CAN HEAR IT.
YOU MENTIONED THE HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS.
HE TOLD THAT GUY DRIVING THIS CAR.
ON DOWN TO WHATEVER THE HECK THEY ARE HITTING ON THE GROUND.
CONTINUES TO BE ON THE GROUND AND THIS TORNADO MEANS BUSINESS AND IT IS COMING RIGHT TO YOUR HOMETOWN IF YOU LIVE IN ADELOT.
IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.
WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE A JUMP BACK STORMBACK IN THE AREA.
AND OUR PRAYERS FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT THEY STAY SAFE TONIGHT.
I WANT TO ASK WHY IS IT JUST IN THE LAST LITTLE WHILE THIS HAS GOTTEN WORSE.
TODAY YOU WERE DOING SUCH ONSIDE OF A TORNADO SHELTER.
NOT ONLY CONFINED TO OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS BUT STEP UP TOWARDS THE UPPER MIDWEST THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS.
SOUTH AND EAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY.
TELL US WHERE?
FORTUNATELY, THOUGH, THE DAMAGE THAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT IS TO THINGS AND NOT PEOPLE AND THAT IS THE BLESSING IN ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT DID HAPPEN EARLY IN THE DAY.
WE ARE LISTENING IN NOW TO OUR FOX 25 IN OKLAHOMA CITY AND YOU ARE LISTENING TO THEM TALK WITH SOME OF THE STORM SPOTTERS THAT THEY HAVE OUT THERE GATHERING VIDEO.
