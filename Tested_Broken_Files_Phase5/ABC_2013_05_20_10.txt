OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THERE WAS JUST CARS BEAT UP.
AND HERE, SCHOOL BUSES STILL LINED UP OUTSIDE THIS SCHOOL.
WE HAD THE NEWS ON AND WE HAD THE RADIO ON, AND MY PHONE STARTED GOING OFF, LETTING US KNOW THERE WAS AN ALERT.
DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS.
I LOOKED TO THE WEST AND I SEE IT.
THAT WAS HER QUOTE.
AND 15 ARE LISTED IN FAIR OR GOOD CONDITION AT THE MOMENT.
JUST REMINDS US HOW IMPORTANT THE WARNING SYSTEM IS AGAIN.
LISTEN.
FOLKS HAVE BEEN DIGGING THROUGH THE DEBRIS AND LIFTING UP THESE HEAVY PIECES OF DEBRIS, WHETHER IT'S WALL BOARD OR SIDING OR ROOFING, TWISTED METAL, TRYING TO FIND ANYONE WHO MIGHT STILL BE IN THE RUBBLE.
ABSOLUTELY.
IT WAS A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF STORIES.
AND IT'S HOMES, BUSINESSES, HOSPITALS, ALL JUST TAKEN OUT BY THIS ONE STORM.
THIS IS A GROWING NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S JUST SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY.
WE'LL HAVE PICTURES FROM STORM CHASER VIDEOS.
OUR EXTREME WEATHER TEAM IS IN OKLAHOMA.
ONE OF THE BOYS GOT A BIG GASH IN HIS HEAD BUT HE'S OKAY.
AND I DON'T LIKE TO COMPARE STORMS TOO MUCH.
