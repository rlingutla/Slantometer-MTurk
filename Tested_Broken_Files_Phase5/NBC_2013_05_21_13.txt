THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WARREN PETERS ALREADY CLEANED UP THEIR PARKING LOT.
I WAS DOWN IN TUSCALOOSA, AS WERE YOU, AND AFTER THE 27, APRIL 2011 OUTBREAK, WE SAW THEM BUILD BACK HOMES FOR $75,000 WITH SAFE ROOMS.
THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US TONIGHT.
COULD YOU HEAR IT?
THERE WERE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WERE ACTUALLY IN THE DIRECT PATH OF THIS TORNADO.
OKLAHOMA NATIONAL GUARD, MORE THAN 200 SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN CALLED TO DUTY.
THIS COULD BE FROM 12 MILES AWAY.
COMMON IN OKLAHOMA BECAUSE THE SOIL, HEAVY WITH CLAY AND WATER, MAKES ANYTHING UNDERGROUND PRONE TO FLOODING AND MOLD.
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HER NAME.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WE THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO FLY OFF, AND THE MASSIVE DEBRIS HIT.
AROUND THE CLOCK FRANTIC SEARCH AFTER THE MASSIVE TWISTER.
JIM, YOU AND I WERE TALKING BEFORE ABOUT A STATISTIC THAT'S STARTING TO SURFACE TODAY THAT THE SHEER ENERGY, THE OUTPUT OF THIS STORM EQUALED THE BOMB IGNITED IN HIROSHIMA.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU WERE IN THERE?
REMEMBER, WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH AREAS LIKE THIS, THEY'RE WALKING THROUGH HOME.
WE HAVE TO HAVE BUILDINGS THAT CAN SUSTAIN THE TYPE OF DAMAGE THAT THEY'RE USED TO HERE, OBVIOUSLY.
BUT NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE ON BOTH COASTS ARE ASKING WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SHELTERS, CELLARS, BASEMENTS?
YES, SIR.
IF YOU WERE WATCHING OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE YESTERDAY IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THIS TORNADO, THEN YOU KNOW IT TOOK ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO FOR A KIND OF SICK FEELING TO ARRIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
MILES OF DEVASTATION AFTER A OUS TORNADO DECIMATED EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.
