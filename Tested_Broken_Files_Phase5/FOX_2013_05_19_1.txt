INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.
WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES OR SO SOUTH OF NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.
OUR METEOROLOGISTS IN THIS COMMUNITY DID A GREAT JOB OF WARNING EVERYBODY FOR SEVERAL DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS EVENT.
THESE ROGUE SUPERCELLS AND WHEN YOU ARE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT THAT IS WHEN WE PARTICULARLY SEE THINGS START TO
ABOUT HOW THEY WILL SIT AND LOOK HUGE AND GO RIGHT BACK UP IN THE SKY AND IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM COMING SOMETIMES BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN RAIN-SOAKED.
THEN THE STORM SORT OF TRACKED TO THE EAST OF OKLAHOMA.
SO WE HAVE THESE TWO GUIDANCE TICK CELLS.
THE WINDS WHIPPING AS FUNNEL CLOUD IS TRYING TO HOLD ITSELF TOGETHER AND DOING SO RATHER IMPRESSIVELY.
TO THE RIGHT IS THE SYSTEM ON THE MAP.
ARE IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE CHASERS ON THE GROUND LIKE THE VIDEO YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT THERE.
PROBABLE FOR THEM TO DO SOME DAMAGE WHEN THEY DO AND IN FACT SOME OF THE AREAS ARE NOW IN TORNADO WARNING BEYOND JUST THE THUNDERSTORM WARNING MEANING THERE HAVE BEEN TOUCHDOWNS ON THE GROUND.
UNTIL YOU SEE IT, IT REALLY DOESN'T SEEM REAL TO YOU AND HAVING LIVED IN KANSAS CITY FOR MANY YEARS AND I HAVE SEEN THE TORNADOIC SYSTEMS MOVE ACROSS THE PLAINS, YOU CAN PICK THEM UP AND WATCH THEM MOVE INTO YOUR TOWN.
THEY KNOW TORNADOES.
 A FANTASTIC WAY TO GET AN EYE INTO THE STORM AND GENERALLY WE LEAN ON THEM A LITTLE BIT BUT HOPING EVERYBODY STAYS SAFE.
WE ARE GETTING THE DEBRIS SIGNATURE ON RADAR.
ING TOLING BETWEEN OKLAHOMA CITY VIDEO AND NOW LOOKING TEN MILES OUTSIDE WICHITA KANSAS.
TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING?
DO A TON OF DAMAGE AND THEN ASCEND BACK UP INTO THE CLOUDS AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE PORTIONS OF OKLAHOMA THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE GUN THE LAST FOUR HOURS OR SO HARRIS.
THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN TO A LOT OF THE FORECASTERS AND METEOROLOGISTS BECAUSE AS JANICE DEAN WAS SAYING EARLIER THIS HAS REALLY SORT OF BEEN TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WEATHER THAT SETS UP FOR THE SUPERCELLS AND CELLS THAT PRODUCE THE TORNADOES.
EARLIER TODAY IT WAS COOKING AND THEN IN JUST THE LAST 15-20 MINUTES WE ARE SEEING TOUCHDOWNS.
