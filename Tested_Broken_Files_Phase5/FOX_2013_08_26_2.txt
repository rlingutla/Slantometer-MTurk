INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
NOW, THERE IS NO INDICATION AT THIS MOMENT WHEN THOSE UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS MIGHT LEAVE SYRIA FOR ANYONE READING THE TEA LEAVES THAT ACT MIGHT BE ANOTHER IMPENDING MILITARY ACTION.
IT COULD VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE OPTIONS THE PRESIDENT USES JON.
FOUR U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SYRIA TO LAUNCH A MISSILE STRIKE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.
GROUND TROOPS, BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS.
THEY FLATLY DECLARED THAT AND JOHN KERRY WENT ON TO TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO HAVE ACCOUNTABI HINTING AT U.S. MILITARY ACTION.
AS WE REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS NEWSCAST, OFFICIALS SAY THE U.S. NOW HAS FOUR WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST OF SYRIA READY TO STRIKE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.
NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY, THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT CHIEFS HAS PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT WITH ONE PLAN THAT WOULD INCLUDE GROUND TROOPS, COULD INCLUDE HALF A MILLION U.S.
NOW, WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN JAY CARNEY TODAY REFUSED TO GET INTO ANY HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THE INDISCRIMINATE SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS, THE KILLING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND INNOCENT BYSTANDERS BIOCHEMICAL WEAPONS IS IMMORAL OBSCENITY.
SO, ED, WHAT IS NEXT FOR THE PRESIDENT ON THIS ISSUE?
IF THE UNITED STATES STANDS BY AND DOESN'T TAKE VERY SERIOUS ACTION.
NO INJURIES REPORTED.
JOHN KERRY SPOKE ABOUT SYRIA.
PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES THERE MUST BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO WOULD USE THE WORLD'S MOST HEINOUS WEAPONS NOW SYRIA IS THREATENING TO STRIKE BACK AS UNITED NATIONS INSPECTORS DODGE SNIPER FIRE AT THE SCENE OF A POSSIBLE CHEMICAL ATTACK.
THE STILL PHOTOGRAPHS OF THAT INTERVIEW WERE RELEASED BY STATE RUN SYRIAN MEDIA WE CANNOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THEM.
INSTEAD FOR FIVE DAYS THEY REFUSED INVESTIGATORS TO THE SITE OF THE ATTACK THAT WOULD ALLEGEDLY EXONERATE THEM.
IT DEFIES ANY CODE OF MORALITY.
IT IS UNDENIABLE, THAT'S WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY SAID TODAY ABOUT LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA.
WHAT WE SAW IN SYRIA LAST WEEK SHOULD SHOCK THE CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD IT.
THAT'S RIGHT, JON IT WAS ONE YEAR AGO THIS MONTH AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THE PRESIDENT FIRST DREW THAT RED LINE FAMOUSLY IN TERMS OF THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY PRESIDENT ASSAD IN SYRIA.
