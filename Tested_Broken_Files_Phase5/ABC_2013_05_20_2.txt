INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
MOST LIKELY FROM PUNCTURES FROM FLYING DEBRIS.
WE KNEW THE STORMS WERE COMING.
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN SWEPT ALREADY BY A BIG TRACTOR.
AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOMENT OF THE CRISIS.
THE SMELL OF GAS IS PERMEATING STILL.
WE'RE RECEIVING PATIENTS LITERALLY, MINUTE BY MINUTE.
MISS SIMON HAD THE KIDS IN ONE HALLWAY, AND SHE SAID THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE A TRAIN COMING.
I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY, WE WERE GETTING SLAMMED WITH HAIL AND RAIN AGAIN.
SHE SAID HE WAS HELPING PEOPLE, PULLING STUFF OFF OF KIDS.
THEY ARE STUNNING PICTURES AND STUNNING STORIES FROM THE FAMILIES ON THE GROUND THERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
WITHIN AN HOUR, IT WAS A MONSTER STORM DEVELOPING JUST ABOUT AS QUICKLY AS ALL THE DETAILS HAVE TOLD US THE JOPLIN STORM DEVELOPED.
THAT WAS HER CAR.
MAYBE NOT TO THE EMOTIONAL EXTENT OF THIS TRAGEDY, BUT WITH ONLY TEN CRITICAL AT THE MOMENT, WE'RE CAPABLE OF HANDLING ANYMORE.
THAT TORNADO PASSED RIGHT OVER THAT SCHOOL.
AND OUR TEACHER GRABBED ME, AND THE REST OF THE STUDENTS, AND SAID, WE'RE GOING TO THE SAFE ROOM, AND WE ALL GOT THERE, AND WE WERE QUIET.
RIGHT AWAY, AT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY, ONE OF THE SCHOOLS HARDEST HIT.
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS COVERED IN DEBRIS.
AND ALL I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS MY SON.
WE STILL SEE SOME PLUMES OF SMOKE.
DARKNESS OVERWHELMING MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
