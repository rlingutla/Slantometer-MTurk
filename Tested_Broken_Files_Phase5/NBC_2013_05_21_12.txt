THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THIS WEATHER IS A SURPRISE TO NO ONE, AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE READY FOR IT WHEN IT COMES.
MEANTIME, TODAY THE FIRST VICTIM IDENTITIES WERE RELEASED, THAT OF A LITTLE 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL KILLED IN HER SCHOOL.
SHE TOLD US ALL TO JUST GET YOUR MATH BOOK OR YOUR BAG.
WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE PROCESS.
PROBABLY AT THE VERY BEGINNING WHERE IT STARTED RIGHT BACK OVER HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS.
IT'S LIKE A WAR ZONE.
HE GREW UP IN THIS STATE AND WAS PART OF THE SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM 14 YEARS AGO DURING ANOTHER HUGE TWISTER.
LIVE THE FEMA ESTIMATE, $1.4 MILLION PER SCHOOL.
WE JUST DON'T DESIGN HOMES ON THE INTERIOR OF THIS COUNTRY TO WITHSTAND THE WINDS THE SAME WAY THEY WOULD DO ALONG THE COAST.
SHREVEPORT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO FACE SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT, AUSTIN, TEXAS, MEMPHIS TENNESSEE, AS WELL.
SO WHY WEREN'T SCHOOLS BETTER PREPARED?
SHE WAS BLEEDING BECAUSE SHE GOT FOUR BODIES WERE RECOVERED TODAY INCLUDING A 3-MONTH-OLD BABY.
QUIT SAYING THAT.
THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE SCREAMING.
FROM SHELTER INTO AN ALIEN WORLD OF UTTER DESTRUCTION.
THE TORNADO, DRAMATIC IMAGES, YOUNG CHILDREN WERE RESCUED, AND WITH DARKNESS, THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS CONTINUED.
THAT MEANS -- THAT CATEGORY MEAN THESE WINDS HIT BETWEEN 200, 210 MILES AN HOUR.
THIS WOMAN IS SAID TO HAVE SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME.
I'LL STAY OUT HERE.
AND SADLY, THAT NUMBER INCLUDES AT LEAST 9 CHILDREN.
