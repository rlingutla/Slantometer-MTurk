INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND EACH TIME THEY HAVE BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO THE NATION.
RESCUE WORKERS WENT THROUGH A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY AND DID NOT FIND ANY MORE VICTIMS.
WARNINGS OF LARGE SIZE HAIL.
HOPE THAT MORE SURVIVORS WOULD BE FOUND AND HOPE THAT THE DEATH TOLL WOULDN'T RISE AND THAT IS EXACTLY EMBODIED RIGHT BACK THERE.
TODAY, AMERICANS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE BRENDA AND HER NEIGHBORS.
I UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WOULD BE.
RIGHT.
YOU REMEMBER SHE WAS PIVOTAL IN THE BOSTON BOMBING INVESTIGATION AS WELL IN TERMS OF KEEPING THE PRESIDENT IN THE LOOP ABOUT THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT.
AND ON THIS DAY IN 1881, HUMANITARIAN CLARA BARTON AND SOME FRIENDS FOUNDED THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN WASHINGTON D.C. CLARA BARTON HAD GAINED FAME YEARS EARLIER AS A NURSE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CIVIL WAR.
STAY RIGHT THERE SCOTT, SO YOU YOU CAN SEE IT BACK BEHIND YOU.
CASH I THINK YOU NEED IT A NAP, DON'T YOU CASH AND CORY AND CHRIS YOU NEED SOME SHOES TOO BABE.
BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGES SHOW DESTRUCTION AT THAT SCHOOL WHERE SEVEN CHILDREN DIED.
AND BACK HERE IN MOORE A COMMUNITY DEALING WITH TREMENDOUS SHOCK AND GRIEF.
AND WE WILL SEE IT HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
NEIGHBORHOODS WERE DESTROYED.
SOME INSPIRATION OUT THERE AMID ALL THE LOSS.
IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR ZONE.
EARLIER TODAY OUR CASEY STEGALL WENT OUT INTO ONE OF THOSE SMALL SPACES AND GOT A SENSE OF WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO CLIMB BACK OUT ONLY TO FIND HEIR HOMES WERE I DON'T KNOW IF GONE.
YOUR KIDS SEEM SO TIRED.
