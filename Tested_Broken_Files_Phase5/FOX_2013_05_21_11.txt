THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE SHOULD POINT OUT SHEP, NEITHER BRIAR WOOD NOR PLAZA TOWERS HAD ANY KIND OF SAFE ROOM OR HARDENED TORNADO SHELTER.
LISTEN.
YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT MOMENT WHEN YOU FIRST SAW YOUR DAUGHTER; THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
TODAY, WE CAME ACROSS TRACY STEPHAN IN HER BACKYARD, WHAT USED TO BE HER BACKYARD SIFTING THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF HER HOME.
DOZENS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.
WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM SOME OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TAKING PART IN THE MASSIVE SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATION.
CAN YOU CALL THE RED CROSS AT 1-800-RED-CROSS.
THE HOME THEY HAD BEEN RENT SOMETHING NOW LEVELED.
DURING AN EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW WITH A CBS STATION HERE, ONE WOMAN DESCRIBED HOW THE CHAOS OF THE STORM TORE HER DOG FROM HER BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.
INSTEAD, THEY ARE HAVING TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT AND FRANKLY START FROM SCRATCH.
THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO REPAIR.
TRACY'S DAUGHTER EXCITED THAT THERE WAS NO MORE SCHOOL AND TRACY'S DAUGHTER SAVED BY THE ACTION SHEP, OF THAT HEROIC TEACHER'S AIDE WHO JUST COVERED HER UP AND SAVED HER FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH.
IT JUST LOOKED LIKE BOMBS HAD BEEN IGNITED EVERYWHERE.
THEY ALL ESCAPED UNSCATHED.
YEAH.
SHE SAYS SHE REMEMBERS VIVIDLY THOSE HEART BROKEN SURVIVORS NOW SHE IS ONE OF THEM.
OU HEAD FOOTBALL COACH BOB STUCKS BROUGHT STACKS OF $50 GIFT CARDS AND DECIDED TO COME HERE AND VISIT WITH THE FAMILIES AT THIS SHELTER.
TOOK THEM A FEW OF THEM AND WENT INTO THE CLOSET.
OUR GRATITUDE IS WITH THE TEACHERS WHO GAVE THEIR ALL TO SHIELD THEIR CHILDREN WITH THE NEIGHBORS FIRST RESPONDERS AND EMERGENCY PERCH NELL TO HO RACED TO HELP AS SOON AS THE TORNADO PASSED.
