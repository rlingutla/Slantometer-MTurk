INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THEN IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD FROM POWER AND THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON DEFEATING ISIS.
RESOLUTIONS, VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND LONG-HELD AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PARTIES INCLUDING SYRIAN REGIME, THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND ALL OTHER MEMBERS OF THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL.
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN PENTAGON GAME PLANS.
NOW WE LEARNED THAT SYRIA'S FOREIGN MINISTER HAS DENIED THAT HIS GOVERNMENT USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS WEAPONS IN  ATTACKS.
WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT NATO'S FRONT NOT TO BE SO CLOSE TO THE RUSSIANS.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING AT WHICH CAME TO NOTHING.
RIGHT.
COULD REALLY UPSET THE EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD.
THERE'S RUSSIA ANGLE AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSED.
SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON ANNOUNCING THAT "STEPS ARE UNDERWAY TO ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, FROM POWER FOLLOWING THIS WEEK'S APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK IN THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY."
IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES, ANOTHER SIGN.
HE WAS ASKING WHETHER BASHAR AL-ASSAD SHOULD GO.
AND WHEN ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO TAKE TO PRESIDENT PUTIN, HE SAID I MAY.
STODDARD.
NOBODY IN CONGRESS KNOW WHAT'S THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SO AT THIS POINT, WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTING OF THE RUSSIANS?
FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TO BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS CHANGED.
JUST A WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE ASKED ABOUT THIS IN TURKEY.
BUT THESE PICTURES AND THIS INCIDENT IS NEW ALONG WITH THIS PRESIDENT AND HIS ENTOURAGE.
THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE GROUND SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD.
