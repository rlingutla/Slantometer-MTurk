INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
ANOTHER OPTION -- U.S.
TO TAKING MILITARY ACTION IN SYRIA THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH STRONG WORDS FROM U.S. OFFICIALS TODAY AND WARSHIPS AT THE READY.
AND TONIGHT, MORE OF THOSE NEW IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH.
INSPECTORS TO VISIT THE SITE, BUT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND THE EVIDENCE THEY WOULD PRESENT IS LIKELY CORRUPTED.
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL NOT INTERVENE UNTIL THE ATTACK IS VERIFIED, BUT ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS ARE TONIGHT SAYING THERE IS A STRONG SUSPICION THAT THE ASSAD REGIME LAUNCHED THE ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE REBELS DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE KIND OF ROCKETS IN WHICH THE CHEMICALS WERE BELIEVED TO BE DELIVERED.
NAVY DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES NOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA COULD LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILES INTO SYRIA WHENEVER ORDERED, TARGETING SYRIAN REGIME COMMAND AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS, AIRFIELDS OR AIRCRAFT THAT MIGHT BE USED TO CARRY CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
BELIEVED TO BE THE SINGLE DEADLIEST ATTACK SO FAR THERE IN SYRIA.
"WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT MONTHS."
