INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
I LOVE SIERRA AND I MISS SYRIA.
ALL I WISH IS THAT SYRIA COULD BECOME PEACEFUL AGAIN, THAT'S ALL I WANT FOR THE TROUBLE TO STOP.
PLUS, A GRIM MILESTONE ON THE NUMBER OF CHILD REFUGEES NOW TRYING TO ESCAPE THAT BLOODY CIVIL WAR.
HARD TO SAY HOW 1,000 OR COUPLE HUNDRED DEAD FROM A CHEMICAL WEAPON WHILE DEPLORABLE WOULD IMPACT HIS CALCULUS.
AMERICA NEEDS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE REPORTS OF A MASSIVE AND DEADLY CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA.
ONE WEEK AGO THIS WEEK THAT HE DREW THAT RED LINE ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SARA I CAN'TENNED A PROMISED THERE WOULD BE ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES IF SYRIA CROSSED THAT RED LINE.
JONATHAN THE SYRIAN FORCES STILL CLAIM THEY DID NOT CARRY OUT THIS ATTACK.
JUMPING IN TO STUFF THAT DOES NOT TURN OUT WELL.
PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING CLEAR IS HE IN NO RUSH TO GET THE U.S. MILITARY INVOLVED IN SYRIA'S 2-YEAR-OLD CIVIL WAR EVEN AMID MOUNTING CLAIMS THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGAIN USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE THE SITUATION IN SYRIA IS VERY DIFFICULT.
OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS A HIGH LEVEL MEETING YESTERDAY TO DISCUSS AMERICA'S OPTIONS.
ED HENRY IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
BUT THERE ARE FEW SIGNS TONIGHT, JON, THAT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT TO PROVIDE THOSE WEAPONS INSPECTORS WITH SAFE PASSAGE FOR THE ADMITTEDLY DANGEROUS 15 MINUTE JOURNEY.
WEAPONS INSPECTORS WHO HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED IN DAMASCUS NOW BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO THE SITE OF THE ALLEGED ATTACK.
NOW, WHAT'S NEXT?
BRITAIN, TURKEY, AND FRANCE LEADING THE WAY AND POINTING FINGERS PRETTY DIRECTLY AT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND DEMANDING THAT THOSE U.N.
CAN RESULT IN US BEING DRAWN IN TO VERY EXPENSIVE, DIFFICULT, COSTLY INTERVENTIONS THAT ACTUALLY BREED MORE RESENTMENT IN THE REGION.
NOW, TO PUT THAT 1 MILLION FIGURE IN PERSPECTIVE, U.N. OFFICIALS POINT OUT THAT IT IS AS IF EVERY SINGLE CHILD HAD BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THE CITIES OF L.A. AND BOSTON COMBINED JON.
CLEARLY MANY, MANY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY RULED OUT U.S. GROUND TROOPS IN SARA I CAN'T.
OF COURSE, ALL THIS IS UNFOLDING AS THE PRESIDENT WRAPS UP A TWO-DAY BUS TOUR THROUGH NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA TO TALK ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY.
