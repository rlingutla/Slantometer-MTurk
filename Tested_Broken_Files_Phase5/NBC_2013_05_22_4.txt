INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
TODAY WE LEARN HOW AND WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO HIDE, RIDE IT OUT, AND SURVIVE THIS ONE.
ONCE WE HAVE THE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE BODIES, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, THEY ARE OFFERED DIFFERENT COUNSELING.
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.
TWO YEARS LATER, THE VOID REMAINS, BUT BETHANY IS GRATEFUL FOR A SECOND CHANCE.
THE HEAVILY REINFORCED VAULT IS ALL THAT'S STANDING.
I HOPE EVERYONE'S OKAY.
TODAY, TOWN OFFICIALS PROPOSED THE IDEA OF MAKING THEM MANDATORY FOR NEW HOMES.
CELEBRATE AS THIS TOWN REBUILDS, BUT IT IS THE STRENGTH OF ITS PEOPLE THAT IS THE TRUE MEASURE OF SUCCESS.
CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE COUNTED UP 13,000 HOMES IN THE PATH OF THIS ONE STORM, SOME PEOPLE ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING BOTH THANKS AND SURPRISE THAT THE TOLL WASN'T EVEN HIGHER.
HOLD ON TO YOUR CAP AND GOWN.
ITS ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS SECURELY BURIED UNDER GROUND.
THE TINKER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION BEFORE THE TORNADO AND AFTER.
BRIAN, KIDS WHO ATTEND SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO GO TO OTHER SCHOOLS SO THEY CAN AT LEAST CLOSE OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH THEIR CLASSMATES.
THE BRICKS ARE A CHERISHED SYMBOL OF ALL THAT WAS LOST TWO YEARS AGO TODAY WHEN AN EF5 TWISTER TORE UP JOPLIN INCLUDING THE HIGH SCHOOL.
THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE A FEW OF THESE OUT TO VARIOUS FOLKS WITH TIES TO THAT COMMUNITY.
EMILY'S MOTHER POSTED ON FACEBOOK, I KNOW SHE IS IN HEAVEN SMILING DOWN.
AT THE SAME TIME, FOLKS CONTINUE TO MARVEL THAT SO MANY PEOPLE WALKED OUT OF WRECKAGE LIKE THIS ALIVE.
NOW SOME OF JOPLIN'S FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE GONE TO MOORE, OKLAHOMA, TO HELP OUT.
THE FIGURE YOU MENTIONED, 13,000 HOMES IN THE PATH, THAT'S DESTROYED OR BADLY DAMAGED.
FIRSTHAND LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION INSIDE THE SCHOOL, AND THE TOLL IT TOOK ON FIRST RESPONDERS.
