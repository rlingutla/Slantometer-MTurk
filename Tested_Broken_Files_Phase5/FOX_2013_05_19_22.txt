INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE ARE COVERING COVERING THIS BREAKING NEWS HAPPENING IN THE MID SECTION OF THE COUNTRY.
IT DOES HELP.
AGAIN, JUST EAST AND NORTHEAST OF DALE.
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT TORNADO IS AT.
YES MA'AM.
YOU CAN SEAT HOOK THERE CLEARLY AND THEN THE OTHER IS REALLY MOVING OUT OF THE AREA IN NORTHWESTERN CREEK COUNTY.
I-40 AND THEN AFTER THAT MOVE TO THE EAST AND PULL UP CITIES THERE FOR YOU.
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HOW LONG THIS SITS ON THE GROUND AND THEN JUST -- THIS IS WHAT CASEY WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE.
IN FACT SOME OF THE EARLY REPORTS FROM THE WEATHER SPOTTERS ON THE GROUND IS THAT IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA ALONE 14 DIFFERENT TORNADOES HAVE BEEN GENERATED IN THE LAST FOUR HOURS OR SO.
THE DOUGHNUT HOLE THAT YOU SAW RIGHT THERE.
TORNADOES TOUCHING DOWN IN KANSAS AND OKLAHOMA AND THE SYSTEM NOW COOKING UP.
YOU CAN SEE IT COMING AND IN THE SKY.
YES, I AM.
WE FORECAST THAT WICHITA AND KANSAS CITY MIGHT BE TOUCHED BY THIS AND IN FACT THAT HAS HAPPENED TODAY WITH YOUR CITY.
AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW EVERYONE IS TRYING TO RECOVER.
CURRENTLY I'M OUTSIDE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE DAMAGES.
WE HAD TWO OR THREE SIGHTINGS OF TORNADOES BUT SO FAR WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT WE SEE ANYTHING OF ANY REAL TORNADO DAMAGE.
WE ARE SENDING CORRESPONDENTS INTO THE HEART OF THIS.
AND ALSO HAVING TO TAKE THE SPOTTERS AND CHASERS OUT THERE HAVING TO TAKE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ALSO TO HEART BECAUSE THE RADAR MAY BE SAYING ONE THING AND WHAT IS ON THE GROUND MAY BE SAYING ANOTHER THING.
THE DYERNAL HEATING.
