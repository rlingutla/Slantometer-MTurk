PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND THE NUMBER OF                POSSIBLE CASUALTIES IS           STILL UNKNOWN.
PEOPLE DIED FROM THE             STORM.
AFTER KNOCKING OUT ALL           POWER IN PUERTO RICO.
VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE             ISLAND IS WITHOUT                POWER.
36 HOURS AFTER                   HURRICANE MARIA                  STORMED ASHORE IN                PUERTO RICO RIPPING              APART HOMES AND                  FLOODING STREETS, IT'S           POSSIBLE WE HAVE NOT             YET SEEN THE WORST OF            IT.
DARK DAYS IN PUERTO              RICO EXPECTED TO LAST            MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE           MARIA RIPPED APART THE           ISLAND'S ENTIRE POWER            GRID.
THE DANGER FROM              HURRICANE MARIA IS NOT           OVER YET.
AND THIS IS PART OF              THE REASON WHY.
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE            JUST NOW STARTING TO             GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT            THE DEVASTATION.
SO I'M TRYING TO GO TO           STREETS ARE LITTERED             WITH DOWNED POWER                LINES.
TONIGHT, POWERLESS           AND PARALYZED.
NEW VIDEO OUT OF ST.             CROIX TODAY SHOWS THE            EXTENT OF THE                    DESTRUCTION THERE.
MANY ROADS ARE                   IMPASSABLE.
NEARLY ALL OF ITS 3.5            MILLION RESIDENTS                WITHOUT ELECTRICITY              TONIGHT.
BIG MAHOGANY TREES            THAT WERE ROOTED UP.
AFTER THE STORM.
NOW FAMILIES ACROSS              THE I ISLAND TRYING TO           PREPARE FOR THE HUMAN            DARKNESS OF LIFE OFF             THE GRID.
HERE MANY ROADS ARE              IMPASSABLE AND                   COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS           ARE DOWN WHICH MEANS             IT COULD TAKE QUITE A            WHILE TO GET A HANDLE            ON THE FULL SCOPE OF             MARIA'S DESTRUCTION.
IT'S SHOCKING.
TERRITORY            IS WITHOUT POWER.
