INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
SOME OF IT IS VERY GRAPHIC.
BUT WASHINGTON WORRIES, WHO WOULD GET THE WEAPONS?
FOR WAR-WEARY AMERICANS, THAT'S NOT EVEN UNDER CONSIDERATION.
FROM THE SYRIAN REGIME DENIALS, AS THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WHICH FOR A YEAR HAS CALLED THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA A RED LINE, IS BEING CAUTIOUS AS IT NOW CALLS FOR AN INVESTIGATION.
IN SYRIA OUTRAGES HAVE LONG GONE UNPUNISHED.
ARMING THE REBELS.
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHAT THE REBELS SAY IS THE EVIDENCE.
TODAY A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAID THE U.S. MUST BE, QUOTE, HUMBLE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT DO.
AND WITH ASSAD BACKED BY RUSSIA, IRAN, AND HEZBOLLAH, THERE IS LITTLE THE WORLD CAN DO.
MORE VIDEOS EMERGE FROM SYRIA TODAY.
U.S. BOOTS ON THE GROUND.
THE REBELS ARE DIVIDED WITH SOME LINKED TO AL QAEDA.
WE TURN OVERSEAS NOW TO SYRIA AND SOME HORRIFYING IMAGES THAT WILL INSTINCTIVELY MAKE YOU WANT TO LOOK AWAY.
ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT -- OUT OF CONTROL AND RUNNING OUT OF CASH TO FIGHT THE WORST FIRE  EYES OF THE WORLD ON THE ATROCI IN SYRIA.
VIDEO EVIDENCE OF WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED NOW INSIDE SYRIA.
A MASS CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.
YET THEY CANNOT BE IGNORED.
A VICIOUS CIVIL WAR NOW IN ITS THIRD YEAR, MORE THAN 100,000 DEAD, NEARLY 2 MILLION REFUGEES.
HAS SHOCKED THE WORLD.
IT HAS INSPECTORS IN DAMASCUS RIGHT NOW, JUST A FEW MILES FROM WHERE SO MANY DIED YESTERDAY, BUT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WON'T LET THEM SEE WHAT COULD BE THE WORST ATROCITY IN SYRIA'S ATROCIOUS WAR.
