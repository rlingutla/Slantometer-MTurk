INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY, HAD A BIG IMPACT ON ME.
WHAT THE WORLD WAS WAITING FOR NEXT, WAS WORD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.
FOR AMERICANS AT HOME TONIGHT WONDERING WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN, WHAT'S NEXT?
THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNING THE ATTACK, CALLING IT QUOTE, AN AFFRONT TO HUMANITY.
THE GRAPHIC IMAGES SEEN AROUND THE WORLD.
WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THAT SYRIA CROSSED NOT ONLY A RED LINE, BUT SEVERAL LINES.
THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.
WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.
WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE?
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK YOU'VE NOTICED ABOUT ME IS MILITARILY, I DON'T LIKE TO SAY WHERE I'M GOING AND WHAT I'M DOING.
PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES MANY, MANY LINES, BEYOND A RED LINE.
PREDECESSOR, IS PROMISING TO TAKE ACTION.
BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO BE TELLING YOU.
HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE TO DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?
THEY DIDN'T USE THEM.
IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR ME.
DO THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER ATTACKS?
BUT DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF TIME LINE FOR POSSIBLE ACTION HERE?
THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR HE WON'T SAY WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.
WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN FRONT OF THE WORLD ON SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL ASSAD, ON THE APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK THAT KILLED SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN.
