PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THIS ONE TOOK HIS HOME.
IT WAS PRETTY LOUD.
ROOM FOR A SHELTER IS A DIFFERENT MATTER.
WE'VE STARTED THE PROCESS ALREADY.
SHE'S AT A HOSPITAL IN NORMAN.
THAT'S KIND OF GROUND ZERO.
CLASSROOMS COMPLETELY OBLITERATED, AN AUDITORIUM CAVED IN.
TONIGHT AS WE STAND HERE TALKING --  A WEEK AND A HALF AGO THE ATMOSPHERE DECIDED WE'RE GOING TO PULL A SWITCH, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TORNADO DROUGHT IS OVER AND YOU'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT.
SHE'S ALIVE.
BACK HERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, LET'S SPEND A MOMENT TALKING ABOUT THE TRUE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE RESCUE TEAMS, THE NATIONAL GUARD.
WE LEARNED TODAY OFFICIALLY WHAT TORE THROUGH HERE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WAS, IN FACT, AN EF-5 TORNADO.
THERE'S ACTUAL FEMA HERE IN OKLAHOMA.
MINUTES THE LANDSCAPE OF THIS SUBURBAN TOWN WAS CHANGED FOREVER.
AND THEY POINT OUT WE COULD SEE AS MANY AS 20,000 PEOPLE DISPLACED BY ALL THIS.
I MEAN, IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR KIDS IN A HALL AND TEACH THEM HOW TO CROUCH AND HOLD THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEAD, WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE BLOWN APART.
AND I DID THE TEACHER THING THAT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO DO, I PRAYED, AND I PRAYED OUT LOUD.
LUCKILY THOSE DIRE NUMBERS DID NOT MATERIALIZE, BUT SADLY THERE HAS WELL BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH BAD NEWS TO GO AROUND AT THAT SCHOOL.
THE INSURANCE CLAIMS LIKELY TOPPING $1 BILLION, BUT LUCKILY THERE WILL BE TIME TO DISCUSS ALL OF THAT.
I ALREADY HAD MY BAG.
THESE SISTERS TOOK THEIR OWN CHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL JUST MINUTES BEFORE THE TORNADO HIT.
