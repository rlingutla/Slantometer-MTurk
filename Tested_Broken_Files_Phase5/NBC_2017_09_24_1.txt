INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
TONIGHT, THERE IS AN URGENT RUSH TO CLEAR THESE ROADS AND OPEN UP LINES OF COMMUNICATION.
NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SAYS   THE STORM WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN, BUT WILL COME CLOSE TO THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA.
EVEN YEARS.
THIS MAN IS A POLICE OFFICER.
FOUR DAYS AFTER HURRICANE    MARIA SWEPT ACROSS PUERTO RICO,  RESCUE TEAMS ONLY NOW ARE        REACHING SOME OF THE MORE REMOTE PARTS OF THAT ISLAND.
BUT THE MORE PEOPLE WE SPEAK     WITH, IT'S CLEAR THIS RECOVERY   WON'T BE MEASURED IN WEEKS, BUT  MONTHS.
THE ISLAND'S LONG RECOVERY ONE   MISSION AT A TIME.
TODAY WE RODE ALONG WITH A FEMA  SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM FROM      SOUTH FLORIDA AS IT MADE IT'S    WAY TO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE   ISLAND.
OFFICIALS, THEY'RE FINDING A     SIMILAR STORY, OVER AND OVER     AGAIN.
THIS WOMAN TELLS US EVERYTHING   ON THE OTHER SIDE IS DEVASTATED.
THE HURRICANE DESTROYED HIS HOME TOO.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO WORK WITH    THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDS US, AND I  ALSO HAVE TO WORK WITH MY OWN    NEEDS, YOU KNOW.
NO CELL SERVICE AND NO           COMMUNICATION IS HAMPERING       RESCUE EFFORTS.
SO WE JUST SPENT THE LAST     HOUR TRYING TO DRIVE AROUND AND  FIND OUT WHERE TO GO AND WHAT    NEEDS TO HAPPEN.
A COMMUNITY IN PUERTO RICO CUT   OFF WHEN HURRICANE MARIA WASHED  THIS BRIDGE AWAY.
RURAL PARTS OF THE ISLAND        RAVAGED, INCLUDING THE MOUNTAIN  TOWN.
DAM AFTER FINDING A CRACK IN IT.
THE NEED HERE IS MASSIVE.
IF IT BURSTS, AUTHORITIES WARN   OF LIFE-THREATENING FLOODING.
AND A CLOSE EYE ON MARIA     TONIGHT AS IT MOVES CLOSER TO    THE UNITED STATES.
