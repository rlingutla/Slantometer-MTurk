INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE PEOPLE TOOK THE PICTURES.
IT REALLY IS.
IS NOW LOOKING AT FRAME BY FRAME.
THE DOCTORS SAID THIS AFTERNOON THIS BOMBING HAS CAUSED A UNIQUE SITUATION WITH BLOOD DONATIONS?
THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE PICTURES WE'RE SEEN THAT ILLUSTRATED PERHAPS MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE PHOTOS THEY ARE PORING OVER TO DETERMINE WHO MAY HAVE LEFT THESE DEVICES BEHIND.
HE IS CURRENTLY IN STABLE CONDITION.
MANY WERE ON THE SCENE BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS DOING SECURITY FOR THE MARATHON AND ONCE THEY SECURED THE LOCATION AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS THEY BEGIN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING THE EVIDENCE.
SOME OF THE VICTIMS HAVE LOST LEGS.
PICTURES WITH NUMBERS AND ETCHINGS WITH THE MATERIAL STILL AROUND THEM IN SOME PARTS.
I THINK THERE IS SOME UNDERWRITING LABORATORY NUMBERS ON THERE.
THESE ARE ALL IMAGES AND SYMBOLS THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE SIFTING THROUGH TO SEE IF THAT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MESSAGE THAT WAS PUT HERE WITH THESE TWO BOMBS AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.
THEY HAVE DATABASES WITH ALL THE COMPONENTS WE'VE SEEN HERE IN THE PICTURES AND MORE.
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THEY TOOK PICTURES OF THIS.
JUST ONE OTHER NOTE.
THAT WILL NO DOUBT LAST A LIFETIME.
AFTER THE SUN SET HERE IN BOSTON FOLKS COMING FROM THE CANDLELIGHT VIGIL AS THERE IS MOURNING ACROSS NEW ENGLAND AND ACROSS AMERICA FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE BOMBING AT THE MARATHON.
THEY SHOWED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE MEASURE.
THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AND OTHER SOURCES TRYING TO DETERMINE WHO MIGHT HAVE LEAST THESE PACKAGES BEHIND AND WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE COST THREE LIVES AND INJURED MORE THAN A 170 OTHERS.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A POSITION TO THROW OUT BLOOD BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH TODAY WE CAN'T USE IT ALL.
IT FACES GROWING OPPOSITION.
