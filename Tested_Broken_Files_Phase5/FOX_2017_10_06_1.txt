THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE'LL TALK TO HIM.
ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT?
NEW REPORTS ON WHAT THE GUNMAN HAD IN HIS ROOM AND QUESTIONS NOW.
ONE FOR EACH PERSON KILLED.
OFFICIALS TELL NBC THAT THEY FOUND A PHONE CHARGER IN THE ROOM THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE GUNMAN'S CELL PHONE.
IMAGES IN OUR SLIDE SHOW FOR YOU THIS AFTERNOON.
THANK YOU, SARAH.
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT OVER THE COMING DAYS.
IN ADDITION, RECORDS SHOW SOMEBODY ELSE DID ACCESS THAT ROOM WHILE HIS CAR WAS GONE.
SO WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS, A PICTURE IS EMERGING OF STEPHEN PADDOCK THAT PAYMENTS HIM AS A LOSER, ALONER THAT WOULD GO TO PROSTITUTES.
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHILE THE NRA IS SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD REGULATE AND RESTRICT THE BUMP STOCKS, ERIC PRATT SAYS NO.
HERE YOU CAN SEE THE FORMER SERGEANT'S WIDOW AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN AT THE FRONT OF THE PROCESSION LAST NIGHT.
WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS ROOM?
THIS DEVELOPMENT AS INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHY THE GUNMAN FIRED ON A COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL KILLING 58 AND INJURING MORE THAN 400.
HASN'T CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY.
INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS CONCERT KILLER.
FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAY CHARLESTON HARTFIELD WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS THEY EVER KNEW WITH A HEART OF GOLD AND THAT HE DIED TRYING TO SAVE OTHERS.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE YESTERDAY.
WHEN YOU HEAR THE KINDS OF THINGS -- WE'LL HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SUNDAY -- THAT HE DID TO TRY TO HARDEN THE WYNN HOTEL AND TO HARDEN THE ENCORE HOTEL IN TERMS OF BRINGING IN FORMER SEAL TEAMS SIX MEMBERS, FORMER CIA OFFICERS, HIDDEN DETECTORS, HIDDEN PROFILERS IN THE CASINOS.
TRACERS COULD HAVE MADE THIS SHOOTING MORE DEADLY, MORE ACCURATE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE ROUNDS WERE GOING.
