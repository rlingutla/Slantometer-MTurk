INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND THEN TOMORROW STILL MORE SEVERE WEATHER FROM OKLAHOMA CITY ON UP TOWARDS CHICAGO.
ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER OF TORNADOES THAT HAVE TOUCHED DOWN IN OKLAHOMA, INCLUDING THIS ONE WE SAW A BIT EARLIER IN EDMOND.
AS YOU INDICATED, FOR THE WHILE WE WERE IN THE BACK AFTER TARGET STORE ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM WHERE I AM STANDING WITH SEVERAL DOZEN OTHER PEOPLE TAKING SHELTER.
THERE IS LARGE STRUCTURAL DEBRIS.
CONDITIONS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE VERY QUICKLY HERE.
BUT THAT ENDED WITH LAST WEEK'S ASSAULT ON TEXAS WHERE SIX PEOPLE DIED IN GRANBURY NEAR FT. WORTH.
AS THEY REPORTED IN OKLAHOMA A SHORT WHILE AGO, OUR TEAM IS IN PLACE TO COVER IT ALL, INCLUDING NBC'S JANET SHAMLIAN IN OKLAHOMA CITY WHO SPENT SOME TIME HERSELF TAKING SHELTER TODAY.
ALL WITHIN TWO HOURS.
THAT'S VIOLENT.
WE WATCHED AS THIS ALL UNFOLDED IN OKLAHOMA JUST MOMENTS AGO.
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THEM AROUND THE OKLAHOMA CITY AREA, STRETCHING ON UP INTO KANSAS, WARNINGS GALORE.
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT FLASH FLOODING IN A LOT OF THE SLOW-MOVING THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL.
WE STILL HAVE A HIGH TORNADO THREAT AS WE GO LATE INTO THE EVENING TONIGHT, ALL ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST, STRETCHING ON DOWN TOWARDS OKLAHOMA.
IT IS LARGE AND MULTI-VORTEX.
HOLY SMOKES.
THAT IS APPROACHING DOBBS ROAD.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
FOLKS, LOOK AT THAT.
TAKE A LISTEN.
ON THIS SUNDAY NIGHT -- HIGH ALERT.
