INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE PLANS.
I REMEMBER THE LITTLE BOY SAYING I LOVE YOU, MISS CROSSWHITE.
THEIR PARENTS HAD PICKED THEM UP JUST BEFORE THE SCHOOL WENT ON LOCKDOWN MONDAY, BUT THE MAJORITY STAYED INSIDE AS THEY PRACTICED IN DRILLS MANY TIMES.
REPORTER FOR KFOR TV'S CHOPPER 4 WATCHED THE HORROR UNFOLD.
BUT THE OTHER, AT LEAST SEVEN FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF, AND THIS WAS A WEEK THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED WITH CELEBRATION.
I KNOW CERTAINLY YESTERDAY RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS WITH PEOPLE, WHY DON'T SCHOOLS HAVE STORM SHELTERS?
THERE WAS THAT DIRE FIRST REPORT THAT UPWARDS OF 75 STUDENTS AND FACULTY MIGHT BE TRAPPED, MIGHT BE UNACCOUNTED FOR.
FEMA SAYS IT'S LOOKING INTO WHAT CAUSED THE DELAY.
THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.
IT LOOKS LIKE A WAR ZONE AND IT WAS, IN FACT, A FOG OF WAR.
TOMORROW WAS SUPERKIDS DAY AT THE SCHOOL.
WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SAFE HOUSES WITHIN HOUSES ACROSS THIS REGION GIVEN THE WEATHER HERE?
THE TWISTER'S DEVASTATING PATH 17 MILES LONG.
WE TALK ABOUT THE FOG OF WAR IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.
AND IT'S JUST AS DEVASTATED AS PLAZA TOWERS.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT BLAST, CERTAINLY THAT IS AN AMAZING ANALOGY.
PEOPLE'S HOMES.
THEY'RE NOT SURE.
I SAID, OKAY, I'LL GET THEM IN.
