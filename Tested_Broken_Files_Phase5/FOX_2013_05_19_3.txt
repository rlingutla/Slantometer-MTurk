PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
ALREADY SEE SOME GUSTY WINDS EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THAT TORNADO.
IT IS SURREAL.
AND NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE VIDEO COME IN FROM STRINGERS.
THIS IS SHOWING THE DEBRIS FIELD AND THIS REALLY COMMUNICATES TO THE FORECASTING EXPERTS AND I KNOW JANICE DEAN IS WATCHING THIS, THIS COMMUNICATES THE SIZE AND POWER OF THIS TYPE OF MONSTER HITTING THE GROUND.
THANK YOU.
THAT IS PART OF THAT CELL AS I MENTIONED THAT IS ACTUALLY SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT THESE TWO MAJOR CELLS IF YOU LOOK AT THE RADAR THAT ARE SPAWNING THE TORNADOES.
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN AND OUT FROM OKLAHOMA AND NOW ADD IOWA TO THE LIST OF PEOPLE NOW MILLIONS OF THEM WHO NEED TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT.
FOX URGENT.
YOU ARE TALKING WITH US.
OKLAHOMA IS THE AREA I WANT TO FOCUS IN WITH THE VISUALS OF THE FUNNEL CLOUDS DROPPING FROM THE SKY.
TAKING A LOOK AT THE SEVERE THREAT FROM TEXAS ALL THE WEIGH UP TO THE MIDWEST THE GREAT LAKES WITH THE CONCENTRATED RISK OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS.
EARLIER ON TODAY THE THUNDERSTORMS CLEARED AND THEN THE SUN COMES OUT AND HEATS UP THE ATMOSPHERE AGAIN.
HE IS IN THE RAIN AND HAIL UP HERE NOT TOO FAR FROM GAIL OKAY.
OKLAHOMA REALLY RIGHT NOW FOR TORNADO ACTIVITY THIS AREA NO STRANGE TO TORNADOES BUT THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN THE SIREN COMBOSS   GO UP.
SO YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE.
WITH THE WIND THAT BLOWS IN OKLAHOMA IT CAN CERTAINLY BLOW HE A PIECE OF HAIL THAT BIG INTO A WINDOW SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE NEAR THE WINDOWS WHEN THAT IS FALLING EITHER.
WE HAVE VIDEO FROM EARLIER WHERE THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS SPINNING AROUND AND POPPED UP ON THE SCREEN.
HARRIS WE ARE ON THE PHONE OBVIOUSLY HEADING UP I-35.
ANYBODY YOU KNOW GET HIT BY THAT OR WERE PEOPLE PRETTY MUCH TUCKED INSIDE?
MOMENTS AGO WE HAD ENORMOUS TOUCHDOWN AND I'M SEEING REPORTS OF DAMAGE.
