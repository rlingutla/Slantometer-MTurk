INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND SURE ENOUGH, THROUGH THAT TOWN IT WENT, A MILE WIDE AT THE BOTTOM, TO TWO MILES AT SOME POINTS.
YELLING AT EACH OTHER.
THE HOSPITAL IS PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED SAYS THE MAYOR.
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO NEED THAT I JUST -- I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
SO THIS STORM IS SIMILAR BUT WORSE.
IT HAS BEEN.
I CAN'T FIND IT INSPECTS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND THERE IS AN SIN ANGEL OF BRANDON BROUGHT ME HOME.
A PLACE WHERE WOULD SAW RESIDENTS AND NEIGHBORS AND OFFICIALS TRYING TO PULL PEOPLE FROM THE RUBBLE, WHERE WE KNOW THEY AFFECTED A NUMBER OF RESCUES OF CHILDREN.
THAT'S ONE EFFORT WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF RIGHT NOW.
VERY SIMILAR TRACK.
THE FRONT IS STILL STANDING BUT THE BACK GONE.
THE PATH OF THIS ONE IS SIMILAR, THOUGH LONGER, SIMILAR, THOUGH WIDER.
THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING DEBRIS OVER THERE AND IT'S PLAYING OUT I SEE IT IN THREE SPOTS IN THE BACKGROUND PEOPLE DIGGING THROUGH THE RUBBLE TRYING TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS UNDER IT AND IF SOMEONE IS ALIVE WE KNOW THE NEWS HELICOPTERS NO-FLY ZONE.
THEY COULDN'T GET IN AND OUT THEREOF IN THE EARLY GOING.
THAT IS UNTIL HURRICANE KATRINA CAME THROUGH.
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, IN FACT, SAYING THAT THERE WERE SOME 20 MILES SCORED INTO THE EARTH WHEN THIS THING CAME THROUGH.
WE WATCHED TRIAGE CENTERS BEING SET UP ON SCENE.
REPORTING FROM A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO AS WE WERE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON EXACTLY HOW SERIOUS THIS SITUATION IS.
HOUSE AFTER HOUSE AFTER HOUSE STORIES UNBELIEVABLE DAY AND MORE.
