OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
OUR CORRESPONDENT MIKE TOBIN IS NEARBY AND ON SCENE IN WATERTOWN.
LAY DOWN IN -- I DIDN'T SEE ANYBODY GOING BACK.
AND IT'S A VER VERY NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE WERE QUITE CLOSE AND THEN THEY JUST STARTED PUSHING US BACK.
WE STOPPED, WE RAN OVER HERE, WE SAW POLICE FLOODING THE SCENE.
THIS IS THE EXACT SAME AREA THAT WAS CORDONED OFF AND LOCKED DOWN FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE DAY.
VERY FLUID SITUATION AS YOU CAN IMAGINE.
AND IT APPEARS THAT SOMETHING IS HAPPENING AT THIS MOMENT IN WATERTOWN.
WE HEARD A SERIES -- MANY HERE BELIEVE INCLUDING MYSELF THAT THERE WERE GUNSHOTS FIRED.
SAY IT AGAIN?
THE SUSPECT CONSIDERED INSIDE THIS BOAT ACCORDING TO SOURCES.
FAIR, BALANCED AND STILL UNAFRAID.
JARED HOLBROOK IF HE IS ON THE LINE LIKE TO BRING HIM BACK MORE ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL HIDING SPOT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOW WE SEE IF YOU LOOK FURTHER ON DOWN, SOME MORE WELL-ARMED OFFICIALS.
BELIEF NOW THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IN THE BOSTON MARATHON SHOOTING IS DOWN ON THE STREET IN WATER TOWN MASS.
POLICE WANT TO RUSH TO THE SCENE AND STATE POLICE WERE, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE EVERYBODY WAS BACK.
A WHOLE ROLL OF FIRE CRACKERS.
SUSPECT IS IN THAT BOAT IN THE BACKYARD AT 57 FRANKLIN STREET IN WATERTOWN.
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO PULL BACK TO ALLOW A ROBOT TO GO IN THERE AND TAKE A LOOK AROUND AND SEE THE SUSPECT FIRSTHAND AND TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ANY EXPLOSIVES MAY BE THERE AS WELL.
AND MARK, I JUST HEARD FROM A VERY TRUSTWORTHY STATE SHOTS FIRED AND A SUSPECT IS DOWN.
WHAT THESE NEW EXPLOSIONS ARE, WE DON'T YET KNOW.
