INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT'S HOME TO 900,000 DISPLACED SYRIANS.
THEY THINK MORE THAN ONE GAS WAS USED INCLUDING SARIN.
1,300 TONS OF MATERIALS WERE DESTROYED.
THESE ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS OF TOXIC GAS EXPOSURES.
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI HALEY SAID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WASN'T INTERESTED IN REMOVING AL-ASSAD FROM POWER AND IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.
WHAT DID IT SAY?
THERE'S A POLITICAL REALITY THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS THE WORST TOXIC GAS ATTACK ON A DAMASCUS SUBJECT BOSCH.
MEDICS REPORTING THAT ROCKET ATTACKS AND CLINICS TREATING THE WOUNDED.
SO WHAT NOW?
THE WHITE HOUSE SHORTLY BEFORE THEN PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO BLAME FOR THIS FOR NOT ENFORCING THAT INFAMOUS RED LINE IF THE SYRIAN REGIME OF BARBER AL-ASSAD HAD USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE, THIS IS A WEEK AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID IT'S UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE AL-ASSAD'S FUTURE.
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE WILL TAKE ACTION TO DISABUSE HIM OF THIS MURDEROUS NOTION."
THAT IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
THE ATTACK KILLED AT LEAST 58 AND 11 CHILDREN.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS JUST RELEASED THE STATEMENT.
THERE'S REPORTS OF PEOPLE FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, PEOPLE UNRESPONSIVE.
SPICER IS SAYING OFF CAMERA THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO GET AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENT.
WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW DEFEATING ISIS.
AS YOU RECALL LAST WEEK, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY WEREN'T FOCUSED ON TAKING OUT ASSAD ANYMORE.
