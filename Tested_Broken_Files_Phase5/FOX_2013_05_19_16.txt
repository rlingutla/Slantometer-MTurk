THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE CONDITIONS WHERE YOU WERE TODAY, IS THAT WITH YOU WERE ANTICIPATING,  WHAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TOLD YOU ABOUT?
WE TALKED WITH A STORM SPOTTER THIS.
TOWARDS THE NORTH AND EAST IN IOWA A TORNADO WARNING.
WE KNEW THAT THEY HAD HIT OUTSIDE OKLAHOMA CITY.
WELL, AS THE HAIL WAS COMING DOWN AT FIRST IT STARTED OUT YOU KNOW, LIKE PEA SIZED AND THEN GOT TO MORE BIG MARBLES AND THEN GOLF BALL WE CAME IN THE HOUSE.
IT IS TERRIFYING.
I GOOLSBEE WITH THE VIDEO WATCHING WITH YOU AS IT HAPPENS.
I HAVE KIDS UP IN STILLWATER IN COLLEGE.
WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS OF DAMAGE.
REALLY TWO BIG STORMS, JEFF, THAT ARE PRODUCING POSSIBLE TORNADOES HERE RIGHT HERE IN AND AROUND CENTRAL OKLAHOMA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STAY SAFE, EMILY OUR FIRST PERSON EYES TONIGHT ON FOX REPORT.
BEING IN THE CITY AND KNOWING THERE IS A TORNADO MILES AWAY, THERE WAS A TORNADO THAT TOUCHED DOWN NEAR MY NEIGHBORHOOD.
THAT CAN DO SOME PRETTY BAD MEDICAL ATTENTION RELATED DAMAGE I WOULD IMAGINE.
THE PICTURES THAT HAVE COME IN TO FOX NEWS IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES.
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS LIKE COMPARATIVELY TO WHAT YOU EXPERIENCED?
OUR EMERGENCY LEVEL WAS ELEVATED TO A LEVEL TWO IN PREPARATION FOR THE STORM TO COME THROUGH.
DAMAGE COULD BE QUITE SEVERE AND EXTREME IN SOME OF THE AREAS AS THE STORMS PUSH EASTWARD AND THEY ARE NOT LETTING UP UNFORTUNATELY.
THE SYSTEM IS SLOWLY MOVING EASTWARD.
THESE FOLKS REALLY NOT OUT OF THE WOODS FOR THE NEXT 2-24    12-24 HOURS.
