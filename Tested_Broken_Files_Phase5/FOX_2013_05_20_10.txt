OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
OKLAHOMA SUCKER PUNCHED BY SECOND ROUND OF TWISTERS STILL STAGGERING FROM YESTERDAY'S TORNADOES.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE WARNING WAS LAST NIGHT IN ONE PARTICULAR TOWN.
RICK, THIS IS HARD TO BELIEVE.
THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS CONFIRMED SIX DEATHS IN MOORE.
AGAIN, WE HAVE CORRESPONDENTS ON THE GROUND INCLUDING OUR OWN CASEY STEGALL AND IF HE IS AVAILABLE WE WILL GET TO HIM.
CAN I TELL YOU FIRST HAND.
TWO MILES WIDE RIPS THROUGH AREAS SOUTH OF MOORE.
EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEMS WERE NOT UP TO DATE THERE WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH TO DO THAT AND TODAY THEY GOT 16 MINUTES' WARNING WHICH, IN TORNADO ALLEY IS, A LONG TIME THAT STORMS WERE ON THE WAY.
AGAIN I'M READING FROM THE OKLAHOMAN.
THE LOCAL NBC STATION IS REPORTING THAT SOME 24 CHILDREN ARE STILL TRAPPED THERE AND THERE ARE REPORTS, IN FACT, THAT THE SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE.
NOW THIS REPORT OF FOUR MORE AT THE 7/11.
THERE IS NO WAY FOR US TO KNOW AT THIS MOMENT HOW DEVASTATING THIS HAS BEEN IN THE WAY OF HUMAN INJURY AND LOSS OF LIFE.
IT REALLY IS.
BRICKS HEAR IF COMING IN.
SEVEN MINUTES BEFORE 700 IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
WHAT DO YOU GUYS NEED RIGHT NOW.
THE REPORTER FROM THE NBC STATION SAID AND I QUOTE I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE GOING TO START PULLING THESE LITTLE BODIES OUT OF THE RUBBLE VERY SOON.
REMINISCENT OF JOPLIN, MISSOURI.
HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS AFTER 999, THE PROBLEM WAS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE STORM SHELTERS.
IT IS TWISTED METAL AROUND TELEPHONE POLES.
