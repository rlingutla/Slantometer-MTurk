THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS STATION IN PUERTO RICO.
I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE IS A.
NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.
THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.
3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION, AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.
MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT THE ISLAND.
EMERGENCY WORKERS DELIVERED MORE THAN 1 MILLION AND A HALF GALLONS OF WATER TO THE ISLAND.
WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE HURRICANES.
IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.
IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR HIMSELF.
WATER FLOWS FROM THE DAM ON THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND, WHERE OFFICIALS TOLD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.
PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AND AT SAN JUAN TO LINE UP TO BUY GAS.
MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY, A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.
IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE, BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.
HERE'S THE LATEST TRACK FOR YOU, FORECASTERS SAY THEY DO NOT EXPECT THAT CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE UNITED STATES AT ALL.
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GAS TO GO AROUND.
3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A MANY STATES IN THE UNION.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.
OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH STRONGER.
