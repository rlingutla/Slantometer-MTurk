PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
[ SIRENS ] HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN WAITING IN THE STORM SHELTER, THEIR BUNKER.
TONIGHT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU INSIDE THE 17 MILES OF DESTRUCTION, SCHOOLS, NEIGHBORHOODS, HOSPITALS PULVERIZED, AS OUR ABC NEWS TEAM IS EVERYWHERE IN THE STORM ZONE TONIGHT, AND OUR COVERAGE OF THE DIRECT HIT TWISTER OUTBREAK BEGINS WITH ABC'S ANCHOR DAVID MUIR ON THE GROUND RIGHT THERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
PEOPLE'S LIVES SCATTERED ALL OVER THESE PROPERTIES, THERE ARE TOYS, YOU CAN SEE HERE, STROLLERS, THEIR LIVES.
RAN OVER AND GOT ON TOP OF THE KIDS.
WHERE ONE OF NATURE'S RAW FORCES SHATTERED SO MANY LIVES IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.
OR ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE?
IN FACT, TONIGHT, NEARLY TEN MILLION FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF TORNADOES.
I'M THE ONLY ONE.
OH, MY GOD!
SHE HAS A BADLY BRUISED EYE AND FACE, BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.
SO MANY ANIMALS SEPARATED FROM THEIR OWNERS.
AND I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.
TAPE, THAT HUSBAND WHO WATCHED THE TORNADO COMING TOWARD HIS HOUSE, TOWARD HIS FAMILY.
OKLAHOMA TONIGHT WHERE WE LEARNED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THIS COMMUNITY, THAT TORNADO SURPASSED 200 MILES PER HOUR.
TONIGHT, DIRECT HIT, TWISTER OUTBREAK.
THEY ALL ARE SPECIAL TO ME.
STILL AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS," A ONE IN 100 TRILLION CHANCE THAT A HOUSE HIT BY AN EF-4 TORNADO IN 1999 WOULD BE HIT BY A BIG ONE AGAIN.
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE'RE STANDING IN, LOOKS LIKE SO MANY THAT WE DROVE THROUGH TODAY.
IT'S THE GEOGRAPHY.
NEIGHBORS SIFT THROUGH MOUNDS OF RUBBLE TRYING TO SALVAGE WHAT LITTLE SURVIVED, HELPING EACH OTHER CRAM THEIR MEMORIES INTO PLASTIC BAGS.
