INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENTER THIS CONFLICT, SUPPORTING MILITARILY THE REBELS, FIGHTING AGAINST THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD BE FIGHTING THE RUSSIANS AND THE IRANIANS.
CLEARLY HE HAS.
WE DON'T FLOW WHO THEY ARE.
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD SAY, I WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFE HAVENS THAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT.
GOING TO TRY TO STRIKE ASSAD TO DEAL WITH HIS ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE ATTACKS.
PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM.
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE EDUCATION OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
HE WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY AND CAREFULLY NOT SO.
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE LATEST ACTS OF BARBER AL-ASSAD CAN'T BE TOLERATED.
HE'S BEEN STUDIOUSLY NONSPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE WILL TAKE ACROSS THE WORLD.
I APPRECIATE IT.
IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR ME.
WE HAVE ATTEMPTED THAT FOR SIX YEARS.
OF COURSE, FOR MANY REPUBLICANS, IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POLICIES THAT WERE CAUSING THE PROBLEMS PREVIOUSLY.
HE SAID WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE FIGHTING IN SYRIA?
BUT IT'S A HORRIFIC VIDEO THAT THE PRESIDENT SAID CHANGED HIS MINDS AND THE NATION'S POLICY TOWARDS THIS CONFLICT.
YESTERDAY THE ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED KILLING DOZENS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN ASLEEP IN THEIR BEDS.
WE'VE HEARD SEAN SPICER SAY THAT THIS WEEK.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMAGES OF LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE BABIES DYING AND SUFFERING HORRIBLY IN THE WAKE OF IN GAS ATTACK.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IN FROM THE 30,000 FOOT LEVEL, IT'S CLEAR WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE LAST HOUR AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYTHING GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
