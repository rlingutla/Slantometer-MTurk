INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AND A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE DONE, OF COURSE.
TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FROM RELATIVES OF CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED THE TORNADO'S DIRECT HIT ON THAT SCHOOL PLAZA ELEMENTARY AS I REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS NEWSCAST OFFICIALS TELL US AT LEAST SEVEN CHILDREN DIED IN THAT SCHOOL.
THIS IS THE MEDICAL CENTER OVER HERE.
I'M SHEPARD SMITH THE DAY AFTER THE STORM IN THE MIDDLE OF NEIGHBORHOOD KINGS MANOR AND TELEPHONE ROAD PICKING UP THE PIECES SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS.
IT STILL COULD RISE BUT AT LEAST WE BELIEVE NOW 24 ADDITIONAL CHILDREN DID NOT DIE.
IN THAT SAME SITUATION.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A PLAN TOGETHER.
IT'S ALSO CREATED A WEB SITE SO IF YOU WANT TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE SEARCHING FOR LOVED ONES IN THE WAKE OF THE STORM, YOU CAN.
INTERESTING AS WELL BECAUSE CRAIG FUGATE WAS NOT IN THIS BRIEFING WITH THE PRESIDENT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO OKLAHOMA.
AND CHILDREN ARE A LOT OF WORK FOR A LOT OF FOLKS AROUND HERE NOW.
CAN YOU DONATED TO THE RED CROSS IF YOU LIKE OR THE SALVATION ARMY, OF COURSE, ONLINE OR BY PHONE.
CERTAINLY WILL TAKE SOME TIME.
WE ARE STAYING IN A HOTEL ON NORTH MERIDIAN.
BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT WAS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT HOPE.
THE HOMEOWNER THERE SAYS THAT HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN RODE THE STORM OUT IN THEIR BATHTUB.
HE SAYS HE HAS ALREADY SIGNED A DISASTER DECLARATION TO GET THINGS MOVING RIGHT AWAY.
SHE HAD A BAD FEELING.
SOME ARE COMING HERE TO SLEEP SOME TO REST.
THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF HER HOME SEARCHING FOR HER DOG.
TAKE MUCH MORE TRAFFIC CONGESTION HERE FOR SURE.
