PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AS YOU KNOW, WORLD GOVERNMENTS, INCLUDING OUR OWN, ARE PONDERING WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA CREATING MILLIONS OF REFUGEES, PUTTING PRESSURE ON NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND POTENTIALLY PUNCHING HOLES IN AN ALREADY FRAGILE IMBALANCE THERE.
LET'S TALK ON THE SUBJECT MATTER OF OTHER COUNTRIES ISSUING THREATS TO AMERICA, SHOULD IT GET INVOLVED OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
CURIOUS OF YOUR THOUGHTS.
CRUISE MISSILES LIKE THE ONES I AM ABOUT TO SHOW YOU ARE ONE OF THE WEAPONS IN OUR ARSENAL.
I BELIEVE THE RUGS DON'T WANT CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED, AS DOES THE UNITED STATES, SO WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, I HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.
FOX REPORT, THE LATEST RESPONSE HERE AND OVERSEAS TO NEW TALKS OF MILITARY INTERVENTION AGAINST THE ASSAD REGIME.
HE RENEWED CALLS FOR THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AND REBELS TO PUT DOWN ARMS AND START TALKING.
ASIDE FROM THE WRANGLING BY THE POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS, TODAY, POPE FRANCIS CALLED FOR ACTION, URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO STEP UP EFFORTS TO HELP SYRIA END THE WAR.
IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T ACT WITH MASSIVE FORCE IN SYRIA, IF IT IS JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST TO THE ASSAD REGIME, WHICH MANY ARE PREDICTING, I THINK THE LESSON IRAN DRAWS FROM THAT WE BETTER GET OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITY IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THEN WE WILL BE IMMUNE TO AN AMERICAN SLAP ON THE WRIST.
AMERICAN WAR SHIPS SITTING NOT FAR FROM SYRIA.
THAT IS BLUNT.
A COUPLE HOURS AGO, WE LEARNED THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE TODAY.
THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE REGIME IN IRAN.
NO, THE SYRIANS THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA IS WEAK AND ARE TRYING TO BULLY HIM.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY HAS ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COLLEAGUES OVER THE WEEKEND.
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY AT THIS POINT IT IS PROBABLY TOO LATE.
THE REPORTED CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA'S CAPITAL CITY, KILLING HUNDREDS.
YOU ALSO SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE INVOLVED THERE THE WAY WE ARE, SYRIA IS A SECONDARY ISSUE.
AND I'LL CHANGE TOPICS JUST SLIGHTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS.
I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM FOR THE UNITED STATES IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS REACTING MORE OUT OF POLITICAL CONCERN THAN FROM STRATEGIC THINKING.
