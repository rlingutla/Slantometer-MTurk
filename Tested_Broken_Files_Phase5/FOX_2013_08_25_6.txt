INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE PROBLEM IS THE RED LINE IS THAT IT IS RED, FEW PEOPLE WILL EVER FORGET IT.
JUST HOURS AGO, LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES CALLING FOR A LIMITED MILITARY RESPONSE.
LET'S WATCH THAT AND THEN WE'LL TALK MORE.
I THINK THE SYRIANS THOUGHT THEY WERE BUYING TIME AND MAY YET, BUT THE RHETORIC FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS UNDOUBTEDLY STEPPED UP.
THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS A QUICK INTERVENTION WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC, WHILE SOME LAWMAKERS THINK LEADERS SHOULD BE ACTING OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION, OTHERS SAY THERE SHOULD BE MORE ACTIVITY.
THE U.N. ANNOUNCING SYRIA IS CLAIMING IT WILL ALLOW A TEAM OF INSPECTORS TO EXAMINE THE SITE.
IRAN SAID WE BETTER NOT TOUCH SYRIA, PARAPHRASING IT.
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO ALLOW THEM TO GO IN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE USED BY THE SYRIAN REGIME AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.
ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION, THEY DISCUSSED POSSIBLE FUTURE RESPONSES BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND AGREED TO STAY IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.
I THINK THAT'S FINE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE PRESIDENT DOES USE MASSIVE FORCE TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF FORCES WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF, IT COULD WELL RESULT IN THE OPPOSITION TAKING POWER, WHICH I DON'T THINK IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST EITHER.
