GO LEFT!
GOT A TORNADO ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW, GUYS.
OFF TO THE RIGHT.
WE ARE ALMOST RIGHT UNDER THE TORNADO AT THIS POINT.
MINNEAPOLIS TO KANSAS CITY, RIGHT ON DOWN TOWARDS TULSA AND OKLAHOMA CITY.
TORNADOES ARE LIKELY.
OF THE QUIETEST TORNADO SEASONS ON RECORD DUE TO A COLD SPRING.
THE POWER LINES ARE STILL DOWN FROM LAST NIGHT'S STORM AND HERE WE GO AGAIN.
IN OKLAHOMA CITY, AN OMINOUS WALL CLOUD APPEARED LATE THIS AFTERNOON AS ALL EYES TURNED TO THE THREATENING SKIES AMID A FLURRY OF WARNINGS.
WE GOT A TORNADO?
WHIPPING WINDS AN TORNADOES PUMMELING THE CENTRAL PLAINS.
SO EVEN MORE PEOPLE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THOSE WARNINGS.
LOOK AT THE ROTATION!
AND WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME LARGE HAIL.
WE HAVE MORE STORMS COMING IN TONIGHT.
