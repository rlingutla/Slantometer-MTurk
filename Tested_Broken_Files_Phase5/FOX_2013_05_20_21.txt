PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
BUT THE CHANCES ARE THERE ARE PLENTY WHO DO.
YOU SAID YOU WERE IN A STORM.
THIS IS THE O'REILLY FACTOR HOUR FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WE'LL CONTINUE WITH NEWS COVERAGE HERE AND O'REILLY WILL BE WITH YOU AT SOME POINT WE BELIEVE.
FOUR PEOPLE KFOR REPORTS ARE DEAD AND MORE NEAR FOURTH STREET AND TELEPHONE ROAD.
HOW DID YOU MAKE IT THIS WAY?
WITH THAT AS A BACKGROUND, I CAN TELL IT YOU THAT THE LOCAL NBC STATION HAS HE A REPORTER ON SCENE AT PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND JUST REPORTED THAT EMERGENCY CREWS NOW BELIEVE UP TO TWO DOZEN CHILDREN ARE BELIEVED TO BE TRAPPED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCHOOL DEBRIS AND THAT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE NOW TURNING FROM A SEARCH AND RESCUE MISSION TO A RECOVERY MISSION.
SHE SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT TODAY WHO OFFERED THE NATION'S HELP AND GAVE A DIRECT LINE TO HIS OFFICE.
THIS MORNING, IN THE EARLY GOING THEY WERE CLEANING UP AND THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE BEGAN TO WARN JUST AS IT HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE, GET OUT NOW.
THEY SAID THE GOVERNOR SAYS THE LAND LINES ARE DOWN IN THE MOORE AREA AND SO MANY PEOPLE USING THEIR MOBILE PHONES THAT CELL LINES ARE CONGESTED AND MANY CASES THE CELL LINES ARE DOWN MARC AGE IN DAMAGE AS STORM RIPS THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY.
AS THE REPORT INDICATE FROM THE LOCAL NBC I MEANT TO SAY, THEY TRIED TO GET INTO A FREEZER DURING THE TORNADO.
WE KNOW OF EIGHT.
AT THIS MOMENT THEY ARE JUST WORKING TO TRY TO FIND WHO MAY BE ALIVE OUT THERE.
HE HAD BEEN DOWN THE LINE FROM THE STORM FOR OUR COVERAGE OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.
THE THING THAT WE TRY TO HOLD ON TO IS THAT THE EFFORTS THAT WE MAKE, SHELTER THEY ARE SAFE, DURING ONE OF THESE EVENTS.
PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN COULD BE SEEN RUSHING TO THE SCHOOL, DODGING DOWNED POWER LINES AND SCATTERED DEBRIS.
ITEMS THAT WERE COVERED SO WE COULD NOT SEE WHAT THEY WERE.
AND THE LOCAL NBC STATION KFOR TELEVISION IS NOW REPORTING THROUGH A REPORTER ON SCENE AT PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN MOORE THAT 24 CHILDREN ARE TRAPPED BENEATH THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THAT ALL ARE DEAD AND THAT THEY NOW HAVE A RECOVERY EFFORT UNDERWAY TO REMOVE THE BODIES OF THESE THIRD GRADERS.

ONE, PLAZA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE EVERYONE IS ACCOUNTED FOR.
PEOPLE ARE THROWING DEBRIS UP IN THE AIR TRYING TO REACH PEOPLE IT'S ALMOST LIKE PEOPLE ARE IN DISBELIEF IN SHOCKS.
