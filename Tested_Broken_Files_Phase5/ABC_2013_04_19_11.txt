PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE WAS INJURED, YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY ELSE WAS INJURED.
THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A SUICIDE VEST AND, DICK CLARK, HOW WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE, ULTIMATELY, IF HE HAD ONE ON OR NOT IF THEY COULDN'T APPROACH THE BOAT?
I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS JUST LIKE THAT TOMORROW.
AND HIS EARLIER TWEET, "WE GOT HIM."
AND NOW THERE'S REALLY -- I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EXPLOSIONS OR GUN FIRE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR, I'D SAY ABOUT ANOTHER 45 MINUTES, HOUR AT THIS INT.
IT'S A VERY CLOSE KNIT NEIGHBORHOOD.
AGAIN, WE HEARD THIS REPORT FROM AN EYEWITNESS AND IT WAS SO EARLY AND WE WERE ALL TRYING TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL, THAT THE POLICE HAD BEEN OVERHEARD SAYING THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM SNEAKING A LOOK OUT FROM UNDER THAT COVER ON THE BOAT.
EVERYONE IS STILL HERE.
CONFIRM THAT THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE.
INITIALLY THERE WAS A LOT OF GUN FIRE, SO, WE WERE TOLD, GO OUTSIDE, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE DID.
ONE LITTLE BOY SAID TO HIS DAD, "IT IS OVER?"
AH, WE DID HEAR THAT REPORT OF SOME EXPLOSION.W, TELL ME AB BOAT AGAIN AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT?
I WANT TO BRING IN DICK CLARK, BECAUSEHIIS STUNNING NEWS, DICK.
ONE OF OUR OFFICIALS GOT A TEXT FROM THE SCENE SAYING SUSPECT IS ALIVE IN THE AMBULANCE.
WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS THE FOG OF INFORMATION RIGHT NOW BUT YOU DID THINK THAT YOU OVERHEARD POLICE IN THE BACKYARD TALKING ABOUT THE SUSPECT, PERHAPS, TRYING TO LOOK OUT OF THIS COVERING THAT WAS ON THAT BOAT AND WE WILL TRY TO VERIFY THAT THROUGHOUT THIS EVENING.
AND, AGAIN, WHEN WE HEAR THAT HE IS IN CUSTODY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
BUT YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE HE WAS BLEEDING OUT PRETTY BADLY.
HE LIFTED UP THE ZIP COVER AND HE -- AND AS HE WENT UP TO THE LADDER, HE NOTICED BLOOD AND THEN HE THOUGHT HE SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A BODY LAYING IN THE BOAT.
UNCLEAR ON WHAT EXACTLY HIS CONDITION IS, DIANE.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE WENT.
