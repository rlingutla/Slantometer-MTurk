INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT WAS JUGGLING TWO FOREIGN ISSUES, CHINA AND SYRIA.
ABC EAST ALEX MARQUARDT LEADS US SYRIAN AIRBASE HIT BY THE U.S. MILITARY BACK UP AND RUNNING, NEW PHOTOS SHOWING SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THE U.S. STRIKE.
THE REPORTED NEW BOMBING IN THAT SAME TOWN WHERE THE CHEMICAL ATTACK KILLED DOZENS.
NOT LONG AGO TRUMP WAS RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.
ASKED FOR THEM HE SAID.
THE MARKINGS FROM THE BOMBINGS SEEN ON BUNKERS.
WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE STRIKE HE POINTED TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED.
TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDING THE DECISION NOT TO BOMB THE RUNWAYS.
IMAGES SHOWING AIRCRAFT AND BOMBED OUT FUEL TANKS AND DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT SHELTERS.
ALEX JOINS US LIVE.
WE ARE CALLING ON BASHAR AL ASSAD TO CEASE THE USE OF THE WEAPONS.
THAT FATHER'S STORY AND THE IMAGES SO DEVASTATING.
DESCRIBING THE MOMENT THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN YOUSSEF SAID I WASN'T AWARE OF ANYTHING.
HE LOST 25 RELATIVES IN THE ATTACK DURING WHICH HE FAINTED.
TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A DEFENSE.
BACK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WANTED TO PUNISH SYRIA FOR A PREVIOUS CHEMICAL ATTACK.
OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO CHANGE TO OUR MILITARY POSTURE.
THE REASON YOU GENERALLY DON'T HIT RUNWAYS IS THAT THEY ARE EASY AND INEXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY FIX.
PRESIDENT STILL INSISTS THE TOMAHAWK MISSILE STRIKE WAS AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.
EVEN BEAUTIFUL BABIES WERE CRUELLY MURDERED IN THIS VERY BARBARIC ATTACK.
