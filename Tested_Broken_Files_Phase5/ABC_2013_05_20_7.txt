PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE SIREN.
SHE WAS TAKING IT IN STRIDE BECAUSE SHE WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF WHAT USED TO BE HER HOME, WHICH NO LONGER EXISTED.
WELL, THANKFULLY NONE OF THE FIVE CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ARE LISTED IN CRITICAL.
BROOK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING WITH US TONIGHT.
WE WERE TOLD TO GET IN OUR TORNADO PRECAUTION SYSTEM.
ARE THERE AMBULANCES GOING OUT ALL OVER TOWN, OR ARE YOU STILL LOOKING FOR REINFORCEMENTS?
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD, GONE.
THERE'S A HUGE FLASH RIGHT THERE.
WE LINE OUR KIDS UP, STRAIGHT INTO THE INNER MOST BATHROOM AND PUT MATS ON TOP OF ALL OF US, HUDDLED TOGETHER UNTIL IT WAS OVER.
A MASSIVE TORNADO DESCENDING THROUGH THE HEARD LAND LIKE A WRECKING BALL.
PEOPLE DIGGING AND CRAWLING THROUGH RUBBLE.
SOME KIDS WERE NOT FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS OF STAYING AWAY FROM UNDER THE, UH, SINKS AND STUFF.
AT LAST CHECK, WE RECEIVED A TOTAL OF 37 PATIENTS.
AND SO MANY HAD SHELTERS.
AN ENTIRE TOWN IN RUINS.
WE WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST AS YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.
AND IS IT POSSIBLE, WITH PRIVACY, TO GIVE US ANY SENSE OF THEIR CONDITION?
STILL AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS," WE HAVE MORE STORIES FROM THE STORM ZONE, INCLUDING THE INCREDIBLE ONE OF A FATHER AND SON RE-UNITED TONIGHT.
I KNOW WALKING AROUND AND SEEING EVERYBODY, IT'S PRETTY TOUGH.
I KNOW THIS IS PRETTY WILD TO TAKE IN ALL AT ONE TIME.
