PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
SHE'S ON THE GROUND IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
RUBBLE.
WHAT KIND OF INJURIES ARE YOU SEEING?
THANK YOU, GINGER AND I KNOW YOU'RE STANDING BY FOR THE REST OF THE BROADCAST.
SHE WAS ABLE TO BE WITH ME.
'RE LOOKING A THE THE UNBELIEVABLE DEBRIS FIELD.
REFUGEES WITH SUITCASES OF ALL TWHA HAVE LEFT, WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET BEFORE THE SUN SETS HERE IN MOORE.
BUT THEN THEY MOVED US TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS BATHROOM.
SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S OVER WITH YET.
NEW TORNADO WARNINGS RIGHT NOW, AND FINAL THOUGHTS FROM THE STORM ZONE.
BUT A LITTLE 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, I WAS IN THAT SCHOOL.
THIS IS A LARGE, VIOLENT TORNADO.
[ CRACKLING, WIND BLOWING ]  AS OF RIGHT NOW, 37 ARE REPORTED DEAD.
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS THIS STORM RIGHT NOW ON A PRELIMINARY CATEGORY HERE AS AN EF-4, THIS IS RARIFIED TERRITORY FOR TORNADOES.
DIANE AS THE SUN SETS OVER THIS MASSIVE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, THE FOCUS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD I'M IN HAS SHIFTED FROM BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WHICH WAS HIT BY THE TORNADO, TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AS THEY SEARCH UNDER PILES OF WOOD AND BRICK AND STONE THAT USED TO BE HOUSES, LOOKING FOR, EITHER SURVIVORS, OR FOR THE DEAD.
AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO BEEN HEARING EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTIONS, VIVID ONES, OF THE UTTER DESTRUCTION ON THE GROUND.
AND WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE CAN GET IN AND LOOK AT THE DEBRIS FIELD THERE.
THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL AND THE SIGNATURE OF A VERY LARGE AND VERY POWERFUL TORNADO.
AND WE ARE HEARING REPORTS OF VICTIMS BEING RUSHED TO NEARBY HOSPITALS.
YOU CAN SEE THE COLOSSAL TORNADO BEARING DOWN ON ON THE STREET.
