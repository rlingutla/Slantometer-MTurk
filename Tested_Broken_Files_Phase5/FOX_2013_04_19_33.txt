THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IS THERE A HELICOPTER OVERHEAD AT THIS POINT?
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SOMEWHERE AROUND HUNDREDS OF OFFICERS ON SCENE AND THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IS SURROUNDED.
OR THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY DID.
WE TOOK A RIGHT.
AND WE ARE LOOKING AT AN AREA OF BIRCH AND WALNUT IN WATER TOWN WHICH RUNS SORT OF OFF OF ARSENAL STREET IN WATERTOWN.
AND, FRANKLY THEY RESPECTED THAT REQUEST AND DID SO.
AND AT SOME POINT, IN THE NEAR TERM, WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM POLICE ABOUT WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED AND WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE THAT BOSTON AND THE UNITED STATES' NIGHTMARE IS AT LEAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE AT LEASE -- LEAST THIS STAGE OF IT.
THEY ARE SAYING THAT ONE OF THE SUSPECTS IS LIKELY ONE OF THE SUSPECTS HERE IN THIS WHOLE THING IS DOWN.
WE TALKED WITH WITH MARY SULLIVAN AN EYEWITNESS WHO SAID SHE WAS GETTING OUT BECAUSE THE LOCKDOWN HAD BEEN LIFTED AND SHE WENT OUT AND WAS GOING TO TAKE THING TO FOR A WALK AS THEY OFTEN DO AND SUDDENLY HEARD THE GUNFIRE AND KNEW THINGS WERE NOT NORMAL.
EVERY FRONT PORCH HAS AN AREA UNDERNEATH IT AND THERE IS A -- PLENTY OF PLACES WHO HIDE THE WAY CONSTRUCTION IS DONE IN WATER TOWN BUT THEY SEARCHED IT ALL AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.
VERY ACTIVE SCENE.
BEEN ON EDGE FOR A WHILE.
20 MINUTES AGO REPORTS OF SHOTS FIRED THEY CAME INTO OUR NEWSROOM FROM NEIGHBORS AND WE WENT FROM HAVING VERY LITTLE GOING ON OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWING THAT PRESS CONFERENCE VERY MELLOW IN THE STREETS OF WATERTOWN.
THE FIRE FIGHT THAT ENSUED AND THEN HIS SUBSEQUENT FLEEING ON FOOT.
RIGHT, ONE OF THOSE WAS VERY LOUD.
WE HAVE, UNDERSTAND THAT THE SUSPECT IS IN THE BOAT.
WE WERE TOLD WE COULDN'T COME UP.
PHONE SHE IS ON FRANKLIN STREET ANDEPORT OF SHOTS FIRED.
I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE WALKING THIS WAY OR OTHER WAY.
JOINING US MY STATIONS ACROSS THE STATION.
