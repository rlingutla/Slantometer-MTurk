THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
MRS. BITTLE, WHAT GOT HER THROUGH.
THE OKLAHOMA TEACHERS AND EVERY TEACHER IN THIS COUNTRY WHO JUMPS IN WHEN OUR CHILDREN NEED THEM.
MY SON AND ALL OF THE KIDS HUDDLED DOWN WITH THEIR HANDS CLASPED BEHIND THEIR HEADS.
IT'S ALMOST OVER!
MRS. DIEDZIK, WHO TOLD THEM THIS --  IT'S ALMOST OVER!
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN THE TORNADO HIT, SHE HAD HER CHILDREN SINGING IN THE HALLWAY, TRYING TO DISTRACT THEM.
THEIR SCREAMS WE WILL NEVER FORGET.
THE TEACHERS PROTECTING THEIR STUDENTS, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY OF THEM ARE PARENTS, TOO, WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN IN THOSE TWO SCHOOLS.
OUR CHILD IS MY CHILD, SHE SAID.
MY ENTIRE CLASS WAS SAFE AND WELL.
I HATE THIS!
SO MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO PARENTS.
THEY WERE REMEMBERING, BECAUSE THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT OF SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR.
AND IN THE CLASSROOM NEXT DOOR, WE WERE SURPRISED TO MEET MISS DOMINICK, ALREADY BACK PICKING UP THE PIECES.
ALL DAY LONG AND ALL YEAR LONG.
BUT SHE KNEW IT WOULD CALM THEM.
EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WOULDN'T GO THROUGH.
IT'S ALMOST OVER!
WE HEARD THAT TEACHER TRYING TO CALM HER STUDENTS THE MOMENT THAT TORNADO HIT.
AND LYING ON TOP OF HIM AND THE OTHER CHILDREN, HIS TEACHER, MRS. BITTLE.
