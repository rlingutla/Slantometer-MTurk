THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s

THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE THE STORM WAS AT ITS WIDEST.
THERE ARE ABOUT 10 ELDERLY PATIENTS INSIDE AT THE TIME.
ON THIS DAY IN 1999, THE PEOPLE OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA HAD BEEN CLEANING UP FOR 19 DAYS.
WE WERE UP FOR HOURS LOOKING AT THE DESTRUCTION THE TORNADO INFLICTED.
LET'S GO AGAIN TO THE LEFT AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE AREAS ARE RESTRICTED FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO LET THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE COME AND GET TO THEIR HOMES, GET TO THEIR BELONGINGS AND TRY TO SALVAGE WHAT THEY CAN.
SCOTT, PULL OUT AND SHOW FORWARD IF YOU WOULD, AND YOU WILL SEE AHEAD OF US THE PATH OF THE STORM WAS MUCH THINNER, MEANING THE CLOUDS HAD LIFTED HIGHER AND THE PART OF THE CONE THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND IS MUCH SMALLER.
TOBY KEITH GREW UP RIGHT HERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
EVERYTHING FROM PASSING OUT WATER BOTTLES, OFFERING FOOD TO RESCUE WORKERS AND THE MEDIA FOR THAT MATTER.
ALMOST LIKE HIT BY EARTHQUAKE.
TORNADO IS JUST ANOTHER BAD DAY BLOOD ROCK WE ARE RIGHT BACK IN THE MIDDLE.
GET EVERYTHING UP AND RUNNING AND THEN GET PAST THE FUNERALS AND THE SHOCK OF THING THIS AND ONCE WE TURN THE CORNER THEN WE WILL ALL DIVE IN AND TRY TO RAISE A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE IN THE MUSIC LOVE TO DO.
OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU ALONG THE PATH OF THE STORM.
