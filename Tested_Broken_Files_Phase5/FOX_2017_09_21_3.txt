INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT'S A SLOW-MOVING STORM.
A COUPLE OF FEET OF FLOODING AROUND THESE APARTMENTS.
HURRICANE MARIA ROARING ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN NOW LEAVING BEHIND ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION.
RESCUE WORKERS TODAY DEALING WITH DOWNED STREETS AND FLOODING STREETS AS THEY TRY TO REACH VICTIMS THAT NEED HELP.
WE'VE SEEN A HYDRANT USED AS A BATH THIS MORNING, SHEPARD.
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHITE SPREAD DAMAGE IN ST. CROIX AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.
THE SAME AREA, AMBULANCES TRAPPED UNDER THE COLLAPSED ROOF.
MARIA IS BRINGING CATASTROPHIC FLOODING TO PUERTO RICO.
THE STORM DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF HOMES AND KNOCKED OUT ELECTRICITY TO THE ISLAND AND BROUGHT DOWN CELL PHONE TOWERS AND LEAVING MOST PEOPLE UNABLE TO CALL FOR HELP OR CALL FOR FAMILY MEMBERS.
IT'S GOING TO ALLOW MARIA TO MOVE TO THE NORTH.
KEEPING THIS WELL OFFSHORE AND THEN EVENTUALLY BY THURSDAY TO FRIDAY OUT TO SEE.
UP HERE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.
AS LONG AS WE THREAT THIS NEEDLE BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE EAST COAST, I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING GOOD.
THE STORM HIT THE ISLAND AS A CATEGORY FOUR STORM, 155 MILES AN HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS.
LOOK AT THAT.
STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN WITH MORE.
WITHOUT HELP QUICKLY, THAT COULD STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN.
WINDS SO POWERFUL, THEY RIPPED CONCRETE BALCONIES OFF OF WALLS AND NOW MARIA HEADED FOR THE TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE BAHAMAS.
FORECASTERS SAY MARIA REGAINED MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS AS IT MOVED OFF THE COAST OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TODAY.
CERTAINLY BEACH EROSION.
