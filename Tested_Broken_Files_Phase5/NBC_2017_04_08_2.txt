THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
REVERBERATIONS ON A STRIKE ON AN SYRIAN AIRFIELD ARE GETTING LOUDER, NOT JUST IN WORDS BUT IN ACTION.
FOOTAGE SHOWS SOME DAMAGE AND DEFIANTLY FIGHTER JETS TAXIYING AND TAKING OFF IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.
ANN COULTER WRITING THOSE WHO WANTED US MEDDLING IN MIDDLE EAST VOTED FOR OTHER CANDIDATES AND AN EDITOR QUESTIONED ABOUT SIGNS OF UNREST RESPONDING UNREST, I'M APAPLEPTIC.

BEAUTIFUL BABIES.
I DO NOT THINK HE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO AIR STRIKES, BUT IT WAS A GOOD WARNING.
