THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
CELLPHONE VIDEO FROM INSIDE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THE FURY OF THE MONSTER TORNADO.
IT'S ALMOST OVER.
TEACHER WITH THE WHISTLE, TRYING TO CALM THE STUDENTS.
JUST BEYOND THAT CAR, SHE TAKES ME UNDERNEATH THE TWISTED METAL, DOWN THE HALLWAYS, ALL THAT'S LEFT OF THE SCHOOL.
NOT BE A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRY BABIES.
SUPERSTARS AND ANONYMOUS VICTIMS ALIKE.
AS WE WALK TOWARD IT, THE FIRST THING WE NOTICE, THE MANGLED PLAYGROUND.
THE FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM BACK IN THE CORNER THERE, WHERE HER SON'S TEACHER WAS LYING ON TOP OF HIM AND THE OTHER CHILDREN, TO KEEP THEM SAFE.
FROM BOSTON TO D.C., AS FAR WEST AS CLEVELAND, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TOLD TO BRACE FOR HIGH WINDS, HAIL, AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF A TORNADO.
THE ANSWER IS ROOTED IN DUST -- I'M AN OKIE.
OH, THERE'S OUR PLAYGROUND.
HONEY, IT'S OKAY.
OH, MY GOD!

TONIGHT THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY UNDER THE THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER.
