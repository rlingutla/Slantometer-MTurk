OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID HE PLANS TO VISIT THE ISLAND.
OFFICIALS ACROSS THE TERRITORY ARE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS JUST WHAT HOW WIDESPREAD THE DAMAGES AND HOW BAD IT IS IN SOME AREAS, PARTICULARLY THOSE SMALL TOWNS ALONG THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE TERRITORY WHERE THE STORM REALLY DAMAGED SEVERELY.
THAT DISCONNECT, NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOUR LOVED ONES AND LET THEM KNOW HOW YOU'RE DOING.
THIS IS CRAZY.
THEY HAVE SLOWLY STARTED TO COME INTO THE COUNTRY.
PLUS, ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER ESTATES PUERTO RICO.
WE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE.
NOW A THREAT OF A DAM COLLAPSE IS FORCING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOME.
TODAY THE GOVERNOR SAID THE DEATH TOLL REMAINED AT TEN.
MY HUSBAND GOES OUT AT FOUR IN THE MORNING EVERY DAY TO GET GASOLINE FOR THE GENERATOR.
SOME OF THE BEST NEWS I CAN REPORT IS THAT COMMUNICATIONS ARE SLOWLY RETURNING IN SAN ONE.
