INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THE MOORE THEATER RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART OF ALL OF THE DESTRUCTION A PLACE MAYBE WHERE FOLKS COULD GET AWAY AND TAKE THEIR MINDS OFF ALL OF THIS MESS EVEN FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES.
TWO OF THOSE INFANTS, LESS THAN A YEAR OLD.
AND I KNOW THAT ANY TEACHER IN THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME EXACT THING.
WHEN THE WINDS BLEW OUT THE WALLS AND THOSE GERDERS CAME DOWN AND COLLAPSED THE ROOF.
NO PRECISE COUNTY DATE.
GETTING THE PEOPLE BACK IN THEIR HOUSES.
THERE WAS SO MUCH DEBRIS ON THAT DAY THERE WAS SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE.
DESPITE EVERYTHING.
BUT IF YOU COULD PUSH THAT FUNNEL DOWN INTO THE GROUND, THE AREA WHICH IS CONCENTRATED ON THE GROUND, IT'S WIDER.
HE IS SET TO MEET WITH SURVIVORS AND THANK THE RESPONDERS.
AS IT STANDS NOW 24 PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THIS DISASTER.
THEY ARE CRYING THEY ARE UPSET.
THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THEY MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO GET IT ACCOMPLISHED.
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION NOT TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.
THEY LOOKED INSIDE AND MOVED ON.
HE HAS BEEN DRIVING AROUND IN OUR QUICK RESPONSE VEHICLE.
HERE IN MOORE OKLAHOMA, OFFICIALS NOW SAY MONDAY'S TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED AS MANY AS 13,000 HOMES.
AND YOU CAN SEE AGAIN I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS.
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM THE SCHOOL ACROSS ABOUT A FOUR TO FIVE MILE AREA OF THE WORST OF DESTRUCTION.
EVEN IN THAT THEY STILL KNEW TO HELP THEIR CO-WORKERS AND SO I'M SO PROUD OF THEM.
