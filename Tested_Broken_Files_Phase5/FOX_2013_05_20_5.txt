INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
I REMEMBER WITH THE JOPLIN, MISSOURI TORNADO TWO YEARS AGO ALMOST TO THE DATE.
AND THE NUMBERS WILL BE MANY.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY RAW AS WE ARE TRYING TO GET THIS OUT TO YOU.
ALL WE CAN DO IS HOPE THAT THAT REPORTER, WHO IS STANDING THERE AND SPEAKING TO LOCAL OFFICIALS BY SOME MIRACLE IS WRONG.
THAT'S THE SECOND HIGHEST LEVEL.
I HAVE GOT OTHER ON THE GROUND IN MOORE IN THAT AREA TELLING ME MASS CASUALTIES EXTENT OF INJURIES I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY IF A TALLAHASSEE TATTLES THEY ARE SEEING AT THIS POINT.
A MOTHER AND BABY INCLUDED IN THE COUNT.
PUT A PLEA OUT ON FACEBOOK OR TWITTER ASKING MANAGEMENT PEOPLE TO RESPOND TO MOORE.
IT'S JUST THREE MINUTES PAST 600 IN THE CENTRAL TIME ZONE AND IN MOORE OKLAHOMA A THE FOREVER PIEWLS OUT YOU CAN SEE THE PATH THAT THIS STORM CUT.
WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T STAY HERE.
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE 24 THIRD GRADERS WILL NOT COME OUT ALIVE.
ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN THAT'S THE TORNADO AS IT WAS DEVELOPING.
I MEAN I THINK WE NEED, YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE COMMUNITY RIGHT HERE PLAZA TOWERS PEOPLE NEED A LOT.
IT'S DEVASTATING.
OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA CITY WHERE TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY A VERY POWERFUL TORNADO WHICH HAS CUT A SWATH OF DESTRUCTION LIKE RARELY HAVE WE SEEN IN THIS NATION'S HISTORY, FRANKLY.
RESCUERS ARE OUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY NEEDS ASSISTANCE.
THIS IS THE THING TO WHICH WE POINT AS THE WORST IT CAN BE.
AS A RESULT OF THIS GOVERNOR FALLON HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE THE REPORTS THAT WE HAVE NOW CONFIRMED OF THESE FATALITIES, FOUR THAT YOU MENTIONED THERE OF THE 7/11.
40 MINUTES ON THE GROUND IS WHAT WE ARE ALSO HEARING FROM THE STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.
TREES SPLIT IN HALF.
