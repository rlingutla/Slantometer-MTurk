INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
REX TILLERSON IS HEADED TO MOSCOW NEXT WEEK WHERE HE WILL MEET WITH HIS RUSSIAN COUNTER PART.
THE HEAVIEST VOTE THAT A MEMBER OF CONGRESS HAS IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WE ARE TO AUTHORIZE MILITARY FORCE.
I THINK SO FAR VERY LITTLE.
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.
IT WAS TOO WEAK.
BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S THIS PRESIDENT OR ANY PRESIDENT, WE SHOULD NOT SHARE WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.
AL-ASSAD IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WATCHING NOW.
FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE'VE BEEN BEATING HIM UP FOR VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
BARREL BOMBING IS AS WELL.
BUT WE GET ON OUR HIGH HORSE AND BLAME HIM FOR THE WORST CRISIS IN EUROPE SINCE WORLD WAR II AND WE DON'T GET A U.N.
I THINK SAFE ZONES STILL MAKE SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A WAY TO GET SOME OF THESE SYRIAN PEOPLE AWAY FROM THESE BOMBS THAT ARE GOING TO FALL ON THEM, CONVENTIONAL BOMBS AND ARTILLERY.
TWO CONGRESSMEN COMING NOW, FIRST A DEMOCRAT, GREGORY MEEKS OF NEW YORK.
THIS RUSSIAN BLUSTER, HOW DO YOU READ IT?
ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS?
AN AIDE SAID THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS WERE WITHIN HIS AUTHORITY BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE TO CONSULT WITH CONGRESS WHEN THEY CONSIDER NEXT STEPS FOR THE CRISIS IN SYRIA.
SOMETHING THAT DID NOT TIE THE HANDS OF THE FUTURE PRESIDENT.
SO IN THESE AREAS, THEY'RE ABLE TO CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FLIGHT PATTERN HERE.
I'LL SHOW YOU ON SATELLITE IMAGES.
THIS TIME IN COLOR.
I DON'T SEE HOW A DICTATOR, A LEADER OF A COUNTRY WHO HAS SLAUGHTERED 500,000 CITIZENS WILL LAST LONG-TERM.
