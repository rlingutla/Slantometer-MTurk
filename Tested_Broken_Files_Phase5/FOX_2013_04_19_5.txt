INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE SEEN A CONSTANT STREAM OF POLICE CARS WITH THEIR SIRENS ON, RUSHING TOWARDS WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE SITE, ABOUT A MILE WEST OF US.
AND THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, WHATEVER GOVERNMENT IT IS, AND MOST LIKELY WE WILL LEARN THAT WITHIN THE HOURS OR DAYS AHEAD, THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT NEVER FOLLOWED UP, QUOTE, IN ANY WAY SHAPE, OR FORM.
ONE OF THOSE TWO DEFINITELY SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT.
WE CAME BACK OVER TO OUR CAMERA POSITION, COP STARTED SCREAMING DOWN THE STREET TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE GUNSHOTS.
A ROBOT WITH CAMERA SO AUTHORITIES ON SCENE CAN LOOK AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER THIS MAN WHO IS DOWN IN THE STREET IN THE CITY THERE IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD MAY HAVE LEFT ANY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES BEHIND.
THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FROM THE TIME THAT THE CAR CHASE ENDED UP IN WATERTOWN.
OUR LOCAL RADIO STATION IS REPORTING THAT AT ANY RATE, WE ARE PRETTY COMFORTABLE AT THIS POINT WITH THE REPORTING OF WFXT FOX 25 IN BOSTON.
WE KNOW WHAT THE SUSPECT IS CAPABLE OF IN TERMS OF A BOMBS.
YOU CAN IMAGINE A FRANTIC SCENE.
THEY HEARD THE GUNSHOTS AND ACTUALLY PULLED OVER.
I HOPE YOU ARE SAFE.
THE OLDER OF THESE TWO BROTHERS, IT'S OUR STANDING IS SAID TO HAVE THROWN ONE OF THESE PRESSURE COOKER BOMBS OUTS AND TOWARD POLICE.
SHE SEES BLOODY CLOTHES AND BLOOD ON THE BOAT.
IT HAPPENED VERY RAPIDLY.
THIS WOULD BE SUSPECT NUMBER 2.
OBVIOUSLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE SHOTS WHERE THE SHOTS WERE FIRED AND WHAT YOU HEARD.
THE BROTHER WHO DIED LAST NIGHT IN A SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE BECAUSE THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT, NOT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IT NOTES HERE, HAD CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE EXTREMIST TIES.
JUST AS IF FIRE CRACKERS GETTING LIT OFF.
AS IT SO HAPPENS THEY ARE THE ONES RIGHT BY THE SPOT WHERE THIS WENT DOWN JUST ABOUT 35 MINUTES AGO.
I'M A GOOD DISTANCE AWAY FROM WHERE THE EVENTS ARE TAKING PLACE BUT THE POLICE HAVE MOVED THE PRESS BACK SUBSTANTIALLY.
