THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THAT'S NEXT ON A THURSDAY ON THE  WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FOR THIS CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK WHICH VIOLATES ALL PREVIOUS U.N.
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS AND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE SUPPORTS THAT SYRIA, THE SYRIAN REGIME ON ORDERS OF PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ATTACK.
THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF DESIRES.
THEY BACKED AWAY WHEN OBAMA WANTED TO RENEW THE 2001 AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE A FEW YEARS AGO.
THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD FOR A LONG TIME.
THE SYRIAN LEADER, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, BY ALL INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATION HAS MURDERED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE BY USING BARREL BOMBS AND ALL KINDS OF EXPLOSIONS THE LAST MANY YEARS.
AGAIN, ARE WE GOING TO DO IT WITH THE RUSSIANS OR NOT?
