THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
AMONG THE PRESIDENT'S SENIOR TEAM.
IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A BURY THE HATCHET SETTING.
YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE THAT REALLY BELIEVED THAT DONALD TRUMP REPRESENTED A VERY VERY SHORT BREAK WITH THE BUSH ERA FOREIGN POLICY AND THE REALITY IS THAT RIGHT EDITOR OF ONE RIGHT WING WEBSITE TWEETING I'M OFFICIALLY OFF THE TRUMP TRAIN.
CONSPIRACY THEORIST.
IT HAS DRIVEN CRITICAL STORIES OF THE WHITE HOUSE OF WHO'S UP AND WHO'S DOWN.
BUT THEY SEEM TO BE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER.
ON THE ONE HAND HE'S ATTACKED THE ASSAD REGIME AND HE'S FOLLOWING THROUGH THE COMMITMENT TO PUT MORE FORCES ON THE GROUND TO RID SYRIA OF ISIS.
QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS FOREIGN POLICY POSTURE, THE PRESIDENT'S MOST NATIONALISTIC SUPPORTERS AREN'T TOTALLY TURNING THEIR BACKS.
DASHING HOPES OF A NEW FRIENDLIER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN AND DONALD TRUMP.
AMERICA FIRST, AMERICA THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS HE RAILED AGAINST INTERVENTION AND THEN CAME HIS SYRIAN STRIKE AND THE NEAR IMMEDIATE BACKLASH FROM HIS BASE.
THE CURRENT POLICY SEEMS FULL OF CONTRADICTION EXPRESSING CONCERN FOR CIVILIAN SUFFERING IN SYRIA.
THE PRIME MINISTER WARNED ON FACEBOOK THAT WASHINGTON AND MOSCOW WERE JUST ON THE VERGE OF CONFLICT.
AMERICA FIRST.
THE PRESIDENT WAS AWARE OF THIS MEETING AND IS PLEASED WITH THE OUTCOME.
I KNOW TRUMP WAS AMERICA FIRST, BUT SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT.
ALL THIS JUST DAYS BEFORE SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON HEADS TO MOSCOW FOR MEETINGS WITH TOP OFFICIALS.
SEVERAL HOURS AT THE TRUMP GOLF RESORT NEAR HIS PALM BEACH HOME PRAISE FROM HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR GREAT MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN FROM THEIR ROLE ON THE STRIKE ON SYRIA.
AFTER THE STRIKE IN SYRIA SOME OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOST ARDENT SUPPORTERS ARE ASKING WHAT HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE CORE PRINCIPLES, THE CORNERSTONE TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.
MAKING SURE THAT THE AIR STRIKE SEEMS LIKE A BETRAYAL.
THINGS THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE SAYING AND THE RUSSIANS ARE DOING IS IN MANY RESPECTS FOR THEIR MISSILE STRIKES WERE WELCOMED AROUND THE WORLD, CRITICS ARE INCREASINGLY ASKING IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS A THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY.
