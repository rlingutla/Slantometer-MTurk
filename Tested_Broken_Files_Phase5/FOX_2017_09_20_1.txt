PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE HEAD OF FEMA ABOUT RESPONSE AND WE'LL WATCH FOR HURRICANE MARIA'S NEXT MONTH.
PUERTO RICO IS A PUERTO RICO -- POOR ISLAND TO BEGIN WITH.
KNOCKING OVER TREES, TOPPLING POWER LINES AND CAUSING SEVERE FLOODING.
SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOF DAMAGE.
WHAT IS THE MOST URGENT NEED?
FEMA HAS PREPOSITIONED HERE.
TO US?
IT'S NOT OVER YET.
BUT TUESDAY, A STORM OFF THE SHORE OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, SHEP.
IT'S A CATASTROPHIC STORM.
10% IS ALREADY WITHOUT POWER FOLLOWING HURRICANE IRMA WHICH DIDN'T HAVE A DIRECT HIT.
STORM, PUERTO RICO HAD A CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TENS OF BILLIONS IN DEBT.
SO OFFICIALS ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO REMAIN AT THEIR HOMES BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE YET TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSES.
ONE OF THE STRONGEST TO EVER HIT AMERICAN SOIL AND THE DESTRUCTION COULD BE WIDESPREAD.
ALSO IN THE HOTELS AND METRO AREA.
PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR SAYS PUERTO RICANS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AN EVENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE IN THEIR MODERN HISTORY.
PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL OF SAN JUAN ARE REPORTING WIDESPREAD FLOODING.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN PUERTO RICO DECLARED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD MEAN A LOT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS FLOWING INTO THE ISLAND, WHICH COULD BOOST THE ECONOMY AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.
THE WATER TEMPERATURES COME DOWN AS WELL.
WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE, IT GETS WORSE.
