INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN, INNOCENT BABIES -- BABIES, LITTLE BABIES -- WITH A CHEMICAL GAS THAT IS SO LETHAL.
THE UNITED STATES SEES YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AS A DISGRACE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.
TONIGHT, THE WORLD WATCHING PRESIDENT TRUMP.
I INHERITED A MESS.
THE PRESIDENT DECLARES SYRIA HAS CROSSED MORE THAN A RED LINE, THAT ASSAD HAS CROSSED SEVERAL LINES.
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY THIS IS VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA.
TERRIBLE.
THE WORLD IS A MESS.
IN 2013, THERE WERE ARRAY OF AIR STRIKES WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THEY CROSSED THE RED LINE.
WILL THE U.S. TAKE ACTION?
IF I COULD JUST QUICKLY ASK YOU IF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS CROSSES A RED LINE FOR YOU?
HERE A FATHER CLUTCHES HIS TWIN 9-MONTH-OLD BABIES, BOTH OF THEM KILLED.
INNOCENT CIVILIANS SUFFERING FROM THIS WEEK'S ATTACK, MORE THAN 80 DEAD.
AN ASSURANCE THAT HUMANITY MEANS NOTHING TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.
JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE ROSE GARDEN, HE SUGGESTED THERE SHOULD BE RETALIATION.
IT IS NOW MY RESPONSIBILITY.
AND AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SAID THE U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED.
WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS CONSISTENTLY FAILS IN ITS DUTY TO ACT COLLECTIVELY, THERE ARE TIMES WHERE WE ARE COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.
AND I AM FLEXIBLE.
TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, TALK OF A CHANGED SYRIAN POLICY.
