THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
APPARENTLY ADD A GREATER PACE THAN BEFORE, WITH NOBODY TO STOP THEM.
SCREEN LEFT, THE AIRSTRIKE ON THE SYRIAN AIRBASE IN RESPONSE TO THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.
WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE?
HE HAS SERIOUS BUSINESS TO GET DOWN TO.
REPORTER SHE WAS MICHAEL BLIN'S FLYNN'S DEPUTY, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO NOMINATE HER TO AMBASSADOR OF SINGAPORE, THAT WOULD BE A PROPORTION FOR HER, SHE JOINS STEVE BANNON AS SECOND OFFICIAL TO LEAVE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISE COUNCIL.
HE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAW.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, CONGRESS DECLARES WAR OR CREATE STATUTORY LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR USE OF FORCE.
THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER BIPARTISAN AND SAY WHAT WERE GOING TO DO.
YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS DONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT PART OF DOMESTIC POLICY.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYRIA, IT'S A POWDER CAKE, ANYTHING THAT I'M AWARE OF SINCE WORLD WAR II YOU HAVE TURKEY, US, ISRAEL, RUSSIA, OTHERS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL.
THAT THE NEXT ONE QUESTION.
IT IS STEAMING TOWARD THE KOREAN PENINSULA TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE.
OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY AS A PRESIDENT THAT HE OR SHE SEE SOMETHING AS A THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY TOWARD TROOPS AND INTEREST THEY HAVE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ASK.

SECONDLY WE DON'T SEE A PEACEFUL SYRIA WITH ASSAD IN DPLSM THEREE MOVE TOWARD A POLITICAL SOLUTION, AT END OF THE DAY THIS IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION.
YOU HEARD THAT FATHER IN SYRIA WHO LOST HIS TWINS, AMERICA DO MORE THAN ONE STRIKE.
I'LL TALK WITH ONE LAW MAKER WHO BACKS THE PRESIDENT ON SYRIA, BUT SAID HOW HE JUSTIFIED IT LEGALLY WAS FLAWED.
WHEN YOU HAVE DIPLOMACY THAT THE WORLD AGREES WITH YOU HAVE TO BACK IT UP WITH FORCE.
