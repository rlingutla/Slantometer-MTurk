OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
HOUSES AND CARS PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
SHE WORKS AT A DAYCARE CENTER, AND WHEN THE STORM HIT, IT WAS UP TO HER TO KEEP SMALL CHILDREN CALM AND SAFE, AND HERE'S WHAT SHE TOLD US.
EARLIER, MELISSA NEWTON SPOKE ABOUT THE DEVASTATION SHE SAW WHEN SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE HER DOOR.
NOW, I WANT TO CHECK BACK IN WITH ABC'S METEOROLOGIST JINKER ZEE FOR A MOMENT.
HOW MANY MORE PATIENTS CAN YOU RECEIVE?
AND OF COURSE SO DANGEROUS.
YOU SEE MAJOR CEMENT CONSTRUCTION ALSO BEING DAMAGED.
WE MET ONE WOMAN LOOKING FOR HER NIECE.
ONE IN SERIOUS AND THE OTHERS ARE FAIR OR GOOD.
I SAW A COUPLE BEFORE ME MOVED TO A DIFFERENT AREA.
IT'S DEVASTATING.
ONE WOMAN TOLD US, WE JUST WANT TO FIND OUR OWN THINGS BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.
ANY OF YOUR CHILDREN FROM THOSE SCHOOLS, AND WHAT ABOUT THEIR CONDITION?
ANOTHER AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS TORNADO IS ON THE RADAR, WHEN IT FIRST POPPED OUT IN NEWCASTLE, BY THE WAY, THIS IS BEING CALLED THE NEWCASTLE-MOORE TORNADO, BUT WHEN IT DROPPED DOWN, IT WAS JUST A FINGER OF A TORNADO, BARELY A FUNNEL CLOUD.
SHE KNEW SHE WAS OKAY, BUT STILL HADN'T BEEN RE-UNITED.
SUDDENLY SKIES ARE DARK AS MIDNIGHT AS THE STORM MOVERS IN.
AND COMING UP NEXT HERE, OTHER FAMILIES SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD FROM THE STORM ZONE, HOW ONE WOMAN COMFORTED A LOT OF SMALL CHILDREN AS THE TORNADO WAS BEARING DOWN.
WE WERE LESS THAN A MILE FROM IT WHEN IT HIT THE SCHOOL, AND YOU COULD SEE THE EXPLOSION AND THE DEBRIS WHEN IT HIT THAT LARGE STONE STRUCTURE.
YOU CAN SEE THE TORNADO FILLING THE SKY.
SO THIS SEARCH AND RESCUE IN THIS IMMENSE OF A DISASTER WILL TAKE DAYS BEFORE THERE'S A FINAL TOLL OF THE DEAD, AND ALL OF THE LIVING ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.
