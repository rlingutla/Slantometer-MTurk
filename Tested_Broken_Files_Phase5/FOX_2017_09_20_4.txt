INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WHAT DO YOU KNOW FROM THE NEIGHBORHOODS?
SO IT'S REALLY SCARY.
WE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF HURRICANE BEFORE.
I'M STILL HAVING HEAVY WINDS IN MY OWN HOUSE.
THAT SAID, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE.
WE RECEIVED BETWEEN 12 TO 35 INCHES OF RAIN DURING THIS DAY.
SHE SAID THE WINDS ARE LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE.
WE'RE ALSO GETTING A LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION ON THE SMALL ISLAND DOMINIQUE.
IF YOUR HOUSE IS MADE OF WOOD WITH A METAL ROOF, JUST GONE.
A HORRIBLE FORM.
WE ARE STILL HAVING WINDS MORE THAN 60 MILES PER HOUR.
NO LIGHTS, NO WAY TO GET HELP, NO IDEA WHETHER YOUR HOME WILL STAND UP OR FALL DOWN AROUND YOU.
I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO STEVE HARRIGAN WHO IS LIVE IN SAN JUAN FOR US THIS AFTERNOON.
WE'LL SEARCH AND RESCUE AND A LET'S GET TO RICK REICHMUTH IN THE EXTREME WEATHER CENTER, THIS IS AWFUL.
ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IS THAT THE RIVERS OVERFLOWED THEIR BANKS.
THE STORM ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF THE ISLAND WITH SUSTAINED WINDS OF 155 MILES AN HOUR.
ALL OF THEM GOING UP INCREDIBLY FAST.
THEY DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND SALUTE THE SAME FLAG.
AS YOU SAID, THERE'S FOUR MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS HERE.
THE GOAL IS LIFE SAFETY, LIFE SUSTAINING MISSIONS BY GETTING COMMODITIES IN.
