INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THOSE WHO DID SURVIVE GASPING FOR AIR.
WE ALSO SAW U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY HOLDING UP PICTURES TODAY SAYING, IF THE U.N.
AND IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE, AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED, THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.
ABDULLAH MADE IT CLEAR, THE WORLD IS LOOKING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.
TONIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR WHAT HE SAID.
AND I'M PROUD OF THAT FLEXIBILITY.
ON THE WORLD STAGE, THE PRESIDENT SAYS HIS POSITION ON ASSAD, ON SYRIA, HAS CHANGED AFTER SEEING THE IMAGES OF THE FAMILIES, THE CHILDREN, THE VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK.
I DO CHANGE.
AND AFTER ASSAD'S MASSIVE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN 2013, HE TWEETED "DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA, FIX U.S.A." ADDING, "IF YOU DO MANY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!"
I BELIEVE UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP WE WILL BE ABLE TO UNRAVEL THIS VERY COMPLICATED SITUATION.
IT IS A TERRIBLE AFFRONT TO HUMANITY, I CAN TELL YOU.
DO THEY JUST WANT TO PUNISH OR DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF BASHAR AL ASSAD?
BIG IMPACT.
MANY, MANY LINES.
THE PRESIDENT FIRMLY CONDEMNED THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA, PLACING THE BLAMING -- BLAME SQUARELY ON THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.
I NOW HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND I WILL HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND CARRY IT VERY PROUDLY, I WILL TELL YOU THAT.
BUT MOST OF THOSE CHEMICAL WEAPONS, THE STOCKPILES, ARE GONE SO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED HERE WERE HIDDEN.
PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT ACKNOWLEDGES IT'S NOW HIS CHALLENGE TO SOLVE.
THEY STILL HAD THAT INTELLIGENCE.
HOW HE'LL HANDLE THIS, WILL THE U.S. ACT?
