INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THAT 1999 TORNADO TOOK DON BESSINGER'S FENCE.
HERE IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA, THE EXPRESSION "THIS HARD LAND" COMES TO MIND, AND IT'S TRUE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
THE DAMAGE.
IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR, AND IT -- JUST GLASS AND DEBRIS STARTED SLAMMING ON US.
WITH SHELTERS.
NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER EVENT THAT CAUSED ALL THIS.
A REINFORCED BOX ALMOST LIKE A BANK VAULT BUT BUILT TO FEMA TORNADO STANDARDS, BUT THEY COST 8,000 TO $10,000 EACH.
LET'S USE THIS HOUSE AS AN EXAMPLE.
IT WAS ON THE GROUND FOR 40 MINUTES.
WE MENTIONED SEVEN DIFFERENT STATES HAVE WATCHES AND WARNINGS.
THIS IS HOME.
THERE IT IS.
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A TORNADO THIS SIZE AND THIS MANY KIDS HURT, MISSING AND LOST THEIR LIVES TO REALIZE THAT THEY NEED UNDERGROUND SHELTERS.
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYONE COULD SURVIVE IN THIS.
THAT SHE'S ALIVE.
THE BASE OF THIS STORM NOW CONFIRMED TO BE AT ITS WIDEST POINT, 1.3 MILES WIDE ON THE GROUND.
WE'RE SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY, AND TODAY WE HAD OUR SUSPICIONS AND WORST FEARS REALIZED.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TONIGHT IS THUNDERSTORMS ALL THE WAY REALLY FROM NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT ON DOWN THROUGH TENNESSEE.
DEVASTATING TORNADO, AND SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING, WHY AREN'T THERE MORE BASEMENTS IN THE VERY PLACE THEY NEED THEM MOST, TORNADO ALLEY, AND WHY AREN'T THERE MORE TORNADO SHELTERS?
I HAVE BLOOD IN MY HAIR FROM MY FRIEND.
