INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
JULIE SENATOR RAND PAUL AND A CRITIC OF PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPRESSING DOUBT OF U.S. STRIKE ON SYRIA SAYING THE PRESIDENT SHOULD OBEY THE CONSTITUTION AND ASK OR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BEFORE USING MILITARY ACTION.
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KEEPS PRESSURE ON THE SYRIAN REGIME.
AND THEN OF COURSE IS A NONINTERVENTIONIST.
"FOX NEWS" HAS LEARNED THE U.S. MILITARY IS RAMPING UP EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 1000 AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA OR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE COALITION IS CUT BACK ON SOME OF ITS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ISIS THERE BECAUSE U.S. AIR FORCE F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER JETS FROM THE AIRBASE IN TURKEY NOT FAR FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER 
THE TWO BIG TAKEAWAYS THERE ARE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATING WHAT THE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI HALEY SAID YESTERDAY, THAT THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION IF NECESSARY IF ASSAD DOES NOT STOP THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACKS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THEN IT ALSO, THEY SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES HE CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WITHOUT RECEIVING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL TO DO SO.
DEMOLISHED AND RUNWAYS DAMAGE THE SYRIAN FORCES ARE LASHING OUT AT REBEL TARGETS.
JULIE TODAY AN OLD ARCH ENEMY OF THE ASSAD REGIME TURKISH FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THIS EARLY TODAY IN TURKEY.
ATROCITY IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO DISOBEY THE CONSTITUTION.
AMERICAN TOMAHAWK MISSILES NEARLY LEVELING A SYRIAN AIRBASE HANGER.
THE U.S. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTION AS NECESSARY AND APPROPRIATE TO FURTHER ITS IMPORTANT NATIONAL INTERESTS.
THE PLAN WILL BE THERE BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAR COME IS GOING TO BE DIPLOMACY.
ATTACK APPARENTLY HAS NOT SLOWED SYRIA DOWN MUCH.
THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS EVOLVE INTO WHAT?
THEY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. ACTION IN SYRIA IS THE SAUDIS CALLING IT A COURAGEOUS DECISION BUT REFLECTING A REGION OVER SYRIA IRANIAN PRESIDENT A STRONG ALLY OF ASSAD HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF U.S. DECISION.
1939 TURKEY ANNEXED LAND AT NORTHWEST AREA WHICH TODAY IS TURKEY'S SOUTHERNMOST PROVINCE.
INTERVENTION AS APPROPRIATE.
I WOULD ARGUE FOR A NO-FLY ZONE AND ARMING AND TRAINING THE FREE SYRIAN ARMY.
I AM SURE A LOT OF FOLKS ON CAPITOL HILL WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT.
RUSSIA KEEPS UP A STRONG MILITARY PRESENCE ACTIVELY ASSISTING THE ASSAD REGIME IN THE COMPANY.
HE BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD NOT INTERVENE IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE ARGUED AGAINST THE STRIKE.
