INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IN SOME CASES IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ADDRESSES.
I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN GET TO THAT NOW.
THIS IS -- THIS IS TERRIBLE.
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE IT, BUT THIS IS, I THINK YOU WILL AGREE, THE MOST INTENSE WEATHER SYSTEM THE EARTH CAN PRODUCE.
AGAIN, RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY KIDS WERE INSIDE OR ARE STILL INSIDE.
WE HAVE A LATE UPDATE FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
WE BELIEVE ABOUT A MILE-WIDE TORNADO HAS JUST LEVELLED THE COMMUNITIES IN MOORE.
THEY WILL DIVIDE UP THE COMMUNITY INTO GRIDS.
SOME OF THE CONCRETE WALLS, BRICK WALLS ARE STANDING.
THESE ARE WELL BUILT FRAME HOMES, BRICK HOMES.
AT LEAST SIX CHILDREN HAVE DROWNED IN THE BASEMENT.
THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION YOU HAVE.
JANET, I DID CEE LO CALL -- E SEE LOCAL OFFICIALS TELLING PEOPLE TO TRY TEXTING.
ALL WE KNOW IS THE DEATH TOLL WILL RISE.
WHEN WE COME BACK, WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST MIKE SEIDEL HAS COME ACROSS A FAIRLY GRIM SCENE THERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, TONIGHT.   I HAD TO HOLD ONTO THE WALL TO KEEP MYSELF SAFE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO FLY AWAY IN THE TORNADO.
TONIGHT, A MASSIVE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS IS JUST GETTING UNDER WAY.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN DESTRUCTION SO TOTAL OVER SUCH AN EXPANSIVE THERE A QUESTION IN YOUR MIND SINCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS MORE THAN ANYBODY ON THE TALENT THAT THIS TORNADO WILL NOT BE AN EF-5?
THE TORNADO CAME THROUGH LIKE A BUZZ SAW AND SCRAPED THE EARTH CLEAN.
NO.
AS YOU MENTIONED, THE EF-5 TORNADO THAT WENT THROUGH THERE, JUST NORTH OF WHERE THIS ONE TRACKED ACROSS THE CITY OF MOORE.
