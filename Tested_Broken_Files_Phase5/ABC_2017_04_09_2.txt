PRESIDENT TRUMP RETURNING TO THE WHITE HOUSE FROM MAR-A-LAGO, HIS SYRIA AIR STRIKES FRONT AND CENTER IN THE FOREIGN POLICY DEBATE.
DAVID WRIGHT WITH THE SIMMERING NEW TENSIONS, AND THE THREATENING STATEMENT TONIGHT.
IT'S A DELICATE DANCE AT THIS POINT.
ACCUSATIONS THAT AMERICA CROSSED RED LINES, AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE HEADS TO MOSCOW.

BUT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE YET TO CRITICIZE EACH OTHER.
THE COMMANDERS THREATEN TO RETALIATE AGAINST ANY FUTURE U.S. MILITARY ACTIONS.
AND RUSSIA NOW TODAY, AN OMINOUS WARNING FROM MILITARY COMMANDERS DEFENDING THE ASSAD REGIME, ECHOING THE PRESIDENT'S OWN LANGUAGE.
