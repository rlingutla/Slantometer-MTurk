THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.
WE GOT THIS VIDEO IN TODAY OF THE INCEPTION OF THE TORNADO.
ALL THE NEW SCHOOLS THAT ARE BUILT HAVE SAFE ROOMS.
IT'S A MILE RIGHT THERE.
WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK EVERY SCHOOL IN OKLAHOMA SHOULD HAVE AN UNDERGROUND SHELTER.
REMINISCENT OF THAT TAKEN BY A RECORD-SETTING TORNADO THAT HIT HERE 14 YEARS AGO.
FOREVER.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY -- FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WE SHOULD PROBABLY EMPHASIZE IN PLAIN ENGLISH, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING RICH HERE.
I SAID, GOD PLEASE DON'T TAKE DOWN ON THEM, BUT THE WALLS STILL STOOD.
THIS IS A WORKING CLASS TOWN.
WELL, WE'RE HAPPY TO WELCOME MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE WITH US TONIGHT.
A LOT OF US WOKE UP THIS MORNING TO SEE IT DOWNGRADED TO 24.

THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND OBVIOUSLY A BIG THING THEY NEED TO ADDRESS.

THIS IS THE FRONT OF PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
OH, MY GOD!
