INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
KEY PRESIDENTIAL AIDES ARE SPLIT OF HOW TO RESPOND.
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CANNOT DO ANYTHING EXCEPT MEETING AND PROMISING.
AND IT IS THE PUBLIC PLEDGE COUPLED WITH THE HORRIFIC PICTURES THAT PROMPTED SENIOR OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER SPECIFIC MILITARY RESPONSES, EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT PREACHES CAUTION.
HE SAYS THE WORLD IS IGNORING THEM.
FEARING FOR HIS OWN LIFE, HE WOULD NOT GO ON CAMERA.
A DOCTOR ON THE FRONT LINES THERE TELLING US WHAT HE SAYS IS REALLY GOING ON.
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES THAT MILITARY OPTION LOOK LIKE?
LOOKS LIKE IN SOME FORM.
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND, SECOND, THEY NEED TO HAVE A LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY INITIALLY AGGRESSIVE AND SOFTENED UNTIL THE LATEST PICTURES EMERGED AND TODAY IS ADVOCATING AN AGGRESSIVE RESPONSE.
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A SHAME ON THE FACE OF HUMANITY.
RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT SAID REPEATEDLY THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY BASHAR AL ASSAD WOULD CROSS THE RED LINE.
THERE IS WORD TONIGHT THE PENTAGON IS DRAWING UP MILITARY OPTIONS TO RESPOND TO THIS WEEK'S ATROCITIES IN SYRIA, AS THE WHITE HOUSE COMES UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO ACT.
READY TO STRIKE?
WHAT IS ON THE TABLE, LIMITED AIR STRIKES, MOST LIKELY CRUISE MISSILES LAUNCHED FROM NAVY DESTROYERS TARGETING KEY ASSAD MILITARY COMMAND POSTS AND WHILE THE U.S. AND WHILE THE U.S. IS STILL GATHERING EVIDENCE, EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.
DEMPSEY EXPRESSED RELUCTANCE.
CHUCK, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN.
CONSIDERING A VERY NARROW RANGE OF MILITARY OPTIONS.
BUT IF HE WANTS REGIME CHANGE, WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT EASILY.
THIS IS QUITE POWERFUL AND CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN FAKED.
