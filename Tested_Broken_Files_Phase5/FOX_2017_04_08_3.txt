INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH AND THAT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE.
IS DOING IT ON HIS OWN.
WHAT A CHAR AL-ASSAD DID IS A WAR CRIME.
PROTESTERS LINING THE STREETS OF DAMASCUS CALLING THE ATTACK AND AGGRESSION AGAINST THE ENTIRE NATION BUT RUSSIA REMAINS THE MOST CRITICAL.
THEIR PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON PLANNING THIS SINCE 2003.
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER.
HIS ADMINISTRATION HOSTING THE MINISTER OF CHINA A SUCCESSFUL VOTE ON HIS SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AND OF COURSE THE MISSILE STRIKE AGAINST SYRIA 
SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS HELPED
WHAT ELSE WOULD I GUESS WE LIKE TO SEE AS FAR AS AIRSTRIKES INTO SYRIA, WHAT MORE THEY TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THE GLOBAL REACTION POURS IN?
IT ALSO SAYS IT'S A SETBACK FOR RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. AND MAY HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE REGION.
THAT'S RIGHT IN OFFICIALS I'VE SPOKEN TODAY SAID NOT TO EXPECT ANY MORE AIRSTRIKES ON THE ASSAD REGIME ANYTIME SOON.
U.S. OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER RUSSIA MAY HAVE SUPPORTED US.
AS WAS ALLUDED TO THIS WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED MORE PLANTS TO STRIKE THE ASSAD REGIME.
RESPONSE OF THE VERY FIRST PLACE.
THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE JOHN STRIKE WAS A GOOD START BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE.
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING TO CONTINUE ON WITH HIS AMERICA FIRST THEME INSTEAD OF COUNTRIES LIKE SYRIA OR IS HE BECOMING A BIT MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT HE WARNED AGAINST ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST CONTINUE TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQA AND STOP THIS FLOW THAT IS COMING OUT OF RAQQA AND BEING SENT TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED STATES TO PREVENT TERROR.
A RUSSIAN DRONES SEEN OVER A HOSPITAL WHERE VICTIMS OF TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK WERE TAKEN AND FIVE HOURS LATER RUSSIAN AND SYRIAN JETS BOMBED IT IN AN EFFORT TO KILL MORE PEOPLE AND DESTROY THE EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
IT IS AN ATROCITY.
