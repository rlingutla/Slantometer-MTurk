THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DEVASTATION THAT HURRICANE IRMA HAS JUST LEFT BEHIND.
ROADS, BRIDGES AND MANY HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN HIT DIRECTLY BY THIS HURRICANE.
THIS WILL COMPOUND THE PROBLEMS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH THIS THING?
SAYING I WANT TO HELP BUT NOT SURE HOW TO DO IT, WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM?
THEY EXPERIENCED SOME DAMAGE TO HOSPITALS, WHICH WERE ALREADY WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS.
I'M SPEAKING WITH YOU.
THEY HAVE 100% OF THE POWER OFF.
GONZALEZ COLON, THERE'S SO MANY PUERTO RICANS, THERE'S SO MANY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AREA OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITOL.
SHE'S PUERTO RICO'S RESIDENT COMMISSIONER.
UNFORTUNATELY, CUTTING A CROSS DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ISLAND.
STEVE, LOOKS LIKE THINGS HAVE CALMED DOWN.
THESE GUYS BACK HERE ARE INCREDIBLY DEDICATED.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
THE PRESIDENT REMAINS VERY ENGAGED AND HIS MESSAGE IS TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE.
THE HOUSE JUST TREMBLED DURING THIS SITUATION.
THEN ONCE WE WORK WITH THE GOVERNORS, THERE WILL BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT VOLUNTEER AND DONATIONS TO EACH ONE OF THE TERRITORIES.
WE SIGNED UP FOR THIS JOB AND DEDICATED TO HELPING THE GOVERNORS ACHIEVE THEIR RESPONSE GOALS AND HELP PEOPLE.
OF COURSE, THE WHOLE ISLAND IS WITHOUT POWER.
THEN IT CONTINUES TO PULL TO THE NORTH.
