OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
WE JUST HEARD AMBASSADOR HALEY SAY, AT TIMES WE'RE QUOTE, COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.
DOESN'T ACT THE U.S. MAY HAVE TO.
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF CHAIRED A MEETING OF HIS NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.
WE DON'T KNOW.
MORE THAN 80 MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN DYING.
THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE ASSAD REGIME CANNOT BE TOLERATED.
TWEETING "SYRIA IS NOT OUR PROBLEM" WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA PROPOSED PROTECTING CIVILIANS.
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.
WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA HAS CHANGED.
BUT NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES HAVE CHANGED HIS VIEWS ON THE ASSAD REGIME.
AND AS WE HEARD, THEY MET WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM TODAY.
