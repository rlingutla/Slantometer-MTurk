OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
THAT'S CENTRAL TIME.
WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE HONEST.
OF PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
WATCH THE TIME.
YOU CAN SEE SEARCH AND RESCUE CREWS CONTINUING TO TREAT THE KIDS THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL.
WE COULDN'T REACH FOR IT.
AGAIN, I TOLD YOU A FEW MINUTES I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF KIDS THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL AT THE TIME.
ALL YOU SEE IS CONCRETE SLABS.
TO BE HONEST.
YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING WELL INTO THE NIGHT.
THERE IS STILL GAS.
YOU CAN SEE AGAIN -- WE HAVE SAID IT BEFORE FROM THE AIR -- THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.
HE SAID THE TEACHERS TOOK ALL THE SCHOOL KIDS INTO THE MIDDLE, THE CENTER PART OF THE SCHOOL, PUT THEM ON INTERIOR WALLS AND AS FAR AS HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE TEACHER AND STUDENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR.
LIVE PICTURES COMING INTO US TONIGHT.
WIND EASILY OVER 200 MILES PER HOUR.
THEY REPORT COMMUTES OF TWO OR THREE HOURS TO GET 12 OR 14 MILES.
IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT WE SAW AFTER KATRINA WHEN THE 25-FOOT STORM SURGE HIT THE COAST.
THERE WAS STILL DAYLIGHT THERE.
FROM THE AIR, IT IS HARD TO KNOW AT TIMES JUST WHAT IT IS WE ARE LOOKING AT.
THEY WERE LITERALLY HUGGING THE WALLS OF THE INTERIOR HALLWAYS AS THAT TORNADO WENT OVERHEAD, TRYING TO SURVIVE.
