PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
JESSE WELLS FOR KFOR FOR THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE WE MAY HAVE A VERY, VERY GRIM SITUATION AS THE SEARCH AND RESCUE GOES ON.
HER NEIGHBORS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.
BUT SO FAR THE STATE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THE INITIAL DEATH TOLL IS 37 FROM THIS ONE TORNADO.
WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND -- WE HAD A LONG WIND-UP ON SEVERE WEATHER.
MIKE, EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE UNABLE TO FIND ADDRESSES, UNABLE TO LOCATE WHERE THEY ONCE LIVED.
IT'S TOTAL DEVASTATION.
PEOPLE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE ARE STRUGGLING IN THAT WAY AS WELL.
A MASSIVE TORNADO JUST OUTSIDE OKLAHOMA CITY.
OUR FRIENDS AT KFOR, THE MEDICAL EXAMINER PUTTING THE EARLY DEATH TOLL AT 37 SOULS TONIGHT.
YOU JUST CAN'T FIND ADDRESSES OUT HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE.
ANOTHER BREAK.
THEY WERE BEING PROTECTED BY SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT WORKED IN THIS SCHOOL BUILDING.
IT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY LIVED.
IT'S TOTALLY DESTROYED.
ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE REPORT THAT MANY SCHOOL CHILDREN MAY HAVE BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE ONE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
DON'T LOSE YOUR LIFE.
BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EITHER AN F4 OR F5, THE STRONGEST INTENSITY ON EARTH, IT WAS OVER A MILE WIDE AT THE BASE OF THE STORM.
THIS THING HASN'T DECREASED IN SIZE ANY.
SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL STILL GO THROUGH THE BUILDING THROUGH NIGHT, WE ARE TOLD BY FIREFIGHTERS, TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OKAY.
