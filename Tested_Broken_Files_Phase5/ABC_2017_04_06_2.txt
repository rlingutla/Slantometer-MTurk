THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
SECRETARY OF STATE, REX TILLERSON, A MAN OF FEW WORDS SINCE TAKING OFFICE, TONIGHT WITH HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL YET, FOCUSING ON SYRIA'S PRESIDENT.
AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING SYRIAN LEADER BASHAR AL ASSAD, SAID TODAY SUPPORT FOR ASSAD NOT UNCONDITIONAL, BUT URGING CAUTION.
THIS WEEK FROM SYRIA PUT A LIE TO THE SYRIAN AND USA CLAIMS THAT THE COUNTRY'S STOCKPILE OF SARIN GAS AND OTHER CHEMICAL WEAPONS HAD BEEN DESTROYED.
HIT SYRIAN AIRFIELDS TO GROUND ASSAD'S AIR FORCE.
SIR, DOES ASSAD HAVE TO GO?
PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP HAD LONG ARGUED AGAINST ACTION IN SYRIA, REPEATEDLY TWEETING ABOUT IT.
I HAVEN'T, BUT AT SOME POINT I MAY.
WE DO, DAVID, AND THAT'S A REAL CONCERN.
I THINK WHAT ASSAD DID IS TERRIBLE.
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE TARGET?
THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYING, "SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN" AFTER THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.
TODAY HE SIGNALED HE'S WEIGHING MILITARY ACTION.
OBAMA WEIGHED MILITARY ACTION BEFORE.
BRIAN, WE SHOULD CAUTION, WE DON'T KNOW ANY ACTION IF ANY AT ALL IS GOING TO BE TAKEN TONIGHT.
DO YOU THINK THAT ASSAD SHOULD LEAVE POWER IN SYRIA?
BACK IN 2013, AFTER A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS WEIGHING MILITARY ACTION, TRUMP TWEETING, "DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA.
TONIGHT, HE IS SIGNALING HIS STANCE HAS CHANGED.
MARTHA, AS YOU BEEN REPORTING WE HAVE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS THERE IN RECENT WEEKS, WE LEARNED OF HUNDREDS BEING SENT INTO SYRIA.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?
ASSAD'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN CLEARLY, AND WITH THE ACTS HE HAS TAKEN, IT WOULD SEEM THERE IS NO ROLE FOR HIM TO GOVERN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.
