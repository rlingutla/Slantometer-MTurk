INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT.
BASICALLY JUST A WAR ZONE.
SHE SAID IT WAS JUST OKAY.
SOME HOMES COMPLETELY GONE.
FROM THE SKY, YOU CAN SEE IT'S HOUSE AFTER HOUSE AFTER HOUSE IN NEIGHBORHOODS.
THERE ARE TWO BY FOURS GOING THROUGH PEOPLE'S ROOFS LIKE PROJECTILE OBJECTS.
CAN YOU TELL ME, IN THAT CLOSET, WHAT WAS YOUR TEACHER TELLING YOU AS SHE PUT HER HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD AND HELD YOU CLOSE?
MY MOM WAS FLIPPING OUT.
BY THE DESTRUCTIVE TORNADO THAT WREAKED HAVOC FOR ALMOST AN HOUR.
AT LEAST 100 INJURED OR BEING FREETED IN HOSPITALS.
HOUSES GROUND TO SPLINTERS.
AND TONIGHT AN OUTBREAK OF MORE THAN 50 TWISTERS HAS TAKEN LIVES AND FLATTENED HOMES.
QUITE A TEACHER, QUITE A WOMAN.
UM, WELL, I WAS IN MY BUILDING.
AS THOSE FIRES ERUPED.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT STREET WAS TURNING ON TO WALK TO MY HOUSE.
IT WAS JUST THE STORM THAT DID THAT DAMAGE.
THEN YOU LOOK AT MAJOR CONSTRUCTION.
THERE WAS ONLY SIX KIDS.
THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT SAY ON THE GROUND, THIS TORNADO WAS ABOUT TWO MILES WIDE.
