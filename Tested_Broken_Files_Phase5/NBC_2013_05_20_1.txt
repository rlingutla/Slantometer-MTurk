INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT WILL BE MONTHS BEFORE THE BELONGING, SOME MILES AWAY.
YOU LOOK AT THE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION THERE AND THE SMALL FIGURES OF THE RESCUERS WORKING FRANTICALLY AND WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?
TREES DEBARKED.
WE ARE IN FOR A LONG MARCH OF SADNESS AS THE NEWS AND THE NUMBERS EMERGE FROM MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
STRUCTURES BROKEN INTO PIECES, UNRECOGNIZABLE AND TOSSED AS DEBRIS DOWNWIND.
THE FAMILY FARM WHERE A NUMBER OF HORSES PERISHED AS WELL IN THIS TORNADO.
THEY ARE MANGLED BEYOND BELIEF.
AT LEAST IT STRUCK DURING THE DAY AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
WE HAD TO PULL A CAR OUT OF THE FRONT HALLWAY OFF A TEACHER.
OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE DAYLIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LADY'S NAME IS BUT SHE HAD THREE LITTLE KIDS UNDERNEATH HER.
THE INFORMATION IS VERY SPARSE DOWN HERE.
YEAH.
IT JUST INTENSIFIED TO ITS WORST AT THE TIME THAT IT CROSSED NEAR THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEN MOVED ACROSS I-35 AND WEAKENED AS IT WENT ON THROUGH MOORE.
BUT THIS WHOLE AREA RIGHT HERE, GUYS, IT'S COMPLETELY DESTROYED.
IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE THIS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT, HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.
IN FACT, I DOUBT IT WAS.
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S BEEN FLATTENED.
OH, MY GOD.
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CARS THAT WERE THROWN INTO THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.
