INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IN TERMS OF ANY KIND OF MUNITIONS THAT ASSAD NEEDS, AS POINTED OUT, HE DOESN'T NEED MUCH IN THE WAY OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE TACTICS HE'S EMPLOYING.
LET'S FACE IT.
WE JUST LEARNED THAT THAT HOTLINE SET UP BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN AND U.S. MILITARY TO PREVENT MILITARY MISHAPS IN SYRIA, THAT IS BEING SHUT DOWN BY THE RUSSIANS.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE VIOLATION OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS PARTICULARLY, IT IS A VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.
SHOULD THE PRESIDENT HAVE CONSULTED CONGRESS?
QUOTING HERE "THE LAST REMAINING ELECTION FOG HAS LIFT.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE RUSSIAN SHIP IS STAYING IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS.
THIS IS AN ACTION THAT CANNOT BE TOLERATED.
YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CONTACTS.
I DON'T THINK OUR MILITARY LEADERS ARE ALL THAT CONCERNED ABOUT IT.
THE U.S. NAVY FIRING 60 TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILES FROM TWO WAR SHIPS.
IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO MORE, THAT IT USE THEIR OWN BOMBERS.
WE ALL NEED TO STOP AND TRY TO FIGHT TOGETHER TO PREVENT THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT SYRIA HAS BEGUN.
THE STRIKES HITTING OVERNIGHT IN SYRIA.
I HOPE WE CAN START THE COOPERATI COOPERATION.
A PRIVATE COMPANY.
THAT AS WE GET WORD THAT A RUSSIAN WARSHIP IS HEADED TOWARD THE TWO UNITED STATES NAVY DESTROYERS USED IN THE STRIKES ON SYRIA.
AND THE BLUSTER FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN AND HIS SPOKESPEOPLE?
THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS OUTLAWED INTERNATIONALLY.
IT DOESN'T TELL US WHAT MR. TRUMP MIGHT DO NEXT.
