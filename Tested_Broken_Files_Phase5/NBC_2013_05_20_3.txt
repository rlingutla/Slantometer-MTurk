INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU LOOK AT THE PURPLE HERE, THAT'S THE TORNADO INTENSI INTENSIFYING.
WE ARE WITH DR. GREG FORBES, AN EXPERT IN SURVEYING DAMAGE.
THE LIFETIME OF THE TORNADO, BRIAN, WAS ONLY ABOUT 40 MINUTES AND THE CORE PEAK TIME WAS ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND IT WAS IN THAT PERIOD IN THE POPULATED PART OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA, SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY, THAT THE STORM PEAKED OVER TOP OF WHERE THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS AND WHERE A WELL KNOWN HORSE BARN IS THERE SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY.
IT WAS IN THIS SAME TOWN -- MOORE, OKLAHOMA -- BACK IN 1999 WHEN THE HIGHEST EVER TORNADO WINDS WERE RECORDED, 302 MILES AN HOUR.
AS DR. FORBES MENTIONED, AND HE'S THE EXPERT, BUT THIS HAS TO BE EF-5 DAMAGE.
AGAIN, EARLY PICTURES FROM MOORE SHOW SCHOOL CHILDREN STAGGERING INTO THE ARMS OF TEACHERS AND PARENTS.
BECAUSE OF THE STORM 14 YEARS AGO.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
OH, MY GOODNESS.
WE PROBABLY WALKED A MILE AND A HALF.
WE COULD BE IN FOR SOME DARK HOURS AND DARK DAYS AHEAD FOR THAT COMMUNITY AS THEY COME TO GRIPS WITH WHAT'S BEEN LOST HERE.
THAT'S WHERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
IT HAS BEEN HARD TO LISTEN TO, BUT LOCAL REPORTERS HAVE BEEN BREAKING UP ON THE AIR TODAY, OVERCOME WITH EMOTION BECAUSE, AFTER ALL, THEY ARE COVERING THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MOORE HAS BASICALLY PARALYZED EVERYTHING NEAR AND AROUND IT.
WE HATE TO COME TO YOU WITH.
OH, MY.
IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR AND JUST GLASS AND DEBRIS STARTED SLAMMING ON US.
WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME HERE IS THEM ESTABLISHING A COMMAND POST AT THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
MOST OF THE WALLS COLLAPSED.
NOTHING WAS LEFT EXCEPT BIG TREES AND STEEL GIRDERS.
