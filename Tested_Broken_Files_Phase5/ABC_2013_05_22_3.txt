THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
OH, MY GOD!
SHE SAID SHE'LL CHERISH THIS PHOTO.
MILE IN FRONT OF SUNDAY'S VIOLENT STORM, WATCHING YET ANOTHER TORNADO PLOW THROUGH RED DIRT AND THE HOUSES BUILT ON IT, I SILENTLY WONDERED "WHY DO I LIVE HERE?"
IT'S ALMOST OVER.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE SEE WHAT STUDENTS SAW HUDDLED IN THAT BATHROOM.
♪ CAN YOU HEAR THIS SONG ♪ THE OKLAHOMA STRONG NEWS.
STUDENTS TELL HER, I HATE THIS.
AMONG THE ONLY WALL STANDING, THAT BRICK WALL TO THE BATHROOM WHERE HER CLASS WAS SAVED.
THIS IS THE MOMENT THE MONSTROUS TORNADO HIT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY.
AND THE 1995 OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.
THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE THEIR POSSESSIONS.
AND HE FINDS HER ALIVE.
IT'S ALMOST OVER.
EVEN NEWCOMERS LIKE NBA STAR KEVIN DURANT TAKE PRIDE IN OKIE RESILIENCE.
SAM, THERE'S DADDY.
IT'S ALMOST OVER.
THE O WORD WAS EQUIVALENT TO A DUST BOWL.
ARRIVES.
HER SON SAM, A FIRST GRADER, HER DAUGHTER MARIE IN FOURTH.
