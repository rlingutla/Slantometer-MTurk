OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED STATES WILL BECOME FOR ENGAGED IN THE CONFLICT?
I WATCHED ATTACK ADMINISTRATIONS SAYING WE WILL ATTACK SUCH AND SUCH A DAY AND SUCH AND SUCH AN HOUR.
THE SYRIAN REGIME IS BACKED BY THE RUSSIANS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED, HE'S BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO FIRE THE U.S.
ONE TO KNOW IF THIS IS A SIGNAL OF A MILITARY RESPOND THE U.S.
WHEN YOU HAVE A REGIME CHANGE, YOU WIND UP IN A WORSE SPOT THAN YOU DID BEFORE EXACTING A CHANGE AT THE TOP.
IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE SYRIAN REGIMES TO USE BARREL BOMBS TO KILL BABIES IN THEIR BEDS BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN WHAT IS UNQUESTIONABLY A SERIES OF WAR CRIMES.
I AGREE WITH THAT 100%.
THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH THEM AS ARE IRANIANS.
PRIORITY TO GET RID OF ASSAD IN SYRIA, THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR SHIFT.
WHEN HE DIDN'T CROSS THAT RED LINE AFTER MAKING THE THREAT, THAT SET US BACK A LONG WAYS NOT ONLY IN SYRIA BUT IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.
THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO THINK THIS THROUGH THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE TOUGH ON ASSAD AND KNOW IT'S TOUGH TO OVERTHROW HIM.
IT HASN'T WORKED.
HE ALSO TWEETED -- SAYS HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.
PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED WITH DIPLOMACY AND STEAD OF MILITARY ACTION.
THE DICTATOR DID USE THEM ANYWAY.
I HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY, AND IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE -- AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED -- THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.
REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE IS THERE GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE FROM THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ON THE GROUND.
YOU MAY REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA IN 2012 WARNED THAT BARBER AL-ASSAD CROSSED A RED LINE SHOULD HE USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID IN THE PAST, AS A CANDIDATE AND AS PRESIDENT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH REGIME CHANGE.
