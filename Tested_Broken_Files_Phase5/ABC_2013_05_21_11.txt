THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
BOTH RIGHT HERE ON THIS SAME SPOT.
SAID THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

AND THIS LITTLE GIRL, WHO SAID SHE JUST WOULDN'T LET GO OF THAT DESK.
HE SHOWS US HOW HE OPENED THAT DOOR AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE WALKED OUT.
LEARNED THAT MONSTROUS TORNADO WAS IN SOME PLACES EVEN STRONGER AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN FIRST THOUGHT, A PROMISE FROM AUTHORITIES HERE.
TEACHER THINKING ABOUT ALL THOSE OTHER TEACHERS AT THE OTHER SCHOOL.
HOME AFTER HOME OBLITERATED HERE.
AND TONIGHT, WE ALSO HAVE PHOTOS COMING IN, A TRUE-GRIT MOMENT, OKLAHOMA STYLE.
JORDAN AND HER WONDERFUL FAMILY.
TAKING US DOWN INTO HIS CONCRETE STORM SHELTER WHERE THEY WERE HUDDLED.
UNLIKE PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY, MORE TRADITIONAL WITH A LONG LINE OF CLASSROOMS UNDER ONE ROOF.
THE TORNADO.
THE FASTEST WINDS EVER RECORDED INSIDE A TORNADO, TOPPED 300 MILES PER HOUR.
AND NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU A REUNION PICTURE, A LITTLE BOY, AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN HIS FACE, REUNITED WITH THE SMALLEST MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY, HIS DOG RIPPY.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE OTHER -- I COULDN'T LEAVE THE OTHER KIDS.
AT THE CENTER OF THOSE BUILDINGS AN OPENING TO THE OUTDOORS.
I WISHED I COULD HAVE SPLIT MYSELF INTO TWO AND STAYED THERE AND TRIED TO HELP OUT SOME OF THOSE OTHER KIDS, BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE HOW THEY WERE FEELING AT THAT TIME.
WHAT IS THAT?
SHE BELIEVES IT WAS BECAUSE HER SCHOOL WAS CONSTRUCTED DIFFERENTLY.
