PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
IT IS, BRIAN.
WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A SURVIVOR, SOMEONE WHO WAS EVACUATED AND MADE IT THROUGH THIS STORM IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
AS I WALKED THROUGH MOORE I SAW PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREETS WITH THEIR PETS, BLOODIES.
REMEMBER, LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE IN OKLAHOMA CITY MEANS THESE ARE REPORTERS COVERING THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.
SHE'S GOT BLOOD ALL OVER HER, BUT SHE'S OKAY AND HER DOG IS OKAY, TOO.
CARS ON TOP OF HOMES.
THAT BROUGHT HOPE TO US HERE.
THERE ARE ABOUT 150 RESPONDERS OVER THERE TRYING TO COMB THROUGH THE WRECKAGE.
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET MUCH COMMUNICATION.
IT'S A PURE MIRACLE SHE WAS ABLE TO SAVE HERSELF AND THE DOG AND GET OUT OF THAT TUB.
IT GOES ON AT LEAST A MILE DOWN THERE.
ONE GIRL CAME BACK TO SAVE HER DOG AND GOT INTO THE BATHTUB.
THE RUBBLE IS GONE.
AS MIKE SAYS, IT IS EARLY YET.
THE SCHOOL IS JUST BLOWN APART.
THERE IS A TRUCK, SUV OF SOME KIND THROWN INTO THE FRONT OF THE SCHOOL.
THERE ARE FIRES BURNING FROM OPEN GAS LINES.
SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL GO ON THROUGH THE NIGHT.
I CAN GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE OF WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
I WAS NOT IN JOPLIN, BUT AS FAR AS I CAN SEE LEFT AND RIGHT, ABOUT 150 TO 200 YARDS, THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.
