INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE HEATING OF THEIR DAY AND IT GETS TOUGHER FROM HERE INTO THE NIGHT UNTIL THINGS COOL DOWN.
I KNOW YOU TOOK SOME PICTURES OF THIS.
DID YOU SEE BLUE SKY THERE'S ON THE BACK END OF THIS.
LOOK UP AND ONE CLOUD HEADING ONE DIRECTION AND ANOTHER ARE CLOUD HEADING THE OTHER.
SO MUCH STUFF COMING IN TO FOX NEWS AND PUT AS MUCH ON THE SCREEN FOR YOU AS POSSIBLE.
IT IS TERRIFYING.
WE DID HEAR SIRENS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT ALL OF THE LOCAL NEWS STATIONS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ACTUALLY AND AS IT GETS CLOSER TO THE TIME THEY GET MORE AND MORE ACCURATE WITH THE BROADCASTS.
WIND DAMAGE AND TORNADO DAMAGE AS WELL.
HOW ABOUT FOUR INCH OF FROST SIZED HAIL.
NOW, IT IS GETTING LATER IN THE EVENING AND THINGS GETTING MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF HEATING INDEX THAT HAPPENS IN THE LATERITE PART OF THE DAY.
PEOPLE HAD THEIR PLANS.
I GREW UP IN THE THE MIDWEST.
UP TOWARDS KANSAS.
UNFORTUNATELY, AS THIS STORM MOVES EASTWARD AND ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS THAT WE NEED IT THE VERY WARM UNSTABLE AIR MASS.
I MEAN WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES AS I SAID SOUTH OF NORMAN AND IT IS SUNNY.
IT IS SURREAL.
WE SHOULD BE ON DOPPLER 3 MILLENNIUM QUICKLY PLEASE.
EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS COMING TODAY SO EVERYBODY IS GLUED TO THE TELEVISION AND THE RADIO.
THE RADAR IS PICKING UP DEBRIS FLYING AROUND THE RADAR.
WE HAD OUR VERY OWN TASTE OF THAT WITH EMILY EARLIER.
