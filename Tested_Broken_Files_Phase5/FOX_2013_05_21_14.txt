THAT'S MARY BARNHILL SITTING NEXT TO HER DAUGHTER-IN-LAW BRENDA.
AND SO, WE ARE WORKING REAL HARD RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO GET A MORE ACCURATE COUNT OF THE LOSS OF LIFE AND WE HOPE TO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS ON THAT.
THE TORNADO THREW IT UP AGAINST THE HOUSE.
WERE THESE THINGS DONATED?
WE HEARD THE STORM.
SO SHE IS ACTUALLY QUITE HAPPY ABOUT IT THAT WE ARE ALL OKAY.
THE DOORS WERE ALREADY LOCKED.
YESTERDAY, SHE WAS AT HOME WHEN SHE HEARD THE TORNADO WARNINGS.
WE ALSO WERE HERE THIS MORNING WHEN THIS PERIMETER WAS UNSEALED AND THEY LET THE RESIDENTS IN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AND WE WERE WITH THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE SAW EVERYTHING FIRSTHAND EVERYTHING I KNOW, I RODE MY STREET, MY BIKE THROUGH THIS STREET.
SO FAR.
THE STUDENTS SIMPLY HAD THE STRUCTURE TO PROTECT THEM.
NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS HOUSES.
SHE WILL BE IN OKLAHOMA WHERE YOU ARE TOMORROW, SHEP.
IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
LISTEN AGAIN.
AND YOU GO TO THE BUS AT THIS TIME.
PEOPLE ARE HELPING OUT IN SHELTERS.
TO TRY TO VOOL TIER.
