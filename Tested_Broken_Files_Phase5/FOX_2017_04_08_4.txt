EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF POLICIES HE GOING TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AND WILL IT ALIGN WITH THE JARED KUSHNER BRANCH OF THE WEST WING OR WHAT SIDE MORE WITH STEVE BANNON?
UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.
WILL THERE BE LESS REFUGEES UNLESS DEATH?
THE ONE AREA WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM THAT WAS HIS DECISION TO ACT WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BUT EVEN ON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED THAT DECISION TODAY IN A LETTER TO CONGRESS.
THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING ANY REPORTS OF A STAFF SHAKEUP IS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM THE GOOD WEEK THE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HAD.
WE SEE THE U.S.
HE WROTE THAT I ACTED IN THE VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN-POLICY INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO MY CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AS THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE.
JULIE TO SERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO LAUNCH AIRSTRIKES IN SYRIA GETTING PRAISE AND CRITICISM ARE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SOME THINKING THE MATTER NEEDS TO BE DEBATED ONCE THEY RETURN FROM EASTER RECESS IN TWO WEEKS THROUGH PUBLIC WEIGHING IN AT A TOWN HALL IN CALIFORNIA TODAY SAYING WHILE SUCH AN ATTACK MAY BE NECESSARY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION, NOT THE PRESIDENT ALONE.
ARE CONDUCTING IN CREASED AIR PATROLS A CASE OF SYRIAN OR RUSSIAN MILITARY TRIES TO ATTACK AMERICAN FORCES ON THE GROUND.
RADIOS OFFICIALS SAY RUSSIA HAS CHEMICAL WEAPONS EXPERTS INSIDE SYRIA INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINAL ROLE -- A LITERAL PRE-TWO DAYS AFTER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA 
JULIE WE HAVE TO "FOX NEWS" TEAM COVERAGE.

ANIMOSITY BETWEEN TURKEY AND ASSAD REGIME GOES BACK DECADES.
THE MAN WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN SAYS DIPLOMACY MUST BE A FACTOR.
LAST NIGHT AT THE PRESIDENTS REQUEST THE TWO SAT DOWN AT MAR-A-LAGO BUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS REMAIN.
I THINK THIS RIFT BETWEEN BANNON AND KUSHNER IS INDICATIVE OF THE CROSSROADS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS AT.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DEPLORABLE.
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR WHAT THEIR PLAN IS UNTIL IT HAPPENS.
JULIE BUT SENATOR IF WE DON'T GET INVOLVED WHAT DID THEY DO JUST CHEMICALLY GASSED EVERY BABY IN THE PLACE AND EVERY WOMAN AND CHILD?
