INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING ALREADY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE LOOKING TO THE U.S. FOR LEADERSHIP.
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN HE NEEDS TO MAKE ASSAD THE FOCUS OPEN AMERICAN REGIME CHANGE.
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT SPECIFIC.
THAT IT'S NOW HIS RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT HE WILL ACT.
THE SYRIAN DICTATOR'S BARREL BOMBS HAVE KILLED TENS OF THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS INCLUDING WOMEN AND BABIES IN THEIR BEDS.
IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING.
IF HE IS INDEED CHANGING THE WAY HE VIEWS ASSAD AND CHANGING FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN MULTIPLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS WERE SAYING THAT IT WAS NO LONGER A U.S.
THAT'S WORLD WAR DEFINED.
PEOPLE ARE HEARTENED TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT SO FORCEFULLY, TALKING IN EMOTIONAL TERMS ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK.
THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THAT REGIME CHANGE WAS NOT A PARTICULAR PRIORITY FOR THE U.S. NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT MAY BE CHANGING HIS MIND, IF NOT ON REGIME CHANGE, AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES APPROACH TO AL-ASSAD.
UNCLEAR WHAT HE WILL DO.
WE'VE HAD THAT AS OUR FORMAL POLICY SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA ARTICULATED THAT IN 2007.
WHEN YOU CAN CONSIDER WHAT THE OPTICS OF THIS ARE, JORDAN, THE UNITED STATES, SYRIAN REBELS AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND IRANIANS.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT AND SEEING IT.
THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A THEME.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A POWERFUL ALLY WITH THE KING OF JORDAN STANDING AT THE PRESIDENT'S STRIDE WHO IS STRIDENT IN HIS CONDEMNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA.
OF THIS WE'RE SURE.
I AGREE WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU WERE JUST ENGAGED IN WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS ON WHETHER TRUMP HAS TAKEN A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE ON ASSAD.
WE DID NOT MAKE REGIME CHANGE A FOREIGN POLICY GOAL.
CONSIDERING AS NIKKI HALEY SEEMED TO SUGGEST AT THE SECURITY COUNCIL OR IF IT'S GOING TO BE MORE RHETORIC THAT DOESN'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.
