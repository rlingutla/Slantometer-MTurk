INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR EVERYBODY THAT THEIR HOUSES ARE GONE.
IT JUST TORE THROUGH IT LIKE A TRUCK RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER OF IT.
I FELT THEM AND IT WAS RAINING ON ME AND ALL THAT.
I JUST RUSHED HOME, WE JUST GOT REUNITED, BUT HE'S OKAY.
AND I WAS AT WORK, SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
55 MILLION AMERICANS STILL IN THE STORM ZONE TONIGHT.
THE GOOD NEWS NOW IS THAT STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL AND ADULTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SCHOOL, TELL US THAT NO CHILDREN DIED.
HOUSES EVERYWHERE JUST FLATTENED.
THERE WERE PEOPLE CRAWLING OUT FROM EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE.
GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE HEARING AROUND TOWN.
AND 30 MINUTES AGO YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS?
AND HOURS AGO FATHER AND SON WERE REUNITED, HERE'S THEIR STORY IN THEIR OWN WORDS.
AND WE WALKED OUT, AND WE WERE ALL ALIVE.
TO SIXTH GRADER BRADY WHO WAS INSIDE BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHEN THE STORM HIT.
FOR ONE FAMILY, SUCH GREAT NEWS TONIGHT.
MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST ARRIVING BY PRIVATE VEHICLE AS WELL.
AND TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FROM ONE WOMAN WHO'S A RESIDENT OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
SOMETHING THAT I GOT TO TELL YOU, I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.
ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON, BECAUSE THIS IS STILL A VERY LARGE AREA.
THIS IS IN THE DAY.
