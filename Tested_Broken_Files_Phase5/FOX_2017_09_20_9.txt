INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
FIVE MILLION PUERTO RICANS IN THE MAINLAND.
TWO WEEKS AGO, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.
IT'S NOT SAFE TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSES.
IF YOU'RE AN AVERAGE CITIZEN IN PUERTO RICO RIGHT NOW, YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A ROOF.
BROCK LONG IN JUST A MOMENT FROM FEMA.
THEY SAY THE STORM COULD "DECIMATE" THE ISLAND'S POWER COMPANY.
YOU PROBABLY HAVE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE WHEREVER YOU LIVE AND YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY.
ALL THE BEST, CONGRESSWOMAN.
RIGHT NOW, I'M FINE.
THANK YOU.
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE STORM FROM SPACE AS THE CORE MOVES OVER PUERTO RICO.
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
MAYBE ON THE OUTER BANKS?
THE DANGEROUS WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR 24 HOURS.
WAITING UNTIL THE WINDS GETS OVER THE ISLAND.
MOST OF THE MODELS MAKE THIS NORTH WARD TURN HERE.
RETAINING WALLS AND BUILDINGS ARE WEAK.
IRMA AND WITH MARIA.
THE HURRICANE SIDE SWIPED THE ISLAND.
IN THE MORNING.
