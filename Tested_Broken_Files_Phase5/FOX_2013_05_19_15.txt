INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH

THE SKY IS BLUE 

OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS 

PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING

THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s
WHAT WE WILL DO RIGHT NOW IS ZOOM DOWN.
THEN MOVING INTO IOWA.
WE KNOW IT IS ON THE GROUND AND WE WILL STAY WITH IT OBVIOUSLY AND WE HAVE TWO CHASERS ON THAT RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO GET PHONERS AND VERIFY WHAT THEY ARE SEEING.
A TORNADO WARNING EAST OF MINNEAPOLIS THAT HAS IS SINCE BE LIFTED WHICH IS GREAT NEWS.
JENNIFER MONROE WITH THE EDMOND OKLAHOMA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THERE.
WITH TOUCHDOWNS ALREADY HAPPENING.
THE TORNADO WARNING CONTINUE THERE'S AS WELL.
THE AIR JUST KIND OF FELT WEIRD.
WE HAVE SEEN THAT MORE THAN A FEW TIMES THIS AFTERNOON AND NOW MOVING INTO THE EVENING HOURS.
FROM OKLAHOMA TO KANSAS.
ANOTHER ONE JUST NORTH OF CHANDLER.
IT HAS JUST BEEN A VICIOUS THUNDERSTORM SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THERE DROPPING TWISTERS FROM THE SKY AND THIS IS LIVE SO EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU MAY SEE THE SATELLITE PHOTO DROP OUT AS WE TRY TO CAPTURE THIS.
ANOTHER DAY OR SO TO GO OF THIS.
I'M WATCHING AND PEOPLE ARE TWEETING ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW THEY WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE AND I WANT TO GIVE THE LINE A CHANCE TO CLEAR UP BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A MOVING VEHICLE AND SOMETIMES AS YOU ARE MOVING ACROSS YOU WILL FIND A STRONGER TOWER TO HOOK UP TO SO I WANT TO GIVE IT A FEW SECONDS TO DO THAT.
WHILE YOU WERE TALKING VIEWERS SAW A VERY LARGE TORNADO TOUCHING DOWN AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS BRAND NEW VIDEO.
THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS SENSE THURSDAY OR FRIDAY SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREPARING.
WHICH WAY ARE YOU DRIVING YOU GOT TO GO THE OTHER WAY.
WHEN THAT STARTS FALLING WHEN IT FIRST STARTS PEOPLE LIKE TO GO OUT AND TAKE PICTURES BUT ONCE YOU GET INTO THE GOLF BALL AND LARGER PEOPLE GO INSIDE AND STAY AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS.
WE ARE WATCHING A DANGEROUS SITUATION UNFOLD AND IT HAS BEEN SINCE NOON TODAY.
THE DAY TIME HEATING SETTING IN AND THEN THESE STORMS START TO FIRE WITH THAT FRONT AS IT APPROACHES WITH THE COOLER DRYER AIR BEHIND IT.
