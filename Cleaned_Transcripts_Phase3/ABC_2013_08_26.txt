IS AMERICA ABOUT TO TAKE
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA
BECAUSE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS?

TONIGHT A NEW WARNING AND U.N.

AS WE COME ON THE AIR THIS
MONDAY NIGHT THE UNITED STATES
IS ABOUT TO MAKE A VERY TOUGH
CHOICE.

WILL THE U.S. MILITARY TAKE
ACTION AGAINST SYRIA?

LATE TODAY SECRETARY OF STATE
JOHN KERRY SAID IT IS CLEAR
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE DEPLOYED
AGAINST THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, BUT
WHO GAVE THAT ORDER AND WOULD
THIS DRAW AMERICA INTO ANOTHER
CONFLICT?

REPEATED SNIPER FIRE, U.N.
INVESTIGATORS DONNED HELMETS AND
BULLETPROOF VESTS TODAY AND
RETURNED TO THE DAMASCUS SUBURBS
TO INTERVIEW SURVIVORS OF THE
HORRIFIC ATTACK.

THIS IS THE EFFECT OF CHEMICALS,
ONE DOCTOR TOLD THE
INVESTIGATORS, AND TONIGHT THE
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THE
U.S. HAS LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT IS
TRUE.

MAKE NO MISTAKE, PRESIDENT
OBAMA BELIEVES THERE MUST BE
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE WHO
WOULD USE THE WORLD'S MOST
HEINOUS WEAPONS AGAINST THE
WORLD'S MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE.

ATTACK ARE HARD TO WATCH.

SECRETARY KERRY SPOKE ABOUT THE
HUNDREDS, MAYBE THOUSANDS OF
INNOCENTS WHO WERE KILLED.

AS A FATHER, I CAN'T GET THE
IMAGE OUT OF MY HEAD OF A MAN
WHO HELD UP HIS DEAD CHILD,
WAILING WHILE CHAOS SWIRLED
AROUND HIM, THE IMAGES OF ENTIRE
FAMILIES DEAD IN THEIR BEDS
WITHOUT A DROP OF BLOOD OR A
VISIBLE WOUND, BODIES CONTORTING
IN SPASMS, HUMAN SUFFERING THAT
WE CAN NEVER IGNORE OR FORGET.

FROM TOP U.S. OFFICIALS LEAVE
LITTLE DOUBT THE U.S. PLANS
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA'S
ASSAD REGIME AS THREE KEY
ALLIES, BRITAIN, FRANCE AND
TURKEY, SAY THEY WILL BACK A
MILITARY RESPONSE, U.N.

MANDATE
OR NOT.

ASSAD HIMSELF REMAINS DEFIANT,
WARNING THAT THE U.S. WOULD FAIL
AS IN VIETNAM.

DIANE, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE
PURPOSE OF ANY MILITARY STRIKE
WOULD BE TO DETER AND PREVENT
SYRIA FROM LAUNCHING ANY MORE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACKS WHICH
MEANS THE MILITARY STRIKE WOULD
LIKELY COME WITHIN DAYS OR
WEEKS.

NOW A QUICK LOOK AT THE U.S.
MILITARY MIGHT IN THE REGION.

AS OF TONIGHT FOUR WAR SHIPS AND
AT LEAST ONE SUBMARINE ARE OFF
THE COAST OF SYRIA, 100 TO 200
MILES, AND AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN
BASES MANNED BY MORE THAN 15,000

IS THERE ANY CHANCE THEY ARE
TRYING TO TARGET CHEMICAL
WEAPONS THEMSELVES?

PROBABLY NOT THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS THEMSELVES.

TO DESTROY A CHEMICAL WEAPON YOU
HAVE TO GET IT HOT.

A BOMB IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

IT'S GOING TO THROW IT AROUND
THE SURROUNDING AREA AND YOU
COULD SPREAD THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS UP TO TWO MILES AWAY.

WE ALSO DON'T WANT THE SITES
OPEN SO SOMEONE CAN COME IN AND
STEAL THEM AND USE THEM IN A
TERRORIST ATTACK LATER ON.

WHAT DO YOU THINK THE TARGETS
WILL BE AND WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO
HIT THEM?

THEY WILL PROBABLY HAVE TWO
CHARACTERISTICS.

THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC IS THEY
WANT TO DEGRADE ASSAD'S MILITARY
CAPABILITY TO A SIGNIFICANT
DEGREE.

THEY'LL PROBABLY GO AFTER AIR
FIELDS SUCH AS THE ONE IN
DAMASCUS AND THE ONE THAT
DESTROYED HELICOPTERS AND
AIRCRAFT AND WANT TO CREATE A
RUNWAY SO THEY CAN NOT BE USED
AGAINST THEIR OWN PEOPLE.

THEY'LL PROBABLY WANT TO DO
SOMETHING THAT'S VISIBLY
COMPELLING SO THE WORLD CAN SEE
THAT ASSAD HAS BEEN DELIVERED A
PUNCH AND WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING
ABOUT HIS USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AGAINST CIVILIANS.
