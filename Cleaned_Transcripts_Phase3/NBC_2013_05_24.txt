TURNING NOW TO MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, AT THE END OF A TRYING
WEEK.

FIVE DAYS AFTER A MASSIVE
TORNADO HIT THAT COMMUNITY,
POLICE HAVE REMOVED THE LAST
CHECKPOINTS CLOSING OFF THE
AFFECTED AREAS.

RESIDENTS ARE PICKING UP THE
PIECES AND NBC'S KATE SNOW HAS A
MOVING INTERVIEW WITH SOME OF
THE TEACHERS AT PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE SEVEN
CHILDREN WERE KILLED.

TWO MORE CHILDREN WERE LAID TO
TOWERS ELEMENTARY.

THEIR PRINCIPAL WAS ON HAND FOR
THOSE MEMORIALS.

TONIGHT SHE AND OTHERS ARE
SPEAKING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME
ABOUT THE LOSS AND WHAT THEY DID
TO TRY TO PROTECT HUNDREDS OF
OTHERS WHEN THE TORNADO HIT.

YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BACK HERE?

NO.

THIS IS MY FIRST TIME.

SIMPSON AND HER TEACHERS HAD
ONLY 16 MINUTES FROM THE TIME
THE TORNADO TOUCHED DOWN IN
OKLAHOMA TO THE MOMENT THEY WERE
HIT.

THEY COME RIGHT OUT OF THEIR
DOORS AND LINE UP AGAINST HERE.

CROUCHED DOWN ALONG HALLWAY
SECONDS BEFORE IMPACT SIMPSON
GOT ON THE INTERCOM AND SAID
SIMPLY, IT'S HERE.

FIRST IT'S JUST A RATTLING
LIKE SOMEONE WALKING ON THE
ROOF.

THEN YOU FEEL THINGS FALL INTO
YOUR HAIR.

JUST LITTLE THINGS, YOU KNOW.

THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN -- BIGGER
THINGS.

THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO YELL.

JUST IN GOD'S NAME, GO AWAY.

GO AWAY.

WAY.

SHE WALKED AROUND THE CORNER TO
WHERE LINDA PATTERSON'S PRE-K
CLASS WAS MOMENTS BEFORE.

WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

I HEAR THE CHILD UNDER ME
SAYING I'M NOT BREATHING, I
CAN'T BREATHE.

I HAD WEIGHT ON HER.

YOU?

A WALL.

SOME TWO BY FOURS, A CAR.

A CAR WAS THERE ON TOP OF ALL
OF THIS DEBRIS.

LINDA'S BODY WAS PINNED UNDER
THE CAR.

SHE USED HER ARMS TO PULL OUT
CHILDREN AROUND HER.

LIVES.

NO.

YES, SHE DID.

I DID WHAT -- THAT'S WHAT I
NEEDED TO DO.

THAT'S WHERE I NEEDED TO BE.

BUILT IN 1966 AND HAD NO
BASEMENT OR REINFORCED SHELTER.

WE ARE PROBABLY THE FASTEST
GROWING DISTRICT, THE THIRD
LARGEST DISTRICT.

AS WE BUILD AND BUILD, THE MONEY
HAS GONE FOR CLASSROOM SPACE.

NOT FOR SHELTERS.

ARE FRESH DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING
NOW ABOUT ALL OF THIS, WHETHER
THEY SHOULD BUILD SHELTERS IN
EVERY SCHOOL IN OKLAHOMA.

IT'S A SUBJECT THAT MAY WELL
COME UP ON SUNDAY WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA VISITS HERE.

ALSO SUNDAY A MEMORIAL SERVICE
FOR THE PUBLIC TO RECOGNIZE
THOSE WHO WERE LOST THIS WEEK.

WHEN WE COME BACK AN
EMOTIONAL REUNION FOR GRATEFUL
PARENTS IN OKLAHOMA.

AND THE DAY CARE WORKERS WHO
SERVED AS HUMAN SHIELDS TO
PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THEIR
CARE.

EVEN AMID THE RUBBLE OF THE
DEVASTATING TORNADO IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, GRATITUDE CAN BE
FOUND.

A YOUNG MOTHER WE TOLD YOU ABOUT
ON TUESDAY HAS REACHED OUT TO
THANK THE DAY CARE WORKERS WHOSE
ACTIONS SAVED THE LIVES OF HER
CHILDREN.

AT 3 YEARS OLD GRAYSON IS
ALREADY A SURVIVOR.

WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE IN A
TORNADO, GRAYSON?

GRAYSON AND HIS 6-WEEK-OLD
BROTHER BRADEN IN THE HOSPITAL
THE DAY AFTER THE TORNADO HIT.

SEEING WHAT'S LEFT OF THEIR DAY
CARE CENTER IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
ANYONE MADE IT OUT ALIVE.

IT'S A MIRACLE.

IT IS A MIRACLE.

ALL THOSE KIDS, MY BOYS GOT OUT.

SAID IT IS THANKS TO THEIR
HEROIC TEACHERS.

WHAT DID THE TEACHERS DO?

PUT COTS OVER THE HEADS.

THE CHILDREN AND LAID ON TOP TO
SHIELD THEM WITH THEIR OWN
BODIES AS THE TORNADO HIT.

WHAT DID THE KIDS DO?

SCARED.

ONLY ONLY MINOR HEAD INJURIES.

WHERE DOES IT HURT?

LOT?

THE TEACHERS?

THANK YOU.

CHILD.

RISKING YOUR LIFE TO PROTECT
MY BOYS.

THE CHANCE.

GRAYSON.

OH, BABY.

THEIR DAD KEN VISITED ABBY
LARSON WHO RAN THE DAY CARE
CENTER.

DID YOU MISS US?

MM-HMM.

YEAH.

HE WANTS TO GET BACK.

HE WAS EXCITED.

GO!

FRIENDS HAVE BEEN MISSING DAY
CARE.

IT'S BROKEN.

WE'LL GET IT FIXED.

REE BUILD THE DAY CARE CENTER
AND TAKES COMFORT IN SEEING A
GRAYSON.

JUST DAYS AFTER WE LAST SAW HIM,
HIS CUTS ARE HEALING.

JANNA SPOKE TO THE TEACHERS WHO
SAVED HER BOYS.

I'M THANKFUL AND BLESSED TO
HAVE ALL OF Y'ALL TO TAKE CARE
OF THE KIDS.

HAVE WHAT IS MOST PRECIOUS.

I WANT TO HUG EVERYBODY SINCE
Y'ALL SAVED MY BOYS' LIVES.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THANK YOU.

AFTER A WEEK OF SO MUCH
SADNESS, SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY
ABOUT.
