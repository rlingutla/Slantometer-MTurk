PLUS, IT COULD HAVE
PREVENTED THE ATTACKS OF
9/11.

THE FBI DIRECTOR ON THE
SECRET SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM.

HE SAYS TRACKING PHONE
RECORDS COULD HAVE HELPED
THEM FIND ONE OF THE
HIJACKERS.

THAT'S SAFE HOUSE HAD A
TELEPHONE NUMBER BUT THEY
COULD NOT KNOW WHO WAS
CALLING INTO THAT
PARTICULAR SAFE HOUSE.

LAWMAKERS ARE NOT
CONVINCED.

I AM NOT PERSUADED THAT
THAT THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO
COLLECT EVERY CALL.

GUY WHO LEAKED EVERYTHING.

HE IS THE SUBJECT OF AN
ONGOING CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION.

SURVEILLANCE, SECURITY, AND
A WHOLE LOT OF SECRETS.

FIRST THOUGH THE FEDS MIGHT
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT
THE ATTACKS OF 9/11 IF THEY
HAD BEEN COLLECTING
MILLIONS OF PHONE RECORDS
BACK THEN LIKE THEY ARE
NOW.

THAT'S WHAT THE FBI
DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER
TOLD CONGRESS TED.

-- TODAY.

HE SAID THEY COULD HAVE
LINKED THE PHONE NUMBER
YEMEN TO ONE OF THE
HIJACKERS BEFORE 9/11.

THE OPPORTUNITY WAS NOT
THERE IF WE HAD THAT
PROGRAM THAT OPPORTUNITY
WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

I'M NOT PERSUADED THAT
THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO
COLLECT EVERY -- EVERY
CALL -- IT'S MY FEAR THAT
WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF
BECOMING A SURVEILLANCE
STATE.

BRUISING DAY FOR SECRETARY
MULTI-CULTURAL.

ED SNOWDEN THE FORMER NSA
CONTRACTOR WHO SAYS HE
EXPOSED THE SURVEILLANCE.

HE IS HIDING THOUGHT HONG
KONG AN THREATENING TO
REVEAL WHAT HE SAYS ARE
MORE GOVERNMENT SECRETS.

ASKED WHETHER ED SNOWDEN
WAS A SPY OR HAD DEFECTED
TO CHINA THE HOUSE
LEADERSHIP LEFT THE DOOR
OPEN.

HE HAS ALREADY DONE
SERIOUS HARM.

IS HE ALSO STATING THINGS
THAT ARE JUST CAN DID CANDIDLY
NOT CORRECT.

AND CLEARLY THERE IS --
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE
THAT THERE IS A THOROUGH
SCRUB OF WHAT HE IS
HIS CHINA CONNECTIONS ARE.

IT SEEMS UNUSUAL THAT HE
WOULD BE IN CHINA AND
ASKING FOR PROTECTION OF
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
GIVING PRESS CONFERENCES TO
CHINESE MEDIA THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE SAID HE WAS PART
OF THE CHINESE THAT HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS THAT
STONE'S ELECTRONIC TRAIL
HAS BEEN TRACED TO THE
DOCUMENTS HE ACCESSED AND
THE SYSTEMS.

THE "L.A. TIMES" IS
REPORTING TONIGHT THAT THE
29-YEAR-OLD USED A THUMB
DRIVE TO STORE THE
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

THUMB DRIVES ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE BANNED ON THESE
SECURE NETWORKS, SHEP.

THEN.

DEBATE NOW, CATHERINE IT
WOULD SEEM HOW MUCH THIS
SURVEILLANCE WHICH MANY
ARGUE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
ON THE FACE OF IT MIGHT
HAVE HELPED WITH.

WELL AFTER THE NSA
DIRECTOR TESTIFIED THAT
QUOTE.

DOZENS OF TERRORIST EVENTS
WERE DISRUPTED, DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS RON WHY DEN AND
MARK URDAHL EARLY CRITICS
OF THESE PROGRAMS SAYING
QUOTE
THE HOUSE IS BACKING UP
ALEXANDER WHO CLAIMS
CONTROVERSIAL DATA
COLLECTION PROGRAMS ARE
PROVIDING PRIMARY
INVESTIGATIVE LEADS.

THESE PROGRAMS
AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS
OVERSEEN BY CONGRESS AND
FEDERAL JUDGES OVERSEEN
WITH INTERNAL CHECKS AND
BALANCES WITHIN THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH WERE
FOUND TO BE DIRECTLY
EFFECTIVE IN THWARTING
TERRORIST ATTACKS.

BUT CRITICS SAY THE
INITIAL CREDIT CRITICAL
NEEDS OF THE NEW YORK CITY
SUBWAY KILLER ZHIZI AND
HEADLEE CAME FROM OVERSEA
AGENCY AND PROGRAMS WERE
SECONDARY.

THEY CONFIRMED THE TIPS.

ALSO AHEAD THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN
SAYS A LIST OF PLOTS
DISRUPTED BY THE NSA MAY BE
DECLASSIFIED AS EARLY AS
MONDAY.

ASKED WHETHER A COURT ORDER
IS NEEDED FOR INVESTIGATORS
TO SWIM THROUGH OR SIFT
THROUGH THE PHONE RECORDS
OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS,
FEINSTEIN SAID NO.

ADDING, YOU JUST NEED COURT
APPROVAL IF YOU WANT TO GET
TO THAT CONTENT, SHEP.

CATHERINE, LAWMAKERS HAD
LOTS OF OTHERS QUESTIONS
FOR THE FBI DIRECTOR TODAY.

AS I MENTIONED IT WAS
BRUISING.

QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IRS
INVESTIGATION.

AND WHY THE FEDS CALLED THE
FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT A
POSSIBLE CRIMINAL.

THAT'S NEXT FROM THE
JOURNALISTS OF FOX NEWS.

DID MY RESEARCH.

JUST BECAUSE WE CALL
SOMEBODY A POSSIBLE
CRIMINAL DOES NOT MEAN WE
PLAN TO PROSECUTE THE
PERSON.

THAT TODAY FROM THE FBI
DIRECTOR ROBERT MUELLER
TESTIFYING ON CAPITOL HILL
SEARCH REQUEST THAT
REFERRED TO FOX NEWS
CORRESPONDENT JAMES ROSEN
AS A QUOTE POTENTIAL
COCONSPIRATOR IN A LEAK
INVESTIGATION.

DIRECTOR MULTI-CULTURAL
SAID AS FAR AS HE KNOWS
JAMES ROSEN WAS NEVER A
SUSPECT.

WHEN YOU AUTHORIZE A
SEARCH WARRANT FOR A TARGET
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
ISN'T THE PROSECUTION OF
THAT TARGET AN OBJECTIVE?

I WOULD SAY NO.

QUITE OFTEN IN SWARNTSZ,
THERE ARE AFFIDAVITS SEARCH
WARRANTS.

PERSON MENTIONED AS HAVING
CULPABILITY.

NO DISCUSSION OR
ANTICIPATION OF
CONVENIENT.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS
JOURNALISTS SHOULD NOT FACE
LEGAL ACTION FOR DOING
THEIR JOBS.

AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
ERIC HOLDER HAS MET WITH
NEWS EXECUTIVES TO TALK
ABOUT CHANGING THE
GUIDELINES FOR
INVESTIGATIONS THAT INVOLVE
THE MEDIA MIKE EMANUEL IS
LIVE FOR US ON CAPITOL
HILL.

I GUESS THEY ASKED HIM
TODAY ABOUT THE IRS
INVESTIGATION AS WELL.

SHEP, THAT'S BECAUSE
THERE IS A CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION LOOKING INTO
THE TARGETING OF THOSE
CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS
BY THE IRS.

SO SOME LEADING LAWMAKERS
WERE LOOKING FOR SOME
ANSWERS FROM THE FBI
DIRECTOR.

CAN YOU TELL ME SOME
BASICS?

CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY
AGENTS AND INVESTIGATORS
YOU HAVE ASSIGNED TO THE
CASE?

MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT
BUT I HAVE TO GET BACK TO
YOU.

YOU CAN TELL ME HOT LEAD
INVESTIGATOR IS.

OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
NO.

THE GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE
CONTROVERSY COULD MEAN BIG
BUSINESS FOR SOME TECH
ENTREPRENEURS.

WE'LL SHOW YOU HOW THE
FOLKS WHO MAKE APPS ARE
TRYING TO CASH IN ON
PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY AND
ONE THAT JUST MIGHT WORK
OUT WELL FOR YOU.

SAYS NOBODY IS LISTENING TO
YOUR PHONE CALLS.

HE SAYS THE GOVERNMENT JUST
COLLECTS INFORMATION LIKE
WHO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
CALL AND HOW LONG THEY
TALK.

BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
TAKE ANY CHANCES, THERE IS
AN APP.

FOR THAT.

SHEPARD THERE ARE, IN
FACT, MORE THAN A HALF A
DOZEN APPS AVAILABLE ONLINE
SUCH AS SEE CLIFT AND
SILENT CIRCLE THAT SAY THEY
WILL PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY.

THE NEXT TIME YOU USE YOUR
SMART PHONE.

THEY EACH ENCRYPT THE DATA
FROM YOUR PHONE MAKING IT
DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR A THIRD PARTY TO LISTEN
IN OR LEARN WHO YOU ARE
CALLING.

SOME OF THE COMPANIES SAY
THEY ARE BASED OUTSIDE THE
U.S.

IN ORDER TO BEING
SUBJECT TO U.S. PRIVACY
LAWS AND SUBPOENAS BUT ADD
THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT
THING IF PUBLIC SAFETY IS
AT RISK.

THIS IS AN APP TO
RESTORE PRIVACY RIGHTS TO
THE AVERAGE PERSON.

WE ARE NOT HERE TO HELP
TERRORISTS JUST TO BE VERY
CLEAR.

SO IF A GOVERNMENT COMES TO
US AND SAYS WE NEED HELP,
YOU KNOW, WE WILL COOPERATE
WITH THEM TO THE FULL
EXTENT THAT WE CAN.

MOST OF THE INCRYPTION
SERVICES SAY ONCE A CALL IS
FINISHED ALL RELEVANT DATA
IS DESTROYED.

ACCORDING TO ONE PRIVACY
EXPERT THESE APPS DO A GOOD
JOB OF PROTECTING PRIVACY,
FORTUNATELY FOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT THEY NORTH
PERFECT.

I THINK WHAT A LOT OF
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS FBI
AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
HAVE A LOT OF CAPABILITY TO
HACK INTO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

AND THEY CAN USE THAT
ABILITY RIGHT NOW TO
EAVESDROP ON PEOPLE EVEN IF
THEY'RE USING INCRYPTION.

SOME OF THESE PRIVACY
APPS DO MORE THAN ENCRYPT
PHONE CALLS.

THEY CAN BE USED FOR
TEXTING, EMAIL AND EVEN
VIDEO CONFERENCING.

THE FEDS ARE NOW ASKING
COMPANIES THAT MAKE MEDICAL
DEVICES TO IMPROVE
SECURITY.

TO GUARD THEIR PRODUCTS
FROM HACKERS.

OFFICIALS SAY THEY WANT TO
PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION AND PREVENT
MALFUNCTIONS.

THE TOP PROSECUTORS IN NEW
YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO
MAKING A PUSH TO STOP SMART
PHONE THIEVES ACROSS THE
NATION.

THEY ANNOUNCED A NEW
INITIATIVE CALLED SECURE
OUR SMART PHONES.

WHICH THEY SAY WILL INVOLVE
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
CONSUMER ADVOCATES FOR FOR
MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES.

HERE IS THE DEAL.

THEY SAY THEY WILL PRESSURE
SMART PHONE COMPANIES TO
END THE SECONDARY MARKET IN
STOLEN PHONES AND TO SEEK
THE INDUSTRY WIDE
INTRODUCTION OF A KILL
SWITCH THAT WOULD RENDER
STOLEN PHONES WORTHLESS FOR
GOOD.
