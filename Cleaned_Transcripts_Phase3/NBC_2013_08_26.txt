ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT --
PLAN OF ATTACK?

THE U.S. NOW SAYS IT IS
UNDENIABLE THAT SYRIA USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS OWN
PEOPLE.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE CALLING
IT A MORAL OBSCENITY.

IS AMERICA ABOUT TO STRIKE?

CALLING OUT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT OVER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK LAST WEEK THAT
KILLED HUNDREDS OF SYRIAN
CIVILIANS.

THE LANGUAGE FROM WASHINGTON
TODAY WAS EXCEEDINGLY BLUNT.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
THIS AFTERNOON LAYING OUT THE
CASE FOR A LIKELY U.S. MILITARY
RESPONSE.

THE KILLING OF WOMEN AND
CHILDREN AND INNOCENT BYSTANDERS
BY CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A MORAL
OBSCENITY.

BY ANY STANDARD IT IS
INEXCUSABLE AND DESPITE THE
EXCUSES AND EQUIVOCATIONS THAT
SOME HAVE MANUFACTURED, IT IS
UNDENIABLE.

TONIGHT THE WHITE HOUSE IS
GATHERING INTERNATIONAL BACKING
FOR POSSIBLE AIR STRIKES AGAINST
SYRIA WHILE U.N.
CHEMICAL WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE
FINALLY BEEN ALLOWED IN TO
GROUND ZERO OF LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

HE IS NOW SAFELY BACK ON THE
TURKISH SIDE OF THE BORDER WITH
A LOT MORE ON TODAY'S
FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS.

SOME WESTERN OFFICIALS BELIEVE
THAT PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD
PERSONALLY ORDERED THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

TONIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO
FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE
ABOUT ANY U.S. MILITARY ACTION.

ONE OF THEIR VEHICLES SHOT BY A
SNIPER, BUT AFTER A BRIEF DELAY
THEY FINALLY BEGAN THEIR WORK
INTERVIEWING SURVIVORS, DOCTORS
AND TAKING SAMPLES.

BUT THIS MAY ALREADY BE A SIDE
SHOW.

THE U.S. AND OTHERS ALREADY
BELIEVE THE ASSAD REGIME USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS LAST WEEK ON A
SCALE NOT SEEN ANYWHERE IN
DECADES.

SO AMERICA IS ONCE AGAIN
BUILDING A CASE FOR MILITARY
ACTION.

THERE MUST BE ACCOUNTABILITY
FOR THOSE WHO WOULD USE THE
WORLD'S MOST HEINOUS WEAPONS.

CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES FROM FOUR
U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS AND TWO
SUBMARINES ALREADY IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN.

POSSIBLE TARGETS, SYRIAN
MILITARY FACILITIES AND WEAPONS
SYSTEMS, PLANES AND AIRFIELDS,
COMMAND AND CONTROL BUNKERS, BUT
NOT U.S. OFFICIALS SAY PRESIDENT
ASSAD HIMSELF.

AND NOT CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCK
PILES.

TOO RISKY.

WOULD IT BE LEGAL?

U.N. BACKING IS UNLIKELY WITHOUT
RUSSIAN SUPPORT.

BUT A COALITION OF ARAB AND
EUROPEAN STATES ALONG WITH THE
U.S. COULD BE USED TO JUSTIFY A
STRIKE.

WE TRAVELED TO NORTHERN SYRIA
TODAY WITH U.S.-BACKED REBELS.

SYRIANS TELL US THE UNITED
STATES HAS AN ENORMOUS
RESPONSIBILITY NOW.

YES, THIS ISN'T AMERICA'S WAR.

AND NO, THESE PEOPLE HERE DON'T
WANT AMERICAN TROOPS AND FOR
THIS TO BECOME ANOTHER IRAQ.

BUT THEY SAY, IF THE UNITED
STATES DOESN'T INTERVENE NOW,
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S REGIME WILL BE
ENCOURAGED TO GO FURTHER AND
THEY BELIEVE USE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AGAIN.

OSAMA MOAS ARRIVED AT A CAMP
WITH HIS WIFE AND 11 CHILDREN
TODAY.

HE TOLD US HE CAME TO HIDE FROM
THE POISON GAS.

AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO
GO.

POWERFUL WORDS CAME FROM THIS
10-YEAR-OLD A MESSAGE SHE SAID
SHE HAD FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.

KIDS TO BE LIKE US?

AREN'T WE JUST LIKE THEM?

WHEN WE GET BIGGER, WE ARE GOING
TO WRITE, "OBAMA DIDN'T HELP US"
SHE SAID.

SECRETARY KERRY MADE IT CLEAR
TODAY THE U.S.

WANTS TO HELP.

AND IS PREPARING TO ACT.

THE IMAGES OF ENTIRE FAMILIES
DEAD IN THEIR BEDS, HUMAN
SUFFERING THAT WE CAN NEVER
IGNORE OR FORGET.

ANYONE WHO COULD CLAIM THAT AN
ATTACK OF THIS STAGGERING SCALE
COULD BE CONTRIVED OR FABRICATED
NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR CONSCIENCE
AND THEIR OWN MORAL COMPASS.

DENIES IT EVER USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

SYRIAN REBELS TELL US THAT ASSAD
HAS USED THEM AT LEAST 30 TIMES
SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN AND THIS
LATEST CASE WAS JUST THE MOST
FLAGRANT.

THERE IS SOME LATE
DEVELOPMENTS OUT OF WASHINGTON
REGARDING POSSIBLE U.S. ACTION
AGAINST SYRIA.

TELLING ME, LESTER, THEY'RE
GOING TO PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE TO
BACK UP THEIR CONCLUSION IN
COMING DAYS PERHAPS AS EARLY AS
TOMORROW.

ONE REASON JOHN KERRY WAS SO
PASSIONATE TODAY, THE SCALE OF
THIS ATTACK AND ITS BRAZEN
QUALITY.

WITH THOSE INSPECTORS ON THE
GROUND THEY SAY A MILITARY
OPTION WAS NOT AUTOMATIC.

IF RUSSIA HAD CHANGED ITS POLICY
OR SYRIA ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT IT
HAD DONE, THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO
PUNISH THE REGIME.

SO FAR, THEY HAVE BRITISH,
FRENCH, TURKEY ON BOARD.

THEY HOPE THE ARAB LEAGUE WILL
ENDORSE A LIMITED ATTACK NOT
AIMED AT TOPPLING ASSAD BUT
MAKING IT CLEAR THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THIS SCALE
IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.

THEY HAVE PENTAGON PLANS ON THE
SHELF FOR A WHILE.

I'M TOLD THIS IS NOT IMMINENT.

THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO ORGANIZE
THE ALLIES, NOTIFY CONGRESS AND
LIKELY NOT ATTACK WHILE THOSE
U.N.

INSPECTORS ARE STILL ON THE
GROUND.

THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO LEAVE
SUNDAY.

NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
BECOME REFUGEES FLEEING THE WAR
IN SYRIA.

AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THERE
IS A GRIM MILESTONE REACHED AS
WELL.

NEARLY ONE MILLION OF THOSE
REFUGEES ARE CHILDREN, MOST
UNDER THE AGE OF 11.

NBC'S ANN CURRY MADE HER WAY
TODAY TO ONE OF THE REFUGEE
CAMPS, THE BIGGEST IN FACT.

IT'S ON SYRIA'S BOARD WITH
JORDAN.

IT'S BURSTING AT THE SEAMS WITH
130,000 PEOPLE.

ANN JOINS US FROM AMMAN.

WITH THE MASSIVE NUMBERS AND THE
SHOCKING IMAGES OF CHILDREN
SUFFERING IN AN APPARENT
CHEMICAL ATTACK, THE WAR IN
SYRIA APPEARS TO BE TURNING AN
EMOTIONAL CORNER, CAPTURING THE
ATTENTION OF THE WORLD.

TODAY WE FOUND ONE SMALL SYRIAN
BOY, ONE OF THE ONE MILLION.

IN A CLINIC INSIDE JORDAN'S
ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, WE FOUND
JALAL, WHO BARELY ESCAPED THE
WAR BACK HOME.

[ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]
OLD HE LOOKS BACK ON WHAT WAS
ONCE A HAPPY CHILDHOOD IN SYRIA.

BALL WITH OUR FATHER AND GO ON
SWINGS AND SHOOT MARBLES AND
RIDE BICYCLES HE SAYS.

[ BOMB BLASTS ]
BUT WAR CAME TO HIS HOMETOWN.

[ GUNFIRE ]
HE TELLS US "WE WERE NOT ALLOWED
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE BECAUSE
SNIPERS WOULD START SHOOTING AT
US.

THEY WOULD SLAUGHTER THE MEN AND
CUT OFF THEIR FINGERS OR ARMS
AND THROW THEIR BODIES INTO THE
SCHOOLS."

SIX WEEKS AGO PLAYING OUTSIDE
WITH HIS 10-YEAR-OLD BROTHER AND
FRIENDS, SOMETHING EXPLODED.

JALAL WAS HIT BY SHRAPNEL AND
WATCHED CLOSE FRIENDS DIE.

STOMACH CUT OPEN, HE SAYS, THE
FIGHTING WAS AS CLOSE AS YOU ARE
FROM US.

WE CRAWLED ON OUR BELLIES OR
RAN.

WE FELL AND SCRAPED OUR KNEES.

SOMETIMES WE WOULD START
SHAKING.

EVEN OUR MOTHERS STARTED CRYING.

NIMAD DESCRIBES THEIR ESCAPE.

SNIPER WAS CLOSE, WE TOLD THE
CHILDREN TO CRAWL ALONG.

THE ROAD.

THANK GOD THEY LISTENED TO US
AND THEY ARE SAFE.

DAYS LEAVING JALAL'S FATHER A
COOK TO FIGHT AS A REBEL.

THEY HEARD FROM HIM JUST ONCE
SINCE THEY LEFT HOME.

NOW JALAL'S MOTHER WEEPS FOR ALL
THEIR LOST LOVED ONES.

TODAY, SAFE IN THE CAMP, JALAL
GETS A CHANCE TO BE A KID AGAIN.

BUT AT NIGHT HE SAYS IT'S HARD
TO SLEEP.

HE DREAMS OF HIS FATHER AND
CRIES.

JALAL'S STORY IS ONE GLIMPSE
INTO THIS WAR'S TRAGEDY FOR
SYRIA'S CHILDREN.

MEANTIME, THE CRISIS HAS
OUTPACED THE WORLD'S RESPONSE
MAKING FOR VERY TOUGH CONDITIONS
INSIDE THOSE REFUGEE CAMPS.

TODAY WE WITNESS SEVERAL HUNDRED
SYRIAN REFUGEES LEAVING THE
ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP TO GO BACK
TO SYRIA.

ONE SAYING, "I WOULD RATHER DIE
UNDER SHELL FIRE THAN LIVE IN
THIS CAMP."
