CRISIS IN SYRIA.

THE REPORTED NEW BOMBING IN THAT
SAME TOWN WHERE THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK KILLED DOZENS.

PLUS SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF FROM
THE AIRBASE HIT BY U.S.
MISSILES.

TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP
DEFENDING THE DECISION NOT TO
BOMB THE RUNWAYS.

WE BEGIN
WITH NEW BOMBINGS BY PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL ASSAD ON HIS OWN
PEOPLE IN THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THIS AS IMAGES ARE EMERGING OF
SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF FROM THE
AIRBASE TARGETED BY U.S.
TOMAHAWK MISSILES.

PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDING AND
EXPLAINING THE DECISION NOT TO
BOMB THE RUNWAYS AND TONIGHT WE
HEAR FROM ONE OF THE MOST
VISIBLE VICTIMS FROM THE SYRIAN
ATTACK.

THE FATHER OF BABY TWINS KILLED
BY THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

ABC EAST ALEX MARQUARDT LEADS US
SYRIAN AIRBASE HIT BY THE U.S.
MILITARY BACK UP AND
RUNNING, NEW PHOTOS SHOWING
SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF LESS THAN
24 HOURS AFTER THE U.S. STRIKE.

THE MARKINGS FROM THE BOMBINGS
SEEN ON BUNKERS.

IMAGES SHOWING AIRCRAFT AND
BOMBED OUT FUEL TANKS AND DAMAGE
TO AIRCRAFT SHELTERS.

BUT THE RUNWAYS UNTOUCHED.

TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A
DEFENSE.

THE REASON YOU GENERALLY DON'T
HIT RUNWAYS IS THAT THEY ARE
EASY AND INEXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY
FIX.

THE PENTAGON SAYS IT WAS FROM
THIS BASE THAT A PLANE TOOK OFF
WITH THE DEADLY NERVE AGENT USED
IN TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL ATTACK
THAT KILLED MORE THAN 80 PEOPLE.

AND THAT TOWN BOMBED AGAIN TODAY
ACCORDING TO A WATCHDOG GROUP.

THERE IS IRONY HERE THAT IT
DOES APPEAR THAT IT'S OKAY FOR
MR. ASSAD TO BLOW UP HIS PEOPLE.

IT'S JUST NOT OKAY TO GAS THEM.

WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
ANNOUNCED THE STRIKE HE POINTED
TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED.

IT WAS A SLOW AND BRUTAL
DEATH FOR SO MANY.

EVEN BEAUTIFUL BABIES WERE
CRUELLY MURDERED IN THIS VERY
BARBARIC ATTACK.

PERHAPS NO IMAGE MORE GUT
WRENCHING OF THIS ONE OF ABDUL
HAMEEM YOUSSEF HUGGING HIS
TWO LIFELESS
TWINS.

HE WENT HOUSE TO HOUSE TRYING TO
RESCUE NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY.

MANY FOAMING AT THE MOUTH.

HE LOST 25 RELATIVES IN THE
ATTACK DURING WHICH HE FAINTED.

ASKED FOR THEM HE SAID.

I TOLD THEM HELLO DARLINGS I
TOOK TOO LONG.

I RESCUED EVERYONE ELSE BUT I
COULDN'T RESCUE YOU.

DESCRIBING THE MOMENT THE PHOTO
WAS TAKEN YOUSSEF SAID I WASN'T
AWARE OF ANYTHING.

I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE.

I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO HUG ME
BACK.

THAT FATHER'S STORY AND THE
IMAGES SO DEVASTATING.

ALEX JOINS US LIVE.

THE BIG QUESTION, WILL SYRIA
RESPOND TO THE U.S.

ATTACK AND
DO WE KNOW IF TODAY'S NEW
BOMBING BY SYRIA OF THAT TOWN
WHERE THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
OCCURRED WAS THAT RETALIATION?

WHETHER THAT SYRIAN ATTACK WAS
IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE
AMERICAN STRIKE WHICH PRESIDENT
ASSAD HAS CALLED AN UNJUST ACT
OF AGGRESSION BUT WE ARE SEEING
THE REACTION.

A DEFIANT
ASSAD SAYING WE ARE GOING TO
CONTINUE CARRYING BOMBING RUNS
AND LAUNCHING OUR PLANES FROM
THE BASE THAT YOU JUST STRUCK.

DIGGING DEEPER INTO THE DECISION
AROUND THAT STRIKE PLUS THE
BREWING CIVIL WAR INSIDE THE
WEST WING BETWEEN TWO OF THE
PRESIDENT'S TOP AIDES.

ABC'S DAVID WRIGHT REPORTING
FROM WEST PALM BEACH TONIGHT.

PRESIDENT STILL INSISTS THE
TOMAHAWK MISSILE STRIKE WAS AN
UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.

TWEETING OUT, "CONGRATULATIONS
TO OUR GREAT MILITARY MEN AND
WOMEN FOR REPRESENTING THE
UNITED STATES, AND THE WORLD SO
WELL."

NOT LONG AGO TRUMP WAS RELUCTANT
TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.

WE DON'T WANT WORLD WAR III OVER
SYRIA.

BACK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
WANTED TO PUNISH SYRIA FOR A
PREVIOUS CHEMICAL ATTACK.

TRUMP TWEETED WHAT WILL WE GET
FOR BOMBING SYRIA BESIDES MORE
DEBT AND A LONG TERM CONFLICT.

OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL.

TRUMP INFORMED CONGRESS AFTER
THE MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ASKED
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
IF THE STRIKE SIGNALS A CHANGE
IN U.S. POLICY.

THIS STRIKE WAS RELATED
SOLELY TO THE MOST RECENT
HORRIFIC USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST WOMEN, CHILDREN AND AS
THE PRESIDENT SAID EVEN SMALL
BABIES.

WE ARE CALLING ON BASHAR AL
ASSAD TO CEASE THE USE OF THE
WEAPONS.

OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO
CHANGE TO OUR MILITARY POSTURE.

EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT WAS
JUGGLING TWO FOREIGN ISSUES,
CHINA AND SYRIA.
