RIGHT NOW HOSPITALS IN THE UK
STRUGGLING TO RESTORE THEIR
COMPUTER SYSTEMS AFTER A
MASSIVE CYBER ATTACK.

HOW HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND
THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMPANIES
FELL VICTIM ACROSS THE GLOBE.

WELL,
COMPANIES ACROSS THE GLOBE
RIGHT NOW RACING TO RECOVER
AFTER A MASSIVE CYBER ATTACK.

BRITAIN PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM
WAS ONE OF THE VERY HARDEST
HIT.

BUT THE ATTACK ALSO TARGETED
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND
BUSINESSES IN NEARLY 100
COUNTRIES.

HACKERS USING MALICIOUS
SOFTWARE STOLEN FROM THE NSA
TO CONDUCT WHAT IS BELIEVED TO
BE THE LARGEST RANSOMWARE
ATTACK ON RECORD.

WHAT WE'VE NOW GOT IS A
BUNCH OF 21ST CENTURY HIGHWAY
ROBBERS THAT HAVE HACKED INTO
OUR NHS AND BASICALLY OFFERING
PROTECTION MONEY TO GET THE
INFORMATION BACK IN ORDER TO
TREAT CANCER PATIENTS OR
ANYBODY ELSE.

IT'S UNBELIEVABLY DISGUSTING.

JULIE LIVE FROM OUR NEW YORK
STUDIO HERE AND LET'S JUST
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT
THIS ATTACK BECAUSE IT WAS
VERY FAR REACHING.

I MEAN, THIS IS AN
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK, JULIE,
UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER
SEEN.

IT IS THE LARGEST ATTACK OF
THIS TYPE AND HACKERS USED
MESSAGES THAT WERE FIRST
DEPLOYED BY THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY IN SECRET BUT
OF COURSE THESE MESSAGES WERE
LEAKED ON THE INTERNET WHICH
ALLOWED HACKERS TO THEN USE
IT.

AND AMONG THE TOOLS USED WAS A
MICROSOFT WINDOWS FLAW THE NSA
KNEW ABOUT.

HACKERS EXPLOITED THIS FLAW TO
INFECT COMPUTERS WITH
RANSOMWARE.

IT GETS INTO SPAM E-MAIL OR
ATTACHMENTS, IT LOCKS YOUR
COMPUTER HOLDING IT AND ITS
DATA HOSTAGE UNTIL USER HAS TO
PAY RANSOM.

THIS IS A SCREENSHOT OF WHAT
THE VIRUS DUBBED WANT TO CRY.

IN THIS CASE USERS HAD TO PAY
UP TO $600 TO GET ACCESS
AGAIN.

THE SIDE AND SPEED HITTING
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS
INCLUDING IN HUNDREDS OF
COMPANIES INCLUDING THE U.S.,
UK, CHINA.

IT AFFECTED FEDEX HERE IN THE
U.S. AND BRITISH HOSPITALS AND
MEDICAL CENTERS.

MANY WERE FORCED TO CANCEL OR
DELAY ROUTINE PROCEDURES LIKE
X-RAYS, VITAL PROCEDURES LIKE
CANCER TREATMENTS AND NO ONE
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.

BUT AS FOR, SAY, IT'S NOT
LIKELY TO BE A GOVERNMENT.

ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE
TO OFTEN GROUND OURSELVES IN
AS SECURITY PROFESSIONALS IS
ALTHOUGH WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT
THE NATION STATE ATTACKS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME
SENSATIONALIZED IN THE NEWS,
THE REALITY IS 80% OF WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH ON A
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IS ORGANIZED
CRIMINAL GANGS.

THIS IS, IN FACT, ONE OF THE
LARGEST ILLEGAL ECONOMIES IN
THE WORLD.

IBM IS SATISFYING THE
DAMAGE, JULIE.

SO HOW IS
THIS ATTACK STOPPED?

AND WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES?

BOTTOM LINE AMAZING IS THIS
ATTACK WAS STOPPED BY A SAVVY
22-YEAR-OLD BASED RESEARCHER
WHO STOPPED THIS ATTACK USING
A $11 DOMAIN.

THIS ANONYMOUS RESEARCHER
TWEETING I WILL CONFESS THAT I
WAS UNAWARE REGISTERING THE
DOMAIN WILL STOP THE MALWARE
UNTIL AFTER I REGISTERED IT SO
INITIALLY, IT WAS ACCIDENTAL.

THE ADVICE FOR YOU.

DOWNLOAD THE LATEST MICROSOFT
WINDOWS SECURITY UPDATE.

BACK UP YOUR DATA.

DO NOT OPEN SPAM.

STAY SAFE OUT THERE.

THERE ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE
MORE ATTACKS.
