AMERICAN WAR SHIPS SITTING NOT
FAR FROM SYRIA.

THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT SYRIA IS
USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS
OWN PEOPLE, FROM A SENIOR OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.

IS IT TIME TO FIRE AWAY?

I CERTAINLY WOULD DO CRUISE
MISSILE STRIKES.

I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, WITHOUT
HAVING AMERICANS IN HARM'S WAY.

IF THE MILITARY ADVISES, THIS
COULD DESTROY THE CHEMICAL
WEAPON STOCKPILE, I WOULD
SUPPORT THAT.

FOX REPORT, THE LATEST
RESPONSE HERE AND OVERSEAS TO
NEW TALKS OF MILITARY
INTERVENTION AGAINST THE ASSAD
REGIME.

THE POPE, LEADER OF ONE BILLION
CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD HAS
SPOKEN ABOUT SYRIA.

AS YOU KNOW, WORLD GOVERNMENTS,
INCLUDING OUR OWN, ARE PONDERING
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR
IN SYRIA CREATING MILLIONS OF
REFUGEES, PUTTING PRESSURE ON
NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND
POTENTIALLY PUNCHING HOLES IN AN
ALREADY FRAGILE IMBALANCE THERE.

IT COULD BE THE OPENING FOR
TERRORISTS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE
CHAOS IN SYRIA.

ASIDE FROM THE WRANGLING BY THE
POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS,
TODAY, POPE FRANCIS CALLED FOR
ACTION, URGING THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO STEP UP EFFORTS TO
HELP SYRIA END THE WAR.

THE POPE ADDRESSED TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF WORSHIPPERS IN ST.
PETER'S SQUARE, SPEAKING ABOUT
THE TERRIBLE IMAGES SHOWING
INNOCENT CIVILIANS UNDER ATTACK.

HE RENEWED CALLS FOR THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT AND REBELS TO PUT
DOWN ARMS AND START TALKING.

POPE FRANCIS ALSO EXPRESSING
LOVE WITH PRAYERS AND SOLIDARITY
TO VICTIMS OF THE CONFLICT AND
THOSE SUFFERING, ESPECIALLY THE
CHILDREN.

JUST HOURS AGO, LAWMAKERS FROM
BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES CALLING
FOR A LIMITED MILITARY RESPONSE.

THE REPORTED CHEMICAL ATTACK IN
SYRIA'S CAPITAL CITY, KILLING
HUNDREDS.

THE U.N. ANNOUNCING SYRIA IS
CLAIMING IT WILL ALLOW A TEAM OF
INSPECTORS TO EXAMINE THE SITE.

A SENIOR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL SAYING THERE'S VERY
LITTLE DOUBT PEOPLE WERE GASSED.

SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE,
RANKING MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN
RELATIONS COMMITTEE IS AMONG THE
LAWMAKERS GOING ON THE RECORD
TODAY.

I THINK WE WILL RESPOND IN A
SURGICAL WAY AND I HOPE THE
PRESIDENT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK
TO WASHINGTON WILL ASK FOR
AUTHORIZATION FROM CONGRESS TO
DO SOMETHING IN A VERY SURGICAL
AND PROPORTIONAL WAY, SOMETHING
THAT GETS THEIR ATTENTION, THAT
CAUSES THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT
WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH
THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY.

WE HAVE TO VERIFY IT WAS
DIRECTED BY THE ASSAD REGIME.

THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION AND THAT
IS NECESSARY TO TAKE FURTHER
STEPS IN SYRIA, ALSO WILL HELP
DIFFUSE SOME OF THE COUNTRIES
LIKE IRAN, RUSSIA, TRYING TO
PAWN THIS OFF ON THE REBELS.

AND THE SECOND LAWMAKER, OF
COURSE, YOU SAW THERE WAS
SENATOR JACK REED WHO TALKED
ABOUT DIFFUSING COUNTRIES LIKE
IRAN AND HE MENTIONED RUSSIA,
LONG TIME ALLY OF THE SYRIAN
PRESIDENT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY
SAYS ANY BILATERAL ACTIONS THAT
BYPASSES UNITED NATIONS WOULD
HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON
SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

WE HEARD FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION OVER THE WEEKEND,
THE NAVY STATION DESTROYERS IN
THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEE,
BUT NO WORD ON PLANS FOR THE
SHIPS.

THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS A QUICK
INTERVENTION WOULD BE
PROBLEMATIC, WHILE SOME
LAWMAKERS THINK LEADERS SHOULD
BE ACTING OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF
CAUTION, OTHERS SAY THERE SHOULD
BE MORE ACTIVITY.

WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR WAR
SHIPS, AGAIN, OFF THE COAST OF
SYRIA, MISSILES ARE AN OPTION TO
TRY TO TAKE OUT THE CHEMICAL
STOCK PILES.

JUST STANDING OFF, THROWING A
FEW MISSILES, DROPPING A FEW
BOMBS ON KEY TARGETS ARE WHAT WE
IN THE MILITARY CALL A FEEL GOOD
BOMBING.

IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE
ABILITY TO SAY HE'S DONE
SOMETHING, PERHAPS SOME IN
AMERICA FEEL BETTER, BUT IN
TERMS OF DEGRADING THE ABILITY
OF THE SYRIAN ARMY TO ATTACK ITS
OWN PEOPLE IN THIS CIVIL WAR, I
DON'T THINK MUCH IS GOING TO
COME OUT OF IT.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
HAS ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COLLEAGUES
OVER THE WEEKEND.

A COUPLE HOURS AGO, WE
LEARNED THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH
THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE TODAY.

ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION,
THEY DISCUSSED POSSIBLE FUTURE
RESPONSES BY THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY AND AGREED TO STAY IN
CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.

JUST YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT
SPENT MORE THAN 40 MINUTES
SPEAKING WITH THE BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER DAVID CAMERON.

THEY AGREE THE CRISIS IS
UPGRADED, WARRANTS SERIOUS
RESPONSE.

TWO LEADERS AGREE ALL OPTIONS TO
BE ON THE TABLE.

OF COURSE, HARRIS, ALL OF THE
MEN EXPRESS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT
THE ALLEGED USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

INSPECTORS ARE SET TO VISIT THE
SITE OF THE ALLEGED CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO
ALLOW THEM TO GO IN.

THEY WILL BEGIN FACT-FINDING IN
SYRIA IN A FEW HOURS.

IT IS ALREADY MONDAY THERE.

SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY IT MAY
BE TOO LATE TO FIND ANYTHING.

IF THE SYRIANS HAD NOTHING TO
HIDE, WOULD HAVE LET THEM IN
FIVE DAYS AGO.

BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY SAYS
EVIDENCE OF THAT ATTACK MAY BE
GONE.

COMING UP, INSIDE THE FOX
REPORT, YOU HEARD US SO FAR
REPORT TWO THREATS, ONE FROM
IRAN, ONE FROM RUSSIA.

IF OUR MILITARY WERE TO MAKE A
MOVE IN SYRIA OUTSIDE THE UNITED
NATIONS.

TO GET A BETTER IDEA WHAT THE
THREATS MEAN AND WHETHER THEY
WOULD ACTUALLY DETER US MAKING A
MOVE, WE BRING IN FORMER U.S.
AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS,
JOHN BOLTON.

CRUISE MISSILES LIKE THE
ONES I AM ABOUT TO SHOW YOU ARE
ONE OF THE WEAPONS IN OUR
ARSENAL.

ONE LAWMAKER SAYS THE U.S.
SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE THEM
AGAINST THE ASSAD REGIME IN THE
WAKE OF CHEMICAL ATTACK AGAINST
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS
THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WERE USED BY THE SYRIAN
REGIME AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.

HUNDREDS DIED IN LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

TODAY, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
CLAIMED THEY WILL ALLOW U.N.
INSPECTORS TO LOOK AT THE SITE
IT HAPPENED.

U.S. OFFICIALS SAY AT THIS POINT
IT IS PROBABLY TOO LATE.

ALL OF THIS HAPPENING AS
LAWMAKERS CALL FOR LIMITED
MILITARY RESPONSE, AND OTHER
WESTERN POWERS, INCLUDING
BRITAIN AND FRANCE EXPRESS GRAVE
CONCERN.

AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON, FORMER
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. AND FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

DO YOU WAIT FOR THE INSPECTORS
TO TELL US WHAT THEY FOUND THERE
AT THE DEATH SITE OR IS THE
WHITE HOUSE STALLING FOR TIME TO
MAKE A DECISION?

I DON'T THINK THE U.N.
INSPECTORS WILL FIND MUCH OF
ANYTHING.

THE SYRIAN REGIME PROBABLY
CLEANED UP THE SITES, MADE THEM
MBIGUOUS THAT
NOBODY CAN TELL WHO USE THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THEY MAY HAVE HAD RUSSIAN
ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT.

I THINK THE SYRIANS THOUGHT THEY
WERE BUYING TIME AND MAY YET,
BUT THE RHETORIC FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE IS UNDOUBTEDLY STEPPED UP.

OF COURSE, WE HAVE BEEN DOWN
THAT ROAD BEFORE AS WELL.

I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM FOR THE
UNITED STATES IS THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION IS REACTING MORE
OUT OF POLITICAL CONCERN THAN
FROM STRATEGIC THINKING.

THE PRESIDENT LOOKED VERY
FOOLISH, VERY WEAK SIX MONTHS
AGO WHEN CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE
FIRST REPORTED USED ON A LARGE
SCALE, CROSSING THE RED LINE
THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF DREW
A YEAR AGO AND THE PRESIDENT DID
NOTHING.

NOW YOU HAVE AN EVEN MORE
EGREGIOUS USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AND HE THINKS HE NEEDS
TO DO SOMETHING, BUT HE CLEARLY
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT OR FOR WHAT
PURPOSE.

THE PROBLEM IS THE RED LINE
IS THAT IT IS RED, FEW PEOPLE
WILL EVER FORGET IT.

TODAY, AMBASSADOR RAND ISSUED
THE FIRST OF TWO THREATS WE
HEARD, THE OTHER COMING FROM
RUSSIA, GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT.

IRAN SAID WE BETTER NOT TOUCH
SYRIA, PARAPHRASING IT.

SHOULD THAT BE DETERRENT FOR US?

NO, THE SYRIANS THINK
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS WEAK AND ARE
TRYING TO BULLY HIM.

IN THIS CONTEXT IT WILL HAVE THE
OPPOSITE EFFECT AND CONVINCE HIM
HE HAS TO DO SOMETHING, LOB A
COUPLE CRUISE MISSILES OR MORE
INTO SYRIA TO PROVE HE HAS,
QUOTE, UNQUOTE, DONE SOMETHING.

THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS WHAT TO
DO ABOUT IRAN.

LET'S FACE IT, THE ASSAD REGIME
AFTER TWO YEARS OF CONFLICT
WOULD NOT BE IN POWER IF IT WERE
NOT FOR RUSSIA AND IRAN, AND
PRIMARILY IRAN.

LOOKING AT SYRIA IS LOOKING AS
TRAGIC AS IT IS IS LOOKING IN A
STRATEGIC SENSE AT A SECONDARY
ISSUE.

THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE REGIME
IN IRAN.

THAT'S WHERE WE OUGHT TO DIRECT
OUR ATTENTION.

LET'S TALK ON THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF OTHER COUNTRIES
ISSUING THREATS TO AMERICA,
SHOULD IT GET INVOLVED OUTSIDE
THE BOUNDS OF THE UNITED
NATIONS.

NO ONE SAID WE WOULD DO THAT.

BUT RUSSIA TODAY ISSUING A
WARNING THAT THERE WOULD BE
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES IN THAT
REGION TO THE SECURITY IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, IF WE SHOULD
SUDDENLY USE OUR MILITARY WITH
REGARD TO SYRIA.

IN FACT, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT
REPUBLICAN OUT OF TEXAS, WHO
TALKS ABOUT THAT TENUOUS
RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH RUSSIA.

LET'S WATCH THAT AND THEN WE'LL
TALK MORE.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
WHITE HOUSE AND THE PUTIN
ADMINISTRATION IS SO BAD AND
LACKS SO MUCH CREDIBILITY THAT I
THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST.

I BELIEVE THE RUGS DON'T WANT
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED, AS DOES
THE UNITED STATES, SO WE DO HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY, I HOPE THE
PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF.

AND THE COULD YOU TELL
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN THERE.

CURIOUS OF YOUR THOUGHTS.

I THINK THEY THINK OBAMA IS
WEAK AND CAN BULLY HIM, PUSHING
ON ONE OTHER BUTTON THAT THE
PRESIDENT HIGHLIGHTED LAST WEEK
WHEN HE WONDERED WHAT HIS
INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY WAS TO
LAUNCH MILITARY ACTION.

AND THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL WHERE
RUSSIA HAS A VETO.

FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD CARE ONE
WIT WHETHER WE HAVE A SECURITY
COUNCIL RESOLUTION OR NOT.

THIS IS THINKING IN A EUROPEAN
WAY, WHO HAS AUTHORIZED ME TO DO
THIS, AS OPPOSED TO THINKING IN
THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WAY,
WHO IS PROHIBITING ME FROM DOING
THIS.

WHILE I THINK WE OUGHT TO
DISREGARD IT, I THINK THE
RUSSIANS KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S
PSYCHOLOGY AND THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO EFFECT.

CHAT ROOMS, THEY'RE SAYING
OUR NATION SHOULDN'T BE
INVOLVED, SOME OF THEM.

YOU ALSO SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE
INVOLVED THERE THE WAY WE ARE,
SYRIA IS A SECONDARY ISSUE.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

AS I SAID, THE ASSAD REGIME
WOULD NOT BE IN POWER BUT FOR
IRAN, AND WHILE PEOPLE SAY THIS
IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN DEFEAT
IRAN, THIS IS EFFECTIVELY MUCH
LESS IMPORTANT THAN IRAN'S
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW.

IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T ACT
WITH MASSIVE FORCE IN SYRIA, IF
IT IS JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST
TO THE ASSAD REGIME, WHICH MANY
ARE PREDICTING, I THINK THE
LESSON IRAN DRAWS FROM THAT WE
BETTER GET OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
CAPABILITY IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE
THEN WE WILL BE IMMUNE TO AN
AMERICAN SLAP ON THE WRIST.

ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE
PRESIDENT DOES USE MASSIVE FORCE
TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF FORCES
WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF, IT COULD
WELL RESULT IN THE OPPOSITION
TAKING POWER, WHICH I DON'T
THINK IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST
EITHER.

THAT'S WHY I STRESS I DON'T
THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HIS
OWN MIND.

I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HIS
STRATEGY IS.

I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THE
AGONIZING IS ABOUT.

VERY INTERESTING.

YOU PAINT SUCH DIFFERENT
SCENARIOS THERE.

AND I'LL CHANGE TOPICS JUST
SLIGHTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK
YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS.

SAMANTHA POWER HAS TAKEN YOUR
OLD POST AS U.S.
AMBASSADOR AT
THE U.N.
SHE WAS AWAY FOR PERSONAL
REASONS WE READ THIS WEEK,
MISSED THAT VERY IMPORTANT
EMERGENCY MEETING AT THE UNITED
NATIONS.

IT WAS ON SYRIA.

HOW UNUSUAL IS IT THAT THE
AMBASSADOR WOULD MISS A MEETING
LIKE THAT?

WELL, I THINK IT IS OKAY FOR
PEOPLE TO TAKE VACATIONS.

I THINK THAT'S FINE.

I DIDN'T TAKE A VACATION WHEN I
STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF
AUGUST OF 2005, BUT MAYBE I'M A
WORKAHOLIC.

I THINK SHE WILL BE BACK IN TIME
FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS,
GIVEN THAT PUBLICITY.

SO NO SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS
OF HOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

NOTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE ON
SYRIA IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE
UNITED NATIONS ANYWAY.

SHE PROBABLY COULD STAY IN
IRELAND ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE.

THAT IS BLUNT.
