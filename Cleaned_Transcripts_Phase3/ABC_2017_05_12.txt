AND, BREAKING NOW, THE
MASSIVE, FAST-MOVING U.S. CYBER
ATTACK. U.S. COMPANIES SHUTTING DOWN
THEIR COMPUTERS.

NEXT HERE TONIGHT TO A MAJOR
GLOBAL HEADLINE UNFOLDING AS
WE'RE ON THE AIR TONIGHT.

A MASSIVE CYBER ATTACK UNDER WAY
AT THIS HOUR.

74 COUNTRIES, AND RIGHT HERE IN
THE U.S.

EVEN HOSPITALS AMONG THEIR
TARGETS, COMPUTERS FROZEN,
SURGERIES HALTED.

AND U.S. COMPANIES ARE TAKING
ACTION.

UNFOLDS TONIGHT, THE FIRST U.S.
COMPANY TO ADMIT BEING TARGETED
IS FEDEX.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ATTACKS
AROUND THE WORLD WERE ANNOUNCED
WITH THIS MESSAGE.

WHOOPS, YOUR IMPORTANT FILES ARE
ENCRYPTED.

WITH A FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE, PAY
YOUR RANSOM OR LOSE YOUR FILES.

THE REASON THIS IS HITTING SO
MANY COMPUTERS AT ONCE, THEY
DISCOVERED A VULNERABILITY IN
THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD, IN
MICROSOFT WINDOWS, AND THEY'RE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT.

THE SINGLE BIGGEST RANSOMWARE
ATTACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE
INTERNET.

IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL ATTACK,
AND A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN
AFFECTED.

COMPUTERS OF HOSPITALS.

SOME CANCELLING SURGERIES.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT CAME THAT ALL
THE COMPUTERS WOULD BE DOWN
UNTIL AT LEAST MONDAY.

LACK OF ACCESS TO PATIENT
RECORDS, DOCTORS FEAR LIVES
COULD BE AT RISK.

BRIAN, SOURCES TELLING YOU
OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. ARE
SCRAMBLING TO CONTAIN THIS?

THAT'S RIGHT.

OFFICIALS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS
MET LATE TODAY TO SEE WHAT THEY
CAN DO TO STOP IT.

AND THE IRONY IS, THE ATTACKS
ARE BASED IN PART ON TOOLS
DEVELOPED BY U.S.
INTELLIGENCE TO PENETRATE
ENEMIES, AND NOW THEY ARE BEING
TURNED AGAINST US.
