I KNOW THAT WIND IS A LOT OUT TO
THERE BUT IT'S GOING TO CALM
DOWN FOR US.

HOLD ON TO YOUR CAP AND GOWN.

A VIEW WE HAVEN'T SEEN UNTIL NOW
OF THE OKLAHOMA NEIGHBORHOOD AND
SCHOOL THAT TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

ALSO HOW SO MANY PEOPLE SURVIVED
BY HIDING AND RIDING IT OUT IN
SOME UNUSUAL PLACES.

WE ARE JUST BACK FROM MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, WHERE LIFE WON'T BE
NORMAL FOR YEARS, WHERE THE
EARTH HAS BEEN WIPED CLEAN IN
SOME PLACES, AND WHERE THE DEATH
TOLL STANDS STILL AT 24, 324
PEOPLE INJURED, TEN CHILDREN
INCLUDING TWO INFANTS ARE AMONG
THE DEAD.

CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THEY
HAVE COUNTED UP 13,000 HOMES IN
THE PATH OF THIS ONE STORM, SOME
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING
BOTH THANKS AND SURPRISE THAT
THE TOLL WASN'T EVEN HIGHER.

FOLLOWING THE RAREST OF ALL
TORNADOES, THE EF5, THE MOST
POWERFUL ON EARTH.

TODAY WE LEARN HOW AND WHERE SO
MANY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO HIDE,
RIDE IT OUT, AND SURVIVE THIS
ONE.

THE FIGURE YOU MENTIONED, 13,000
HOMES IN THE PATH, THAT'S
DESTROYED OR BADLY DAMAGED.

THAT'S A HUGE IMPACT IN A TOWN
OF ONLY 56,000.

IMAGINE THAT.

$2 BILLION IN DAMAGE AND THIS
TOWN IS STILL BEGINNING TO
ACCEPT, UNDERSTAND, AND GRIEVE
THE LOSS OF SO MANY WHO LIVE
HERE AS WE LEARN MORE NAMES OF
THE DEAD.

AT THE SAME TIME, FOLKS CONTINUE
TO MARVEL THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
WALKED OUT OF WRECKAGE LIKE THIS
ALIVE.

I HOPE EVERYONE'S OKAY.

THE MASSIVE FUNNEL MAKES IT
HARDER TO COMPREHEND HOW SO MANY
PEOPLE SURVIVED.

IT'S A QUESTION MIKE SOTO HAS
WRESTLED WITH SINCE HE WAS
PULLED FROM UNDER HIS HOUSE ON
MONDAY.

CLOSET WHEN HIS HOUSE FELL IN
AROUND HIM.

TRAPPED HE SCRAPED A METAL WIRE
THROUGH AN OPENING TO ATTRACT
HIS NEIGHBORS' ATTENTION.

I COULD HEAR THE VOICES
SAYING, MAKE A NOISE, KEEP
MAKING NOISE BECAUSE THEY COULD
NOT FIND ME.

FINALLY THEY FOUND ME.

HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.

AMONG THEM 65-YEAR-OLD HEMMET
BONDI.

SWEPT AWAY AS HE HUDDLED IN A
BATHROOM WITH HIS WIFE.

THEN THE CHILDREN KILLED AT
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
LIKE BEST FRIENDS AN TONE I
CAN'T CANDELARIA AND EMILY
CONATZER.

THEY REPORTEDLY DIED HOLDING
ONTO EACH OTHER.

EMILY'S MOTHER POSTED ON
FACEBOOK, I KNOW SHE IS IN
HEAVEN SMILING DOWN.

THE FATHER OF JENAE HORNSBY
ANOTHER THIRD GRADER, SPOKE OF
THE SEARCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

I WAS JUST HOPING MAYBE SHE
MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN
UNCONSCIOUS.

I HOPED SHE WAS ALIVE.

FIRSTHAND LOOK AT THE
DEVASTATION INSIDE THE SCHOOL,
AND THE TOLL IT TOOK ON FIRST
RESPONDERS.

ONCE WE HAVE THE FIRST
RESPONDERS THAT COME IN CONTACT
WITH THE BODIES, ESPECIALLY
CHILDREN, THEY ARE OFFERED
DIFFERENT COUNSELING.

OTHERS DIDN'T.

THE TINKER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION
BEFORE THE TORNADO AND AFTER.

THE HEAVILY REINFORCED VAULT IS
ALL THAT'S STANDING.

IT IS WHERE JAN DAVIS AND
THERESA PRICE TOOK COVER WITH 20
OTHERS.

EVEN THROUGH THE CLOSED DOOR
YOU COULD HEAR THE
DISINTEGRATION OF WHAT WE ARE
STANDING IN NOW.

THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN ANY OF OUR
MINDS THAT THE BUILDING WAS GONE
ON THE OUTSIDE.

TO ME THAT WAS THE ONLY
OPTION.

HEARD AN INTERIOR ROOM WAS THE
FASTEST PLACE TO SHELTER IN A
PINCH.

HE AND HIS WIFE CHOSE THIS
CLOSET.

ALL I HEARD WAS A -- AND IT
WAS QUIET.

I SAT THERE -- WE SAT THERE FOR
A BIT.

HALF HIS HOUSE AND MOST OF HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS GONE.

FEW HOMES IN THIS CORNER OF
TORNADO ALLEY HAVE STORM CELLARS
OR SAFE ROOMS.

TODAY, TOWN OFFICIALS PROPOSED
THE IDEA OF MAKING THEM
MANDATORY FOR NEW HOMES.

IF YOU ASK MOST PEOPLE OUT
THERE, THEY ARE GOING TO REBUILD
AND PROBABLY GET A STORM
SHELTER.

CONCERN HERE, CLEANING UP AS
HEAVY EQUIPMENT CREWS MOVED IN
TODAY, SO DID AN ARMY OF
VOLUNTEERS, LOADED WITH RAKES,
SHOVELS, AND BIG HEARTS.

THIS IS WHAT BEING OKLAHOMAN
IS ABOUT.

YOU HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND
FAMILY.

IT'S CALLED OKLAHOMA STRONG.

LAST DAY OF SCHOOL IN MOORE.

BRIAN, KIDS WHO ATTEND SCHOOLS
THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED HAVE
BEEN ENCOURAGED TO GO TO OTHER
SCHOOLS SO THEY CAN AT LEAST
CLOSE OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH
THEIR CLASSMATES.

WHEN WE COME BACK, A MESSAGE
OF HOPE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW
WHAT THE PEOPLE IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, ARE IN FOR.

FINALLY TONIGHT I HAVE HERE
WITH ME ON THE DESK A BRICK FROM
JOPLIN HIGH SCHOOL.

THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE A
FEW OF THESE OUT TO VARIOUS
FOLKS WITH TIES TO THAT
COMMUNITY.

THE BRICKS ARE A CHERISHED
SYMBOL OF ALL THAT WAS LOST TWO
YEARS AGO TODAY WHEN AN EF5
TWISTER TORE UP JOPLIN INCLUDING
THE HIGH SCHOOL.

A THIRD OF THE TOWN WAS
DESTROYED.

162 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

NOW SOME OF JOPLIN'S FIRST
RESPONDERS HAVE GONE TO MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, TO HELP OUT.

BACK IN JOPLIN, THE FOLKS ARE
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE
LEARNED THESE PAST TWO YEARS.

EMERGING IN JOPLIN, ONE THAT
LOOKS ALMOST NOTHING LIKE THIS
22-MILE PATH OF DESTRUCTION.

DEVASTATION IS A SHORT WHILE,
BUT DETERMINATION LASTS ALL THE
TIME.

BACK STRONGER.

BETHANY FIRST SHARED HER STORY
OF SURVIVAL WITH BRIAN AFTER SHE
AND HER HUSBAND DON RODE OUT THE
TORNADO IN THIS BATHTUB.

HE GOT ON TOP OF ME TO TAKE
THE BRUNT OF MOST OF IT.

AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S MY HERO.

BUT HE DIDN'T SURVIVE.

TWO YEARS LATER, THE VOID
REMAINS, BUT BETHANY IS GRATEFUL
FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

I GET TO SAY THANK YOU FOR --
LETTING ME HAVE THIS LIFE.

BUT I GET TO LIVE IT FOR HIM,
TOO.

INCLUDES A 4-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER
WHO BETHANY CALLS HER
INSPIRATION.

THERE IS PLENTY OF INSPIRATION
TO BE FOUND HERE.

NEARLY 90% OF AFFECTED
BUSINESSES ARE NOW OPEN.

75% OF HOMES HAVE BEEN REBUILT,
AND 80% OF NEW HOMES NOW INCLUDE
A SAFE ROOM.

MERCY HOSPITAL, A NEW FACILITY
WILL OPEN IN 2015 WITH WALLS AND
WINDOWS BUILT TO WITHSTAND 250
MILE AN HOUR WINDS.

ITS ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS SECURELY
BURIED UNDER GROUND.

JOPLIN IS A CITY OF HOPE.

WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
SUFFER, BUT WE ALSO KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO GET BACK UP.

TRY TO SAY THE RIGHT THINGS
THAT CAN COME EVEN WHENEVER IT
DOESN'T SEEM THERE COULD BE
ANOTHER BRIGHT DAY.

CELEBRATE AS THIS TOWN REBUILDS,
BUT IT IS THE STRENGTH OF ITS
PEOPLE THAT IS THE TRUE MEASURE
OF SUCCESS.
