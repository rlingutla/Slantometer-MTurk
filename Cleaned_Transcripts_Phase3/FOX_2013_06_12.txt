PLUS, NEW FROM THE LEAKER.

ED SNOWDEN SAYS THE U.S. IS
WAGING CYBER WAR ON CHINA,
HAS BEEN FOR YEARS AND HE
CAN PROVE IT.

EDWARD SNOWDEN REPORTEDLY
CLAIMS THE U.S. HAS BEEN
HACKING CHINESE COMPUTERS
FOR YEARS.

NOW HE SAYS HE IS READY TO
FACE JUSTICE IN HONG KONG.

I THINK THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT WILL GO AFTER
GET A CHANCE TO QUESTION
THE HEAD OF THE NSA.

THE NSA OBTAINED PHONE
RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF
INNOCENT AMERICANS WITH NO
CONNECTION TO TERRORISM.

IF DOZEN OF TERRORIST
EVENTS THAT THESE ARE
HELPED PREVENT.

FIGHT FOR AN ADULT LUNG
TRANSPLANT FINALLY GETS THE
SURGERY THAT COULD SAVE HER
LIFE.

BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS
WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THE NSA
LEAKER HAS APPARENTLY
RESURFACED.

SOMEWHERE IN HONG KONG ED
SNOWDEN REPORTEDLY SPOKE
WITH THE SOUTH CHINA
MORNING POST NEWSPAPER
TODAY AND CLAIMS THE UNITED
STATES HAS BEEN HACKING
CHINA'S COMPUTERS FOR
YEARS.

HE SAYS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
HAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
SPY OPERATIONS GOING ON
AROUND THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,
61000 TO BE EXACT.

AND JUST HOURS AFTER THE
NEW SNOWDEN INTERVIEW
POPPED UP IN THE PAPER, THE
HEAD OF THE SECRETIVE
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
TESTIFIED ON CAPITOL HILL.

GENERAL KEITH ALEXANDER
SAYS GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS HAVE
HELPED PREVENT DOZENS OF
TERROR ATTACKS.

THE SENATORS DID NOT OBJECT
TO MONITORING SPECIFIC
TERRORIST SUSPECTS.

SOME DID ASK WHY IS THE
GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING THE
PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS
OF INNOCENT AMERICANS?

IF YOU KNEW THAT A
SUSPECT HAD MADE A CALL
INTO AREA CODE 312, THE
CITY OF CHICAGO, IT
CERTAINLY DEFIES LOGIC THAT
YOU NEED TO COLLECT AWFUL
OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS MADE
IN THE 312 AREA CODE ON THE
CHANCE THAT ONE OF THOSE
PERSONS MIGHT BE ON THE
OTHER END OF THE PHONE.

SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
DON'T KNOW HE IS IN 312
YET?

BECAUSE WE HAD STORED THAT
DATA IN A DATABASE WE
COULD TAKE THAT NUMBER AND
GO BACKWARDS IN TIME AND
SEE WHO HE WAS TALKING TO.

DECLASSIFY SOME OF THE
INFORMATION SO HE CAN TELL
ALL THE US ABOUT HOW THE
SURVEILLANCE WORKS.

HE SAYS IF THE GOVERNMENT
RELEASES TOO MANY DETAILS,
QUOTE  AMERICANS WILL DIE.

LOTS TO COVER ON THIS.

WHAT ELSE DID WE LEARN AT
THESE HEARINGS TODAY,
CATHERINE.

SHEP, WHILE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP AND
OFFICIALS CLAIM THE
SWEEPING COLLECTION OF DATA
DISRUPTED A 2009 PLOT
TARGETING THE NEW YORK CITY
SUBWAY SYSTEM BY BULL AZAZI
CONCEDED TO PATRICK LEAHY
THAT WAS SIMPLY NOT THE
CASE.

THE LEAD CAME FROM FOREIGN
SOURCES.

WITH A 702 SET OF
INFORMATION, BASED ON
OPERATIVES OVERSEAS WE SAW
CONNECTIONS INTO A PERSON
IN COLORADO.

THAT WAS PASSED TO THE FBI.

AND WHILE ALEXANDER SAID
THE DRILLDOWN ON AMERICAN
CITIZENS MUST BE CLEARED BY
A NATIONAL SECURITY COURT,
SENATORS SAYING IT WASN'T
ENOUGH GIVEN THE PERVASIVE
ENVIRONMENT OF MISTRUST.

THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS
FEARFUL THAT IN THIS
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA YOU
GET, THAT THERE IS THE
ABILITY OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TO SYNTHESIZE
THAT DATA AND LEARN
SOMETHING MORE.

ON THURSDAY, A RARE
BRIEFING OF THE FULL SENATE
ON THE NSA DATA COLLECTION
PROGRAMS ALEXANDER WILL
TESTIFY AGAIN.

THIS SESSION IS CLASSIFIED
AND CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC
TODAY WE LEARNED THE DEPUTY
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA
RESIGNED.

WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

MIKE MORELL AFTER 33 YEARS
WITH THE AGENCY.

IT WAS MADE SOME TIME AGO.

HE WAS CENTER HE OF THE
TALKING POINTS CONTROVERSY.

THE ADMINISTRATION
ULTIMATELY BLAMED THE CIA
FOR PROVIDING BAD
INFORMATION TO THEN
AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE WHO
BLAMED A DEMONSTRATION THAT
SPUN OUT OF CONTROL FOR THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.

MORE RELATIVE'S MORRELL'S
REPLACEMENT WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

HAINES APPARENTLY HAS NO
EXPERIENCE AT THE CIA BUT
SERVED AS DEPUTY ASSISTANT
TO THE PRESIDENT AND LEGAL
ADVISOR TO THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL.

THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT
MORRELL'S RESIGNATION IS
NOT AT ALL CONNECTED TO
THESE NSA SCANDALS, SHEP.

THE NSA DIRECTOR IS ALSO
DEBUNKING ONE OF SNOWDEN'S
PREVIOUS CLAIMS.

HERE, REMEMBER THIS?

I SITTING AT MY DESK
CERTAINLY HAVE THE
AUTHORITIES TO WIRETAP
ANYONE FROM YOU OR YOUR
ACCOUNTANT TO IT A FEDERAL
JUDGE TO EVEN THE
PRESIDENT.

FALSE.

I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DO
REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS
NEWSCAST ED SNOWDEN IS
APPARENTLY MAKING NEW
CLAIMS ABOUT THE U.S.

ATTACKING CHINESE
COMPUTERS.

QUOTING  WE HACK NETWORK
BACK BONES LIKE HUGE
INTERNET ROUTERS THAT GIVE
US ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS
WITHOUT HAVING TO HACK
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

ED SNOWDEN SAYS HUNDREDS OF
THOSE HACKING TARGETS ARE
IN HONG KONG AND CHINA'S
MAINLAND INCLUDING
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND
PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING
POST NEWSPAPER REPORTS
SNOWDEN PROVIDED UNVERIFIED
DOCUMENTS TO PROVE HIS
STORY.

DOES HE EXPLAIN WHY HE
ACCUSED THE UNITED STATES
OF TARGETING COMPUTERS ALL
OVER THE WORLD?

WELL BECAUSE HE SAYS
THAT AMERICA HAS LONG SAID
THAT IT DOES NOT TARGET
CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE
UNLIKE ITS ADVERSARIES,
SHEP.

HE CALLS THAT BLATANT
HYPOCRISY SAYING AND I'M
QUOTING HERE, NOT ONLY DOES
IT DO SO BUT IT IS SO
AFRAID OF IT BEING KNOWN
THAT IT IS WILLING TO USE
ANY MEANS SUCH AS
DIPLOMATIC INTIMIDATION TO
PREVENT THIS INFORMATION
FROM BECOMING PUBLIC MUCH
THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS
ASKED TODAY ABOUT TARGETING
FOREIGN COMPUTERS AND
RESPONDED THIS WAY.

LISTEN.

THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN, YOU KNOW GOING
AFTER ECONOMIC DATA AND
FINANCIAL INFORMATION, THAT
IS PART OF THE CYBER
ATTACKS.

OR SEEMS TO BE.

AND AN ISSUE WHICH THE
PRESIDENT WELCOMES THE
DEBATE ON AND THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS WELCOMED
THE DEBATE ON WHICH IS
SURVEILLANCE.

AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO
MEAN TO DO HARM.

SO HER RESPONSE WASN'T
EXACTLY CRYSTAL CLEAR
SHEP.

EVEN EDWARD SNOWDEN ADMITS
HE HAS NO INFORMATION AT
ALL ABOUT ANY CHINESE
MILITARY TECHNOLOGY.

SHEP?

TIME HE WANTS TO.

YEAH, HE SAID HE HAD
MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FLEE
BUT, INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO
STAY AND FIGHT.

AND IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH
THE CHINESE NEWSPAPER HE
IS CLEARLY TRYING TO PAINT
HIMSELF AS THE GOOD GUY
HERE.

SAYING TO THE NEWSPAPER,
AND I'M QUOTING AGAIN
LAST WEEK THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT HAPPILY OPERATED
IN THE SHADOWS WITH NO
RESPECT FOR THE CONSENT OF
THE GOVERNED.

BUT NO LONGER.

EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY IS
DEMANDINGLITY
AND OVERSIGHT.

FOR NOW, HE IS STILL IN
HIDING BUT FORMER CIA AGENT
MIKE BAKER SAYS NOT FOR
LONG.

EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS
TRAINED.

EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS
BEEN IN OPERATIONS FOR A
LONG TIME, JUST
DISAPPEARING, GOING OFF THE
RADAR SCREEN ENTIRELY IS A
VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

IT'S MORE DIFFICULT WHEN
YOU NOW HAVE BEEN IN THE
MEDIA AND EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOUR FACE AND YOUR
BACKGROUND STORY.

MIKE BAKER ALSO BELIEVES AS
SOON AS THE UNITED STATES
WANTS HIM THEY WILL GET
HIM.

TRACE THAT NEWSPAPER
THE SOUTH CHINA POST
REPORTS IT CONTACTED THE
U.S. CONSULATE IN HONG KONG
FOR A RESPONSE TO ED
SNOWDEN'S CLAIMS BUT IT WAS
CLOSED FOR A CHINESE
HOLIDAY.

ACCORDING TO A CONSULATE
WEB SITE IT CLOSES FOR
CHINESE AND AMERICAN
HOLIDAYS.

FIRST QUESTION ASKED HOW
FOLKS FEEL ABOUT THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
LEADERS.

71% SAY WE CAN DO BETTER.

MEASLY 71% SAY WE ARE
CONFIDENT AND PROUD.

HOW MUCH TRUST DO YOU HAVE
IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

5% SAY THEY HAVE A GREAT
DEAL OF CONFIDENCE.

63% SAY EITHER NOT THAT
MUCH OR NOT AT ALL.

ED HENRY HAS THAT LIVE FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE.

ED?

WELL, SHEP OBVIOUSLY
THE BACK DROP FOR ALL OF
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S
POLITICAL STANDING AND THE
FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE
CONTROVERSIES LIKE THE IRS
TARGETING CONSERVATIVE
GROUPS HAS HELPED FUEL THIS
ANGER TOWARDS THE
GOVERNMENT.

LOOK AT THE SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM AT THE NSA AS WELL
AND HOW THAT IS EFFECTING
THINGS.

WHEN WE ASKED WHETHER OR
NOT IT'S ACCEPTABLE
UNACCEPTABLE INVADES
PRIVACY 62%.

ACCEPTABLE, PREVENTS
TERRORISM WHICH IS THE CASE
THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING
ONLY 32% BUYING THAT RIGHT
NOW.

THE OTHER BIG STORY, OF
COURSE, THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT MONITORING
REPORTERS.

AND THEIR PHONE
RECORDS.

LOOK AT WHAT THE PUBLIC
THINKS ABOUT THAT.

WAS THIS DONE FOR POLITICAL
REASONS?

63%.

WAS IT DONOR FUTURE
REASONS ONLY 29%.

THAT IS PUTTING NEW
PRESSURE TONIGHT ON ERIC
HOLDER, THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

HE HAS BEEN IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS STORM OBVIOUSLY.

WE ASKED IN THIS POLL WHAT
ABOUT ERIC HOLDER'S FUTURE?

ONLY 34% SAYING HE SHOULD
STAY ON THE JOB.

52% SAYING HE SHOULD
RESIGN.

SO A SMALL MAJORITY THERE.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WHAT
THESE CONTROVERSIES ADD UP
TO FOR THE PRESIDENT RIGHT
NOW IS A PUBLIC THAT WAS
ALREADY DISTRUSTFUL OF THE
GOVERNMENT MAYBE MORE SO
NOW BECAUSE OF THESE
CONTROVERSIES AND A
PRESIDENT TRYING TO GET THE
NATION'S ATTENTION ON
IMMIGRATION REFORM, A
BUDGET DEAL, OTHER THINGS
BEYOND THESE CONTROVERSIES,
BIT OF POLLING, THE POLLS
SHOW THE MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS ARE NOT YET
SATISFIED WITH THE A SENSE
THEY HAVE HEARD REGARDING
THREE MAJOR CONTROVERSIES.

WHEN ASKED MORE THAN 70%
SAY THEY THINK CONGRESS
SHOULD CONTINUE TO
INVESTIGATE THE IRS, THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND
BENGHAZI RESPECTIVELY.

LAWMAKERS SAY FEWER PEOPLE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR
HANDS ON THE GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE DATA AFTER THESE
NEW HIGH PROFILE LEAKS.

BUT WE'RE LEARNING HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTORS ARE
ABLE TO ACCESS TOP SECRET
SECURITY INFORMATION.

MORE THAN HALF A MILLION
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS HAVE SOME
KIND OF SECURITY CLEARANCE.

OF COURSE A FORMER NSA
CONTRACTOR JUST BLEW THE LID OFF
TWO GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS AND ARE THREATENING TO
DO MORE.

NOW SOME SAY IT MAY BE TIME TO
LOOK AT OTHER CLEARANCES.

MICHAEL DANIEL IN THE D.C.
TONIGHT, MIKE?

OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
REQUESTED BILLIONS TO SPEND ON
CYBER APP AND TODAY THEY ASK THE
NSA CHIEF, HOW THE HECK DOES
THIS HAPPEN.

WHY DOES A CONTRACTOR HAVE
ACCESS TO INFORMATION WE ARE
SPENDING $13 BILLION TO PREVENT
OUTSIDERS FROM GETTING THEIR
HANDS ON.

THAT'S ONE OF THE GRAVE
CONCERNS WE HAVE THAT IN OUR
NETWORKS, THE SYSTEM
ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE
NETWORKS, I.T.

INFRASTRUCTURE
WAS OUTSOURCED ABOUT 14 YEARS
AGO TO MOVE MORE PUSH MORE OF
OUR WORK OUT TO CONTRACTORS.

TODAY DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAID
SHE WAS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF
CONTRACTORS AND THEIR ACCESS TO
HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
BUT AN EXPERT SAYS THE CHALLENGE
FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE'S
SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH WALL
STREET AND SILICON VALLEY FOR
THE BEST TECHNICAL MINDS.

THIS IS ELECTRONICS AND
TECHNOLOGY.

THE MORE NEED YOU HAVE FOR
REALLY HIGH END CAPABLE
TECHNOLOGY SKILLS.

AND THAT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS
WHERE THOSE SKILLS ARE.

BUT THIS ISSUE HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

AND HE NOTES THE PROCESS OF
GETTING A SECURITY CLEARANCE IS
THE SAME WHETHER YOU'RE A
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE OR A
CONTRACTOR.
