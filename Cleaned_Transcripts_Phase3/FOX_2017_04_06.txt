MOMENTS AGO, SECRETARY OF STATE
TILLERSON SAID THE SECOND MAJOR
SIGNAL OF AN AMERICAN POLICY
CHANGE TOWARDS SYRIA.

HE SAID THE UNITED STATES IS
ORGANIZING AN INTERNATIONAL
COALITION TO RESPOND TO BASHAR
AL-ASSAD'S CHEMICAL ATTACK ON
HIS OWN PEOPLE.


DOES THIS MEAN AMERICAN MILITARY
ACTION IN SYRIA?

THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO, YOU
SAW WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE
SHIFT IN UNITED STATES POLICY
TOWARDS SYRIA.

THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR.

THE SYRIAN LEADER, BASHAR
AL-ASSAD, BY ALL INTERNATIONAL
OBSERVATION HAS MURDERED
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN
PEOPLE BY USING BARREL BOMBS AND
ALL KINDS OF EXPLOSIONS THE LAST
MANY YEARS.

THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THERE WAS
VIDEO OF A CHEMICAL ATTACK, A
SARIN GAS ATTACK, ONE
PERPETRATED BY BASHAR AL-ASSAD
HIMSELF AND IT APPEARS THE
POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS
CHANGED IN AN ENORMOUS WAY.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT
THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
RESPOND.

IS MILITARY ACTION, BOOTS ON THE
GROUND AHEAD FOR THE UNITED
STATES IN SYRIA?

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

THE RUSSIANS AND THE IRANIANS
ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

IT'S BREAKING NEWS AND IT'S
NEXT.

FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TO BASHAR
AL-ASSAD HAS CHANGED.

IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES, ANOTHER
SIGN.

SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON
ANNOUNCING THAT "STEPS ARE
UNDERWAY TO ORGANIZE AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, FROM
POWER FOLLOWING THIS WEEK'S
APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK IN THE
WAR-TORN COUNTRY."

REGIME CHANGE.

THAT'S BRAND NEW.

THIS REPRESENTS AN ENORMOUS
DEPARTURE FROM DAYS AGAINST WHEN
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE SYRIANS
SHOULD DECIDE.

THEN IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO
TRY TO REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD
FROM POWER AND THAT THE FOCUS
SHOULD BE ON DEFEATING ISIS.

NOW WE LEARNED THAT SYRIA'S
FOREIGN MINISTER HAS DENIED THAT
HIS GOVERNMENT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
WEAPONS IN  ATTACKS.

86 PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING DOZENS
OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

THEY SAID THE POISON GAS ATTACK
INJURED HUNDREDS MORE.

RUSSIA IS A KEY ALLY OF
AL-ASSAD.

THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH
THE SYRIANS.

THE IRANIANS ARE IN THE MIX
SUPPORTING HEZBOLLAH.

A SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A REBEL
FACTORY.

SO THE RUSSIANS SAY IT HAPPENED
THE OTHER WAY.

THE AMERICANS SAY IT HAPPENED
ANOTHER.

THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THIS SIDE,
THE AMERICANS ARE ON THE OTHER.

IN THE SENDER IS BASHAR
AL-ASSAD.

THE RUSSIANS HAVE PROPPED HIM
UP.

THE RUSSIANS SAY THAT BASHAR
AL-ASSAD SHOULD STAY IN POWER.

THE RUSSIANS ARE SUPPORTING HIM.

THE AMERICANS JUST SAID WE'RE
ORGANIZING A COALITION TO TAKE
HIM OUT.

THAT MEANS THE UNITED STATES
WITH SYRIAN REBELS AGAINST THE
SYRIANS, THE RUSSIANS AND THE
IRANIANS THAT SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.

SO FAR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MANY
OTHER WORLD LEADERS SAY THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS FLATLY TO
BLAME.

THE TRUTH IS, THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MURDERING
ITS OWN PEOPLE FOR YEARS.

BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

THESE PICTURES ARE NEW.

THIS INCIDENT IS NEW.

THIS SITUATION IS VERY OLD.

THEY DROPPED BARREL BOMBS FROM
THE SKY AND MURDERS CHILDREN IN
THEIR BEDS ON A DAILY BASIS.

BUT THESE PICTURES AND THIS
INCIDENT IS NEW ALONG WITH THIS
PRESIDENT AND HIS ENTOURAGE.

NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE
HORRIBLE IMAGES FROM THIS WEEK'S
ATTACK MADE HIM CHANGE HIS
ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD.

IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

YOU SEE BABIES DEAD FROM GAS AND
A VERY HEINOUS FORM OF GAS,
WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE
ACCESS, TO IT'S BAD STUFF.

REALLY BAD.

SAID THAT THE AL-ASSAD REGIME'S
ACTIONS CANNOT BE TOLERATED.

AND NOW VLADIMIR PUTIN IS
ACCUSING PRESIDENT TRUMP OF
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

THE RUSSIANS SAYING ONE THING
AND THE AMERICANS SAYING
ANOTHER.

THE AMERICANS ORGANIZING A
COALITION TO SETTLE IT ALL.

HERE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE
REX TILLERSON SAID 30 MINUTES
AGO.

OBVIOUSLY THE EVENTS THAT
HAVE OCCURRED IN SYRIA WITH THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK HERE IN
THE PAST DAY HAVE JUST I THINK
HORRIFIED ALL OF US AND BROUGHT
TO THE FRONT PAGES INTO OUR
TELEVISION SCREENS AS WELL.

THE TRAGEDY THAT IS PART OF THE
SYRIAN CONFLICT.

THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS
AND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE
SUPPORTS THAT SYRIA, THE SYRIAN
REGIME ON ORDERS OF PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL-ASSAD ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS ATTACK.

AND I THINK FURTHER IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT THAT THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT CONSIDER CAREFULLY
THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE
ASSAD REGIME.

FOR THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SAID
WE WOULD WELCOME A MORE
CONSIDERED APPROACH.

IT IS A PERILOUS SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES NOW.

THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN
SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD FOR A LONG
TIME.

AL-ASSAD HAS BEEN MURDERING HIS
OWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME.

HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS HAVE
BEEN IN ON THAT EFFORT FOR A
LONG TIME AS THE UNITED STATES
SUPPORTS THE REBELS.

NOW THE QUESTION IS, DO WE
LAUNCH WITH A COALITION THAT HAS
BEEN SUGGESTED A MILITARY STRIKE
TO REMOVE THE MURDEROUS DICTATOR
FROM THAT COUNTRY?

IF SO, WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS?

WHO FILLS THE VOID THAT BASHAR
AL-ASSAD HAS HELD.

THOSE ARE THE VERY BIG QUESTIONS
THAT HAVE JUST ARISEN ON AN
ENORMOUS NEWS DAY.

RICH EDSON WITH ANALYSIS WITH
A.B.

STODDARD.

THAT'S NEXT ON A THURSDAY ON THE
 WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FOR THIS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK WHICH
VIOLATES ALL PREVIOUS U.N.

RESOLUTIONS, VIOLATES
INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND
LONG-HELD AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
PARTIES INCLUDING SYRIAN REGIME,
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND ALL
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE U.N.
SECURITY COUNCIL.

IT'S A SERIOUS MATTER.

IT REQUIRES A SERIOUS RESPONSE.

PEOPLE IS A WAR CRIME.

BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE SYRIAN
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, HAS
BEEN MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FOR YEARS.

NOW 30 MINUTES AGO WE LEARNED
THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARING
TO TAKE ACTION.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS
THAT STEPS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE
UNITED STATES TO LEAD AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD FROM
POWER.

JUST A WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY
OF STATE ASKED ABOUT THIS IN
TURKEY.

HIS RESPONSE TO THAT WAS THAT IT
IS UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO
DECIDE THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF
BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

SO THIS CHEMICAL ATTACK
REPRESENTING A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN
THE POSITION, MUCH MORE DETAILED
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND
SECRETARY TILLERSON THAN HE
SPOKE ABOUT A WEEK AGO IN
TURKEY.

THIS IS AS THE SECRETARY SAYS
THERE'S NO DOUBT THE REGIME OF
BASHAR AL-ASSAD IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CHEMICAL ATTACK THIS
WEEK ON HIS OWN CITIZENS.

THERE'S RUSSIA ANGLE AS YOU HAVE
DISCUSSED.

THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT
RUSSIA NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT ITS
SUPPORT FOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND
THIS IS ONE WEEK AHEAD OF
SECRETARY OF STATE REX
TILLERSON'S VISIT TO MOSCOW
WHERE HE WILL MEET WITH THE
STATE DEPARTMENT THERE.

OFFICIALS SAY THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK WILL COLOR THOSE
DISCUSSIONS.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAY
THAT THE UNITED STATES WITH
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
STILL EXPLORE A RELATIONSHIP
WORKING TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA ON
AREAS THAT BENEFIT THE UNITED
STATES.

THIS ALL COMING ONE WEEK AHEAD
OF THAT VISIT, SHEP, AS THE
SECRETARY OF STATE SPEAKING AT
LENGTH ABOUT SYRIA PREVIOUS TO
THIS SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS
ALREADY IN DISCUSSIONS, TALKING
ABOUT A POST AL-ASSAD SYRIA AND
AS YOU PLAYED LEADING INTO OUR
DISCUSSION HERE, THAT THE U.S.
IS LEAVING A NUMBER OF OPTIONS
ON THE TABLE IN RESPONDING TO
THIS.

PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVEN AS A
LIST OF BAD OPTIONS.

HE CHOSE THE BAD OPTION THAT WAS
TO REMAIN OUT OF THIS CONFLICT
LARGELY.

WE'VE HAD VERY BAD RESULTS.

THERE'S NO QUESTIONING THIS.

NOW AS A PATTERN BY AL-ASSAD
CONTINUES, THIS PRESIDENT HAS
MADE ANOTHER DECISION.

SHEP, YOU POINT OUT CORRECTLY
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A
LONG TIME.

PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW THERE WERE
CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN THE PAST,
THAT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS
PRESIDENT HAD BEEN BUTCHERING
HIS OWN CIVILIANS TO THE TUNE OF
500,000 PEOPLE OVER SEVEN YEARS.

RE LENTLESSLY.

THIS IS A VERY BIG CHANGE OF
MIND AFTER THE ATTACK.

ALTHOUGH THE IMAGES ARE
GRUESOME, THE ATTACKS HAVE NOT
CHANGED.

SO THE QUESTION IS NOT THAT
THERE'S JUST A RUSSIAN ANGLE
HERE, THE RUSSIAN PART IS
EVERYTHING.

TILLERSON GOES TO MOSCOW TO TRY
TO KEEP AN AVENUE OPEN ON ISSUES
THAT WE CAN WORK ON WITH THE
RUSSIANS.

THEY ARE BACKING THIS BRUTAL
DICTATOR WHO IS MURDERING HIS
PEOPLE AND DON'T INTEND TO BACK
DOWN.

THEY'RE MAKING EQUIVOCATING
COMMENTS TODAY THAT IF IT WASN'T
REALLY AN ATTACK, A ACCIDENTAL
ATTACK ON A WEAPONS FACTORY RUN
BY THE REBELS, THAT WOULD BE OUT
OF THE NORMS.

THEY THINK THE U.N. SHOULD DO AN
INVESTIGATION.

WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN BACKING
THIS REGIME, FIGHTING ITS OWN
PEOPLE, NOT ISIS.

SO AT THIS POINT, WHAT IS
PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTING OF THE
RUSSIANS?

ARE WE GOING TO GO TO WAR
AGAINST THEM OR ARE WE GOING TO
TRY TO COAX THE RUSSIANS INTO
DEPOSING AL-ASSAD WITH US?

THAT IS EVERYTHING IN THIS
EQUATION.

WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE
RUSSIANS.

WHAT DO THE ADMINISTRATION
THINKS THEY CAN GET THE RUSSIANS
TO DO?

WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT THE
UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF
THE WEST TO BACK OFF ON THEIR
ANNEXATION, THEIR INVASION AND
ANNEXING OF CRIMEA.

WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT NATO'S
FRONT NOT TO BE SO CLOSE TO THE
RUSSIANS.

THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF DESIRES.

IT'S A MATTER OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE
WILLING TO GIVE.

IF WE GAVE THEM ALL OF THOSE
CONCESSIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE,
THEY WOULD -- PUTIN IS ENJOYING
A SUPREMACY THAT HE'S NEVER HAD
BEFORE.

HE RESCUED PRESIDENT OBAMA IN
2013 SO THAT HE COULD RETREAT
FROM HIS THREAT OF AIR STRIKES
WITH THIS DEAL HE NEGOTIATED TO
GET ALL THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS OUT
OF SYRIA.

THAT IS A HOAX.

I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BACK
AWAY FROM HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE IRANIAN REGIME AND THE
SYRIAN REGIME.

HE'S PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE
ANT I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY
INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN OVER
WHAT CONCESSIONS WE GIVE.

WORDS CATEGORY.

THIS IS NOTHING BUT TALK AT
LEAST AT THIS MOMENT.

IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE PLANS
ARE BEING DRAWN UP.

THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN PENTAGON
GAME PLANS.

HEZBOLLAH IS IN THERE AND THE
IRANIANS SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.

WE HAVE UNITED STATES FORCES ON
THE GROUND.

HOWEVER QUIETLY.

THEY ARE THERE FIGHTING AGAINST
ISIS.

THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE GROUND
SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD.

YOU HAVE THIS TOXIC MIX OF ALL
OF THOSE PEOPLE AND TO REMOVE
THIS MAN FROM POWER, REGIME
CHANGE, SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RAILED FOR
YEARS.

COULD REALLY UPSET THE
EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT REGION AND
AROUND THE WORLD.

WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT I RAN HERE,
HEZBOLLAH, RUSSIA, THE UNITED
STATES AND SYRIA, THAT IS ALMOST
A WORLD WAR DEFINED OR AT LEAST
YOU RISK THAT POSSIBILITY.

RIGHT.

THAT'S THE THING.

IF HE WANTS TO DO SOME AIR
STRIKES ON THE WEAPONS ARSENALS,
THAT'S ONE THING.

OBVIOUSLY REGIME CHANGE IS A
HUGE OCCUPATION OF SYRIA AND A
MASSIVE GROUND WAR IN WHICH YOU
MENTIONED THERE'S SO MANY SIDES
AND PROXY FIGHTS GOING ON.

AGAIN, ARE WE GOING TO DO IT
WITH THE RUSSIANS OR NOT?

THAT'S THE QUESTION.

WE'LL LEARN MORE IN WEEKS TO
THIS FURTHER.

THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED,
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES.

A.B.

WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL
BREAK.

IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, WE HAVE A
MINUTE OF OTHER HEADLINES.

AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK TO THIS.

ORGANIZING A COALITION FOR
SYRIA.

I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE
FOX REPORT.

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE
DIFFUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE IN ST. PETERSBURG AND
ARRESTED THREE PEOPLE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SUBWAY
BOMBING.

THE DEVICE TURNED UP IN THE
APARTMENT WHERE THE SUSPECT
LIVED.

THEY'RE ACCUSED OF HAVING TIES
TO THE SUICIDE BOMBER THAT
KILLED 13 OTHERS ON MONDAY.

A WOMAN THAT FELL 60 FEET TO THE
GROUND WHILE TAKING A SELFIE ON
A BRIDGE IS NOT LIKELY TO FACE
CHARGES.

THAT'S THE WORDS FROM SHERIFF
DEPUTIES.

CREWED AIRLIFTED HER AND SHE'S
EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.

FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF JOHN GLENN
GATHERING IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL
CEMETERY TO SAY THEIR FINAL
GOOD-BYES.

GLENN WAS THE FIRST AMERICAN TO
ORBIT THE EARTH.

HE DIED IN DECEMBER AT AGE 95.

RELATIVES SAID THEY HAD THE
FUNERAL TODAY BECAUSE IT WOULD
WITH HIS WIFE, ANNIE.

THE NEWS WITH SHEP CONTINUES
AFTER THIS.

NEWS CHANNEL AND MUCH MORE ON
SECRETARY TILLER SEASON.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE
ANNOUNCING THAT STEPS ARE
UNDERWAY TO FORM AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

THIS AFTER INTERNATIONAL
INVESTIGATORS SAY HE LAUNCHED
ANOTHER CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
KILLING DOZENS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE
AN INJURING DOZENS AND CHILDREN
AS THEY SLEPT IN THEIR BEDS.

LET'S GO BACK TO A.B.

STODDARD
FROM REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM.

YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY OUT
STRATEGIC AIR STRIKES.

IN 2015, THE RUSSIANS WENT IN
AND OWNED THE AIR BASES.

THAT I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT
BASES AND MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEMS THERE.

THE IDEA THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD
ALLOW US TO STRIKE THE SIX AIR
STRIKES THAT EXIST SEEMS AT THIS
MOMENT IMPLAUSIBLE.

RIGHT.

THERE'S RUSSIANS EVERYWHERE
THERE.

SO THE POTENTIAL FOR AN
ACCIDENT, WHICH WE ALMOST HAD IN
2015 WITH OUR MORE LIMITED AIR
STRIKES WITH THE RUSSIANS AND
STARTING WORLD WAR III WITH THEM
IS VERY HIGH.

SO I DON'T KNOW -- IT'S
INTERESTING THAT TRUMP SAID
UNTIL YESTERDAY THAT HE DOESN'T
TELEGRAPH WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO
AND HE LIKES TO DO THINGS
SECRETLY.

HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO TAKE
OUT AL-ASSAD WITH ALL OF THESE
TERRIBLE OPTIONS.

IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO
SEE WHAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING,
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE WILLING
TO PUT GROUND FORCES ON.

WE HAVE 900 SPECIAL FORCE
THERE'S ALREADY IN HARM'S WAY.

THE CONGRESS AT SOME POINT,
SHEP, IS GOING TO HAVE TO
WEIGH-IN ON THIS.

THEY BACKED AWAY WHEN OBAMA
WANTED TO RENEW THE 2001
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF
MILITARY FORCE A FEW YEARS AGO.

THEY ABDICATED THE
RESPONSIBILITY.

I WAS CRITICAL AT THE TIME THEY
DID THAT.

THE PRESSURE WILL BE ON THEM TO
WEIGH-IN ON THIS.

THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER POLITICAL
DEBATE AND WHOLE OTHER HURDLE.

THAT BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAID THE SAME THING BACK
REGARDING THIS MATTER EARLIER.

LOOK AT THE TWEET THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP SENT BACK, BEFORE HE WAS
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

THIS WAS FROM 2013.

"WHAT WILL WE GET FOR BOMBING
SYRIA BESIDES MORE DEBT AND A
POSSIBLE LONG-TERM CONFLICT?

OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL ON THAT SAME LINE."

TODAY SENATOR RAND PAUL FROM
KENTUCKY SAID IF WE WANT TO
CARRY OUT STRIKES IN SYRIA,
THERE SHOULD BE CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL.

THE CHANCES OF CONGRESS WEIGHING
IN ON THIS, A.B.?

THEY DON'T WANT TO.

I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

THEY'LL BE FORCED.

AND IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT
THIS WAS A SARIN ATTACK, IT
SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE
PUBLIC BEFORE THERE'S ANY
MILITARY INTERVENTION.

CONGRESS WILL BE ASKING AS THEY
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN 435
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AND THE
HOUSE, THEY'LL BE ASKING FOR
HARD EVIDENCE TO LAY OUT THE
CASE IF THEY ARE TO SUPPORT MORE
AGGRESSIVE AIR STRIKES, LET
ALONE GROUND OPERATIONS THE
TOPPLE THE REGIME, THIS SOUNDS
LIKE A LONG BATTLE.

ALTHOUGH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THEY'RE
WORKING ON SOME PLAN TO DO
SOMETHING EXTREMELY BOLD, AS A
FEW DAYS AGO, THEY HAD NO PLAN
IN PLACE AND NO INTENTIONS LIKE
THIS.

SO I THINK THEY'RE FLYING A BIT
BY THE SEAT OF THEIR PANTS.

NOBODY IN CONGRESS KNOW WHAT'S
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

AGAIN THAT MEETING IN RUSSIA
SAYS IT WILL BE SO PIVOTAL.

HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES GO IT
ALONE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS
SUPPORTING ASSAD'S REGIME?

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SPOKEN ABOUT
SYRIA AS HE HEADED ON AIR FORCE
ONE DOWN TO FLOOR.

THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK TO THE
PRESS CABIN IN THE REAR RIGHT
SIDE OF AIR FORCE ONE TO TALK
ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
THINGS.

HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE
SUMMIT HE'S HAVING WITH
XI JINPING, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO
BE THE THEME OF THIS NEXT 24
HOURS.

IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH SYRIA AND THE POTENTIAL
THERE IS OVERSHADOWING THAT.

A ROUTINE LEADER SUMMIT BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS
TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE ALL
TOGETHER.

THE PRESIDENT TALKING TO THE
PRESS ABOUT SYRIA.

HE WAS ASKING WHETHER BASHAR
AL-ASSAD SHOULD GO.

THIS IS ON CAMERA.

WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE.

SO I'LL READ THE TRANSCRIPT.

THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT ASSAD
DID IS TERRIBLE.

WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS ONE OF
THE TRULY EGREGIOUS CRIMES.

AND WHEN ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT
WAS GOING TO TAKE TO PRESIDENT
PUTIN, HE SAID I MAY.

THERE WILL BE A RANGE OF OPTIONS
PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT ON
HOW HE COULD RESPOND MILITARY.

THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DISCUSSING
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

IF AN AIR STRIKE OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT
WOULD BE A TEST OF HOW GOOD A
RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT COULD
HAVE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
RUSSIA.

WHEN ASKED IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD
SHOULD LEAVE POWER, HE SAID IT'S
A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

HE'S THERE AND HE'S RUNNING
THINGS BUT SOMETHING SHOULD
HAPPEN.

REX TILLERSON IN THE CAMP OF
YES, HE NEEDS TO GO.

THE UNITED STATES TRYING TO GET
A COALITION FOR A POLITICAL
FRAME WORK FOR THAT TO HAPPEN
SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD.

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING AT
WHICH CAME TO NOTHING.

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED
TO STOP IT.

THE WORLD WANTS TO STOP IT.

THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY IS
MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THE
REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING
BECAUSE ALL OF THE OPTIONS ARE
BAD OPTIONS.

THAT WAS THE DECISION OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

HE DIDN'T ACT.

NOW THIS PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED
TO ACT.

HE'S TRYING TO FORM A COALITION.

BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
OVERTHROW BASHAR AL-ASSAD?

WHO HOLDS THE LAND THEN?

WHO IS IN CHARGE?

HOW DO YOU COME TO SOME
AGREEMENT WITH THE RUSSIANS WHO
HAVE BEEN PROPPING UP THE SYRIAN
DICTATOR?

WOULD THE RUSSIANS ALLOW A NO
FLY ZONE?

IT'S THE RUSSIAN'S AIRSPACE.

THIS IS AS COMPLICATED AS ANY
FOREIGN MATNER THE WORLD RIGHT
NOW AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE
DYING BEFORE OUR EYES.

 THE PROCESS BY WHICH AL-ASSAD
WOULD LEAVE IS SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES AN INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY EFFORT.

BOTH TO FIRST DEFEAT ISIS WITHIN
SYRIA, TO STABILIZE THE SYRIAN
COUNTRY TO AVOID FURTHER CIVIL
WAR AND TO WORK COLLECTIVELY
WITH OUR PARTNERS AROUND THE
WORLD THROUGH A POLITICAL
PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO
AL-ASSAD LEAVING.

CHANGE IN POLICY.
