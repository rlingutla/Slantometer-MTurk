FOUR DAYS AFTER HURRICANE   
MARIA SWEPT ACROSS PUERTO RICO, 
RESCUE TEAMS ONLY NOW ARE       
REACHING SOME OF THE MORE REMOTE
PARTS OF THAT ISLAND.

GABE GUTIERREZ WAS WITH A RESCUE
TEAM TODAY AS IT FINALLY MADE IT
CAN CARRY, WADING THROUGH       
RUSHING WATER, HOLDING ON TO A  
DEAD POWER CABLE, NOW AN        
IMPROMPTU LIFELINE.

A COMMUNITY IN PUERTO RICO CUT  
OFF WHEN HURRICANE MARIA WASHED 
THIS BRIDGE AWAY.

THIS WOMAN TELLS US EVERYTHING  
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS DEVASTATED.

THE NEED HERE IS MASSIVE.

RURAL PARTS OF THE ISLAND       
RAVAGED, INCLUDING THE MOUNTAIN 
TOWN.

I'M TAMMIE LITHER IN, PEOPLE 
ARE DESPERATE FOR WATER.

HERE OUTSIDE THIS AREA, THEY'VE 
JERRY RIGGED A PVC PIPE TO GET  
RIVER WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NO  
DRINKING WATER ANYWHERE ON THE  
ISLAND.

DAM AFTER FINDING A CRACK IN IT.

IF IT BURSTS, AUTHORITIES WARN  
OF LIFE-THREATENING FLOODING.

TODAY WE RODE ALONG WITH A FEMA 
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM FROM     
SOUTH FLORIDA AS IT MADE IT'S   
WAY TO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE  
ISLAND.

GREG IS A FIREFIGHTER FROM      
MIAMI.

HE'S WORKED HURRICANES HARVEY,  
IRMA, AND NOW MARIA.

SO WE JUST SPENT THE LAST    
HOUR TRYING TO DRIVE AROUND AND 
FIND OUT WHERE TO GO AND WHAT   
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

OFFICIALS, THEY'RE FINDING A    
SIMILAR STORY, OVER AND OVER    
AGAIN.

NO CELL SERVICE AND NO          
COMMUNICATION IS HAMPERING      
RESCUE EFFORTS.

THIS MAN IS A POLICE OFFICER.

THE HURRICANE DESTROYED HIS HOME
TOO.

IT'S PRETTY HARD BECAUSE I   
HAVE TO DO TWO JOBS AT THE SAME 
TIME.

YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO WORK WITH   
THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDS US, AND I 
ALSO HAVE TO WORK WITH MY OWN   
NEEDS, YOU KNOW.

GROWING MORE DIRE.

THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT COME   
FROM MILES AWAY, CARS WITHOUT   
GAS, VERY TOUGH, VERY TOUGH.

THE ISLAND'S LONG RECOVERY ONE  
MISSION AT A TIME.

TONIGHT, THERE IS AN URGENT RUSH
TO CLEAR THESE ROADS AND OPEN UP
LINES OF COMMUNICATION.

BUT THE MORE PEOPLE WE SPEAK    
WITH, IT'S CLEAR THIS RECOVERY  
WON'T BE MEASURED IN WEEKS, BUT 
MONTHS.

EVEN YEARS.

AND A CLOSE EYE ON MARIA    
TONIGHT AS IT MOVES CLOSER TO   
THE UNITED STATES.

NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SAYS  
THE STORM WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN,
BUT WILL COME CLOSE TO THE COAST
OF NORTH CAROLINA.

ESPECIALLY THE OUTER BANKS.

HIGH SURF, DANGEROUS RIP        
CURRENTS ARE EXPECTED UP AND    
DOWN THE EAST COAST OVER THE    
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
