THE MILITARY SIGNALS ITS FORCES
ARE IN PLACE AND ABLE TO STRIKE
SYRIA AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
SHOULD THE PRESIDENT ISSUE THE
ORDER.

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
INDICATIONS TONIGHT THAT A
U.S.-LED MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST
SYRIA COULD BE LAUNCHED BEFORE
THE END OF THE WEEK.

MOMENTUM FOR PUNISHING ACTION
AGAINST THE ASSAD GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE
DAY, AND AS WE BEGIN HERE
TONIGHT, THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW
DEVELOPMENTS TO REPORT.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL
RELEASE SOLID EVIDENCE THAT THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ORDERED A MASS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK ON ITS
OWN PEOPLE LAST WEEK.

ON THE DIPLOMATIC SIDE,
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR AN
ATTACK IS GROWING.

AND FROM THE PENTAGON, WORD THAT
U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE IN PLACE AND
READY TO LAUNCH WHEN THE ORDER
IS GIVEN.

THIS FAST MOVING CHAIN OF EVENTS
ALL TOUCHED OFF BY THOSE
HORRIFIC IMAGES OF DEAD AND
DYING CIVILIANS THAT SHOCKED THE
WORLD.

BRUSHING ASIDE ASSAD'S DENIAL,
THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO
PUNISH HIM AND STOP HIM FROM
ORDERING ANOTHER CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

HOPING TO PREVENT MORE DEATHS
FROM DEVASTATING WEAPONS NOT
SEEN IN DECADES.

AND LESTER, FAIR WARNING, THESE
LATEST PICTURES ARE VERY HARD TO
WATCH.

THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR.

A WAR THAT KILLS BABIES
SILENTLY, SUDDENLY, BATHING THEM
NOT IN BLOOD, BUT IN THE TEARS
OF A DOCTOR.

GHASTLY IMAGES OF LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

MOST TOO HORRIFYING TO SHOW ON
TELEVISION.

EMERGING ONLY TODAY.

THIS INFANT APPARENTLY BARELY A
MONTH OLD.

AND A NEW HORROR NEAR ALEPPO,
THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS
PHOSPHOROUS BOMBS AND NAPALM
DROPPED ON CIVILIANS MONDAY,
KILLING AT LEAST TEN, WOUNDING
DOZENS.

A REPORT THAT HAS NOT BEEN
INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED.

IN TEXAS TODAY, SPEAKING TO
VETERANS, THE VICE PRESIDENT
CONTINUED THE DRUM BEAT TO
PUNISH BASHAR AL ASSAD.

THERE'S NO DOUBT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.

THE SYRIAN REGIME.

NOT WAITING FOR A REPORT FROM
THE U.N. CHEMICAL WEAPONS TEAM
THAT FINALLY GOT TO THE ATTACK
SITE MONDAY.

OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS THEY
HAVE INTELLIGENCE INTERCEPTS,
TYING THE ATTACK TO THE REGIME.

PLUS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

WE KNOW THAT THE REGIME
MAINTAINS CUSTODY OF THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA, AND
USES THE TYPES OF ROCKETS THAT
WERE USED TO DELIVER CHEMICAL
THE OPPOSITION DOES NOT.

MINISTER DAVID CAMERON CUT SHORT
HIS HOLIDAY TO CALL A SPECIAL
SESSION OF PARLIAMENT THURSDAY.

WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SYRIA ARE
APPALLING SCENES OF DEATH AND
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE ASSAD
REGIME.

I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN LET THAT
STAND.

PUTIN INTERRUPTED A MEETING TO
TAKE A CALL FROM THE BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER.

PUTIN IS STILL BLOCKING U.N.
ACTION.

BUT TODAY THE ARAB LEAGUE, LED
BY THE SAUDIS DENOUNCED THE
ASSAD GOVERNMENT FOR THE
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

WHEN THE ORDER COMES, THE
PENTAGON HAS FOUR DESTROYERS,
SUBMARINES, PLUS THE NATO BASE
IN TURKEY.

WE ARE READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

INTELLIGENCE IS UPDATING TARGETS
TO TEACH ASSAD A LESSON.

HE VALUES HIS MILITARY
COMMAND AND CONTROL NODES, HIS
COMMUNICATIONS NODES, HIS
MILITARY AIR FIELD.

WE'LL PROBABLY CRATER RUNWAYS SO
PLANES CAN'T TAKE OFF.

WE'LL TRY TO HIT PLANES ON THE
TARMAC.

THE U.S. MILITARY PLAN IS NOT TO
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIVIL
WAR AND TRY TO TOPPLE ASSAD.

BUT OPPOSITION LEADER GENERAL
LEE JUST TOLD RICHARD ENGEL THEY
WILL SEIZE THE CHANCE TO TRY TO
DEFEAT ASSAD.

I THINK THERE IS A VERY GOOD
CHANCE TO FALL THE ASSAD REGIME.

SYRIA'S ALLIES, IRAN OR
HEZBOLLAH RETALIATE AGAINST
ISRAEL?

ISRAEL SAYS IT'S READY FOR
ANYTHING.

THE ADMINISTRATION WILL GIVE A
CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE
ASSESSMENT TO CONGRESS THIS WEEK
AND MAKE A DECLASSIFIED VERSION
PUBLIC.

OFFICIALS HAVE DELAYED THE
ANTICIPATED RELEASE FOR A DAY OR
SO, TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO
MISTAKES.

FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE FALSE
CLAIMS ABOUT IRAQ'S WMD A DECADE
AGO.

AS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
AMPS UP THE RHETORIC FOR
POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
SYRIA, A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE
FOCUSED ON OTHER THINGS, LIKE
THE DWINDLING DAYS OF SUMMER.

BUT IS THERE SUPPORT FOR A
MILITARY STRIKE?

NBC'S KEVIN TIBBLES WENT TO THE
MINNESOTA STATE FAIR TODAY TO
SEE HOW ALL THIS IS PLAYING FAR
FROM WASHINGTON.

HEAT WAVE BEATS DOWN, FOLKS HEAD
FOR THE MIDWAY, THE COTTON
CANDY, CORN DOGS, CORN ON THE
COB, ICE CREAM, EVEN PICKLES ON
A STICK.

BUT TODAY IS ALSO MILITARY
APPRECIATION DAY, AND MANY VETS
AND THEIR FAMILIES NOW WORRY
ABOUT ALLEGED CHEMICAL ATTACKS
IN SYRIA.

NOW, WHAT TO DO WITH SYRIA,
THAT'S THE QUESTION NOBODY HAS
THE ANSWER.

CHEMICAL WEAPONS?

THAT'S AWFUL.

NOBODY SHOULD USE THAT.

STATES DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DO
SOMETHING, BECAUSE I THINK IF WE
DON'T DO SOMETHING, IT'S GOING
TO CONTINUE.

SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

TO ME IT SHOULD BE WITH THE
ALLIES, OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO
GET INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING WE
DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN.

THEY'RE TORN ABOUT WHAT AMERICA
SHOULD DO.

WE GET INVOLVED IN SO MANY
PLACES WE REALLY DON'T BELONG.

AGAINST ANY INVOLVEMENT.

WE HAVE PLENTY OF OUR OWN
BATTLES TO BE FOUGHT.

WE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING INTO A
MIDDLE EASTERN CONFLICT RIGHT
NOW.

I THINK WE'RE INVOLVED IN
ENOUGH STUFF OVERSEAS, YOU KNOW?

TRYING TO BRING THE TROOPS HOME
AND LET SOMEONE ELSE DEAL WITH
IT.

CELEBRATE THE TROOPS, MANY WORRY
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT LIE AHEAD.

I PRAY FOR THOSE GUYS EVERY
NIGHT.

THEY'RE IN MY PRAYERS.

MANY HERE HAVE EITHER SERVED
OR HAVE LOVED ONES SERVING
OVERSEAS.

THEY ARE PATRIOTIC, BUT THEY ARE
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ANY FUTURE
MILITARY CONFLICT.

OUR FINAL STORY TONIGHT IS
ABOUT A SMALL BUT EXTRAORDINARY
RAY OF HOPE IN A PLACE WHERE
THERE'S FAR TOO LITTLE HOPE.

THAT SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN
JORDAN.

NBC'S ANN CURRY HAS THE STORY OF
ONE YOUNG BOY IN DESPERATE NEED
OF MEDICAL ATTENTION, AND A
DOCTOR WHO'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE
TO HELP HIM.

ZAATARI CAMP, A DOCTOR LEADS US
TO ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
HERE.

SULEMAN, A REFUGEE HIMSELF, WAS
DETERMINED TO GET HELP FOR A BOY
WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED IT.

WHEN I SAW HIM, THE LIFE IN
EYES DIED WHEN YOU SAW HIM?

THE BOY'S MOTHER.

MAY WE SEE YOUR SON?

SHE LED US DOWN UNMARKED ROADS
TO A PLACE WE COULD NOT HAVE
FOUND BY OURSELVES, INTO HER
SMALL SHELTER.

AND THERE HE WAS, HIS FACE
GAUNT, HIS ARMS LIKE TWIGS.

HIS NAME IS IBRAHIM.

HE IS 10 YEARS OLD, BORN IN
SYRIA WITH A CONDITION THAT
CAUSES HIS MUSCLES TO ATROPHY.

PHYSICAL THERAPY HAD HELPED HIM
WALK, HIS MOTHER SAYS, BUT
SYRIA'S WAR HAS CHANGED THAT.

IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, HE'S
LOST MORE THAN 20% OF HIS BODY
WEIGHT, CAN NO LONGER STAND, AND
WON'T EAT.

WHY CAN'T YOU EAT?

HE SAYS "MY STOMACH FEELS
FUNNY."

HIS MOTHER FEARS FOR HIS LIFE.

SHE SAYS, I'M VERY SAD ABOUT MY
SON.

HIS FATHER WAS KILLED.

SINCE THEY FLED HERE, SHE'S
TRYING TO GET HELP AS HER SON'S
CONDITION WORSENS.

BUT SHE SAYS LOCAL CLINICS
TURNED HER AWAY.

WE SUGGESTED A CLINIC SHE DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT, IN THIS SPRAWLING
CAMP AND OFFERED HER AND IBRAHIM
A RIDE THERE.

15 MINUTES LATER, AT THE GATES
OF DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, A
YOUNG PHYSICIAN ADMITTED
IBRAHIM, AND SOON DOCTORS WERE
GIVING HIM A CHECKUP.

THEY SAY THEY'LL REFER HIM TO A
SPECIALIST WHO MIGHT ONE DAY
HELP HIM WALK AGAIN.

IN THE MEANTIME, THEY OFFER
NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND
WEEKLY CHECKUPS TO HELP HIM GAIN
WEIGHT AND GET STRONGER.

TODAY, THAT'S ENOUGH TO GIVE A
WORRIED MOTHER AND HER SON HOPE
FAR FROM HOME.
