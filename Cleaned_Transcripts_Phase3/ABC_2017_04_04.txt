THE IMAGES ARE DISTURBING.

THE DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
UNLEASHED IN SYRIA.

WE ARE STAYING AWAY FROM THE
MOST GRUESOME MOMENTS.

FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AMONG THE
VICTIMS.

GASPING FOR AIR TO SURVIVE.

AND THE MOMENT ANOTHER EXPLOSION
HITS.

OUR TEAM MAKING CONTACT WITH A
DOCTOR ON THE GROUND.

WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT
WITH THE IMAGES THAT HAVE
STUNNED THE WORLD.

IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER
SIX YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA, THERE
COULD BE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
THAN WHAT MANY HAVE ALREADY
SEEN.

TONIGHT, OUR TEAM HAS TAKEN
GREAT CARE TO POUR THROUGH THE
IMAGES FIRST, BUT WE WARN YOU,
THEY'RE STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE.

A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN
AMONG THE VICTIMS.

SURVIVORS BEING SPRAYED OFF,
AFTER WAR PLANES DROPPED WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A TOXIC GAS.

THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDING.

OVER THESE SCENES OF HORROR AND
SUFFERING IN SYRIA.

AN APPARENT WAR CRIME, A
SUSPECTED SARIN GAS ATTACK BY
THE GOVERNMENT KILLING DOZENS
AND SICKENING MANY MORE, YOUNG
CHILDREN AMONG THE VICTIMS.

RESCUE WORKERS DESPERATELY WORK
TO WASH THE CHEMICAL FROM THE
VICTIMS.

CHILDREN CLINGING TO LIFE,
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.

THE GAS ATTACKS ARE
CONTINUING EVERY DAY AND NO ONE
IS DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THIS
GAS ATTACK.

FOLLOWING TWO CHLORINE GAS
ATTACKS OVER THE PAST WEEK.

WHILE THIS LOCAL ACTIVIST
REPORTED FROM ONE OF THOSE
HOSPITALS, IT WAS HIT WITH
ANOTHER AIRSTRIKE.

THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THE
ATTACK "REPREHENSIBLE" AND SAID
IT "CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
CIVILIZED WORLD."

BUT THE STATEMENT ALSO TOOK AIM
AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

"THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME ARE A
CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAST
ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS AND
IRRESOLUTION."

THAT'S A REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S FAILURE TO PUNISH SYRIA
FOR CROSSING THE SO-CALLED RED
LINE WHEN IT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN 2013.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IN FACT BOASTED
THAT HE HAD WORKED OUT AN
AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA AND SYRIA
TO GET RID OF ASSAD'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

ASSAD GAVE UP HIS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

THAT'S NOT SPECULATION ON OUR
PART.

WAS NOT TRUE.

AT LEAST SOME OF THE WEAPONS
REMAINED.

THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
HOLD ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT TODAY
BUT HE DID SAY THIS IN A SPEECH
ON THE ECONOMY.

I'M NOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO
BE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD.

I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, AND FROM NOW ON, IT'S
GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.

REX TILLERSON IGNORED QUESTIONS
ON THE ATTACK.

MR. SECRETARY, ANY COMMENT ON
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA?

BASHAR AL ASSAD SHOULD STILL
BE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA?

CHANGE IN LONGTIME U.S. POLICY
THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD MUST GO.

I THINK THE STATUS IN THE
LONGER TERM STATUS OF PRESIDENT
ASSAD WILL BE DECIDED BY THE
SYRIAN PEOPLE.

SYRIAN PEOPLE AREN'T DETERMINING
THE STATUS OF ASSAD, THEY ARE
TRYING TO SURVIVE HIS BRUTALITY.

SECRETARY TILLERSON DID NOT TAKE
QUESTIONS ON THIS TODAY, BUT HE
APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN TO HARSHER
LINE IN A STATEMENT TODAY THAN
LINE.

A WRITTEN STATEMENT WHERE HE
CONDEMNED ASSAD.

REFERRING TO HIS BRUTAL,
UNABASHED BARBARISM.

AND HIS FUNDAMENTAL DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN DECENCY.

AND CALLED OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN,
SAYING THEY BEAR GREAT MORAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS.

BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WILL DO ABOUT IT
AND WHETHER THEY NOW WANT ASSAD
TO GO.
