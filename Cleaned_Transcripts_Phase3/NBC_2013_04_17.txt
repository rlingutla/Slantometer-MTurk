ON OUR BROADCAST TONIGHT,
CLOSING IN ON A SUSPECT IN
BOSTON.

A DAY OF RAPID DEVELOPMENTS,
SOME FALSE REPORTS TONIGHT BASED
ON IMAGERY FROM THE SCENE.

INVESTIGATORS APPEAR TO KNOW WHO
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR.

AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE AS
SOME VERY WELCOME RESCUERS COME
TO THE AID OF THE PEOPLE OF
BOSTON.

TO THE AID OF THE PEOPLE OF
BOSTON.

NOW THE INVESTIGATION IN BOSTON
IS MOVING.

AFTER A DAY OF FITS AND STARTS
AND SEVERAL FALSE REPORTS, IT
APPEARS THAT FROM A MOUNTAIN OF
EVIDENCE HAS EMERGED AN IMAGE, A
SERIES OF IMAGES THAT LIKELY
SHOW THE BOMBER THAT POLICE ARE
LOOKING FOR.

PARTS OF BOSTON ARE STILL SHUT
DOWN.

IT WAS ANOTHER JITTERY DAY THERE
AFTER A BOMB THREAT AT THE
FEDERAL COURTHOUSE THIS
AFTERNOON.

THIS IS THE BOMBING SCENE
TONIGHT.

WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE
DEVICES THEMSELVES AS THIS CASE,
AS WE SAID, NOW PICKS UP SPEED.

WHILE THE FBI IS URGING CAUTION
AND ASKING FOR PATIENCE
ESPECIALLY FROM THE NEWS MEDIA,
IT APPEARS THEY HAVE PICTURES OF
THEIR SUSPECT.

OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE
WILLIAMS HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE
INVESTIGATION ALL DAY.

THE FBI IS PURSUING VERY
PROMISING LEADS.

ONE IN PARTICULAR TONIGHT THANKS
TO THE ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES AND
VIDEOS ROUNDED UP IN THE TWO
DAYS SINCE THE BOMBING.

WE ARE GETTING A CLOSE-UP LOOK
AT HOW THE BOMBS WERE MADE.

GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

NO WAY.

GETTING EXACTLY WHAT IT ASKED
FOR.

PICTURES FROM SEVERAL SOURCES
SHOWING SOMEONE CARRYING A HEAVY
BACKPACK OR DUFFEL BAG AND
PLACING IT AT THE SPOT WHERE ONE
BOMB WENT OFF.

ONE OF THE MOST PROMISING
IMAGES, THEY SAY, COMES FROM A
DEPARTMENT STORE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA HIGH UP ON A BUILDING,
ABLE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE CROWD.

ON A DAY WHEN INCORRECT NEWS
REPORTS OF AN ARREST DISTRACTED
OFFICIALS, INVESTIGATORS WERE
WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO
DISCOVER, FIND, AND INTERVIEW
THAT PERSON.

THAT'S AT THE SCENE OF THE
SECOND BOMBING FOLLOWING THE
FIRST BY ABOUT 15 SECONDS.

IT'S THAT SECOND SPOT SHOWN ON
THIS PICTURE SENT TO NBC STATION
WHDH SHOWING A GARBAGE BAG NEXT
TO A TRASH CAN.

WHILE INVESTIGATORS CANNOT BE
SURE THAT BAG CONTAINED THE BOMB
FEDERAL OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS
THAT IS THE SPOT WHERE THE
SECOND BOMB WENT OFF.

FORMER ATF BOMB INVESTIGATOR JIM
CAVANAUGH SAID IT IS OBVIOUS TO
HIM LOOKING AT THE PICTURES.

LARGE INJURIES WERE ON THE
SIDE OF IT.

DEBRIS FIELD TO THE LEFT.

SOME PROTECTED AREAS OVER ON THE
RIGHT SIDE THAT INDICATE THE
BLAST WAS TO ONE SIDE OF THE
TRASH RECEPTACLE.

THIS WAS THE SCENE OF THE BLAST.

PIECES OF THE BOMB.

SHOWING THE PRESSURE COOKER
DEFORMED BY THE BLAST, ONE OF
ITS LIDS BLOWN TO THE TOP OF A
NEARBY BUILDING.

THEY ARE A FAVORITE OF BOMB
MAKERS BECAUSE EXPLOSIVE
PRESSURE BUILDS UP BEFORE IT IS
RELEASED.

INVESTIGATORS CAN NOW BEGIN TO
TRACE DOWN WHERE COMPONENTS WERE
BOUGHT SINCE THEY KNOW THE MAKER
OF THE PRESSURE COOKER, THE
TYPE OF RECHARGEABLE FLASHLIGHT
BATTERIES USED -- MADE IN CHINA,
BUT WIDELY AVAILABLE --
AND EVEN THE TYPE OF WIRE --
ALSO MADE IN CHINA -- USED TO
HOOK THE MAIN COMPONENTS
TOGETHER.

BOMB TECHNICIANS ARE EXAMINING
TWO ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS
INCLUDED IN THE BOMBS TO SEE
WHETHER THEY WERE PARTS OF
TIMERS OR RECEIVERS FOR A REMOTE
DETONATION SIGNAL.

ALL POTENTIALLY PROMISING LEADS,
SAYS A BOMB EXPERT.

IT DEPENDS ON HOW UNIQUE THE
BOMB COMPONENTS ARE, HOW
IDENTIFIABLE THE CHARACTERISTICS
ARE, WHAT OTHER FORENSICS
INVOLVED IN THAT, WHETHER IT BE
FINGERPRINTS, DNA, ET CETERA.

OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY ARE CLOSE
TO THE ANSWER OF WHO DID THIS
AND WHY IN AN INVESTIGATION
THAT'S MOVING VERY RAPIDLY ON
SEVERAL FRONTS.

ABOUT THAT RAPID SPEED AND
OPTIMISM, PETE WILLIAMS, THANKS.

WE WANT TO BRING IN THE FORMER
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL
COUNTERTERRORISM CENTER.

YOU RECEIVED FROM YOUR SOURCES A
CAUTION TODAY THAT THIS PERHAPS
WAS RUNNING ON AHEAD OF ITSELF.

AND THIS CAN HAVE A BAD EFFECT
ON AN INVESTIGATION.

ABSOLUTELY.

WITH ALL THE MEDIA REPORTING
ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ARRESTS, THEY
ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE
PERSON OR PEOPLE BEING SPOOKED
AND THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT
EXPECTATIONS AT THIS POINT.

FOR A WHILE PEOPLE WERE SAYING
IT'S NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH.

NOW PEOPLE EXPECT AN ARREST IN
THE NEAR HOURS AND THE FACT IS
KNOWING THE PERSON IT CAN STILL
TAKE SOME TIME.

NOW ABOUT THE EVIDENCE.

WE HAVE A BIG HAYSTACK HERE.

SO FAR WE HAVE FOUND SOME OF THE
NEEDLES DOWN TO THE ZIPPER PULL
ON WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE BAG
AND THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY.

WE ALSO HAVE IMAGERY -- TONS OF
IT -- AND THAT HAS TO BE A BIG
EARLY HELP.

THAT IS INVALUABLE.

IT'S SOMETHING EVEN THREE OR
FOUR YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD.

ALL OF THAT IMAGERY FROM THE
STORES, THE POLICE AND PEOPLE,
YOU COMBINE THAT WITH THE
FORENSIC EVIDENCE AND THE SECRET
INTELLIGENCE WE ARE NOT HEARING
ABOUT FROM HUMAN INTELLIGENCE
SOURCES, CELL PHONE RECORDS,
THINGS LIKE THAT.

THAT PAINTS THE MOSAIC FROM
WHICH THEY FIND THEIR SUSPECT.

YESTERDAY AT THE AIRPORT,
LOGAN AIRPORT IN BOSTON, THEY
WERE TELLING PEOPLE, BEFORE YOU
LEAVE OUR CITY, DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING, DO YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING?

ALL OF THAT HELPS.

ABSOLUTELY.

EVERY BIT OF IT.

IT DOES ONE MORE THING.

IT SHOWS THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO
BE INVOLVED IN THIS.

IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT SAYING FBI
WILL GO GET THEM.

PEOPLE BEFORE AN ATTACK, AFTER
AN ATTACK, THE PUBLIC HAS A HUGE
ROLE TO PLAY IN HELPING THEM
FIND SOMEONE AND BEING RESILIENT
AFTER.

THE DEFINITION OF SOCIAL
MEDIA.

AS WE SAID IT'S BEEN A DAY
OF RAPIDLY MOVING DEVELOPMENTS.

AS INVESTIGATORS CONTINUE TO DO
THEIR WORK, DOCTORS CONTINUE TO
DO THEIRS IN BOSTON.

AFTER SAVING SO MANY LIVES,
AFTER DEALING, REMEMBER, WITH
WHAT LOOKED LIKE COMBAT
INJURIES, SOME VICTIMS ARE NOW
LEAVING THE HOSPITAL TELLING
THEIR STORIES FOR THE FIRST
TIME.

TONIGHT THE CITY OF BOSTON IS
PREPARING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO WILL ATTEND
AN INTERFAITH SERVICE TOMORROW
AND PREPARING FOR WHAT MANY KNOW
WILL BE A LONG, DIFFICULT
JOURNEY TO RECOVERY.

IN BOSTON, VOWS OF RESOLVE
TODAY AMID EMOTIONS THAT ARE
STILL RAW.

A RELIEVED 20-YEAR-OLD SARAH
GERARD LEFT THE HOSPITAL WITH
HER LEG IN A CAST.

I HAVE A FRACTURED SHIN BONE
AND A FRACTURED HEEL BONE FROM
THE SHRAPNEL THAT HIT IT.

THERE IS NO RELIEF.

HER TWO SONS, PAUL AND JP, EACH
LOST A LEG AND WERE BURNED.

I'M WAITING TO WAKE UP FROM
THIS NIGHTMARE.

I'M HOPING IT'S NOT REAL.

STATE JOHN KERRY, MASSACHUSETTS
SENATOR FOR 28 YEARS, STRUGGLED
AS HE TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS.

YOU KNOW, BOSTON IS NOT GOING
TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THIS.

BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT WHO
STILL ON EDGE.

A BOMB SCARE FORCED THE
EVACUATION OF THE FEDERAL
COURTHOUSE.

AND IT IS A CITY IN MOURNING.

BOSTON UNIVERSITY STUDENT LINGZI
LU IDENTIFIED AS THE THIRD
VICTIM OF THE BOMBING.

THE 23-YEAR-OLD GRADUATE STUDENT
FROM CHINA WAS WATCHING THE
MARATHON WITH TWO OTHER FRIENDS.

DAVE KING FINISHED THE MARATHON
MONDAY.

AN HOUR LATER HE WAS IN THE
OPERATING ROOM AT MASSACHUSETTS
GENERAL HOSPITAL.

THE TRAUMA SURGEON WHO SERVED IN
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, SUDDENLY
FACED DECISIONS HE THOUGHT HE'D
LEFT ON THE BATTLEFIELD --
WHETHER TO AMPUTATE.

NATURALLY, YOU WILL ALWAYS
CHOOSE LIFE OVER LIMB.

AMPUTATIONS AND THREE GRUELLING
DAYS OF SURGERY, KING IS
ASTONISHED BY HIS PATIENTS'
RESILIENCE.

THEY UNDERSTAND THAT LOSING A
A LIMB WAS REQUIRED TO SAVE A
THEIR LIFE.

AND THEY ARE JUST AT PEACE WITH
THAT.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW.

VICTIMS INSPIRING THE STRENGTH
OF THE CITY.

WE ONLY CARE ABOUT THREE
THINGS IN THIS TOWN -- POLITICS,
SPORTS AND REVENGE.

OUR REVENGE IS TO GO BACK TO
NORMAL.

WHAT HAPPENED TO US THE OTHER
DAY WILL NOT COW US.

IT WILL NOT CHANGE US.

BOSTON IS BACK AT ITS NORMAL
ROUTINE, DOCTORS ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL
RECOVERY WILL TAKE NOT ONLY
MONTHS BUT MOST LIKELY YEARS,
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO WILL
SUFFER WITH POST TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER.

OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS AS A SHOW
OF RESPECT AND SUPPORT FOR
BOSTON, THE SONG HAS BEEN PLAYED
AT BASEBALL GAMES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.

NOWHERE WAS IT MORE IMPACTFUL
THAN WHEN THEY PLAYED IT AT
YANKEE STADIUM.

JUST CALLING THE HOUSE THAT RUTH
BUILT NORMALLY ANGERS SOX FANS.

LAST NIGHT THE YANKS WERE
PLAYING THEIR SONG.

WHEN WE COME BACK, MAKING A
DIFFERENCE WITH SOME VERY GOOD
DOGS PROVIDING MUCH-NEEDED
COMFORT TO THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON.

THIS IS THE CORNER OF
BOYLSTON AND BERKELEY STREETS IN
BOSTON WHERE A MEMORIAL HAS
SPROUTED UP ABOUT A BLOCK FROM
WHERE THE BOMBINGS TOOK PLACE.

IT WAS STARTED BY A MAN FROM
CAPE COD WANTING TO EXPRESS HIS
SADNESS.

FOLKS SAW IT.

THEY HAVE BEEN STOPPING BY ALL
DAY DROPPING OFF FLOWERS AND
CARDS.

A LOT OF THE SIGNS WE HAVE SEEN
FEATURE THE SLOGAN OF THE MOMENT
IN THAT CITY -- BOSTON STRONG.

WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL TOO MANY
TIMES LATELY.

THEY ARE A WELCOME SIGN WHEN
THEY ARRIVE ON THE SCENE -- THE
THERAPY DOGS WHO SHOW UP TO
COMFORT THE HUMANS WHO HAVE BEEN
THROUGH A TRAUMA.

WELL, THEY ARE ON THE JOB
TONIGHT IN BOSTON.

15-YEAR-OLD DAVID YEPEZ HAS
HEARD AND THOUGHT ABOUT ARE HIS
INJURIES FROM THE SECOND
EXPLOSION.

THIS IS RUTHIE.

SMILED.

WE HAVE A DOG AT HOME.

HE'S A SMALL YORKIE TERRIER.

LUTHER AND RUTHIE MADE THE
SHRAPNEL THAT TORE THROUGH HIS
LEFT LEG AND THE PAINFUL
SECOND-DEGREE BURNS ALMOST AN
AFTERTHOUGHT.

IT'S RELAXING.

TAKES MY MIND AWAY FROM
EVERYTHING GOING ON.

CHURCH CHARITIES DEPLOYED THE
COMFORT BRIGADE AT TUFTS MEDICAL
CENTER.

DOGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH
OTHER RECOVERING CHILDREN IN
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

COME ON, PUPPY.

VISITORS WHO LEEANN SAYS SET HER
NERVES AT EASE HOURS BEFORE THE
SURGERY ON HER WOUNDED LEG.

ANIMALS, YOU KNOW, THEY JUST
HAVE A DIFFERENT SENSE, YOU
KNOW.

THEY DON'T TALK BACK TO YOU.

OH, MY GOODNESS!

HI!

ARE LIKE FURRY THERAPISTS AND IT
IS NOT JUST THOSE WHO WERE
INJURED THAT NEED RELIEF.

HOW NICE IS IT FOR YOU TO HAVE
JUST A DIFFERENT MOMENT WITH A
DOG?

MY STRESS LEVEL HAS GONE WAY
DOWN.

THEY SENSE LOVE.

THEY SENSE THAT SOMEBODY IS
CARING.

AND THEY SENSE THAT IN THE MIDST
OF DARKNESS THERE IS LIGHT.

THIS IS LUTHER.

COMPASSION, AND COMFORT, WHEN IT
IS NEEDED THE MOST.

YOU ARE A BIG PUPPY FOR 2.
