STORM FRONT.

VIOLENT WEATHER ROLLING ACROSS
AMERICA RIGHT BEFORE THE BIG
MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, AND A
WORRISOME WARNING TONIGHT ABOUT
THE COMING HURRICANE SEASON.

AND IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
TODAY, THE FIRST FUNERALS FOR
THE PEOPLE KILLED BY THAT EF-5
TORNADO AND ON WHAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL,
SOME TEACHERS RETURNED TO THE
SCENE OF SO MUCH HORROR THREE
DAYS AFTER THAT DIRECT HIT
TWISTER OUTBREAK.

KINDERGARTEN TEACHER JENNIFER
SIMONS ARRIVED BACK AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY LATE TODAY FOR
THE FIRST TIME SINCE MONDAY'S
TORNADO.

HERE, WHERE SEVEN CHILDREN DIED,
HER SIX STUDENTS LIVED.

SHIELDED BENEATH HER BODY WHEN
AN SUV CRASHED THROUGH THE
CEILING OF HER CLASSROOM.

I JUST COVERED MY BABIES.

I TRIED TO SAVE THEM.

IT CRUSHED MY ARM, BUT I'M OKAY
WITH THAT.

ENDURED AND THE BRAVERY SHE
DISPLAYED, CAUGHT ON TAPE AT
BRIARWOOD WHERE OTHER TEACHERS
BATTLED DARKNESS, FEAR, FALLING
DEBRIS, AND PROTECTED CHILDREN.

[ SHOUTING AND CHAOS ]
TODAY MANY PARENTS EXPRESSED
THEIR GRATITUDE, AN ASSEMBLY FOR
ALL THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ON
WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST
DAY OF SCHOOL.

SHE SHIELDED WITH HER OWN
BODY TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER.

YOU KNOW THAT, I'M NEVER GOING
TO HAVE ANY WORDS TO REPAY HER
FOR WHAT SHE DID.

FUNERALS.

9-YEAR-OLD ANTONIA CANDELARIA
WAS LAID TO REST DURING A
VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM.

PARENTS LIKE ED KELLEY WRESTLE
WITH SURVIVOR'S GUILT.

I FEEL FORTUNATE, BUT IT
HURTS.

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE
PARENTS?

THEY DIDN'T GET TO BRING THEIR
KIDS HOME.

OTHERS WERE GIVEN BACKPACKS WITH
GOODIES FOR THE SUMMER.

HER SADNESS, HIDDEN BEHIND A
SMILE.

THREE OF MY FRIENDS HAD
SIBLINGS THAT DIED.

AND NONE OF THEM WERE THERE.

AND I REALLY WISH THEY WERE
THERE BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE THEM.

TEACHER JENNIFER SIMONS, JUST
HER SECOND YEAR IN THE
CLASSROOM, HER RIGHT ARM CRUSHED
BY THE TORNADO.

I DON'T THINK I'M A HERO.

I THINK IT'S WHAT ANYBODY WOULD
DO.

HER SCHOOL, JENNIFER TOLD US,
NOT HER SPIRIT.

SHE'LL BE BACK IN THE CLASSROOM
NEXT FALL.
