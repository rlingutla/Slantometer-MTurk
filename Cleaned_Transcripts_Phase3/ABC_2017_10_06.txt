WHAT POLICE HAVE JUST REVEALED
ABOUT THE SECURITY GUARD WHO
APPROACHED THAT DOOR.

WHAT LED HIM THERE IN THE FIRST
PLACE AND WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON
THE GUNMAN'S NOTE.

WE MOVE ON TO OTHER
HEADLINES AT THIS HOUR AND FROM
LAS VEGAS NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

WHAT DREW THAT HOTEL SECURITY
GUARD TO THE HOTEL ROOM IN THE
FIRST PLACE AND EVEN THOUGH HE
WAS SHOT THROUGH THE DOOR WAS HE
THE ONE WHO STOPPED MORE
BLOODSHED?

WORST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN
HISTORY, LAS VEGAS POLICE
ACKNOWLEDGING THEY STILL DON'T
KNOW WHAT DROVE STEPHEN PADDOCK
TO OPEN FIRE ON THAT HELPLESS
CROWD.

I GET IT.

WE ALL WANT ANSWERS.

WE HAVE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING.

LEARNING THAT HERO SECURITY
GUARD JESUS CAMPOS MAY HAVE
PREVENTED FURTHER BLOODSHED.

POLICE SAY PADDOCK HAD BEEN
SHOOTING WHEN CAMPOS ARRIVED ON
DOOR ALARM.

WE BELIEVE HE WAS SHOOTING
INTO THE CROWD, AND THEN THE
SECURITY GUARD WAS SHOT DURING
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE FRANTIC
EFFORTS TO SAVE THE VICTIMS.

48-YEAR-OLD DOUG CARTER WAS
ATTENDING THE CONCERT WITH HIS
WIFE AND SON.

BUT THEY BECAME SEPARATED IN THE
CHAOS.

YOU SEE DOUG HERE DAZED AND
STAGGERING, A BULLET IN HIS ARM.

THE MAN TAKING THIS VIDEO RAY
PAGE TAKES HIM TO A MAKE-SHIFT
TRIAGE CENTER.

STAND RIGHT HERE.

HE'S IN SHOCK.

HEAR HIM MUMBLE ABOUT HIS GUT.

I GOT MY GUT HURTS THOUGH.

HELPING HIM PULL UP HIS SHIRT
THAT LIGHT ILLUMINATES ANOTHER
BULLET HOLE IN HIS CHEST.

I DO GOT ONE?

YEAH.

COMFORTING HIM, KEEPING HIM
CALM.

RAY PAGE THEN GOES TO GET HIS
TRUCK.

I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND A
MEDIC.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

VICTIMS PILING INTO HIS PICKUP.

RAY PAGE DELIVERING DOUG AND THE
OTHERS TO SAFETY.

AND IT WOULD BE 14 AGONIZING
HOURS UNTIL DOUG WAS REUNITED
WITH HIS FAMILY.

DID YOU KNOW HE WAS HIT?

I HAD NO IDEA UNTIL 1200 THE
NEXT DAY WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN
THE HOSPITAL.

THANKFUL TO THE HEROES WHO SAVED
HIS DAD.

JUST AMAZING THERE WAS
SOMEBODY THERE TO HELP MY DAD
AND HE WAS -- I THOUGHT HE WAS
ON THE STREET SOMEWHERE.

I HAD NO IDEA.

MATT POLICE ARE CALLING THAT
SECURITY GUARD A TRUE HERO.

POLICE ARE SAYING AS THAT GUARD
NEARED THE DOOR IT DIVERTED HIS
ATTENTION FROM THE CROWD TO THE
HALLWAY.

HE BEGAN FIRING WILDLY INTO IT
INJURING THAT SECURITY GUARD.

SOMEHOW THAT GUARD MANAGED TO
GET AWAY AND ALERT AUTHORITIES.

HE'S BEING HAILED AS A HERO AS
THE CITY CONTINUES TO MOURN.

THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE HERE AT THIS MEMORIAL
SITE ALL DAY DAVID.

ALSO TONIGHT, WHAT WAS
WRITTEN ON A NOTE FOUND IN THE
GUNMAN'S HOTEL ROOM AS WE
LEARNED HOW MUCH THE GUNMAN MADE
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK
AND THE MILLIONS HE MADE IN JUST
ONE YEAR.

TO THE US FROM THE PHILIPPINES
TWO DAYS AGO, BUT TONIGHT
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT A
CLOSE WATCH ON MARILOU DANLEY TO
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T TRY TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY AS THEY
STRUGGLE TO FIND THE MOTIVE
BEHIND HER BOYFRIEND'S CRIME.

WE HAVE NO CREDIBLE
INFORMATION TO REPORT TO YOU AS
TO MOTIVATION.

POLICE SAY THEY ARE SKEPTICAL OF
DANLEY'S CLAIMS THAT SHE KNEW
NOTHING ABOUT THE PLANS OF HER
LONGTIME BOYFRIEND
STEPHEN PADDOCK.

BUT A FAMILY FRIEND WHO VISITED
THEM IN NEVADA SAY THAT COULD
WELL BE TRUE, THAT SHE WAS
SUBSERVIENT TO HIM.

IT'S NOT WHAT I SAW AS A
LOVING, CARING RELATIONSHIP.

AN AUSTRALIAN TV STATION HE
SPENT A WEEK WITH THE COUPLE IN
NEVADA IN 2015, STAYING WITH
THEM IN A LUXURY CASINO SUITE,
AND LATER AT HIS HOME, WHERE
PADDOCK SHOWED OFF WHAT HE
CALLED HIS GUN ROOM.

HE WAS VERY STRICT AND VERY
FIRM ON THE FACT THAT IT IS A
RIGHT, IT IS A CAPACITY, AND IT
IS THE FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN
RESIDENT AND PERSON TO
PARTICIPATE, TO OWN A GUN AND
USE IT AS SEEN FIT WHEN NEED BE.

AND THAT LAW SHOULD NEVER BE
CHANGED.

AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED REPORTS
THE SHOOTER LEFT BEHIND SOME
KIND OF A NOTE, WHICH
AUTHORITIES SAY CONTAINED A
SERIES OF CRYPTIC NUMBERS, BUT
WAS NOT A SUICIDE NOTE.

OFFICIALS ARE TRACKING EVERY
ASPECT OF HIS LIFE, BACK TO HIGH
SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES AND
EARLIER, AND HIS RECENT
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VALIUM.

WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY
ASPECT FROM BIRTH TO DEATH OF
THIS SUSPECT IN THIS CASE.

BEFORE THE SHOOTING, OFFICIALS
TELL ABC NEWS HE WAS IN THE
COMPANY OF PROSTITUTES AND WENT
GAMBLING IN THE MANDALAY BAY
CASINO, WINNING BIG JACKPOTS ON
BOTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS.

BRIAN YOU WERE SAYING
STEPHEN PADDOCK CALLED HIMSELF A
PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER.

AND YOU'RE LEARNING HOW MUCH HE
MADE IN ONE YEAR ALONE?

IN THE YEAR 2015 HE REPORTED
INCOME OF $5 MILLION.

FINALLY TONIGHT, SINGER
KEITH URBAN AT A VIGIL IN
NASHVILLE FOR THE VICTIMS IN LAS
VEGAS.

HE TALKED ABOUT A QUESTION FROM
HIS 9-YEAR-OLD AND PERFORMED A
SONG.

TONIGHT WE REMEMBER 58 NAMES, 58
FACES LOST.

MY 9-YEAR-OLD AS I WAS
DRIVING HER TO SCHOOL SAID TO
ME, DAD, YOU SEEM QUIET.

I SAID, YEAH.

I'M REALLY -- A LOT OF PEOPLE
KILLED LAST NIGHT.

AND SHE SAID DID YOU KNOW ANY OF
THEM?

AND I SAID, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

AND THEN SHE SAID, WELL, THEN
WHY ARE YOU SO SAD?

I SAID, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THESE WERE INNOCENT PEOPLE.
