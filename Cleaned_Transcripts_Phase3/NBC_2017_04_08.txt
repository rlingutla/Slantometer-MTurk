ON THIS SATURDAY
NIGHT, RISING TENSIONS
AFTER THE USAIR STRIKE
ON SYRIA, RUSSIA TAKES
A HARD LINE, SENDING A
WARSHIP TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN, VOICING
NEW SUPPORT FOR THE
ASSAD REGIME.

REVERBERATIONS ON A
STRIKE ON AN SYRIAN
AIRFIELD ARE GETTING
LOUDER, NOT JUST IN
WORDS BUT IN ACTION.

RUSSIAN AND SYRIA
MILITARY JETS RESUMED
MISSIONS TODAY.

DASHING HOPES OF A NEW
FRIENDLIER
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
VLADIMIR PUTIN AND
DONALD TRUMP.

ALL THIS JUST DAYS
BEFORE SECRETARY OF
STATE REX TILLERSON
HEADS TO MOSCOW FOR
MEETINGS WITH TOP
OFFICIALS.

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
RICHARD ENGEL IN
STATE TV BROADCASTING
FROM SYRIA AT THE AIR
BASE THAT IS
DESTROYED.

FOOTAGE SHOWS SOME
DAMAGE AND DEFIANTLY
FIGHTER JETS TAXIYING
AND TAKING OFF IN
BROAD DAYLIGHT.

LOCAL RESIDENTS
FILMING IT ON THEIR
CELL PHONES.

IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE
AIRCRAFT WERE FLOWN BY
SYRIAN OR RUSSIAN
PILOTS, BUT THE
MESSAGE IS CLEAR THE
U.S. STRIKE CHANGED
LITTLE.

NEW IMAGES SHOW THE
TOWN HIT BY A CHEMICAL
ATTACK WHICH THE U.S.
SAYS WAS HIT BY THAT
BASE IT IS A GHOST
TOWN NOW, BUT THERE
WERE MORE AIR STRIKES
TODAY.

JUST SO RUSSIA'S POINT
COULDN'T BE MISSED,
MOSCOW IS SENDING THIS
WAR SHIP, THE ADMIRAL,
ARMED WITH ITS OWN
CRUISE MISSILES TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN.

THE PRIME MINISTER
WARNED ON FACEBOOK
THAT WASHINGTON AND
MOSCOW WERE JUST ON
THE VERGE OF CONFLICT.

ALL OF IT IS A SHARP
WARNING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP, DON'T ATTACK
RUSSIA'S ALLIES AGAIN.

THINGS THAT THE
RUSSIANS ARE SAYING
AND THE RUSSIANS ARE
DOING IS IN MANY
RESPECTS FOR THEIR
MISSILE STRIKES WERE
WELCOMED AROUND THE
WORLD, CRITICS ARE
INCREASINGLY ASKING IF
THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAS A
THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY.

THE CURRENT POLICY
SEEMS FULL OF
CONTRADICTION
EXPRESSING CONCERN FOR
CIVILIAN SUFFERING IN
SYRIA.

BEAUTIFUL BABIES.

TRYING TO BAN ALL
SYRIAN REFUGEES FROM
ENTERING THE UNITED
STATES, BOMBING THE
SYRIAN REGIME AND
BOMBING GROUPS THE
REGIME IS FIGHTING
ATTACKING BOTH SIDES
IN A CIVIL WAR SOME
MIGHT SAY IS NO POLICY
AT ALL.

TODAY THE SECRETARY OF
STATE TILLERSON WHO
NEXT WEEK MEETS WITH
VLADIMIR PUTIN SPOKE
WITH HIS RUSSIAN
COUNTERPART WHO
INSISTED THERE WAS NO
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK IN SYRIA.

SO THERE IS STILL A
LINE OF COMMUNICATIONS
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

BUT THEY SEEM TO BE
TALKING PAST EACH
OTHER.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
DEFENDED THE SYRIAN
OPERATION TODAY AND
PRAISED THOSE WHO
CARRIED IT OUT, BUT
ANOTHER FIGHT WAS
GOING ON INSIDE THE
WHITE HOUSE.

SEVERAL HOURS AT THE
TRUMP GOLF RESORT NEAR
HIS PALM BEACH HOME
PRAISE FROM HIS
TWITTER ACCOUNT
CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR
GREAT MILITARY MEN AND
WOMEN FROM THEIR ROLE
ON THE STRIKE ON
SYRIA.

ALSO TODAY THE
PRESIDENT IN
TRADITIONAL LETTER
FORM WROTE TO CONGRESS
WITH HIS OFFICIAL
LEGAL BASIS CLAIMING
HIS PURPOSE, TO
DEGRADE THE SYRIAN
MILITARY'S ABILITY TO
CONDUCT FURTHER
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACKS AND HIS POWER
BY ACTING IN THE
FOREIGN POLICY
INTERESTS OF THE
UNITED STATES
REASONING THAT BOTH
CONFLICTS AND SUPPORTS
PAST CAMPAIGN
POSITIONS.

ON THE ONE HAND
HE'S ATTACKED THE
ASSAD REGIME AND HE'S
FOLLOWING THROUGH THE
COMMITMENT TO PUT MORE
FORCES ON THE GROUND
TO RID SYRIA OF ISIS.

INTERNATIONAL
HEADLINES FROM
FRIENDLY NATIONS,
SLASHED APPROVAL, BUT
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE
SPLINTERED POWER.

AMONG THE PRESIDENT'S
SENIOR TEAM.

CHIEF STRATEGIST STEVE
BANNON HAS DESCRIBED
TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW
JARED KUSHNER AS WEST
WING DEMOCRAT DETACHED
FROM TRUMP'S
CONSERVATIVE BASE.

ADD TO THAT, CRITICISM
AIMED AT CHIEF OF
STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS
AFTER SOURCES SAY THE
PRESIDENT PEPPERED
ALLIES SEEKING TO
ASSIGN BLAME OVER THE
HEALTH CARE FAILURE,
RUMORS OF A
RESHUFFLING, BUT
TONIGHT THE POWER TRIO
HELD A LONG MEETING.

IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A
BURY THE HATCHET
SETTING.

IT HAS DRIVEN CRITICAL
STORIES OF THE WHITE
HOUSE OF WHO'S UP AND
WHO'S DOWN.

THE PRESIDENT WAS
AWARE OF THIS MEETING
AND IS PLEASED WITH
THE OUTCOME.

AFTER THE STRIKE IN
SYRIA SOME OF
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOST
ARDENT SUPPORTERS ARE
ASKING WHAT HAPPENED
TO ONE OF THE CORE
PRINCIPLES, THE
CORNERSTONE TO HIS
CAMPAIGN AND HIS
ADMINISTRATION.

IT IS GOING TO BE
AMERICA FIRST.

REMEMBER THAT.

PRESIDENT TRUMP A TWO
WORD WORLD VIEW.

AMERICA FIRST.

AMERICA FIRST, AMERICA
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS
HE RAILED AGAINST
INTERVENTION AND THEN
CAME HIS SYRIAN STRIKE
AND THE NEAR IMMEDIATE
BACKLASH FROM HIS
BASE.

THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

THIS IS NOT WHAT WE
VOTED FOR.

CONSPIRACY THEORIST.

MAKING SURE THAT THE
AIR STRIKE SEEMS LIKE
A
BETRAYAL.

YOU ARE SEEING A
LOT OF DISTURBANCE IN
THE FORCE THAT REALLY
BELIEVED THAT DONALD
TRUMP REPRESENTED A
VERY VERY SHORT BREAK
WITH THE BUSH ERA
FOREIGN POLICY AND THE
REALITY IS THAT RIGHT
EDITOR OF ONE RIGHT
WING WEBSITE TWEETING
I'M OFFICIALLY OFF THE
TRUMP TRAIN.

ANN COULTER WRITING
THOSE WHO WANTED US
MEDDLING IN MIDDLE
EAST VOTED FOR OTHER
CANDIDATES AND AN
EDITOR QUESTIONED
ABOUT SIGNS OF UNREST
RESPONDING UNREST, I'M
APAPLEPTIC.

I KNOW TRUMP WAS
AMERICA FIRST, BUT
SOMETIMES THAT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK OUT.

SUPPORTERS WATCHFUL.

I DO NOT THINK HE
SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO
AIR STRIKES, BUT IT
WAS A GOOD WARNING.

QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS
FOREIGN POLICY
POSTURE, THE
PRESIDENT'S MOST
NATIONALISTIC
SUPPORTERS AREN'T
TOTALLY TURNING THEIR
BACKS.

REMEMBER THAT EDITOR
WHO SAID HE WAS OFF
THE TRUMP TRAIN?

HE WRITES I HAVE
TRUMP'S BACK.
