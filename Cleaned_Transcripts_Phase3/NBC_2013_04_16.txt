WERE ASSEMBLED INSIDE PRESSURE
COOKER POTS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE
AND NAILS TO MAGNIFY THE INJURY.

AS THESE HOMELAND SECURITY
BULLETINS NOTE, PRESSURE COOKERS
HAVE BEEN USED FOR DECADES IN
TERROR BOMBINGS.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING THEM
APPEAR ON THE INTERNET INCLUDING
JUST LAST MONTH IN AN AL QAEDA
MAGAZINE "INSPIRE."

INVESTIGATORS SAY THE EXPLOSIVE
IN BOSTON WAS MOST LIKELY
SMOKELESS POWDER, GUNPOWDER LIKE
THIS, AVAILABLE AT SPORTING
GOODS STORES, NOT SOMETHING MORE
POWERFUL LIKE DYNAMITE.

AND THEY BELIEVE THE BOMBS WERE
CARRIED TO THE SCENE IN DARK
NYLON BAGS AND SET OFF BY
TIMERS.

THE FBI IS EXAMINING PHOTOS LIKE
THIS FROM NBC AFFILIATE WHDH TO
SEE IF NYLON BAGS MIGHT HAVE
BEEN PLACED IN TRASH BAGS ON THE
SIDEWALK TO APPEAR LESS
CONSPICUOUS.

A FORMER BOMB INVESTIGATOR SAYS
THE EXPERTS KNOW WHAT TO LOOK
FOR.

THEY ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE
THE MINUTE PIECES OF AN ARTICLE
THAT A CIVILIAN WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT A BOMB
INVESTIGATOR LIKE FBI OR ATF
WILL SAY, THAT'S FROM A CLOCK.

THE AREA WAS CHECKED TWICE FOR
BOMBS YESTERDAY, BUT THERE WAS
NO SECURITY SCREENING.

BECAUSE THERE IS UNRESTRICTED
ACCESS TO THE RACE COURSE,
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S 28 MILES
LONG, PEOPLE CAN COME AND GO AND
BRING ITEMS IN AND OUT.

NIGHT SEARCHED THE APARTMENT OF
A FOREIGN STUDENT WHO WAS
INJURED IN THE BLAST AND SEEN
RUNNING AWAY, BUT THEY FOUND
NOTHING, AND HE IS NOT
CONSIDERED A SUSPECT.

INVESTIGATORS URGE ANYONE WHO
WAS AT THE SCENE YESTERDAY TO
SEND THEM PICTURES AND VIDEOS.

ONE PERSON RESPONDING, BEN
THORNDIKE, WHO WORKS IN A
BUILDING THAT OVERLOOKS THE
FINISH LINE.

HE SNAPPED THESE PICTURES IN
RAPID SEQUENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THE FIRST EXPLOSION.

ONE PERSON CAN BE SEEN RUNNING
AWAY, CLOTHES TORN BY THE BLAST.

I JUST KEPT THE CAMERA UP,
JUST PUSHED THE RAPID SHUTTER
BUTTON DOWN AND JUST TOOK, YOU
KNOW, 25 PICTURES OVER THE
COURSE OF -- IF FELT LIKE A LONG
TIME, BUT I THINK IT WAS ONLY 15
OR 20 SECONDS.

AGENTS EVEN TOOK THE HIGHLY
UNUSUAL STEP OF ASKING PEOPLE
LEAVING BOSTON AT THE AIRPORT
TODAY IF THEY HAD PICTURES OF
VALUE, TOO.

AND THIS BREAKING NEWS ON
ANOTHER NOTE.

AN UNRELATED NOTE.

THE FBI IS ANALYZING AN ENVELOPE
SENT TO A U.S.

SENATOR BUT
INTERCEPTED AT AN OFF-SITE MAIL
SITE.

A FIELD TEST INDICATED IT WAS
POSITIVE FOR THE POISON CALLED
RICIN.

IT'S NOW IN THE LAB TO SEE IF IT
REALLY IS THAT CHEMICAL.

BRIAN, THIS HEAVY POLICE
PRESENCE WILL BE A WAY OF LIFE
FOR BOSTON RESIDENTS FOR SOME
TIME TO COME, BUT THERE WERE
THOUSANDS OF VISITORS HERE,
SPECTATORS, THEY CAME TO BEAR
WITNESS TO A GREAT SPORTING
EVENT.

INSTEAD THEY ARE FILING OUT OF
TOWN HAVING BEARED WITNESS TO
TERROR.

STRAPPED TO HER BODY WITH A VIEW
OF THE FINISH LINE ON THE
HORIZON.

A VIEW THAT CHANGES IN AN
INSTANT.

IT IS ONE OF COUNTLESS IMAGES
THAT CAPTURED THE DAY, IMAGES
AUTHORITIES HOPE ALSO CAPTURED
THE BOMBERS.

SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP.

THERE HAS TO BE HUNDREDS, IF
NOT THOUSANDS, OF PHOTOGRAPHS OR
VIDEOS OR OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE
MADE DOWN AT THAT FINISH LINE
YESTERDAY.

AND THEY'RE SITTING OUT THERE
AMONGST EVERYONE THAT'S WATCHING
THIS EVENT THIS MORNING.

I NEED OFFICERS.

A SECONDARY DEVICE!

EMERGENCY RADIO TRAFFIC HAVE
BEEN RELEASED.

THERE'S MULTIPLE PEOPLE DOWN!

URGENCY OF YESTERDAY'S RESPONSE.

AND TODAY ANOTHER OF THE DEAD
WAS IDENTIFIED.

29-YEAR-OLD KRYSTLE CAMPBELL OF
MEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS.

EVERYBODY THAT KNEW HER LOVED
HER.

SHE LOVED HER JOB.

SHE HAD A HEART OF GOLD.

SHE WOULD ALWAYS SMILE.

YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER
DAUGHTER.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS
HAPPENED.

NORTH CAROLINA EMERGENCY ROOM
PHYSICIAN, WAS WAITING FOR HIS
WIFE TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE.

HE SAW THE EXPLOSION AND
ATTENDED TO THE MOST SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED.

IT WAS BLAST INJURIES TO THE
LOWER EXTREMITIES FOR THE MOST
PART.

ONE GENTLEMAN HAD NO LEGS BELOW
THE KNEES.

THE BOMBS WERE PLACED AMONG THE
CROWD DOWN THE BLOCK FROM EACH
OTHER, DETONATING JUST OVER TEN
SECONDS APART.

OFFICIALLY, IT WAS BACK TO
BUSINESS IN MOST OF BOSTON
TODAY.

BUT REMINDERS ARE EVERYWHERE
THAT THINGS ARE NOT BACK TO
NORMAL.

YOU SEE PEOPLE, AND THEIR
FACES ARE REALLY SOBER, JUST
WALKING AROUND.

IT'S KIND OF AN EERIE FEELING IN
THE AIR.

ABLE TO RETURN TO THE ROUTE TO
COLLECT BELONGINGS THAT WERE
LEFT IN THE HASTE OF YESTERDAY'S
FLEE TO SAFETY.

SOME WERE GIVEN MEDALS FOR A
RACE THEY WERE UNABLE TO
COMPLETE.

MEDALS HOPELESSLY TARNISHED BY
TRAGEDY.

I RAN 22 MILES THINKING ABOUT
THE MINUTE WHEN I WAS GOING TO
COME DOWN THE STREET AND GET
THIS MEDAL.

AND IT'S, LIKE, THIS IS NOT HOW
I WANTED IT, BUT IT'S AROUND MY
NECK, AND I WAS A PART OF THIS
DAY.

NUMBER OF STORIES THAT WILL
BREAK YOUR HEART HERE INCLUDING
THE STORY OF THE SECOND VICTIM,
KRYSTLE CAMPBELL.

HER PARENTS WERE FIRST TOLD THAT
IT WAS HER FRIEND WHO DIED,
BRIAN, BUT DOCTORS HAD TO RETURN
AND TELL THEM IT WAS KRYSTLE WHO
PASSED AWAY.

YOU HEAR THE CHURCH BELLS BEHIND
US.

THEY STARTED OFF WITH "GOD BLESS
AMERICA" A FEW MINUTES BACK.

THIS ENTIRE CITY, OF COURSE,
CONSUMED WITH WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY.

AND SO MANY QUESTIONS AND
STORIES ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF
THIS.

KATY TUR, PART OF OUR TEAM HERE
AS WELL, SHE'S BEEN LOOKING INTO
THE VICTIMS ALL DAY.

BRIAN, THEY WERE STANDING ON
THE SIDELINES CHEERING ON LOVED
ONES, FRIENDS AND EVEN
STRANGERS.

THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN CHAOS.

TONIGHT WE'RE LEARNING MORE
ABOUT THE TRAUMA OF THOSE FIRST
FEW MOMENTS INCLUDING THE
VICTIMS.

AND AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY EXCITED TO
SEE A MARATHON.

REMEMBERED 8-YEAR-OLD MARTIN
RICHARD, THE YOUNGEST OF THE
VICTIMS.

TO KNOW THAT THAT LITTLE BOY
WILL NEVER COME HOME AGAIN IS --
IT KEPT ME UP TONIGHT, AND IT
WILL PROBABLY KEEP ME UP MORE
NIGHTS.

CROWD WATCHING THE MARATHON WITH
HIS PARENTS, 11-YEAR-OLD BROTHER
AND 5-YEAR-OLD SISTER CLOSE TO
WHERE THE BLAST WENT OFF.

HE WAS KILLED.

HIS MOM AND SISTER RIGHT NOW ARE
IN VERY BAD SHAPE.

IN A STATEMENT, HIS FATHER, BILL
RICHARD, WROTE, "MY DEAR SON
MARTIN HAS DIED FROM INJURIES
SUSTAINED IN THE ATTACK ON
BOSTON.

MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER ARE BOTH
RECOVERING FROM SERIOUS
INJURIES.

WE THANK OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,
THOSE WE KNOW AND THOSE WE HAVE
NEVER MET, FOR THEIR THOUGHTS
AND PRAYERS."

WE'RE A VERY CLOSE COMMUNITY,
AND WE ARE ALL DEVASTATED.

IN FRONT OF HIS HOME OVER THE
WEEKEND DREW NEIGHBORS AND
FRIENDS WHO LEFT FLOWERS AND
CANDLES IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE
YOUNG BOY.

AT THE FINISH LINE IT ONLY TOOK
MOMENTS FOR A JOYOUS
ACCOMPLISHMENT TO TURN TO
TERRIFYING CONFUSION.

78-YEAR-OLD BILL IFFRIG WAS JUST
FEET FROM THE EXPLOSION, ABOUT
WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE?

WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE?

IT WAS SO LOUD.

BOOM!

SAID TO YOU?

THEY SAID, DAD, YOU ARE SO
LUCKY.

YEAH, I WAS REALLY LUCKY THAT IT
ENDED UP LIKE IT DID.

NEWTOWN SHOOTING VICTIMS WERE AT
THE RACE, BUT NONE WERE INJURED.

STILL MANY OTHERS WERE.

IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
HORRIBLE SCENE, AND WHAT WE WERE
ABLE TO DO IS PULL TOGETHER WHAT
WE NEEDED TO PULL TOGETHER IN A
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

JUST DIDN'T SEEM REAL.

WERE WATCHING THE RACE.

SHE WAS LEFT WITH SHRAPNEL IN
HER LEG AND A SHATTERED FEMUR.

NOW SHE REMEMBERS THE COMPASSION
OF THOSE WHO RUSHED TO HELP.

I HAD A WOMAN WHO I DON'T
KNOW CAME AND HELD MY HAND.

WITH LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES
TAKEN TO HOSPITALS.

THEY AND DOZENS OF OTHERS ARE
TRYING TO RECOVER TONIGHT.

AND RIGHT NOW 24 REMAIN IN
CRITICAL CONDITION.

REGIONAL BLOOD BANKS ARE ASKING
FOR DONATIONS FROM SURROUNDING
STATES, BRIAN, AS BOSTON HAS
DEPLETED ALL OF THEIR SUPPLIES.

AS WE SAID, IT'S CONSUMED
THIS ENTIRE CITY.

AND TONIGHT, GOVERNOR OF
MASSACHUSETTS DEVAL PATRICK IS
WITH US FROM THE COMMAND POST AT
THE WESTIN HOTEL NOT FAR FROM US
HERE.

GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING
WITH US.

FIRST OF ALL, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE INSIDE ALL
DAY, ANYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED?

ANY IMAGERY YOU'VE SEEN THAT
WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THEY'RE
ANY FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD?

WELL, I THINK YOUR REPORTS
ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE
INVESTIGATION ARE PRETTY
THOROUGH.

WHAT WE KNOW, WE HAVE MADE
PUBLIC OR MOST OF IT ANYHOW.

THE INVESTIGATORS AT THE
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL
ARE COORDINATING BEAUTIFULLY,
AND WE HAVE EVERY CONCEIVABLE
ASSET ON THE GROUND, AND THEY
ARE LITERALLY COMBING THE BLAST
SITE WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB TO
PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED AND
ULTIMATELY THE STORY OF HOW AND
BRING WHOMEVER IS RESPONSIBLE TO
JUSTICE.

IT'S A SLOW PROCESS.

IT'S A PAINFUL ONE.

BUT THERE ARE ALSO ALONGSIDE
THIS, BRIAN, SOME EXTRAORDINARY
STORIES OF GRACE AND KINDNESS
THAT PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN, BOTH
NEIGHBORS FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND
VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE
CITY AND THE STATE.

I HEARD YOUR PUBLIC PLEA,
GOVERNOR, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS
HELPED BY AN ARMY SERGEANT JUST
BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN.

YOU'RE HELPING TO FIND HIM TO
REUNITE HIM WITH HER.

ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE
LOSE YOU.

AND THAT IS, IT WAS STRIKING
YESTERDAY, THIS HAPPENED WITH
BOSTON PD OFFICERS IN THE
FOREGROUND, MEANING IF YOU CAN
GET A DEVICE INTO AN ALREADY
SECURED AREA, WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO MEAN FOR DEFENDING CITIES
LIKE BOSTON?

WELL, I THINK THE THING TO
REMEMBER HERE -- MAYBE TWO
THINGS TO REMEMBER.

FIRST OF ALL, THE FIRST JOB OF
EVERYBODY IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED
AND PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED AND
TO BRING THAT PERSON OR PERSONS
TO JUSTICE.

AND THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT
IS FOCUSED ON.

THE SECOND THING, THEN, IS TO
SORT OUT HOW THIS COULD HAVE
HAPPENED.

YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD 116 YEARS OF
INCIDENT-FREE MARATHONS.

AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE LEARNED
LESSONS FROM THE ONE BEFORE.

IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE AND
BLOODY LESSON WE'RE HAVING TO
LEARN THIS TIME.

BUT I AM ALSO CONFIDENT THAT WE
WILL LEARN WHAT LESSONS THERE
ARE TO BE LEARNED, AND NEXT
YEAR'S MARATHON WILL BE BIGGER
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

THE GOVERNOR OF THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS,
DEVAL PATRICK, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.

WE'RE BACK AT THE CORNER OF
THE PUBLIC GARDEN HERE IN
BOSTON.

THE NEXT MAJOR MARATHON IS THIS
SUNDAY IN LONDON.

FOR THAT MATTER THERE'S A MAJOR
SPORTING EVENT EVERY DAY ALL
YEAR ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

AND THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW TO DEFEND AND SECURE THOSE.

TOM COSTELLO IS AT THE VERIZON
CENTER IN WASHINGTON WHERE
THERE'S AN NHL GAME TONIGHT.

THE CAPITALS PLAYING THE TORONTO
MAPLE LEAFS.

AND THE ATTACK ON BOSTON VERY
MUCH ON THE MINDS OF PEOPLE HERE
AS WELL AS AT SPORTING EVENTS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

BUT THERE IS ALSO A
DETERMINATION NOT TO BOW TO
TERRORISTS.

ON THIS DAY AFTER, MANY
AMERICANS FELT ON EDGE LIKE THEY
HAVEN'T IN YEARS.

SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES BROUGHT
BOSTON'S LOGAN AND NEW YORK'S
TODAY.

BOTH WERE LATER DEEMED SAFE.

IN WASHINGTON, A HEAVY POLICE
PRESENCE IN THE SUBWAYS.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE SHUT DOWN.

CAPITOL POLICE CHECKED EVERY
TRASH CAN FOR EXPLOSIVES.

WHILE AT THE EMANCIPATION DAY
PARADE, BOTH UNEASE --
 I WAS KIND OF CONCERNED AS TO
WHO'S HERE, YOU KNOW, WHY
THEY'RE HERE, IF ANYTHING'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

ARE WE SAFE?

I CAME DOWN.

I'M NOT GOING TO BE AFRAID.

THIS IS MY HOME.

THE BADGE TODAY.

THE TSA ALSO STUFFING UP
PASSENGER SCREENINGS.

MEANWHILE, EVENT ORGANIZERS
BEGAN REVISITING SECURITY PLANS
FOR BIG UPCOMING GATHERINGS.

THE OKLAHOMA CITY MARATHON, A
BIKE RACE IN HOUSTON, A 10K IN
MIAMI, NASCAR IN VIRGINIA, EVEN
THE KENTUCKY DERBY AND INDY 500
GETTING A SECOND LOOK.

I THINK THE EVENT IN BOSTON
YESTERDAY WILL RAISE ONCE AGAIN
THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THERE IS
A REASON, THERE IS A NEED FOR
THE EXTRA SECURITY THAT THEY
ENCOUNTER.

BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE
USE OF SECURITY CAMERAS.

TODAY AN INFLUENTIAL REPUBLICAN
CALLED FOR EVEN MORE.

OUT ON THE STREET, THERE'S
NOT AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY.

INTELLIGENCE NERVE CENTER, THE
POLICE CHIEF INSISTED HIS
CAMERAS AND OFFICERS CAN'T DO IT
ALONE.

THERE IS NO WAY THAT 10,000
LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFICERS CAN
WATCH OVER A CITY OF 4 MILLION
PEOPLE.

WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE PEOPLE
THAT THEY'RE WATCHING.

9/11, IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY
SOMETHING.

POLICE AND SECURITY EXPERTS ARE
REITERATED TO US TODAY THAT THEY
REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO CALL IN
WITH TIPS AND WITH EVEN THE
SMALLEST BITS OF INFORMATION.

THEY POINT OUT THAT IN THE PAST,
THOSE SMALL CLUES HAVE VERY
OFTEN BEEN THE KEY TO TRACKING
DOWN A CRIMINAL OR BREAKING A
TERROR SUSPECT OR CELL.

WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH SOME
OF THE STORIES THAT EMERGED
TODAY HERE IN BOSTON.

THOSE WHO STEPPED UP AT AN AWFUL
MOMENT YESTERDAY.

FINALLY TONIGHT FROM BOSTON,
INEVITABLY WHEN SOMETHING BAD
LIKE THIS HAPPENS, TERRIFIC
STORIES OF HEROISM AND KINDNESS
EMERGE.

CHARACTER, THEN CALL BOSTON
COURAGEOUS.

CARLOS ARREDONDO, THE MAN IN THE
COWBOY HAT, IS ONE OF MANY WHO
RAN TO HELP INSTEAD OF RUNNING
AWAY.

I WAS CARRYING SOMEONE WHO
LOST BOTH OF THEIR LEGS.

HORROR, HE REMEMBERED HIS LOWEST
POINT, WHEN HE LEARNED HIS SON
ALEX, A MARINE, HAD BEEN KILLED
IN IRAQ.

GRIEF STRICKEN, HE SET HIMSELF
ON FIRE AND WAS RESCUED.

HE RECALLED HIS WIFE'S WORDS OF
COMFORT AS HE CALMED JEFF
BAUMANN JR.
BAUMANN LOST HIS LOWER LEGS BUT
SURVIVED.

WHAT I EXPERIENCED MYSELF, I
GIVE SOMETHING TO COMFORT HIM
AND GIVE HIM HOPE AND GET HIM
OUT OF THERE AS SOON AS WE
COULD.

KIND.

PETER DEANDRADE LIVES TWO BLOCKS
FROM WHERE THE BOMBS WENT OFF.

LEFTOVERS FROM HIS PRE-RACE
PARTY WERE POST-RACE SUSTENANCE
TO CONFUSED RUNNERS.

WE CARRIED EVERYTHING OUT ON
PLATTERS AND STARTED FEEDING
PEOPLE AND BROUGHT OUT COFFEE.

THE LITTLE THINGS WE COULD DO,
MY FRIENDS AND I, TO HELP PEOPLE
OUT IN THIS TRAGEDY.

BEEN DIVIDED BY CLASS, ETHNICITY
AND RACE, BUT IT'S ALWAYS COME
TOGETHER ON MARATHON DAY, NEVER
MORE THAN IN 2013 WHEN NEARLY
6,000 PEOPLE OFFERED THEIR HOMES
ONLINE TO STRANDED RUNNERS.

YES, YOU CAN CALL BOSTON
GENEROUS.

MARGUERITE SMITH INVITED THREE
RUNNERS AND THEIR FIVE FRIENDS
INTO HER HOME AND FED THE
SHIVERING GROUP FROM KANSAS
CITY.

THEY WERE SITTING THERE NOT
ABLE TO GET INTO THEIR HOTEL,
NOT HAVING EATEN, AND THEY
WEREN'T COMPLAINING.

THEY WERE JUST VERY CHARMING.

ALLIE HATFIELD, POSTED PICTURES
ON HER BLOG WRITING "PEOPLE ARE
GOOD."

AND ONE MORE NOTE BEFORE WE
GO.

IT TAKES SOMETHING BIG FOR THIS
TO HAPPEN.

THE YANKEES AND RED SOX LOGOS
SIDE BY SIDE RIGHT THERE ON THE
SIDE OF YANKEE STADIUM IN THE
BRONX WHERE TONIGHT THE YANKEES
WILL PAUSE TO PLAY THE FENWAY
ANTHEM "SWEET CAROLINE" AS THE
ULTIMATE SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR
BOSTON.

THE RIVALRY TAKES A BREAK.

IT WILL BE BACK.
