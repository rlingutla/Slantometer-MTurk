FIRST OF ALL, THE CENTER OF THIS
THING IS NOW OFF THE COAST,
ABOUT 75 MILES EAST OF THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

THE MOUNTAINS OF PUERTO RICO
TOOK A LITTLE STEAM OUT OF IT.

IT'S A CATEGORY 2 NOW,
110-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS.

IT MAY VERY WELL STRENGTHEN
AGAIN AS IT HEADS TOWARDS THE
TURKS AND CAICOS.

SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE MOST
POPULATED AREAS THERE.

GETTING UP TOWARDS THE CAROLINAS
COME MONDAY.

WHAT IT DOES AFTER THAT,
CERTAINLY SOME QUESTION MARKS,
BUT OUR LONGER TERM MODELS, AS
YOU MENTIONED, DO HAVE IT COMING
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE
COASTLINE, MAYBE COMING UP
TOWARDS NEW ENGLAND, MAYBE
TAKING A VERY JOSE-LIKE TRACK.

TOO SOON TO TELL WHETHER IT WILL
IMPACT THE U.S. DIRECTLY.

BUT SOMETHING WE'LL BE WATCHING
VERY, VERY CLOSELY IN THE COMING
DAYS.
