IN THE VIDEO, THE AUTHORITIES
SAY THE WHITE SMOKE INDICATES A
BOMB BUILT WITH LOW-VELOCITY
EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES, NOT MILITARY
GRADE.

SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP!

RUN!

THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE
RESOURCES AS WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER
BOMB ATTACKS, BUT THEY KNEW HOW
TO MAKE THE BOMB GO BOOM.

LARGE PIECES OF METAL, AS SEEN
HERE IN THE AIR, SUGGEST THE
BOMBS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCEALED
IN OR UNDER A MAILBOX OR TRASH
BARREL, AS ONE WITNESS
DESCRIBED.

I LITERALLY SAW THE GARBAGE
BARREL EXPLODE.

I SAW AT THE FLASH, THE FIRE,
THE SMOKE, AND I RAN AS FAST AS
I COULD.

THE FORMER HEAD OF THE ATF.

ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY
COLLECT IT IS, IT MIGHT NOT LOOK
LIKE MUCH.

BUT TO INVESTIGATORS,
EVERY SMALL PIECE OF EVIDENCE
THEY COLLECT WILL BE A TREASURE
TROVE.

OUT, IT WILL BE NO SURPRISE TO
COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS WHO
HAVE WARNED ABOUT THEIR POSSIBLE
USE WITH READILY AVAILABLE
COMPONENTS FOR YEARS.

THERE ARE NUMEROUS DESCRIPTIONS
ONLINE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A
PRESSURE-COOKER BOMB, INCLUDING
THIS DETAILED ONE POSTED IN AN
AL QAEDA INTERNET PUBLICATION.

APRIL IS ALSO A MONTH WITH
SIGNIFICANCE FOR DOMESTIC TERROR
GROUPS.

THE MONTH OF THE WACO RAID AND
THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

AS PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE CLEAR
TODAY, THERE'S STILL NO EVIDENCE
OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ACT OF TERRORISM.

THIS WAS A HEINOUS AND
COWARDLY ACT, AND GIVEN WHAT WE
NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE,
THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING IT AS
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.

US THEY HAVE TONS OF VIDEO, AND
SOMEWHERE IN THERE WILL BE A
PICTURE OF THE PERSON WHO
PLANTED THESE TWO BOMBS, DIANE.

SPEAKING OF PICTURES, I WANT
TO ASK YOU ABOUT A PHOTO THAT
EVERYBODY WAS E-MAILING TODAY.

IT IS A MAN STANDING UP ON TOP
OF A ROOF.

YOU CAN MOVE IN THERE, YOU SEE
IT RIGHT THERE.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

INTRIGUING, BUT AUTHORITIES SAY
THEY'RE GIVING IT NO SPECIAL
PRIORITY.

IT'S ONE OF MANY TIPS AND LEADS
THEY'RE FOLLOWING.

THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE
PERSON WHO HAD THAT UNUSUALLY
HEAVY BLACK BAG THE DAY OF THE
RACE.

AS YOU SAID THE STRONGEST
CLUES ARE IN THE NATURE OF THE
BOMB.

LIKELY CONTAINED LESS THAN TWO
POUNDS OF COMMON BLACK POWDER
EXPLOSIVE, SAYS ONE OF THE
NATIONS LEADING IED EXPERTS.

EVEN LEAVING THE CHARACTERISTIC
WHITE SMOKE.

BOMBS DESIGNED TO SPREAD TERROR
AND DEATH WITH A LETHAL BLAST OF
METAL SHRAPNEL.

LOOKS LIKE HE WAS OUT TO KILL
AND MAIM.

HERE WE SEE WINDOWS BLOWN OUT
HERE, BUT THE BUILDINGS
THEMSELVES ARE INTACT.

WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT
WHAT THIS BOMBER WANTED TO DO?

THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE
DOWN THE BUILDING.

THAT WASN'T HIS MAIN TARGET.

IT WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARATHON
AND KILL PEOPLE IN THAT
IMMEDIATE AREA.

IS CLASSIC IED DESIGN, THE KILL
ZONE FROM THE BLAST, ONE TO TWO
YARDS.

ACCORDING TO THE ACCOUNTS FROM
THE BOMB'S SITE, POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO KNOCK A RUNNER OFF HIS FEET
TEN YARDS AWAY.

AND TOPPLE ANOTHER MAN ON HIS
COUCH FROM THE THIRD FLOOR OF
THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR, 20 YARDS
AWAY.

IT LOOKS LIKE A BASIC DESIGN
OF AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE.

HOWEVER, THE PLACEMENT OF IT IS
SOPHISTICATED.

THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WANTED
TO DO.

IS WELL KNOWN BY THE MILITARY AS
A LETHAL BOMB CARRIER, COVERED
IN TRAINING MANUALS AND
EXPLAINED IN VIDEO.

EASILY MADE, EVEN CRUDE.

BUT OUR BOMB EXPERTS SAY THE
PLANNING AND EXECUTION TELL US
THAT THE TERRORIST WAS
WELL-TRAINED.

I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT'S
A LONE ACTOR.

HE'S DEFINITELY BEEN WORKING ON
THIS FOR A WHILE, THE PLANNING
AND WORKING ON PUTTING THE
DEVICES TOGETHER.

CLUES SO FAR TELL OUR EXPERT
WHETHER THIS TERRORIST WAS PART
OF ANY ONE ORGANIZATION.

HE MAY HAVE STUDIED LAST YEAR'S
RACE.

PINPOINTING THE MOMENT THE
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RUNNERS
CROSSED THE FINISH LINE.

LAST YEAR, FOUR HOURS AND 18
MINUTES IN, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER,
THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE TIME
HIS BOMB EXPLODED.

FROM BOSTON TONIGHT WE HAVE NEW
IMAGES OF A CITY INTERRUPTED,
HALF-EATEN SANDWICHES ABANDONED
WHERE THE BOMBS WENT OFF.

AS DAN HARRIS GIVES US NEW
INSIGHT, TAKING US BEHIND THOSE
IMAGES WE ALL WATCHED TOGETHER
AS IT HAPPENED.

IS GIVING US FRESH, FRIGHTENING
INSIGHT INTO THE ATTACKS.

LOOK AT THIS CELLPHONE FOOTAGE,
SHOT BY A SPECTATOR STANDING
BETWEEN THE TWO BOMBS.

AFTER THE FIRST EXPLOSION,
THERE'S CONFUSION, BUT RELATIVE
CALM AS PEOPLE MOVE AWAY.

BUT THEN AFTER 11 SECONDS GO
BY -- AFTER THE SECOND SPLOGE
EXPLOSION, PANIC.

IN THE AFTERMATH, YOU CAN SEE
PEOPLE RUNNING ALONGSIDE WALKS,
CARPETED IN GLASS -- AND
VICTIMS.

ARE YOU OKAY?

I HAVE A VICTIM HERE WITH
SHRAPNEL IN THE LEG.

TRAFFIC TAKES US FURTHER INSIDE
THOSE MOMENTS.

GET ANOTHER AMBULANCE DOWN
HERE AT 755 BOYLSTON.

THEY ARE ON THE WAY, SIR,
THEY ARE ON THE WAY.

FACE OF NICOLE GROSS, ONE OF
THREE MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY
INJURED.

AND THAT 78-YEAR-OLD RUNNER WHO
WAS KNOCKED DOWN BUT PICKED
HIMSELF UP AND FINISHED THE
RACE.

TODAY BOSTON WAS CRAWLING WITH
ARMORED VEHICLES, UNIFORMED
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OFFICERS
ARMED WITH HIGH POWERED RIFLES.

ON A NORMAL TUESDAY AFTERNOON,
THIS PART OF TOWN WOULD BE
CRAWLING WITH FOOT AND ROAD
TRAFFIC, BUT TODAY IT'S ON
LOCKDOWN.

POLICE HAVE SET UP A MASSIVE
CRIME SCENE.

TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE
OF THIS THING, TAKE A LOOKA THE
MAP.

WE ARE ON JUST ONE CORNER OF
WHAT IS A 12-BLOCK CRIME SCENE
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THIS CITY.

ALSO TODAY WE GOT OUR FIRST
DETAILS OF THOSE WHO DID NOT
SURVIVE.

8-YEAR-OLD MARTIN RICHARD.

AND 29-YEAR-OLD KRYSTLE
CAMPBELL.

I COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER
DAUGHTER.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS
HAPPENED.

THAT HER DEATH WAS JUST A WASTE.

LATE TODAY WE LEARNED THAT THE
THIRD VICTIM WAS A GRADUATE
STUDENT AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY.

WE DO NOT HAVE A NAME THERE.

AND OF COURSE SCORES OF OTHER
PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THIS
ATTACK.

THE CURRENT TOTAL STANDS AT 176.

DIANE, TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
HOW BOSTON IS COMING TOGETHER IN
THE WAKE OF THESE ATTACKS, LATE
TODAY, THE RED CROSS ANNOUNCED
THAT IT IS NOW TURNING AWAY
BLOOD DONORS.

THEY SAY THEY ARE SIMPLY AT
CAPACITY.

AND THINKING OF EVERYONE IN
BOSTON TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA
HAD A MESSAGE FOR THE BOMBERS
AND THE WORLD.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REFUSE TO
BE TERRORIZED.

BECAUSE WHAT THE WORLD SAW
YESTERDAY IN THE AFTERMATH OF
THE EXPLOSIONS WERE STORIES OF
HEROISM AND KINDNESS AND
GENEROSITY AND LOVE.

SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WE
ARE, WHAT AMERICA IS, HOW WE
RESPOND TO EVIL, THAT'S IT.

SELFLESSLY, COMPASSIONATELY,
UNAFRAID.

FAMILIES OPENING THEIR HOMES TO
STRANDED MARATHONERS.

A YOUNG BOY COLLECTING HIS
THOUGHTS IN A CHURCH NEAR THE
BOMBINGS, AND A LONE ATHLETE
DEFIANTLY RUNNING ALONG THE
SHORES OF THE CHARLES RIVER
EARLY THIS MORNING.

STILL AHEAD RIGHT HERE ON
"WORLD NEWS," THE 8-YEAR-OLD
MEMBER OF THE LITTLE LEAGUE AND
THE TOWN THAT IS RALLYING AROUND
HIS FAMILY TONIGHT.

ALL DAY TODAY PEOPLE SHARING
PICTURES OF A LITTLE BOY NAMED
MARTIN RICHARD.

AN 8-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS KILLED IN
THE BOMB BLAST YESTERDAY.

HIS MOTHER AND YOUNGER SISTER
WERE HURT TOO.

SMILING EYES OF MARTIN RICHARD
MAKE THE SORROW OF WHAT HAPPENED
MONDAY AFTERNOON ALL THE MORE
PALPABLE.

THE 8-YEAR-OLD WAS KNOWN AS A
LITTLE LEAGUE STAR.

HE WAS THE FASTEST KID, THE
TALLEST ON HIS TEAM.

JUST A MARVEL TO WATCH ON THE
FIELD.

JUST A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG BOY.

FAMILY WENT TO THE BOSTON
MARATHON EVERY YEAR.

BUT ONE OF THOSE TWIN EXPLOSIONS
ENDED HIS SHORT LIFE, SENDING
HIS MOTHER TO THE HOSPITAL WITH
A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY.

HIS YOUNGER SISTER LOST A LEG.

NEIGHBORS IN THIS CLOSE KNIT
COMMUNITY ARE NOW GRIEVING ALONG
WITH MARTIN'S FATHER.

I WAS OUTSIDE WITH MY DOG.

I SAW HIM GET OUT OF THE CAR.

HE WAS DRESSED IN HOSPITAL
SCRUBS AND I SAID, OH, MY GOD,
BILL, ARE YOU OKAY?

AND HE DIDN'T EVEN ANSWER ME.

SUPPORT AND PRAYERS FOR THIS
FAMILY.

ON THIS FACEBOOK PAGE.

IN A STATEMENT BILL RICHARDS
SAID, WE THANK OUR FAMILY AND
FRIENDS, THOSE WE KNOW AND THOSE
WE HAVE NEVER MET, FOR THEIR
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.

WHEN WE WOULD SEE THEM, THEY
WOULD ALL BE TOGETHER, WHETHER
IT WAS AT CHURCH, GOING TO
SCHOOL, ON THE SPORTS FIELD,
IN THE NANED, -- NEIGHBORHOOD,
THEY WERE A VERY ACTIVE FAMILY
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

PILLARS OF THE COMMUNITY.

ITS COMPASSION ETCHED IN CHALK
ON THE DRIVEWAY OF THE FAMILY'S
HOME.

FLOWERS AWAIT THEIR RETURN.

THE TOWN'S CLOCK, FROZEN TO MARK
THAT MOMENT AND THE FLAG AT HALF
STAFF OUTSIDE MARTIN'S SCHOOL
WHERE TEACHERS TONIGHT DESCRIBE
HIM AS AN ENERGETIC YOUNG BOY
WHO HAD BIG DREAMS AND HIGH
HOPES FOR HIS FUTURE.

A VIGIL IS TAKING PLACE TONIGHT
AT THE RICHARDS' FAMILY CHURCH.

AN OUTPOURING OF PRAYERS FOR
MARTIN'S MOTHER AND SISTER WHO
REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL.

AND WHEN WE COME BACK, YOU'LL
MEET A SURGEON WHO KNEW ABOUT
TRAUMA IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.

HE RAN THE MARATHON, AND THEN
FACED IT AGAIN.

N AND AMID THE GRIEF OF THOSE
WHO WERE LOST, THERE WERE SO
MANY PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED US.

EARLIER TODAY I TALKED IT TRAUMA
SURGEON, DR. DAVID KING, WHO HAD
SAVED LIVES IN IRAQ AND
AFGHANISTAN, AND YESTERDAY RAN
THE MARATHON AND THEN DID IT
AGAIN.

YOU COMPLETED THE MARATHON?

THAT'S CORRECT.

I WAS IN THE ATHLETE'S RECOVERY
AREA FOR ABOUT 30 TO 45 MINUTES.

BUT ESSENTIALLY JUST LEFT THERE
WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF AND, OF
COURSE, IMMEDIATELY CAME TO THE
HOSPITAL.

WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF
WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS?

THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM AND LOOKED AT THE
CASUALTIES, WITHOUT EVEN
EXAMINING THE PATIENTS IN
DETAIL, I COULD JUST SEE THE
PATTERN OF INJURY, AND I THOUGHT
TO MYSELF, THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE
I WAS BACK IN IRAQ OR
AFGHANISTAN.

YOU'RE FINDING METALLIC
PARTICLES, SMALL METAL BALLS,
NAILS, SCREWS IN THESE WOUNDS?

THAT'S RIGHT.

WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THEY
ARE.

WHETHER THEY'RE BB'S OR METAL
BALL BEARINGS.

WE'RE ALSO FINDING NAILS AND
SCREWS AND OTHER PIECES OF
METAL.

THEY'RE TWISTED AND DEFORMED.

IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY'RE
FROM THE BOMB ITSELF OR THE
ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE BOMB.

BUT THE BOMB MAY HAVE HIT
OTHER METAL OBJECTS THAT THEN
SPLINTERED APART?

THIS IS WHAT I'M HEARING,
ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW
THAT FOR A FACT.

THE OPERATIONS THAT WE HAVE
PERFORMED ARE IDENTICAL TO THE
KIND OF WORK WE WOULD DO IN THE
ARMY AT A FORWARD SURGICAL TEAM
OR COMBAT SUPPORT HOSPITAL.

WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS
HEROISM, LARGE AND SMALL AT ALL
TIMES AT MASS GENERAL, AND WE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.

I KNOW YOU'VE GOT AT LEAST FIVE
SURGERIES TODAY.

OTHER CITIES IN AMERICA, AFTER
THE TRAGEDY IN BOSTON.

ALL AROUND THE WORLD TODAY
PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS WERE
SENDING MESSAGES OF SOLIDARITY
TO BOSTON.

AND IN THIS COUNTRY TOO, THERE
WAS NEW MEANING TO THE
INJUNCTION -- SEE SOMETHING, SAY
SOMETHING.

TONIGHT THE NEWEST MEMBER OF OUR
ABC NEWS FAMILY VETERAN REPORTER
ABC'S BYRON PITTS IS HERE TO
TELL US ABOUT THIS NEW NORMAL IN
AMERICAN CITIES TONIGHT.

NEW NORMAL.

THE MOMENT TERROR STRIKES AT
HOME, THE NATION COILS.

COAST TO COAST LAW ENFORCEMENT,
AT LOS ANGELES'S UNION STATION,
A MUSCULAR POLICE PRESENCE, AND
AND A MEASURE OF ANXIETY FELT
LIE COMMUTERS.

IT PUTS YOU ON EDGE.

WE'RE NOT SAFE ANYWHERE.

IT COULD HAPPEN ANYWHERE,
EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

BOSTON, MEMORIES OF 9/11.

THAT FAITH THAT YOU HAVE IN
SECURITY OF OUR NATION, IT'S
SEATTLE, STREETS WERE SHUT DOWN
DUE TO A SUSPICIOUS BACKPACK.

THE BOMB SQUAD SENT IN ITS
ROBOT, INSIDE A HAIR DRYER.

EAST COAST AIRPORTS HAD THE
JITTERS.

AT LOGAN AIRPORT, DELAYS OVER
SUSPICIOUS PASSENGERS AND
PACKAGES.

SUSPICIOUS ITEM AND PASSENGERS
FORCED TO WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE
STREET.

ACROSS NEW YORK CITY BOTH
SIGNS OF INCREASED SECURITY.

AND THE COMFORTING SOUND OF
RESILIENCY.

I THINK IF I BECOME NERVOUS
I'M GIVING IN TO SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME
UNDERPOWERED.

SEEMED TO SPEAK FOR MANY TODAY.

AS CITIZENS, WE HAVE TO BE
RESPONSIBLE ONE TO ANOTHER.

WE HAVE TO BE OUR BROTHER'S
KEEPER.

WE'RE STRONG PEOPLE AND WE'RE
NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE PUSH US
AROUND.

YOU MESS WITH ONE OF US, YOU
MESS WITH ALL OF US.

COUNTRY, PEOPLE SENT THEIR BEST
WISHES AND PRAYERS TO BOSTON.

WE'VE SEEN THIS IN AMERICA
BEFORE, WHEN A CRISIS HITS HOME,
THIS NATION WILL RALLY.
