DID HE ACT ALONE?

WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TONIGHT ABOUT
THE AMERICANONTRACTOR WHO
EXPOSED THE U.S. SPY PROGRAM MAY
HAVE HAD HELP.

NOW TO THIS COUNTRY THE
MANHUNT AND FALLOUT FROM A
FORMER NSA CONTRACTOR'S EXPOSURE
OF A GOVERNMENT SECRET
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM.

AFTER BRIEFLY COMING FORWARD
THIS WEEKEND TO ANNOUNCE HE WAS
THE SOURCE OF THE DAMAGING
ARTICLES IN THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER, EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS
APPARENTLY GONE UNDERGROUND,
LEAVING BEHIND HIM SOME
TROUBLING QUESTIONS.

THE GLOBAL MANHUNT FOR EDWARD
SNOWDEN CONTINUES.

WHILE THE FBI NOW FOCUSES ON HOW
HE DID WHAT HE CLAIMS TO HAVE
DONE, AND WHETHER HE HAD HELP.

CALLED ON THE CARPET, THE HEAD
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
SUMMONED TO THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEES TODAY TO EXPLAIN.

HOW BAD IS THE DAMAGE?

AND HOW DID A 29-YEAR-OLD
CONTRACTOR COPY SO MANY SECRET
DOCUMENTS?

AND THE GUARDIAN'S GLENN
GREENWALD SAYS MORE LEAKS ARE ON
THE WAY.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT
MORE SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS
THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN HEARD
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS AND
MONTHS.

LAM, HIS PICTURE PLASTERED ON
EVERY HONG KONG NEWSPAPER
REPORTS NBC'S IAN WILLIAMS.

STAFF HERE AT THE MIRA HOTEL
CONFIRMED THAT ONE EDWARD
SNOWDEN DID CHECK OUT MONDAY
LUNCHTIME.

HE'S NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE, BUT
IS BELIEVED TO BE STILL IN HONG
CONFIRMED THAT ACROBATIC DANCER
LINDSAY MILLS IS THE GIRLFRIEND
SNOWDEN LEFT BEHIND IN HAWAII.

IN HER BLOG SINCE TAKEN DOWN,
MILLS REFERS TO HIM AS KUO E",
AND TELLS FRIENDS SHE WAS IN A
STATE OF SHOCK OVER HIS SUDDEN
DEPARTURE.

SNOWDEN FIRST REACHED OUT
ANONYMOUSLY TO AWARD WINNING
FILMMAKER, LAURA POITRAS AFTER
SEEING HER FILM KUO THE PROGRAM"
ON A NEW YORK WEBSITE, SHE TOLD
SALON.COM.

THE FILM PROFILED A
DISILLUSIONED RETIRED NSA
ANALYST WILLIAM BENNING.

THE DANGERS HERE, ARE THAT WE
FALL INTO SOMETHING LIKE A
TOTALITARIAN STATE LIKE EAST
AND POITRAS FLEW TO HONG KONG TO
MEET THE SOURCE.

HE TOLD THEM TO LOOK FOR A MAN
IN THE HOTEL LOBBY CARRYING A
RUBIK'S CUBE.

THE CONNECTION WAS MADE.

THE FBI IS SEARCHING FOR SNOWDEN
AND HIS COMPUTER TRAIL.

TO BUILD A CASE AGAINST HIM.

EXPERTS ARE NOT SURPRISED HE HAD
SO MUCH ACCESS.

HE WAS AN I.T.

GUY, AND WHEN
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE I.T.

GUYS,
HAVE YOU A LOT MORE ACCESS TO A
LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF A
NETWORK, BECAUSE YOU'RE MANAGING
IT.

WIDEN FILED LEGISLATION TO
DECLASSIFY THE FISA PROGRAM, AND
DEMANDED ANSWERS FROM CHIEF
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER JAMES
CLAPPER FOR DENYING RECORDS WERE
COLLECTED.

IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE
CONGRESS TO DO THE KIND OF
VIGOROUS OVERSIGHT THAT THE
PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT, IF YOU
CAN'T GET STRAIGHT ANSWERS.

SNOWDEN'S LEAKS PROMPTED THE
ACLU TO FILE SUIT TODAY AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT, CLAIMING THAT
THE STORING OF ALL TELEPHONE
RECORDS VIOLATES THE RIGHT TO
PRIVACY.

AND GOOGLE HAS WRITTEN THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL, ASKING FOR
PERMISSION TO MAKE PUBLIC THE
NUMBER OF SECRET COURT ORDERS IT
HAS BEEN FORCED TO COMPLY WITH
FOR DATA, WHICH GOOGLE SAYS WILL
SHOW IT IS FAR LESS THAN THE
REPORTS HAVE CLAIMED.
