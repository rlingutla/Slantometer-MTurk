IN A MOMENT HERE, CHILDREN AMONG
THE DEATH AFTER REPORTS OF A
CHEMICAL ATTACK INSIDE SYRIA.

NOW THE WHITE HOUSE UNDER
GROWING PRESSURE TO DEAL WITH
THE RUSSIAN BACK'S DICTATOR,
AL-ASSAD AFTER THE
ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY'RE NOT
FOCUSED ON REMOVING HIM FROM
POWER.

SO WHAT NOW?

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING
TODAY'S APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK
IN SYRIA AGAINST CIVILIANS IS
REPREHENSIBLE AND CANNOT BE
IGNORED.

IT'S CALLING ACTIONS BY BASHAR
AL-ASSAD HEINOUS AND THAT IS A
SHIFT FROM WHAT TOP TRUMP
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING DAYS AGO.

ACTIVISTS CLAIM SYRIAN OR
RUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS DROPPED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A TOWN IN
NORTHERN SYRIA.

A HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SAID THE
ATTACKS KILLED 58 PEOPLE
INCLUDING 11 CHILDREN.

WE WANT TO WARN YOU, THE IMAGES
ARE DISTURBING AND YOU MAY WANT
TO THINK TWICE ABOUT SHARING
WITH YOUR KIDS.

WE'RE SHOWING THEM THOU BECAUSE
THEY CONVEY THE TRUE HORROR OF
THIS ATTACK AND THE VICTIMS IT
INVOLVES.

HEART-BREAKING PHOTOS POSTED ON
FACEBOOK.

SMALL CHILDREN IN DIAPERS AMONG
THE VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

MEDICS REPORTING THAT ROCKET
ATTACKS AND CLINICS TREATING THE
WOUNDED.

TODAY REPORTERS ASKED SEAN
SPICER IF THE UNITED STATES WILL
RESPOND.

SPICER IS SAYING OFF CAMERA THAT
HE WASN'T GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
THE PRESIDENT.

THIS COMING DAYS AFTER THE U.S.

AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI
HALEY SAID THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T INTERESTED
IN REMOVING AL-ASSAD FROM POWER
AND IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE
SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE
FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.

THIS IS THE THIRD CLAIM OF A
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN JUST OVER A
WEEK IN SYRIA.

THERE'S REPORTS OF PEOPLE
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, PEOPLE
UNRESPONSIVE.

YOU CAN SEE EMERGENCY WORKERS
DRESSED IN HAZMAT SUITS AS THEY
TAKE CHILDREN INTO THE HOSPITAL
FOR TREATMENT.

ONE DOCTOR SAID HE SAW PATIENTS
WITH PINPOINT PUPILS.

THESE ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS OF
TOXIC GAS EXPOSURES.

THEY THINK MORE THAN ONE GAS WAS
USED INCLUDING SARIN.

THIS HAPPENED IN AN AIR
CONTROLLED BY FORCES OPPOSED TO
THE ASSAD REGIME.

IT'S HOME TO 900,000 DISPLACED
SYRIANS.

THIS IS THE WORST TOXIC GAS
ATTACK ON A DAMASCUS SUBJECT
BOSCH.

AFTER THAT, PRESIDENT ASSAD
AGREED TO DESTROY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

1,300 TONS OF MATERIALS WERE
DESTROYED.

MANY COUNTRIES WORRY WHETHER HE
GAVE UP HIS MATERIALS.

QUESTIONING WHETHER IT'S TIME TO
TAKE ACTION AGAINST ASSAD.

TODAY A STATEMENT WAS
RELEASED SAYING "ASSAD BELIEVES
HE CAN COMMIT WAR CRIMES WITH
IMPUNITY.

THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE WILL
TAKE ACTION TO DISABUSE HIM OF
THIS MURDEROUS NOTION."

HE SAID THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE A DECISION ABOUT ASSAD'S
FATE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

AS YOU RECALL LAST WEEK, THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY
WEREN'T FOCUSED ON TAKING OUT
ASSAD ANYMORE.

TAKE A LISTEN.

THERE'S A POLITICAL REALITY
THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN TERMS
OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

WE LOST A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THE
LAST ADMINISTRATION WITH RESPECT
TO ASSAD.

NOW IT'S UP TO THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE.

WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE
NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW DEFEATING
ISIS.

WELL, TODAY PRESS SECRETARY
SEAN SPICER TOOK A DIFFERENT
TONE.

HE SAID THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A
LACK OF COMFORT WITH ASSAD.

VERY DIDN'T TONE THERE.

CHAPTER.

TRULY DISTURBING.

OUT OF SYRIA.

PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING A
STATEMENT OUT ON THE DEADLY
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.

BLAMING THE ASSAD REGIME FOR
WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLS HEINOUS
ACTIONS.

ACTIVISTS SAY SYRIAN OR RUSSIAN
FIGHTER JETS DROPPED CHEMICALS
ON A NORTHERN TOWN IN SYRIA.

THE ATTACK KILLED AT LEAST 58
AND 11 CHILDREN.

THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT READS
THE FOLLOWING "TODAY'S CHEMICAL
ATTACK IN SYRIA AGAINST INNOCENT
PEOPLE, INCLUDING WOMEN AND
CHILDREN, IS REPREHENSIBLE AND
CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
CIVILIZED WORLD.

THESE ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE
PAST ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WOULD
ESTABLISH A RED LINE AGAINST THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND DID
NOTHING.

THE UNITED STATES STANDS WITH
OUR ALLIES ACROSS THE GLOBE TO
CONDEMN THIS INTOLERABLE ATTACK.

THAT IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

SYRIA.

SECRETARY TILLERSON JUST PUT OUT
A STATEMENT.

WHAT DID IT SAY?

THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS
JUST RELEASED THE STATEMENT.

WHAT TILLERSON IS SAYING, HE'S
CALLING UPON RUSSIA AND IRAN TO
EXERCISE THEIR INFLUENCE OVER
THE SYRIAN REGIME IN
GUARANTEEING THAT THIS SORE OF
HORRIFIC ATTACK NEVER HAPPENS
AGAIN.

THE WHITE HOUSE SHORTLY BEFORE
THEN PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING
THAT IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION
OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO BLAME FOR
THIS FOR NOT ENFORCING THAT
INFAMOUS RED LINE IF THE SYRIAN
REGIME OF BARBER AL-ASSAD HAD
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST
HIS OWN PEOPLE, THIS IS A WEEK
AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE
SAID IT'S UP TO THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE TO DECIDE AL-ASSAD'S
FUTURE.
