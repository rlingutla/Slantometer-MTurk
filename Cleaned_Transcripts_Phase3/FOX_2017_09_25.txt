WILL GIVE YOU PUERTO RICO, WILL
AMERICANS NEED HELP AFTER A
TERRIBLE HURRICANE.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD, GAS AND
THE CLEANUP EFFORT THAT COULD BE
MEASURED IN MONTHS.

THERE'S CLEANUP AND RECOVERY IN
PUERTO RICO, AND IN TEXAS, AND
OF FLORIDA, AND A LONG, LONG
LIST COMING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

PUERTO RICO
IS HOME TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
AND CAN RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE
DEVASTATED.

THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GAS TO GO
AROUND.

PEOPLE THERE ARE GROWING MORE
DESPERATE BY THE HOUR.

WE WILL GO LIVE AND TALK TO
GERALDO RIVERA, WHO IS THERE,
BECAUSE HE HEADED TO THE ISLAND
TO HELP HIS FAMILY.

NORTH CAROLINA ARE TELLING
PEOPLE TO LEAVE SOME AREAS OF
THE OUTER BANKS AS HURRICANE
MARIA MOVES TOWARD THE AREA.

OFFICIALS HAD MANDATORY
EVACUATION SEVERAL ISLAND
STARTING TODAY.

HERE'S THE LATEST TRACK FOR YOU,
FORECASTERS SAY THEY DO NOT
EXPECT THAT CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE
UNITED STATES AT ALL.

IT WILL NOT MAKE LANDFALL THEY
TELL US, BUT THEY SAY IT WILL
CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE
UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST.

TELLING PEOPLE TO PREPARE FOR
STRONG WINDS, STORM SURGE, AND
SOME FLOODING.

THIS COMES DAYS AFTER THE STORM
SLAMMED PUERTO RICO, LEAVING
BEHIND DESTRUCTION AND I CANNOT
POWER IT TO EVERYBODY THERE.

OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH
STRONGER.

ONE LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY,
HURRICANE MARIA SAID BACK TO
UNITED STATES TERRITORY BY
DECADES, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT
ISLAND THAT IT WAS WEEK AGO.

IMAGES TO SHOW YOU IN A
SLIDESHOW THIS AFTERNOON,
CERTAINLY DIFFERENT ISLAND AND
IT WAS A WEEK AGO.

PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AND AT
SAN JUAN TO LINE UP TO BUY GAS.

REPORTS PEOPLE WAITED HOURS IN
SOME AREAS TO GET A LITTLE BIT.

HERE ARE KIDS FEELING JUGS WITH
FRESH WATER IN A DISTRIBUTION
POINT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER EAST
OF THERE.

EMERGENCY WORKERS DELIVERED MORE
THAN 1 MILLION AND A HALF
GALLONS OF WATER TO THE ISLAND.

THIS IS SAN JUAN.

A WI-FI HOT SPOT.

PEOPLE GETTING SERVICE.

CELL PHONES ARE TOUGH.

WATER FLOWS FROM THE DAM ON THE
NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND,
WHERE OFFICIALS TOLD THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.

CONCERNS OF THE DAM WOULD BREAK
AND CAUSE MORE FLOODING.

MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
OFFERING TO HELP THIS WOMAN
EVACUATE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT
OPENED THE GATES OF A DAM NEAR
HER HOME.

HE IS PUERTO REAGAN HIMSELF AND
HIS LIVE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON.

THE ISLAND GOT RACKED BY
HURRICANE IRMA TWO WEEKS AGO.

THAT HURRICANE ACT OF 17% OF THE
POWER GRID.

THEN CAME THE MUCH MORE SAVAGE,
POWERFUL HURRICANE MARIA, AND
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED
THIS ISLAND.

IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.

80% OF THE CROPS HAD BEEN
DESTROYED.

THERE IS NO ELECTRIC POWER SHEP,
THE POLLS ARE DOWN EVERYWHERE.

THE LARGE CONDUCTIVE POLLS, THE
TELEPHONE POLES, THERE'S VERY
LITTLE COMMUNICATION.

SO SERVICE, EXTREMELY SPOTTY.

THERE IS NO SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING ON AN ISLAND WITH NO
WATER AND NO FUEL THEN THE LINES
AT THE SERVICE STATIONS.

NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF
PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT
GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME
AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS
THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS
STATION IN PUERTO RICO.

WITHOUT GAS, THEY CAN'T RUN THE
GENERATORS THAT THE FEW HAVE TWO
POWER THE WATER PUMPS THAT ALLOW
THEM NOT ONLY TO GET WATER TO
BATHE AND DRINK, BUT ALSO TO RUN
THE TOILET.

THIS SITUATION IS AS DIRE AS YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN
THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION,
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET
WORSE.

THE MILLION AND A HALF GALLON
ALREADY DELIVERED, A DROP IN THE
BUCKET, IT IS NEEDED.

GERALDO, WITH INTEREST AND A LOT
OF LOVE THERE, ARE THEY GOING TO
NEED AN AIRLIFT OR BOLT LEFT
OUT OF THERE AND TO, OR CAN THEY
GET THIS BACK UP AND RUNNING TO
GET THIS FROM BEING A NECESSITY?

SHEP, THERE HAS BEEN AN
EXODUS FROM PUERTO RICO SINCE
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.

THIS U.S. COMMONWEALTH IS
BANKRUPT.

MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT
THE ISLAND.

I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE PEOPLE
FORCED TO LIVE UNDER THE
PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS, THE YOUNG
ONES WILL LEAVE.

WHAT HAPPENS, THE OLD AND FEEBLE
THEY STAY BEHIND, THEN YOU
CANNOT LEAVE.

SCHOOLS ARE CLOSER, BY THE WAY.

BUSINESSES INCREDIBLY DISRUPTED.

OF THE 3.4 MILLION, YOU'LL SEE A
TREMENDOUS EXODUS TO FLORIDA,
NEW YORK STATE, AND LESS THIS
POWER GRID IS RESTORED.

IT WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE BEFORE.

IT WAS PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION, BY
INCOMPETENCE, BY SCANDALOUS
DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE PURCHASING
FUEL OIL, PURCHASED THE LOW
WAS GREAT, IT SOLD FOR THE
HIGHEST.

NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.

TO BRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN
AND THEY ARE NOBLE PEOPLE, AND
ARE HELPING, BUT WITH THIS
ISLAND NEEDS IS AN ENTIRE NEW
POWER GRID.

3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A
MANY STATES IN THE UNION.

I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE
IS A.

OF SEVERE DISRUPTION.

THEY ARE SAYING THAT 4-6 MONTHS
BEFORE THEY GET THE POWER GRID
UP AND RUNNING SO PEOPLE WOULD
GENERATORS, THIS WILL BECOME A
SYMBOL OF WHAT THEY BECOME
TODAY.

WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE
BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF
THE HURRICANES.

THE TOURISM HERE ALSO SHREDDED.

THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.

IT IS BECAUSE -- EIGHT HUGE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL
JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE,
BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

PEOPLE ARE IN DIRE STRAITS.

THIS WILL BE A MARSHALL PLAN
SCALE REBUILDING OF THE
ELECTRICAL GRID BEFORE YOU CAN
HAVE THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS
WE KNOW IT IN PUERTO RICO.

ARMED GUARDS ON THE GASOLINE.

ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK INTO THIS
CRISIS.

IMAGINE A MONTH FROM NOW OR TWO
MONTHS FROM NOW.

KNOWING NO ONE HAD A HOT SHOWER,
NO ONE CAN FLUSH THE TOILET BUT
FOR THE COSTLY INCLUSION OF A
GALLON OF GAS IN THE COMMODE.

IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO BE
LIKE, SHEP.

THERE IS NO OVERSTATING THE
CRISIS HERE, THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD COME.

THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR
HIMSELF.

SEND MARCO RUBIO AND HEAD OF
FEMA, THEY ARE HERE TODAY.

THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE
CAME IN WITH THE PLANE.

ALL THOSE GESTURES ARE VERY
IMPORTANT, BUT YOU NEED IT
SYSTEMIC REFORM, WAY TO BAIL
THESE PEOPLE OUT.

IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.

MY FAMILY, GOD KNOWS I LOVE
THEM.

I LIVED IN THE VERY HOUSE WHEN I
WAS A TEENAGER.

THEY ARE HIGH-FUNCTIONING, THEIR
CHILDREN HAVE BECOME DOCTORS.

I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL
HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE
WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.

MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN
LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT
WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY,
A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA
MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.

SPILLED BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR
FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE OF
PUERTO RICO
