GLOBAL HACK.

THE BIGGEST CYBERATTACK EVER.

THE VIRUS CRIPPLING HOSPITALS
AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE GLOBE
AND HERE AT HOME.

THE HACKERS DEMANDING A RANSOM.

THE RACE TO STOP THE THREAT.

WE BEGIN WITH
THE CYBERATTACK ROLLING ACROSS
THE GLOBE.

TARGETING GOVERNMENTS, HOSPITALS
AND MAJOR COMPANIES.

SECURITY EXPERTS RACING TO FIGHT
BACK.

HACKERS STRIKING AROUND 100,
LOOK AT THAT, COUNTRIES
INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S.
LOCKING UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
COMPUTERS, DEMANDING RANSOM TO
FREE THEM UP.

TONIGHT THE COMPUTER WIZ WHO MAY
HAVE STUMBLED ON A WAY TO
DISABLE THE ATTACK AND THE
INTERNATIONAL HUNT TO CATCH THE
CULPRITS BEFORE THEY STRIKE
AGAIN.

VICTIMS TONIGHT INCLUDES FEDEX
AND THE UNITED STATES, RUSSIA
AND RAILROADS, GERMANY AND
FACTORIES AND PHONE COMPANIES
ACROSS EUROPE AND HOSPITALS IN
GREAT BRITAIN WHERE SURGERIES
WERE CANCELLED.

AMBULANCES TURNED AWAY AND LIVES
PUT AT RISK.

IT'S A HEINOUS CRIME.

THIS HACKING BECAUSE THEY'RE
CYBERATTACK TITLED WANT TO CRY
WAS ANNOUNCED WHEN TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF TARGETS
RECEIVED THIS
MESSAGE THAT THEIR COMPUTERS
WERE FROZEN.

OOPS, YOUR IMPORTANT FILES ARE
ENCRYPTED FOLLOWED BY TO PAY A
RANSOM OF $300 OR MORE TO KEEP
THEIR FILES FROM BEING ERASED
PERMANENTLY.

THE REASON THIS IS HITTING SO
MANY COMPUTERS AT ONCE IS THEY
DISCOVERED A VULNERABILITY IN
THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD IN MICROSOFT
WINDOWS AND THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

IT'S ONE THAT MICROSOFT
DELIVERED A SOLUTION FOR BUT A
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T USED IT.

SPREAD TO MORE THAN 100
COUNTRIES IN FIVE CONTINENTS THE
DAMAGE WAS
CONTAINED TODAY FOR THE MOMENT.

WHEN A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN
GREAT BRITAIN STUMBLED ON TO A
KILL SWITCH BASED ON THE WORK OF
THIS COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN
INDIANA WHO TALKED WITH US BY
SKYPE.

ONCE THE KILL SWITCH WAS
ACTIVATED, THE MALWARE WOULD DO
NOTHING.

IT WOULD NOT CARRY OUT ITS
INFECTION OR TAKE FOR RANSOM ALL
THE FILES ON THAT COMPUTER.

INTELLIGENCE AUTHORITIES AROUND
THE WORLD LED BY BRITAIN'S NEW
COMPUTER SECURITY SQUAD WHERE WE
WERE RECENTLY GIVEN RARE ACCESS
ARE WORKING TO TRACK DOWN
WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE.

WITH RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME
CONSIDERED A LEADING SUSPECT.

PEOPLE TRYING TO STEAL MONEY.

THE DIGITAL WORLD GIVES PEOPLE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

BELIEVE THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED
OUT WITH THE HELP OF A PROGRAM
FIRST DEVELOPED BY U.S.
INTELLIGENCE TO COMPROMISE THE
COMPUTERS OF TERRORISTS AND
FOREIGN ADVERSARIES.

THEY LOST IT.

SOMEBODY STOLE THE INFORMATION,
PUBLISHED IT ON THE INTERNET AND
NOW IS BEING USED AGAINST
VICTIMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND
ELSEWHERE.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD YOUR
REPORT ABOUT THE KILL SWITCH BUT
THE PROBLEM ISN'T OVER?

U.S. OFFICIALS BELIEVE AMERICAN
COMPANIES DODGED THE BULLET IN
THIS CASE BECAUSE MOST HAD
UPGRADED THEIR COMPUTERS TO
CLOSE THE VULNERABILITY AND THE
QUICK ACTIVATION OF THE KILL
SWITCH.

ALSO HELPED.

OFFICIALS SAY THEY BELIEVE THE
HACKERS ARE PREPARING A SECOND
WAVE OF ATTACKS WITHOUT A KILL
SWITCH THAT COULD COME ANY TIME
SOON TOM.

WHAT'S ADVICE FROM OUR
EXPERTS TO OUR VIEWERS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES?

THE MICROSOFT SYSTEM SHOULD
DOWNLOAD ANY UPGRADES INCLUDING
THE PATCH THAT COVERS THIS
VULNERABILITY.
