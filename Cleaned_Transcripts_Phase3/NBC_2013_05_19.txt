ON THIS SUNDAY NIGHT -- HIGH
ALERT.

SEVERE WEATHER BREAKING OUT
RIGHT NOW FROM THE PLAINS TO THE
GREAT LAKES.

WOW!

LOOK AT THE ROTATION!

DAMAGING WINDS, TORNADOES AND
FLOODING.

TONIGHT WHY CLOSE TO HALF THE
U.S. POPULATION COULD BE AT RISK
FROM DANGEROUS STORMS BEFORE IT
IS OVER.

AS WE START HERE TONIGHT,
DANGEROUS STORMS ARE BREAKING
OUT ACROSS A WIDE SWATH OF THE
COUNTRY FROM OKLAHOMA INTO
KANSAS, ON UP INTO MINNESOTA.

SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS AND
TORNADO WATCHES ARE UP IN AT
LEAST SIX STATES TONIGHT.

IN OKLAHOMA CITY, AN OMINOUS
WALL CLOUD APPEARED LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AS ALL EYES TURNED TO
THE THREATENING SKIES AMID A
FLURRY OF WARNINGS.

ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER
OF TORNADOES THAT HAVE TOUCHED
DOWN IN OKLAHOMA, INCLUDING THIS
ONE WE SAW A BIT EARLIER IN
EDMOND.

THIS HAS BEEN A TOPSY-TURVY
WEEKEND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
THE COUNTRY'S MIDSECTION AND
THIS DANGEROUS WEATHER SYSTEM IS
ON THE MOVE.

TONIGHT THE NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE SAYS 148 MILLION PEOPLE
ARE AT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER
FROM NOW INTO TUESDAY.

THAT'S HALF THE U.S. POPULATION.

WE WATCHED AS THIS ALL UNFOLDED
IN OKLAHOMA JUST MOMENTS AGO.

TAKE A LISTEN.

GO LEFT!

BIG-GUN TORNADO COMING DOWN!

WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

STAY ON THE STREET.

FOLKS, LOOK AT THAT.

THAT'S VIOLENT.

THAT'S VIOLENT.

VIOLENT TORNADO!

OFF TO THE RIGHT.

BIG-TIME DEBRIS CLOUD.

THERE IS LARGE STRUCTURAL
DEBRIS.

IT'S GOING TO BE HEADING
FOR --
 RIGHT IN FRONT OF US!

DOBBS ROAD.

IT'S VERY DANGEROUS!

BASEBALL-SIZED HAIL.

THAT IS APPROACHING DOBBS ROAD.

ONE MILE SOUTH OF WATERLOO ROAD.

YOU FOLKS IN RURAL AREAS UP
THERE, THIS IS A LIFE
THREATENING, DAMAGING TORNADO
HERE.

IT IS LARGE AND MULTI-VORTEX.

AS THEY REPORTED IN OKLAHOMA
A SHORT WHILE AGO, OUR TEAM IS
IN PLACE TO COVER IT ALL,
INCLUDING NBC'S JANET SHAMLIAN
IN OKLAHOMA CITY WHO SPENT SOME
TIME HERSELF TAKING SHELTER
TODAY.

THE POWER LINES ARE STILL DOWN
FROM LAST NIGHT'S STORM AND HERE
WE GO AGAIN.

CONDITIONS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE
VERY QUICKLY HERE.

JUST WITHIN THE LAST HOUR WE
HEARD THE TORNADO SIRENS
MULTIPLE TIMES.

AS YOU INDICATED, FOR THE WHILE
WE WERE IN THE BACK AFTER TARGET
STORE ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM WHERE
I AM STANDING WITH SEVERAL DOZEN
OTHER PEOPLE TAKING SHELTER.

THE PICTURES ARE VERY DRAMATIC,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED THIS
UNFOLD LIVE ON THE WEATHER
CHANNEL.

WE GOT A TORNADO, GUYS.

WE GOT A TORNADO?

GOT A TORNADO ON THE GROUND
RIGHT NOW, GUYS.

THERE IS SOME LARGE DEBRIS IN
THE AIR RIGHT HERE.

HERE HAD COMES.

HOLY SMOKES.

WHIPPING WINDS AN TORNADOES
PUMMELING THE CENTRAL PLAINS.

OH!

LIGHTNING BOLT.

THIS ONE WAS ON TOP OF THE
WEATHER CHANNEL'S TORNADO HUNT
TEAM.

WE ARE ALMOST RIGHT UNDER THE
TORNADO AT THIS POINT.

WE CAN HEAR THE ROAR.

IT IS RIGHT OVER US BUT WE CAN
STILL SEE IN CONTACT WITH THE
GROUND FARTHER OFF TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST.

TONIGHT, MORE THAN 30 MILLION
PEOPLE ARE IN THE PATH OF THE
STORMS.

IN OKLAHOMA CITY,
70-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS TOOK DOWN
BLOCK AFTER BLOCK OF POWER
LINES.

WE HAVE MORE STORMS COMING IN
TONIGHT.

THEY'RE GOING TO BE SEVERE SO WE
WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS UP AND
MAKE SURE IT IS IN PLACE BEFORE
ANOTHER STORM COMES THROUGH.

OF THE QUIETEST TORNADO SEASONS
ON RECORD DUE TO A COLD SPRING.

BUT THAT ENDED WITH LAST WEEK'S
ASSAULT ON TEXAS WHERE SIX
PEOPLE DIED IN GRANBURY NEAR FT.
WORTH.

WE HAVE ONE OF OUR STRONGER
UPPER AIR DISTURBANCES FROM THE
SPRING THAT'S COME IN FROM THE
PACIFIC NORTHWEST, PUSHED ITS
WAY SOUTHEAST AND NOW IT IS
GATHERING UP SOME OF THAT GULF
OF MEXICO MOISTURE.

WE HAVE WINDS FROM THE SOUTHEAST
THAT ARE MOIST AND WARM, WINDS
ALOFT FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

SO THE TURNING OF THOSE WINDS
ALLOWS THE STORMS TO DEVELOP
ROTATION.

WE CALL THEM SUPER CELL
THUNDERSTORMS AND THOSE ARE THE
ONES THAT PRODUCE LOTS OF
DANGEROUS TORNADOES.

SOME 22 TORNADOES SATURDAY.

19 IN KANSAS, THREE IN NEBRASKA.

ALL WITHIN TWO HOURS.

RESIDENTS ARE AWARE TONIGHT AND
MONDAY COULD BE EVEN WORSE.

I PROBABLY DRIVE BACK CLOSE
TO OKLAHOMA CITY AND JUST STAY
IN THAT UNDERGROUND PARKING
GARAGE FOR A WHILE.

I JUST DON'T TAKE CHANCES WITH
TORNADOES.

A TORNADO ALSO TOUCHED DOWN IN
WICHITA TONIGHT BUT NO REPORTS
OF INJURIES.

THERE IS A CLEARING NOW BUT
LESTER, WE'RE TOLD THE VERY
WORST OF THIS STORM COULD BE
STILL TO COME TONIGHT AND INTO
TOMORROW.

WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST
KELLY CASS IS TRACKING THE
STORMS.

KELLY, WHAT AREAS ARE ON ALERT?

WE STILL HAVE A HIGH TORNADO
THREAT AS WE GO LATE INTO THE
EVENING TONIGHT, ALL ACROSS THE
UPPER MIDWEST, STRETCHING ON
DOWN TOWARDS OKLAHOMA.

TAKE A LOOK AT THE TORNADO
WATCHES FROM GO FROM WISCONSIN
AS WELL AS THE TWIN CITIES, DOWN
INTO TULSA.

AND WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
SOME LARGE HAIL.

WE ALREADY HAD REPORTS OF
SOFTBALL-SIZED HAIL.

ACTIVE TORNADO WARNINGS.

WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THEM AROUND
THE OKLAHOMA CITY AREA,
STRETCHING ON UP INTO KANSAS,
WARNINGS GALORE.

WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT FLASH
FLOODING IN A LOT OF THE
SLOW-MOVING THUNDERSTORMS AS
WELL.

TONIGHT THE RED ZONE.

MINNEAPOLIS TO KANSAS CITY,
RIGHT ON DOWN TOWARDS TULSA AND
OKLAHOMA CITY.

TORNADOES ARE LIKELY.

THEY COULD BE LARGE AND
LONG-LIVED, THAT MEANS LASTING
FOR MILES ON THE GROUND.

AND THEN TOMORROW STILL MORE
SEVERE WEATHER FROM OKLAHOMA
CITY ON UP TOWARDS CHICAGO.

SO EVEN MORE PEOPLE WILL BE
INCLUDED IN THOSE WARNINGS.

BACK TO YOU.

IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG
NIGHT.

REMIND FOLKS THE WEATHER CHANNEL
IS COVERING THIS ONLINE AND ON
CABLE.
