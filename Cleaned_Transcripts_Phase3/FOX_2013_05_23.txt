INJURY POWERFUL SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS HAS SLOWED
THE RECOVERY NEXT AT 530
MOORE, OKLAHOMA AS LOVED
ONES BEGAN BURRING THE DEAD
FROM THE DEADLY TORNADO IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

FUNERAL FOR A 9-YEAR-OLD
GIRL.

SHE WAS AMONG SEVERAL
CHILDREN KILLED WHEN THE
TWISTER SLAMMED DIRECTLY
INTO PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

LEVELING NEARLY THE ENTIRE
PLACE.

PARENTS, STUDENTS AND
TEACHERS FROM PLAZA
ELEMENTARY TODAY REENUNITED
AT ANOTHER LOCAL SCHOOL.

MEMBER AMOTHER WHO WAS
THERE EXPLAINED HOW ONE OF
THOSE TEACHERS SAVED HER
DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

I AM NEVER GOING TO HAVE
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW ANY
WORDS TO, YOU KNOW TO
REPAY HER FOR WHAT SHE DID.

SHE, YOU KNOW, SHE THREW
HERSELF ON MY DAUGHTER TO
PROTECT HER AND I'M NEVER
GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO
REPAY HER.

"THE FOX REPORT'S"
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT
EARLIER GOT A FIRST
EXTENSIVE LOOK AT WHAT'S
LEFT INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

SHE IS LIVE ON THE SCHOOL
GROUNDS FOR US THIS
EVENING.

SHEP, IT IS A STUNNING
VISION OF UTTER DESTRUCTION
AND EVERYWHERE THERE ARE
POIGNANT REMINDERS THAT
THIS WAS A PLACE THAT
CHILDREN WENT TO BE SAFE
AND WENT TO LEARN.

WE SAW LAYING ON THE FLOOR
A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES.

WE SAW CHILDREN'S BOOKS
SCATTERED AMONG THE RUBBLE.

WE ALSO SAW SOME BOOKS
STILL UNTOUCHED, STANDING
ON A BOOK SHELF THAT WAS IN
CON CON GREWOUSLY UPRIGHT.

WE SAW SCHOOLWORK STILL ON
THEIR DESKS, TRAGICALLY, OF
COURSE SEVEN CHILDREN DIED
HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY MIRACULOUSLY
MANY MORE SURVIVED.

THIS SEVERE WEATHER
FRONT WALL OF THE SCHOOL
WAS.

THIS WAS WHERE THE FRONT
HALL OF THE SCHOOL WAS.

CLASSROOMS ON EACH SIDE.

THESE CLASSROOMS ARE NO
LONGER HERE.

THESE CLASSROOMS ARE.

THIS IS WHERE SOME STUDENTS
WERE SENT.

THIS IS A SAFE AREA IN THE
HALLWAY.

THERE WERE STUDENTS IN THE
HALLWAY THEY TAKE THEIR
CROUCHING DOWN POSITION.

THE KIDS IN THIS HALLWAY
ALL SURVIVED?

YES THE KITCHEN AREA
BACK THERE WHERE THE ROOF
IS CAVED IN THIS IS
ACTUALLY THE GYM AREA OVER
THERE THAT WAS 35-FOOT TALL
BUILDING THE GYMNASIUM.

THE ROOF BASICALLY
DEFINITELY AN AREA THAT WE
YOU KNOW, WANT TO AVOID AS
FAR AS THAT'S NOT A SAFE
AREA.

SOME OF THE  GÃ± KIDS WERE IN
THERE?

YES, SOME OF THE KIDS
THAT WERE OUT HERE WERE IN
A CLASSROOM IN THE FAR BACK
SIDE.

DID ANY OF THE KIDS DIE
IN THAT GYM?

THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT
SURVIVE HERE WERE ON THAT
SIDE OF THE SCHOOL.

SO THIS IS A FIRST
GRADERS IN THIS AREA
JEREMY.

FIRST GRADE AND
KINDERGARTEN IN THIS AREA.

THIS IS A HALLWAY WHERE
THEY TOOK SHELTER.

THIS IS, AGAIN, ONE OF
THE HALLWAYS.

YOU HAVE GOT THE LITTLE
FIRST GRADERS THAT COME OUT
AND LITERALLY TAUGHT TO GO
DOWN LIKE, THIS COVER THEIR
HEADS AND JUST CROUCH
AGAINST THE WALL?

CORRECT.

WE HAVE TORNADO DRILLS
REGULARLY IN OUR SCHOOLS.

THERE ARE CERTAIN SAFE
AREAS UNFORTUNATELY THIS
WAS A STORM AND WE HAVE HAD
ONE OTHER STORM LIKE THIS
THAT THE THE WEATHER MAN
EVEN ON THE TELEVISION WILL
SAY IF YOU ARE NOT
UNDERGROUND THERE IS A VERY
LIKELY CHANCE YOU WON'T
SURVIVE THIS STORM.

WE HE ONLY HAD 16 MINUTES.

THERE IS NO WAY TO EMPTY A
SCHOOL WITH ALMOST 500
PEOPLE IN IT OUT IN 16
MINUTES.

THINGS THAT THEY ARE
WORKING ON THAT DAY WHAT
THEY WANTED TO BE THEIR
FAVORITE THINGS FIVE THINGS
THEY LEARNED.

RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DAY WAS
OBVIOUSLY CHANGED A LOT.

LIVES CHANGED FOREVER.

SHEP?

AND MOORE.

WE RECEIVED NEW VIDEO OF
THE VIDEO OF WHAT BRIAR
WOOD ELEMENTARY LOOKS LIKE
TODAY.

ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF
AWAY FROM PLAZA TOWERS AND
ALSO IN THE TORNADO'S PATH.

JOHN ROBERTS TOURED WHAT'S
LEFT OF BRIAR WOOD
ELEMENTARY AND TOMORROW HE
WILL TELL US THE STORY OF
THE TEACHER WHO GOT HURT
WHILE SAVING THE STUDENTS'
LIVES.
