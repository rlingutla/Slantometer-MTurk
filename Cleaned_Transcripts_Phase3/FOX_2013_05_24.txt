NOW THEY SAY IT'S
REMARKABLE THAT EVERYBODY
AT BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY
SURVIVED.

PLUS, NOW WE KNOW THE STORY
BEHIND A PHOTO A PHOTO OF
A WOMAN CARRYING HER
DAUGHTER THROUGH A FIELD
LITTERED WITH DEBRIS.

WOULDYOU WILL HEAR FROM THE
MOTHER AHEAD AS FOX REPORTS

DAYS SINCE THAT TORNADO
RIPPED APART MOORE
OKLAHOMA WE HEARD A LOT
ABOUT THE SEVEN CHILDREN
WHO DIED INSIDE PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

YOU WILL REMEMBER THE STORM
DESTROYED NOT ONE BUT TWO
SCHOOLS THAT DAY.

JOHN ROBERTS IS LIVE IT THE
BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY.

THE BUILDING CRUMBLED
AROUND THE STUDENTS AND
THEIR TEACHERS.

JOHN?

SHEP GOOD EVENING TO
YOU.

THIS IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE
STREET FROM BRIAR WOOD
SCHOOL.

THIS USED TO BE ALL OF THE
HOMES WHERE THE STUDENTS
WHO WENT TO THAT SCHOOL
USED TO LIVE.

WE WILL TAKE YOU INSIDE
THAT SCHOOL WITH A MEMBER
OF THE URBAN SEARCH AND
RESCUE TEAM IN JUST A
SECOND AND SHOW WHAT YOU IT
LOOKS LIKE INSIDE.

FIRST OF ALL, THE STORY OF
A BRIAR ROAD ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL TEACHER AND THE
TERRIFYING ORDEAL THAT SHE
AND HER ENTIRE FAMILY WENT
THROUGH INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

AT BRIAR ELEMENTARY
TEACHERS SALVAGED WHAT
THINK COULD BEFORE THE
SCHOOL IS DEMOLISHED.

I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
WE WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.

COBB AND THREE CHILDREN
BARELY ESCAPED WITH THEIR
LIVES.

THEIR THOUGHTS ARE WITH
THOSE AT THE OTHER SCHOOL
HOMES WHERE ONE OF HER
STUDENTS DIDN'T MAKE IT.

I FEEL SO BAD FOR THOSE
FAMILIES CAFNTED EVEN
IMAGINE IF INSTEAD OF
HUGGING MY BABIES I WAS
PLANNING THEIR FUNERALS.

THIS IS SOME OF THE
CLASSROOMS.

THIS IT IS REMARKABLE
THAT THERE WEREN'T ANY
DEATHS AT BRIAR WOOD
ELEMENTARY SAYS THE FIREMAN
AS I TAKES ME THROUGH THE
SHATTERED SCHOOL.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
COULD YOU IMAGINE THIS CAME
APART THIS VIOLENT ACKENNED
NO ONE WAS KILLED?

I JUMPED OVER HERE.

POLICE OFFICER JOHN
BLEUM THAT WAS AMONG THE
FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE
SCENE.

WHEN THE LADY AT THE
FRONT WHEN I RAN THROUGH
SHE IS YELLING SECOND GRADE
IS TRAPPED.

SECOND GRADE IS TRAPPED.

I KEPT ON RUNNING.

A CLASSROOM NOW MORE
THAN RUBBLE HE FOUND TWO
TEACHERS AND 18 STUDENTS.

THE KIDS WERE BACK
UNDERNEATH THIS AROUND THE
CORNER HUNKERED DOWN, SOME
OF THEM LAYING DOWN FLAT
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

HE GOT THE STUDENTS OUT
BUT THEIR TEACHER SCREAMED
THAT SHE WAS STUCK.

I SAID I KNOW.

I'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT.

SHE SAID NO, I'M STUCK TO
THE TABLE.

THERE IS SOMETHING IN MY
LEG.

AND WHEN I LOOKED THERE WAS
A TABLE LEG THROUGH HER
RIGHT CALF.

SHE HAD BEEN IMPALED.

SHE HAD BEEN IMPALED,
YES.

SO IT TURNED OUT THAT
JOHN BLUMENTHAL HAD TO HAND
HER A POCKET KNIFE TO
UNSCREW THE LAST SCREW THAT
WAS HOLDING THAT LEG ON.

THEY PUT HER IN THE BACK OF
THE PICKUP TRUCK AND TOOK
HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

SHE IS OKAY.

YOU CAN SEE WITH LA DONNA
COBB THE LASTING EFFECTS OF
THAT WALL FALLING ON HER.

SHE HAS A BRUISED FACE
STAPLES IN THE BACK OF HER
HEAD SHE WILL GET OUT NEXT
PHOTO OF A MOM CARRYING HER
DAUGHTER THROUGH THE FIELD
NEAR THE PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

THAT PHOTO WAS ON THE FRONT
PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPERS
ACROSS THE NATION AND
AROUND THE WORLD.

AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE OR
WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM BUT
NOW WE DO.

THE MOM IS LATISHA GARCIA.

SHE SAID SHE'D HAD BEEN
RACING THE TORNADO TO GET
TO IT HER DAUGHTER JASMINE
A THIRD GRADER.

THE TORNADO MADE IT THERE
BEFORE MOM DID.

STARTED RUNNING TOWARDS
THE SCHOOL, I ASKED THE
TEACHER WHERE MY
DAUGHTER -- WHERE HER CLASS
WAS, AND SHE SAID THEY ARE
STILL TRYING TO PULL THEM
OUT AND RIGHT WHEN I RAN
UP TO ASK IF I COULD HELP
START PULLING PEOPLE OUT
TRY TO HELP SOME GUY JUST
HANDED HER TO ME.

SAYS SHE HAD BEEN BURIED
UNDER BRICKS AND OTHER
DEBRIS AT THAT SCHOOL.

SHE SAYS RESCUERS SAVED HER
AND THEN SOMEBODY HANDED
HER TO HER MOM WHO CARRIED
HER THROUGH THAT FIELD TO
SAFETY.

JASMINE SAYS SHE WASN'T
SURPRISED TO SEE THE MOM.

THE GIRL'S WORDS I KNOW SHE
IS ALWAYS THERE FOR ME.

THEIR HOUSE IS GONE BUT
TONIGHT BOTH MOM AND
DAUGHTER ARE OKAY.
