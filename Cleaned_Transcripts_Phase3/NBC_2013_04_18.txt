THE OTHER MAN IS WEARING A BLACK
BASEBALL CAP WITH WHITE BANDS ON
THE BILL AND A WHITE LETTER ON
THE FRONT.

HE'S WEARING A WHITE V-NECK
T-SHIRT, BEIGE PANTS, A BLACK
HOODED COAT.

HE'S CARRYING A DARK BACKPACK.

THIS VIDEO SHOWS THE MEN WALKING
TOGETHER TOWARD THE FINISH LINE.

THE FBI SAYS THE MAN IN THE
WHITE BASEBALL CAP FIRST
ATTRACTED THEIR ATTENTION
BECAUSE HE APPEARED TO BE
PLACING ONE OF THE BOMBS.

THE ONLY ONE OBSERVED TO BE
PLANTING WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE
DEVICE IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO
WITH THE WHITE CAP.

WHAT TIME DID THEY PUT THE
DEVICES DOWN?

I DON'T HAVE THE PRECISE TIME
IN FRONT OF ME.

IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE THE BOMB
THEIR ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED ON
THE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAT.

AS THEY ANALYZED MORE PICTURES
THEY REALIZED THE TWO SPENT TIME
TOGETHER.

THEY SAY THEY DID NOT SEE THE
OTHER MAN ACTUALLY PLANTING A
BOMB.

SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS
THESE INDIVIDUALS AS FRIENDS,
NEIGHBORS, CO-WORKERS OR FAMILY
MEMBERS OF THE SUSPECTS.

IT MAY BE DIFFICULT BUT THE
NATION IS COUNTING ON THOSE WITH
INFORMATION TO COME FORWARD AND
PROVIDE IT TO US.

THEMSELVES INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE
BOTH WERE LIKELY DETONATED BY
ELECTRONIC REMOTE CONTROLS.

FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN
CANVASSING HOBBY STORES IN THE
BOSTON AREA ASKING ABOUT RECENT
PURCHASES OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED
DEVICES.

THE FBI'S HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE
WILL SEARCH THEIR MEMORIES TO
SEE IF THEY CAN SHED LIGHT ON
WHAT'S NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION.

WHO ARE THESE TWO MEN?

SO, PETE, THE VIDEO AND
STILLS HAVE ONLY BEEN IN OUR
HANDS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR NOW.

LOOKING AT IT, WHAT CAN WE GLEAN
FROM PHYSICAL EVIDENCE, POSSIBLE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO
MEN?

I HAVE LOOKED AT THE WEB
TONIGHT.

THERE IS ALREADY A SLEW OF
THEORIES AS TO WHAT THE
ICONOGRAPHY IS ON BOTH HATS.

LEADING THEORY IS IT'S A
BRIDGESTONE GOLF LOGO ON THE
DARKER OF THE TWO.

WHAT CAN BE LEARNED?

BRIDGESTONE LOGO, THAT'S WHAT WE
ARE TOLD BY FEDERAL
INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE SEEN
THESE PICTURES FOR A WHILE BASED
ON THEIR OWN ANALYSIS.

ONE THING THE FBI SAID TONIGHT
IS THAT THIS IS IN ESSENCE A
STARTER SET OF PHOTOS.

THEY HOPE TO KEEP LOOKING
THROUGH THE PICTURES AND AS THEY
COME UP WITH PICTURES THAT SHOW
PERHAPS BETTER VIEWS AND BETTER
RESOLUTION, THEY WILL RELEASE
THOSE, TOO.

THIS ISN'T IT.

THEY HOPE TO HAVE MORE.

AFTER ALL THE TALK ABOUT ALL
THE GOOD DIGITAL IMAGES OF THE
FINISH LINE, THE VIDEO THAT'S
BEEN RELEASED IS SO FAR PRETTY
STANDARD SURVEILLANCE CAMERA,
BUILDING-MOUNTED.

HIGHEST QUALITY IN ONE SENSE AND
ALSO A BIRD'S EYE VIEW.

BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
THE GROUND, THEIR VISIBILITY IS
GOING TO BE LIMITED AS THE CROWD
IN FRONT OF THEM BLOCKS THEIR
VIEW.

SECONDLY, IT'S THE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA THAT GIVES THEM THE
STRATEGIC LOOK AT WHAT THESE MEN
WERE DOING.

IT'S MOTION VIDEO SO THEY CAN
WATCH THEIR MOVEMENTS.

ALL RIGHT.

NO DOUBT A BIG STEP FORWARD IN
THIS INVESTIGATION.

LESTER HOLT WAS ON THE STREET IN
BOSTON WHEN THE PHOTOS WENT
PUBLIC AT THAT VERY MOMENT.

HE WITNESSED THE START OF WHAT
SOMEONE TODAY CALLED THE FIRST
NATIONWIDE ELECTRONIC
CROWD-SOURCED MANHUNT OF THE
DIGITAL ERA.

WHEN THE CROWD WATCHING US
GLOMMED ONTO THE FACT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT PICTURES OF
SUSPECTS, THE SMARTPHONES
IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT.

PEOPLE STARTED WATCHING THAT
VIDEO.

ONE MAN SAID TO ME, I WISH I
KNEW THEM.

THE PRESIDENT WAS HERE JUST A
FEW HOURS BEFORE WE LEARNED OF
THE SUSPECT.

WHETHER HE KNEW ABOUT THEM OR
NOT IS UNCLEAR.

HE HAD A MESSAGE FOR WHOEVER DID
THIS.

WE WILL FIND YOU.

BOSTONIANS STOOD FOR HOURS IN A
LINE TEN BLOCKS LONG FOR A
CHANCE TO PUBLICALLY SHARE THEIR
SORROW AND EVEN THEIR FEARS.

I'M SICKENED BY THIS.

WE LIVE IN SUCH A FREE COUNTRY
AND TO HAVE A SENSE OF
INSECURITY.

APPLAUDED AND CHEERED, THE
PRESIDENT WIPED AWAY TEARS.

LATER, HE MET WITH RACE
VOLUNTEERS TO THANK THEM.

AS BOSTON TENDS TO ITS EMOTIONAL
WOUNDS, SIX PEOPLE INJURED IN
THE BOMBINGS REMAIN IN CRITICAL
CONDITION.

THE NUMBER STILL HOSPITALIZED,
FEWER THAN 60.

IN GENERAL, PATIENTS ARE
GETTING BETTER.

WE ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR
BEEFED-UP POLICE PRESENCE IN
BOSTON WAS RAMPED UP EVEN MORE
FOR TODAY'S PRESIDENTIAL VISIT.

A REMINDER THAT THIS ATTACK
REMAINS UNSOLVED.

FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA
TRAVELED WITH THE PRESIDENT
TODAY AND VISITED PATIENTS AND
STAFF AT SOME OF THE HOSPITALS
THAT TREATED THE WOUNDED.

WHEN WE COME BACK HERE
TONIGHT, THE AMAZING MOMENT FROM
LAST NIGHT IN BOSTON.

FINALLY HERE TONIGHT IN THE
WAKE OF THE MARATHON BOMBINGS,
BOSTON STRONG HAS EMERGED AS THE
PHRASE AND THE ICONOGRAPHY THAT
THE ENTIRE REGION HAS TAKEN ON.

IT WAS A TIGHT TOWN BEFORE THIS.

IT'S EVEN MORE SO NOW.

OUR OWN BAY STATE NATIVE ANNE
