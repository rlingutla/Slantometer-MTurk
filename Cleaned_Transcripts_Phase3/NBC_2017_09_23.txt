CONFUSION, CHAOS AND
FEAR IN PUERTO RICO,
AS A MAJOR DAM MAY BE
CLOSE TO BURSTING.

THOUSANDS TOLD SO
EVACUATE BEFORE WHAT
COULD BE AN EPIC
FLOOD.

GOOD EVENING,
RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF
U.S. CITIZENS ARE
CLINGING TO HOPE AS
THEIR ISLAND HOMES ARE
COPING WITH THE DEADLY
EFFECTS OF HURRICANE
MARIA.

IN PUERTO RICO,
COMMUNICATIONS ARE
VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT.

AS 3 MILLION PEOPLE
STRUGGLE WITH THE
BASICS OF SURVIVAL.

NO POWER, FOOD AND
WATER SHORTAGES THAT
THREATEN LIVES.

IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

THE MILITARY THREW A
LIFELINE.

AIRLIFTING AN AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER
TO START THE PROCESS
OF RECOVERY.

GABE GUTIERREZ BEGINS
OUR COVERAGE TONIGHT
FROM PUERTO RICO.

ALL THIS WATER.

MARIA DUMPED MORE THAN
15 INCHES OF RAIN ON
THIS AREA.

A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE
BEGAN TO EVACUATE.

TONIGHT THE ARMY CORPS
OF ENGINEERS IS
ASSESSING WHETHER THIS
DAM WILL HOLD UP.

THIS WOMAN WAS TOLD TO
LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

BUT THERE'S A
CRIPPLING CONFUSION OF
INFORMATION MUCH THE
GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO
REACH HALF OF THE
ISLAND'S
MUNICIPALITIES.

SAYING THE EVACUATION
ZONE AFFECTED UP TO
70,000 PEOPLE.

THE ACTUAL NUMBER WAS
MUCH LOWER, JUST
HUNDREDS IN CERTAIN
COMMUNITIES NEAR THE
DAM.

THIS IS WHAT WE DO
ALL DAY.

FAMILIES, THEIR ONLY
CONNECTION TO THE
OUTSIDE WORLD IS ONE
SPOTTY A.M. RADIO
STATION.

DAVID CASTRO TOLD US
HE AND HIS PARENTS
EVACUATED LAST NIGHT.

MY MOTHER WAS
TERRIFIED.

I WAS FRUSTRATED,
WE'RE GOING BACK AND
FORTH, WE HAD NOWHERE
TO GO.

SOON RETURNED WHEN
THEY HEARD NOTHING
ELSE FROM OFFICIALS.

THE UNCERTAINTY IS
CRUSHING.

SO IS THE SEEMINGLY
ENDLESS WAIT FOR FUEL.

THE LINES ARE NOT
ONLY HERE, IT'S
EVERYWHERE.

ROBERT MARTINEZ IS
DESPERATE TO CALL HIS
DAUGHTER WHO LIVES
NEAR PHILADELPHIA.

THEY HADN'T SPOKEN
SINCE THE STORM.

IT'S FRUSTRATING TO
COMMUNICATE WITH OUR
FAMILIES.

BACK HOME, THEY CAN'T
HEAR FROM US, THEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.

WE OFFERED HIM OUR
SATELLITE PHONE.

YOUR MOM AND I ARE
OKAY.

THE FOLKS IN THE AREA
ARE OKAY.

WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR
FROM OTHERS.

CLUSTER HOPING,
PRAYING FOR ONE MEASLY
BAR OF CELL SERVICE.

NEVER HAS THIS ISLAND
FELT SO DISCONNECTED.

NEVER HAS IT FELT SO
ALONE.

I'M HANS NICHOLS
ON BOARD A MILITARY
PLANE FLYING RELIEF TO
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

THE CREW HAS BEEN ON
HIGH ALERT.

WE HAVE A TIGHT
STRING.

WHEN WE GET THE CALL,
WE HAVE THREE HOURS TO
GET OFF.

THOMAS WAS DEVASTATED
BY HURRICANE IRMA, AND
HIT AGAIN BY MARIA.

IN THE COCKPIT, THE
FOCUS IS ON THE
MISSION.

GET IN, OFFLOAD.

ON THE GROUND,
MASTERS ARE AT WORK.

SPEED A PREMIUM.

WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN, AS
FAST AS WE CAN, AS
FAST AS WE'RE ALLOWED.

WE'VE LANDED HERE
IN SAINT THOMAS WHERE
THE AIRFIELD IS MOSTLY
CLEAR OF DEBRIS,
THEY'RE BRINGING IN AN
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
MOBIL COMMAND TOWER.

THE IDEA IS TO USE
THIS AIRFIELD AS A
STAGING GROUND FOR THE
BROADER RELIEF EFFORT.

THIS PLANE IS GOING TO
TAKE OFF NOW, HEAD
OVER TO TEXAS, PICK UP
PALLETS OF WATER AND
COME BACK.
