SHOWDOWN WITH RUSSIA.

THE CRITICAL TEST FOR THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.

RUSSIA FURIOUS WITH THE U.S.
STRIKE ON SYRIA.

ACCUSATIONS THAT AMERICA CROSSED
RED LINES, AS OUR SECRETARY OF
STATE HEADS TO MOSCOW.

NEXT TONIGHT, THE WHITE
HOUSE FACING A HIGH-STAKES
GLOBAL QUESTION.

PRESIDENT TRUMP RETURNING TO THE
WHITE HOUSE FROM MAR-A-LAGO, HIS
SYRIA AIR STRIKES FRONT AND
CENTER IN THE FOREIGN POLICY
DEBATE.

INFURIATING RUSSIA AS THE
SECRETARY OF STATE PREPARES TO
TRAVEL THERE.

DAVID WRIGHT WITH THE SIMMERING
NEW TENSIONS, AND THE
THREATENING STATEMENT TONIGHT.

FIGHTER-BOMBERS TAKING OFF FROM
THE SAME AIR BASE STRUCK BY U.S.
MISSILES.

AND RUSSIA NOW
TODAY, AN OMINOUS WARNING FROM
MILITARY COMMANDERS DEFENDING
THE ASSAD REGIME, ECHOING THE
PRESIDENT'S OWN LANGUAGE.

"THE UNITED STATES CROSSED RED
LINES BY ATTACKING SYRIA," READS
THE JOINT STATEMENT FROM RUSSIA,
IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH.

THE COMMANDERS THREATEN TO
RETALIATE AGAINST ANY FUTURE
U.S. MILITARY ACTIONS.

ADDING, "RUSSIA AND IRAN WILL
NOT ALLOW THE UNITED STATES TO
BE THE ONLY SUPERPOWER IN THE
WORLD."

THAT WARNING COMES EVEN AS U.S.
OFFICIALS WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT
THE ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO
ACCOMPLISH IN SYRIA.

TODAY, U.N. AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY SUGGESTED REGIME
CHANGE MAY NOW BE THE GOAL.

WE DON'T SEE A PEACEFUL SYRIA
HIS WEEKLY ADDRESS, WAS A BIT
MORE VAGUE.

OUR DECISIONS WILL BE GUIDED
BY OUR VALUES AND OUR GOALS AND
WE WILL REJECT THE PATH OF
INFLEXIBLE IDEOLOGY THAT TOO
OFTEN LEADS TO UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES.

HOPED FOR CLOSER COOPERATION
WITH MOSCOW.

IF WE HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA,
BELIEVE ME, THAT'S A GOOD THING,
IN SYRIA HAVE PUSHED THE TWO
NATIONS EVEN FARTHER APART.

THIS WEEK, SECRETARY OF STATE
REX TILLERSON HEADS TO MOSCOW
HOPING TO MEND FENCES.

BUT BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY
BORIS JOHNSON CANCELLED HIS
PLANNED TRIP, AT THE U.S.'
REQUEST.

THAT PROMPTED THIS WITHERING
POST ON THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY'S FACEBOOK PAGE.

UNDER AN UNFLATTERING PICTURE OF
JOHNSON, THE RUSSIANS ACCUSE
BRITAIN OF "FUNDAMENTAL
INCOMPREHENSION OR IGNORANCE OF
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SYRIA, OF
RUSSIA'S EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THAT
CRISIS, AND OF THE POINT OF
DIPLOMACY IN GENERAL."

THE TENSION RISING.

DAVID, THERE HAS BEEN TOUGH TALK
ON BOTH SIDES.

BUT VLADIMIR PUTIN AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAVE YET TO CRITICIZE EACH
OTHER.

MUCH MORE MEASURED WITH THEIR
WORDS.

IT'S A DELICATE DANCE AT THIS
POINT.

IT'S WORTH NOTING, THE KREMLIN
HAS CLEAR GOALS WHEN IT COMES TO
SYRIA.

THEY WANT ASSAD TO REMAIN IN
POWER.

THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT SO CLEAR ON
THE ISSUE.

IT'S A DIPLOMATIC CHALLENGE FOR
SECRETARY TILLERSON AS HE HEADS
TO MOSCOW.
