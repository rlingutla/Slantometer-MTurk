PRESIDENT TRUMP AND POSSIBLE
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.

THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYING,
"SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN" AFTER
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.

THIS EVENING, THE PRESIDENT AND
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT NOW
WEIGHING OPTIONS AFTER TRUMP
REPEATEDLY SAID BEFORE THAT THE
U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED IN
SYRIA.

AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS ON
SYRIA.

JUST 24 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID HIS MIND HAD BEEN
CHANGED ON SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL
ASSAD.

TODAY HE SIGNALED HE'S WEIGHING
MILITARY ACTION.

SAYING IN HIS WORDS, SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

IT COMES AFTER THE IMAGES OF
THAT HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK.

DOZENS KILLED BY WHAT TURKISH
OFFICIALS NOW SAY WAS SARIN GAS.

CHILDREN AND BABIES AMONG THE
VICTIMS.

THE SURVIVORS SPRAYED DOWN.

MANY OF THE VICTIMS STRUGGLING
TO BREATHE.

TONIGHT, WE KNOW THAT THE
DEFENSE SECRETARY IS NOW
BRIEFING THE PRESIDENT ON THE
OPTIONS.

WHAT ARE THEY?

AND HOW SOON COULD THIS COME?

TRUMP, WITH HIS STRONGEST WORDS
YET ON THE CRISIS IN SYRIA.

AS THIS PRESIDENT, NOW 77 DAYS
INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, DECIDES
WHETHER TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION.

I THINK WHAT ASSAD DID IS
TERRIBLE.

I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA
IS ONE OF THE TRULY EGREGIOUS
CRIMES.

AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
HAPPEN.

HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED?

AT SOME POINT I MAY.

I HAVEN'T, BUT AT SOME POINT I
MAY.

DO YOU THINK THAT ASSAD
SHOULD LEAVE POWER IN SYRIA?

I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN
SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

AND HE'S THERE AND I GUESS HE'S
RUNNING THINGS, SO SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

SECRETARY OF STATE, REX
TILLERSON, A MAN OF FEW WORDS
SINCE TAKING OFFICE, TONIGHT
WITH HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL YET,
FOCUSING ON SYRIA'S PRESIDENT.

SIR, DOES ASSAD HAVE TO GO?

ASSAD'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE IS
UNCERTAIN CLEARLY, AND WITH THE
ACTS HE HAS TAKEN, IT WOULD SEEM
THERE IS NO ROLE FOR HIM TO
GOVERN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.

WILL YOU AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL
COALITION TO REMOVE ASSAD?

THOSE STEPS ARE UNDER WAY.

WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
SUGGESTED SOMETHING FAR
DIFFERENT, SAYING THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO
GET RID OF ASSAD.

THIS SHIFT COMES JUST 24 HOURS
AFTER THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE
WORLD WATCHING, SAID THOSE
IMAGES OF CHILDREN GASSED HAD
CHANGED HIS MIND.

I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
HAPPENED THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD
SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY
MUCH.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,
BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE TELLING YOU.

PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP HAD LONG
ARGUED AGAINST ACTION IN SYRIA,
REPEATEDLY TWEETING ABOUT IT.

BACK IN 2013, AFTER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK, WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA WAS WEIGHING MILITARY
ACTION, TRUMP TWEETING, "DO NOT
ATTACK SYRIA.

IF YOU DO, MANY BAD THINGS WILL
HAPPEN.

AND FROM THAT FIGHT, THE U.S.
GETS NOTHING!"

TONIGHT, HE IS SIGNALING HIS
STANCE HAS CHANGED.

AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN
SUPPORTING SYRIAN LEADER BASHAR
AL ASSAD, SAID TODAY SUPPORT FOR
ASSAD NOT UNCONDITIONAL, BUT
URGING CAUTION.

ON CAPITOL HILL, A LEADING
REPUBLICAN SAID THIS IS A TEST
FOR TRUMP.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO MAKE A
DECISION THAT'S GOING TO DEFINE
HIS PRESIDENCY ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER.

IF HE DOES NOTHING, THEN IT'S
GOING TO BE OBAMA ON STEROIDS.

HASN'T SAID WHAT HE WOULD DO IN
SYRIA, BUT THERE ARE MANY
MILITARY OPTIONS.

HIT SYRIAN AIRFIELDS TO GROUND
ASSAD'S AIR FORCE.

GO AFTER MILITARY TARGETS SUCH
AS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.

WHAT COULD WE USE?

SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILES OR
U.S.-MANNED AIRCRAFT.

RISKIER BUT WE HAVE HIGHLY
SOPHISTICATED WARPLANES.

AND MARTHA JOINS ME NOW.

MARTHA WE KNOW
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEFENSE
SECRETARY ARE NOW TOGETHER.

HE'S BEING BRIEFED ON THE
POTENTIAL OPTIONS.

WE LEARNED THAT THE AIRCRAFT
THAT DROPPED THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WAS IN FACT A SYRIAN
MILITARY AIRCRAFT.

THEY SAY THERE'S NO QUESTION
IT WAS A SYRIAN MILITARY
AIRCRAFT.

WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE EQUIPMENT
THERE OVER SYRIA NOW THEY COULD
ACTUALLY WATCH, GO BACK AND SEE
WHAT KIND OF AIRCRAFT DROPPED
THOSE MUNITIONS.

WE HAVE MORE EQUIPMENT THERE.

MARTHA, AS YOU BEEN REPORTING WE
HAVE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS THERE
IN RECENT WEEKS, WE LEARNED OF
HUNDREDS BEING SENT INTO SYRIA.

WE DO, DAVID, AND THAT'S A
REAL CONCERN.

IF MILITARY ACTION IS TAKEN
THERE WILL BE A WARNING TO
ASSAD -- DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR
THOSE AMERICAN TROOPS, DO NOT
TARGET THEM, BUT THERE'S A RISK.

AND AS YOU HEARD MARTHA
REPORT, ANY ACTION IF TAKEN
COMES WITH GREAT RISK.

OBAMA WEIGHED MILITARY ACTION
BEFORE.

NOW, RUSSIANS ARE INVOLVED AND
AMERICAN TROOPS ARE THERE.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE TARGET?

AND WHAT ARE THE GREATEST RISKS?

MILITARY TONIGHT, AMONG THE
OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED ARE THE
VERY PLANS THE PENTAGON PLANNED
FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN A PRIME
TARGET WAS THE SPECIFIC MILITARY
UNIT THAT GUARDED AND DEPLOYED
SYRIA'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

UNIT 450, OF THE SYRIAN AIR
FORCE.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO STRIKE IN
A WAY THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED
TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE, YOU'D
HAVE TO HIT SOME PART OF UNIT
450.

THIS WEEK FROM SYRIA PUT A LIE
TO THE SYRIAN AND USA CLAIMS
THAT THE COUNTRY'S STOCKPILE OF
SARIN GAS AND OTHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

BUT EVEN WITH A DIMINISHED
SUPPLY, A DIRECT STRIKE ON
WHATEVER CHEMICAL WEAPONS REMAIN
STILL RUNS A SERIOUS RISK.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIT THEM,
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO BLOW
THEM UP, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GOING
TO CREATE AGENT PLUMES, WHICH
ARE GOING TO DAMAGE, YOU KNOW,
CIVILIAN AREAS.

PLAN IN 2013 INCLUDED SYRIAN
AIRFIELDS, TANK DEPOTS AND EVEN
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN
DOWNTOWN DAMASCUS.

THEY CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH A
TEN-FOOT BLOCK OF THAT BUILDING,
SO RIGHT INTO A PARTICULAR
OFFICE.

COULD BE LESS SWEEPING BECAUSE
OF THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN
SOLDIERS AND ADVISERS ACROSS
SYRIAN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

ALONG WITH ADVANCED RUSSIAN
ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

BRIAN, WE SHOULD CAUTION, WE
DON'T KNOW ANY ACTION IF ANY AT
ALL IS GOING TO BE TAKEN
TONIGHT.

BUT WE HEARD THOSE WORDS JUST 24
HOURS AGO FROM THE U.S.

AMBASSADOR, NIKKI HALEY ASKING
HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE TO
DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?

THOSE WERE STRONG WORDS.

AIMED AT RUSSIA, VLADIMIR PUTIN.

WE HAVEN'T HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP
ADDRESS PUTIN IN THAT WAY.

IS THAT A TEST OF THAT
RELATIONSHIP TOO?

IN FACT, THE WORLD IS
WATCHING TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT
IS NOW PREPARED TO CHALLENGE
RUSSIA AND ITS LEADER WHO HE HAS
PRAISED SO MUCH, VLADIMIR PUTIN.
