NEW CLUES IN THE WORLDWIDE HACK
ATTACK POINTING TO NORTH KOREA.

COULD THE ROGUE NATION HAVE THE
POWER TO CRIPPLE COMPUTERS
AROUND THE GLOBE?

AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
HELD HOSTAGE.

CYBER CRIMINALS SAY THEY STOLE A
COPY OF THE BLOCKBUSTER BEFORE
ITS RELEASE AND DEMANDING DISNEY
PAY UP OR ELSE.

A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN NORTH
KOREA AND THE MASSIVE GLOBAL
CYBER ATTACK.

WHAT RESEARCHERS SAY THEY FOUND
AS WE APPROACH THE BOTTOM OF THE
HOUR AND THE TOP OF THE NEWS.

CYBER ATTACK THAT HIT HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS IN 150
COUNTRIES LAST WEEK MAY BE
CONNECTED TO NORTH KOREA.

THE ATTACK AFFECTED A LIMIT
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES.

BRITAIN'S HOSPITAL NETWORK AND
GERMANY'S RAILWAY HIT.

THOSE SAY THE CYBER ATTACK
COMPUTER FILES AND HEAD THEM
RANSOM.

RUSHERS SAY THE WANNA CRY
SOFTWARE CONTAINED CODE USED IN
OTHER HACK ATTACKS LINKED TO THE
NORTH KOREANS.

THAT INCLUDES THE CYBER ATTACK
TO SONY IN 2014.

RESEARCHERS SAY THE DISCOVERY
DOES NOT CONFIRM NORTH KOREA'S
CYBER ATTACK.

IT'S POSSIBLE THE ATTACKERS
COPIED THE CODE.

THIS COMES DAYS AFTER NORTH
KOREA TESTED A MISSILE.

KIM JONG-UN SAYS THE WEAPON IS
ABLE TO HIT THE UNITED STATES
MAINLAND.

GREG PALKOT HAS MORE.

GREG?

SHEP, IT'S ALL BEING CALLED
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

BUT IT'S LOOKING STRONG.

THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR FOUR
DAYS.

300,000 TARGETS WORLDWIDE.

AND NOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF
THIS HACKING ATTACK SAID TO BE
$4 BILLION.

NOW, SECURITY FIRMS HERE AND IN
EUROPE AS WELL AS THE U.S. AND
TODAY IN SOUTH KOREA ARE MAKING
THIS NORTH KOREAN LINK.

WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT KIM
JONG-UN'S REGIME HAD A WHOLE
ARMY OF CROOKS TALKING IN A
VARIETY OF WAYS, A VARIETY OF
TARGETS.

NOW AS YOU HINTED AT, THE
PROGRAM CODE FOUND IN THIS
LATEST MALWARE, RANSOMWARE
ATTACK, IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO
OTHER ATTACKS.

THERE WAS A 2014 ATTACK ON SONY
PICTURES.

BUT THERE'S OTHER ATTACKS MOSTLY
IN ASIA AND SEEM TO THINK THE
RANSOM GAINED IN THE ATTACKS,
$100,000 SO FAR.

BUT THE DISRUPTION IS MAXIMUM.

IN THE U.S., THEY MADE OUT
PRETTY WELL.

EUROPE WAS HIT HARD.

INTERESTINGLY, CHINA HIT VERY
HARD.

30,000 INSTITUTIONS WERE
TARGETED.

EVERYTHING FROM UNIVERSITIES TO
GAS STATIONS.

WE DID HEAR TODAY BEIJING
OFFICIALS SAYING LISTEN, THIS
HAS TO END HINTING THAT NORTH
KOREA HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IT.

AGAIN, THE INVESTIGATION NOT
COMPLETELY SURE THAT NORTH KOREA
IS INVOLVED.

THAT'S WHY EUROPOL AND OTHER
INVESTIGATIVE BODIES ARE WORKING
HARD AS WELL AS THE BLAME GAME.

MICROSOFT HAD ITS
VULNERABILITIES IN THE SOFT WAY.

THEY FOUND WAYS TO COUNTER ACT
THAT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

AND THEN THERE'S THE HACKERS AND
THEN THE USERS LIKE YOU AND ME
THAT SHOULD PUT UP MORE
DEFENSES.

THIS IS NOT THE END OF THIS.

AND LET'S GO TO OUR COUNTSER
TERRORISM EXPERT.

WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS?T'S I
KOREA IS THE CULPRIT, THIS IS A
COUNTRY RUN BY A CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE THAT ALSO HAS AN
ARMY.

IS THIS A WAY TO GENERATE
REVENUE TO GENERATE BILLIONS IN
RANSOM OR IS IT A SHOT ACROSS
THE BOW?

SHOWS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS OR
WHOEVER IS DOING THIS CAN AFFECT
HUNDREDS OF COUNTRIES AND MAYBE
IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S A
SHOOTING WAR THAT HAPPENS ON THE
KOREAN PENINSULA, THEY CAN DO
MORE DAMAGE.

IS IT A MONEY-MAKING ENTERPRISE
OR MORE?

IT'S IN THE EARLY DAYS AND CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

THAT SOMEONE MIGHT DRAW THE
CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE NORTH
KOREANS?

WE KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE
WHATEVER THEY DO LOOK LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE DID IT?

WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS
ATTRIBUTION.

WE SAW, WE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,
BUT COMPANIES LIKE SAMANTAC AND
SOME LABS IN RUSSIA, THEY SAW
BITS AND PIECES OF THIS ATTACK
THAT WAS USED IN PREVIOUS
ATTACKS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS
HAD A HAND IN.

YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SONY
PICTURES DEBACLE.

WE THINK THE NORTH KOREANS WERE
INVOLVED IN THE BANGLADESH
SENTRA BANK ATTACK AND ANOTHER
POLAND BANK ATTACK.

SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, YOU
SEE THE SAME FINGERPRINT,
USUALLY LEADS YOU TO THE SAME
CONCLUSION.

PEOPLE CAN FAKE DATA AND CHANGE
THINGS AROUND AROUND MAKE THINGS
LOOK LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.

BUT ENOUGH DATA POINTS SUGGEST
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAD SOME
HAND IN THIS.

THIS IN A PHYSICAL WAY, IN OTHER
WORDS, USING HUMANS, GOING TO
THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO DO
WHAT THEY'RE ALLEGED TO HAVE
DONE IN A CYBER WAY, THAT MIGHT
BE CONSIDERED AN ACT OF PRETTY
EXTREME AGGRESSION.

SOME MIGHT TREND TOWARDS AN ACT
OF WAR.

WHY IS THIS NOT?

WELL, BECAUSE CYBER IS A
STRANGE THING.

EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD THE
INTERNET FOR SEVERAL DECADES
NOW, WE DON'T THINK OF IT IN WAR
CONCEPT.

WE TALK NORTH KOREA AND THEIR
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS, THE
MISSILE CAPABILITIES.

WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEIR
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
ALL AIMED AT SOUTH KOREA.

THE THING ABOUT CYBER IS,
THERE'S NO DISTANT ISSUE HERE.

IF YOU FIRE A MISSILE, YOU HAVE
TO MAKE TO IT JAPAN OR SOUTH
KOREA.

ON CYBER, THEY'RE INSIDE THE
GATE.

DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HERE IN
THE UNITED STATES OR DOING
THINGS ELSEWHERE.

YOU ARE HERE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
