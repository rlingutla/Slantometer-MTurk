THIS SUNDAY NIGHT --
NATIONAL SECURITY.

BUT AT WHAT PRICE?

THE FIRESTORM OVER THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION'S
COUNTERTERRORISM PROGRAM.

NOW IN AN NBC NEWS EXCLUSIVE, A
VIGOROUS DEFENSE FROM THE
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE.

WATCHING AND WAITING.

THE APPARENT SOURCE WHO EXPOSED
THE GOVERNMENT'S TOP-SECRET
COLLECTION OF PHONE RECORDS HAS
REVEALED HIMSELF.

SO SAYS THE PUBLICATION THAT
BROKE THE STORY LAST WEEK.

"THE GUARDIAN" PULLED THE COVERS
OFF AN ONGOING U.S. INTELLIGENCE
PROGRAM THAT'S QUIETLY COLLECTED
THE PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS IN THE NAME OF
NATIONAL SECURITY.

TONIGHT THE SELF-IDENTIFIED
SOURCE OF THAT STORY HAS STEPPED
FORWARD TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF.

WHILE THE U.S. DIRECTOR OF
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN AN
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NBC
NEWS IS DISPUTING SOME OF HIS
CLAIMS.

CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
CORRESPONDENT ANDREA MITCHELL
SPOKE TO JAMES CLAPPER AND JOINS
US FROM OUR WASHINGTON NEWSROOM.

TONIGHT "THE GUARDIAN" POSTED
THE INTERVIEW WITH THE
INTELLIGENCE CONTRACTOR WHO
WANTS TO GO PUBLIC, TO THAT
NEWSPAPER AS WELL AS "THE
WASHINGTON POST".

MY NAME IS ED SNOWDEN.

I'M 29 YEARS OLD.

I WORK FOR BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON
AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYST FOR
NSA IN HAWAII.

TOP-SECRET DOCUMENTS, PACKED HIS
BAGS AND WENT TO HONG KONG TO
SHARE WITH THE GUARDIAN'S GLEN
GREENWALD.

I CERTAINLY SITTING AT MY
DESK HAD THE AUTHORITY TO
WIRETAP ANYONE FROM YOU, YOUR
ACCOUNTANT, TO A FEDERAL JUDGE,
OR EVEN THE PRESIDENT IF I HAD A
PERSONAL E-MAIL.

CONTRADICTED BY WHAT THE
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE TOLD US EXCLUSIVELY
ON SATURDAY.

WE ARE UNDER STRICT COURT
SUPERVISION.

THE NOTION THAT WE'RE TROLLING
THROUGH EVERYONE'S E-MAILS AND
VOYEURISTICALLY READING THEM OR
LISTENING TO EVERYONE'S PHONE
CALLS IS, ON ITS FACE, ABSURD.

WE COULDN'T DO IT EVEN IF WE
WANTED TO.

I ASSURE YOU, WE DON'T WANT TO.

SNOWDEN SAYS HE BECAME
DISENCHANTED WHILE WORKING FOR
THE CIA AND LATER GOT HARDENED
WHILE AT THE NSA.

I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO SITS
THERE DAY TO DAY IN THE OFFICE
WATCHES WHAT'S HAPPENING AND
GOES, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S
NOT OUR PLACE TO DECIDE.

THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO DECIDE
WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS AND
POLICIES ARE RIGHT OR WRONG.

SNOWLEN USE THE WORLD'S MOST
SOPHISTICATED COMPUTERS TO SIFT
THROUGH A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA.

EVEN MORE WILL BE STORED IN THIS
NEW FACILITY IN UTAH, ALL LEGAL
SINCE 2008, RE-AUTHORIZED BY
CONGRESS IN 2012 AND REVIEWED
EVERY THREE MONTHS BY A SECRET
COURT.

CRITICS SAID TODAY MORE
OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED.

THE FACT THAT EVERY CALL I
MAKE TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY IS
NOTED, WHERE I AM, THE LENGTH OF
IT, THE DATE, THAT CONCERNS ME.

PARTICULARLY BECAUSE AMERICANS
DIDN'T KNOW THIS.

THAT'S WHY MANY'S CALLING FOR
REOPENING THE PATRIOT ACT.

REVEALED HIMSELF, I ASKED THE
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF ABOUT THE
LEAKER.

THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, FOR
WHATEVER REASON, HAS CHOSEN TO
VIOLATE A SECRET TRUST FOR THIS
COUNTRY.

DAMAGE THAT THESE REVELATIONS
INCUR ARE HUGE.

THAT, INFER THAT THERE HAS BEEN
A REFERRAL TO TRACK DOWN THE
LEAK?

ABSOLUTELY.

WE HAVE -- NSA HAS FILED A
CRIMES REPORT ON THIS ALREADY.

CONFIRMED HE WORKED FOR THE
COMPANY LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

THEY SAID IF THE REPORTS ARE
ACCURATE ABOUT THE LEAKS THEY
ARE SHOCKED AND THEY WOULD WORK
CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHORITIES ON
THE INVESTIGATION.
