HOW ONE YOUNG MAN GOT HIS HANDS
ON MANY OF THE NATION'S TOP
SECRETS.

HE IS ON THE MOVE TONIGHT.

HOW DANGEROUS IS IT?

WE BEGIN WITH ONE YOUNG AMERICAN
MAN WHO SAYS HE HAS CONTROL OF A
LOT OF THE NATION'S SECRETS
TONIGHT.

EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE 29-YEAR-OLD
WHISTLE BLOWER BEHIND THAT
MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE BREACH AT
THE NSA.

TONIGHT HE SAID HE'S A
TARGET AND ON THE MOVE, HIDDEN
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SHROUDED IN
MYSTERY AND DRAMA.

SCRAMBLING TO FIND HIM THERE ARE
REPORTS HE'S PREPARING TO MAKE
PUBLIC EVEN MORE OF THE NATION'S
MOST CLOSELY GUARDED SECRETS.

UNTIL HE CHECKED OUT SOME TIME
TODAY, EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS BEEN
HOLED UP IN LUXURY FOR THREE
WEEKS IN HONG KONG AT THE MEARA
HOTEL, ACCORDING TO EMPLOYEES
THERE.

BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT, EVERY MEAL
CAME FROM ROOM SERVICE, PILL
OH,S STUFFED UNDER THE DOOR TO
PREVENT EAVES DROPPING, AND HE
USED THE CODE NAME VERAX, LATIN
FOR TRUTH TELLER TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE WASHINGTON POST.

HE TOLD THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER
HE KNEW THE U.S. WOULD BE COMING
AFTER HIM, MAYBE EVEN WITH HIT
TEAMS.

THAT'S A FEAR I'LL LIVE UNDER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, HOWEVER
LONG THAT HAPPENS TO BE.

HE'S BEING PURSUED BECAUSE HE
REVEALED SECRETS USED TO TRACK
TERRORISTS.

LEAKS OF SENSITIVE CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION THAT CAUSE HARM TO
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST
ARE A PROBLEM.

NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
SURVEILLANCE AND COLLECTIONS
THEIR GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING
OUT.

THE NSA SPECIFICALLY TARGETS
THE COMMUNICATIONS OF EVERYONE.

IT INGESTS THEM BY DEFAULT.

UNDER SUSPICION UNTIL HE
DISAPPEARED FROM HIS JOB AS A
TECHNICIAN AT THE NSA IN HAWAII
MEDICAL LEAVE FOR EP LEPSY.

NEIGHBORS SAID HE VANISHED ONE
DAY.

ONE DAY HE WAS THERE, THE
NEXT HE WAS GONE.

MARYLAND DECLINED TO COMMENT BUT
A NEIGHBOR SAID HE WAS ALWAYS AT
HIS COMPUTER AS A YOUNG MAN.

I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING SCHOOL
WORK AND COME TO FIND OUT HE
DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE FROM HIGH
SCHOOL.

SNOWDEN CLAIMED HE HAD QUITE THE
TOP SECRET RESUME FOR SOMEONE
WHO DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

STARTING WITH NSA SECURITY
GUARD, FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF
FAILED ATTEMPT TO BECOME A
SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER.

THEN A HUGE JUMP, A CIA SPY IN
SWITZERLAND WORKING WITH
COMPUTERS.

THEN FOUR YEARS AS A CIVILIAN
CONTRACTOR WORKING WITH
COMPUTERS AT THE NSA IN JAPAN,
WASHINGTON AND HAWAII WHERE HE
SAYS HE DECIDED TO BLOW THE
WHISTLE ON WHAT HE CALLS THE
ABUSE OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF
AMERICA.

I SITTING AT MY DESK
CERTAINLY HAVE THE AUTHORITIES
TO WIRE TAP ANYONE FROM YOU OR
YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A FEDERAL
JUDGE TO EVEN A PRESIDENT IF I
HAD A PERSONAL E-MAIL.

IS SNOWDEN HAS APPARENTLY WITH
HIM MORE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS
INCLUDING THE NAMES OF HUNDREDS
OF SECRET AGENTS.

HE SAYS HE CHOSE TO GO TO HONG
KONG BECAUSE IT HAS A HISTORY OF
ALLOWING FREE SPEECH.

DIANE, IT ALSO HAS AN
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S.
 WHAT DO INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS SAY TO YOU ABOUT
SOMEONE OF THAT RANK WITH ACCESS
TO THOSE TOP SECRETS?

IT TURNS OUT HE IS ABOUT ONE
OF 850,000 PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
WHO HAVE SUCH TOP SECRET
CLEARANCE.

THAT'S PART OF A GROWING PROBLEM
UNDERSCORED BY THIS CASE IN
WHICH WHEN EVERYTHING IS SECRET
IT'S HARD TO KEEP THE TRUE AND
IMPORTANT SECRETS SECRET.

850,000.
