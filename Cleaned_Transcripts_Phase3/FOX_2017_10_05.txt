INVESTIGATORS HAVE REVEALED
STUNNING NEWS ABOUT THE CONCERT
KILLER.

FROM HIS APPARENT ESCAPE PLAN
AND HIS INTEREST IN OTHER MUSIC
FESTIVALS TO HIS MYSTERIOUS
PAST.

STEPHEN PADDOCK IS A MAN THAT
SPENT DECADES ACQUIRING WEAPONS
AND AMMO AND LIVING A SECRET
LIFE.

MUCH OF WHICH WILL NEVER BE
FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING TO
UNRAVEL HIS STORY AND WHETHER HE
HAD HELP.

WE'RE ALSO HEARING ABOUT THE
FIRE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST
RESPONDERS THAT RISKED THEIR
LIVES TO SAVE CIVILIANS ON THE
NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING.

POLICE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THE
WHITE HOUSE WEIGHING IN ON A
CONTROVERSIAL GUN DEVICE WHICH
MAY HAVE HELPED THE VEGAS
SHOOTER CARRY OUT HIS MADNESS.

AND FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK
THIS THURSDAY AFTERNOON, THE
WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S OPEN TO
THE IDEA OF REGULATING BUMP
STOCKS.

THOSE ARE THE DEVICES THAT THE
SHOOTER IN LAS VEGAS APPARENTLY
USED TO ALLOW HIS RIFLES TO FIRE
MUCH LIKE AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.

IT COMES JUST AFTER THE NATIONAL
RIFLE ASSOCIATION CALLED ON THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW
WHETHER BUMP STOCKS COMPLY WITH
THE LAW.

IN A STATEMENT LEADERS OF THE
GUN RIGHTS GROUP WROTE "THE NRA
BELIEVES THAT DEVICES DESIGNED
TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES TO
FUNCTION LIKE FULLY AUTOMATIC
RIFLES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO
ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS."

MORE AHEAD ON THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE TO THE
MASSACRE IN VEGAS.

WE'RE LEARNING THE GUNMAN MAY
HAVE HAD OTHER TARGETS IN MIND.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM THE
INVESTIGATORS.

THEY SAY STEPHEN PADDOCK RENTED
ROOMS OVERLOOKING TWO OTHER
MUSIC FESTIVALS.

ONE IN LAS VEGAS THE WEEKEND
BEFORE THIS SHOOTING AND ANOTHER
IN LAST AUGUST IN CHICAGO DURING
THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC FESTIVAL.

THERE'S REPORTS THAT PADDOCK
SCOUTED OUT HOTELS IN FENWAY
PARK IN BOSTON AND WE'RE
LEARNING HE MIGHT HAVE PLANNED
TO ESCAPE AFTER THE VEGAS
ATTACK.

THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF
WHO DIDN'T GIVE ANY OTHER
DETAILS.

POLICE SAY THE GUNMAN KILLED
HIMSELF IN HIS HOTEL ROOM AS
SWAT UNITS CLOSED IN.

HE KILLED 58 PEOPLE AND INJURED
HUNDREDS MORE AT THE COUNTRY
MUSIC FESTIVAL ACROSS THE
STREET.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY'RE STILL
STRUGGLING WHY HE DID THIS.

FBI AGENTS QUESTIONED THE
GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND YESTERDAY.

HER LAWYER SAYS SHE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT STEPHEN PADDOCK WAS
PLANNING WHEN HE SENT HER TO THE
PHILIPPINES TO BE WITH HER
FAMILY.

SHE SAID WHEN HE SENT HER
$100,000 AND TOLD HER TO BUY A
HOUSE, SHE THOUGHT HE WAS
BREAKING UP WITH HER.

THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO
MAINTAIN A LASER-LIKE FOCUS ON
THE HEALING AND THE AFTER MATH
OF THE DEVASTATION IN NEVADA BUT
THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE
FACT THAT THERE'S QUESTIONS,
ESPECIALLY ABOUT AS WHAT YOU
JUST LAID OUT, THE BUMP STOCK
THAT WAS USED IN THIS ASSAULT ON
SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES IN THE
NEVADA DESERT.

SHE SAID THIS AS FAR AS THE
ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW OF A
POSSIBLE BAN.

OUR FOCUS, AS WE SAID THE
LAST COUPLE DAYS, HAS BEEN ON
HEALING AND UNITING THE COUNTRY.

THE INVESTIGATION STILL
CONTINUES TO BE IN VERY EARLY
STAGES.

WE KNOW THAT BOTH MEMBERS OF
BOTH PARTIES IN MULTIPLE
ORGANIZATIONS ARE PLANNING TO
TAKE A LOOK AT BUMP STOCKS AND
RELATED DEVICES.

WE WELCOME THAT.

GOT TO DO IT.

HAVE TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK
AT IT.

WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY
CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS CAN
UNPACK SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
SHEPARD.

SO MOVEMENT NOT ON GUN
CONTROL, BUT ON REGULATING
OUTSIDE DEVICES.

SOME CONSERVATIVES AND
REPUBLICANS HAVE COME OUT IN
FAVOR OF TAKING A LOOK AT BUMP
STOCKS.

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I
PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
THIS.

AND NOW THE NRA SAYING YEAH, YOU
OUGHT TO LOOK AT IT.

IS THERE AN APPETITE FOR REAL
GUN CONTROL?

WE KNOW THIS PRESIDENT WAS AT
ONE POINT A NEW YORK LIBERAL.

YOU WINDER IF HE WON'T MIGRATE
IN THAT DIRECTION.

THIS IS THE ONE AREA AT BEST
THAT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU'RE FOR
GUN CONTROL OR GUN CONTROL OF
THIS TYPE THAT YOU'LL FIND ANY
KIND OF COALESCING OF PEOPLE
SUPPORTING IT.

YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON
HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

THE NRA EVEN SAYING THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED
AT.

CERTAINLY -- I'VE COVERED SOME
OF THESE TRAGEDIES A LONG TIME.

THIS IS AS MUCH COALESCING
AROUND ONE PROACTIVE THING THAT
THEY COULD DO IN LEGISLATION
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 2018
ELECTION YEAR, A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS THAT DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE AN ELECTION YEAR ISSUE.

JOE MANCHIN, HEIDI HEIDCAMP,
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO
AHEAD, WHY INVESTIGATORS SAY THE
KILLER IN LAS VEGAS MAY HAVE HAD
HELP.

THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX
NEWS DECK ON A THURSDAY
FIRST RESPONDERS THAT RUSHED
INTO HARM'S WAY AND FIRED INTO A
CROWD OF 22,000 PEOPLE.

THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES
THEY FACE.

SHEP, THERE WAS A GROUP OF
FIREFIGHTERS THAT WAS HANDLING A
CAR NEAR MANDALAY BAY BEFORE
THIS STARTED.

THEY WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN
FIVE SECONDS.

THEY'RE SAYING WITHIN A FEW
MINUTES, THERE WAS MORE THAN 100
FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE TO HEAR
THEIR PERSPECTIVE IS FRIGHTENING
AND VERY FASCINATING.

THEY WERE WORKING THIS WHOLE
TRIAGE SETUP UNDER FIRE.

KIND OF LIKE A BATTLEFIELD.

AT ONE POINT IN TIME, THE RADIO
TRAFFIC WAS SO JUMBLED THAT THE
FIREFIGHTERS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHERE THE SHOOTING WAS COMING
FROM.

THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE WORKING
WITH MULTIPLE SHOOTERS.

THEN THEY SAID THE FEEL OF
VICTIMS WAS ALMOST A MILE LONG.

LISTEN TO THIS.

THEY WERE LAYING IN BETWEEN
THE RUNWAYS, TRYING TO TAKE
COVER.

THE AREAS ARE CARVED OUT BETWEEN
THE RUNWAYS AND THE TAXIWAYS.

THEN WE HAD REPORTS OF GUN SHOTS
AT THE AIRPORT.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WE HAD A LOT
ON OUR HANDS.

A LOT WE THOUGHT WAS ESCALATING
WHEN IT WAS REALLY CONTAINED BUT
WE DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE OF SO
MANY CALLS COMING IN.

WHEN HE SAID ON THE RUNWAY OF
ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW.

THEY PUSHED DOWN THE FENCES AND
RAN TO GET AWAY AND ENDED UP
BETWEEN THE RUNWAYS AND THE
TAXIWAYS.

IT'S PHENOMENAL.

THE FIREFIGHTERS SAID THEY HAD
REHEARSED, TRAINING FOR THIS
SCENARIO FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE
THEY'RE A HIGH TARGET
DESTINATION.

TRACE, ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE
OTHER POSSIBLE TARGETS?

WELL, WE HAVE DEFINITELY
CONFIRMED THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK
DID BOOK A HOTEL ROOM IN CHICAGO
OVERLOOKING GRANT PARK IN AUGUST
DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA CONCERT
THAT MALIA OBAMA WAS IN
ATTENDANCE THERE.

THE BLACKSTONE HOTEL RELEASED A
STATEMENT.

IT SAYS "ON BEHALF OF THE
BLACKSTONE, WE CAN CONFIRM THERE
WAS NO GUEST UNDER THE NAME WHO
STAYED AT OUR HOTEL IN AUGUST
DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC
FESTIVAL.

WE CAN CONFIRM A RESERVATION WAS
MADE UNDER THE NAME OF STEPHEN
PADDOCK.

HOWEVER, AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT
CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS THE SAME
PERSON AS THE LAS VEGAS SHOOTER.

WE'RE COOPERATING WITH THE
AUTHORITIES ON THAT MATTER."

NOW THE CHICAGO POLICE HAVE IN
FACT CONFIRMED THIS IS THE VERY
SAME STEPHEN PADDOCK THAT DID
BOOK THAT HOTEL AT THE
BLACKSTONE OVERLOOKING
LOLLAPALOOZA.

WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT HE
BOOKED A HOTEL ROOM AT THE
MANDALAY BAY AND ANOTHER CONCERT
CALLED LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL BY
CHANCE THE RAPPER.

SO WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ON
THE REPORTS OF THE AVIATION FUEL
TANKS, WE JUST MENTIONED
FUEL TANKS WERE HIT BE SOME
BULLETS.

THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL
SAID HE WAS TARGETING IT.

WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO CONFIRM THAT WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH TO RULE IT OUT.

THE BULLETS DID HIT THE TANK.

WERE THEY BULLETS THAT WERE
BEING RANDOMLY FIRED?

POSSIBLE.

WAS IT TARGETED?

ALSO POSSIBLE.

THE SHERIFF LAST NIGHT IN THIS
ASTOUNDING NEWS CONFERENCE MADE
MENTION OF A POTENTIAL
ACCOMPLICE.

HE BELIEVES THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK
DID HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE.

OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE A SUPER
HUMAN EFFORT TO PULL OFF WHAT HE
DID ALONE.

THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS
SAYING IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO
THIS ATTACK AT THE MANDALAY BAY
HOTEL WHERE HE WAS GAMBLING FOR
HOURS AND HOURS, HE WAS WITH A
WOMAN THAT WAS NOT HIS
GIRLFRIEND AND NOW POLICE ARE
INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHO
EXACTLY THAT WOMAN WAS WITH HIM
IN THOSE DAYS LEADING UP TO IT,
SHEP.

A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE LAS VEGAS GUNMAN, STEPHEN
PADDOCK.

AHEAD WE'LL TALK WITH A FORMER
FBI INVESTIGATOR ABOUT THE
QUESTIONS HE SAYS THAT
INVESTIGATORS NEED TO GET
ANSWERED.

â™ª
 THE NUMBER 2 OFFICIAL IN THE
ANYBODY SAYS HE'S SURPRISED THAT
INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT LEARNED
MORE YET ABOUT WHAT DROVE
STEPHEN PADDOCK TO COMMIT MASS
MURDER.

OF WORK TO DO.

WHAT IS MISSING?

WHAT ARE THE BIG MISSES PIECES?

THERE'S NO EASY BOX TO PUT
PADDOCK IN.

IF AN ATTACK HAPPENS, IT'S AN
ISLAMIC ATTACK OR RACIALLY
MOTIVATED ATTACK.

PADDOCK DIDN'T HIT ANY OF THOSE
TRIP WIRES.

THE INVESTIGATORS HAVE TO DIG
DEEP AND FIGURING OUT WHAT HIS
MOTIVATION WAS, WHAT CAUSED HIM
MILLIONAIRE REAL ESTATE
INVESTOR.

HE GAMBLED A LOT.

IF HE BLEW ALL OF HIS MONEY
GAMBLING THEY WOULD KNOW THAT BY
NOW, WOULDN'T THEY?

AND THEY SHOULD.

THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATION
WILL GO.

IT WILL GO INTO HIS FINANCIAL
BACKGROUND, GOES INTO ANYBODY HE
CONTACTED.

THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE
FIRST WIFE, THE SECOND WIFE,
PEOPLE HE WORKED WITH.

HE SEEMED TO HAVE VARIOUS
DIFFERENT JOBS, ALL GOOD JOBS,
BUT DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND
DIFFERENT JOBS.

THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THOSE
CO-WORKERS AND BOSSES TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT MADE THIS GUY TICK.

WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT.

WE DON'T.

I THINK THE LAS VEGAS
METROPOLITAN POLICE HAVE THAT
NOTE AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING UP
ANYTHING ON IT.

HAVE -- POLICE CAN WITHHOLD
WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THE COURSE
OF AN INVESTIGATION.

IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY
NEED TO GET TO, THEY CAN
WITHHOLD INFORMATION.

I WONDER IF THEY DON'T KNOW
ABOUT MOTIVE THAN WHAT WE'RE
HEARI
HEARING?

AND THEY MAY.

IN AN INVESTIGATION, YOU DON'T
WANT TO TIP YOUR HAT.

INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HOLD
THE INFORMATION THEY HAVE TO
FURTHER THEIR INVESTIGATION
WITHOUT TIPPING THEIR HAND OR
LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT I MAY
BECOME A SUBJECT OF AN
INVESTIGATION.

IT DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD.

WAS WITH A WOMAN GAMBLING BEFORE
COMMITTING THIS ATTACK SOMEONE
WHO HASN'T COME FORWARD, MUST
REALIZE WOW, THIS IS THE GUY I
WAS WITH THAT NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO
HAVE QUESTIONS FOR WHOEVER THAT
IS.

THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION.

IN THE COURSE OF THE
INVESTIGATION, THEY NEED TO TALK
TO THAT WOMAN.

I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE.

I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT WHEN YOU
SAID IT.

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN TELL
US HOW OR WHAT PADDOCK WAS
FEELING.

THAT'S ALL PART OF THE
INVESTIGATION.

REASON, RIGHT?

I DON'T REMEMBER A MATT ATTACK
WHERE IN THE END NO ONE CAN
FIGURE OUT WHY THEY DID IT.

MAY NOT BE A REASONABLE REASON
BUT THERE IS USUALLY A REASON.

RIGHT.

YEAH, ALWAYS A REASON.

IT MAY BE ONE THAT NOBODY CAN
AGREE WITH.

PERSON MAY BE CRAZY.

SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SAID,
MAYBE HIS FINANCIAL SITUATION
TURNED BAD.

MAYBE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN
PURCHASING 33 WEAPONS OVER THE
COURSE OF A YEAR.

HE MAY HAVE BEEN PLANNING THIS
AS FAR AS A YEAR AND DIDN'T HIT
IT'S TIME FOR THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE TO MOVE
ON AFTER THE TOP REPUBLICAN SAYS
THEY'RE STILL LOOKING INTO THE
POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION BETWEEN
MOSCOW AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
LAS VEGAS GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.

HER LAWYER SPEAKING NOW AFTER
HOURS OF FBI QUESTIONING.

WE'LL HAVE THAT NEXT.

THE GUNMAN THAT KILLED 58
PEOPLE
IN LAS VEGAS THIS WEEK SAYS SHE
HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING
THE MASSACRE.

THAT'S ACCORDING TO HER
ATTORNEY.

THE LAWYER READ A STATEMENT TO A
CROWD OUTSIDE FBI HEAD QUARTERS
IN L.A. AFTER AGENTS QUESTIONED
HER FOR HOURS.

HER NAME IS MARILOU DANLEY.

SHE SAID THE KILLER SENT HER TO
THE PHILIPPINES WHERE SHE HAD
FAMILY AND SHE WAS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.

WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IN THE WEST
COAST NEWS HUB THIS AFTERNOON.

WILLIAM?

INVESTIGATORS HOPED THAT
DANLEY WOULD TELL US WHY.

A QUIET MILLIONAIRE WOULD
SUDDENLY SHOOT 58 PEOPLE.

SHE DIDN'T.

SHE SAID THAT PADDOCK SENT HER A
CHEAP TICKET AND SENT HER TO THE
PHILIPPINES AS A GIFT.

AS FOR THE $100,000 THAT
FOLLOWED, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
GOOD-BYE MONEY THAT PADDOCK WAS
ENDING THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

AT NO TIME DID SHE KNOW WHAT HE
WAS GOING TO DO HERE'S DANLEY'S
ATTORNEY READING HER STATEMENT.

I KNEW STEPHEN PADDOCK AS A
KIND, CARING, QUIET MAN.

HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME OR
TOOK ANY ACTION THAT I WAS AWARE
OF THAT I UNDERSTOOD IN ANY WAY
TO BE A WARNING THAT SOMETHING
HORRIBLE LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

STILL DANLEY'S HELP REMAINS
CRUCIAL IN REBUILDING HIS LIFE,
MENTAL HEALTH, WHAT HE BOUGHT
AND WHEN HE BOUGHT IT.

ANOTHER POSSIBLE LEAD THAT THE
FBI HAS SAID THEY HAVE NOT HAD A
PROBLEM ACCESSING PADDOCK'S
ELECTRONIC FILES, COMPUTER AND
PHONE THAT COULD CORROBORATE HER
THE UNLV FOOTBALL PLAYERS WILL
BE WEARING A SPECIAL HELMET TO
HONOR THE VICTIMS OF THE
SHOOTING.

THE SCHOOL TWEETED THIS PHOTO.

THE PLAYERS TO WEAR THIS HELMET
THIS SATURDAY AND THROUGH THE
END OF THE SEASON.

THE CAMPUS FROM UNLV IS A FEW
MILES FROM THE SHOOTING.

UNLV ANNOUNCED THAT SATURDAY
NIGHT'S GAME AGAINST SAN DIEGO
STATE WILL BE CALLED HERO'S
NIGHT.

THE PREGAME CEREMONY IS TO HONOR
THE VICTIMS AND FIRST RESPONDERS
OF THE DAY.
