TONIGHT, POWERLESS       
   AND PARALYZED.

HURRICANE MARIA              
   GAINING STRENGTH AND         
   ON THE MOVE.

AFTER KNOCKING OUT ALL       
   POWER IN PUERTO RICO.

NEIGHBORHOODS                
   DEMOLISHED, STREETS          
   UNDER WATER.

WE'RE LIVE IN THE            
   DISASTER ZONE.

36 HOURS AFTER               
   HURRICANE MARIA              
   STORMED ASHORE IN            
   PUERTO RICO RIPPING          
   APART HOMES AND              
   FLOODING STREETS, IT'S       
   POSSIBLE WE HAVE NOT         
   YET SEEN THE WORST OF        
   IT.

THAT'S BECAUSE ENTIRE        
   AREAS REMAIN CUT OFF         
   THIS EVENING.

POWER IS OUT ACROSS          
   THE ISLAND.

COMMUNICATIONS ARE           
   SPOTTY.

WATER IS RUNNING             
   SHORT.

AND THE NUMBER OF            
   POSSIBLE CASUALTIES IS       
   STILL UNKNOWN.

TONIGHT THE MILLIONS         
   OF AMERICANS THERE           
   WAIT AS AN URGENT            
   RELIEF EFFORT KICKS          
   INTO HIGH GEAR.

LET'S GET THE LATEST         
   FROM OUR GABE                
   GUTIERREZ.

NOW UP TO 18 ACROSS          
   THE CARIBBEAN                
   INCLUDING ONE DEATH          
   HERE IN PUERTO RICO.

BUT THE TRUE EXTENT OF       
   THE DAMAGE IS NOT YET        
   KNOWN.

HERE MANY ROADS ARE          
   IMPASSABLE AND               
   COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS       
   ARE DOWN WHICH MEANS         
   IT COULD TAKE QUITE A        
   WHILE TO GET A HANDLE        
   ON THE FULL SCOPE OF         
   MARIA'S DESTRUCTION.

TONIGHT, IN THE WAKE         
   OF HURRICANE MARIA,          
   PARTS OF PUERTO RICO         
   ARE DESPERATE.

RESIDENTS FORCED TO          
   WADE THROUGH                 
   WAIST-HIGH WATER TO          
   SAFETY.

MANY AREAS UNREACHABLE       
   BY LAND OR BY PHONE          
   AND VIRTUALLY THE            
   ENTIRE U.S.

TERRITORY        
   IS WITHOUT POWER.

SEARCH AND RESCUE            
   OPERATIONS FROM              
   MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN         
   PUERTO RICO AND THE          
   U.S. MAINLAND NOW            
   UNDER WAY.

DOZENS OF FAMILIES           
   RESCUED DURING THE           
   EARLY MORNING WITH           
   JUST FLASHLIGHTS TO          
   GUIDE THEM IN THE SAN        
   JUAN COMMUNITY.

TODAY WE RODE ALONG          
   WITH THE NATIONAL            
   GUARD AND GOVERNOR           
   RICARDO ROSSELLO WHO         
   HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO          
   COMMUNICATE NOT JUST         
   WITH MAYORS IN SOME          
   PARTS OF THE ISLAND          
   BUT EVEN HIS OWN             
   PARENTS OUTSIDE SAN          
   JUAN.

EVERYBODY HAS FELT        
   THE PAIN AND THE             
   ANXIETY OF NOT               
   PATH OF DESTRUCTION IS       
   RELENTLESS,                  
   DEVASTATING THE              
   DOMINICAN REPUBLIC           
   OVERNIGHT.

DANGEROUS STORM SURGE        
   AND DAMAGING WINDS           
   THAT RIP ROOFS OFF           
   HOMES.

NEW VIDEO OUT OF ST.         
   CROIX TODAY SHOWS THE        
   EXTENT OF THE                
   DESTRUCTION THERE.

BIG MAHOGANY TREES        
   THAT WERE ROOTED UP.

PEOPLE DIED FROM THE         
   STORM.

FOR MANY IN PUERTO           
   RICO, THE CLEANUP IS         
   JUST BEGINNING.

IT IS STILL EXTREMELY        
   DIFFICULT TO GET             
   AROUND SAN JUAN.

AND THIS IS PART OF          
   THE REASON WHY.

POWER LINES ACROSS           
   THIS AREA ARE DOWN.

VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE         
   ISLAND IS WITHOUT            
   POWER.

MANY ROADS ARE               
   IMPASSABLE.

AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE        
   JUST NOW STARTING TO         
   GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT        
   THE DEVASTATION.

PEDRON RODE OUT THE          
   STORM IN HIS HOME AND        
   TODAY RETURNED TO HIS        
   BUSINESS.

IT'S SHOCKING.

REALLY DEVASTATING.

ESTIMATES SHOW THE           
   DAMAGE ACROSS PUERTO         
   RICO COULD TOTAL $30         
   BILLION.

THE EMOTIONAL TOLL           
   CAN'T BE MEASURED.

DARK DAYS IN PUERTO          
   RICO EXPECTED TO LAST        
   MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE       
   MARIA RIPPED APART THE       
   ISLAND'S ENTIRE POWER        
   GRID.

NEARLY ALL OF ITS 3.5        
   MILLION RESIDENTS            
   WITHOUT ELECTRICITY          
   TONIGHT.

CELL PHONE SERVICE SO        
   UNRELIABLE THAT PEOPLE       
   LIKE THIS WOMAN STILL        
   HAVEN'T HEARD FROM           
   THEIR FAMILY.

WE'RE DESPERATE.

I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR        
   35 YEAR AND THIS IS          
   TOO MUCH.

I HAVEN'T TALKED TO       
   MY MOM EITHER.

SO I'M TRYING TO GO TO       
   STREETS ARE LITTERED         
   WITH DOWNED POWER            
   LINES.

THIS STORM EVEN              
   CRACKING CONCRETE IN         
   HALF.

DAMAGING AN                  
   INFRASTRUCTURE THAT          
   WAS ALREADY CRUMBLING.

OFFICIALS SAY HELP IS        
   ON THE WAY, BUT A FULL       
   RECOVERY COULD TAKE          
   HALF A YEAR.

WHICH ONE'S GOING TO         
   BE WORSE, THE STORM OR       
   WHAT COMES AFTER THE         
   STORM?

AFTER THE STORM.

HOURS TO GET GAS TO          
   POWER THEIR GENERATOR.

SHE SAYS SHE'S SCARED        
   WHAT THE NEXT SIX            
   MONTHS ARE GOING TO          
   BRING.

SHE'S A SINGLE MOTHER.

SHE HAS TO TAKE CARE         
   OF HER DAUGHTER, AND         
   SHE DOESN'T KNOW             
   WHAT'S GOING TO              
   HAPPEN.

NOW FAMILIES ACROSS          
   THE I ISLAND TRYING TO       
   PREPARE FOR THE HUMAN        
   DARKNESS OF LIFE OFF         
   THE GRID.

THE DANGER FROM          
   HURRICANE MARIA IS NOT       
   OVER YET.

THE MONSTER STORM            
   REGAINED STRENGTH            
   AFTER IT STRUCK PUERTO       
   RICO.

IT'S EXPECTED TO CUT         
   CLOSE TO TURKS AND           
   CAICOS LATE TONIGHT,         
   AND AFTER THAT THE           
   CURRENT TRACK SHOWS IT       
   BARRELING BETWEEN THE        
   U.S. EAST COAST AND          
   BERMUDA.
