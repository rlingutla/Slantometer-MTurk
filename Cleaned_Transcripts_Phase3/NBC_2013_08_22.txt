ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT --
OUT OF CONTROL AND RUNNING OUT
OF CASH TO FIGHT THE WORST FIRE
 EYES OF THE WORLD ON THE
ATROCI IN SYRIA.

NEW BOMBINGS IN THE VILLAGES
WHERE SO MANY CHILDREN DIED.

AND TONIGHT, WHAT COULD BE NEW
EVIDENCE.

WE TURN OVERSEAS NOW TO
SYRIA AND SOME HORRIFYING IMAGES
THAT WILL INSTINCTIVELY MAKE YOU
WANT TO LOOK AWAY.

YET THEY CANNOT BE IGNORED.

VIDEO EVIDENCE OF WHAT MAY HAVE
HAPPENED NOW INSIDE SYRIA.

A MASS CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

HAS SHOCKED THE WORLD.

HUNDREDS, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,
ARE DEAD.

TONIGHT THE CLAIMS OF A CHEMICAL
ATTACK HAVE STILL NOT BEEN
VERIFIED.

FROM THE SYRIAN REGIME DENIALS,
AS THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WHICH
FOR A YEAR HAS CALLED THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA A RED
LINE, IS BEING CAUTIOUS AS IT
NOW CALLS FOR AN INVESTIGATION.

YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHAT THE
REBELS SAY IS THE EVIDENCE.

SOME OF IT IS VERY GRAPHIC.

MORE VIDEOS EMERGE FROM SYRIA
TODAY.

THEY ARE UNCONFIRMED BY NBC
NEWS, BUT THEY ARE CONSISTENT
WITH THE ACCOUNTS OF WITNESSES
WE SPOKE TO.

AND AGAIN, THESE IMAGES ARE
GRAPHIC.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT BOMBED
VILLAGES OUTSIDE DAMASCUS TODAY,
THE SAME VILLAGES HIT YESTERDAY
BY WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WAR CRIME.

AN OUTRAGE.

HUNDREDS KILLED BY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THE REBELS SAY, MANY OF
THEM BURIED TODAY IN MASS
GRAVES.

A SYRIAN CAMERAMAN CONTRACTED BY
OUR PARTNER ITN FILMED PEOPLE
LOOKING AT AN EXPLODED ROCKET.

NEAR IT, DEAD BODIES.

NBC NEWS HAS NO WAY TO CONFIRM
THAT THE CASUALTIES WERE CAUSED
BY THIS WEAPON.

THERE IS STILL NO DEFINITIVE
PROOF THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE
USED OR BY WHOM.

BUT HOW CAN ANYONE FAKE ROWS OF
DEAD CHILDREN?

NO APPARENT INJURIES.

NO BLOOD.

JUST LIFELESS BODIES, THEIR ARMS
FOLDED.

SO MANY THEY'RE NOT EVEN NAMED,
BUT NUMBERED.

THIS IS BABY 11 FROM THE VILLAGE
OF DUMA, THE NUMBER WRITTEN ON A
BURIAL SHROUD.

IN SYRIA OUTRAGES HAVE LONG GONE
UNPUNISHED.

A VICIOUS CIVIL WAR NOW IN ITS
THIRD YEAR, MORE THAN 100,000
DEAD, NEARLY 2 MILLION REFUGEES.

THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT.

THERE IS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF
THE TUNNEL.

OPTIONS INCLUDE A NO-FLY ZONE TO
GROUND ASSAD'S AIR POWER.

EXPENSIVE AND A LONG-TERM
COMMITMENT, NOT ACTIVELY BEING
CONSIDERED.

ARMING THE REBELS.

BUT WASHINGTON WORRIES, WHO
WOULD GET THE WEAPONS?

THE REBELS ARE DIVIDED WITH SOME
LINKED TO AL QAEDA.

WHAT ABOUT A MILITARY INVASION?

U.S. BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

FOR WAR-WEARY AMERICANS, THAT'S
NOT EVEN UNDER CONSIDERATION.

TODAY A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL SAID THE U.S. MUST BE,
QUOTE, HUMBLE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN
AND CANNOT DO.

AND WITH ASSAD BACKED BY RUSSIA,
IRAN, AND HEZBOLLAH, THERE IS
LITTLE THE WORLD CAN DO.

THE U.N. HAS PROVEN TO BE
UTTERLY POWERLESS.

IT HAS INSPECTORS IN DAMASCUS
RIGHT NOW, JUST A FEW MILES FROM
WHERE SO MANY DIED YESTERDAY,
BUT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WON'T
LET THEM SEE WHAT COULD BE THE
WORST ATROCITY IN SYRIA'S
ATROCIOUS WAR.

IT'S UNCLEAR, LESTER, IF THIS
WILL BE A TURNING POINT OR JUST
ANOTHER HORROR IN A WAR NO ONE
WANTS TO -- SEEMS TO WANT TO
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH.
