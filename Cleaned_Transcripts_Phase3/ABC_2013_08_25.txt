THE MESSAGE FROM THE U.S. TO
SYRIA THIS EVENING.

WILL THE WHITE HOUSE TAKE
ACTION, AFTER NEW AND GRUESOME
IMAGES?

NOW TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA
THIS EVENING, AND TO A MESSAGE
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, INTENDED
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THERE IS
VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS
THE SYRIAN REGIME THAT USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ITS OWN
PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.

AND TONIGHT, MORE OF THOSE NEW
IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH.

BELIEVED TO BE THE SINGLE
DEADLIEST ATTACK SO FAR THERE IN
SYRIA.

SYRIA SAYS IT WILL ALLOW
INSPECTORS.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THAT TIME
HAS PASSED.

AND SO TONIGHT HERE, WE ASK,
WILL AMERICA ACT?

WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

TO TAKING MILITARY ACTION IN
SYRIA THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH
STRONG WORDS FROM U.S. OFFICIALS
TODAY AND WARSHIPS AT THE READY.

NAVY DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES
NOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
COULD LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILES
INTO SYRIA WHENEVER ORDERED,
TARGETING SYRIAN REGIME COMMAND
AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS,
AIRFIELDS OR AIRCRAFT THAT MIGHT
BE USED TO CARRY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

ANOTHER OPTION -- U.S.

FIGHTER
JETS LAUNCHING WEAPONS FROM
OUTSIDE SYRIAN AIR SPACE.

THE SYRIANS HAVE CREATED THIS
SANCTUARY, WHERE THERE ARE
SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES.

SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK HAVE
OUTRAGED THE WORLD.

MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED
IN THE MOST HORRIFIC WAY.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL NOT
INTERVENE UNTIL THE ATTACK IS
VERIFIED, BUT ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS ARE TONIGHT SAYING
THERE IS A STRONG SUSPICION THAT
THE ASSAD REGIME LAUNCHED THE
ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE REBELS
DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE KIND OF
ROCKETS IN WHICH THE CHEMICALS
WERE BELIEVED TO BE DELIVERED.

TODAY, SYRIA SAID IT WOULD ALLOW
U.N.

INSPECTORS TO VISIT THE
SITE, BUT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY
IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND
THE EVIDENCE THEY WOULD PRESENT
IS LIKELY CORRUPTED.

SO, HOW SOON COULD THIS HAPPEN?

U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS, A
RESPONSE MUST BE TIMELY, DONE
SOON ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANOTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

"WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
MONTHS."

I THINK THE BEST THAT WE
COULD HOPE FOR IS TO DETER MR.
ASSAD FROM USING CHEMICALS
AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AGAIN.

AND WORST CASE, DRAG US INTO A
LARGER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT.

ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO MADE
VERY CLEAR THEY DO NOT WANT TO
TAKE ANY KIND OF ACTION ALONE.

SO, THERE HAVE BEEN URGENT
MEETINGS WITH ALLIES HERE IN THE
REGION AND ELSEWHERE.
