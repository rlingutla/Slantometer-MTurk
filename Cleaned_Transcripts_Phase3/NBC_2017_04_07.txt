THE U.S. TOMAHAWK
ATTACK IN SYRIA, HOW
WILL ASSAD RESPOND?

TONIGHT A WAR OF WORDS
AS RUSSIA LASHES OUT
AND THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WARNING
ITS PREPARED TO TAKE
FURTHER ACTION.

THE U.S. TONIGHT
ASSESSING THE DAMAGE
AND MEASURING THE
REACTION AND FALLOUT
TO THE PUNISHING AIR
RAID ON SYRIA.

FOR SEVERAL LONG
MINUTES OVERNIGHT,
DOZENS OF AMERICAN
TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILES RAINED DOWN
ON THE SYRIAN MILITARY
AIRFIELD THAT'S BEEN
LINKED TO THIS WEEK'S
DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
ON CIVILIANS IN A
REBEL HELD AREA OF THE
COUNTRY.

SIX PEOPLE ON THE
GROUND WERE KILLED IN
THE OVERNIGHT MISSILE
STRIKE.

TONIGHT AS POST STRIKE
IMAGES OF THE AIR
FIELD EMERGED, WE HAVE
NEW DETAILS ON HOW THE
U.S. OPERATION
UNFOLDED, THE MESSAGE
SENT, AND QUESTIONS
OVER WHETHER THIS
OPENS A NEW CHAPTER IN
A CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT
TRUMP REPEATEDLY
PROMISED TO STEER
CLEAR OF.

WE HAVE TWO REPORTS,
FIRST RICHARD ENGEL ON
THE MISSILE ATTACK
IMAGES TONIGHT FROM
RUSSIAN TV OF THE
SYRIAN BASE ATTACK ON
ORDERS FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

THEY SHOW LITTLE
DESTRUCTION.

RUSSIA APPARENTLY
TRYING TO DOWNPLAY THE
IMPACT OF THE STRIKES.

BUT THE U.S. MILITARY
LATE TODAY RELEASING
THESE PHOTOS, SHOWING
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO
THE BASE, THE U.S.
SAYS THE SYRIAN REGIME
USED TO LAUNCH THIS
WEEK'S DEADLY CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

AT 740 P.M., TWO NAVY
DESTROYERS IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN LAUNCHED
60 CRUISE MISSILES.

TARGETING THE AIR
BASE.

ONE MISSILE MISFIRED
INTO THE SEA, THE REST
DIRECT HITS DESTROYING
20 SYRIAN AIRCRAFT AND
REINFORCED HANGARS AND
FUEL DEPOTS.

THE U.S. SAYS IT
AVOIDED TARGETING
CHEMICAL WILLS ON THE
BASE TO PREVENT
DISBURSING TOXINS.

BASHAR AL ASSAD'S
GOVERNMENT TODAY CALL
THE STRIKES FOOLISH
AND UNMOTIVATED.

THEY ATTACK US IN
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO
HELP THE TERRORIST
SERIOUS DISPUTE NOW IS
WITH SYRIA'S BACKER
RUSSIA.

THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS
IT INFORMED MOSCOW
BEFORE THE STRIKES TO
AVOID RUSSIAN
CASUALTIES ON THE
BASE.

NOW THE U.S. MILITARY
IS INVESTIGATING IF
RUSSIA WAS COMPLICIT
IN THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
OR MERELY FAILED TO
STOP IT.

A WAR OF WORDS TODAY
AT THE U.N. SECURITY
COUNSEL.

THE UNITED STATES
TOOK A VERY MEASURED
STEP LAST NIGHT.

WE ARE PREPARED TO DO
MORE.

BUT WE HOPE THAT WILL
NOT BE NECESSARY.

AS A FRAGRANT
VIOLATION OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND
AN ACT OF AGGRESSION.

SPOKESMAN CALLED THE
ATTACK A SIGNIFICANT
BLOW IN RELATIONS WITH
WASHINGTON.

BUT THIS ATTACK,
LIMITED AND APENANTLY
A ONE OFF, WAS NOT
ABOUT REDEFINING
RELATIONS WITH SYRIA
OR RUSSIA, BUT SENDING
A MESSAGE.

I THINK IT WAS A
WIN FOR THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.

I THINK THEY HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
FORCEFULNESS TO THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY.

THE QUESTION IS, YOU
KNOW, THE OTHER SIDE
GETS A VOTE, WHAT WILL
THE IRANIAN
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
DO?

HEZBOLLAH MILITIAS AND
FOR THAT MATTER, ASSAD
HIMSELF.

INCREASE ITS AIR
DEFENSES IN SYRIA.

THE U.S. MILITARY,
HOWEVER, SAYS THERE
ARE NO INDICATIONS
MOSCOW PLANS TO
RETALIATE.

AND A MEETING BETWEEN
PUTIN AND SECRETARY OF
STATE REX TILLERSON
SCHEDULED NEXT WEEK IN
MOSCOW IS STILL ON.

WE'RE
LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE DRAMA BEHIND THE
SCENES IN THE MOMENTS
LEADING UP TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP
ORDERING THOSE STRIKES
ON SYRIA.

RESPONSE FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED
ABOUT HIS STRIKE IN
SYRIA.

DECISION HE MADE AFTER
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE
CALLS A 72-HOUR
EVOLUTION.

TUESDAY MORNING, THE
PRESIDENT IS BRIEFED
ON THE ATTACK, QUOTE
DISTURBED BY IT AND
ASKING FOR OPTIONS.

THAT TRIGGERS 48 HOURS
OF INTENSE MEETINGS
INCLUDING ONE ENROUTE
TO PALM BEACH.

BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON,
A DECISION, GREEN
LIGHTING THE STRIKE.

IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,
THE LAUNCH BEGINNING.

90 MINUTES LATER, HE'S
BRIEFED IN THIS SECURE
ROOM AT MAR-A-LAGO.

THE MOOD INSIDE
CAUTIOUSLY CONFIDENT.

ACCORDING TO AN
ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL.

NOT LONG AFTER THE
PRESIDENT ADDRESSES
THE NATION.

EVEN BEAUTIFUL
BABIES WERE CRUELLY
MURDERED IN THIS VERY
BARBARIC ATTACK.

THIS NOW HAS
PROVIDED THE
ADMINISTRATION A
DEMONSTRATION MOMENTS
FOR THE REST OF THE
WORLD TO INCLUDE THE
CHINESE AND THE
RUSSIANS, TO
UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF
IN TOWN.

WASHINGTON TODAY,
LAWMAKERS BRIEFED ON
WHAT HAPPENED.

THE SIGNAL IS AS
IMPORTANT AS THE
ACTUAL DAMAGE THAT WAS
DONE.

DON'T LIKE HOW THE
PRESIDENT CUT OUT
CONGRESS.

I THINK THE
PRESIDENT OWES IT TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO
COME TO CONGRESS AND
ADMINISTRATION ARGUES
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
CAN DECIDE ON HIS OWN
TO TAKE MILITARY
ACTION TO PROTECT THE
U.S.

BUT BY GETTING
INVOLVED IN SYRIA, THE
PRESIDENT REVERSED HIS
PAST POSITION.

AS THE WHITE HOUSE
INSISTS HE'S STILL
COMMITTED TO AMERICA
FIRST.

THAT'S THE POLICY
PUSHED BY STEVE
BANNON, RECENTLY
OUSTED FROM THE
POWERFUL NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNSEL
SPARKING SPECULATION
HE'S LOSING INFLUENCE.

THE WHITE HOUSE
PUSHING BACK ON
REPORTS OF AN IMMINENT
STAFF SHAKEUP THAT
COULD INCLUDE BANNON
AND CHIEF OF STAFF
REINCE PRIEBUS, CRISIS
ON FRONTS IN THE
AFTERMATH OF THE
PRESIDENT'S MOST
SIGNIFICANT MILITARY
MOMENT YET.
