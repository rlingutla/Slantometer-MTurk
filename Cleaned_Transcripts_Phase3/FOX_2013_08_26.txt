THIS IS THE FOX REPORT,
TONIGHT, OF THE EVIDENCE OF
A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
IN SYRIA IS UNDENIABLE.

THAT FROM SECRETARY OF
STATE JOHN KERRY.

NOW, HE SAYS THERE MUST BE
CONSEQUENCES.

IST WARSHIPS IN STRIKING
DISTANCE OF SYRIA.

UNITED STATES IS LOOKING
AT ALL OPTIONS.

PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES
THERE MUST BE
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE
WHO WOULD USE THE WORLD'S
MOST HEINOUS WEAPONS NOW
SYRIA IS THREATENING TO
STRIKE BACK AS UNITED
NATIONS INSPECTORS DODGE
SNIPER FIRE AT THE SCENE OF
A POSSIBLE CHEMICAL ATTACK.

FOUR U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS
ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SYRIA
TO LAUNCH A MISSILE STRIKE
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM
PENTAGON OFFICIALS.

DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK
HAGEL SAYS THE U.S. IS
LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS TO
RESPOND TO A SUSPECTED
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA
THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
INCLUDING CHILDREN.

BUT HE SAYS THE U.S. WILL
NOT GO IT ALONE IF THERE IS
ANY ACTION TAKEN IT WILL
BE IN CONCERT WITH
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND
WITHIN FRAMEWORK OF LEGAL
JUSTIFICATION.

JOHN KERRY SAYS EVIDENCE
IS REAL AND COMPELLING, HE
SAYS THERE MUST BE
CONSEQUENCES.


JOHN, THAN THE U.N.
WEAPON
INSPECTORS ARE IN SYRIA.

BUT U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE
ALREADY MADE THEIR OWN
CONCLUSIONS.

YEAH, THEY MAY HAVE
DECIDED TO DO THAT JON,
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE
DIFFICULTY THOSE YATIONS
WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE
FACED IN DOING THEIR JOB
INSIDE SYRIA.

TODAY FOR INSTANCE THEIR
CONVOY LEFT HOTEL IN
CENTRAL DAMASCUS TO HEAD TO
THE SIGHT OF THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK FOR THE
FIRST TIME AND THE CONVOY
WAS FIRED ON BY AT LEAST
ONE SNIPER.

ONE VEHICLE WAS HIT.

NO INJURIES REPORTED.

AND THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS
DID THEN GO ON TO THE
HOSPITAL WHERE THEY
INTERVIEWED SOME OF THE
ALLEGED VICTIMS OF THE
ATTACK AND SOME DOCTORS WHO
HAD TREATED THEM.

BUT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN
KERRY WAS QUICK TO POINT
OUT TODAY THAT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
ANYTHING BUT HELPFUL TO
THOSE INSPECTORS.

INSTEAD FOR FIVE DAYS THEY
REFUSED INVESTIGATORS TO
THE SITE OF THE ATTACK THAT
WOULD ALLEGEDLY EXONERATE
THEM.

INSTEAD IT ATTACKED THE
AREA FURTHER SHELLING IT
AND SYSTEMATICALLY
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

THAT'S NOT THE BEHAVIOR OF
A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS
NOTHING TO HIDE.

NOW, THERE IS NO
INDICATION AT THIS MOMENT
WHEN THOSE UNITED NATIONS
INSPECTORS MIGHT LEAVE
SYRIA FOR ANYONE READING
THE TEA LEAVES THAT ACT
MIGHT BE ANOTHER IMPENDING
MILITARY ACTION.

PRESIDENT ASAN AS
DEFIANT AS EVER?

IT SEEMS THAT WAIT A
MINUTE HE SAT DOWN
APPARENTLY FOR INTERVIEW
WITH THE RUSSIAN DAILY
NEWSPAPER.

THE STILL PHOTOGRAPHS OF
THAT INTERVIEW WERE
RELEASED BY STATE RUN
SYRIAN MEDIA WE CANNOT
INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THEM.

IN THE INTERVIEW PRESIDENT
ASSAD SAID QUOTE  THINK
MEANING THE UNITED STATES
CAN START A WAR BUT THEY
WILL NOT KNOW WHERE IT WILL
SPREAD OR HOW IT WILL END.

ASKED HOW HE BELIEVES IT
MIGHT END FOR THE U.S., HE
SAID WHAT IT SUFFERED IN
ALL ITS WARS FROM VIETNAM
UNTIL NOW FAILURE.

THOSE QUOTES APPEAR TO BE
AFFIRMATION OF WHAT WE HAVE
SAID MANY TIMES HERE BEFORE
RK JON THAT LONG AGO
PRESIDENT ASSAD DECIDED HE
WILL FIGHT TO WHAT WILL
INEVITABLY BE A BITTER AND
BLOODY END.

MENTIONED U.S.
WARSHIPS ARE
READY TO STRIKE AT SYRIA AT
ANY MOMENT.

AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN IS
CALLING FOR MORE THAN JUST
A MISSILE LAUNCH.

WE WILL WILL GO LIVE TO THE
WHITE HOUSE FOR THE LATEST
ON THE MILITARY OPTIONS
COMING UP ON "THE FOX
REPORT."

THE NEWS OUT OF SYRIA HURT
YOUR 401(K)S AND IRA'S
TODAY STOCKS SLID IN THE
RED AFTER SOARING EARLIER
THIS THE DAY.

JOHN KERRY SPOKE ABOUT
SYRIA.

IT IS UNDENIABLE, THAT'S
WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE
JOHN KERRY SAID TODAY ABOUT
LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THERE
IS VERY LITTLE DOUBT THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED
THAT ATTACK.

AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IS
CONSIDERING THE OPTIONS FOR
A POSSIBLE MILITARY
RESPONSE.

AS WE REPORTED AT THE TOP
OF THIS NEWSCAST, OFFICIALS
SAY THE U.S. NOW HAS FOUR
WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST OF
SYRIA READY TO STRIKE AT A
MOMENT'S NOTICE.

SO, ED, WHAT IS NEXT FOR
THE PRESIDENT ON THIS
ISSUE?

THESE WERE THE STRONGEST
COMMENTS YET FROM ANYONED
IN THE ADMINISTRATION.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN
KERRY CAME OUT TODAY AND
RATHER DRAMATICALLY
DECLARED THAT IN FACT THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES
THAT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL
ATTACK AND THAT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR IT.

THEY FLATLY DECLARED THAT
AND JOHN KERRY WENT ON TO
TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO HAVE
ACCOUNTABI HINTING AT U.S. MILITARY
ACTION.

WHAT WE SAW IN SYRIA
LAST WEEK SHOULD SHOCK THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD IT.

IT DEFIES ANY CODE OF
MORALITY.

LET ME BE CLEAR.

THE INDISCRIMINATE
SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS, THE
KILLING OF WOMEN AND
CHILDREN AND INNOCENT
BYSTANDERS BIOCHEMICAL
WEAPONS IS IMMORAL
OBSCENITY.

NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT
GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY, THE
CHAIR OF THE JOINT CHIEFS
HAS PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT
WITH ONE PLAN THAT WOULD
INCLUDE GROUND TROOPS,
COULD INCLUDE HALF A
MILLION U.S.

GROUND TROOPS,
BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS.

THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY
OPTION THE PRESIDENT HAS
RULED OUT.

HE SAID PUBLICLY MANY TIMES
HE WOULD NOT COMMIT U.S.

GROUND TROOPS.

THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION
INVOLVING CREWS MISSILES
THAT WOULD BE SHOT FROM
SUBMARINES.

ALSO PRECISION GUIDED
MISSILES.

FIRED FROM AIRPLANES THAT
WOULD BE FLYING BELOW
SYRIAN RADAR.

THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE
TABLE.

IT COULD VERY WELL BE ONE
OF THE OPTIONS THE
PRESIDENT USES JON.

UNDER PRETTY HEAVY PRESSURE
FROM REPUBLICANS TO ACT.

THAT'S RIGHT, JON IT WAS
ONE YEAR AGO THIS MONTH AT
A NEWS CONFERENCE HERE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THE
PRESIDENT FIRST DREW THAT
RED LINE FAMOUSLY IN TERMS
OF THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS BY PRESIDENT ASSAD
IN SYRIA.

AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY IN
THE NEXT LINE AT THAT NEWS
CONFERENCE SAID THERE WOULD
BE QUOTE, ENORMOUS
CONSEQUENCES IF THAT LINE
WAS CROSSED.

THAT'S WHY REPUBLICAN JOHN
MCCAIN TODAY DECLARED THE
PRESIDENT BETTER BACK UP
THESE WORDS.

IF THE UNITED STATES
STANDS BY AND DOESN'T TAKE
VERY SERIOUS ACTION.

NOT JUST LAUNCHING CREWS
MISSILES, THEN AGAIN OUR
CREDIBILITY IN THE WORLD IS
DIMINISHED EVEN MORE IF
THERE IS ANY LEFT.

NOW, WHITE HOUSE
SPOKESMAN JAY CARNEY TODAY
REFUSED TO GET INTO ANY
HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT WHAT'S
THE NEXT MOVE FROM THE
PRESIDENT.

THEY OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KEEP
AS MUCH AS THIS BEHIND
CLOSE THE DOORS AS THEY
CAN.

BUT HE DID SAY THAT THERE
WILL BE SOME SORT OF A
RESPONSE THAT IT DEMANDS A
RESPONSE, BUT HE SAID THE
PRESIDENT HAS NOT MADE A
FINAL DECISION YET JON
