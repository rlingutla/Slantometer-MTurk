AN ABC NEWS EXCLUSIVE FROM
OKLAHOMA.

CELLPHONE VIDEO FROM INSIDE AN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THE FURY OF
THE MONSTER TORNADO.

OH, MY GOD!

OH, MY GOD!

OH, MY GOD!

A BRAVE HERO TEACHER.

SHE TELLS DAVID MUIR HOW THEY
ALL MADE IT OUT.

NOW THE LATEST TONIGHT ON
THE BIG STORY WE'VE BEEN
COVERING THIS WEEK, THE DIRECT
HIT TWISTER OUTBREAK IN
OKLAHOMA.

TONIGHT AN ABC NEWS EXCLUSIVE,
CELLPHONE VIDEO OF WHAT HAPPENED
IN ONE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL
VISIT OKLAHOMA THIS WEEKEND, AND
ABC'S DAVID MUIR LEADS OUR
COVERAGE ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH
THAT EXCLUSIVE.

EVENING, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
TONIGHT WE HEAR AND SEE THE
MOMENT THAT TORNADO HIT ONE OF
THOSE TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

IN THIS CASE, BRIARWOOD
ELEMENTARY.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
TELLING US WINDS WERE MORE THAN
200 MILES PER HOUR AT THAT
POINT.

AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE, AS THAT
TWISTER HOVERED OVER THE SCHOOL,
IT WAS PITCH BLACK, AND
TERRIFYING INSIDE.

THIS IS THE MOMENT THE MONSTROUS
TORNADO HIT BRIARWOOD
ELEMENTARY.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE SEE WHAT
STUDENTS SAW HUDDLED IN THAT
BATHROOM.

COMPLETE DARKNESS.

AND THIS IS WHAT THEY HEARD.

[ WIND AND SCREAMING ]
FROM THE TORNADO TOOK HOLD OF
THAT SCHOOL, THAT BATHROOM, FELT
THE AIR PUSHING DOWN.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

PROMISING IT WOULD END.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

I HATE THIS!

STUDENTS TELL HER, I HATE THIS.

HONEY, IT'S OKAY.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

TEACHER WITH THE WHISTLE, TRYING
TO CALM THE STUDENTS.

KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN!

WOW, OH, MY GOD.

OH, MY GOD.

OH, MY GOD, MY HOUSE.

YOU CAN HEAR THE STUDENTS
DISTRAUGHT.

THEN THEY WALK OUTSIDE.

ONCE OUTSIDE, THE TEACHER, NOW
WORRIED ABOUT TWO OTHER
STUDENTS.

HER SON SAM, A FIRST GRADER, HER
DAUGHTER MARIE IN FOURTH.

AND THEN IN FRONT OF HER, SAM
APPEARS.

IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

ARRIVES.

SAM, THERE'S DADDY.

JOEY, JOEY!

AND HE FINDS HER ALIVE.

JOEY!

ONCE FILLED WITH TEACHERS AND
PARENTS' CARS RIGHT THERE ON THE
RIGHT, EMPTY.

AND LATE TODAY, AUTHORITIES
ALLOWING US TO BRING HER BACK TO
THAT SCHOOL.

AS WE WALK TOWARD IT, THE FIRST
THING WE NOTICE, THE MANGLED
PLAYGROUND.

OH, THERE'S OUR PLAYGROUND.

PLAYGROUND HERE?

THIS IS THE PLAYGROUND.

TEACHER WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE
WHAT SHE WAS SEEING.

THE FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM BACK
IN THE CORNER THERE, WHERE HER
SON'S TEACHER WAS LYING ON TOP
OF HIM AND THE OTHER CHILDREN,
TO KEEP THEM SAFE.

INCREDIBLE TO THINK HER SON
CRAWLED OUT OF THAT RUBBLE WITH
ALL THOSE FIRST GRADERS, AND
LOOK AT THIS, RIGHT HERE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL, A CAR
LANDING FROM THE PARKING LOT.

JUST BEYOND THAT CAR, SHE TAKES
ME UNDERNEATH THE TWISTED METAL,
DOWN THE HALLWAYS, ALL THAT'S
LEFT OF THE SCHOOL.

AMONG THE ONLY WALL STANDING,
THAT BRICK WALL TO THE BATHROOM
WHERE HER CLASS WAS SAVED.

THIS IS WHERE WE WALKED DOWN,
AND I WAS RIGHT HERE.

WERE HERE TODAY TOURING THE
DAMAGE, AND AGAIN THE QUESTIONS
SURROUNDING THOSE SAFE ROOMS AND
WHY THERE WERE NOT ANY IN EITHER
OF THOSE TWO SCHOOLS.

WE LEARNED IT CAN COST UP TO
$300 A SQUARE FOOT, UP TO A
MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE TO BL
THE SAFE ROOMS, BUT A LOT OF
PARENTS BELIEVE YOU CAN'T PUT A
PRICE TAG ON SAFETY.

THAT CONVERSATION HAS BEGUN.

ONE MORE DISCOVERY I WANTED TO
SHOW YOU FROM INSIDE THAT
SCHOOL.

WE FOUND THIS TODAY.

HER STUDENTS HAD MADE THIS FOR
HER BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING ON
TO MIDDLE SCHOOL.

THEY HAD JUST THREE DAYS LEFT.

SHE SAID SHE'LL CHERISH THIS
PHOTO.

WE'LL GET IT BACK TO HER AFTER
THE BROADCAST.

SO MANY STORIES, BUT THAT WAS
TRULY STUNNING.

TONIGHT THERE ARE OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY UNDER THE
THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER.

WE'LL SHOW YOU THE MAP WITH THE
NEW SYSTEM SWEEPING IN FROM THE
WEST.

FROM BOSTON TO D.C., AS FAR WEST
AS CLEVELAND, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
TOLD TO BRACE FOR HIGH WINDS,
HAIL, AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
OF A TORNADO.

 THIS WEEK WE WATCHED ABC'S
MIKE BOETTCHER, WALK THE STREETS
IN OKLAHOMA, HIS HOME STATE.

NOW HE'S GOING TO TELL US WHY
200-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS CANNOT
SHAKE SOMETHING HE LOVES --
THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE AT
HOME.

MILE IN FRONT OF SUNDAY'S
VIOLENT STORM, WATCHING YET
ANOTHER TORNADO PLOW THROUGH RED
DIRT AND THE HOUSES BUILT ON IT,
I SILENTLY WONDERED "WHY DO I
LIVE HERE?"

THE ANSWER IS ROOTED IN DUST --
I'M AN OKIE.

THE O WORD WAS EQUIVALENT TO A
DUST BOWL.

BUT OKIES, LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC
SUPERSTAR TOBY KEITH, A MOORE
NATIVE, WHO STILL LIVES HERE,
NOW DEFINE OKIE WITH WORDS LIKE
RESILIENT AND TOUGH.

JUST PERSISTENT, TENACIOUS
WILL TO SURVIVE AND CALL THIS
HOME.

THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE THEIR
POSSESSIONS.

THEY'RE GOING TO BOARD THEIR
HOUSE UP.

NOT BE A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRY
BABIES.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

IT'S JUST NOT -- THESE PEOPLE
ARE JUST GOING TO BE TOUGH, GET
UP AND GET IT DONE.

PROVED AFTER THE 1999 MOORE
TORNADO.

AND THE 1995 OKLAHOMA CITY
BOMBING.

EVEN NEWCOMERS LIKE NBA STAR
KEVIN DURANT TAKE PRIDE IN OKIE
RESILIENCE.

WE'LL COME TOGETHER AND
BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.

YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH RIGHT NOW,
BUT THE SUN WILL SHINE SOON.

SUPERSTARS AND ANONYMOUS VICTIMS
ALIKE.

WE'VE DONE IT ONCE ALREADY.

WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

OKLAHOMANS ARE STRONG.

YEAH.

GENERATION PUT TO MUSIC.

♪ CAN YOU HEAR THIS SONG

NEWS.

MOORE, OKLAHOMA.
