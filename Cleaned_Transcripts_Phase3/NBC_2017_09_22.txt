HEART-POUNDING RESCUES
AND NEW EVACUATIONS AS
FLOODWATERS RISE IN
PUERTO RICO.

THE ENTIRE ISLAND
STILL WITHOUT POWER.

TONIGHT THE URGENT
RELIEF MISSION UNDER
WAY.

NOW TO PUERTO RICO
WHERE A FAILING DAM
PUSHED PAST THE LIMIT
BY HURRICANE MARIA IS
TRIGGERING NEW FLASH
FLOODS AND EVACUATIONS
TONIGHT.

WHILE POWER OUTAGES
HAVE CRIPPLED
COMMUNICATIONS,
HAMPERING SEARCH AND
RESCUE EFFORTS ACROSS
THE BATTERED AMERICAN
TERRITORY.

IN MANY PLACES THE
FLOODWATERS ARE
RECEDING, BUT MANY
COMMUNITIES ARE STILL
INUNDATED.

THROUGHOUT PUERTO RICO
THERE IS NO POWER, NO
COMMUNICATION AND NO
IDEA HOW LONG IT WILL
TAKE TO RECOVER.

TONIGHT, PUERTO RICO
IS EXHAUSTED.

TOWN AFTER TOWN UNDER
WATER AND UNDER
PRESSURE.

MARIA MAY HAVE PASSED
BUT THE STORM'S
AFTERMATH IS
OVERWHELMING.

IN THE NORTHWEST PART
OF THE ISLAND AN
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
DAM FAILURE IS FORCING
MORE FRANTIC
EVACUATIONS.

IT'S DEVASTATING
BECAUSE YOU LOSE
EVERYTHING.

YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.

YOU HAVE TO START FROM
ZERO.

TOA BAJA, 30 MILES
WEST OF SAN JUAN,
CHRISTOPH ANADOR IS
DESPERATE.

THE WATER FLOODED HER
ENTIRE FIRST FLOOR AND
SHE SAYS THE LOCAL
SHELTER HAS RUN OUT OF
FOOD.

WE NEED GAS, FOOD.

I DON'T KNOW.

TOWN'S MAYOR TELLS US
AT LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE
DROWNED HERE AND
AUTHORITIES HAVE
RESCUED 4,000 TO 5,000
TRAPPED BY
FLOODWATERS.

WITHOUT WORKING CELL
PHONES HE'S
COORDINATING WITH
RESCUE CREWS FROM
FLORIDA AND VIRGINIA
BY WORD OF MOUTH.

IT'S CHAOS.

IT'S CHAOS.

RELEASED BY THE U.S.
COAST GUARD SHOWS A
WOMAN AND TWO CHILDREN
BEING HOISTED TO
SAFETY AFTER THEY WERE
STRANDED ON A CAPSIZED
BOAT OFF THE COAST.

POWER IS OUT TO THE
ENTIRE ISLAND AND 95%
OF CELL SERVICE IS
DOWN.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOW
HIRED MORE THAN 50
SMALL CONTRACTORS TO
HELP GET THINGS UP AND
RUNNING.

ELECTRICAL CREWS
CLEARING DEBRIS BUT
NOT FIXING LINES YET
BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY
CAN'T EVEN COMMUNICATE
WITH HEADQUARTERS.

IT'S A NEW
EXPERIENCE FOR US.

I'M WORKING IN GEORGE
AND I'M WORKING IN
HUGO AND I NEVER SEE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

WORKED MANY HURRICANES
BEFORE BUT YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

STORM IN OLD SAN JUAN
WHILE A BUILDING IN
THIS HISTORIC
NEIGHBORHOOD CRUMBLED
NEXT TO HER.

I SAID TO MYSELF
AND TO MY SON, WE HAVE
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

THIS IS GOING TO
COLLAPSE.

HELP CAN'T COME SOON
ENOUGH.

I'M GADI SCHWARTZ
IN PUERTO RICO, WHERE
THIS HOTEL LOBBY IS
MISSION CONTROL FOR
HUNDREDS OF RESCUERS.

SO THIS AREA IS
STILL SOMEWHAT DARK?

CORRECT.

YEAH.

OF THEM, LIKE THIS
CREW FROM VIRGINIA,
HURRICANE MARIA IS YET
ANOTHER DISASTER IN
WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN
UNRELENTING SEASON OF
CATASTROPHE.

FOLKS HERE HAVE
TAKEN A PRETTY BIG HIT
WITH THESE STORMS.

WE'RE GOING TO DO
WHATEVER WE CAN TO
HELP THEM.

BEEN STRETCHED THIN.

FEMA SUPPORTING MORE
THAN 30,000 PEOPLE IN
DISASTER ZONES.

THE RED CROSS
DEPLOYING MORE THAN
5,000 WORKERS AND
NEARLY ITS ENTIRE
VEHICLE FLEET.

SAMARITAN'S PURSE, A
NORTH CAROLINA
NONPROFIT, RESPONDING
TO THEIR THIRD
HURRICANE IN THE LAST
FEW WEEKS WITH 50,000
POUNDS OF EMERGENCY
SUPPLIES TO PUERTO
RICO.

THE SCENES OF
DEVASTATION AND
SUFFERING STIR AN
OVERWHELMING NEED TO
HELP.

THIS CREW IN SAN JUAN
ARE HEADED TO CHECK ON
A FAMILY WHO HASN'T
BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE
THE STORM.

BUT THEN CONTACT.

AND A SATELLITE PHONE
CALL BACK HOME.

LISA?

I'M OKAY.

BACK-TO-BACK
CALAMITIES --
 THEY CAME, ALL
THESE MOMENTS OF
HUMANITY --
 OKAY, I LOVE YOU.

HELP THEM PERSEVERE.

I'M GLAD WE'RE
ALIVE.
