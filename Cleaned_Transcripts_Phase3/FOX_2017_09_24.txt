PLUS, ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER
ESTATES PUERTO RICO.

PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO USE
THEIR PHONES AFTER HURRICANE
MARIA SLAMMED THE ISLAND.

HAVE TRYING FOR DAYS TO GET
THE TOUCH WITH MY FAMILIES IN
THE UNITED STATES.

HURRICANE MARIA CAUSED
HEAVY DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO
WHERE THE POWER AND PHONE
SERVICE IS STILL OUT FOR MOST
OF THE ISLAND.

NOW A THREAT OF A DAM COLLAPSE
IS FORCING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
FROM THEIR HOME.

SOME OF THE BEST NEWS I CAN
REPORT IS THAT COMMUNICATIONS
ARE SLOWLY RETURNING IN SAN
ONE.

ATT DISPATCHED SOME OF THE
CREWS TO REBUILD AND REPAIR
THE CELL TOWERS HERE IN PUERTO
RICO.

THIS LAST HOUR WE STARTED
GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SIGNAL
ON OUR CELL PHONE WHICH HAD
PREVIOUSLY BEEN NONEXISTENT.

THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE
TOUGHEST, MOST CHALLENGING
PART FOR PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO
AS WELL IS BACK IN THE
STATES.

THAT DISCONNECT, NOT BEING
ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOUR LOVED
ONES AND LET THEM KNOW HOW
YOU'RE DOING.

IN FACT, FOLKS HAVE DRIVEN AS
FAR AS 40 OR 50 MILES TO TRY
TO FIND CELL PHONE SIGNAL TO
BE ABLE TO PLACE A CALL OR
MAKE A TEXT OR JUST SEND THAT
MESSAGE OUT.

ALONG THE HIGHWAY IS ONE OF
THE FEW PLACES THAT HAS
SIGNAL.

YOU CAN SEE LONG LINES OF CARS
STOPPING TO TRY TO CONNECT
WITH THEIR LOVED ONE.

THEY HAVE SLOWLY STARTED TO
COME INTO THE COUNTRY.

FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, AFTER
LOSING THEIR HOME, THE LONG
LINES FOR FUEL, FOOD AND
WATER, ALONG WITH THE PROSPECT
OF GOING MONTHS WITHOUT POWER
IS JUST TOO MUCH AND HUNDREDS
OF THEM ARE NOW TRYING TO FIND
A WAY.

IT'S TERRIBLE.

EVERYONE IS FIGHTING FOR
GASOLINE.

MY HUSBAND GOES OUT AT FOUR IN
THE MORNING EVERY DAY TO GET
GASOLINE FOR THE GENERATOR.

GETS BACK AT TWO OR
300 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
WITH TEN DOLLARS AT THE MOST.

WE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE.

WE CAN SURVIVE THAT WE HAVE A
LITTLE GIRL AND IT'S
COMPLICATED.

THIS IS CRAZY.

IN WESTERN PUERTO RICO, THE
THREAT OF A COLLAPSING DAM HAS
FORCED 8000 PEOPLE TO
EVACUATE.

OFFICIALS SAY THAT DAM COULD
STILL BREAK AT ANY MOMENT.

AFTER RECEIVING MORE RAIN
TODAY, THE NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE EXTENDED A FLASH FLOOD
WARNING UNTIL 815 TONIGHT.

OFFICIALS ACROSS THE TERRITORY
ARE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS
JUST WHAT HOW WIDESPREAD THE
DAMAGES AND HOW BAD IT IS IN
SOME AREAS, PARTICULARLY THOSE
SMALL TOWNS ALONG THE WESTERN
AND SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS
OF THE TERRITORY WHERE THE
STORM REALLY DAMAGED
SEVERELY.

THEY ARE TRYING TO REESTABLISH
COMMUNICATION THERE.

TODAY THE GOVERNOR SAID THE
DEATH TOLL REMAINED AT TEN.

THAT NUMBER COULD STILL RISE
AS THE INDICATIONS ARE
REESTABLISHED.

THIS WEEKEND PUERTO RICO
CONGRESSWOMAN SAID FEMA
ADMINISTRATOR AS WELL AS
FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO
WILL BE MAKING THEIR WAY TO
THE ISLAND TOMORROW TO SURVEY
THE DAMAGE FOR THEMSELVES.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID HE
PLANS TO VISIT THE ISLAND.

NO DATE OR TIME HAS BEEN
SCHEDULED FOR THAT VISIT.
