A DIRE CRISIS GROWING IN PUERTO
RICO AFTER HURRICANE MARIA
DEVASTATING THAT ISLAND LEAVING
MILLIONS WITHOUT POWER AND NOW
OFFICIALS ARE RACING AGAINST THE
CLOCK TO SAVE RESIDENCE FROM A
FAILING DAM.

PLUS, WE ARE TRACKING HURRICANE
MARIA'S DEADLY PATH AND WE WILL
TELL YOU WHERE THE STORM IS
HEADED NEXT.

RICK NEARLY THE ENTIRE ISLAND
OF PUERTO RICO IS WITHOUT POWER
AFTER GETTING BY HURRICANES IRMA
AND MARIA.

THERE IS A BIGGER ISSUE.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
LIVING DOWNSTREAM FROM A FAILING
DAM ARE NOW UNDER EVACUATION
ORDERS.

OFFICIALS SAY THE DAM IS ON THE
VERGE OF COLLAPSE UNABLE TO
HANDLE THE WEIGHT OF THOSE HEAVY
FLOODWATERS.

REPORTER HERE IN THE FAR
NORTHWEST OF PUERTO RICO A VERY
BAD SITUATION COULD GET MUCH
WORSE SOON.

THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS THAT THE
MAJOR DAM COULD BREAK.

THERE IS ALREADY 15-20 FEET OF
FLOODING AND THEY HAVE EVACUATED
70000 PEOPLE IN FEAR THAT THIS
COULD BE A CATASTROPHE.

THIS IS SO FLOODED THAT YOU HAVE
TO GUESS WHAT IS WHERE.

THERE ARE HOUSES UNDERNEATH THE
SATELLITE DISHES AND THE WATER
IS OVER THE HOUSES.

WE ARE PASSING OVER FOR
VEHICLES.

TO MY LEFT OVER HERE IS THE MAIN
STREET OF THIS REGION AND IT IS
COMPLETELY UNDERWATER

UP AHEAD IS THE POLICE STATION.

YOU CAN'T SEE THAT EITHER.

IT IS GUESSWORK WHERE THINGS ARE
AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
TEN-15 FEET OF FLOODWATER.

THEY HAD TO EVACUATE PEOPLE BY
SCHOOL BUSES AND THERE IS FEAR
THAT MORE COULD BE COMING.

THEY HAVE ALREADY EVACUATED MORE
THAN 70000 PEOPLE FROM TWO TOWNS
HERE USING SCHOOL BUSES TO TRY
TO FIND HIGHER GROUND.

HURRICANE MARIA CONTINUES TO
ROLL NORTHWOOD AND ADAM IS OF
THE FOX WEATHER CENTER WITH MORE
ON THIS.

A VERY LARGE STORM AND YOU'RE
LOOKING AT A CATEGORY THREE WITH
WINDS UP TO 150 MILES AN HOUR
AND THERE IS YOUR ORIENTATION
AND US COAST.

WE ARE NOW OFF TO THE NORTH AND
EAST OF THE BAHAMAS AS THIS BIG
SYSTEM DOES CONTINUE TO LIVE TO
THE NORTH IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS.

STILL A CATEGORY THREE BUT THE
GOOD NEWS IS IT WILL WEAKEN AS
IT CONTINUES TO MOVE FOLLOWING
DOWN TO A CATEGORY ONE.

LOOK AT THE TAIL END OF THIS
TRACK.

THIS TAKES YOU INTO TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY SO STILL A LITTLE BIT
OF TIME BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLY
WIDE AND THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS
AND HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM AND THE
THINGS THAT AREN'T TOTALLY IN
PLACE SO THERE'S INDECISION AND
THE MODELS IN THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER OF WHERE THIS
WILL GO AND YOU DO NOTICE
PERHAPS THE ONE MODEL IS
BRINGING YOU FAR OVER TO NORTH
CAROLINA OR IT COULD GO WAY OUT
TO SEA.

WE WILL NEED A COUPLE OF DAYS TO
GET AN EXACT IDEA OF WHERE THE
STORM WILL BE IN IT WILL WEAKEN
BUT IT MAY APPROACH THE US
COAST.

THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL PAY
CLOSE ATTENTION TO.

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AS FAR AS
CLOSE AS IT GETS TO THE COAST IT
WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH THAT THAT
RIP CURRENT THOUGHTS WILL BE IN
PLACE UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST
ALL THE WAY NEXT WEEK AND THIS
IS ONE THAT WE WILL BE WATCHING
REALLY CLOSELY TO SEE IF IT WILL
JOG A LITTLE OFF TO THE WEST OR
NOT.
