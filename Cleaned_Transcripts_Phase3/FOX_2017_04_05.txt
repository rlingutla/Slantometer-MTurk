NEWS DECK, A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR
THE UNITED STATES AND A WORLD.

A MAJOR SHIFT FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP HIMSELF THIS AFTERNOON
DURING A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH.

THE PRESIDENT SAID THE LATEST
ACTS OF BARBER AL-ASSAD CAN'T BE
TOLERATED.

THAT ACT ON CHILDREN HAD A
BEEN IMPACT ON ME.

IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING.

I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT AND SEEING
IT.

IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN
THAT.

I HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY, AND
IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE -- AND
I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
HAPPENED -- THAT MY ATTITUDE
TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS
CHANGED VERY MUCH.

IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED, HIS
ATTITUDE AND SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS
CHANGED.

DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED
STATES WILL BECOME FOR ENGAGED
IN THE CONFLICT?

THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT SPECIFIC.

WHEN ADD IN SYRIA'S ACTIONS
CROSSED A RED LINE, HE SAID
THIS.

IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
ME.

WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
INNOCENT BABIES, BABY, LITTLE
BABIES, WITH A CHEMICAL GAS THAT
IS SO LETHAL THAT PEOPLE WERE
SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT GAS IT WAS,
THAT CROSSES MANY, MANY LINES,
BEYOND A RED LINES.

THE BACKGROUND HERE IS
IMPORTANT.

YOU MAY REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA
IN 2012 WARNED THAT BARBER
AL-ASSAD CROSSED A RED LINE
SHOULD HE USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THE DICTATOR DID USE THEM
ANYWAY.

PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED WITH
DIPLOMACY AND STEAD OF MILITARY
ACTION.

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS
CRISIS WHEN HE SET THE RED LINE
IN THE SAND.

WHEN HE DIDN'T CROSS THAT RED
LINE AFTER MAKING THE THREAT,
THAT SET US BACK A LONG WAYS NOT
ONLY IN SYRIA BUT IN MANY OTHER
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

BECAUSE IT WAS A BLANK THREAT.

I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT
WAS NOT ONE OF OUR BETTER DAYS
AS A COUNTRY.

THAT WAS 2012.

AND CITIZEN TRUMP URGED OBAMA
NOT TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.

HE TWEETED THIS.

HE ALSO TWEETED --
SAYS HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.

THAT IT'S NOW HIS
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT HE WILL
ACT.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE
PRESIDENT HAS BLAMED BARBER
AL-ASSAD FOR KILLING HIS OWN
PEOPLE.

YESTERDAY THE ATTACK WAS
LAUNCHED KILLING DOZENS OF
PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN ASLEEP
IN THEIR BEDS.

RUSSIA HAS BLAMED IT ON THE
SYRIAN REBELS.

THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED
STATES.

OFFICIALS IN MOSCOW SAYS A
SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A WEAPONS
DUMP THAT RELEASED THE DEADLY
CHEMICALS.

THIS SORT OF THING HAS BEEN
HAPPENING FOR YEARS.

THE SYRIAN DICTATOR'S BARREL
BOMBS HAVE KILLED TENS OF
THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS
INCLUDING WOMEN AND BABIES IN
THEIR BEDS.

THAT TOO IS A WAR CRIME.

BUT IT'S A HORRIFIC VIDEO THAT
THE PRESIDENT SAID CHANGED HIS
MINDS AND THE NATION'S POLICY
TOWARDS THIS CONFLICT.

WE HAVE NO WAY TO KNOW WHETHER
THE PRESIDENT WAS SIGNALLING AN
IMMEDIATE MILITARY RESPONSE.

OF THIS WE'RE SURE.

THE SYRIAN REGIME IS BACKED BY
THE RUSSIANS.

THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH
THEM AS ARE IRANIANS.

SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENTER
THIS CONFLICT, SUPPORTING
MILITARILY THE REBELS, FIGHTING
AGAINST THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD BE
FIGHTING THE RUSSIANS AND THE
IRANIANS.

HE WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY AND
CAREFULLY NOT SO.

HE'S BEEN STUDIOUSLY
NONSPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE
WILL TAKE ACROSS THE WORLD.

HE'S BEEN VERY STUDIOUS SAYING
TOO OFTEN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS TELEGRAPHING
WHAT SORT OF ACTION THEY WOULD
TAKE.

HE GOES BACK TO MOSUL.

THEY TELEGRAPHED WHAT THEY WOULD
DO IN MOSUL TELLING LEADERS WHAT
THEY WOULD DO TO DIG IN OR GET
OUT.

IT'S CLEAR THIS ATTACK YESTERDAY
IN SYRIA HAS HAD A PROFOUND
IMPACT ON THE PRESIDENT.

HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMAGES OF
LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE BABIES
DYING AND SUFFERING HORRIBLY IN
THE WAKE OF IN GAS ATTACK.

SAYING THAT IT HAS CROSSED A
NUMBER OF LINES, NOT JUST A RED
LINE, AND IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR
THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE SOME
SORT OF ACTION IN THE WAKE OF
ALL OF THIS.

TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE STRIDENT
TERMS THAT HE HAS BEEN, BUT
BEING DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS
ABOUT WHAT THE UNITED STATES'
RESPONSE MIGHT BE.

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE
NOTICED ABOUT ME IS MILITARILY,
I DON'T LIKE TO SAY WHERE I'M
GOING, WHAT I'M DOING.

I WATCHED ATTACK ADMINISTRATIONS
SAYING WE WILL ATTACK SUCH AND
SUCH A DAY AND SUCH AND SUCH AN
HOUR.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING ONE
THING.

I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU, AS
MUCH AS I RESPECT YOU.

THIS COULD BE A GAME CHANGER
IN THE POSTURE TOWARDS SYRIA.

THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THAT
REGIME CHANGE WAS NOT A
PARTICULAR PRIORITY FOR THE U.S.
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
MAY BE CHANGING HIS MIND, IF NOT
ON REGIME CHANGE, AT LEAST IN
THE UNITED STATES APPROACH TO
AL-ASSAD.

IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A POWERFUL
ALLY WITH THE KING OF JORDAN
STANDING AT THE PRESIDENT'S
STRIDE WHO IS STRIDENT IN HIS
CONDEMNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN
SYRIA.

AND THE PRESENCE OF KING
ABDULLAH GAVE THIS MORE GRAVITY.

SPEAKING ON A WORLD STAGE AND
CERTAINLY ON LIVE TELEVISION.

WHEN YOU CAN CONSIDER WHAT THE
OPTICS OF THIS ARE, JORDAN, THE
UNITED STATES, SYRIAN REBELS
AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND
IRANIANS.

THAT'S WORLD WAR DEFINED.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT IN FROM THE
30,000 FOOT LEVEL, IT'S CLEAR
WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE LAST HOUR
AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A
PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYTHING
GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID IN THE
PAST, AS A CANDIDATE AND AS
PRESIDENT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH
REGIME CHANGE.

THIS IS PURSUED BY.

PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM.

WHEN YOU HAVE A REGIME CHANGE,
YOU WIND UP IN A WORSE SPOT THAN
YOU DID BEFORE EXACTING A CHANGE
AT THE TOP.

HE SAID WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
FIGHTING IN SYRIA?

WE DON'T FLOW WHO THEY ARE.

WHILE THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS
APPROACH TO BASSER AL-ASSAD, IT
SHOWS HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TRUST
OF THE PLAYER THERE'S IN SYRIA.

UNCLEAR WHAT HE WILL DO.

IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WE'RE TO
TAKE HIM LITERALLY AND
SERIOUSLY, SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR
FOREIGN POLICY SHIFT.

IF HE IS INDEED CHANGING THE
WAY HE VIEWS ASSAD AND CHANGING
FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN
MULTIPLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING THAT IT
WAS NO LONGER A U.S.

PRIORITY TO
GET RID OF ASSAD IN SYRIA, THAT
WOULD BE A MAJOR SHIFT.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET FROM
TRUMP, WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT.

THAT IS WHY THIS IS SUCH A
DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIM.

IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR
OVERSEAS CRISES THAT HE'S HAD TO
DEAL WITH AND THE FIRST TIME
HE'S HAD TO TRANSLATE THE TOUGH
TALK ABOUT DEALING WITH
ADVERSARIES AND DEALING WITH
DIFFICULT DECISIONS INTO ACTUAL
ACTION.

WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING ALREADY
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT
ARE LOOKING TO THE U.S. FOR
LEADERSHIP.

ONE TO KNOW IF THIS IS A SIGNAL
OF A MILITARY RESPOND THE U.S.

CONSIDERING AS NIKKI HALEY
SEEMED TO SUGGEST AT THE
SECURITY COUNCIL OR IF IT'S
GOING TO BE MORE RHETORIC THAT
DOESN'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.

TRUMP VERY RELUCTANT TO SHOW ANY
LEG ON THAT AT THE WHITE HOUSE
TODAY.

REPORTING, HUGH WOULD A
STATEMENT LIKE THIS IN THAT
SETTING, ACCOMPANIED BY THAT
WORLD LEADER, BE RECEIVED IN
TEHRAN, MOSCOW, DAMASCUS?

I THINK WITH SOME UN
CERTAINTY.

PEOPLE ARE HEARTENED TO HEAR THE
PRESIDENT SO FORCEFULLY, TALKING
IN EMOTIONAL TERMS ABOUT THE
VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK.

BUT TALK IS TALK.

REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE
IS THERE GOING TO BE A
DIFFERENCE FROM THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION IN WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENS ON THE GROUND.

IS THE U.S.

GOING TO TRY TO
STRIKE ASSAD TO DEAL WITH HIS
ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE
ATTACKS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED,
HE'S BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO FIRE
THE U.S.

IN CONFLICTS IN THE
MIDDLE EAST BUT HE HAS SAID HIS
VIEW HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

IT'S EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER THIS
WILL AFFECT HOW TRUMP IS
AFFECTING THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA
AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN SYRIA,
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID
IS HIS TOP PRIORITY.

WHAT DOES THIS SIGNAL TO YOU AND
HOW WOULD THIS SIGNAL BE
RECEIVED IN YOUR MIND IN THOSE
CAPITOLS OF DAMASCUS, MOSCOW AND
BEYOND?

THERE ARE WAYS FOR.

TRUMP TO BE VERY TOUGH ON ASSAD
WITHOUT CHANGING HIS PREVIOUS
POLICY.

I AGREE WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT
YOU WERE JUST ENGAGED IN WITH
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS ON
WHETHER TRUMP HAS TAKEN A WHOLE
NEW PERSPECTIVE ON ASSAD.

CLEARLY HE HAS.

BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN HE NEEDS TO
MAKE ASSAD THE FOCUS OPEN
AMERICAN REGIME CHANGE.

WE HAVE ATTEMPTED THAT FOR SIX
YEARS.

IT HASN'T WORKED.

WE'VE HAD THAT AS OUR FORMAL
POLICY SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA
ARTICULATED THAT IN 2007.

WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD SAY,
I WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFE
HAVENS THAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT.

TURN THEM INTO AUTONOMOUS PARTS
OF SYRIA OVER TIME AND HELP THE
REGIONS IF WE EVER GET TO A
PEACEFUL PERIOD TO HELP
RECONSTRUCT THEMSELVES, HE
DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY MONEY
OR DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT AND HOPE
THAT SOME OTHER PROCESS PUSHES
HIM OUT OF POWER.

THAT MAY NOT WORK ANY TIME SOON
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UN PRECEDE
PRECEDENTED.

LIKE SERBIA AND BOSNIA AND
KOSOVO.

WE DID NOT MAKE REGIME CHANGE A
FOREIGN POLICY GOAL.

HIS OWN PEOPLE UNSEEDED HIM AND
ENDED UP IN A WAR TIMES TRIAL
BEFORE HIS DEATH.

THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO
THINK THIS THROUGH THAT ALLOW
YOU TO BE TOUGH ON ASSAD AND
KNOW IT'S TOUGH TO OVERTHROW
HIM.

WHAT HAS CHANGED.

IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE
SYRIAN REGIMES TO USE BARREL
BOMBS TO KILL BABIES IN THEIR
BEDS BY THE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS IN WHAT IS
UNQUESTIONABLY A SERIES OF WAR
CRIMES.

NOW THERE'S VIDEO OF THIS AS
HORRIFIC AS IT IS, THERE IS NO
CHANGE IN ACTION AND ATTITUDE.

THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A
THEME.

I AGREE WITH THAT 100%.

I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS
THE EDUCATION OF AN AMERICAN
PRESIDENT.

ALL OF US HAS BEEN HARDENED BY
THE WARS OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO
THE POINT THAT IT WAS EASIER TO
FRANKLY TURN OFF THE TELEVISION
AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THESE
TRAGEDIES BECAUSE WE BEGAN TO
DOUBT IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THEM ANYWAY.

OF COURSE, FOR MANY REPUBLICANS,
IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
POLICIES THAT WERE CAUSING THE
PROBLEMS PREVIOUSLY.

WE'VE HEARD SEAN SPICER SAY THAT
THIS WEEK.

BUT TODAY OR YESTERDAY,
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO CONFRONT
THIS VISUAL BEFORE HIS OWN EYES
ON HIS WATCH.

I THINK IT'S GOT TO FEEL
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN
THAT OVAL OFFICE THAN IT WOULD
HAVE EVER FELT AS A CONSUMER OF
THE NECESSARY.

THAT'S WHAT'S CHANGED.

IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH MR. TRUMP
HIMSELF HAS BECOME ENGAGED IN
THE WHOLE PROCESS.

I APPRECIATE IT.
