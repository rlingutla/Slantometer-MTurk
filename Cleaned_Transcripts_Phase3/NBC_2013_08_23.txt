READY TO STRIKE?

THE BIG DEBATE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE OVER WHAT TO DO ABOUT
SYRIA.

A DOCTOR ON THE FRONT LINES
THERE TELLING US WHAT HE SAYS
IS REALLY GOING ON.

THERE IS WORD TONIGHT THE
PENTAGON IS DRAWING UP MILITARY
OPTIONS TO RESPOND TO THIS
WEEK'S ATROCITIES IN SYRIA, AS
THE WHITE HOUSE COMES UNDER
INCREASING PRESSURE TO ACT.

THOSE HORRIBLE IMAGES OF
LIFELESS CIVILIANS KILLED BY
WHAT THE REBELS SAY WERE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
HAS SPARKED INTERNATIONAL
OUTRAGE.

AS THE U.S. OFFICIALS ARE TRYING
TO CONFIRM THE NATURE OF THE
ATTACK, NBC NEWS HAS SPOKEN TO
ONE OF THE DOCTORS ON THE GROUND
TREATING THE VICTIMS.

HE SAYS THE WORLD IS IGNORING
THEM.

CHUCK, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN.

IS AMERICA ABOUT TO GET INVOLVED
IN SYRIA?

LOOKS LIKE IN SOME FORM.

THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE
LEANING EVERY ON SENDING SOME
SORT OF STRIKE.

THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES THAT
MILITARY OPTION LOOK LIKE?

RIGHT NOW THAT'S UNCLEAR AND THE
PRESIDENT'S CLOSEST ADVISERS
ARE DIVIDED ON THE OPTIONS THAT
ARE IN FRONT OF THEM.

IT IS THESE HEART-WRENCHING
IMAGES OUT OF SYRIA,
LIFELESS BODIES, MANY OF THEM
CHILDREN, ALLEGEDLY
VICTIMS OF BRUTAL CHEMICAL
WEAPON ATTACKS THAT ACCELERATED
THE DEBATE IN WASHINGTON.

WE ARE RIGHT NOW GATHERING
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR EVENT.

WHAT WE HAVE SEEN INDICATES THAT
THIS IS CLEARLY A BIG EVENT OF
GRAVE CONCERN.

BECOMING MORE CLEAR TONIGHT.

ANN CURRY SPOKE WITH A DOCTOR
INSIDE SYRIA TREATING SOME OF
THOSE VICTIMS.

FEARING FOR HIS OWN LIFE, HE
WOULD NOT GO ON CAMERA.

DIED VIOLENTLY WHILE SLEEPING
AND DIED HUNGRY.

DOCTOR, AFTER THIS
EXPERIENCE, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE
TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD?

CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A SHAME
ON THE FACE OF HUMANITY.

I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CANNOT
DO ANYTHING EXCEPT MEETING AND
PROMISING.

IS THIS THE TRUTH?

IS THIS REAL?

CONSIDERING A VERY NARROW RANGE
OF MILITARY OPTIONS.

BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR A NO-FLY
ZONE, BOTH ARE OUT OF THE
QUESTION.

WHAT IS ON THE TABLE, LIMITED
AIR STRIKES, MOST LIKELY CRUISE
MISSILES LAUNCHED FROM NAVY
DESTROYERS TARGETING
KEY ASSAD MILITARY
COMMAND POSTS AND WHILE THE U.S.
AND WHILE THE U.S.
IS STILL GATHERING EVIDENCE,
EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.

THIS IS QUITE POWERFUL AND
CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS
NOT BEEN FAKED.

RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT
SAID REPEATEDLY THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY BASHAR
AL ASSAD WOULD CROSS THE RED
LINE.

AND IT IS THE PUBLIC PLEDGE
COUPLED WITH THE HORRIFIC
PICTURES THAT PROMPTED SENIOR
OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER SPECIFIC
MILITARY RESPONSES, EVEN AS THE
PRESIDENT PREACHES CAUTION.

SOMETIMES WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
IS THAT FOLKS WILL CALL FOR
IMMEDIATE ACTION, JUMPING INTO
STUFF THAT DOES NOT TURN OUT
WELL.

WHEN DOES THE UNITED STATES,
WITH VERY LITTLE COST, STAND UP
FOR THESE PEOPLE?

OFFICIAL TOLD NBC'S JIM
MIKLASZEWSKI, IF THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO SEND A MESSAGE, WE ARE
GOOD AT SENDING MESSAGES.

BUT IF HE WANTS REGIME CHANGE,
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
EASILY.

KEY PRESIDENTIAL AIDES ARE SPLIT
OF HOW TO RESPOND.

AS THE INTERNAL DEBATE
ABOUT SYRIA HAS
DEVELOPED OVER MONTH,
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
SUSAN RICE AND
AGGRESSIVE ACTION.

DEMPSEY EXPRESSED RELUCTANCE.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
INITIALLY AGGRESSIVE AND
SOFTENED UNTIL THE LATEST
PICTURES EMERGED AND TODAY IS
ADVOCATING AN AGGRESSIVE
RESPONSE.

BUT NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL THERE
ARE TWO THINGS THAT ARE
DETERMINED.

NUMBER ONE, THAT THE U.S. GETS
ACTUAL PROOF THAT ASSAD USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND,
SECOND, THEY NEED TO HAVE A
LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.

LESTER, FOR INSTANCE, IN LIBYA,
THERE WAS A U.N. RESOLUTION TO
ENFORCE.

HERE IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW, THERE
IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ON THE
TABLE.
