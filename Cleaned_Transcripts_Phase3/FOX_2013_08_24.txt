TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT WRAPPING
UP A MEETING WITH THE NATIONAL
SECURITY TEAM ABOUT ALLEGATIONS
ABOUT THE RED LINE CROSSED
AGAIN.

NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE FLOOD
OF REFUGEES LEAVING THAT COUNTRY
AND ACCUSATIONS.

WABASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME IS USING
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO
ATTACK OUT ITS OWN CITIZENS.

AND THE PENTAGON SENDING
A MESSAGE.

THE TOP BRASS SUGGESTING THAT
THE U.S. MILITARY IS READY TO
ACT ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE IN
SYRIA.

HOW WILL THE UNITED STATES
RESPOND TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA
THAT HAS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
POURING OVER THE BORDERS TRYING
TO ESCAPE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE
THAT THEIR COUNTRY HAS BECOME.

IT COULD CREATE NOW HAVENS FOR
TERRORIST AND AMERICAN NATIONAL
SECURITY TIME TALKED ABOUT THE
NEXT STEP AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT
IS UNFOLDING, PICTURES THAT ARE
SO HARD TO LOOK AT AND
IMPOSSIBLE TO AUNTICATE AND SEEM
TO GO ALONG WITH CHEMICAL
ATTACKS IN SYRIA.

AND MORE ON THE HIGH LEVEL
MEETING FOR YOU.

AND FIRST A DEADLY GAME OF BACK
AND FORTH PLAYED OUT AT THIS
HOURED IN OF SYRIA.

THEY ARE ACCUSING THE ANTI-
GOVERNMENT REBELS OF USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND OTHERS CALL
THAT A THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT
FROM THE NERVE GAS ASSAULT ON
A NEIGHBORHOOD THEY SAY.

DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL
ASKED THE PENTAGON TO PREPARE
MILITARY OPTIONS FOR SYRIA AND
THAT REQUIRES POSIINGING OUR
FORCES.

WE KNOW A FOURTH WARM SHIP ARMED
WITH BALLISTIC MISSILES HAS BEEN
IS NOT TO THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.

AND THE CHIEF IS THERE TO URGE
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW
UNITED NATION'S EXPERTS TO LOOK
AT CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACKS.

AID GROUPS SAID THROW 55 PEOPLE
WERE KILLED AND SOME HAVE THE
NUMBER MUCH HIGHER AND IF
CONFIRMED IT WOULD BE THE
WOFRSOUS OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
SINCE SADDAM HUSSEIN GASSED
CURDS.

THE CIVIL WAR AND ESTIMATES PUT
IT AT MORE THAN 100,000.

A YEARING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA
SAID CHEMICAL WEAPON USED IN
SYRIA WOULD BE CROSSING A RED
LINE.

PRESIDENT CONFERRED WITH
ANOTHER WORLD LEADER ON SYRIA.

HE SPOKE WITH BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER DAVID CAMERON ABOUT THE
POSSIBLE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK.

THEY EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERN AND
AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER AND WITH
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO
FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESPOND.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GETTING
REPORTS FROM THE U.S.
ENTELEIGENCE COMMUNITY WHICH
ACCORDING TO THE WHITE WHITE
TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHAT
HAPPENED IN SYRIA AND WAITING TO
HEAR FROM A UNITED NATION'S TEAM
IN SYRIA BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
MAKES A DECISION ON HOW THE U.S.
WILL RESPOND.

IN THE MOAN TIME DEFENSE
SECRETARY CHUCK HAGEL TOLD
REPORTERS THAT THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY
TO PROVIDE THE PRESIDENT WITH
OPTIONS FOR ALL CONTINGENCY AND
THAT REQUIRES POSITIONING OUR
FORCES AND ASSETS TO BE ABLE FOR
THE PRESIDENT TO CHOOSE.

AND HARRIS, THE U.S. HAS FOUR
WAR SHIPS IN THE REGION, HARRIS.

IT IS AWFULLY DIFFICULT WHEN
WE ARE NOT BEGIN INFORMATION OR
NOTES TO KNOW WHETHER AND THIS
IS A QUESTION, DOES THIS MEAN
MILITARY ACTIONS MORE OR LESS
LIKELY AT THIS POINT?

IT CERTAINLY GIVES PRESIDENT
OBAMA MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ORDER
AIR STRIKES OR MISSILE ATTACKS
IF HE DECIDES TO DO.

THAT ONE FORMER UN AMBASSADOR
SAID PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS TO
DECIDE THE OBJECTIVES WITH SYRIA
AND ITS GOVERNMENT AND STOCK
POIL OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THE PRESIDENT SAID HIMSELF
A YEAR AGO THAT THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD CROSS
A REDLINE AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES MAKES
A STATEMENT LIKE THAT, HE NEEDS
TO BE PREPARED TO DO MANAGE
DRAMATIC IF THE REDLINE IS
CROSSED.

OTHERWISE HIS CREDIBILITY IS
GRAVELY DAMAGED AND THAT'S WHERE
WE ARE AT THE MOMENT.

BUT BOLTON BELIEVES THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION WILL TRY TO
INDICT THE SYRIAN REGIME IN THE
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.

MOLLY, ON THE STORY ON WHICH
WE HAVE SEEN MOVEMENT SO MUCH.

COMING UP INSIDE OF THE FOX
REPORT RETIRED FOUR STAR GENERAL
AND JACK KING WILL JOIN US.

MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE WHAT
WE LEARNED FROM MOLLY.

WHAT IS A SERIOUS RESPONSE
LIKELY TO LOOK LIKE?

MOMENTUM IS BUILDING FOR THE
WORLD TO TAKE ACTION IN SYRIA IN
THE WAKE OF NEW ACCUSATIONS OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

PRESIDENT OBAMA RECEIVED WHAT
THEY TELL US IS A DETAILED
REVIEW OF A RANGE OF OPTIONS AND
HOW TO RESPOND.

FORMER ARMY VICE CHIEF WILL JOIN
US LIVE SHORTLY.

A LOT TO ASK ABOUT THIS HOUR.

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
NEXT STEP IN SYRIA LOCKS LIKE.

THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
TALKED ABOUT A SHORT TIME AGO
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

THEIR MEETING AFTER A REPORT
THAT SYRIA'S GOVERNMENT
AGAINOUSED DEADLY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ON HIS CHILDREN.

WE CAN'T AUTHTENTICATE IT, WE
CAN'T WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT
OR ROLE.

BUT THEY DO SUPPORT REPORTS THAT
A SUBURB OF DAMASCUS WAS HIT
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE UNITED
STATES IS TRYING TO CONFIRM THE
REPORT.

ONCE THE FACTS ARE CLEAR
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL MAKE
A DECISION TO RESPOND.

WE HAVE A FORMER VICE CHIEF OF
STATE AND CHAIRMAN.

I COULDN'T SAY THE WORD BUT I
THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE MEAN.

THE PICTURES ARE HARD TO VIEW,
BUT IF WE CAPTAIN DETERMINE,
GENERAL, WHERE THE TRUTH LIES,
WHETHER IT IS THE GOVERNMENT OR
REBELS BLAMED FOR THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, WHAT SHOULD OUR
MILITARY MOVE BE?

I THINK WE CAN DETERMINE.

IT THE PRESIDENT SPOKE BY THE
EXPERIENCE HIS PREDECESSOR OVER
THE WMD IN IRAQ AND LACK OF
INACCURATE WILL BOW TO THE UN TO
DO WHAT THEY CAN DO.

ASSAD CAN PUSH BACK ON THE UN
THE WAY SADDAM HUSSEIN HUSSEIN
DID.

THE WAY TO GET THE VERIFICATION
IS THE DOCTORS AND OTHERS
TREATING THE PATIENTS KNOW WHAT
IT IS BY NOW AND ANY DOCTOR
LOOKING AT THE VIDEOS ALSO
KNOWS.

WE KNOW IT IS A CHEMICAL ATTACK
TAKING PLACE.

WHO DID IT IS THE ISSUE THEN?

WE HAVE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES ON
THE GROUND.

THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE MISSION
TO GO AND DO AN INVESTIGATION TO
GET AT THE ROCKETS THAT WERE
FIRED AND WHERE WERE THEY FIRED
FROM AND WITNESSES TO SEE THAT.

YOU CAN'T FOUR ROCKETS IN
A NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOT HAVE THE
PEOPLE PROVIDE TESTIMONY.

IT IS DISCERNIBLE RATHER
QUICKLY.

I WANT TO BE ABLE TO READ
FROM A STATEMENT THAT IS
A FREEDOM FREEDOM IN CANADA AND
ALSO FROM THE PRIME FREEDOM IN
THE UK.

IN THIS MEETING WITH THE
PRESIDENT SHORTLY AFTER PHONE
CALLS WERE MADE AND OTHER
COUNTRIES ARE BEING TALKED TO.

CAN WE PUT WORDS ON THE SCREEN.

SERIOUS RESPONSE ARE BEING
TALKED ABOUT THIS FROM THE
BRITAIN PRIME MINISTER AND
SIGNIFICANT USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WOULD MERIT A SERIOUS
RESPONSE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY AND BOTH HAVE ASKED
OFFICIALS TO EXAMINE ALL OF THE
OPTIONS.

WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE
EXACTLY?

IN TERMS OF OUR OPTIONS,
HARRIS?

LET'S GET INSIDE OF ASSAD'S
HEAD.

HE'S USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST A NEIGHBORHOOD IN
EASTERN DAMASCUS BECAUSE THE
REBELS SEIZED THE NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR A NUMBER OF WEEKS AND
DESPITE AIR POWER AND MILITARY
HE IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN DISLODGING
THEM AND HE USED THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AND HE HAS REASONED
BEGIN HIS INTRODUCTION OF
CHEMICAL WEAPON IN THE PAST AND
NO REACTION TO IT, THAT NUMBER
ONE, THE UNITED STATES WILL
PROBABLY NOT ACT AND NUMBER TWO,
IF THE UNITED STATES DOES ACT, I
BELIEVE THAT ASSAD'S CALCULATION
BELIEVES IT WILL BE A STATEMENT
ATTACK DESIGNED TO RESTORE
PRESIDENTIAL CREDIBILITY THAN AN
ATTACK ON A SIGNIFICANT MILITARY
CAPABILITY THAT IS DESTROYED OR
REDUCED DRAMATICALLY.

THAT IS HIS HEAD AND WHAT HE'S
THINKING ABOUT.

GENERAL, WHAT I KNOW YOU SAID
IN THE PAST.

THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE TONE
A STATEMENT ATTACK AND WHAT YOU
THINK IS REALLY NECESSARY HERE.

WHAT IS THAT DIFFER?

IT IS DRAMATIC.

OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US IS SEIZE
AND SECOWER CHEMICAL STORAGE.

WE HAVE TO TAKE THE INTEGRATED
AIR DEFENSE TO FLY OUR AIR IN
THERE.

AND WE WOULD NOT DO THAT UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCE.

AND SECONDLY WHAT IS AVAILABLE
TO US.

AND MORE LIKELY IS TO STAND OFF
IN THE MED TERRANNIAN AND
SURFACE SHIP SUBMARINE AND USED
PRECISION GUYEDED AMMUNITION IN
SYRIA THAT WILL BE OF VALUE TO
HIM.

I BELIEVE WE SHOULD USE THIS
OPPORTUNITY NOT TO MAKE
A STATEMENT ATTACK BUT ELIMINATE
AND DEGRADE ONE OF HIS MAJOR
CAPABILITIES AND THE FIRST ONE
HE VALUES IS AIR POWER.

THIS IS SIX MAJOR AIR FIELDS AND
TAKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOWN AND
AMMUNITION AND AIRPLANE THEM AND
CREATOR THE RUN AWAY.

AND WE HAVE TO DESTROY THE
INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMMAND AND
CONTROL FOR SOMETIME HE WILL NOT
BE ABLE TO USE AIR POWER AND
THAT IS SOMETHING HE IS NOT
EXPECTING TO HELP HIM FRANKLY.

WHEN WE HAVE GONE DOWN THE
ROAD BEFORE.

WE SEE MISSION CREEP.

WHERE WE GO IN WITH A MISSION
AND KROEP AWAY AND NEXT THING
YOU KNOW, WE ARE THERE TWO
YEARS.

HOW DO WE GET IN AND OUT AND
WHAT IS THE MISSION?

THERE IS NO ENTERTAINING THE
THOUGHT OF BEING ON THE GROUND
WITH OUR TROOPS IS WHERE YOU GET
IN MISSION CREEPS AND MORE
MISSION AND CHALLENGES.

YOU DON'T SEE US GOING IN
FROM THE GROUND AT ALL.

JUST FROM THE AIR.

WE HAVE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
ON THE GROUND AND ANY CONFLICT
OF INTEREST AND NO, WE'LL NOT
PUT ANYBODY IN THE GROUND.

IT WOULD BE CRUISE AND TOMAHAWK
AND STAND OFF.

WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO TAKE OUT
THE INTEGRATED AIR SYSTEM.

WE MAY SHOOT AT THE BATTERIES
AND BE VIRTUALLY VULNERABLE TO
THE AIR SYSTEM AND THE SUCCESS
OF WHAT WE ARE DOING WOULD BE
HIGH.

AND LISTEN, HARRIS, THIS IS THE
SWEET SPOT OF THE UNITED STATES
MILITARY CAPABILITY AND WE KNOW
HOW TO DO IT VERY WELL AND WE
HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST.

WE CAN ABSOLUTELY RENDER
A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO HIM IF WE
CHOOSE TO DO THAT USING HIS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AS A REASON FOR
IT.

WE SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS
POSITION RIGHT NOW.

IF THEY CROSS THE REDLINE BY
USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS WHICH WE
HAVE REPORTS AND PICTURES
PREVIOUSLY AND WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING AFTER THAT THREAT AND
YOU SAY WE DIDN'T HOLD A STRONG
LINE THEN?

YOU KNOW, IT IS SO
FRUSTRATING TO WATCH THIS
HAPPEN.

WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE PRESIDENTS
FROM WORLD WAR II ON DEVELOP THE
HUGE STAT URT OF THE UNITED
STATES IN THE WORLD AND IN TERMS
OF CREDIBILITY AND TRUST AND WE
MAKE A SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THIS IS THE
UNITED STATES AND WE ARE
SQUANDERING IT TO PEOPLE OPENLY
TALK ABOUT THE UNITED STATES
BEING FECKLESS AND THEY HAVE
LOST THEIR WILL ET CETERA.

AND SO CLEARLY WE SHOULD HAVE
ACTED BEFORE IN MY JUDGMENT.

AND I THINK WE PROBABLY WILL ACT
NOW BECAUSE THERE IS CONSENSUS
IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
AND THE PRESIDENT AND
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO
PARTICIPATE ON THIS.

I JUST HOPE WE DO SOMETHING
MILITARY SIING CAN AND NOT JUST
A STATEMENT ATTACK.

THE PENTAGON IS PUTTING THOSE IN
THE REGION AND MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ARE MOVING ACROSS THE
BORDER THERE.

IN FACT, THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN
REFUGEE CHILDREN IS AT 1
MILLION.

I AM WONDERING WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT THE PEOPLE CAUGHT IN THE
MIDDLE?

IS THAT PART OF OUR MISSION,
TOO?

ONLYECTIVELY WAY TO DEAL WITH
THE PROBLEM IS TO CHANGE THE
MOMENTUM IN FAVOR OF THE REBELS
SO THE REGIME CAN TOPPLE AND WE
PROVIDE THE ASHES ASSISTANCE
THAT IS NECESSARY.

WE HAVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND IF
WE LET IT GO ON.

IT WILL GO ON TO 200,000 AND
MULTIMILLIONS OF PEOPLE
DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES WHICH
IS 2 MILLION NOW AND IT WILL
TRIPLE AND ALSO MILLIONS THAT
WILL BE REFUGEES IN A HORRIFIC
SITUATION THAT IS.

AND THE PRESSURE ON JORD AN AND
TURKEY IT IS SIGNIFICANT IF WE
CONTINUE TO LET IT UNFOLD THE
WAY ASSAD WANTS IT TO UNFOLD.

I CAN AUTHTENTICATE YOU ARE THE
REAL DEAL.

WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR
EXPERIENCE.
