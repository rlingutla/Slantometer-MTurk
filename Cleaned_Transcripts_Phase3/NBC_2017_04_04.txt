TONIGHT, CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

CHILDREN GASPING FOR
AIR, ASSAD BLAMED FOR
A GRISLY MASSACRE ON
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

ONE OF THE DEADLIEST
OF ITS KIND IN SYRIA'S
SIX YEARS CIVIL WAR.

AND ANOTHER
TROUBLE SPOT OVERSEAS,
SYRIA, THE WORLD
REACTING WITH HORROR
AND REVULSION TO THE
APPARENT POISON GAS
ATTACK THAT KILLED
DOZENS OF CIVILIANS
AND SICKENED DOZENS
MORE, MANY SMALL
CHILDREN.

THE WHITE HOUSE
TONIGHT POINTING THE
FINGER OF BLAME TO
SYRIAN PRESIDENT
ASSAD, ALSO CALLING
OUT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION,
SUGGESTING IF IT STOOD
UP TO ASSAD DURING ITS
WATCH, THIS MIGHT NOT
HAVE HAPPENED.

NOW, IS PRESIDENT
TRUMP WILLING TO STEP
IN?

A WORD OF CAUTION.

THERE ARE UPSETTING
IMAGES IN THIS REPORT.

DISTURBING IMAGES
TAKEN JUST AFTER THE
EXPLOSION.

WITNESSES SAY IT WAS A
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK.

IN THE VIDEO IT
APPEARS TO BEAR ALL
THE HALLMARKS.

THIS BOY, USING ALL
HIS STRENGTH JUST TO
BREATHE.

FIRST RESPONDERS
DOUSED THE VICTIMS
WITH WATER AND
STRIPPED OFF THEIR
CLOTHES TO WASH OFF
WHAT THEY SAID WAS A
CHEMICAL WEAPON.

MEDICS AND VOLUNTEERS
IN THIS REBEL
CONTROLLED PART OF
SYRIA RUSHED THE
INJURED TO LOCAL
CLINICS, THEY CLAIM
SYRIAN PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S
REGIME FIRED WITH A
CHEMICAL NERVE AGENT
BANNED, SARIN.

NO ONE IS DOING
ANYTHING TO STOP THESE
DEATH ATTACKS.

VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO
A MAKESHIFT CLINIC
BUILT IN A CAVE TO
PROTECT IT.

THERE, A FATHER KISSED
HIS DAUGHTER GOOD-BYE.

NEARBY, THIS ACTIVIST
WAS RECORDING WHAT HE
WAS SEEING, SAYING
WARPLANES WERE STILL
OVERHEAD, THEN --
HOSPITALS ARE OFTEN
TARGETED IN THIS WAR
THAT RESPECTS NO
CONVENTIONS.

AMAZINGLY, THE
ACTIVIST SURVIVED.

IN 2013, THE U.S. THREATENED WAR WHEN
MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE
WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER
ALLEGED CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD
WARNED THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD
CROSS A RED LINE.

BUT WHEN RUSSIA
BROKERED A DEAL, A
U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE
NEVER CAME.

IN A STATEMENT ON
TODAY'S ATTACK,
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS
BY THE BASHAR AL ASSAD
REGIME ARE A
CONSEQUENCE OF THE
PAST ADMINISTRATION'S
WEAKNESS.

A U.S. INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIAL TELLS NBC
NEWS TONIGHT WHILE
DETAILS ARE STILL
COMING IN IT APPEARS
THIS WAS ACTUALLY A
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THE SYRIAN ARMY DENIES
IT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.
