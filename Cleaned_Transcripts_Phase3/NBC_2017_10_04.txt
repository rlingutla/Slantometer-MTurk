HARROWING NEW VIDEO
FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
OF CHAOS AND CARNAGE.

OFFICERS RUNNING
TOWARD THE DANGER.

AND TONIGHT, SOME OF
THE MOST POWERFUL
STORIES OF HEROISM
WE'VE HEARD.

A FATHER AND SON WHO
BOTH TOOK BULLETS
WHILE WORKING
FRANTICALLY TO SAVE
OTHERS.

HE KEPT TELLING ME
THAT HE LOVED
EVERYBODY AND JUST
WANTED EVERYBODY TO
KNOW THAT HE LOVED
EVERYBODY.

PLUS, NEW DETAILS
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

THE GUNMAN'S
GIRLFRIEND BACK IN THE
U.S. NOW BEING
QUESTIONED BY THE FBI.

LAS VEGAS MASS
SHOOTING.

BEHIND ME THOSE
BLOWN-OUT WINDOWS HIGH
UP IN THE MANDALAY BAY
HOTEL ARE HARD TO MISS
ON THIS END OF THE
VEGAS STRIP.

A THANKFULLY TEMPORARY
REMINDER OF THE 11
MINUTES OF
COLD-BLOODED VIOLENCE
HERE JUST THREE NIGHTS
AGO.

TONIGHT, A NEW PIECE
OF VIDEO TAKEN JUST
BELOW THE HOTEL AS THE
GUNFIRE ERUPTED.

IT WAS CAPTURED BY A
CAB DRIVER IN THE TAXI
QUEUE AT THE MANDALAY
BAY AS THE SHOTS RANG
OUT, CAPTURING AN
EERIE CALM AMONG
CONFUSED HOTEL GUESTS,
AND THEN THE PANIC OF
FLEEING CONCERTGOERS.

11 MINUTES IN WHICH
LIVES WERE ABRUPTLY
ENDED OR FOREVER
ALTERED.

I SAID, LET'S GET
DOWN, AND HE SAID, NO,
WE'LL GET TRAMPLED.

LET'S GO.

AND HE WRAPPED HIS
ARMS AROUND MY BACK.

AND AS WE STARTED TO
RUN, I FELT HIM GET
SHOT IN THE BACK, AND
WE FELL TO THE GROUND.

AND TONIGHT, AS THE
PRESIDENT AND FIRST
LADY VISITED WITH
SURVIVORS AND FIRST
RESPONDERS HERE, WE'RE
GETTING A TERRIFYING
NEW GLIMPSE OF THAT
NIGHT THROUGH THE EYES
OF POLICE RESPONDING
TO THE SHOTS.

THERE WERE MOMENTS OF
TERROR AND SOME OF
REMARKABLE BRAVERY.

GO THAT WAY!

GET OUT OF HERE!

THERE'S GUNSHOTS
COMING FROM OVER
THERE.

GO THAT WAY!

SAY THEY RAN INTO 11
MINUTES OF HELL.

GET BACK!

DEPARTMENT RELEASING A
SAMPLING OF BODY CAM
FOOTAGE CAPTURING THE
INTENSE HORROR, VOLLEY
AFTER VOLLEY OF
RELENTLESS GUNFIRE.

GET DOWN, GET DOWN,
GET DOWN!

TEARING THROUGH THE
AIR MUFFLED ONLY BY
SCREAMS.

THEY KNEW WHAT THEY
WERE DOING, BUT IT'S
ALSO NOT JUST A FLY BY
THE SEAT OF YOUR PANTS
TYPE OF RISK.

IT'S A CALCULATED
OFFICERS SWEEPING ON
TO THE KILLING FIELD,
THIS CAMERA BURIED
UNDER A VEST, SHOWS
ONE OFFICER USING HIS
BODY TO SHIELD A
VICTIM LYING ON THE
GROUND.

ALONGSIDE POLICE,
PARAMEDICS KNOWING
THEY, TOO, COULD BE
KILLED.

IT'S VERY INTENSE.

BUCHANAN'S TEAM
SCRAMBLED TO PUT ON
KEVLAR.

THEY'RE FOCUSED ON
THE PATIENTS AND
THEY'RE ALSO FOCUSED
ON MAKING SURE THAT
THEY SAVE AS MANY
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

NEW VIDEO CAPTURED BY
A CAB DRIVER.

IN THE CHAOS, POLICE
WOULD EVENTUALLY SPOT
THE SHOOTER.

MUZZLE BLASTS FROM
THE MANDALAY BAY.

NORTH OF THE
MANDALAY BAY, IT'S
COMING OUT OF A
PANIC WERE EVERYWHERE.

VICTIMS PILING INTO
THIS TAXI.

JUST GO!

JUST GO.

OKAY.

I'M GOING.

I'M GOING.

I'M GOING.

EVERYBODY'S DYING.

COME ON.

THOSE PULLED TO
SAFETY, 24-YEAR-OLD
KRISTIN BABIK.

OUT OF EVERYONE WHO
WAS RUNNING AWAY AND
SCREAMING, THERE WERE
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TOWARD IT TO HELP.

SHE'S STILL WEARING
HER CONCERT WRISTBAND.

I'M FORTUNATE I
DIDN'T PASS AWAY, BUT
I'M ALSO UNFORTUNATE
THAT I AM NOW STUCK
WITH THIS BULLET WOUND
IN MY BACK FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

GO, GO, GO, GO.

BATTLEFIELD NO ONE
WILL EVER FORGET.

DURING THE GUNFIRE
FROM THIS HOTEL ROOM,
POLICE SAY MANY OF
THEIR OFFICERS WERE
WEARING BODY CAMERAS,
ADDING MUCH OF THE
VIDEO IS STILL BEING
REVIEWED.

SOME IS TOO GRAPHIC TO
SHOW.

IT IS A REAL LIFE
ACCOUNT OF THE TERROR
THAT RAINED DOWN ON SO
MANY.

SO TERRIFYING JUST
TO WATCH IT, I CAN'T
IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH
IT.

TONIGHT, THE WOMAN
WHO LIVED WITH THE LAS
VEGAS ATTACKER IS BACK
IN THE U.S., ARRIVING
IN LOS ANGELES, WHERE
SHE SPENT MOST OF THE
DAY ANSWERING
QUESTIONS FROM THE FBI
AND LAS VEGAS
AUTHORITIES.

INVESTIGATORS ARE
HOPING SHE CAN PROVIDE
SOME ANSWERS THAT HAVE
SO FAR BEEN ELUSIVE.

WE GET ALL THE LATEST
NOW FROM OUR JUSTICE
CORRESPONDENT PETE
WILLIAMS.

DANLEY ARRIVED LATE
LAST NIGHT IN LOS
ANGELES FROM A FAMILY
VISIT IN THE
PHILIPPINES AND WAS
QUESTIONED FOR HOURS
TODAY AT THE FBI'S
L.A. OFFICE.

INVESTIGATORS WANT TO
KNOW IF SHE HAD ANY
HINT THAT STEPHEN
PADDOCK WAS PLANNING A
VIOLENT ATTACK OR IF
SHE KNEW OF ANY REASON
WHY HE WOULD COMMIT
SUCH A HORRIBLE CRIME.

SO FAR THEY SAY NO
OBVIOUS ANSWERS.

LATE TODAY HER LAWYER
READ A STATEMENT FROM
HER.

HE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO ME OR TOOK
ANY ACTION THAT I WAS
AWARE OF THAT I
UNDERSTOOD IN ANY WAY
TO BE A WARNING THAT
SOMETHING HORRIBLE
LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

AUSTRALIA, WHERE SHE'S
FROM, HER SISTER SAID
IN AN INTERVIEW THAT
STEPHEN PADDOCK GAVE
HER THE AIRLINE TICKET
TO GET HER OUT OF THE
COUNTRY SO THAT HE
COULD FREELY CARRY OUT
HIS SHOOTING RAMPAGE.

SHE WAS SENT AWAY.

SHE WAS SENT AWAY SO
THAT SHE WILL BE NOT
THERE TO INTERFERE
WITH WHAT HE IS
PLANNING.

SO IN MY -- IN MY
HEART AND IN MY
UNDERSTANDING, HE DONE
THIS SOLELY HIMSELF.

STATEMENT, DANLEY SAID
SHE FEARED THE PLANE
TICKET AND THE MONEY
HE WIRED TO HER MEANT
HE WANTED TO BREAK UP
WITH HER.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY
12 OF THE 23 RIFLES
FOUND IN PADDOCK'S
HOTEL ROOM WERE
EQUIPPED WITH BUMP
STOCKS TO MAKE THEM
FIRE LIKE MACHINE GUNS
AND CLIPS TO HOLD 60
TO 100 ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION.

AS INVESTIGATORS BUILD
A TIMELINE OF WHAT LED
UP TO THE ATTACK,
THEY'RE TRYING TO
TRACK DOWN A WOMAN WHO
WAS SEEN WITH PADDOCK
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE
SHOOTING.

THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
CONNECTION, IF ANY,
SHE HAD TO THE ATTACK,
BUT THEYANT TO KNOW
WHO SHE WAS SO THEY
CAN TALK TO HER.

THEY'RE ALSO SCOURING
PADDOCK'S HEALTH
RECORDS.

HE TOOK VALIUM, BUT
FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY
TONIGHT THEY FOUND NO
SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH
PROBLEMS.

SO FAR THE FBI SAYS NO
IDEA OF WHAT DROVE HIM
TO COMMIT MASS MURDER.

WE LOOK FOR ACTUAL
INDICATORS OF
AFFILIATION, OF
MOTIVE, OF INTENT, AND
SO FAR WE'RE NOT
THERE.

WE DON'T HAVE THOSE
SORT OF INDICATORS.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL SAYS TONIGHT
THAT MARILOU DANLEY'S
BEEN COOPERATIVE AND
THAT THERE'S NO SIGN
SHE HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH STEPHEN PADDOCK'S
MASS SHOOTING.

AND AS THE
INVESTIGATION MOVES
FORWARD, WE ARE
HEARING MORE DRAMATIC
ACCOUNTS OF A STRUGGLE
TO GET OUT ALIVE ONCE
THE CHAOS AND
CONFUSION BEGAN.

STRANGERS HELPING
STRANGERS UNDER THAT
HAIL OF GUNFIRE.

AT ONE HOSPITAL, WE
WERE THERE FOR AN
EMOTIONAL REUNION
BETWEEN A SURVIVOR AND
A GOOD SAMARITAN WHO
SAVED HER LIFE.

BULLETS STARTED
RAINING DOWN SUNDAY,
THOUSANDS BEGAN THEIR
DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO
ESCAPE.

BUT KAREN SMERBER
COULDN'T.

SHOT IN THE STOMACH,
SHE WAS DOUBLED OVER
IN PAIN.

INSTEAD OF RUNNING,
SHE CALLED HER
HUSBAND.

I WAS GOING TO DIE.

IF THIS IS IT, HAD TO
SAY GOOD-BYE.

CALL HOME WAS
INTERRUPTED BY A GOOD
SAMARITAN.

THE MAN WITH A MOTIVE
TO KILL STILL FIRING
SNIPER'S NEST.

NOW ANOTHER MAN WITH A
MISSION TO SAVE
CARRIED THE MOTHER OF
FOUR AWAY FROM HARM.

YEP.

MY GUARDIAN ANGEL
SHOWED UP.

HIS NAME'S SHAUN.

AND HE PICKED ME UP.

HE PICKED ME UP AND
CARRIED ME OUT OF
THERE.

TOPPER FLAGGING DOWN A
CAR, RIDING WITH HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

INCREDIBLY THE BULLET
HAD PASSED THROUGH HER
WITHOUT HITTING ANY
VITAL ORGANS.

WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
THE FACT, KAREN, THAT
YOU WERE IN THIS
SITUATION.

YOU WERE PROBABLY
BLEEDING
SIGNIFICANTLY.

I WAS BLEEDING TO
DEATH.

IF HE DIDN'T GET ME
HERE, I WOULD HAVE
DIED.

WERE THERE WHEN SHAUN
STOPPED BY.

HE'S AT THE BEDSIDE
AND SAYS THERE'S NO
BETTER GIFT THAN
SEEING HER RECOVER.

WHETHER WE LIKE IT
OR NOT, OUR LIVES ARE
INTERTWINED FOREVER.

YEAH.

TITLE FOR WHAT HE DID
THAT NIGHT.

HE SAW HER AND
REACTED.

BUT SMERBER'S HUSBAND
MATT SAYS HE DESERVES
THAT AND MORE.

I'M STILL MARRIED
TODAY AND MY KIDS HAVE
THEIR MOM AND STEP-MOM
AND BECAUSE OF ONE
HEROIC PERSON.

MAKING A STRONG
RECOVERY, THE MOMENTS
OF TERROR HAUNT
SMERBER'S DREAMS, BUT
WHEN SHE AWAKES SHE
HOLDS ON TO ANOTHER
MEMORY, THE MOMENT A
STRANGER PICKED HER UP
AND SAVED HER LIFE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND THE FIRST LADY, AS
WE SAID EARLIER, MADE
THEIR WAY HERE TO LAS
VEGAS TODAY MEETING
WITH VICTIMS AND THEIR
FAMILIES, THANKING
FIRST RESPONDERS AND
MEDICAL STAFF OF THEIR
HEROIC EFFORTS AND
DELIVERING A MESSAGE
FROM THE NATION TO
THIS HEARTBROKEN CITY.

WE KNOW THAT YOUR
SORROW FEELS ENDLESS.

WE STAND TOGETHER TO
HELP YOU CARRY YOUR
PAIN.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

WE WILL NEVER LEAVE
YOUR SIDE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
TODAY HERE IN LAS
VEGAS.

MUCH MORE FROM LAS
VEGAS AS WE CONTINUE
IN A MOMENT.

AS THE WHITE HOUSE
DEALS WITH THAT
FALLOUT IN CONGRESS,
THERE ARE GROWING
CALLS FOR A BAN ON
BUMP STOCKS, THE
DEVICES THE LAS VEGAS
GUNMAN USED TO TURN
HIS SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS ESSENTIALLY
INTO AUTOMATIC MACHINE
GUNS.

AND AS OUR CHIEF WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT
HALLIE JACKSON
REPORTS, SOME
PROMINENT REPUBLICANS
TONIGHT ARE SIGNALING
THAT THEY ARE OPEN TO
TRUMP TODAY ARGUES NOW
IS NOT THE TIME TO
TALK GUN CONTROL.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO
TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY.

WE WON'T TALK ABOUT
THAT.

PRESIDENT VISITING
VEGAS WHERE SOME
22,000 PEOPLE
EXPERIENCED THE
DEADLIEST SHOOTING IN
MODERN U.S. HISTORY.

DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S
DAUGHTER WAS ALMOST
ONE OF THEM.

THEY WERE GOING TO
STAY AT THAT HOTEL.

THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT
WASHINGTON, THE
SENATOR, WHOSE
DAUGHTER NEVER ENDED
UP AT THE COUNTRY
CONCERT, IS
INTRODUCING A NEW BAN
ON BUMP STOCKS.

THE NEVADA SHOOTER HAD
12 OF THE DEVICES
WHICH LEGALLY ALLOW A
SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN TO
SHOOT FASTER LIKE AN
AUTOMATIC.

DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL
CO-SPONSORS THE BILL.

HAVE YOU HAD
DISCUSSIONS ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE
AISLE?

THERE IS
RECEPTIVENESS THAT I
THINK IS VERY, VERY
SIGNIFICANT.

TWO REPUBLICANS SAY
THEY WOULD BACK A BUMP
STOCK BAN.

ONE TEXAS LAWMAKER, A
GUN OWNER, SAYS
THERE'S NO REASON FOR
THE DEVICES, WHICH
SENATOR BILL CASSIDY
WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH
UNTIL NOW.

WHO WANTS TO SEE
ANOTHER LAS VEGAS?

ON THE OTHER HAND,
THERE'S NOT GOING TO
BE A SINGLE LAW WHICH
STOPS SOMEBODY
DETERMINED TO DO
SOMETHING BAD.

LEADERS SAY THEY WANT
TO LEARN MORE, BUT NO
HEARING'S BEEN
SCHEDULED YET.

FOR DEMOCRATS AN
UPHILL BATTLE.

FOR SOME REPUBLICANS,
A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
BUMP STOCKS.

IT'S ABOUT ULTIMATELY
GETTING RID OF THE
SECOND AMENDMENT.

COUNTY SHOOTING
COMPLEX A HALF HOUR
FROM THE VEGAS STRIP.

THERE SHOULD NOT BE
ANY RESTRICTIONS
WHATSOEVER ON GUN
RIGHTS.

WASHINGTON THEY ARE
TALKING.

THE QUESTION NOW
WHETHER THAT TALK WILL
TURN TO ACTION.

STILL AHEAD
TONIGHT, HOTELS ON
HIGH ALERT.

THE ENHANCED SECURITY
YOU MAY FIND NEXT TIME
YOU CHECK IN AFTER THE
MASS SHOOTING HERE.

HOPE YOU CAN STAY WITH
US.

WE'RE BACK NOW
FROM LAS VEGAS WHERE
TONIGHT RESORTS HAVE
STEPPED UP SECURITY AS
OFFICIALS TRY TO ADD
EXTRA LAYERS OF SAFETY
WHILE TRYING TO FIND
THE RIGHT BALANCE
BETWEEN THE EASE OF
ENJOYING THE HOTELS
AND CASINOS UP AND
DOWN THE STRIP AND THE
NEED TO PROTECT WHAT
COULD BE SEEN AS SOFT
TARGETS.

MAJOR NEW SECURITY
MEASURES DEPLOYED IN
LAS VEGAS, THREE DAYS
AFTER SUNDAY'S MASS
SHOOTING FROM A HOTEL
ROOM WINDOW.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
STEPPING UP SECURITY
OUTSIDE OF HOTELS AND
INSIDE AT THE WYNN AND
ENCORE, BEYOND THE
SECURITY CAMERAS, NEW
BAG CHECKS AND
HANDHELD METAL
DETECTORS FOR GUESTS
AND STAFF.

PLUS, K-9 UNITS
SCOURING THE STRIP AND
SEARCHING HOTEL ROOMS
FOR POSSIBLE THREATS.

JEFF AND PENNY
CHITTENDON HAVE
VISITED VEGAS TEN
TIMES.

THIS TRIP IS
DIFFERENT.

LAST NIGHT WE HAD
TO GO THROUGH METAL
DETECTORS, WHICH WAS
THE FIRST TIME WE'VE
EVER HAD TO DO THAT.

CHALLENGE KEEPING
PEOPLE SAFE WHILE
MAINTAINING AMBIENCE
FOR 43 MILLION ANNUAL
VISITORS.

WE'RE OBSERVING
EVERYONE WHO COMES ON
TO OUR PROPERTY.

WE'RE DOING BAG
CHECKS.

WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH
BUSINESS AWAY BUT WE
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
OFFICIALS SAY IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY
GUARANTEE THE SAFETY
OF LAS VEGAS OR ANY
CITY WITH THOUSANDS OF
ROOMS AND BALCONIES
OVERLOOKING POPULAR
PUBLIC SPACES.

DO WE WANT TO TIE
DOWN EVERYBODY'S
FREEDOM BECAUSE WE
HAVE A NUT AND PIECE
OF GARBAGE LIKE THIS
THING?

I DON'T THINK SO.

HOTELS AND CITIES CAN
DO MORE.

POSSIBLY PUT
SENSORS IN THE
WINDOWS.

THAT WAY WINDOWS, ONCE
IT'S BROKEN OUT, YOU
OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE'S
CAN BE MORE VIGILANT,
TOO.

EVERYBODY HAS A
ROLE IN SECURITY.

EVERYBODY KNOWS THE
SAYING, SEE SOMETHING,
SAY SOMETHING.

YOU CAN GO TO A VALET
ATTENDANT, YOU CAN GO
TO THE FRONT DESK.

THEY ALL HAVE A DIRECT
LINE TO SECURITY.

WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS
IS SAFE.

FIRST RESPONDERS IN
THE CROWD WHO JUMPED
INTO ACTION WHEN
BULLETS STARTED FLYING
HERE IN VEGAS.

A NEW TIMELINE OF THE LAS VEGAS
MASSACRE...

IN JUST THE PAST HOUR -
INVESTIGATORS TOOK US MINUTE BY
MINUTE INTO THE SHOOTING ...
PLUS LAPTOPS SNATCHED FROM
CUSTOMERS.

WHAT POLICE ARE DOING
AFTER SEVERAL BOLD THEFTS AT
LOCAL COFFEE SHOPS.

FINALLY, WE CAN
NEVER SAY ENOUGH ABOUT
THE BRAVE FIRST
RESPONDERS WHO RISKED
THEIR LIVES TO SAVE
OTHERS IN THE TRAGEDY
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

MANY WERE OFF DUTY AND
HAD COME FROM ALL OVER
TO ENJOY SOME GOOD
MUSIC WHEN SUDDENLY
THE SHOOTING BEGAN.

OUR JOE FRYER HAS
MORE.

WEREN'T WEARING
UNIFORMS, BUT THAT
MASSIVE COUNTRY MUSIC
CROWD WAS FILLED WITH
POLICE OFFICERS,
FIREFIGHTERS AND
PARAMEDICS.

OFF DUTY IS HOW WE
DESCRIBE THEM, BUT
THIS MOMENT PROVED
THEY'RE NEVER TRULY
OFF.

I STARTED CRAWLING
TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO
WERE WOUNDED.

PHIPPEN, WAS AT THE
CONCERT WITH HIS
FATHER JOHN.

BOTH JUMPED INTO
ACTION.

HE WAS COVERING
THIS GIRL, AND HE GOT
SHOT.

I GOT OVER THERE AS
FAST AS I COULD, AND I
PUT MY ARM AROUND HIM.

AND THAT'S WHEN I GOT
SURVIVED.

HIS DAD DID NOT.

HE WANTED EVERYBODY
TO KNOW HOW MUCH HE
LOVED THEM, AND HE
WANTED ME TO TELL
THEM.

THAT WAS THE LAST
THING HE SAID TO ME.

SMITH WAS ALSO SHOT,
HIT IN THE NECK.

I STARTED LOOKING
AROUND LIKE I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO DIE.

I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

APPEARED, ONE OF ABOUT
18 OFF-DUTY SAN DIEGO
POLICE OFFICERS AT THE
FESTIVAL.

I REMEMBER JUST
HOLDING HIS HAND
TELLING HIM THAT HE
JUST NEEDED TO FIGHT.

HE MADE IT THIS FAR.

OFF-DUTY FIREFIGHTERS
FROM THE VEGAS AREA
WERE ALSO ON THE SCENE
INCLUDING JESSE GOMEZ
WHO GOT HIS FAMILY TO
SAFETY, THEN TOLD HIS
WIFE HE WAS GOING BACK
TO HELP.

IT'S PROBABLY ONE
OF THE HARDEST
DECISIONS I'VE EVER
MADE, BUT SHE KNEW I
HAD TO GO.

TRAGEDY HIT, THE PLACE
KNOWN AS SIN CITY HAD
NO SHORTAGE OF ANGELS.
