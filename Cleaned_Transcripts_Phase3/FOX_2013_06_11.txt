PLUS THE MAN BEHIND THE
BIGGEST INTELLIGENCE LEAK
IN A GENERATION.

STILL MISSING IN ACTION.

BUT HE MAY NOT BE THROUGH
TALKING.

THERE IS WORD ED SNOWDEN
HAS MORE SECRETS TO EXPOSE.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT
REVELATIONS.

NOW, THE RUSSIANS SAY
THEY MAY GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS
TUESDAY NIGHT, A WORLDWIDE
MANHUNT FOR THE NSA LEAKER
AND THE LAWYERS ARE ALREADY
HARD AT WORK.

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
NOW FACING TWO LAWSUITS FOR
MONITORING THE PHONE
RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS.

THE AMERICAN CIVIL
LIBERTIES UNION REPORTS IT
HAS NOW FILED A
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE
ARGUING THE PROGRAM
VIOLATES BOTH FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND PRIVACY RIGHTS.

ACCORDING TO THE ACLU, IT
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF
REQUIRING EVERY AMERICAN TO
FILE A DAILY REPORT WITH
THE GOVERNMENT OF EVERY
LOCATION THEY VISITED
EVERY PERSON THEY TALKED TO
ON THE PHONE, THE TIME OF
EACH CALL, AND THE LENGTH
OF EVERY CONVERSATION.

WHAT ARE THE OTHER
ARGUMENTS OF THIS LAWSUIT
TRACE.

THE ACLU LAWSUIT SHEP,
GOES EVEN A STEP FURTHER
THAN WHAT YOU SAID
ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF
VIOLATING OUR VERY RIGHT OF
ASSOCIATION.

THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE HANG
OUT WITH, SAYING AND I'M
QUOTING HERE IT GIVES
GOVERNMENT COMPREHENSIVE
ASSOCIATION.

WEALTH OF DETAIL ABOUT OUR
FAMILIAL, POLITICAL
PROFESSIONAL RELIGIOUS AND
INTIMATE ASSOCIATIONS.

THE SECOND LAWSUIT WAS
FILED BY A FORMER DOJ
PROSECUTOR WHO HAS SUED THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
BEFORE.

BUT ALSO BY THE PARENTS OF
MICHAEL STRANGE.

HE WAS AMONG 25 NAVY SEALS
AND FIVE OTHER AMERICANS
KILLED IN A HELICOPTER
CRASH IN AFGHANISTAN BACK
IN 2011.

THE PARENTS ALLEGE THE
GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE
ACCESSED THEIR PHONE
RECORDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
BLAMED THE GOVERNMENT FOR
THE CRASH THAT KILLED THEIR
SON.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS YET
TO COMMENT, SHEP, ON EITHER
ONE OF THESE LAWSUITS.

ARE TO BELIEVE THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRACKS
EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO,
YET, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
CANNOT LOCATE A 29-YEAR-OLD
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS
LEFT HONG KONG.

7 MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT
CITY, 65,000 HOTEL ROOMS.

AND NOW THERE IS WORD THAT
RUSSIA MIGHT BE WILLING TO
GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS IF THE
REQUEST IS MADE IT WILL BE
CONSIDERED.

TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM, HE
WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO GO TO
THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN
HONG KONG SNOWDEN WOULD
HAVE TO APPLY.

HE ONCE TOLD THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER THAT HE DOES NOT
EXPECT TO BE FREE FOREVER
THOUGH, LISTEN.

YOU CAN'T COME FORWARD
AGAINST THE WORLD'S MOST
POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY AND BE COMPLETELY
FREE FROM RISK BECAUSE THEY
ARE SUCH POWERFUL
ADVERSARIES THAT NO ONE CAN
MEANINGFULLY OPPOSE THEM.

IF THEY WANT TO GET YOU
THEY WILL GET NEW TIME.

SNOWDEN LEFT THE HAWAII
HOME HE SHARED WITH HIS
GIRLFRIEND LINDSEY MILLS
THE SELF-PROCLAIMED POLE
DANCER.

HE LEFT THREE WEEKS AGO.

AS PART OF THIS
INVESTIGATION THAT HOME
WILL BE SEARCHED AND HIS
GIRLFRIEND WILL BE
QUESTIONED.

LEAKER HAS A LOT MORE TO
LEAK.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM ONE OF
THE COLUMNISTS WHO
PRESENTED HIS STORY.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT
REVELATIONS THAT HAVE NOT
YET BEEN HEARD OVER THE
NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, A
MONTH, HOW FAST WE GET THE
NEXT ONE OUT IS SOMETHING
WE ARE DECIDING NOW.

BUT THERE ARE DOZENS OF
STORIES GENERATED BY THE
DOCUMENTS THAT HE PROVIDED.

AND WE INTEND TO PURSUE
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

SNOWDEN IS READY TO FACE
THE CONSEQUENCES AND
WHATEVER IS COMING HIS WAY.

GOOGLE EXECUTIVES ARE
ASKING THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT TO LET THEM
RELEASE ALL GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE REQUESTS.

THEY SAY THAT WILL PROVE
THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE
FEDS UNFETTERED ACCESS TO
THEIR SERVERS GOOMG TO
REPORTERS PUT THE LETTER IN
WRITING TO THE ERIC HOLDER
AND FBI DIRECTOR ROBERT
MUELLER.

SO FAR NO RESPONSE.

THE FEDS ARE GIVING MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPY
PROGRAMS.

RARE BRIEFING OF THE FULL
HOUSE BY SENIOR AT THE    DEPUTIES
AT
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FBI
AND NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY ABOUT THE DATA
COLLECTION PROGRAM.

ALSO ON CAPITOL HILL THE
HEAD OF THE NSA AND U.S.
CYBER COMMAND JEN KEITH
ALEXANDER WHOSE PROGRAMS
ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE
LEAKS.

LAWMAKERS PRESSING
WITNESSES ON HOW A
29-YEAR-OLD CONTRACTOR GOT
A HIGH LEVEL SECURITY
CLEARANCE.

HOW HE WALKED OUT WITH
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND
HOW MUCH WEB CONTENT THE
NSA IS SCOOPING UP.

AFTER ONE BRIEFING A SENSE
THERE IS MORE TO THE
PROGRAMS AND THE WAY THEY
ARE POLICED.

SOME OF THE MEDIA
ACCOUNTS I HAVE READ BASED
ON THE LEAKS DO NOT PAINT A
COMPLETE AND ACCURATE
PORTRAYAL HOW THE PROGRAMS
WORK AND HOW THE SAFEGUARDS
THAT EXIST FOR THE PROGRAM
WORK.

TONIGHT, THE DEMOCRATIC
SENATOR OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAYING THE
DECLASSIFYING INFORMATION
ON THE NSA PROGRAMS WOULD
SHOW SO.

LATEST ON POTENTIAL
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST
THE LEAKER?

WELL, A SOURCE FAMILIAR
WITH THE SCOPE OF THE
INVESTIGATION TELLS FOX
NEWS CHARGES MUST BE
WEIGHED CAREFULLY BECAUSE
WHATEVER CHARGES SNOWDEN IS
EXTRA DILTED ON MUST BE THE
SAME CHARGES HE IS
PROSECUTED ON IN THE U.S.

SO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
CANNOT PULL THE EQUIVALENT
OF A BAIT AND SWITCH IN
THIS CASE.

THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY
DODGING QUESTIONS
CHARACTERIZING THE NSA
LEAKER.

ARE YOU WILLING TO SAY
WHETHER YOU SEE SNOWDEN AS
A WHISTLEBLOWER?

I AM NOT WILLING TO
COMMENT ON THE STATUS OF
THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

CONSULTING GIANT BOOZ
ALLEN HAMILTON SAYS IT
FORMALLY TERMINATED SNOWDEN
FOR VIOLATION OF THE FIRM'S
CODE OF ETHICS AND THE
FIRM'S POLICY.

THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
WENT EVEN FURTHER.

HE IS A TRAITOR.

THE PRESIDENT OUTLINED LAST
WEEK THAT THESE WERE
IMPORTANT NATIONAL SECURITY
PROGRAMS TO HELP KEEP
AMERICANS SAFE AND GIVE US
TOOLS TO FIGHT THE
TERRORIST THREAT THAT WE
FACE.

THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS
INFORMATION PUTS AMERICANS
AT RISK.

IT SHOWS OUR ADVERSARIES
WHAT OUR CAPABILITIES ARE.

FOX NEWS HAS ALSO TOLD
THE INVESTIGATION IS
CONSIDERING WHETHER SNOWDEN
HAD HELP BUT AT THIS EARLY
STAGE THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT
SUGGEST THAT, SHEP.

NEW LEAKS HAVE BOOSTED THE
ORIGINAL INTEREST IN THE
ORIGINAL BIG BROTHER NOVEL
GEORGE ORWELL 18984.

AMAZON.COM REPORT THAT
SALES OF THE PAPERBACK
VERSION OF THAT BOOK HAVE
TRIPLED OVER THE LAST 24
HOURS.

1984 WAS PUBLISHED BASS IN
194, IT TELLS OF A NEAR
FUTURE WORLD IN WHICH
NEARLY ALL OF OUR
ACTIVITIES ARE UNDER
SURVEILLANCE GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE AND MIND
CONTROL.

JUST NOW KEITH ALEXANDER IS
NOW SCHEDULED TO EXPLAIN
HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ON
THURSDAY.

MEANTIME THE AMERICAN CIVIL
LIBERTIES UNION REPORTS
THAT IT IS SUING THE
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
OVER ITS MONITORING OF THE
PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS
OF AMERICANS.
