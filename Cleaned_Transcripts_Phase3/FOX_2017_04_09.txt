TRUMP IS FACING
A SERIES OF FOREIGN POLICY
TESTS.

ALSO UNFOLDING U.S. MAKING MOVES
IN TWO MAJOR GLOBAL HOT SPOTS,
SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA, PRESIDENT
TRUMP ARRIVING BACK IN
WASHINGTON D.C. AFTER A FEW DAYS
IN FLORIDA MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT OF CHINA.

I THINK THAT PRESIDENT HAS MADE
THE RIGHT MOVE BOTH IN SYRIA AND
IN KOREA.

BUT, THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

NEW QUESTIONS SURROUNDING
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND WHETHER
HIS TEAM ARE ACTUALLY ON THE
SAME PAGE, AMBASSADOR TO UNITED
NATIONS NIKKI HALEY SIGNALS THAT
PRESIDENT MAY BE IN FAVOR OF
REGIME CHANGE IN SYRIA, WE GO TO
THAT NOW, BUT SECRETARY OF SAY
THE TILLERSON SAID IT IS UP TO
THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, NATIONAL
CLEAR FI FID THOSE COMMENTS.

AMBASSADOR HALEY POINTING OUT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
HOW A POLITICAL SOLUTION.

WE ARE NOT SAY WE'RE THE ONES
WHO WILL AFFECT THAT CHANGE,
WE'RE SEEING OTHER COUNTRY HAVE
TO ASK THEMSELVES HARD
QUESTIONS, RUSSIA SHOULD ASK
THEMSELVES, WHAT ARE WE DOING
HERE.

HARRIS PETER IS AT THE WHITE
HOUSE NOW WITH MORE ON THIS,
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS NOW TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER A SERIOUS
STRATEGY?

REPORTER THEY KNOW THEY WANT
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD TO GO
AWAY, BUT NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD TAKEOVER IF
HE WAS TO GO.

AND IF THAT IS EVEN THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT A
REGIME CHANGE OR PUSH FOR ONE.

AND REASON THEY ARE CONCERNED IS
BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER HOW
QUICKLY THINGS WENT SOUTH IN
LIBYA WITH GADHAFI WAS TOPPLED.

WE HAVE TO LEARN LESSONS OF
PAST AND WHAT WENT WRONG IN
LIBYA WHEN YOU CHOOSE THAT
PATHWAY OF REGIME CHANGE.

WE KNOW THIS WILL BE HARD WORK.

BUT WE THINK IT IS ALSO A
PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO A
DURABLE AND LASTING STABILITY IN
SYRIA.

REPORTER WHICH WEEK'S
AIRSTRIKES WERE MEANT TO WEAKEN
THE ASSAD REGIME AS A RESPONSES
TO THEIR USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPON,
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION KNOWS THAT
ISIS FIGHTERS WHO SET UP SHOP IN
SYRIA ARE A MAJOR NATIONAL
SECURITY CONCERN AS WELL.

GETTING ASSAD OUT IS NOT ONLY
PART, WE HAVE TRYING TO DEFEAT
ISIS.

SECONDLY WE DON'T SEE A PEACEFUL
SYRIA WITH ASSAD IN DPLSM THEREE
MOVE TOWARD A POLITICAL
SOLUTION, AT END OF THE DAY THIS
IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION.

REPORTER NATIONAL SECURITY
MAIN OBJECTIVE OF U.S. WITH
AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THE AADD
REGIME, WAS -- ASSAD REGIME WAS
TOO SEND A STRONG POLITICAL
MESSAGE.

HARRIS I KNOW THERE ARE CHANGES
MADE AT NATIONAL SECURITY LEFT
THIS NEWS DEVELOPING, K.T.

AS U.N.

AMBASSADOR TO SINGAPORE.

REPORTER SHE WAS MICHAEL BLIN'S
FLYNN'S DEPUTY, AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO NOMINATE
HER TO AMBASSADOR OF SINGAPORE,
THAT WOULD BE A PROPORTION FOR
HER, SHE JOINS STEVE BANNON AS
SECOND OFFICIAL TO LEAVE
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISE
COUNCIL.

SINCE MICHAEL FLYNN RESIGNED.

WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
ABOUT A NATIONAL SECURITY
CONCERN BUT ON A DIFFERENT
TOPIC, TALKING ABOUT CHURCH
BOMBINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
TWEETING, SO SAD TO HEAR OF
TERRORIST ATTACK IN EGYPT, U.S.

STRONGLY CONDEMNS, I HAVE GREAT
CONFIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT ASEE
-- WILL HANDLE THOSE PROPERLY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.

HE HAS SERIOUS BUSINESS TO GET
DOWN TO.

HARRIS WELL, AS EVERYONE CAN
APPRECIATE, YOU KNOW, WE NEARED
THAT LONGER HOUR DAY, IT IS
LIGHTER OUT.

PEOPLE CAN SEE WITH MORE
DAYLIGHT, WE'RE SEEING QUITE A
BIT OF SUPPORT FROM BOTH
POLITICAL PARTIES FOR TRUMP'S
MOVE ON SYRIA MILITARY FOR
UNLEASHING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON
CITIZENS THERE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
TO GETTING A CRITICAL LOOK ON
CAPITOL HILL.

I'LL TALK WITH ONE LAW MAKER WHO
BACKS THE PRESIDENT ON SYRIA,
BUT SAID HOW HE JUSTIFIED IT
LEGALLY WAS FLAWED.

AND SAID THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO
GET INVOLVED IMMEDIATELY, SCOTT
TAYLOR A FORMER NAVY SEAL, AND
MEMBER OF HOMELAND SECURITY, HE
WILL JOIN ME LATER THIS HOUR,
STAY CLOSE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION
ON FORM POLICY.

WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT
THIS HOUR.

SCREEN LEFT, THE AIRSTRIKE ON
THE SYRIAN AIRBASE IN RESPONSE
TO THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THE RIGHT SCREEN, THE AIRCRAFT
CARRIER, THE PINNACLE OF
AMERICAN FORCE PROJECTION,
100,000 TONS OF DIPLOMACY AS WE
HAVE HEARD AN EARLIER GUEST
STAY.

IT IS STEAMING TOWARD THE KOREAN
PENINSULA TO SEND A STRONG
MESSAGE.

STRIKES IN SYRIA ARE RAISING
QUESTIONS AMONG LAWMAKERS IN
WASHINGTON OVER WHAT ROLE WE
SHOULD PLAY IN THE SIX YEARS
CIVIL WAR GOING FORWARD.

ONE SURVIVOR OF THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK THAT SPURRED THAT
OPERATION SAID PEOPLE SHOULD
FORGET THE POLITICS.

THAT MAN LOST HIS WIFE.

YOU PROBABLY SEEN THE PICTURE
GONE VIRAL OF HIM HOLDING HIS
TWIN BABIES.

THE ASSAD REGIME TOOK THEM OUT
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

HE SAID THE U.S. SHOULD DO MORE
NOW, NOT JUST ONE STRIKE.

NOT ALL SYRIANS AGREE.

IT WAS WATCHING VIDEOS OF
THIS HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK
WHICH DROVE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO
INTERVENE.

WHILE SPEAKING TODAY PEOPLE ARE
DIVIDED UP IT IS EASY TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT DROVE HIM.

IT WAS ALSO AN INCREDIBLY
SOBERING MOMENT.

AMONG THE FAMILIES WE SPOKE TO
WAS ABDUL, HE HAS BECOME THE
FACE OF THE TRAGEDY.

HE WAS REUNITED WITH FAMILY
MEMBERS WHO DID SURVIVE, THOUGH
HE LOST 22.

HE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS
HE SAW.

AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE, THE
WHOLE FAMILY WAS DEAD.

GROWN-UPS, DEAD.

FAMILY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, MY
BROTHER, HIS WIFE, THEIR
CHILDREN, MY NIECES, ALL OF THEM
DEAD.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I FAINTED.

AMONG THE DEAD, HIS 11 MONTH
OLD TWINS.

HE BURIED THEM IN HIS WIFE WITH
HIS OWN HANDS, BUT CANNOT BEAR
TO PUT THEM IN THE GROUND,
GRIPPING THEM TILL THE BITTER
END.

HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT THE
AMERICAN STRIKES.

I WANT TO TELL PRESIDENT
TRUMP, THE FIRST STRIKE WAS
GOOD, IT SAVED US.

BUT JUST A FEW HOURS LATER THE
AIRBAGS CONTINUED WORKING, IT'S
LIKE A CHALLENGE FROM ASSAD.

I CAN STILL ATTACK FROM THE SAME
BASE YOU ATTACKED.

NOT ONLY A PLANE STILL TAKING
OFF FROM THE AIRBASE, THERE
STILL BOMBING THE TOWN.

APPARENTLY ADD A GREATER PACE
THAN BEFORE, WITH NOBODY TO STOP
THEM.

ASSAD IS A CRIMINAL.

HE IS KILLING NOT ONLY HUMAN
BEINGS AND CHILDREN, BUT ANIMALS
AS IF THEY WERE THE SAME.

HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL.

THE FEELING IS ONE OF
GRATITUDE TOWARD THE U.S.

THE STRIKES GIVE THE SYRIAN BITE
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND
OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE.

BUT THE LESS THEY HAVE DONE TO
BACK UP THE ASSAD REGIME, HE
WILL CONTINUE TO KILL HIS PEOPLE
LIKE HE HAS DONE FOR THE LAST
SIX YEARS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO
LAUNCH THE MISSILE STRIKE ON
SYRIA.

HE OPPOSES THE LEGAL BASIS ON
WHICH YOU ORDER THAT MISSION.

VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN,
SCOTT TAYLOR IS A MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE APPROPRIATION ON HOMELAND
SECURITY.

THE U.S. NAVY SEAL, HE HAS
SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN THAT WAY.

I WANT TO START WITH WHERE YOU
ARE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE
PRESIDENT AND WHY YOU SAY
CONGRESS NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY
GET INVOLVED NOW?

OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND
FLEXIBILITY AS A PRESIDENT THAT
HE OR SHE SEE SOMETHING AS A
THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
TOWARD TROOPS AND INTEREST THEY
HAVE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO
ASK.

WITH THAT BEING SAID, CONGRESS
DECLARES WAR OR CREATE STATUTORY
LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR USE OF
FORCE.

THIS PRESIDENT, AND THE PREVIOUS
PRESIDENT, TWO ADMINISTRATIONS
OPERATING OFF USE OF MILITARY
FORCE FROM 16 YEARS AGO FROM A
THIRD ADMINISTRATION.

CONGRESS DOES NEED TO LEAD AND
THAT NEED TO HAVE A VOICE IN
THIS.

I'VE SEEN MANY CONGRESSMEN AND
WOMEN ON NATIONAL NEWS IN THE
PAST FEW DAYS BECAUSE OF THE
STRIKE.

THE BEST THING WE CAN DO AS
LEADERS IN CONGRESS IS TO TAKE
IT UP IN DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT
IT.

THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE THE
ABILITY TO ACT.

HE HAS THAT TIME AND FLEXIBILITY
TO DO SO.

UNDER THE UN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
TREATY, YOU CANNOT PRODUCE,
DEVELOP, OR USE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, I DO SUPPORT THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS ACTION.

I THINK THE WORLD WAS WATCHING
WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND I SUPPORT
HIS DECISION TO TAKE ACTION AND
SAY THAT WILL NOT STAND.

CAN SEE EYES GLAZING OVER.

CONGRESS CUT SEEM TO AGREE ON
ANYTHING.

I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,
THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU
ARE WORKING OFF A 16-YEAR-OLD
AUTHORIZATION OF MILITARY FORCE
TO GET THIS DONE.

DO YOU REALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE
THAT IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER YOU
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GIVE THE
PRESIDENT SUPPORT HE NEEDS?

THAT THE NEXT ONE QUESTION.

BECAUSE CONGRESS IS SLOW TO
DEBATE AND THERE'S DIVERGING
INTEREST THERE, THERE THE
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVE.

THAT'S WHEN EXECUTIVE HAS
FLEXIBILITY IN TIME TO TAKE
ACTION IF THEY DEEM FIT.

BUT, LEADERS MUST ACT.

LEADERS MUST LEAVE.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE
A SAY IN USE OF MILITARY FORCE
AROUND THE WORLD.

THAT BEING SAID, HOW TO HAVE A
SAY?

TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN
CONGRESS.

IT'S IMPORTANT THEIR VOICES LIKE
MYSELF FOR SPEAKING OUT SAME
CONGRESS MUST TAKE THIS OUT AND
DEBATED.

THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER
BIPARTISAN AND SAY WHAT WERE
GOING TO DO.

IF WERE GOING TO AUTHORIZE THE
USE OF MILITARY FORCE FOR LONGER
TIME ARE NOT.

THAT HAS BEEN LINGERING, THAT IS
OUR COMPLETE MISSION.

AS A FORMER NAVY SEAL YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENDGAME IT
SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES AND KEEPS
OUR VISION CRISP.

IT KEEPS THINGS FROM VEERING UP
AND BECOMING OTHER THINGS.

WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE?

TO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS?

THAT'S NEXT LINE POINT.

WERE NOT GOOD TO BE TALKING
ABOUT TACTICS, STRATEGY -WISE
IT'S IMPORTANT.

THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD COME
TO CONGRESS AND TALK ABOUT THE
INTELLIGENCE, THE GOALS, THE END
STATE.

I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYRIA, IT'S
A POWDER CAKE, ANYTHING THAT I'M
AWARE OF SINCE WORLD WAR II YOU
HAVE TURKEY, US, ISRAEL, RUSSIA,
OTHERS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL.

IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

I RAN AS WELL, HEZBOLLAH.

YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL
FOR FLASHPOINT.

AND NOT ENOUGH TO COMPLEXION A
POTENTIALLY GREATER CONFLICT.

IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ENDGAME
AND THE STRATEGY AND THE GOAL OF
THE UNITED STATES.

HEAR THAT IS GOING TO BE.

YOU HEARD THAT FATHER IN SYRIA
WHO LOST HIS TWINS, AMERICA DO
MORE THAN ONE STRIKE.

ARE YOU CONCERNED THE EMOTION
BASED UPON THE NEED FOR POLICY?

HOW DO YOU KEEP THEM SEPARATE?

IT IS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND
WATCHING THE IMAGES AND
LISTENING TO THAT FAMILY.

IT DOES TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LEADERS TO
BE ABLE TO SEE CLARITY THROUGH
CHAOS.

UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGY AND
THE GOALS ARE.

WE CANNOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVEN
SYRIA SIGNED ONTO THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS CONVENTION AS WELL.

IT'S IMPORTANT THE WORLD'S LEAD
AND THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
CANNOT AND WILL NOT STAND.

THE PRESIDENT TOOK DECISIVE
ACTION AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT THAN THE
LAST ONE.

WHEN YOU HAVE DIPLOMACY THAT THE
WORLD AGREES WITH YOU HAVE TO
BACK IT UP WITH FORCE.

THAT'S IMPORTANT.

TO STEP UP AND BEGIN THAT
LEADING IN CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE
YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT
HE NEEDS.

WHEN YOU COME BACK, I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT VETERANS AFFAIRS.

YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS
DONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT
PART OF DOMESTIC POLICY.

TONIGHT -- TONIGHT I ORDERED A TARGETED
MILITARY STRIKE ON AIRFIELD IN
SYRIA.

JESSE PRESIDENT TRUMP FINALLY
ENFORCING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RED
LINE.

BUT IS IT ENOUGH?

AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
RUSSIA?

WE'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT
SHE'S DONE ANYTHING IMPROPER,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE AN EFFORT TO
TAR AND FEATHER HER.

JESSE THE MEDIA CIRCLING THE
WAGONS AROUND SUSAN RICE, BUT
ARE OUR OWN INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES HELPING THEM?

GOES OUT FIRST BECAUSE, LET'S
