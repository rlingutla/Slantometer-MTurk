TONIGHT TAKING AIM, AMERICA
WEIGHS MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
SYRIA AND TONIGHT WE TAKE YOU
INSIDE THE MIND OF THE LEADER
ACCUSED OF UNLEASHING CHEMICAL
WAR.

COULD HE MAKE A DIRECT HIT ON
THE UNITED STATES?

AS WE BEGIN TONIGHT, THE CLOCK
IS TICKING ON U.S. MILITARY
ACTION IN SYRIA.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS A DECISION
IS NEAR AND U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE
IN POSITION.

AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS
ALSO JOINING THE DEBATE ABOUT
WHAT KIND OF ACTION AND EXACTLY
WHEN.

THE GOAL, TO STOP A MAN USING
BRUTAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS 5,000
MILES AWAY.

THE CENTER OF THIS HORROR.

A BRUTAL DICTATOR WHO THE VICE
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY IS
UNDENIABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
GASSING HIS OWN INNOCENT PEOPLE.

THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.

THE SYRIAN REGIME.

NO QUESTION THAT THE U.S. IS
READY TO STRIKE A PUNISHING BLOW
TO ASSAD.

U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE IN PLACE,
CRUISE MISSILES AT THE READY,
THE TARGETS IN SYRIA SELECTED.

YOU'RE READY TO GO LIKE THAT?

WE'RE READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

IN RESPONSE?

THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS HUNDREDS
OF TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND STOCK
PILES OF SARIN.

ADD TO THAT 100,000 MISSILES AND
ROCKETS INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF
POWERFUL SCUD MISSILES WHICH
COULD REACH ANY TARGET IN
NEIGHBORING ISRAEL.

TODAY IN ISRAEL A RUN ON GAS
MASKS, REQUESTS INCREASING FOUR
FOLD.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU SAYING ISRAEL IS READY
FOR ANY SCENARIO AND IF WE
IDENTIFY ANY ATTEMPT WHATSOEVER
TO HARM US, WE WILL RESPOND IN
STRENGTH.

THERE IS NO ONE STRONGER IN THIS
REGION.

NUCLEAR ARMED ISRAEL HAS THE
MOST ADVANCED BALLISTIC
MISSILES, CRUISE MISSILES AND
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS MAKING
EXPERTS BELIEVE ASSAD WOULD BE
CRAZY TO TRY TO HIT ISRAEL.

IT MIGHT CREATE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR ISRAEL THAT THEY
WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF AND PERHAPS ASSAD WOULD RUE
THE DAY THAT HE GAVE THEM THIS
OPPORTUNITY.

ENOUGH TO RAIN CHEMICALS DOWN
ON HIS PEOPLE KNOWING THE
POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES THERE IS
NO TELLING WHAT HE WOULD DO IF
CREWS MISSILES START RAINING
DOWN ON HIS OWN REGIME.

MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS ME FROM
JERUSALEM TONIGHT.

ARE THEY GOING TO TARGET HIM?

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TARGET
HIM PERSONALLY.

THEY HAVE MADE A POINT OF THAT
BUT CERTAINLY MILITARY TARGETS
IN HIS REGIME.

THAT'S GOT TO MAKE HIS NERVOUS.

I REMEMBER MEETING HIM AND
INTERVIEWING HIM.

I SHOULD REMIND EVERYBODY HE
GREW UP A LOT OF HIS LIFE IN
LONDON.

HE'S A PHYSICIAN, EDUCATED
THERE.

WHY WOULDN'T THEY TARGET HIM?

WHAT DO THEY EXPECT FROM HIM
NEXT?

I THINK THEY'RE AFRAID OF
REACTION AND THEY DON'T WANT
REGIME CHANGE.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY
CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

THIS IS A LIMITED STRIKE.

IT'S ONLY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.

THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED
IN THIS CIVIL WAR BUT IT MUST BE
EXTRAORDINARY FOR YOU TO LOOK AT
THIS MAN AS YOU SAY EDUCATED IN
LONDON WHO IS DOING THESE KINDS
OF BRUTAL, BRUTAL THINGS.

HE'S SOMEONE WHO NEVER
EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER FROM HIS
FATHER.
