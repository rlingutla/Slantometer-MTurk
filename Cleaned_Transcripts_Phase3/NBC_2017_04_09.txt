THE NEW TOUGH TALK
ABOUT RUSSIA AND SYRIA
AS THE SECRETARY OF
STATE LEAVES ON A
MISSION TO MOSCOW AND
ANOTHER KEY WHITE
HOUSE OFFICIALS IS
FORCED OUT.

SECRETARY OF STATE
REX TILLERSON ARRIVED
IN EUROPE TONIGHT FOR
CRUCIAL AND HIGHLY
ANTICIPATED MEETINGS
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

THE TWO NATIONS HAVE
TRADED CONDEMNATIONS
AND WARNINGS SINCE THE
U.S.

FIRED CRUISE
MISSILES AT SYRIA LAST
WEEK.

TENSIONS COMPLICATING
THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN MOSCOW AND
WASHINGTON.

REX TILLERSON, THE
MEDIA WARY --
 NO COMMENT.

LOW-KEY SECRETARY OF
STATE IS EMERGING
WEEKS AFTER TAKING
OFFICE.

TODAY HIS FIRST SUNDAY
SHOW INTERVIEWS.

I HOPE THAT RUSSIA
IS THINKING CAREFULLY
ABOUT ITS CONTINUED
ALLIANCE WITH BASHAR
AL ASSAD.

EXPECTED TO TAKE TO
RUSSIA WHERE HE WILL
MEET WITH THE FOREIGN
MINISTER THIS WEEK.

WITH HIS OWN
ESTABLISHED TIES TO
VLADIMIR PUTIN FROM
HIS FORMER OIL
EXECUTIVE DAYS, A
PUTIN MEETING MAY ALSO
BE POSSIBLE.

HOW HE REACTS TO
SECRETARY TILLERSON,
THE KINDS OF SIGNALS
HE SAYS IN TERMS OF
THE FUTURE, THAT'S
WHAT WE NEED TO BE
WATCHING.

RELATIONS DAMAGED BY RUSSIA'S
PROTECTION OF SYRIA'S
ASSAD REGIME AND
CLOUDED BY PUTIN'S
INTERFERENCE IN THE
2016 ELECTION, WITH
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS
BY CONGRESS AND THE
FBI.

WHAT IS AMERICA'S
STRATEGY IN SYRIA?

WHAT ABOUT ASSAD?

DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP
WANT BETTER RELATIONS
WITH PUTIN OR MORE
MISSILE STRIKES?

AGREEMENT, UNLIKELY.

U.N. AM BASSOR NIKKI
HALEY BLASTED RUSSIA
OVER SYRIA'S CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

THEIR INITIAL
REACTION WAS, ASSAD
DIDN'T DO IT, THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
DIDN'T DO IT.

PUTIN PROMISED THAT
RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE
WOULD STOP ASSAD'S USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

RUSSIA HAS FAILED
IN THAT COMMITMENT,
AND THE RESULT OF
THEIR FAILURE HAS LED
TO THE KILLING OF MORE
CHILDREN AND
INNOCENTS.

TILLERSON MISSION TO
MOSCOW COMES AS THE
WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL
SECURITY TEAM IS
RESHAPED.

OUSTED ADVISER MICHAEL
FLYNN, IS OUT, OFFERED
AN AMBASSADORSHIP.

FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF
POLITICAL STRATEGIST
STEVE BANNON FROM THE
NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL BY NEW
NATIONAL SECURITY
 STEVE BANNON
PROVIDES THE PRESIDENT
WITH ADVICE ON A BROAD
RANGE OF ISSUES AND
WILL CONTINUE TO DO
NATIONAL SECURITY
RUSSIA SHOULD BE
COMPELLED TO EXPLAIN
HOW IT COULD NOT HAVE
KNOWN IN ADVANCE ABOUT
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN
SYRIA WHEN SOME OF ITS
OWN PERSONNEL ARE
STATIONED AT THE VERY
BASE FROM WHICH THAT
ATTACK WAS LAUNCHED.

A TOUGH ISSUE FOR
SECRETARY TILLERSON IN
RUSSIA THIS WEEK.
