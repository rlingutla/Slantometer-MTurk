EDWARD SNOWDEN CANNOT HIDE
FROM AMERICAN JUSTICE FOREVER.

THAT'S WHAT A TOP U.S. OFFICIAL
IS SAYING TONIGHT.

NOW THERE'S WORD THE FORMER NSA
CONTRACTOR COPIED THE CLASSIFIED
DOCUMENTS USING A DEVICE YOU MAY
ALREADY OWN.

ED SNOWDEN WILL PAY THE PRICE
FOR EXPOSING NATIONAL
SURVEILLANCE AGENCY SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS.

THAT'S WHAT ATTORNEY GENERAL
ERIC HOLDER IS SAYING.

HE SAID THE LEAKS PUT AMERICA IN
DANGER AND I'M CONFIDENT THE
PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE WILL
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

AT LAST WORD, THAT PERSON WAS
REPORTEDLY HIDING OUT IN HONG
KONG THREATENING TO REVEAL MORE
SECRETS.

YOU'RE HEARING WE SHOULD TAKE
THIS THREAT SERIOUSLY.

WITH THE INVESTIGATION HAS
MONITORED SNOWDEN'S COMPUTER.

BASED ON HIS ELECTRONIC TRAIL
WILL YOU THE NSA COMPUTER
SYSTEMS, IT IS BELIEVED SNOWDEN
HAS MORE DOCUMENTS BEYOND A
HANDFUL OF LEAKS TO THE GUARDIAN
AND OTHER PAPERS.

AND HE SEEMS TO BOAST ABOUT WHAT
HE KNOWS.

I HAD ACCESS TO, YOU KNOW,
THE FULL ROSTERS OF EVERYONE
WORKING AT THE NSA.

THE ENTIRE JENGS COMMUNICATE AND
UNDERCOVER ASSETS ALL AROUND THE
LEAK MORE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
BASED ON THIS SEARCH IS SEEN AS
CREDIBLE.

NOW SOME SENATORS SAY THEY'RE
TRYING TO LIMIT THE
SURVEILLANCE.

THAT'S RIGHT.

BOTH EARLY CRITICS ARE NOW
INTRODUCING LEGISLATION THAT
WOULD LIMIT DATA COLLECTION ON
AMERICANS WHERE THERE IS NO,
WHAT THEY CALL, DEMONSTRABLE OR
VERIFIABLE LINK TO TERRORISM OR
ESPIONAGE.

THE STATEMENT READS IN PART, THE
DISCLOSURES OF THE LAST WEEK
HAVE MADE CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE THE LAW IS BEING
INTERPRETED IN A WAY THAT
DAMAGES THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES
AND THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET
UP TO KEEP AMERICANS UNAWARE OF
THE INTRUSION.

NSA WHISTLE BLOWERS ARE RAISING
NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A PROGRAM
PUBLICLY DESCRIBED BY THE FBI
DIRECTOR DURING CONGRESSIONAL
TESTIMONY TWO YEARS AGO.

IN THE WAKE OF THE FT.HOOD
TERRORIST ATTACK WHICH ALLOWS
FOR THE COLLECTION OF E-MAIL
FROM A U.S. CITIZEN ON U.S.

SOIL
IN REAL-TIME.

WE PUT IN PLACE TECHNOLOGICAL
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE
CAPABILITIES OF A DATABASE TO
PULL TOGETHER PAST E-MAILS AND
FUTURE ONES AS THEY COME IN.

SO THAT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN
INDIVIDUALIZED SEARCH.

THE DATABASE IS SEPARATE FROM
THE P.R.I.S.M. PROGRAM, THE NSA
REFERRED FOX TO THE FBI AND
THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT
BY THE BUREAU WHERE THEY WERE
STUDYING THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE
TESTIMONY.

THANK YOU, MA'AM.

THE BRITS ARE YOU NO
REPORTEDLY WARNING AIRLINES, DO
NOT LET ED SNOWDEN ON ANY
FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.

BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL
NOT ALLOW HIM INTO THE COUNTRY.

AND THEY'RE THREATENING TO FINE
AIRLINES MORE THAN $3,000 IF HE
DOES GO INTO THE U.K.
THAT WILL DO IT.

I MEAN, $3,000.

THAT WILL BRING THE AIRLINE
DOWN.

NOW ONE COMMUNIST BACKED
NEWSPAPER IN CHINA IS SUGGESTING
THE GOVERNMENT HANG ON TO
SNOWDEN FOR A WHILE.

TRACE GALLAGHER, THIS GOVERNMENT
IS CALLING TO GET OUT OF HIM
WHAT THEY CAN.

EXACTLY.

MILK HIM OF ALL HIS INFORMATION
AND THEN SEND HIM BACK TO THE
UNITED STATES.

THEY BELIEVE THE SECRETS HE HAS
ARE VITAL TO CHINESE NATIONAL
SECURITY AND NATIONAL INTERESTS.

NOW, KEEP IN MINE THIS EDITORIAL
COMES ON THE HEEL OF SNOWDEN
SAYING THE U.S. HAS BEEN SPYING
ON HONG KONG AND CHINESE
COMPUTERS FOR YEARS.

IT READS IN PART, QUOTING HERE,
MAYBE HE HAS MORE EVIDENCE.

THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
LET HIM SPEAK OUT AND ACCORDING
TO WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS
PUBLIC, USE IT AS EVIDENCE TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITED STATES
OPENLY OR IN PRIVATE.

THE EDITORIAL WAS WRITTEN BY A
NEWSPAPER THAT HAS LONG
CRITICIZED THE UNITED STATES BUT
CHINA EXPERT GORDON CHENG
BELIEVES SNOWDEN TRULY IS A
BARGAINING CHIP.

LISTEN.

CLEARLY, BEIJING IS NOW IN A
CAT BIRD SEAT.

IT CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO KEEP
HIM OR SEND HIM BACK.

THE CHINESE WHO ARE RUTHLESSLY
PRACTICING MATTIC WILL DO
EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

I THINK THAT GLOBAL TIMES
EDITORIAL THAT YOU REFERRED TO
IS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING THE
PRICE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PAY TO GET SNOWDEN BACK.

WHEN WE GET HIM BACK, HE WILL
HAVE DISCLOSED EVERYTHING TO
BEIJING.

NOW "THE LOS ANGELES TIMES"
IS RT ROING THAT SNOWDEN SNUCK
THE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS OUT OF
THE U.S. ON A THUMB DRIVE LIKE
THIS.

YOU KNOW THE KIND YOU BUY AT
STAPLES OR BEST BUY FOR $10.

NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS TELL
FOX NEWS CHANNEL THAT THUMB
DRIVES AND OTHER OUTSIDE STORAGE
DEVICES ARE FROWNED UPON.

BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A SYSTEMS
ADMINISTRATOR HE WOULD HAVE MORE
LATITUDE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF
STORAGE DEVICE ON HIM.

CBS IS CONFIRMING THAT
SOMEBODY HACKED ONE OF ITS
COMPUTERS MORE THAN ONCE LAST
YEAR.

CORRESPONDENT CHERYL ATKINSON
REPORTED THE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
LAST MONTH AND NOW THE NETWORK
REPORTS AN INTRUDER ACCESSED HER
COMPUTER REMOTELY AND TRIED VERY
HARD TO REMOVE HER INFORMATION.

NOW WORD ON WHETHER THEY GOT ANY
INFORMATION AND NO COMMENT FROM
THE FBI.
