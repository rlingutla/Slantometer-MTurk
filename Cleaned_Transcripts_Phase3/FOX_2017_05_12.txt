AND THE MASSIVE CYBER ATTACK
ACROSS THE WORLD TODAY HAS
AFFECTED 74 COUNTRIES.

OFFICIALS IN GREAT BRITAIN SAID
IT HIT THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH
SYSTEM, WHICH IT DID.

THEN THE PRIME MINISTER, THERESA
MAY, SAID THE ATTACK HAD A
BIGGER IMPACT THAN THAT.

IT REPORTEDLY INVOLVED A LEAKED
HACKING TOOL FROM THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY.

THIS IS STILL DEVELOPING.

74 COUNTRIES AFFECTED.

LOOKS LIKE 2,400 DIFFERENT
VICTIMS IN THIS THING.

WORD IS STILL COMING IN.
