ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT,
DAMAGE CONTROL.

AFTER THE EXPLOSIVE EXPOSURE OF
OUR NATION'S SPY PROGRAM.

TONIGHT, NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE
SOURCE OF FORMER CIA EMPLOYEE,
AND NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MANY
PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR
NATION'S TOP SECRETS.

AN INTERNATIONAL MANHUNT FOR THE
29-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO SAYS HE'S
THE ONE WHO EXPOSED THE
GOVERNMENT SECRET SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM.

WHAT HE TOLD "THE GUARDIAN"
NEWSPAPER IN A STORY PUBLISHED
LAST WEEK CAUSED A FIRESTORM OF
CONTROVERSY OVER PRIVACY AND
NATIONAL SECURITY.

EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS BEEN
IDENTIFIED AS A CONTRACTOR WHO
WORKED AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY, AND YESTERDAY FROM
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD, HE
STEPPED FROM THE SHADOWS,
ADMITTING HE WAS THE LEAK.

AND TONIGHT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
IS HOT ON SNOWDEN'S TAIL AS IT
INVESTIGATES WHETHER OR NOT HE
BROKE THE LAW BY SHARING
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

THEY HAVE LAUNCHED THE MANHUNT
FOR.

THE 29-YEAR-OLD NSA CONTRACTOR,
EDWARD SNOWDEN, HAS TURNED THE
MASSIVE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
INSIDE OUT.

FEDERAL AGENTS AT THE HOME TODAY
OF EDWARD SNOWDEN'S MOTHER IN
ELLICOTT CITY, MARYLAND, ONLY
MILES FROM THE NSA IN FT. MEADE.

ARE YOU GUYS WITH THE FBI?

POLITELY DUCKED REPORTERS.

PLEASE DO NOT GET IN MY WAY.

THANK YOU.

HAVE A GOOD DAY.

UP AT HIS FATHER'S HOME NEAR
ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA.

MY NAME IS EDWARD SNOWDEN.

I WORK FOR BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON
AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE NSA
GUARDIAN, THE 29-YEAR-OLD WAS A
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

HE ENLISTED IN THE ARMY, BUT WAS
DISCHARGED FIVE MONTHS LATER FOR
BREAKING BOTH LEGS IN A TRAINING
ACCIDENT.

WORKED FOR THE CIA UNDERCOVER IN
GENEVA AND SAYS HE BECAME
DISILLUSIONED.

SIGNED UP FOR A MILITARY
CONTRACTOR AT A BASE IN JAPAN.

HE JOINED BOOZ ALLEN HAM 8 ON
THE WORKING IN HAWAII.

AND A MONTH LATER HE COPIED TOP
SECRET DOCUMENTS AND THEN FLEW
TO HONG KONG TO MEET WITH GLENN
GREENWALD OF "THE GUARDIAN."

SNOWDEN SAYS HAVING BECOME
HARDENED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS.

HE TOLD "THE GUARDIAN" --
 I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY THAT
SITS IN THE OFFICE DAY TO DAY
AND
WATCHES WHAT IS HAPPENING AND
THINK THIS IS NOT OUR PLACE TO
DECIDE.

THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO DECIDE
WHETHER THESE ARE RIGHT OR
WRONG.

THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE FELT
SO COMPELLED TO INFORM HIS
CITIZENS ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES
THIS MASSIVE SURVEILLANCE
HIS HOME IN HAWAII, AND HE MAY
HAVE LEFT HONG KONG AS WELL.

HONG KONG DOES HAVE AN
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S.
AND A RECORD OF CLOSE
COOPERATION, BUT EXTRADITION
COULD TAKE MONTHS, AND CHINA HAS
A VETO.

NO ACTION CAN BE TAKEN UNTIL
THERE IS A CHARGE.

PLUS SNOWDEN STILL HAS TO BE
FOUND.

THE U.S. WHAT DO THE CHINESE
KNOW?

OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD BE
CONCERNED IF SOME OF THE VERY
SENSITIVE INFORMATION HE HAS
WOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.

SECRET LEAKS GUT-WRENCHING.

THE DAMAGE THAT THESE
REVELATIONS INCUR ARE HUGE.

SECRETARY CANCELED A TRIP TO
WASHINGTON TODAY TO DEFEND
COOPERATING WITH THE NSA.

THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN
AND REMAINS ESSENTIAL TO THE
SECURITY OF BOTH NATIONS.

SUPPORTERS IN NEW YORK TODAY,
SNOWDEN IS COURAGEOUS.

JULIAN ASSANGE OF WIKILEAKS
CALLED HIM A HERO.

MICHAEL MOORE TWEETED HERO OF
THE YEAR.

MANY AGREE THE POWER OF THE NSA
COULD BE THEY'RE ROAD.

WE NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED
JUDGMENT IF WE NEED MORE CIVIL
LIBERTIES PROTECTIONS IN THE
LAW.

WITH SO LITTLE FOREIGN EDUCATION
TO HANDLE SUCH SENSITIVE
SECRETS?

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY THE
REAL WHIZ KIDS ARE KIDS, THE
GENERATION THAT LEARNED
COMPUTERS EVEN BEFORE THEY COULD
TALK.

SNOWDEN IS ONE OF THE MILLION
AMERICAN GRANTED INTELLIGENCE
CLEARANCES, CARRYING OUT MANY OF
THE GOVERNMENT'S INTELLIGENCE
FUNCTIONS.

BUT IT DOES RAISE QUESTIONS
WHETHER TOO MANY CONTRACTORS ARE
NOW IN ON THE GOVERNMENT'S
SECRETS.

INTELLIGENCE INVOLVES SPIES FROM
THE CIA, EAVESDROPPING BY THE
SUPER SECRET NSA, AND
INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE
PENTAGON.

BUT THERE IS ALSO A HUGE SHADOW
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OF
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS, SOME OF
THEM CORPORATIONS WITH FAMILIAR
NAMES.

AFTER 9/11, WHEN THE GOVERNMENT
FAILED TO CONNECT THE DOTS, THE
DEMAND FOR PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE
EXPLODED, LEADING TO WHAT A
FORMER OFFICIAL CALLED A HIRING
BINGE OF BATTALIONS OF YOUNG,
SMART NERDS.

WHAT ONCE STARTED AS A
PROCESS OF AUGMENTING AND
FIGHTING THE WAR ON TERRORISM
HAS NOW BECOME AN INDUSTRIAL
SYSTEM.

IT'S AN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM THAT
WORKS ON A PROFIT MOTIVE.

COMPLEX IN FT. MEADE, MARYLAND
THERE ARE NOW OFFICE BUILDINGS
FULL OF CONTRACTORS.

ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT,
ALMOST FIVE MILLION INDIVIDUALS
NOW HOLD SECURITY CLEARANCES.

1.4 MILLION OF THEM TOP SECRET.

ONE-THIRD HELD BY PRIVATE
CONTRACTORS.

A CHECK OF THE JOB WEBSITE
MONSTER.COM TODAY SHOWED 796 JOB
OPENINGS REQUIRING TOP SECRET
CLEARANCES.

THE CURRENT DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, JAMES CLAPPER,
WORKED FOR PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT JOBS AND
NOW WORKS FOR BOOZ ALLEN.

MANY CONTRACTORS HAVE
INTELLIGENCE OR MILITARY
EXPERIENCE, BUT OTHERS ARE
20-SOMETHING TECHNICIANS LIKE
EDWARD SNOWDEN.

THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED
NECESSARILY BY PATRIOTISM.

THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED
NECESSARILY BY A SCAR OF 9/11.

THIS IS A JOB.

THE RISK, INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS
ARGUE THAT PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
NOW ARE CRITICAL, EVEN
INDISPENSABLE.

THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
TELL ME THAT THEY SIMPLY COULD
NOT FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT
THE PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY, AND
EXPERTISE OF THESE PRIVATE
CONTRACTORS.

WITH THE NATION'S SECURITY AT
STAKE.
