AMERICA NEEDS TO PAY
ATTENTION TO THOSE REPORTS
OF A MASSIVE AND DEADLY
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN
SYRIA.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

BUT HE ALSO EXPLAINED WHY
IT COULD HURT US BIG TIME
IF THE U.S. GETS TOO
INVOLVED.

PLUS, A GRIM MILESTONE ON
THE NUMBER OF CHILD
REFUGEES NOW TRYING TO
ESCAPE THAT BLOODY CIVIL
WAR.

PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING
CLEAR IS HE IN NO RUSH TO
GET THE U.S. MILITARY
INVOLVED IN SYRIA'S
2-YEAR-OLD CIVIL WAR EVEN
AMID MOUNTING CLAIMS THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGAIN
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE THE
SITUATION IN SYRIA IS VERY
DIFFICULT.

AND THE NOTION THAT THE
U.S. CAN SOMEHOW SOLVE WHAT
IS A SECTARIAN, COMPLEXED
PROBLEM INSIDE OF SYRIA
SOMETIMES IS OVERSTATED.

BUT DELAY CAN BE DEADLY,
RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT.

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT
WHEN YOU START SEEING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED ON A
LARGE SCALE AND AGAIN
WE'RE STILL GATHERING
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR EVENT BUT IT IS
VERY TROUBLESOME.

OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS A
HIGH LEVEL MEETING
YESTERDAY TO DISCUSS
AMERICA'S OPTIONS.

OF COURSE, ALL THIS IS
UNFOLDING AS THE PRESIDENT
WRAPS UP A TWO-DAY BUS TOUR
THROUGH NEW YORK AND
PENNSYLVANIA TO TALK ABOUT
HIS PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY.

ED HENRY IS TRAVELING WITH
THE PRESIDENT.

THIS BUS TOUR WAS SUPPOSED
TO BEEN ALL ABOUT DOMESTIC
ISSUES.

ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE
THE PRESIDENT FACING A
CREDIBILITY TEST.

ONE WEEK AGO THIS WEEK THAT
HE DREW THAT RED LINE ON
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SARA I
CAN'TENNED A PROMISED THERE
WOULD BE ENORMOUS
CONSEQUENCES IF SYRIA
CROSSED THAT RED LINE.

NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN
CROSSED SEVERAL TIMES AND
POSSIBLY YET AGAIN THIS
WEEK WITH A MASSIVE
CHEMICAL ATTACK THAT KILLED
UP TO 1800 PEOPLE.

IS HE UNDER PRESSURE TO ACT
IN THAT CNN INTERVIEW THAT
YOU REFERRED TO THE
PRESIDENT LASHED OUT AT
SYRIA OVER THIS ALLEGED
ATTACK, SAID HE IS STILL  EVIDENCE
TO
COME IN.

STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING HE
WOULD USE MILITARY ACTION
LEADING TO CONSERVATIVES TO
CHARGE THAT HE IS DODDLING.

JUMPING IN TO STUFF THAT
DOES NOT TURN OUT WELL.

GETS US MIRED IN VERY
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.

CAN RESULT IN US BEING
DRAWN IN TO VERY EXPENSIVE,
DIFFICULT, COSTLY
INTERVENTIONS THAT ACTUALLY
BREED MORE RESENTMENT IN
THE REGION.

WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH
STRATEGICALLY WHAT'S GOING
TO BE IN OUR LONG-TERM
NATIONAL INTEREST EVEN AS
WE WORK COOPERATIVELY
INTERNATIONALLY TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT
PRESSURE ON THOSE WHO WOULD
KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

THE POLICY IS FOCUSED
AROUND NOT GETTING INVOLVED
SO FAR 100,000 DEAD MOSTLY
KILLED BY BULLETS OR
WHISTLES.

HARD TO SAY HOW 1,000 OR
COUPLE HUNDRED DEAD FROM A
CHEMICAL WEAPON WHILE
DEPLORABLE WOULD IMPACT HIS
CALCULUS.

NOW, WHAT'S NEXT?

THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY
RULED OUT U.S. GROUND
TROOPS IN SARA I CAN'T.

BUT I'M TOLD THAT THAT HIGH
LEVEL MEETING AT THE WHITE
HOUSE YESTERDAY THAT YOU
MENTIONED ONE OPTION THAT
IS BEING DISCUSSED IS U.S.
AIR STRIKES IN SYRIA AND
POSSIBLY WHOSE MISSILES TO
SEND A MESSAGE TO SYRIAN
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD.

WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE
CONTINUES TO HEDGE ITS
RESPONSE.

BRITAIN'S TOP DIPLOMAT
TODAY WAS A LITTLE MORE
BLUNT.

THE ONLY POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION OF WHAT WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO SEE IS THAT IT
WAS A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

CLEARLY MANY, MANY HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

SOME OF THE ESTIMATES ARE
WELL OVER A THOUSAND.

THERE IS NO OTHER PLAUSIBLE
EXPLANATION FOR CASUALTIES,
SO INTENSE AND SUCH A SMALL
AS THE FRENCH DID YESTERDAY
IN THE POSSIBILITY OF USING
FORCE.

JONATHAN THE SYRIAN FORCES
STILL CLAIM THEY DID NOT
CARRY OUT THIS ATTACK.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
INTERESTINGLY DENYING THAT
A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
TOOK PLACE BUT SAYING AS
THEIR RUSSIAN ALLIES HAVE
ALSO IMPLIED THAT THE
ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY
THE REBELS TO GAIN SYMPATHY
AND PRO-VEHICLE
INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION
THERE ARE FEW WHO BELIEVE
THAT CLAIM.

BRITAIN, TURKEY, AND FRANCE
LEADING THE WAY AND
POINTING FINGERS PRETTY
DIRECTLY AT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND
DEMANDING THAT THOSE U.N.

WEAPONS INSPECTORS WHO HAVE
ALREADY ARRIVED IN DAMASCUS
NOW BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO
THE SITE OF THE ALLEGED
ATTACK.

BUT THERE ARE FEW SIGNS
TONIGHT, JON, THAT THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT
TO PROVIDE THOSE WEAPONS
INSPECTORS WITH SAFE
PASSAGE FOR THE ADMITTEDLY
DANGEROUS 15 MINUTE
JOURNEY.

FROM THAT HOTEL TO THE SITE
OF THE ATTACK JON.

GIVING US A LOOK AT HOW
SYRIA'S CIVIL WAR IS
EFFECTS THE CHILDREN THERE.

U.N. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCING
TODAY THAT OF THE 2 MILLION
REFUGEES THAT HAVE FLED THE
FIGHTING IN SYRIA,
1 MILLION ARE CHILDREN.

1 MILLION CHILDREN HAVING
FLED TO NEIGHBORING
COUNTRIES LIKE TURKEY
JORDAN, AND LEBANON.

1 MILLION CHILDREN NOW
WITHOUT HERMINE, CHILDREN
LIKE THESE LISTEN.

ALL I WISH IS THAT SYRIA
COULD BECOME PEACEFUL
AGAIN, THAT'S ALL I WANT
FOR THE TROUBLE TO STOP.

I LOVE SIERRA AND I MISS
SYRIA.

I LOVED MY FRIENDS AND
PLAYING WITH MY SIS IS
TERES, WE USED TO PLAY
TOGETHER.

WE USED TO RIDE A BICYCLE
TOGETHER AND PLAY WITH
TOYS.

NOW, TO PUT THAT
1 MILLION FIGURE IN
PERSPECTIVE, U.N. OFFICIALS
POINT OUT THAT IT IS AS IF
EVERY SINGLE CHILD HAD BEEN
FORCED TO LEAVE THE CITIES
OF L.A. AND BOSTON
COMBINED JON.
