TONIGHT, THE WORLD WATCHING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

THE PRESIDENT DECLARES SYRIA HAS
CROSSED MORE THAN A RED LINE,
THAT ASSAD HAS CROSSED SEVERAL
LINES.

ON THE WORLD STAGE, THE
PRESIDENT SAYS HIS POSITION ON
ASSAD, ON SYRIA, HAS CHANGED
AFTER SEEING THE IMAGES OF THE
FAMILIES, THE CHILDREN, THE
VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK.

WILL THE U.S. TAKE ACTION?

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN FRONT OF THE WORLD ON
SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL ASSAD, ON
THE APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK
THAT KILLED SO MANY FAMILIES AND
CHILDREN.

THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNING THE
ATTACK, CALLING IT QUOTE, AN
AFFRONT TO HUMANITY.

SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

THE GRAPHIC IMAGES SEEN AROUND
THE WORLD.

MORE THAN 80 MEN, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN DYING.

THOSE WHO DID SURVIVE GASPING
FOR AIR.

WHAT THE WORLD WAS WAITING FOR
NEXT, WAS WORD FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

HOW HE'LL HANDLE THIS, WILL THE
U.S. ACT?

TONIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR WHAT HE
SAID.

THE PRESIDENT FIRMLY CONDEMNED
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN
SYRIA, PLACING THE BLAMING
-- BLAME SQUARELY ON THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT.

IT IS A TERRIBLE AFFRONT TO
HUMANITY, I CAN TELL YOU.

TERRIBLE.

JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE
ROSE GARDEN, HE SUGGESTED THERE
SHOULD BE RETALIATION.

THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
ASSAD REGIME CANNOT BE
TOLERATED.

AND AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SAID THE
U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED.

TWEETING "SYRIA IS NOT OUR
PROBLEM" WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
PROPOSED PROTECTING CIVILIANS.

AND AFTER ASSAD'S MASSIVE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN 2013,
HE TWEETED "DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA,
FIX U.S.A."
ADDING, "IF YOU DO MANY BAD
THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT
FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!"

BUT NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES HAVE
CHANGED HIS VIEWS ON THE ASSAD
REGIME.

INNOCENT CIVILIANS SUFFERING
FROM THIS WEEK'S ATTACK, MORE
THAN 80 DEAD.

HERE A FATHER CLUTCHES HIS TWIN
9-MONTH-OLD BABIES, BOTH OF THEM
KILLED.

TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, TALK
OF A CHANGED SYRIAN POLICY.

I DO CHANGE.

AND I AM FLEXIBLE.

AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
FLEXIBILITY.

AND I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK
ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY, HAD A BIG
IMPACT ON ME.

BIG IMPACT.

AND IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE,
AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S
ALREADY HAPPENED, THAT MY
ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD
HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT
ACKNOWLEDGES IT'S NOW HIS
CHALLENGE TO SOLVE.

I NOW HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND
I WILL HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY
AND CARRY IT VERY PROUDLY, I
WILL TELL YOU THAT.

IT IS NOW MY RESPONSIBILITY.

IF I COULD JUST QUICKLY ASK
YOU IF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS
CROSSES A RED LINE FOR YOU?

IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
ME.

WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
INNOCENT BABIES -- BABIES,
LITTLE BABIES -- WITH A CHEMICAL
GAS THAT IS SO LETHAL.

PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT
GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES MANY,
MANY LINES, BEYOND A RED LINE.

MANY, MANY LINES.

WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS I
THINK YOU'VE NOTICED ABOUT ME IS
MILITARILY, I DON'T LIKE TO SAY
WHERE I'M GOING AND WHAT I'M
DOING.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE TELLING YOU.

ABDULLAH MADE IT CLEAR, THE
WORLD IS LOOKING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

I BELIEVE UNDER YOUR
LEADERSHIP WE WILL BE ABLE TO
UNRAVEL THIS VERY COMPLICATED
SITUATION.

PREDECESSOR, IS PROMISING TO
TAKE ACTION.

THE WORLD IS A MESS.

I INHERITED A MESS.

WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.

WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.

THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR HE
WON'T SAY WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

BUT DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF TIME
LINE FOR POSSIBLE ACTION HERE?

WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY
THIS IS VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA.

IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
CHAIRED A MEETING OF HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAYING THAT SYRIA CROSSED
NOT ONLY A RED LINE, BUT SEVERAL
LINES.

WE ALSO SAW U.N. AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY HOLDING UP PICTURES
TODAY SAYING, IF THE U.N.

DOESN'T ACT THE U.S. MAY HAVE
TO.

HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE
TO DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?

THE UNITED STATES SEES
YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AS A DISGRACE
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

AN ASSURANCE THAT HUMANITY MEANS
NOTHING TO THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT.

WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS
CONSISTENTLY FAILS IN ITS DUTY
TO ACT COLLECTIVELY, THERE ARE
TIMES WHERE WE ARE COMPELLED TO
TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.

YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
HAS CHANGED.

WE JUST HEARD AMBASSADOR HALEY
SAY, AT TIMES WE'RE QUOTE,
COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN
ACTION.

FOR AMERICANS AT HOME TONIGHT
WONDERING WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN,
WHAT'S NEXT?

WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE?

DO THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER
ATTACKS?

DO THEY JUST WANT TO PUNISH OR
DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
BASHAR AL ASSAD?

WE DON'T KNOW.

IN 2013, THERE WERE ARRAY OF AIR
STRIKES WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
SAID THEY CROSSED THE RED LINE.

THEY DIDN'T USE THEM.

THEY STILL HAD THAT
INTELLIGENCE.

BUT MOST OF THOSE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THE STOCKPILES, ARE
GONE SO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
USED HERE WERE HIDDEN.

THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

AND AS WE HEARD, THEY MET
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
TODAY.
