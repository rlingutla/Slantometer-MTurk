HURRICANE MARIA ROARING ACROSS
THE CARIBBEAN NOW LEAVING BEHIND
ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION.

MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN PUERTO
RICO NOW GETTING AN IDEA OF JUST
HOW MUCH THEY LOST WHEN THE
STORM SCOURED THEIR ISLAND.

WINDS SO POWERFUL, THEY RIPPED
CONCRETE BALCONIES OFF OF WALLS
AND NOW MARIA HEADED FOR THE
TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE
BAHAMAS.

SADLY WE'RE WATCHING ANOTHER
UNFOLDING CATASTROPHE AND WORD
THAT PARTS OF PUERTO RICO COULD
BE WITHOUT POWER FOR NOT WEEKS
BUT MONTHS.

THAT'S AS HURRICANE MARIA
CONTINUES ITS DEADLY TREK
THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN.

THE LATEST STORM TRACK AND HOW
THE UNITED STATES' MAINLAND MAY
BE AFFECTED.

GAINING STRENGTH AS IT'S MOVING
ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN.

AS PUERTO RICANS LOOK AT THE
DAMAGE THAT THE MAYOR OF THE
CAPITOL CITY SAYS SOME PLACES
COULD BE WITHOUT POWER FOR SIX
MONTHS.

MARIA IS BRINGING CATASTROPHIC
FLOODING TO PUERTO RICO.

THE STORM HIT THE ISLAND AS A
CATEGORY FOUR STORM, 155 MILES
AN HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS.

THE STRONGEST HURRICANE
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER TO HIT PUERTO
RICO IN MORE THAN 80 YEARS.

RESCUE WORKERS TODAY DEALING
WITH DOWNED STREETS AND FLOODING
STREETS AS THEY TRY TO REACH
VICTIMS THAT NEED HELP.

THE STORM DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF
HOMES AND KNOCKED OUT
ELECTRICITY TO THE ISLAND AND
BROUGHT DOWN CELL PHONE TOWERS
AND LEAVING MOST PEOPLE UNABLE
TO CALL FOR HELP OR CALL FOR
FAMILY MEMBERS.

MORE IMAGES TO SHARE IN THE
SLIDE SHOW THIS AFTERNOON.

THIS IS TYPICAL DAMAGE, I'M
TOLD.

A FLOODED GAS STATION ON THE
ISLAND'S EAST COAST.

THE SAME AREA, AMBULANCES
TRAPPED UNDER THE COLLAPSED
ROOF.

THE ROAD LITTERED WITH POLES AND
POWER LINES.

LOOK AT THAT.

THINK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO
FREE UP THIS ROAD AND FREE UP
THE POWER LINES?

THERE'S A WHOLE ISLAND LIKE
THAT.

HERE'S WHAT'S LEFT OF A HOUSE
NEXT TO THE SOUTHERN COAST.

THE ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR
SAID IT WILL BE A HISTORIC
EVENT.

AND THIS IS NEAR PUNTA CANA.

YOU CAN SEE A DAMAGED RESTAURANT
IN THE AREA.

A CATEGORY THREE STORM BY THE
TIME IT BATTERED THAT ISLAND
TODAY WITH WINDS SUSTAINED AT
NEARLY 115 MILES AN HOUR.

FORECASTERS SAY MARIA REGAINED
MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS AS IT
MOVED OFF THE COAST OF THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TODAY.

THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
HERE IN THE U.S. REPORTS THAT
MARIA IS EXPECTED TO BRING
DANGEROUS WINDS, HEAVY WIND TO
THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS AND
THE BAHAMAS LATER TODAY.

MORE AHEAD IN THE FORECAST.

WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHITE
SPREAD DAMAGE IN ST. CROIX AND
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.

IT WAS A CAT FIVE MONSTER WHEN
IT PASSED OVER-TUESDAY.

THERE'S MORE FLOODING IN
ST. THOMAS.

STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN WITH
MORE.

A COUPLE OF FEET OF FLOODING
AROUND THESE APARTMENTS.

MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR BALCONIES.

THEY'RE WITHOUT ELECTRIC POWER.

PEOPLE TRUDGING THROUGH THIS
WATER WITH STICKS AS GUIDES.

OLDER PEOPLE GETTING HELP.

IT'S TOUGH TO SEE PEOPLE WALK
THROUGH WITH CHILDREN ON THEIR
BACKS OR CARRYING THEIR ITEMS IN
PLASTIC.

SOME WOMAN OVER HERE CHOP UP
WOOD WITH MACHETES AND HAMMERS
AND BUILD A COOKOUT.

IT'S OUTDOOR LIVING AT THE MOST
PRIMITIVE.

WE'VE SEEN A HYDRANT USED AS A
BATH THIS MORNING, SHEPARD.

GETTING THE HELP IN THE EARLY
GOING?

WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PEOPLE
INSIDE THEIR APARTMENTS OFTEN
WITH FLOOD WATER AND HOLES IN
THE ROOFS, THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT
GETTING ANYTHING.

IT'S A DO-IT-YOURSELF OPERATION.

IT'S PEOPLE TAKING RUBBISH FROM
HURRICANE IRMA AND TRYING TO USE
IT TO PROP UP A POWER LINE THAT
WAS DOWNED BY HURRICANE MARIA.

USING ONE HURRICANE TO HELP
ANOTHER.

HELP IS ON THE WAY FROM FEMA AND
FROM THE COAST GUARD.

RIGHT NOW MOODS ARE GOOD HERE.

THE PEOPLE ARE RESILIENT.

WITHOUT HELP QUICKLY, THAT COULD
STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN.

LET'S GET MORE ON THE
HURRICANE'S PATH.

IT'S STILL ON THE MOVE AND HEAD
ADD CROSS THE CARIBBEAN.

CHIEF METEOROLOGIST RICK
REICHMUTH IN THE EXTREME WEATHER
CENTER.

TURKS AND CAICOS WILL BE SPOT
THAT TAKES THE WORST OF IT.

WINDS 20 TO 50 MILES AN HOUR.

STILL MORE RAIN HERE.

FLOODING.

THE TURKS AND CAICOS, IT WILL
GET THERE CLOSE TONIGHT AND
TOMORROW.

THAT SAID, WE'RE WATCHING
TROPICAL STORM JOSE.

UP HERE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.

THAT HAS CREATED A WEAKNESS IN
THE ATMOSPHERE.

IT'S GOING TO ALLOW MARIA TO
MOVE TO THE NORTH.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR RELIABLE
COMPUTER GUIDANCE RIGHT NOW,
PULLS THIS UP BETWEEN BERMUDA
AND THE U.S.
AT THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
GOING TO STAY BETWEEN THAT AREA.

IT'S A SLOW-MOVING STORM.

WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT
A WEEK OR SO BEFORE IT GETS INTO
THIS AREA.

MORE PROBLEMS FOR THE COAST.

CERTAINLY BEACH EROSION.

AS LONG AS WE THREAT THIS NEEDLE
BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE EAST
COAST, I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING
GOOD.

THE OFFICIAL TRACK FROM THE
NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SHOWS
THAT.

KEEPING THIS WELL OFFSHORE AND
THEN EVENTUALLY BY THURSDAY TO
FRIDAY OUT TO SEE.

ANY BIG IMPACTS ACROSS THE U.S.
WON'T BE FELT.
