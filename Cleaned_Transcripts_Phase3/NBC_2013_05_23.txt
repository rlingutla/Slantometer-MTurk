IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, DARKENED
SKIES AGAIN TODAY AS THE FIRST
FUNERALS WERE HELD FOR THE 24
VICTIMS OF MONDAY'S TORNADO, 10
OF THEM CHILDREN.

FOR THE SURVIVORS, THIS IS ALSO
A DAY TO RECONNECT AND START
MOVING FORWARD AGAIN.

IT'S JUST WHAT THEY DIDN'T NEED
HERE, THUNDERSTORMS AND
FLOODING, PUTTING THIS COMMUNITY
ON EDGE AND SHUTTING DOWN
CLEANUP EFFORTS FOR SEVERAL
HOURS.

AND IT CAME ON A DAY WHEN
STUDENTS AND PARENTS WERE TAKING
THEIR FIRST STEPS TOWARDS
SOMETHING RESEMBLING NORMAL.

THE CHILDREN OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
HEADED BACK TO SCHOOL TODAY,
DAYS AFTER THE TORNADO RIPPED
THROUGH TWO OF THEIR BUILDINGS,
KILLING SEVEN OF THEIR
CLASSMATES.

HOW ARE YOU, SWEETHEART?

WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WE
JUST GOT TO SAY HI TO EACH OTHER
AGAIN.

TWO DEVASTATED SCHOOLS WERE SENT
TO OTHER SCHOOLS FOR THE FINAL
ASSEMBLY, A CHANCE FOR CLOSURE,
TO SEE FRIENDS, TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

THIS WILL BRING A LITTLE MORE
IMPACT TO WHAT HAPPENED, BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE SOME OF
YOUR FRIENDS, THOUGH.

WE DIDN'T GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO OUR CLASSES, AND IT WAS
REALLY GOOD TO SEE THEM AND TO
BE ABLE TO LOVE ON THEM.

OPPORTUNITY TO RECONNECT, AND IN
SOME CASES, EXPRESS THANKS TO
TEACHERS FOR GUARDING WHAT EVERY
PARENT CHERISHES MOST.

I'M NEVER GOING TO HAVE
ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, ANY WORDS
TO, YOU KNOW, TO REPAY HER FOR
WHAT SHE DID.

YOU KNOW, SHE THREW HERSELF ON
MY DAUGHTER TO PROTECT HER.

AS MOORE BURIED THE FIRST OF ITS
24 VICTIMS.

9-YEAR-OLD ANTONIO CANNED ALERO
WAS LAID TO REST.

SHE'S AMONG THE SEVEN CHILDREN
WHO DIED WHEN THE TORNADO
FLATTENED PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY.

EXPERTS COUNSELING CHILDREN HERE
SAY THE SURVIVING STUDENTS ARE
VICTIMS, TOO, LIKELY TRAUMATIZED
BY WHAT THEY SAW MONDAY, WHO
THEY DIDN'T SEE TODAY.

PARENTS JUST NEED TO SPEAK
HONESTLY WITH THEIR CHILDREN BUT
TO ALSO REASSURE THEM THAT THERE
ARE PEOPLE WORKING THAT THEY
DON'T EVEN SEE TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEY'RE SAFE.

FLOODING IN THE REGION MADE
CLEANUP ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE EARLY
TODAY, BUT UTILITY CREWS AND
TRASH HAULERS WERE ABLE TO GET
OUT LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

FOR A COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERED A
LIFETIME OF HEARTACHE, IN ONLY
DAYS, ONE CHILD'S WORDS MAY SUM
UP MOORE'S RESILIENT SPIRIT.

IT MAKES ME REAL GLAD BECAUSE
SOME OF MY HOUSE GOT RIPPED
DOWN, AND IT MAKES ME GLAD TO
SEE MY FRIENDS AND THAT THEY'RE
ALIVE AND THAT I'M ALIVE AND
THAT I'M OKAY.

SO, THAT'S ALL.

OFFICIALS HAVE DRASTICALLY
REVISED DOWNWARD THE NUMBER OF
HOMES DAMAGED HERE.

IT IS 1,200, NOT 13,000.

A BIT OF GOOD NEWS.

UP NEXT, A INCREDIBLE
SURVIVAL STORY WE HAVEN'T HEARD
ABOUT UNTIL NOW.

A MOTHER IN LABOR AS THE TORNADO
CLOSED IN.

IN THE THREE DAYS SINCE THAT
DEVASTATING TORNADO IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, WE HAVE SEEN SO MUCH
DESTRUCTION, LOSS OF LIFE AND
MISERY.

BUT TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO
LEAVE YOU WITH THE STORY OF SOME
PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME TOGETHER TO
HELP, WHETHER IT'S CLEANING UP,
COOKING A MEAL OR EVEN HELPING
WITH A VERY SPECIAL DELIVERY.

EMBRACED HER NEWBORN SON AGAIN,
A TREASURED MOMENT AFTER GOING
INTO LABOR DURING AN EF-5
TORNADO.

IT JUST TOOK THE WALL OFF.

AND THE FIRST THING I DID, OF
COURSE, WAS ASK IF ALL THE
NURSES WERE STILL THERE AND IF
THEY WERE OKAY.

REUNITED WITH NURSES WHO MOVED
HER TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL WHEN
THEIRS TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

MY NURSE GAVE ME A SHOT TO
SLOW DOWN THE CONTRACTIONS, YOU
KNOW, TO KIND OF KEEP ME FROM
GOING INTO TRANSITION.

AND ACTUALLY HAVING A BABY IN
THE MIDST OF A TORNADO.

8 POUNDS 3 OUNCE BRADEN
EMANUEL, NOW THE TALK OF THE
TOWN.

HE'S A MIRACLE, AND I LOVE
THE NAME THAT SHE HAS FOR HIM,
EMANUEL, GOD IS WITH US, BECAUSE
GOD DEFINITELY WAS WITH US.

ARE WITH THE COMMUNITY, TOO,
COMING FROM NEAR AND FAR, SOME
TOTING BROOMS AND RAKES, OTHERS
CARRYING TRAYS OF STEAM PULLED
PORK, ALL IN THE SPIRIT, THEY
SAY, OF SIMPLY LOVING THY
NEIGHBOR.

IT'S OKLAHOMA.

IT'S JUST KIND OF THE WAY IT IS
HERE.

WE ALL RALLY TOGETHER WHEN
THERE'S A NEED.

MOBILIZE A TEAM QUICKLY.

HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

BEING BARBECUE COOKS DOING
COMPETITIONS WE LEARN HOW TO
COOK MOBILE.

RELIEF IS ALSO HERE, FIRST
COOKED UP DURING JOPLIN,
MISSOURI'S BRUSH WITH A TORNADO
TWO YEARS AGO.

THEY NEED COMFORT.

BARBECUE IS COMFORT FOOD.

TOUGH TODAY FOR MANY, HOPE AND
GRATITUDE ARE IN AMPLE SUPPLY.

THOSE WOMEN WERE, THEY WERE
GODSENDS.

THEY DID THEIR BEST TO TAKE CARE
OF ME.

ALREADY NICKNAMED TWISTER.
