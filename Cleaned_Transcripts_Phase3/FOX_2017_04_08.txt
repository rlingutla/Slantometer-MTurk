AMERICAN TOMAHAWK MISSILES
NEARLY LEVELING A SYRIAN AIRBASE
HANGER.

DEMOLISHED AND RUNWAYS DAMAGE
THE SYRIAN FORCES ARE LASHING
OUT AT REBEL TARGETS.

WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THE
GLOBAL REACTION POURS IN?

THE MAN WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN
LADEN SAYS DIPLOMACY MUST BE A
FACTOR.

THEIR PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON
PLANNING THIS SINCE 2003.

THE PLAN WILL BE THERE BUT AGAIN
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAR COME IS
GOING TO BE DIPLOMACY.

JULIE WE HAVE TO "FOX NEWS"
TEAM COVERAGE.

WE BEGIN WITH KRISTIN FISHER WHO
IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
THIS WEEKEND AT MAR-A-LAGO IN
FLORIDA AND KRISTIN IT'S BEEN
OVER 48 HOURS SINCE HE TOOK HIS
VERY FIRST BIG MILITARY ACTION
AS PRESIDENT.

ANY INDICATION OF HOW HE'S DOING
TONIGHT?

BY ALL ACCOUNTS PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S VERY PLEASED THAT HIS
DECISION TO STRIKE AND WITH HOW
IT'S PLAYING OUT.

HIS DECISION TO STRIKE HAS
RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PRAISE FROM
OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION.

THE SAUDI TEAM CALLED A
COURAGEOUS ACT AND SPRAYS BY
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON
CAPITOL HILL.

THE ONE AREA WHERE PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM
THAT WAS HIS DECISION TO ACT
WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BUT EVEN
ON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED
THAT DECISION TODAY IN A LETTER
TO CONGRESS.

HE WROTE THAT I ACTED IN THE
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND
FOREIGN-POLICY INTERESTS OF THE
UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO MY
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO
CONDUCT FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AS
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE.

THE U.S. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL
ACTION AS NECESSARY AND
APPROPRIATE TO FURTHER ITS
IMPORTANT NATIONAL INTERESTS.

THE TWO BIG TAKEAWAYS THERE ARE
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATING
WHAT THE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.
NIKKI HALEY SAID YESTERDAY, THAT
THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO TAKE
FURTHER ACTION IF NECESSARY IF
ASSAD DOES NOT STOP THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACKS AGAINST HIS OWN
PEOPLE AND THEN IT ALSO, THEY
SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES HE
CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WITHOUT
RECEIVING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
TO DO SO.

I AM SURE A LOT OF FOLKS ON
CAPITOL HILL WOULD DISAGREE WITH
THAT.

THE MAIN SOURCE OF CONFLICT IS
BETWEEN SENIOR ADVISER JARED
KUSHNER AND STEVE BANNON.

AND THEN OF COURSE IS A
NONINTERVENTIONIST.

HE BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD NOT
INTERVENE IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA
AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE
ARGUED AGAINST THE STRIKE.

LAST NIGHT AT THE PRESIDENTS
REQUEST THE TWO SAT DOWN AT
MAR-A-LAGO BUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL
DIVISIONS REMAIN.

ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PRETEND
TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE
PRESIDENT MAY FIND THEMSELVES
BACKTRACKING VERY QUICKLY WHAT
WE KNOW IS THE PRESIDENT IS THE
ONE WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHO IS
GOING TO LEAD.

THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING
ANY REPORTS OF A STAFF SHAKEUP
IS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM
THE GOOD WEEK THE PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S HAD.

JULIE TO SERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH
SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION?

I THINK THIS RIFT BETWEEN
BANNON AND KUSHNER IS INDICATIVE
OF THE CROSSROADS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS AT.

IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING TO
CONTINUE ON WITH HIS AMERICA
FIRST THEME INSTEAD OF COUNTRIES
LIKE SYRIA OR IS HE BECOMING A
BIT MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN
INTERVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT
HE WARNED AGAINST ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS HE NOW
TURNING ON RUSSIA A COUNTRY THAT
STRONGLY SUPPORTED BASHAR
AL-ASSAD ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE
HAVE BEEN ALL THESE REPORTS BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS HIS
ASSOCIATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOO
COZY WITH RUSSIA AND THERE ARE
SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO
WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF HIS
ASSOCIATES BROKE THE LAW.

ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH AND
THAT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
WILLING TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE.

HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE HIS MIND
TO DEFAULT.

THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS
EVOLVE INTO WHAT?

EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF POLICIES HE
GOING TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AND
WILL IT ALIGN WITH THE JARED
KUSHNER BRANCH OF THE WEST WING
OR WHAT SIDE MORE WITH STEVE
BANNON?

ATTACK APPARENTLY HAS
NOT SLOWED SYRIA DOWN MUCH.

THAT IS THE WORD.

JUST HOURS LATER SYRIAN
WARPLANES FROM OTHER BASES
APPARENTLY STRUCK OPPOSITION
TARGETS INCLUDING ONE NEAR THE
SITE OF A DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
WHICH PROVOKED THE U.S.

RESPONSE
OF THE VERY FIRST PLACE.

THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE JOHN
STRIKE WAS A GOOD START BUT MORE
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

I WOULD ARGUE FOR A NO-FLY
ZONE AND ARMING AND TRAINING THE
FREE SYRIAN ARMY.

AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST
CONTINUE TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQA
AND STOP THIS FLOW THAT IS
COMING OUT OF RAQQA AND BEING
SENT TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED
STATES TO PREVENT TERROR.

SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE
THE RIGHT FIRST STEP AND I THINK
HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

WHAT ELSE WOULD I GUESS WE LIKE
TO SEE AS FAR AS AIRSTRIKES INTO
SYRIA, WHAT MORE THEY TALKING
ABOUT?

JULIE TODAY AN OLD ARCH ENEMY
OF THE ASSAD REGIME TURKISH
FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THIS EARLY
TODAY IN TURKEY.

WE SEE THE U.S.

INTERVENTION
AS APPROPRIATE.

THIS IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER.

DEFENSE INTERVENTION OF AN
AIRBASE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE
IF WE DON'T REMOVE THE REGIME
FROM POWER AND THIS REMAINS A
COSMETIC INTERVENTION.

ANIMOSITY BETWEEN TURKEY AND
ASSAD REGIME GOES BACK DECADES.

1939 TURKEY ANNEXED LAND AT
NORTHWEST AREA WHICH TODAY IS
TURKEY'S SOUTHERNMOST PROVINCE.

SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS HELPED

A RUSSIAN DRONES SEEN OVER A
HOSPITAL WHERE VICTIMS OF
TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK WERE TAKEN AND FIVE HOURS
LATER RUSSIAN AND SYRIAN JETS
BOMBED IT IN AN EFFORT TO KILL
MORE PEOPLE AND DESTROY THE
EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK

RADIOS OFFICIALS SAY RUSSIA HAS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS EXPERTS INSIDE
SYRIA INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINAL
ROLE -- A LITERAL PRE-TWO DAYS
AFTER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA 

"FOX NEWS" HAS LEARNED THE U.S.
MILITARY IS RAMPING UP EFFORTS
TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 1000
AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN
SYRIA OR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE
COALITION IS CUT BACK ON SOME OF
ITS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ISIS
THERE BECAUSE U.S. AIR FORCE
F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER JETS FROM
THE AIRBASE IN TURKEY NOT FAR
FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER 

ARE CONDUCTING IN CREASED AIR
PATROLS A CASE OF SYRIAN OR
RUSSIAN MILITARY TRIES TO ATTACK
AMERICAN FORCES ON THE GROUND.

FOR THIS MOMENT JULIE U.S.
OFFICIALS SAY THE ASSAD REGIME
HAS NOT BEEN MAKING ANY
THREATENING MOVES THE KEEP IN
MIND IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS
OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES ON
THE GROUND YOU HAVE A U.S.
MARINE CORPS ARTILLERY BATTERY
OUTSIDE OF RAQQA SUPPORTING
U.S.-BACKED FORCES AS THEY TRY
TO RECAPTURE.

JULIE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
EXPECT MORE AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES
AGAINST ASSAD REGIME BECAUSE IT
SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS HINTED THAT THERE ARE MORE
TO COME AND OF COURSE THEIR
POLICY AT THIS POINT AT LEAST
WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE
CLEAR IS THAT HE DOESN'T PLAN ON
MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HEAR WHAT THEIR PLAN IS UNTIL IT
HAPPENS.

THAT'S RIGHT IN OFFICIALS
I'VE SPOKEN TODAY SAID NOT TO
EXPECT ANY MORE AIRSTRIKES ON
THE ASSAD REGIME ANYTIME SOON.

AS WAS ALLUDED TO THIS WEEK
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED MORE
PLANTS TO STRIKE THE ASSAD
REGIME.

MADE THE DECISION IN FOUR HOURS
LATER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILES LEFT THE RAIL.

YESTERDAY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR
THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI HALEY
SAID THE UNITED STATES COULD
STRIKE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE BUT
WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE
NECESSARY.

JULIE ONE OF THOSE U.S. WARSHIPS THAT FIRED THE TOMAHAWK
CRUISE MISSILES INTO SERIOUS
HEADING TO AN UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO
REARM.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOVE TO STRIKE
THE SYRIAN AIRBASE WINNING
PRAISE FROM OUR ALLIES AROUND
THE WORLD WHILE RUSSIA AND IRAN
ARE PREVENTING THE ATTACK --
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK.

PROTESTERS LINING THE STREETS OF
DAMASCUS CALLING THE ATTACK AND
AGGRESSION AGAINST THE ENTIRE
NATION BUT RUSSIA REMAINS THE
MOST CRITICAL.

UK, THE STRONGEST OBJECTIONS
ARE COMING FROM RUSSIA.

THEY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.
ACTION IN SYRIA IS THE SAUDIS
CALLING IT A COURAGEOUS DECISION
BUT REFLECTING A REGION OVER
SYRIA IRANIAN PRESIDENT A STRONG
ALLY OF ASSAD HAS BEEN CRITICAL
OF U.S. DECISION.

IT WAS THESE IMAGES OF THE
HORRIFIC CHEMICAL STRIKE IN
NORTHERN SYRIA WHICH SPARKED
GLOBAL OUTRAGE THAT LED TO THE
U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE.

U.S. OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO
WHETHER RUSSIA MAY HAVE
SUPPORTED US.

GOVERNMENT IN CARRYING OUT THE
ATTACK BUT ALL EYES ARE NOW ON
THE RUSSIAN REACTION TO THE KEY
ROLE IN SYRIA WHILE STANDING BY
ASSAD AGGRESSION.

RUSSIA HAS BEEN THE MOST
CRITICAL OF THE U.S. MISSILE
STRIKE SAYING THEY WERE IN
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.

IT ALSO SAYS IT'S A SETBACK FOR
RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. AND MAY
HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR
THE REGION.

RUSSIA KEEPS UP A STRONG
MILITARY PRESENCE ACTIVELY
ASSISTING THE ASSAD REGIME IN
THE COMPANY.

YESTERDAY THIS RUSSIAN WARSHIP
PASSED THROUGH TURKISH WATERS
HEADING TOWARDS THE SYRIAN
COAST.

SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
WILL NO DOUBT BE DISCUSSING
SYRIA WHEN HE DOES -- VISITS
RUSSIA NEXT WEEK.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KEEPS
PRESSURE ON THE SYRIAN REGIME.

JULIE SENATOR RAND PAUL AND A
CRITIC OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
EXPRESSING DOUBT OF U.S. STRIKE
ON SYRIA SAYING THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD OBEY THE CONSTITUTION AND
ASK OR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
BEFORE USING MILITARY ACTION.

WAR HAS CAUSED THESE REFUGEES
TO FLEE SO WILL MORE WAR
ACCELERATE OR ACCENTUATE THE
CURRENT INVOLVEMENT?

WILL THERE BE LESS REFUGEES
UNLESS DEATH?

I WOULD SAY THERE WOULD BE MORE
DEATHS AND MORE REFUGEES.

I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR BOMBING
WILL LEAD TO PEACE.

JULIE BUT SENATOR IF WE DON'T
GET INVOLVED WHAT DID THEY DO
JUST CHEMICALLY GASSED EVERY
BABY IN THE PLACE AND EVERY
WOMAN AND CHILD?

IS DOING IT ON HIS OWN.

THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DEPLORABLE.

ATROCITY IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO
DISOBEY THE CONSTITUTION.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
DECISION TO LAUNCH AIRSTRIKES IN
SYRIA GETTING PRAISE AND
CRITICISM ARE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS SOME THINKING THE
MATTER NEEDS TO BE DEBATED ONCE
THEY RETURN FROM EASTER RECESS
IN TWO WEEKS THROUGH PUBLIC
WEIGHING IN AT A TOWN HALL IN
CALIFORNIA TODAY SAYING WHILE
SUCH AN ATTACK MAY BE NECESSARY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS NEED TO MAKE
THE DECISION, NOT THE PRESIDENT
ALONE.

WHAT A CHAR AL-ASSAD DID IS A
WAR CRIME.

IT IS AN ATROCITY.

IT IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
BUT THE FOUNDERS WERE VERY CLEAR
THAT IF THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO
COMMIT TO WORK NEEDS TO BE UNDER
THE SAY-SO OF THE CONGRESS
REPRESENTING ALL THE PEOPLE AND
NOT THE DECISION OF ONE
INDIVIDUAL.

IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK YOU CAN
SAY THAT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

HIS ADMINISTRATION HOSTING THE
MINISTER OF CHINA A SUCCESSFUL
VOTE ON HIS SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE AND OF COURSE THE
MISSILE STRIKE AGAINST SYRIA
