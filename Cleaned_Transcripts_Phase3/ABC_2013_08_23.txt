THIS IS WORLD NEWS TONIGHT,
AMERICA WARSHIPS AT THE READY.

WILL THERE BE ACTION AT THE NEW
TROUBLING IMAGES FROM SYRIA
TONIGHT.

THE PRESIDENT HUDDLING WITH
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, DOCTORS
ON THE GROUND TREATING THOUSANDS
OF PATIENTS, REVEALING THE
SYMPTOMS  TONIGHT.

WE BEGIN WITH THAT GROWING
URGENCY OVER SYRIA.

AMERICAN WARSHIPS BEING
REPOSITIONED, WHAT IS COMING
NEXT?

PRESIDENT OBAMA IN A RARE WHITE
HOUSE MEETING WITH HIS NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISORS TODAY.

THIS PROMPTED THE MEETING.

GROWING PROOF THAT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED TO
KILL MORE THAN 1,000 IN SYRIA,
AMONG THEM SO MANY CHILDREN.

TONIGHT VOLUNTEERS, DOCTORS
WITHOUT BORDERS, INSIDE SYRIA,
TREATING PATIENTS.

NOW REVEALING THE SYMPTOMS THEY
ARE TREATING.

SAYING MORE THAN 3,000 PATIENTS
WERE RUSHED IN WITH WHAT THEY
CALL NEUROTOXIN SYMPTOMS,
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'D SEE IN A
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE THEY SAY
DIED.

TONIGHT HERE THREE URGENT
QUESTIONS, IS AMERICA ABOUT TO
GET INVOLVED?

WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

AS WE STAND HERE TONIGHT, U.S.

WARSHIPS ARE BEING REPOSITIONED
VERY NEARBY IN CASE OF A
MILITARY AIR STRIKE ON SYRIA.

TONIGHT, EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL
ATTACK IN SYRIA IS MOUNTING.

NEW IMAGES SHOWING THE HORROR.

THE PRESIDENT SPENT THE DAY
HUDDLED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM,
WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE AND HIS
MILITARY OPTIONS.

WE'RE GATHERING INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS EVENT.

BUT IT'S VERY TROUBLESOME.

ON THE TABLE, TARGETING SYRIAN
MILITARY OR GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS
WITH MISSILES, FOUR NAVY
WARSHIPS ARE ALREADY IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN LOADED WITH
TOMAHAWK MISSILES.

U.S. FIGHTER JETS COULD ALSO
ATTACK FIRING FROM OUTSIDE
SYRIAN AIR SPACE, SOAPY LOTS
WOULD BE OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
FORTHCOMING IN SAYING THAT RISK
MUST BE LOW.

WE CANNOT RISK GETTING
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HURT.

AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET PULLED
INTO ANOTHER QUAGMIRE IN THE
UNTIL THE U.S.

CONFIRMS THE
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

TODAY SYRIAN STATE TV CLAIMS THE
REBELS WERE BEHIND THE ATTACK.

ABANDONING THE POSITION THAT NO
CHEMICAL ATTACK OCCURRED.

UN OFFICIALS IN SYRIA ARE
PUSHING FOR ACCESS TO THE SITE
FOR INSPECTION.

THE GROUP DOCTORS WITHOUT
BORDERS SAID TODAY, THAT 3600
PATIENTS WITH NEUROTOXIC
SYMPTOMS WERE TREATED THE DAY OF
THE SUSPECTED ATTACK.

THEY SAY 355 OF THOSE PATIENTS
DIED.

DAVID, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
VERY RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE IN
SYRIA.

BUT WITH THESE URGENT MEETINGS,
AND HIS STRONG LANGUAGE, IT
SUGGESTS HE MAY BE CHANGING HIS
MIND.

ONE MORE NOTE ON THIS TONIGHT.

THE WHITE HOUSE REVEALING THE
PRESIDENT DID SPEAK WITH BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON
TODAY.

THE SUBJECT WAS SYRIA AND
POSSIBLE RESPONSES BY THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
