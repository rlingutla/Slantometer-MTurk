THIS IS A SET-UP.

TONIGHT, HEARING FROM HIS
FAMILY.

PLUS WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT THE
STAND-OFF THAT BROUGHT HIM TO
JUSTICE.

THE LOCKDOWN AND THE CHAOS.

NOW THE RECOVERY.

GET BACK UP AGAIN AND THAT'S IT.

TONIGHT BOSTON BOUNCES BACK.

THAT IS FIRST ON FOX THIS
SATURDAY NIGHT.

WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILES

SURVIVING SUSPECT IN THE BOSTON
MARATHON ATTACK.

WE HAVE AN IMAGE THAT SHOWS THE
SUSPECT AT THE BOAT WHERE POLICE
CAPTURED HIM AFTER YESTERDAY'S
INTENSE GUNFIGHT.

OTHER PHOTOS FROM A
MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE SHOW
THE BOAT DURING THE STAND-OFF.

AND IN THE LOWER LEFT OF YOUR
SCREEN, YOU CAN SEE A POLICE
VEHICLE WITH SOME SORT OF PROBE
EXTENDED.

YESTERDAY WE TOLD YOU HOW POLICE
WERE USING A THERMAL IMAGING
CAMERA TO CHECK OUT WHAT THE
SUSPECT WAS DOING.

AND HERE IS A PHOTO FROM THAT
CAMERA.

YOU CAN SEE IT SHOWS THE SUSPECT
APPARENTLY LYING DOWN AT THE
BOTTOM OF THAT BOAT.

THE SHOOTOUT IN WATERTOWN LEFT A
19-YEAR-OLD IN SERIOUS
CONDITION.

THE SECOND INJURY COULD HAVE
COME FROM THERE AND THEY

THEY HAVE NOT YET FILED
CHARGES.

WE ARE TOLD THEY COULD COME HE

THEY HAVE A TEAM OF
INVESTIGATORS READY TO
QUESTION HIM.

THEY ARE LITERALLY ON STAND

WE SAW INVESTIGATORS COME OUT
AND CAR PARKED HERE LAST
EVENING AFTER THE SUSPECT
BROUGHT HERE.

WE SAW THEM LEAVE, WE KNOW
THERE ARE INVESTIGATORS HERE
AND THEY'RE NOT SAYING MUCH OF
ANYTHING AS THE INVESTIGATION
CONTINUES, SHEPHERD.

IT IS IT A NAIL-BITING
STAND OFF UNFOLDED ON LIVE

BOAT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT
THE BOAT FROM THE DRIVEWAY.

HIS HEAD IS AT THE LEFT.

HOLD.

I AM NOT SURE IF THEY WILL

I DON'T WANT YOU ON TOP OF THE
BOAT WHILE THEY ARE DOING
ANYTHING.

WE'LL MEET YOU.

KEEP AN EYE ON THE GARAGE.

HE'S IN CUSTODY.

HE'S IN CUSTODY.

SUSPECT IS INODY.

SUBJECT IS IN CUSTODY.

GOOD JOB, GENTLEMEN.

AND WITH THAT, THE DAY OF
FEAR ALL OVER THE REGION OVER.

MIKE TO BIN 10 MIMES OUT'VE
BOSTON WHAT IS THE SCENE
TONIGHT?

SHEPHERD, PEOPLE IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD ARE GETTING OUT
AND LOOKING AT THE AFTERMATH
OF THE MANHUNT THAT ENDED IN A
BLAZE OF GUNFIRE RIGHT HERE.

WE GRABBED OUR PHONES AND
CAM RAS AND STARTED RECORDINGS
AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF SECOND
AND THEY OPENED UP FIRE AND
MASSIVE ARTILLERY AND IT SO
LOUD.

WE WERE FOUR HOUSES DOWN AND
WE ARE RIGHT THERE ON TOP OF
IT WE KEPT THE FILM ROLING AND
KIND OF DUCKED DOWN A LITTLE
BIT.

BOB GLATZ SHOT THAT VIDEO.

HE LIKE MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T
FEEL EVER COMFORTABLE AS THE
EMERGENCY LOCK DOWN HAD
LIFTED.

THEY FELT LIKE THERE COULD BE
A THREAT.

THEY ARE GIVING IN TO THEIR
OWN CUROSITY AND RECORDING
THIS BIT OF HISTORY, SHEP.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THE SUSPECT
WORKING OUT IN A GYM, HANGING
OUT AND PARTYING.

THE STUDENT SAID HE SAW HIM IN
A PARTY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND HE
WAS JUST RELAXED.

RELAXED DAYS AFTER HE WAS SAID
TO HAVE ATTACKED THE BOSTON
MARATHON.

THOUSANDS OF INVESTIGATORS
HUNTED FOR HIS BROTHER AND
HIM.

THE SCHOOL EVACUATED THE
CAMPUS AFTER THE SCHOOL
REALIZED THAT THE SUSPECT WAS
A STUDENT.

OFFICERS WERE VERY CAREFUL
WITH APPROACHING THE BOAT.

WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE
DEADLY ARSNIL AS THE TWO
BROTHERS TRIED TO MAKE A
DESPERATE ESCAPE.

WE'LL GET MORE FROM THE HEAD
JOURNALIST OF FOX NEWS .

ITAL YENT GUTS AND GLORY,
THAT'S HOW THE POLICE CEF
DESCRIBED THE OFFICER THAT
CAPTURED THE TERRORIST ATTACK.

IT LASTED MORE THAN AN HOUR.

WITH US NOW IS THE CHIEF
HIMSELF LIVE FROM WATTWATT.

CHIEF, CONGRATULATION AND
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU, SIR.

I LISTENED WH GREAT
INTEREST BEFORE THE TAKE DOWN
WE DOWN.

YOU WERE SAYING WE DIDN'T HAVE
THE MANPOWER TO LOCK THE PLACE
DOWN.

APPARENTLY YOU DID.

YEAH, AS IT TURNS OUT WE
BLOCK PERIMETER, IT DIDN'T
TALK LONG TO GET THE GUY.

IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE WAS
ABLE TO DO MUCH MOVING AT ALL.

DO YOU KNOW IF HE ALL DAY OR
IF THAT BOAT WAS SRCHED IN
ADVANCE.

THAT BOAT WAS OUTSIDE OF
OUR 20 BLOCK PERIMETER.

WHAT WE HAD SET UP AND THOUGHT
WE HAD HIM PINNED DOWN 130
A.M. THAT MORNING, WE JUST
MISSED IT AND DIDN'T GET THE
PERIMETER AS WIDE AS WE NEEDED
TO DO .

SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THAT
SHOT.

AND I WONDER IF GOVERNOR
PATRICK HAPPENED AROUND 7
O'CLOCK LIFTED THAT ORDER TO
STAY IN PLACE IF YOU WOULD
HAVE FOUND HIM ALIVE?

THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

YOU KNOW, WE HAD ASKED OUR
COMMUNITY TO BE DILIGENT AND
RESPECT OUR SHELTER IN PLACE
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT GENTLEMEN
DID.

HE DID NOT EVEN LEAVE HIS
HOUSE AT ALL EVEN TO GO IN HIS
BACK YARD UNTIL WE TOLD HIM IT
WAS OKAY BY SIX CAN BE
O'CLOCK.

WE HAD RESPOND HAD OUR BAD GUY
PINNED DOWN.

WEMENTED TO MAKE SURE WE DID
IT SAFELY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALL OF THE
OFFICERS INVOLVED.

LAST THING YOU NEEDED WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE HURT.

DID HE SAY ANYTHING OR
COMMUNICATE IN ANY WAY?

NO.

WE TRIED TO TALK TO HIM AND WE
WERE IN 15 OR 20 MINUTES OF
HARD NEGOTIATION AND MAKING
DEMANDS OF HIM AND HE DID NOT
RESPOND.

WE HAD PUT SOME FLASH BANGS IN
TO THE BOAT TO GET HIM TO
COOPERATE AND ALL HE ENDED UP
DOING IN THE END MEETING OUR
DEMAND AND PULLING HIS HANDS
FREE AND SHOWING HIMSELF AND
LIFTING HIS SHIRT.

SO HE WAS ABLE TO LIFT HIS
SHURT -- SHIRT.

HE WAS NOT UNCUSHIOUS.

RIGHT.

HUM.

WELL, BECAUSE OF THAT, I
WONDER WHAT KIND OF SHAPE YOU
THOUGHT HE WAS IN?

WE KNEW HE HAD SERIOUS
INJURIES FROM THE GUN FIGHT AT
1230 A.M..

THE CAR HE ABANDONED HAD BLOOD
STAINS AND WE DID A SEARCH
INSIDE OF THE PERIMETER.

WE FOUND APE HOUSE WHERE THERE
A POOL OF BLOOD OR A CIRCLE OF
BLOOD.

WE KNEW HE WAS LOSING BLOOD
BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW EXTENSE
ITCH HIS INJURIES.

CHIEF, YOU ARE NOT A LARGE
DEPARTMENT ANDIM GUESSING
AFTER THE BOMBING.

THE LAST THING YOU WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT WAS THIS.

AND IT IS BOSTON CAMBRIDGE AND
WE HAD OUR SHARE OF INCIDENTS.

I HOPE THE MEN AND WOMEN
AND THE COMMUNITY ARE --
IT IS A GUN FIGHT AT 1225
WITH MY OFFICERS AND THE BAD
GUYS.

AND THEY'RE EXCHANGED.

IT WOULD BE BEYOND HEROIC .

IT IS AMAZING .

WE CAN GIVE THEM TALENT AND
TRAINING.

BUT THE DETERMINATION THEY HAD
TO SURVIVE THAT IS INCREDIBLE
TO ME.

THERE IS A MEMORIAL GOING
ON RIGHT NOW, CHIEF AND WE'LL
PUT IT UP ON THE SCREEN.

IS THIS FOR THE MIT OFFICER?

I AM ASSUMING THAT IS
RIGHT, YES.

IN FACT THE PRODUCERS TOLD
MY IT IS.

IT JUST POPPED UP.

WE'LL LISTEN ALONG WITH OUR
VIEWERS.

â™ª AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE.

[ APPLAUSE ]
 HOLDING A BANNER THAT READS
WATERTOWN RAIDER PRIDE.

A LOT OF PRIDE IN THAT TOWN
TONIGHT.

THAT IS VERY NICE.

WOW, THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE
GOTTEN FROM OUR COMMUNITY HAS
BEEN INCREDIBLE AT THIS TIME.

I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT MY
DEPARTMENT AND COMMUNITY.

A LOT OF LOVE HERE TOO,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

HE DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

HE DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO
AN ATTORNEY.

OFFICERS ARE NOT READING THE
SUSPECTS RIGHTS IN THE CASE.

DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE
EXCEPTION HERE AND THE CRITISM
THAT CAME WITH IT.

WHO WILL REPRESENT THE MAN IN
COURT.

THAT'S ALL AHEAD.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THE
SUSPECT IS IN NO SHAPE TO FACE
QUESTIONING REGARDING THE
BOSTON BOMBING.

BUT WHEN HE RECOVERS,
INTERROGATORS WILL NOT TELL
HIM HE HAS THE RIGHT TO REMAIN
SILENT.

THE WHITE HOUSE DECIDED NOT TO
READ HIM MIRANDA RIGHTS.

HE'S NOT GETTING THAT.

FEDS ARE ENVOKING AN EXCEPTION
TO THE RULE AND ALREADY THE
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES IS
SLAMMING THAT DECISION .

WE MUST NOT WAIVER FROM THE
TRIED AND TRUE JUDICIAL
SYSTEM.

WE'LL BREAK DOWN THE
COMPLICATED LEGAL ISSUINGS.

CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY
HEATHER HANSON IS WHERULSE.

YOU CATCH SOMEBODY WHO
MIGHT HAVE LEFT A BOMB
SOMEWHERE .

YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND
QUESTION THEM RIGHT NOW FOR
THE PUBLIC SAFETY.

THAT TIMES PASSED HASN'T
IT.

THE LAW WAS IN 1984 .

THAT IS WHAT IT AT THAT TIME.

SINCE THEN SPECIFICALLY AFTER
THE TIMES SQUARE BOMBING IN
2010,ATTEMPTED.

THE F.B.I.

PUT OUT A MEMO
THAT ADDRESSES THE TERRORIST
CASES THAT THEY COULD EXPAND
THE TIME IN WHICH THEY CAN
QUESTION A SUSPECT WITHOUT
READING THEM THEIR RIGHTS.

THE QUESTION IS HOW LONG OF A
TIME IS THERE.

WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

WAS IT NOT THE LETTER OF
THE LAW.

BUT WAS IT THE INTENT OF THE
LAW TO STOP AN IMMINENT THREAT
AGAINST THE PEOPLE.

FOR INSTANCE TIMES SQUARE
BOMBER HAD BLOWN SOMETHING OUT
THERE AND HAD BLOWN SOMETHING
THAT THE AUTHORITIES NEEDED TO
KNOW ABOUT IT  IT IS IT JUST
A DIFFERENT THING AND WE DON'T
KNOW IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN
CHICAGO AND PHILADELPHIA AND
CALIFORNIA AND THAT THE NATURE
OF TERRORISM IS DIFFERENT.

WE'LL EXPAND THIS EXCEPTION.

THIS IS NOT THE LAW, SHEP.

IT IS JUST A MEMO .

THERE WAS TALK TOO.

AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD
GO BEFORE CONGRESS.

THEY FEMENT IT APPROPRIATE AT
THE TIME.

THEY COULD DETERMINE IF THERE
INTELLIGENCE OR NOT.

AND SO THEY HAVE A GOOD
CASE AGAINST THIS GUY.

AND SINCE YOU DIDN'T READ THAT
ANYTHING YOU CAN'T USE AGAINST
HIM.

THEY HAVE PLENTY.

YEAH.

MY QUESTION IS A BIGGER
ONE.

IS THE INTENTION TO TRY HIM IN
COURT.

IT SOUNDED LIKE THAT FROM THE
PRESIDENT.

HE SAID COURTS.

THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL IDEA
FELL OUT OF FAVOR.

WE HAVE TRIED 500 CASES IN THE
FEDERAL COURT AND ONLY A
HANDFUL OF MILITARY CASE .

YET LINDSAY GRAHAM AND JOHN
MCCAIN WANT HIM IN MILITARY
COURT.

YOU CALL HIM ENEMY
COMBATANT THAT IS TAKEN AWAY A
LOT OF RIGHTS.

HE SHOULD BE ARRAIGNED IN 24
HOURS AND THEY HAVE MADE
EXCEPTIONS IN THE OF OSAMA BIN
LADEN'S SON IN LAW AND
ATTEMPTED TIMES SQUARE BOMBER
F. YOU ARE AN ENEMY COMBATANT
IT COULD BE MONTHS BEFORE
COMING TO COURT.

WE LEARNED YESTERDAY THALT
F.B.I.

HAD INVESTIGATED THE
OLDER BROTHER'S POSSIBLE TIE
TO TERROR GROUPS AND TURNS OUT
THAT IS NOT ALL OFFICIALS WERE
INVESTIGATING.

THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION
RIGHT NOW AND THE DETAILS ARE
AHEAD.

IT IS THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR
AND TIME FOR THE TOP OF THE
NEWS AND THE UNCLE OF THE
BOSTON TERROR SUSPECT SPEAKING
OUT SAYING HE IS RELEGALED
THAT THE YOUNGER BROTHER IS
STILL ALIVE.

I HOPE HE WILL PULL
THROUGH.

HE WILL BE ABLE FOR HIS OWN
SAKE.

FOR HIS OWN SAKE TO GET
FORGIVENESS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE
BEEN HARMED AND HAVE BEEN
HURT.

FROM THE FAMILIES OF THE
VICTIMS.

FROM MARTIN'S FAMILY AND
KRYSTAL'S FAMILY AND LINDSAY'S
FAM DISPAM THE OFFICER.

FOR ALL 180 WHO SUFFERED.

AS I SAID FOR HIS OWN SAKE.

REMEMBER THE UNCLE CALLED
HIS NEPHEWS LOSERCE AND
ANGRILY DEMANDED THAT THE
YOUNGER SON TURN HIMSELF IN.

HE CLAIM THAT WOULD HIS OLDER
NEPHEW WAS SET AGAINST HIM.

THE YOUNG MAN CALLED HIM IN
2009 TO SAY HE CHOSE GOD'S
BUSINESS OVER SCHOOL OR WORK.

THAT THE LAST TIME THEY EVER
SPOKE TO EACH OTHER.

THE F.B.I.

REPORTS THAT THEY
INVESTIGATED HIS REPORT TO
GROUPS AND EVENTUALLY RELEASED
HIM.

THE F.B.I.

RELEASING A STRONG
STATEMENT.

IN 2011, THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT ASKED THE F.B.I.

TO
INVESTIGATE THE BROTHER
BECAUSE HE WAS A FOLLOWER OF
RADICAL ISLAM AND A STRONG
BELIEVER AND CHANGED TO LEAVE
TO THE UNITED STATES TO JOIN
UNSPECIFIED UNDER GROUND
GROUPS.

THE F.B.I.

FOUND NO EVIDENCE
OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

THAT IS CREATING UNEASE AT THE
BUREAU.

THERE IS A LOT OF PAL
PAITATIONS IN THE F.B.I.

ABOUT
WHAT THEY SAW WHEN THEY LOOKED
AT THIS AND WHAT DID THEY
MISS.

THAT WILL BE SCUTINIZED.

TONIGHT FOX NEWS IS TOLD
THAT THE F.B.I.

IS WORKING
THROUGH A LONG LAUNDRY LIST
AND THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE
FEBRUARY FIB TASK FORCE SAID
THE VOLUME .

EXPLOSIVES REQUIRE A
SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED
TRAINING, SHEPHERD.

YOU HAVE LEARNED OF ANOTHER
INVESTIGATION GOING ON
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

FOX NEW SYSTEM TOLD THAT
INVESTIGATORS ARE EXPLORING
LINKINGS BETWEEN THE OLDER
BROTHER AND THE CACK CAUSUS
EMERATE BASED ON THE TRAVEL TO
RUSSIA IN THE FIRST HALF OF 20
12 AND INCLUDED DAGIS STAN AND
CHECHNYA .

KNOWN FOR THE ATTACKS ON THE
RUSSIAN TRAINS AND MOSCOW
AIRPORT AND CONFLICT WITH THE
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT THEY WERE
DESINATED A TERRORIST
COMMUNITY .

THE GROUP IS SEEN AS A FRINGE
PLAYER, THE STATE DEPARTMENT
SAID THE DESINATION OF
CAUCUSES EMERIT IS IN RESPONSE
TO THE U.S. AND RUSH YAMPT IT
ILLUSTRATES THE GLOBAL NATURE
OF THE TERRORIST PROBABLE WE
EXPERIENCE TODAY.

THAT THE SAME YEAR THE RUSSIA
GOVERNMENT ASKED THE U.S. TO
INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE OLDER
BROTHER HAD TIES TO THE GROUP.

WE'LL LOOK AT SPECIAL
INSIGHT WITH DAVID WILLIAMS
WHO IS LIVE WITH US IN
WASHINGTON.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS
GROUP, AND WHAT IS YOUR SENSE
OF WHAT WENT WRONG TWO YEARS
AGO.

FIRST QUESTION, WHAT DO I
KNOW ABOUT THE GROUP, VERY
LITTLE.

EVERYBODY WHO WORKED COUNTER
TERRORISM IS FULLY AWARE OF
THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON
IN THE CAUCUS OF DAGIS STAN
AND CHECHNYA AND THERE IS A
LOT THERE.

BUT MOST OF THEIR HISTORIC
ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE
RUSSIAN ENTITIES.

THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT
ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES.

THAT IS TO ESTABLISH A LEVEL
OF AUTONNY FOR CHECHNYA AND
THEY ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL
JIHADIST AND SEES UNITED
STATES AS A PRIMARY ENEMY.

I AM NOT SURED THAT THEY WOULD
COME TO TARGET US.

FROM WHAT YOU LEARN BODY
HOW THESE TWO SEPARATED AND
ACCOMPLISH, IS IT SENSE IT WAS
A TRAINING THING OR WOULD THEY
HAVE HAD HELP WITH THIS.

THAT IS DIFFICULT TO
ANSWER.

IT WOULD SEEM THERE A NUMBER
MUCH IED'S BUILT .

IT WOULD SEEM GENERALLY THEY
WORKED AND ACCORDINGLY I THINK
THEY CERTAINLY HAD TRAINING TO
DO THAT .

FURTHER MORE WHEN I WATCHED
THEM MARCH INTO THE SCENE
WHERE THEY LAID DOWN THE
IED'S.

THEY WERE PREPARE ALMOST LIKE
TWO SOLDIERS WALKING DOWN BOL
STON STREET TO DO THAT.

IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THEY HAD
TRAINING ON HOW TO LAY OUT AN
ATTACK PLAN AND FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH IT.

SINCE THE ATTACKS OF 9/11
IN 2001, IT A CONCERN THAT
THIS SORT OF THING WOULD
HAPPEN, AND THAT JUST A COUPLE
OF LONE WOLFLESS MIGHT
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING ON THE
SUBWAY STATION OR SOMEWHERE
ELSE.

IS OUR CONCERN GREATER TODAY
THAN IT A WEEK AGO?

I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE
COUNTER TERRORISM COMMUNITY IS
AWARE .

POTENTIAL OF IT HAPPENING.

WHY IT IS NOT HAPPEN NEGLIGENT
PAST WE DON'T KNOW.

PART OF THAT AND I AM NOT JUST
PATTING THE F.B.I.

ON THE
BACK.

THERE IS SO MANY PLOTS IN THE
LAST 10 OR 11 YEARS.

SOMETHING LIKE THE GOALIE,
BOUND TO GET BY AND IT DID ON
MONDAY.

LAST NIGHT IN WATTWATT,
SCOW MANY PEOPLE HUDDLED IN L
HOUSES.

CONSIDER THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE
WOMAN WHO HID IN HER HOME AND
HER EIGHT YEAR OLD SON
LISTENING TO GUNFIRE.

IT STARPTING TO GET
SURROUNDED AND THEY YELLED AT
US TO GET IN THE HOUSE AND AS
I WALKED THROUGH MY LIVING
ROOM, I HEARD RAPID FIRE.

AND THAT'S WHEN I GRABBED MY
SON'S HAND AND SAID I DON'T
WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS.

WE HAVE TO GO IN THE BATHROOM
.

WE JUST SAT DOWN IN THE FLOOR
AND TOLD HIM WE WOULD BE OKAY.

YOU WILL HEAR MORE GUNSHOTS
AND SMALL BLASTS AND I FLUSHED
THE TOILET SO HE WOULD NOT
HEAR IT.

I HEARD THEM YELL DOWN MY
DRIVE WAY.

I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WOULD
BE GUNFIRE AND I LAIDD OVER MY
SON AND I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO
KNOW HOW SCARED I WAS.

I LAID OVER HIM AND I SOBBED
FOR A MINUTE.

MY PHONE STARTED TO RING AND
MY COUSIN SAID THEY CAUGHT HIM
AND I COULD GO OUT .

I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER AND SO I
CRAWLED OUT OF THE BATHROOM TO
PEEK AT MY TELEVISION AND WHEN
I DID THAT, I SAW HOW MUCH
ENFORCEMENT WAS OUT HERE AND I
CAME OUT OF THE BATHROOM AND
BROUGHT HIM OUT WITH ME.

[ APPLAUSE ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 WHAT GAVE ME CLOSURE, THE
OFFICER WALKED BY AND I SAID
ARE YOU A HAPPY OFFICER AND HE
GAVE ME THUMBS UP A BIG SMILE
AND THEN I KNOW THEY GOT HIM,
IT IS DONE.

ONE WOMAN'S EXPERIENCE WITH
HER EIGHT YEAR OLD FLUSHING
THE TOILET SO THE CHILD WOULD
NOT HEAR.

THEY ARE OKAY .

RECOVERING WITH A NIGHT OF
GUNFIRE AND ENDED WITH WILD
CHEERS.

A PHOTY OF THE BOAT IN THE
CENTER OF THE STAND OFF.

OUR STATION IN BOSTON THAT
UN-- INVAL AUTOMOBILE.

THE BOAT WITH THE BLUE TARP
OVER IT .

THIS IS WHERE THE MARATHONE
YOU CAN SEE BLOOD ON ONE
SPHOT.

FIRST TIME I AM SEEING IT
ALONG WITH YOU.

THERE IS IT BLOOD ON THE
OUTSIDE OF IT .

WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER THAT
GOT THERE AS HE GOT NINETY-TWO
IN I HIDE OR AUTHORITIES
BRINGING HIM OUT.

THAT IS THE SPOT IT ENDED FOR
HIM AND HIS LIFE OF FREEDOM IS
MOST LIKELY OVER .

WHILE POLICE SEARCHED FOR
SUSPECTS.

OLD GLORY ON DISPLAY IN FEN
WAY PARK THIS AFTERNOON.

THE SOX AT HOME FOR THE FIRST
TIME SINCE THE ATTACK AND
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE
VOLUNTEERS AND VICTIMS AND
RESCUER WORKER OF THE BOMBING.

THIS IS OUR CITY.

HE ADD A CITY.

SPORTS HELPING TO HELD A TOWN
AND NATION .

 LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE
BOMBINGS IN BOSTON.

36,000 RUNNERS HIT THE STREETS
OF LONDON FOR THAT CITY'S BIG
MARATHON.

SECURITY POLICE INCREASED 40
PERCENT FOR THE EVENT.

THAT MEANS MORE OFFICERS AND
SNIFFING DOGS ON HAND AND
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
SPECTATORS EXPECTED TO LINE
THE ROUTE.

BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS
NO CHANGE TO WANT THREAT LEVEL
BUT LONDON IS NOER TO TERROR
ATTACKS.

WITH US IS MIKE, THE DAILY
NATIONAL SPHORTS EDITOR.

I WONDER IF THEY WILL PULL
THIS THING OFF?

MARATHONERS ARE A TRIBE AND
SO WHEN SOMETHING AS HORRIBLE
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON,
HAPPENED.

THEY WILL PUT MORE EMPHASIS
AND MORE SECURITY.

BUT PEOPLE WANTING TO RUN AND
SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF
BOSTON AND MARATHONERINGS.

DID THEY HAVE CANCELLATIONS
 I AM SURE PEOPLE GOT COLD
FEET.

BUT IN TERPS OF PEOPLE WANTING
TO SHOW SUPPORT THEY ARE
WANTING TO DO IT.

THEY ARE READY FOR THIS.

THE INCREASED PRESENCE .

POLICE OFFICER AND HEART AND
SOUL OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE
MARATON.

TWO OF THE BOSTON SPORTS
TEAMS .

THEY ARE HONORING THE MARATHON
BOMBING VICTIMS IN THE CITY
TODAY.

AT THE SOX GAME PLAYERS AND
FANS SANG THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

[ APPLAUSE ]
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 I ON THE STREETS LAST NIGHT
AS THE PARTYING BEGAN MIKE,
AND THEIR RESILIENCE IS
IMPRESSIVE.

IT IS IMPRESSIVE AND YOU
SAW THE FIRST NIGHT AND THE
GARDEN GAME WITH THE BRUINS.

BUILDING UP AND SPINGING THE
ANTHEM AND THE RED SOX GAME
AND THE CROWD GETTING INTO IT
SINGING THE ANTHEM AND THEN
NEAL DIAMOND SINGING SWEET
CARROLLINE AND THE SONG AT
YANKEES STADIUM AND A SHOW OF
SUPPORT.

BOSTON REALLY BRINGING ITSAN
THEM.

RED SOX ANTHEM BEING SUN IN
YANKEES STADIUM ON ENEMY
GROUND.

IT A GREAT SHOW OF SUPPORT BY
THE YANKEES FANNINGS.

A SIMILAR THING HAPPENED IN
FEN WAY.

THIS TIME THE POLICE HAD
CORNERED THE SECOND SUSPECT
AND UNFOLDING LIVE DURING THE
FOX REPORT.

AN UPDATE ON THE 24 HOURS
SINCE THEN.

FROM THE SUSPECT'S MEDICAL
CONDITION AND TO WHERE THE
INVESTIGATION GOES FROM HERE.

THAT'S NEXT.

CHARGINGS FOR THE SURVIVING
BOSTON SUSPECT COULD COME
TONIGHT.

THAT IS THE LATEST FROM THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

RIGHT NOW SPECIAL
INTERROGATION TEAMS ARE IN THE
HOSPITAL TO QUESTION THE
SUSPECT.

HE IS STILL UNCONSCIOUS AND IN
SERIOUS CONDITION.

MOMENTS AGO, WE GOT A NEW
PICTURE OF THE BOAT IN WHICH
THE SUSPECT WAS HIDING IT
SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD AND
FILLED WITH BULLET HOLES.

JENNIFER DAVIS IS WRAPPING UP
THE SCENE TONIGHT.

SHEP, CITY STREETS AND
ASKED WALKS AND PARKS
BUSTLING.

THEY ARE SHOWING WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE BOSTON STRONG .

THE LATEST WORD IS THAT THE
SUSPECT REMAIN HOSPITAL IN
SERIOUS AND STABLE CONDITION
STILL UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE
BEFORE THE MANHUNT ENDED WHEN
HE WAS DISCOVERED BLOOD
YEHIDING OUT IN WATERTOWN.

HE HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED AND WE
ARE WAITING FOR MORE ON THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON HOW THEY
PLAN TO PROCEED AMID
CONTROVERSY AND HOW THEY THINK
IT SHOULD PROCEED AND STILL NO
WORD.

AT THE SAME TIME CRIME SCENE
IN THE MARATHON FINISH LINE
AND IN WATTWATTCONTINUE TO BE
PROCESSED FOR EVIDENCE AND
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING FOR
A MOTIVE AND BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE BROTHERS
WORKING ALONE OR NOT AND WHEN
THEY BECAME RADICALIZED.
