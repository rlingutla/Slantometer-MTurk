REPORT, I'M SHEPARD SMITH
ABOVE MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

ABOVE THE SCHOOL ON WHICH
WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING FOR
THE PAST 48 HOURS.

COMING UP, WE'LL SHOW YOU
THE ENTIRE PATH OF THE
TORNADO THAT RAKED ACROSS
THIS OKLAHOMA CITY SUBURB.

WE WILL SHOW YOU THE
DAMAGE, THE DESTRUCTION,
THE RECOVERY EFFORTS AND
YOU WILL MEET THE PEOPLE IN
THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL.

GROUND NOW, MOORE
OKLAHOMA, WHERE TODAY THE
MEDICAL EXAMINER ANNOUNCED
HIS OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED
ALMOST ALL OF THE 24 PEOPLE
WHO DIED IN THE TORNADO
MONDAY.

10 OF THOSE VICTIMS,
CHILDREN.

TWO OF THOSE INFANTS, LESS
THAN A YEAR OLD.

ONE MAN WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS
AMONG THOSE KILLED AT PLAZA
HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
SAYS HE ARRIVED THERE 10
MINUTES AFTER THE TWISTER
HIT AND HE SAYS WHEN HE
FINALLY RETURNED TO HIS
HOUSE, WITHOUT HIS CHILD
HIS HOME WAS GONE.

THE LATEST OFFICIAL
ESTIMATES INDICATE THIS
TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR
DESTROYED UP TO 13,000
HOMES.

I MENTIONED EARLIER WE GOT
A LOOK FROM THE SKY AND A
LENGTHY ONE.

WE WERE UP FOR HOURS
LOOKING AT THE DESTRUCTION
THE TORNADO INFLICTED.

IT IS A BROKEN LINE OF
OBLITERATION.

A SCAR ACROSS AMERICA'S
HEART LAND.

ONE THAT STRETCHES FOR MANY
MILES.

WE'RE STARTING IN PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE THE
SEVEN CHILDREN DIED.

AND THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE
WE WATCHED FROM THE
HELICOPTER TWO DAYS AGO AS
RESCUE WORKERS AND
NEIGHBORS WERE PULLING AWAY
ALL OF THE -- WHAT WAS LEFT
OF THE SCHOOL TO TRY TO GET
TO THE CHILDREN.

IN HOPES, IN HOPES THAT
THEY COULD GET SOME OUT
ALIVE.

AS IT TURNED OUT, IT WAS AN
AWFUL SCENE THERE.

BUT THEY ARE HARD AT WORK
TODAY, TRYING TO REMOVE
WHAT'S THERE.

BECAUSE THE GOAL NOW IS TO
GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES.

OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU
ALONG THE PATH OF THE
STORM.

I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM
THE SCHOOL ACROSS ABOUT A
FOUR TO FIVE MILE AREA OF
THE WORST OF DESTRUCTION.

YOU WILL SEE HOW THE WIDTH
OF THE STORM THE WIDTH OF
THIS TORNADO CHANGES AS WE
MOVE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE.

SCOTT, TAKE US OUT THERE IF
YOU COULD.

AND THIS -- WE'RE IN THE
SCHOOL AREA NOW AND AS HE
ZOOMS, IN YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR
AREA HOMES WERE REDUCED TO
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS
WHERE THE STORM WAS AT ITS
WIDEST.

THINK OF THIS AS A FUNNEL
LIKE YOU WOULD USE IN YOUR
KITCHEN.

THE TIP OF THE FUNNEL IS
VERY THIN.

THE TOP IS VERY WIDE.

BUT IF YOU COULD PUSH THAT
FUNNEL DOWN INTO THE
GROUND, THE AREA WHICH IS
CONCENTRATED ON THE GROUND,
IT'S WIDER.

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

THAT'S WHY IN THIS AREA
THE WIDTH OF THE STORM THE
WIDTH OF THE TORNADO WAS
ABOUT TWO MILES.

SO THE AREA OF DESTRUCTION
IS MASSIVE AND THE DENSITY
OF IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.

YOU DON'T SEE A BUNCH OF
HOUSES STILL THAT MIGHT BE
ABLE TO BUILD AROUND.

YOU SEE NOTHING BUT DEBRIS.

IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY -- AS
IF A GIANT CAME IN AND
SQUISHED IT IN HIS HAND AND
DROPPED IT IT ON THE
GROUND.

THROUGHOUT THIS AREA, NOW
THE PATH OF THE DESTRUCTION
IS THINNER.

THE CLOUDS LIFTED UP SOME.

AND THE AREA OF THE FUNNEL
CLOUD THAT WAS TOUCHING THE
GROUND IS SMALLER.

YOU WILL SEE SOME THE
DESTRUCTION ISN'T QUITE AS
SEVERE.

IN SOME OF THESE AREAS YOU
WILL SEE BLUE TARPS ON TOP
OF HOUSE AFTER HOUSE.

THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE THEY
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
SALVAGE THE HOME.

BUT, BEHIND US, IT WASN'T
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

SCOTT, PULL OUT AND SHOW
FORWARD IF YOU WOULD, AND
YOU WILL SEE AHEAD OF US
THE PATH OF THE STORM WAS
MUCH THINNER, MEANING THE
CLOUDS HAD LIFTED HIGHER
AND THE PART OF THE CONE
THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE
GROUND IS MUCH SMALLER.

THE WINDS GET STRONGER AND
WEAKER AS THE STORM MOVES
ALONG LIKE ANYTHING ELSE
IT PICKS UP ENERGY AND IN
SPURTS IT WILL BE STRONGER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

WE ARE A LITTLE MORE THAN
HALFWAY THROUGH THE
DESTRUCTION OF THIS NOW.

AND YOU CAN SEE AGAIN I'M
TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS.

WE ARE FLYING ALONG A
STRAIGHT LINE.

AND AS YOU LOOK ALONG THAT
STRAIGHT LINE.

NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER
NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE AFTER
HOUSE, JUST COMPLETELY
OBLITERATED.

IF HE PULLS OUT JUST A
LITTLE BIT, YOU WILL SEE
THAT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT
OF THE SHOT, THERE ARE
HOUSES THAT ARE JUST FINE.

THIS ISN'T A TWO MILE WIDE
PATH IN THIS AREA.

IT'S MUCH THINNER THAN THAT
IN SOME AREAS IT'S JUST A
FEW HUNDRED YARDS WIDE.

BUT IF YOUR HOME WAS IN
THAT AREA, YOUR HOME IS
DESTROYED.

IF YOU WERE JUST TO THE
LEFT OR RIGHT OF IT YOU
MIGHT HAVE SOME ROOF DAMAGE
AND THEN THE NEXT SERIES OF
HOUSES OVER, THERE MIGHT BE
DEBRIS FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
HOME, WHAT USED TO BE YOUR
NEIGHBOR'S HOME ON TOP OF
YOUR HOUSE OR IN YOUR YARD.

BUT YOUR HOUSE ITSELF IS
FINE.

THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS
STORM.

NOW, BACK TO THE PATH OF IT
ITSELF.

AND WE ARE COMING INTO AN
AREA THAT'S MORE -- THAT'S
LESS POPULATED.

YOU WILL SEE AN AREA WHERE
IT JUST SORT OF DUG UP THE
DIRT AND REPLACED THE GRASS
WITH DIRT.

AND THEN THERE WILL BE A
HOME HERE AND A HOME THERE.

AND JUST AHEAD OF US IS THE
SPOT WHERE THE TORNADO
ACTUALLY LIFTED BACK INTO
THE SKY.

LIFTED BACK NOT TO BE SEEN
AGAIN AND THEN THE
RESIDENTS CAME BACK TO TRY
TO ASSESS WHAT HAD
HAPPENED.

THE DAMAGE WAS EXTENSIVE.

THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE
AHEAD IS WEEKS AND MONTHS.

BUT THEY HAVE VOWED THEY
WILL REBUILD AND WHEN YOU
LOOK DOWN BELOW, YOU WONDER
CAN THOSE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE
IN THE YEARS TO COME?

OKLAHOMANS TELL US THEY
CAN.

JIM JOHNSON WHO GAVE US
THAT TWO AND A HALF HOUR
TOUR TODAY.

WE FLEW BACK AND FORTH AND
BACK AND FORTH.

JIM WAS IN THAT SAME
CHOPPER 14 YEARS AGO AND
FLYING THAT SAME PATH WHEN
THE LAST HUGE STORM HIT
HERE.

HE SAYS IN AREAS THE
DESTRUCTION IS WORSE, BUT
THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF THE
DESTRUCTION IN 1999 WAS
LONGER.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL HEAD
HERE ON SUNDAY TO SEAT
DAMAGE FOR HIMSELF.

HE IS SET TO MEET WITH
SURVIVORS AND THANK THE
RESPONDERS.

WE HAVE A LOT MORE FROM THE
HEARTLAND NEWSCAST.

YOU WILL MEET A TEACHER
FROM BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY.

NOW JUST A PILE OF BROKEN
CHALK BOARDS AND SCATTERED
ARTWORK AND PILES WHERE
DESKS USED TO BE.

HOW SCIEWNTS GOT OUT ALIVE.

HOW THE BRAVE KIDS GOT INTO
ACTION LIFT THE CONCRETE TO
SAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE KIDS.

WE HAVE SEEN THE HARD HIT
NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THIS BUT
ONLY FROM ABOVE.

NOW WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THEM
FROM THE GROUND, GIVING
THIS A WHOLE NEW
PERSPECTIVE.

HE WILL TAKE US ON A LIVE
DRIVING TOUR WITH MAWLT
PELL CAMERAS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS IN
ALL OF COUNTRY MUSIC COMES
HOME.

TOBY KEITH GREW UP RIGHT
HERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

HIS NAME IS ON THE WATER
TOWER.

HE WAS IN TOWN BEFORE THE
STORM HIT.

HE TELLS ME HOW HE HOPES TO
USE HIS STAR POWER TO HELP
HIS HOMETOWN.

AS OUT MIGHT IMAGINE.

HE WAS HERE ONMOND AND FLEW
FROM NASHVILE HOURS BEFORE
THE DISASTER.

I KNEW YOU WERE HERE
BECAUSE I SAW YOUR NAME ON
THE WATER TOWER.

HOW ABOUT THAT.

I'M PROUD OF THAT.

GREW UP FOUR BLOCKS FROM
WHERE WE ARE AT.

MOVED HERE.

MOVED OUT HERE THREE
MILES.

GOT A BIG SPREAD OUT THERE.

EAST OF TOWN.

LIVES RIGHT HERE.

SHE LIVES A COUPLE MILES
DOWN FOURTH STREET HERE IN
THIS PATH WE ARE STANDING
IN GOT HER HOUSE RIGHT
MORNING BOARDING UP.

WE SPENT THE LAST TWO
DAYS MAKING SURE SHE GOT
HER STUFF, SAVED THE SHELL,
ALL THE GARAGE DOORS AND
WINDOWS OF THE GARAGE IS
GONE.

THANK GOD SHE GOT TO KEEP
HER STUFF.

HAS STRUCK OUR TEAM IS THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
COME HERE TO HELP.

EVERYTHING FROM PASSING OUT
WATER BOTTLES, OFFERING
FOOD TO RESCUE WORKERS AND
THE MEDIA FOR THAT MATTER.

AND THE FAMILIES WHO ARE
LEFT WITH NOTHING.

TOBY KEITH TOLD ME THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT COMES
NATURAL TO SOONERS.

LAST TORNADO MAYBE THE
PEOPLE THAT GOT HIT THIS
TIME WERE HELPING THOSE
PEOPLE WHEN THEY GOT HIT.

EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU
COME TOGETHER AS ONE AND
PUT EVERYTHING ASIDE AND
YOU GET IT BACK UP AND
RUNNING.

IT'S OUR HOME, YOU KNOW.

AND WHEN YOU CALL SOME
PLACE HOME, YOU CAN TELL
THAT PEOPLE ALREADY
STARTING TO PICK THEMSELVES
UP.

THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMING
AROUND PASSING FOOD OUT
BRINGING BLANKETS AND
WATER.

THEY ARE RESOURCEFUL AND
GOT THAT SPIRIT.

OKLAHOMA MADE IT THROUGH
THE DUST BOWL.

TORNADO IS JUST ANOTHER BAD
DAY BLOOD ROCK WE ARE RIGHT
BACK IN THE MIDDLE.

TOBY KEITH SAID HE WOULD
ALSO LIKE TO HELP BY
DONATING WHAT HE DOES BEST.

HE SAYS HE IS PLANNING A
BENEFIT CONCERT.

HE SAYS FIRST THE COMMUNITY
NEEDS SOME TIME TO HEAL.

RIGHT NOW WE ARE TRYING
TO GET EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW
GET WOOD ON PEOPLE'S HOUSES
GET THEM SCREWED IN AND
GETS THE TARPS ON.

GET EVERYTHING UP AND
RUNNING AND THEN GET PAST
THE FUNERALS AND THE SHOCK
OF THING THIS AND ONCE WE
TURN THE CORNER THEN WE
WILL ALL DIVE IN AND TRY TO
RAISE A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR
THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE IN THE MUSIC LOVE TO
DO.

BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE JUST
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO
FOCUS ON GETTING THE
INFRASTRUCTURE PUT BACK IN
PLACE.

GETTING CELL TOWERS UP.

GETTING THE PEOPLE BACK IN
THEIR HOUSES.

GETTING THEIR POSSESSIONS
SAVED.

AS SOON AS WE FIND OUT MORE
DETAILS ABOUT THE BENEFIT
CONCERT IS HE WORKING ON WE
WILL GET BACK TO YOU.

BACK HERE IN OKLAHOMA WE
ARE GETTING NEW ACCESS TO
ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING
NEIGHBORHOODS.

CASEY STEGALL IS DRIVING
LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE NOW
HARDLY RECOGNIZABLE STREETS
AS POLICE LET JOURNALISTS
IN FOR THE FIRST TIME.

GROUND LOOK NOW OWE
INCREDIBLE CEFINGS OF
MONDAY'S TORNADO HERE IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

POLICE HAVE REJOINT
EXHIBITED MEDIA ACCESS TO
SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT
NEIGHBORHOODS SO GET IN
THERE TO CLEAN UP AND
RESTORING THE POWER.

THEY DID ALLOW OUR OWN
CASEY STEGALL INTO THE
DAMAGE ZONE.

HE HAS BEEN DRIVING AROUND
IN OUR QUICK RESPONSE
VEHICLE.

NOT FAR FROM YOUR LOCATION
IN OUR QUICK RESPONSE
VEHICLE, A QRV.

WE ARE GOING TO NOW CUT TO
LIVE CAMERAS ON THE VERY
TRUCK THAT I'M RIDING IN.

THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT AND
LEFT.

FRANKLY, YOU CAN SET UP A
TRIPOD AND CAMERA AND YOU
CAN DO LIVE SHOTS BUT TO
REALLY CONVEY TO PEOPLE HOW
WIDESPREAD THE DAMAGE IS,
THIS TELLS THE STORY.

TO THE RIGHT, YOU CAN SEE
THERE ARE BASICALLY TARS ON
TOP OF CARS.

AND YOU SEE THE SPRAY
PAINTED X'S.

THOSE ORANGE X'S.

THOSE WERE THE VERY FIRST
MARKS THAT FAWNDERS MADE
MADE WHEN THEY GOT IN HERE.

THEY LOOKED INSIDE AND
MOVED ON.

M'S STOOD FOR MISSING.

THEY LATER COME BACK AND
UPDATED THAT WE WILL SWITCH
TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
VEHICLE.

AND YOU CAN SEE MATTRESSES,
BOARDS, ON TOP OF EACH
OTHER COMING UP ON THE
LEFT-HAND SIDE IS GOING TO
BE AN UPROOTED TREE.

THIS TREE THAT YOU SEE HAS
ALL OF ITS NEEDLES AND
LEAVES STILL ON IT AND AS
YOU HAVE SEEN, SHEPARD THE
WINDS SO POWERFUL IT CAN
STRIP THE BARK RIGHT OFF OF
TREES.

LET'S GO AHEAD NOW AND
SWITCH BACK TO THE RIGHT

JEREMY IF WE CAN AND CAN
YOU SEE THAT THE DAMAGE IS
EXTREMELY RANDOM.

YOU HAVE SOME HOMES THAT
JUST MAY HAVE SOME SHINGLES
MISSING FROM THEM AND RIGHT
NEXT DOOR YOU HAVE TOTAL
DESTRUCTION.

THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING
COMING UP ON THE RIGHTS
HERE.

THIS GARAGE COMPLETELY
STANDING BUT YOU CAN SEE
THAT THE HOME AND ALL OF
THE DEBRIS IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE HOME IS JUST ALL STREWN
ABOUT.

LET'S GO AGAIN TO THE LEFT
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THESE
PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE AREAS
ARE RESTRICTED FOR OBVIOUS
REASONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
TO LET THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
HERE COME AND GET TO THEIR
HOMES, GET TO THEIR
BELONGINGS AND TRY TO
SALVAGE WHAT THEY CAN.

THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
TODAY.

PEOPLE STANDING ON PILES OF
RUBBLE.

SAT WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND
NOW THEY FIND THEMSELVES
STANDING ON MERE SPLINTERED
BOARDS AND MATTRESSES AND
ELECTRICAL WIRES AND JUST
HEART BREAK IS WHAT IT IS.

AND SHEPARD BACK OUT HERE
LIFE TO US IN THE CAR, YOU
KNOW, THIS IS ONE THING
THAT WE ARE SEEING.

THE RESOLVE OF THESE
PEOPLE.

THEY SAY THAT THEY REBUILT
IN 1999.

YOU CAN TALK TO ME PEOPLE
WHEN THEY ARE ON TOP OF
THEIR-WHAT WAS THEIR HOME
AND THEY ARE IN GOOD
SPIRITS FOR THE MOST PART.

DESPITE EVERYTHING.

IT'S ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING
THE RESOLVE.

AND THEY SAY WE HAVE
REBUILT BEFORE AND WE'RE
GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

ON THE ROAD NEARBY.

MUCH MORE TO COME FROM
OKLAHOMA.

JONATHAN HUNT OUR CHIEF
FOX REPORT CORRESPONDENT
WILL TALK TO A TEACHER WHO
RODE OUT THE STORM WITH HER
STUDENTS IN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.

THEIR STORY IS QUITE
SOMETHING.

ALSO DRONING AMERICANS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT NOW AND
FOR THE FIRST TIME ADMITS
MULTIPLE U.S. CITIZENS HAVE
DIED IN COUNTER TERRORISM
OPERATIONS OVERSEAS.

THEY HAVE BEEN DRONED TO
DEATH.

ONLY ONE OF THOSE AMERICANS
WAS EVEN THE TARGET OF THAT
STRIKE.

OFFICIALS HAVE JUST
ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE NOW
FOUND SIX PEOPLE WHO WERE
STILL MISSING AFTER
MONDAY'S KILLER TORNADO.

THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE THEY
HAVE NOW FOUND ALL OF THE
SURVIVORS.

THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE
THE SEARCH JUST IN CASE
THERE IS SOMEONE NOT ON
THEIR LIST.

AS IT STANDS NOW 24 PEOPLE
HAVE DIED IN THIS DISASTER.

10 OF THEM CHILDREN.

MANY KILLED IN THE
DESTRUCTION OF PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY.

THE SCENE THERE VERY
SIMILAR TO THAT OF ANOTHER
SCHOOL IN TOWN.

BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY WHERE
THE TORNADO HIT LIKE A
BOMB.

THE CHILDREN INSIDE HUDDLED
WITH THEIR TEACHES A THE
STORY GOES AND THE SCHOOL
CRASHED TO THE GROUND
AROUND THEM.

CARS FLEW INTO THE
CLASSROOMS.

YET, EVERY SINGLE TEACHER
AND STUDENT AND
ADMINISTRATOR MANAGED TO
GET OUT OF THEIR ALIVE.

TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING THE
INCREDIBLE STORIES OF
SURVIVE.

CHIEF FOX REPORT
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT
IS LIVE WITH US ON THAT.

WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE BUNCH.

EXTRAORDINARY.

WE HEARD SO MANY
INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OVER
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT
FEW TO ME HAVE BEEN AS
INSPIRING AS THAT OF
THERESA MOSIER.

SHE IS A FOURTH GRADE
TEACHER AT BRIAR WOOD
ELEMENTARY.

WHEN THE TORNADO WARNINGS
CAME, IN SEVERAL OF THE
PARENTS OF HER CHILDREN
RUSHED TO THAT SCHOOL, GOT
THEIR KIDS, TOOK THEM AWAY.

BUT WHEN THE TORNADO HIT
SHE STILL HAD 10 CHILDREN
THERE.

THEIR LIVES IN HER HANDS.

YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN UP
AGAINST THE INSIDE WALL.

YOU HAVE THEM GET DOWN ON
THEIR KNEES.

PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR
HEAD AND PUT THEIR HEADS
YOU KNOW, DOWN.

AND THEN AS WE HEARD IT
APPROACHING, BECAUSE YOU
COULD HEAR IT IT WAS LIKE
10 FREIGHT TRAINS.

AND AS IT APPROACHED, YOU
KNOW, I JUST PUT MY ARMS
OVER THE CHILDREN.

I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE OKAY.

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, YOU
KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR
SAFETY.

THERE IS NOT A ONE OF US IN
THAT BUILDING THAT WOULD
NOT HAVE LAID DOWN OUR
LIVES FOR THOSE KIDS.

AND THEY WERE SCARED.

THEY ARE CRYING THEY ARE
UPSET.

BUT THOSE ARE THE BRAVEST
LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE
WORLD.

I THINK THEY WOULD SAY
YOU ARE THE BRAVEST TEACHER
IN THE WORLD.

WELL, WHEN IT HAD HAD
PASSED OVER THROUGH THEIR
TEARS, THROUGH EVERYTHING,
THEY GOT UP THEY HELPED
TAKE CINDER BLOCKS OFF
THEIR CLASSMATES' LEGS.

THEY HELPED TO UNWIND WIRES
AND METAL THAT HAD WRAPPED
AROUND ANOTHER STUDENT'S
LEGS.

EVEN IN THAT THEY STILL
KNEW TO HELP THEIR
CO-WORKERS AND SO I'M SO
PROUD OF THEM.

I'M SO PROUD TO BE THEIR
TEACHER BECAUSE THEY ARE
REMARKABLE AND RESILIENT
CHILDREN.

THERE IS A LOT OF
FAMILIES THANKING YOU FOR
KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN
ALIVE TODAY.

WELL, THERE WASN'T AN
OPTION.

THAT'S NOT AN OPTION NOT TO
KEEP THEM ALIVE.

I HAVE CHILDREN OF MY OWN.

AND I KNOW THAT ANY TEACHER
IN THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME EXACT THING.

AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THOSE CHILDREN SAW
THEIR PARENTS AGAIN.

AND THEIR PARENTS SAW THEM.

SHE CALLED THOSE FOURTH
GRADERS BRAVE AND
REMARKABLE.


I'M NOT SURE I HAVE MET
ANYBODY AS BRAVE OR AS
REMARKABLE AS THERESA
MOSIER HERSELF.

EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.

IMPRESSIVE.

MORE DEVASTATION MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

ONE WOMAN INSIDE A MEDICAL
FACILITY WITH NEARLY A
DOZEN PATIENTS WHEN THE
WALLS CAME CRASHING DOWN
AROUND THEM.

HOW THEY ESCAPED NEXT.

BACK LIFE IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA TONIGHT LEARNING
MORE ABOUT THE 24 PEOPLE
THE MASSIVE TORNADO KILLED
MONDAY IN THIS COMMUNITY
AND NEXT DOOR IN THE TOWN
OF NEW CASTLE.

THE OKLAHOMA STATE MEDICAL
EXAMINER SAYS 10 OF THE
VICTIMS WERE CHILDREN.

TWO OF THEM INFANTS.

MANY MORE PEOPLE SURVIVED A
TWISTER BUT SUFFERED MANY
INJURIES.

NO PRECISE COUNTY DATE.

HOSPITALS REPORT THEY ARE
200 PEOPLE.

DOZEN BEES OF THEM
CHILDREN.

MANY PATIENTS ARE STILL IN
SEVERAL AREA HOSPITALS.

PEOPLE SURVIVED THE
TORNADO, TURNS OUT A
MEDICAL FACILITY TURNING A
MEDICAL FACILITY INTO
ABSOLUTE RUBBLE TRAPPING 14
PEOPLE INSIDE.

JOHN ROBERTS WITH THIS HERE
LIVE TONIGHT IN MOORE,
JOHN?

YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HEARD
MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS SHEP, POWER
OF MANY ATOMIC BOMBS AND
BEHIND ME IS A CLEAR
EXAMPLE OF THIS.

THIS WAS THE OKLAHOMA HEART
INSTITUTE.

YOU CAN SEE CONCRETE
GERDERS ON TOP OF THIS
BUILDING.

THEY WEREN'T PART OF THAT
STRUCTURE.

THOSE WERE BLOWN FROM THE
TORNADO 300 YARDS FROM THE
TOP OF THAT HOSPITAL.

TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
PICTURES OF THE RUBBLE.

THERE ARE ABOUT 10 ELDERLY
PATIENTS INSIDE AT THE
TIME.

WHEN THEY HEARD THE
WARNINGS THAT THE TORNADO
WAS COMING AND THEY STARTED
TO FEEL THE VIBRATION.

THEY DUCKED DOWN UNDER
DESKS.

WHEN THE WINDS BLEW OUT THE
WALLS AND THOSE GERDERS
CAME DOWN AND COLLAPSED THE
ROOF.

THE WHOLE HEART INSTITUTE
COLLAPSED LIKE IT WAS A PAN
PANCAKE.

ALMOST LIKE HIT BY
EARTHQUAKE.

SANDY JONES IS THE CLINIC
DIRECTOR THERE.

I HAD THIS MUCH ROOM.

THEY CRAWLED OUT.

THEY WERE FURTHER DOWN THAN
I WAS.

PINNED UP AGAINST THE WALL
WITH ONE OF THOSE BRING
PILLARS.

THEY CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER
THE TABLE I COUNTED THEM AS
THEY CAME OUT.

EVERYBODY HAD TO GET OUT.

SANDY TOLD US SHE
ACTUALLY HAD TO BE DRAGGED
OUT BY HER FEET BY
PARAMEDICS.

REMARKABLY, SHEP, ALL OF
THE INJURIES FROM THIS WERE
MINOR.

IT'S ALMOST DIFFICULT TO
BELIEVE.

SANDY HERSELF, THE ONLY
INJURY SHE HAD WAS A BRUISE
TO THE INSIDE OF HER ARM.

IT'S AMAZING, SHEM, THAT
ANYBODY COULD HAVE SURVIVED
THAT LET ALONE COME OUT
LITERALLY WITHOUT A
SCRATCH.

MONDAY'S TWIST ERR NOT ONLY
WIPED AWAY HOMES AND
SCHOOLS BUT MANY
BUSINESSES.

TWO DAYS LATER ONE OWNER OF
ONE OF THOSE BUSINESSES
SAYS IS HE ALREADY GETTING
READY TO REOPEN.

HIS STORY AHEAD AS FOX
REPORTS LIVE IN THE
HEARTLAND.

MOORE, OKLAHOMA O, WHERE
ONE LOCAL BUSINESS THAT
COULD HELP PEOPLE GET AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS
DEVASTATION WILL REOPEN
THIS WEEK.

THAT'S THE WORD TONIGHT
FROM THE OWNER OF THE LOCAL
WARREN MULTI-PLEX MOVIE
THEATER.

A LIVE LOOK AT THAT THEATER
WITH THE BILLBOARD UP "GOD
BLESS MOORE."

YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN THERE.

WE WATCHED YESTERDAY AS
THEY PUT IT UP.

AS CREWS WORKED ON THAT
THEATER EARLIER THIS WEEK
THERE WAS A MESSAGE ON THE
MARQUEE THAT READ PLEASE
PRAY.

THE BUILDING SUSTAINED UP
TO $1 MILLION IN DAMAGE BUT
THAT AS MANY AS 200 PEOPLE
WERE INSIDE DURING THAT
TORNADO AND NOT ONE SINGLE
ONE OF THEM GOT HURT.

FOR A WHILE, THE THEATER
REPORTEDLY SERVED AS A HUB
FOR VOLUNTEERS.

THE MOORE THEATER RIGHT
HERE IN THE HEART OF ALL OF
THE DESTRUCTION A PLACE
MAYBE WHERE FOLKS COULD GET
AWAY AND TAKE THEIR MINDS
OFF ALL OF THIS MESS EVEN
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES.

SET TO REOPEN THIS WEEK.

UPDATING SOME OF FOX TOP
STORIES TONIGHT.

THE AFTERMATH OF THE
APPARENT TERROR ATTACK IN
LONDON.

WITNESSES SAY TWO MEN WITH
A BUTCHER KNIFE OR MULTIPLE
KNIVES KILLED A MAN, HACKED
HIM TO DEATH.

VIDEO CAPTURED ONE EVER THE
TERRORISTS RANTING HOLDING
ONE OF THE BLOODY KNIVES
BEFORE HE POLICE SHOT HIM.

THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC
THREATS THERE.

HERE IN MOORE OKLAHOMA,
OFFICIALS NOW SAY MONDAY'S
TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR
DESTROYED AS MANY AS 13,000
HOMES.

24 PEOPLE NOW CONFIRMED
DEAD.

HUNDREDS MORE ARE HURT.

CREWS SAY THEY BELIEVE THEY
HAVE NOW ACCOUNTED FOR
EVERYBODY WHO IS MISSING
AFTER THAT TWISTER HIT.

AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SET TO
VISIT HERE THIS SUNDAY TO
MEET WITH SURVIVORS AND
FIRST RESPONDERS OR THAT'S
THE PLAN AS THE PRESIDENT
COMES TO THE HEARTLAND THIS
SUNDAY.

ON THIS DAY IN 1999, THE
PEOPLE OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA
HAD BEEN CLEANING UP FOR 19
DAYS.

FROM THE WORST TORNADO THAT
HAD EVER STRUCK THIS AREA.

19 DAYS LATER IT WAS AS IF
IT MIGHT NEVER END.

THERE WAS SO MUCH DEBRIS ON
THAT DAY THERE WAS SO MUCH
WORK TO BE DONE.

THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THEY
MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO
GET IT ACCOMPLISHED.

THEY HAD BEEN LOADING TRUCK
LOAD AFTER TRUCK LOAD BY
THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY.

AND THE PILES WERE STILL
OVERWHELMING.

IT WAS LIKE YOU GO TO THAT
RESTAURANT WHERE THE
PORTIONS ARE SO LARGE THAT
YOU EAT FOR 30 MINUTES AND
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING.

IT'S MUCH THE SAME WAY
HERE.

1 DAYS INTO THIS.

THE CAMERAS WON'T BE AS
PREVALENT.

THE NOTICE WON'T BE AS
GREAT AND FRANKLY THEY WILL
JUST BE LEFT WITH A
HERCULEAN TASK OF FIGURING
OUT HOW TO GET THEIR LIVES
BACK TOGETHER.

THAT'S WHEN THEY WILL NEED
ALL OF US THE MOST IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

WHEN THEY WILL NEED OUR
MONEY AND OUR SUPPORT, OUR
PRAYERS AND OUR HELPING
HAND.

JUST AS JOPLIN, MISSOURI
DID, AS SOUTH MISSISSIPPI
DID, AND AS THE NORTHEAST
DID AFTER SUPER STORM
SANDY, THEY WILL NEED US
AND AS AMERICANS, WE WILL
BE THERE FOR THEM BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.
