ALSO BREAKING, FROM PUERTO
RICO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ROB
MARCIANO TAKES US TO THE PART OF
THE ISLAND WHERE THE HURRICANE
MADE LANDFALL.

THE URGENT PLEA TONIGHT.

THE WOMAN WAVING OUR TEAM INSIDE
AND WHAT ROB FOUND.

WE TURN NEXT HERE TO THE
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE IN PUERTO
RICO.

HOME TO 3.5 MILLION AMERICAN
CITIZENS.

HURRICANE MARIA, THE WORST STORM
TO BATTER THAT ISLAND IN NEARLY
A CENTURY.

AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, RIGHT
HERE TONIGHT, OUR ROB MARCIANO
TAKES US TO THE PART OF THE
ISLAND WHERE THE HURRICANE MADE
LANDFALL.

THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO WAVED HIM
IN, AND WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE WENT
INSIDE.

PUERTO RICO, THE FIRST LOOK AT
HURRICANE MARIA'S WRATH, AS
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES FACE A
DIFFICULT NIGHT AND AN UNCERTAIN
FUTURE.

AS THE STORM BORE DOWN ON THE
ISLAND, MANY HAD NO SAFE PLACE
TO GO.

THOSE FEROCIOUS
155-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS, THE
MOST POWERFUL SEEN HERE IN
GENERATIONS.

THE ENTIRE ISLAND STILL WITHOUT
POWER.

WE HEADED SOUTH TO WHERE MARIA
MADE LANDFALL.

NOW THAT WE'RE SOUTH OF TOWN,
WE'RE SEEING SOME DAMAGE THAT
ACTUALLY LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A
TORNADO CAME THROUGH.

CLEARLY, THIS IS THE PATH OF THE
EYE WHEN IT CAME THROUGH.

MILLIONS OF TREES OBLITERATED.

IN YOBACOA, THE TOWN DECIMATED
BY A DIRECT HIT, WE FIND
DESPERATE RESIDENTS LINING UP
FOR WATER THAT'S BEEN TRUCKED
IN.

WE NEED DIESEL FOR THE
GENERATOR.

WE NEED LIGHT.

WE NEED WATER.

ORTEZ FLAGGED US DOWN.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

WE NEED HELP, WE NEED ALL THE
HELP WE CAN GET.

HARROWING SCENES INSIDE.

THIS MAN, CLINGING TO LIFE.

NOW I SEE, WHEN THAT GENERATOR
RUNS OUT --
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

FRAIL, DEHYDRATING IN THE
SWELTERING ROOMS.

SOME WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE NOW IS
ME.

THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE.

AROUND PUERTO RICO IN DIRE
CONDITIONS.

THE GOVERNOR OUT WITH THE
NATIONAL GUARD OVERNIGHT OUTSIDE
SAN JUAN RESCUING THE STRANDED.

AND BACK AT THE NURSING HOME,
MARIA WITH A MESSAGE FOR HER
DAUGHTER BACK IN FLORIDA.

I JUST WANT TO SAY, DANEESA,
I LOVE YOU.

DANEESA, I'M HERE, WE'RE ALIVE,
I LOVE YOU.

AND ROB, I WANT TO GET BACK TO
WHAT THE CAREGIVER PLEADED FOR
AT THE NURSING HOME.

WATER, DIESEL, FOOD.

ANY IDEA TONIGHT IF AUTHORITIES
HAVE HEARD HER CALLS FOR HELP?

JUST GO OUT FOR HER.

SHE ALSO NEEDS OXYGEN, SO,
OXYGEN AND DIESEL ARE NOT
SOMETHING WE CARRY, SO, OUR TEAM
CONTACTED THE OFFICE OF
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, AND THEY
ARE AWARE OF HER DESPERATE PLEA
AND HOPEFULLY CAN GET HER THE
HELP SHE NEEDS HERE IN THE
COMING DAYS, DAVID.

JUST A DIRE SITUATION THERE.

IN THE MEANTIME, ROB, WHERE IS
THE HURRICANE TONIGHT, AND ARE
THOSE MODELS NOW IN AGREEMENT
WHEN IT COMES TO THE EAST COAST
OF THE U.S.?

A LITTLE BIT BETTER ABOUT THE
EAST COAST OF THE U.S.

RIGHT
NOW.

IT'S ABOUT 90 MILES
EAST-SOUTHEAST OF GRAND TURK
ISLAND.

HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE UP THERE.

AND IT'S BACK UP TO CATEGORY 3
STATUS, SO, FORMIDABLE STORM.

AND YOUR FORECAST TAKES IT A LOT
FARTHER NORTH AND INTO THE OPEN
OCEAN, AND LIKELY KEEPS IT
THERE.

WEAKENS IT AS IT GETS INTO
COOLER WATER.

AND THERE ARE THE MODELS.

WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT IT WILL GO
OUT TO SEA.

CERTAINLY HOPE THAT FORECAST
HOLDS, DAVID.

AND WE WILL STAY ON THE STORY OF
THAT NURSING HOME.

THERE WAS ALSO GREAT CONCERN
FOR SO MANY AMERICAN MEDICAL
STUDENTS ON DOMINICA.

TONIGHT, WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
ABOUT THOSE AMERICANS, AS WE NOW
SEE THE CATASTROPHIC IMAGES
COMING IN.

AN ISLAND WIPED OUT.

THE HARD-HIT ISLAND OF
DOMINICA -- TOTAL DEVASTATION.

NEARLY EVERYTHING DESTROYED.

ROADS RIPPED, HUGE TREES
UPROOTED, DEBRIS LITTERING THE
STREET.

AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE ARE DEAD, BUT
MANY OTHERS ARE MISSING IN
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY
CUT OFF.

AND LATE TODAY, WORD THAT 1,000
MEDICAL STUDENTS, MANY OF THEM
AMERICAN, WHOSE CONDITION WAS
UNKNOWN, HAVE BEEN REACHED AND
ARE CONFIRMED SAFE.

IN PUERTO RICO, MARIA'S WINDS
GAVE WAY TO MORE THAN 30 INCHES
OF RAIN.

OVERWHELMING RIVERS IN
LEVITTOWN.

THE POWER COMPANY USED CHERRY
PICKERS TO PLUCK RESIDENTS FROM
THEIR ROOFTOPS, FORCED TO WAIT
UNTIL THE FLOODWATERS RECEDED.

DAVID, THE RESIDENTS WHO WERE
RESCUED FROM HERE ARE BEING
TAKEN BY A NEARBY SCHOOL, WHERE
THEY HAVE SET UP A SHELTER.

THE CLEANUP PROCESS WILL LIKELY
TAKE WEEKS.

MAYBE EVEN MONTHS.
