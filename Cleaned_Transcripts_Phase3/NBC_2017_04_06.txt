BREAKING NEWS
TONIGHT A
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
PREPARING
OPTIONS FOR A MILITARY
STRIKE IN
SYRIA.

IS AMERICA ABOUT TO
WEIGH DEEPER INTO A
BLOODY CIVIL WAR AFTER
THAT HORRIFIC CHEMICAL
ATTACK.
GOOD EVENING FROM
LOS ANGELES, TO OUR
VIEWERS IN THE WEST,
AS WE COME ON THE AIR,
THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE
MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF
LAUNCHING A MAJOR
MILITARY STRIKE
AGAINST SYRIA.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SPENT
PART OF THIS DAY
HUDDLED WITH HIS TOP
MILITARY ADVISERS,
REVIEWING OPTIONS THAT
MAY INCLUDE KEEPING
SYRIA'S AIR FORCE OUT
OF THE SKY OR EVEN
CRUISE MISSILE
ATTACKS.

AS A WAY OF PUNISHING
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
FOR THAT HORRIFIC
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK EARLIER THIS
WEEK.

AND IN A MAJOR POLICY
SHIFT, THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS
SPEAKING OPENLY ABOUT
REMOVING BASHAR AL
ASSAD FROM POWER.

THIS IS THE ULTIMATE
TEST FOR A COMMANDER
IN CHIEF, WHETHER TO
TAKE MILITARY ACTION,
IN THIS CASE, AFTER A
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
THAT HAS GRIPPED THE
COUNTRY WITH THE WORLD
WATCHING.

STEPPING OFF HIS PLANE
INTO THE CENTER OF AN
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS,
PRESIDENT TRUMP
HUDDLING TONIGHT WITH
HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY
FOR AN URGENT BRIEFING
ON MILITARY OPTIONS
AGAINST BASHAR AL
ASSAD.

I THINK WHAT
HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS A
DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

AND HE'S THERE, AND I
GUESS HE'S RUNNING
THINGS, SO SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

SOMETHING SHOULD
HAPPEN, HE SAYS.

NOT SPECIFIC BUT STILL
HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL
YET HE MAY MOVE TO
PUSH ASSAD OUT.

IT'S A SERIOUS
MATTER, IT REQUIRES A
SERIOUS RESPONSE.

SECRETARY OF STATE
SUGGESTING THERE'S NO
ROLE FOR ASSAD TO
GOVERN THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE.

CALLING ON OUR ALLIES
TO ACT THROUGH THE
POLITICAL PROCESS.

THOSE STEPS ARE
UNDERWAY.

TWO MILITARY
OFFICIALS TELL NBC
NEWS THE U.S. WATCHED
ON RADAR AS A SYRIAN
PLANE DROPPED BOMBS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE COUNTRY MONDAY.

HITTING A HOSPITAL,
THE FLASHES AND BOOMS
CLEARLY VISIBLE.

VICTIMS ON THE GROUND
REACTING LIKE THEY HAD
BEEN EXPOSED TO A
NERVE AGENT.

VICTIMS LIKE THE ONES
BURIED TODAY BY ABDEL
HAMEED EL-YOUSSEF.

CRYING OUT THE NAMES
OF HIS 2-YEAR-OLD
TWINS.

HIS CHILDREN AND WIFE
AMONG THE MORE THAN
HUNDREDS OF SYRIANS
KILLED.

IMAGES LIKE THESE HAVE
HORRIFIED THE
PRESIDENT.

TRIGGERING HIS
REVERSAL ON SYRIA.

NOW JUST 11 WEEKS INTO
HIS ADMINISTRATION,
THIS CRISIS BRINGING
HIM TO THE BRINK OF A
DECISION THAT WILL
DEFINE HIS LEGACY.

IF HE DOES NOTHING,
IT'S GOING TO BE OBAMA
ON STEROIDS IN TERMS
OF HIS PERCEPTION.

IF HE ACTS DECISIVELY
AND RESPONSIBLY, HE
CAN SET THE MIDEAST.

SPOKES PERSON TODAY
TELLS THE U.S.

IT'S
SUPPORT FOR ASSAD IS
NOT CONDITIONAL.

HERE IN THE U.S., A
HIGH STAKES CRASH
COURSE, SYRIA NOW
OVERSHADOWING NORTH
KOREA.

THE COMPANY AT THE TOP
OF HIS AGENDA.

AS LANGUAGE ABOUT
THE ASSAD REGIME
CANNOT LEAD AN
UNBIASSED
INVESTIGATION.

AS FAR AS I CAN
TELL, CONGRESSMAN
NUNES KILLED THAT.

THE INVESTIGATION
CAN HAVE A FRESH
START.

THE WORK HAS ALWAYS
CONTINUED BUT NOW I
THINK THE CLOUD THAT
HAD SETTLED OVER THE
COMMITTEE'S WORK HAS
BEEN LIFTED.

SCHIFF ALSO SAYS
HE'S OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
WORKING WITH THE
REPUBLICAN TAKING OVER
THE PROBE.

CONGRESSMAN MIKE KONYA
WAY OF TEXAS, TELLING
REPORTERS HERE AT THE
CAPITOL HE WILL FOLLOW
EVERY LEAD IN THIS
INVESTIGATION NO
MATTER HOW LONG IT
TAKES.
