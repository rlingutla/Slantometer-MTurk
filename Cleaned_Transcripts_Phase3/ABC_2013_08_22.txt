HOMELAND.

WE TURN OVERSEAS TO SYRIA
AND THE STUNNING NUMBERS TONIGHT

DEPARTMENT, POTENTIALLY MORE
THAN 1,000 VICTIMS IN THE LATEST
POSSIBLE CHEMICAL ATTACKS, THE
WORLD STILL STUDYING THOSE
DISTURBING IMAGES, THE VICTIMS,
INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF
THIS NEWEST ATTACK.

THIS EVENING THAT DISTURBING
HEADLINE FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT
WHAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT NOW.

U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE ON
THE GROUND FACING HUGE HURDLES
TRYING TO DETERMINE IF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WERE, IN FACT, ACCUSED.

RACING
TO FIND OUT WHETHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS KILLED THESE MEN, WOMEN
AND CHILDREN AND JUST HOW MANY
DIED.

TODAY A SHOCKING NEW NUMBER FROM
OPPOSITION GROUPS REVEALED IN
WASHINGTON.

THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES
WE'VE SEEN RANGE FROM 1,000 TO
1800 WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A BROAD
SAYS THE CLAIMS THAT IT CARRIED
OUT A CHEMICAL ATTACK ARE
BASELESS.

BUT THE WORLD IS REACTING
SWIFTLY AND FORCEFULLY.

AS U.N. INVESTIGATORS BEG FOR
ACCESS TO THE SITE, THE EVIDENCE
MAY BE QUICKLY DISSIPATING.

DAVID, TONIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA

POSE A THREAT TO OUR HOMELAND.

OUR SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT
PIERRE THOMAS SAT DOWN WITH FBI
DIRECTOR ROBERT MULLER TODAY.

WE KNOW MULLER IS ABOUT TO
STEP DOWN AFTER 12 YEARS.

THIS WAS REALLY SOMETHING TODAY
IN YOUR INTERVIEW EXPRESSING
REAL CONCERN ABOUT AMERICANS ON
THE GROUND IN SYRIA?

REPORTER THE FBI DIRECTOR IS
CONCERNED ABOUT RADICALS WHO
HAVE GONE TO FIGHT INCLUDING
MEMBERS OF AL QAEDA, AND HE SAID
THERE IS INTELLIGENCE AMERICANS
MAY HAVE JOINED THEM.

YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT
THEY -- NUMBER ONE, THE
ASSOCIATIONS THEY WILL MAKE AND
SECONDLY, THE EXPERTISE THEY
WILL DEVELOP AND WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WILL UTILIZE THAT EXPERTISE
TO UNDERTAKE AN ATTACK IN THE
HOMELAND.

SO, YES, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
THAT.

AS HE GETS READY TO LEAVE HIS
POST, PIERRE, YOU ASKED WHAT
STILL KEEPS HIM UP AT NIGHT AND
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

ALWAYS.

HE WORRIES ABOUT TERRORISTS
TAKING ON A PLANE WITH A BOMB OR
USING BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

HE SAID THOSE THREATS ARE VERY,
VERY REAL.
