THE MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS.

POLICE BODY CAMS SHOWING
OFFICERS RESPONDING.

AND WHAT WE'VE JUST LEARNED
ABOUT THE GUNMAN.

AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING
WHETHER HE CHECKED INTO MULTIPLE
HOTELS ON THE EVE OF THE
SHOOTING.

ALL WITH A VIEW OF THE CONCERT.

ALSO, THE GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND,
BACK IN THE U.S., BEING
QUESTIONED BY THE FBI TONIGHT.

PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR THROUGH
THE AIRPORT.

WHAT HAS SHE REVEALED?

DID SHE KNOW ANYTHING?

OUR TEAM STANDING BY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HERE IN LAS
VEGAS.

WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE
SURVIVORS.

THE WOUNDS HE SAW FIRST-HAND.

AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS NOW
SAYING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

AND AS WE COME ON THE AIR, WE
ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS.

ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED OF THE
GUNMAN'S EXTRAORDINARY PLANNING.

POSSIBLY CHECKING INTO MULTIPLE
HOTELS BEFORE THE ATTACK, ALL
WITHIN SHOOTING DISTANCE OF THAT
CONCERT SITE.

JUST AS WE ALSO SEE THE POLICE
RESPONSE THROUGH THEIR BODY
CAMS.

THE OFFICERS TAKING COVER, THEN
JUMPING INTO ACTION, TRYING TO
HELP THE THOUSANDS RUNNING FOR
THEIR LIVES.

AND INSIDE THAT HOTEL ROOM,
IMAGES OF HIS DEADLY ARSENAL.

23 WEAPONS.

HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION.

AND WE HAVE NEW REPORTING
TONIGHT ON THE SECURITY GUARD,
THE FIRST PERSON TO GET TO THAT
HOTEL HALLWAY, TO THE DOOR OF
THAT HOTEL ROOM.

BEFORE THE GUNMAN SHOT HIM RIGHT
THROUGH IT.

THAT GUARD, STILL ABLE TO TELL
POLICE HE'D FOUND THE GUNMAN.

BODY CAMERAS REVEAL OFFICERS
RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES AMID
UNCEASING GUNFIRE.

HEY, YOU GUYS, GET DOWN!

GO THAT WAY!

GET OUT OF HERE, THERE'S
GUNSHOTS COMING FROM OVER THERE.

GO THAT WAY!

AND BULLETS FLYING, OFFICERS
HUDDLED BEHIND A WALL, TRYING TO
PINPOINT THE SOURCE OF THE
MAYHEM.

NORTH OF THE MANDALAY BAY.

IT'S COMING OUT OF A WINDOW.

EXTRAORDINARY CALM, THOSE
OFFICERS DIRECTING CONCERT-GOERS
AWAY FROM THE SHOOTING TO
SAFETY.

THIS WAY, THIS WAY, THIS WAY.

GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

THAT WAY, THAT WAY, THAT WAY.

BEFORE S.W.A.T.

TEAMS BREACHED
STEPHEN PADDOCK'S LUXURY SUITE.

HE'D BEEN HOLED UP WITH THAT
MASSIVE ARSENAL, 23 GUNS IN ALL.

AND TONIGHT, THESE PHOTOS
REVEALING THEIR DESTRUCTIVE
POWER.

THIS ASSAULT RIFLE, ONE OF 12
OUTFITTED WITH AN ATTACHMENT
CALLED A BUMP STOCK.

IT ALLOWS THE GUN TO FIRE
CONTINUOUSLY LIKE AN AUTOMATIC
WEAPON.

THIS VIDEO DEMONSTRATING HOW IT
WORKS.

ON THE TIP OF THE RIFLE, A FLASH
HIDER, MAKING ITS FIERY BLAST
DIFFICULT TO SPOT.

AND IN THE CORNER, A PILE OF 17
MAGAZINES HOLDING 100 ROUNDS
EACH.

YOU'RE LOOKING AT 1,700 BULLETS.

PADDOCK ALSO INSTALLING HIS OWN
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.

A CAMERA HIDDEN ON HIS ROOM
SERVICE CART, ANOTHER BEHIND THE
PEEPHOLE, LOOKING DOWN THE HALL.

ALL RIGGED SO HE COULD SEE
POLICE APPROACHING.

AND NOW, WE ARE LEARNING HE
SPOTTED A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD.

HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THE
ROOM WHEN THE SUSPECT FIRED
THROUGH THE DOOR AT THE SECURITY
GUARD AND STRUCK HIM.

JESUS CAMPOS.

AND HAILED AS A HERO.

SOMEHOW, HE WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY
AND TELL THE TACTICAL TEAM THAT
PADDOCK WAS IN ROOM 135.

AN HOUR LATER, THEY BREACHED THE
DOOR --
HIM ALREADY DEAD.

TONIGHT, FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
SOURCES TELLING ABC NEWS THEY
ARE INVESTIGATING REPORTS THAT
THE DAY BEFORE THE MASSACRE, HE
CHECKED INTO MULTIPLE HOTELS
OVERLOOKING THE CONCERT VENUE.

AND HE MAY HAVE LOOKED FOR OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES.

FEDERAL SOURCES SAY HE LOOKED
INTO RENTING A ROOM IN THIS
BUILDING RIGHT NEXT TO ANOTHER
MUSIC FESTIVAL JUST THE WEEK
BEFORE.

AND FROM THIS PERCH, HE WOULD
HAVE HAD A CLEAR FIELD OF FIRE,
RIGHT DOWN INTO THOSE TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO
THAT CONCERT BELOW.

BUT FOR SOME REASON, HE DIDN'T
PURSUE THE PLAN, INSTEAD, HE
WAITED A WEEK FOR THE HARVEST
FESTIVAL.

AND MATT GUTMAN JOINS US LIVE
TONIGHT HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

AND MATT, WE NOW KNOW, HE MAY
HAVE HAD SEVERAL HOTEL OPTIONS
FOR THIS ATTACK, ULTIMATELY
SPENDING MORE THAN THREE DAYS IN
THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL RIGHT
BEHIND ME.

AND YOU'RE LEARNING WHAT HE
MIGHT HAVE DONE THE DAY BEFORE?

WE'RE LEARNING HE WASN'T JUST
SHUTTERED UP IN THAT LUXURY
SUITE IN THAT HOTEL.

NOW, LAW ENFORCEMENT HASN'T
WEIGHED IN ON THIS YET.

BUT I SPOKE TO A CASINO WORKER
WHO SAID THEY SAW HIM PLAY HIGH
STAKES VIDEO POKER FOR EIGHT
CONTINUOUS HOURS THE MORNING OF
THE ATTACK.

16 HOURS THAT WEEKEND.

AND WHAT MAKES THIS SO URNG IS
MILLING ABOUT WITH THE PUBLIC AT
THAT HOTEL, OUT IN THE OPEN, FOR
DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK.

AND THE OTHER MAJOR
DEVELOPMENT, THE GUNMAN'S
GIRLFRIEND, SHE IS BACK IN THE
U.S. TONIGHT, BEING QUESTIONED
NOW BY THE FBI.

HER BROTHER TELLING ABC NEWS
THAT SHE ASSURED HER FAMILY SHE
HAS A, QUOTE, CLEAN CONSCIENCE.

BUT TONIGHT, SHE REMAINS A
PERSON OF INTEREST, AS THEY NOW
ASK, HOW THE GUNMAN ASSEMBLED
SUCH AN ARSENAL WITHOUT ANYONE
NOTICING.

HOURS AFTER SHE ARRIVED ON A
HTIGFLM RO FPHTH
SHOOTER'S LONG-TIME GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, TOLD THE FBI,
ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS, THAT SHE HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PLANS OR HIS
PURCHASE OF SO MANY GUNS.

HER LAWYER READ HER STATEMENT
AFTER THE FBI SESSION ENDED.

HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME
OR TOOK ANY ACTION THAT I WAS
AWARE OF THAT I UNDERSTOOD IN
ANY WAY TO BE A WARNING THAT
SOMETHING HORRIBLE LIKE THIS WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

PADDOCK'S LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND FO.

HE MET HER WHEN SHE WAS A CASINO
HOSTESS.

THEY GAMBLED TOGETHER, PLAYING
VIDEO POKER AND THE SLOTS.

INVESTIGATORS WANT TO KNOW IF HE
WENT ALONG WHEN SHE TRAVELED TO
DUBAI, WHERE SHE POSTED THIS
SMILING PHOTO.

ACCORDING TO HER SISTERS IN
AUSTRALIA, WHO WANTED THEIR
FACES BLURRED, NO ONE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT PADDOCK.

NO ONE CAN PUT THE PUZZLES
TOGETHER.

NO ONE.

IT WAS PADDOCK WHO SENT HER TO
THE FILL PEEPS JUST TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE SHOOTING.

HE SENT HER AWAY, SO THAT HE
HE CAN PLAN WHAT HE IS PLANNING
WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS.

PROFILE OF THE SHOOTER.

A 64-YEAR-OLD ONE-TIME
ACCOUNTANT AND IRS AGENT, WHO
CLAIMED TO BE A
MULTIMILLIONAIRE.

BUT INVESTIGATORS SAY A PICTURE
IS EMERGING OF A MAN "DESCENDING
INTO MADNESS," LOSING WEIGHT,
DIMINISHED PHYSICAL APPEARANCE,
WHAT ARE DESCRIBED AS "CRAZY
EYES."

COUPLED WITH EASY ACCESS TO THE
POWERFUL WEAPONS HE BEGAN TO
ACCUMULATE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO,
A DEADLY COMBINATION.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD YOUR REPORT
THERE, THE SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND
SPENT HOURS TODAY TALKING TO THE
FBI.

BUT SHE IS DENYING KNOWING
OFFICIALS SAY SHE CLAIMS SHE HAD
NO IDEA ABOUT THE DOZENS OF GUNS
HER BOYFRIEND BOUGHT OVER THE
LAST YEAR, AND AS YOU SAID, HER
BROTHER TELLS ABC NEWS, SHE TOLD
HER FAMILY SHE HAS A CLEAN
CONSCIENCE, DAVID.

PRESIDENT TRUMP, MEANWHILE,
WAS HERE IN LAS VEGAS TODAY.

IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S HAD TO
VISIT THE SCENE OF A MASS
SHOOTING, MEETING WITH
SURVIVORS.

WHAT HE SAID TO DOCTORS AND
NURSES HERE, AND WHAT HE'S NOW
SAYING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

PRESIDENT TRUMP, IN A NEW
ROLE --
COMFORTER IN CHIEF.

WITH THE FIRST LADY BY HIS SIDE,
THEIR FIRST STOP, THE HOSPITAL
TREATING DOZENS OF PATIENTS,
STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.

SOME WERE VERY, VERY BADLY
WOUNDED AND THEY WERE BADLY
WOUNDED BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO
LEAVE, THEY WANTED TO HELP
OTHERS, BECAUSE THEY SAW PEOPLE
GOING DOWN ALL OVER.

AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING TO
SEE.

THERE'S TREMENDOUS BRAVERY.

SURVIVORS.

BUT THIS WAS ALSO A THANK YOU
TOUR.

IT MAKES YOU VERY PROUD TO BE AN
AMERICAN, WHEN YOU SEE THE JOB
THAT THEY'VE DONE.

CENTER, SURROUNDED BY FIRST
RESPONDERS, THE PRESIDENT
PRAISING THEIR HEROISM, LIKE
THESE DISPATCH OPERATORS WHO
ANSWERED THOSE FRANTIC CALLS FOR
HELP.

CALM AND STRONG, SHARP.

HAD HARSH WORDS.

HE'S A SICK, DEMENTED MAN.

A MESSAGE OF UNITY --
 AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN
MOURNING.

AMERICANS DEFIED DEATH AND
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH
COURAGE.

ABOUT GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY GROWS
LOUDER, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF,
NOT WILLING TO GO THERE, NOT
TODAY.

DOES AMERICA HAVE A GUN
VIOLENCE PROBLEM?

WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THAT TODAY.

CECILIA, THE PRESIDENT SAID ANY
DISCUSSION ABOUT GUNS WILL COME
DOWN THE ROAD TODAY, BUT ON
CAPITOL HILL TODAY, THERE WAS A
ALREADY A LOT OF FOCUS ON WHAT
ARE CALLED BUMP STOCK
ATTACHMENTS THAT MATT REPORTED
ON, THAT CAN ESSENTIALLY TURN
ASSAULT RIFLES INTO AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS WHEN THEY'RE ATTACHED.

AND THERE IS WORD TONIGHT THAT
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND TWO
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE TALKING
ABOUT LEGISLATION TO BAN THEM?

A HANDFUL OF SENATE REPUBLICANS
SEEM OPEN AN IDEA OF HOLDING
HEARINGS ON THIS SUBJECT.

A SIMILAR MOVEMENT IS AFOOT IN
THE HOUSE, AS WELL.

BUT SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

A VOTE SEEMS LIKE A LONG WAY
OFF.

THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
MOMENT THAT PLAYED OUT HERE
TODAY, AFTER AN INTERVIEW WE
BROUGHT YOU LAST NIGHT HERE.

A SON, WHO WAS AT THE CONCERT
SHOT, AND THEN SAVED BY A YOUNG
MAN WHO HELD PRESSURE TO HIS
WOUNDS ALL THE WAY TO THE
HOSPITAL, STAYING NEXT TO HIM IN
THE E.R.

HE TOLD US HE WANTED TO MEET
THAT HERO, AND SOMEONE HEARD
THAT LAST NIGHT.

TONIGHT HERE, THE LIST OF
HEROES, AND WHAT HAPPENED IN
THAT VERY SAME HOSPITAL ROOM
TODAY.

TONIGHT, THE NEW STORIES NOW
EMERGING OF THE QUIET HEROES WHO
SAVED SO MANY LIVES HERE.

MIKE KORDICH, A FIREFIGHTER, WAS
GIVING CPR TO SOMEONE WHEN HE
WAS SHOT IN THE ARM.

I KEPT DOING CHEST
COMPRESSIONS WITH ONE ARM UNTIL
I NOTICED I WAS STARTING TO
VANDERSTAY HIT BY A BULLET AND
SHRAPNEL.

CONCERT-GOERS DRIVING HER TO THE
HOSPITAL, KEEPING PRESSURE ON
HER WOUNDS.

IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT CAB
DRIVER, I WOULDN'T BE HERE,
SO -- AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

5-YEAR-OLD AIDEN HUSER,
SEPARATED FROM HIS MOTHER WHEN
THE SHOOTING BEGAN.

I LOST HER, AND I WAS SAD.

I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO RUN.

LINDSEY ROGERS, SAW HIM STANDING
ALONE, SHE STAYED BY HIS SIDE.

HE WAS REALLY BRAVE AND
REALLY GOOD.

FACEBOOK.

HIS RELATIVES SAW IT.

HE'S BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS
MOTHER.

AND IT WAS LAST NIGHT HERE, WE
WALKED INTO THAT ROOM AT DESERT
SPRINGS HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER
HERE IN LAS VEGAS, WHERE SHELDON
MACK IS RECOVERING.

SHELDON?

MIND STILL, IT JUST -- HAUNTS
THE MAN WHO HE SAYS SAVED HIS
LIFE.

SOME HERO CAME AND SAVED ME,
HIS FINGER TO THE BULLET WOUND.

HELPING HIM AND NEVER LEAVING
HIS SIDE.

THE GUY THAT WAS BY YOUR SIDE,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND
OUT WHERE HE IS --
 NO.

YEAH, I NEED TO.

I -- I OWE HIM A BEER, AT LEAST.

YEAH, I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL
HE'S DONE FOR ME.

GOOD TRADEOFF.

SHELDON'S PARENTS TELLING US,
THEY WANT TO MEET THAT HERO.

HE'S AN ANGEL AND SAVED HIM.

WE'D LOVE TO FIND THAT FELLA.

APPARENTLY HE WAS SHOT IN THE
LEG, AS WELL.

FRIENDS OF THAT HERO WERE
WATCHING THE NEWS LAST NIGHT.

JIMMY GROVER, A 25-YEAR-OLD
PARAMEDIC FROM ORANGE COUNTY,
CALIFORNIA, WAS HERE IN LAS
VEGAS VISITING.

AND TODAY, HE PAID ANOTHER
VISIT, WALKING INTO THAT ROOM ON
CRUTCHES.

JIMMY REVEALING HE KNEW SHELDON
WAS IN TROUBLE AFTER BEING SHOT
IN THE ARM AND THEN THE BULLET
PIERCING THE ABDOMEN, AS WELL.

AND HE RODE WITH HIM IN A TRUCK
ALL THE WAY TO THAT E.R.

SHELDON'S MOM, GRATEFUL.

AND AFTERWARD, THERE WAS ONE
MORE REUNION IN THAT SAME ROOM.

ERIC FRAZIER, THE MARINE VET WHO
DROVE BOTH JIMMY AND SHELDON TO
THE HOSPITAL, IT TURNS OUT THAT
MARINE VET RUSHED A DOZEN
VICTIMS TO THE E.R. THAT NIGHT.

AND TONIGHT, THE SURVIVOR'S
FAMILY AND THE HERO'S FAMILY,
ALL TOGETHER AFTER THE HORROR.

AND BY THE WAY, SHELDON'S DAD
TOLD US TONIGHT THAT HIS SON
TOLD HIS HERO, JIMMY, HE'S GOING
TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE OF
A BEER, AND SOON.

AND WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS
HERE IN LAS VEGAS TODAY, HE WAS
ALSO ASKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

WHEN WE COME BACK TONIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT.

THE SONG THAT MOVED EVERYONE
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

FINALLY TONIGHT, AMERICA
STRONG.

WE SEE IT EVERYWHERE HERE, THE
ACTS OF KINDNESS.

STRENGTH AND RESOLVE OF THIS
COMMUNITY.

WE SEE IT IN THE FACES HERE,
AMID UNIMAGINABLE GRIEF, FINDING
COMFORT IN ONE ANOTHER.

IN THE SHADOW OF SUCH HORROR, A
MESSAGE OF SOLIDARITY.

OUR PRAYERS FOR THE VICTIMS.

OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE FIRST
RESPONDERS.

THIS FAMILY PAUSING TO HUG A
POLICE OFFICER.

AND AT THE CANYON RIDGE
CHRISTIAN CHURCH, THOUSANDS OF
VOICES UNITING IN ONE POWERFUL
CHORUS.
