THE FBI SAYS THEY WANT EVERYBODY
TO HELP FIND THESE TWO MEN ON
THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE. PERSONS OF INTEREST IN THE
BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING. WE'LL TAKE YOU FRAME BY FRAME
THROUGH THE VIDEO. WHY THE FBI SAYS, LOOK AT EVERY
DETAIL. AND THE BREAKTHROUGH COMES AS AN
EMOTIONAL PRESIDENT TONIGHT HAS
A MESSAGE FOR THE BOMBERS.
WE WILL FIND YOU.AND, YES, YOU WILL FACE JUSTICE.

THE FBI RELEASING SURVEILLANCE
TAPES.

TWO PEOPLE CALLED PERSONS OF
INTEREST IN THE MARATHON-DAY
BOMBINGS.

THE FBI CONSIDERS THEM ARMED,
DANGEROUS, ASKED THAT NO ONE
APPROACH THEM.

BUT THEY ASK ALL MEMBERS OF THE
PUBLIC TO LOOK AT THESE TAPES,
TO STUDY THEM IN DETAIL AND
HELP.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES NOW BELIEVE
THAT A TEAM OF AT LEAST TWO MEN
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS
HERE.

AS YOU SAY, DESCRIBED AS ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

THE FBI IS BASING ITS TWO-BOMBER
THEORY ON THESE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA VIDEOS AND STILL PICTURES
MADE PUBLIC LATE TODAY.

ACCORDING TO THE FBI.

ONE WITH A BLACK CAP, THE SECOND
WITH A WHITE CAP WORN BACKWARDS.

BOTH WEARING BACKPACKS THAT THE
FBI BELIEVE HELD THE BOMBS.

OFF TO THE SIDE OF THIS VIDEO,
RUNNERS CAN BE SEEN HEADING TO
THE FINISH LINE AND TIME CODE
MARKERS INDICATE THE FOOTAGE WAS
MADE ABOUT 13 MINUTES BEFORE THE
FIRST BOMB WENT OFF.

THE FBI SAYS ONLY ONE OF THE TWO
POTENTIAL SUSPECTS, THE ONE WITH
THE WHITE CAP, WAS ACTUALLY SEEN
PLACING HIS BACKPACK AT THE
SCENE OF AN EXPLOSION.

WE ARE RELEASING PHOTOS OF
THESE TWO SUSPECTS.

RE IDENTIFT O.

THEY APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED.

MADE THE IMAGES PUBLIC NOW
BECAE THEY ND
THE FACES TO NAMES.

BUT THEY WARN THESE ARE
DANGEROUS MEN.

WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

DEVELOPMENTS TODAY BASED ON THE
SOME 300 PIECES OF EVIDENCE
RECOVERED FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

SOME OF THE COMPONENTS,
INCLUDING THIS BATTERY, AND THIS
CIRCUIT BOARD, WERE RECOGNIZED
BY HOBBYISTS AS PARTS OF A TOY
REMOTE CONTROL CAR, SIMILAR TO
THIS ONE SEEN IN AN ONLINE
VIDEO.

THE OWNER OF ONE HOBBY STORE
OUTSIDE BOSTON SAID FBI AGENTS
INTERVIEWED HIM LAST NIGHT AND
LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT A REMOTE
CONTROLLED UNIT HAD BEEN USED IN
THE BOMBS.

IT LOOKED TO ME THAT ONE OF
THE COMPONENTS WAS A RADIO
RECEIVER.

THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS DEAD ON.

INSTRUCTIONS ON THE INTERNET
ABOUT HOW TO USE A REMOTE
CONTROLLED TOY CAR TO SET OFF A
BOMB, BOTH FROM "THE ANARCHIST
COOKBOOK" AND SEVERAL JIHADIST
SITES AS WELL.

THERE IS STILL NO INDICATION OF
WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACT OF
FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM,
BUT THE PRESIDENT VOWED TODAY
THE BOMBERS, WHOEVER THEY ARE,
WILL NOT ESCAPE.

YES, WE WILL FIND YOU.

AND, YES, YOU WILL FACE JUSTICE.

IS WHAT ONE OFFICIAL CALLED AN
ELECTRONIC DRAGNET, PUSHING
THESE IMAGES FAR AND WIDE TO
ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN THE HUNT.

A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL TELLS ME E WO
SUSPECTS IS SEEN IN ANHER
VIO MAKING A CELLPHONE CALL
AROUND THE TIME OF THE
EXNS.

THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CELLPHONE
WAS USED TO TRIGGER ONE OF THE
EXPLOSIONS.

THE OFFICIALS SAID A MASSIVE
EFFORT IS UNDER WAY TO CAPTURE
EVERY CELLPHONE CALL IN THAT
LOCAL AREA AT THE TIME OF THE
BOMBINGS, TO SEE IF THEY CAN
TRACE IT BACK TO THE BOMBER.

THE SOURCE SAID IT'S A
TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS BUT A TOP
PRIORITY.

AS YOU WATCH THE TAPES GO BY
PIERRE, AND YOU'VE STUDIED THESE
SO OFTEN, TELL US THE KIND OF
DETAIL THE FBI IS ASKING
EVERYONE TO NOTICE.

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE
AS YOU LOOK AT THE TAPE IS THAT
THE BLACK BACKPACK IS ONE
CRITICAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME THAT
BACKPACK IS THE ONE THAT THEY
RECOVERED THE MOST MATERIAL
FROM.

THE OTHER THING IS THAT EVERY
PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN THAT FRAME,
THE HAT, THE COAT, THE PANTS,
THEY WANT THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT
THAT BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE WOULD
NOTICE.

AND TO LOOK OVER EVERY FRAME BY
FRAME, THEY SENT EVERYONE TO THE
WEBSITE, FBI.GOV TO CHECK IT
OUT.

AS WE SAID, THE PRESIDENT
TODAY DELIVERED A SUMMONS, A
PROMISE, AND A BLAZING TRIBUTE
IN BOSTON.

WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE.

IF THEY SOUGHT TO INTIMIDATE
US, TO TERRORIZE US, IT SHOULD
BE PRETTY CLEAR BY NOW THAT THEY
PICKED THE WRONG CITY TO DO IT.

[ APPLAUSE ]
 NOT HERE IN BOSTON,
NOT HERE IN BOSTON.

BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR FEET.

AT OTHERS, HE BROUGHT THEM TO
T THSSE WAS ALWAYS TO
 AS YOU BEGIN THIS LONG
JOURNEY OFECER AY, WLLITYOU AS T
STAND AND WALK AND, YES, RUN
AGAIN -- OF THAT I HAVE NO
DOUBT, YOU WILL RUN AGAIN.

[ APPLAUSE ]
CHEERS WERE ABRUPTLY SILENCED
MARATHON DAY, THE PRESIDENT
TODAY ROUSED THEM ONCE AGAIN.

AMONG THEM FAMILIES OF THE
VICTIMS.

AND RUNNERS, IN THOSE SIGNATURE
MARATHON JACKETS.

WE MAY BE MOMENTARILY KNOCKED
OFF OUR FEET, BUT WE'LL PICK
OURSELVES UP.

WE'LL KEEP GOING.

WE WILL FINISH THE RACE.

THE ANGUISH, STILL SO FRESH FROM
THE PARISHIONERS TO THE
PRESIDENT HIMSELF.

THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO LINED
THE STREETS OUTSIDE OF THE
CHURCH HERE TODAY, THEY COULDN'T
HEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA OR ANYONE
ELSE INSIDE.

THEY SIMPLY STOOD SILENTLY IN A
SHOW OF SUPPORT.
