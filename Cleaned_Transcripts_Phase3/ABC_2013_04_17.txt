TONIGHT, BREAK IN THE CASE.

NEW LEADS ON THE BOMBER AT THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

WAS THE BOMBER CAUGHT ON TAPE BY
A STORE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA?

AND IN THEIR OWN WORDS,
TONIGHT AS THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON
RECOVER, THEIR PROUD MESSAGE TO
THE WORLD. 

WE'RE A STRONG PEOPLE.

AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET
ANYONE PUSH US AROUND. YOU MESS WITH ONE OF US, YOU
MESS WITH ALL OF US.

WE BEGIN IN BOSTON TONIGHT AMID
REPORTS OF A BREAK IN THE CASE.

AND HERE'S THE QUESTION --
HAS THE BOMBER BEEN SPOTTED
ON A SURVEILLANCE TAPE?

AS WE'VE HEARD THERE WAS
VIDEOTAPE EVERYWHERE AT THAT
MOMENT ON THAT DAY OF THE
MARATHON.

EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE
IMAGES.

AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT ON THIS
NIGHT, 62 INJURED ARE STILL
FIGHTING FOR RECOVERY IN THE
HOSPITAL, AND 12 OF THEM REMAIN
IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

PUT OUT THE WORD TODAY, JUST 48
HOURS AFTER THE BOMBS WENT OFF,
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE
BOMBER.

THE DEVELOPMENTS CAME ON A DAY
OF UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS
AND A SERIOUS CASE OF SECURITY
JITTERS.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

COURTHOUSE, WHERE ANY SUSPECT
WOULD STAND TRIAL, WAS EVACUATED
LATE THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE OF
A BOMB THREAT THAT,
UNDERSTANDABLY, WAS TAKEN VERY
SERIOUSLY.

WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU?

CODE RED EVACUATION.

CODE RED, EVACUATE THE
BUILDING.

BUT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE
FORCED A POSTPONEMENT OF A NEWS
CONFERENCE WHERE OFFICIALS HAD
PLANNED TO TALK ABOUT A POSSIBLE
SUSPECT.

AUTHORITIES SAY THE FBI IS
FOCUSED ON PHOTOGRAPHS,
INCLUDING SOME TAKEN BY A
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA AT THE
LORD & TAYLOR STORE, THAT SHOW
A MAN IN THE RACE-DAY CROWD,
USING A CELLPHONE, WITH A BLACK
BAG STRAPPED ACROSS HIS CHEST
THAT AUTHORITIES SAY MAY CONTAIN
THE BOMB.

THE KEY FRAMES ARE JUST A FEW OF
THE MILLIONS OF FRAMES OF VIDEO
EXAMINED IN THE LAST 36 HOURS BY
A SPECIAL TEAM OF FBI FORENSIC
EXPERTS, THE OPERATIONAL
TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.

THEY HAVE SET UP FACILITIES AT
A RESTRICTED LOCATION NEAR THE
BOSTON HARBOR.

AND THEY ARE MASTERS AT WHAT IS
KNOWN AS FACIAL RECOGNITION,
THE NEW SCIENCE OF CONVERTING A
FACE INTO A NAME, DEMONSTRATED
HERE BY AN INDIANA COMPANY THAT
WAS USED BY THE FBI FOLLOWING
THE 9/11 ATTACKS.

IN THIS INVESTIGATION, THERE
WILL BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
IMAGES.

IF THEY HAVE A SUSPECT
IDENTIFIED, THEY KNOW THE AREA
THAT SUSPECT WAS IN, THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO THEN TRACK THE PERSON
BACK TO AN IMAGE AND SAY, HERE
WE HAVE HIM.

ARE ALSO EXAMINING TINY BITS OF
DEBRIS RECOVERED AT THE CRIME
SCENE.

THERE ARE WIRE FRAGMENTS WITH
MANUFACTURING NAMES, TINY NAILS
USED AS SHRAPNEL, AS WELL AS THE
MANGLED REMAINS OF THE PRESSURE
COOKER THAT AGENTS SAY WAS USED
TO BUILD THE BOMB, AND MAY WELL
HAVE FINGERPRINTS STILL ON IT.

ONE OF THE KEYS IN ANY TRIAL
IS LINKING THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE
TO THE SUSPECT.

IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO
MATCH THE BOMB TO THE BAD GUY.

IS ARRESTED WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY FACE AT LEAST THREE
COUNTS OF PREMEDITATED MURDER,
FOR THE DEATHS OF 8-YEAR-OLD
MARTIN RICHARD, 29-YEAR-OLD
KRYSTLE CAMPBELL, AND THE THIRD
VICTIM IDENTIFIED JUST TODAY,
BOSTON UNIVERSITY GRADUATE
STUDENT LINGZI LU, A NATIVE OF
CHINA.

THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS A
THOUSAND AGENTS ASSIGNED TO THIS
CASE.

TONIGHT THERE'S A SENSE FROM
MANY OF THEM THAT THEY'RE
GETTING MUCH CLOSER.

WE WANT TO BRING IN RICHARD
CLARK, WHO IS WAS A NATIONAL
COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISER AT THE
WHITE HOUSE UNDER TWO
ADMINISTRATIONS.

THERE'S GOOD NEWS THERE
APPARENTLY THAT THEY HAVE SOME
FACES.

SO WE MAY BE IN ONE OF THOSE
CASES THAT GETS CRACKED QUICKLY.

TOO EARLY TO TELL YET.

YOU REMINDED US THAT THEY PUT
BACK TOGETHER THE PLANE AT
LOCKERBIE PAN AM 103.

IT WAS A 747 THAT BLEW UP AT
ALTITUDE, SPREAD OVER A HUNDRED
SQUARE MILES.

THE FBI PUT THAT PLANE BACK
TOGETHER JUST AS THEY ARE TODAY
PUTTING THE BOMBS BACK TOGETHER.

I KNOW YOU'LL BE STANDING BY
WITH US THROUGHOUT THE EVENING
AS WE BRING EVERYONE THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS.

AND WE HAVE A FOOTNOTE ON
THE TRAGIC EVENTS IN BOSTON FROM
COMEDIAN STEPHEN COLBERT WHO
USED LAUGHTER TO CREATE A
MESSAGE IN TRIBUTE TO THE TOUGH
PEOPLE OF A GREAT AMERICAN CITY.

NOTHING THESE TERRORISTS DO
WILL SHAKE THEM.

FOR PETE SAKE, BOSTON WAS
FOUNDED BY THE PILGRIMS, A
PEOPLE SO TOUGH THEY HAD TO
BUCKLE THEIR [ BLEEP ] HATS ON.

THESE MANIACS HAVE TRIED TO
MAKE LIFE BAD FOR THE PEOPLE OF
BOSTON, BUT ALL THEY CAN EVER DO
IS SHOW JUST HOW GOOD THOSE
PEOPLE ARE.

AND ON THAT VERY NOTE, STAY
WITH US, BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE
AROUND THE COUNTRY WERE SINGING
BOSTON'S FAVORITE ANTHEM TODAY.

AND FINALLY TONIGHT, WE WERE
GLAD SO MANY OF YOU LOVED
HEARING THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON
SEND OUT THEIR OWN MESSAGE TO
THE WORLD LAST NIGHT.

SO WE THOUGHT TONIGHT WE'D GO
BACK TO THEM FOR EVEN MORE, A
SPIRITED, RALLYING CRY DELIVERED
AS ONLY BOSTONIANS CAN.

♪
 THIS IS A CLOSE-KNIT PLACE,
THE CITY OF BOSTON.

HERE WE KNOW OUR NEIGHBORS.

WE GRIEVE FOR THEM.

AS AN AMERICAN, MY HEART IS
BROKEN.

BUT AS A BOSTONIAN, MY RESOLVE
FOR THE PURSUIT OF FREEDOM AND
LIBERTY HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER.

I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THE
BOSTONIANS.

PEOPLE WERE GIVING US WATER,
FOOD, BLANKETS TO WRAP ON.

EVERYBODY WAS LENDING A HAND --
AND THESE ARE COMPLETE
STRANGERS.

♪
 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WE
ARE, WHAT AMERICA IS, HOW WE
RESPOND TO EVIL, THAT'S IT.

SELFLESSLY, COMPASSIONATELY,
UNAFRAID.

♪
 WE'RE STRONG PEOPLE AND WE'RE
NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE PUSH US
AROUND.

YOU MESS WITH ONE OF US, YOU
MESS WITH ALL OF US.

THAT'S WHO WE ARE.

WE'RE FIGHTERS.

WE WILL NOT BE BULLIED.

WE WILL NOT BE PUSHED AROUND.

WE WILL NOT LET SOMEONE FORCE US
TO BE AFRAID OF OUR OWN SHADOW
IN THE CITY WE CALL HOME.

WE MUST NOT FEED THE TERROR.

THIS IS AMERICA, AND EVEN
GREATER THAN THAT, THIS IS
BOSTON -- A HOME OF THE PATRIOT.
