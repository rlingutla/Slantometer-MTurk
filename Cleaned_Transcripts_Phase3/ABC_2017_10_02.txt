AND TONIGHT, RIGHT HERE, THE
AUDIO, AS S.W.A.T.

TEAMS MOVE

HOTEL DOOR.

POLICE DISCOVERING AN ARSENAL
OF WEAPONS.

THE SHOOTER TAKING HIS OWN LIFE.

A 64-YEAR-OLD LIVING IN A
RETIREMENT COMMUNITY OUTSIDE LAS
VEGAS.

YOU WILL HEAR FROM HIS FAMILY,
RIGHT HERE THIS EVENING.

A BROTHER IN DISBELIEF.

ALSO TONIGHT, HOSPITALS
OVERWHELMED WITH THE INJURED.

AT ONE HOSPITAL, MORE THAN A
DOZEN DYING AFTER ARRIVING IN
THE E.R.

OTHERS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LINING UP FOR
BLOCKS TO DONATE BLOOD TONIGHT.

AND THE FACES OF THE VICTIMS
BEGINNING TO EMERGE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FIRST
LADY WITH A MOMENT OF SILENCE
OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.

AFTER CALLING IT AN ACT OF EVIL.

AND WE ARE HERE AT THE SCENE OF
THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.

HOTEL WINDOW SHOOTING AT
THOUSANDS OF HELPLESS
CONCERT-GOERS BELOW.

ON STAGE, COUNTRY MUSIC STAR
JASON ALDEAN.

THE MUSIC SUDDENLY MIXING WITH
THE SOUND OF BULLETS.

TERRIFIED PEOPLE ON THE GROUND,
DURING THE ROUNDS OF RELENTLESS
GUNFIRE, THEY WERE HUDDLING.

AND THEN, THE PAUSE.

THEY WOULD RUN FOR THEIR LIVES
BEFORE WITNESSES SAY THE GUNFIRE
WOULD THEN BEGIN AGAIN.

POLICE AND FIRST RESPONDERS
RUSHING IN.

IN MINUTES, S.W.A.T. TEAMS
REACHING THAT HOTEL ROOM IN THAT
BUILDING RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME.

AND TONIGHT, THE HORRIFIC TOLL
NOW EMERGING.

JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THEY
REVEALED AT LEAST 59 NOW KILLED.

MORE THAN 500 INJURED.

WHAT THEY'VE NOW DISCOVERED IN
THE SUSPECT'S HOME.

HIS FAMILY, YOU'LL HEAR FROM
THEM TONIGHT.

AND THE FACES OF THE VICTIMS.

BUT FIRST, WHAT BEGAN TO PLAY
OUT SHORTLY AFTER 1000 P.M.
LOCAL TIME, RIGHT HERE IN LAS
VEGAS.

IN THE HEART OF THE LAS VEGAS
STRIP.

1008 P.M., 22,000 COUNTRY MUSIC
FANS PACKED IN, ENJOYING THE
ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL.

FLOOR OF THE GLITTERING MANDALAY
BAY RESORT, POLICE SAY
64-YEAR-OLD STEPHEN PADDOCK WAS
WATCHING.

THEY SAY HE HAMMERED THROUGH THE
HOTEL'S THICK WINDOWS AND
STARTED FIRING ON THE CROWD
BELOW.

COUNTRY STAR JASON ALDEAN WAS ON
STAGE, BUT AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE
QUICKLY DROWNING OUT HIS VOICE.

â™ª
THE MUSIC STOPS, AND HE RUNS
OFFSTAGE.

THE AUDIENCE, HUDDLING ON THE
GROUND, THE MANDALAY LOOMING
OVER THEM.

FOR SO MANY, CONFUSION.

WAS THIS PART OF THE SHOW?

THAT'S JUST A FIRECRACKER.

I KNOW, BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO
THAT?

RAPID FIRE SHOOTING STARTS
AGAIN.

LET'S GO!

PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,
SHELTERING BEHIND ANYTHING THEY
COULD.

BUT THEY WERE IN AN OPEN FIELD,
EASY TARGETS FOR THE GUNMAN IN
THE TOWER.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO!

FOR SAFETY, ANYWHERE, EVEN A
STRANGER'S CAR.

TURN AROUND.

CAN WE GET IN?

CAN WE GET IN?

YEAH, GET IN.

TURN AROUND.

THERE'S A MASS SHOOTING!

THERE'S A MASS SHOOTING!

RELAX, RELAX.

MY HUSBAND AND I RAN OUT
TOWARD OUR CAR, AND THERE WERE
PEOPLE HIDING UNDERNEATH MY CAR
FOR COVER.

MORNING, WE FOUND MIKE CRONK,
HEAD IN HIS HANDS, STILL STAINED
WITH HIS FRIEND'S BLOOD.

GOT HIT THREE TIMES.

OUT.

YOU GUYS WERE TRYING TO DO
TRIAGE WHILE THE SHOOTING IS
STILL GOING ON?

YEAH, EVERYBODY WAS JUMPING
OVER THE FENCES AND STUFF, BUT
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO
LEAVE MY BUDDY.

WE HAD TO KEEP COMPRESSION ON
IT, SO -- ONCE WE -- WE WEREN'T
EVEN SURE IF THE SHOOTING WAS
STOPPED.

WE GOT HIM OVER THE FENCE, AND
UNDER THE STAGE SO AT LEAST WE
KNEW WE WERE SAFE.

POLICE DESCENDED HIGH ABOVE THE
PANICKED CROWDS, S.W.A.T.

TEAMS
ARE CLOSING IN ON THE SHOOTER.

THEY APPROACH HIS HOTEL DOOR
ARMED WITH AN EXPLOSIVE.

EVERYONE IN THE HALLWAY NEEDS
TO MOVE BACK.

ALL UNITS, MOVE BACK.

FOUND PADDOCK DEAD INSIDE.

HE HAD KILLED HIMSELF.

RIGHT NOW, WE NEED YOUR
TRUCK.

WE JUST NEED TO GET PEOPLE OVER
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

THE SIDEWALK NOW A TRIAGE
CENTER.

THE WOUNDED CARRIED ON
BARRICADES, TURNED INTO
STRETCHERS, EVEN IN
WHEELBARROWS.

WE JUST SAW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THAT NEEDED HELP, SO, WE JUST
STARTED PILING THEM UP IN THE
TRUCK.

STRIP, FROZEN, TOTAL LOCKDOWN.

THIS AMERICAN PLAYGROUND, NOW A
KILLING FIELD.

AND POLICE STILL POURING OVER
THIS CRIME SCENE.

AND THEY TOLD YOU, THIS IS GOING
TO BE A COMPLEX INVESTIGATION AT
EACH OF THESE SCENES.

BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE
SCENES COVERING SEVERAL CITY
BLOCKS, AND, OF COURSE, THERE
ARE THOSE HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS.

BUT PERHAPS, WHAT'S MOST
STRIKING ABOUT THIS SHOOTING IS
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WHERE THAT
STORY OF THE MANDALAY, AND THAT
CONCERT BELOW, YOU CAN SEE,
ABOUT 40 YARDS AWAY FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING.

THOSE BULLETS HAD TO TRAVEL WELL
OVER 300 YARDS TO HIT THEIR
VICTIMS AT THE CONCERT.

MATT, WHO HAS BEEN HERE SINCE
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, THANK
YOU.

AND NEXT HERE TONIGHT, A
CHILLING LOOK INSIDE THE ATTACK.

FROM THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND
POLICE ON THE SCENE, TONIGHT, WE
ARE NOW HEARING THE RADIO CALLS
THAT THEY MADE FOR HELP.

AND THEIR TENSE CONVERSATIONS
WHEN THEY WENT TO TAKE THE
GUNMAN DOWN IN THAT HOTEL
HALLWAY, AND THEY APPROACHED
THAT DOOR.

SHOTS FIRED FROM
MANDALAY BAY, THERE'S MANY
PEOPLE DOWN.

DOWN ON CONCERT-GOERS LIKE HELL
FIRE, LAS VEGAS S.W.A.T.

TEAMS
JUMPED INTO ACTION TO TAKE DOWN
THE SHOOTER.

790-RI, I'M GOING TO FORM A
STRIKE TEAM.

MANDALAY BAY AND THE BOULEVARD.

I NEED FIVE OFFICERS ON ME.

OFFICERS MOVING UP THE MASSIVE
GLASS TOWER.

CONTROL ZEBRA-20.

WE ARE AT THE END OF THE HALL.

WE ARE GOING TO BE PEEKING OUT
INTO THE HALLWAY.

THOSE OFFICERS THAT ARE DOWN THE
HALL NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE SO WE
FIRE, S.W.A.T. MEMBERS ADVANCE.

THEY STORM PADDOCK'S ROOM, THIS
WARNING, JUST IN CASE THEY'RE
WALKING INTO AN AMBUSH.

I'M AT THE SUSPECT'S DOOR.

I NEED EVERYBODY IN THAT HALLWAY
TO BE AWARE OF IT AND GET BACK.

WE NEED TO POP THIS AND SEE IF
WE GET ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM
THIS GUY, TO SEE IF HE'S IN HERE
OR IF HE'S ACTUALLY MOVED OUT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

BREACH, BREACH, BREACH.

WE ARE CLEARING THIS ROOM.

WE HAVE ONE SUSPECT DOWN.

IS THAT ROOM 135?

THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE.

ONE SUSPECT DOWN IN 135, I HAVE
THE FLOOR.

ALSO FIND HIS ARSENAL.

WE HAVE THE EAST ROOM SECURE.

WE'VE GOT ONE SUSPECT DOWN.

MULTIPLE FIREARMS.

THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PLACE
WHERE THEY WERE FIRING INTO THE
CROWD.

THIS MAYHEM TOOK PLACE OVER A
COUPLE OF HOURS.

AS THIS WAS HAPPENING, THE LAS
VEGAS S.W.A.T.

TEAM WAS PUTTING
TOGETHER THEIR PLAN.

THAT'S WHEN THEY FINALLY ENTERED
THE MANDALAY BAY RESORT ON THE
HOW DID THEY DO THIS?

THE SHERIFF OF THE LAS VEGAS
POLICE DEPARTMENT TELLS US
PEOPLE, HOTEL GUESTS LET THEM
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS WAS
HAPPENING AND THEY WERE ABLE TO
PINPOINT THE SUITE WHERE THE
SHOOTER WAS STAYING.

ONCE THEY BLEW UP THAT DOOR,
THEY SAW THE SHOOTER HAD KILLED
HIMSELF, BUT THEY SAW HIS
ARSENAL, SO THEY KNEW THEY HAD
THEIR MAN.

WHAT WOULD DRIVE SOMEONE TO
TAKE SO MANY INNOCENT LIVES?

THAT'S THE QUESTION WE ASK AFTER
SO MANY OF THESE MASS SHOOTINGS.

TONIGHT, A PORTRAIT OF THE
GUNMAN, NOW COMING INTO FOCUS.

HIS GAMBLING HABIT, HIS FAMILY
HISTORY, AND THIS QUESTION --
DID HE HAVE ANY TIES TO FOREIGN
GROUPS?

REMARKABLY TODAY, HIS FAMILY
SAID THERE WERE NO SIGNS THAT
ANY OF THIS WAS COMING.

HERE'S OUR CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS.

TONIGHT SEARCH FOR CLUES AT HIS
HOME IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY
IN MESQUITE, NEVADA, THE MOTIVE
OF 64-YEAR-OLD STEPHEN PADDOCK,
SEEN IN THIS PHOTO POSTED ON
FACEBOOK BY HIS GIRLFRIEND,
REMAINS A MYSTERY.

WE'VE CHECKED ALL THE FEDERAL
DATABASES AND LOCAL DATABASES
AND STATE DATABASES.

AND WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS
INDIVIDUAL.

REMEMBERS PADDOCK AS A MAN WHO
GREW UP WITHOUT CONVICTION.

STEVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
ANY POLITICAL ORGANIZATION,
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATION, NO WHITE
SUPREMACIST, NOTHING.

CONNECTION, EITHER, TO ANY
OVERSEAS TERROR GROUP, DESPITE A
CLAIM TODAY BY ISIS.

WE HAVE DETERMINED TO THIS
POINT NO CONNECTION WITH THE
REASON, THIS OTHERWISE
UNREMARKABLE MAN CHECKED INTO
ROOM LAST THURSDAY ON A
WELL-PLANNED MISSION TO KILL.

ASSEMBLING A REMARKABLE ARSENAL.

AUTHORITIES HOPE HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, WHO ONCE WORKED
AS A CASINO HOSTESS FOR HIGH-END
PLAYERS, CAN PROVIDE SOME
INSIGHT.

SHE IS OF FILIPINO DECENT AND
AUTHORITIES SAY SHE IS OVERSEAS
TONIGHT.

ADDING TO THE MYSTERY, FEDERAL
OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS PADDOCK
SENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS TO SOMEONE IN THE
PHILIPPINES IN THE LAST FEW
WEEKS.

PADDOCK'S ONLY REAL PASSION
APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GAMBLING.

HIS BROTHER, ERIC, SAYS PADDOCK
RECENTLY WON A $40,000 JACKPOT,
AND WAS A MULTIMILLIONAIRE.

HE WAS A WEALTHY GUY AND HE
LIKED TO PLAY VIDEO POKER.

HE PLAYED MULTI-HUNDRED DOLLAR A
HAND VIDEO POKER.

PADDOCK SUED A LAS VEGAS CASINO.

WHEN HE SLIPPED AND FELL ON A
CASINO FLOOR.

VIDEO SHOWS HIM LATER RUBBING
HIS LEG IN PAIN.

AN ARBITRATOR FOUND IN FAVOR OF
THE CASINO.

UNTIL TODAY, THE ONLY KNOWN
CONNECTION TO CRIME WAS
PADDOCK'S LATE FATHER, A VIOLENT
BANK ROBBER WHO SPENT SEVEN
FUGITIVE, DESCRIBED AS
PSYCHOPATHIC, SUICIDAL, ARMED
AND DANGEROUS.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD THERE, IN
YOUR REPORTING, THE SHOOTER'S
BROTHER SAY THAT HE HAD NO
POLITICAL TIES, RELIGIOUS TIES,
NO CRIMINAL HISTORY.

EVEN SAYING TODAY, NO PARKING
TICKETS.

BUT HE DID DESCRIBE HIS BROTHER
AS A MULTIMILLIONAIRE, WHO
PLAYED HIGH STAKES POKER, BUT
EVEN THERE, NO SIGNS YET TONIGHT
OF ANY FINANCIAL PROBLEMS?

NOT ONLY DID HE HAVE REAL ESTATE
HOLDINGS, BUT HE'S A PRIVATE
PILOT WHO OWNED HIS OWN PLANE.

HIS BROTHER SAID THAT HE MADE
HIS FORTUNE IN REAL ESTATE AND
BY GAMBLING AND THE STOCK
MARKET.

HE'S THE KIND OF HIGH ROLLER THE
CASINOS WELCOME OFTEN WITH OPEN
ARMS, DAVID.

AND NEXT HERE TONIGHT, TO
THE VICTIMS OF THIS AWFUL
ATTACK.

OFFICIALS HERE SAY THEY ARE
STILL IDENTIFYING THE DEAD, AND
NOTIFYING NEXT OF KIN.

IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME, BUT WE
ARE BEGINNING TO SEE MANY OF THE
FACES HERE THIS EVENING, THE
LOVED ONES LOST.

TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING THE
NAMES OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR
LIVES AT THE CONCERT HERE
OVERNIGHT.

THERE WAS DANA GARDNER.

FORMER HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADER
ANGIE GOMEZ.

28-YEAR-OLD AFGHANISTAN NAVY VET
CHRIS ROYBAL, FROM SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA.

HANNAH AHLERS, A 35-YEAR-OLD
MOTHER OF THREE FROM
MURRIETA, CALIFORNIA.

HE WOULD HAVE TURNED 24 THIS
WEEK.

SONNY MELTON, A TENNESSEE
HUSBAND AND NURSE.

ON THE RIGHT.

HE DIED WHILE PROTECTING HIS
WIFE, HEATHER, AS BULLETS RAINED
DOWN ON THEM.

"I FELT HIM GET SHOT IN THE
BACK," SHE TOLD REPORTERS.

AMONG THE VICTIMS, TEACHERS,
EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS.

LISA ROMERO, A SECRETARY AT
MIYAMURA HIGH SCHOOL IN
GALLUP, NEW MEXICO.

SUSAN SMITH, AN OFFICE MANAGER
AT VISTA ELEMENTARY IN
SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA.

MANHATTAN BEACH SPECIAL
EDUCATION TEACHER SANDY CASEY,
HER STUDENTS IN MOURNING TODAY.

IT WAS PAINFUL.

THERE WAS A LOT OF PAIN ON THE
CAMPUS TODAY.

IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DAY IN OUR
DISTRICT.

MANHATTAN BEACH POLICE RECORDS
TECHNICIAN, LOST HER LIFE.

TWO LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN
POLICE OFFICERS WERE ALSO HIT,
THE SHERIFF, EMOTIONAL.

ONE WAS CRITICAL, BUT HE IS
STABLE, AND ONE OF MY OFFICERS
WAS OFF-DUTY, ATTENDING THE
CONCERT AND LOST HIS LIFE.

HORROR, TONIGHT WE ARE ALSO
LEARNING OF ASTONISHING ACTS OF
HEROIC BRAVERY, HUDDLING
TOGETHER, CARRYING THE INJURED
THROUGH THE CHAOS AND TO SAFETY,
USING THEIR OWN BODIES AS
PROTECTION.

THERE WERE MEN GOING OVER
THEIR WIVES, THEIR GIRLFRIENDS
TO BLOCK THEM.

THERE WERE LIVES SAVED.

PACKING HER CAR WITH STRANGERS
BEFORE GETTING OUT AND CALLING
HER OWN FAMILY.

I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND I
TOLD HIM THAT I LOVED HIM AND MY
LITTLE GIRL, IN CASE I DIDN'T
TRAPPED IN A ROOM WITH OTHERS
NEAR THE STAGE.

POLICE OFFICERS SCREAMED GO,
GO, AND I RALLIED EVERYBODY OUT
OF THAT ROOM.

I WAS DETERMINED.

I SAID TO MYSELF, THESE GIRLS
AREN'T GOING TO DIE.

I'M NOT GOING TO DIE.

I NEED TO GET HOME TO SEE MY
DAUGHTER.

THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

NOT HAPPENING.

INCREDIBLE BRAVERY, EVEN IN
THE FACE OF THAT GUNFIRE THAT
SIMPLY WOULD NOT LET UP
OVERNIGHT.

THE HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL
TEAMS IN THIS CITY ARE STRETCHED
TO THE LIMITS TONIGHT.

THE MGM RESORTS, OWNER OF THE
MANDALAY AND OTHER HOTELS,
OFFERING HELP TO GUESTS AND
EMPLOYEES.

BUT THEY ALSO TWEETED THIS
TODAY, SAYING WE ARE IN NEED OF
CERTIFIED TRAUMA COUNSELORS.

IF YOU CAN VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME,
PLEASE GO TO CIRCUS CIRCUS.

AND AFTER AN URGENT CALL FOR
BLOOD DONORS, HUNDREDS SHOWING
UP TO HELP.

BUT EVEN AT ONE HOSPITAL HERE IN
LAS VEGAS TONIGHT, THEY REPORTED
THAT AT LEAST 14 OF THE VICTIMS
WERE BROUGHT THERE FOR HELP,
DIED AFTER ARRIVING AT THE E.R.

IT IS AN INCREDIBLE SCENE
UNFOLDING HERE TONIGHT, AND
ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS IS OUTSIDE
UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN LAS
VEGAS.

TO TREAT THE INJURED.

SHOTS FIRED FROM MANDALAY
BAY, THERE'S MANY PEOPLE DOWN.

OVERNIGHT, PUSHING THE WOUNDED
ANY WAY THEY COULD TO GET THEM
HELP.

SO MANY RUSHED TO AREA
HOSPITALS.

IT WAS NON-STOP SURGERY AFTER
SURGERY UNTIL ABOUT 430, 5:00
THIS MORNING.

DOCTORS OVERWHELMED WITH
HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS.

WE BROUGHT IN EXTRA TRAUMA
SURGEONS, EXTRA CRITICAL CARE
NURSES, EXTRA, EVEN, YOU KNOW,
EVS FOLKS TO MAKE SURE WE WERE
KEEPING OUR TRAUMA CENTER CLEAN
TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OUR PATIENTS
THROUGH QUICKLY.

TODAY MADE AN URGENT PLEA.

WE NEED BLOOD, SO, IF ANYBODY
CAN CONTRIBUTE BLOOD.

ARE RESPONDING TO HIS CALL.

I HEARD THIS HAPPENED, THE
LEAST I COULD DO, GIVE ME BLOOD
AND I'M O-NEGATIVE, SO, MY BLOOD
IS ACTUALLY THE UNIVERSAL GIVER.

WAITING UP TO FIVE HOURS TO
DONATE.

YOU CAN SEE -- I DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE HOW FAR THIS
LINE GOES.

IT IS INCREDIBLE.

AND SOME OF THE DOCTORS WE
LEARNED HAD JUST RECEIVED SOME
TRAINING THAT PROVED CRITICAL IN
THEIR RESPONSE HERE?

HAD JUST UNDERGONE TRAINING WITH
A PHYSICIAN WHO WAS ON-CALL IN
ORLANDO THE NIGHT OF THE PULSE
NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING AND HE WAS
ABLE TO SHARE WITH THEM WHAT
WORKED AND WHAT THEY COULD HAVE
DONE BETTER.

ON THE INCREDIBLE WORK DOCTORS
AND NURSES ARE DOING IN THIS
CITY.

THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE
AHEAD ON THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF
"WORLD NEWS TONIGHT" THIS
MONDAY.

THE KILLER'S ARSENAL.

WHAT WE HAVE JUST LEARNED

ASSORTMENT OF HIGH POWERED
WEAPONS, CAPABLE OF SLICING

POLICE.

WHAT ELSE POLICE REPORTEDLY
FOUND ONCE THEY WERE INSIDE.

AND ALSO, THE DISCOVERY AT HIS
HOME HERE IN NEVADA.

LEARNING ABOUT THAT LATE TODAY.

AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE
FIRST LADY WITH A MOMENT OF
SILENCE OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE.

AFTER THE PRESIDENT CALLED THIS
AN ACT OF PURE EVIL.

WE'RE GOING TO TURN NEXT
TONIGHT TO THAT DISCOVERY ON THE

WEAPONS AND WHAT WE'VE JUST
LEARNED ABOUT THAT HEAVY
ARTILLERY.

INVESTIGATORS FOCUSING ON THE
KILLER'S ARSENAL.

FUNCTIONING LIKE AN AUTOMATIC
MACHINE GUN.

THE GUNMAN FIRING BULLETS
CONTINUOUSLY.

LISTEN.

THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING WE'VE HEARD FROM
ALL OTHER RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS.

NONE OF THEM INVOLVING FULLY
AUTOMATIC GUNS.

WE ARE STILL GOING THROUGH
THE SEARCH WARRANT ACTIVELY AT
THIS TIME, BUT IT'S IN ACCESS OF
TEN RIFLES.

NEWS PADDOCK HAD AT LEAST 16
RIFLES AND HANDGUNS.

ONE OF THEM AN ASSAULT RIFLE,
MODIFIED TO FIRE LIKE A MACHINE
GUN.

SOURCES SAY SOME OF THE RIFLES
WERE HIGH POWERED, CAPABLE OF
SLICING THROUGH POLICE BODY
ARMOR.

THIS IS A CLASSIC WMD, THIS
IS A WEAPON AND A MAN OF MASS
FIRST 90 SECONDS OF THE
MASSACRE, HEARING NEARLY 200
ROUNDS FIRED.

HUNDREDS MORE WITHIN THE
FOLLOWING MINUTES.

PADDOCK TOOK BRIEF PAUSES,
LIKELY TO SWITCH WEAPONS OR
RELOAD.

THE KILLER PERCHED MORE THAN 300
FEET ABOVE.

THE PACKED CROWD, 1,100 FEET
AWAY, PROVIDING A SHOOTING
GALLERY FOR THE KILLER, WITH A
CROWD OF EASY TARGETS REQUIRING
LITTLE SKILL.

DISTURBINGLY, A LAW ENFORCEMENT
SOURCE TELLS ABC NEWS, A CAMERA
WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ROOM,
SUGGESTING THE GUNMAN MAY HAVE
RECORDED HIMSELF.

LATE TODAY, THIS GUN STORE IN
MESQUITE, NEVADA, CONFIRMING
THAT PADDOCK PURCHASED GUNS
HERE.

THE STORE SAYING HE PASSED ALL
NECESSARY BACKGROUND CHECKS.

IT'S UNKNOWN IF THESE WERE THE
GUNS USED IN THE RAMMAGE.

DAVID, AS THE SEARCH CONTINUES,
AUTHORITIES FOUND AN ADDITIONAL

NATION TODAY, CALLING THE
MASSACRE HERE IN LAS VEGAS AN
ACT OF PURE EVIL.

THE NATION TODAY, PRESIDENT

IT WAS AN ACT OF PURE EVIL.

GUNMAN'S NAME, INSTEAD FOCUSING
ON THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS.

WE ARE PRAYING FOR YOU, AND
WE ARE HERE FOR YOU, AND WE ASK
GOD TO HELP SEE YOU THROUGH THIS
UNITY.

IT IS OUR LOVE THAT DEFINES
US TODAY, AND ALWAYS WILL,
FOREVER.

LEADING A MOMENT OF SILENCE,
ORDERING FLAGS FLOWN AT HALF
STAFF AND PERSONALLY CALLING THE
LAS VEGAS SHERIFF.

THE FAST RESPONSE THAT YOU
GAVE SAVED HUNDREDS OF
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE FROM BEING
TERRORISM?

THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T SAY.

DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT
WHAT HAPPENED AMOUNTS TO AN ACT
OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM?

WE ARE STILL IN A
FACT-FINDING MISSION.

IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO WEIGH
IN ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE
WE HAVE ANY MORE FACTS.

AND THE PRESIDENT HEADS TO
LAS VEGAS ON WEDNESDAY, WHERE HE
WILL THANK FIRST RESPONDERS.

HE WILL MEET WITH VICTIM'S
FAMILY MEMBERS

AND WHAT THE SHERIFF HERE
