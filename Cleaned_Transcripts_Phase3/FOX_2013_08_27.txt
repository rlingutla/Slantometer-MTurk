THE PRESIDENT RETAINS
ALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO
HIM.

THE PENTAGON SAYS IT'S
READY TO GO.

WHENEVER PRESIDENT OBAMA
GIVES THE ORDER.

BUT SYRIA WARNS IT WILL
STRIKE BACK WITH EVERYTHING
IT'S GOT.

A U.S. MILITARY IS READY TO
GO IF PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVES
THE ORDER FOR A STRIKE
AGAINST SYRIA.

THE WHITE HOUSE PLANS TO
SHOW SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS
BEHIND THE ATTACK.

KILLED INNOCENT CHILDREN.

JOE BIDEN SAID THERE IS NO
DOUBT WHO IS TO BLAME.

THE SYRIAN REGIME THE
ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THE
WEAPONS.

HAVE USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS
MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE PAST.

HAVE THE MEANS OF
DELIVERING THOSE WEAPONS.

HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO
WIPE OUT EXACTLY THE PLACES
THAT WERE ATTACKED
BIOCHEMICAL WEAPONS.

SAYING THERE MUST BE A
RESPONSE TO LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IS STILL
DECIDING WHAT THAT RESPONSE
WILL BE.

WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE,
JONATHAN HUNT LIVE HERE IN
NEW YORK WITH WITH A LOOK
AT THE OTHER COUNTRIES
CALLING FOR ACTION.

BUT FIRST TO JENNIFER
GRIFFIN LIVE AT THE
PENTAGON WITH US THIS
EVENING.

WHAT WOULD A U.S. MILITARY
STRIKE LOOK LIKES A IT
STANDS NOW?

BILL, A SENIOR U.S.
OFFICIAL TELLS FOX THAT ANY
STRIKE ON SYRIA IS LIKELY
TO LAST HOURS, NOT DAYS.

ACCORDING TO U.S. MILITARY
SOURCES, THERE ARE NO PLANS
IN THIS INITIAL MISSION SET
TO GO AFTER ASSAD'S
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CARRY
OUT A SURGICAL STRIKE ON
CHEMICAL WEAPONS STORAGE
FACILITIES, ASSAD IS
ESTIMATED TO HAVE
1,000 TONS OF THOSE
MATERIALS.

SUCH A STRIKE COULD UNLEASH
THOSE CHEMICALS AND LEAD TO
A LOT OF DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION, SOURCES SAY.

ANY PLANS TO SECURE ASSAD'S
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD
REQUIRE SPECIAL OPERATIONS
AND BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

THAT IS NOT ON THE TABLE
RIGHT NOW.

THE U.S. IS PLANNING A
LIMITED STRIKE.

FOUR NAVY DESTROYERS IN
POSITION AND AT LEAST ONE
NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINE.

THE BRITISH COULD PROVIDE
ANOTHER SUBMARINE IF
PARLIAMENT VOTE SLATED LATE
FOR THURSDAY BILL.

NOT BEFORE NATO MEETS
BRUSSELS TOMORROW AND WE'RE
TOLD IT WOULD OCCUR MOST
LIKELY THIS WEEKEND.

CHUCK HAGEL SPOKE TO HIS
BRITISH AND FRENCH COUNTER
PARTS BY PHONE TODAY.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE
BBC, HAGEL SAID U.S.
WARSHIPS ARE STANDING BY
AWAITING ORDERS.

LET'S GET THE FACTS.

LET'S GET THE INTELLIGENCE.

AND THEN A DECISION WILL BE
MADE ON WHETHER ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN, IF ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN, WHAT
ACTION.

OR NO ACTION.

BUT IF YOU COME YOU ARE
READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

WE ARE READY TO GO LIKE
THAT.

AGAIN THE PLAN AT THIS
POINT IS TO DETER ASSAD AND
DEGRADE HIS ABILITIES.

MULTIPLE PENTAGON SOURCES
SUGGEST THE STRIKE WILL BE
LIMITED.

SECRETARY HAGEL SAYS IF THE
U.S. MILITARY DOES TAKE
ACTION, WE WILL NOT BE
GOING IT ALONE.

IT LOOKS LIKE WE SEE A
COALITION FORMING.

FORMING AND IN PLACE.

IMPORTANT PART OF THAT
COALITION EVEN IF
UNOFFICIALLY MAY WELL BE
THE ARAB LEAGUE.

THE ARAB LEAGUE MET TODAY
AND ISSUED A STATEMENT
BACKING U.S.

CONCLUSIONS
OVER THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN SYRIA LAST WEEK
ON THE WESTERN FRONT BOTH
THE FRENCH AND BRITISH
PRIME MINISTERS TALKING
VERY MUCH ABOUT THE NEED
FOR MILITARY ACTION.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMMERON SAYS IT IS
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

BUT THERE MUST BE A CLEAR
GOAL.

IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
SPECIFICALLY TO DETER AND
DEGRADE THE FUTURE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

LET ME STRESS TO PEOPLE.

THIS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING
INVOLVED IN A MIDDLE
EASTERN WAR OR CHANGING OUR
STAFFS IN SYRIA OR GOING
FURTHER INTO THAT CONFLICT.

IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH
THAT IT'S ABOUT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THEIR USE IS
WRONG.

AND THE WORLD SHUNNED
DISTANT IDOLLY BY.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO
PRIME MINISTER DAVID
CAMMERON TODAY.

ALSO WORTH NOTING BILL
THAT THE BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER HAS RECALLED
PARLIAMENT FROM ITS SUMMER
RECESS.

THAT MEETING DUE TO TAKE
PLACE THURSDAY.

IF YOU ARE READING THE TEA
LEAVES ON TIMING, THAT
COULD ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT,
BILL.

BUT SYRIA REMAINS
DEFIANT.

YEAH, THE FOREIGN
MINISTER SPEAKING OUT TODAY
SAYING THAT ABSOLUTELY
WITHOUT QUESTION SYRIA WILL
DEFEND ITSELF IF ATTACKED.

IF ANY AGGRESSION WERE
TO TAKE PLACE, WE HAVE TWO
OPTIONS.

TO SURRENDER OR TO DEFEND
OURSELVES USING THE OPTIONS
AVAILABLE.

USING ALL MEANS AVAILABLE.

IN THE MEANTIME, U.N.
WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE
STILL ON THE GROUND IN
DAMASCUS, TRYING TO
INVESTIGATE THAT ALLEGED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

DESPITE DIFFICULTIES THAT
THEY HAVE FACED, INCLUDING
A SNIPER ATTACK ON THEIR
CONVOY.

YOU CAN SEE THE BULLET
HOLES IN ONE OF THEIR
VEHICLES THERE.

MEANTIME, THE SPOKESMAN FOR
THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL
SAYS DIPLOMACY IS STILL BY
FAR THE PREFERRED MEANS OF
ENDING THIS CRISIS.

OUR FOCUS IS AWAY FROM
ANY MILITARY SOLUTION AND
TOWARDS A DIPLOMATIC
SOLUTION AND WE CONTINUE TO
WORK ON AT ALL AVENUES TO
TRY TO GET A DIPLOMATIC
SOLUTION GOING.

WE REMAIN COMBINED THAT
THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN FAR
TOO MUCH BLOOD SHED IN
SYRIA.

BUT, WITH THE RUSSIANS
BOUND TO BLOCK ANY UNITED
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL
RESOLUTION, IT APPEARS
BILL, THAT THE U.S. HAS
ALREADY MADE THE DECISION
TO GO AHEAD WITH ANY
MILITARY OPTION UNDER THE
AUSPICES OF NATO, RATHER
THAN THE U.N., BILL.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S
CONSULTING WITH CONGRESS
ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO
DAMASCUS.

BUT, SOME LAWMAKERS FROM
BOTH PARTIES CLAIM THAT IS
NOT ENOUGH.

THEY SAY CONGRESS HAS TO
APPROVE ANY MILITARY
ACTION.

WE'LL GO LIVE TO THE WHITE
HOUSE IN A MOMENT HERE
INSIDE OUR FOX REPORT
TONIGHT.

THE WHITE HOUSE CLAIMS THE
U.S. WILL RESPOND TO THAT
DEADLY CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK IN SYRIA.

BUT, SOME REPUBLICAN
LEADERS ARE WEIGHING IN ON
WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE THAT
SHOULD BE.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S
PREPOSTEROUS TO SUGGEST
THAT SYRIA WAS NOT BEHIND
LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK.

THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED
HUNDREDS THERE.

NOW THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS
THERE IS NO DOUBT THE U.S.
WILL RESPOND.

THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN
AND HOW THE U.S. HAS
FOUR WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST
OF MILITARY.

THE MILITARY IS READY TO
STRIKE WHENEVER PRESIDENT
OBAMA GIVES THAT ORDER.

BUT DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK
HAGEL STRESSING THE U.S.
WILL COORDINATE ANY ACTION
WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL
PARTNERS.

WOULD THE THE
ADMINISTRATION GET
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY OR
IS THIS A DECISION THE
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE ON HIS
OWN.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
IS GOING TO OPERATE
UNILATERALLY WITHOUT
CONGRESS.

INTERESTING BECAUSE VICE
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TODAY
ADDED HIS NAME TO THE
COURSE OF TOP OFFICIALS
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
SAYING THAT ASSAD AND SYRIA
NEEDS TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.

THAT HE DID, IN FACT, USE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

BUT SOME DEMOCRATS ON
CAPITOL HILL LIKE
CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE,
THE ONLY MEMBER OF CONGRESS
TO VOTE AGAINST THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN DEMANDING A
DEBATE AND VOTE IN
CONGRESS.

OFFICIALS HERE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TELLING ME THAT IS
UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN BEFORE
THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS
DECISION ON WHETHER TO MOVE
FORWARD ON U.S. MILITARY
ACTION.

EVEN THOUGH IN THE 2008
CAMPAIGN, HE SLAMMED THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR
ACTING UNILATERALLY, TAKE A
LISTEN TO HOW I PRESSED JAY
CARNEY ABOUT THIS AND
LISTEN TO THE VICE
PRESIDENT AS WELL.

2007, CANDIDATE OBAMA
WAS AN ACTUAL OR IMMINENT
THREAT TO THE NATION.

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EXISTS
RIGHT NOW AN ACTUAL OR
IMMINENT THREAT TO THE
UNITED STATES?

I BELIEVE THAT
ABSOLUTELY ALLOWING THE USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A
SIGNIFICANT STALE TO TAKE
PLACE WITHOUT A RESPONSE
WOULD PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT
THREAT TO UNITED STATES
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST.

NATIONAL SECURITY IS
STRENGTHENED WHEN WE HOLD
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO
VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL
NORMS.

NOW THE WOWS JUST
REVEALED IN THE LAST FEW
MOMENTS AND THE PRESIDENT
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH
THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMMERON.

WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT
THAT SECOND TIMED THEY HAVE
SPOKEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW
DAYS.

CONSULTING WITH ALLIES LIKE
THAT SUGGEST WE ARE EDGING
CLOSER TO U.S. MILITARY
ACTION.

LEAST SOME OF THEM ANY WAY
SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD NOT
BE SOME SORT OF SYMBOLIC
HIT OR ATTACK, ED?

REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN
MCCAIN SAYING TONIGHT LOOK,
IF THERE IS GOING TO BE
MILITARY ACTION, FINE.

BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO
EXPLAIN THE MISSION TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MCCAIN
SAYING TONIGHT HE CAN'T
JUST BE SOME SYMBOLIC MOVE
TO BACK UP THE PRESIDENT'S
RHETORIC FROM LAST SUMMER
ABOUT A RED LINE ON
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

MCCAIN SAYING IT'S GOT TO
BE A SERIOUS MILITARY
ACTION THAT ACTUALLY
DEGRADES ASSAD'S FORCES.

IF IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE
LAUNCH SOME CREWS MISSILES
AND DO THAT FOR THREE DAYS
AND NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT
EFFECT ON THE MOMENTUM ON
THE BATTLEFIELD IT WILL
HAVE AN UNHELPFUL EFFECT.

IF WE DO IT RIGHT.

AND WE GET THE MOMENTUM
BACK ON SHIFTED TO OUR
FREEDOM FIGHTERS --
 NOW, THE NEXT STEP IN
THE CASE FOR MILITARY
ACTION WE'RE EXPECTING THE
WHITE HOUSE AS EARLY AS
TOMORROW TO DECLASSIFY SOME
INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY SAY
WILL SHOW THAT ASSAD DID
USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
