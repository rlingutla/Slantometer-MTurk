THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCING A
GLOBAL CYBER ATTACK AFFECTED
MORE PEOPLE THAN WE KNEW.

COMING UP, THE INCREDIBLE SCOPE
OF THIS ATTACK AND HOW YOU CAN
PROTECT YOURSELF.

A POWERFUL CYBER ATTACK THAT
YOU HEARD ABOUT OVER THE WEEKEND
THAT SO FAR HIT MORE THAN
300,000 COMPUTERS AROUND THE
WORLD.

STILL HAPPENING.

HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER TOM
BOSSERT.

THE ATTACK CALLED PROBLEMS FOR
MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES
INCLUDING THE U.S.

IT FREEZES YOUR COMPUTER AND
RATHER THAN STEALING YOUR FILES,
IT HOLDS THEM HOSTAGE AND
REQUIRES YOU TO PAY A RANSOM TO
GET YOUR OWN ACCESS TO YOUR OWN
FEELS.

INVESTIGATORS ARE STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS BEHIND
THIS.

COLD TO MALWARE TECH, A GROUP
THAT MONITORS THIS SORT OF
THING, THE DOTS ON THIS MAP SHOW
WHERE THE SO-CALLED WANNA CRY
VIRUS -- THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL
IT -- WHERE IT'S HIT IN THE LAST
24 HOURS.

IT STARTED THIS TIME FRIDAY AND
HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH THE
WEEKEND.

A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT HIT TODAY
AFTER THE WEEKEND.

THERE IT IS.

BOSSERT DOES CONFIRM IT'S HIT
AMERICAN ISSUES.

FED EX REPORTED ISSUES FRIDAY.

AFFECTED BRITAIN'S NATIONAL
HEALTH SERVICES AND RUSSIAN'S
FOREIGN MINISTRY.

NOW THE SUN NEWSPAPER, WHICH IS
A CORPORATE COUSIN OF OURS,
REPORTS THAT THE RUSSIAN
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS
BLAMING THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT.

THE HACKERS USED VULNERABILITY
FROM LEAKED NSA DOCUMENTS.

HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE SAW
IF IT HIT.

A SCREAM DEMANDING PAYMENT IN
BITCOIN.

IT'S A DIGITAL CURRENCY NOT
REGULATED BY ANY ONE COMPANY.

PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS AND YOU
GET YOUR FILE BACK.

TRACE GALLAGHER WITH MORE.

TRACE?

THE WAY THIS WORKS, THE
RANSOMWARE THAT IS MALICIOUS
SOFTWARE IS PRETTY EFFECTIVE
EXPLOITING MICROSOFT SYSTEMS.

ONCE CLICKED ON, LOCKS YOU OUT
AND DEMANDING MONEY.

SURE ENOUGH WHEN WORKERS LOGGED
ON THIS MORNING, THE VIRUS
STARTED SPREADING, ESPECIALLY IN
CHINA WHERE 40,000 ORGANIZATIONS
GOT HIT AND 11 INTERNET SECURITY
COMPANIES HAD TO STOP TRADING
BECAUSE THE STOCK JUMPED 10%,
WHICH IS THE ONE-DAY MAXIMUM IN
CHINA.

EUROPE WAS ON HIGH ALERT FOR A
SECOND WAVE BASED ON COPYCAT
MALWARE.

THE WHITE HOUSE HOMELAND
SECURITY ADVISER SAID PAYING THE
RANSOM IS A WASTE OF MONEY.

LISTEN TO HIM.

WE'RE NOT AWARE OF PAYMENTS
THAT HAVE LED TO ANY DATA
RECOVERY.

YEAH, YOUR DATA IS STILL
LOCKED UP.

THE GOAL WAS TO NOT ATTACK ANY
CERTAIN COMPANY BUT TO MAKE AS
MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE.

TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

THE EUROPEAN CYBER CRIMES
CENTER SAYS THESE TYPES ATTACKS
HAVE A FEW THINGS IN COMMON.

THEY ATTEND TO GO AFTER OLDER
SOFTWARE THAT HACKERS HAVE
LEARNED TO EXPLOIT.

SO UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE AND ONLY
INSTALL ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

IF YOU BROWSE SOFTWARE, MAKE
SURE IT'S FROM A TRUSTED SOURCE.

YOU SHOULD NOT CLICK ON BANNERS
AND LINKS AND DON'T INSTALL
MOBILE ANS FROM UNKNOWN USERS.

THIS IS ALL COMMON SENSE STUFF,
SHEP.

WE ALL TEND TO CLICK ON THAT
COMPELLING BANNER FROM TIME TO
TIME AND IT ENDS US GETTING IN
TROUBLE.
