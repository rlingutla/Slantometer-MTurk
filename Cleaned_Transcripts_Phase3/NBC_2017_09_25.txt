HERE IN PUERTO RICO
APOCALYPTIC SCENES.

OUR FIRST LOOK AT
GROUND ZERO WHERE
HURRICANE MARIA MADE
LANDFALL, AND WE'RE
WITH THE MILITARY AMID
A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN
CRISIS LIKE FEW WE'VE
EVER SEEN BEFORE.

WE MADE OUR WAY TO
PUERTO RICO TODAY.

A DAY-LONG JOURNEY
ABOARD A MILITARY
TRANSPORT.

AIR NATIONAL GUARD HAS
AN AIR BRIDGE GOING
NOW.

A MASSIVE RELIEF
OPERATION.

THERE IS DEVASTATION
EVERYWHERE.

IT IS LIKE A CURTAIN
IS SLOWLY BEING LIFTED
ON THIS DISASTER
REVEALING MORE AND
MORE OF THE SUFFERING
AND THE DIRE STRAITS
ON THIS ISLAND.

POWER IS STILL LARGELY
OUT.

THAT MEANS BANKS AND
HOSPITALS AND THE
THINGS THAT PEOPLE
DEPEND ON, THEY CAN'T
GET TO UNLESS THERE
ARE GENERATORS
WORKING.

AND IN THOSE CASES
THERE ARE LONG LINES.

GAS STATIONS.

GETTING WATER IS
EXTRAORDINARILY
DIFFICULT.

WE'RE GETTING OUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE
GROUND ZERO WHERE
HURRICANE MARIA MADE
ITS LANDFALL ALMOST A
WEEK AGO.

THE MASSIVE CLEANUP
EFFORT IS UNDER WAY.

THIS IS THE AREA WHERE
THE EYE OF THE STORM
HIT.

ROOFS BLOWN OFF, LIVES
TORN APART.

THERE IS STILL A
DESPERATE NEED TO
COMMUNICATE.

NO POWER AND NO END IN
SIGHT.

WHEN MARIA ROARED ON
SHORE, PUERTO RICO'S
SOUTHEAST CORNER
ENDURED THE FIRST
IMPACT.

THIS IS THE TOWN,
YES.

COASTAL TOWN OF
MAUNABO, NORMA ROSADO
LOST THE ROOF OFF HER
HOME AND HER SMALL
BUSINESS BLEW AWAY
ENTIRELY.

MANY OF US, WE
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY.

THAT WILL TAKE US A
LONG TIME TO RECOVER
FROM THE THINGS THAT
HUNT IS ON HERE FOR
THE BASICS.

THIS WOMAN SNAGGING
WATER FROM THE SIDE OF
A MOUNTAIN.

EVERYTHING IS
DESTROYED, SHE SAYS.

WITH MANGLED POWER
LINES EVERYWHERE AND
EYE-POPPING LINES AT
GAS STATIONS, PEOPLE
HERE FEEL PARALYZED
AND DISCONNECTED.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW
THE ISLAND BEFORE
MARIA HIT AND AFTER,
NOW ALMOST TOTALLY IN
THE DARK.

NO CELL SERVICE
EITHER.

AND THIS WOMAN HASN'T
BEEN ABLE TO REACH HER
FAMILY IN
INDIANAPOLIS.

WHEN OFFERED A
SATELLITE PHONE, SHE
TELLS THEM SHE'S ALL
RIGHT, BUT HER
95-YEAR-OLD
GRANDFATHER PASSED
AWAY DURING THE STORM.

TODAY SAN JUAN'S
AIRPORT PACKED AS
TRAVELERS RUSHED TO
ESCAPE ON THE FEW
COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS.

THE U.S. MILITARY
DELIVERING
HUMANITARIAN AID,
LAUNCHING RELIEF
MISSIONS FROM THE "USS
KEARSARGE" BY AIR AND
SEA.

THE MARINES ARE
HERE, THE MARINES ARE
LANDING.

TO HELP CLEAR ROADS.

THIS WILL NOT
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

THIS IS GOING TO BE A
NORTHWEST PUERTO RICO
ENGINEERS ARE
INSPECTING A MAJOR DAM
AFTER FINDING A CRACK.

THANKFULLY SO FAR IT'S
HOLDING.

SAN JUAN PASTOR
ANTONIO FONT RUNS THIS
MASSIVE CHURCH THAT
HIS FATHER BUILT AND
MARIA RIPPED APART.

AND TO SEE IT JUST
DESTROYED IN JUST A
FEW HOURS IS REALLY
SAD, BUT WE ARE A
CHURCH OF HOPE.

SO WE ARE GOING TO
REBUILDING WILL TAKE
TIME FOR AN ISLAND IN
CRISIS AND IN NEED.

AS WE NOTED, WE
ARRIVED HERE TODAY
ABOARD AN AIR NATIONAL
GUARD C-130.

AN OPERATION IS BEING
STAGED, ESSENTIALLY A
HUB AND SPOKE
OPERATION, OUT OF
GEORGIA BRINGING
PLANES WITH NEEDED
RELIEF MATERIALS.

AND THEY'RE REALIZING
NOW THIS IS A MISSION
THAT'S GOING TO LAST A
LONG TIME.

THIS SMALL PIECE OF
AMERICA ALMOST A
THOUSAND MILES FROM
THE U.S. MAINLAND HAS
NEVER FELT MORE
REMOTE, BUT IT IS NOT
FORGOTTEN.

WITH THE SUN BARELY
UP, THIS CORNER OF THE
SAVANNAH INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT IN GEORGIA WAS
ALIVE WITH THE SOUNDS
OF VITAL PROVISIONS
BEING LOADED ABOARD
NATIONAL GUARD
TRANSPORTS.

A HUB OF AN AERIAL
LIFELINE PROVIDING
HUMANITARIAN AID THAT
TAKES ON ADDED MEANING
FOR THESE CREWS.

WE SPEND MOST OF
THE TIME TRYING TO DO
THIS OVERSEAS, OVER IN
A WAR ZONE.

TO BE ABLE TO DO IT
BACK HOME AND HELP OUT
OUR FELLOW AMERICAN
CITIZENS HERE AFTER
SOME OF THESE
HURRICANES, IT'S
CREW OF THIS PUERTO
RICO NATIONAL GUARD
C-130, THEIR MISSION
THIS WEEKEND WAS
PERSONAL.

IT'S BEEN A
SACRIFICE NOT TO BE
WITH MY FAMILY, BUT
MISSION COMES FIRST.

SO WE ARE READY TO
JUST GO BACK, SEE OUR
FAMILIES, THEN HEAD
BACK TO THE STATES OR
WHATEVER TO GET THE
SUPPLIES.

SEE THE RAMP IS LINED
WITH PLANES FROM
NATIONAL GUARD UNITS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
KENTUCKY AND TEXAS AND
MISSOURI.

THIS C-130 BELONGS TO
THE RHODE ISLAND
NATIONAL GUARD.

WE'LL BE TRAVELING ON
THIS ONE TO SAN JUAN
AFTER A BRIEF STOP IN
ST. CROIX.

THEY'RE LOADING WATER
AND MEALS
READY-TO-EAT.

ONCE AIRBORNE, THE
URGENCY OF THIS
HUMANITARIAN MISSION
IS APPARENT ON THEIR
FACES.

WHAT'S IT LIKE FLYING
INTO THE HURRICANE
ZONES IN TERMS OF WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING OUT THE
WINDOW WHEN YOU'RE
DESCENDING?

IT'S A LITTLE
DISTRACTING, TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

I HAVE A LOT TO DO UP
HERE IN THE RIGHT
SEAT, BUT WHEN I SEE
SOME OF THE
DEVASTATION DOWN THERE
ON THE GROUND, IT'S
PRETTY BAD.

I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

BEEN EASY, THE AIRPORT
HAS BEEN STRUGGLING TO
GET UP TO FULL
OPERATIONS.

A LOT OF THE
FACILITIES THAT WE USE
TO NAVIGATE AREN'T UP.

IT'S KINDS OF LIKE THE
WILD WEST A LITTLE
BIT.

BUT WE'RE TRAINED TO
DO IT, AND WE DO IT
PRETTY WELL, I THINK.

DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR
FROM THE AIRPORT TO
APPRECIATE JUST HOW
GREAT THE NEED IS.

THE MILITARY HAS PUT
THEIR OWN RADAR SYSTEM
IN PLACE TEMPORARILY
HERE.

THEY'RE TRYING TO GET
IT LINKED INTO THE FAA
SYSTEM.

THAT WILL ALLOW THEM
TO BRING MORE FLIGHTS
IN AS THE DAYS GO ON.

EVEN AS WE LOOK AT
WHAT HURRICANE MARIA
DID TO PUERTO RICO,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
TONIGHT, IT IS STILL A
HURRICANE, A CATEGORY
1.

WHILE IT'S NOT A
THREAT TO MAKE
LANDFALL IN THE U.S.,
TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WINDS ARE EXPECTED ON
THE OUTER BANKS OF
NORTH CAROLINA.

ALSO A 2 TO 4-FOOT
STORM SURGE AND
DANGEROUS SURF BEFORE
THIS STORM TURNS
FURTHER OUT TO SEA.

WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM
PUERTO RICO IN JUST A
MOMENT, BUT FIRST,
LET'S SEND IT UP TO
NEW YORK WITH SAVANNAH
GUTHRIE WHO HAS SOME
OF THE OTHER BIG
STORIES OF THE DAY.

FINALLY FROM
PUERTO RICO, THIS IS
AN ISLAND WITH A LONG
WAY TO GO ON ITS ROAD
TO RECOVERY.

LEAVING THE AIRPORT
THE SIGNS OF DESPAIR
WERE APPARENT
EVERYWHERE.

EVEN PEOPLE JUST
PARKING AROUND A LONE
WORKING CELL TOWER TO
TRY TO GET A MESSAGE
OUT.

OR PEOPLE JUST A SHORT
DISTANCE FROM US
GATHERED IN A LONG
LINE FOR A RESTAURANT
ABLE TO SERVE FOOD.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO
COVER THIS STORY AND
UPDATE YOU AS PUERTO
RICO RECOVERS, AS WE
SAID, HOME TO ALMOST
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS.

IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP,
WE'VE PUT A LIST OF
ORGANIZATIONS ON OUR
WEBSITE.
