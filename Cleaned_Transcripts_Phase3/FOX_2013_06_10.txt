TONIGHT, THE MAN ACCUSED OF
EXPOSING THE TOP SECRET
GOVERNMENT PHONE AND EMAIL
SPYING PROGRAM NOW ON THE
RUN FROM SOME OF THE MOST
POWERFUL GOVERNMENTS IN ALL
THE WORLD WHAT ELSE DID HE
KNOW?

WHAT ELSE WILL HE REVEAL?

I SITTING AT MY DESK HAD
THE AUTHORITY TO WIRETAP
ANYONE, EVEN THE PRESIDENT.

TELLS THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER THE FEDS OWE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AN
EXPLANATION.

SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE
ACTUALLY ABUSES.

HIDING OVERSEAS AND LOOKING
FOR ASYLUM.

BUT ONE CONGRESSMAN CALLS
HIM A DEFECTOR WHO SHOULD
PAY THE PRICE FOR PUTTING
AMERICANS IN DANGER.

AL QAEDA AND ITS
AFFILIATES NOW KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

IS THREATENING TO CHALLENGE
THE SPY PROGRAM AT THE
SUPREME COURT.

BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS
MONDAY NIGHT HE SAYS HE
HAD THE POWER TO WIRETAP
EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HE
WANTS AMERICANS TO KNOW HOW
MUCH POWER OUR SPY AGENCIES
HAVE TO KEEP TABS ON EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF US.

29-YEAR-OLD EDWARD SNOWDEN
SAYS THAT'S EXACTLY WHY HE
EXPOSED THE GOVERNMENT'S
PHONE AND EMAIL
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS.

HE SAYS HE WORKED AS A
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
OFFICE IN HAWAII AS AN
EMPLOYEE OF A GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTOR.

HE INSISTS HE HAS DONE
NOTHING WRONG AND TELLS THE
GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER OF GREAT
BRITAIN HE WANTED TO TAKE
DOWN WHAT HE CALLS THE
ARCHITECTURE OF OPPRESSION.

I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO
SITS THERE DAY TO DAY IN
THE OFFICE, WATCHES WHAT'S
HAPPENING AND GOES, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OUR
PLACE TO DECIDE.

THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO DECIDE
WHETHER THESE PEOPLE OR
POLICIES ARE RIGHT OR
WRONG.

SNOWDEN SAYS HE LEFT HIS
GIRLFRIEND BEHIND IN HAWAII
AND TOOK OFF FOR HONG KONG
THREE WEEKS AGO AFTER
COPYING THE DOCUMENTS HE
PLANNED TO RELEASE.

THEIR HOUSE IS NOW FOR SALE
IT TURNS OUT.

GIRLFRIEND SAID TO BE BACK
ON THE MAINLAND WEST COAST.

NEIGHBORS IN HAWAII SAY THE
COUPLE MADE SURE THAT
NOBODY COULD SEE INSIDE
THAT HOME EVERYTHING WAS
COMPLETELY BLOCKED.

LIKE A WALL OF BOXES ALL
THE WAY ACROSS.

IS HOPING TO GET POLITICAL
ASYLUM.

MAYBE IN ICELAND THE HOME
BASE OF WIKILEAKS.

ICE ATLANTIC LAWMAKER AND
FREE SPEECH ACTIVIST SAY
THEY ARE TRYING TO GET IN
TOUCH WITH SNOWDEN TO MAKE
SURE ICELAND IS THE BEST
PLACE TO GO.

HE TOLD THE GUARDIAN ALL MY
OPTIONS ARE BAD.

WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE
CATHERINE HERRIDGE IS WITH
US TONIGHT AND JONATHAN
HUNT.

DO WE KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW.

TO THE BEST OF OUR
KNOWLEDGE, SHEP HE IS STILL
IN HONG KONG.

THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS
THAT HE SPENT SOME TIME AT
THE W HOTEL IN HONG KONG.

THERE WAS ANOTHER REPORT IN
THE "THE WASHINGTON POST"
TODAY THAT A RECEPTION AT
THE MIRROR HOTEL ALSO SAID
THAT SOMEBODY BY THE NAME
OF EDWARD SNOWDEN HAD BEEN
THERE AND CHECKED OUT
EARLIER TODAY ALL OF WHICH
FITS IN WHAT SNOWDEN
HIMSELF SAID HE IS LIKELY
TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS
LIFE AS A FUGITIVE.

LISTEN.

I CAN BE RENDERED BY THE
CIA.

I CAN HAVE PEOPLE COME
AFTER ME OR ANY OF THEIR
THIRD PARTY PARTNERS.

THEY WORK CLOSE WHETHER I A
NUMBER OF OTHER NATIONS.

THEY COULD PAY OFF THE TRY
ADDS OR ANY OF THEIR AGENTS
OR ASSETS.

WE HAVE A CIA STATION UP
THE ROAD.

THE CONSULATE HERE IN HONG
KONG, I'M SURE THEY ARE
GOING TO BE VERY BUSY FOR
THE NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S A
FEAR I WILL LIVE UNDER FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE
HOWEVER LONG THAT HAPPENS
TO BE.

SNOWDEN SAID IN THAT
SAME INTERVIEW, SHEP, THAT
HE BELIEVES ABSOLUTELY THAT
HE DID NOTHING WRONG, SHEP?

BROUGHT BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES.

BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
VERY IFFY.

YEAH.

THERE IS AN EXTRADITION
TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND HONG KONG.

BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN
TESTED IN A CASE LIKE THIS.

AND THERE IS AN EXCEPTION.

IF THE AUTHORITIES IN HONG
KONG BELIEVE THAT AN
EXTRADITION REQUEST IS
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ALL
OF WHICH ACCORDING TO THE
THE SUM HONG KONG BASED
LEGAL EXPERTS MAY HELP ED
SNOWDEN, LISTEN.

COMING TO HONG KONG IS
PROBABLY A GOOD DECISION
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE
PROTECTIONS UNDER OUR
EXTRADITION LAW, THROUGH
THE COURT SYSTEM, AND THE
POLITICAL OFFENSE
EXCEPTION, BUT WE ALSO HAVE
STRONG PROTECTIONS FOR
PEOPLE MAKING ASYLUM
CLAIMS.

THEN, OF COURSE, SHEP
THERE IS CHINA.

IT DOES NOT COMPLETELY
CONTROL THE DECISION THAT
THE HONG KONG AUTHORITIES
MIGHT MAKE IN THIS CASE BUT
IT DOES HAVE INFLUENCE AND
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT MAY
HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR
WANTING TO KEEP EDWARD
SNOWDEN PRETTY CLOSE BY.


SNOWDEN ALSO TOLD THE
GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER CHINA IS
NOT AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED
STATES.

SHEP, THAT PART OF THE
INTERVIEW TRY TO DEBUNK THE
WELL DOCUMENTED STRAINS
BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND
BEIJING IS INTRIGUING.

CHINA IS AN ENEMY OF THE
UNITED STATES.

IT'S NOT THERE ARE
CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AND THE CHINESE PRC
GOVERNMENT BUT THE PEOPLES
INHERENTLY, WE DON'T CARE.

WE TRADE WITH EACH OTHER
FREELY.

YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOT AT
WAR.

A FORMER ATTORNEY
GENERAL SAYING THE LEAK
CASE COULD BE HANDLED BY A
JUNIOR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
LAWYER BECAUSE SNOWDEN IS
APPARENTLY IMPLICATING
HIMSELF.

THE KEY IS GETTING TO
SNOWDEN BEFORE HE LEAKS
AGAIN AND BEIJING
INTERROGATES HIM.

WHEN YOU ARE ON CHINESE
TERRITORY YOU DON'T BARGAIN
WITH THE CHINESE.

YOU EITHER GIVE THEM WHAT
THEY WANT OR CONCEIVABLY
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

THEY ARE NOT REAL
SENTIMENTAL ABOUT STUFF
LIKE THAT.

A FORMER SENIOR NSA
OFFICIAL SAYING THE
INVESTIGATION WILL LIKELY
TAKE THE BIG DATA NSA
PROGRAM SNOWDEN COMPLAINS
OF AND TURN THEM ON HIM.

EVERYTHING WILL BE
AVAILABLE.

EVERY PLACE HE TOUCHED THE
SYSTEM ELECTRONICALLY,
TERMINALS, ACCOUNTS.

EMAILS BOTH IN THE SYSTEM
AND OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

ANY AND ALL INFORMATION
RELATED TO ANY CONTACT HE
MAY HAVE HAD WITH REPORTERS
AND JOURNALISTS AND OTHERS
THEY WILL TURN HIS LIFE
INSIDE OUT AS THEY DID WITH
ME.

DRAKE SAYS THE CHOICE OF
HONG KONG MAKES A LOT OF
SENSE BECAUSE IT SHOWS
SNOWDEN WANTED TO BE AS FAR
OUT OF REACH OF THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AS POSSIBLE,
PROGRAMS, CATHERINE IT
SOUNDS LIKE LAWMAKERS ARE
ABOUT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
THEM.

THAT'S RIGHT.

FOX NEWS CONFIRMING THAT
TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE FULL
HOUSE WILL BE BRIEFED BY
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
JAMES KOHL, DEPUTY FBI
DIRECTOR SEAN JOYCE AND
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE NSA
CHRIS INGLIS ON THE
PROGRAMS.

WE HAVE OUR INTEL
COMMITTEE THAT GETS BRIEFED
BUT THE FULL CONGRESS DOES
NOT.

THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
REQUESTED TO BE BRIEFED
TOMORROW.

WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS
COMING DOWN FROM NSA,
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
FBI TO WALK THROUGH THE
ENTIRE CONGRESS MEMBERS
WHAT IS GOING ON.

AND LATE TODAY THE
POWERFUL CHAIR OF THE
SENATE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE DIANE DIANNE
FEINSTEIN CONFIRMING HER
COMMITTEE IS GETTING A
SIMILAR BRIEFING ALSO CLOSE
TO THE PUBLIC ON THURSDAY.

ASKED WHY THE BRIEFINGS ARE
NECESSARY GIVEN THE
PRESIDENT'S CLAIM ON FRIDAY
THAT EVERYONE IN CONGRESS
KNEW ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
DID NOT DIRECTLY ANSWER
THAT QUESTION SHEP.


WALL STREET ALSO REACTED TO
THIS CONTROVERSY.

CONTROLLED THE LEAKER
TANKED IN THE EARLY DAYS.

ALLEN HAMILTON STOCK
DROPPED.

IT DROPPED SOME A% AT THE
START OF TRADING AND ENDED
THE DAY DOWN.

COMPANY RELEASED A
STATEMENT SAYING SHOCKING
AND VIOLATION OF THE CORE VALUES.

SOME ARE CALLING SNOWDEN A
TRADER BUT ANDREW
NAPOLITANO HAD A VERY
DIFFERENT TAKE.

I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS
MAN AS AN AMERICAN HERO, AS
A PERSON REALLY TO RISK
LIFE, LIMB AND LIBERTY IN
ORDER TO EXPOSE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ONE OF THE
MOST EXTRAORDINARY
VIOLATIONS OF AMERICAN
PRINCIPLE VALUE JUDGMENTS
AND CONSTITUTION ITSELF IN
ALL OF OUR HISTORY.

LIBERTARIAN IS THREATENING
A LEGAL FIGHT AT THE
HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND.

AND EXECUTIVES OF SOME OF
AMERICA'S BIGGEST TECH
COMPANIES INSIST THEY ARE
NOT GIVING THE FEDS DIRECT
ACCESS.

TO SNOOP ON EVERYTHING WE
ARE DOING ONLINE.

ANALYSTS SAY THAT MAY NOT
BE THE WHOLE STORY.

IT'S THE TOP STORY AT THE
LIVE FROM D.C.
DOUG?

SHEP GOOGLE'S CEO ERIC
SCHMIDT SAID BACK IN 2009
QUOTING NOW IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T
ANYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT MAYBE
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

ALL OF THE HIGH TECH
COMPANIES NAMED IN THE NSA
LEAK HAVE DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE NSA
PRISM PROGRAM.

THE SIMILARITY OF THEIR
STATEMENTS ABOUT THAT IS
REMARKABLE.

MARK ZUCKERBERG OF FACEBOOK
SAID HERE FACEBOOK IS NOT
AND HAS NEVER BEEN PART OF
ANY PROGRAM TO GIVE THE
U.S. OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENT DIRECT ACCESS TO
OUR SERVERS.

GOOGLE'S STATEMENT READ AND
I'M QUOTING WE HAVE NOT
JOINED ANY PROGRAM THAT
WOULD GIVE THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENT DIRECT ACCESS TO
OUR SERVERS.

AND APPLE'S STATEMENT,
QUOTE  WE HAVE NOT PROVIDE
ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY WITH
DIRECT ACCESS TO OUR
SERVERS.

OUR CATHERINE HERRIDGE
REPORTED ON FRIDAY IN 2012
THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN
HARNESSED GOOGLE'S
EXPERTISE TO BUILD VIRTUAL
PROFILES OF VOTERS.

THAT VERY TEAM OPERATES
CIVIS ANALYTICS GOOGLE'S
ERIC SCHMIDT INVESTED
EVIDENCE HADLY IN THAT
COMPANY.

EXPECTS THE COMPANY TO WORK
FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
AND ONLY DEMOCRATS NEXT
YEAR.

ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG
SAYS THERE IS HUGE
POTENTIAL FOR DATA MINING
OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

WE DECIDE WE WANT TO
TARGET UNION MEMBERS.

WE WANT TO TARGET TEA PARTY
MEMBERS.

WE WANT TO TARGET WHOEVER
WE WANT, THEY CAN TAKE THE
INFORMATION THEY BUY FROM
ONE DATA BROKER COMBINE IT
WITH ANOTHER.

GIVEN THE RECENT
REVELATIONS THAT FOX NEWS
JAMES ROSEN AND OTHERS WERE
TARGETED BY THE DOJ AND
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS WERE
TARGETED BY THE IRS, MANY
AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND THE SEARCH
ENGINES WE ALL USE.

SHEP BACK TO YOU.

TO LAUNCH A CLASS ACTION
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT OVER ITS
ELECTRONIC SNOOPING.

AND HE WANTS YOUR HELP.

SENATOR RAND PAUL TOLD "FOX
NEWS SUNDAY" HOST CHRIS
WALLACE HE WILL ASK PHONE
COMPANIES AND INTERNET
PROVIDERS TO INVITE THEIR
CUSTOMERS TO JOIN HIM IN
THE LEGAL CHALLENGE.

AND THAT IF 10 MILLION
PEOPLE SIGN ON, MAYBE
QUOTE  SOMETHING WILL
CHANGE IN WASHINGTON.

THE KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN
ALSO SAYS HE HOPES THE CASE
EVENTUALLY REACHES THE
SUPREME COURT.

RAND PAUL IS A G.O.P.

CONSERVATIVE AND TEA PARTY
FAVORITE ALSO POSITIONING
FOR A 2016 PRESIDENTIAL
RUN.

HE DELIVERED A COMMENCEMENT
ADDRESS IN PENNSYLVANIA
TODAY.

THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT
AGAINST WHAT PAUL CALLS THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S BIG
GOVERNMENT INTRUSION MAKES
A GREAT POLITICAL
ORGANIZING TOOL OVER THE
NEXT FOUR YEARS.

OUTRAGE OVER THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY'S
COLLECTION OF CALL DATA
RECORDS FROM BILLIONS OF
PHONE CALLS IN THE U.S. HAS
ONCE AGAIN UNITED CIVIL
LIBERTARIANS ON THE RIGHT
AND THE LEFT.

THIS IS WHAT WE OBJECTED
TO AND WHAT OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS PARTLY FOUGHT THE
REVOLUTION OVER IS THEY DID
NOT WANT GENERALIZED
WARRANTS WHERE YOU COULD GO
HOUSE TO HOUSE WITH
SOLDIERS LOOKING FOR THINGS
OR NOW FROM COMPUTER TO
COMPUTER TO PHONE TO PHONE
WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHO YOU
ARE TAGHTING WELL PAUL
BLAMES BOTH PARTIES IN
CONGRESS TOO MUCH EXECUTIVE
POWER.

ON THE LIBERAL LEFT YOU
HAVE FOLKS LIKE FORMER OHIO
CONGRESSMAN DENNIS KUCINICH
WHO HAS RUN FOR PRESIDENT
HIMSELF TWICE.

HERE HE IS.

YOU HAVE AN EXPECTATION
TO PRIVACY THAT GOVERNMENT
WILL STAY OUT OF YOUR
BEDROOM THAT GOVERNMENT
WILL STAY OUT OF YOUR BANK
ACCOUNTS YOUR MEDICAL
RECORDS, YOUR EDUCATIONAL
RECORDS.

ONCE THE PATRIOT ACT WAS
PASSED, IT PIERCED THAT
SHIELD OF PROTECTION WHICH
INDIVIDUALS THOUGHT THAT
THEY HAD.

WELL, KUCINICH VOTED
AGAINST THE PATRIOT ACT.

RAND PAUL WASN'T IN
CONGRESS AT THE TIME.

HE HAS SINCE EMERGED AS A
REAL HARSH CRITIC AND EACH
PUSHED TO BLOCK THE PATRIOT
ACT'S REAUTHORIZATION.

BEN FRANKLIN SUMMED IT UP
TWO CENTURIES AGO PLUS
SAYING THOSE WILLING TO
GIVE UP LIBERTY TO OBTAIN A
TEMPORARY MEASURE OF SAFETY
DESERVE NEITHER.

BUT HE WAS LIVING IN THIS
MODERN AGE OF INSTANTANEOUS
GLOBAL COMMUNICATION AND
TERRORISM.

AND THAT'S WHERE THE
DILEMMA REALLY SAND BOTH
SIDES ARE TRYING TO BALANCE
IT SHEP.
