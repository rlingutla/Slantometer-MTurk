DRAMATIC NEW TAPE AND A NEW TIME
LINE.

RUN, KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

DID THE KILLER PLAN TO TARGET
OTHER CITIES BEFORE TAKING AIM
AT LAS VEGAS?

AND TONIGHT IS THE NRA OPENING
THE DOOR TO A BAN ON BUMP
STOCKS?

THE HORROR AND INTENSITY OF LAST
SUNDAY NIGHT'S ATTACK IN LAS
VEGAS SEEN IN SNIPPETS OF VIDEO
UP TO THIS POINT IS COMING INTO
SHARPER FOCUS TONIGHT AS YET
ANOTHER NEW VIDEO EMERGES, THIS
TIME CAPTURING THE ENTIRE
[ INAUDIBLE ] UNDERSTAND WHY
THOSE IN THE LINE OF FIRE FELT
LIKE IT WENT ON FOREVER.

GO, GO!

EVERYBODY GO!

WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH MORE
OF THAT VIDEO IN A MOMENT AND
WHAT IT TELLS INVESTIGATORS.

BUT FIRST NEW INFORMATION ABOUT
THE SHOOTER STEPHEN PADDOCK AND
WHY POLICE SUSPECT HE HAD ALSO
CONSIDERED ATTACKS ON CROWDS AT
BIG EVENTS IN CHICAGO AND
BOSTON.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THIS NEW
INFORMATION COMES FROM WHAT
AUTHORITIES HOPE WILL BE ONE OF
THE MOST PRODUCTIVE SEARCHES NOW
UNDERWAY, OF HIS ELECTRONIC
TRAIL FROM THE HALF DOZEN PHONES
AND COMPUTERS HE LEFT BEHIND.

OFFICIALS SAY STEPHEN PADDOCK
DID INTERNET RESEARCH EARLIER
THIS YEAR ON LA LA PALOOZA, THE
SUMMER MUSIC FESTIVAL IN
CHICAGO'S GRANT PARK.

THEY SAY HE EVEN RESERVED ROOMS
IN A HOTEL THAT OVERLOOKS THE
PARK FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE
EVENT THOUGH HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

HE ALSO RESEARCHED EVENTS AT
BOSTON'S FENWAY PARK AND NEARBY
HOTELS, OFFICIALS SAY.

SEARCHES OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES
FOUND IN HIS HOME AND HIS
INTERNET BROWSING HISTORY, A
SIGN, THEY SAY, PADDOCK WAS
THINKING OF ATTACKING LARGE
CROWDS MONTHS BEFORE THE LAS
VEGAS SHOOTING RAMPAGE.

BUT SO FAR INVESTIGATORS ARE
STUMPED OVER HOW STEPHEN PADDOCK
WENT FROM BEING A VARSITY TENNIS
PLAYER AND SOCIABLE HIGH SCHOOL
STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA TO THE
ANTI-SOCIAL FORMER ACCOUNTANT
WHO BECAME A MASS MURDERER.

HIS BROTHER ERIC SAYS HE KNOWS
OF NO SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SUCH A
PROFOUND CHANGE.

SOMETHING HAPPENED IN HIS
HEAD THAT THE STEVE I KNEW TWO
WEEKS AGO NO LONGER THE GUY WHO
DID THAT.

HIS GIRLFRIEND MARILOU DANLEY
HAS TOLD AUTHORITIES PADDOCK HAD
SOME MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND
WOULD SOMETIMES LIE IN BED
CRYING OUT, OH, MY GOD.

BUT INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY HAVE
YET TO FIND ANY HEALTH PROBLEMS,
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL, GRAVE ENOUGH
TO PUSH HIM INTO BECOMING A
KILLER.

AS FOR POLICE SAYING HE
MIGHT HAVE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN,
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY FOUND NO
HARD EVIDENCE OF THAT OR OF HELP
FROM ANYONE ELSE IN PLANNING OR
CARRYING OUT THE ATTACK.

AND DESPITE TIPS THAT PADDOCK
WAS WITH A WOMAN THE DAY OF THE
SHOOTING, NO SUCH PERSON HAS YET
BEEN FOUND.

RUN.

CHAOS ON THE VEGAS STRIP.

YOU'VE BEEN SHOT?

EMPLOYEE RAYMOND PAGE RECORDS
THIS HEART POUNDING SCENE,
CONCERT GOERS RUNNING FOR THEIR
LIVES.

GET DOWN!

THE CRIME SCENE AND A TIME LINE
OF THE BLOOD SHED.

1005:00 P.M., FROM HIS DEADLY
PERCH, STEPHEN PADDOCK UNLEASHES
A FURY OF GUN FIRE.

1015, THE SHOTS ARE OVER, BUT
PANIC OVER WHELMS THE STREETS
AND FIRST RESPONDERS.

IT WAS JUST MASS CHAOS.

IT WAS VICTIMS WHO WERE ROLLING
UP TO US IN TRUCKS, IN THE BEDS
OF THE TRUCKS JUST LOADED UP.

FIRES 2 ROUNDS AT A SECURITY
GUARD WHO APPROACHES HIS ROOM.

SHOT IN THE LEG THE GUARD STILL
LEADS POLICE TO THE SOOEP WHERE
AT 1120 THEY FIND PADDOCK DEAD.

HE METICULOUSLY PLANNED ON
THE WORST DOMESTIC ATTACK IN THE
UNITED STATES HISTORY.

WITH 1600 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION
AND 50 POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES.

TONIGHT, INVESTIGATORS QUESTION,
DID HE HAVE AN ESCAPE PLAN AND
POSSIBLY HELP?

YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE
ASSUMPTION HE HAD TO HAVE SOME
HELP AT SOME POINT.

MOMENTS AFTER THE MASSACRE,
[ INAUDIBLE ] BEGAN LOADING THE
WOUNDED INTO HIS TRUCK.

ANYBODY ELSE?

BUT FOUR DAYS AFTER THE
MASSACRE, DID THEY SURVIVE?

THE NIGHT THERE IS SO MUCH
UNCERTAINTY AND PAIN.

IN WASHINGTON THIS EVENING SIGNS
THE DOOR MAY BE OPENING SLIGHTLY
FROM REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND
POSSIBLY FROM THE NRA TO NEW
RESTRICTIONS ON BUMP STOCKS, THE
DEVICES USED BY THE LAS VEGAS
KILLER TO TURN HIS SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS INTO AUTOMATIC MACHINE
GUNS.

REPUBLICAN RESISTANCE ON GUN
CONTROL, TONIGHT A NEW NARROW
OPENING ON BUMP STOCKS WHICH
LETS SEMIAUTOMATIC GUNS FIRE
FASTER.

APPARENTLY THIS ALLOWS YOU TO
TAKE A SEMIAUTOMATIC TURN INTO A
FULL AUTOMATIC.

IT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO BEING
LOOK INTO.

SPEAKER PAUL RYAN, BUT ONE OF
THE HIGHEST RANKING SENATORS
JOHN CORNYN.

I THINK IT'S WORTH SERIOUS
HIMSELF WILLING TO CONSIDER NEW
REGULATIONS.

WE ARE OPEN TO HAVING THAT
CONVERSATION.

WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION AND WE WANT TO
BE PART OF IT MOVING FORWARD.

THROUGH ALL THIS HAS BEEN THE
NRA, SILENT SINCE SUNDAY'S
SHOOTING.

TODAY, SURPRISINGLY SUPPORTING
STRICTER RULES.

IN A STATEMENT SAYING, QUOTE,
DEVICES DESIGNED TO ALLOW
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES TO FUNCTION
LIKE FULLY AUTOMATE I CAN RIFLES
SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
REGULATIONS, ASKING THE ATF TO
REVIEW BUMP STOCKS.

BUT IN 2010 THAT AGENCY
DETERMINED THE DEVICES ARE
ALLOWED BASED ON FEDERAL LAW.

MEANING IT WOULD BE UP TO
CONGRESS TO CHANGE THAT LAW FROM
CAPITOL HILL.

THAT'S WHERE STEVE SCALISE IS
JUST BACK TO WORK AFTER GETTING
SHOT THIS SUMMER AT A
CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL PARTLY
CLOUDY ADVERTISE TALKING NOW
WITH INNOCENCE'S CHUCK TODD.

I DO THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT
EARLY TO STAY PEOPLE KNOW WHAT
TO DO TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.

BIPARTISAN BILL WOULD BAN BUMP
STOCKS.

IF I KEEP A CONSTANT FORWARD
PRESSURE ON THIS, IT SIMULATES
FULL AUTO.

THEY'VE BEEN SEEN MOSTLY AS A
TARGET PRACTICE NOVELTY.

LEGAL NOW, BUT MAYBE NOT FOR
LONG.

 FINALLY TONIGHT WE WANT TO
END ON THE MEMORIES, THE STORIES
AND THE EMOTIONAL TRIBUTES TO
THE LIVES LOST IN THE TRAGEDY IN
LAS VEGAS.

SO MANY MOMS AND DADS, SONS AND
DAUGHTERS, FRIENDS AND LOVED
ONES GONE NOW, BUT NEVER
FORGOTTEN.

BRENDAN STEWART'S LOVE FOR
COUNTRY MUSIC IN THIS
PERFORMANCE OF THE SONG "YOU
SHOULD BE HERE" THE COVER THAT
WENT VIRAL AFTER HE WAS KILLED
SHIELDING HIS GIRLFRIEND.

THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH
YOU.

RADIO STATION HAS BEEN PLAYING
IT IN STEWART'S HONOR.

IT BREAKS MY HEART THAT
BRENDAN IS NOT AROUND TO HEAR US
PLAY HIS MUSIC, BUT WE KNOW HIS
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WERE ABLE TO
HEAR THAT.

SAYS ALL 58 VICTIMS HAVE BEEN
IDENTIFIED AND IT IS CLEAR THE
IMPACT OF THIS TRAGEDY REACHES
FAR BEYOND VEGAS.

THE 58 VICTIMS WHO LOST THEIR
LIVES IN VEGAS CAME FROM ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND CANADA.

AT LEAST 30 OF THEM CALLED
CALIFORNIA HOME.

ANGIE GOMEZ OF RIVERSIDE LOVED
THEATER AND MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH.

SHE LIVED SO HUMBLY.

SHE'S SO UNASSUMING.

TEACHERS DIED.

SANDY CASEY AND JENNY PARKS.

MS.PARKS WAS THE BEST
CHRISTY DUARTE WORLD FOR THE
L.A. KINGS.

THEY WILL WEAR A STICKER WITH
HER INITIALS ON THE BACKS OF
THEIR HELMETS.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO
HONOR HER AND TO TELL THE WORLD
HOW GREAT OF A PERSON SHE WAS.

VICTIMS LIKE BRENDAN STEWART'S
PERFORMANCE LIVE ON.
