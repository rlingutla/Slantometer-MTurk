AND THE BRAVERY IN OKLAHOMA
THIS WEEK.

WE HEARD THAT TEACHER TRYING TO
CALM HER STUDENTS THE MOMENT
THAT TORNADO HIT.

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

I HATE THIS!

TONIGHT, WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW.

OUR TRIP THROUGH THE SCHOOLS.

FINALLY TONIGHT HERE, WE ARE
JUST BACK FROM OKLAHOMA, AND IT
WASN'T DIFFICULT CHOOSING OUR
"PERSONS OF THE WEEK."

THE TEACHERS PROTECTING THEIR
STUDENTS, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY OF
THEM ARE PARENTS, TOO, WITH
THEIR OWN CHILDREN IN THOSE TWO
SCHOOLS.

THEIR SCREAMS WE WILL NEVER
FORGET.

THE CHILDREN BURYING THEIR HEADS
AT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY, TRAPPED
UNDER THAT TORNADO HOVERING
OVERHEAD.

WE WILL ALSO NEVER FORGET THE
CALM INSTINCTS OF THEIR TEACHER.

SO MANY TEACHERS.

MRS. DIEDZIK, WHO TOLD THEM
THIS --
 IT'S ALMOST OVER!

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THESE BRAVE
TEACHERS.

SO MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO
PARENTS.

AND SO MANY OF THEM HAD CHILDREN
SOMEPLACE ELSE IN THOSE SCHOOLS.

MRS. DIEDZIK, WHO WAS HELPING
HER OWN STUDENTS --
 YOU ARE SAFE AND YOU ARE
FINE.

ABOUT HER OWN DAUGHTER IN THE
FOURTH GRADE OR HER SON IN THE
FIRST GRADE.

BOTH SURVIVED.

AND WE SAW THE
MOMENT LITTLE SAM FOUND HIS
MOTHER, LOOKING UP AT HER,
CONCRETE GRIT IN HIS HAIR.

WHEN SHE TOOK US BACK THIS WEEK,
SHE SHOWED US WHERE HE WAS, IN
THE BACK CORNER OF THAT ROOM.

AND LYING ON TOP OF HIM AND THE
OTHER CHILDREN, HIS TEACHER,
MRS. BITTLE.

MY SON AND ALL OF THE KIDS
HUDDLED DOWN WITH THEIR HANDS
CLASPED BEHIND THEIR HEADS.

SHERI IS A FRIEND AND A
COWORKER.

AND I KNOW THAT MY SON AND
DAUGHTER WERE BOTH IN THE HANDS
OF PEOPLE WHO LOVED THEM.

MRS. BITTLE.

MY ENTIRE CLASS WAS SAFE AND
WELL.

AND GOT DELIVERED TO THEIR
PARENTS, AND -- THE TEACHERS AT
PLAZA TOWERS DIDN'T HAVE THAT
BLESSING.

AND -- AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

TOUR OF THAT OTHER SCHOOL, TOO,
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY, WHERE
THEY LOST SEVEN LITTLE FACES IN
ONE HALLWAY.

WHAT'S STILL A MYSTERY, A
MIRACLE, IS HOW SO MANY OTHERS
GOT OUT.

MOST EVERYTHING THERE IS GONE.

BUT WE NOTICED
MRS. MARINELLI'S FIRST GRADE
CLASSROOM IN TACT.

THE SCHOOLWORK RIGHT THERE ON
THE DESK WHERE IT WAS LEFT.

AND JUST BEFORE THAT TORNADO
HIT, THEY WERE WRITING WHAT THEY
LIKED MOST ABOUT THEIR TEACHER.

I WILL REMEMBER SHE GAVE ME
CUPCAKES.

THEY WERE REMEMBERING, BECAUSE
THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS
LEFT OF SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR.

WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN THE
TORNADO HIT, SHE HAD HER
CHILDREN SINGING IN THE HALLWAY,
TRYING TO DISTRACT THEM.

AND IN THE CLASSROOM NEXT DOOR,
WE WERE SURPRISED TO MEET MISS
DOMINICK, ALREADY BACK PICKING
UP THE PIECES.

SHE TAUGHT THE AUTISTIC
CHILDREN.

SHE SAID MANY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

BUT SHE HAD THE PRESENCE OF
HAVE THEM TEXT MESSAGE THEIR
PARENTS.

EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WOULDN'T
GO THROUGH.

BUT SHE KNEW IT WOULD CALM THEM.

WHAT DID THEY WANT TO SAY?

THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY MOM,
COME GET ME, OR, YOU KNOW, I
WANT TO GO HOME.

MRS. BITTLE, WHAT GOT HER
THROUGH.

I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOUR
NECKLACE.

PRAY BIG.

YES.

SAID.

I DID.

THOSE PARENTS ARE GRATEFUL TO
YOU.

AND TO THEM YOU WOULD SAY?

YOUR CHILD IS MY CHILD.

ALL DAY LONG AND ALL YEAR LONG.

THE OKLAHOMA TEACHERS
AND EVERY TEACHER IN THIS
COUNTRY WHO JUMPS IN WHEN OUR
CHILDREN NEED THEM.

OUR CHILD IS MY CHILD, SHE SAID.
