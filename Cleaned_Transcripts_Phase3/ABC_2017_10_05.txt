OTHER CITIES THE GUNMAN WAS

CHICAGO AND BOSTON.

THEIR PURCHASE IN THE WEEKS
BEFORE.

AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH MAJOR
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAS
VEGAS MASSACRE.

WE ARE LEARNING THE KILLER MAY
HAVE SCOUTED OTHER POTENTIAL
TARGETS IN CHICAGO AND IN
BOSTON.

AND THE DRAMATIC NEW VIDEO FROM
THAT NIGHT.

RUN!

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

GO!

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

GO.

JUST AFTER THE GUNFIRE BEGAN,
CAN YOU HEAR THE OFFICERS
TELLING THE THOUSANDS TO RUN FOR
THEIR LIVES.

HELPING THE VICTIMS WHO HAD BEEN
SHOT AND WHO HAD FALLEN.

AND TONIGHT, OUR TEAM FLYING
BESIDE THE HOTEL AND OVER THE
MASSIVE CRIME SCENE WHERE THE
FBI IS STILL CAREFULLY COMBING
THROUGH THE EVIDENCE.

HELICOPTER HERE IN LAS VEGAS FOR
THE FIRST LOOK TONIGHT INTO
STEPHEN PADDOCK'S SNIPER'S NEST.

HIGH ABOVE THE LAS VEGAS STRIP
AT THE GILDED DE.CAFATHF  OE
INSIDE ONE SHATTERED WINDOW,
PILLOWS STACKED HIGH ON A
STRIPPED BED.

THE OTHER WINDOW, PARTIALLY
BLOCKED BY PLYWOOD.

BUT INSIDE, INVESTIGATORS
CAREFULLY DISSECTING THE SCENE.

DOWN BELOW, YOU CAN SEE FBI
AGENTS PICKING THROUGH EVERY
SINGLE PIECE OF DEBRIS DOWN
THERE ON THE FAIRGROUNDS FLOOR.

THEY DON'T WANT TO MISS
ANYTHING, A SINGLE BULLET
FRAGMENT OR A SINGLE PIECE OF
EVIDENCE.

THIS IS THE AFTERMATH.

BUT TONIGHT, NEW VIDEO GIVES NEW
INSIGHT INTO THE CHAOS ON THE
TRIGGERING HYSTERIA, CONFUSION.

SHOCKINGLY, PEOPLE SEEM UNABLE
TO PROCESS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

RUN!

THOSE ARE SHOTS!

RUN!

DON'T WALK!

YELLING AT THEM THAT THEY'RE
UNDER ATTACK.

EVERYBODY
AS THE CROWDS RUN PAST HER.

LET'S GO!

TRUCK, PARKED NEARBY, DRIVING IT
BACK INTO THE KILL ZONE, TURNING
IT INTO A MAKESHIFT AMBULANCE.

RIGHT HERE, COME IN HERE.

IN, ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

GET IN THE TRUCK, GET IN THE
TRUCK.

DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WOUNDED
PEOPLE WE CAN TAKE?

NOT RIGHT NOW.

BEHIND THE WHEEL, DRIVES THEM
BACK DOWN THE STRIP TO
PARAMEDICS.

I GOT FIVE WOUNDED.

GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST HERE.

SOMEONE HELP, PLEASE, PLEASE.

I'M BLEEDING SO MUCH.

ABOVE, EVIDENCE OF A MASSACRE
STILL FROZEN IN TIME.

IT DOESN'T LOOK SO MUCH LIKE
THERE WAS A CONCERT THERE, BUT
AATTH
THOSE OVERTURNED LAWN CHAIRS,
WE'VE SEEN STROLLERS THERE,
WE'VE SEEN WALKERS THERE.

EVIDENCE OF JUST THE ABSOLUTE
CHAOS.

AND TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING
THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK MAY HAVE
SCOUTED OTHER TARGETS AS FAR
AWAY AS BOSTON AND CHICAGO.

ACCORDING TO SOURCES BRIEFED ON
THE INVESTIGATION, HE BOOKED
ROOMS AT CHICAGO'S BLACKSTONE
HOTEL IN AUGUST, THE SAME DATES
AS THE LOLLAPALOOZA FESTIVAL
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IN GRANT
PARK.

ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED
EACH DAY.

BUT PADDOCK NEVER CHECKED IN.

LAW ENFORCEMENT SOCES ALSO
TELL US HIS PHONE SHOWS A GOOGLE
PARK" IN BOSTON.LS AROUND FENWAY
THAT BALLPARK'S CAPACITY?

NEARLY 38,000 PEOPLE.

BUT NO EVIDENCE HE TRAVELED TO
BOSTON, EITHER.

INSTEAD, HE STAYED CLOSE TO
HOME, HOLING UP IN ONE OF THE
CASINOS HE KNEW SO WELL, LOOKING
DOWN ON THAT HELPLESS CROWD.

AND MATT, NOW YOU'RE LEARNING,
THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE ELSE
AUTHORITIES WANT TO TALK TO?

INVESTIGATORS SAY THAT PADDOCK
WAS SEEN WITH A MYSTERY WOMAN IN
HIS LAST DAYS.

NOW, SHE WAS NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY.

THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO
SHE IS AND WHAT SHE KNOWS.

ALSO, GIVEN THE ARSENAL THAT HE
AMASSED, ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVE
MATERIALS AND THE FACT THAT HE
MAY HAVE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN,
THEY'RE NOW SAYING THAT THEY
CANNOT RULE OUT THAT HE HAD AN
ACCOMPLICE.

THE OTHER MAJOR HEADLINE
INVOLVES THE GIRLFRIEND, NOW
QUESTIONED BY THE FBI BACK HERE
IN THE U.S.
WHAT MARILOU DANLEY SAYS WHEN
ASKED IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING.

AND TONIGHT, ABC NEWS OBTAINING
A CHECK.

WHAT THEY PAID CASH FOR IN THE
WEEKS BEFORE.

AND HOW THE SALESPERSON
DESCRIBED THE COUPLE.

TONIGHT FROM AN UNLIKELY PLACE
ABOUT STEPHEN PADDOCK -- THE
RENO CAR DEALERSHIP WHERE HE
PAYING CASH, WITH A CHECK FOR
$14,411 -- NOT A SIGN OF SOMEONE
WITH FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

EMPLOYEES HERE TODAY TOLD US THE
FBI QUESTIONED THEM ABOUT
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH
PADDOCK AND HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, WHEN THEY CAME
TO BUY THE CAR.

MARILOU EVEN WANTED TO GET A
LEXUS, BUT HE WAS LIKE, I'M NOT
GOING TO SPEND $10,000 MORE FOR
A CAR THAT'S GOT THE EXACT SAM
WENT ON A TEST DRIVE, SHE TOLD
THE FEMALE SALESPERSON THAT
PADDOCK HAD SAHED VEOMFRR  A
TROUBLED MARRIAGE.

SHE SAID SHE HAD A BAD
RELATIONSHIP PRIOR TO HIM.

AND HOW HE HAD, YOU KNOW, TURNED
RELATIONSHIP WITH PADDOCK HAS
NOW BECOME A KEY FOCUS OF THE
INVESTIGATION.

AGENTS PADDOCK WAS A CARING MAN
WHO SHOWED NO SIGN OF VIOLENCE.

AND THE FBI ALSO WANTED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE MORE THAN $100,000
THAT PADDOCK WIRED TO THE
PHILIPPINES FOR DANLEY, BEFORE
SENDING HER THERE JUST TWO WEEKS
IN ADVANCE OF THE SHOOTING.

HER LAWYER READ HER STATEMENT.

I WAS GRATEFUL, BUT HONESTLY,
I WAS WORRIED THAT FIRST, THE
UNEXPECTED TRIP HOME AND THEN
THE MONEY WAS A WAY OF BREAKING
INVESTIGATION, THE FBI SAYS IT
HAS RULED OUT MONEY PROBLEMS AND
RULED OUT ANY CONNECTION TO
ANARCHIST GROUPS, TO
ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUPS, TO
OVERSEAS TERROR GROUPS.

FOUR DAYS LATER, STILL NO
MOTIVE.

BUT AS YOU BEGAN TO POINT OUT
RIGHT THERE, YOU HAVE LEARNED
WHAT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO RULE
THEY'RE STILL STUMPED, BUT
THEY'RE CERTAIN THEY WILL FIND
OUT A MOTIVE, SOONER OR LATER.

DRILLING DOWN FURTHER NOW ON HIS
FINANCES, HIS COMPUTER AND HIS
MENTAL HEALTH, DAVID.

ONE THING, BRIAN, SO MANY
PEOPLE ARE ASKING ABOUT IS THIS
BELIEF HE DIDN'T SNAP IN THE
MOMENT, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY
SIGNS NOW HE HAD BEEN PREPARING
THIS FOR SOME TIME.

THIS WAS A WELL-PLANNED ATTACK.

NEARLY TWO DOZEN WEAPONS IN HIS
HOTEL SUITE, HALF OF THEM
CONVERTED TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC,
AS WELL AS THOSE CAMERAS,
INCLUDING THE ONE IN THAT ROOM
SERVICE CART OUTSIDE HIS ROOM,
PLACED TO GIVE HIM EARLY WARNING
ABOUT ANYONE COMING TO STOP HIM,
DAVID.

STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THAT MOTIVE.

AFTER THE MASSACRE TOOK 58
LIVES, COULD THERE BE BIPARTISAN
MOVEMENT NOW ON THIS IN
WASHINGTON?

THE GROWING CALL TONIGHT TO BAN
OR REGULATE THOSE SO-CALLED BUMP
STOCKS.

THE DEVICE USED BY THE GUNMAN,
ATTACHING IT TO SOME OF HIS
WEAPONS, TURNING SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS TO FIRE LIKE AN
AUTOMATIC.

DEMOCRATS, SOME REPUBLICANS AND
A SIGNAL TODAY FROM THE NRA ON
THIS?

MOST POWERFUL GUN LOBBY, TODAY,
A CALL FOR CHANGE IN THE WAKE OF
THE NATION'S DEADLIEST MASS
SHOOTING.

FOUND ON A DOZEN OF THE LAS
VEGAS SHOOTER'S WEAPONS, THOSE
BUMP STOCK ATTACHMENTS THAT
ALLOW A RIFLE TO FIRE LIKE A
MACHINE GUN.

THE NRA NOW SAYS, "DEVICES
DESIGNED TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC
RIFLES TO FUNCTION LIKE FULLY
AUTOMATIC RIFLES SHOULD BE
SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
REGULATIONS."

AND TONIGHT, A GROWING NUMBER OF
TOP REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WOULD
CONSIDER LEGISLATION BANNING
BUMP STOCKS ALTOGETHER.

IF THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO
A FIREARM THAT BREACHES THE
SPIRIT OF THE LAW AGAINST
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, THEN I THINK
THERE WOULD BE BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH IT.

CLEARLY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE
NEED TO LOOK INTO.

REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN EVEN
VOWING TO INTRODUCE HIS OWN
BILL.

WITH A BUMP STOCK, ASSAULT
RIFLES CAN FIRE HUNDREDS OF
ROUNDS PER MINUTE, CHANGING A
GUN FROM THIS TO THIS.

BUT NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ARE
ONBOARD WITH TOUGHER LAWS.

I DON'T THINK THE 80 OR
90 MILLION AMERICANS WHO
EXERCISE THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHTS TO OWN A GUN SHOULD BE
PUNISHED FOR THE ACT OF ONE EVIL
PERSON.

FAR SILENT ON GUN CONTROL IN THE
WAKE OF THE LAS VEGAS MASSACRE,
BUT LATE TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP
SIGNALED HE'LL BE WEIGHING IN ON
THE BUMP STOCK DEBATE, TOO.

WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THAT
OV TER TIME.

THE PRESIDENT THERE SAYING HE
WILL LOOK INTO WHAT CAN BE DONE
ON THESE BUMP STOCKS.
