AND A THREAT OF POSSIBLE FORCE
AGAINST SYRIA AFTER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK REPORTEDLY KILLED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING
CHILDREN.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS A YEAR
AGO THAT THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WOULD BE A RED LINE IN
SYRIA.

BUT NOW THAT THERE ARE DRAMATIC
NEW CLAIMS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
IS HAPPENING AGAIN.

OTHER NATIONS APPEAR TO BE
TAKING A MUCH HARDER LINE.

WE'RE BEING EXTERMINATED.

THAT'S WHAT ONE SYRIAN TOLD THE
REUTERS NEWS SERVICE TODAY.

OPPOSITION FORCES CLAIM THE
GOVERNMENT KILLED HUNDREDS OF
ITS OWN PEOPLE IN A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK OUTSIDE DAMASCUS.

THEN THIS.

ACTIVISTS SAY THIS IS AMATEUR
VIDEO OF SYRIA SHELLING THE SAME
AREA AGAIN TODAY.

THERE IS VIDEO THAT PURPORTS TO
SHOW VICTIMS OF YESTERDAY'S
POISON GAS ATTACK.

THE GOVERNMENT DENIES USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, BUT IS
REFUSING TO LET UNITED NATIONS
INSPECTORS SEE IT FOR
THEMSELVES, EVEN THOUGH THOSE
INSPECTORS ARE ALREADY IN
DAMASCUS A FEW SHORT MILES AWAY
TO INVESTIGATE EARLIER CLAIMS OF
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.

U.S. OFFICIALS ARE REFUSING TO
POINT FINGERS DESPITE THE VIDEO
AND ALL THE EVIDENCE.

YEAH, NOT JUST REFUSING TO
POINT FINGERS IN TERMS OF BLAME,
SHEP, BUT ACTUALLY SAYING THEY
HAVE NOT DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDED
THERE WAS A CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK.

WE ARE UNABLE TO CONCLUSIVELY
DETERMINE CW USE, BUT WE'RE
FOCUSED ON DOING EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE WITHIN OUR POWER TO
NAIL DOWN THE FACTS.

NAILING DOWN THE FACTS WILL
INCLUDE LOOKING AT THIS VIDEO,
WHICH APPEARS TO SHOW SCORES OF
PEOPLE KILLED AND BEING TREATED
WITH NO SIGNS OF THE SORT OF
PHYSICAL TRAUMA THERE MIGHT BE
IF IT HAD BEEN A NORMAL SORT OF
BOMB ATTACK.

NOW, THE UNITED NATIONS AND
SECRETARY-GENERAL HAS ALSO
CALLED FOR AN URGENT
INVESTIGATION.

THOSE INSPECTORS, THE UNITED
NATIONS ONES ALREADY IN
DAMASCUS, AS YOU SAID, SHEP,
JUST 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE
SCENE OF THE ALLEGED ATTACK, BUT
UNABLE TO GET THERE WITHOUT
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE,
NOT FORTHCOMING RIGHT NOW.

DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF
CHILDREN DEAD ON THE FLOOR WITH
NO WOUNDS, JUST LYING DEAD.

SOME NATIONS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS
AND SAID, WE'VE GOT TO ACT.

YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

THE FRENCH AMONG THE LEADING
NATIONS IN TERMS OF ISSUING
STRONG STATEMENTS.

THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID TODAY
THAT IF INDEED IT IS
DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED THIS WAS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED BY THE
SYRIAN REGIME, THEN THERE MUST
BE A REACTION OF FORCE AS HE PUT
IT.

I SPOKE TO ONE LEADING MIDDLE
EAST EXPERT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY TO ASK HIM
WHAT EXACTLY HE BELIEVED
HAPPENED.

HE SAID 100% THIS IS THE WORK OF
THE GOVERNMENT REGIME.

HE SAID ASSAD TRIES TO CREATE A
NEW BALANCE OF FEAR WITH THE BYF
GAS AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

HE FEELS HE CAN DO IT.

THIS IS WHERE STRONG AMERICAN
REACTION CAN DETER HIM, BUT THAT
STRONG AMERICAN REACTION RIGHT
NOW SEEMS SOME WAY OFF.

BIGGEST STOCKPILES OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS INCLUDING SARIN GAS,
MUSTARD GAS, AND MANY EXPERTS
WHO LOOKED THAT THE VIDEO
BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN SARIN.

OF COURSE IT'S NOT BEEN
CONFIRMED.
