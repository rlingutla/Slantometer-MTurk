AND NOW TO ANOTHER GLOBAL
WORRY AT THIS HOUR.

WE DO HAVE NEW REPORTING IN THE
MASSIVE CYBERATTACK.

HOSPITALS PARALYZED, SURGERIES
HALTED, AND TODAY WE LEARNED OF
AN AUTO ASSEMBLY LINE SUDDENLY
STOPPED BECAUSE COMPUTERS HAD
SHUT DOWN.

HACKERS INFECTING SOME 300,000
COMPUTERS IN MORE THAN 150
COUNTRIES NOW, INCLUDING THE
U.S., LOCKING THOSE COMPANIES UP
THROUGH THEIR COMPUTERS, AND
THEN DEMANDING RANSOM TO FREE
THE FILES.

AND TONIGHT, INVESTIGATORS SAY
NEW CLUES MAY BE POINTING TO A
FAMILIAR CULPRIT.

RESEARCHERS TRACKING THE ATTACK
TONIGHT, SAY THE TRAIL COULD
LEAD TO NORTH KOREA.

THAT THE COMPUTER CODE THAT
PRODUCED THE ATTACK WITH THESE
OMINOUS MESSAGES, THE CODE USED
BY NORTH KOREA ON ATTACK ON
INTERNATIONAL BANKS LAST YEAR.

IT COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE USING
THE NORTH KOREAN CODE, SAYS
RESEARCHERS.

BUT THE COUNTRY HAS A LONG
RECORD OF COMPUTER CRIMINALITY.

WE HAVE SEEN THEM STEAL MONEY
AND INFORMATION.

WE HAVE SEEN THEM DESTROY
INFORMATION.

ATTRIBUTION OF WHO WAS BEHIND
THE MASSIVE ATTACKS.

AS OF TONIGHT THE TALLY OF
ATTACKS HAS GROWN.

MORE THAN 300,000 IN 150
COUNTRIES.

AUTO PLANTS, OFFICES, RAILROADS
AROUND THE ROAD, AND FEDEX IN
THE U.S.

WERE ALL HIT.

THE MOST DEVASTATING, HOSPITALS
IN GREAT BRITAIN, WHERE
AMBULANCES WERE TURNED AWAY.

CANCER TREATMENTS AND SURGERIES
CANCELLED.

HORRIBLE.

CRIED A LOT.

DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

COMPANIES APPEAR TO HAVE
FOLLOWED THE HACKERS' DIRECTIONS
TO PAY $300 IN RANSOM OR MORE TO
HAVE THEIR FILES FREED, AND
THAT, TOO, TURNED OUT TO BE
SCAM.

IT APPEARS LESS THAN $70,000
HAS BEEN PAID IN RANSOM.

WE'RE NOT AWARE OF PAYMENTS THAT
HAVE LED TO ANY DATA RECOVERY.

BRIAN ROSS WITH US LIVE
TONIGHT.

THOSE ATTACKS ARE STILL COMING
FROM THAT SAME GROUP, BRIAN.

THAT'S RIGHT, THERE WAS A NEW
VARIANT OF THE ATTACK TODAY AND
ANOTHER ONE YESTERDAY, BUT WERE
SHUT DOWN BEFORE THEY SPREAD TOO
FAR.

NEW WAVES OF THIS ATTACK.

WHAT DO YOU DO?

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
TO DOWNLOAD ANY UPGRADES, THE
FIXES WITH THE PATCHES THAT
BLOCK THIS ATTACK.

USE THOSE AUTOMATIC UPGRADES.
