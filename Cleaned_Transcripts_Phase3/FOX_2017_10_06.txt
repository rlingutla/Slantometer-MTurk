CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING OPEN
TO LEGISLATION BANNING BUMP
STOCKS?

AS I SAID YESTERDAY, WE WANT
TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.

WE WANT MORE INFORMATION.

WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
THAT OVER THE COMING DAYS.

THAT'S THE CURRENT POSITION.

HASN'T CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY.

THANK YOU, SARAH.

LAS VEGAS QUESTION.

THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE
POLICE AND THEIR RESPONSE AFTER
THE MASS SHOOTINGS.

NEVADA --
 CAN YOU SPEAK UP A LITTLE
BIT?

NEVADIANS CREDIT FEDERAL
MONDAY PROGRAMS TO TRAIN THEM TO
DEAL WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS TO
DEAL WITH THE GREAT RESPONSE.

YOU HAVE CUTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS
IN YOUR BUDGET PLANS?

ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT?

I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE
CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD.

IF THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE WE
FEEL LIKE THE SAFETY AND
SECURITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
MAY BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF CUTS,
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO
RE-VISIT IT AT THAT TIME.

LAS VEGAS IS A BIG STORY STILL.

A TERRIBLE STORY.

WE'RE STILL LEFT A WEEK LATER
WITH THE QUESTION WHY AND WHEN
WILL PEOPLE BE TALKING TO YOU?

STEVE WYNN, ONE OF THE KINGS OF
LAS VEGAS.

THE HEAD OF TWO OF THE BIGGEST
HOTELS AND CASINOS IN THAT TOWN.

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WYNN
DECIDE ADD YEAR AGO THAT
LAS VEGAS WAS A SOFT TARGET.

WHEN YOU HEAR THE KINDS OF
THINGS -- WE'LL HAVE AN
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SUNDAY --
THAT HE DID TO TRY TO HARDEN THE
WYNN HOTEL AND TO HARDEN THE
ENCORE HOTEL IN TERMS OF
BRINGING IN FORMER SEAL TEAMS
SIX MEMBERS, FORMER CIA
OFFICERS, HIDDEN DETECTORS,
HIDDEN PROFILERS IN THE CASINOS.

JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIS
PROPERTIES.

BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW THREAT,
WHICH WE SAW FROM STEPHEN
PADDOCK, WHICH IS KNOCKING OUT
THE WINDOWS AND FIRING DOWN FROM
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL TALK TO
STEVE WYNN ABOUT, HOW DO YOU
HANDLE AND PREVENT THAT WE'LL BE
TALKING TO ERIC PRATT, THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS
OF AMERICA.

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHILE THE
NRA IS SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD
REGULATE AND RESTRICT THE BUMP
STOCKS, ERIC PRATT SAYS NO.

WE'LL TALK TO HIM.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS
CONCERT KILLER.

NEW REPORTS ON WHAT THE GUNMAN
HAD IN HIS ROOM AND QUESTIONS
NOW.

WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS ROOM?

AS THE AGENT CHASE DOWN CLUES
AND SURVIVORS FACE CHANGED
LIVES, THIS WEEK A RETIRED
CARPENTER DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO
PLACE 58 WHITE CROSSES ON THE
STRIP.

ONE FOR EACH PERSON KILLED.

HERE ONE WOMAN SITS NEAR THE
CROSS FOR HER COUSIN,
20-YEAR-OLD BAILEY SCHWIETZER.

INVESTIGATORS IN LAS VEGAS ARE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER
ANYBODY ELSE WAS IN THE
LAS VEGAS KILLER'S HOTEL SWEET.

OFFICIALS TELL NBC THAT THEY
FOUND A PHONE CHARGER IN THE
ROOM THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE
GUNMAN'S CELL PHONE.

IN ADDITION, RECORDS SHOW
SOMEBODY ELSE DID ACCESS THAT
ROOM WHILE HIS CAR WAS GONE.

THERE COULD BE A FEW
EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS.

BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW THE
CORRECT ONE YET.

THIS DEVELOPMENT AS
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO
DETERMINE WHY THE GUNMAN FIRED
ON A COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL
KILLING 58 AND INJURING MORE
THAN 400.

THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE YESTERDAY.

SO WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS,
A PICTURE IS EMERGING OF STEPHEN
PADDOCK THAT PAYMENTS HIM AS A
LOSER, ALONER THAT WOULD GO TO
PROSTITUTES.

PROSTITUTES HAVE BEEN TALKING TO
HIM AND HE WAS CHEAP AND NEVER
SHOWED EMOTION WHILE HE WAS WITH
THEM.

IT APPEARS THE MYSTERY WOMAN
THAT HE WAS SEEN WITH GAMBLING
HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING WAS A
HOOKER.

HIS GIRLFRIEND SAID THAT HE
GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT IN RECENT
WEEKS AND BECAME OBSESSED WITH
MARILOU DANLEY'S EX-HUSBAND.

BUT SHE TOLD POLICE SHE HAD NO
IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING MASS
MURDER.

THE CAR AT MANDALAY BAY HAD 50
POUNDS OF TANNERITE AND
AMMUNITION AND FERTILIZER.

AND THERE'S NOW REPORTS THAT
PADDOCK TRIED TO BUY TRACER
AMMUNITION AT A PHOENIX GUN
SHOW.

HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE
THE GUN DEALER WAS SOLD OUT BUT
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS
RECORDING THAT HE HAD 1,000
TRACER ROUNDS BUT DIDN'T USE
THEM.

TRACERS COULD HAVE MADE THIS
SHOOTING MORE DEADLY, MORE
ACCURATE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE
ROUNDS WERE GOING.

THAT RAPID FIRE HAIL OF BULLETS
LASTED TEN MINUTES.

WE JUST INTERVIEWED AN OFF DUTY
EMT THAT WAS AT THE CONCERT WITH
HIS WIFE.

HE USED HIS BELT AS A TOURNIQUET
ON A MAN'S LEG AND CARRIED
SEVERAL TO A TENT INCLUDING A
WOMAN SHOT IN THE BACK.

THE EMT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SIDE
THE WOMAN WHO HE'S RESCUED AND
SAVED AT THE HOSPITAL.

HE FEELS LIKE HE'S FAMILY WITH
THEM JUST EMOTIONAL STORIES, ONE
AFTER THE OTHER.

THOUSANDS GATHERING TO HONOR A
FORMAL NATIONAL GUARD SERGEANT
AND LAS VEGAS POLICE OFFICER
KILLED IN SUNDAY NIGHT'S
MASSACRE.

FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAY
CHARLESTON HARTFIELD WAS ONE OF
THE GREATEST AMERICANS THEY EVER
KNEW WITH A HEART OF GOLD AND
THAT HE DIED TRYING TO SAVE
OTHERS.

IMAGES IN OUR SLIDE SHOW FOR YOU
THIS AFTERNOON.

HERE YOU CAN SEE THE FORMER
SERGEANT'S WIDOW AND THEIR TWO
CHILDREN AT THE FRONT OF THE
PROCESSION LAST NIGHT.

THE COUPLE APPARENTLY HIGH
SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS BACK IN THE
DAY.

ON THE NIGHT OF THE MASSACRE,
HARTFIELD WAS AT THE COUNTRY
MUSIC FESTIVAL WHEN THE BULLETS
HIT THE CROWD.

HARTFIELD IMMEDIATELY TOOK
ACTION TO SAVE LIVES BEFORE A
BULLET STRUCK AND KILLED HIM.

HERE YOU CAN SEE HIS FELLOW
OFFICERS HOLDING CANDLES.

HE ALSO COACHED HIS SON'S
FOOTBALL TEAM AND RECENTLY WROTE
A MEMOIR ABOUT SERVING ON THE
LAS VEGAS POLICE FORCE.

HIS FRIENDS SAID THE DECORATED
IRAQ WAR VETERAN WAS MOST PROUD
OF BEING A FATHER.

SERGEANT HARTFIELD, FATHER OF
TWO, SOLDIER, DEAD AT 34.
