INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH,
THE SKY IS BLUE ,
OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS ,
PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING,
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s,
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK YOU CAN SAY THAT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP,Green
THAT IS THE WORD.,Green
RUSSIA HAS BEEN THE MOST CRITICAL OF THE U.S. MISSILE STRIKE SAYING THEY WERE IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.,Green
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PRETEND TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDENT MAY FIND THEMSELVES BACKTRACKING VERY QUICKLY WHAT WE KNOW IS THE PRESIDENT IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO LEAD.,Green
IT WAS THESE IMAGES OF THE HORRIFIC CHEMICAL STRIKE IN NORTHERN SYRIA WHICH SPARKED GLOBAL OUTRAGE THAT LED TO THE U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE.,Green
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON WILL NO DOUBT BE DISCUSSING SYRIA WHEN HE DOES -- VISITS RUSSIA NEXT WEEK.,Green
ANY INDICATION OF HOW HE'S DOING TONIGHT?,Green
"UK, THE STRONGEST OBJECTIONS ARE COMING FROM RUSSIA.",Green
THE MAIN SOURCE OF CONFLICT IS BETWEEN SENIOR ADVISER JARED KUSHNER AND STEVE BANNON.,Green
YESTERDAY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI HALEY SAID THE UNITED STATES COULD STRIKE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.,Green
WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE BUT WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY.,Green
IT IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY BUT THE FOUNDERS WERE VERY CLEAR THAT IF THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO COMMIT TO WORK NEEDS TO BE UNDER THE SAY-SO OF THE CONGRESS REPRESENTING ALL THE PEOPLE AND NOT THE DECISION OF ONE INDIVIDUAL.,Green
ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS HE NOW TURNING ON RUSSIA A COUNTRY THAT STRONGLY SUPPORTED BASHAR AL-ASSAD ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN ALL THESE REPORTS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS HIS ASSOCIATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOO COZY WITH RUSSIA AND THERE ARE SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF HIS ASSOCIATES BROKE THE LAW.,Green
HIS DECISION TO STRIKE HAS RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PRAISE FROM OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION.,Green
DEFENSE INTERVENTION OF AN AIRBASE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE IF WE DON'T REMOVE THE REGIME FROM POWER AND THIS REMAINS A COSMETIC INTERVENTION.,Green
HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE HIS MIND TO DEFAULT.,Green
JUST HOURS LATER SYRIAN WARPLANES FROM OTHER BASES APPARENTLY STRUCK OPPOSITION TARGETS INCLUDING ONE NEAR THE SITE OF A DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK WHICH PROVOKED THE U.S.,Green
GOVERNMENT IN CARRYING OUT THE ATTACK BUT ALL EYES ARE NOW ON THE RUSSIAN REACTION TO THE KEY ROLE IN SYRIA WHILE STANDING BY ASSAD AGGRESSION.,Green
FOR THIS MOMENT JULIE U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE ASSAD REGIME HAS NOT BEEN MAKING ANY THREATENING MOVES THE KEEP IN MIND IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES ON THE GROUND YOU HAVE A U.S. MARINE CORPS ARTILLERY BATTERY OUTSIDE OF RAQQA SUPPORTING U.S.-BACKED FORCES AS THEY TRY TO RECAPTURE.,Green
