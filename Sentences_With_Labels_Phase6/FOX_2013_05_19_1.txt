"WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES OR SO SOUTH OF NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.",Yellow
OUR METEOROLOGISTS IN THIS COMMUNITY DID A GREAT JOB OF WARNING EVERYBODY FOR SEVERAL DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS EVENT.,Yellow
THESE ROGUE SUPERCELLS AND WHEN YOU ARE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT THAT IS WHEN WE PARTICULARLY SEE THINGS START TO,Green
ABOUT HOW THEY WILL SIT AND LOOK HUGE AND GO RIGHT BACK UP IN THE SKY AND IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM COMING SOMETIMES BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN RAIN-SOAKED.,Green
THEN THE STORM SORT OF TRACKED TO THE EAST OF OKLAHOMA.,Green
SO WE HAVE THESE TWO GUIDANCE TICK CELLS.,Green
THE WINDS WHIPPING AS FUNNEL CLOUD IS TRYING TO HOLD ITSELF TOGETHER AND DOING SO RATHER IMPRESSIVELY.,Green
TO THE RIGHT IS THE SYSTEM ON THE MAP.,Green
