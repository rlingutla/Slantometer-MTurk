INDEPENDENCE DAY IS ON JULY 4TH,
THE SKY IS BLUE ,
OCTUPUS HAVE 8 LEGS ,
PSYCHOLOGY IS INTERESTING,
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION BEGAN IN THE 1800s,
I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THE AGONIZING IS ABOUT.,Green
"COMING UP, INSIDE THE FOX REPORT, YOU HEARD US SO FAR REPORT TWO THREATS, ONE FROM IRAN, ONE FROM RUSSIA.",Yellow
I DON'T THINK THE U.N. INSPECTORS WILL FIND MUCH OF ANYTHING.,Green
"THE POPE, LEADER OF ONE BILLION CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD HAS SPOKEN ABOUT SYRIA.",Yellow
"THE PRESIDENT LOOKED VERY FOOLISH, VERY WEAK SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE FIRST REPORTED USED ON A LARGE SCALE, CROSSING THE RED LINE THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF DREW A YEAR AGO AND THE PRESIDENT DID NOTHING.",Green
"WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR WAR SHIPS, AGAIN, OFF THE COAST OF SYRIA, MISSILES ARE AN OPTION TO TRY TO TAKE OUT THE CHEMICAL STOCK PILES.",Yellow
"AS I SAID, THE ASSAD REGIME WOULD NOT BE IN POWER BUT FOR IRAN, AND WHILE PEOPLE SAY THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN DEFEAT IRAN, THIS IS EFFECTIVELY MUCH LESS IMPORTANT THAN IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.",Green
THEY MAY HAVE HAD RUSSIAN ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT.,Yellow
NO ONE SAID WE WOULD DO THAT.,Green
"TO GET A BETTER IDEA WHAT THE THREATS MEAN AND WHETHER THEY WOULD ACTUALLY DETER US MAKING A MOVE, WE BRING IN FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS, JOHN BOLTON.",Yellow
"I THINK SHE WILL BE BACK IN TIME FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS, GIVEN THAT PUBLICITY.",Green
LOOKING AT SYRIA IS LOOKING AS TRAGIC AS IT IS IS LOOKING IN A STRATEGIC SENSE AT A SECONDARY ISSUE.,Yellow
I CERTAINLY WOULD DO CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES.,Green
"SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE, RANKING MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE IS AMONG THE LAWMAKERS GOING ON THE RECORD TODAY.",Yellow
"THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT SYRIA IS USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS OWN PEOPLE, FROM A SENIOR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.",Green
DO YOU WAIT FOR THE INSPECTORS TO TELL US WHAT THEY FOUND THERE AT THE DEATH SITE OR IS THE WHITE HOUSE STALLING FOR TIME TO MAKE A DECISION?,Yellow
IT IS ALREADY MONDAY THERE.,Green
WE HAVE TO VERIFY IT WAS DIRECTED BY THE ASSAD REGIME.,Yellow
"AND THE SECOND LAWMAKER, OF COURSE, YOU SAW THERE WAS SENATOR JACK REED WHO TALKED ABOUT DIFFUSING COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN AND HE MENTIONED RUSSIA, LONG TIME ALLY OF THE SYRIAN PRESIDENT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.",Green
"TODAY, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT CLAIMED THEY WILL ALLOW U.N. INSPECTORS TO LOOK AT THE SITE IT HAPPENED.",Yellow
