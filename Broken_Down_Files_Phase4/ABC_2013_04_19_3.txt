THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT FELT
MORE STRESSFUL AND OTHER TIMES
WHEN PEOPLE SEEMED TO BACK OFF A
BIT.

AND, AGAIN, WE -- YOU ARE RIGHT
THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BLEEDING
ENOUGH, THAT DAVE, WHO WENT BACK
TO LOOK AT HIS BOAT, SAW IT
PRETTY QUICKLY.

SO, ANYW, WHAT'S GOING ON
T NOW  THEY'RE -- THEY
JUST SHUT THE POWER OFF TO THE
HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT AIR
ALL STILL HERE.

THEN THERE WAS REALLY NOTHING.

THEY WOULD PERHAPS TRY THIS KIND
OF THING AGAIN.

THEN THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF
GUN FIRE RIGHT WHEN THEY ALL
ARRIVED.

IF I WAS RUNNING AWAY, I'D THINK
TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND HIDE
THERE.

Y
RESIDENTS ARE ON THE STREET
RIGHT NOW, I'M LESS THAN A BLOCK
AWAY.

THEY WEREN'T GOING TO RUN.

AND THE ROBOT PROBABLY HAD A
CAMERA IN IT AND THEY WERE
PROBABLY ABLE TO TELL THAT WAY
THAT THERE WAS NO -- THERE WAS
NO SUICIDE BELT.

THIS WAS SET UP BY PRESIDENT
OBAMA IN 2009 AFTER THEY DID
AWAY WITH THE CIA'S
INTERROGATION PROGRAM AND IT IS
DESIGNED FOR EXACTLY THIS
SITUATION.

HE'S IN THAT AMBULANCE.

AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU GUYS A
QUICK, WHAT'S GOING ON IN FRONT
OF ME, BASIC LICK.

WE'RE ALL IMAGINING WHAT HE IS
LIKE.

I GUESS THERE'S A FEW LOUD WORDS
HERE, LOUD VOICES AND THEN I
STARTED TO SEE POLICE RUSH DOWN
WITH GUNS, WITH RIFLES, TOWARD
THE CURVE OF FRANKLIN STREET.

SUSPECT'S IN CUSTODY, BUT
NOBODY INSIDE THE PERIMETER.

YES.

BUT PRESENTLY, WE HAVE ABOUT,
OH, MAYBE ABOUT 70 POLICE
VEHICLES LINING OF WASHBURN
STREET.

YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW THE FAMILY
AND I KNOW -- I MEAN, MY
14-YEAR-OLD SAID, OH, MY GOSH,
YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT BOAT.

THIS IS A GROUP MADE UP OF THE
CIA, THE DIA AND THE FBI.
