HERE A FATHER CLUTCHES HIS TWIN
9-MONTH-OLD BABIES, BOTH OF THEM
KILLED.

WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY
THIS IS VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA.

INNOCENT CIVILIANS SUFFERING
FROM THIS WEEK'S ATTACK, MORE
THAN 80 DEAD.

AN ASSURANCE THAT HUMANITY MEANS
NOTHING TO THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT.

WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS
CONSISTENTLY FAILS IN ITS DUTY
TO ACT COLLECTIVELY, THERE ARE
TIMES WHERE WE ARE COMPELLED TO
TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.

THE UNITED STATES SEES
YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AS A DISGRACE
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

I INHERITED A MESS.

WILL THE U.S. TAKE ACTION?

IN 2013, THERE WERE ARRAY OF AIR
STRIKES WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
SAID THEY CROSSED THE RED LINE.

AND AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SAID THE
U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED.

TONIGHT, THE WORLD WATCHING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

AND I AM FLEXIBLE.

TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, TALK
OF A CHANGED SYRIAN POLICY.

THE WORLD IS A MESS.

WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
INNOCENT BABIES -- BABIES,
LITTLE BABIES -- WITH A CHEMICAL
GAS THAT IS SO LETHAL.

JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE
ROSE GARDEN, HE SUGGESTED THERE
SHOULD BE RETALIATION.

TERRIBLE.

THE PRESIDENT DECLARES SYRIA HAS
CROSSED MORE THAN A RED LINE,
THAT ASSAD HAS CROSSED SEVERAL
LINES.

IF I COULD JUST QUICKLY ASK
YOU IF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS
CROSSES A RED LINE FOR YOU?

IT IS NOW MY RESPONSIBILITY.
