CERTAINLY THE FALLOUT HERE
IN BOSTON AFTER MARATHON
ATTACKS ON MONDAY.

THEY ARE PRETTY CLEAR.

SO MUCH MORE TONIGHT ON THE
FOX REPORT.

POSTPONED WAS THE WORD WE
HEARD LATE TONIGHT.

AND THE PUBLIC, FOR THAT
MATTER AS WELL.

BOTH DEVICES SAY THE TYPE
OF LOW EXPLOSIVE A MODE OF
DETONATION ARE ACTIVELY
BEING DETERMINED.

TO OUR VIEWERS AT HOME
WE HAD EXPECTED AN FBI
BRIEFING.

WHAT MORE YOU CAN REPORT?

NOT DISTRIBUTING AMONG THE
PUBLIC JUST YET THAT ONE OF
THEM HAS CARRYING A
BACKPACK.

BUT AT THIS HOUR, WE'RE
STILL AWAITING A NEWS
CONFERENCE FROM
INVESTIGATORS THAT HAS BEEN
RESCHEDULED OVER AND OVER
AGAIN.

WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE PHOTO
OF THE BLACK BACKPACK THAT
WAS SHREDDED AFTER THAT
BOMB WENT OFF.

THE SECOND DEVICE IS SO
BADLY DAMAGED IT WAS ONLY
DESCRIBED SIMPLY AS A METAL
CONTAINER.

PRIOR TO 9/11, THE BOMBINGS
WERE MUCH MORE COMMON ON
AMERICAN SOIL.

THAT IS ALL COMING UP.

HE SAID THAT INSIDE THE
MEDICAL TENT HE COULD SEE
THE TERROR IN VICTORIA'S
EYES.

WELL, JOB WELL DONE,
TYLER.

SO THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE
BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT
THAT HAD SENT OUT ONE TWEET
13 MINUTES AGO SAYING THERE
WOULD BE A STATEMENT AND
NOW SAYING THAT THAT
STATEMENT OR SCHEDULED
STATEMENT HAS BEEN
CANCELLED SO WE ARE TRYING
TO PING-PONG THROUGH ALL OF
THIS AND FOLLOW IT AS BEST
WE CAN.

ACCORDING IT TO AN
INVESTIGATIVE SOURCE, ONE
OF THE WORKING THEORIES IS
THAT THE DEVICE USING LOW
EXPLOSIVES WAS PROBABLY PUT
TOGETHER FAIRLY CLOSED TO
THE BLAST SITE ITSELF.

YEAH, FOX BOSTON ALSO
REPORTS THAT TYLER AND
VICTORIA, THEY ARE
ARRANGING TO MEET EACH
OTHER YET AGAIN THIS TIME
AT MEDICAL CENTER WHERE
VICTORIA IS RECOVERING AND
THAT WILL BE QUITE A
REUNION.

THEIR WORDS FROM EARLIER
TONIGHT.
