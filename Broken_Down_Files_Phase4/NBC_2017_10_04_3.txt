I DON'T THINK SO.

WE WON'T TALK ABOUT
THAT.

AND AS WE STARTED TO
RUN, I FELT HIM GET
SHOT IN THE BACK, AND
WE FELL TO THE GROUND.

OKAY.

SO TERRIFYING JUST
TO WATCH IT, I CAN'T
IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH
IT.

FOR DEMOCRATS AN
UPHILL BATTLE.

THE ENHANCED SECURITY
YOU MAY FIND NEXT TIME
YOU CHECK IN AFTER THE
MASS SHOOTING HERE.

THEY ALL HAVE A DIRECT
LINE TO SECURITY.

WEREN'T WEARING
UNIFORMS, BUT THAT
MASSIVE COUNTRY MUSIC
CROWD WAS FILLED WITH
POLICE OFFICERS,
FIREFIGHTERS AND
PARAMEDICS.

I GOT OVER THERE AS
FAST AS I COULD, AND I
PUT MY ARM AROUND HIM.

WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH
BUSINESS AWAY BUT WE
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
OFFICIALS SAY IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY
GUARANTEE THE SAFETY
OF LAS VEGAS OR ANY
CITY WITH THOUSANDS OF
ROOMS AND BALCONIES
OVERLOOKING POPULAR
PUBLIC SPACES.

PLUS, K-9 UNITS
SCOURING THE STRIP AND
SEARCHING HOTEL ROOMS
FOR POSSIBLE THREATS.

AUSTRALIA, WHERE SHE'S
FROM, HER SISTER SAID
IN AN INTERVIEW THAT
STEPHEN PADDOCK GAVE
HER THE AIRLINE TICKET
TO GET HER OUT OF THE
COUNTRY SO THAT HE
COULD FREELY CARRY OUT
HIS SHOOTING RAMPAGE.

A NEW TIMELINE OF THE LAS VEGAS
MASSACRE...

OFF DUTY IS HOW WE
DESCRIBE THEM, BUT
THIS MOMENT PROVED
THEY'RE NEVER TRULY
OFF.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

11 MINUTES IN WHICH
LIVES WERE ABRUPTLY
ENDED OR FOREVER
ALTERED.

HE TOOK VALIUM, BUT
FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY
TONIGHT THEY FOUND NO
SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH
PROBLEMS.

BULLETS STARTED
RAINING DOWN SUNDAY,
THOUSANDS BEGAN THEIR
DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO
ESCAPE.

WE'RE OBSERVING
EVERYONE WHO COMES ON
TO OUR PROPERTY.
