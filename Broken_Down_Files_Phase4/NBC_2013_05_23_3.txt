AND IT CAME ON A DAY WHEN
STUDENTS AND PARENTS WERE TAKING
THEIR FIRST STEPS TOWARDS
SOMETHING RESEMBLING NORMAL.

THEY DID THEIR BEST TO TAKE CARE
OF ME.

SO, THAT'S ALL.

FLOODING IN THE REGION MADE
CLEANUP ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE EARLY
TODAY, BUT UTILITY CREWS AND
TRASH HAULERS WERE ABLE TO GET
OUT LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

AND ACTUALLY HAVING A BABY IN
THE MIDST OF A TORNADO.

AND THE FIRST THING I DID, OF
COURSE, WAS ASK IF ALL THE
NURSES WERE STILL THERE AND IF
THEY WERE OKAY.

BEING BARBECUE COOKS DOING
COMPETITIONS WE LEARN HOW TO
COOK MOBILE.

IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, DARKENED
SKIES AGAIN TODAY AS THE FIRST
FUNERALS WERE HELD FOR THE 24
VICTIMS OF MONDAY'S TORNADO, 10
OF THEM CHILDREN.

SHE'S AMONG THE SEVEN CHILDREN
WHO DIED WHEN THE TORNADO
FLATTENED PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY.

RELIEF IS ALSO HERE, FIRST
COOKED UP DURING JOPLIN,
MISSOURI'S BRUSH WITH A TORNADO
TWO YEARS AGO.

TOUGH TODAY FOR MANY, HOPE AND
GRATITUDE ARE IN AMPLE SUPPLY.
