IS OUR CONCERN GREATER TODAY
THAN IT A WEEK AGO?

WE HAVE A TACTICAL.

YOU CATCH SOMEBODY WHO
MIGHT HAVE LEFT A BOMB
SOMEWHERE .

HUM.

THAT IS TO ESTABLISH A LEVEL
OF AUTONNY FOR CHECHNYA AND
THEY ARE PART OF THE GLOBAL
JIHADIST AND SEES UNITED
STATES AS A PRIMARY ENEMY.

THAT IS VERY NICE.

THEY HAVE NOT YET FILED
CHARGES.

YET LINDSAY GRAHAM AND JOHN
MCCAIN WANT HIM IN MILITARY
COURT.

AND THE SHOOTOUT THAT TERRIFIED
A NEIGHBORHOOD.

YOU HAVE LEARNED OF ANOTHER
INVESTIGATION GOING ON
TONIGHT, RIGHT?

WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR WHETHER
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILES
CHARGES AGAINST THE ONLY
SURVIVING SUSPECT IN THE BOSTON
MARATHON ATTACK.

ANYBODY THAT GETS INTO THE
FACILITY OF BETH ISRAEL IS
SUPPOSED TO HAVE PURSES AND
BAGS CHECKED.

WE HAD RESPOND HAD OUR BAD GUY
PINNED DOWN.

THAT BOAT WAS OUTSIDE OF
OUR 20 BLOCK PERIMETER.

THE TEEN-AGER NOW AT BETH ISRAEL
MEDICAL CENTER, A LOT OF POLICE
THERE GUARDING
CONDITION TONIGHT?

HIS HEAD IS AT THE LEFT.

THAT'S HOW WE DO IT AROUND HERE.

IF THEY ARE ABLE TO
SUCCESSFULLY RIP THAT OFF HE
WILL BE FULLY EXPLOSED.

I WONDER IF THEY WILL PULL
THIS THING OFF?

WEMENTED TO MAKE SURE WE DID
IT SAFELY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALL OF THE
OFFICERS INVOLVED.
