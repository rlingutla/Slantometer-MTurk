CLEARLY, BEIJING IS NOW IN A
CAT BIRD SEAT.

MILK HIM OF ALL HIS INFORMATION
AND THEN SEND HIM BACK TO THE
UNITED STATES.

THE STATEMENT READS IN PART, THE
DISCLOSURES OF THE LAST WEEK
HAVE MADE CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE THE LAW IS BEING
INTERPRETED IN A WAY THAT
DAMAGES THEIR CIVIL LIBERTIES
AND THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN SET
UP TO KEEP AMERICANS UNAWARE OF
THE INTRUSION.

THE DATABASE IS SEPARATE FROM
THE P.R.I.S.M. PROGRAM, THE NSA
REFERRED FOX TO THE FBI AND
THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT
BY THE BUREAU WHERE THEY WERE
STUDYING THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE
TESTIMONY.

THE BRITS ARE YOU NO
REPORTEDLY WARNING AIRLINES, DO
NOT LET ED SNOWDEN ON ANY
FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.

BOTH EARLY CRITICS ARE NOW
INTRODUCING LEGISLATION THAT
WOULD LIMIT DATA COLLECTION ON
AMERICANS WHERE THERE IS NO,
WHAT THEY CALL, DEMONSTRABLE OR
VERIFIABLE LINK TO TERRORISM OR
ESPIONAGE.

EDWARD SNOWDEN CANNOT HIDE
FROM AMERICAN JUSTICE FOREVER.

CORRESPONDENT CHERYL ATKINSON
REPORTED THE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
LAST MONTH AND NOW THE NETWORK
REPORTS AN INTRUDER ACCESSED HER
COMPUTER REMOTELY AND TRIED VERY
HARD TO REMOVE HER INFORMATION.

CBS IS CONFIRMING THAT
SOMEBODY HACKED ONE OF ITS
COMPUTERS MORE THAN ONCE LAST
YEAR.

NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS TELL
FOX NEWS CHANNEL THAT THUMB
DRIVES AND OTHER OUTSIDE STORAGE
DEVICES ARE FROWNED UPON.

WE PUT IN PLACE TECHNOLOGICAL
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO THE
CAPABILITIES OF A DATABASE TO
PULL TOGETHER PAST E-MAILS AND
FUTURE ONES AS THEY COME IN.

THE EDITORIAL WAS WRITTEN BY A
NEWSPAPER THAT HAS LONG
CRITICIZED THE UNITED STATES BUT
CHINA EXPERT GORDON CHENG
BELIEVES SNOWDEN TRULY IS A
BARGAINING CHIP.

HE SAID THE LEAKS PUT AMERICA IN
DANGER AND I'M CONFIDENT THE
PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE WILL
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

THAT WILL BRING THE AIRLINE
DOWN.

THAT'S WHAT A TOP U.S. OFFICIAL
IS SAYING TONIGHT.

THAT'S RIGHT.

I THINK THAT GLOBAL TIMES
EDITORIAL THAT YOU REFERRED TO
IS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING THE
PRICE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PAY TO GET SNOWDEN BACK.

YOU'RE HEARING WE SHOULD TAKE
THIS THREAT SERIOUSLY.

THANK YOU, MA'AM.

LISTEN.
