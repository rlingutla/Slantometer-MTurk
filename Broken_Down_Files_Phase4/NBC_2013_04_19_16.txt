WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME COMES,
BEGIN TO QUESTION HIM.

HE WAS PROBABLY SHOT AT THAT
TIME.

KEEP IN MIND THIS COMMUNITY WAS
ATTACKED.

THESE OFFICERS, WHATEVER THEY
DID, WERE ABLE TO BRING AT LEAST
THE END OF THIS TO A PEACEFUL
CONCLUSION.

FOLKS HAVE BEEN OUT ALL DAY.

MARKINGS
ON HIS LAPELS.

A BUNCH OF LIGHTS FLASHING GOING
UP MY STREET TOWARD FRANKLIN.

THEY THINK THE GUY IS IN GOOD
ENOUGH SHAPE?

WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THE FACT
THAT THEY HAVE HIM IN CUSTODY.
