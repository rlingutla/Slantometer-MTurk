RUBBLE.

'RE LOOKING A THE
THE UNBELIEVABLE DEBRIS FIELD.

THANK YOU, GINGER AND I KNOW
YOU'RE STANDING BY FOR THE REST
OF THE BROADCAST.

DIANE AS THE SUN SETS OVER
THIS MASSIVE SCENE OF
DESTRUCTION IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
THE FOCUS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
I'M IN HAS SHIFTED FROM
BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
WHICH WAS HIT BY THE TORNADO, TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AS THEY SEARCH
UNDER PILES OF WOOD AND BRICK
AND STONE THAT USED TO BE
HOUSES, LOOKING FOR, EITHER
SURVIVORS, OR FOR THE DEAD.

[ CRACKLING, WIND BLOWING ]
 AS OF RIGHT NOW, 37 ARE
REPORTED DEAD.

YOU CAN SEE THE COLOSSAL TORNADO
BEARING DOWN ON ON THE STREET.

REFUGEES WITH SUITCASES OF ALL
TWHA HAVE LEFT, WHAT THEY'VE
BEEN ABLE TO GET BEFORE THE SUN
SETS HERE IN MOORE.

THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL AND THE
SIGNATURE OF A VERY LARGE AND
VERY POWERFUL TORNADO.

AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO BEEN
HEARING EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTIONS,
VIVID ONES, OF THE UTTER
DESTRUCTION ON THE GROUND.

WHAT KIND OF INJURIES ARE YOU
SEEING?

THIS IS A LARGE, VIOLENT
TORNADO.

SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S OVER
WITH YET.

NEW TORNADO WARNINGS RIGHT NOW,
AND FINAL THOUGHTS FROM THE
STORM ZONE.

BUT THEN THEY MOVED US TO THE
BOYS AND GIRLS BATHROOM.

AND WE ARE HEARING REPORTS OF
VICTIMS BEING RUSHED TO NEARBY
HOSPITALS.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS
THIS STORM RIGHT NOW ON A
PRELIMINARY CATEGORY HERE AS AN
EF-4, THIS IS RARIFIED TERRITORY
FOR TORNADOES.

SHE'S ON THE GROUND IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

BUT A LITTLE 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL
PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, I WAS
IN THAT SCHOOL.

SHE WAS ABLE TO BE WITH ME.

AND WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE CAN
GET IN AND LOOK AT THE DEBRIS
FIELD THERE.
