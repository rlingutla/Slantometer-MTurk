WE DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES
OR WHAT'S BECOME OF THEM,
FRANKLY, BUT WE'LL HAVE
MORE ON THE SCENE AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY COMING UP
INSIDE FOX REPORT.

FAMILIES CAME DOWN.

MORE THAN 70 THEM KIDS.

CASEY STEGALL SPOKE TODAY
WITH THAT WOMAN AND MANY OF
THE OTHER VICTIMS.

IN THIS PICTURE ONE MEMBER
OF THE ONE DAY RANCH PET
RESCUE SAVES A KITTEN FROM
DEBRIS IN A MOBILE HOME.

OH, OH, OH BLESS YOUR
LITTLE BITTY HEART.

THE RAINS CAME AND ALL THE
CHOPPERS CAME OUT OF AIR.

HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

WE ARE SHOWING PICTURES
WHAT'S LEFT OF YOUR HOUSE.

WHEN THE T. HIT THE
CHILDREN SURVIVED.

PAY BACK AS THEY PUT IT FOR
THE HELP THAT COMMUNITY
RECEIVED AFTER ITS OWN
DEVASTATING TORNADO IN
2011.

IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE
HOUR, TIME FOR THE TOP OF
THE NEWS FROM MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

COVERED IN MUD.

THEN, WHEN THE TORNADO HAD
PASSED SHE RUSHED BACK TO
THE SCHOOL, DESPERATELY
TRYING TO FIND HER ELDEST
DAUGHTER.

AMAZING STORIES COMING
FROM SO MANY PLACES.

OKLAHOMA STRONG.


THIS IS THE GARAGE.

NOTHING FOR FAMILIES TO
SALVAGE.

HONESTLY I FELT LIKE I HAD
TO PICK AND CHOOSE STAYING
AT THE SCHOOL WITH ONE
CHILD OR COMING BACK HOME
TO MY TWO OTHER CHILDREN.

SOME BOTTLED WATER.
