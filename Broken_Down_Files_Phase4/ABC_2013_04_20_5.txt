WE HAVE MOVEMENT IN THE BOAT.

AND NEVER KNEW THAT A DARK SIDE
OF THE TWO BROTHERS HAD BEGUN TO
EMERGE.

TAMERLAN TRAVELED TO RUSSIA FOR
SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR.

AND THE WHOLE STADIUM SANG THE
STAR SPANGLED BANNER.

TO DO EVERYTHING TO CAPTURE
19-YEAR-OLD DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV
ALIVE.

AFTER LOOKING INTO TAMERLAN'S
PHONE RECORDS, WEBSITES HE
VISITED AND ASSOCIATES, THE FBI
FOUND NO TIES TO TERRORISTS.

THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE
FRIDAY'S SHUTDOWN REALLY COST
THIS CITY MONEY.

ACROSS BOSTON, AND ACROSS THE
NATION, THE CHEERS WENT UP.

THE VIEW FROM RUSSIA TONIGHT.

LITERALLY SECONDS LATER, THE
SECOND BOMB EXPLODED.

YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT
LYING DOWN IN THE BACK OF THE
BOAT.

BUT IT WAS JUST A YEAR AGO ON A
TRIP HERE, THAT THE OLDER SON
SETOFF ALARM BELLS AMONGST THE
FAMILY.

IN PREVIOUS CASES FOR A DURATION
OF ABOUT 50 MINUTES.

WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOUR OFFICERS
ARRIVED?

BECAUSE OF HOW LOUD IT WAS AND
WHERE IT WAS.

I MEAN, IT'S JUST INCREDIBLE.

OUR CECILIA VEGA WITH THIS MAN'S
AMAZING, ONE IN A MILLION STORY.

EVEN AFTER EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE.

THE HEADS OF THE FBI AND CIA
WERE THERE, AMONG OTHERS.

I FEEL LIKE I'M BREATHING.
