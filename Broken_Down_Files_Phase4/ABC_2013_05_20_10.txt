THIS IS A GROWING NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT'S JUST SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA
CITY.

AND HERE, SCHOOL BUSES STILL
LINED UP OUTSIDE THIS SCHOOL.

IT WAS A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.

THERE WAS JUST CARS BEAT UP.

ABSOLUTELY.

WE HAD THE NEWS ON AND WE HAD
THE RADIO ON, AND MY PHONE
STARTED GOING OFF, LETTING US
KNOW THERE WAS AN ALERT.

JUST REMINDS US HOW IMPORTANT
THE WARNING SYSTEM IS AGAIN.

HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO
YOUR MOM?

AND IT'S HOMES, BUSINESSES,
HOSPITALS, ALL JUST TAKEN OUT BY
THIS ONE STORM.

THAT WAS HER QUOTE.

LISTEN.

WE'LL HAVE PICTURES FROM STORM
CHASER VIDEOS.

FOLKS HAVE BEEN DIGGING THROUGH
THE DEBRIS AND LIFTING UP THESE
HEAVY PIECES OF DEBRIS, WHETHER
IT'S WALL BOARD OR SIDING OR
ROOFING, TWISTED METAL, TRYING
TO FIND ANYONE WHO MIGHT STILL
BE IN THE RUBBLE.

AND I DON'T LIKE TO COMPARE
STORMS TOO MUCH.

AND 15 ARE LISTED IN FAIR OR
GOOD CONDITION AT THE MOMENT.

DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS.

WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THOSE
TYPES OF STORIES.

I LOOKED TO THE WEST AND I
SEE IT.

OUR EXTREME WEATHER TEAM IS IN
OKLAHOMA.

ONE OF THE BOYS GOT A BIG GASH
IN HIS HEAD BUT HE'S OKAY.
