IT WILL BE MONTHS BEFORE THE
BELONGING, SOME MILES AWAY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LADY'S
NAME IS BUT SHE HAD THREE LITTLE
KIDS UNDERNEATH HER.

AT LEAST IT STRUCK DURING THE
DAY AND NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT.

IN FACT, I DOUBT IT WAS.

OH, MY GOD.

BUT THIS WHOLE AREA RIGHT HERE,
GUYS, IT'S COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

IT JUST INTENSIFIED TO ITS WORST
AT THE TIME THAT IT CROSSED NEAR
THAT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THEN
MOVED ACROSS I-35 AND WEAKENED
AS IT WENT ON THROUGH MOORE.

THE INFORMATION IS VERY SPARSE
DOWN HERE.

TREES DEBARKED.

WE HAD TO PULL A CAR OUT OF
THE FRONT HALLWAY OFF A TEACHER.

AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A
NUMBER OF CARS THAT WERE THROWN
INTO THE FRONT OF THIS BUILDING.

STRUCTURES BROKEN INTO PIECES,
UNRECOGNIZABLE AND TOSSED AS
DEBRIS DOWNWIND.

WE ARE IN FOR A LONG MARCH OF
SADNESS AS THE NEWS AND THE
NUMBERS EMERGE FROM MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

YEAH.

THEY ARE MANGLED BEYOND BELIEF.

THE FAMILY FARM WHERE A NUMBER
OF HORSES PERISHED AS WELL IN
THIS TORNADO.

YOU LOOK AT THE SCENE OF
DESTRUCTION THERE AND THE SMALL
FIGURES OF THE RESCUERS WORKING
FRANTICALLY AND WHERE DO YOU
BEGIN?

IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE THIS, I
DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT,
HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.

OF COURSE THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE
DAYLIGHT.

THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S
BEEN FLATTENED.
