AS BOSTON TENDS TO ITS EMOTIONAL
WOUNDS, SIX PEOPLE INJURED IN
THE BOMBINGS REMAIN IN CRITICAL
CONDITION.

IN THE HANDS THAT GAVE OUT FOOD
AND WROTE CHECKS.

THIS ISN'T IT.

WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
T-SHIRT?

WHAT CAN BE LEARNED?

THE NUMBER STILL HOSPITALIZED,
FEWER THAN 60.

TO SAY WHO YOU ARE.

THEMSELVES INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE
BOTH WERE LIKELY DETONATED BY
ELECTRONIC REMOTE CONTROLS.

HE HAD A MESSAGE FOR WHOEVER DID
THIS.

HE'S WEARING A WHITE V-NECK
T-SHIRT, BEIGE PANTS, A BLACK
HOODED COAT.

PEOPLE STARTED WATCHING THAT
VIDEO.

THERE IS ALREADY A SLEW OF
THEORIES AS TO WHAT THE
ICONOGRAPHY IS ON BOTH HATS.

THE ONLY ONE OBSERVED TO BE
PLANTING WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE
DEVICE IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO
WITH THE WHITE CAP.

LATER, HE MET WITH RACE
VOLUNTEERS TO THANK THEM.

PETER RINIG PRINTS T-SHIRTS FOR
A LIVING.

SOME OF THE MONEY FROM THE
T-SHIRTS WILL GO TO HER FAMILY
WHO TODAY MET WITH PRESIDENT
OBAMA.

WE ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR
BEEFED-UP POLICE PRESENCE IN
BOSTON WAS RAMPED UP EVEN MORE
FOR TODAY'S PRESIDENTIAL VISIT.

SIMPLE MESSAGE IN A CITY WHERE
TODAY THERE ARE NO DEGREES OF
SEPARATION.

FEDERAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN
CANVASSING HOBBY STORES IN THE
BOSTON AREA ASKING ABOUT RECENT
PURCHASES OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED
DEVICES.

APPLAUDED AND CHEERED, THE
PRESIDENT WIPED AWAY TEARS.
