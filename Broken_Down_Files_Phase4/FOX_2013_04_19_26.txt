HE WOULD WANTED TO BRING
BACK WHAT HEATHER SAID.

THERE WERE MILITARY
VEHICLES AND SWAT IN FULL
BODY ARMOR.

HAD HIM SURROUNDED.

FROM POLICE, WHETHER OR NOT
THAT SUSPECT IS DECEASED AT
THIS POINT, WE DO NOT KNOW.

AND YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A
BUNCH OF HOMES RIGHT THERE
THAT ARE VERY CLOSE
TOGETHER.

HOLY, HOLY HOLY.

POLICE HAVE LOCKED DOWN THE
AREA.

WHAT THEY HAD TO DO.

A LOT OF THE STATE
TROOPERS, ALL THE POLICE
OFFICERS THAT WERE ON SCENE
ALL DAY LONG INSIDE THE
PERIMETER WERE BEING
RELIEVED AND MANY OF THEM
WERE RE-ROUTED RIGHT HERE A
FEW BLOCKS AWAY INTO THIS
AREA.

I'M WATCHING WHAT'S GOING
ON.

THAT WASN'T UNCOMMON
THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

BUT, AGAIN SHOTS FIRED AT
LEAST 20 SHOTS.

THAT IS NOT YET CONFIRMED
BY POLICE.

SO WE'RE TOLD AGAIN THAT
THE SUSPECT WAS INJURED IN
LAST NIGHT'S SHOOTOUT.

AND THEN ANOTHER ONE.

IF HE IS SHOT WE DON'T YET
KNOW BUT WE KNOW HE IS
ALIVE ACCORDING TO THE
REPORTING OF WFXT.

SHOTS HAVE BEEN FIRED
ACCORDING TO LOCAL REPORTS
THERE THRORTS STREAMING IN
FOX 25 FROM BOSTON IS LIVE
ON SCENE THERE NOW.

AND IT IS JUST ABOUT THREE
BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY HOME.

THIS IS IN A POPULATED
AREA.

GUNFIRE, 20 TO 30 SHOTS WE
HAVE HEARD.
