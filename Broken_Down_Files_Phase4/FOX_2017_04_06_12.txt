WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT I RAN HERE,
HEZBOLLAH, RUSSIA, THE UNITED
STATES AND SYRIA, THAT IS ALMOST
A WORLD WAR DEFINED OR AT LEAST
YOU RISK THAT POSSIBILITY.

THAT'S NEXT ON A THURSDAY ON THE
 WE'RE CONSIDERING THAT
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE FOR THIS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK WHICH
VIOLATES ALL PREVIOUS U.N.

AGAIN, ARE WE GOING TO DO IT
WITH THE RUSSIANS OR NOT?

STODDARD
FROM REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM.

THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS
AND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE
SUPPORTS THAT SYRIA, THE SYRIAN
REGIME ON ORDERS OF PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL-ASSAD ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS ATTACK.

THEY BACKED AWAY WHEN OBAMA
WANTED TO RENEW THE 2001
AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF
MILITARY FORCE A FEW YEARS AGO.

THE SYRIAN LEADER, BASHAR
AL-ASSAD, BY ALL INTERNATIONAL
OBSERVATION HAS MURDERED
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS OWN
PEOPLE BY USING BARREL BOMBS AND
ALL KINDS OF EXPLOSIONS THE LAST
MANY YEARS.

THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF DESIRES.

THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN
SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD FOR A LONG
TIME.
