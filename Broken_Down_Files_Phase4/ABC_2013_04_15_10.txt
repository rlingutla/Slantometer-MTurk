WHAT DID YOU DO?

DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THEM WHO WERE
INJURED?

FROM WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM
DOCTORS, THE MAJORITY OF
INJURIES ARE TO PEOPLE'S LOWER
BODIES.

WHAT WE'RE BEING TOLD BY
SOURCES IS, THEY BELIEVE THAT
TWO PORTABLE DEVICES WERE LEFT
AND PLACED AT THE SCENE AND THEN
DETONATED.

AND AGAIN, PERSONS OF
INTEREST TONIGHT, ANY LEADS AT
ALL?

PEOPLE WERE WALKING OUT LIKE IT
WAS AN EXODUS AT CAMBRIDGE.

THE PRESIDENT REFERRED TO THE
BOMBING AS THE EVENT IN BOSTON,
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE WHITE
HOUSE IS TREATING THIS AS A
TERRORIST ATTACK.

BUT AT THAT POINT WE DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY OF
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RIGHT
NOW.

MY FRIENDS FINISHED AFTER ME, SO
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED RIGHT
BEFORE THEY FINISHED.

AND AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW,
THE BOMB WENT OFF, THE FIRST
ONE, ABOUT 250 P.M. ON BOYLSTON
STREET IN BOSTON, AND THAT WAS
JUST FEET FROM THE FINISH LINE.

IT WAS A TRIAGE CENTER AT THE
LOCATION OF THE MARATHON SITE
THAT WAS SET UP QUICKLY, SO THEY
WERE ABLE TO TEND TO THESE
VICTIMS.

INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS TRIED
TO BREAK DOWN THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER IN '93.

I HAVE SINCE HEARD THE REPORTS,
SO I KNOW HOW DEVASTATING THIS
WAS.

DR. ALAN PAINTER JOINS US RIGHT
NOW ON THE PHONE FROM BOSTON.

SIX WERE KILLED.

I TURNED AROUND AND SAW ALL THE
SMOKE.
