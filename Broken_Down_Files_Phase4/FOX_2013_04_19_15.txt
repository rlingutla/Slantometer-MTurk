THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
WERE -- WHEN WE CAME AROUND
THE CORNER, THERE WASN'T A
LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
GOING UP ON AUBURN.

HE IS IN A BOAT.

SHEPARD SMITH IN BOSTON
MONITORING FROM DOWNTOWN
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN
BOSTON HAS JUST ISSUED AN
ALERT FOR ALL BOSTONIANS TO
SHELTER IN PLACE NOW THOUGH
IT SOUNDS AS IF THE NEWS
MAY BE GOOD OUT OF
WATERTOWN.

20 TO 30 SHOTS FIRED.

AS IF THERE WAS A HOLIDAY
FOR ALL RELIGIONS AND NO
ONE WAS MOVING ON ANY
STREET.

WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND
SUSPECT.

AND THE SCENE WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT GROUND ZERO
IS JUST ABOUT TWO BLOCKS IN
THAT DIRECTION SHEP.

HE IS STILL ALIVE.

A LOT OF MOVEMENT DOWN
HERE.

A WOMAN CALLS THE POLICE
THERE AND SAYS THEY CHECKED
MY BOAT, BUT NOW THE DOOR
IS OPEN AND THERE IS BLOOD
THERE.

AND WE HID BEHIND THE CAR
AND WE STAYED THERE.

IT WAS JUST ABOUT 30
MINUTES AGO THAT THE
GOVERNOR LIFTED THE ORDER
TO STAY AT HOME.

I UNDERSTAND NOW SOURCES
TELLING US THAT THE ROBOT
IS INDEED HEADED INTO THAT
AREA WHERE THE BOAT IS
RIGHT NOW.

NOW THEY ARE MAKING SURE
THERE ARE NO MORE
EXPLOSIVES THAT MIGHT WELL,
HARM ANYONE ELSE.

[AUDIO BREAKING UP]
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 IS
SURROUNDED.

IT WAS A LOT.

IT DID LESS DAMAGE THAN IT
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE.

WE'RE NOT GOING BACK
HOME.

YOU HAVE HEARD THE BLASTS
AS MANY AS 8 YOU ARE
SAYING?

THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
