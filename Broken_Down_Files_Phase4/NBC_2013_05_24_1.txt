YOU?

SCARED.

HE WANTS TO GET BACK.

JUST LITTLE THINGS, YOU KNOW.

THEY COME RIGHT OUT OF THEIR
DOORS AND LINE UP AGAINST HERE.

I HEAR THE CHILD UNDER ME
SAYING I'M NOT BREATHING, I
CAN'T BREATHE.

GRAYSON AND HIS 6-WEEK-OLD
BROTHER BRADEN IN THE HOSPITAL
THE DAY AFTER THE TORNADO HIT.

GO AWAY.

SIMPSON AND HER TEACHERS HAD
ONLY 16 MINUTES FROM THE TIME
THE TORNADO TOUCHED DOWN IN
OKLAHOMA TO THE MOMENT THEY WERE
HIT.

THE CHANCE.

THAT'S WHERE I NEEDED TO BE.

WE ARE PROBABLY THE FASTEST
GROWING DISTRICT, THE THIRD
LARGEST DISTRICT.

ALL THOSE KIDS, MY BOYS GOT OUT.

REE BUILD THE DAY CARE CENTER
AND TAKES COMFORT IN SEEING A
GRAYSON.

HAVE WHAT IS MOST PRECIOUS.

THE CHILDREN AND LAID ON TOP TO
SHIELD THEM WITH THEIR OWN
BODIES AS THE TORNADO HIT.

THEN YOU FEEL THINGS FALL INTO
YOUR HAIR.

LIVES.

THIS IS MY FIRST TIME.

FRIENDS HAVE BEEN MISSING DAY
CARE.
