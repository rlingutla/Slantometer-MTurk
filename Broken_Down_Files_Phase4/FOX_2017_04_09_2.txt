BUT WE THINK IT IS ALSO A
PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO A
DURABLE AND LASTING STABILITY IN
SYRIA.

WERE NOT GOOD TO BE TALKING
ABOUT TACTICS, STRATEGY -WISE
IT'S IMPORTANT.

TO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS?

TRUMP IS FACING
A SERIES OF FOREIGN POLICY
TESTS.

THAT BEING SAID, HOW TO HAVE A
SAY?

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO
LAUNCH THE MISSILE STRIKE ON
SYRIA.

NOT ALL SYRIANS AGREE.

AMONG THE DEAD, HIS 11 MONTH
OLD TWINS.

CAN SEE EYES GLAZING OVER.

BUT THE LESS THEY HAVE DONE TO
BACK UP THE ASSAD REGIME, HE
WILL CONTINUE TO KILL HIS PEOPLE
LIKE HE HAS DONE FOR THE LAST
SIX YEARS.

I'VE SEEN MANY CONGRESSMEN AND
WOMEN ON NATIONAL NEWS IN THE
PAST FEW DAYS BECAUSE OF THE
STRIKE.

I WANT TO START WITH WHERE YOU
ARE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE
PRESIDENT AND WHY YOU SAY
CONGRESS NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY
GET INVOLVED NOW?

I THINK THE WORLD WAS WATCHING
WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND I SUPPORT
HIS DECISION TO TAKE ACTION AND
SAY THAT WILL NOT STAND.

AS A FORMER NAVY SEAL YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENDGAME IT
SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES AND KEEPS
OUR VISION CRISP.

IT DOES TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.

WE HAVE TO LEARN LESSONS OF
PAST AND WHAT WENT WRONG IN
LIBYA WHEN YOU CHOOSE THAT
PATHWAY OF REGIME CHANGE.

HEAR THAT IS GOING TO BE.

STRONGLY CONDEMNS, I HAVE GREAT
CONFIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT ASEE
-- WILL HANDLE THOSE PROPERLY.

MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, MY
BROTHER, HIS WIFE, THEIR
CHILDREN, MY NIECES, ALL OF THEM
DEAD.

AMONG THE FAMILIES WE SPOKE TO
WAS ABDUL, HE HAS BECOME THE
FACE OF THE TRAGEDY.
