THOUGH AUTHORITIES WON'T SAY FOR
SURE IF THEY BELIEVE THERE ARE
ANY CHILDREN STILL INSIDE.

THIS IS THE CELLAR WHERE THEY
RODE IT OUT AND SURVIVED.

THAT WE'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR
EACH OTHER.

I WANT MY MOM.

WE MIGHT HAVE ONE HORSE LEFT OUT
OF ALL OF THEM.

ALL FIFTH GRADERS RIGHT HERE!

AND, ACCORDING TO THAT STUDY,
SHE IS ONE IN 100 TRILLION,
THOSE LONG ODDS YOUR HOME GETS
HIT BY AN EF-4 TORNADO TWICE.

THAT STUNNING RESEMBLANCE TO
MONDAY'S PATH.

THE TEACHERS AT PLAZA TOWERS
DIDN'T HAVE THAT BLESSING.

THIS IS IT NOW.

WE HAVE NEW PICTURES, PROVING
THE EPIC SIZE OF THE TORNADO IN
OKLAHOMA.

OKAY.

SOMEBODY'S KEYS THEY LEFT
BEHIND.

YOU MET WITH ONE OF THEM?

EXTRAORDINARY.

AND TWO LITTLE GIRLS, LOOKING AT
THE PLACE THEY ONCE CALLED HOME,
A BABY DOLL IN THEIR HANDS.

AND THEN, UM, I FELL BACK, AND
ALL THE DIRT THAT GOT IN MY EYES
AND I FELL.

I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THEY'RE
FINDING.

FOREVER.

THE INTERNET IS SPREADING
ANIMALS STORIES AND THE NEED FOR
HELP.
