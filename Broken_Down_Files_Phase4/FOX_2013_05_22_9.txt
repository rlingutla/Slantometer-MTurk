NOW JUST A PILE OF BROKEN
CHALK BOARDS AND SCATTERED
ARTWORK AND PILES WHERE
DESKS USED TO BE.

THOSE WERE BLOWN FROM THE
TORNADO 300 YARDS FROM THE
TOP OF THAT HOSPITAL.

YOU WILL MEET A TEACHER
FROM BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY.

AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SURE THOSE CHILDREN SAW
THEIR PARENTS AGAIN.

SET TO REOPEN THIS WEEK.

LIVES RIGHT HERE.

BUT THEY ARE HARD AT WORK
TODAY, TRYING TO REMOVE
WHAT'S THERE.

I MENTIONED EARLIER WE GOT
A LOOK FROM THE SKY AND A
LENGTHY ONE.

YOU HAVE THEM GET DOWN ON
THEIR KNEES.

THE SCENE THERE VERY
SIMILAR TO THAT OF ANOTHER
SCHOOL IN TOWN.

THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
TODAY.

AND YOU SEE THE SPRAY
PAINTED X'S.

THAT'S WHEN THEY WILL NEED
ALL OF US THE MOST IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

CASEY STEGALL IS DRIVING
LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE NOW
HARDLY RECOGNIZABLE STREETS
AS POLICE LET JOURNALISTS
IN FOR THE FIRST TIME.

CREWS SAY THEY BELIEVE THEY
HAVE NOW ACCOUNTED FOR
EVERYBODY WHO IS MISSING
AFTER THAT TWISTER HIT.

YOU DON'T SEE A BUNCH OF
HOUSES STILL THAT MIGHT BE
ABLE TO BUILD AROUND.

BUT WHEN THE TORNADO HIT
SHE STILL HAD 10 CHILDREN
THERE.

JONATHAN HUNT OUR CHIEF
FOX REPORT CORRESPONDENT
WILL TALK TO A TEACHER WHO
RODE OUT THE STORM WITH HER
STUDENTS IN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.

SHE CALLED THOSE FOURTH
GRADERS BRAVE AND
REMARKABLE.

19 DAYS LATER IT WAS AS IF
IT MIGHT NEVER END.
