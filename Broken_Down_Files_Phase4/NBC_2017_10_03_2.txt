SHE WOULD HAVE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

EXACT WORDS WERE
DADDY, THEY'RE
SHOOTING AT ME.

HE TOOK CARE OF
OTHER PEOPLE, EVEN AT
SHOOTING LEFT SO MANY
CHILDREN WITHOUT LOVED
ONES.

WEEKEND BEFORE HE
RENTED ROOMS IN HIGH
RISE CONDO BUILDING
OVERLOOKING EVEN
BIGGER OUTDOOR MUSIC
FESTIVAL.

ENDED TOO SOON.

TRAGEDY HERE HAS
PLUNGED THIS COUNTRY
BACK INTO MOST HEATED
DEBATES OF OUR TIME,
FIGHT OWN GUN LAWS.

I SAW MY DAD AND
RAN INTO HIS ARMS
CRYING BECAUSE I KNEW
HE WAS OUT THERE.

AS WE SEE INSIDE THE
KILLER'S HOTEL ROOM,
CHILLING NEW DETAILS
ON HIS ARSENAL, THE
DEVICE USED TO MODIFY
THE GUNS, HIDDEN
CAMERAS HE SET UP AND
BIG MONEY HE SENT
OVERSEAS SHORTLY
BEFORE COMMITTING MASS
MURDER.

NEVER SAW THEM
TOGETHER.

BLOOD-STAINED
BANDAGE, DISCARDED
GLOVE AND TOURNIQUET
BY THE SIDE OF THE
ROAD.

HIGH-POWERED SNIPER
RIFLE WITH SCOPE AND
STABILIZING BIPOD.

SHE WAS HOSTESS AT
ATLANTIS, STEVE WAS A
BIG FISH THERE.

THERE'S NO TALLY OF
THE HEROES WHO DRAGGED
STRICKEN PEOPLE FROM
LINE OF FIRE, APPLIED
A TURNEKIT OR APPLIED
PRESSURE TO WOUND.

VISIBLE THERE ONE OF
THE 22 WEAPONS HE
BROUGHT THERE IN 13
SUITCASES.

THIS IS A PHOTO OF HER
WITH PADDOCK IN 2014.

54-YEAR-OLD TOM DAY
JR., THE BEST DAD SAY
HIS FOUR CHILDREN, WHO
WERE WITH HIM AT THE
CONCERT.

CALLS THAT WEREN'T
GOING TO GET ANSWERED.

AUTHORITIES NOW KNOW
WHY HE WAS ABLE TO
SHOOT SO QUICKLY WITH
DEADLY EFFECT.

AT THE TIME LIVING
WITH PADDOCK IN RENO,
NEVADA, WORKING AT
LOCAL CASINO.

YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO HAVE POLICY DEBATE?
