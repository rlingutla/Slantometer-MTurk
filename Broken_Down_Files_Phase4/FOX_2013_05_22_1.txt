AND JUST AHEAD OF US IS THE
SPOT WHERE THE TORNADO
ACTUALLY LIFTED BACK INTO
THE SKY.

WHEN THEY WILL NEED OUR
MONEY AND OUR SUPPORT, OUR
PRAYERS AND OUR HELPING
HAND.

10 OF THEM CHILDREN.

THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMING
AROUND PASSING FOOD OUT
BRINGING BLANKETS AND
WATER.

WE HEARD SO MANY
INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OVER
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT
FEW TO ME HAVE BEEN AS
INSPIRING AS THAT OF
THERESA MOSIER.

HOW THE BRAVE KIDS GOT INTO
ACTION LIFT THE CONCRETE TO
SAVE THEIR OWN LITTLE KIDS.

AND THEY WERE SCARED.

MANY MORE PEOPLE SURVIVED A
TWISTER BUT SUFFERED MANY
INJURIES.

IT'S AMAZING, SHEM, THAT
ANYBODY COULD HAVE SURVIVED
THAT LET ALONE COME OUT
LITERALLY WITHOUT A
SCRATCH.

THE BUILDING SUSTAINED UP
TO $1 MILLION IN DAMAGE BUT
THAT AS MANY AS 200 PEOPLE
WERE INSIDE DURING THAT
TORNADO AND NOT ONE SINGLE
ONE OF THEM GOT HURT.

THEY DUCKED DOWN UNDER
DESKS.

A SCAR ACROSS AMERICA'S
HEART LAND.

WHEN THEY HEARD THE
WARNINGS THAT THE TORNADO
WAS COMING AND THEY STARTED
TO FEEL THE VIBRATION.

AND WE ARE COMING INTO AN
AREA THAT'S MORE -- THAT'S
LESS POPULATED.

IT'S AS IF SOMEBODY -- AS
IF A GIANT CAME IN AND
SQUISHED IT IN HIS HAND AND
DROPPED IT IT ON THE
GROUND.

AND YOU CAN SEE MATTRESSES,
BOARDS, ON TOP OF EACH
OTHER COMING UP ON THE
LEFT-HAND SIDE IS GOING TO
BE AN UPROOTED TREE.

MOVED OUT HERE THREE
MILES.

MOVED HERE.

THEIR LIVES IN HER HANDS.

THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE THEY
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO
SALVAGE THE HOME.
