THEY BEAT BACK THE OPPOSITE
FORCES OUT OF ALEPPO.

THINK ABOUT WHAT A DRAMATIC
STATEMENT THIS IS.

IF WE RESPOND TO THIS SARIN GAS
ATTACK, SHOULD WE RESPOND TO   N
CONVENTIONAL ATTACKS?

RESOLUTION
TO INVADE IRAQ AND WE INVADE
LIBYA.

THE BOLIVIAN AMBASSADOR WELCOMED
THE MEETING.

IF YOU LOOK IN THE DISTINCTION
ANSWER THE, YOU CAN SEE SMOKE A
ON THE HORIZON.

AGAIN, I SAID THAT IF THERE
IS A STRATEGY TO GO ALONG
OF IT.

AND THIS VIDEO FROM SYRIAN STATE
TELEVISION REPORTED THERE FROM
NEAR THAT VERY BASE.

I UNDERSTAND.

AFTER 37 YEARS IN SERVICE AND
WE THANK YOU.

WE'RE TOLD ALL TEN STORAGE AREAS
WERE TAKEN OUT.

I'M TOLD THERE'S QUITE A
SPLIT.

THE PRESIDENT HAS APPROVED THE
PLANS.

MY STANDPOINT, THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION SHOULD LAY OUT A
STRATEGY, SHOULD ESTABLISH SOME
GOALS.

BACK IN 2013, DONALD TRUMP URGED
PRESIDENT OBAMA NOT TO TAKE
MILITARY ACTION IN SYRIA IN
RESPONSE TO THAT AUGUST OF 2013
SARIN GAS ATTACK THAT KILLED 14.

WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

THE ACTION OF THIS BRUTAL
DICTATOR DIDN'T CHANGE.

OF THAT STRIKE PRACTICALLY
SPEAKING?

AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, PROBABLY
AS A NATION, IT'S A SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE FROM THE U.S.

I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.
