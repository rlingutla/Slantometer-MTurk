FINALLY TONIGHT HERE, WE ARE
JUST BACK FROM OKLAHOMA, AND IT
WASN'T DIFFICULT CHOOSING OUR
"PERSONS OF THE WEEK."

AND I KNOW THAT MY SON AND
DAUGHTER WERE BOTH IN THE HANDS
OF PEOPLE WHO LOVED THEM.

MRS. BITTLE.

WE WILL ALSO NEVER FORGET THE
CALM INSTINCTS OF THEIR TEACHER.

THEY JUST WANTED TO SAY MOM,
COME GET ME, OR, YOU KNOW, I
WANT TO GO HOME.

WHAT DID THEY WANT TO SAY?

TONIGHT, WHAT WE DIDN'T KNOW.

SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THESE BRAVE
TEACHERS.

THOSE PARENTS ARE GRATEFUL TO
YOU.

I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOUR
NECKLACE.

OUR TRIP THROUGH THE SCHOOLS.

AND GOT DELIVERED TO THEIR
PARENTS, AND -- THE TEACHERS AT
PLAZA TOWERS DIDN'T HAVE THAT
BLESSING.

PRAY BIG.

SHERI IS A FRIEND AND A
COWORKER.

SAID.

WHAT'S STILL A MYSTERY, A
MIRACLE, IS HOW SO MANY OTHERS
GOT OUT.

BUT SHE HAD THE PRESENCE OF
HAVE THEM TEXT MESSAGE THEIR
PARENTS.

AND TO THEM YOU WOULD SAY?

YOUR CHILD IS MY CHILD.

I DID.
