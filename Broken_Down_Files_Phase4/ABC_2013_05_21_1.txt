WE'RE ALL ACTING OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

WE HAVE LAN TERNS AND ANOTHER
INTERESTING THING, LAPTOPS WHILE
WE WERE IN HERE.

I HAVE ANOTHER BEHIND THE
PICTURE IMAGE TONIGHT.

CINDY LOWE TEACHES FIRST GRADE.

IT IS THE VOICE YOU HEAR AS THAT
TORNADO IS ABOUT TO TOUCH DOWN
AND TAKE DIRECT AIM AT HIS HOME
AND HIS FAMILY.

TO SEARCH EVERY HOME HERE IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, THREE TIMES
BEFORE GIVING UP.

SHE OPENED HER DOOR AND SAW THE
TORNADO COME.

IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS LIKE AN
HOUR.

THIS LITTLE BLACK DOG STOOD
GUARD OVER ITS OWNER WHO DIED IN
THE STORM.

DOGS, RABBITS, EVEN A PARROT.

HE TOLD ME THE CHILDREN QUIETLY
CRYING, THE FAMILY MOUTHING
THEIR WORDS TO EACH OTHER,
BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE ON THEIR
EARS, THEY COULDN'T HEAR A
THING.

I CAN REACH OUT AND TOUCH
BOTH WALLS WITH MY FINGERS.

I JUST TRIED TO BE THE BEST
DAD I COULD AT THAT TIME.

ONLINE, A WOMAN FOUND DEBRIS IN
HER FRONT YARD 100 MILES AWAY,
SET UP A FACEBOOK PAGE, A CYBER
LOST AND FOUND.

NOT A HUGE SPACE.

THEY ARE THE COBB FAMILY, LA
DONNA AND STEVE.

THEY HAVE BEEN OUT HERE ALL DAY
TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER THEIR
LIVES.

MANY WITH INJURIES.

AMERICA, MEET NANCY.

THERE WAS JASON IN HIS FRONT
YARD.
