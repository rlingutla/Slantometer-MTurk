THE ATTACK KILLED AT LEAST 58
AND 11 CHILDREN.

THERE'S REPORTS OF PEOPLE
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, PEOPLE
UNRESPONSIVE.

SPICER IS SAYING OFF CAMERA THAT
HE WASN'T GOING TO GET AHEAD OF
THE PRESIDENT.

IT'S HOME TO 900,000 DISPLACED
SYRIANS.

THEY THINK MORE THAN ONE GAS WAS
USED INCLUDING SARIN.

WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND WE
NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW DEFEATING
ISIS.

SO WHAT NOW?

AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. NIKKI
HALEY SAID THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T INTERESTED
IN REMOVING AL-ASSAD FROM POWER
AND IT SHOULD BE UP TO THE
SYRIAN PEOPLE TO DECIDE THE
FUTURE OF THEIR COUNTRY.

THE WHITE HOUSE SHORTLY BEFORE
THEN PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING
THAT IT WAS THE ADMINISTRATION
OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO BLAME FOR
THIS FOR NOT ENFORCING THAT
INFAMOUS RED LINE IF THE SYRIAN
REGIME OF BARBER AL-ASSAD HAD
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST
HIS OWN PEOPLE, THIS IS A WEEK
AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE
SAID IT'S UP TO THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE TO DECIDE AL-ASSAD'S
FUTURE.

THERE'S A POLITICAL REALITY
THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT IN TERMS
OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.

THAT IS THE STATEMENT FROM THE
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS
JUST RELEASED THE STATEMENT.

THE QUESTION IS WHETHER WE WILL
TAKE ACTION TO DISABUSE HIM OF
THIS MURDEROUS NOTION."

AS YOU RECALL LAST WEEK, THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY
WEREN'T FOCUSED ON TAKING OUT
ASSAD ANYMORE.

WHAT DID IT SAY?

1,300 TONS OF MATERIALS WERE
DESTROYED.

THESE ARE COMMON SYMPTOMS OF
TOXIC GAS EXPOSURES.

MEDICS REPORTING THAT ROCKET
ATTACKS AND CLINICS TREATING THE
WOUNDED.

THIS IS THE WORST TOXIC GAS
ATTACK ON A DAMASCUS SUBJECT
BOSCH.
