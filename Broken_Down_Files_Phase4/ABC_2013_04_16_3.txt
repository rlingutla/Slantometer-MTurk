ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY
COLLECT IT IS, IT MIGHT NOT LOOK
LIKE MUCH.

AFTER THE FIRST EXPLOSION,
THERE'S CONFUSION, BUT RELATIVE
CALM AS PEOPLE MOVE AWAY.

TONIGHT THE NEWEST MEMBER OF OUR
ABC NEWS FAMILY VETERAN REPORTER
ABC'S BYRON PITTS IS HERE TO
TELL US ABOUT THIS NEW NORMAL IN
AMERICAN CITIES TONIGHT.

SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WE
ARE, WHAT AMERICA IS, HOW WE
RESPOND TO EVIL, THAT'S IT.

A YOUNG BOY COLLECTING HIS
THOUGHTS IN A CHURCH NEAR THE
BOMBINGS, AND A LONE ATHLETE
DEFIANTLY RUNNING ALONG THE
SHORES OF THE CHARLES RIVER
EARLY THIS MORNING.

STILL AHEAD RIGHT HERE ON
"WORLD NEWS," THE 8-YEAR-OLD
MEMBER OF THE LITTLE LEAGUE AND
THE TOWN THAT IS RALLYING AROUND
HIS FAMILY TONIGHT.

AND WHEN WE COME BACK, YOU'LL
MEET A SURGEON WHO KNEW ABOUT
TRAUMA IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ.

WE ARE ON JUST ONE CORNER OF
WHAT IS A 12-BLOCK CRIME SCENE
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THIS CITY.

BOSTON, MEMORIES OF 9/11.

WHEN WE WOULD SEE THEM, THEY
WOULD ALL BE TOGETHER, WHETHER
IT WAS AT CHURCH, GOING TO
SCHOOL, ON THE SPORTS FIELD,
IN THE NANED, -- NEIGHBORHOOD,
THEY WERE A VERY ACTIVE FAMILY
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

IT WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARATHON
AND KILL PEOPLE IN THAT
IMMEDIATE AREA.

THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE
EMERGENCY ROOM AND LOOKED AT THE
CASUALTIES, WITHOUT EVEN
EXAMINING THE PATIENTS IN
DETAIL, I COULD JUST SEE THE
PATTERN OF INJURY, AND I THOUGHT
TO MYSELF, THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE
I WAS BACK IN IRAQ OR
AFGHANISTAN.

APRIL IS ALSO A MONTH WITH
SIGNIFICANCE FOR DOMESTIC TERROR
GROUPS.

THEY'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THE
PERSON WHO HAD THAT UNUSUALLY
HEAVY BLACK BAG THE DAY OF THE
RACE.

WE'RE STRONG PEOPLE AND WE'RE
NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE PUSH US
AROUND.

IT PUTS YOU ON EDGE.

AN OUTPOURING OF PRAYERS FOR
MARTIN'S MOTHER AND SISTER WHO
REMAIN IN THE HOSPITAL.

I SAW HIM GET OUT OF THE CAR.

LAST YEAR, FOUR HOURS AND 18
MINUTES IN, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER,
THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY THE TIME
HIS BOMB EXPLODED.

I WAS OUTSIDE WITH MY DOG.
