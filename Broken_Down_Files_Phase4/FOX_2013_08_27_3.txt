WHAT'S SIGNIFICANT ABOUT
THAT SECOND TIMED THEY HAVE
SPOKEN JUST IN THE LAST FEW
DAYS.

CONSULTING WITH ALLIES LIKE
THAT SUGGEST WE ARE EDGING
CLOSER TO U.S. MILITARY
ACTION.

LET'S GET THE FACTS.

IF WE DO IT RIGHT.

BUT IF YOU COME YOU ARE
READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

THE PRESIDENT RETAINS
ALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO
HIM.

2007, CANDIDATE OBAMA
WAS AN ACTUAL OR IMMINENT
THREAT TO THE NATION.

USING ALL MEANS AVAILABLE.

THAT IS NOT ON THE TABLE
RIGHT NOW.

IN THE MEANTIME, U.N.
WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE
STILL ON THE GROUND IN
DAMASCUS, TRYING TO
INVESTIGATE THAT ALLEGED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

IMPORTANT PART OF THAT
COALITION EVEN IF
UNOFFICIALLY MAY WELL BE
THE ARAB LEAGUE.

IF YOU ARE READING THE TEA
LEAVES ON TIMING, THAT
COULD ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT,
BILL.

IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
SPECIFICALLY TO DETER AND
DEGRADE THE FUTURE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHEN
AND HOW THE U.S. HAS
FOUR WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST
OF MILITARY.

THIS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING
INVOLVED IN A MIDDLE
EASTERN WAR OR CHANGING OUR
STAFFS IN SYRIA OR GOING
FURTHER INTO THAT CONFLICT.

WE REMAIN COMBINED THAT
THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN FAR
TOO MUCH BLOOD SHED IN
SYRIA.

AND WE GET THE MOMENTUM
BACK ON SHIFTED TO OUR
FREEDOM FIGHTERS --
 NOW, THE NEXT STEP IN
THE CASE FOR MILITARY
ACTION WE'RE EXPECTING THE
WHITE HOUSE AS EARLY AS
TOMORROW TO DECLASSIFY SOME
INTELLIGENCE THAT THEY SAY
WILL SHOW THAT ASSAD DID
USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

AND THEN A DECISION WILL BE
MADE ON WHETHER ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN, IF ACTION
SHOULD BE TAKEN, WHAT
ACTION.

REPUBLICANS LIKE JOHN
MCCAIN SAYING TONIGHT LOOK,
IF THERE IS GOING TO BE
MILITARY ACTION, FINE.

IT LOOKS LIKE WE SEE A
COALITION FORMING.
