NBC'S ANN CURRY MADE HER WAY
TODAY TO ONE OF THE REFUGEE
CAMPS, THE BIGGEST IN FACT.

INSPECTORS ARE STILL ON THE
GROUND.

BUT THEY SAY, IF THE UNITED
STATES DOESN'T INTERVENE NOW,
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S REGIME WILL BE
ENCOURAGED TO GO FURTHER AND
THEY BELIEVE USE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AGAIN.

THEY HEARD FROM HIM JUST ONCE
SINCE THEY LEFT HOME.

AREN'T WE JUST LIKE THEM?

THE LANGUAGE FROM WASHINGTON
TODAY WAS EXCEEDINGLY BLUNT.

HE DREAMS OF HIS FATHER AND
CRIES.

SO AMERICA IS ONCE AGAIN
BUILDING A CASE FOR MILITARY
ACTION.

EVEN OUR MOTHERS STARTED CRYING.

IS AMERICA ABOUT TO STRIKE?

SYRIAN REBELS TELL US THAT ASSAD
HAS USED THEM AT LEAST 30 TIMES
SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN AND THIS
LATEST CASE WAS JUST THE MOST
FLAGRANT.

DAYS LEAVING JALAL'S FATHER A
COOK TO FIGHT AS A REBEL.

U.N. BACKING IS UNLIKELY WITHOUT
RUSSIAN SUPPORT.

JALAL'S STORY IS ONE GLIMPSE
INTO THIS WAR'S TRAGEDY FOR
SYRIA'S CHILDREN.

WE CRAWLED ON OUR BELLIES OR
RAN.

I'M TOLD THIS IS NOT IMMINENT.

CALLING OUT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT OVER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK LAST WEEK THAT
KILLED HUNDREDS OF SYRIAN
CIVILIANS.

THE U.S. AND OTHERS ALREADY
BELIEVE THE ASSAD REGIME USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS LAST WEEK ON A
SCALE NOT SEEN ANYWHERE IN
DECADES.

IT'S BURSTING AT THE SEAMS WITH
130,000 PEOPLE.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE CALLING
IT A MORAL OBSCENITY.
