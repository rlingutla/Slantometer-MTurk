NO INDIVIDUAL CAN DO THIS.

HE HAS VIOLATED HIS OATH.

RESPONSE TONIGHT?

FOR HIM TO QUALIFY AS A
WHISTLEBLOWER HE WOULD NEED
TO DEMONSTRATE, HIS
BEHAVIOR ON WHICH HE BLEW A
WHISTLE WAS ILLEGAL OR
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

ABOUT SOMETHING MORE
POLITICAL THAN LEGAL AS TO
WHETHER HE WILL BE
EXTRADITED.

HE HAS DISCLOSED AN
INCREDIBLE ASSISTANCE TO
AL-QAEDA.

I SITTING AT MY DESK HAD
THE AUTHORITY TO WIRETAP
ANYONE, FROM YOU TO YOUR
ACCOUNTANT TO EVEN THE
YOUR RESPONSE THAT HE
LEAKED CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION ABOUT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S
PROGRAM?

IF THIS PROGRAM HAD NOT
BEEN IN PLACE BACK IN 2009,
THEY WOULD HAVE KILLED
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
PEOPLE IN NEW YORK IN A
SUBWAY SYSTEM THE PLAN HE
HAD TO SET OFF EXPLOSIVES
IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM.

GOOD LORD, NOT IN CHINA.

NOW MORE ON THAT ISSUE.

THAT HAS A LOT OF IMPACT?

BEEN THE SOURCE FOR THE
"WASHINGTON POST" AND
GUARDIAN NEWSPAPERS AS THE
HEADLINES HAVE BEEN FILLING
UP WITH JARRING DETAILS
ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT MINING
PHONE LORDS FOR INFORMATION
ABOUT CUSTOMERS.

I DON'T THINK HE HAS OTHER
SOURCES, I THINK SNOWDEN
HAS GIVEN FAR MORE TO HIM
THAN HE IS WILLING TO
ADMIT.

IT INVADES OUR PRIVACY.

CHINA WAS VISITING WITH OUR
PRESIDENT.

WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT EXACTLY WHO IS EDWARD
SNOWDEN.

AND KATHERINE, IN JUST LAST
FEW MINUTES THE STORY HAS
BEEN UNFOLDING AS BREAKING
DETAILS.

THERE IS NO WAY THIS GUY
SHOULD GO ABOUT HIS
BUSINESS WITHOUT
CONSEQUENCES.

TWO LAWMAKERS ONE
INFLUENTIAL COMMITTEE AND
LOTS OF SNIPING OVER THE
IRS TARGETING CONSERVATIVE
GROUPS.

HE SINCE LEFT.
