THE PLAN WILL BE THERE BUT AGAIN
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAR COME IS
GOING TO BE DIPLOMACY.

JULIE SENATOR RAND PAUL AND A
CRITIC OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
EXPRESSING DOUBT OF U.S. STRIKE
ON SYRIA SAYING THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD OBEY THE CONSTITUTION AND
ASK OR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
BEFORE USING MILITARY ACTION.

ATROCITY IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO
DISOBEY THE CONSTITUTION.

THE TWO BIG TAKEAWAYS THERE ARE
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATING
WHAT THE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.
NIKKI HALEY SAID YESTERDAY, THAT
THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO TAKE
FURTHER ACTION IF NECESSARY IF
ASSAD DOES NOT STOP THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACKS AGAINST HIS OWN
PEOPLE AND THEN IT ALSO, THEY
SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES HE
CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WITHOUT
RECEIVING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
TO DO SO.

HE BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD NOT
INTERVENE IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA
AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE
ARGUED AGAINST THE STRIKE.

AMERICAN TOMAHAWK MISSILES
NEARLY LEVELING A SYRIAN AIRBASE
HANGER.

JULIE TODAY AN OLD ARCH ENEMY
OF THE ASSAD REGIME TURKISH
FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THIS EARLY
TODAY IN TURKEY.

DEMOLISHED AND RUNWAYS DAMAGE
THE SYRIAN FORCES ARE LASHING
OUT AT REBEL TARGETS.

AND THEN OF COURSE IS A
NONINTERVENTIONIST.

I AM SURE A LOT OF FOLKS ON
CAPITOL HILL WOULD DISAGREE WITH
THAT.

"FOX NEWS" HAS LEARNED THE U.S.
MILITARY IS RAMPING UP EFFORTS
TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 1000
AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN
SYRIA OR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE
COALITION IS CUT BACK ON SOME OF
ITS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ISIS
THERE BECAUSE U.S. AIR FORCE
F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER JETS FROM
THE AIRBASE IN TURKEY NOT FAR
FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER 

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KEEPS
PRESSURE ON THE SYRIAN REGIME.

RUSSIA KEEPS UP A STRONG
MILITARY PRESENCE ACTIVELY
ASSISTING THE ASSAD REGIME IN
THE COMPANY.

1939 TURKEY ANNEXED LAND AT
NORTHWEST AREA WHICH TODAY IS
TURKEY'S SOUTHERNMOST PROVINCE.

THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS
EVOLVE INTO WHAT?

THE U.S. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL
ACTION AS NECESSARY AND
APPROPRIATE TO FURTHER ITS
IMPORTANT NATIONAL INTERESTS.

I WOULD ARGUE FOR A NO-FLY
ZONE AND ARMING AND TRAINING THE
FREE SYRIAN ARMY.

INTERVENTION
AS APPROPRIATE.

THEY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.
ACTION IN SYRIA IS THE SAUDIS
CALLING IT A COURAGEOUS DECISION
BUT REFLECTING A REGION OVER
SYRIA IRANIAN PRESIDENT A STRONG
ALLY OF ASSAD HAS BEEN CRITICAL
OF U.S. DECISION.

ATTACK APPARENTLY HAS
NOT SLOWED SYRIA DOWN MUCH.
