THIS IS A MONSTER SYSTEM THAT
HAS TOUCHED DOWN A FEW MILES
WEST OF WICHITA.

THERE IS A TORNADO AND SHAWN
IS COMING ON I-40 UP IN HERE.

WHY IS THAT, JANICE?

SO THE STORM PASSED AND THEN
CAME ON INDOORS TO HELP ASSESS
THE DAMAGE AND WORK WITH THE
MEDIA.

HEADING INTO TUESDAY ACROSS THE
GREAT LAKES THE TENNESSEE
RIVER VALLEY AND THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY.

RIGHT NOW, FOX 25 IS TALKING TO
THE GUY DRIVING THIS CAR THE
STORM SPOTTER.

THIS IS NOT OVER.

WE HE HAVE ONE THAT THEY ARE
WATCHING RIGHT NOW OUTSIDE OF
