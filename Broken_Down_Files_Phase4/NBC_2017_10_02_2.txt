DO YOU RUN OR DO YOU
TAKE COVER?

THERE WAS JUST -- IT
WAS JUST SHOOTING
STARTED AT 1008 P.M.
FIRST REPORTS OF SHOTS
FIRED AS SINGER JASON
ALDEAN PERFORMED.

TEAM BUSTED INTO THE
GUNMAN'S HOTEL ROOM.

IT'S FIREWORKS.

BUZZ BRAINARD WORKING
WITH SIRIUS/XM THERE
WITH HIS 19-YEAR-OLD
SON HANK.

FRIEND HE HAD HELPED
SAVE.

HIS WIFE IS A SURGEON.

EMERGENCY PERSONNEL
CALLED IN TO HELP.

JORDAN LINED UP TO
DONATE BLOOD JUST
HOURS AFTER LEARNING
HIS COUSIN QUINTON
ROBBINS WAS KILLED.

WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY LAW
ENFORCEMENT CONTACTS,
NO ARRESTS OR NOTHING.

HE WAS A RETIRED
ACCOUNTANT AFTER
LIVING FOR A TIME IN
TEXAS AND FLORIDA, A
MULTIMILLIONAIRE REAL
ESTATE DEVELOPER, HIS
BROTHER SAYS.

OH, YEAH, MY BUDDY WAS
HIT.

BY THE TIME WE MERGED
WITH THE CROWD THAT
WAS HERE, SO THEN IT
JUST -- IT BECAME
CHAOS.

OVERWHELMING FIVE
HOSPITALS.

A SINGLE MOM.

IT GOES DOWN THE
BARREL WITH HIGH
VELOCITY.

JUST EVERYBODY I
SAW DOVE UNDERNEATH
THE TOUR BUSES.

AND SO YOU KNOW, THEY
STARTED TRIAGING AND
WE GOT MY BUDDY IN THE
AMBULANCE.

NBC'S STEPHANIE GOSK

VICTIMS.

THEY MET AT THE
HOSPITAL AND FELL IN
LOVE.
