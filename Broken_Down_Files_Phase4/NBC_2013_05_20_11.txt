SOME OF THE CONCRETE WALLS,
BRICK WALLS ARE STANDING.

TONIGHT, A MASSIVE SEARCH FOR
SURVIVORS IS JUST GETTING UNDER
WAY.

I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN GET TO
THAT NOW.

NO.

ALL WE KNOW IS THE DEATH TOLL
WILL RISE.

WHEN WE COME BACK, WEATHER
CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST MIKE
SEIDEL HAS COME ACROSS A FAIRLY
GRIM SCENE THERE IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, TONIGHT.
 
I HAD TO HOLD ONTO THE WALL
TO KEEP MYSELF SAFE BECAUSE I
DIDN'T WANT TO FLY AWAY IN THE
TORNADO.

IN SOME CASES IT WILL BE
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ADDRESSES.

IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE IT, BUT
THIS IS, I THINK YOU WILL AGREE,
THE MOST INTENSE WEATHER SYSTEM
THE EARTH CAN PRODUCE.

THE TORNADO CAME THROUGH LIKE A
BUZZ SAW AND SCRAPED THE EARTH
CLEAN.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN DESTRUCTION SO
TOTAL OVER SUCH AN EXPANSIVE
THERE A QUESTION IN YOUR MIND
SINCE YOU HAVE DONE THIS MORE
THAN ANYBODY ON THE TALENT THAT
THIS TORNADO WILL NOT BE AN
EF-5?

WE HAVE A LATE UPDATE FROM THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS.

AT LEAST SIX CHILDREN HAVE
DROWNED IN THE BASEMENT.

AGAIN, RIGHT NOW I DO NOT KNOW
HOW MANY KIDS WERE INSIDE OR ARE
STILL INSIDE.

AS YOU MENTIONED, THE EF-5
TORNADO THAT WENT THROUGH THERE,
JUST NORTH OF WHERE THIS ONE
TRACKED ACROSS THE CITY OF
MOORE.

THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION YOU HAVE.

THESE ARE WELL BUILT FRAME
HOMES, BRICK HOMES.

THEY WILL DIVIDE UP THE
COMMUNITY INTO GRIDS.

WE BELIEVE ABOUT A MILE-WIDE
TORNADO HAS JUST LEVELLED THE
COMMUNITIES IN MOORE.

JANET, I DID CEE LO CALL -- E
SEE LOCAL OFFICIALS TELLING
PEOPLE TO TRY TEXTING.

THIS IS -- THIS IS TERRIBLE.
