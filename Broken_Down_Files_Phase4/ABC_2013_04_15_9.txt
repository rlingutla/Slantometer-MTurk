THE SCENE COMING OUT OF IT WAS
NOT HYSTERICAL.

HOW QUICKLY DID YOU GRASP
WHAT HAD HAPPENED, THAT IT WAS A
BOMB?

THE LATEST NUMBER WE'RE
GETTING FROM EMERGENCY ROOMS IS
80 PEOPLE TAKEN TO AREA
HOSPITALS.

AT AIRPORTS AND TONIGHT'S L.A.
DODGERS GAME, AND ALSO IN
LONDON.

SHRAPNEL, ALL KINDS OF WOUNDS?

PIERRE, I WANT TO GO TO THE
VIDEO OF THE EXPLOSION.

WE WANT TO STABILIZE THE
SITUATION.

RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO
THE STREETS OF BOSTON AND SHOW
YOU THE CHAOS, THE CONFUSION,
LET YOU HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO
WERE THERE.

WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THAT, A
SENIOR OFFICIAL TOLD ME, ANY
EVENT WITH MULTIPLE EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES, AS THIS APPEARS TO BE,
IS CLEARLY AN ACT OF TERROR AND
WILL BE APPROACHED AS AN ACT OF
TERROR, BUT WENT ON TO SAY, WE
DON'T KNOW WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE,
IF IT WAS DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN.

TELL ME, FORENSICALLY, WHAT
INVESTIGATORS THINK THEY CAN
DETERMINE FROM WHAT WE'RE
SEEING.

IT'S THE SOFT TARGET TERRORISTS
ARE LOOKING FOR.

AND THEN I FELT THE GROUND
AGAIN, PEOPLE RUNNING, YOU WERE
GETTING TRAMPLED.

TOM RIDGE WAS OUR COUNTRY'S
FIRST SECRETARY OF HOMELAND
SECURITY.

I WANT TO COMMEND BOSTON POLICE
AND THE MEDICS THERE, THEY WERE
FRANTICALLY GETTING THINGS THAT
EVERYBODY NEEDED TO THE AREA.

HE WAS BRIEFED BY ALSO HIS
HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY
JANET NAPOLITANO.

IT WAS VERY LOUD.

THE GROUND SHOOK, YOU COULD JUST
FEEL IT GOING DOWN THROUGH YOU.

THEY'RE ALL SAFE, I LEARNED FROM
FACEBOOK.

THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR
SURVEILLANCE TAPE.

THE MEDICAL TEAM HERE RESPONDED
INSTANTLY.
