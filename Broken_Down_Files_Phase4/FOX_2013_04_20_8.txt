GOOD JOB, GENTLEMEN.

THE SOX AT HOME FOR THE FIRST
TIME SINCE THE ATTACK AND
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE
VOLUNTEERS AND VICTIMS AND
RESCUER WORKER OF THE BOMBING.

IT WOULD BE BEYOND HEROIC .

WE HAVE TO GO IN THE BATHROOM
.

THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

TO
INVESTIGATE THE BROTHER
BECAUSE HE WAS A FOLLOWER OF
RADICAL ISLAM AND A STRONG
BELIEVER AND CHANGED TO LEAVE
TO THE UNITED STATES TO JOIN
UNSPECIFIED UNDER GROUND
GROUPS.

WE HAVE A REPORT FROM
WATERTOWN OF 67 FRANKLIN
STREET, THERE IS A BOAT WITH
BLOOD ON IT AND BELIEVE
SOMEONE IS IN THE BLOOD.

A SPOKMAFOR THE BUREAU
ALCOHOL, TOBACCO AND FIREARMS
SAYS THE SUSPECT HAS GUNSHOT
WOUNDS TO HIS NECK AND LEG.

SHEPHERD, PEOPLE IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD ARE GETTING OUT
AND LOOKING AT THE AFTERMATH
OF THE MANHUNT THAT ENDED IN A
BLAZE OF GUNFIRE RIGHT HERE.

WAS IT NOT THE LETTER OF
THE LAW.

WOW, THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE
GOTTEN FROM OUR COMMUNITY HAS
BEEN INCREDIBLE AT THIS TIME.

THE YOUNG MAN CALLED HIM IN
2009 TO SAY HE CHOSE GOD'S
BUSINESS OVER SCHOOL OR WORK.

THERE IS GOING TO BE GAS
DEPLOYED AND FIRING GAS IN THE
BOAT.

HE DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

DON'T RETURN FIRE.

REMEMBER THE UNCLE CALLED
HIS NEPHEWS LOSERCE AND
ANGRILY DEMANDED THAT THE
YOUNGER SON TURN HIMSELF IN.

RIGHT NOW SPECIAL
INTERROGATION TEAMS ARE IN THE
HOSPITAL TO QUESTION THE
SUSPECT.

THAT'S NEXT.

BOB GLATZ SHOT THAT VIDEO.

THEY ARE HONORING THE MARATHON
BOMBING VICTIMS IN THE CITY
TODAY.
