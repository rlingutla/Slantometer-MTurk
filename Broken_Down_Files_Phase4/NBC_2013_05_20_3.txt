UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU LOOK AT THE
PURPLE HERE, THAT'S THE TORNADO
INTENSI
INTENSIFYING.

WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MOORE HAS
BASICALLY PARALYZED EVERYTHING
NEAR AND AROUND IT.

IT WAS IN THIS SAME TOWN --
MOORE, OKLAHOMA -- BACK IN 1999
WHEN THE HIGHEST EVER TORNADO
WINDS WERE RECORDED, 302 MILES
AN HOUR.

AGAIN, EARLY PICTURES FROM MOORE
SHOW SCHOOL CHILDREN STAGGERING
INTO THE ARMS OF TEACHERS AND
PARENTS.

WE PROBABLY WALKED A MILE AND A
HALF.

IT HAS BEEN HARD TO LISTEN TO,
BUT LOCAL REPORTERS HAVE BEEN
BREAKING UP ON THE AIR TODAY,
OVERCOME WITH EMOTION BECAUSE,
AFTER ALL, THEY ARE COVERING
THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.

WE ARE WITH DR. GREG FORBES, AN
EXPERT IN SURVEYING DAMAGE.

WE COULD BE IN FOR SOME DARK
HOURS AND DARK DAYS AHEAD FOR
THAT COMMUNITY AS THEY COME TO
GRIPS WITH WHAT'S BEEN LOST
HERE.

WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME HERE IS
THEM ESTABLISHING A COMMAND POST
AT THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

THAT'S WHERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.

THE LIFETIME OF THE TORNADO,
BRIAN, WAS ONLY ABOUT 40 MINUTES
AND THE CORE PEAK TIME WAS ABOUT
15 MINUTES AND IT WAS IN THAT
PERIOD IN THE POPULATED PART OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, SOUTH OF
OKLAHOMA CITY, THAT THE STORM
PEAKED OVER TOP OF WHERE THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS AND WHERE
A WELL KNOWN HORSE BARN IS THERE
SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY.

IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR AND JUST
GLASS AND DEBRIS STARTED
SLAMMING ON US.

OH, MY GOODNESS.

AS DR. FORBES MENTIONED, AND
HE'S THE EXPERT, BUT THIS HAS TO
BE EF-5 DAMAGE.

MOST OF THE WALLS COLLAPSED.

WE HATE TO COME TO YOU WITH.

BECAUSE OF THE STORM 14 YEARS
AGO.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

OH, MY.

NOTHING WAS LEFT EXCEPT BIG
TREES AND STEEL GIRDERS.
