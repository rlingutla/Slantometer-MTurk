TRUMP TO BE VERY TOUGH ON ASSAD
WITHOUT CHANGING HIS PREVIOUS
POLICY.

WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET FROM
TRUMP, WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT.

TALKING ABOUT IT IN THE STRIDENT
TERMS THAT HE HAS BEEN, BUT
BEING DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS
ABOUT WHAT THE UNITED STATES'
RESPONSE MIGHT BE.

OFFICIALS IN MOSCOW SAYS A
SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A WEAPONS
DUMP THAT RELEASED THE DEADLY
CHEMICALS.

THAT WAS 2012.

I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING THAT
WAS NOT ONE OF OUR BETTER DAYS
AS A COUNTRY.

IS THE U.S.

A MAJOR SHIFT FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP HIMSELF THIS AFTERNOON
DURING A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE
WITH JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH.

HIS OWN PEOPLE UNSEEDED HIM AND
ENDED UP IN A WAR TIMES TRIAL
BEFORE HIS DEATH.

RUSSIA HAS BLAMED IT ON THE
SYRIAN REBELS.

HE'S BEEN VERY STUDIOUS SAYING
TOO OFTEN THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS TELEGRAPHING
WHAT SORT OF ACTION THEY WOULD
TAKE.

HE GOES BACK TO MOSUL.

THE BACKGROUND HERE IS
IMPORTANT.

NOW THERE'S VIDEO OF THIS AS
HORRIFIC AS IT IS, THERE IS NO
CHANGE IN ACTION AND ATTITUDE.

I THINK WITH SOME UN
CERTAINTY.

SPEAKING ON A WORLD STAGE AND
CERTAINLY ON LIVE TELEVISION.

THAT'S WHAT'S CHANGED.

THERE ARE WAYS FOR.

IN CONFLICTS IN THE
MIDDLE EAST BUT HE HAS SAID HIS
VIEW HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

BUT TODAY OR YESTERDAY,
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TO CONFRONT
THIS VISUAL BEFORE HIS OWN EYES
ON HIS WATCH.
