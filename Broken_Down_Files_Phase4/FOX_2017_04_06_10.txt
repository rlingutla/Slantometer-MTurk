WHO FILLS THE VOID THAT BASHAR
AL-ASSAD HAS HELD.

WE DON'T HAVE THE TYPE.

THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THIS SIDE,
THE AMERICANS ARE ON THE OTHER.

OBVIOUSLY REGIME CHANGE IS A
HUGE OCCUPATION OF SYRIA AND A
MASSIVE GROUND WAR IN WHICH YOU
MENTIONED THERE'S SO MANY SIDES
AND PROXY FIGHTS GOING ON.

NOW THIS PRESIDENT SAYS WE NEED
TO ACT.

WOULD THE RUSSIANS ALLOW A NO
FLY ZONE?

THAT IS A HOAX.

WHAT DO THE ADMINISTRATION
THINKS THEY CAN GET THE RUSSIANS
TO DO?

THE WORLD WANTS TO STOP IT.

THEY SAID THE POISON GAS ATTACK
INJURED HUNDREDS MORE.

WE KNOW THEY'VE BEEN BACKING
THIS REGIME, FIGHTING ITS OWN
PEOPLE, NOT ISIS.

SHEP, YOU POINT OUT CORRECTLY
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A
LONG TIME.

AL-ASSAD HAS BEEN MURDERING HIS
OWN PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME.

BOTH TO FIRST DEFEAT ISIS WITHIN
SYRIA, TO STABILIZE THE SYRIAN
COUNTRY TO AVOID FURTHER CIVIL
WAR AND TO WORK COLLECTIVELY
WITH OUR PARTNERS AROUND THE
WORLD THROUGH A POLITICAL
PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO
AL-ASSAD LEAVING.

RE LENTLESSLY.

WHO IS IN CHARGE?

THEY ARE BACKING THIS BRUTAL
DICTATOR WHO IS MURDERING HIS
PEOPLE AND DON'T INTEND TO BACK
DOWN.

THE PRESSURE WILL BE ON THEM TO
WEIGH-IN ON THIS.

HE RESCUED PRESIDENT OBAMA IN
2013 SO THAT HE COULD RETREAT
FROM HIS THREAT OF AIR STRIKES
WITH THIS DEAL HE NEGOTIATED TO
GET ALL THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS OUT
OF SYRIA.

RELATIVES SAID THEY HAD THE
FUNERAL TODAY BECAUSE IT WOULD
WITH HIS WIFE, ANNIE.
