I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A
PLAN TOGETHER.

TAKE MUCH MORE TRAFFIC
CONGESTION HERE FOR SURE.

CERTAINLY WILL TAKE SOME
TIME.

AND A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE
DONE, OF COURSE.

THE HOMEOWNER THERE SAYS
THAT HIS WIFE AND TWO
CHILDREN RODE THE STORM OUT
IN THEIR BATHTUB.

AND CHILDREN ARE A LOT OF
WORK FOR A LOT OF FOLKS
AROUND HERE NOW.

THIS IS THE MEDICAL CENTER
OVER HERE.

THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF HER
HOME SEARCHING FOR HER DOG.

CAN YOU DONATED TO THE RED
CROSS IF YOU LIKE OR THE
SALVATION ARMY, OF COURSE,
ONLINE OR BY PHONE.

I'M SHEPARD SMITH THE DAY
AFTER THE STORM IN THE
MIDDLE OF NEIGHBORHOOD
KINGS MANOR AND TELEPHONE
ROAD PICKING UP THE PIECES
SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS.

TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FROM
RELATIVES OF CHILDREN WHO
SURVIVED THE TORNADO'S
DIRECT HIT ON THAT SCHOOL
PLAZA ELEMENTARY AS I
REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS
NEWSCAST OFFICIALS TELL US
AT LEAST SEVEN CHILDREN
DIED IN THAT SCHOOL.

SOME ARE COMING HERE TO
SLEEP SOME TO REST.

INTERESTING AS WELL
BECAUSE CRAIG FUGATE WAS
NOT IN THIS BRIEFING WITH
THE PRESIDENT ONLY BECAUSE
HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY
TO OKLAHOMA.

BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT WAS
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ALL
TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT HOPE.

IN THAT SAME SITUATION.

IT'S ALSO CREATED A WEB
SITE SO IF YOU WANT TO
CONNECT WITH PEOPLE
SEARCHING FOR LOVED ONES IN
THE WAKE OF THE STORM, YOU
CAN.

HE SAYS HE HAS ALREADY
SIGNED A DISASTER
DECLARATION TO GET THINGS
MOVING RIGHT AWAY.

SHE HAD A BAD FEELING.

IT STILL COULD RISE BUT AT
LEAST WE BELIEVE NOW 24
ADDITIONAL CHILDREN DID NOT
DIE.

WE ARE STAYING IN A
HOTEL ON NORTH MERIDIAN.
