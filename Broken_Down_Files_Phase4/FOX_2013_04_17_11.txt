ALTHOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS LATER DENYING
REPORTS OF AN ARREST.

VICTORIA VERY VERY MUCH
WANTS TO THANK TYLER
PERSONALLY SO.

JUST MINUTES AGO A FEDERAL
SOURCE TELLING FOX NEWS
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING
FOR TWO PERSONS OF INTEREST
IN CONNECTION WITH MONDAY'S
ATTACK.

NO WORD NOW IF THE
PRESIDENT INTENDS TO VISIT
WITH THE VICTIMS AND/OR
THEIR FAMILIES, BILL.

MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS NOW ON
GUN CONTROL.

THAT'S THE LATEST ON THE
BOSTON BOMBINGS.

FIRST ON THE BOMBING HERE
IN BOSTON.

THAT'S COMING UP AS FOX
REPORTS LIVE TONIGHT FROM
BOSTON.

NOW, BOTH MEN CAPTURED IN
PHOTOS FROM THE SCENE.

IT WAS PACKED WITH NAILS
AND BALL BEARINGS AND WE
HAVE SEEN THE PHOTOS OF
THOSE NAILS AND BALL
BEARINGS.

CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES
TELLING FOX NEWS THAT THE
FBI DID NOT BRIEF THE FULL
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE AS EXPECTED.

THE THREAT OF AN IMPROVISED
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE HERE IN
THE U.S. IS UNFORTUNATELY
NOT NEW.

IF IT DOES DURING THIS
BROADCAST, WE WILL
CERTAINLY BRING THAT TO YOU
LIVE.
