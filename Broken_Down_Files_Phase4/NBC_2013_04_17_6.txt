YOU KNOW, BOSTON IS NOT GOING
TO BE INTIMIDATED BY THIS.

COME ON, PUPPY.

LAST NIGHT THE YANKS WERE
PLAYING THEIR SONG.

AND THIS CAN HAVE A BAD EFFECT
ON AN INVESTIGATION.

SHOWING THE PRESSURE COOKER
DEFORMED BY THE BLAST, ONE OF
ITS LIDS BLOWN TO THE TOP OF A
NEARBY BUILDING.

I'M HOPING IT'S NOT REAL.

THEY ARE A WELCOME SIGN WHEN
THEY ARRIVE ON THE SCENE -- THE
THERAPY DOGS WHO SHOW UP TO
COMFORT THE HUMANS WHO HAVE BEEN
THROUGH A TRAUMA.

BOSTON IS BACK AT ITS NORMAL
ROUTINE, DOCTORS ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL
RECOVERY WILL TAKE NOT ONLY
MONTHS BUT MOST LIKELY YEARS,
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO WILL
SUFFER WITH POST TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER.

ABSOLUTELY.

MY STRESS LEVEL HAS GONE WAY
DOWN.

GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

ABOUT THAT RAPID SPEED AND
OPTIMISM, PETE WILLIAMS, THANKS.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW.

THIS IS LUTHER.

OH, MY GOODNESS!

HE'S A SMALL YORKIE TERRIER.

IT DOES ONE MORE THING.

OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY ARE CLOSE
TO THE ANSWER OF WHO DID THIS
AND WHY IN AN INVESTIGATION
THAT'S MOVING VERY RAPIDLY ON
SEVERAL FRONTS.

DOGS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH
OTHER RECOVERING CHILDREN IN
NEWTOWN, CONNECTICUT.

I HAVE A FRACTURED SHIN BONE
AND A FRACTURED HEEL BONE FROM
THE SHRAPNEL THAT HIT IT.
