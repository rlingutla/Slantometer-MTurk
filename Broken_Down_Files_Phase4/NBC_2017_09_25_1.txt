WHAT'S IT LIKE FLYING
INTO THE HURRICANE
ZONES IN TERMS OF WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING OUT THE
WINDOW WHEN YOU'RE
DESCENDING?

AND TO SEE IT JUST
DESTROYED IN JUST A
FEW HOURS IS REALLY
SAD, BUT WE ARE A
CHURCH OF HOPE.

GAS STATIONS.

THEY'RE TRYING TO GET
IT LINKED INTO THE FAA
SYSTEM.

WE SPEND MOST OF
THE TIME TRYING TO DO
THIS OVERSEAS, OVER IN
A WAR ZONE.

IT'S A LITTLE
DISTRACTING, TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

A LOT OF THE
FACILITIES THAT WE USE
TO NAVIGATE AREN'T UP.

SEE THE RAMP IS LINED
WITH PLANES FROM
NATIONAL GUARD UNITS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
KENTUCKY AND TEXAS AND
MISSOURI.

THE MARINES ARE
HERE, THE MARINES ARE
LANDING.

WHILE IT'S NOT A
THREAT TO MAKE
LANDFALL IN THE U.S.,
TROPICAL STORM FORCE
WINDS ARE EXPECTED ON
THE OUTER BANKS OF
NORTH CAROLINA.

ANTONIO FONT RUNS THIS
MASSIVE CHURCH THAT
HIS FATHER BUILT AND

AND THIS WOMAN HASN'T
BEEN ABLE TO REACH HER
FAMILY IN
INDIANAPOLIS.

THE U.S. MILITARY
DELIVERING
HUMANITARIAN AID,
LAUNCHING RELIEF

KEARSARGE" BY AIR AND
SEA.

THIS WILL NOT
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

OR PEOPLE JUST A SHORT
DISTANCE FROM US
GATHERED IN A LONG
LINE FOR A RESTAURANT
ABLE TO SERVE FOOD.

TO HELP CLEAR ROADS.

IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP,
WE'VE PUT A LIST OF
ORGANIZATIONS ON OUR
WEBSITE.

ALSO A 2 TO 4-FOOT
STORM SURGE AND
DANGEROUS SURF BEFORE
THIS STORM TURNS
FURTHER OUT TO SEA.

THIS WOMAN SNAGGING
WATER FROM THE SIDE OF
A MOUNTAIN.

OUR FIRST LOOK AT
GROUND ZERO WHERE
HURRICANE MARIA MADE
LANDFALL, AND WE'RE
WITH THE MILITARY AMID
A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN
CRISIS LIKE FEW WE'VE
EVER SEEN BEFORE.
