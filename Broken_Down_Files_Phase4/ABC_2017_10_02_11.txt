WE HAVE THE EAST ROOM SECURE.

THE MUSIC SUDDENLY MIXING WITH
THE SOUND OF BULLETS.

COMING FROM AT LEAST ONE RIFLE
FUNCTIONING LIKE AN AUTOMATIC
MACHINE GUN.

MANHATTAN BEACH POLICE RECORDS
TECHNICIAN, LOST HER LIFE.

THE PACKED CROWD, 1,100 FEET
AWAY, PROVIDING A SHOOTING
GALLERY FOR THE KILLER, WITH A
CROWD OF EASY TARGETS REQUIRING
LITTLE SKILL.

PADDOCK TOOK BRIEF PAUSES,
LIKELY TO SWITCH WEAPONS OR
RELOAD.

THE MANDALAY BAY RESORT ON THE
HOW DID THEY DO THIS?

THIS IS A CLASSIC WMD, THIS

FIRST 90 SECONDS OF THE
MASSACRE, HEARING NEARLY 200
ROUNDS FIRED.

TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING THE
NAMES OF THOSE WHO LOST THEIR
LIVES AT THE CONCERT HERE
OVERNIGHT.

THERE WAS A LOT OF PAIN ON THE
CAMPUS TODAY.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LINING UP FOR
BLOCKS TO DONATE BLOOD TONIGHT.

POLICE DISCOVERING AN ARSENAL
OF WEAPONS.

FOR SAFETY, ANYWHERE, EVEN A
STRANGER'S CAR.

AS THIS WAS HAPPENING, THE LAS
VEGAS S.W.A.T.

WE JUST SAW A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
THAT NEEDED HELP, SO, WE JUST
STARTED PILING THEM UP IN THE
TRUCK.

TURN AROUND.

JUST A SHORT TIME AGO, THEY
REVEALED AT LEAST 59 NOW KILLED.

PADDOCK'S ONLY REAL PASSION
APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GAMBLING.
