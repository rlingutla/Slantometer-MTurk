SEE ME.

MAYOR GOODMAN.

BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
CENTER AND THE TOUR THE
PRESIDENT TOOK.

HE ALSO POINTS OUT AND WE SHOULD
POINT THIS OUT, THE REASON THE
BUMP STOPS ARE LEGAL IN NEVADA
IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T PHYSICALLY
ALTER THE WEAPON.

IT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL
FATIGUE, EITHER.

FOLKS SITTING AROUND, WAITING TO
MEET THE PRESIDENT,
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AS HE MAKES
THE ROUNDS THERE IN LAS VEGAS.

THEY WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT
AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS ARRIVING
TO HELP IN THIS SITUATION WOULD
BECOME VICTIMS.

THERE'S GOING TO BE PEOPLE ON
ONE SAID THAT SAY WE NEED MORE
GUN CONTROL MEASURES, PEOPLE ON
THE OTHER SIDE THAT SAYS THERE'S
SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT
THESE SO-CALLED PUMP STOCKS OR
SLIDE STOCKS THAT ALLOW
SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO BE
FIRED AT A HIGH RATE OR OTHER
MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO STOP
PEOPLE FROM CONVERTING THESE WE
POPS INTO A HIGH RATE OF FIRE.

SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE THAT ARE SAYING,
WE DON'T NEED MORE GUN CONTROL
MEASURES.

I JUST VISITED HIM IN THE
HOSPITAL.

WE KNOW THAT WE WILL NEVER EVER
FORGET THIS HORRIFIC EVENT.

YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

THEY SAY THE MURDERER BROUGHT
DANLEY A PLANE TICKET TO THE
PHILIPPINES SO SHE WOULDN'T GET
IN THE WAY OF HIS PLANS.

GO THAT WAY.

WE APPRECIATE THAT.

APPARENTLY TO WATCH FOR POLICE
OR SECURITY GUARDS.

IF YOU EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO TRAFFIC,
THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES ARE
AMAZING.

WE SHOULD KNOW THAT STEPHEN
PADDOCK HAS BEEN COLLECTING GUNS
FOR YEARS.

APPARENTLY NOT.

WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF
PULLING TOGETHER.
