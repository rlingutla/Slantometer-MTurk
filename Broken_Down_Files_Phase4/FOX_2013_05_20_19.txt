WE HAVE NO CELL.

INITIAL REPORTS FROM KFOR
NBC STATION THERE AT LEAST
FOUR PEOPLE KILLED.

AND THE WINDS WERE HOWLING
LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN AS YOU
HAVE HEARD IT SO MANY
TIMES.

WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE
TO WAIT UNTIL THE N S GOES
OUT AND DOES THEIR FINAL
REPORT.

AGAIN, WE CAN'T CONFIRM
WHAT HAS OR HAS NOT
HAPPENED THERE.

[CRYING]
 YES SIR.

BUT OUR HOPE WAS THAT THE
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAD
BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SHELTER
AND THAT THE LOSS OF LIFE
WOULD BE MINIMIZED.

AND LIVE PICTURES THAT ARE
COMING IN FROM THE SEARCH
AND RESCUE OPERATIONS.

SO THEY WERE PAYING
ATTENTION.

TO THAT THE GOVERNOR SAID
THE COMMUNICATIONS IS THE
BIGGEST PROBLEM.

WE DO NOT YET KNOW HOW MANY
COUNTLESS LIVES THAT SAVED.

A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ON FOOT
AND THERE IS A LOT OF
PEOPLE INJURED --
YOU.

IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE
DEVASTATION.

IN ADDITION, THE MAYOR OF
OKLAHOMA CITY NEARBY, THIS
IS A SUBURB OF SORTS
SENDING ITS EMERGENCY
RESPONSE RESOURCES TO THIS
AREA TO HELP.

AND IS NOW IN MOORE.

THERE IS A RED CAR UP ON
TOP OF THE SCHOOL THAT WAS
TOSSED THERE THERE IS
CHILDREN ALL OVER THE
PLACE.

BARK RIPPED OFF THE TREES.

CASEY, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

THERE WERE WARNINGS, 16
MINUTES BEFORE THE TORNADO
HIT MOORE OKLAHOMA.

A HOME AFTER HOME BUSINESS
AFTER BUSINESS.
