QUIVERING
UNCONTROLLABLY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
CALLING IT AN AFRONT
TO HUMANITY.

TONIGHT, SHOCK
WAVES, NEW IMAGES OF
CHILDREN CAUGHT IN THE
HORRIFIC ATTACK IN
SYRIA.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
THE IMAGES OF THE
VICTIMS MADE A DEEP
IMPRESSION ON HIM.

HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN
HAVE TO DIE BEFORE
THE PRESIDENT RESPOND
WITH MILITARY ACTION?

PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO
CAME TO OFFICE WITH A
PROMISE OF AMERICA
FIRST NOW SEEMS LIKE
HE WANTS TO BE MORE
INVOLVED IN WORLD
AFFAIRS.

CONFRONTING ASSAD
MEANS CHALLENGING HIS
BIGGEST BACKER,
RUSSIA.
