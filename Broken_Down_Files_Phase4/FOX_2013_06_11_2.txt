MEANTIME THE AMERICAN CIVIL
LIBERTIES UNION REPORTS
THAT IT IS SUING THE
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
OVER ITS MONITORING OF THE
PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS
OF AMERICANS.

7 MILLION PEOPLE IN THAT
CITY, 65,000 HOTEL ROOMS.

SO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
CANNOT PULL THE EQUIVALENT
OF A BAIT AND SWITCH IN
THIS CASE.

HE LEFT THREE WEEKS AGO.

WHAT ARE THE OTHER
ARGUMENTS OF THIS LAWSUIT
TRACE.

IF THEY WANT TO GET YOU
THEY WILL GET NEW TIME.

FOX NEWS HAS ALSO TOLD
THE INVESTIGATION IS
CONSIDERING WHETHER SNOWDEN
HAD HELP BUT AT THIS EARLY
STAGE THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT
SUGGEST THAT, SHEP.

BUT THERE ARE DOZENS OF
STORIES GENERATED BY THE
DOCUMENTS THAT HE PROVIDED.

LATEST ON POTENTIAL
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST
THE LEAKER?

LEAKER HAS A LOT MORE TO
LEAK.

HE ONCE TOLD THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER THAT HE DOES NOT
EXPECT TO BE FREE FOREVER
THOUGH, LISTEN.

NOW, THE RUSSIANS SAY
THEY MAY GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

SO FAR NO RESPONSE.

THE PRESIDENT OUTLINED LAST
WEEK THAT THESE WERE
IMPORTANT NATIONAL SECURITY
PROGRAMS TO HELP KEEP
AMERICANS SAFE AND GIVE US
TOOLS TO FIGHT THE
TERRORIST THREAT THAT WE
FACE.

PRESIDENT PUTIN SAYS IF THE
REQUEST IS MADE IT WILL BE
CONSIDERED.

TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM, HE
WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO GO TO
THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE IN
HONG KONG SNOWDEN WOULD
HAVE TO APPLY.

CONSULTING GIANT BOOZ
ALLEN HAMILTON SAYS IT
FORMALLY TERMINATED SNOWDEN
FOR VIOLATION OF THE FIRM'S
CODE OF ETHICS AND THE
FIRM'S POLICY.

AS PART OF THIS
INVESTIGATION THAT HOME
WILL BE SEARCHED AND HIS
GIRLFRIEND WILL BE
QUESTIONED.

AND NOW THERE IS WORD THAT
RUSSIA MIGHT BE WILLING TO
GIVE HIM ASYLUM.

BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS
TUESDAY NIGHT, A WORLDWIDE
MANHUNT FOR THE NSA LEAKER
AND THE LAWYERS ARE ALREADY
HARD AT WORK.
