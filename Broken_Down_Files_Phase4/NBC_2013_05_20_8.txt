YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING WELL INTO
THE NIGHT.

THERE IS STILL GAS.

WE COULDN'T REACH FOR IT.

OF PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.

WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE
HONEST.

YOU CAN SEE SEARCH AND RESCUE
CREWS CONTINUING TO TREAT THE
KIDS THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL.

HE SAID THE TEACHERS TOOK ALL
THE SCHOOL KIDS INTO THE MIDDLE,
THE CENTER PART OF THE SCHOOL,
PUT THEM ON INTERIOR WALLS AND
AS FAR AS HE KNOWS EVERY SINGLE
TEACHER AND STUDENT IS ACCOUNTED
FOR.

AGAIN, I TOLD YOU A FEW MINUTES
I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF KIDS
THAT WERE IN THIS SCHOOL AT THE
TIME.

WATCH THE TIME.

FROM THE AIR, IT IS HARD TO KNOW
AT TIMES JUST WHAT IT IS WE ARE
LOOKING AT.

YOU CAN SEE AGAIN -- WE HAVE
SAID IT BEFORE FROM THE AIR --
THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.

WIND EASILY OVER 200 MILES PER
HOUR.

THERE WAS STILL DAYLIGHT
THERE.

THAT'S CENTRAL TIME.

TO BE HONEST.

IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT WE SAW
AFTER KATRINA WHEN THE 25-FOOT
STORM SURGE HIT THE COAST.

ALL YOU SEE IS CONCRETE SLABS.

THEY WERE LITERALLY HUGGING THE
WALLS OF THE INTERIOR HALLWAYS
AS THAT TORNADO WENT OVERHEAD,
TRYING TO SURVIVE.

LIVE PICTURES COMING INTO US
TONIGHT.

THEY REPORT COMMUTES OF TWO OR
THREE HOURS TO GET 12 OR 14
MILES.
