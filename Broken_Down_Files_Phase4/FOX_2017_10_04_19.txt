IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE WANTS TO
HOLD UP AS AN EXAMPLE NOT ONLY
TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT
THE WORLD AS WELL TO SAY THIS IS
HOW WE RESPOND TO TRAGEDY IN
AMERICA AND HOPEFULLY TAKE STEPS
TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING LIKE THIS
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

OFFICER HARTFIELD WAS A PROUD
VETERAN, A DEVOTED HUSBAND, A
LOVING FATHER.

I WILL TELL YOU, THE PEOPLE OF
NEVADA AND THE EXTRAORDINARY
CITY HAVE SHOWN THE WORLD THEIR
INCREDIBLE CHARACTER, COURAGE
AND RESOLVE.

EVEN REPUBLICANS ARE
DESCRIBING THIS AS A LOOP HOLE,
ONE THAT THEY CAN CLOSE QUICKLY.

PARENTS AND SPOUSES USED THEIR
OWN BODIES AS SHIELDS TO PROTECT
LOVES ONES.

I WAS ILL.
MADE ME ILL TO THINK THAT WE HAD
INTERACTED WITH HIM AND HE
COMMITTED A TRAGEDY.

GET DOWN, GET DOWN!

AT ONE POINT WE HEARD ON POLICE
RADIOS THEM TELLING PEOPLE TO
GET OFF OF NORTH LAS VEGAS
BOULEVARD BECAUSE THEY REALIZED
WHERE THE SHOTS WERE COMING FROM
IN THE NORTH TOWER OF MANDALAY
BAY.

JOHN, A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED
REST IN THAT CITY, ESPECIALLY
THE ONES WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO
HAVE BEEN MIGHTY GLAD TO SEE THE
PRESIDENT.

THANK YOU TO OUR POLICE, OUR
FIREFIGHTERS AND TO OUR FIRST
RESPONDERS AND OF COURSE TO
SHERIFF LOMBARDO.

MEN AND WOMEN THAT STEPPED
FORWARD TO SAVE OTHERS.

WE WERE HOPING HE WOULD COME
BACK IN TO TALK WITH US, GIVE US
THOUGHTS ABOUT TODAY AND MAYBE
TALK ABOUT OTHER NEWS OF THE DAY
AND THE ISSUES SWIRLING AROUND
THIS INCREASINGLY LOUD VOICES ON
CAPITOL HILL.

THEY'RE MAKING AN ARGUMENT
THAT IS REASONABLE THAT THE TIME
TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IS
WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND VICTIMS
FAMILIES ARE GRIEVING AND WANT
SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.

THESE ARE CITIZEN HEROS, SHEP
THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO
HONOR.

AND EVERYONE ELSE, PERFECT
STRANGERS AND HOW THEY RESPONDED
TO THIS AND GAVE LOVE AND
ASSISTANCE TO THEIR FELLOW MAN.

LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT RAN INTO
THE BULLETS TO PIN DOWN THE
MANDALAY BAY BEHIND ME AND MANY
CIVILIANS, SOME OF WHO GAVE
THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT OTHER
PEOPLE AND STORIES OF PEOPLE
GRABBING PICKUPS OFF OF THE
STREETS, FILLING THE BEDS WITH
THE WOUNDED AND TAKING THEM TO
THE HOSPITAL.

IS KNOWLEDGE.

THAT BRINGS THE DEATH TOLL TO
59.

MAY THEY GIVE THEM PEACE, GOD
BLESS OUR STATE AND THE NATION,
THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.

AMERICANS DENIED DEATH AND
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH
COURAGE.
