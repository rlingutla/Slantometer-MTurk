MARYLAND DECLINED TO COMMENT BUT
A NEIGHBOR SAID HE WAS ALWAYS AT
HIS COMPUTER AS A YOUNG MAN.

LEAKS OF SENSITIVE CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION THAT CAUSE HARM TO
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST
ARE A PROBLEM.

THAT'S PART OF A GROWING PROBLEM
UNDERSCORED BY THIS CASE IN
WHICH WHEN EVERYTHING IS SECRET
IT'S HARD TO KEEP THE TRUE AND
IMPORTANT SECRETS SECRET.

I SITTING AT MY DESK
CERTAINLY HAVE THE AUTHORITIES
TO WIRE TAP ANYONE FROM YOU OR
YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A FEDERAL
JUDGE TO EVEN A PRESIDENT IF I
HAD A PERSONAL E-MAIL.

HE'S BEING PURSUED BECAUSE HE
REVEALED SECRETS USED TO TRACK
TERRORISTS.

UNDER SUSPICION UNTIL HE
DISAPPEARED FROM HIS JOB AS A
TECHNICIAN AT THE NSA IN HAWAII
MEDICAL LEAVE FOR EP LEPSY.

HOW DANGEROUS IS IT?

STARTING WITH NSA SECURITY
GUARD, FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF
FAILED ATTEMPT TO BECOME A
SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER.

UNTIL HE CHECKED OUT SOME TIME
TODAY, EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS BEEN
HOLED UP IN LUXURY FOR THREE
WEEKS IN HONG KONG AT THE MEARA
HOTEL, ACCORDING TO EMPLOYEES
THERE.

HE TOLD THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER
HE KNEW THE U.S. WOULD BE COMING
AFTER HIM, MAYBE EVEN WITH HIT
TEAMS.

EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE 29-YEAR-OLD
WHISTLE BLOWER BEHIND THAT
MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE BREACH AT
THE NSA.

HE SAYS HE CHOSE TO GO TO HONG
KONG BECAUSE IT HAS A HISTORY OF
ALLOWING FREE SPEECH.

IT INGESTS THEM BY DEFAULT.

SCRAMBLING TO FIND HIM THERE ARE
REPORTS HE'S PREPARING TO MAKE
PUBLIC EVEN MORE OF THE NATION'S
MOST CLOSELY GUARDED SECRETS.

THE NSA SPECIFICALLY TARGETS
THE COMMUNICATIONS OF EVERYONE.

NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
SURVEILLANCE AND COLLECTIONS
THEIR GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING
OUT.

ONE DAY HE WAS THERE, THE
NEXT HE WAS GONE.

TONIGHT HE SAID HE'S A
TARGET AND ON THE MOVE, HIDDEN
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SHROUDED IN
MYSTERY AND DRAMA.

THEN FOUR YEARS AS A CIVILIAN
CONTRACTOR WORKING WITH
COMPUTERS AT THE NSA IN JAPAN,
WASHINGTON AND HAWAII WHERE HE
SAYS HE DECIDED TO BLOW THE
WHISTLE ON WHAT HE CALLS THE
ABUSE OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF
AMERICA.

HOW ONE YOUNG MAN GOT HIS HANDS
ON MANY OF THE NATION'S TOP
SECRETS.
