BENEFIT CONCERT.

IN HOPES, IN HOPES THAT
THEY COULD GET SOME OUT
ALIVE.

GREW UP FOUR BLOCKS FROM
WHERE WE ARE AT.

I'M PROUD OF THAT.

IT'S ALMOST DIFFICULT TO
BELIEVE.

IT WAS LIKE YOU GO TO THAT
RESTAURANT WHERE THE
PORTIONS ARE SO LARGE THAT
YOU EAT FOR 30 MINUTES AND
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING.

POLICE HAVE REJOINT
EXHIBITED MEDIA ACCESS TO
SOME OF THE HARDEST HIT
NEIGHBORHOODS SO GET IN
THERE TO CLEAN UP AND
RESTORING THE POWER.

THE DAMAGE WAS EXTENSIVE.

SCHOOL AREA NOW AND AS HE
ZOOMS, IN YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR
AREA HOMES WERE REDUCED TO
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL HEAD
HERE ON SUNDAY TO SEAT
DAMAGE FOR HIMSELF.

HEARTLAND NEWSCAST.

THE OKLAHOMA STATE MEDICAL
EXAMINER SAYS 10 OF THE

EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOU
COME TOGETHER AS ONE AND
PUT EVERYTHING ASIDE AND
YOU GET IT BACK UP AND
RUNNING.

WELL, THERE WASN'T AN
OPTION.
