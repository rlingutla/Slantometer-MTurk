[INAUDIBLE] VICTIMS AND
ESPECIALLY WHENEVER THEY
ARE CHILDREN.

BUZZING AROUND RECENTLY
ONLY EMERGENCY HELICOPTERS
SHEPARD.

SEVERAL CHILDREN HAVE NOW
BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE
RUBBLE ALIVE IN ONE OF
THESE SCHOOLS.

WE HAVE GOTTEN WORD FROM
THE MAYOR OF MOORE THAT
MUCH OF THE TOWN IS
DESTROYED.

I CAR IS GONE.

WE NOW KNOW THAT ALL OF THE
CHILDREN ARE ACCOUNTED FOR
AT ONE OF THOSE TWO
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

THE REST OF THE NEWS IS NOT
AS GOOD AS WE WOULD HOPE
BUT FOUR DEAD AT 7/11 STORE
THERE FOUR MORE DEAD AS
THEY TRIED TO GET INTO A
FREEZE TORE ESCAPE THIS
STORM DEFICIT ALL AROUND.

IT MEANS WINDS OF BETWEEN
166 AND 200 MILES PER HOUR.

THIS AFTERNOON'S STORM HIT
AROUND 300 LOCAL TIME AND
ON THE GROUND FOR 45
MINUTES.

IT IS A SCENE OF CHAOS.

GLEN LEWIS.

MY BATHROOM HONESTLY SUN
TOUCHED.

THEY HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO
DO SO.

THAT'S WHAT WE SAW ON THE
NEWS.

106-ACRE FARM THERE WHERE
75 TO 100 HORSES WERE
EITHER TAKEN AWAY BY THIS
STORM OR KILLED BY THIS
STORM.

WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING AS
RESCUE WORKERS CLAD IN
YELLOW CLIMB OVER THE
DEBRIS THAT WAS THE SCHOOL.

SO IF YOU ARE IN THAT PART
OF THE WORLD PROBABLY THE
FIRST THING YOU CAN DO IS
TO GET A PLAN TOGETHER FOR
HOW TO BE SAFE.

CASEY?

THEY ARE HOT.

ANDREA YOU LIVE JUST A
SHORT WHILE FROM HERE.
