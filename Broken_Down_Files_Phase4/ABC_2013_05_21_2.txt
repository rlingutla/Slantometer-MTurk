LANDO HEIGHTS SURVIVED IN A
HORSE STALL AT THE FARM AND
TELLS KFOR, THERE WERE AT LEAST
80 HORSES, HE WAS WORRIED.

HOW DID ALL THE CHILDREN THERE
GET OUT WHEN SOME OF THE
STUDENTS AT PLAZA TOWERS DID
NOT?

AND OKLAHOMANS KNOW IN GENERAL,
INCLUDING THE PEOPLE IN TORNADO
ALLEY, AS WE KNOW IT, THEY GOT A
BETTER SHOT THAN MOST OF THE
WORLD AT SEEING TORNADOES.

AND TODAY WE WENT TO FIND THEM.

WAY, SHERRY URGED HER FIRST
GRADERS TO USE THEIR BACKPACKS
AS SHIELDS.

AT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY, THEY
ALL GOT OUT.

HER ONE IN 100 TRILLION ODDS.

THAT WE LOVE EACH OTHER, AND WE
TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

NO, I WAS HERE IN '99.

HE TOOK ME DOWN THE STAIRWELL
THAT SAVED HIS FAMILY'S LIFE.

WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT FAMILY TO YOU?

HE WAS SO GOOD.

EARLIER I SPOKE TO THEM ABOUT
WHAT THEY DID.

YOU KNOW, WHEN THEIR PARENTS
WEREN'T THERE, KIND OF WANDERING
AROUND.

THEY SAY IT WENT COMPLETELY
SILENT IN THAT BUNKER WHEN THE
TORNADO STOPPED DOING ITS
DAMAGE.

POWERFUL, DEAFENING, 600 TIMES
THE STRENGTH OF AN ATOMIC BOMB,
FLATTENING THAT ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL WITH CHILDREN TAKING
SHELTER INSIDE.

THERE'S A REASON.

WE LEAVE YOU NOW WITH A SYMBOL
OF RESILIENCE.

PICTURE OF THE MOMENTS BEFORE
THE TORNADO TOOK AIM AT TWO
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS.

A LITTLE GIRL'S PANTS RIGHT
HERE.
