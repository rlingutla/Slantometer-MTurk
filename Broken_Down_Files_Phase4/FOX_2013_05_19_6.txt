WE HAD OUR VERY OWN TASTE OF
THAT WITH EMILY EARLIER.

WIND DAMAGE AND TORNADO DAMAGE
AS WELL.

THE RADAR IS PICKING UP DEBRIS
FLYING AROUND THE RADAR.

I KNOW YOU TOOK SOME
PICTURES OF THIS.

I MEAN WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES AS
I SAID SOUTH OF NORMAN AND IT
IS SUNNY.

IT IS TERRIFYING.

PEOPLE HAD THEIR PLANS.

WE ARE AT THE TOP OF THE
HEATING OF THEIR DAY AND IT
GETS TOUGHER FROM HERE INTO THE
NIGHT UNTIL THINGS COOL DOWN.

WE DID HEAR SIRENS BUT MORE
IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT ALL OF
THE LOCAL NEWS STATIONS HAVE
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR THE
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS ACTUALLY
AND AS IT GETS CLOSER TO THE
TIME THEY GET MORE AND MORE
ACCURATE WITH THE BROADCASTS.

UNFORTUNATELY, AS THIS STORM
MOVES EASTWARD AND ONE OF THE
INGREDIENTS THAT WE NEED IT THE
VERY WARM UNSTABLE AIR MASS.

DID YOU SEE BLUE SKY THERE'S ON
THE BACK END OF THIS.

EVERYBODY KNEW IT WAS COMING
TODAY SO EVERYBODY IS GLUED TO
THE TELEVISION AND THE RADIO.

I GREW UP IN THE THE
MIDWEST.

IT IS SURREAL.

UP TOWARDS KANSAS.

NOW, IT IS GETTING LATER IN THE
EVENING AND THINGS GETTING MORE
DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF HEATING
INDEX THAT HAPPENS IN THE
LATERITE PART OF THE DAY.

LOOK UP AND ONE CLOUD HEADING
ONE DIRECTION AND ANOTHER ARE
CLOUD HEADING THE OTHER.

WE SHOULD BE ON DOPPLER 3
MILLENNIUM QUICKLY PLEASE.

HOW ABOUT FOUR INCH OF FROST
SIZED HAIL.

SO MUCH STUFF COMING IN TO FOX
NEWS AND PUT AS MUCH ON THE
SCREEN FOR YOU AS POSSIBLE.
