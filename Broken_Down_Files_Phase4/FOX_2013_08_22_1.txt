YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

THEN THIS.

THERE IS VIDEO THAT PURPORTS TO
SHOW VICTIMS OF YESTERDAY'S
POISON GAS ATTACK.

THE FRENCH AMONG THE LEADING
NATIONS IN TERMS OF ISSUING
STRONG STATEMENTS.

I SPOKE TO ONE LEADING MIDDLE
EAST EXPERT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY TO ASK HIM
WHAT EXACTLY HE BELIEVED
HAPPENED.

SOME NATIONS HAVE LOOKED AT THIS
AND SAID, WE'VE GOT TO ACT.

NAILING DOWN THE FACTS WILL
INCLUDE LOOKING AT THIS VIDEO,
WHICH APPEARS TO SHOW SCORES OF
PEOPLE KILLED AND BEING TREATED
WITH NO SIGNS OF THE SORT OF
PHYSICAL TRAUMA THERE MIGHT BE
IF IT HAD BEEN A NORMAL SORT OF
BOMB ATTACK.

THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID TODAY
THAT IF INDEED IT IS
DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED THIS WAS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED BY THE
SYRIAN REGIME, THEN THERE MUST
BE A REACTION OF FORCE AS HE PUT
IT.

DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF
CHILDREN DEAD ON THE FLOOR WITH
NO WOUNDS, JUST LYING DEAD.

HE SAID 100% THIS IS THE WORK OF
THE GOVERNMENT REGIME.

WE'RE BEING EXTERMINATED.

HE SAID ASSAD TRIES TO CREATE A
NEW BALANCE OF FEAR WITH THE BYF
GAS AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

OF COURSE IT'S NOT BEEN
CONFIRMED.

YEAH, NOT JUST REFUSING TO
POINT FINGERS IN TERMS OF BLAME,
SHEP, BUT ACTUALLY SAYING THEY
HAVE NOT DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDED
THERE WAS A CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK.

THAT'S WHAT ONE SYRIAN TOLD THE
REUTERS NEWS SERVICE TODAY.

BIGGEST STOCKPILES OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS INCLUDING SARIN GAS,
MUSTARD GAS, AND MANY EXPERTS
WHO LOOKED THAT THE VIDEO
BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN SARIN.

OTHER NATIONS APPEAR TO BE
TAKING A MUCH HARDER LINE.

HE FEELS HE CAN DO IT.

BUT NOW THAT THERE ARE DRAMATIC
NEW CLAIMS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
IS HAPPENING AGAIN.

THE GOVERNMENT DENIES USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS, BUT IS
REFUSING TO LET UNITED NATIONS
INSPECTORS SEE IT FOR
THEMSELVES, EVEN THOUGH THOSE
INSPECTORS ARE ALREADY IN
DAMASCUS A FEW SHORT MILES AWAY
TO INVESTIGATE EARLIER CLAIMS OF
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.
