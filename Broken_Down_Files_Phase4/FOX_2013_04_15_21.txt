PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INJURY
HERE IN THE STREETS OF
BOSTON TODAY FROM THIS
EVENT.

THE BOSTON COMMON WHICH IS
VERY CLOSE ALSO TO WHERE
THE RACE ENDS HERE IN
BOSTON.

I RACED BACK TOWARDS THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY WHERE WE HAD
ALL OUR EQUIPMENT TO MAKE
SURE THAT THE GUYS WERE
OKAY.

THERE WAS A FIRE.

IT KNOCKED ME TO THE
GROUND, AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING.

IT WAS REMARKABLE TO WATCH.

IT WAS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN
AT 700.

WE NOW KNOW MEMBERS OF THE
MILITARY ARE NOW INVOLVED
IN THIS INVESTIGATION.

TWO PEOPLE KILLED.

YOU CAN SEE AMBULANCES LINE
UP ALL THE WAY DOWN THIS
STREET.

AND REALLY THE STREETS ARE
JUST BEGINNING TO CLEAR.

AND PEOPLE SHOULDN'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS BEFORE WE
HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

WE ARE HEARING UP TO 24
HOURS.

WHETHER THEY ARE MEMBERS OF
THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION
OR LONE WOLVES.

SHE IS USING THAT WORD.

THE GOAL IS FINDING OUT WHO
DID IT AND WHY.

ORGANIZED INTERNATIONAL
ATTACK?

THEY DON'T NECESSARILY USE
THE TRADITIONAL METHODS OF
TALKING TO EACH OTHER
WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO
INTERCEPT OR TO BLOCK THESES OF EVENTS
IN THE
PAST.

THIS IS FOX NEWS CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF THE ATTACK ON
BEAN TOWN.

IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS AND I
THINK WE ALL LET OUR GUARD
DOWN TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.
