ANN COULTER WRITING
THOSE WHO WANTED US
MEDDLING IN MIDDLE
EAST VOTED FOR OTHER
CANDIDATES AND AN
EDITOR QUESTIONED
ABOUT SIGNS OF UNREST
RESPONDING UNREST, I'M
APAPLEPTIC.

REMEMBER THAT.

FOOTAGE SHOWS SOME
DAMAGE AND DEFIANTLY
FIGHTER JETS TAXIYING
AND TAKING OFF IN
BROAD DAYLIGHT.

REVERBERATIONS ON A
STRIKE ON AN SYRIAN
AIRFIELD ARE GETTING
LOUDER, NOT JUST IN
WORDS BUT IN ACTION.

TODAY THE SECRETARY OF
STATE TILLERSON WHO
NEXT WEEK MEETS WITH
VLADIMIR PUTIN SPOKE
WITH HIS RUSSIAN
COUNTERPART WHO
INSISTED THERE WAS NO
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK IN SYRIA.

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
RICHARD ENGEL IN
STATE TV BROADCASTING
FROM SYRIA AT THE AIR
BASE THAT IS
DESTROYED.

LOCAL RESIDENTS
FILMING IT ON THEIR
CELL PHONES.

RUSSIAN AND SYRIA
MILITARY JETS RESUMED
MISSIONS TODAY.

IT IS GOING TO BE
AMERICA FIRST.

BEAUTIFUL BABIES.

INTERNATIONAL
HEADLINES FROM
FRIENDLY NATIONS,
SLASHED APPROVAL, BUT
INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE
SPLINTERED POWER.

IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE
AIRCRAFT WERE FLOWN BY
SYRIAN OR RUSSIAN
PILOTS, BUT THE
MESSAGE IS CLEAR THE
U.S. STRIKE CHANGED
LITTLE.

THIS IS NOT WHAT WE
VOTED FOR.

JUST SO RUSSIA'S POINT
COULDN'T BE MISSED,
MOSCOW IS SENDING THIS
WAR SHIP, THE ADMIRAL,
ARMED WITH ITS OWN
CRUISE MISSILES TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN.

CHIEF STRATEGIST STEVE
BANNON HAS DESCRIBED
TRUMP'S SON-IN-LAW
JARED KUSHNER AS WEST
WING DEMOCRAT DETACHED
FROM TRUMP'S
CONSERVATIVE BASE.

HE WRITES I HAVE
TRUMP'S BACK.

SUPPORTERS WATCHFUL.

SO THERE IS STILL A
LINE OF COMMUNICATIONS
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES.

I DO NOT THINK HE
SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO
AIR STRIKES, BUT IT
WAS A GOOD WARNING.

ALL OF IT IS A SHARP
WARNING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP, DON'T ATTACK
RUSSIA'S ALLIES AGAIN.
