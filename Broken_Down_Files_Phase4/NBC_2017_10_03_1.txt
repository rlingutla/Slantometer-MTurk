THANK YOU FOR
CONTINUING TO LOOK
AFTER OTHERS IN OUR
COUNTRY.

GENERALLY OPPOSES MORE
REGULATIONS ON THINGS
LIKE BUMP STOCKS.

ANGIE GOMEZ, 20, NEW
JOB AS A NURSING
ASSIST.

HE HAS A SHIRT WITH A
GUNSHOT THROUGH IT.

I LOVE YOU.

TYPICAL GENEROSITY HIS
BROTHER SAID TODAY.

HE HELPED MAKE ME AND
MY FAMILY WEALTHY.

NOT ALL THE FIRST
RESPONDERS SUNDAY
NIGHT WORE UNIFORMS
AND MANY WHO DID WERE
NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT
THEY FACED.

GOOD TIME HAVE A
HEARING.

SHORTLY.

I COULDN'T HELP IT.

IN MESQUITE WHERE HE
LIVED, NEIGHBORS SAY
HE WAS INTENSELY
PRIVATE.

MORE IS KNOWN ABOUT
WORK BACKGROUND,
LETTER CARRIER FOR A
YEAR AND A HALF AND
WORKED AS IRS AGENT
BEFORE HE MADE
MILLIONS IN REAL
ESTATE.

A NEPHEW SPEAKING OUT
TODAY.

TAKE A SHORT
BREAK, WHEN WE COME
BACK, SOME FINAL
THOUGHTS FROM HERE IN
LAS VEGAS.

SHE WAS SURGEON, HE
WAS NURSE.

WE'VE LOCATED HER
OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH
HER AND BELIEVE HER AT
THIS POINT NOT TO BE
INVOLVED.

EVEN IF OUTLAWED
AND RESTRICTED, IT'S
DON'T SELL ANY.

BUT INSPIRING.

SINCE THIS HAS
HAPPENED WE DREW A
CONCLUSION IT WAS GUNS
ENFORCEMENT NOT
CALLING DANLEY A
SUSPECT BUT REMAINS A
PERSON OF INTEREST.
