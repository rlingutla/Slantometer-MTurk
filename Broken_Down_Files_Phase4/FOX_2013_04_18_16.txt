MAYBE ANOTHER PERSON MAYBE
A THIRD PERSON AT THE
SCENE.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY
HAVE A TO BE OF PEOPLE IN
RESERVE AND HAVE THESE
ELECTRONIC THINGS SET UP.

AND SEPTEMBER NEARLY 200
OTHERS TO THE HOSPITAL HERE
IN BOSTON.

BE
DIFFICULT BUT PLEASE COME
FORWARD.

YOU COMPARE THIS, FOR
INSTANCE, IN THE PUBLIC
APPEAL HERE TO THE CASE OF
FIESEL SHAH SAD.

NO ONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO
APPREHEND THEM EXCEPT LAW
ENFORCEMENT.

SOMEONE FROM THE PUBLIC HAS
TO COME FORWARD NOW.

SUSPECT NUMBER 2
HIGHLIGHTED AND PROFILED
THE TWEET READS NOTE
PRONOUNCED JAW NOSE, DARK
HAIR AND THEN 1-800-CALL
FBI WITH INFO.

NO OTHER DETAILS OF THE
INVESTIGATION WILL BE
RELEASED AT THIS TIME
BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FOCUS
NOW.

IF THOSE CAMERAS WEREN'T
THERE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
THE IMAGES OF THESE TWO
GUYS AND IT WOULD BE A LOT
HARDER TO TRACK THEM DOWN.

ALSO ON ITS WEB SITE,
BOSTON MARATHON TIPS DOT
FBI.GOV.

DEPOSIT PEW ADVERTISE THE
GENERAL PUBLIC.

BOY LOST HIS LIFE AND
SISTER LOST HER LEG AND
MOTHER HAS DAMAGE TO HER
BRAIN.

THE FBI RELEASING PHOTOS
AND VIDEO OF TWO MEN
CALLING THEM SUSPECTS AFTER
MONDAY'S MARATHON BOMBINGS.

YEAH.

BUT YOU HEARD FROM THE FEDS
VERY CLEARLY IN THIS PRESS
CONFERENCE THAT SOMEONE OUT
THERE KNOWS WHO THESE
INDIVIDUALS ARE.

TELLING CONGRESS THE
INVESTIGATION IS WIDE OPEN.

THE FBI SAYS IT WILL
CONTINUE TO WORK TO ENHANCE
THE IMAGES THAT IT HAS
BILL.

THE SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE
OF THE BOSTON OFFICE HERE
CAME RIGHT OUT AND USED THE
WORD SUSPECT.

THEY CAN TAKE THEM ANY
PLACE IN THE COUNTRY
THAT'S HOW THEY ARE GOING
TO HANDLE IT.
