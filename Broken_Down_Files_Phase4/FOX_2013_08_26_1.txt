HE SAID PUBLICLY MANY TIMES
HE WOULD NOT COMMIT U.S.

TODAY FOR INSTANCE THEIR
CONVOY LEFT HOTEL IN
CENTRAL DAMASCUS TO HEAD TO
THE SIGHT OF THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK FOR THE
FIRST TIME AND THE CONVOY
WAS FIRED ON BY AT LEAST
ONE SNIPER.

THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION
INVOLVING CREWS MISSILES
THAT WOULD BE SHOT FROM
SUBMARINES.

BUT SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN
KERRY WAS QUICK TO POINT
OUT TODAY THAT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
ANYTHING BUT HELPFUL TO
THOSE INSPECTORS.


JOHN, THAN THE U.N.
WEAPON
INSPECTORS ARE IN SYRIA.

ALSO PRECISION GUIDED
MISSILES.

THAT'S ABOUT THE ONLY
OPTION THE PRESIDENT HAS
RULED OUT.

NOT JUST LAUNCHING CREWS
MISSILES, THEN AGAIN OUR
CREDIBILITY IN THE WORLD IS
DIMINISHED EVEN MORE IF
THERE IS ANY LEFT.

BUT HE DID SAY THAT THERE
WILL BE SOME SORT OF A
RESPONSE THAT IT DEMANDS A
RESPONSE, BUT HE SAID THE
PRESIDENT HAS NOT MADE A
FINAL DECISION YET JON

AND THE WEAPONS INSPECTORS
DID THEN GO ON TO THE
HOSPITAL WHERE THEY
INTERVIEWED SOME OF THE
ALLEGED VICTIMS OF THE
ATTACK AND SOME DOCTORS WHO
HAD TREATED THEM.

ASKED HOW HE BELIEVES IT
MIGHT END FOR THE U.S., HE
SAID WHAT IT SUFFERED IN
ALL ITS WARS FROM VIETNAM
UNTIL NOW FAILURE.

INSTEAD IT ATTACKED THE
AREA FURTHER SHELLING IT
AND SYSTEMATICALLY
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

THOSE QUOTES APPEAR TO BE
AFFIRMATION OF WHAT WE HAVE
SAID MANY TIMES HERE BEFORE
RK JON THAT LONG AGO
PRESIDENT ASSAD DECIDED HE
WILL FIGHT TO WHAT WILL
INEVITABLY BE A BITTER AND
BLOODY END.

AT LEAST ONE REPUBLICAN IS
CALLING FOR MORE THAN JUST
A MISSILE LAUNCH.

THE NEWS OUT OF SYRIA HURT
YOUR 401(K)S AND IRA'S
TODAY STOCKS SLID IN THE
RED AFTER SOARING EARLIER
THIS THE DAY.

IT SEEMS THAT WAIT A
MINUTE HE SAT DOWN
APPARENTLY FOR INTERVIEW
WITH THE RUSSIAN DAILY
NEWSPAPER.

ONE VEHICLE WAS HIT.

BUT HE SAYS THE U.S. WILL
NOT GO IT ALONE IF THERE IS
ANY ACTION TAKEN IT WILL
BE IN CONCERT WITH
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND
WITHIN FRAMEWORK OF LEGAL
JUSTIFICATION.

GROUND TROOPS.

LET ME BE CLEAR.
