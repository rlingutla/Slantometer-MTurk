AND POLICE SAY NOBODY HAS
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A
SUSPECT.

WE ARE EXPECTING IT WILL
COME FROM ANY TIME OF
COURSE WE HAVE LIVE
COVERAGE.

BUT, MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE
WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
THIS.

WE'LL HAVE LIVE COVERAGE,
OF COURSE, DURING A LIVE
EDITION OF THE O'REILLY
FACTOR.

THEY JUST SORT OF MADE A
LARGER PERIMETER OF WHYER
CIRCUMFERENCE AS YOU CAN
SEE.

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BEGIN AT
7 EASTERN.

AND THEN SPECIFICALLY
WHETHER THERE WAS SHRAPNEL.

FOX 25 IS OUR LOCAL STATION
THERE, THEIR REPORTER
CRYSTAL HAINES IS AT THE
BEACON HILLS SECTION OF
BOSTON WITH MORE.

THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT DOES A GREAT DEAL OF
DAMAGE TO HUMAN FLESH.

THINGS ARE STILL LOCKED
DOWN HERE.

I WANT TO CONTINUE WITH
THESE PICTURES.

A FINAL POINT WE JUST HAD
CONFIRMATION IN THE LAST
FEW MINUTES THAT THE FBI
AS WELL AS THE NCTC, THIS
IS THE NATIONAL COUNTER
TERRORISM CENTER, THIS IS
THE GROUP THAT WAS CREATED
AFTER 9/11 TO MONITOR
THREATS AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES WILL BE BRIEFING
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AS
EARLY AS TOMORROW.

POLICE SAY ABOUT 100 YARDS
AWAY.

IN THIS CASE THE FBI
SHEPARD.

BUT IT IS NOT A TARGET OF
NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL
SIGNIFICANCE SUCH AS A --
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER OR
EVEN THE OLYMPIC GAMES.

WE DO KNOW AT LAST COUNT WE
ARE AT ROUGHLY 98 PEOPLE
RATHER THAT WERE ACTUALLY
INJURED, TWO KILLED.

THE BARRICADES ARE UP.

TO CLEAR UP SOME OF WHAT
HAPPENED TODAY AND GIVE YOU
COMPLEX.

PEOPLE, FACES AND BODIES
COVERED IN BLOOD.

IT'S POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
SPECULATION THAT IT IS --
HARD TO KNOW BUT IT IS
THAT -- IT DOES HAVE
SIGNIFICANCE IN THE REGION
IN BOSTON.
