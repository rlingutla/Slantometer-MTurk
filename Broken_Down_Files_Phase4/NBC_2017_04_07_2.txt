THEY ATTACK US IN
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO
HELP THE TERRORIST
SERIOUS DISPUTE NOW IS
WITH SYRIA'S BACKER
RUSSIA.

BUT WE HOPE THAT WILL
NOT BE NECESSARY.

EVEN BEAUTIFUL
BABIES WERE CRUELLY
MURDERED IN THIS VERY
BARBARIC ATTACK.

THEY SHOW LITTLE
DESTRUCTION.

THE MOOD INSIDE
CAUTIOUSLY CONFIDENT.

SIX PEOPLE ON THE
GROUND WERE KILLED IN
THE OVERNIGHT MISSILE
STRIKE.

THIS NOW HAS
PROVIDED THE
ADMINISTRATION A
DEMONSTRATION MOMENTS
FOR THE REST OF THE
WORLD TO INCLUDE THE
CHINESE AND THE
RUSSIANS, TO
UNDERSTAND THAT
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF
IN TOWN.

I THINK IT WAS A
WIN FOR THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.

I THINK THE
PRESIDENT OWES IT TO
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO
COME TO CONGRESS AND
ADMINISTRATION ARGUES
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF
CAN DECIDE ON HIS OWN
TO TAKE MILITARY
ACTION TO PROTECT THE
U.S.

TARGETING THE AIR
BASE.

IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,
THE LAUNCH BEGINNING.

AND A MEETING BETWEEN
PUTIN AND SECRETARY OF
STATE REX TILLERSON
SCHEDULED NEXT WEEK IN
MOSCOW IS STILL ON.

AT 740 P.M., TWO NAVY
DESTROYERS IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN LAUNCHED
60 CRUISE MISSILES.

AS THE WHITE HOUSE
INSISTS HE'S STILL
COMMITTED TO AMERICA
FIRST.

NOT LONG AFTER THE
PRESIDENT ADDRESSES
THE NATION.

TUESDAY MORNING, THE
PRESIDENT IS BRIEFED
ON THE ATTACK, QUOTE
DISTURBED BY IT AND
ASKING FOR OPTIONS.

A WAR OF WORDS TODAY
AT THE U.N. SECURITY
COUNSEL.

BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON,
A DECISION, GREEN
LIGHTING THE STRIKE.

ONE MISSILE MISFIRED
INTO THE SEA, THE REST
DIRECT HITS DESTROYING
20 SYRIAN AIRCRAFT AND
REINFORCED HANGARS AND
FUEL DEPOTS.

AS A FRAGRANT
VIOLATION OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND
AN ACT OF AGGRESSION.
