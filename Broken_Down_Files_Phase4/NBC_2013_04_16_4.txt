WITH LIFE-THREATENING INJURIES
TAKEN TO HOSPITALS.

WE THANK OUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,
THOSE WE KNOW AND THOSE WE HAVE
NEVER MET, FOR THEIR THOUGHTS
AND PRAYERS."

I RAN 22 MILES THINKING ABOUT
THE MINUTE WHEN I WAS GOING TO
COME DOWN THE STREET AND GET
THIS MEDAL.

AND THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW TO DEFEND AND SECURE THOSE.

FOR THAT MATTER THERE'S A MAJOR
SPORTING EVENT EVERY DAY ALL
YEAR ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

IN A STATEMENT, HIS FATHER, BILL
RICHARD, WROTE, "MY DEAR SON
MARTIN HAS DIED FROM INJURIES
SUSTAINED IN THE ATTACK ON
BOSTON.

BUT I AM ALSO CONFIDENT THAT WE
WILL LEARN WHAT LESSONS THERE
ARE TO BE LEARNED, AND NEXT
YEAR'S MARATHON WILL BE BIGGER
AND BETTER THAN EVER.

WE'RE A VERY CLOSE COMMUNITY,
AND WE ARE ALL DEVASTATED.

AND THAT IS, IT WAS STRIKING
YESTERDAY, THIS HAPPENED WITH
BOSTON PD OFFICERS IN THE
FOREGROUND, MEANING IF YOU CAN
GET A DEVICE INTO AN ALREADY
SECURED AREA, WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO MEAN FOR DEFENDING CITIES
LIKE BOSTON?

I WAS CARRYING SOMEONE WHO
LOST BOTH OF THEIR LEGS.

ONE PERSON CAN BE SEEN RUNNING
AWAY, CLOTHES TORN BY THE BLAST.

KIND.

AND THE ATTACK ON BOSTON VERY
MUCH ON THE MINDS OF PEOPLE HERE
AS WELL AS AT SPORTING EVENTS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE
LOSE YOU.

YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD 116 YEARS OF
INCIDENT-FREE MARATHONS.

WHILE AT THE EMANCIPATION DAY
PARADE, BOTH UNEASE --
 I WAS KIND OF CONCERNED AS TO
WHO'S HERE, YOU KNOW, WHY
THEY'RE HERE, IF ANYTHING'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

NORTH CAROLINA EMERGENCY ROOM
PHYSICIAN, WAS WAITING FOR HIS
WIFE TO CROSS THE FINISH LINE.

AND RIGHT NOW 24 REMAIN IN
CRITICAL CONDITION.

OUT ON THE STREET, THERE'S
NOT AN EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY.
