HE WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE
THE GUN DEALER WAS SOLD OUT BUT
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IS
RECORDING THAT HE HAD 1,000
TRACER ROUNDS BUT DIDN'T USE
THEM.

THE COUPLE APPARENTLY HIGH
SCHOOL SWEETHEARTS BACK IN THE
DAY.

LAS VEGAS QUESTION.

WE'RE STILL LEFT A WEEK LATER
WITH THE QUESTION WHY AND WHEN
WILL PEOPLE BE TALKING TO YOU?

HERE ONE WOMAN SITS NEAR THE
CROSS FOR HER COUSIN,
20-YEAR-OLD BAILEY SCHWIETZER.

INVESTIGATORS IN LAS VEGAS ARE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER
ANYBODY ELSE WAS IN THE
LAS VEGAS KILLER'S HOTEL SWEET.

AS I SAID YESTERDAY, WE WANT
TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION.

THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE
POLICE AND THEIR RESPONSE AFTER
THE MASS SHOOTINGS.

STEVE WYNN, ONE OF THE KINGS OF
LAS VEGAS.

BUT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW THE
CORRECT ONE YET.

BUT SHE TOLD POLICE SHE HAD NO
IDEA THAT HE WAS PLANNING MASS
MURDER.

WE JUST INTERVIEWED AN OFF DUTY
EMT THAT WAS AT THE CONCERT WITH
HIS WIFE.

HIS GIRLFRIEND SAID THAT HE
GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT IN RECENT
WEEKS AND BECAME OBSESSED WITH
MARILOU DANLEY'S EX-HUSBAND.

IT APPEARS THE MYSTERY WOMAN
THAT HE WAS SEEN WITH GAMBLING
HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING WAS A
HOOKER.

THOUSANDS GATHERING TO HONOR A
FORMAL NATIONAL GUARD SERGEANT
AND LAS VEGAS POLICE OFFICER
KILLED IN SUNDAY NIGHT'S
MASSACRE.

BUT NOW THERE'S A NEW THREAT,
WHICH WE SAW FROM STEPHEN
PADDOCK, WHICH IS KNOCKING OUT
THE WINDOWS AND FIRING DOWN FROM
ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL TALK TO
STEVE WYNN ABOUT, HOW DO YOU
HANDLE AND PREVENT THAT WE'LL BE
TALKING TO ERIC PRATT, THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GUN OWNERS
OF AMERICA.

CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT BEING OPEN
TO LEGISLATION BANNING BUMP
STOCKS?

JUST TRYING TO PROTECT HIS
PROPERTIES.

THE EMT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SIDE
THE WOMAN WHO HE'S RESCUED AND
SAVED AT THE HOSPITAL.

I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE
CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD.
