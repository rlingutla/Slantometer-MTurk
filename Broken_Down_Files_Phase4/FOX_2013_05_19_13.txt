TALK TO ME ABOUT PEOPLE
TONIGHT.

OVER EAST OF LAKE
THUNDERBIRD.

WE HAVE ALL OF OUR CREWS AND
EVERYONE HAS BEEN DISPATCHED
AND THEY WERE AT THE EMERGENCY
SERVICE CENTER IN PREPARATION.

THIS AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
TONIGHT.

THE ODDEST THING IS SEEING
THINGS ACTUALLY FLOATING IN THE
AIR.

DID YOU HEAR SIRENS.

WE HAVE A CONFIRMED TORNADO ON
THE GROUND SPOTTED BY FOLKS ON
THE GROUND AND TRAINED WEATHER
SPOTTERS AND WE ARE SEEING
DEBRIS IN THE AREA.

TELL ME HOW THINGS ARE GOING IN
YOUR CITY.

TWISTERS ON THE GROUND AND
THEIR REACTION AS THE HUGE
BOLTS OF LIGHTNING STRIKE FROM
THAT CLOUD COVER.

CHASERS ALL LINED UP AND
TRACKING THIS TORNADO RIGHT
ABOUT HERE.

NO, I HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY
REPORTS OF ANYTHING DAMAGED IN
THAT AREA AND MY FIRE CHIEF AND
POLICE CHIEF AND THE PEOPLE
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR EMERGENCY
CENTER HAVE NOT REPORTED
ANYTHING.

THANK YOU.

FIRST, WE ARE WATCHING THE
SEVERE ARE STORM SYSTEM
BRINGING DANGEROUS TORNADOES
ACROSS THE CENTRAL UNITED
STATES.

USUALLY IT IS HARD TO COULD
THAT BUT JUST NORTH OF LITTLE
AXE.

AND IF YOU ARE HIT BY THAT, CAN
CUT YOU UP AND DO A WHOLE LOT
OF DAMAGE.

YOU ARE IN YOUR CAR.

IT HELPS THAT EVERYONE IS
JUST VERY PREPARED AND IT HAS
BEEN TOP OF MIND.

JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WHERE WE
HAVE TORNADO WATCHES EXTENDING
THROUGH OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS UP
TOWARDS IOWA AND MINNESOTA FOR
THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS AND
UNFORTUNATELY THIS KIND OF
SCENARIO IS GOING TO KIN INTO
THE OVERNIGHT -- CONTINUE INTO
THE OVERNIGHT AND INTO
TOMORROW.

THANK YOU.

THEN LOOK AT THIS.
