CONDEMNED ASSAD.

WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT
WITH THE IMAGES THAT HAVE
STUNNED THE WORLD.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IN FACT BOASTED
THAT HE HAD WORKED OUT AN
AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA AND SYRIA
TO GET RID OF ASSAD'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

SECRETARY TILLERSON DID NOT TAKE
QUESTIONS ON THIS TODAY, BUT HE
APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN TO HARSHER
LINE IN A STATEMENT TODAY THAN
LINE.

ASSAD GAVE UP HIS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

SYRIAN PEOPLE AREN'T DETERMINING
THE STATUS OF ASSAD, THEY ARE
TRYING TO SURVIVE HIS BRUTALITY.
