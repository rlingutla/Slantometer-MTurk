I WOULD SAY 10
EXPLOSIONS RIGHT NOW MARK.

THERE WAS THIS THOUGHT OF,
YOU KNOW, WE ARE DONE FOR
THE NIGHT AND YOU KNEW THAT
THEY WERE GOING TO WORK
HARD THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT
WE FELT LIKE THINGS HAD
QUIETED DOWN.

ALL OF THESE CARS STARTED
COMING RIGHT AT US.

HE HAS BEEN HIDING THERE.

THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT THE
OLDER OF THE PRO BROTHERS
DIED IN WHAT WE ARE LED TO
BELIEVE WAS A SHOOTOUT WITH
POLICE.

APPARENTLY HE IS IN THE
BOAT AND REFUSING TO COME
OUT.

LIVE COVERAGE FROM WFXT FOX
FOR BOSTON AND THE
SURROUNDING.

YOU CAN SEE FROM FOX 25 IN
BOSTON, THIS IS THE SAME
AREA THAT HAS BEEN CORDONED
OFF ALL DAY WHERE 20 BLOCKS
OF TOWN WERE SHUT DOWN FOR
THE DAY.

BOB AGAIN YOUR SOURCES
AGAIN FOR THOSE WHO MAYBE
ARE JOINING US RIGHT NOW.

WE JUST GOT RIGHT DOWN THE
STREET AS WE WERE STARTING
TO HEAD BACK.

THEY SEEM TO BE COMING
IN THE BACKYARD OF THAT
HOME AT 67 FRANKLIN STREET?

BUT THAT HE IS STILL ALIVE.

NOW IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.

JUST TRYING TO WATCH AS
CLOSELY I CAN.

HIS BROTHER WAS FOUND TO
HAVE AN IED ON HIMSELF THIS
MORNING WHEN THEY
IDENTIFIED HIM LATER AFTER
HE PASSED AWAY AT BRIGHAM
WOMEN'S -- BETH -- HOSPITAL
I SHOULD SAY.

AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE
HEARD GUNSHOTS.

BECAUSETONIANS RESPONDED
WELL ESPECIALLY THERE IN
WATER TOWN.

AND THAT YOU HEARD WAS
THE SOUND OF 20 TO 30
GUNSHOTS FIRED JUST MOMENTS
AGO.

AND SHE NOTICED WHAT LOOKED
BOAT.

EVERYBODY YELLED GUNSHOTS
WHEN THEY HEARD THE NOISE.
