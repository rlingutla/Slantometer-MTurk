TO THE US FROM THE PHILIPPINES
TWO DAYS AGO, BUT TONIGHT
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT A
CLOSE WATCH ON MARILOU DANLEY TO
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T TRY TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY AS THEY
STRUGGLE TO FIND THE MOTIVE
BEHIND HER BOYFRIEND'S CRIME.

TONIGHT WE REMEMBER 58 NAMES, 58
FACES LOST.

DRIVING HER TO SCHOOL SAID TO
ME, DAD, YOU SEEM QUIET.

BEFORE THE SHOOTING, OFFICIALS
TELL ABC NEWS HE WAS IN THE
COMPANY OF PROSTITUTES AND WENT
GAMBLING IN THE MANDALAY BAY
CASINO, WINNING BIG JACKPOTS ON
BOTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS.

VICTIMS PILING INTO HIS PICKUP.

THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE HERE AT THIS MEMORIAL
SITE ALL DAY DAVID.

PLACE AND WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON
THE GUNMAN'S NOTE.
