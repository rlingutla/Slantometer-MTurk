THE FIREFIGHTERS SAID THEY HAD
REHEARSED, TRAINING FOR THIS
SCENARIO FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE
THEY'RE A HIGH TARGET
DESTINATION.

I JUST HEARD ABOUT IT WHEN YOU
SAID IT.

ALSO POSSIBLE.

AHEAD WE'LL TALK WITH A FORMER
FBI INVESTIGATOR ABOUT THE
QUESTIONS HE SAYS THAT
INVESTIGATORS NEED TO GET
ANSWERED.

KIND OF LIKE A BATTLEFIELD.

STILL DANLEY'S HELP REMAINS
CRUCIAL IN REBUILDING HIS LIFE,
MENTAL HEALTH, WHAT HE BOUGHT
AND WHEN HE BOUGHT IT.

WE'RE COOPERATING WITH THE
AUTHORITIES ON THAT MATTER."

SHE SAID THAT PADDOCK SENT HER A
CHEAP TICKET AND SENT HER TO THE
PHILIPPINES AS A GIFT.

THEY SPOKE ABOUT THE CHALLENGES
THEY FACE.

HAVE -- POLICE CAN WITHHOLD
WHATEVER THEY WANT IN THE COURSE
OF AN INVESTIGATION.

INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING TO
UNRAVEL HIS STORY AND WHETHER HE
HAD HELP.

WAS WITH A WOMAN GAMBLING BEFORE
COMMITTING THIS ATTACK SOMEONE
WHO HASN'T COME FORWARD, MUST
REALIZE WOW, THIS IS THE GUY I
WAS WITH THAT NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO
HAVE QUESTIONS FOR WHOEVER THAT
IS.

A LOT WE THOUGHT WAS ESCALATING
WHEN IT WAS REALLY CONTAINED BUT
WE DIDN'T KNOW BECAUSE OF SO
MANY CALLS COMING IN.

AND FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK
THIS THURSDAY AFTERNOON, THE
WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S OPEN TO
THE IDEA OF REGULATING BUMP
STOCKS.

SHE SAID THIS AS FAR AS THE
ADMINISTRATION'S VIEW OF A
POSSIBLE BAN.

GOT TO DO IT.

FROM HIS APPARENT ESCAPE PLAN
AND HIS INTEREST IN OTHER MUSIC
FESTIVALS TO HIS MYSTERIOUS
PAST.

MUCH OF WHICH WILL NEVER BE
FULLY UNDERSTOOD.

THEY WERE LAYING IN BETWEEN
THE RUNWAYS, TRYING TO TAKE
COVER.

I THINK THE LAS VEGAS
METROPOLITAN POLICE HAVE THAT
NOTE AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING UP
ANYTHING ON IT.
