AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS ON
SYRIA.

CHILDREN AND BABIES AMONG THE
VICTIMS.

DOZENS KILLED BY WHAT TURKISH
OFFICIALS NOW SAY WAS SARIN GAS.

TONIGHT, WE KNOW THAT THE
DEFENSE SECRETARY IS NOW
BRIEFING THE PRESIDENT ON THE
OPTIONS.

HE'S BEING BRIEFED ON THE
POTENTIAL OPTIONS.

I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
HAPPENED THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD
SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY
MUCH.

SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILES OR
U.S.-MANNED AIRCRAFT.

MILITARY TONIGHT, AMONG THE
OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED ARE THE
VERY PLANS THE PENTAGON PLANNED
FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN A PRIME
TARGET WAS THE SPECIFIC MILITARY
UNIT THAT GUARDED AND DEPLOYED
SYRIA'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

ALONG WITH ADVANCED RUSSIAN
ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

AIMED AT RUSSIA, VLADIMIR PUTIN.

AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

AND WHAT ARE THE GREATEST RISKS?

BUT EVEN WITH A DIMINISHED
SUPPLY, A DIRECT STRIKE ON
WHATEVER CHEMICAL WEAPONS REMAIN
STILL RUNS A SERIOUS RISK.

AS THIS PRESIDENT, NOW 77 DAYS
INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, DECIDES
WHETHER TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION.

AND FROM THAT FIGHT, THE U.S.
GETS NOTHING!"

THEY SAY THERE'S NO QUESTION
IT WAS A SYRIAN MILITARY
AIRCRAFT.

BUT WE HEARD THOSE WORDS JUST 24
HOURS AGO FROM THE U.S.

RISKIER BUT WE HAVE HIGHLY
SOPHISTICATED WARPLANES.

AND HOW SOON COULD THIS COME?

IN FACT, THE WORLD IS
WATCHING TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT
IS NOW PREPARED TO CHALLENGE
RUSSIA AND ITS LEADER WHO HE HAS
PRAISED SO MUCH, VLADIMIR PUTIN.
