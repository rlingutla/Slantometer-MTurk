THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO DECIDE
WHETHER THESE ARE RIGHT OR
WRONG.

SIGNED UP FOR A MILITARY
CONTRACTOR AT A BASE IN JAPAN.

PLEASE DO NOT GET IN MY WAY.

MANY AGREE THE POWER OF THE NSA
COULD BE THEY'RE ROAD.

WHAT HE TOLD "THE GUARDIAN"
NEWSPAPER IN A STORY PUBLISHED
LAST WEEK CAUSED A FIRESTORM OF
CONTROVERSY OVER PRIVACY AND
NATIONAL SECURITY.

THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
TELL ME THAT THEY SIMPLY COULD
NOT FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT
THE PERSONNEL, TECHNOLOGY, AND
EXPERTISE OF THESE PRIVATE
CONTRACTORS.

THE 29-YEAR-OLD NSA CONTRACTOR,
EDWARD SNOWDEN, HAS TURNED THE
MASSIVE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
INSIDE OUT.

COMPLEX IN FT. MEADE, MARYLAND
THERE ARE NOW OFFICE BUILDINGS
FULL OF CONTRACTORS.

MY NAME IS EDWARD SNOWDEN.

WE NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED
JUDGMENT IF WE NEED MORE CIVIL
LIBERTIES PROTECTIONS IN THE
LAW.

EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS BEEN
IDENTIFIED AS A CONTRACTOR WHO
WORKED AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY, AND YESTERDAY FROM
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD, HE
STEPPED FROM THE SHADOWS,
ADMITTING HE WAS THE LEAK.

HAVE A GOOD DAY.

WORKED FOR THE CIA UNDERCOVER IN
GENEVA AND SAYS HE BECAME
DISILLUSIONED.

THIS RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN
AND REMAINS ESSENTIAL TO THE
SECURITY OF BOTH NATIONS.

ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT,
ALMOST FIVE MILLION INDIVIDUALS
NOW HOLD SECURITY CLEARANCES.

NO ACTION CAN BE TAKEN UNTIL
THERE IS A CHARGE.

PLUS SNOWDEN STILL HAS TO BE
FOUND.

THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE FELT
SO COMPELLED TO INFORM HIS
CITIZENS ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES
THIS MASSIVE SURVEILLANCE
HIS HOME IN HAWAII, AND HE MAY
HAVE LEFT HONG KONG AS WELL.

THEY HAVE LAUNCHED THE MANHUNT
FOR.

FEDERAL AGENTS AT THE HOME TODAY
OF EDWARD SNOWDEN'S MOTHER IN
ELLICOTT CITY, MARYLAND, ONLY
MILES FROM THE NSA IN FT. MEADE.
