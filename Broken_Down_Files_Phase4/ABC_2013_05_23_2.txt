SHIELDED BENEATH HER BODY WHEN
AN SUV CRASHED THROUGH THE
CEILING OF HER CLASSROOM.

I JUST COVERED MY BABIES.

THEY DIDN'T GET TO BRING THEIR
KIDS HOME.

OTHERS WERE GIVEN BACKPACKS WITH
GOODIES FOR THE SUMMER.

SHE SHIELDED WITH HER OWN
BODY TO PROTECT MY DAUGHTER.

YOU KNOW THAT, I'M NEVER GOING
TO HAVE ANY WORDS TO REPAY HER
FOR WHAT SHE DID.

WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE
PARENTS?

9-YEAR-OLD ANTONIA CANDELARIA
WAS LAID TO REST DURING A
VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM.

IT CRUSHED MY ARM, BUT I'M OKAY
WITH THAT.
