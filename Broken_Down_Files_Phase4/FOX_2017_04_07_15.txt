THE ALL IS MILITARY TOOK EFFORTS
NOT TO HIT THE BARRACKS.

I'M WILLING TO HAVE THAT
DIALOGUE.

BECAUSE HE HAS TO KNOW THAT THE
PUNISHMENT THAT HE RECEIVED
YESTERDAY WAS VERY MINOR
COMPARED TO WHAT WE COULD DO.

THOSE WORDS FROM THE UNITED
NATIONS AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY
TODAY.

THE MISSILE MAY HAVE SENT A
POWERFUL WARNING TO NORTH KOREA.

YOU KNOW THAT THIS SLAUGHTER HAS
BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVEN YEARS.

IF WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THE
SYRIAN SITUATION, OUR FIRST STEP
IS TO DEFEAT ISISLE NOW WE HAVE
TO ASK OUR SAYS QUESTION.

THE IF THEN POSSIBILITY.

IN DAMASCUS.

THIS RUSSIAN SHIP, THE RUSSIAN
DESTROYER ON THE MOVE TOWARD OUR
SHIPS, WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF
THAT?

THE PRESIDENT IS MONITORING THE
AFTERMATH.

THIS DECISION AFTER SEEING THE
PICTURES OF THE BABIES
SLAUGHTERED.

I WOULD HOPE WE HAVE ALL OF
OUR ALLIES IN THE GULF REGION,
BECAUSE AS INDICATED IN THE PAST
BY SECRETARY POWELL, ONCE YOU
BREAK SOMETHING, YOU OWN IT.

BUT THAT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
CHOICE NOT TO RESPOND, NOT TO
COME TO CONGRESS WITH ROBUST
AUTHORIZATION.

I WONDER WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING
IS OF THE NEXT STEPS.

AND FIRST FROM THE DECK THIS
FRIDAY AFTERNOON, WE BEGIN WITH
A STARK WARNING FROM RUSSIA.

WE'LL HAVE COMPREHENSIVE
COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE HOUR.

IT WAS DESIGNED AGAINST ONE AIR
BASE OUT OF A DOZEN IN THE
COUNTRY.

HE DIDN'T ASK FOR AN
AUTHORIZATION.

PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO CONGRESS
ASKING THEM TO YOU'D LIES -- TO
GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY AND
CONGRESS DECIDED NOT TO STEP UP
TO THE PLATE.
