HE SENT HER AWAY AT ONE POINT.

LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
SHOOTER'S ARSENAL TODAY, TRACE.

SOME PEOPLE INJURED THEMSELVES
HELPING TO STOP THE BLEEDING OF
OTHER PEOPLE.

IN A COUPLE MOMENTS, HE'S GOING
TO A BIT MORE FORMAL SETTINGS
WHERE HE WILL MEET WITH POLICE
CHIEFS AND OTHERS.

YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

IT'S BEEN A VERY GOOD DAY FOR
THANK YOUS TO THE FIRST
RESPONDERS AND EVERYDAY FOLKS
THAT HELPED OUTSIDE THE LUXOR
AND MANDALAY BAY ON THE
LAS VEGAS STRIP.

WE'LL GET THE WHITE HOUSE POOL
OUT OF THE ROOM ON THE
INSTRUCTIONS OF THE PRESS
SECRETARY.

THERE'S NO TELLING SPECIFICALLY
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SAVED AS A
RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF PEOPLE
THAT WERE NOT DOCTORS.

WE MENTIONED THE PRESIDENT WAS
MEETING WITH FIRST RESPONDERS IN
LAS VEGAS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO THANK.

THE PRESIDENT TAKING THE TOUR OF
THE COMMAND CENTER, MEETING WITH
THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE'LL
HEAR FROM HIM SHORTLY WHERE HE
WILL PAY TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE
MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE
AND THE CIVILIANS THAT DID THE
MUCH.

SO THESE ARE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT
ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE SUCCESS
OF OUR CRITICAL JOB.

THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT WILL
PAY TRIBUTE TOO.

SO WE CAN SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE.

HE DID.

STAY DOWN.

SO THE PRESIDENT STAYED IN THE
FORWARD CABIN.

WE MUST BE GLAD, WE MUST BE
GOOD, WE MUST BE BRAVE.

AMERICA IS TRULY A NATION IN
MOURNING.

REMEMBER, THEY FOUND DOZENS AND
DOZENS OF WEAPONS INSIDE THE
HOMES THAT SHE LIVED IN WITH HIM
ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVES AND
SUITCASES OF AMMUNITION.
