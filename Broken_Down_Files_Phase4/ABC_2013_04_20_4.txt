AND UP NEXT HERE ON "WORLD
NEWS," THERE COULD BE A VERY BIG
THANK-YOU GIFT IN THE WORKS FOR
THE BOAT OWNER WHO HELPED POLICE
IN BOSTON GET THEIR SUSPECT.

THE SIZE OF IT WAS JUST
INCREDIBLE.

OLDER BROTHER, TAMERLAN, 26,
STAR ATHLETE, GOLDEN GLOVE
BOXER, PIANIST.

WHAT WILL INSPIRE THEM, HOW THEY
MIGHT GET RADICALIZED.

BUT IN HER CALL WITH ABC NEWS,
THE MOTHER SAID, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO LIVE WITH THIS.

HE JUST SAT UP.

TO REMAIN SILENT, OR TO HAVE A
LAWYER.

A WOMAN STANDING NEXT TO HER
LOST A LEG.

BUT FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAY THE
PARENTS REJECTED ISLAMIC
FUNDAMENTALISM.

WHERE DID THEY GET THAT
TRAINING?

WAS JUST TEN YARDS AWAY FROM THE
EXPLOSION.

FELT LIKE A HUG.

WHO FUNDED HIM, IF HE HAD ANY
SORT OF EXTRA FUNDING.

COMING UP HERE ON "WORLD NEWS"
ON THIS SATURDAY NIGHT, TWO
DISASTERS IN ONE WEEK, ONE IN
BOSTON, AND ONE IN WEST, TEXAS.

HER COMMENTS FEED THE MYSTERY
OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO TURN THE
TWO BROTHERS INTO TERRORISTS.

TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SHOT FROM A
STATE POLICE HELICOPTER,
EQUIPPED WITH A THERMAL CAMERA.

TAMERLAN WAS CHARGED IN
CAMBRIDGE WITH BEATING HIS
FORMER GIRLFRIEND.

ONE WEEK, IT SOUNDS PRETTY
UNLUCKY.

NOT THE CHECHENS.

NEW IMAGES AND FRESH DETAILS
FROM THE DRAMATIC CAPTURE OF THE

MARATHON BOMBINGS.
