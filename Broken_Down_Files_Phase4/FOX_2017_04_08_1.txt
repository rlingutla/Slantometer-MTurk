UK, THE STRONGEST OBJECTIONS
ARE COMING FROM RUSSIA.

IT IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
BUT THE FOUNDERS WERE VERY CLEAR
THAT IF THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO
COMMIT TO WORK NEEDS TO BE UNDER
THE SAY-SO OF THE CONGRESS
REPRESENTING ALL THE PEOPLE AND
NOT THE DECISION OF ONE
INDIVIDUAL.

FOR THIS MOMENT JULIE U.S.
OFFICIALS SAY THE ASSAD REGIME
HAS NOT BEEN MAKING ANY
THREATENING MOVES THE KEEP IN
MIND IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS
OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES ON
THE GROUND YOU HAVE A U.S.
MARINE CORPS ARTILLERY BATTERY
OUTSIDE OF RAQQA SUPPORTING
U.S.-BACKED FORCES AS THEY TRY
TO RECAPTURE.

HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE HIS MIND
TO DEFAULT.

DEFENSE INTERVENTION OF AN
AIRBASE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE
IF WE DON'T REMOVE THE REGIME
FROM POWER AND THIS REMAINS A
COSMETIC INTERVENTION.

HIS DECISION TO STRIKE HAS
RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PRAISE FROM
OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION.

RUSSIA HAS BEEN THE MOST
CRITICAL OF THE U.S. MISSILE
STRIKE SAYING THEY WERE IN
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.

GOVERNMENT IN CARRYING OUT THE
ATTACK BUT ALL EYES ARE NOW ON
THE RUSSIAN REACTION TO THE KEY
ROLE IN SYRIA WHILE STANDING BY
ASSAD AGGRESSION.

WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE BUT
WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE
NECESSARY.

THAT IS THE WORD.

IT WAS THESE IMAGES OF THE
HORRIFIC CHEMICAL STRIKE IN
NORTHERN SYRIA WHICH SPARKED
GLOBAL OUTRAGE THAT LED TO THE
U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE.

ANY INDICATION OF HOW HE'S DOING
TONIGHT?

IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK YOU CAN
SAY THAT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

THE MAIN SOURCE OF CONFLICT IS
BETWEEN SENIOR ADVISER JARED
KUSHNER AND STEVE BANNON.

JUST HOURS LATER SYRIAN
WARPLANES FROM OTHER BASES
APPARENTLY STRUCK OPPOSITION
TARGETS INCLUDING ONE NEAR THE
SITE OF A DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
WHICH PROVOKED THE U.S.

MADE THE DECISION IN FOUR HOURS
LATER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILES LEFT THE RAIL.

YESTERDAY THE U.S. AMBASSADOR
THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI HALEY
SAID THE UNITED STATES COULD
STRIKE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PRETEND
TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE
PRESIDENT MAY FIND THEMSELVES
BACKTRACKING VERY QUICKLY WHAT
WE KNOW IS THE PRESIDENT IS THE
ONE WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHO IS
GOING TO LEAD.

SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
WILL NO DOUBT BE DISCUSSING
SYRIA WHEN HE DOES -- VISITS
RUSSIA NEXT WEEK.

ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS HE NOW
TURNING ON RUSSIA A COUNTRY THAT
STRONGLY SUPPORTED BASHAR
AL-ASSAD ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE
HAVE BEEN ALL THESE REPORTS BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS HIS
ASSOCIATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOO
COZY WITH RUSSIA AND THERE ARE
SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO
WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF HIS
ASSOCIATES BROKE THE LAW.
