IT'S UNCLEAR, LESTER, IF THIS
WILL BE A TURNING POINT OR JUST
ANOTHER HORROR IN A WAR NO ONE
WANTS TO -- SEEMS TO WANT TO
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH.

NEW BOMBINGS IN THE VILLAGES
WHERE SO MANY CHILDREN DIED.

AND TONIGHT, WHAT COULD BE NEW
EVIDENCE.

HUNDREDS, MANY OF THEM CHILDREN,
ARE DEAD.

SO MANY THEY'RE NOT EVEN NAMED,
BUT NUMBERED.

THE U.N. HAS PROVEN TO BE
UTTERLY POWERLESS.
