ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GET
OUTDOORS AGAIN.

WE HAVE REPORTERS AND
PRODUCERS ON SCENE AND
WE'LL TAKE YOU BACK THERE
THIS IS BREAKING NEWS
COVERAGE ON FOX NEWS
CHANNEL WITH WFXT IN
BOSTON.

QUITE A BIT.

I WENT UP AND ALL THE ALL
OF A SUDDEN THEY WAYMAN
BACK.

NOW THIS WORD FROM WATER
TOWN WHICH IS THE SPOT
WHERE WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING
ALL DAY LONG.

OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT PUTTING A
HUMAN LIFE IN HARM'S WAY.

THEY ARE OUT OF THEIR
VEHICLES AND ON THE STREETS
OF WATERTOWN RIGHT NOW.

IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US,
REPORTS THAT ABOUT 20
MINUTES AGO SHOTS FIRED
AFTER THINGS HAD KIND OF
CALMED DOWN A BIT AND THE
PRESS CONFERENCE SAID, YOU
KNOW, IT'S TIME TO LIFT THE
LOCKDOWN ON THE TOWN AND
WILL INCREASE OUR PRESENCE
AS FAR AS SECURITY GOES BUT
TO GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS
AND BE VIGILANT, NOW
EVERYBODY WAS AT THAT PRESS
CONFERENCE IS ON FRANKLIN
STREET.

POLICE SOURCE TELLING HER
THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IS
DOWN ON FRANKLIN STREET
THAT WOULD BE SUSPECT
NUMBER 2 WE BELIEVE.

AGAIN HEAVY POLICE
PRESENCE ON FRANKLIN STREET
IN WATER TOWN.

THERE HAD BEEN A NEWS
CONFERENCE THAT HAPPENED
HERE IN BOSTON IN THE 630
HALF HOUR EASTERN TIME.

THE DRIVE FROM THE AIRPORT
TO DOWNTOWN BOSTON WAS LESS
THAN 10 MINUTES AND ANYBODY
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS CITY KNOWS THAT MEANS
BOSTON WAS AT HOME.

THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED
LIKE.

INSTEAD OF THE LID LOCK
SOLID, THAT LID CAME OFF
BEFORE IT WAS ABLE TO
EXPLODE.

LOOKING AT THE VIDEO I CAN TELL FROM
WATCHING THROUGHOUT THE DAY
THE MEANING OF ALL THOSE ON
SCENE IN WATER TOWN IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN
WE HAVE SEEN SINCE THE
EARLY MORNING HOURS TOY
WHEN ALL OF THIS BEGAN.

AGAIN, TELL US WHAT YOUR
SOURCES ARE SAYING.

THE CABIN FEVER HAD GOTTEN
THE BEST OF THEM.

POLICE ARE KEEPING THEM OFF
TO THE SIDE ON THE SIDE OF
THE ROAD.

GOT MORE POLICE ACTIVITY
COMING IN UNMARKED CARS
RIGHT NOW.

TONIGHT WE'RE TOLD THAT A
SUSPECT IS DOWN BUT THAT
SUSPECT IS STILL ALIVE AND
SURROUNDED AT THIS HOUR.
