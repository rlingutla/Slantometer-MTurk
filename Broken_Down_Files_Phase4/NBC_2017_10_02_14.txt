HE WAS ALWAYS WITH
TODAY, THE MOMENT MIKE
HAD BEEN WAITING FOR.

BULLETS STARTED
RAINING DOWN ON
SUNDAY, SONNY'S
INSTINCT WAS TO
PROTECT HIS WIFE OF
JUST OVER A YEAR,
HEATHER.

THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED.

IT WAS REALLY, REALLY
BAD.

IT WAS VERY SCARY
AT THE TIME.

HE ALSO CONDEMNED THIS
ATTACK AS, QUOTE, AN
ACT OF PURE EVIL AND
ORDERED FLAGS TO FLY
AT HALF-STAFF.

I'M NOT LEAVING HIM.

THIS WE UNDERSTAND
IS THE HOUSE THAT WAS
OWNED BY PADDOCK.
