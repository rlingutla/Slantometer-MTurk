BILL BRATTON WAS THE BOSTON
POLICE COMMISSIONER BEFORE
LEADING THE NYPD AND THE LAPD.

CATASTROPHIC.

BIG SPORTING EVENTS LIKE THE
BOSTON MARATHON HAD BEEN VIEWED
AS INVITING TARGETS SINCE 9/11.

E EVERYONE IN THE ROOM, EVERYONE
OUTSIDE JUST STOPS MOVING AND
INSTANTLY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS
HAPPENING UNTIL THAT SECOND BOMB
WENT OFF.

I WAS SITTING DOWN.

I GUESS THEY ARE TRYING NOT TO
CONGREGATE.

TRYING TO ENSURE EVERYONE'S
SAFETY IS A HERCULEAN CHALLENGE.

I HAD ONE EYEWITNESS DESCRIBE IT
IN TERMS OF WORLD TRADE.

FAMILIES ARE REUNITING WITH
LOVED ONES, TRYING TO SEE IF
EVERYONE IS SAFE.

BETWEEN THE POINT OF THE
EXPLOSION AND THE CROWD POLICE,
BOSTON EMS, RACE VOLUNTEERS WERE
CAUGHT UP IN IT.

ANY EVENT WITH MULTIPLE
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AS THIS
APPEARS TO BE IS CLEARLY AN ACT
OF TERROR AND WILL BE APPROACHED
AS AN ACT OF TERROR.

I'M STAYING AT THE FAIRMONT AND
THE MEDICAL TENT IS OUTSIDE OUR
FRONT DOOR.

TONIGHT EVERY POLICE AGENCY IN
THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS IS
SENDING HELP TO BOSTON AS IS THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

BUT A MEETING TONIGHT WILL
DECIDE WHETHER ANY KIND OF
NATIONAL ALERT WILL BE SENT OUT.

I CAN TELL YOU FROM TALKING TO
SOURCES THIS WAS DISCUSSED AND
THE DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO
HAVE THE PRESIDENT USE THAT
SPECIFIC WORD.

BEING GLAD SO MANY ARE SAFE
TONIGHT AND TRYING TO GET THEIR
HEAD AROUND JUST WHAT HAPPENED
IN ALL OF THE TRAGEDY THAT
UNFOLDED.

THAT HAUNTS EVERYBODY
INVOLVED.

THAT SECOND BOMB YOU FELT JUST
AS MUCH, YOU HEARD JUST AS LOUD
AND EVERYONE INSTANTLY KNEW THAT
IT WAS NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT AND
IT WAS A BOMB.

NBC'S TOM COSTELLO HAS BEEN
LOOKING AT THIS CONUNDRUM FOR
SECURITY PERSONNEL ALL DAY.

THE SECOND A BLOCK AWAY.
