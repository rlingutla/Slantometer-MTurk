EVEN PEOPLE JUST
PARKING AROUND A LONE
WORKING CELL TOWER TO
TRY TO GET A MESSAGE
OUT.

HERE IN PUERTO RICO
APOCALYPTIC SCENES.

AND IN THOSE CASES
THERE ARE LONG LINES.

THAT WILL ALLOW THEM
TO BRING MORE FLIGHTS
IN AS THE DAYS GO ON.

LEAVING THE AIRPORT
THE SIGNS OF DESPAIR
WERE APPARENT
EVERYWHERE.

COASTAL TOWN OF
MAUNABO, NORMA ROSADO
LOST THE ROOF OFF HER
HOME AND HER SMALL
BUSINESS BLEW AWAY
ENTIRELY.

POWER IS STILL LARGELY
OUT.

BUT WE'RE TRAINED TO
DO IT, AND WE DO IT
PRETTY WELL, I THINK.

SO WE ARE READY TO
JUST GO BACK, SEE OUR
FAMILIES, THEN HEAD
BACK TO THE STATES OR
WHATEVER TO GET THE
SUPPLIES.

ROOFS BLOWN OFF, LIVES
TORN APART.

THEY'RE LOADING WATER
AND MEALS
READY-TO-EAT.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO
COVER THIS STORY AND
UPDATE YOU AS PUERTO
RICO RECOVERS, AS WE
SAID, HOME TO ALMOST
3.5 MILLION AMERICANS.

WE'RE GETTING OUR
FIRST LOOK AT THE
GROUND ZERO WHERE
HURRICANE MARIA MADE
ITS LANDFALL ALMOST A
WEEK AGO.

DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR
FROM THE AIRPORT TO
APPRECIATE JUST HOW
GREAT THE NEED IS.

THIS IS GOING TO BE A
NORTHWEST PUERTO RICO
ENGINEERS ARE
INSPECTING A MAJOR DAM
AFTER FINDING A CRACK.

THE MILITARY HAS PUT
THEIR OWN RADAR SYSTEM
IN PLACE TEMPORARILY
HERE.

THERE IS STILL A
DESPERATE NEED TO
COMMUNICATE.

THIS IS THE AREA WHERE
THE EYE OF THE STORM
HIT.

IT'S BEEN A
SACRIFICE NOT TO BE
WITH MY FAMILY, BUT
MISSION COMES FIRST.

TODAY SAN JUAN'S
AIRPORT PACKED AS
TRAVELERS RUSHED TO
ESCAPE ON THE FEW
COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS.
