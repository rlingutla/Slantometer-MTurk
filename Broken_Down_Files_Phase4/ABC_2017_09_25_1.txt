I'M ALL RIGHT.

WE TURN NOW TO THE GROWING
EMERGENCY UNFOLDING IN PUERTO
RICO.

THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO NOW
BEGGING FOR HELP AFTER HURRICANE
MARIA, CALLING THIS A, QUOTE,
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER.

8,000 RESIDENTS TOLD TO GET OUT
NOW.

THEY ARE HAVING TO USE CHAIN
SAWS TO GET TO ONE OF THE MAIN
RADAR SITES TO REPAIR IT.

AMID ALL THIS ISOLATION.

DOING OKAY.

3.4 MILLION U.S. CITIZENS LIVE
THERE.

AND LOOK AT THIS SATELLITE IMAGE
OF THE ISLAND, LIT UP IN JULY.

DOING THE BEST WE CAN.

HOW YOU DOING?

WE MET JOSE VIDAL STANDING IN
THE SUN, TRYING TO GET A DAY'S
WORTH OF GENERATOR FUEL.

NO, NO.

BASIC NECESSITIES IN THE
SWELTERING HEAT.

MY MOM, I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER.

CUT OFF FROM FAMILY.

ALL OF THIS AS THE GOVERNOR
OF PUERTO RICO SAYS THEY ARE
DEALING WITH A HUMANITARIAN
DISASTER, THAT THEY NEED HELP.

MUDSLIDES LEAVING HOMES
TEETERING ON THE EDGE.

EVA WITH US LIVE TONIGHT.

ON THE GROUND, FEAR OF A
CATASTROPHIC FAILURE AT THE
GUAJATACA DAM.
