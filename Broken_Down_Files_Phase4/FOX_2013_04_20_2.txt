WITH US IS MIKE, THE DAILY
NATIONAL SPHORTS EDITOR.

FOX NEW SYSTEM TOLD THAT
INVESTIGATORS ARE EXPLORING
LINKINGS BETWEEN THE OLDER
BROTHER AND THE CACK CAUSUS
EMERATE BASED ON THE TRAVEL TO
RUSSIA IN THE FIRST HALF OF 20
12 AND INCLUDED DAGIS STAN AND
CHECHNYA .

THE SUSPECT IS IN SERIOUS BUT
STABLE CONDITION HERE WITH
MULTIPLE INJURIES.

WE HAVE A TACTICAL TEAM
GOING TO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE
TO APPROACH THE BOAT.

THE BOAT WITH THE BLUE TARP
OVER IT .

WHAT WE HAD SET UP AND THOUGHT
WE HAD HIM PINNED DOWN 130
A.M. THAT MORNING, WE JUST
MISSED IT AND DIDN'T GET THE
PERIMETER AS WIDE AS WE NEEDED
TO DO .

THAT IS WHERE CAN CAN WE ARE
SURROUNDING THE BOAT.

THIS TIME THE POLICE HAD
CORNERED THE SECOND SUSPECT
AND UNFOLDING LIVE DURING THE
FOX REPORT.

THE INCREASED PRESENCE .

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
, YOU CAN BEAT US UP, BUT WE'LL
GET BACK UP AGAIN AND THAT'S IT.

THE SHOOTOUT IN WATERTOWN LEFT A
19-YEAR-OLD IN SERIOUS
CONDITION.

WE ARE HEARING THERE IS
SOMEBODY IN THE REAR.

WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

OLD GLORY ON DISPLAY IN FEN
WAY PARK THIS AFTERNOON.

903.

YESTERDAY WE TOLD YOU HOW POLICE
WERE USING A THERMAL IMAGING
CAMERA TO CHECK OUT WHAT THE
SUSPECT WAS DOING.

BE AWARE OF THIS.

AND SINCE YOU DIDN'T READ THAT
ANYTHING YOU CAN'T USE AGAINST
HIM.

BUT THE DETERMINATION THEY HAD
TO SURVIVE THAT IS INCREDIBLE
TO ME.

WE JUST HEARD FROM THE U.S.
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.
