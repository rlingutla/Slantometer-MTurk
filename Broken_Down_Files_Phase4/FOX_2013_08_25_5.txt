LET'S FACE IT, THE ASSAD REGIME
AFTER TWO YEARS OF CONFLICT
WOULD NOT BE IN POWER IF IT WERE
NOT FOR RUSSIA AND IRAN, AND
PRIMARILY IRAN.

IT WAS ON SYRIA.

THEY AGREE THE CRISIS IS
UPGRADED, WARRANTS SERIOUS
RESPONSE.

SO NO SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS
OF HOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT
BOOTS ON THE GROUND, WITHOUT
HAVING AMERICANS IN HARM'S WAY.

IF OUR MILITARY WERE TO MAKE A
MOVE IN SYRIA OUTSIDE THE UNITED
NATIONS.

A SENIOR OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL SAYING THERE'S VERY
LITTLE DOUBT PEOPLE WERE GASSED.

I DIDN'T TAKE A VACATION WHEN I
STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF
AUGUST OF 2005, BUT MAYBE I'M A
WORKAHOLIC.

FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD CARE ONE
WIT WHETHER WE HAVE A SECURITY
COUNCIL RESOLUTION OR NOT.

BUT RUSSIA TODAY ISSUING A
WARNING THAT THERE WOULD BE
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES IN THAT
REGION TO THE SECURITY IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, IF WE SHOULD
SUDDENLY USE OUR MILITARY WITH
REGARD TO SYRIA.

VERY INTERESTING.

POPE FRANCIS ALSO EXPRESSING
LOVE WITH PRAYERS AND SOLIDARITY
TO VICTIMS OF THE CONFLICT AND
THOSE SUFFERING, ESPECIALLY THE
CHILDREN.

THE REAL ISSUE HERE IS WHAT TO
DO ABOUT IRAN.

JUST STANDING OFF, THROWING A
FEW MISSILES, DROPPING A FEW
BOMBS ON KEY TARGETS ARE WHAT WE
IN THE MILITARY CALL A FEEL GOOD
BOMBING.

IF THE SYRIANS HAD NOTHING TO
HIDE, WOULD HAVE LET THEM IN
FIVE DAYS AGO.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
WHITE HOUSE AND THE PUTIN
ADMINISTRATION IS SO BAD AND
LACKS SO MUCH CREDIBILITY THAT I
THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT.

SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY IT MAY
BE TOO LATE TO FIND ANYTHING.

SHOULD THAT BE DETERRENT FOR US?

THAT'S WHY I STRESS I DON'T
THINK THE PRESIDENT KNOWS HIS
OWN MIND.

I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HIS
STRATEGY IS.
