AT 28, CHRISTOPHER
RAIBLE HAD SEEN A
BATTLEFIELD BEFORE,
SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN
AND MISSED BY HIS
MOTHER.

POLICE ARE TRACING
WHAT HE WAS UP TO
BEFORE CHECKING INTO
THE MANDALAY BAY LAST
THURSDAY.

POLICE ARE IN CONTACT
WITH DANLEY AND SENIOR
OFFICIALS TELL US
SHE'S EXPECTED TO
RETURN TOMORROW.

IN THE WEEKS BEFORE
HIS ATTACK, PADDOCK
RACKED UP 16
TRANSACTIONS FOR MORE
THAN $10,000 EACH IN
LAS VEGAS CASINOS.

WE'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT GUN LAWS AS TIME
GOES BY.

POLICE HAVE SEARCHED
HOUSES, CARS AND HOTEL
ROOM BUT NOTHING HAS
TURNED UP TO EXPLAIN
WHY HE TURNED TO MASS
MURDER.

GOOD EVENING IN A
PLACE STILL
OVERWHELMED WITH THE
SADNESS OF LIVES LOST,
AT LEAST 59 AND MORE
THAN 500 INJURED,
THERE IS ALSO A
GROWING RECOGNITION
AND APPRECIATION OF
THE NUMBER OF LIVES
SAVED.

ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
SONGS OF MOURNING.

ALSO THE HEROS IN THE
CROWD.

I'LL NEVER FORGET HER
FACE, EVER.

ALL BUT THREE ALL
IDENTIFIED BY
AUTHORITIES AND TODAY
A NUMBER OF MOVING
TRIBUTES WERE HELD AS
STAGGERING LOSS SENDS
RIPPLES OF EMOTION
ACROSS THE NATION.

THESE ARE THE ONES
THAT GOT OUT.

PEOPLE, COPS, FIREMEN,
REGULAR CIVILIANS DID
WHAT THEY HAD TO DO.

SHOULD IT BE LEGAL?

VIDEO OF PEOPLE HELPED
INTO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM SPEAKS TO ALL
HANDS EFFORT THAT
GIVES THIS CITY
SOMETHING TO BE PROUD
OF EVEN IN DARK DAYS.

AS PETE MENTIONED,
ONE OF THE BIGGEST
QUESTION MARKS IS THE
SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND,
OUT OF THE COUNTRY
WHEN THE MASSACRE
HAPPENED BUT REMAINS A
PERSON OF INTEREST FOR
THE AUTHORITIES WHO
WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
IF ANYTHING SHE KNEW
ABOUT THE DEADLY PLOT.

THREE OR FOUR
MINUTES LATER, HE SAID
I HAVE EYES ON HER.

ALMOST LIKE AN
AUTOMATIC.

PLUS, WE CONTINUE OUR
LIVE TEAM COVERAGE FROM LAS
VEGAS WITH BREATHTAKING
TALES OF HEROISM UNDER FIRE.

SHE WROTE I COULD
HAVE WOKEN UP THIS
MORNING WITHOUT MY DAD
BUT I DIDN'T.
