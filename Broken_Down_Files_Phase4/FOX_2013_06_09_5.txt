THEN IN 2009 HE TOOK HIS
FIRST LEGALLY NSA JOB
WORKING AT FACILITIES IN
JAPAN AND HAWAII.

THAT IS THE MESSAGE WE HAVE
TO KEEP IN MIND.

WHAT REACTION ARE WE
GETTING FROM CAPITOL HILL?

YES.

THEY INCLUDE LAWMAKERS FROM
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.

UNFORTUNATELY HE DOES HAVE
MORE INFORMATION.

PEOPLE THAT TRY TO MAKE HIM
HERO IT'S BEYOND ME.

WE HAD OPEN AND CLOSED
HEARINGS.

TERRORISM REMAINS A REAL
THREAT BUT I THINK WE HAVE
THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

HE TIPPED OFF AL-QAEDA A
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

HE IS IN ENEMY TERRITORY
RIGHT NOW.

YOU WATCH HIM IN THIS
INTERVIEW BY THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER, IT'S JUST WHY HE
FELT THE DESPERATE NEED TO
COME FORWARD.

THIS IS UNDER COURT
THINGS YOU WILL SEE WHEN
YOU WATCH THE TAPE, HE SAYS
HE KNEW THE RISKS BUT HE
FELT THE ABUSES HE WAS
WITNESSING AND POSSIBLY
TAKING A PART IN IN TERMS
OF MONITORING PHONE RECORDS
AND SNOOPING, HE THOUGHT
THOSE WERE SO EGREGIOUS AND
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LISTEN?

WHAT HE SAID IN PART OF
THAT TELEVISION INTERVIEW
IS THAT HE IS HOPING THAT A
COUNTRY RECOGNIZES FREE
SPEECH WILL GIVE HIM
ASYLUM?

IF HE DID LEAK THE NSA DATA
AS HE CLAIMS, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT MUST PROSECUTE
HIM TO THE FULL EXTENT OF
THE LAW.

IF HE WAS AWARE OF ANY
ILLEGALITY.

THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
THINK HE IS A HERO WOULD
NOT BE A DEFENSE.

WE HAVE A TREATY WITH HONG
KONG BUT CHINA IS CALLING
THE SHOTS HERE.

DIDN'T LIKE THE C.I.A.

WHITE HOUSE HAS VOWED WHO
IS LEAKING CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION ABOUT THE
PROGRAM WHICH IS RUN BY THE
NSA.
