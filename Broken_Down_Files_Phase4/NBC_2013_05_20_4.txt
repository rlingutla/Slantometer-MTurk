THIS IS BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL THAT ALSO TOOK A DIRECT
HIT FROM THE TORNADO.

IT DOESN'T GET MORE INTENSE ON
PLANET EARTH THAN AN EF-5
TORNADO.

AS MIKE BETTES SAID I'M SURE
WE'LL HEAR MORE BAD NEWS, BRIAN?

HOSPITALS ARE TREATING MORE THAN
120 PATIENTS AFTER THIS TORNADO
INCLUDING ABOUT 70 CHILDREN.

MIKE, WHAT DO YOU SEE AROUND
YOU?

GOOD JOB, TEACH.

WE'RE GOING TO STAY IN THE
AIR.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

MORE THAN LIKELY WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE MORE FATALITIES.

WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, MOST OF
THEM ARE BEING TURNED AWAY.

THIS IS A HUGE, MONSTER TORNADO.

JUST TO GET TO THIS POINT, THIS
ROAD GOES ABOUT TWO MILES TO THE
INTERSTATE.

WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST
MIKE BETTES MADE HIS WAY TO
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

IT'S THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.

OUR TEAM IS THERE ON THE GROUND.

I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE E MADE IT.

SHE SHOWED US WHERE SHE WAS.

THE GRIM SITUATION CONTINUES AT
THIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE
FROM THE NURSES AND DOCTORS AT
THE TRIAGE, THEY ARE TELLING US
THAT THE COUNT NOW IS 24 MISSING
CHILDREN.

OUR TEAM IS THERE ON THE GROUND.

IT'S A MILE RIGHT THERE ON THE
BAILEY WHERE IT TURNS DOWN
SOUTH.
