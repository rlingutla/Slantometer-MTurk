AL-ASSAD IS NOT THE ONLY ONE
WATCHING NOW.

BUT WE GET ON OUR HIGH HORSE AND
BLAME HIM FOR THE WORST CRISIS
IN EUROPE SINCE WORLD WAR II AND
WE DON'T GET A U.N.

SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S THIS
PRESIDENT OR ANY PRESIDENT, WE
SHOULD NOT SHARE WHAT OUR
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UNDER THE
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.

AN AIDE SAID THE PRESIDENT'S
ACTIONS WERE WITHIN HIS
AUTHORITY BUT IT'S APPROPRIATE
TO CONSULT WITH CONGRESS WHEN
THEY CONSIDER NEXT STEPS FOR THE
CRISIS IN SYRIA.

IT WAS TOO WEAK.

THIS TIME IN COLOR.

THE HEAVIEST VOTE THAT A MEMBER
OF CONGRESS HAS IS TO DETERMINE
WHETHER OR NOT THAT WE ARE TO
AUTHORIZE MILITARY FORCE.

I THINK SAFE ZONES STILL MAKE
SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A
WAY TO GET SOME OF THESE SYRIAN
PEOPLE AWAY FROM THESE BOMBS
THAT ARE GOING TO FALL ON THEM,
CONVENTIONAL BOMBS AND
ARTILLERY.

TWO CONGRESSMEN COMING NOW,
FIRST A DEMOCRAT, GREGORY MEEKS
OF NEW YORK.

FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN, WE'VE BEEN
BEATING HIM UP FOR VIOLATIONS OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

REX TILLERSON IS HEADED TO
MOSCOW NEXT WEEK WHERE HE WILL
MEET WITH HIS RUSSIAN COUNTER
PART.

I'LL SHOW YOU ON SATELLITE
IMAGES.

BARREL BOMBING IS AS WELL.

SO IN THESE AREAS, THEY'RE ABLE
TO CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
FLIGHT PATTERN HERE.

ANYTHING ABOUT THE NEXT STEPS?

I DON'T SEE HOW A DICTATOR, A
LEADER OF A COUNTRY WHO HAS
SLAUGHTERED 500,000 CITIZENS
WILL LAST LONG-TERM.

SOMETHING THAT DID NOT TIE THE
HANDS OF THE FUTURE PRESIDENT.

I THINK SO FAR VERY LITTLE.

THIS RUSSIAN BLUSTER, HOW DO
YOU READ IT?
