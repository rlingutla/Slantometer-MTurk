AND IN OREGON,
30-YEAR-OLD CHRIS
MINTZ, A U.S. ARMY
VET, WHO WAS SHOT FIVE
TIMES AFTER DIRECTLY
CONFRONTING A HEAVILY
ARMED GUNMAN WHO HAD
ALREADY KILLED NINE
PEOPLE.

LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU'RE ONE OF THE
LUCKY ONES.

AT LEAST 59 DEAD, OVER
500
WOUNDED AS A SNIPER
OPENS FIRE
FROM A SMASHED-OUT
HOTEL WINDOW
WINDOW HIGH ABOVE A
COUNTRY MUSIC
FESTIVAL, UNLEASHING A
MASSACRE ON THE VEGAS
STRIP.

UMC IS AT CAPACITY
FOR VICTIMS UNLESS
IT'S LIFE THREATENING.

LAS VEGAS OFFICER
CHARLESTON HARTFORD.

HE HIT?

POLICE SAY SOME MAY
HAVE BEEN FULLY
AUTOMATIC.

AUTHORITIES SAY THEY
FOUND MORE THAN A
DOZEN WEAPONS INSIDE
THOSE ROOMS.

WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
ABOUT THE GUNMAN AND
HIS MASSIVE ARSENAL.

MANY THEN FLEEING TO
THE FESTIVAL'S MAIN
ENTRANCE.

HE POSTED THIS PHOTO
OF HIS SHOES STAINED
WITH THE BLOOD OF 46
VICTIMS.

IT IS HARD TO
WATCH THAT SMARTPHONE
VIDEO OF THE ATTACK
WITHOUT IMAGINING
YOURSELF IN SUCH A
SITUATION.

MIKE CROCK'S FRIEND
ROB IS FACING MORE
SURGERY, BUT WE'RE
GLAD TO REPORT HE IS
EXPECTED TO RECOVER.

POLICE SAY HE CHECKED
INTO THE MANDALAY BAY
HOTEL LAST THURSDAY
AND BROUGHT IN ALL THE
GUNS AND AMMUNITION
HIMSELF ALONG WITH HIS
LUGGAGE, KEEPING IT
HIDDEN FROM THE
HOUSEKEEPING STAFF.

FINALLY WE RAN INTO AN
AMBULANCE.

AND ONE OF THE YOUNG
MEN THAT WAS IN THE
BACK OF THE TRUCK AS I
WAS CARRYING HIM, HE
PASSED AWAY.

AFTER THE SHOOTING
STOPPED --
 THEY DO HAVE A
LARGE CREW OUT HERE.

STAY WITH US.

SALE OF NEW MACHINE
GUNS, SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS ARE LEGAL IN
MOST IF NOT ALL
STATES.

REGISTERED NURSE IN
TENNESSEE.
