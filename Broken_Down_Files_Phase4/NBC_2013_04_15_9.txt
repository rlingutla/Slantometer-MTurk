EVERYONE WAS IN FEAR.

IT WASN'T UNTIL 2003 THAT POLICE
TRACKED DOWN DOMESTIC TERRORIST
ERIC ROBERT RUDOLPH.

IT WAS REALLY, REALLY LOUD.

A NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIAL
E-MAILS AND SAYS THIS.

WE CAN SEE LOOKING AT TAPE OF
THE FINISH LINE THE DIGITAL
SEEMS TO SAY THIS WAS THE 409,
FOUR HOUR, NINE MINUTE FINISHING
MARK.

PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON.

THIS AFTERNOON IN
BOSTON DURING THE MARATHON.

BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE BEING
QUESTIONED INCLUDING SOME WITH
INJURIES WHO WERE TAKEN TO
BOSTON HOSPITALS.

ABSOLUTELY.

WELL ONCE THE SECONDARY
EXPLOSION WENT OFF, THEY KNEW IT
WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT OF THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE CITY LIKE A
GAS MAIN.

THAT'S RIGHT.

I CAN TELL YOU THIS.

IT IS A BUSY AREA ON A NORMAL
DAY.

A CAR BOMB FAILED TO EXPLODE AND
WAS DISARMED BEFORE IT COULD
HURT ANYONE.

MARATHON DAY, PATRIOTS DAY
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A GREAT DAY
EVERY DAY IN BOSTON.

NO ONE KNEW WHAT TO DO.

ALSO THE DEFINITION OF
TERRORISM.

TELL US HOW FAR YOU WERE AWAY,
WHAT YOU REMEMBER, WHAT YOU SAW
AND FELT.

DAN BONNGENO WAS THE LEAD SECRET
SERVICE AGENT AS PEOPLE PACKED
THE NATIONAL MALL IN DOWNTOWN
D.C.
A POTENTIAL TERRORIST COULD HAVE
BEEN HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT.

BUT PEOPLE THOUGHT, AND YOU
CAN'T BLAME THEM, THAT THIS WAS
SOME KIND OF CANNON, A PLANNED
THING.
