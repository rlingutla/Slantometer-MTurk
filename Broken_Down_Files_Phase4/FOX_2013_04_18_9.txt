THIS VIDEO AND I DON'T
THINK WE CAN SHOW THIS TO
YOU ENOUGH.

THE FBI SAYING HERE IN
BOSTON HOURS AGO QUOTE
EACH PIECE OF EVIDENCE
MOVES US FORWARD TO
JUSTICE.

IN A MOMENT, WE WILL HEAR
THOUGH FROM A MAN WHO WAS
WORKED INSIDE THE FBI
FIGHTING TERRORISM.

HE WAS STANDING, THE LITTLE
BOY WAS ON THAT LITTLE
BARRICADE NEXT TO HIS
LITTLE SISTER WHOSE LEG WAS
BLOWN OFF AND HIS MOTHER
WHO HAD SURGERY ON HER
BRAIN.

AND YOU AND I HAVE HAD A
LOT OF LATE NIGHTS PAST
WEEK IN BOSTON.

IN UNCONVENTIONAL
WARFARE WHAT YOU ARE
STARTING TO SEE MORE AND
MORE OF IS THE USE OF
SOCIAL MEDIA TO
COMMUNICATE.

AND THEY ARE SET UP FOR
THAT, WE DO BELIEVE RICK.

OTHER PHOTOS SHOULD NOT BE
DEEMED CREDIBLE AND UN --
THEY UNNECESSARILY DIVERT
THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION IN
THE WRONG DIRECTION AND
CREATE UNDUE WORK FOR VITAL
RESOURCES.

WELL, I THINK BILL,
PROBABLY YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO COME OUT AND TELL THE
PUBLIC EVERYTHING THAT YOU
HAVE.

NOW THE FOCUS IS ON THESE
FACES AND THESE TWO PEOPLE.

KNOWING THAT THEY ARE GOING
PUBLIC WITH THIS
INFORMATION AS OF 515
EASTERN TIME TWO HOURS AGO?

THIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL
DESCRIBED TO US EARLIER BY
FBI CONTACTS AS VERY YOUNG
AND CAUCASIAN.

IS THERE A REASONABLE
EXPLANATION OR WHAT ARE WE
HEARING ABOUT WHAT EXPLAINS
THAT OVER THE PAST 48
HOURS?

THEY COULD PROVE CRITICAL
IN SOLVING THIS CASE.

YES BILL, IT IS WHAT I
EXPECTED THAT THE PHOTOS
WOULD BE RELEASED BECAUSE
IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG TO
SIFT THROUGH THE WHOLE
CO-LODGE OF PHOTOS THEY HAD
AND FILM ALL THE WAY BEFORE
THE FINISH LINE TO THE
FINISH LINE.

LET'S GET A BREAK HERE IN A
MOMENT OUR COVERAGE
CONTINUES OF THE BOMBINGS
AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.

YEAH.

LOOK AT THESE FACES LOOK
AT THESE PEOPLE.

THAT COMMENT THAT WAS MADE
BY THE FBI I THINK IS SO
TELLING.

YOUNG MEN IN BASEBALL CAPS
FROM THE FBI IS CALLING  1 SCREEN
