AGAIN I'M READING FROM THE
OKLAHOMAN.

WHAT DO YOU GUYS NEED RIGHT
NOW.

EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEMS
WERE NOT UP TO DATE THERE
WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH TO DO
THAT AND TODAY THEY GOT 16
MINUTES' WARNING WHICH, IN
TORNADO ALLEY IS, A LONG
TIME THAT STORMS WERE ON
THE WAY.

CAN I TELL YOU FIRST HAND.

THE LOCAL NBC STATION IS
REPORTING THAT SOME 24
CHILDREN ARE STILL TRAPPED
THERE AND THERE ARE
REPORTS, IN FACT, THAT THE
SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE.

AGAIN, WE HAVE
CORRESPONDENTS ON THE
GROUND INCLUDING OUR OWN
CASEY STEGALL AND IF HE IS
AVAILABLE WE WILL GET TO
HIM.

NOW THIS REPORT OF FOUR
MORE AT THE 7/11.

BRICKS HEAR IF COMING IN.

THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE
WARNING WAS LAST NIGHT IN
ONE PARTICULAR TOWN.

TWO MILES WIDE RIPS THROUGH
AREAS SOUTH OF MOORE.

SEVEN MINUTES BEFORE
700 IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

THE CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER
HAS CONFIRMED SIX DEATHS IN
MOORE.

IT IS TWISTED METAL AROUND
TELEPHONE POLES.

REMINISCENT OF JOPLIN,
MISSOURI.

THERE IS NO WAY FOR US TO
KNOW AT THIS MOMENT HOW
DEVASTATING THIS HAS BEEN
IN THE WAY OF HUMAN INJURY
AND LOSS OF LIFE.

RICK, THIS IS HARD TO
BELIEVE.

HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS AFTER
999, THE PROBLEM WAS THAT
SO MANY PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE
ADEQUATE STORM SHELTERS.

THE REPORTER FROM THE NBC
STATION SAID AND I QUOTE
I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE GOING
TO START PULLING THESE
LITTLE BODIES OUT OF THE
RUBBLE VERY SOON.

IT REALLY IS.

OKLAHOMA SUCKER PUNCHED BY
SECOND ROUND OF TWISTERS
STILL STAGGERING FROM
YESTERDAY'S TORNADOES.
