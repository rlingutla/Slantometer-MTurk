I NOW HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND
I WILL HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY
AND CARRY IT VERY PROUDLY, I
WILL TELL YOU THAT.

THEY STILL HAD THAT
INTELLIGENCE.

BIG IMPACT.

MANY, MANY LINES.

I DO CHANGE.

AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
FLEXIBILITY.

PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT
ACKNOWLEDGES IT'S NOW HIS
CHALLENGE TO SOLVE.

IT IS A TERRIBLE AFFRONT TO
HUMANITY, I CAN TELL YOU.

WE ALSO SAW U.N. AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY HOLDING UP PICTURES
TODAY SAYING, IF THE U.N.

DO THEY JUST WANT TO PUNISH OR
DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
BASHAR AL ASSAD?

THE PRESIDENT FIRMLY CONDEMNED
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN
SYRIA, PLACING THE BLAMING
-- BLAME SQUARELY ON THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT.

ON THE WORLD STAGE, THE
PRESIDENT SAYS HIS POSITION ON
ASSAD, ON SYRIA, HAS CHANGED
AFTER SEEING THE IMAGES OF THE
FAMILIES, THE CHILDREN, THE
VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THOSE WHO DID SURVIVE GASPING
FOR AIR.

BUT MOST OF THOSE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THE STOCKPILES, ARE
GONE SO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
USED HERE WERE HIDDEN.

TONIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR WHAT HE
SAID.

HOW HE'LL HANDLE THIS, WILL THE
U.S. ACT?

ABDULLAH MADE IT CLEAR, THE
WORLD IS LOOKING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

I BELIEVE UNDER YOUR
LEADERSHIP WE WILL BE ABLE TO
UNRAVEL THIS VERY COMPLICATED
SITUATION.

AND IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE,
AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S
ALREADY HAPPENED, THAT MY
ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD
HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

AND AFTER ASSAD'S MASSIVE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN 2013,
HE TWEETED "DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA,
FIX U.S.A."
ADDING, "IF YOU DO MANY BAD
THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT
FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!"
