MANY OF THE PICTURES WE ARE
GETTING IS VIA THEIR FANTASTIC
STAFF OF JOURNALISTS AND WE ARE
HOPING THEY STAY SAFE.

A LITTLE EASIER TO GET YOUR ACT
TOGETHER IF YOU CAN SEE IT
COMING.

YOU WILL,UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE GETTING
INTO HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS.

I'M ON THE EAST SIDE OF
OKLAHOMA CITY NORTH OF EDMOND.

AND THAT IS, ONCE AGAIN, I WANT
TO POINT OUT EXACTLY WHERE IT
IS AT ON THE RADAR.

SAID YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL THAT
DEBRIS IS GOING TO COME IN YOUR
DIRECTION.

SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY WHERE WE
HAVE REPORTS OF DEBRIS AND SOME
DAMAGE AS WELL A TORNADO
WARNING JUST NORTH AND EAST OF
CHANDLER OKLAHOMA.

I CHECKED THE NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE AND NORMAN OKLAHOMA IS
WHERE THE STORM PREDICTION
CENTER IS.

WE WILL TALK WITH THE MAYOR OF
WICHITA RIGHT AFTER THIS.

EVER SINCE THE SYSTEM MOVE
THROUGH IT HAS BEEN AN EERY
HUMID UNNATURAL FEELING THE
LAST FEW DAYS.

BUT WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IT
IS ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW.

GOSH THE HOT AIR AND THEN YOU
GET IT IS REAL COOL AND YOU
HAVE SHIVERS UP YOUR SPINE.

AND THE SKY IS SO CLOSE.

I'M SURE THAT DID SOME
DAMAGE BUT I'M GLAD YOU ARE
OKAY TONIGHT.

JANICE STAY WITH ME FOR JUST A
SECOND.

DEBRIS METAL ALL SORTS OF
MESS IN THE THE SKY.

AND I KNOW YOU TOOK SOME
PICTURES AND TELL ME WHAT I'M
SEEING?

SO FAR THE DAMAGE IS LIMITED TO
A LOT OF TREES ARE DAMAGED.

IT IS INCREDIBLE VIDEO.

I WANT TO CLEAR THIS UP BECAUSE
I THINK PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.
