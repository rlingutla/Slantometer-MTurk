BY LAW, FBI OFFICIALS SAID,
MONITORING HAD TO STOP, BARRING
NEW NEGATIVE INFORMATION.

YOUNGER BROTHER DZHOKHAR, 19,
HAD JUST BECOME A U.S. CITIZEN,
ONCE A LIFEGUARD, HE WAS AN
ALL-STATE WRESTLER AND COLLEGE
STUDENT.

LIFE RETURNED TO A CITY THAT WAS
ON LOCKDOWN FRIDAY.

ACKNOWLEDGED IT INTERVIEWED
TAMERLAN IN 2011 BASED ON A TIP
FROM THE RUSSIANS.

I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS BACK
TO BOSTON, A CITY THAT AMERICA
FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS WEEK.

ARE THEY NOT EXPECTING ANY SENSE
OF FRUSTRATION OR REMORSE OVER
HAVING MISSED WHAT COULD HAVE
BEEN A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE?

WE APPRECIATE IT.

LITTLE BOAT THAT KEPT A BIG
SECRET, THE UNLIKELY HIDEOUT FOR
AMERICA'S MOST WANTED MAN.

WAS ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED?

OUR CECILIA VEGA WITH THIS MAN'S
TONIGHT, FOR THE FIRST TIME,
WE'RE GETTING A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT
GROUND ZERO OF THE BLAST THAT
LEVELED AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD.

SO WE BOTH FEEL BLESSED.

IMMIGRANTS FROM THE RUSSIAN
CAUCUSES, THE BROTHERS CAME WITH
THEIR PARENTS TO THE U.S. AS
CHILDREN.

I JUST FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T BEEN
BREATHING ALL WEEK.

IF THEY'RE ABLE TO
SUCCESSFULLY RIP THAT OFF, HE'LL
BE FULLY EXPOSED.

THEY THRIVED ATTENDING TOP
BOSTON SCHOOLS.

AND HE LOOKED AT WHAT HE THOUGHT
WAS A BODY RIGHT BEHIND THE BOX.

WHAT WAS HIS ALLEGED MOTIVE, AND
WAS HE PART OF A LARGER PLOT?

DAGESTAN IS A POOR AND DANGEROUS
REGION IN SOUTHERN RUSSIA.

SHE INSISTS HER SONS WERE SET
UP, AND THAT HER ELDEST SON WAS
INVESTIGATED BECAUSE HE LOVED
ISLAM AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
BAD.

BUT AMY WAS FINE.
