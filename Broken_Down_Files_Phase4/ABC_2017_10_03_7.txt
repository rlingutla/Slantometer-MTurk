HE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHY
WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS?

THAT GUN OUTFITTED WITH A SCOPE
TYPICALLY USED FOR HUNTING AND A
BIPOD TO STABILIZE THE WEAPON.

ONE OF THE 23 WEAPONS HE HAD
WITH HIM IN THAT ROOM, THE
EVIDENCE MARKER STILL IN PLACE.

THE E.R.

LABELED THE SHOOTER'S
GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY, AS
CENTRAL TO THE ONGOING
INVESTIGATION, MUCH MORE THAN
SIMPLY ANOTHER WITNESS.

IT TURNS OUT HE HAD A CAMERA
ATTACHED TO A CART IN THE
HALLWAY SO HE WOULD KNOW WHEN
POLICE WERE MOVING IN.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD YOUR REPORT
THERE THAT AUTHORITIES ARE NOW
CALLING THE SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND
A PERSON OF INTEREST.

SO MANY OF THE PATIENTS WITH
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

A MASS MURDERER.

ON THE GROUND, PEOPLE RUNNING,
HUDDLING TOGETHER, SHOTS FIRED
FOR NEARLY NINE MINUTES.

YEAH, I SAW A GIRL, LIKE TWO
ROWS AHEAD OF ME, AND SHE GOT
HIT IN THE NECK AND WENT DOWN.

THE DOOR BLOWN OFF.

AND SEEING WHAT WE SAW.

OF THE PATIENTS HE HELPED SAVE.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE WERE
GIVEN ACCESS TODAY TO ONE OF THE
TRAUMA WARDS AT A HOSPITAL RIGHT
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

THE GUNMAN CHECKED INTO THAT
HOTEL WITH TEN SUITCASES.

AND YOU WERE SEEING PEOPLE
AROUND YOU GET HIT FIRST?

THE LOVED ONES WHO DIDN'T MAKE
IT HOME.

ALL OF THEIR LIVES CUT SHORT AT
THAT CONCERT HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

NEW IMAGES INSIDE THE KILLER'S
HOTEL ROOM.
