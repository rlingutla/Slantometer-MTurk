YOU HAVE AN EXPECTATION
TO PRIVACY THAT GOVERNMENT
WILL STAY OUT OF YOUR
BEDROOM THAT GOVERNMENT
WILL STAY OUT OF YOUR BANK
ACCOUNTS YOUR MEDICAL
RECORDS, YOUR EDUCATIONAL
RECORDS.

LIKE A WALL OF BOXES ALL
THE WAY ACROSS.

OUTRAGE OVER THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY'S
COLLECTION OF CALL DATA
RECORDS FROM BILLIONS OF
PHONE CALLS IN THE U.S. HAS
ONCE AGAIN UNITED CIVIL
LIBERTARIANS ON THE RIGHT
AND THE LEFT.

RAND PAUL WASN'T IN
CONGRESS AT THE TIME.

YEAH.


SNOWDEN ALSO TOLD THE
GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER CHINA IS
NOT AN ENEMY OF THE UNITED
STATES.

HERE HE IS.

ON THE LIBERAL LEFT YOU
HAVE FOLKS LIKE FORMER OHIO
CONGRESSMAN DENNIS KUCINICH
WHO HAS RUN FOR PRESIDENT
HIMSELF TWICE.

BROUGHT BACK TO THE UNITED
STATES.

HE HAS SINCE EMERGED AS A
REAL HARSH CRITIC AND EACH
PUSHED TO BLOCK THE PATRIOT
ACT'S REAUTHORIZATION.

BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
VERY IFFY.

EXPECTS THE COMPANY TO WORK
FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
AND ONLY DEMOCRATS NEXT
YEAR.

LISTEN.

WHEN YOU ARE ON CHINESE
TERRITORY YOU DON'T BARGAIN
WITH THE CHINESE.

TO SNOOP ON EVERYTHING WE
ARE DOING ONLINE.

AND EXECUTIVES OF SOME OF
AMERICA'S BIGGEST TECH
COMPANIES INSIST THEY ARE
NOT GIVING THE FEDS DIRECT
ACCESS.

THE KENTUCKY REPUBLICAN
ALSO SAYS HE HOPES THE CASE
EVENTUALLY REACHES THE
SUPREME COURT.


WALL STREET ALSO REACTED TO
THIS CONTROVERSY.

CHINA IS AN ENEMY OF THE
UNITED STATES.

THIS IS WHAT WE OBJECTED
TO AND WHAT OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS PARTLY FOUGHT THE
REVOLUTION OVER IS THEY DID
NOT WANT GENERALIZED
WARRANTS WHERE YOU COULD GO
HOUSE TO HOUSE WITH
SOLDIERS LOOKING FOR THINGS
OR NOW FROM COMPUTER TO
COMPUTER TO PHONE TO PHONE
WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHO YOU
ARE TAGHTING WELL PAUL
BLAMES BOTH PARTIES IN
CONGRESS TOO MUCH EXECUTIVE
POWER.
