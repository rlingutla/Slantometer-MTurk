WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT THE
UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF
THE WEST TO BACK OFF ON THEIR
ANNEXATION, THEIR INVASION AND
ANNEXING OF CRIMEA.


DOES THIS MEAN AMERICAN MILITARY
ACTION IN SYRIA?

IF AN AIR STRIKE OR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT
WOULD BE A TEST OF HOW GOOD A
RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT COULD
HAVE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF
RUSSIA.

THIS WAS FROM 2013.

THAT'S BRAND NEW.

THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH
THE SYRIANS.

HEZBOLLAH IS IN THERE AND THE
IRANIANS SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.

THE AMERICANS JUST SAID WE'RE
ORGANIZING A COALITION TO TAKE
HIM OUT.

THAT'S THE THING.

THIS INCIDENT IS NEW.

PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS GIVEN AS A
LIST OF BAD OPTIONS.

AND I THINK FURTHER IT IS VERY
IMPORTANT THAT THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT CONSIDER CAREFULLY
THEIR CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE
ASSAD REGIME.

IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

IT REQUIRES A SERIOUS RESPONSE.

HERE'S WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE
REX TILLERSON SAID 30 MINUTES
AGO.

THIS IS AS COMPLICATED AS ANY
FOREIGN MATNER THE WORLD RIGHT
NOW AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE
DYING BEFORE OUR EYES.

I DON'T THINK HE WANTS TO BACK
AWAY FROM HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE IRANIAN REGIME AND THE
SYRIAN REGIME.

THIS SITUATION IS VERY OLD.

SO I THINK THEY'RE FLYING A BIT
BY THE SEAT OF THEIR PANTS.

HE'S TRYING TO FORM A COALITION.
