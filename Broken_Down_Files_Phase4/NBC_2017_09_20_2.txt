SIGNS OF LIFE.

NOW FAMILIES ACROSS
THE I ISLAND TRYING TO
PREPARE FOR THE HUMAN
DARKNESS OF LIFE OFF
THE GRID.

PEDRON RODE OUT THE
STORM IN HIS HOME AND
TODAY RETURNED TO HIS
BUSINESS.

TONIGHT, IN THE WAKE
OF HURRICANE MARIA,
PARTS OF PUERTO RICO
ARE DESPERATE.

I HAVEN'T TALKED TO
MY MOM EITHER.

SHE HAS TO TAKE CARE
OF HER DAUGHTER, AND
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN.

STREETS ARE LITTERED
WITH DOWNED POWER
LINES.

MANY ROADS ARE
IMPASSABLE.

STANDING IN LINE FOR
HOURS TO GET GAS TO
POWER THEIR GENERATOR.

AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE
JUST NOW STARTING TO
GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT
THE DEVASTATION.

TONIGHT THE MILLIONS
OF AMERICANS THERE
WAIT AS AN URGENT
RELIEF EFFORT KICKS
INTO HIGH GEAR.

HERE MANY ROADS ARE
IMPASSABLE AND
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS
ARE DOWN WHICH MEANS
IT COULD TAKE QUITE A
WHILE TO GET A HANDLE
ON THE FULL SCOPE OF
MARIA'S DESTRUCTION.

COMMUNICATIONS ARE
SPOTTY.

WATER IS RUNNING
SHORT.

FOR MANY IN PUERTO
RICO, THE CLEANUP IS
JUST BEGINNING.

VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE
ISLAND IS WITHOUT
POWER.

MARIA'S DEATH TOLL IS
NOW UP TO 18 ACROSS
THE CARIBBEAN
INCLUDING ONE DEATH
HERE IN PUERTO RICO.

WE'RE DESPERATE.

REALLY DEVASTATING.

MANY AREAS UNREACHABLE
BY LAND OR BY PHONE
AND VIRTUALLY THE
ENTIRE U.S.
