DO NOT OPEN SPAM.

I MEAN, THIS IS AN
UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK, JULIE,
UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER
SEEN.

HACKERS USING MALICIOUS
SOFTWARE STOLEN FROM THE NSA
TO CONDUCT WHAT IS BELIEVED TO
BE THE LARGEST RANSOMWARE
ATTACK ON RECORD.

BUT THE ATTACK ALSO TARGETED
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND
BUSINESSES IN NEARLY 100
COUNTRIES.

MANY WERE FORCED TO CANCEL OR
DELAY ROUTINE PROCEDURES LIKE
X-RAYS, VITAL PROCEDURES LIKE
CANCER TREATMENTS AND NO ONE
HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.

BUT AS FOR, SAY, IT'S NOT
LIKELY TO BE A GOVERNMENT.

THERE ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE
MORE ATTACKS.


BOTTOM LINE AMAZING IS THIS
ATTACK WAS STOPPED BY A SAVVY
22-YEAR-OLD BASED RESEARCHER
WHO STOPPED THIS ATTACK USING
A $11 DOMAIN.

THIS IS A SCREENSHOT OF WHAT
THE VIRUS DUBBED WANT TO CRY.

IT GETS INTO SPAM E-MAIL OR
ATTACHMENTS, IT LOCKS YOUR
COMPUTER HOLDING IT AND ITS
DATA HOSTAGE UNTIL USER HAS TO
PAY RANSOM.

HACKERS EXPLOITED THIS FLAW TO
INFECT COMPUTERS WITH
RANSOMWARE.

WELL,
COMPANIES ACROSS THE GLOBE
RIGHT NOW RACING TO RECOVER
AFTER A MASSIVE CYBER ATTACK.

BACK UP YOUR DATA.

IT IS THE LARGEST ATTACK OF
THIS TYPE AND HACKERS USED
MESSAGES THAT WERE FIRST
DEPLOYED BY THE NATIONAL
SECURITY AGENCY IN SECRET BUT
OF COURSE THESE MESSAGES WERE
LEAKED ON THE INTERNET WHICH
ALLOWED HACKERS TO THEN USE
IT.

ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE
TO OFTEN GROUND OURSELVES IN
AS SECURITY PROFESSIONALS IS
ALTHOUGH WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT
THE NATION STATE ATTACKS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BECOME
SENSATIONALIZED IN THE NEWS,
THE REALITY IS 80% OF WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH ON A
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IS ORGANIZED
CRIMINAL GANGS.

THE SIDE AND SPEED HITTING
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS
INCLUDING IN HUNDREDS OF
COMPANIES INCLUDING THE U.S.,
UK, CHINA.

THIS ANONYMOUS RESEARCHER
TWEETING I WILL CONFESS THAT I
WAS UNAWARE REGISTERING THE
DOMAIN WILL STOP THE MALWARE
UNTIL AFTER I REGISTERED IT SO
INITIALLY, IT WAS ACCIDENTAL.

IBM IS SATISFYING THE
DAMAGE, JULIE.

BRITAIN PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM
WAS ONE OF THE VERY HARDEST
HIT.

IN THIS CASE USERS HAD TO PAY
UP TO $600 TO GET ACCESS
AGAIN.
