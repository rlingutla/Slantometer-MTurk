REFERRING TO HIS BRUTAL,
UNABASHED BARBARISM.

SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN
AMONG THE VICTIMS.

THE DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
UNLEASHED IN SYRIA.

THAT'S A REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S FAILURE TO PUNISH SYRIA
FOR CROSSING THE SO-CALLED RED
LINE WHEN IT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN 2013.

A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

AND HIS FUNDAMENTAL DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN DECENCY.

SURVIVORS BEING SPRAYED OFF,
AFTER WAR PLANES DROPPED WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A TOXIC GAS.

IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER
SIX YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA, THERE
COULD BE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
THAN WHAT MANY HAVE ALREADY
SEEN.

AN APPARENT WAR CRIME, A
SUSPECTED SARIN GAS ATTACK BY
THE GOVERNMENT KILLING DOZENS
AND SICKENING MANY MORE, YOUNG
CHILDREN AMONG THE VICTIMS.

I'M NOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO
BE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD.

RESCUE WORKERS DESPERATELY WORK
TO WASH THE CHEMICAL FROM THE
VICTIMS.

THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDING.

AND CALLED OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN,
SAYING THEY BEAR GREAT MORAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS.

WAS NOT TRUE.

WE ARE STAYING AWAY FROM THE
MOST GRUESOME MOMENTS.

THE GAS ATTACKS ARE
CONTINUING EVERY DAY AND NO ONE
IS DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THIS
GAS ATTACK.

FOLLOWING TWO CHLORINE GAS
ATTACKS OVER THE PAST WEEK.

TONIGHT, OUR TEAM HAS TAKEN
GREAT CARE TO POUR THROUGH THE
IMAGES FIRST, BUT WE WARN YOU,
THEY'RE STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE.

"THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME ARE A
CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAST
ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS AND
IRRESOLUTION."

THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THE
ATTACK "REPREHENSIBLE" AND SAID
IT "CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
CIVILIZED WORLD."
