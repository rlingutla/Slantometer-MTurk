WHAT ARE THE BIG MISSES PIECES?

OF WORK TO DO.

THERE'S NO EASY BOX TO PUT
PADDOCK IN.

THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO THOSE
CO-WORKERS AND BOSSES TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT MADE THIS GUY TICK.

ONE IN LAS VEGAS THE WEEKEND
BEFORE THIS SHOOTING AND ANOTHER
IN LAST AUGUST IN CHICAGO DURING
THE LOLLAPALOOZA MUSIC FESTIVAL.

WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE IN THE WEST
COAST NEWS HUB THIS AFTERNOON.

THE NRA EVEN SAYING THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED
AT.

OUR FOCUS, AS WE SAID THE
LAST COUPLE DAYS, HAS BEEN ON
HEALING AND UNITING THE COUNTRY.

ANOTHER POSSIBLE LEAD THAT THE
FBI HAS SAID THEY HAVE NOT HAD A
PROBLEM ACCESSING PADDOCK'S
ELECTRONIC FILES, COMPUTER AND
PHONE THAT COULD CORROBORATE HER
THE UNLV FOOTBALL PLAYERS WILL
BE WEARING A SPECIAL HELMET TO
HONOR THE VICTIMS OF THE
SHOOTING.

THE SCHOOL TWEETED THIS PHOTO.

WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
LAS VEGAS GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND.

SHE DIDN'T.

THE PREGAME CEREMONY IS TO HONOR
THE VICTIMS AND FIRST RESPONDERS
OF THE DAY.

MAY NOT BE A REASONABLE REASON
BUT THERE IS USUALLY A REASON.

THEY PUSHED DOWN THE FENCES AND
RAN TO GET AWAY AND ENDED UP
BETWEEN THE RUNWAYS AND THE
TAXIWAYS.

STEPHEN PADDOCK IS A MAN THAT
SPENT DECADES ACQUIRING WEAPONS
AND AMMO AND LIVING A SECRET
LIFE.

THEN WE HAD REPORTS OF GUN SHOTS
AT THE AIRPORT.

IN THE COURSE OF THE
INVESTIGATION, THEY NEED TO TALK
TO THAT WOMAN.

IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY
NEED TO GET TO, THEY CAN
WITHHOLD INFORMATION.

AS FOR THE $100,000 THAT
FOLLOWED, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
GOOD-BYE MONEY THAT PADDOCK WAS
ENDING THEIR RELATIONSHIP.
