INCREDIBLE TALENT WITHIN
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FBI AND
CIA.

I'M GOING TO SEE --
 IS HE ALIVE?

HE'S ALIVE.

I'M NOT SURPRISED TO HEAR OF
MORE OF THEM COMING DOWN WHERE
YOU ARE.

IT IS THE STATED POLICY OF THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE
ANYONE LIKE THIS WHO CREATES A
CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES AND
TREAT THEM IN THE REGULAR
CIVILIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM.

THAT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL THING
AT THE TIME.

WE ARE KBROOGRIEVING THIS LOSS
ASK THAT THE MEDIA RESPECT OUR
PRIVACY AT THIS TIME.

THE FBI IS IN CHARGE AS THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT ENTITY FOR THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF
THE INVESTIGATION.

WE BELIEVE HE SURVIVED ONE OR
MORE BULLET WOUNDS LAST NIGHT IN
A HAIL OF GUNFIRE.

OUR REPORTS ARE RICOCHETTING
AROUND AND PEOPLE VIA BROADCAST
OR SOCIAL MEDIA OR TELEVISION
CREWS, PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK IN
NEWTOWN ARE REACTING WITH
CHEERS.

YOU SEE AN FBI AGENT GETTING OUT
OF THE LATEST CAR TO ARRIVE.

NOW THE QUESTION IS, OF COURSE,
WHAT HAPPENS NOW.

IT'S HARD TO GET AWAY WITH
SOMETHING BAD IN THIS COUNTRY.

WE HAVE LEARNED FROM WHDH IN NEW
BEDFORD, MASS, THREE PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

AGAIN, THIS IS -- THIS WAS THE
STANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL
DAY.

IT'S GETTING TOUGHER BECAUSE THE
CAMERA LENS IS OVERWHELMED BY
THE STROBES.

I'LL BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

ONE MORE THING.

IN CUSTODY AND ALIVE.
