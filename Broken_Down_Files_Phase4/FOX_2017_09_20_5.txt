ALMOST EVERY RECORD IN PUERTO
RICO AT RECORD FLOOD STAGE.

SOMEWHERE FARTHER IN FROM NEW
YORK CITY UP AROUND PARTS OF THE
NORTHEAST, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT
WE DO KNOW, ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE
FOR A STRONG HURRICANE.

THAT IS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
TEAMS TO MEDICAL TEAMS TO SEARCH
AND RESCUE TEAMS.

IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME
TO RECOVER THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
THE ISLAND.

VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO
HAVE FRAGILE POWER SYSTEMS.

DO WE HAVE A DISTRICT HIT
SOMEWHERE?

THE SECOND ONE, THE GOVERNOR OF
PUERTO RICO, HELP FOR THOSE
PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR
BELONGINGS.

POWER LINES ALL OVER PUERTO
RICO.

PUERTO RICAN OFFICIALS SAY
DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES WILL HAVE
TO BE REBUILD.

WE'LL SPEAK WITH A WOMAN RIDING
OUT THE STORM, HIDING IN HER
CLOSET.

WATER LEVELS COULD RISE UP TO
NINE FEET ON PUERTO RICO WITH
LARGE AND DESTRUCTIVE WAVES.

FOR THAT MATTER, I ASK DIRECTLY
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE LAST
NIGHT.

THE HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL AS A
CATEGORY FOUR.

IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD ON PUERTO
RICO'S NORTHERN COAST, THE MAYOR
SAID FOUR OUT OF FIVE HOMES ARE
DESTROYED.

THEY SAY THE CENTER OF THE STORM
IS EXPECTED TO CROSS OVER THE
COAST OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
TONIGHT BEFORE MOVING TO THE
TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE
BAHAMAS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS APPROVED AN
EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR PUERTO
RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

HOPEFULLY TO THE EAST OF TURKS
AND CAICOS THAT GOT DEVASTATED
BY IRMA A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE FULL
EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE OF THIS
MONSTER HURRICANE LEFT US HERE.

EVERYBODY FEELING THE IMPACTS OF
THIS STORM, THIS IS THE FUTURE
RADAR.

BACK TO CONTINUING COVERAGE OF
HURRICANE MARIA PUMMELLING
PUERTO RICO AND ST. CROIX AND
OTHERS.
