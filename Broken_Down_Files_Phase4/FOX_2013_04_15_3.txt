WE ARE STILL SEEING PEOPLE,
MARATHON RUNNERS IN THE
AREA, JUST A FEW.

BUT TO WHICH WE ARE NOT
GOING TO SUBJECT FAMILIES
AT FAMILY HOUR.

THIS NEWS CONFERENCE NOW
SCHEDULED FOR 830 P.M.
EASTERN DAYLIGHT TIME.

BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS THEY
MEET THAT THRESHOLD
DEFINITION OF TERRORISM.

SO I KNEW HOW TO SIGHTED
THEM FROM THE FINISH.

IF YOU ARE PLANNING AN
EVENT OF ANY KIND, YOU HAVE
SOME SORT OF GOAL IN MIND.

RIGHT NEAR COPLEY SQUARE.

THAT'S BEEN DISPLAYED FOR A
FEW MINUTES.

WE'RE ALSO GETTING THE
DISPATCH RECORDINGS FROM
THE SCENE.

I WONDER IF YOU WOULD TELL
US WHAT YOU WITNESSED.

WE'RE NOW FIVE HOURS BEYOND
THAT SHEPARD, AND THE SCENE
TONIGHT NEITHER FINISH LINE
WHERE WE JUST CAME FROM IS
STUNNING.

WE WILL GET PEOPLE OUT OF
THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS.

VIDEO FROM SURVEILLANCE
CAMERAS TRYING TO FIND
CLUES ANYBODY THEY CAN SEE
ON THOSE VIDEO HE VIDEOS
NEEDS TO BE TALKED TO.

JUST AS PRECAUTIONARY
MEASURES BUT THEY ARE ON
HIGHER GUARD.

IN THE LAST HOUR, PRESIDENT
OBAMA SAID THE COUNTRY WILL
FIND OUT WHO DID THIS.

I HAD JUST SEEN THEM.

BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
CLEARLY WILL NOT BE TAKEN
CARE OF TONIGHT SHEPARD.

AS I SAY A TOTAL, WE ARE
TOLD, OF SOMETHING LIKE 105
PEOPLE TAKEN TO THE LOCAL
HOSPITALS AS A RESULT OF
THIS WHICH JUST SHOWS YOU
THE FORCE OF THOSE
EXPLOSIONS AND WHATEVER
SHRAPNEL THEY WERE PACKED
WITH RIPPING THROUGH
EVERYBODY WHO WAS CROWDED
IN THAT AREA AT THAT TIME.

ONE REASON WE KNOW ABOUT
THE BOSTON MARATHON IS
THERE WILL BE CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE.

WE HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY
THAT THE ENTIRE NATION IS
PRAYING TONIGHT FOR BOSTON.
