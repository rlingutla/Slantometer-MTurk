TWO REPUBLICANS SAY
THEY WOULD BACK A BUMP
STOCK BAN.

THERE SHOULD NOT BE
ANY RESTRICTIONS
WHATSOEVER ON GUN
RIGHTS.

AND HE PICKED ME UP.

PHIPPEN, WAS AT THE
CONCERT WITH HIS
FATHER JOHN.

IT'S PROBABLY ONE
OF THE HARDEST
DECISIONS I'VE EVER
MADE, BUT SHE KNEW I
HAD TO GO.

SO FAR THE FBI SAYS NO
IDEA OF WHAT DROVE HIM
TO COMMIT MASS MURDER.

BOTH JUMPED INTO
ACTION.

MUCH MORE FROM LAS
VEGAS AS WE CONTINUE
IN A MOMENT.

IF THIS IS IT, HAD TO
SAY GOOD-BYE.

IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
BUMP STOCKS.

THIS TRIP IS
DIFFERENT.

FINALLY, WE CAN
NEVER SAY ENOUGH ABOUT
THE BRAVE FIRST
RESPONDERS WHO RISKED
THEIR LIVES TO SAVE
OTHERS IN THE TRAGEDY
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

IT'S ABOUT ULTIMATELY
GETTING RID OF THE
SECOND AMENDMENT.

I'M STILL MARRIED
TODAY AND MY KIDS HAVE
THEIR MOM AND STEP-MOM
AND BECAUSE OF ONE
HEROIC PERSON.

NORTH OF THE
MANDALAY BAY, IT'S
COMING OUT OF A
PANIC WERE EVERYWHERE.

DO WE WANT TO TIE
DOWN EVERYBODY'S
FREEDOM BECAUSE WE
HAVE A NUT AND PIECE
OF GARBAGE LIKE THIS
THING?

DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S
DAUGHTER WAS ALMOST
ONE OF THEM.

WE KNOW THAT YOUR
SORROW FEELS ENDLESS.

AND TONIGHT, AS THE
PRESIDENT AND FIRST
LADY VISITED WITH
SURVIVORS AND FIRST
RESPONDERS HERE, WE'RE
GETTING A TERRIFYING
NEW GLIMPSE OF THAT
NIGHT THROUGH THE EYES
OF POLICE RESPONDING
TO THE SHOTS.

INVESTIGATORS WANT TO
KNOW IF SHE HAD ANY
HINT THAT STEPHEN
PADDOCK WAS PLANNING A
VIOLENT ATTACK OR IF
SHE KNEW OF ANY REASON
WHY HE WOULD COMMIT
SUCH A HORRIBLE CRIME.
