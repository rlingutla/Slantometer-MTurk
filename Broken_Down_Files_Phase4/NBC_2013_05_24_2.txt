WHAT DID THE KIDS DO?

ARE FRESH DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING
NOW ABOUT ALL OF THIS, WHETHER
THEY SHOULD BUILD SHELTERS IN
EVERY SCHOOL IN OKLAHOMA.

ONLY ONLY MINOR HEAD INJURIES.

NOT FOR SHELTERS.

GO!

WHAT'S IT LIKE TO BE IN A
TORNADO, GRAYSON?

A CAR WAS THERE ON TOP OF ALL
OF THIS DEBRIS.

IT'S A MIRACLE.

TWO MORE CHILDREN WERE LAID TO
TOWERS ELEMENTARY.

I HAD WEIGHT ON HER.

JANNA SPOKE TO THE TEACHERS WHO
SAVED HER BOYS.

IT'S BROKEN.

GRAYSON.

A YOUNG MOTHER WE TOLD YOU ABOUT
ON TUESDAY HAS REACHED OUT TO
THANK THE DAY CARE WORKERS WHOSE
ACTIONS SAVED THE LIVES OF HER
CHILDREN.

FIRST IT'S JUST A RATTLING
LIKE SOMEONE WALKING ON THE
ROOF.

IT'S A SUBJECT THAT MAY WELL
COME UP ON SUNDAY WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA VISITS HERE.

AFTER A WEEK OF SO MUCH
SADNESS, SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY
ABOUT.

JUST DAYS AFTER WE LAST SAW HIM,
HIS CUTS ARE HEALING.

WHAT DID THE TEACHERS DO?

WE'LL GET IT FIXED.
