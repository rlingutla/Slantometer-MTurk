I'M ALL FOR THAT.

WITH THAT SAID,
REPRESENTATIVE KING IS
CORRECT, HE HAD NO RIGHT TO
UNILATERALLY ON HIS OWN
WITHOUT CHECKING OR ANYBODY
WITHIN HIS CHAIN OF COMMAND
TO GO PUBLIC ON THIS.

I WOULD SAY, THEY ARE
TOTALLY MISGUIDED.

IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO POKE
SOMEONE IN THE EYE WITHOUT
ANY INTEREST TO FIX WHAT
AND THE JOURNALIST FROM THE
GUARDIAN WHO BROUGHT THIS
INFORMATION TO THE WORLD
CLAIM TO HAVE MORE, IF
THERE ARE OTHER AMERICANS
IN EDWARD NODEN'S SHOES AND
THEY HAVE INFORMATION TO
GET OUT THERE, WHAT WOULD
YOU TELL THEM AT THIS
POINT?

WHEN YOU AND I WERE GETTING
THIS ISSUE EARLIER THE NEWS
HADN'T BROKEN.

WHAT WOULD BE A DEFENSE
WOULD BE IF HIS LAWYERS CAN
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE
GOVERNMENT'S BEHAVIOR WAS
SO WIDE OFF THE MARK OF
AMERICAN VALUES AND SO
CONTRARY TO THE
CONSTITUTION THAT HE TOOK
AN OATH TO UPHOLD AND
BARACK OBAMA TOOK A VOTE TO
UPHOLD AND CLAPPER TOOK THE
OATH TO UPHOLD THAT HE
SHOULD BE ORDERED
PROTECTION AS WHISTLEBLOWER.

ABSOLUTELY.

WE NEVER LEFT BRIEFING ON A
NETWORK OR BECAUSE OF THIS
POTENTIAL HAPPENING.

HE ADDRESSES THE LIKELIHOOD
HE WILL BE EXTRADITED OR
HANDED OVER FOR TRIAL AT
SOME POINT.

WHEN CONTACT BY FOX
NEWS, THERE IS NO COMMENT
BY THE C.I.A.

INTELLIGENCE, ADDING THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS

ARMY BUT WAS DISCHARGED
