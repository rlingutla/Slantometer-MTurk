IT IS STEAMING TOWARD THE KOREAN
PENINSULA TO SEND A STRONG
MESSAGE.

WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE?

OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND
FLEXIBILITY AS A PRESIDENT THAT
HE OR SHE SEE SOMETHING AS A
THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
TOWARD TROOPS AND INTEREST THEY
HAVE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO
ASK.

APPARENTLY ADD A GREATER PACE
THAN BEFORE, WITH NOBODY TO STOP
THEM.

I'LL TALK WITH ONE LAW MAKER WHO
BACKS THE PRESIDENT ON SYRIA,
BUT SAID HOW HE JUSTIFIED IT
LEGALLY WAS FLAWED.

SECONDLY WE DON'T SEE A PEACEFUL
SYRIA WITH ASSAD IN DPLSM THEREE
MOVE TOWARD A POLITICAL
SOLUTION, AT END OF THE DAY THIS
IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION.

THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER
BIPARTISAN AND SAY WHAT WERE
GOING TO DO.

HE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS
HE SAW.

IT KEEPS THINGS FROM VEERING UP
AND BECOMING OTHER THINGS.

REPORTER SHE WAS MICHAEL BLIN'S
FLYNN'S DEPUTY, AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO NOMINATE
HER TO AMBASSADOR OF SINGAPORE,
THAT WOULD BE A PROPORTION FOR
HER, SHE JOINS STEVE BANNON AS
SECOND OFFICIAL TO LEAVE
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISE
COUNCIL.

HE HAS SERIOUS BUSINESS TO GET
DOWN TO.

I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYRIA, IT'S
A POWDER CAKE, ANYTHING THAT I'M
AWARE OF SINCE WORLD WAR II YOU
HAVE TURKEY, US, ISRAEL, RUSSIA,
OTHERS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION
ON FORM POLICY.

WHEN YOU HAVE DIPLOMACY THAT THE
WORLD AGREES WITH YOU HAVE TO
BACK IT UP WITH FORCE.

SCREEN LEFT, THE AIRSTRIKE ON
THE SYRIAN AIRBASE IN RESPONSE
TO THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.

WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT
THIS HOUR.

WITH THAT BEING SAID, CONGRESS
DECLARES WAR OR CREATE STATUTORY
LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR USE OF
FORCE.

YOU HEARD THAT FATHER IN SYRIA
WHO LOST HIS TWINS, AMERICA DO
MORE THAN ONE STRIKE.

YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS
DONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT
PART OF DOMESTIC POLICY.

THAT THE NEXT ONE QUESTION.
