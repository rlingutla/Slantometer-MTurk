CARNAGE.

THIS VIDEO IS FROM ONE SUCH
SITE.

JONATHAN, HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE
STILL LISTED AS CRITICAL?

HE WAS A 64-YEAR-OLD FORMER
ACCOUNTANT.

THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND 17
WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES.

IN JUST A MOMENT, WE'LL RETURN
TO TRACE GALLAGHER WHO IS IN
LAS VEGAS.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THE SHOOTER
BROUGHT TEN SUITCASES FILLED
WITH GUNS INTO THE HOTEL ROOM.

INVESTIGATORS HAVE DISCOVERED
THAT PADDOCK SENT TENS OF
THOUSANDS OVERSEAS AND MAY HAVE
BEEN TO THE GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU
DANLEY.

AGAIN, THE HEADLINE FROM THIS
HOUR, WE NOW HAVE REPORTS FROM
THE DAILY MAIL THE UNITED
KINGDOM THAT THE GUNMAN BROUGHT
ALONG WITH ALL THE WEAPONS TO
CREATE HIS CARNAGE, CAMERAS TO
RECORD IT SET UP AT THE WINDOW
WHERE HE WAS SHOOTING AT LEAST
ONE OF THEM AND IN A HALL SO HE
WOULD KNOW WHEN POLICE WERE
COMING.

CATHERINE HERRIDGE HAS THAT LIVE
IN WASHINGTON.

ONE OF THE GUNMAN'S BULLETS HIT
TRAVIS WHO IS EXPECTED TO
SURVIVE.

I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE SURGEONS
WHO HAS BEEN WORKING DAY AND
NIGHT HERE.

NEW DETAILS ON THE SUSPECT AND
THE VICTIMS STRAIGHTAWAY ON FOX
NEWS CHANNEL.

WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
PEOPLE THAT RISKED THEIR LIVES
TO SAVE OTHERS.

THIS MURDERER SENT OVERSEAS
PRIOR TO THE MASSACRE?

SOME OF THESE CARS TRIED TO GET
OUT WHEN THE SHOOTING STARTED
AND RAN INTO A DEAD END.

WE'RE TOLD IT WILL TAKE A DAY OR
TWO TO PROCESS HIS RECORD.

SHEP, THERE'S A COUPLE OF
CRIME SCENES AS YOU KNOW.

AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED
THAT REPORT.

A BILL IN CONGRESS THAT APPEARS
TO HAVE BEEN SHELVED FOR NOW
THAT MAKES SILENCERS ILLEGAL.
