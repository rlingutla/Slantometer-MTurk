HAD NOT BUILT ANY COMMUNITY
TORNADO SHELTERS BECAUSE THE
TOWN SAID IT FACED ONLY A 1% TO
2% CHANCE OF A TORNADO EVER
HITTING ON ANY SPRING DAY.

NEED.

SO WE MADE IT TO THE CORNER OF
THE STORM SHELTER BECAUSE WE

LEAVE.

IT WAS LOUD.

HE RODE OUT THE ASSAULT IN A
NEIGHBOR'S STORM SHELTER.

MM-HMM.

MR. MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR MAKING

BRAVERY OF THE TEACHERS AND,
SECOND, THIS ISSUE OF WHY THERE
WASN'T A SHELTER THERE.
