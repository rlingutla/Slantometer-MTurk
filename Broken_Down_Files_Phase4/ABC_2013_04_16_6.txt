JUST A DELIGHTFUL YOUNG BOY.

I SAW AT THE FLASH, THE FIRE,
THE SMOKE, AND I RAN AS FAST AS
I COULD.

AN 8-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS KILLED IN
THE BOMB BLAST YESTERDAY.

LARGE PIECES OF METAL, AS SEEN
HERE IN THE AIR, SUGGEST THE
BOMBS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCEALED
IN OR UNDER A MAILBOX OR TRASH
BARREL, AS ONE WITNESS
DESCRIBED.

YOU MESS WITH ONE OF US, YOU
MESS WITH ALL OF US.

POLICE HAVE SET UP A MASSIVE
CRIME SCENE.

YOU CAN MOVE IN THERE, YOU SEE
IT RIGHT THERE.

ON A NORMAL TUESDAY AFTERNOON,
THIS PART OF TOWN WOULD BE
CRAWLING WITH FOOT AND ROAD
TRAFFIC, BUT TODAY IT'S ON
LOCKDOWN.

THAT'S CORRECT.

THAT'S RIGHT.

OUT, IT WILL BE NO SURPRISE TO
COUNTERTERRORISM OFFICIALS WHO
HAVE WARNED ABOUT THEIR POSSIBLE
USE WITH READILY AVAILABLE
COMPONENTS FOR YEARS.

ALL AROUND THE WORLD TODAY
PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS WERE
SENDING MESSAGES OF SOLIDARITY
TO BOSTON.

SPEAKING OF PICTURES, I WANT
TO ASK YOU ABOUT A PHOTO THAT
EVERYBODY WAS E-MAILING TODAY.

IS CLASSIC IED DESIGN, THE KILL
ZONE FROM THE BLAST, ONE TO TWO
YARDS.

N AND AMID THE GRIEF OF THOSE
WHO WERE LOST, THERE WERE SO
MANY PEOPLE WHO INSPIRED US.

TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SIZE
OF THIS THING, TAKE A LOOKA THE
MAP.

FACE OF NICOLE GROSS, ONE OF
THREE MEMBERS OF THE SAME FAMILY
INJURED.

AS PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE CLEAR
TODAY, THERE'S STILL NO EVIDENCE
OF WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS
ACT OF TERRORISM.

PILLARS OF THE COMMUNITY.

AND TOPPLE ANOTHER MAN ON HIS
COUCH FROM THE THIRD FLOOR OF
THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR, 20 YARDS
AWAY.
