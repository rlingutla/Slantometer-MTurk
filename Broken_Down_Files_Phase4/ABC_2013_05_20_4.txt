MORE FACES FROM THE STORM.

A SCHOOL SUFFERS A DIRECT HIT.

THIS STORM HAS BEEN COVERED WITH
STORM CHASERS AND LOCAL
TELEVISION FROM START TO FINISH.

AND ONE A FATHER, HIS SON
GABRIEL WAS IN SCHOOL, RODE OUT
THE STORM INSIDE ONE OF THE
SCHOOLS THAT TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

FIRES BREAKING OUT.

12 IN SERIOUS.

AGAIN, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR PHONING INTO US.

VERY LARGE AREA OF HOMES, VERY
LARGE RESIDENTIAL AREA, WITH
LOTS OF HOMES.

WE'RE JUST GLAD THAT HE'S SAFE.

THIS IS GABRIEL AND RYAN
WHEELER.

HEARING THE STORM GOING OVER MY
HOUSE, WHICH ROARING, WHIRLING
SOUND, IT WAS SO LOUD.

JUST SAW A POWER FLASH IN THE
SKY.

GIVE ME A SENSE, HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU HAVE PER MINUTE
STILL COMING IN?

HOW MUCH ARE YOU EQUIPPED TO
RECEIVE?

AS NEIGHBORS DIG THROUGH
DEBRIS BY HAND TO TRY TO HELP
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

OUR DOGS WERE DOWN ON THE GROUND
JUST SHAKING, BLESS THEIR
HEARTS.

IT'S TURNING INTO A
DESTRUCTIVE TORNADO AND IT'S
GETTING BIGGER.

AND INITIALLY, WE SAW ALL
THOSE FIRES BURNING, HAVE THEY
GONE OUT?

THERE WERE 20 OR 30 MINUTES FOR
EVERYONE TO GET TO SOME KIND OF
SHELTER.

WE'RE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM
JUST MINOR LACERATIONS TO SEVERE
HEAD INJURIES AND ABDOMINAL
WOUNDS.
