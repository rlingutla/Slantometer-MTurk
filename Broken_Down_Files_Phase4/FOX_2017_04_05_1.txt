CLEARLY HE HAS.

HE SAID WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE
FIGHTING IN SYRIA?

HE WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY AND
CAREFULLY NOT SO.

OF COURSE, FOR MANY REPUBLICANS,
IT WAS PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
POLICIES THAT WERE CAUSING THE
PROBLEMS PREVIOUSLY.

HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMAGES OF
LITTLE CHILDREN, LITTLE BABIES
DYING AND SUFFERING HORRIBLY IN
THE WAKE OF IN GAS ATTACK.

IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
ME.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT IN FROM THE
30,000 FOOT LEVEL, IT'S CLEAR
WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE LAST HOUR
AT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL HAVE A
PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYTHING
GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

WE DON'T FLOW WHO THEY ARE.

I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS
THE EDUCATION OF AN AMERICAN
PRESIDENT.

WE'VE HEARD SEAN SPICER SAY THAT
THIS WEEK.

PRESIDENTS BEFORE HIM.

GOING TO TRY TO
STRIKE ASSAD TO DEAL WITH HIS
ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THE
ATTACKS.

YESTERDAY THE ATTACK WAS
LAUNCHED KILLING DOZENS OF
PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN ASLEEP
IN THEIR BEDS.

THE PRESIDENT SAID THE LATEST
ACTS OF BARBER AL-ASSAD CAN'T BE
TOLERATED.

SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENTER
THIS CONFLICT, SUPPORTING
MILITARILY THE REBELS, FIGHTING
AGAINST THE SYRIANS, WE WOULD BE
FIGHTING THE RUSSIANS AND THE
IRANIANS.

HE'S BEEN STUDIOUSLY
NONSPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT ACTION HE
WILL TAKE ACROSS THE WORLD.

WE HAVE ATTEMPTED THAT FOR SIX
YEARS.

BUT IT'S A HORRIFIC VIDEO THAT
THE PRESIDENT SAID CHANGED HIS
MINDS AND THE NATION'S POLICY
TOWARDS THIS CONFLICT.

I APPRECIATE IT.

WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD SAY,
I WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFE
HAVENS THAT HE'S TALKED ABOUT.
