WE HAVE TO THINK THROUGH
STRATEGICALLY WHAT'S GOING
TO BE IN OUR LONG-TERM
NATIONAL INTEREST EVEN AS
WE WORK COOPERATIVELY
INTERNATIONALLY TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PUT
PRESSURE ON THOSE WHO WOULD
KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

STOPPED SHORT OF SAYING HE
WOULD USE MILITARY ACTION
LEADING TO CONSERVATIVES TO
CHARGE THAT HE IS DODDLING.

FROM THAT HOTEL TO THE SITE
OF THE ATTACK JON.

WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE
CONTINUES TO HEDGE ITS
RESPONSE.

ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE
THE PRESIDENT FACING A
CREDIBILITY TEST.

NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN
CROSSED SEVERAL TIMES AND
POSSIBLY YET AGAIN THIS
WEEK WITH A MASSIVE
CHEMICAL ATTACK THAT KILLED
UP TO 1800 PEOPLE.

BUT DELAY CAN BE DEADLY,
RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT.

THE ONLY POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION OF WHAT WE HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO SEE IS THAT IT
WAS A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

AND THE NOTION THAT THE
U.S. CAN SOMEHOW SOLVE WHAT
IS A SECTARIAN, COMPLEXED
PROBLEM INSIDE OF SYRIA
SOMETIMES IS OVERSTATED.

BUT HE ALSO EXPLAINED WHY
IT COULD HURT US BIG TIME
IF THE U.S. GETS TOO
INVOLVED.

U.N. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCING
TODAY THAT OF THE 2 MILLION
REFUGEES THAT HAVE FLED THE
FIGHTING IN SYRIA,
1 MILLION ARE CHILDREN.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

THE POLICY IS FOCUSED
AROUND NOT GETTING INVOLVED
SO FAR 100,000 DEAD MOSTLY
KILLED BY BULLETS OR
WHISTLES.

THERE IS NO OTHER PLAUSIBLE
EXPLANATION FOR CASUALTIES,
SO INTENSE AND SUCH A SMALL
AS THE FRENCH DID YESTERDAY
IN THE POSSIBILITY OF USING
FORCE.

1 MILLION CHILDREN NOW
WITHOUT HERMINE, CHILDREN
LIKE THESE LISTEN.

WE USED TO RIDE A BICYCLE
TOGETHER AND PLAY WITH
TOYS.

IS HE UNDER PRESSURE TO ACT
IN THAT CNN INTERVIEW THAT
YOU REFERRED TO THE
PRESIDENT LASHED OUT AT
SYRIA OVER THIS ALLEGED
ATTACK, SAID HE IS STILL  EVIDENCE
TO
COME IN.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
INTERESTINGLY DENYING THAT
A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
TOOK PLACE BUT SAYING AS
THEIR RUSSIAN ALLIES HAVE
ALSO IMPLIED THAT THE
ATTACK WAS CARRIED OUT BY
THE REBELS TO GAIN SYMPATHY
AND PRO-VEHICLE
INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION
THERE ARE FEW WHO BELIEVE
THAT CLAIM.

SOME OF THE ESTIMATES ARE
WELL OVER A THOUSAND.

THIS BUS TOUR WAS SUPPOSED
TO BEEN ALL ABOUT DOMESTIC
ISSUES.
