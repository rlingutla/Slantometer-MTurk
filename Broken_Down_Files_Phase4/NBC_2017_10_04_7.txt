THEY KNEW WHAT THEY
WERE DOING, BUT IT'S
ALSO NOT JUST A FLY BY
THE SEAT OF YOUR PANTS
TYPE OF RISK.

HE WAS COVERING
THIS GIRL, AND HE GOT
SHOT.

THERE IS
RECEPTIVENESS THAT I
THINK IS VERY, VERY
SIGNIFICANT.

THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
CONNECTION, IF ANY,
SHE HAD TO THE ATTACK,
BUT THEYANT TO KNOW
WHO SHE WAS SO THEY
CAN TALK TO HER.

IF HE DIDN'T GET ME
HERE, I WOULD HAVE
DIED.

A THANKFULLY TEMPORARY
REMINDER OF THE 11
MINUTES OF
COLD-BLOODED VIOLENCE
HERE JUST THREE NIGHTS
AGO.

NOW ANOTHER MAN WITH A
MISSION TO SAVE
CARRIED THE MOTHER OF
FOUR AWAY FROM HARM.

THEY'RE FOCUSED ON
THE PATIENTS AND
THEY'RE ALSO FOCUSED
ON MAKING SURE THAT
THEY SAVE AS MANY
PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE.

CALL HOME WAS
INTERRUPTED BY A GOOD
SAMARITAN.

HARROWING NEW VIDEO
FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS
OF CHAOS AND CARNAGE.

OFFICERS RUNNING
TOWARD THE DANGER.

AND HE WRAPPED HIS
ARMS AROUND MY BACK.

LATE TODAY HER LAWYER
READ A STATEMENT FROM
HER.

LET'S GO.

I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

JUST GO!

LEADERS SAY THEY WANT
TO LEARN MORE, BUT NO
HEARING'S BEEN
SCHEDULED YET.

HIS NAME'S SHAUN.

DURING THE GUNFIRE
FROM THIS HOTEL ROOM,
POLICE SAY MANY OF
THEIR OFFICERS WERE
WEARING BODY CAMERAS,
ADDING MUCH OF THE
VIDEO IS STILL BEING
REVIEWED.

I STARTED CRAWLING
TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO
WERE WOUNDED.
