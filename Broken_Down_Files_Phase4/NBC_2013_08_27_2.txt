ISRAEL SAYS IT'S READY FOR
ANYTHING.

A WAR THAT KILLS BABIES
SILENTLY, SUDDENLY, BATHING THEM
NOT IN BLOOD, BUT IN THE TEARS
OF A DOCTOR.

THEY'RE IN MY PRAYERS.

MINISTER DAVID CAMERON CUT SHORT
HIS HOLIDAY TO CALL A SPECIAL
SESSION OF PARLIAMENT THURSDAY.

IN TEXAS TODAY, SPEAKING TO
VETERANS, THE VICE PRESIDENT
CONTINUED THE DRUM BEAT TO
PUNISH BASHAR AL ASSAD.

HE VALUES HIS MILITARY
COMMAND AND CONTROL NODES, HIS
COMMUNICATIONS NODES, HIS
MILITARY AIR FIELD.

IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, HE'S
LOST MORE THAN 20% OF HIS BODY
WEIGHT, CAN NO LONGER STAND, AND
WON'T EAT.

BUT SHE SAYS LOCAL CLINICS
TURNED HER AWAY.

HIS NAME IS IBRAHIM.

THEY SAY THEY'LL REFER HIM TO A
SPECIALIST WHO MIGHT ONE DAY
HELP HIM WALK AGAIN.

WE SHOULDN'T BE GETTING INTO A
MIDDLE EASTERN CONFLICT RIGHT
NOW.

I THINK THERE IS A VERY GOOD
CHANCE TO FALL THE ASSAD REGIME.

I THINK WE'RE INVOLVED IN
ENOUGH STUFF OVERSEAS, YOU KNOW?

TODAY, THAT'S ENOUGH TO GIVE A
WORRIED MOTHER AND HER SON HOPE
FAR FROM HOME.

WHEN THE ORDER COMES, THE
PENTAGON HAS FOUR DESTROYERS,
SUBMARINES, PLUS THE NATO BASE
IN TURKEY.

OUR FINAL STORY TONIGHT IS
ABOUT A SMALL BUT EXTRAORDINARY
RAY OF HOPE IN A PLACE WHERE
THERE'S FAR TOO LITTLE HOPE.

I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN LET THAT
STAND.

HOPING TO PREVENT MORE DEATHS
FROM DEVASTATING WEAPONS NOT
SEEN IN DECADES.

NBC'S ANN CURRY HAS THE STORY OF
ONE YOUNG BOY IN DESPERATE NEED
OF MEDICAL ATTENTION, AND A
DOCTOR WHO'S MAKING A DIFFERENCE
TO HELP HIM.

AGAINST ANY INVOLVEMENT.
