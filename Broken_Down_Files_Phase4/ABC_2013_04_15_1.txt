THEY RESPONDED WITHIN 15
SECONDS.

ROLLING FROM MANY ANGLES AS THE
FORCE OF THE BLAST ACTUALLY
KNOCKS OVER AT LEAST ONE OF THE
MARATHONERS.

WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING
ON, DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
WERE INJURED.

AND DOMESTIC FRUSTRATES PROVED
DEADLY AS WELL.

WE THANK YOU FOR PHONING IN TO
US TONIGHT, THANK YOU.

AND THE BOSTON ATHLETIC
ASSOCIATION HAD SO MANY PEOPLE
THERE TO HELP, IT WAS FANTASTIC.

AS PAINFUL AS IT IS TODAY, YOU
CAN'T LET THEM SUCCEED, BUT US
CHANGING THE NORM, CHANGING HOW
WE LIVE.

ANOTHER EXPLOSION WENT OFF
APPARENTLY DOWN THE BLOCK.

MANGLED LIMBS, PEOPLE NOT
BREATHING.

A BOMB WENT OFF AND IT
KNOCKED ME TO THE GROUND.

SMOKE, AND I RAN FAST AS I
COULD.

BUT PEOPLE JUST WERE VERY CALM.

YOU SAW EVERYBODY COMING DOWN
HERE.

DR. PAINTER, TELL US ABOUT THE
SCENE AND AS A MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE THE
SECURITY PERIMETER WAS PUSHED
OUT.

AGAIN, SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE
ASKING THAT EVERYONE WHO HAD ANY
VIDEO AT ALL, SEND IT TO THEM
AND SEND THEM ANY LEADS.

WE'RE GOING TO SLOW IT DOWN.

WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU AGAIN
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND AGAIN
OUR THANKS TO WCVB IN BOSTON.

THEN I REALIZED THERE WERE
PEOPLE BLEEDING BEHIND ME.

ANKLES AND FEET MISSING,
SHRAPNEL WOUNDS ON THE SIDE OF
THE HEAD.
