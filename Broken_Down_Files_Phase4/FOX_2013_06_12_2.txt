THE SENATORS DID NOT OBJECT
TO MONITORING SPECIFIC
TERRORIST SUSPECTS.

ACCUSED THE UNITED STATES
OF TARGETING COMPUTERS ALL
OVER THE WORLD?

GENERAL KEITH ALEXANDER
SAYS GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS HAVE
HELPED PREVENT DOZENS OF
TERROR ATTACKS.

MEASLY 71% SAY WE ARE
CONFIDENT AND PROUD.

THAT IS PUTTING NEW
PRESSURE TONIGHT ON ERIC

REPORTS IT CONTACTED THE
U.S. CONSULATE IN HONG KONG
FOR A RESPONSE TO ED

SOON AS THE UNITED STATES
WANTS HIM THEY WILL GET
HIM.

HE WAS CENTER HE OF THE
TALKING POINTS CONTROVERSY.

HE SAYS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
HAS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WHAT
THESE CONTROVERSIES ADD UP
TO FOR THE PRESIDENT RIGHT

ALREADY DISTRUSTFUL OF THE
GOVERNMENT MAYBE MORE SO
NOW BECAUSE OF THESE
CONTROVERSIES AND A
PRESIDENT TRYING TO GET THE
NATION'S ATTENTION ON

BUDGET DEAL, OTHER THINGS
BEYOND THESE CONTROVERSIES,
BIT OF POLLING, THE POLLS
SHOW THE MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS ARE NOT YET
SATISFIED WITH THE A SENSE
THEY HAVE HEARD REGARDING
THREE MAJOR CONTROVERSIES.

LOTS TO COVER ON THIS.
