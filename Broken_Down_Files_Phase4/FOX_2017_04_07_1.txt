OTHERWISE, IT'S FREE GAME FOR
HIM WHAT HE WILL LIKELY DO IS
KEEP FIGHTING THE WAR WITHOUT
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

JENNIFER GRIFFIN HAS MORE.

I THINK THAT IS CLEAR.

THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
UNFOLDED OVER THE COURSE OF 24
HOURS AT FOUR MEETINGS WITH THE
PRESIDENT AT 1000 ON TUESDAY
MORNING CULMINATING WITH THE
MEETING HERE AT MAR-A-LARGO ON
THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN WHICH THE
PRESIDENT MADE THE DECISION TO
GO AHEAD AND DO IT AT 400 P.M.

VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID THAT THE
PRESIDENT ORDERED THE STRIKES
UNDER A FAR-FETCHED PRETEXT.

THERE'S NO REASON FOR HIM THERE
TO WANT TO RUN THE RISK OF
PICKING A FIGHT WITH A SUPER
POWER.

ABOUT THE TIMING ON WHEN THE
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO TAKE THE
STRIKE?

BUT NOW HE LAUNCHED ATTACK HE
DID LAST NIGHT.

SO MY EXPECTATION IS HE WILL SEE
IF HE CAN RIDE OUT YESTERDAY'S
STRIKE AND HAVE THAT BE THE END
OF IT.

A LOT GOING ON AT THE U.N.
 WELL, A LOT IS GOING ON WITH
THE TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY.

IS THE VETTING IN PLACE, A
TWO-YEAR VETTING PROCESS FOR
REFUGEES, WAS THAT NOT STRONG
ENOUGH IN YOUR MIND FOR THE
COUNTRIES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
DESIGNATED?

IF IT'S JUST A RETALIATION,
IF IT'S JUST A MESSAGE WITH
NOTHING ELSE BEHIND IT, THEN I
WILL SAY NO.

I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THERE WERE
MANY AIRCRAFT DAMAGED.

BACK TO AL-ASSAD.

IT HURTS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO
WOULD HELP US WITH INTELLIGENCE
ON THE GROUND FROM GIVING US
THAT INTELLIGENCE.

A RESPONSE HE SAYS TO THIS
WEEK'S DEADLY GAS ATTACK IN
SYRIA THAT KILLED DOZENS,
INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S ROADS
THAT LEAD TO THEM FOR STORING
AMMO IN ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
PLACES.

THEY DO NOT WANT TO HAVE
CONFRONTATION OR CONFLICT WITH
THE UNITED STATES.

LIMIT OF OUR RESPONSE BE IN THE
SYRIAN WAR?

THE REST OF THE WORLD
UNDERSTANDS THAT WE TOOK
JUSTIFIABLE ACTION BASED ON THE
TRAGIC ACTIONS THAT THE ASSAD
REGIME TOOK.
