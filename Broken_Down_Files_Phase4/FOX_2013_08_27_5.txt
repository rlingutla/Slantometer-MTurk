PRESIDENT OBAMA IS STILL
DECIDING WHAT THAT RESPONSE
WILL BE.

THAT MEETING DUE TO TAKE
PLACE THURSDAY.

THE PENTAGON SAYS IT'S
READY TO GO.

BUT, SOME REPUBLICAN
LEADERS ARE WEIGHING IN ON
WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE THAT
SHOULD BE.

SECRETARY HAGEL SAYS IF THE
U.S. MILITARY DOES TAKE
ACTION, WE WILL NOT BE
GOING IT ALONE.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMMERON SAYS IT IS
LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

BUT, SOME LAWMAKERS FROM
BOTH PARTIES CLAIM THAT IS
NOT ENOUGH.

KILLED INNOCENT CHILDREN.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S
CONSULTING WITH CONGRESS
ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO
DAMASCUS.

THE WHITE HOUSE CLAIMS THE
U.S. WILL RESPOND TO THAT
DEADLY CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK IN SYRIA.

LET'S GET THE INTELLIGENCE.

MULTIPLE PENTAGON SOURCES
SUGGEST THE STRIKE WILL BE
LIMITED.

HAVE USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS
MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE PAST.

OFFICIALS HERE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TELLING ME THAT IS
UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN BEFORE
THE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS
DECISION ON WHETHER TO MOVE
FORWARD ON U.S. MILITARY
ACTION.

THAT HE DID, IN FACT, USE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

OUR FOCUS IS AWAY FROM
ANY MILITARY SOLUTION AND
TOWARDS A DIPLOMATIC
SOLUTION AND WE CONTINUE TO
WORK ON AT ALL AVENUES TO
TRY TO GET A DIPLOMATIC
SOLUTION GOING.

NOW THE WOWS JUST
REVEALED IN THE LAST FEW
MOMENTS AND THE PRESIDENT
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH
THE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
DAVID CAMMERON.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE TO
PRIME MINISTER DAVID
CAMMERON TODAY.

ACCORDING TO U.S. MILITARY
SOURCES, THERE ARE NO PLANS
IN THIS INITIAL MISSION SET
TO GO AFTER ASSAD'S
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
