THE SIGN OF A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION THAT'S TRYING TO
KILL PEOPLE.

AMBULANCES TOOK 19 VICTIMS
TO MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL
HOSPITAL.

THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL, THE
UNTHINKABLE.

IT FELT SO STRONG IT ALMOST BLEW
MY HAT OFF.

YEAH.

FOR A 15-BLOCK AREA PEOPLE
AREN'T ALLOWED.

FINISH LINE READ 409:43 WHEN
THE FIRST EXPLOSION WENT OFF ON
BOYLSTON STREET.

A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WILL
DETERMINE WHETHER IT WAS PLANNED
AND CARRIED OUT BY A TERRORIST
GROUP, FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC.

IT IS RIGHT NOW PRETTY DEAD.

MICHAELLE LEITER WAS THE COUNTER
TERRORISM DIRECTOR UNDER
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH.

IT'S THE LAST THING YOU EXPECT
AT THE FINISH LINE OF THE BOSTON
MARATHON ON PATRIOTS DAY IN
BOSTON.

HOWEVER WE DO NOT KNOW WHO
CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK.

IN FACT, WE ARE TWO BLOCKS FROM
THE FINISH LINE.

OVERSEAS VETERANS OF THE WARS
THE PAST TEN YEARS AND THOSE OF
US WHO SPENT TIME THERE, NUMBER
ONE, THE PRIMARY EXPLOSION, THEN
THE SECONDARY EXPLOSION AS
PEOPLE ARE RUNNING TO THE FIRST.

FROM WHAT YOU CAN TELL ALTHOUGH
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT HERE, MOST
OF THEM HAVE HEEDED THAT ORDER,
AT LEAST AROUND HERE.

YOU CAN REACH YOUR OWN
CONCLUSIONS BASED UPON WHAT
HAPPENED.

WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THE NATION'S NEED TO
SECURE LARGE PUBLIC EVENTS AND
HOW THAT JOB MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
TOUGHER TODAY.

THEY CAN LOOK FOR THE SOFTEST,
LEAST DEFENDED AREA.

THIS IS THE SCENE AS IT
HAPPENED.

WE ARE NOT BEING DEFINITIVE
ON THIS RIGHT NOW.
