SEPARATED BY 1,900 MILES, BUT
CONNECTED BY THIS MAN.

SO AT THAT INSTANT I JUST FELT
LIKE, IT WAS A BOMB.

THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL BE LOOKING
AT AND THEY WILL INTERVIEW
EVERYBODY THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO
SEE WHERE THOSE DARK MONTHS LED.

LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OLDER
BROTHER'S TRIP TO RUSSIA.

FEW WERE WILLING TO TALK.

THE INFRARED CENSORS THAT
ACTUALLY SAW HIM INSIDE THAT
BOAT AND THE ROBOT THAT HELPED
FORCE HIM OUT.

HE STARTED POSTING VIOLENT
VIDEOS, URGING JIHAD.

ALSO TONIGHT, IN A CITY
THAT'S COMING BACK TO LIFE AFTER
AN EXTRAORDINARY DAY ON
LOCKDOWN, THE ONLINE EFFORTS TO
REWARD THE MAN WHO FOUND THE
SUSPECT IN HIS BOAT.

SO WHAT, THEN, ARE THE ODDS OF
ONE MAN BEING AN EYEWITNESS TO
BOTH?

TONIGHT TSARNAEV IS BEING
TREATED IN THE SAME HOSPITAL AS
MANY OF THE BOMBING VICTIMS
THEMSELVES.

THERE WAS A SHOOTOUT IN THE
BEGINNING.

ALL UNITS, DO NOT RETURN
FIRE.

THE HEADLINES SAY THE NIGHTMARE
IN BOSTON IS OVER.

ON HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL.

WE DIDN'T THINK TWICE ABOUT
COMING.

IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF
PEOPLE OF BOSTON, THE PEOPLE OF
NEW ENGLAND, THIS IS A CIVIC
CATHEDRAL.

TO THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN, BOSTON
WAS TRANSFORMED TODAY.

ARE THERE OTHERS WORKING WITH
HIM?

PERHAPS FATE.

THEY'LL DO A POSTMORTEM,
WHICH IS NORMAL IN THESE CASES,
BUT THEY SAID THEY DID WHAT THE
LOU AND THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS.
