THEY ARE GETTING THOUSANDS
OF CALLS RIGHT NOW.

IMKNOWLEDGE NOW RELEASED BY
THE FBI.

WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR THE
STAR SPANGLED STAR-SPANGLED
BANNER TO START.

SOMEONE OUT THERE KNOWS WHO
THEY ARE.

THAT CARRIES THE DEATH
PENALTY AS WELL AS
EXPLODING A WEAPON OF MASS
DESTRUCTION.

AND THE INVESTIGATION AS IT
MOVES FORWARD, YOU WONDER,
CATHERINE, WHY THE FBI WAS
QUIET FOR TWO DAYS.

NUMBER ONE IN THE DARK
JACKET WITH THE DARK HAT
WITH KHAKIS AND A BACKPACK.

IF YOU KNOW THEM OR SEE
THEM, YOU CAN LET THE FEDS
KNOW BY DIALING
1-800-CALL-FBI.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN
IS, THEY NEED TO -- THEY
NEED TO LOOK AT EVERYTHING
THAT IS THERE.

AS THE FBI CONTINUES THEIR
SEARCH FOR THESE TWO MEN.

THE IMAGES OF TWO MEN IN
BASEBALL HATS WALKING DOWN
BOYLSTON STREET WITH
BACKPACKS IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE MARATHON FINISH
LINE.

WHAT WE REPORTED EARLIER
HERE AT FOX IS THAT THE FBI
WAS SCRUBBING OR SCANNING
THE CELL PHONE TOWER
RECORDS LOOKING FOR
POSITIVE HITS AT THE POINT
OF DETONATION.

AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO
THAT.

THIS GUY, BELIEVED TO BE
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 SOMEONE
THE FBI BELIEVES IT MIGHT
BE THIS PERSON PLACED THAT
BACK BACK TOWN NEXT TO THAT
LITTLE BOY WAITING TO SEE
HIS FATHER CROSS THE FINISH
LINE.

RIGHT.

TONIGHT, MIKE, WHAT DO YOU
TAKE FROM THESE LATE
DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE HAVE
BEEN WATCHING HERE IN
BOSTON?

IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE
INVESTIGATION WORKED FROM
THE POINT OF THE EXPLOSION
AND WORKED ITS OUTWARD.

WE CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW
IMPORTANT OTHER IMAGES
MIGHT BE TO THE
INVESTIGATION.

CLEARLY THE FBI AND THE
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE JOINT
TERRORISM TASK FORCE HAVE
SPENT THE BETTER PART OF
THE LAST 48 HOURS TRYING TO
IDENTIFY AND CAPTURE THESE
TWO MEN ON THEIR OWN.

AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE
VIDEOTAPE EVIDENCE OF H
LEAVING THAT BOMB AT THE
SCENE.
