I HOPE PEOPLE ARE BEING
RESPONSIBLE BUT DRIVING AROUND
IT IS HARD.

SO YOU HAVE SEEN THIS
BEFORE.

APPRECIATE IT.

AS IT STAYS LOOKS LIKE WELL
NORTH OF MACK MCARTHUR BOULEVARD
THAT IS.

IT WAS JUST THE HIGH WINDS THE
LARGE SIZED GOLF BALL SIZED
HAIL AND THAT ALONE AND THE
RAIN REALLY DID A NUMBER ON THE
CITY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT A
TORNADO GAME THROUGH.

WE ARE PICKING THAT UP ON THE
RADAR AND SHOWS UP AS BIG HOLES
AND STUFF LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TREE HES OR DEBRIS FLYING
AROUND.

AND, OF COURSE, THE REASON I
ASK THAT AND MANY OF OUR
VIEWERS WILL KNOW BECAUSE WE
COVERED THIS THIS WEEK ON
WEDNESDAY AND I'M SURE YOU KNOW
THIS BE JENNIFER WHEN THE
SYSTEM WAS BEING TALKED ABOUT
WE SAW ANOTHER SYSTEM DROP
TWISTERS OVER GRANBURY TEXAS
THAT WAS HIT SO HARD, SIX
PEOPLE DEAD THERE.

I HAVE NOT.

WE HAD LOTS OF WARNING AND
PREPARATION TO PREPARE
OURSELVES.

WELL OKLAHOMA RIGHT NOW
SOUTH AND EAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY
IS WHERE WE ARE SORT OF
CONCERNED WITH THE WORST OF THE
TORNADOIC CELLS.

AND THEN THERE IS I-40 AND THEN
AGAIN SPLIT SCREENING ACTUALLY
NOW WE ARE ON FULL SCREEN HERE
AND THERE IS THE HIGHWAY SIGN
WILL AND EMERGENCY VEHICLES
THERE.

PEOPLE ARE SPEEDING.

I SAW FROM THE TWITTER ARE PAGE
SOMEVE THAT
IS POSSIBLE.

OKLAHOMA CITY JOPLIN,
KANSAS CITY, A YOU WILL OF THE
INGREDIENTS FAVORABLE FOR
LONGING LASTING LARGE
DESTRUCTIVE TORNADOES.

IN YOUR LINE IS BREAKING UP A
LITTLE BIT.

I WANT TO START WITH THE
FACT THAT YOU ARE THE TYPICAL
PERSON I WOULD CALL AND ASK FOR
INFORMATION IN AN EMERGENCY
SITUATION AS A REPORTER AND YOU
WOULD GIVE ME THE INFORMATION.

WHAT IS FALLING FROM THE SKY
AND DOING ALL OF THE DAMAGE
THAT WE ARE SEEING?

HOW DOES THE DAY COMPARE.

OKLAHOMANS ARE USED TO GET OUT
AND WATCH IT IS COMING
SOMETIMES.

UNFORTUNATELY, A PROLONGED
EVENT FOR THE NEXT 48 EVEN 72
HOURS.
