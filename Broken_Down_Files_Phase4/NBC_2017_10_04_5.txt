MY GUARDIAN ANGEL
SHOWED UP.

AS INVESTIGATORS BUILD
A TIMELINE OF WHAT LED
UP TO THE ATTACK,
THEY'RE TRYING TO
TRACK DOWN A WOMAN WHO
WAS SEEN WITH PADDOCK
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE
SHOOTING.

LAS VEGAS MASS
SHOOTING.

THAT WAY WINDOWS, ONCE
IT'S BROKEN OUT, YOU
OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE'S
CAN BE MORE VIGILANT,
TOO.

OUR JOE FRYER HAS
MORE.

THE NEVADA SHOOTER HAD
12 OF THE DEVICES
WHICH LEGALLY ALLOW A
SEMIAUTOMATIC GUN TO
SHOOT FASTER LIKE AN
AUTOMATIC.

WERE THERE WHEN SHAUN
STOPPED BY.

AND TONIGHT, SOME OF
THE MOST POWERFUL
STORIES OF HEROISM
WE'VE HEARD.

MAKING A STRONG
RECOVERY, THE MOMENTS
OF TERROR HAUNT
SMERBER'S DREAMS, BUT
WHEN SHE AWAKES SHE
HOLDS ON TO ANOTHER
MEMORY, THE MOMENT A
STRANGER PICKED HER UP
AND SAVED HER LIFE.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL SAYS TONIGHT
THAT MARILOU DANLEY'S
BEEN COOPERATIVE AND
THAT THERE'S NO SIGN
SHE HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH STEPHEN PADDOCK'S
MASS SHOOTING.

PLUS, NEW DETAILS
ON THE INVESTIGATION.

I SAID, LET'S GET
DOWN, AND HE SAID, NO,
WE'LL GET TRAMPLED.

GET OUT OF HERE!

AND AS OUR CHIEF WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT
HALLIE JACKSON
REPORTS, SOME
PROMINENT REPUBLICANS
TONIGHT ARE SIGNALING
THAT THEY ARE OPEN TO
TRUMP TODAY ARGUES NOW
IS NOT THE TIME TO
TALK GUN CONTROL.

INSTEAD OF RUNNING,
SHE CALLED HER
HUSBAND.

WE'RE BACK NOW
FROM LAS VEGAS WHERE
TONIGHT RESORTS HAVE
STEPPED UP SECURITY AS
OFFICIALS TRY TO ADD
EXTRA LAYERS OF SAFETY
WHILE TRYING TO FIND
THE RIGHT BALANCE
BETWEEN THE EASE OF
ENJOYING THE HOTELS
AND CASINOS UP AND
DOWN THE STRIP AND THE
NEED TO PROTECT WHAT
COULD BE SEEN AS SOFT
TARGETS.

I REMEMBER JUST
HOLDING HIS HAND
TELLING HIM THAT HE
JUST NEEDED TO FIGHT.

IT'S VERY INTENSE.

SHE WAS SENT AWAY SO
THAT SHE WILL BE NOT
THERE TO INTERFERE
WITH WHAT HE IS
PLANNING.

SO IN MY -- IN MY
HEART AND IN MY
UNDERSTANDING, HE DONE
THIS SOLELY HIMSELF.
