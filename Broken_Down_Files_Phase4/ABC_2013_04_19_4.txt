THIS IS BEYOND ANY DRAMA THAT
CAN BE WRITTEN, PIERRE.

I WAS TALKING TO A YOUNG WOMAN
EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHO HAD A
FRIEND WHO WAS BADLY INJURED IN
THAT BOMBING AND THIS MORNING,
I'M CALLING HER AND TELLING HER,
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE, THE SUSPECT
WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL,
APPARENTLY RIGHT NEAR YOU.

HE IS IN POLICE CUSTODY, DIANE.

WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND?

THEY DID NOT RETURN FIRE.

SO, BASICALLY, A COUPLE OF US
WERE OUTSIDE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
WE HEARD A PRETTY SIZABLE CHEER
DOWN THE ROAD, SO
CLOSE, AND WE WALKED OUT TO THE
FRONT AND WE INTERCEPTED A
POLICE OFFICER AND, YOU KNOW, WE
ASKED IF HE WAS ALIVE OR NOT AND
THEY SAID, HE'S IN CUSTODY, HE'S
ALIVE AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING
TO PROSECUTE HIM AND BRING TIME
THE JUSTICE.

WHEN HE CAME TO SPEAK WITH ME,
HE SAID IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF
MAKING SURE THAT HE IS
INCAPACITATED SO THAT IF HE HAS
A SUICIDE VEST, HE COULD NOT
DETONATE IT AND HARM ANY OF THE
OFFICERS.

AND ONLINE, OK, NOT JUST AMONG
POLICE, NOT JUST AMONG THE
PEOPLE OF BOSTON, BUT ALL ACROSS
THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
HE'S IN CUSTODY, WE NEED
ANSWERS, AND SOMEONE SAID,
"VICTORY, WE ARE STRONG."

NO, I MEAN, I MEAN -- WE ALL
KNOW -- I MEAN, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I DON'T KNOW THAT I KNOW ALL MY
NEIGHBORS LAST NAMES, WE ALL
KNOW EACH OTHER BY FIRST NAME.

THE HELICOPTERS HAVE LEFT.

AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THEN THE
S.W.A.T.

THAT WOULD BE VERY, VERY
IMPORTANT TO STOP HIM, BUT IT'S
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER
HE REPRESENTED SOMETHING THAT
WAS DEEPER AND MORE TROUBLING.

APPARENTLY NOW WE HAVE AUDIO OF
THE POLICE SCANNER AND YOU CAN
HEAR, "WE GOT HIM.

SO, HE HAS CONFIRMED TO ABC NEWS
THAT IT IS SUSPECT NUMBER TWO IN
THE BOAT AND THAT HE WAS
BLEEDING AND THEY PLANNED TO
JUST LET HIM BLEED OUT OR WAIT
UNTIL HE WAS IN THEY WHEN THEY
COULDN'T RESPOND BECAUSE THEY
WEREN'T SURE IF HE HAD A SUICIDE
VEST ON.

AND THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, A
CRITICAL MOMENT WHEN IT BECAME
CLEAR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT
THE SUSPECT WAS, IN FACT, ALIVE.

EVERY OFFICER IN THE UNIVERSE.

IN CUSTODY.

THERE'S NOT A QUESTION NOW.

THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO POKE
HOLES OR THE SUSPECT WAS INSIDE?

AND NOW, REALLY, FOR THE LAST
LITTLE WHILE, NOT MUCH SEEMS TO
BE GOING ON.
