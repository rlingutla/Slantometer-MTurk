A BACKYARD, 67 FRANKLIN
STREET IN WATER TOWN.

WE HEARD POLICE TALKING
ABOUT HE IS IN A BOAT.

AND I GUESS YOU HAVE BEEN
SHELTERING IN PLACE ALL
DAY, RIGHT?

WE ARE TOLD SUSPECT NUMBER
2 MAY BE HOLD UP.

IT'S BEEN A LONG WAIT
OBVIOUSLY FOR A LOT OF
PEOPLE ON N. WASHINGTON.

I CAN'T SEE IT.

SO THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE
THIS VERY CAREFULLY ONE
STEP AT A TIME.

THERE IS AN AMBULANCE RIGHT
NEXT TO ME.

OUTSIDE AND YOU HEARD ALL
OF THIS, RIGHT?

TWO MORE JUST NOW.

AND THEY APPEARED TO HAVE
POSSIBLY HAVE THE SECOND
SUSPECT IN THE BOSTON
MARATHON BOMBING THAT TOOK
PLACE ON MONDAY.

WE DON'T KNOW.

WE WILL TAKE A RIDE TO SEE
IF WE CAN GET CLOSE TO
DECKS E. AVENUE THAT WASN'T
POSSIBLE.

WE DON'T KNOW IF HE IS
INJURED IN THAT BOAT BUT WE
DO KNOW HE IS ALIVE.

THEY STARTED TO TAKE SOME
OF THE CANINE UNITS OUT.

GO TO VIEWER VIDEO COMING
IN AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
THIS -- THIS IS VIEWER
VIDEO FROM THE SCENE.

THE POLICE ARRIVE AND  OUR STANDING
FROM THE
REPORTING OF WFXT
IN BOSTON AND A REPORTER
THERE THAT WHEN POLICE
ARRIVED THERE WAS A BARRAGE
OF GUNFIRE.

AND REALLY THE CITY HAD
BEEN LOCKED DOWN TO A
DEGREE THAT BOSTON HAS
NEVER EXPERIENCED IN ITS
LONG AND STORIC HISTORY.

GUNFIRE LAST NIGHT RESULTED
IN THE DEATH OF ONE OF THE
SUSPECTS.

THE BOAT IS SURROUNDED,
THIS GUY IS INSIDE IT IS HE
BLEEDING?
