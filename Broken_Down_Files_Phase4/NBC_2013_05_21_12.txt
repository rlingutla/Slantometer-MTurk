WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE PROCESS.

SHE WAS BLEEDING BECAUSE SHE GOT
FOUR BODIES WERE RECOVERED TODAY
INCLUDING A 3-MONTH-OLD BABY.

THIS WEATHER IS A SURPRISE TO NO
ONE, AND FOR THE MOST PART
THEY'RE READY FOR IT WHEN IT
COMES.

SHREVEPORT IS CERTAINLY GOING TO
FACE SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS
TONIGHT, AUSTIN, TEXAS, MEMPHIS
TENNESSEE, AS WELL.

SHE TOLD US ALL TO JUST GET
YOUR MATH BOOK OR YOUR BAG.

MEANTIME, TODAY THE FIRST VICTIM
IDENTITIES WERE RELEASED, THAT
OF A LITTLE 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL
KILLED IN HER SCHOOL.

IT'S LIKE A WAR ZONE.

HE GREW UP IN THIS STATE AND WAS
PART OF THE SEARCH AND RESCUE
TEAM 14 YEARS AGO DURING ANOTHER
HUGE TWISTER.

THE TORNADO, DRAMATIC IMAGES,
YOUNG CHILDREN WERE RESCUED, AND
WITH DARKNESS, THE SEARCH FOR
SURVIVORS CONTINUED.

SO WHY WEREN'T SCHOOLS BETTER
PREPARED?

FROM SHELTER INTO AN ALIEN WORLD
OF UTTER DESTRUCTION.

AND SADLY, THAT NUMBER INCLUDES
AT LEAST 9 CHILDREN.

LIVE
THE FEMA ESTIMATE, $1.4 MILLION
PER SCHOOL.

I'LL STAY OUT HERE.

THERE WAS A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
SCREAMING.

WE JUST DON'T DESIGN HOMES ON
THE INTERIOR OF THIS COUNTRY TO
WITHSTAND THE WINDS THE SAME WAY
THEY WOULD DO ALONG THE COAST.

THIS WOMAN IS SAID TO HAVE
SEVERAL YOUNG CHILDREN AT HOME.

QUIT SAYING THAT.

THAT MEANS -- THAT CATEGORY MEAN
THESE WINDS HIT BETWEEN 200, 210
MILES AN HOUR.

PROBABLY AT THE VERY
BEGINNING WHERE IT STARTED RIGHT
BACK OVER HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS.
