WHY DID THEY GO AFTER THEIR NEW
HOMELAND, THE U.S.?

WE WERE ALL TALKING ABOUT
THAT LAST NIGHT, REGARDLESS OF
WHAT HAPPENS TODAY WE'RE GOING
TO COME TO THE GAME ANYWAY.

NOW A RALLYING CRY ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.

CHEERS OF JOY, TO A MOMENT OF
SILENCE.

FEELS LIKE THE FIRST DAY OF MY
LIFE.

IN ASBURY PARK, RUNNERS STARTED
THE DAY WITH BOMB SNIFFING DOGS
AND POLICE PATROLS.

THEY ALSO SAY THEY ARE GETTING
GOOD COOPERATION NOW FROM
RUSSIA, WITH WHOM AS YOU KNOW
THE U.S. HAS HAD VERY ROCKY
RELATIONS OVER THE LAST FEW
YEARS.

I MEAN, IF THEY HAVE ANOTHER YOU
KNOW, PRESSURE COOKER BOMB, THEY
WEREN'T SAVING THAT FOR THE
WATERTOWN POLICE.

THE CITY OF BOSTON MAY BE
RELIEVED, BUT IT IS STILL IN
MOURNING.

IN BOSTON HISTORY.

WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO
THAT'S NECESSARY.

LED BY NEIL DIAMOND.

THE BROTHERS ORIGINALLY FROM
CHECHNYA, WERE RAISED IN THE
U.S., LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE,
AND SEEMED TO FIT IN.

FOR MORE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S
ATTEMPTS TO FIND OUT WHAT
MOTIVATED THESE SUSPECTS,
WE'RE JOINED BY NBC'S CHIEF
FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT,
ANDREA MITCHELL.

RESIDENTS TRAPPED IN THEIR
HOMES, BUT ANXIOUS TO TALK,
COMMUNICATE BY PHONE, TEXT AND
THE INTERNET.

LIKE BO GRIFFIN WHO BROUGHT HIS
FAMILY FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, THE FBI,
A GLOBAL SEARCH FOR WHAT
MOTIVATED TAMERLAN TSARNAEV'S
TERRORISM.

FRAMED THEM.

IN ANOTHER TIME, IT WAS THE
11-MONTH SIEGE OF BOSTON THAT
MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

TONIGHT, THIS CITY HAS EMERGED
FROM ANOTHER SIEGE, SHOWING THE
WORLD IT WON'T BACK DOWN FROM
ANOTHER CHALLENGE IN THIS DAY
AND AGE.
