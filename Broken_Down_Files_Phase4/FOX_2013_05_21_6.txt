HE GOT HIT WITH SOME ROCKS
AND STUFF.

NOT THAT THEY ARE SHOELESS.

THREE HOURS AGO THE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
CONFIRMED WHAT MANY OF US
SUSPECTED THE TORNADO THAT
HIT THIS CITY AND THIS AREA
WAS AN EF-56789 THE TOP
LEVEL POSSIBLE.

IN OKLAHOMA, THESE ARE
COMMON IN THE HOMES.

THEY ARE JUST A LITTLE
SPACE AND YOU HAVE LUGGAGE
IN HERE.

DO WE KNOW?

SO HIS DEPUTY WAS HERE TO
HELP BRIEF THE PRESIDENT
THE HOMELAND SECURITY
SECRETARY JANET NAPOLITANO
IS NOW ON HER WAY AS WELL.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS IS HE
TAKING STEPS TO SPEED
DISASTER RELIEF FROM
WASHINGTON.

259?

AND THIS IS RIGHT ON THE
CORNER NEAR THE BIG MEDICAL
CENTER THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT
YESTERDAY.

SHEP IT'S INTERESTING
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT MADE
COMMENTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
HE HAD A HIGH LEVEL
BRIEFING WITH SOME OF THE
ADVISORS INCLUDING JANET
NAPOLITANO.

IS THE FACT THAT FOR ABOUT
17 OR 18 HOURS IT WAS
BELIEVED AS MANY AS TWO
DOZEN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN
TRAPPED IN PARISH IN
ADDITION TO THE SEVEN YOU
MENTIONED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
IT APPEARS NOW THAT WAS
SIMPLY THE FOG OF CONFUSION
FOLLOWING THE INITIAL
STRIKE OF THE TORNADO.

ED HENRY AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.

COME COMING UP A LIVE
REPORT FROM THE DISASTER
SCENE AND WORD ON THE COST
OF THIS DEVASTATION.

THEY WERE NOT TORNADO
WARNINGS BUT SEVERE
WARNINGS.

I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE
THAT BAD.

WE CANNOT MEASURE OF HUMAN
COST OF THIS TRAGEDY YET.

AND THE PRESIDENT MADE
CLEAR THAT THE FULL FORCE
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WILL BE ON HAND IN OKLAHOMA
TO DEAL WITH THIS TRAGEDY.

BY THE THOUSANDS PART-TIME
HAVE COME HERE.

CASEY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING
THERE WHERE YOU ARE?
