THEY ANNOUNCED A NEW
INITIATIVE CALLED SECURE
OUR SMART PHONES.

IN ORDER TO BEING
SUBJECT TO U.S. PRIVACY
LAWS AND SUBPOENAS BUT ADD
THEY WILL DO THE RIGHT
THING IF PUBLIC SAFETY IS
AT RISK.

ACCORDING TO ONE PRIVACY
EXPERT THESE APPS DO A GOOD
JOB OF PROTECTING PRIVACY,
FORTUNATELY FOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT THEY NORTH
PERFECT.

THEN.

GUY WHO LEAKED EVERYTHING.

WELL AFTER THE NSA
DIRECTOR TESTIFIED THAT
QUOTE.

THAT'S SAFE HOUSE HAD A
TELEPHONE NUMBER BUT THEY
COULD NOT KNOW WHO WAS
CALLING INTO THAT
PARTICULAR SAFE HOUSE.

HE IS HIDING THOUGHT HONG
KONG AN THREATENING TO
REVEAL WHAT HE SAYS ARE
MORE GOVERNMENT SECRETS.

CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY
AGENTS AND INVESTIGATORS
YOU HAVE ASSIGNED TO THE
CASE?

THE FBI DIRECTOR ON THE
SECRET SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM.

THEY SAY THEY WILL PRESSURE
SMART PHONE COMPANIES TO
END THE SECONDARY MARKET IN
STOLEN PHONES AND TO SEEK
THE INDUSTRY WIDE
INTRODUCTION OF A KILL
SWITCH THAT WOULD RENDER
STOLEN PHONES WORTHLESS FOR
GOOD.

SURVEILLANCE, SECURITY, AND
A WHOLE LOT OF SECRETS.

SO SOME LEADING LAWMAKERS
WERE LOOKING FOR SOME
ANSWERS FROM THE FBI
DIRECTOR.

SOME OF THE COMPANIES SAY
THEY ARE BASED OUTSIDE THE
U.S.

SOME OF THESE PRIVACY
APPS DO MORE THAN ENCRYPT
PHONE CALLS.

HE IS THE SUBJECT OF AN
ONGOING CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION.

AND THEY CAN USE THAT
ABILITY RIGHT NOW TO
EAVESDROP ON PEOPLE EVEN IF
THEY'RE USING INCRYPTION.

LAWMAKERS ARE NOT
CONVINCED.

YOU CAN TELL ME HOT LEAD
INVESTIGATOR IS.

AND WHY THE FEDS CALLED THE
FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT A
POSSIBLE CRIMINAL.
