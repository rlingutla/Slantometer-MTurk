QUESTION ABOUT GUN CONTROL AFTER
DOING THAT.

THEY'VE BEEN FILLING IN THE DOOR
ON THE LEFT TO OUR LEFT SIDE OF
THAT -- THE BLUE WALL BACK
THERE, THE BLUE CURTAIN.

THERE'S A NEWS CONFERENCE COMING
UP.

IT'S TAKEN ON AND TAKEN OFF.

WE STRUGGLE FOR THE WORDS TO
EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN HOW SUCH
EVIL CAN EXIST, HOW THERE CAN BE
SUCH CRUELTY AND SUCH SUFFERING.

IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL
WORKERS WERE CONGRATULATED BY
THE PRESIDENT AND THANKED BY THE
PRESIDENT ON BEHALF OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

SO GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES TALK
ABOUT THE NEED TO CLOSE THE GUN
SHOW LOOP HOLE AND LOOK AT THE
ACCESSORIES LIKE THE BUMP STOP
MECHANISM TO MAKE A
SEMIAUTOMATIC TO AN AUTOMATIC
WEAPON.

PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

IT WAS AN IMPROMPTU EVENT.

LEARNING FROM INVESTIGATORS
ABOUT THE GIRLFRIEND?

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MEETING WITH
SOME OF THE HEROS OF THE
ATTACKS.

SOME WITH GRIEVOUS INJURIES AND
FAMILY MEMBERS, MEMBERS OF THE
TRAUMA TEAM, THE SURGEONS, O.R.

THAT GOODNESS IS OUR LIGHT HOUSE
AND OUR SOLACE.

WHERE IS KEVIN.

THAT'S GREAT.

HERE, LOOK.

THE SEMIAUTOMATICS ARE WORTH
BETWEEN $1,500 AND $3,000.

BUT HE HAD A LOT OF COMPANY WITH
HIM ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE.

SEE ME.

HE SAYS THAT THEY HAVE DONE AN
INCREDIBLE SERVICE FOR THEIR
COMMUNITY.
