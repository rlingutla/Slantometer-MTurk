AND TONIGHT, THESE PHOTOS
REVEALING THEIR DESTRUCTIVE
POWER.

SHELDON'S PARENTS TELLING US,
THEY WANT TO MEET THAT HERO.

I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO RUN.

AND THE OTHER MAJOR
DEVELOPMENT, THE GUNMAN'S
GIRLFRIEND, SHE IS BACK IN THE
U.S. TONIGHT, BEING QUESTIONED
NOW BY THE FBI.

IT ALLOWS THE GUN TO FIRE
CONTINUOUSLY LIKE AN AUTOMATIC
WEAPON.

I LOST HER, AND I WAS SAD.

THE GUY THAT WAS BY YOUR SIDE,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND
OUT WHERE HE IS --
 NO.

HER BROTHER TELLING ABC NEWS
THAT SHE ASSURED HER FAMILY SHE
HAS A, QUOTE, CLEAN CONSCIENCE.

GO THAT WAY!

A HANDFUL OF SENATE REPUBLICANS
SEEM OPEN AN IDEA OF HOLDING
HEARINGS ON THIS SUBJECT.

HE MET HER WHEN SHE WAS A CASINO
HOSTESS.

THE OFFICERS TAKING COVER, THEN
JUMPING INTO ACTION, TRYING TO
HELP THE THOUSANDS RUNNING FOR
THEIR LIVES.

AND BY THE WAY, SHELDON'S DAD
TOLD US TONIGHT THAT HIS SON
TOLD HIS HERO, JIMMY, HE'S GOING
TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE OF
A BEER, AND SOON.

SHELDON?

HELPING HIM AND NEVER LEAVING
HIS SIDE.

ABOUT GUNS IN THIS COUNTRY GROWS
LOUDER, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF,
NOT WILLING TO GO THERE, NOT
TODAY.

AND INSIDE THAT HOTEL ROOM,
IMAGES OF HIS DEADLY ARSENAL.

PRESIDENT TRUMP, IN A NEW
ROLE --
COMFORTER IN CHIEF.

LINDSEY ROGERS, SAW HIM STANDING
ALONE, SHE STAYED BY HIS SIDE.

WE SEE IT EVERYWHERE HERE, THE
ACTS OF KINDNESS.
