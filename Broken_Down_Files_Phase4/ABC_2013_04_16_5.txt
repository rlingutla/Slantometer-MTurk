THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEY WANTED
TO DO.

AND THAT 78-YEAR-OLD RUNNER WHO
WAS KNOCKED DOWN BUT PICKED
HIMSELF UP AND FINISHED THE
RACE.

HOWEVER, THE PLACEMENT OF IT IS
SOPHISTICATED.

US THEY HAVE TONS OF VIDEO, AND
SOMEWHERE IN THERE WILL BE A
PICTURE OF THE PERSON WHO
PLANTED THESE TWO BOMBS, DIANE.

SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP!

SEEMED TO SPEAK FOR MANY TODAY.

SUPPORT AND PRAYERS FOR THIS
FAMILY.

THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO TAKE
DOWN THE BUILDING.

IN A STATEMENT BILL RICHARDS
SAID, WE THANK OUR FAMILY AND
FRIENDS, THOSE WE KNOW AND THOSE
WE HAVE NEVER MET, FOR THEIR
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS.

AT LOGAN AIRPORT, DELAYS OVER
SUSPICIOUS PASSENGERS AND
PACKAGES.

BUT THE BOMB MAY HAVE HIT
OTHER METAL OBJECTS THAT THEN
SPLINTERED APART?

AS CITIZENS, WE HAVE TO BE
RESPONSIBLE ONE TO ANOTHER.

AS DAN HARRIS GIVES US NEW
INSIGHT, TAKING US BEHIND THOSE
IMAGES WE ALL WATCHED TOGETHER
AS IT HAPPENED.

DIANE, TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF
HOW BOSTON IS COMING TOGETHER IN
THE WAKE OF THESE ATTACKS, LATE
TODAY, THE RED CROSS ANNOUNCED
THAT IT IS NOW TURNING AWAY
BLOOD DONORS.

INTRIGUING, BUT AUTHORITIES SAY
THEY'RE GIVING IT NO SPECIAL
PRIORITY.

WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS
HEROISM, LARGE AND SMALL AT ALL
TIMES AT MASS GENERAL, AND WE
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.

SELFLESSLY, COMPASSIONATELY,
UNAFRAID.

THE MONTH OF THE WACO RAID AND
THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

ITS COMPASSION ETCHED IN CHALK
ON THE DRIVEWAY OF THE FAMILY'S
HOME.

I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF IT'S
A LONE ACTOR.
