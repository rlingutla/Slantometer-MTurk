I'M REALLY -- A LOT OF PEOPLE
KILLED LAST NIGHT.

AN AUSTRALIAN TV STATION HE
SPENT A WEEK WITH THE COUPLE IN
NEVADA IN 2015, STAYING WITH
THEM IN A LUXURY CASINO SUITE,
AND LATER AT HIS HOME, WHERE
PADDOCK SHOWED OFF WHAT HE
CALLED HIS GUN ROOM.

WE HAVE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING.

DID YOU KNOW HE WAS HIT?

AND I SAID, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

COMFORTING HIM, KEEPING HIM
CALM.

HE WAS VERY STRICT AND VERY
FIRM ON THE FACT THAT IT IS A
RIGHT, IT IS A CAPACITY, AND IT
IS THE FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN
RESIDENT AND PERSON TO
PARTICIPATE, TO OWN A GUN AND
USE IT AS SEEN FIT WHEN NEED BE.

BUT THEY BECAME SEPARATED IN THE
CHAOS.

JUST AMAZING THERE WAS
SOMEBODY THERE TO HELP MY DAD
AND HE WAS -- I THOUGHT HE WAS
ON THE STREET SOMEWHERE.

WE BELIEVE HE WAS SHOOTING
INTO THE CROWD, AND THEN THE
SECURITY GUARD WAS SHOT DURING
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE FRANTIC
EFFORTS TO SAVE THE VICTIMS.

WORST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN
HISTORY, LAS VEGAS POLICE
ACKNOWLEDGING THEY STILL DON'T
KNOW WHAT DROVE STEPHEN PADDOCK
TO OPEN FIRE ON THAT HELPLESS
CROWD.

HE'S BEING HAILED AS A HERO AS
THE CITY CONTINUES TO MOURN.

POLICE ARE SAYING AS THAT GUARD
NEARED THE DOOR IT DIVERTED HIS
ATTENTION FROM THE CROWD TO THE
HALLWAY.

I HAD NO IDEA.

WE MOVE ON TO OTHER
HEADLINES AT THIS HOUR AND FROM
LAS VEGAS NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

STAND RIGHT HERE.

YOU SEE DOUG HERE DAZED AND
STAGGERING, A BULLET IN HIS ARM.

IN THE YEAR 2015 HE REPORTED
INCOME OF $5 MILLION.

WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY
ASPECT FROM BIRTH TO DEATH OF
THIS SUSPECT IN THIS CASE.

AND THEN SHE SAID, WELL, THEN
WHY ARE YOU SO SAD?
