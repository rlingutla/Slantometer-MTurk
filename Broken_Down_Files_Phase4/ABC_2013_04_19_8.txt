RIGHT NOW THEY'RE STILL HERE.

BUT THESE LARGER, WELL, ONE
AMBULANCE AND A LARGER BIG BLACK
TRUCK JUST CAME DOWN THE STREET.

YES, WELL, WE'VE BEEN HERE ON
FRANKLIN STREET, WELL, ALL DAY,
AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING
EVERYTHING ALL NIGHT, AS WELL.

I'M TRYING TO GET SOME CLARITY
ON THAT, BUT THE GUIDANCE WE
HAVE, A SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY
AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING FURTHER
INFORMATION FROM THE BOSTON AND
LOCAL AUTHORITIES VERY SOON.

TO GO IN AND TO INTERROGATE
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THEIR APPREHENSION.

CONDITION UNKNOWN.

AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, MY
PARENTS, YOU KNOW, FRIENDS,
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD IS TEXTING
AND CALLING, EVEN PEOPLE I
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM IN YEARS, AND
I DID SAY, KIDDINGLY, YOU KNOW,
HOW COULD YOU NOT FEEL SAFE, OUR
HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY SURROUNDED
BY EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
IN THE UNIVERSE, SO, I WAS -- IT
WAS A LITTLE TONGUE IN CHEEK.

AND --
 DAVE IS HIS FIRST NAME.

PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED.

BRIAN ROSS, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME
NOW, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THAT?

THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GUN
FIRE, WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENED
BEFORE WE OVERHEARD THE POLICE
OFFICERS TALKING.

DO THEY HAVE HER IN CUSTODY
TONIGHT?

I WOULD SAY ABOUT FOUR MINUTES
LATER, THE POLICE CAME RUSHING
DOWN THE STREET.

THIS HAS HEIGHTENED THE STRESS
AND, YOU KNOW, BUT IT IS -- IT
IS -- IT'S KIND OF JUST A
WEARING, STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE.

IT WAS VERY, VERY UNNERVING.

WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON OVER THERE
IS, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SHOTS
FIRED AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE
SOME EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, WHETHER
THEY THREW THEM IN THE BOAT OR
THEY WERE THROWN OUT OF THE
BOAT, I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY
HAVEN'T POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED
THE PERSON, I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S WHO IT IS, BUT THEY DON'T
WANT TO GO -- THEY HAVEN'T GONE
IN YET BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
IF HE IS WIRED FOR EXPLOSIVES.

WE HEARD THE POLICE OFFICERS
SPEAKING AND THEN A LITTLE
WHILE -- WELL, QUITE AWHILE
LATER, THERE WERE SEVERAL
EXPLOSIONS AND THEN SOME MORE
GUN FIRE.

BUT THAT DOES OPEN THE
POSSIBILITY THAT HE WOULD BE
ABLE TO BE QUESTIONED AND REVEAL
WHETHER IT WAS JUST HE AND HIS
BROTHER OR IF THERE WAS A LARGER
ORGANIZATION HE WAS PART OF.

YOU KNOW, THE -- THERE WAS JUST
A RUSH DOWN THE STREET OF ALL
THE VEHICLES AND JUST NOW THEY
ACTUALLY BROUGHT AN AMBULANCE
DOWN THE STREET AND AN ENORMOUS
BLACK SPECIAL UNIT TRUCK.

AND THEY HUGGED.
