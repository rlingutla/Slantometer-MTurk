"A DECADE IN AMERICA ALREADY, I
WANT OUT."

ABSOLUTELY.

SO WHEN HE'S ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE, POLICE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME,
MAYBE 50 MINUTES, TO INTERVIEW
THE SUSPECT BEFORE THEY HAVE TO
READ HIM HIS RIGHTS.

BUT THEY APPARENTLY WERE NOT.

HE'S THE GUY WHO FOUND THE
SUSPECT IN HIS BOAT IN HIS
BACKYARD.

THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY
EXEMPTION IN CASES OF NATIONAL
SECURITY AND ACTS OF TERRORISM.

SEPARATED BY 1,900 MILES, BUT
CONNECTED BY THIS MAN.

TWO DAYS LATER, BACK HOME IN
TEXAS, BERTI WAS DRIVING FROM A
MEETING.

AND THIS IS THE BOAT'S OWNER,
DAVID HENNEBERRY, A MAN NOW
CALLED A HERO FOR FINDING THE
SUSPECTED MARATHON BOMBER LAST
NIGHT AND CALLING 911.

THERE'S TWO KEY QUESTIONS.

TODAY, MONEY AND GOODWILL HAVE
BEEN FLOWING ALL DAY LONG.

I GOT AN E-MAIL THIS MORNING,
SOME PERSON IN DETROIT,
MICHIGAN, WHO WANTS TO REPLACE
THE BOAT FOR THE WATERTOWN
RESIDENT THAT GOT SHOT UP.

ACCORDING TO HIS NEIGHBOR --
 HE STARTED TO OPEN UP THE
ZIPPER, LOOKED INSIDE AND HE SAW
BLOOD.

E WASN'T TOO RELIGIOUS, THIS
NEIGHBOR IT IS ABOUT THE FATHER.

TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS
COUNTRY, JUST LIKE HIM, THAT ARE
TOUCHING EXTREMIST WEBSITES,
THAT ARE ESPOUSING THINGS THAT
AREN'T PARTICULARLY KIND TO
AMERICANS, BUT THAT'S NOT
AGAINST THE LAW HERE.

WATERTOWN'S CHIEF OF POLICE SETS
THE SCENE.

SO I TURNED AROUND AND SAW THE
SMOKE COMING FROM THE FINISH
LINE.

PASSIONATE ABOUT ITS BASEBALL
TEAMS, SPORTS ARE THE THERAPY
TODAY.

FENWAY PARK IS A SPECIAL
PLACE.

AGAIN?
