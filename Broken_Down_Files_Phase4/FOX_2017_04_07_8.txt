PUTIN SAYS THEY WILL REDUCE
COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED
STATES AND REINFORCE AL-ASSAD'S
AIR DEFENSES.

THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO RAN
SAYING HE WASN'T GOING TO GET
INVOLVED AND THIS IS A PRESIDENT
TRYING TO REACH OUT AND CREATE A
NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
KREMLIN.

WE'RE TOLD YESTERDAY AT 430
EASTERN TIME AFTER BEING BRIEFED
BUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
AT MAR-A-LARGO, HE TOOK THE
DECISION.

AFTER ALL, 99% OF THE KILLING
HE'S DONE IS WITH BARREL BOMBS
AS THE MAJOR PROBLEM IN THIS
CONFLICT SO FAR.

WE ARE OUT OF OPTIONS.

WE'VE SEEN THE MIGRANT FLOW AND
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
FLOWING TO EUROPE DETABLIZING
THOSE COUNTRIES AND PUTTING INTO
RISK THE VISA WAIVER PROGRAM.

I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO
NECESSARILY IMPEDE US GETTING
BACK TO BUSINESS NEXT WEEK WHEN
I BELIEVE MR. TILLERSON IS
SCHEDULED TO VISIT MOSCOW.

CHRIS WILL TALK TO JOHN CORNYN
OF TEXAS AND THE MAJORITY WHIP
AND A MEMBER OF THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE.

LAST NIGHT THERE WERE 12 TO 100
RUSSIAN MILITARY PERSONNEL AT
THE SYRIAN AIR BASE WHEN THE
U.S. MILITARY STRUCK.

LEAVES A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF
WHAT COMES NEXT.

THEY'RE NOT OBVIOUS.

THEY KILL EVERY ONE IN THE
VICINITY THE SAME WAY THESE DO.

WE'RE WAITING TO HERE HOW BASHAR
AL-ASSAD WILL RESPOND TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MISSILE
STRIKES.

WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE FACTS ON
THE GROUND AND MIGHT ALLOW FOR A
DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.

THIS IS RUSSIAN DEFENSE VIDEO
TAKEN FROM THE COCKPIT OF A
DRONE.

IRAN, RUSSIA AND HEZBOLLAH
ARE ALL BACKING THE SYRIANS.

TALK ABOUT BEING A FLY ON THE
WALL, THAT WILL BE AN
INTERESTING ONE TO BE A
PARTICIPANT IN.

GLAD YOU'RE IN.

MAY HAVE BEEN A FEW.

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR RUSSIA AND
IRAN TO DEFEND THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
