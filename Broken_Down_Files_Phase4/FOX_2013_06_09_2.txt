PARTY BUT THEY ARE
COLLEAGUES AND COLLABORATE
ON THEIR DECISION TO SEND
MR. SNOWDEN IS HERE.

IN MINUTES NEW REACTION TO
CLAIMS THE ORDER TO GO
AFTER CERTAIN AMERICANS
CAME FROM WASHINGTON.

THIS IS CLEARLY IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW.

TOMORROW A MEETING THAT
COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR
HER AND SIMILAR CHILDREN.

GO, I WANT YOU TO HEAR THAT
INTERVIEW.

PRESIDENT OF CHINA IS NOT
THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON.

ANYBODY IN THE POSITION

THEM ON THE OPEN MARKET TO
RUSSIA.

ADMITTED LEAKER A
29-YEAR-OLD FORMER C.I.A.

ADVERSARIES.

BEEN AN EMPLOYEE LESS THAN
THREE MONTHS ASSIGNED TO A
TEAM IN HAWAII.

QUICKLY, FORECASTING INTO
TOMORROW, WHAT DO YOU
PERCEIVE WILL BE THE NEXT
FEW STEPS?

SNOWDEN ARE BLOWING THE
WHISTLE BUT SOME PEOPLE
WON'T CALL HIM A
WHISTLEBLOWER.

HE HAS GIVEN THE CHINESE A
HUGE THING IN THE GAME.
