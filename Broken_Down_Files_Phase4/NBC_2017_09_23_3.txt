THIS IS WHAT WE DO
ALL DAY.

WE'VE LANDED HERE
IN SAINT THOMAS WHERE
THE AIRFIELD IS MOSTLY
CLEAR OF DEBRIS,
THEY'RE BRINGING IN AN
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL
MOBIL COMMAND TOWER.

NEVER HAS IT FELT SO
ALONE.

THE ACTUAL NUMBER WAS
MUCH LOWER, JUST
HUNDREDS IN CERTAIN
COMMUNITIES NEAR THE
DAM.

AIRLIFTING AN AIR
TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER
TO START THE PROCESS
OF RECOVERY.

FAMILIES, THEIR ONLY
CONNECTION TO THE
OUTSIDE WORLD IS ONE
SPOTTY A.M. RADIO
STATION.

WE'RE DOING
EVERYTHING WE CAN, AS
FAST AS WE CAN, AS
FAST AS WE'RE ALLOWED.

THOUSANDS TOLD SO
EVACUATE BEFORE WHAT
COULD BE AN EPIC
FLOOD.

BACK HOME, THEY CAN'T
HEAR FROM US, THEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.

CLUSTER HOPING,
PRAYING FOR ONE MEASLY
BAR OF CELL SERVICE.

THE IDEA IS TO USE
THIS AIRFIELD AS A
STAGING GROUND FOR THE
BROADER RELIEF EFFORT.
