THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING AT
WHICH CAME TO NOTHING.

THERE'S RUSSIA ANGLE AS YOU HAVE
DISCUSSED.

THE RUSSIANS ARE ON THE GROUND
SUPPORTING AL-ASSAD.

THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN PENTAGON
GAME PLANS.

IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES, ANOTHER
SIGN.

AND WHEN ASKED IF THE PRESIDENT
WAS GOING TO TAKE TO PRESIDENT
PUTIN, HE SAID I MAY.

STODDARD.

RIGHT.

SECRETARY OF STATE TILLERSON
ANNOUNCING THAT "STEPS ARE
UNDERWAY TO ORGANIZE AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, FROM
POWER FOLLOWING THIS WEEK'S
APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK IN THE
WAR-TORN COUNTRY."

NOBODY IN CONGRESS KNOW WHAT'S
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

BUT THESE PICTURES AND THIS
INCIDENT IS NEW ALONG WITH THIS
PRESIDENT AND HIS ENTOURAGE.

HE WAS ASKING WHETHER BASHAR
AL-ASSAD SHOULD GO.

WE KNOW THE RUSSIANS WANT NATO'S
FRONT NOT TO BE SO CLOSE TO THE
RUSSIANS.

COULD REALLY UPSET THE
EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT REGION AND
AROUND THE WORLD.

SO AT THIS POINT, WHAT IS
PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTING OF THE
RUSSIANS?

JUST A WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY
OF STATE ASKED ABOUT THIS IN
TURKEY.

NOW WE LEARNED THAT SYRIA'S
FOREIGN MINISTER HAS DENIED THAT
HIS GOVERNMENT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
WEAPONS IN  ATTACKS.

RESOLUTIONS, VIOLATES
INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND
LONG-HELD AGREEMENTS BETWEEN
PARTIES INCLUDING SYRIAN REGIME,
THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND ALL
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE U.N.
SECURITY COUNCIL.

THEN IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO
TRY TO REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD
FROM POWER AND THAT THE FOCUS
SHOULD BE ON DEFEATING ISIS.

FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TO BASHAR
AL-ASSAD HAS CHANGED.
