WE NEED HELP, WE NEED ALL THE
HELP WE CAN GET.

IN PUERTO RICO, MARIA'S WINDS
GAVE WAY TO MORE THAN 30 INCHES
OF RAIN.

WE NEED LIGHT.

PUERTO RICO, THE FIRST LOOK AT
HURRICANE MARIA'S WRATH, AS
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES FACE A
DIFFICULT NIGHT AND AN UNCERTAIN
FUTURE.

THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE.

AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE ARE DEAD, BUT
MANY OTHERS ARE MISSING IN
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY
CUT OFF.

CERTAINLY HOPE THAT FORECAST
HOLDS, DAVID.

AND ROB, I WANT TO GET BACK TO
WHAT THE CAREGIVER PLEADED FOR
AT THE NURSING HOME.

RIGHT
NOW.
