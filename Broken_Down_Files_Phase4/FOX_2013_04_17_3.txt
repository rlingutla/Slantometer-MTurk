TYLER.

ALSO VERY FRUSTRATING.

SO HE SEY TO STAY BELOW THE
RADAR SCREEN.

AS I SAY IT, IT IS
CLARIFIED AND CRAIG BOSS
WELL IS LIVE HERE IN BOSTON
WITH ME ON THIS.

DOCTORS DON'T ANTICIPATE
ANY FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE
AND THEY DON'T ANTICIPATE
THE NEED FOR ANY
AMPUTATIONS.

BUT, I HAVE SEEN THESE
PICTURES.

AND THEN IN 1995, OF
COURSE, THERE WAS THE
OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING AND
MANY MORE SMALL SCALE BUT
DEADLY BOMBINGS IN THE
1970S.

A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE SCENE
OF MONDAY'S BOMBING AND
WHAT HAS BEEN A SOMEWHAT
CHAOTIC DAY HERE.

EVERYONE ON HIGH ALERT
THERE AS CAN YOU IMAGINE.

OF COURSE, HOURS AGO WE
HEARD REPORTS THAT AN
ARREST WAS IMMINENT IN THE
ATTACKS.

AND I HOPE AND I BELIEVE
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT USING
THOSE PHOTOS CAN POSITIVELY
IDENTIFY THE MEN AND
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE THE
MEN WHO ARE ACTUALLY
RESPONSIBLE REMAINS TO BE
SEEN.

BUT YOU CAN'T BE 100%
SUCCESSFUL THAT THE KEY
HERE IS TO BE QUICK AND
DILIGENT IN THE
INVESTIGATION, BUT ALSO TO
BE RESILIENT.

THE BOMBINGS IN BOSTON,
BILL, ARE PARTLY SHOCKING
PURELY BECAUSE WE ARE THAT
MUCH SAFER THAN WE WERE
PRIOR TO 9/11.

SO WHILE WE MIGHT NOT FEEL
IT RIGHT NOW STAIVE TIS
PARTICULARLY SPEAKING, WE
ARE MUCH SAFER NOW THAN WE
WERE IN THE DECADES BEFORE
9/11.

800 EASTERN TIME FOX NEWS
WILL CARRY THAT BRIEFING
LIVE AS INVESTIGATORS TELL
US THE LATEST ON THE CASE.

WE'RE WAITING FOR A NEWS
CONFERENCE.

POSSIBLE SUSPECTS IN THOSE
TWIN BOMBINGS ON MONDAY.

SO, AS THIS INVESTIGATION
MOVES FORWARD SOME TRACE
EVIDENCE HAS BEEN MADE
PUBLIC.

TONIGHT, EXAMINING THE
EVIDENCE OF THE ATTACK HERE
AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.

FIVE MINUTES AGO THE FBI
HAS CANCELLED THE 800 P.M.
BRIEFING TONIGHT.
