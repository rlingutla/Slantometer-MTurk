THE WATER TEMPERATURES COME DOWN
AS WELL.

KNOCKING OVER TREES, TOPPLING
POWER LINES AND CAUSING SEVERE
FLOODING.

SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOF
DAMAGE.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE HEAD OF
FEMA ABOUT RESPONSE AND WE'LL
WATCH FOR HURRICANE MARIA'S NEXT
MONTH.

BUT TUESDAY, A STORM OFF THE
SHORE OF THE MID-ATLANTIC, SHEP.

THE GOOD NEWS IS THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY IN PUERTO RICO
DECLARED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP
COULD MEAN A LOT OF FEDERAL
DOLLARS FLOWING INTO THE ISLAND,
WHICH COULD BOOST THE ECONOMY AT
LEAST TEMPORARILY.

PUERTO RICO IS A PUERTO RICO --
POOR ISLAND TO BEGIN WITH.

IT'S NOT OVER YET.

ONE OF THE STRONGEST TO EVER HIT
AMERICAN SOIL AND THE
DESTRUCTION COULD BE WIDESPREAD.

IT'S A CATASTROPHIC STORM.

WHAT IS THE MOST URGENT NEED?

STORM, PUERTO RICO HAD A
CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND
TENS OF BILLIONS IN DEBT.

TO US?

PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL OF
SAN JUAN ARE REPORTING
WIDESPREAD FLOODING.

ALSO IN THE HOTELS AND METRO
AREA.

FEMA HAS PREPOSITIONED HERE.

10% IS ALREADY WITHOUT POWER
FOLLOWING HURRICANE IRMA WHICH
DIDN'T HAVE A DIRECT HIT.

PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR SAYS
PUERTO RICANS HAVE NOT
EXPERIENCED AN EVENT OF THIS
MAGNITUDE IN THEIR MODERN
HISTORY.

WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE,
IT GETS WORSE.

SO OFFICIALS ARE ASKING PEOPLE
TO REMAIN AT THEIR HOMES BECAUSE
IT'S NOT SAFE YET TO GET OUT OF
THE HOUSES.
