THIS MAYHEM TOOK PLACE OVER A
COUPLE OF HOURS.

WE ARE STILL GOING THROUGH
THE SEARCH WARRANT ACTIVELY AT
THIS TIME, BUT IT'S IN ACCESS OF
TEN RIFLES.

HANNAH AHLERS, A 35-YEAR-OLD
MOTHER OF THREE FROM
MURRIETA, CALIFORNIA.

WE ARE CLEARING THIS ROOM.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD THERE, IN
YOUR REPORTING, THE SHOOTER'S
BROTHER SAY THAT HE HAD NO
POLITICAL TIES, RELIGIOUS TIES,
NO CRIMINAL HISTORY.

I'M NOT GOING TO DIE.

ADDING TO THE MYSTERY, FEDERAL
OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS PADDOCK
SENT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS TO SOMEONE IN THE
PHILIPPINES IN THE LAST FEW
WEEKS.

AND THEN, THE PAUSE.

LATE TODAY, THIS GUN STORE IN
MESQUITE, NEVADA, CONFIRMING
THAT PADDOCK PURCHASED GUNS
HERE.

I SAID TO MYSELF, THESE GIRLS
AREN'T GOING TO DIE.

WE'VE GOT ONE SUSPECT DOWN.

HE WOULD HAVE TURNED 24 THIS
WEEK.

AFTER THE PRESIDENT CALLED THIS
AN ACT OF PURE EVIL.

WHAT THEY'VE NOW DISCOVERED IN
THE SUSPECT'S HOME.

TWO LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN
POLICE OFFICERS WERE ALSO HIT,
THE SHERIFF, EMOTIONAL.

THAT'S THE QUESTION WE ASK AFTER
SO MANY OF THESE MASS SHOOTINGS.

THE SIDEWALK NOW A TRIAGE
CENTER.

NOT HAPPENING.

SOURCES SAY SOME OF THE RIFLES
WERE HIGH POWERED, CAPABLE OF
SLICING THROUGH POLICE BODY
ARMOR.

WHAT THEY REVEAL, SAYING HE HAD
NO CRIMINAL PAST.
