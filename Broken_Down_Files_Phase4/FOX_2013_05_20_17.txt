SIMILAR NEIGHBORHOODS HIT
NOW LEVELED.

CUTTING JUST TO THE SOUTH
AND MOORE.

LATE IN THE SCHOOL DAY AT
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
PLACE DID NOT DO IT.

IT REMINDS ME WHEN I DROVE
THROUGH JOPLIN, MISSOURI TO
GO SEE MY PARENTS WHERE THE
HEART OF THAT FRMT-5 HIT.

AND I WONDER HOW THE PEOPLE
OF YOUR SMALL TOWN ARE
COPING THIS LATE AFTERNOON.

BEAR WITH ME.

WE DO KNOW THAT DOZENS OF
PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED.

ONE OF TWO ELEMENTARY
SCHOOLINGS STRUCK BY THIS
MASSIVE TORNADO THIS
AFTERNOON ALL STUDENTS AT
BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL ARE NOW ACCOUNTED
FOR.

WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT
SORT OF INJURIES THEY HAVE,
SEPTEMBER WHAT YOU HAVE
HEARD IN THE LAST HOUR.

BUT THE LATEST NEWS IS BAD.

THEY VASTLY INCREASED THE
NUMBER OF SHELTERS TORNADO
SHELTERS STORM SHELTERS
THEY GOT WORD TODAY 16
MINUTES BEFORE THIS MASSIVE
TORNADO CAME TO TOWN THEY
NEED TO TAKE SHELTER
IMMEDIATE CATTILY.

THOSE WHO SURVIVED HAVE
BECOME RESCUE WORKERS.

ANDREA ASH'S HUSBAND AND
HER SON ARE OVER THERE
TRYING TO GET DESPERATELY
TO THAT VICTIM.

WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT
PATH.

OF COURSE, THE CHOPPERS
HOVER.

THE AREA OF DEVASTATION
HERE IS MUCH LARGER.

AT THIS POINT IT'S BETWEEN
1 AND 2 MILES WIDE.

A SCENE OF UNTHINKABLE
DEVASTATION.

RUSHED GLANCES TO BRIAR
WOOD ELEMENTARY COOL ONE OF
TWO WE MENTIONED TO THE
MOORE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND
SEVERAL HOMES BUSINESSES
AND INTERSECTIONS SPAWNING
TO MULTIPLE INJURIES.

THAT THIS TORNADO WAS ON A
PATH SO EERILY SIMILAR TO
ONE FROM 1999.
