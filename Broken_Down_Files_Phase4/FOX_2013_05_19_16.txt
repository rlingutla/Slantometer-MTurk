THE PICTURES THAT HAVE COME IN
TO FOX NEWS IN THE PAST FEW
MINUTES.

WE HAVE HEARD REPORTS OF
DAMAGE.

THE SYSTEM IS SLOWLY MOVING
EASTWARD.

OUR EMERGENCY LEVEL WAS
ELEVATED TO A LEVEL TWO IN
PREPARATION FOR THE STORM TO
COME THROUGH.

I HAVE KIDS UP IN STILLWATER IN
COLLEGE.

THESE FOLKS REALLY NOT OUT OF
THE WOODS FOR THE NEXT 2-24    12-24
HOURS.

WE KNEW THAT THEY HAD HIT
OUTSIDE OKLAHOMA CITY.

STAY SAFE, EMILY OUR FIRST
PERSON EYES TONIGHT ON FOX
REPORT.

I GOOLSBEE WITH THE VIDEO
WATCHING WITH YOU AS IT
HAPPENS.

THAT CAN DO SOME PRETTY BAD
MEDICAL ATTENTION RELATED
DAMAGE I WOULD IMAGINE.

THE CONDITIONS WHERE YOU
WERE TODAY, IS THAT WITH YOU
WERE ANTICIPATING,  WHAT THE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES TOLD YOU
ABOUT?

WE TALKED WITH A STORM SPOTTER
THIS.

TOWARDS THE NORTH AND EAST IN
IOWA A TORNADO WARNING.

WELL, AS THE HAIL WAS COMING
DOWN AT FIRST IT STARTED OUT
YOU KNOW, LIKE PEA SIZED AND
THEN GOT TO MORE BIG MARBLES
AND THEN GOLF BALL WE CAME IN
THE HOUSE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

BEING IN THE CITY AND KNOWING
THERE IS A TORNADO MILES AWAY,
THERE WAS A TORNADO THAT
TOUCHED DOWN NEAR MY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

IT IS TERRIFYING.

WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS LIKE
COMPARATIVELY TO WHAT YOU
EXPERIENCED?

DAMAGE COULD BE QUITE SEVERE
AND EXTREME IN SOME OF THE
AREAS AS THE STORMS PUSH
EASTWARD AND THEY ARE NOT
LETTING UP UNFORTUNATELY.

REALLY TWO BIG STORMS, JEFF,
THAT ARE PRODUCING POSSIBLE
TORNADOES HERE RIGHT HERE IN
AND AROUND CENTRAL OKLAHOMA.
