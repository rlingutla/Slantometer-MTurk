AND THE BRAVERY IN OKLAHOMA
THIS WEEK.

ABOUT HER OWN DAUGHTER IN THE
FOURTH GRADE OR HER SON IN THE
FIRST GRADE.

YES.

AND JUST BEFORE THAT TORNADO
HIT, THEY WERE WRITING WHAT THEY
LIKED MOST ABOUT THEIR TEACHER.

AND -- AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

SHE SAID MANY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

AND WE SAW THE
MOMENT LITTLE SAM FOUND HIS
MOTHER, LOOKING UP AT HER,
CONCRETE GRIT IN HIS HAIR.

THE SCHOOLWORK RIGHT THERE ON
THE DESK WHERE IT WAS LEFT.

BUT WE NOTICED
MRS. MARINELLI'S FIRST GRADE
CLASSROOM IN TACT.

MOST EVERYTHING THERE IS GONE.

WHEN SHE TOOK US BACK THIS WEEK,
SHE SHOWED US WHERE HE WAS, IN
THE BACK CORNER OF THAT ROOM.

I WILL REMEMBER SHE GAVE ME
CUPCAKES.

SO MANY TEACHERS.

AND SO MANY OF THEM HAD CHILDREN
SOMEPLACE ELSE IN THOSE SCHOOLS.

TOUR OF THAT OTHER SCHOOL, TOO,
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY, WHERE
THEY LOST SEVEN LITTLE FACES IN
ONE HALLWAY.

MRS. DIEDZIK, WHO WAS HELPING
HER OWN STUDENTS --
 YOU ARE SAFE AND YOU ARE
FINE.

BOTH SURVIVED.

THE CHILDREN BURYING THEIR HEADS
AT BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY, TRAPPED
UNDER THAT TORNADO HOVERING
OVERHEAD.

SHE TAUGHT THE AUTISTIC
CHILDREN.
