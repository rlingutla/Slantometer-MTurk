IN SAN JUAN, A LOT OF PEOPLE
LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE AREAS
HIT HARD.

THE MONSTER STORM COULD COST
BILLIONS IN DAMAGE ACROSS THE
CARIBBEAN.

SO TURNING THE LIGHTS BACK ON

HAVE SHOWN HOW BAD SOME OF
PUERTO RICO'S INFRASTRUCTURE
PROBLEMS ARE.

MAKING LANDFALL 615 A.M.
MAYBE A LITTLE BRIGHT NEWS,
ANOTHER GOING OVER LAND DURING
THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.

BUT HURRICANE MARIA HAS KILLED
ANYBODY PEOPLE ACROSS THE
CARIBBEAN.

WE TALK ABOUT THE ISLAND BEING
WITHOUT POWER.

SHEP, THE ECONOMY IS
EXTREMELY DIRE.

THEY HAVE BILLIONS IN UNFUNDED
PENSIONS TO TEACHERS AND
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.
