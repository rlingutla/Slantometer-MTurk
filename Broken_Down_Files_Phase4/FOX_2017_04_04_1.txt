BLAMING THE ASSAD REGIME FOR
WHAT THE PRESIDENT CALLS HEINOUS
ACTIONS.

QUESTIONING WHETHER IT'S TIME TO
TAKE ACTION AGAINST ASSAD.

THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT READS
THE FOLLOWING "TODAY'S CHEMICAL
ATTACK IN SYRIA AGAINST INNOCENT
PEOPLE, INCLUDING WOMEN AND
CHILDREN, IS REPREHENSIBLE AND
CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
CIVILIZED WORLD.

ACTIVISTS CLAIM SYRIAN OR
RUSSIAN FIGHTER JETS DROPPED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A TOWN IN
NORTHERN SYRIA.

IT'S CALLING ACTIONS BY BASHAR
AL-ASSAD HEINOUS AND THAT IS A
SHIFT FROM WHAT TOP TRUMP
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING DAYS AGO.

AFTER THAT, PRESIDENT ASSAD
AGREED TO DESTROY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

ONE DOCTOR SAID HE SAW PATIENTS
WITH PINPOINT PUPILS.

HE SAID THE SYRIAN PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE A DECISION ABOUT ASSAD'S
FATE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.

SECRETARY TILLERSON JUST PUT OUT
A STATEMENT.

CHAPTER.

TODAY REPORTERS ASKED SEAN
SPICER IF THE UNITED STATES WILL
RESPOND.

HE SAID THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A
LACK OF COMFORT WITH ASSAD.

NOW THE WHITE HOUSE UNDER
GROWING PRESSURE TO DEAL WITH
THE RUSSIAN BACK'S DICTATOR,
AL-ASSAD AFTER THE
ADMINISTRATION SAID THEY'RE NOT
FOCUSED ON REMOVING HIM FROM
POWER.

THIS IS THE THIRD CLAIM OF A
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN JUST OVER A
WEEK IN SYRIA.

THIS COMING DAYS AFTER THE U.S.

THESE ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE
PAST ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS.

WE'RE SHOWING THEM THOU BECAUSE
THEY CONVEY THE TRUE HORROR OF
THIS ATTACK AND THE VICTIMS IT
INVOLVES.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE WOULD
ESTABLISH A RED LINE AGAINST THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND DID
NOTHING.

IN A MOMENT HERE, CHILDREN AMONG
THE DEATH AFTER REPORTS OF A
CHEMICAL ATTACK INSIDE SYRIA.

MANY COUNTRIES WORRY WHETHER HE
GAVE UP HIS MATERIALS.
