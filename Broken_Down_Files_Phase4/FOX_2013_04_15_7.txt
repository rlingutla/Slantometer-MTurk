TONIGHT, I ASKED HIM WHAT
HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE NEWS
AFTER IT WENT OUT
THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HE
TALKED ABOUT HIS OWN
8-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO
WANTED TO BE HERE AT THE
FINISH LINE TO SEE HER
FATHER FINISH.

ARE THEY PURELY DOMESTIC?

IT'S PRETTY SAD.

MY FAMILY WAS IN THE
BLEACHER SECTION.

THE THING WITH THESE BOMBS
THOUGH IS THAT THERE IS SO
MUCH ENERGY CONTAINED IN
SUCH A TINY AMOUNT OF
CHEMICAL THAT YOU CAN DO
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE WITH
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,
ESSENTIALLY THE SIZE OF A
TENNIS BALL.

AND THE SECOND STEP IS TO
TURN TOWARDS THE
INVESTIGATION AND FIGURE
OUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE.

I MEAN, YOU KNOW, -- COUPLE
YEARS NOW DOING WHAT I
WORK FOR AND THERE IS A
HIGH POLICE PRESENCE THERE.

BUT THEY WERE CLEARLY ABLE
TO DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO
THE PEOPLE MANY OF THEM
GATHERED THERE.

THE LAST RUNNERS ACTUALLY
WERE RECORDED CROSSING THE
FINISH LINE AT 257 EASTERN
TIME THAT GIVES YOU A
PRETTY ACCURATE PICTURE OF
EXACTLY WHEN THOSE TWO
EXPLOSIONS RIPPED THROUGH
THE SCENE.

TODAY IT HAS.

IT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE
THERE BUT NOT FOR THE REST
OF US.

WE WERE READY FOR THIS.

ARE THEY DOE MESS STWIK
INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT?

THEY FRANKLY AT THIS MOMENT
DO NOT KNOW WITH ANY
CERTAINTY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE
IS.

THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS
THAT IT IS VERY HARD TO
INTERCEPT COMMUNICATIONS.

I THINK -- I LITERALLY HIT
THE FINISH LINE AS IT
HAPPENED AND LOOKED AT AN
OFFICIAL WHO WAS FACING
THAT WAY AND HE HAD THIS
LOOK OF HORROR ON HIS FACE.

THE FBI LENDING ASSISTANCE
AS THE FBI PUTS IT.

A CAR BOMB THAT THANKFULLY
FIZZLED AND DID NOT GO OFF.

HONESTLY, IT WAS.
