THIS IS EDMOND, OKLAHOMA WHERE
WE KNOW THERE WAS A LARGE
TOUCHDOWN.

THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE
DEPENDING ON THEIR WEATHER
PEOPLE TO WARN THEM AND KEEP
THEM OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

BUT SOUTH OF THAT WE ARE IN THE
THE COLDER DRYER AIR.

HEADING BACK DOWN TOWARDS PINK
AND LITTLE AXE THERE FOR YOU IN
NORTHEASTERN MCLEAN COUNTY.

CONFIRMED REPORTS OF TORNADOES
ON THE GROUND IN THE NORMAN,
OKLAHOMA AREA.

WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE
STORY TALKING WITH STORM
CHASERS AND BRINGING YOU AS
MUCH VIDEO COMING IN TO FOX
NEWS.

I MADE SURE THEY HAD THEIR CELL
PHONES CHARGE AND KNEW WHERE
THEY ARE GOING TO GO IF IT
HITS.

RIGHT ALONG RIGHT ON THE
HIGHWAY RIGHT THERE.

AND IT HAPPENED AS THE SUN WAS
SETTING.

WHAT HAPPENS IS WE ARE SCANNING
THE ATMOSPHERE AROUND HERE AND
THAT IS WHY EVERYTHING LOOKS SO
FUNNY AND USUALLY SOMETHING SO
CLOSE TO THE RADAR IT IS HARD
TO DIFFERENTIATE EXACTLY WHAT
IS GOING ON.

TAKE CHASER NET TWO FULL,
PLEASE.

I AM KEEPING MY EYES ON THAT
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS IS
POPPING.

AS WE TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT
BREAK LET'S WATCH AND LISTEN.

THESE ARE TWO REALLY
SIGNIFICANT STORMS RIGHT NOW.

IT HAS BEEN BETTER OF SIX HOURS
OR MORE WHERE THEY HAVE GONE
FROM WATCHES TO WARNINGS.

AFTERWARDS WE WENT OUTSIDE TO
LOOK AROUND AND MY HUSBAND DUG
A COUPLE OF LARGE HAIL STONES
THAT HAD ACTUALLY GONE DOWN
INTO THE GROUND AND I WANTED TO
FIND SOMETHING TO COMPARE IT TO
AND THAT IS A GRAPEFRUIT NEXT
TO THE HAIL PIECES DALLAS.

WHAT WAS IT LIKE AS IT WAS
COMING ACROSS YOUR TOWN?

THE GOOD NEWS IS THIS AREA OF
THE COUNTRY THEY ARE USED TO IT
AND HOPEFULLY THEY ARE HEEDING
THE WARNINGS AS WE BRING THEM
TO THEM.

A LOT OF ADVANCE NOTICE TO GO
TO YOUR SHELTERS AND YOU COULD
ALMOST TRACK IT FOR MILES AND
MILES JUST BY LISTENING TO OUR
MEDIA.

THAT WAS LIVE VIDEO HE THAT YOU
SAW THERE.
