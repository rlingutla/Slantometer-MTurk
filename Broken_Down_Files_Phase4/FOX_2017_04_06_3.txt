THEY'RE MAKING EQUIVOCATING
COMMENTS TODAY THAT IF IT WASN'T
REALLY AN ATTACK, A ACCIDENTAL
ATTACK ON A WEAPONS FACTORY RUN
BY THE REBELS, THAT WOULD BE OUT
OF THE NORMS.

THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED,
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES.

IT'S A SERIOUS MATTER.

HE'S THERE AND HE'S RUNNING
THINGS BUT SOMETHING SHOULD
HAPPEN.

IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE PLANS
ARE BEING DRAWN UP.

THIS IS NOTHING BUT TALK AT
LEAST AT THIS MOMENT.

THIS REPRESENTS AN ENORMOUS
DEPARTURE FROM DAYS AGAINST WHEN
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE SYRIANS
SHOULD DECIDE.

THE RUSSIANS HAVE PROPPED HIM
UP.

CONGRESS WILL BE ASKING AS THEY
REPRESENT THE PEOPLE IN 435
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS AND THE
HOUSE, THEY'LL BE ASKING FOR
HARD EVIDENCE TO LAY OUT THE
CASE IF THEY ARE TO SUPPORT MORE
AGGRESSIVE AIR STRIKES, LET
ALONE GROUND OPERATIONS THE
TOPPLE THE REGIME, THIS SOUNDS
LIKE A LONG BATTLE.

IT'S BREAKING NEWS AND IT'S
NEXT.

WHAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE
RUSSIANS.

IF HE WANTS TO DO SOME AIR
STRIKES ON THE WEAPONS ARSENALS,
THAT'S ONE THING.

 THE PROCESS BY WHICH AL-ASSAD
WOULD LEAVE IS SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES AN INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY EFFORT.

THE IDEA THAT THE RUSSIANS WOULD
ALLOW US TO STRIKE THE SIX AIR
STRIKES THAT EXIST SEEMS AT THIS
MOMENT IMPLAUSIBLE.

SO THE RUSSIANS SAY IT HAPPENED
THE OTHER WAY.

WHEN ASKED IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD
SHOULD LEAVE POWER, HE SAID IT'S
A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

THE TRUTH IS, THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MURDERING
ITS OWN PEOPLE FOR YEARS.

HE'S PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE
ANT I DON'T THINK HE HAS ANY
INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN OVER
WHAT CONCESSIONS WE GIVE.

HOWEVER QUIETLY.

YOU CAN ALWAYS CARRY OUT
STRATEGIC AIR STRIKES.
