MCCAIN SAYING IT'S GOT TO
BE A SERIOUS MILITARY
ACTION THAT ACTUALLY
DEGRADES ASSAD'S FORCES.

HAVE THE MEANS OF
DELIVERING THOSE WEAPONS.

I BELIEVE THAT
ABSOLUTELY ALLOWING THE USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON A
SIGNIFICANT STALE TO TAKE
PLACE WITHOUT A RESPONSE
WOULD PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT
THREAT TO UNITED STATES
NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST.

THE BRITISH COULD PROVIDE
ANOTHER SUBMARINE IF
PARLIAMENT VOTE SLATED LATE
FOR THURSDAY BILL.

THE ARAB LEAGUE MET TODAY
AND ISSUED A STATEMENT
BACKING U.S.

LET ME STRESS TO PEOPLE.

IF IT'S SIMPLY THAT WE
LAUNCH SOME CREWS MISSILES
AND DO THAT FOR THREE DAYS
AND NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT
EFFECT ON THE MOMENTUM ON
THE BATTLEFIELD IT WILL
HAVE AN UNHELPFUL EFFECT.

THEY SAY CONGRESS HAS TO
APPROVE ANY MILITARY
ACTION.

DO YOU BELIEVE THAT EXISTS
RIGHT NOW AN ACTUAL OR
IMMINENT THREAT TO THE
UNITED STATES?

BILL, A SENIOR U.S.
OFFICIAL TELLS FOX THAT ANY
STRIKE ON SYRIA IS LIKELY
TO LAST HOURS, NOT DAYS.

THE MILITARY IS READY TO
STRIKE WHENEVER PRESIDENT
OBAMA GIVES THAT ORDER.

SUCH A STRIKE COULD UNLEASH
THOSE CHEMICALS AND LEAD TO
A LOT OF DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION, SOURCES SAY.

AGAIN THE PLAN AT THIS
POINT IS TO DETER ASSAD AND
DEGRADE HIS ABILITIES.

BUT SYRIA WARNS IT WILL
STRIKE BACK WITH EVERYTHING
IT'S GOT.

THE U.S. IS PLANNING A
LIMITED STRIKE.

THE SYRIAN REGIME THE
ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THE
WEAPONS.

WE HAVE TEAM FOX COVERAGE,
JONATHAN HUNT LIVE HERE IN
NEW YORK WITH WITH A LOOK
AT THE OTHER COUNTRIES
CALLING FOR ACTION.

BUT, WITH THE RUSSIANS
BOUND TO BLOCK ANY UNITED
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL
RESOLUTION, IT APPEARS
BILL, THAT THE U.S. HAS
ALREADY MADE THE DECISION
TO GO AHEAD WITH ANY
MILITARY OPTION UNDER THE
AUSPICES OF NATO, RATHER
THAN THE U.N., BILL.

HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO
WIPE OUT EXACTLY THE PLACES
THAT WERE ATTACKED
BIOCHEMICAL WEAPONS.

CONCLUSIONS
OVER THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN SYRIA LAST WEEK
ON THE WESTERN FRONT BOTH
THE FRENCH AND BRITISH
PRIME MINISTERS TALKING
VERY MUCH ABOUT THE NEED
FOR MILITARY ACTION.
