THIS PARTICULAR HOUSE WE ARE
SHOWING THE RESIDENTS WERE ASKED
TO COME OUT FIRST BEFORE THEY
WENT IN.

I WILL BE.

YOU DON'T KNOW.

THE ACCOUNTS ARE HE WAS, SADLY
BASICALLY EXECUTED BY ONE OR
BOTH OF THESE SUSPECTS.

THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ENDANGER A
POLICE OFFICER OR AGENT IN THE
ARREST AND HAVE THIS GUY TRY TO
BLOW HIMSELF UP AT THE LAST
SECOND.

THEN THEY CAN CLOSE, MAKE THE
ARREST AND THEN ADMINISTER FIRST
AID.

THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE BLOOD THAT
MAY HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE SCENE
WHEN HE GOT ON TO THE BOAT OR
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT.

THEY APPEAR TO BE AT EASE.

YEAH.

LESTER HOLT, ANYTHING FROM WHERE
ABOUT THE FEAR AND THE CHILDREN
OF PEOPLE WHO HEARD EXPLOSIONS
AND SHOTS LAST NIGHT.

IT IS.

STATE POLICE GAVE ME A STRONG
HEAD SHAKE.

PETE, I GOT AN E-MAIL USING A
TERM OF ART IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

IT'S A HOT SCENE.

AMBULANCE ON THE SCENE.

THEY HAVE GOTTEN ALL RETRIEVABLE
EVIDENCE FROM THE HOUSE HE SARED
WITH HIS BROTHER FOR HOWEVER
LONG.

VEHICLES COMING AND GOING.

S.W.A.T.

THANK YOU.

THEY HAD AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
SUSPECT PINNED DOWN.
