ABOUT AN HOUR AGO THE
PRESIDENT SPOKE OF THIS
TRAGEDY AND THE
INVESTIGATION.

YOU START LOOKING AT ALL
THE INJURIES AND YOU SEE
PEOPLE COMING OUT WITH NO
LEGS.

ONE FIRST, THEN ANOTHER.

AND THE HOSPITALS IN THE
AREA ARE STILL TRYING TO
WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND THIS
AND WE ARE GETTING
DIFFERENT NUMBERS FROM
DIFFERENT HOSPITALS AS TO
JUST HOW SERIOUS THE
INJURIES ARE.

HE IS THE PRESIDENT UNDER
PRESIDENT CLINTON AND
GEORGE W. BUSH AND HE IS
WITH US NOW ON THE PHONE.

TO ESSENTIALLY STAY OFF THE
STREETS.

JUST A FEW FEET FROM THE
EXPLOSION WHEN IT HAPPENED.

I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OH MY
GOODNESS ANOTHER ONE COULD
GO OFF.

YET TO HEAR ANYMORE AS FAR
AS FATALITIES ARE
CONCERNED.

THEY ARE GOING TO BE TRYING
TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE
DEVICE CONTAINS OWN
SHRAPNEL.

THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

THIS IS BEING LOOKED AT AS
AN ONGOING EVENT AND
AUTHORITIES WANT TO ENSURE
THAT EVERYONE IS SAFE AND
THEY DON'T WANT ANYBODY OUT
ON THE STREETS IF THERE
CONTINUES TO BE GLARNG.

AMONG THEM, CHILDREN WHO
HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THEIR
PARENTS TO SEE A SUPPORTING
EVENT ON THIS HOLIDAY IN
BOSTON SHEP.

THOUGH THE FINE NEWS
ORGANIZATION IN BOSTON AND
ASSOCIATED PRESS ARE WELL
AHEAD OF THIS.

WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY
CONFIRM THAT, SHEP.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN YOU
HEARD THE IT THE SPEAKING
THERE VOWING THAT JUSTICE
WILL BE BROUGHT TO THIS
INVESTIGATION AS IT IT
UNFOLDS THERE HE DID NOT
USE AND THAT IS THE WORLD
THAI.

AND THEN 12 TO 14 SECONDS
LATER, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
SEE THE SMOKE IN THE
DISTANCE.

THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.

JOE DEFAZZIO WAS WORKING ON
COMMUNICATIONS AT THE RACE
AND WAS WORKING ON IT WHEN
THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED
THERE WAS ONE AS WE
REPORTED AND ANOTHER WHAT
APPEARED TO HIM TO BE THE
SAME INTENSITY.

CERTAINLY IN THIS CASE IT
SOUNDS LIKE THE SHRAPNEL
WAS ALL INCLUDED.
