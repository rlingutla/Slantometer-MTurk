THE GREATER BOSTON AREA ATTACKED
AND THE BOMBINGS ON MONDAY.

THEY WILL LIKELY USE WHAT'S
KNOWN AS THE PUBLIC SAFETY
EXCEPTION.

MOTIVATION, ANY OTHER
ASSOCIATES, ARE THERE FURTHER
DANGERS.

TEAMS TOOK VARIOUS
ROLES AS THEY WENT THROUGH
NEIGHBORHOODS AND POKED THROUGH
BACKYARDS LOOKING FOR THE VERY
KIND OF THING THEY FOUND HERE
TONIGHT.

I DON'T SEE SMOKE AND I DON'T
SMELL SMOKE.

THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH WHAT
DAN WAS SAYING WITH THE LIGHT
APPLAUSE HE MAY HAVE HEARD FROM
HIS VANTAGE POINT.

IS IT OVER?

THERE IS, OF COURSE, THE
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY WILL
MIRANDAIZE HIM RIGHT AWAY.

I HAVE SEEN THEM USED OUTDOORS
IN A COURTYARD, A WARTIME
BACKDROP IN AFGHANISTAN.

COOPER IS TALKING TO HIS
SOURCES.

FIVE YEARS AGO IT COULD HAVE
OCCURRED AND WE MIGHT NOT HAVE
HAD NEARLY THE DIGITAL RECORD
THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THIS CASE.

THIS IS A SILVER LINING ON A
DARK CLOUD GOING BACK TO 1996
WITH OKLAHOMA CITY, 1998 WITH
KENYA AND TANZANIA, THE FIRST
WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING
THROUGH 9/11.

THERE ARE FLASHING LIGHTS AT
EVERY END AND OFFICERS WITH
RIFLES BY THEIR SIDES AT EVERY
SINGLE END.

THAT WAS THE SUSPICIOUS POINT --
THE TEAR AND THE BLOOD STAINS
SUGGESTING THAT SOMEONE HAD BEEN
IN THERE OR WAS IN THERE WHICH,
AS IT TURNS OUT WAS THE CASE.

I WANT TO POINT OUT WE HAVE BEEN
WATCHING POLICE OFFICERS WORK SO
WELL TOGETHER.

WITH THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE OF SOMETHING INSIDE THE
BEST CASE SCENARIO WOULD BE FOR
THE NEGOTIATOR TO GET THE
SUBJECT TO COME OVER THE SIDE OF
THE BOAT, CROP TO THE GROUND SO
THAT THE TACTICAL TEAM.

GONE THROUGH 24 HOURS OF HELL IN
WATERTOWN, MASS.

THIS IS SOME OF THE DOOR-TO-DOOR
SEARCHES.

THEN THEY WILL START MOVING OUT
TOWARDS MOTIVATION, MORE DISTANT
NETWORKS, THINGS LIKE THAT.

THE SECOND SUSPECT WANTED IN THE
MARATHON BOMBING NOW ALIVE,
CAPTURED, IN CUSTODY AND ABOUT
TO BE ATTENDED BY MEDICS THERE
IN WATERTOWN.
