IT WILL BE BACK.

THE GOVERNOR OF THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS,
DEVAL PATRICK, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.

ONE PERSON RESPONDING, BEN
THORNDIKE, WHO WORKS IN A
BUILDING THAT OVERLOOKS THE
FINISH LINE.

AND IT'S, LIKE, THIS IS NOT HOW
I WANTED IT, BUT IT'S AROUND MY
NECK, AND I WAS A PART OF THIS
DAY.

AND THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT
IS FOCUSED ON.

THOSE WHO STEPPED UP AT AN AWFUL
MOMENT YESTERDAY.

MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER ARE BOTH
RECOVERING FROM SERIOUS
INJURIES.

INSTEAD THEY ARE FILING OUT OF
TOWN HAVING BEARED WITNESS TO
TERROR.

CARLOS ARREDONDO, THE MAN IN THE
COWBOY HAT, IS ONE OF MANY WHO
RAN TO HELP INSTEAD OF RUNNING
AWAY.

IT WAS SO LOUD.

THE CAPITALS PLAYING THE TORONTO
MAPLE LEAFS.

BUT REMINDERS ARE EVERYWHERE
THAT THINGS ARE NOT BACK TO
NORMAL.

CHARACTER, THEN CALL BOSTON
COURAGEOUS.

BRIAN, THEY WERE STANDING ON
THE SIDELINES CHEERING ON LOVED
ONES, FRIENDS AND EVEN
STRANGERS.

YES, YOU CAN CALL BOSTON
GENEROUS.

ANY IMAGERY YOU'VE SEEN THAT
WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THEY'RE
ANY FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD?

BEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE
USE OF SECURITY CAMERAS.

WELL, I THINK THE THING TO
REMEMBER HERE -- MAYBE TWO
THINGS TO REMEMBER.

TONIGHT WE'RE LEARNING MORE
ABOUT THE TRAUMA OF THOSE FIRST
FEW MOMENTS INCLUDING THE
VICTIMS.

FIRST OF ALL, THE FIRST JOB OF
EVERYBODY IS TO FIGURE OUT WHO
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED
AND PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED AND
TO BRING THAT PERSON OR PERSONS
TO JUSTICE.
