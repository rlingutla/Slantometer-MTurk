AND IT WOULD BE 14 AGONIZING
HOURS UNTIL DOUG WAS REUNITED
WITH HIS FAMILY.

FINALLY TONIGHT, SINGER
KEITH URBAN AT A VIGIL IN
NASHVILLE FOR THE VICTIMS IN LAS
VEGAS.

THE MAN TAKING THIS VIDEO RAY
PAGE TAKES HIM TO A MAKE-SHIFT
TRIAGE CENTER.

I GOT MY GUT HURTS THOUGH.

ALSO TONIGHT, WHAT WAS
WRITTEN ON A NOTE FOUND IN THE
GUNMAN'S HOTEL ROOM AS WE
LEARNED HOW MUCH THE GUNMAN MADE
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK
AND THE MILLIONS HE MADE IN JUST
ONE YEAR.

AND SHE SAID DID YOU KNOW ANY OF
THEM?

I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND A
MEDIC.

I HAD NO IDEA UNTIL 1200 THE
NEXT DAY WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN
THE HOSPITAL.

RAY PAGE THEN GOES TO GET HIS
TRUCK.

POLICE SAY THEY ARE SKEPTICAL OF
DANLEY'S CLAIMS THAT SHE KNEW
NOTHING ABOUT THE PLANS OF HER
LONGTIME BOYFRIEND
STEPHEN PADDOCK.

SOMEHOW THAT GUARD MANAGED TO
GET AWAY AND ALERT AUTHORITIES.

BUT A FAMILY FRIEND WHO VISITED
THEM IN NEVADA SAY THAT COULD
WELL BE TRUE, THAT SHE WAS
SUBSERVIENT TO HIM.

WHAT DREW THAT HOTEL SECURITY
GUARD TO THE HOTEL ROOM IN THE
FIRST PLACE AND EVEN THOUGH HE
WAS SHOT THROUGH THE DOOR WAS HE
THE ONE WHO STOPPED MORE
BLOODSHED?

I DO GOT ONE?

HE TALKED ABOUT A QUESTION FROM
HIS 9-YEAR-OLD AND PERFORMED A
SONG.

IT'S NOT WHAT I SAW AS A
LOVING, CARING RELATIONSHIP.

WE HAVE NO CREDIBLE
INFORMATION TO REPORT TO YOU AS
TO MOTIVATION.

I GET IT.

THANKFUL TO THE HEROES WHO SAVED
HIS DAD.

POLICE SAY PADDOCK HAD BEEN
SHOOTING WHEN CAMPOS ARRIVED ON
DOOR ALARM.
