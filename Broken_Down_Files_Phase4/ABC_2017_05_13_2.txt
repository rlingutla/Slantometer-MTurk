TONIGHT THE COMPUTER WIZ WHO MAY
HAVE STUMBLED ON A WAY TO
DISABLE THE ATTACK AND THE
INTERNATIONAL HUNT TO CATCH THE
CULPRITS BEFORE THEY STRIKE
AGAIN.

U.S. OFFICIALS BELIEVE AMERICAN
COMPANIES DODGED THE BULLET IN
THIS CASE BECAUSE MOST HAD
UPGRADED THEIR COMPUTERS TO
CLOSE THE VULNERABILITY AND THE
QUICK ACTIVATION OF THE KILL
SWITCH.

AMBULANCES TURNED AWAY AND LIVES
PUT AT RISK.

THE RACE TO STOP THE THREAT.

BELIEVE THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED
OUT WITH THE HELP OF A PROGRAM
FIRST DEVELOPED BY U.S.
INTELLIGENCE TO COMPROMISE THE
COMPUTERS OF TERRORISTS AND
FOREIGN ADVERSARIES.

WE BEGIN WITH
THE CYBERATTACK ROLLING ACROSS
THE GLOBE.

ALSO HELPED.

OFFICIALS SAY THEY BELIEVE THE
HACKERS ARE PREPARING A SECOND
WAVE OF ATTACKS WITHOUT A KILL
SWITCH THAT COULD COME ANY TIME
SOON TOM.

THE VIRUS CRIPPLING HOSPITALS
AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE GLOBE
AND HERE AT HOME.

WHAT'S ADVICE FROM OUR
EXPERTS TO OUR VIEWERS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES?

PEOPLE TRYING TO STEAL MONEY.

IT'S A HEINOUS CRIME.

HACKERS STRIKING AROUND 100,
LOOK AT THAT, COUNTRIES
INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S.
LOCKING UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
COMPUTERS, DEMANDING RANSOM TO
FREE THEM UP.

IT'S ONE THAT MICROSOFT
DELIVERED A SOLUTION FOR BUT A
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T USED IT.
