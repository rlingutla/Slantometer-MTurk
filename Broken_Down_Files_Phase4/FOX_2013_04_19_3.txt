THEY ARE GOING TO BRING IN
A DEVICE THAT CAN GO UP.

THIS IS STANDOFF AND YOU
CAN IMAGINE THAT NEIGHBORS
THERE IN THAT AREA ARE ON
EDGE.

IT IS A RESIDENTIAL AREA.

SHORTLY AFTER THAT, WE
STARTED SEEING SOME OF THE
POLICE VEHICLES ZOOMING UP
IN THIS DIRECTION.

WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE TO
YOU?

OUR LOCAL STATION IS NOW
REPORTING THAT THE SECOND
SUSPECT IN THE BOSTON
MARATHON BOMBING IS NOW
DOWN ON FRANKLIN STREET IN
WATERTOWN.

THEY DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING THAT WOULD
NECESSITATE HIM POTENTIALLY
TAKING HIS OWN LIFE IN THIS
SITUATION.

THEN 2 STOPPED AND THEN
THEY JUST SHUT THE ROADS
DOWN AND THEN EVERYONE IS
HERE.

AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS
NOTHING THERE.

AROUND HIM IN HIS HANDS OR
POTENTIALLY ON HIS PERSON.

OUR REPORTER CRYSTAL
HAINES JUST CALLED US.

IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS
ISN'T AN ESCALATION BUT
PART OF THE ONGOING
PROCESS.

EVERY SO OFTEN WE HAVE SEEN
A COUPLE OF BRIGHT WHITE
FLASHES.

WE WERE WALKING THE DOG.

THEN WE ALSO HAD THE FOOT
CHASE THAT ENSUED FOR THIS
INDIVIDUAL HERE IT APPEARS.

IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT'S
THE SAME THING THAT'S GOING
ON NOW.

I WOULD SAY AS MANY AS 10.

SOURCES TELL US THE SUSPECT
IS ALIVE AND SURROUNDED.

WE KNOW HE WAS POSSIBLY
HIDING IN A BOAT AT 67
FRANKLIN STREET AND WE KNOW
THERE IS A BIG POLICE
PRESENCE.

AND THEN WE HEARD A LOUD
BOOM.
