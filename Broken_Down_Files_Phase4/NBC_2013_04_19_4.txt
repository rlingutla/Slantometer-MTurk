THIS DOES MAKE SENSE THOUGH.

YOU WONDER HOW -- STEVE, DO
WE HAVE ANY IDEA --
 AMBULANCE CAN NOW GO TO THE
SCENE.

YOU SAID A SUCCESSFUL
RECOVERY WHICH WE WOULD SAY THEY
HAVE THIS 19-YEAR-OLD BOMBING
SUSPECT E IN CUSTODY AND HE'S
ALIVE.

WE'LL FOLLOW THAT.

TRY TO TAKE HIM ALIVE.

DON'T PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE
TO DO IT.

THAT GIVES THEM LEGAL AUTHORITY
TO QUESTION HIM INITIALLY ABOUT
THINGS WHICH POSE AN IMMEDIATE
THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

I THINK YOU HAVE THE GUY
RECOVERED WITH NO INJURY.

SPECIFICS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS.

THAT'S FANTASTIC, DAN.

WE ARE TOLD THE SUSPECT
SUFFERING FROM AT LEAST ONE
GUNSHOT WOUND AND BLOOD LOSS.

AN OFFICER SAYING, YES, HE'S
ALIVE.

THERE IS YOUR SUSPECT, IN
CUSTODY AND ALIVE.

WE ARE TOLD IT HAD A TEAR IN IT.

YOU SEE THE M. P I.T.

ACROSS FROM THE TOWN DINER IN
THIS TOWN THAT CAN NOW START TO
BREATHE AND LIVE A LITTLE BIT.

WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE SUPPORT
AND CONDOLENCES OFFERED BY SO
MANY PEOPLE.

THESE FOLKS HAVE LIVED THROUGH
HELL WITH THE SHOTS AND
EXPLOSIONS.

CLINT, AFTER TWO VOLLEYS OF
GUNFIRE AND WELL OUTNUMBERED
IT'S SURPRISING TO A LOT OF US.

THEY CAN ASK, ARE THERE MORE
IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
ANYWHERE?
