THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING
DEBRIS OVER THERE AND IT'S
PLAYING OUT I SEE IT IN
THREE SPOTS IN THE
BACKGROUND PEOPLE DIGGING
THROUGH THE RUBBLE TRYING
TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS UNDER
IT AND IF SOMEONE IS ALIVE
WE KNOW THE NEWS
HELICOPTERS NO-FLY ZONE.

WE WATCHED TRIAGE CENTERS
BEING SET UP ON SCENE.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

THE FRONT IS STILL STANDING
BUT THE BACK GONE.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE, IN FACT, SAYING
THAT THERE WERE SOME
20 MILES SCORED INTO THE
EARTH WHEN THIS THING CAME
THROUGH.

THAT'S ONE EFFORT WE ARE
TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF
RIGHT NOW.

THEY COULDN'T GET IN AND
OUT THEREOF IN THE EARLY
GOING.

VERY SIMILAR TRACK.

I CAN'T FIND IT INSPECTS
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND
THERE IS AN SIN ANGEL OF
BRANDON BROUGHT ME HOME.

A PLACE WHERE WOULD SAW
RESIDENTS AND NEIGHBORS AND
OFFICIALS TRYING TO PULL
PEOPLE FROM THE RUBBLE,
WHERE WE KNOW THEY AFFECTED
A NUMBER OF RESCUES OF
CHILDREN.

REPORTING FROM A COUPLE
OF HOURS AGO AS WE WERE
TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON
EXACTLY HOW SERIOUS THIS
SITUATION IS.

AND SURE ENOUGH, THROUGH
THAT TOWN IT WENT, A MILE
WIDE AT THE BOTTOM, TO TWO
MILES AT SOME POINTS.

HOUSE AFTER HOUSE AFTER
HOUSE STORIES UNBELIEVABLE
DAY AND MORE.

YELLING AT EACH OTHER.

IT HAS BEEN.

THE PATH OF THIS ONE IS
SIMILAR, THOUGH LONGER,
SIMILAR, THOUGH WIDER.

THAT IS UNTIL HURRICANE
KATRINA CAME THROUGH.

SO THIS STORM IS SIMILAR
BUT WORSE.

THE HOSPITAL IS PRETTY MUCH
DESTROYED SAYS THE MAYOR.

WE ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO
NEED THAT I JUST -- I
HONESTLY DON'T KNOW AT THIS
POINT.
