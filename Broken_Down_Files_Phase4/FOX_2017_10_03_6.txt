THE INFORMATION APPARENTLY AND
THE COMPONENTS TO DO THAT EASILY
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.

THERE'S WORDS I CAN SAY TO TAKE
THAT PAIN AWAY.

WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE MASSACRE IN
LAS VEGAS.

23 IN THE ROOM TOTAL.

ACTS OF HEROISM.

A BULLET STRUCK HIM IN THE NECK
LEAVING HIM WITH A CRACKED RIB
AND BRUISED LINK.

SOME HAD BEEN AUGMENTED, AFTER
MARKET, SO THEY COULD BECOME
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND MANY MORE.

SEE ME.

THE MANDALAY BAY IS FULLY OPEN
IS COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

BUT STORIES AFTER HEROISM
CONTINUE TO EMERGE.

GAPS IN THE STORY OF THIS MAN.

AUTHORITIES SAY IT'S SO RARE TO
HAVE A SHOOTING WITHOUT A
MOTIVE.

JASON ALDEAN WAS PERFORMING AT
THE END OF THE THREE-DAY
FESTIVAL WHEN THE GUN FIRE
BEGAN.

THE "NEW YORK POST" OBTAINED
THIS VIDEO FROM THE CRIME SCENE
IN TEXAS -- FROM THE CRIME SCENE
IN LAS VEGAS, I SHOULD SAY.

WE'LL REMEMBER THE ONES ABOUT
WHICH WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND TELL
YOU ABOUT THEIR LIVES NEXT.

AND THE FBI RAN PADDOCK THROUGH
THE CRIMINAL SYSTEM.

FIRE OFFICIALS SAY OFF DUTY
FIREFIGHTERS WERE SHOT WHILE
TAKING ACTION.

INVESTIGATORS LOOKING INTO THE
SUSPECTS SAY THEY'RE STRUGGLING
TO FIGURE OUT WHY HE CARRIED OUT
THIS MASSACRE.

YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH
SOMEONE, DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON
EVERYBODY.

IT'S NOON IN LAS VEGAS WHERE
VICTIMS RELATIVES TRY TO PROCESS
THEIR LOSS AND THEIR FEELINGS
FOR THE KILLER.
