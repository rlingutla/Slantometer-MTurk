WE'RE STILL WAITING ON THAT
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WE
EXPECT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL
BE IN SURGERY AS WE ARE
WAITING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT
THEIR INJURIES.

AND THE PROBLEM WAS HE --
THEY COULDN'T GET ANY
VEHICLES IN THERE BECAUSE
IT WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED
OFF AS IT USUALLY IS
BECAUSE OF THE MASS OF
SAW SOME PEOPLE BEING
WHEELED AROUND IN
WHEELCHAIRS WITHOUT
AMBULANCES.

IT'S PACKED WITH PEOPLE,
WHETHER THEY ARE FROM OUT
OF TOWN, FROM IN TOWN.

ALL OF A SUDDEN
EVERYONE, ALL THE RUNNERS
STARTED SAYING RUN.

BECAUSE THE CAMERAS WERE
THERE AND RECORDED IT
HAPPEN.

WE'RE TOLD THAT PERSON HAS
SEVERE BURNS BUT
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY
CANNOT DETERMINE WITH
CERTAINTY WHETHER HE WAS A
VICTIM OR AN ATTACKER.

ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT
NEWS EVENTS IS TO MAKE THEM
HAVE IMPACT YOU NEED TO
HAVE VIDEO OF IT HAPPENING.

AND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY
QUICK AND EASY TO GET LIVE
COVERAGE AFTERWARDS AND
THAT THERE WOULD BE A
RECORD OF WHAT YOU DID THAT
WOULD LAST FOR GENERATIONS
BEYOND ANY OF US.

WENT THROUGH THE TRIAL, I
COVERED THE OKLAHOMA CITY
BOMBING AND THEN THE TRIAL
OF TIMOTHY MCVEIGH WHICH
FOLLOWED, AND THERE IS NO
QUESTION THAT THE REASON
THAT THAT HAPPENED AT THAT
TIME HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE ATTACKS AT WACO
AND BEYOND.

THAT WOULD BE WHY WE ARE
HEARING THE REPORTS OF
HORRIFIC INJURIES,
INCLUDING MANY PEOPLE
LOSING THEIR LIMBS.

AND AWAY FROM US BUT
IMMEDIATELY I JUST THOUGHT
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WAS
MOTHER'S INSTINCT IS WHAT
CAN I DO TO GET MY KIDS OUT
OF HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE
SEVEN AND NINE AND DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO AND THE
SITUATION LIKE THIS.

TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF
MILITARY PERSONNEL STAGED
OVER THERE.

IT'S BEING USED AS STAGING
GROUND.

OR EVEN WHETHER IT IS A MAN
OR A WOMAN AT THIS POINT.

IN TERMS OF THE DEAD, WE
HAVE TWO CONFIRMED AND THE
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE NEWS
TONIGHT THAT WE ARE GETTING
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE
CONFIRMED DEAD IS AN
8-YEAR-OLD BOY SHEP.

SHUT DOWN.

AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE ARE
CONFIRMED DEAD, 70 HURT
AFTER TWO BOMBS EXPLODED AT
THE FINISH LINE OF THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

SECURITY IS EXTREMELY
TIGHT.

IT JUST KIND OF EXPLODED
ALL OUR EARDRUMS, TOO.

THE FIRE STARTED ACTUALLY
JUST AFTER 300 P.M.
