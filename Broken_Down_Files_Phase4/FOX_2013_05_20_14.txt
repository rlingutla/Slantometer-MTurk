THIS TORNADO SITUATION IS
STILL VERY ACTIVE THERE ARE
V. BEEN WARNING ALL
AFTERNOON AND THERE STILL
ARE JANICE DEAN IN OUR
WEATHER SERVICE.

TOUCHES EVERYONE.

OUT OF OKLAHOMA CITY IN THE
TOWN OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

SHEPARD BACK TO YOU.

YOU HAVE TWO YOUNG ONES
SITTING OVER HERE.

THEY DON'T WANT THE NEWS
CHOPPERS UP BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR IF
SOMEONE IS, PERHAPS
INJURED AND THEY ARE
YELLING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH
THE RUBBLE THE FIRST
RESPONDERS CLEARLY WANT TO
HEAR THEM THIS IS VERY MUCH
A SEARCH AND RESCUE
SITUATION RIGHT NOW AND
HARD TELLING HOW LONG IT'S
GOING TO LAST, SHEPARD.

GRINDING UP NEIGHBORHOODS
AND RAVAGING AT LEAST ONE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN ITS
PATH.

GOING APPEAR WHAT APPEARED
TO BE WIDE OPEN SPACES.

PEOPLE GETTING GAS GO
INSIDE TO GRAB A COLD SODA.

WHEN I GOT HOME I REALIZED
THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT
OF MY HOUSE.

THE TRUTH IS, THEY WON'T BE
ABLE TO GET THEIR HANDLE ON
THIS AT LEAST UNTIL SOME
TIME TOMORROW BECAUSE THE
COMMUNICATIONS ARE SO BAD.

THE HOUSE IS COMPLETELY
GONE.

IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY GIVES
YOU THE SHIVERS AND TO SIT
HERE RIGHT NOW.

THERE ARE NO WORDS.

CLOUD CEILING LOWERED AND
LOWERED.

BOTH IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES
AS WELL AS THE RESIDENTIAL
AREAS.

MANY RAN TOWARD THESE TWO
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS BRIAR
WOOD ELEMENTARY AND THE
OTHER ESCAPES ME AT THE
MOMENT WITHOUT NOTES IN
FRONT OF ME TO TRY TO JUST
SAVE THEIR NEIGHBORS.

OUR COVERAGE CONTINUES
AFTER THIS.

OUR CASEY STEGALL IS NEAR
THIS SPOT AT A LOCAL 7/11
STORE WHERE FOUR PEOPLE
DIED THIS AFTERNOON DURING
THE STORM ACCORDING TO
THOSE HE HAS INTERVIEWED
WITH AND HE IS HE WITH US
NOW.

LIKE CLEAR CUTTING A
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE CLEAR
CUTTING TREES WHERE HOUSES
COULD REPLACE THEM.
