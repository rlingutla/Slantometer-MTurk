YOU HEARD GINGER IN THE FIELD
WALKING AROUND THERE AND WE
HEARD REPORTS THAT SOME OF THE
FOUNDATIONS WERE COMPLETELY
CLEARED.

THERE ARE SOME REPORTS IT WAS ON
THE GROUND FOR 40 MINUTES,
COVERING 12 MILES IN THAT TIME.

IT'S JUST RIPPING UP EVERYTHING
IN ITS PATH.

HAIL THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS
POUNDING MY CAR AT THE TIME.

A MASSIVE TORNADO, MORE THAN A
MILE WIDE, TEARS THROUGH
OKLAHOMA ON LIVE TV.

I KNOW THAT TWO OF THE 37 WERE
FROM THAT SCHOOL.

HIS TEACHER WAS RIGHT NEXT TO
HIM.

YOU SING AND YOU READ TO MAKE
THEM NOT CRY OR BE SCARED OR
UPSET ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

AND THE TORNADO CAME, AND IT
PASSED.

AND I'M REALLY SCARED TO SEE
WHAT MY HOUSE LOOKS LIKE.

AND SADLY, THEY FOUND A MAN
AND THEN A WOMAN AND A SMALL
BABY.

THEY WERE TELLING STORIES AND
APPARENTLY THEY GOT INTO
POSITION, AND THE TEACHER HELD
THEIR HEADS, AND BRICKS AND
EVERYTHING WERE FALLING ALL OVER
THE KIDS.

ARE YOU STILL SEEING PEOPLE
DIGGING THROUGH THEIR HOMES?

IT'S ALMOST SICKENING WHEN
YOU'RE STANDING THERE.

THE DAMAGE IS OVERWHELMING.

TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS MASSIVE
TELL YOU, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE
SIGHT.

ALL THE REPORTS WERE SAYING THAT
BRIARWOOD WAS GOING.

SHE STILL HADN'T FOUND HER.

WELL, WE DO RUN THE BUSIEST
ER IN THE STATE, SO WE ARE
ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH VOLUME.

WE RECEIVED A TOTAL OF FIVE
CHILDREN OF THOSE 37.
