THEY COULD PAY OFF THE TRY
ADDS OR ANY OF THEIR AGENTS
OR ASSETS.

FOX NEWS CONFIRMING THAT
TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE FULL
HOUSE WILL BE BRIEFED BY
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
JAMES KOHL, DEPUTY FBI
DIRECTOR SEAN JOYCE AND
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE NSA
CHRIS INGLIS ON THE
PROGRAMS.

GIVEN THE RECENT
REVELATIONS THAT FOX NEWS
JAMES ROSEN AND OTHERS WERE
TARGETED BY THE DOJ AND
CONSERVATIVE GROUPS WERE
TARGETED BY THE IRS, MANY
AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND THE SEARCH
ENGINES WE ALL USE.

HIDING OVERSEAS AND LOOKING
FOR ASYLUM.

IT'S NOT THERE ARE
CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AND THE CHINESE PRC
GOVERNMENT BUT THE PEOPLES
INHERENTLY, WE DON'T CARE.

WE HAVE OUR INTEL
COMMITTEE THAT GETS BRIEFED
BUT THE FULL CONGRESS DOES
NOT.

ANALYSTS SAY THAT MAY NOT
BE THE WHOLE STORY.

THERE WAS ANOTHER REPORT IN
THE "THE WASHINGTON POST"
TODAY THAT A RECEPTION AT
THE MIRROR HOTEL ALSO SAID
THAT SOMEBODY BY THE NAME
OF EDWARD SNOWDEN HAD BEEN
THERE AND CHECKED OUT
EARLIER TODAY ALL OF WHICH
FITS IN WHAT SNOWDEN
HIMSELF SAID HE IS LIKELY
TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS
LIFE AS A FUGITIVE.

I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS
MAN AS AN AMERICAN HERO, AS
A PERSON REALLY TO RISK
LIFE, LIMB AND LIBERTY IN
ORDER TO EXPOSE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ONE OF THE
MOST EXTRAORDINARY
VIOLATIONS OF AMERICAN
PRINCIPLE VALUE JUDGMENTS
AND CONSTITUTION ITSELF IN
ALL OF OUR HISTORY.

THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
REQUESTED TO BE BRIEFED
TOMORROW.

EMAILS BOTH IN THE SYSTEM
AND OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS
THAT HE SPENT SOME TIME AT
THE W HOTEL IN HONG KONG.

TELLS THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER THE FEDS OWE THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AN
EXPLANATION.

BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS
MONDAY NIGHT HE SAYS HE
HAD THE POWER TO WIRETAP
EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HE
WANTS AMERICANS TO KNOW HOW
MUCH POWER OUR SPY AGENCIES
HAVE TO KEEP TABS ON EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF US.

CONSERVATIVE AND TEA PARTY
FAVORITE ALSO POSITIONING
FOR A 2016 PRESIDENTIAL
RUN.

WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS
COMING DOWN FROM NSA,
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE
FBI TO WALK THROUGH THE
ENTIRE CONGRESS MEMBERS
WHAT IS GOING ON.

ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHDOG
SAYS THERE IS HUGE
POTENTIAL FOR DATA MINING
OF POLITICAL OPPONENTS.

SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE
ACTUALLY ABUSES.

MAYBE IN ICELAND THE HOME
BASE OF WIKILEAKS.

THEY ARE NOT REAL
SENTIMENTAL ABOUT STUFF
LIKE THAT.
