WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG
NIGHT.

MY MOM WAS FLIPPING OUT.

IT WAS JUST THE STORM THAT DID
THAT DAMAGE.

HOUSES GROUND TO SPLINTERS.

THERE WAS ONLY SIX KIDS.

FROM THE SKY, YOU CAN SEE IT'S
HOUSE AFTER HOUSE AFTER HOUSE IN
NEIGHBORHOODS.

CAN YOU TELL ME, IN THAT
CLOSET, WHAT WAS YOUR TEACHER
TELLING YOU AS SHE PUT HER HANDS
OVER YOUR HEAD AND HELD YOU
CLOSE?

UM, WELL, I WAS IN MY
BUILDING.

THEN YOU LOOK AT MAJOR
CONSTRUCTION.

QUITE A TEACHER, QUITE A
WOMAN.

AS THOSE FIRES ERUPED.

AT LEAST 100 INJURED OR BEING
FREETED IN HOSPITALS.

SOME HOMES COMPLETELY GONE.

AND TONIGHT AN OUTBREAK OF
MORE THAN 50 TWISTERS HAS TAKEN
LIVES AND FLATTENED HOMES.

BY THE DESTRUCTIVE TORNADO THAT
WREAKED HAVOC FOR ALMOST AN
HOUR.

THERE ARE TWO BY FOURS GOING
THROUGH PEOPLE'S ROOFS LIKE
PROJECTILE OBJECTS.

BASICALLY JUST A WAR ZONE.

SHE SAID IT WAS JUST OKAY.

THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT SAY
ON THE GROUND, THIS TORNADO WAS
ABOUT TWO MILES WIDE.

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT STREET WAS
TURNING ON TO WALK TO MY HOUSE.
