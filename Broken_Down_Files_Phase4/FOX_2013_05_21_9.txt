AND HELP THEM A LITTLE BIT.

IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, THIS IS
WHERE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE
DROPPING OFF SUPPLIES.

HE SAID HE WANTED TO HANG
THAT FLAG THERE AS A
REMINDER THAT NEIGHBORS ARE
HELPING THY NEIGHBOR AND
THIS COMMUNITY WILL
REBUILD.

AND OVER HERE, AN AMERICAN
FLAG IS UP.

BUT, FIRST SHEAR LOOK AT
SOME OF WHAT I SAW EARLIER
TODAY JUST AFTER WE LANDED
IN MOORE OKLAHOMA.

ALL ROUTINES ARE OUT THE
DOOR.

WHEN THE WIND STARTED
BLASTING IN THEIR
DIRECTION.

WERE YOU?

I WAS ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY
AND RUSHING TO GET THERE.

A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST
VERY SAD.

I KNOW HELLO KITTY IS MUCH
MORE INTERESTING THAN ME.

IF YOU WANT TO GO TO GO TO
SAFE AND WELL.ORG.

MUCH MORE AHEAD FROM
OKLAHOMA.

WE'RE ALSO LEARNING A
LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL
IN BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY
FROM AN A.P.

WE WILL BE THERE FOR A
WHILE UNTIL I FIGURE
EVERYTHING OUT.

MANY MORE WERE INJURED.

AFTER YESTERDAY'S TORNADO,
A PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK A
PICTURE NEAR THE PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
AND TODAY IT APPEARS ON THE
COVERS OF NEWSPAPERS FROM
CALIFORNIA TO FLORIDA AND
BEYOND.

FIRST RESPONDERS TO COMFORT
AND OF COURSE FRIGHTENED
CHILDREN WHO WILL NEED OUR
CONTINUED LOVE AND
ATTENTION.

FOLKS TRYING TO HELP OUT
ANY WAY THEY CAN.

GOOD LUCK TO YOU GUYS.
