ANY RESPONSIBLE
INDIVIDUALS, ANY
RESPONSIBLE GROUPS WILL
FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF
JUSTICE.

OFFICIAL NUMBERS ARE AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN AND
HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT THE
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

AND, I HUNG AROUND FOR A
FEW MOMENTS TO SEE IF I
COULD DO ANYTHING.

REMEMBER, WHEN THEY LOOK AT
THESE THINGS, THEY TEND TO
SEE WHAT THEY CALL A
SIGNATURE OF A BOMB MAKER.

THAT'S RIGHT.

SECURITY IN OTHER MAJOR
CITIES AS WELL.

THESE ARE BAGS OF PERSONAL
POSSESSIONS THAT BELONG TO
EACH OF THE THEY'RE NONE
RUNNERS.

THE POLICE DISPATCH AS THE
FIRST DESCRIBE THE HORROR.

THEY GOT PEOPLE TO THOSE
HOSPITALS WHICH WE HOPE
WILL RESULT IN VERY FEW
NUMBERS OF LOSS OF LIFE.

IF THEIR GONNA HAVE
HEARINGS ON THE HILL AS
EARLY AS TOMORROW MORNING
FOR CLARITY, IS IT PROPER
TO SAY THAT IN THE EARLY
GOING, FROM YOUR REPORTING
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS
WAS SOME SORT OF TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION --
 -- THAT'S CORRECT.

SPOT WE ARE WAITING FOR THE
NEWS CONFERENCE.

WHOEVER PLANTED THOSE
BOMBS, WITHOUT ANY QUESTION
KNEW THAT ON THE PHONE WITH
US NOW THE RUNNER DEMI
CLARK, SHE WAS RUNNING THE
MARATHON, SAYS SHE WAS JUST
CROSSING THE FINISH LINE AS
THE BOMB BLAST ROCKED THE
STREET.

OF COURSE, IF IT'S SOMEONE
YOU KNOW, THE NUMBER IS
ALREADY WAY TOO HIGH.

ED, WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU
AS UPDATES WARRANT
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

IT'S A DAY THAT CELEBRATES
THE FREE AND FIERCELY
INDEPENDENT SPIRIT THAT
THIS GREAT AMERICAN CITY OF
BOSTON HAS REFLECTED FROM
THE EARLIEST DAYS OF OUR
NATION.

CHILDREN ABOUT HALF A DOZEN
WE ARE HEARING AT THE
MOMENT AMONGS INJURED AS I
SAY ONE 8-YEAR-OLD BOY
CONFIRMED DEAD TONIGHT
YOU.

BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING HERE, YES THEY
WILL BE TELLING ME THE
QUARTERBACK OF THIS
INVESTIGATION COORDINATING
IT INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE
AGAINST COORDINATING THE
FACT THAT YOU HAVE GOT THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE
FBI INVOLVED AND THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY ON THE FEDERAL
LEVEL NOT TO MENTION THE
FACT THAT YOU HAVE HAVE
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW
ENFORCEMENT AS WELL.

AREA BEHIND YOU ON THIS
LIVE SHOT, I KNOW A LITTLE
BIT OF THAT AREA, NOT WELL.

THOUSANDS PACKING THE
STREETS ON A HOLIDAY THERE.

ARE YOU SAFE?
