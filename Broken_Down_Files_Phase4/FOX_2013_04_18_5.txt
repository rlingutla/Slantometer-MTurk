ALL OF THIS SHORTLY BEFORE
THE DEADLY BLAST WENT OFF.

TERRY, THANK YOU.

ABOUT D. THESE PEOPLE STAY
WITH YOU IN A ROOM.

CATHERINE, IN SOME OF THESE
IMAGES, IT'S CLEAR THAT AT
LEAST SUSPECT NUMBER 2 IS
TALKING ON A PHONE.

TERRY TURCHIE FORMER
COUNTER TERRORISM DIRECTOR
OF THE FBI.

WHAT THIS GUY DID THREE
LIVES LOST AND HORRIFIC
INJURIES BILL.

NOW TURNING UP IN THE
IMAGES THAT THE FBI HAS
RELEASED.

THEY WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT
TELLS YOU IT MAY MEAN THAT
THEY HAVE HAD HELP IN
STAYING AT LARGE.

THE WORD OF CAUTION YOU
KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE
KILLED THUS FAR.

IF YOU ARE A BUS DRIVER, IF
YOU RENT CARS, IF YOU WORK
AT A GAS STATION OR A
COFFEE SHOP, WE KNOW THAT
THEODORE KOSINSKI GOT ON A
BUS WITH UNSTABLE BOMBS AND
WENT FROM POINT A TO POINT
B.
ERIC RUDOLPH TOOK HIS CAR
AND LEFT THE SCENE OF THE
CRIME.

THAT THE BLESSING WE HAVE
WITH THE PROLIFERATION WITH
CAMERAS, SECURITY CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE NOW IS THAT YOU
DO GET VERY GOOD IMAGES OF
THESE PEOPLE.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS
HOW CRITICAL AND VITAL AT
THIS POINT IN THE
INVESTIGATION THESE IMAG
AND THE VIDEO AND HOW VITAL
THEY CAN
 YOU ARE RIGHT BILL.

ALSO, THIS IS COMING ON AN
ENORMOUSLY BUSY NEWS DAY
HERE IN BOSTON.

HAVE YOU BEEN THERE SINCE
THE BEGINNING LIKE THE
ENERGIZER BUNNY.

AND I KNOW THAT THERE IS A
LOT OF CONSTERNATION OVER
WHY NOW OR WHATEVER.

BECAUSE THE FBI SAID THAT
COMMENT TONIGHT ABOUT
SUSPECT NUMBER 2.

WHAT DO YOU RECALL BASED ON
THAT CONVERSATION NOW?

BUT ANY TERRORIST BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT THESE TWO
PEOPLE ARE WORTH THEIR
SAWLTD SALT, IF THEY ARE
USING CELL PHONES FOR
DETONATION WOULD BE USING
DISPOSABLE CELL PHONES THAT
THEY PURCHASED AT
CONVENIENCE STORE.

HUGE DEVELOPMENT IN THE
INVESTIGATION OF THE BOSTON
MARATHON BOMBING.

AND HEAR WHAT HE THINKS OF
TODAY'S LATEST DEVELOPMENTS
AND THE EFFORTS TO CATCH
THESE TWO MEN.
