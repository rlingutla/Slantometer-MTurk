CONTINUING COVERAGE OF BREAKING
NEWS, WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE
FIRST IMAGE OR THE FIRST SERIES
OF IMAGES OF ONE OF THE BOMBS
THAT EXPLODED AT THE BOSTON
MARATHON HERE YESTERDAY.

YOU MAY SEE MORE BOMB
DETECTION DOGS THAT WILL BE
SNIFFING THROUGH THE CROWD.

SELFISHLY, COMPASSIONATELY AND
WORLD ARE INCREASING SECURITY AT
PUBLIC PLACES AND LANDMARKS, BUT
THERE ARE SOME MAJOR EVENTS ON
THE HORIZON INCLUDING 30
DIFFERENT MARATHONS.

AS BELLS TOLL HERE.

NOT TO TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM
DALE RUSSELL BUT JUST WAY OF
THEORY, THEY MAY HAVE SENT TO
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN
GEORGIA.

EXHAUSTED RUNNERS THAT KEPT
RUNNING TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL
TO GIVE BLOOD AND THOSE THAT
STAYED TO ATTEND TO THE WOUNDED.

I RAN DOWN THE STAIRS AND I RAN
ON TO A CARPET OF GLASS AND
BLOOD STREAKS.

BY JOE MANCHIN AND PATRICK
TOOMEY.

FIRST REPORTS FROM BOSTON, THERE
MAY HAVE BEEN ONE IMAGE TO SHOW
THE NATION HOW HORRIBLE IT
REALLY WAS.

SHE WAS HYSTERICAL, AS HE PUT IT
UNTIL AN ARMY SERGEANT, AFGHAN
VETERAN CALMED HER DOWN.

IT'S ONE THING FOR THE SECURITY
FORCES THERE AS THEY DID
SUCCESSFULLY DURING THE OLYMPICS
LAST YEAR TO SECURE INDIVIDUAL
VENUES BUT WHEN YOU AN OPEN
COURSE LIKE THIS AS EVERY
SECURITY EXPERT WILL TELL YOU,
COMPLETE AND UTTER SECURITY IS
WELL IMPOSSIBLE.

POLICE ARE OUT IN FULL FORCE AND
BOSTON AND D.C. AND OTHER MAJOR
CITIES.

THE SECTION IN BOSTON WHERE THE
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD MARTIN RICHARD
THAT WAS KILLED IN THE BOMB
ATTACK LIVED.

THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT A HAS
TO BE ANSWERED.

WE SAW TWO COMPELLING PHOTOS
FROM BOSTON AFFILIATE WHAT MAY
BE THE SECOND BOMB THAT WENT
OFF.

SO MUCH SO THEY NO LONGER NEED
BLOOD FOR THE IMMEDIATE TIME.

THE BOSTON BOMBINGS FORCED
THE CANCELLATION OF A JOINT NEWS
CONFERENCE WITH GABRIELLE
GIFFORDS AND TWO SENATORS BEHIND
A BARREN BACKGROUND CHECK
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR
BACKGROUND CHECKS.

THERE WAS A SECOND ONE.

THEY'VE GOT ALL THIS EVIDENCE
TOGETHER AND ALL THIS
EXPERIENCE.

FROM THE JOURNALISTS FROM FOX
NEWS, AS NEWS BROKE THAT PIECES
OF THE BOMB THAT EXPLODED THERE
ARE NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE
F.B.I.
