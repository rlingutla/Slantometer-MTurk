IT'S A MILE RIGHT THERE.

THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND
OBVIOUSLY A BIG THING THEY NEED
TO ADDRESS.

I SAID, GOD PLEASE DON'T TAKE
DOWN ON THEM, BUT THE WALLS
STILL STOOD.

THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE DOTTED
WITH TREES, SWIMMING POOLS AND
CUL-DE-SACS NOW COMPLETELY
OBLITERATED, UNRECOGNIZABLE.

FOREVER.

WHEN IT WAS QUIET AGAIN, SHE
SENT A SMALL BOY TO CLIMB UP THE
BATHROOM WALL AND LOOK OUT.

REMINISCENT OF THAT TAKEN BY A
RECORD-SETTING TORNADO THAT HIT
HERE 14 YEARS AGO.

OH, MY GOD!

SOME CHILDREN HAD ESCAPED FROM
HARM.

WELL, I DEFINITELY THINK
EVERY SCHOOL IN
OKLAHOMA SHOULD HAVE AN
UNDERGROUND SHELTER.

THIS IS A WORKING CLASS TOWN.

ALL THE NEW SCHOOLS THAT ARE
BUILT HAVE SAFE ROOMS.

WELL, WE'RE HAPPY TO WELCOME
MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE WITH US
TONIGHT.

WE SHOULD PROBABLY -- FOR
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY EMPHASIZE IN PLAIN
ENGLISH, NOT A WHOLE LOT OF
PEOPLE GETTING RICH HERE.

THE MOORE MEDICAL CENTER, WHERE
PATIENTS WERE EVACUATED, NOW
LOOKS LIKE THIS.

A LOT OF US WOKE UP THIS MORNING
TO SEE IT DOWNGRADED TO 24.

WE GOT THIS VIDEO IN TODAY OF
THE INCEPTION OF THE TORNADO.

WORTH METROPLEX
WILL AVOID THE WORST OF THE
SEVERE WEATHER.

WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.

THIS IS THE FRONT OF PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
