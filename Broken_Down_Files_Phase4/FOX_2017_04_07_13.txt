IT IS TIME FOR ALL CIVILIZED
NATIONS TO STOP THE HORRORS THAT
ARE TAKING PLACE IN SYRIA AND
DEMAND A POLITICAL SOLUTION.

WHAT DO WE KNOW?

HE NEVER TOLD THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC WHY SYRIA IS IN AMERICA'S
NATIONAL INTEREST.

WE COULD SEE MORE OF IT.

HE HAS TO THINK HARD ABOUT THAT.

IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO USE
WMD, WE'LL TAKE DOWN THOSE OTHER
FIVE AIR FIELDS AND MAKE CERTAIN
THAT ALL OF HIS AIRCRAFT ARE
GROUNDED PERMANENTLY.

WE'LL HAVE LAWMAKERS LIVE HERE
TO DISCUSSION THEIR REACTIONS
AND HOW THIS COULD UNFOLD.

IT WILL TAKE SOME WORK.

THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT OBAMA COULD
GET AN AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF
MILITARY FORCE.

SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL
OF OUR ALLIES IN THE GULF STATES
ARE THERE AS WELL AS OUR
EUROPEAN ALLIES AND ALLIES
AROUND THE WORLD.

HAVING TO WEIGHT OF COMMAND ON
HIS SHOULDERS, NOW HE'S
PRESIDENT PLAYED A LOT INTO IT.

COME TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC,
COME TO CONGRESS FOR
AUTHORIZATION IF HE DECIDES TO
DO SOMETHING MORE ROBUST.

HAS A RIGHT TO BE THERE.

AMBASSADOR HAVE TAKEN ON RUSSIA
AND TALKED ABOUT THEIR
INVOLVEMENT AND COMPLICITY WITH
THE AL-ASSAD REGIME AND ATTACKS
ON CIVILIANS, A DRAMATIC
TURN-AROUND IN TRUMP FOREIGN
POLICY THIS WEEK.

IT'S A BUSY NEWS DAY.

IN THE YELLOW OVER HERE, THOSE
ARE DESCRIBED AS DOUBLE HASHENED
AIR CRAFT HANGERS.

SHOULD HAVE BEEN SWIFT AND
DECISIVE AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY
MADE A DIFFERENCE.

LET'S WATCH THE COLORS.

MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA.

EXPECT TO SEE INVOLVED NOW?
