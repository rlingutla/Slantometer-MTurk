THE IMAGES ARE VERY CLEAR
THAT THEY HAVE DISPLAYED.

AND IT'S FAST MOVING
BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC'S
HELP.

BOTH SUSPECTS ARE PERHAPS
THE MOST WANTED MEN IN
AMERICA.

I WANT YOU TO TAKE ME AND
OUR VIEWERS NEED THE FBI'S
INVESTIGATION NOW.

LONE WOLVES, DOMESTIC
EXTREMISTS AND I JIHAD
INSPIRED GROUPS.

WE HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE OF
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 LEAVING A
BACKPACK AT THE SCENE OF
HIS SECOND EXPLOSION YOU
THINK ABOUT THE COMMENT AND
WHERE THE PRESS CONFERENCE
STARTED.

AND NOW THE OFFICIALS
ASKING FOR YOUR
IDENTIFYING THEM.

THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR
THEM TO LOOK AT THE FILM
AGAIN IF THEY HAD ANYTHING.

WERE THESE PEOPLE PART OF
THE CONSPIRACY OR WAS --
WERE THEY SORT OF
UNWITTINGLY HELPING THESE
INDIVIDUALS, BILL?

WE SPOKE 11 HOURS AGO IN
AMERICA'S NEWSROOM ABOUT
WHAT COULD COME NEXT FROM
THE FBI.

LONG TIME SINGER STARTED
BUT THE FANS HANDLED THE
REST.

ESSENTIALLY, RICK, THAT WAS
AN APPEAL TO FAMILY OR
FRIENDS THAT YOU MAY KNOW
THESE INDIVIDUALS BUT WE
NEED TO KNOW WHO THEY'RE
AND DON'T HOLD BACK.

IN OTHER WORDS WERE THERE
PHONE CALLS GOING THROUGH
CELL PHONE TOWERS AT THE
VERY MOMENTS THAT THEY KNOW
THE BOMBS WERE BEING
DETONATED, THEY CAN USE
THAT INFORMATION TO TRACE
IT BACK TO A PHONE NUMBER.

IT CONTINUES TO BE AN
ONGOING ACTIVE
INVESTIGATION.

THE STATE COULD CHARGE,
MURDER CHARGES UP TO 200
ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES
BUT, REMEMBER,
MASSACHUSETTS ABOLISHED THE
DEATH PENALTY IN 1984, SO
ONLY THE FEDS CAN SEEK
DEATH.

WE NOW HAVE PICTURES OF TWO
SUSPECTS AND THE TERROR
ATTACK AT THE BOSTON
MARATHON.

BILL, YOU HAVE WORKED THESE
STORIES AND BEEN IN THOSE
INVESTIGATIVE ROOMS.

LATE LAST NIGHT, RICK.

THE FBI NOW SEARCHING FOR
TWO SUSPECTS.

JUST A COUPLE HOURS AGO THE
FBI RELEASING THE
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO OFF THE
BOMBING SUSPECTS.
