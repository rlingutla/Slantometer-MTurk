A LITTLE RELIEF AND BROUGHT
A BUNCH OF HATS AND
T-SHIRTS AND SOME DRY WEAR
FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
OUT ALL DAY AND TRYING TO
PASS THEM OUT.

PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.

I HOPE EVERYTHING GOES
WELL.

AROUND 200.

AND STORIES OF PARENTS
HAVING TO MAKE UNIMAGINABLE
CHOICES.

RIGHT WHERE THEIR HOME HAD
BEEN.

YES SIR.

A DEVASTATING STORM IN
1999.

BACK IN THE STATES SHE
STARTED A U.S. BRANCH AND
LED ITS FIRST DISASTER
RELIEF PROGRAMS NOW OF
COURSE THE RED CROSS
RESPONDS TO ROUGHLY 70,000
DIFFERENT DISASTERS EACH
YEAR WITH THE HELP OF
GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS OF
TIME BLOOD AND MONEY FROM
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.

I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
THINK OF MUCH.

HE PICKS UP THE TIME LINE
FROM THERE.

I LOOKED AROUND AND I WAS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
TO TELL THEM TO GO AND I
REALIZED I WAS LOOKING IN
THE WRONG SPOT TO TELL THEM
WE WERE AT HEATHER LANE AND
SOUTHWEST SIXTH STREET.

THE DEATH TOLL HOLDING
STEADY NOW AT 24.

MAYBE SAVE THEIR LIVES.

AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THOSE
WINDS DID.

CHRIS CATHY'S FAMILY WAS IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAOS AND
DESTRUCTION.

YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

THANK YOU.

I USED TO TAKE THE BUS
ROUTE AROUND HERE AND NOW
I DON'T KNOW, JUST REALLY
SAD AND SCARY AND IT'S
GOING TO TAKE SO LONG TO
REBUILD.

IT'S SOMETHING TO SEE.
