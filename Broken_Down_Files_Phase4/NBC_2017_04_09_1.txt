DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP
WANT BETTER RELATIONS
WITH PUTIN OR MORE
MISSILE STRIKES?

A TOUGH ISSUE FOR
SECRETARY TILLERSON IN
RUSSIA THIS WEEK.

EXPECTED TO TAKE TO
RUSSIA WHERE HE WILL
MEET WITH THE FOREIGN
MINISTER THIS WEEK.

AGREEMENT, UNLIKELY.

HOW HE REACTS TO
SECRETARY TILLERSON,
THE KINDS OF SIGNALS
HE SAYS IN TERMS OF
THE FUTURE, THAT'S
WHAT WE NEED TO BE
WATCHING.

U.N. AM BASSOR NIKKI
HALEY BLASTED RUSSIA
OVER SYRIA'S CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

THE NEW TOUGH TALK
ABOUT RUSSIA AND SYRIA
AS THE SECRETARY OF
STATE LEAVES ON A
MISSION TO MOSCOW AND
ANOTHER KEY WHITE
HOUSE OFFICIALS IS
FORCED OUT.

TILLERSON MISSION TO
MOSCOW COMES AS THE
WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL
SECURITY TEAM IS
RESHAPED.

LOW-KEY SECRETARY OF
STATE IS EMERGING
WEEKS AFTER TAKING
OFFICE.

THEIR INITIAL
REACTION WAS, ASSAD
DIDN'T DO IT, THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
DIDN'T DO IT.

WHAT IS AMERICA'S
STRATEGY IN SYRIA?

OUSTED ADVISER MICHAEL
FLYNN, IS OUT, OFFERED
AN AMBASSADORSHIP.

PUTIN PROMISED THAT
RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE
WOULD STOP ASSAD'S USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

SECRETARY OF STATE
REX TILLERSON ARRIVED
IN EUROPE TONIGHT FOR
CRUCIAL AND HIGHLY
ANTICIPATED MEETINGS
WITH THE RUSSIANS.

WITH HIS OWN
ESTABLISHED TIES TO
VLADIMIR PUTIN FROM
HIS FORMER OIL
EXECUTIVE DAYS, A
PUTIN MEETING MAY ALSO
BE POSSIBLE.

RUSSIA HAS FAILED
IN THAT COMMITMENT,
AND THE RESULT OF
THEIR FAILURE HAS LED
TO THE KILLING OF MORE
CHILDREN AND
INNOCENTS.

REX TILLERSON, THE
MEDIA WARY --
 NO COMMENT.

TENSIONS COMPLICATING
THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN MOSCOW AND
WASHINGTON.

I HOPE THAT RUSSIA
IS THINKING CAREFULLY
ABOUT ITS CONTINUED
ALLIANCE WITH BASHAR
AL ASSAD.

WHAT ABOUT ASSAD?
