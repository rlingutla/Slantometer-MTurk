THEN MOVING INTO IOWA.

THE TORNADO WARNING CONTINUE
THERE'S AS WELL.

WHICH WAY ARE YOU DRIVING YOU
GOT TO GO THE OTHER WAY.

THE AIR JUST KIND OF FELT
WEIRD.

WHAT WE WILL DO RIGHT NOW IS
ZOOM DOWN.

THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THIS SENSE THURSDAY OR FRIDAY
SO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREPARING.

WHEN THAT STARTS FALLING
WHEN IT FIRST STARTS PEOPLE
LIKE TO GO OUT AND TAKE
PICTURES BUT ONCE YOU GET INTO
THE GOLF BALL AND LARGER PEOPLE
GO INSIDE AND STAY AWAY FROM
THE WINDOWS.

WHILE YOU WERE TALKING
VIEWERS SAW A VERY LARGE
TORNADO TOUCHING DOWN AND I
WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT WE
ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS BRAND
NEW VIDEO.

WE ARE WATCHING A DANGEROUS
SITUATION UNFOLD AND IT HAS
BEEN SINCE NOON TODAY.

WE KNOW IT IS ON THE GROUND AND
WE WILL STAY WITH IT OBVIOUSLY
AND WE HAVE TWO CHASERS ON THAT
RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO GET
PHONERS AND VERIFY WHAT THEY
ARE SEEING.

A TORNADO WARNING EAST OF
MINNEAPOLIS THAT HAS IS SINCE
BE LIFTED WHICH IS GREAT NEWS.

JENNIFER MONROE WITH THE
EDMOND OKLAHOMA OFFICE OF
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THERE.

WITH TOUCHDOWNS ALREADY
HAPPENING.

FROM OKLAHOMA TO KANSAS.

ANOTHER ONE JUST NORTH OF
CHANDLER.

THE DAY TIME HEATING SETTING IN
AND THEN THESE STORMS START TO
FIRE WITH THAT FRONT AS IT
APPROACHES WITH THE COOLER
DRYER AIR BEHIND IT.

WE HAVE SEEN THAT MORE THAN A
FEW TIMES THIS AFTERNOON AND
NOW MOVING INTO THE EVENING
HOURS.

ANOTHER DAY OR SO TO GO OF
THIS.

I'M WATCHING AND PEOPLE ARE
TWEETING ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW
THEY WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
YOU ARE AND I WANT TO GIVE THE
LINE A CHANCE TO CLEAR UP
BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A MOVING
VEHICLE AND SOMETIMES AS YOU
ARE MOVING ACROSS YOU WILL FIND
A STRONGER TOWER TO HOOK UP TO
SO I WANT TO GIVE IT A FEW
SECONDS TO DO THAT.

IT HAS JUST BEEN A VICIOUS
THUNDERSTORM SYSTEM MOVING
ACROSS THERE DROPPING TWISTERS
FROM THE SKY AND THIS IS LIVE
SO EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU MAY
SEE THE SATELLITE PHOTO DROP
OUT AS WE TRY TO CAPTURE THIS.
