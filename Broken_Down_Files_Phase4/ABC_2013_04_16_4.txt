IT LOOKS LIKE A BASIC DESIGN
OF AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE.

WE'RE NOT SAFE ANYWHERE.

GET ANOTHER AMBULANCE DOWN
HERE AT 755 BOYLSTON.

THIS IS WHAT I'M HEARING,
ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW
THAT FOR A FACT.

AND 29-YEAR-OLD KRYSTLE
CAMPBELL.

ACROSS NEW YORK CITY BOTH
SIGNS OF INCREASED SECURITY.

IN THE AFTERMATH, YOU CAN SEE
PEOPLE RUNNING ALONGSIDE WALKS,
CARPETED IN GLASS -- AND
VICTIMS.

FLOWERS AWAIT THEIR RETURN.

WHAT DID YOU SAY TO YOURSELF
WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS?

THE MOMENT TERROR STRIKES AT
HOME, THE NATION COILS.

HE RAN THE MARATHON, AND THEN
FACED IT AGAIN.

ALL DAY TODAY PEOPLE SHARING
PICTURES OF A LITTLE BOY NAMED
MARTIN RICHARD.

NEIGHBORS IN THIS CLOSE KNIT
COMMUNITY ARE NOW GRIEVING ALONG
WITH MARTIN'S FATHER.

TODAY BOSTON WAS CRAWLING WITH
ARMORED VEHICLES, UNIFORMED
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND OFFICERS
ARMED WITH HIGH POWERED RIFLES.

EVEN LEAVING THE CHARACTERISTIC
WHITE SMOKE.

THAT WASN'T HIS MAIN TARGET.

COAST TO COAST LAW ENFORCEMENT,
AT LOS ANGELES'S UNION STATION,
A MUSCULAR POLICE PRESENCE, AND
AND A MEASURE OF ANXIETY FELT
LIE COMMUTERS.

HIS MOTHER AND YOUNGER SISTER
WERE HURT TOO.

I THINK IF I BECOME NERVOUS
I'M GIVING IN TO SOMETHING
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME
UNDERPOWERED.

SUSPICIOUS ITEM AND PASSENGERS
FORCED TO WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE
STREET.
