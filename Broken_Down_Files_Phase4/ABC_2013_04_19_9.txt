AND YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE
HANNEBURYS?

THERE ARE 50 OR 60 OF THEM.

WHEN ALL OF THIS STARTS
HAPPENING, HOW AFRAID WERE YOU?

SO, A FEW POLICEMEN AND THEN
CAME BECAME IN DROVES, EVERYBODY
WAS COMING.

HE FIRED OFF AT THEM AND THAT
THE EXPLOSIONS THAT WERE HEARD
MIGHT HAVE BEEN STUN GRENADES.

DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION OF
THE SUSPECT, THE NEXT THING YOU
CAN EXPECT TO HAPPEN WILL BE THE
ACTIVATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S
HIGH VALUE INTERROGATION GROUP.

I HAVE BEEN TOLD PRIOR TO THIS
THAT THIS GROUP WAS ON STAND-BY
AND READY TO GO.

HE TOLD US ABOUT HOW HIS FRIENDS
BOAT AND HERE WE ARE WITH THIS .

HE'S JUST NEW TO THE WORLD AND,
SO, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NO DOUBT --
WE'VE BEEN TEXTING BACK AND
FORTH, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM
FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS, BUT YOU
KNOW, I'M JUST IMAGINING IT'S A
PRETTY STRESSFUL SITUATION TO
HAVE A BABY AND TO HAVE ALL OF
THIS GOING ON, YOU KNOW, JUST
OUTSIDE.

THIS IS WHAT YOU HEARD POLICE
SAY?

THAT THEY WENT ON WITH LIFE.

YOU CAN HEAR PEOPLE CHEERING.

ANYTHING ELSE YOU SAW OR HEARD
ABOUT THAT MOMENT?

AND A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN
ASKING, WHERE IS SHE?

WALKING, RUNNING DOWN TO THE
CORNER OF FRANKLIN, AS WELL.

THE PLAN WAS TO CHARGE HIM WITH
FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES AS
OPPOSED TO STATE MURDER CHARGES.

SO, HE GOT OUT OF THE BOAT FAST
AND CALLED THE POLICE AND THAT'S
WHEN -- THAT'S WHEN EVERYONE
ASCENDED, DESCENDED, WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO SAY, ON FRANKLIN
STREET AND RUSHED THEM RIGHT
OVER TO -- THEY'RE IN OUR HOUSE
BEING INTERVIEWED.

THAT'S PERPENDICULAR TO FRANKLIN
STREET, WHICH IS RIGHT IN FRONT
OF OUR HOUSE.

WHEN THAT SNIPER WAS PICKING OFF
PEOPLE AND PART OF THAT TERROR
IS, YOUR LIFE JUST KIND OF WENT
ON EVERY DAY, YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THESE PEOPLE WERE DOING,
YOU HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS AFTER
YOU AND IT'S -- THAT'S REALLY
THE EVERY THE ANYTHING OF
TERROR.

LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D SEE ON
TELEVISION OR A MOVIE.
