THE RUSSIANS SAY THAT BASHAR
AL-ASSAD SHOULD STAY IN POWER.

SO THE POTENTIAL FOR AN
ACCIDENT, WHICH WE ALMOST HAD IN
2015 WITH OUR MORE LIMITED AIR
STRIKES WITH THE RUSSIANS AND
STARTING WORLD WAR III WITH THEM
IS VERY HIGH.

I'M LEA GABRIELLE WITH THE
FOX REPORT.

HEZBOLLAH AND THE IRANIANS HAVE
BEEN IN ON THAT EFFORT FOR A
LONG TIME AS THE UNITED STATES
SUPPORTS THE REBELS.

I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

REGIME CHANGE.

86 PEOPLE DIED INCLUDING DOZENS
OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

TILLERSON GOES TO MOSCOW TO TRY
TO KEEP AN AVENUE OPEN ON ISSUES
THAT WE CAN WORK ON WITH THE
RUSSIANS.

NOW THE QUESTION IS, DO WE
LAUNCH WITH A COALITION THAT HAS
BEEN SUGGESTED A MILITARY STRIKE
TO REMOVE THE MURDEROUS DICTATOR
FROM THAT COUNTRY?

TODAY SENATOR RAND PAUL FROM
KENTUCKY SAID IF WE WANT TO
CARRY OUT STRIKES IN SYRIA,
THERE SHOULD BE CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL.

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED
TO STOP IT.

THE SYRIANS HAVE BEEN IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CIVIL WAR.

THAT'S THE QUESTION.

WE'VE HAD VERY BAD RESULTS.

A.B.

SO THIS CHEMICAL ATTACK
REPRESENTING A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN
THE POSITION, MUCH MORE DETAILED
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND
SECRETARY TILLERSON THAN HE
SPOKE ABOUT A WEEK AGO IN
TURKEY.

IN 2015, THE RUSSIANS WENT IN
AND OWNED THE AIR BASES.

THEY DON'T WANT TO.

OBVIOUSLY THE EVENTS THAT
HAVE OCCURRED IN SYRIA WITH THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK HERE IN
THE PAST DAY HAVE JUST I THINK
HORRIFIED ALL OF US AND BROUGHT
TO THE FRONT PAGES INTO OUR
TELEVISION SCREENS AS WELL.

THAT I HAVE THREE DIFFERENT
BASES AND MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEMS THERE.
