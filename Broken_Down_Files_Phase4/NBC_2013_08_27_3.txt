THAT SYRIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN
JORDAN.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT WILL
RELEASE SOLID EVIDENCE THAT THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ORDERED A MASS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK ON ITS
OWN PEOPLE LAST WEEK.

BUT TODAY IS ALSO MILITARY
APPRECIATION DAY, AND MANY VETS
AND THEIR FAMILIES NOW WORRY
ABOUT ALLEGED CHEMICAL ATTACKS
IN SYRIA.

WE'LL TRY TO HIT PLANES ON THE
TARMAC.

BUT IS THERE SUPPORT FOR A
MILITARY STRIKE?

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
INDICATIONS TONIGHT THAT A
U.S.-LED MILITARY STRIKE AGAINST
SYRIA COULD BE LAUNCHED BEFORE
THE END OF THE WEEK.

WHY CAN'T YOU EAT?

THE SYRIAN REGIME.

MAY WE SEE YOUR SON?

SULEMAN, A REFUGEE HIMSELF, WAS
DETERMINED TO GET HELP FOR A BOY
WHO DESPERATELY NEEDED IT.

STATES DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

AND LESTER, FAIR WARNING, THESE
LATEST PICTURES ARE VERY HARD TO
WATCH.

15 MINUTES LATER, AT THE GATES
OF DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, A
YOUNG PHYSICIAN ADMITTED
IBRAHIM, AND SOON DOCTORS WERE
GIVING HIM A CHECKUP.

THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR.

GHASTLY IMAGES OF LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

TRYING TO BRING THE TROOPS HOME
AND LET SOMEONE ELSE DEAL WITH
IT.

OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS THEY
HAVE INTELLIGENCE INTERCEPTS,
TYING THE ATTACK TO THE REGIME.

WE KNOW THAT THE REGIME
MAINTAINS CUSTODY OF THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA, AND
USES THE TYPES OF ROCKETS THAT
WERE USED TO DELIVER CHEMICAL
THE OPPOSITION DOES NOT.

WE'LL PROBABLY CRATER RUNWAYS SO
PLANES CAN'T TAKE OFF.

I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM DO
SOMETHING, BECAUSE I THINK IF WE
DON'T DO SOMETHING, IT'S GOING
TO CONTINUE.
