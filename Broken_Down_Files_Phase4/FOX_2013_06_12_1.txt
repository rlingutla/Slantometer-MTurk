THE NSA OBTAINED PHONE
RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF
INNOCENT AMERICANS WITH NO
CONNECTION TO TERRORISM.

BUT NO LONGER.

ACCEPTABLE, PREVENTS
TERRORISM WHICH IS THE CASE
THE PRESIDENT IS MAKING
ONLY 32% BUYING THAT RIGHT
NOW.

EVEN EDWARD SNOWDEN ADMITS
HE HAS NO INFORMATION AT
ALL ABOUT ANY CHINESE
MILITARY TECHNOLOGY.

IF DOZEN OF TERRORIST
EVENTS THAT THESE ARE
HELPED PREVENT.

HOW MUCH TRUST DO YOU HAVE
IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN, YOU KNOW GOING
AFTER ECONOMIC DATA AND
FINANCIAL INFORMATION, THAT
IS PART OF THE CYBER
ATTACKS.

OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
REQUESTED BILLIONS TO SPEND ON
CYBER APP AND TODAY THEY ASK THE
NSA CHIEF, HOW THE HECK DOES
THIS HAPPEN.

AND IN THIS INTERVIEW WITH
THE CHINESE NEWSPAPER HE
IS CLEARLY TRYING TO PAINT
HIMSELF AS THE GOOD GUY
HERE.

63%.

ED SNOWDEN SAYS HUNDREDS OF
THOSE HACKING TARGETS ARE
IN HONG KONG AND CHINA'S
MAINLAND INCLUDING
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND
PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

I SITTING AT MY DESK
CERTAINLY HAVE THE
AUTHORITIES TO WIRETAP
ANYONE FROM YOU OR YOUR
ACCOUNTANT TO IT A FEDERAL
JUDGE TO EVEN THE
PRESIDENT.

LOOK AT WHAT THE PUBLIC
THINKS ABOUT THAT.

WE ASKED IN THIS POLL WHAT
ABOUT ERIC HOLDER'S FUTURE?

NOW SOME SAY IT MAY BE TIME TO
LOOK AT OTHER CLEARANCES.

THE OTHER BIG STORY, OF
COURSE, THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT MONITORING
REPORTERS.

I THINK THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT WILL GO AFTER
GET A CHANCE TO QUESTION
THE HEAD OF THE NSA.

INFRASTRUCTURE
WAS OUTSOURCED ABOUT 14 YEARS
AGO TO MOVE MORE PUSH MORE OF
OUR WORK OUT TO CONTRACTORS.

BUT FIRST FROM FOX THIS
WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THE NSA
LEAKER HAS APPARENTLY
RESURFACED.

EVERY LEVEL OF SOCIETY IS
DEMANDINGLITY
AND OVERSIGHT.
