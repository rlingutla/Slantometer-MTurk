AND WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS
HERE IN LAS VEGAS TODAY, HE WAS
ALSO ASKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

AND TODAY, HE PAID ANOTHER
VISIT, WALKING INTO THAT ROOM ON
CRUTCHES.

AND HE MAY HAVE LOOKED FOR OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES.

IN THE SHADOW OF SUCH HORROR, A
MESSAGE OF SOLIDARITY.

GO THAT WAY!

JESUS CAMPOS.

JIMMY REVEALING HE KNEW SHELDON
WAS IN TROUBLE AFTER BEING SHOT
IN THE ARM AND THEN THE BULLET
PIERCING THE ABDOMEN, AS WELL.

HE WAS REALLY BRAVE AND
REALLY GOOD.

A VOTE SEEMS LIKE A LONG WAY
OFF.

THERE'S TREMENDOUS BRAVERY.

TONIGHT, FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
SOURCES TELLING ABC NEWS THEY
ARE INVESTIGATING REPORTS THAT
THE DAY BEFORE THE MASSACRE, HE
CHECKED INTO MULTIPLE HOTELS
OVERLOOKING THE CONCERT VENUE.

THIS WAY, THIS WAY, THIS WAY.

AND AT THE CANYON RIDGE
CHRISTIAN CHURCH, THOUSANDS OF
VOICES UNITING IN ONE POWERFUL
CHORUS.

AND AFTERWARD, THERE WAS ONE
MORE REUNION IN THAT SAME ROOM.

HE'S A SICK, DEMENTED MAN.

WHAT HE SAID TO DOCTORS AND
NURSES HERE, AND WHAT HE'S NOW
SAYING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.

HE'S BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS
MOTHER.

A 64-YEAR-OLD ONE-TIME
ACCOUNTANT AND IRS AGENT, WHO
CLAIMED TO BE A
MULTIMILLIONAIRE.

AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATING
WHETHER HE CHECKED INTO MULTIPLE
HOTELS ON THE EVE OF THE
SHOOTING.

THEY GAMBLED TOGETHER, PLAYING
VIDEO POKER AND THE SLOTS.
