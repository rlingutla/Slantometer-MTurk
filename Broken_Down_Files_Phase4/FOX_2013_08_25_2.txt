THAT'S WHERE WE OUGHT TO DIRECT
OUR ATTENTION.

AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW.

SHE PROBABLY COULD STAY IN
IRELAND ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE.

NOTHING OF SIGNIFICANCE ON
SYRIA IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE
UNITED NATIONS ANYWAY.

TWO LEADERS AGREE ALL OPTIONS TO
BE ON THE TABLE.

THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY
SAYS ANY BILATERAL ACTIONS THAT
BYPASSES UNITED NATIONS WOULD
HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON
SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

HOW UNUSUAL IS IT THAT THE
AMBASSADOR WOULD MISS A MEETING
LIKE THAT?

OF COURSE, HARRIS, ALL OF THE
MEN EXPRESS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT
THE ALLEGED USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

IS IT TIME TO FIRE AWAY?

TODAY, AMBASSADOR RAND ISSUED
THE FIRST OF TWO THREATS WE
HEARD, THE OTHER COMING FROM
RUSSIA, GET TO THAT IN A MOMENT.

IT COULD BE THE OPENING FOR
TERRORISTS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE
CHAOS IN SYRIA.

IN THIS CONTEXT IT WILL HAVE THE
OPPOSITE EFFECT AND CONVINCE HIM
HE HAS TO DO SOMETHING, LOB A
COUPLE CRUISE MISSILES OR MORE
INTO SYRIA TO PROVE HE HAS,
QUOTE, UNQUOTE, DONE SOMETHING.

AND THE COULD YOU TELL
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN THERE.

HUNDREDS DIED IN LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

IF THE MILITARY ADVISES, THIS
COULD DESTROY THE CHEMICAL
WEAPON STOCKPILE, I WOULD
SUPPORT THAT.

THE POPE ADDRESSED TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF WORSHIPPERS IN ST.
PETER'S SQUARE, SPEAKING ABOUT
THE TERRIBLE IMAGES SHOWING
INNOCENT CIVILIANS UNDER ATTACK.

THEY WILL BEGIN FACT-FINDING IN
SYRIA IN A FEW HOURS.

YOU PAINT SUCH DIFFERENT
SCENARIOS THERE.

WHILE I THINK WE OUGHT TO
DISREGARD IT, I THINK THE
RUSSIANS KNOW THE PRESIDENT'S
PSYCHOLOGY AND THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE TRYING TO EFFECT.

JUST YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT
SPENT MORE THAN 40 MINUTES
SPEAKING WITH THE BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER DAVID CAMERON.
