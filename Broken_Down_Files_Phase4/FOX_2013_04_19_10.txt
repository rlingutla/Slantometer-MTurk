WEAVE KNOW THEY HAVE A
ROBOT GOING INTO THIS BOAT
ON THE TRAILER TO CHECK IT
OUT IN THE BACKYARD TO MAKE
SURE THERE ARE NO
EXPLOSIVES.

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON.

AND PERHAPS HE WAS HIDING
IN THERE.

YEAH.

AND THEN A COUPLE MINUTES
WENT BY.

YOU WOULD OFTEN TIMES SEE
THE POLICE VEHICLES ZOOM   ING
IN ONE DIRECTION AND THEN
ANOTHER.

ARE YOU SAYING YOU ARE
HEARING TWO OR THREE BASS
SHOOTING HAPPENING NOW.

LIVE LOOK AT FRANKLIN
STREET IN WATERTOWN WHERE
MOMENTS AGO THERE WAS SOME
TYPE OF POLICE ACTIVITY OFF
THE CHARTS TO ACCORDING TO
ONE OF THE PEOPLE THERE WHO
SAID ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE
AS YOU MENTIONED.

HELICOPTERS ARE FLYING
OVERHEAD.

AGAIN, THIS IS ACCORDING TO
A STATE POLICE SOURCE THAT
I HAVE DEVELOPED THROUGH MY
TIME HERE IS TELLING ME
THAT THE SUSPECT IS DOWN.

MULTIPLE SHOTS.

A BOAT, INSIDE THE BOAT THE
SUSPECT.

THIS COMES ABOUT 40 MINUTES
AFTER A PRESS CONFERENCE
WHERE THEY SAID THEY DID
NOT HAVE A SUSPECT.

MIKE, IT'S MY STANDING THAT
THE SCENE JUST WAS OVERRUN
IN A MATTER OF JUST A
COUPLE OF MINUTES.

THIS IS FROM OUR JUSTICE
PRODUCER MICHAEL LAVIGNE.

WE WALKED UP.

A LOT OF RESIDENTS
COMING OUT OF THEIR HOUSE
TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH
AIR AFTER THE GOVERNOR
LIFTED THAT STAY-AT-HOME
BAN.

SOME 20 TO 30 GUNSHOTS.

IF IT IS, IN FACT,
POTENTIALLY SUSPECT NUMBER
2.

SO SO MANY PEOPLE CAME OUT
TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH
AIR AND AS SOON AS THEY
WALKED OUTSIDE THEY HEARD
SOME 20 TO 30 GUNSHOTS
FIRED IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
