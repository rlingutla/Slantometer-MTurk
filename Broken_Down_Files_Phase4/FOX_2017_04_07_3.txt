THEY HAVE SOLIDIFIED THEIR
POSITION IN WESTERN SYRIA.

I'M TOLD BY A TOP U.S. OFFICIAL,
THERE'S QUITE A SPLIT INSIDE THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THAT
GENERAL MATTIS, SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE IS ONE OF THE HAWKS ON
THIS.

I'LL SPEAK WITH CHRIS WALLACE
ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT.

THAT ALLOW AS CERTAIN RESPONSE.

RUSSIA DOES NOT WANT TO GO TO
WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.

WHICH INCLUDES MAKING SURE THAT
THOSE THAT ARE PROPERLY VETTED
AND THOSE THAT FOR SAFETY, KIDS
AND WOMEN AND ET CETERA, THOSE
PROPERLY VETTED AS THEY'RE GOING
TO GERMANY, WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.

THE RED DOTS HERE AGAINST THESE
ROADS, THEY'RE DEFENSE AND
CONTROL SYSTEMS.

AGAIN, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE
WORLD DIDN'T RESPONSE.

ARBITRARILY, DETERMINE THAT
WE'RE GOING TO STOP THOSE THAT
HAD BEEN VETTEDED FOR TWO YEARS
AND MAKE THE DETERMINATION AND
MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE HELPED US
IN THE WAR.

ONE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
WILLING TO GO IT ALONE.

MATTIS IS ONE OF THE HAWKS IN
THIS REGARD AND STEVE BANNON,
ONE OF THE AMERICAN FIRSTERS AND
WHO IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE PUSHING
DURING THE CAMPAIGN THE IDEA
THAT WE SHOULDN'T GET INVOLVED
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, WE SHOULD
BE LOOKING TO THIS COUNTRY, HAS
BEEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE PUSHING
FOR RESTRAINT, SEEMS THAT IN HIS
DECISION YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT
TRUMP TOOK THE KIND OF HALF
STEP.

I'M TOLD THE PRESIDENT IS VERY
PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE ATTACK
WAS CARRIED OUT, PRAISING THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE MILITARY
AMONG MEMBERS OF HIS STAFF AND
AS WELL, VERY HAPPY WITH THE
GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THIS, WHICH
MANY OF AMERICA'S ALLIES AND
MOST OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES OF
REGION OFFERING WORDS FOR
SUPPORT FOR THE ACTION TAKEN IN
NOT SUPPORTING THIS IS RUSSIA.

WE'RE PREPARED TO DO MORE.

ABOUT 20 SYRIAN AIRCRAFT WERE
DESTROYED AT THE BASE, SHEP.

HE'S A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE
AND RANKING MEMBER OF THE
EUROPE, EURASIA SUBCOMMITTEE.

WAS THE FIRST ONE
THAT THEY BOMBED WITH THEIR AIR
CAMPAIGN.

YES, THEY FIRED 59 CRUISE
MISSILES BUT IT'S ALL AT ONE AIR
BASE AS GENERAL KEANE MENTIONED.

WELL, MILITARILY SPEAKING,
MOST OF US WOULD AGREE.

PRESIDENT DO THE RIGHT THING
LAST NIGHT?

LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES ARE
CRITICIZING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DECISION TO STRIKE IN SYRIA
WITHOUT FIRST GOING TO CONGRESS.
