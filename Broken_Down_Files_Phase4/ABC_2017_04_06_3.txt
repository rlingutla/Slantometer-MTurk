MANY OF THE VICTIMS STRUGGLING
TO BREATHE.

THEY CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH A
TEN-FOOT BLOCK OF THAT BUILDING,
SO RIGHT INTO A PARTICULAR
OFFICE.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO STRIKE IN
A WAY THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED
TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE, YOU'D
HAVE TO HIT SOME PART OF UNIT
450.

IF MILITARY ACTION IS TAKEN
THERE WILL BE A WARNING TO
ASSAD -- DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR
THOSE AMERICAN TROOPS, DO NOT
TARGET THEM, BUT THERE'S A RISK.

AND AS YOU HEARD MARTHA
REPORT, ANY ACTION IF TAKEN
COMES WITH GREAT RISK.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND POSSIBLE
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.

AND HE'S THERE AND I GUESS HE'S
RUNNING THINGS, SO SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
HAPPEN.

I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN
SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

JUST 24 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID HIS MIND HAD BEEN
CHANGED ON SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL
ASSAD.

WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
SUGGESTED SOMETHING FAR
DIFFERENT, SAYING THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO
GET RID OF ASSAD.

PLAN IN 2013 INCLUDED SYRIAN
AIRFIELDS, TANK DEPOTS AND EVEN
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN
DOWNTOWN DAMASCUS.

IT COMES AFTER THE IMAGES OF
THAT HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK.

ON CAPITOL HILL, A LEADING
REPUBLICAN SAID THIS IS A TEST
FOR TRUMP.

IS THAT A TEST OF THAT
RELATIONSHIP TOO?

MARTHA WE KNOW
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEFENSE
SECRETARY ARE NOW TOGETHER.

I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA
IS ONE OF THE TRULY EGREGIOUS
CRIMES.

WHAT ARE THEY?

WE LEARNED THAT THE AIRCRAFT
THAT DROPPED THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WAS IN FACT A SYRIAN
MILITARY AIRCRAFT.

IF HE DOES NOTHING, THEN IT'S
GOING TO BE OBAMA ON STEROIDS.
