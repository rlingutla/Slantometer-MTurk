NAVY DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES
NOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
COULD LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILES
INTO SYRIA WHENEVER ORDERED,
TARGETING SYRIAN REGIME COMMAND
AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS,
AIRFIELDS OR AIRCRAFT THAT MIGHT
BE USED TO CARRY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

"WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
MONTHS."

BELIEVED TO BE THE SINGLE
DEADLIEST ATTACK SO FAR THERE IN
SYRIA.

ANOTHER OPTION -- U.S.

AND TONIGHT, MORE OF THOSE NEW
IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL NOT
INTERVENE UNTIL THE ATTACK IS
VERIFIED, BUT ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS ARE TONIGHT SAYING
THERE IS A STRONG SUSPICION THAT
THE ASSAD REGIME LAUNCHED THE
ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE REBELS
DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE KIND OF
ROCKETS IN WHICH THE CHEMICALS
WERE BELIEVED TO BE DELIVERED.

INSPECTORS TO VISIT THE
SITE, BUT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY
IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND
THE EVIDENCE THEY WOULD PRESENT
IS LIKELY CORRUPTED.

TO TAKING MILITARY ACTION IN
SYRIA THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH
STRONG WORDS FROM U.S. OFFICIALS
TODAY AND WARSHIPS AT THE READY.
