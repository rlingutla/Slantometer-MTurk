GO BACK, GO BACK.

THE OFFICERS WERE STANDING UP IN
THE LINE OF FIRE TO HELP THOSE
IN DANGER AND TO FIND OUT WHERE
THOSE HORRIBLE SHOTS WERE COMING

THE SHERIFF SAYS THE GUNMAN, THE

IT'S DIFFICULT AND A HEATED
DEBATE GOING FORWARD, SHEP.

AS ONE EYE WITNESS RECOUNTED
THIS WEEK, WHILE EVERYONE ELSE
WAS CROUCHING, POLICE OFFICERS

IF THERE'S A MEMORIAL SERVICE
THIS WEEKEND TO ATTEND, THE
WHITE HOUSE IS LOOKING TO ALL OF
THAT.

ON A SCALE THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED
IN NEVADA HISTORY.
