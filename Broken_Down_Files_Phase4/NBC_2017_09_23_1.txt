A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE
BEGAN TO EVACUATE.

I WAS FRUSTRATED,
WE'RE GOING BACK AND
FORTH, WE HAD NOWHERE
TO GO.

IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

MY MOTHER WAS
TERRIFIED.

SOON RETURNED WHEN
THEY HEARD NOTHING
ELSE FROM OFFICIALS.

THE LINES ARE NOT
ONLY HERE, IT'S
EVERYWHERE.

IN THE COCKPIT, THE
FOCUS IS ON THE
MISSION.

THE MILITARY THREW A
LIFELINE.

TONIGHT THE ARMY CORPS
OF ENGINEERS IS
ASSESSING WHETHER THIS
DAM WILL HOLD UP.

THIS PLANE IS GOING TO
TAKE OFF NOW, HEAD
OVER TO TEXAS, PICK UP
PALLETS OF WATER AND
COME BACK.

WHEN WE GET THE CALL,
WE HAVE THREE HOURS TO
GET OFF.

THE FOLKS IN THE AREA
ARE OKAY.

WE HAVE A TIGHT
STRING.

ROBERT MARTINEZ IS
DESPERATE TO CALL HIS
DAUGHTER WHO LIVES
NEAR PHILADELPHIA.

BUT THERE'S A
CRIPPLING CONFUSION OF
INFORMATION MUCH THE
GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO
REACH HALF OF THE
ISLAND'S
MUNICIPALITIES.

THOMAS WAS DEVASTATED
BY HURRICANE IRMA, AND
HIT AGAIN BY MARIA.

NO POWER, FOOD AND
WATER SHORTAGES THAT
THREATEN LIVES.

THEY HADN'T SPOKEN
SINCE THE STORM.

GOOD EVENING,
RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF
U.S. CITIZENS ARE
CLINGING TO HOPE AS
THEIR ISLAND HOMES ARE
COPING WITH THE DEADLY
EFFECTS OF HURRICANE
MARIA.

AS 3 MILLION PEOPLE
STRUGGLE WITH THE
BASICS OF SURVIVAL.
