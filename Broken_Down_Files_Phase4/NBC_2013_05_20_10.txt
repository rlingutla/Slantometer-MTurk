MORE OF OUR COVERAGE OF THIS
DEVASTATING STORM IN MOORE,

HER FAMILY IS OKAY.

WE KNOW THIS IS A SCENE THAT'S
HAPPENED BEFORE.

LOCAL WEATHER AUTHORITIES WERE
SAYING THE ONLY WAY THIS WAS
SURVIVABLE WAS TO BE UNDER
GROUND AT A SECURE UNDER GROUND
SHELTER.

I WOULD GIVE IT AN EF-5
RATING.

IT'S EARLY YET.

OVER HERE TO THE SOUTH EMERGENCY
CREWS HAVE BEEN CONTINUING TO
WORK ON GETTING KIDS OUT OF THE
SCHOOL BUILDING.

WAY.

THERE ARE A LOT OF GAS LEAKS.

AS WE SEE THE AERIALS OF THE
SEARCH CREWS GOING HOUSE TO
HOUSE TO HOUSE THEY ARE
DEFINITELY TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE
OUT OF THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING
SOME WHO ARE DESPERATELY TRYING
TO MAKE THEIR WAY HOME, BRIAN.

THIS THING IS SUCKING US IN AT
ABOUT 50 TO 60 MILES AN HOUR
RIGHT NOW.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

IT'S ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE, JUST
SHREDDING EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF
IT.

THIS IS JESSE WELLS FROM OUR NBC
TELEVISION STATION KFOR.

THE EXPANSE OF THE DAMAGE,
PROBABLY THREE BLOCKS IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.

WE GO TO THE WEATHER CHANNEL
HEADQUARTERS.

OH, NO.

WE HAVE TREES DEBARKED, CARS
TOSSED LONG DISTANCE.

THEY ARE GOING TO NEED TO GO
HOME TO HOME TO HOME AND MAKE
SURE EVERYONE IS ACCOUNTED FOR.

LET ME SHOW YOU THIS AS IT WENT.
