ALREADY DEAD.

ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS.

BUT HIGH ABOVE THE LAS VEGAS
STRIP, ANOTHER SPECTATOR WAS
WATCHING THEM.

JUST SOME CHILLING NEW
DETAILS TONIGHT.

THE GUNMAN'S LONG-TIME
GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY,
RIGHT NOW, OUT OF THE COUNTRY,
IS NOW BEING CALLED A PERSON OF
INTEREST TONIGHT.

AND THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOW,
RIGHT DOWN ONTO THAT CONCERT
SITE.

TEN SUITCASES, 23 GUNS.

CLEARLY, CLEARLY.

I SEE THE SHOTS COMING FROM
MANDALAY BAY, HALFWAY UP.

MATT GUTMAN WITH US LIVE IN LAS
VEGAS.

ALREADY, BEFORE WE GOT HERE.

SHE DIED IN HER HUSBAND'S ARMS.

WERE YOU IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP
TRUCK?

POLICE SAY HE'D SET UP AT LEAST
TWO CAMERAS.

â™ª
AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

AND THIS EVENING, WHAT WE DID
NOT KNOW.

PEOPLE HERE ALREADY?

VIDEO HE TOOK OF THE CONCERT
JUST MOMENTS BEFORE THE GUNFIRE
BEGAN.

THOSE SUITCASES WERE FULL OF
WEAPONS.

AND THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO THOSE
DOCTORS AND NURSES.
