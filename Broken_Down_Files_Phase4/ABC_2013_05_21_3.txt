COMING UP NEXT, WE KNOW HOW
HARD PEOPLE TRY TO SAVE THEIR
PETS AS WINDS ROAR AROUND THEM.

HE FOUND PIECES OF HIS LIFE
ACROSS HIS PROPERTY.

HEY!

NEW IMAGES OF THOSE FIRST
REUNIONS.

AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER
FAMILIES PORING OVER THE
FRAGMENTS OF THEIR LIVES
TONIGHT.

THESE TWO FRIENDS FOUND FLY JUST
HOURS AGO ON THE FLOORBOARD OF
HER OWNER'S CAR.

ALL DAY, WE HAVE WATCHED RESCUE
TEAMS SCOUR THE RUBBLE, LOOKING
AND LISTENING FOR ANY SIGN
SOMEONE MIGHT BE THERE
UNDERNEATH.

WHEN IT COLLAPSED, THE ROOF AND
WALLS PILING ON TOP OF ONE
ANOTHER, NO OPENING IN THE
MIDDLE, LIKE THOSE PODS.

I'M SO THANKFUL GOD WAS WITH
ME.

YEAH, THE METAL WAS POPPING
IN AND OUT.

GOD HAS HIS REASON FOR
EVERYTHING, GOT TO BELIEVE.

THE PUP TRIXIE BACK WITH HER
FAMILY AGAIN TONIGHT.

WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THE MAP,
AND REMIND YOU, WE'RE STANDING
WATCH HERE TONIGHT OVER THE
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY STILL UNDER
SEVERE WEATHER WATCHES.

THEY HAD DESKS AND CHAIRS AND
 AND TEACHER.

AND RIGHT NOW ACROSS MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, THERE ARE SO MANY
MEASURES UNDER WAY TO RETURN
EVERY FAMILY PET, EVERY DOG,
EVERY CAT, EVERY RABBIT, AND
EVEN HORSE TO VERY WORRIED
OWNERS.

ONCE THE ROOF LIFTED OFF OF THE
BUILDING, I FELT MYSELF BEING
SUCKED, AND I KNEW THAT IF I WAS
TAKEN, THEN ALL THE LITTLE
BABIES UNDERNEATH ME WOULD BE
GONE TOO.

TO CRAWL OUT FROM.

THIS WAS NANCY'S HOUSE BEFORE.

THIS MAN LIFTING UP A TEARFUL
BOY TO CONSOLE HIM.

YOU COULD SEE THE PRESSURE OF
THE TORNADO AGAINST THE METAL?
