COVERAGE NOW WITH BREAKING
NEWS AS FOX REPORTS LIVE
TONIGHT, AN ABSOLUTE
DISASTER IN THE HEART LAND
OF AMERICA.

BUT WE HAVE WATCHED VERY
CLOSELY AS THEY HAVE TAKEN
A NUMBER OF ITEMS OUT OF
THIS WRECKAGE.

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN
PULLED FROM THE RUBBLE THAT
WAS THEIR SCHOOL AND
WATCHED RESIDENTS COME TO
ASSIST LITTLE CHILDREN ON
CURBS.

FOUR MORE IN A HOME AS
REPORTED BY KFOR TELEVISION
IN OKLAHOMA CITY.

THIS IS ONE THAT I HOPE IS
WRONG.

THERE IS CHILDREN STILL
INSIDE THE SCHOOL THAT THEY
ARE TRYING TO LOCATE.

IT'S VERY HARD TO
BELIEVE, SHEP.

AND DOWN BELOW YOU CAN SEE
PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO
BECOME RESCUERS THIS
AFTERNOON LOOKING FOR
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE
TRAPPED BENEATH ANYBODY WHO
MIGHT NEED HELP  THEY ARE
COMPARING THIS TO THE GREAT
STORM OF 1999 WHICH RECORD
THROUGH THIS AREA BETWEEN
900 P.M. AND MIDNIGHT.

I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

AS YOU MENTIONED 16 MINUTES
WARNING FROM THE TORNADO
WARNING.

IN CASE YOU GET 16 MINUTES
OF WARNING WHICH FRANKLY
IS A LONG TIME.

IT CUT A PATH THROUGH MOORE
AND SURROUNDING AREAS LIKE
NOTHING ANYONE HAD EVER
SEEN.

TWO DAYS THAT THEY HAVE
BEEN DEALING WITH.

SADLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE
NEWS WILL GET WORSE BEFORE
IT GETS BETTER.

IT IS, IT'S VERY
ISOLATED.

AND THE NUMBERS LIKE THAT
WILL BE HARD TO COME BY FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

WE DO NOT YET KNOW EXACTLY
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HURT OR
DEAD.

AS PEOPLE TRY TO GET IN AND
HELP OR TRY TO MAKE THIS
LATE AFTERNOON.

WE'RE TOLD THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENED.

VASTLY COMPLICATING MATTERS
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE.
