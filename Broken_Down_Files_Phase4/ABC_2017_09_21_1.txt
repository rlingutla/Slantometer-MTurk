NOW THAT WE'RE SOUTH OF TOWN,
WE'RE SEEING SOME DAMAGE THAT
ACTUALLY LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A
TORNADO CAME THROUGH.

THOSE FEROCIOUS
155-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS, THE
MOST POWERFUL SEEN HERE IN
GENERATIONS.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

JUST GO OUT FOR HER.

JUST A DIRE SITUATION THERE.

WEAKENS IT AS IT GETS INTO
COOLER WATER.

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

NOW I SEE, WHEN THAT GENERATOR
RUNS OUT --
 WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

THERE WAS ALSO GREAT CONCERN
FOR SO MANY AMERICAN MEDICAL
STUDENTS ON DOMINICA.

THE URGENT PLEA TONIGHT.

HARROWING SCENES INSIDE.

SOME WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

AND BACK AT THE NURSING HOME,
MARIA WITH A MESSAGE FOR HER
DAUGHTER BACK IN FLORIDA.

THE CLEANUP PROCESS WILL LIKELY
TAKE WEEKS.

THAT'S ALL THEY HAVE NOW IS
ME.

ALSO BREAKING, FROM PUERTO
RICO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, ROB
MARCIANO TAKES US TO THE PART OF
THE ISLAND WHERE THE HURRICANE
MADE LANDFALL.

DANEESA, I'M HERE, WE'RE ALIVE,
I LOVE YOU.

THE HARD-HIT ISLAND OF
DOMINICA -- TOTAL DEVASTATION.

SHE ALSO NEEDS OXYGEN, SO,
OXYGEN AND DIESEL ARE NOT
SOMETHING WE CARRY, SO, OUR TEAM
CONTACTED THE OFFICE OF
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, AND THEY
ARE AWARE OF HER DESPERATE PLEA
AND HOPEFULLY CAN GET HER THE
HELP SHE NEEDS HERE IN THE
COMING DAYS, DAVID.

CLEARLY, THIS IS THE PATH OF THE
EYE WHEN IT CAME THROUGH.
