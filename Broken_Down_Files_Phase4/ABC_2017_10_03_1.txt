HOW COULD SHE NOT KNOW WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN HER OWN HOUSE
WITH THESE WEAPONS?

PETER CARAVELLA IS A SURGEON
HERE WHO GOT THE EMERGENCY CALL
AT 1100 SUNDAY NIGHT.

ALSO TONIGHT, FOR THE FIRST
TIME, WE TAKE YOU INSIDE THE
TRAUMA WARD AT A LAS VEGAS
HOSPITAL.

SUDDENLY OVERFLOWING.

NOW, U.S. OFFICIALS WANT TO KNOW
WHY PADDOCK BEGAN TO TRANSFER
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO
SOMEONE IN THE PHILIPPINES JUST
PRIOR TO THE SHOOTING.

THOUGH THIS SUSPECT WANTED TO
INFLICT MAXIMUM DAMAGE HERE.

BUT I JUST KEEP SEEING IT IN MY
MIND STILL AND IT JUST HAUNTS
ME.

JUST A BAD NIGHTMARE I HAVE TO
WAKE UP FROM.

WE GOT HERE, THERE WAS
PROBABLY 50 OR 60 PEOPLE IN THE
E.R.

WE SAW DIFFERENT PIECES OF
MACHINERY AND ARTILLERY THAT
WERE BASICALLY DISPERSED
THROUGHOUT THE ABDOMEN, CHEST.

PARTS OF WHAT EYEWITNESSES
CALLED THAT KILL BOX WERE A FULL
FIVE FOOTBALL FIELDS AWAY FROM
THAT SHOOTER'S PERCH UP THERE ON
IMPOSSIBLE, HAD HE JUST BEEN
USING HANDGUNS INSTEAD OF THOSE
LONG GUNS.

ROOM SERVICE.

AND WHEN OFFICERS FINALLY BROKE
DOWN THE DOOR --
 BREACH, BREACH, BREACH.

THEY SIMPLY MOVED IN AND SAVED
LIVES.

THEY BASICALLY TRIAGED EVERYBODY
AND SAID, THIS ONE'S CRITICAL,
THIS ONE'S CRITICAL, THIS ONE
NEEDS THIS, THIS ONE NEEDS THAT.

AND THIS SURGEON TELLS ME, THIS
TIME, IT WAS DIFFERENT.

WERE PRONOUNCED DEAD SHORTLY
AFTER THEY ARRIVED HERE.

EMPLOYEES AT THIS BAR IN
MESQUITE, AND FORMER NEIGHBORS,
SAY THE COUPLE WERE REGULARS,
DRINKING BEER AND TEQUILA AND
PLAYING VIDEO POKER AND THE
SLOTS.

WE REMEMBER.

HE BROUGHT AN ARSENAL.
