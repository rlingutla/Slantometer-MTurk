TIME IS KIND OF FUZZY RIGHT
NOW AND THEN WE HEARD
THAT'S THE LAST WE HAVE
HEARD.

IT REALLY GOT QUIET AFTER
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE.

YES.

AS BOB WARD SAID HIS
SOURCES TELL HIM THIS GUY
HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE TO
GO AT THIS POINT.

AND AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS
LIFTED, YOU COULD HE SEE
THE PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE
STREET.

PROGRESS BEING MADE TO
APPREHEND THE SUSPECT.

A LOT OF MOVEMENT.

SHE SAID SHE AND
PHOTOGRAPHER MAT TOMLIN
WERE RIGHT IN THE AREA AND
ACTUALLY HEARD THOSE SHOTS
FIRED AND MOMENTS LATER A
RUSH OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
THE SCENE ON FRANKLIN
STREET WHICH IS ON WATER
TOWN.

AND WE WERE -- IT'S JUST
ABOUT A BLOCK AWAY FROM
WHERE WE WERE DOING OUR
LIVE SHOT.

SO, RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS
FAIRLY PEACEFUL WHEN WE
HEAR WHAT PAUL SUTHERLAND,
AN EYEWITNESS JUST TOLD
JARED HOLBROOK ON THE
PHONE.

THEY DID AND IT WAS AFTER
THAT, WE'RE LED TO BELIEVE
THAT SHE'S SHOTS BEGAN
RAPID FIRE, 20 TO 30 SHOTS
ACCORDING TO THE LOCALS.

OW IF THEY KIND
OF SLIPPED IN BUT WE
DIDN'T SEE A LOT OF
PRESENCE AND THEN WITHIN --
I CAN'T TELL YOU WITHIN
TWO MINUTES THE PLACE WAS
SUR S
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED.

THAT IS THE WORD.

WE HAVE GOT ANOTHER
STANDOFF HERE.

AND WE ALSO HAD A FIRE
RESCUE TRUCK BACK INTO THE
AREA AS WELL.

HE HAS IMPORTANT
INFORMATION THAT
AUTHORITIES NEED AS THEY
CONTINUE THIS
INVESTIGATION.

DOES HE WANT TO COME OUT
AND HE SIMPLY CAN'T BECAUSE
HE IS INJURED?

THEY HAVE THE BOMB SQUAD ON
HAND AS WELL.

HE WE ARE TRYING TO LISTEN
AS WELL.

A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.
LOTS OF HOMES HERE AND IF
YOU LOOK AT THIS ARROW
BOAT IS THAT THEY BELIEVE A
SUSPECT WAS HIDING.
