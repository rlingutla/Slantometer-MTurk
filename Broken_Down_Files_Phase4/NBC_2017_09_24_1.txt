OFFICIALS, THEY'RE FINDING A    
SIMILAR STORY, OVER AND OVER    
AGAIN.

IF IT BURSTS, AUTHORITIES WARN  
OF LIFE-THREATENING FLOODING.

THE HURRICANE DESTROYED HIS HOME
TOO.

A COMMUNITY IN PUERTO RICO CUT  
OFF WHEN HURRICANE MARIA WASHED 
THIS BRIDGE AWAY.

EVEN YEARS.

THIS MAN IS A POLICE OFFICER.

NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER SAYS  
THE STORM WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN,
BUT WILL COME CLOSE TO THE COAST
OF NORTH CAROLINA.

FOUR DAYS AFTER HURRICANE   
MARIA SWEPT ACROSS PUERTO RICO, 
RESCUE TEAMS ONLY NOW ARE       
REACHING SOME OF THE MORE REMOTE
PARTS OF THAT ISLAND.

TODAY WE RODE ALONG WITH A FEMA 
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM FROM     
SOUTH FLORIDA AS IT MADE IT'S   
WAY TO THE CENTRAL PART OF THE  
ISLAND.

THE NEED HERE IS MASSIVE.

DAM AFTER FINDING A CRACK IN IT.

YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO WORK WITH   
THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDS US, AND I 
ALSO HAVE TO WORK WITH MY OWN   
NEEDS, YOU KNOW.

THIS WOMAN TELLS US EVERYTHING  
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS DEVASTATED.

AND A CLOSE EYE ON MARIA    
TONIGHT AS IT MOVES CLOSER TO   
THE UNITED STATES.

NO CELL SERVICE AND NO          
COMMUNICATION IS HAMPERING      
RESCUE EFFORTS.

THE ISLAND'S LONG RECOVERY ONE  
MISSION AT A TIME.

SO WE JUST SPENT THE LAST    
HOUR TRYING TO DRIVE AROUND AND 
FIND OUT WHERE TO GO AND WHAT   
NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

BUT THE MORE PEOPLE WE SPEAK    
WITH, IT'S CLEAR THIS RECOVERY  
WON'T BE MEASURED IN WEEKS, BUT 
MONTHS.

TONIGHT, THERE IS AN URGENT RUSH
TO CLEAR THESE ROADS AND OPEN UP
LINES OF COMMUNICATION.

RURAL PARTS OF THE ISLAND       
RAVAGED, INCLUDING THE MOUNTAIN 
TOWN.
