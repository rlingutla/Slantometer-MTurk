SO THIS IS A FIRST
GRADERS IN THIS AREA
JEREMY.

PARENTS, STUDENTS AND
TEACHERS FROM PLAZA
ELEMENTARY TODAY REENUNITED
AT ANOTHER LOCAL SCHOOL.

SHE, YOU KNOW, SHE THREW
HERSELF ON MY DAUGHTER TO
PROTECT HER AND I'M NEVER
GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO
REPAY HER.

THIS IS A HALLWAY WHERE
THEY TOOK SHELTER.

RIGHT BEFORE THEIR DAY WAS
OBVIOUSLY CHANGED A LOT.

WE HAVE TORNADO DRILLS
REGULARLY IN OUR SCHOOLS.

THIS IS A SAFE AREA IN THE
HALLWAY.

WE SAW SCHOOLWORK STILL ON
THEIR DESKS, TRAGICALLY, OF
COURSE SEVEN CHILDREN DIED
HERE AT PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY MIRACULOUSLY
MANY MORE SURVIVED.

DID ANY OF THE KIDS DIE
IN THAT GYM?

YES THE KITCHEN AREA
BACK THERE WHERE THE ROOF
IS CAVED IN THIS IS
ACTUALLY THE GYM AREA OVER
THERE THAT WAS 35-FOOT TALL
BUILDING THE GYMNASIUM.

THE KIDS IN THIS HALLWAY
ALL SURVIVED?

THESE CLASSROOMS ARE.

THERE ARE CERTAIN SAFE
AREAS UNFORTUNATELY THIS
WAS A STORM AND WE HAVE HAD
ONE OTHER STORM LIKE THIS
THAT THE THE WEATHER MAN
EVEN ON THE TELEVISION WILL
SAY IF YOU ARE NOT
UNDERGROUND THERE IS A VERY
LIKELY CHANCE YOU WON'T
SURVIVE THIS STORM.

CORRECT.

CLASSROOMS ON EACH SIDE.

WE RECEIVED NEW VIDEO OF
THE VIDEO OF WHAT BRIAR
WOOD ELEMENTARY LOOKS LIKE
TODAY.

THIS SEVERE WEATHER
FRONT WALL OF THE SCHOOL

SHE IS LIVE ON THE SCHOOL
GROUNDS FOR US THIS
EVENING.

YOU HAVE GOT THE LITTLE
FIRST GRADERS THAT COME OUT
AND LITERALLY TAUGHT TO GO
DOWN LIKE, THIS COVER THEIR
HEADS AND JUST CROUCH
AGAINST THE WALL?

THESE CLASSROOMS ARE NO
LONGER HERE.
