I CAN HEAR THE WIND!

THAT IS THE MAIN SORT OF
INTERSTATE THAT BLENDS THROUGH
OKLAHOMA EVEN RUNS UP NORTH
THROUGH KANSAS AND WE ARE ABOUT
50 MILES OR SO SOUTH OF NORMAN,
OKLAHOMA THAT IS UNDER THE GUN
THE LAST 30 MINUTES OR SO AND
JUST AS YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING
WITH JANUARY MISS DEAN THERE JANICE
DEAN I HAVE BEEN
MONITORING WHAT YOU GUYS ARE
SAYING.

GOING NORTH ARE ON INTERSTATE
35 THE MAIN CORRIDOR FROM SOUTH
SOUTH
TO NORTH THROUGH THE MIDWESTERN
PORTION OF THE COUNTRY HE UP
THROUGH OKLAHOMA.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I CAN TELL YOU WE WERE DOWN IN
NORTH TEXAS ON THE GROUND LAST
WEEK RIGHT AFTER THOSE STORMS
BLEW THROUGH AND DECIMATED SOME
PART TION OF TEXAS.

WHERE IS THAT AT, MICHELLE OR
BARRY?

SHE ARE ARE SO SPORADIC AND SO
ISOLATED WITH TORNADOES.

IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT OUT
THERE EYE EX-LY WHEN YOU
HAVE -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
HAVE SOMETHING SO CLOSE TO THE
RADAR.

HOW ARE THEY IN YOUR AREA?

IT IS THE DAY TIME HEATING.

WHAT IT WAS LIKE EARLIER WITH
THOSE WINDS WHIPPING AND NOW WE
CAN SEE STUFF JUST BLOWING IN
THE AIR.

THAT IS THE WEIRD THING IS WE
ARE USED TO SEEING IT ON THE TV
AND NO BIG DEAL FOR WHERE WE
ARE, WE KNOW IT IS WAY OUT
THERE.

YOUR OFFICE, YOUR DIVISION.

YOU ARE WITH US BY PHONE.

NOT BLOWING ONE DIRECTION OR
ANOTHER.

RE-RACK THAT, PLEASE.

SO FAR LUCKILY WE DON'T HAVE
ANY REPORTS OF INJURIES IN OUR
CITY WHICH IS WONDERFUL.

RIGHT NOW WE -- THE
EMERGENCY CREWS ARE STARTING
GOING NEIGHBORHOOD BY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

SOUTH AND EAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY
THIS IS MOVING TOWARDS PINK,
OKLAHOMA.

THAT IS THE TORNADO RIGHT
THERE.
