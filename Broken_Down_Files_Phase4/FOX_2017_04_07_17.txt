AS JENNIFER GRIFFIN
MENTIONED, THIS DEACONFLICTION
LINE WILL BE TAKEN DOWN.

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID
NOTHING OTHER THAN TALK ABOUT
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO
SITUATIONS HERE.

THIS GENOCIDE IS CONTINUING
WITHOUT A RESPONSE.

THE VETTING PROCESS AND HAS
BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

A VERY MEASURED AND VERY
DIRECTED APPROACH TO TRY TO
DETER FURTHER USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

SHOULD THE UNITED STATES ENGAGE
IN THAT FIGHT, YOU'VE SAID HERE
THAT WE SHOULD RESPOND IN KIND
IF THERE IS BARREL BOMBING AND
THE LIKE.

IT WILL UNFOLD AND THE MEDIA
WILL START REPORTING ON IT.

I DEFINITELY THINK THIS IS AN
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF
AL-ASSAD, HOW MUCH DANGER IS
THERE THAT HE WOULD PUSH THIS
TOWARD ESCALATION?

I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT.

OUR ACTIONS CHANGED.

LOOKS NICE THERE, DOESN'T IT?

SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

THE SAD FACT, BECAUSE OF OUR
LACK OF INVOLVEMENT, WEAKNESS,
WE CREATED A VACUUM.

BUT THERE'S WAYS TO EACH OF US
GETTING MOST OF WHAT WE WANT.

GENERAL MATTIS AND HIS NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER FLEW DOWN
SEPARATELY FROM THEIR BOSS WITH
THE PLAN.

WAS IT WARRANTED AND IF SO WHAT
THE IS WARRANTED GOING FORWARD?

I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE A
STEPPED UP RESPONSE.

THEY'RE FROM IMAGE SAT
INTERNATIONAL.
