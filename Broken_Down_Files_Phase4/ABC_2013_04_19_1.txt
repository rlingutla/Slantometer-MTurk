YEAH, HE'S THE ONE THAT OWNS
THE HOUSE.

YES, THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN
ALL ONG.

MOMENTS AGO, WE HEARD THEM SAY,
"WE GOT HIM" AND THEY WERE
CHEERING AGAIN.

WE TRIED TO HEAR WHAT THE POLICE
RADIOS ARE SAYING, BUT IT'S A
LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT.

HE TWEETED OUT, "WE GOT HIM."

YES.

TRYING TO GET INTELLIGENCE AND
INFORMATION OUT OF THIS
INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THE BIG
QUESTION HERE, DIANE, THAT THE
ENTIRE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON IS WHETHER
OR NOT THESE BROTHERS WERE
ACTING ALONE OR WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WERE PART OF A LARGER GROUP
AND THERE COULD BE OTHER
PLOTTERS OUT THERE.

AGAIN, WE DO NOT KNOW HIS
CONDITION AT PRESENT.

THESE SAME RESIDENTS, MANY OF
THEM -- YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE
HUGGING RIGHT HERE.

AND BRIAN, WHEN YOU SAY THAT
THEY ARE BRINGING HIM IN UNDER
FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES, WHAT
IS THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING
THERE?

WELL, I BELIEVE SO -- I'M
LOOKING OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW AND I
SAW A COUPLE OF AMBULANCES GO
BY, I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE FOR THE
SUSPECT.

ROBOTS THEY SENT DOWN, SOME TO
TAKE A LOOK INSIDE THE BOAT, BUT
THERE WAS ANOTHER MACHINE,
ACCORDING TO REPRESENTATIVE
LONG, THAT COULD ACTUALLY TIP
THE BOAT, TIP HIM OUT OF THE
BOAT.

IT WAS -- IT ACTUALLY STARTED
LAST NIGHT AT ABOUT 145 A.M.,
THERE WERE -- IT'S A VERY QUIET
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE HELICOPTERS
CAME OVER AND I THOUGHT, OKAY,
FINE, THERE'S A HELICOPTER, BUT
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING MUCH
MORE THAN THAT.

IF YOU REALLY HAVE NO IDEA AND
NOBODY MADE ANY CLAIMS IN
MONDAY'S BOMBING, SO, THAT
TERROR REALLY, REALLY -- THE
NEIGHBORHOOD THAT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT, IMAGINE WHAT THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN THROUGH
TODAY.

WELL, RIGHT NOW HE'S -- HE'S
PRETTY MUCH IN SHOCK.

WE CAN ONLY HOPE WE GET
RESOLUTION TONIGHT.

SO, HE GOT A LADDER AND PUT IT
UP AGAINST THE SIDE AND HE HAS A
ZIP COVER.

I WANT TO BRING IN ROBIN DUMA,
WHO IS ALSO AN EYEW, LIVES
NEI HEARD POLICE TALKING IN
THE BACKYARD, ROBIN?

AND FOR ANYONE WHO HAPPENED TO
MISS THE MOMENT THAT WE GOT THAT
PHONE CALL FROM GEORGE, WHO GAVE
US, FIRST WORD, OF HOW THEY
APPEARED TO HAVE FOUND THIS
SUSPECT, I WANT TO REPLAY IT,
BECAUSE HIS FRIEND, DAVE
HANNEBURY, FROM TWO DOORS DOWN,
WAS IN HIS HOUSE BEING
INTERVIEWED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

REPRESENTATIVE LONG SAYS, YOU
KNOW, IT'S OVER.
