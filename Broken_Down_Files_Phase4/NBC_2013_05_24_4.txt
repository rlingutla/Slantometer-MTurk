SEEING WHAT'S LEFT OF THEIR DAY
CARE CENTER IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
ANYONE MADE IT OUT ALIVE.

TURNING NOW TO MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, AT THE END OF A TRYING
WEEK.

WHERE DOES IT HURT?

AND THE DAY CARE WORKERS WHO
SERVED AS HUMAN SHIELDS TO
PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THEIR
CARE.

WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?

THE TEACHERS?

CROUCHED DOWN ALONG HALLWAY
SECONDS BEFORE IMPACT SIMPSON
GOT ON THE INTERCOM AND SAID
SIMPLY, IT'S HERE.

PUT COTS OVER THE HEADS.

I'M THANKFUL AND BLESSED TO
HAVE ALL OF Y'ALL TO TAKE CARE
OF THE KIDS.

NO.

THAT'S WHEN I STARTED TO YELL.

YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BACK HERE?

LOT?

YES, SHE DID.

SOME TWO BY FOURS, A CAR.

THEIR PRINCIPAL WAS ON HAND FOR
THOSE MEMORIALS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

LINDA'S BODY WAS PINNED UNDER
THE CAR.

AS WE BUILD AND BUILD, THE MONEY
HAS GONE FOR CLASSROOM SPACE.

YEAH.
