CENTER, SURROUNDED BY FIRST
RESPONDERS, THE PRESIDENT
PRAISING THEIR HEROISM, LIKE
THESE DISPATCH OPERATORS WHO
ANSWERED THOSE FRANTIC CALLS FOR
HELP.

THE WOUNDS HE SAW FIRST-HAND.

PROFILE OF THE SHOOTER.

HAD HARSH WORDS.

APPARENTLY HE WAS SHOT IN THE
LEG, AS WELL.

SURVIVORS.

THAT WAY, THAT WAY, THAT WAY.

WE'RE LEARNING HE WASN'T JUST
SHUTTERED UP IN THAT LUXURY
SUITE IN THAT HOTEL.

IT MAKES YOU VERY PROUD TO BE AN
AMERICAN, WHEN YOU SEE THE JOB
THAT THEY'VE DONE.

HE'D BEEN HOLED UP WITH THAT
MASSIVE ARSENAL, 23 GUNS IN ALL.

SOME HERO CAME AND SAVED ME,
HIS FINGER TO THE BULLET WOUND.

OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE FIRST
RESPONDERS.

NO ONE.

EXTRAORDINARY CALM, THOSE
OFFICERS DIRECTING CONCERT-GOERS
AWAY FROM THE SHOOTING TO
SAFETY.

CALM AND STRONG, SHARP.

IT WAS PADDOCK WHO SENT HER TO
THE FILL PEEPS JUST TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE SHOOTING.

ACCORDING TO HER SISTERS IN
AUSTRALIA, WHO WANTED THEIR
FACES BLURRED, NO ONE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT PADDOCK.

YEAH, I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL
HE'S DONE FOR ME.

WITH THE FIRST LADY BY HIS SIDE,
THEIR FIRST STOP, THE HOSPITAL
TREATING DOZENS OF PATIENTS,
STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.

YEAH, I NEED TO.
