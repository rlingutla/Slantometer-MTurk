WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

AS THEY REPORTED IN OKLAHOMA
A SHORT WHILE AGO, OUR TEAM IS
IN PLACE TO COVER IT ALL,
INCLUDING NBC'S JANET SHAMLIAN
IN OKLAHOMA CITY WHO SPENT SOME
TIME HERSELF TAKING SHELTER
TODAY.

WE STILL HAVE A HIGH TORNADO
THREAT AS WE GO LATE INTO THE
EVENING TONIGHT, ALL ACROSS THE
UPPER MIDWEST, STRETCHING ON
DOWN TOWARDS OKLAHOMA.

IT IS LARGE AND MULTI-VORTEX.

WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT FLASH
FLOODING IN A LOT OF THE
SLOW-MOVING THUNDERSTORMS AS
WELL.

THERE IS LARGE STRUCTURAL
DEBRIS.

HOLY SMOKES.

ALREADY THERE HAD BEEN A NUMBER
OF TORNADOES THAT HAVE TOUCHED
DOWN IN OKLAHOMA, INCLUDING THIS
ONE WE SAW A BIT EARLIER IN
EDMOND.

WE WATCHED AS THIS ALL UNFOLDED
IN OKLAHOMA JUST MOMENTS AGO.

ON THIS SUNDAY NIGHT -- HIGH
ALERT.

AND THEN TOMORROW STILL MORE
SEVERE WEATHER FROM OKLAHOMA
CITY ON UP TOWARDS CHICAGO.

FOLKS, LOOK AT THAT.

BUT THAT ENDED WITH LAST WEEK'S
ASSAULT ON TEXAS WHERE SIX
PEOPLE DIED IN GRANBURY NEAR FT.
WORTH.

TAKE A LISTEN.

THAT'S VIOLENT.

THAT IS APPROACHING DOBBS ROAD.

CONDITIONS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE
VERY QUICKLY HERE.

ALL WITHIN TWO HOURS.

WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THEM AROUND
THE OKLAHOMA CITY AREA,
STRETCHING ON UP INTO KANSAS,
WARNINGS GALORE.

AS YOU INDICATED, FOR THE WHILE
WE WERE IN THE BACK AFTER TARGET
STORE ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM WHERE
I AM STANDING WITH SEVERAL DOZEN
OTHER PEOPLE TAKING SHELTER.
