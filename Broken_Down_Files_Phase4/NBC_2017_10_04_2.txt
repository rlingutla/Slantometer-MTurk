IN JUST THE PAST HOUR -
INVESTIGATORS TOOK US MINUTE BY
MINUTE INTO THE SHOOTING ...
PLUS LAPTOPS SNATCHED FROM
CUSTOMERS.

ON THE OTHER HAND,
THERE'S NOT GOING TO
BE A SINGLE LAW WHICH
STOPS SOMEBODY
DETERMINED TO DO
SOMETHING BAD.

IT IS A REAL LIFE
ACCOUNT OF THE TERROR
THAT RAINED DOWN ON SO
MANY.

THE MAN WITH A MOTIVE
TO KILL STILL FIRING
SNIPER'S NEST.

TONIGHT, A NEW PIECE
OF VIDEO TAKEN JUST
BELOW THE HOTEL AS THE
GUNFIRE ERUPTED.

WE STAND TOGETHER TO
HELP YOU CARRY YOUR
PAIN.

EVERYBODY'S DYING.

GET DOWN, GET DOWN,
GET DOWN!

OFF-DUTY FIREFIGHTERS
FROM THE VEGAS AREA
WERE ALSO ON THE SCENE
INCLUDING JESSE GOMEZ
WHO GOT HIS FAMILY TO
SAFETY, THEN TOLD HIS
WIFE HE WAS GOING BACK
TO HELP.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
STEPPING UP SECURITY
OUTSIDE OF HOTELS AND
INSIDE AT THE WYNN AND
ENCORE, BEYOND THE
SECURITY CAMERAS, NEW
BAG CHECKS AND
HANDHELD METAL
DETECTORS FOR GUESTS
AND STAFF.

POSSIBLY PUT
SENSORS IN THE
WINDOWS.

AND AS THE
INVESTIGATION MOVES
FORWARD, WE ARE
HEARING MORE DRAMATIC
ACCOUNTS OF A STRUGGLE
TO GET OUT ALIVE ONCE
THE CHAOS AND
CONFUSION BEGAN.

WE LOOK FOR ACTUAL
INDICATORS OF
AFFILIATION, OF
MOTIVE, OF INTENT, AND
SO FAR WE'RE NOT
THERE.

HAVE YOU HAD
DISCUSSIONS ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE
AISLE?

JUST GO.

TEARING THROUGH THE
AIR MUFFLED ONLY BY
SCREAMS.

SHE WAS SENT AWAY.

DEMOCRATIC SENATOR
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL
CO-SPONSORS THE BILL.

BATTLEFIELD NO ONE
WILL EVER FORGET.

GO, GO, GO, GO.
