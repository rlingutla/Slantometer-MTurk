AND ALL I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS
MY SON.

WE KNEW THE STORMS WERE
COMING.

I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY, WE WERE
GETTING SLAMMED WITH HAIL AND
RAIN AGAIN.

MAYBE NOT TO THE EMOTIONAL
EXTENT OF THIS TRAGEDY, BUT WITH
ONLY TEN CRITICAL AT THE MOMENT,
WE'RE CAPABLE OF HANDLING
ANYMORE.

DARKNESS OVERWHELMING MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

AND OUR TEACHER GRABBED ME, AND
THE REST OF THE STUDENTS, AND
SAID, WE'RE GOING TO THE SAFE
ROOM, AND WE ALL GOT THERE, AND
WE WERE QUIET.

THAT WAS HER CAR.

THEY ARE STUNNING PICTURES
AND STUNNING STORIES FROM THE
FAMILIES ON THE GROUND THERE IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

THE SMELL OF GAS IS PERMEATING
STILL.

WE'RE RECEIVING PATIENTS
LITERALLY, MINUTE BY MINUTE.

OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS COVERED IN
DEBRIS.

MOST LIKELY FROM PUNCTURES FROM
FLYING DEBRIS.

AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
THE MOMENT OF THE CRISIS.

THAT TORNADO PASSED RIGHT OVER
THAT SCHOOL.

SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN SWEPT
ALREADY BY A BIG TRACTOR.

RIGHT AWAY, AT BRIARWOOD
ELEMENTARY, ONE OF THE SCHOOLS
HARDEST HIT.

MISS SIMON HAD THE KIDS IN ONE
HALLWAY, AND SHE SAID THAT IT
SOUNDED LIKE A TRAIN COMING.

WE STILL SEE SOME PLUMES OF
SMOKE.

WITHIN AN HOUR, IT WAS A MONSTER
STORM DEVELOPING JUST ABOUT AS
QUICKLY AS ALL THE DETAILS HAVE
TOLD US THE JOPLIN STORM
DEVELOPED.

SHE SAID HE WAS HELPING PEOPLE,
PULLING STUFF OFF OF KIDS.
