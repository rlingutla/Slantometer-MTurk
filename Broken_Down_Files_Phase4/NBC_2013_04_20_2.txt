GUESSED HOW QUICKLY THAT WOULD
HAPPEN.

IN THIS VIDEO, A RADICAL
PROPHECY.

AND WHILE THE CRISIS IS
OVER, THE INVESTIGATION OF WHAT
MOTIVATED THE SUSPECTS IS JUST
BEGINNING.

SECURITY AND A NEW NORMAL TAKING
SHAPE.

UNDER COVER OF DARKNESS, A
NEGOTIATOR IS RUSHED TO THE
SCENE.

WITHOUT ANY STRONG DEROGATORY
INFORMATION, THE FBI WOULD STILL
BE LIMITED IN WHAT IT COULD DO.

TODAY, BOSTON LOOKED THE SAME,
BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME.

OH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE, BUT MY GUT TELLS ME
THAT YES.

PAUL OPENED HIS EYES FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE HE LOST HIS
LEG.

INTERNATIONAL, A SECURITY
DIRECTOR ORDERED EVERYONE TO PAY
EVEN CLOSER ATTENTION TO THEIR
SURROUNDINGS.

RUSSIA'S PRESIDENT
VLADIMIR PUTIN SPOKE WITH
PRESIDENT OBAMA LAST NIGHT AND
THE TWO LEADERS ARE DISCUSSING
THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING MORE
CLOSELY TOGETHER ON
COUNTERTERRORISM IN THE FUTURE.

I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT.

WILL DEPLOY MORE THAN 700 POLICE
OFFICERS FOR TOMORROW'S
MARATHON, THE FIRST BIG RACE
SINCE BOSTON.

AT A ROAD RACE IN ASBURY PARK,
NEW JERSEY, STILL RECOVERING
FROM SUPERSTORM SANDY.

NO ONE CAN STOP THE JIHAD.

INVESTIGATORS ARE INTENSELY
FOCUSED ON THE BACKGROUND OF THE
TSARNAEV BROTHERS AND WHAT DROVE
THEM TO TERRORISM.

DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHAT
MOTIVATED TAMERLAN AND HIS
BROTHER BUT CONGRESSIONALS HAVE
TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR FBI
OFFICIALS ABOUT WHETHER THEY
COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO STOP
THEM.

BUT IN RECENT YEARS, TAMERLAN
HAD CHANGED AND BECAME
RADICALIZED, ACCORDING TO HIS
UNCLE, WHO SAYS HE THEN SPOKE TO
A FAMILY FRIEND.

STAY STRONG!

THE FBI SAYS A CHECKED
DATABASES, INTERVIEWED TAMERLAN
AND FAMILY MEMBERS, BUT QUOTE
DID NOT FIND ANY TERRORISM
ACTIVITY, DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN.
