HIGH SURF, DANGEROUS RIP        
CURRENTS ARE EXPECTED UP AND    
DOWN THE EAST COAST OVER THE    
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

GREG IS A FIREFIGHTER FROM      
MIAMI.

GABE GUTIERREZ WAS WITH A RESCUE
TEAM TODAY AS IT FINALLY MADE IT
CAN CARRY, WADING THROUGH       
RUSHING WATER, HOLDING ON TO A  
DEAD POWER CABLE, NOW AN        
IMPROMPTU LIFELINE.

I'M TAMMIE LITHER IN, PEOPLE 
ARE DESPERATE FOR WATER.

HERE OUTSIDE THIS AREA, THEY'VE 
JERRY RIGGED A PVC PIPE TO GET  
RIVER WATER BECAUSE THERE'S NO  
DRINKING WATER ANYWHERE ON THE  
ISLAND.

FROM MILES AWAY, CARS WITHOUT   
GAS, VERY TOUGH, VERY TOUGH.

IT'S PRETTY HARD BECAUSE I   
HAVE TO DO TWO JOBS AT THE SAME
