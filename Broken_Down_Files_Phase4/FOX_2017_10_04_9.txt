WE'RE EXPECTING IT IN 20
MINUTES.

WE'RE WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT
TO APPEAR AGAIN IN JUST A
MOMENT.

THE EMPLOYEES AT MGM RESORTS AND
HOW THEY RESPONDED AS WELL.

BUT THE POLICE AT THE TIME SAID,
YOU KNOW, DON'T USE THAT HIGHWAY
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SIGHT OF HIM.

HERE ON EARTH, WE'RE BLESSED TO
BE SURROUNDED BY HEROS.

COMING UP HERE, ANDREW
NAPOLITANO, THE JUDGE, ON WHERE
THE INVESTIGATION GOES FROM HERE
AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND STOPS
COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS?

NOBODY CAN PUT IT TOGETHER
EXCEPT MARILOU.

THEY WERE PUT ON THE FLOOR OF
THE HOTEL SWEEP IN MANDALAY BAY.

THE AUTHORITIES TOLD US THIS
MORNING THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE
TO IDENTIFY ALL BUT THREE OF THE
VICTIMS.

I THINK IT'S INTERESTING IN THIS
INCREDIBLY POLARIZED TIME, SHEP,
WITH THIS DEBATE THAT NEVER GOES
ANYWHERE, THAT THERE'S SOME
REPUBLICANS WILLING TO LOOK
AT -- YOU PLAYED CLIPS FROM TOM
COLE, THE REPUBLICAN, REPORTS
THAT SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, THE
NUMBER 2 IN LEADERSHIP ON THE
SENATE SIDE IS INTERESTED.

WELL, THEY WERE IN MANY CASES
JUST DEFENSELESS AND OUT IN THE
WIDE OPEN.

THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT
SHE KNEW ABOUT THAT.

WE SAW DESPITE THE SADNESS AND
GRIEF AROUND US THAT WE'RE
RESILIENT AND THAT WE'RE
COMMITTED TO FIGHT AND RECOVER
AND BEGIN THE LONG PROCESS OF
HEALING.

WE'LL HAVE THAT LIVE WHEN IT
HAPPENS.

SENATOR CORTEZ, MAJORITY LEADER.

THEY'VE SEEN PROFESSIONALISM
LIKE YOU RARELY SEE.

WE HOPE TO GET MORE INFORMATION
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GLEANING FROM
THE INTERVIEW IN THE NEXT HOUR
OR SO.

THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE SUCCESS
FOR THE CONTINUANCE OF THE
INVESTIGATION.

HE DID.

THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE SO-CALLED
BUMP OR SLIDE STOCKS THAT THE
SHOOTER HAD INSTALLED ON A FEW
RIFLES, MIGHT AS BE AS MANY AS
12, WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO FIRE A
SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE AT ALMOST
AUTOMATIC SPEED.
