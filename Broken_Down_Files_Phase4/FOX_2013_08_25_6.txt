LET'S WATCH THAT AND THEN WE'LL
TALK MORE.

IRAN SAID WE BETTER NOT TOUCH
SYRIA, PARAPHRASING IT.

THE PROBLEM IS THE RED LINE
IS THAT IT IS RED, FEW PEOPLE
WILL EVER FORGET IT.

ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE
PRESIDENT DOES USE MASSIVE FORCE
TO CHANGE THE BALANCE OF FORCES
WITHIN SYRIA ITSELF, IT COULD
WELL RESULT IN THE OPPOSITION
TAKING POWER, WHICH I DON'T
THINK IS IN AMERICA'S INTEREST
EITHER.

THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS A QUICK
INTERVENTION WOULD BE
PROBLEMATIC, WHILE SOME
LAWMAKERS THINK LEADERS SHOULD
BE ACTING OUT OF ABUNDANCE OF
CAUTION, OTHERS SAY THERE SHOULD
BE MORE ACTIVITY.

THE U.N. ANNOUNCING SYRIA IS
CLAIMING IT WILL ALLOW A TEAM OF
INSPECTORS TO EXAMINE THE SITE.

JUST HOURS AGO, LAWMAKERS FROM
BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES CALLING
FOR A LIMITED MILITARY RESPONSE.

I THINK THAT'S FINE.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

I THINK THE SYRIANS THOUGHT THEY
WERE BUYING TIME AND MAY YET,
BUT THE RHETORIC FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE IS UNDOUBTEDLY STEPPED UP.

ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION,
THEY DISCUSSED POSSIBLE FUTURE
RESPONSES BY THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY AND AGREED TO STAY IN
CONSTANT COMMUNICATION.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO
ALLOW THEM TO GO IN.

A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS
THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WERE USED BY THE SYRIAN
REGIME AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE.
