INITIALLY I FELT THE FIRST ONE
AND I FELT IT GO THROUGH THINK
LEG INTO MY CHEST.

THEY ARE CAREFUL WITH THEIR
LANGUAGE.

TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE THE
EXPLOSIONS HAPPENED.

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
ROADBLOCKS THROUGHOUT THE AREA.

AGAIN, WE ARE IN THE BACK BAY OF
BOSTON.

SECURES AND STEALING A COURSE
LIKE THE BOSTON MARATHON WITH
20,000 RUNNERS AND HALF A
MILLION SPECTATORS IS ALMOST AN
IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE.

AND SECURING EVERY POSSIBLE
PUBLIC EVENT THAT COULD INVITE
AN ATTACK IS RESPOND REASONABLE.

H THIS IS A VERY POPULAR AREA.

IF THERE WAS A BLESSING IT
WAS THAT THE MEDICAL TENT WAS
RIGHT THERE AT THE CONCLUSION OF
THE RACE.

BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY OTHERS
WERE PLANTED.

THERE IS THE EXPLOSION.

FROM 96 COUNTRIES SIGNED UP FOR
THE 26.2-MILE RACE.

IT WAS CARNAGE.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS TONIGHT SAY
THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT
THIS IS PART OF ANY LARGER
THREAT.

IF YOU ARE CROSSING THE FINISH
LINE AT THAT POINT IN THIS RACE
YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL.

WE HAD TO CIRCLE OVER PROVIDENCE
FOR QUITE A WHILE BEFORE THEY
ALLOWED US TO LAND.

250 P.M.

BACK BAY IS NORMALLY A BUSY
AREA.

THERE WERE REALLY BAD, BAD
INJURIES.

AND IT DID.
