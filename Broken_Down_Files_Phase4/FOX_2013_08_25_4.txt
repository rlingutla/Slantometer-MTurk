I DON'T THINK THE U.N.
INSPECTORS WILL FIND MUCH OF
ANYTHING.

IT IS ALREADY MONDAY THERE.

NO ONE SAID WE WOULD DO THAT.

TO GET A BETTER IDEA WHAT THE
THREATS MEAN AND WHETHER THEY
WOULD ACTUALLY DETER US MAKING A
MOVE, WE BRING IN FORMER U.S.
AMBASSADOR TO UNITED NATIONS,
JOHN BOLTON.

THEY MAY HAVE HAD RUSSIAN
ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT.

LOOKING AT SYRIA IS LOOKING AS
TRAGIC AS IT IS IS LOOKING IN A
STRATEGIC SENSE AT A SECONDARY
ISSUE.

SENATOR BOB CORKER OF TENNESSEE,
RANKING MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN
RELATIONS COMMITTEE IS AMONG THE
LAWMAKERS GOING ON THE RECORD
TODAY.

I THINK SHE WILL BE BACK IN TIME
FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAPPENS,
GIVEN THAT PUBLICITY.

THE PRESIDENT LOOKED VERY
FOOLISH, VERY WEAK SIX MONTHS
AGO WHEN CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE
FIRST REPORTED USED ON A LARGE
SCALE, CROSSING THE RED LINE
THAT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF DREW
A YEAR AGO AND THE PRESIDENT DID
NOTHING.

WE HAVE TO VERIFY IT WAS
DIRECTED BY THE ASSAD REGIME.

THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT SYRIA IS
USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON ITS
OWN PEOPLE, FROM A SENIOR OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL.

AND THE SECOND LAWMAKER, OF
COURSE, YOU SAW THERE WAS
SENATOR JACK REED WHO TALKED
ABOUT DIFFUSING COUNTRIES LIKE
IRAN AND HE MENTIONED RUSSIA,
LONG TIME ALLY OF THE SYRIAN
PRESIDENT, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

I CERTAINLY WOULD DO CRUISE
MISSILE STRIKES.

WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR WAR
SHIPS, AGAIN, OFF THE COAST OF
SYRIA, MISSILES ARE AN OPTION TO
TRY TO TAKE OUT THE CHEMICAL
STOCK PILES.

I THINK THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THE
AGONIZING IS ABOUT.

COMING UP, INSIDE THE FOX
REPORT, YOU HEARD US SO FAR
REPORT TWO THREATS, ONE FROM
IRAN, ONE FROM RUSSIA.

AS I SAID, THE ASSAD REGIME
WOULD NOT BE IN POWER BUT FOR
IRAN, AND WHILE PEOPLE SAY THIS
IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN DEFEAT
IRAN, THIS IS EFFECTIVELY MUCH
LESS IMPORTANT THAN IRAN'S
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.

DO YOU WAIT FOR THE INSPECTORS
TO TELL US WHAT THEY FOUND THERE
AT THE DEATH SITE OR IS THE
WHITE HOUSE STALLING FOR TIME TO
MAKE A DECISION?

TODAY, THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
CLAIMED THEY WILL ALLOW U.N.
INSPECTORS TO LOOK AT THE SITE
IT HAPPENED.

THE POPE, LEADER OF ONE BILLION
CATHOLICS AROUND THE WORLD HAS
SPOKEN ABOUT SYRIA.
