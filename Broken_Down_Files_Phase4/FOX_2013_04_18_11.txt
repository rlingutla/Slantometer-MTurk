LET ME IT RATE -- REITERATE
THAT CAUTION.

YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THEY'RE
VIOLENT AND THE FEDERAL
INVESTIGATORS WANT TO GET
INFORMATION ABOUT THESE
INDIVIDUALS.

WITH ME NOW TERRY FORMER
DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
OF THE COUNTER TERRORISM
DIVISION OF THE FBI.

MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE
A SHORT TIME AGO TWEETED
THE FOLLOWING.

BOSTON STRONG DISPLAYED ON
THE ICE AND THROUGH THE
ARENA.

THE BLAST LOCATION HERE
ON BOYLSTON STREET STILL
VERY MUCH AN ACTIVE CRIME
SCENE.

BILL, ONE OTHER THING, A
LOT OF-LY TO HAS BEEN A LOT
OF CRITICISM ABOUT ALL OF
THESE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
POSTED AROUND ALL OF THESE
BIG CITIES IN AMERICA.

THIS VIDEO AND THESE
PHOTOS.

SHE IS LIVE IN WASHINGTON
NOW.

THE LATEST ON THE FBI'S
DIRECTOR APPEAL TO EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF US.

THE FBI SPECIAL AGENT
LEADING THE INVESTIGATION
SAYS THAT ANYONE WITH ANY
INFORMATION ON THE SUSPECTS
NEEDS TO STEP FORWARD NOW.

REMEMBER, THIS IS A VERY
VERY FAST-MOVING CASE.

THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO APPROACH THEM,
BILL?

FOLKS BROUGHT FLAGS AND
HAND MADE SIGNS.

IT WOULD BE CALLED A
SUPPORT NETWORK FOR THEIR
OPERATIONS IN BOSTON.

CATHERINE, THE FBI AGENT IN
CHARGE, AND I WILL BRING
RICK IN FOR A COMMENT ON
THIS AS WELL.

STABBED BY THERE ACROSS
TOWN.

THEY SPENT MANY HOURS
DISCUSSING THIS AND
ANALYZING AND ASSESSING
WHAT THEY HAD AND THEY
DECIDED THAT IT THEY WERE
NO LONGER GOING TO HAVE
TIME TO IDENTIFY THESE
PEOPLE ON THEIR OWN.

THE DECISION TO RELEASE THE
PICTURES HAS BENEFITS.

IF YOU ARE IN ANY OF THOSE
PROFESSIONS OR OCCUPATIONS
THINK ABOUT THESE PEOPLE
AND CALL IF YOU HAVE ANY
INTICKET THAT I THINK I SAW
THESE TWO PEOPLE OR I THINK
I RENTED A ROOM TO THEM.
