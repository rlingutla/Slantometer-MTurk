THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION AND THAT
IS NECESSARY TO TAKE FURTHER
STEPS IN SYRIA, ALSO WILL HELP
DIFFUSE SOME OF THE COUNTRIES
LIKE IRAN, RUSSIA, TRYING TO
PAWN THIS OFF ON THE REBELS.

WE HEARD FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION OVER THE WEEKEND,
THE NAVY STATION DESTROYERS IN
THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEE,
BUT NO WORD ON PLANS FOR THE
SHIPS.

SAMANTHA POWER HAS TAKEN YOUR
OLD POST AS U.S.
AMBASSADOR AT
THE U.N.
SHE WAS AWAY FOR PERSONAL
REASONS WE READ THIS WEEK,
MISSED THAT VERY IMPORTANT
EMERGENCY MEETING AT THE UNITED
NATIONS.

I THINK THEY THINK OBAMA IS
WEAK AND CAN BULLY HIM, PUSHING
ON ONE OTHER BUTTON THAT THE
PRESIDENT HIGHLIGHTED LAST WEEK
WHEN HE WONDERED WHAT HIS
INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY WAS TO
LAUNCH MILITARY ACTION.

IN FACT, WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT
REPUBLICAN OUT OF TEXAS, WHO
TALKS ABOUT THAT TENUOUS
RELATIONSHIP NOW WITH RUSSIA.

ONE LAWMAKER SAYS THE U.S.
SHOULD BE PREPARED TO USE THEM
AGAINST THE ASSAD REGIME IN THE
WAKE OF CHEMICAL ATTACK AGAINST
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

I THINK WE WILL RESPOND IN A
SURGICAL WAY AND I HOPE THE
PRESIDENT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK
TO WASHINGTON WILL ASK FOR
AUTHORIZATION FROM CONGRESS TO
DO SOMETHING IN A VERY SURGICAL
AND PROPORTIONAL WAY, SOMETHING
THAT GETS THEIR ATTENTION, THAT
CAUSES THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT
WE ARE NOT GOING TO PUT UP WITH
THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY.

ALL OF THIS HAPPENING AS
LAWMAKERS CALL FOR LIMITED
MILITARY RESPONSE, AND OTHER
WESTERN POWERS, INCLUDING
BRITAIN AND FRANCE EXPRESS GRAVE
CONCERN.

WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST.

WELL, I THINK IT IS OKAY FOR
PEOPLE TO TAKE VACATIONS.

BRITAIN'S FOREIGN SECRETARY SAYS
EVIDENCE OF THAT ATTACK MAY BE
GONE.

AMBASSADOR JOHN BOLTON, FORMER
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. AND FOX
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.

NOW YOU HAVE AN EVEN MORE
EGREGIOUS USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS AND HE THINKS HE NEEDS
TO DO SOMETHING, BUT HE CLEARLY
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT OR FOR WHAT
PURPOSE.

OF COURSE, WE HAVE BEEN DOWN
THAT ROAD BEFORE AS WELL.

CHAT ROOMS, THEY'RE SAYING
OUR NATION SHOULDN'T BE
INVOLVED, SOME OF THEM.

AND THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL WHERE
RUSSIA HAS A VETO.

THIS IS THINKING IN A EUROPEAN
WAY, WHO HAS AUTHORIZED ME TO DO
THIS, AS OPPOSED TO THINKING IN
THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN WAY,
WHO IS PROHIBITING ME FROM DOING
THIS.

THE SYRIAN REGIME PROBABLY
CLEANED UP THE SITES, MADE THEM
MBIGUOUS THAT
NOBODY CAN TELL WHO USE THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

INSPECTORS ARE SET TO VISIT THE
SITE OF THE ALLEGED CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

IT GIVES THE PRESIDENT THE
ABILITY TO SAY HE'S DONE
SOMETHING, PERHAPS SOME IN
AMERICA FEEL BETTER, BUT IN
TERMS OF DEGRADING THE ABILITY
OF THE SYRIAN ARMY TO ATTACK ITS
OWN PEOPLE IN THIS CIVIL WAR, I
DON'T THINK MUCH IS GOING TO
COME OUT OF IT.
