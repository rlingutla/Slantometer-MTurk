JESSE PRESIDENT TRUMP FINALLY
ENFORCING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S RED
LINE.

IT WAS ALSO AN INCREDIBLY
SOBERING MOMENT.

HARRIS PETER IS AT THE WHITE
HOUSE NOW WITH MORE ON THIS,
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS NOW TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER A SERIOUS
STRATEGY?

THAT HAS BEEN LINGERING, THAT IS
OUR COMPLETE MISSION.

THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD COME
TO CONGRESS AND TALK ABOUT THE
INTELLIGENCE, THE GOALS, THE END
STATE.

WHILE SPEAKING TODAY PEOPLE ARE
DIVIDED UP IT IS EASY TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT DROVE HIM.

THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE THE
ABILITY TO ACT.

THE PRESIDENT TOOK DECISIVE
ACTION AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT THAN THE
LAST ONE.

BUT, THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

STRIKES IN SYRIA ARE RAISING
QUESTIONS AMONG LAWMAKERS IN
WASHINGTON OVER WHAT ROLE WE
SHOULD PLAY IN THE SIX YEARS
CIVIL WAR GOING FORWARD.

DO YOU REALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE
THAT IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER YOU
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GIVE THE
PRESIDENT SUPPORT HE NEEDS?

I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,
THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU
ARE WORKING OFF A 16-YEAR-OLD
AUTHORIZATION OF MILITARY FORCE
TO GET THIS DONE.

WE ARE NOT SAY WE'RE THE ONES
WHO WILL AFFECT THAT CHANGE,
WE'RE SEEING OTHER COUNTRY HAVE
TO ASK THEMSELVES HARD
QUESTIONS, RUSSIA SHOULD ASK
THEMSELVES, WHAT ARE WE DOING
HERE.

HE BURIED THEM IN HIS WIFE WITH
HIS OWN HANDS, BUT CANNOT BEAR
TO PUT THEM IN THE GROUND,
GRIPPING THEM TILL THE BITTER
END.

YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL
FOR FLASHPOINT.

GETTING ASSAD OUT IS NOT ONLY
PART, WE HAVE TRYING TO DEFEAT
ISIS.

VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN,
SCOTT TAYLOR IS A MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE APPROPRIATION ON HOMELAND
SECURITY.

HARRIS WELL, AS EVERYONE CAN
APPRECIATE, YOU KNOW, WE NEARED
THAT LONGER HOUR DAY, IT IS
LIGHTER OUT.

BECAUSE CONGRESS IS SLOW TO
DEBATE AND THERE'S DIVERGING
INTEREST THERE, THERE THE
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVE.

I THINK THAT PRESIDENT HAS MADE
THE RIGHT MOVE BOTH IN SYRIA AND
IN KOREA.
