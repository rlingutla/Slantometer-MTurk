ANY IDEA TONIGHT IF AUTHORITIES
HAVE HEARD HER CALLS FOR HELP?

WE'RE MORE CONFIDENT IT WILL GO
OUT TO SEA.

WE HEADED SOUTH TO WHERE MARIA
MADE LANDFALL.

THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO WAVED HIM
IN, AND WHAT HE SAW WHEN HE WENT
INSIDE.

NEARLY EVERYTHING DESTROYED.

AND WE WILL STAY ON THE STORY OF
THAT NURSING HOME.

AN ISLAND WIPED OUT.

AND THERE ARE THE MODELS.

IN THE MEANTIME, ROB, WHERE IS
THE HURRICANE TONIGHT, AND ARE
THOSE MODELS NOW IN AGREEMENT
WHEN IT COMES TO THE EAST COAST
OF THE U.S.?

WE NEED WATER.

AND LATE TODAY, WORD THAT 1,000
MEDICAL STUDENTS, MANY OF THEM
AMERICAN, WHOSE CONDITION WAS
UNKNOWN, HAVE BEEN REACHED AND
ARE CONFIRMED SAFE.

THE POWER COMPANY USED CHERRY
PICKERS TO PLUCK RESIDENTS FROM
THEIR ROOFTOPS, FORCED TO WAIT
UNTIL THE FLOODWATERS RECEDED.

WATER, DIESEL, FOOD.

THE WOMAN WAVING OUR TEAM INSIDE
AND WHAT ROB FOUND.

WE NEED DIESEL FOR THE
GENERATOR.

ROADS RIPPED, HUGE TREES
UPROOTED, DEBRIS LITTERING THE
STREET.

DAVID, THE RESIDENTS WHO WERE
RESCUED FROM HERE ARE BEING
TAKEN BY A NEARBY SCHOOL, WHERE
THEY HAVE SET UP A SHELTER.

MILLIONS OF TREES OBLITERATED.

HOME TO 3.5 MILLION AMERICAN
CITIZENS.

WE TURN NEXT HERE TO THE
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE IN PUERTO
RICO.
