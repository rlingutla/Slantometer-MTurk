TWEETING "SYRIA IS NOT OUR
PROBLEM" WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
PROPOSED PROTECTING CIVILIANS.

THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
ASSAD REGIME CANNOT BE
TOLERATED.

WE JUST HEARD AMBASSADOR HALEY
SAY, AT TIMES WE'RE QUOTE,
COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN
ACTION.

BUT NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES HAVE
CHANGED HIS VIEWS ON THE ASSAD
REGIME.

MORE THAN 80 MEN, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN DYING.

WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.

WE DON'T KNOW.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
CHAIRED A MEETING OF HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

AND AS WE HEARD, THEY MET
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
TODAY.

SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
HAS CHANGED.

DOESN'T ACT THE U.S. MAY HAVE
TO.
