AND CHRISTOPHER ROYBAL, A NAVY
BIRTHDAY.

SO, IF THAT HERO IS WATCHING
TONIGHT, SHELDON'S FAMILY WANTS
TO THANK YOU.

IN THE ARM AND IN THE ABDOMEN.

SO, IT'S KIND OF JUST, LIKE,
HARD TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE DEAD FROM IT, TOO.

WE ARE SEEING INSIDE THE HOTEL.

HIM.

22,000 PEOPLE JOINING TOGETHER
FOR GOD BLESS AMERICA.

SUNDAY, THAT JOY TURNING TO
PANIC.

SHE HAD TO KNOW SOMETHING, AT
THE VERY LEAST, QUESTION HIM AS
TO WHERE ARE THESE WEAPONS
COMING FROM, WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL
THESE WEAPONS?

WHERE MORE THAN 100 VICTIMS WERE
RUSHED IN.

RIFLES ON THE FLOOR.

I THINK THAT'S THE HARD PART
FOR ALL OF US.

WHEN AT 1008 P.M., HIGH ABOVE
THE CROWDS, POLICE SAY PADDOCK
HAMMERED THROUGH TWO OF THE
HOTEL'S THICK WINDOWS AND
STARTED FIRING DOWN ON THE CROWD
BELOW.

SO, HAVE YOU CAUGHT YOUR BREATH
AT ALL?

HE SHUTTERED HIMSELF IN HIS
SUITE, TAKING IN ROOM SERVICE,
SAY POLICE, AS THE COUNTRY MUSIC
FESTIVAL KICKED OFF ON FRIDAY,
WAITING.

IT JUST KIND OF ALL HAPPENED
SO FAST.

AND JUST ONE HOUR LATER --
[ GUNFIRE ]
TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT
HOW 64-YEAR-OLD STEPHEN PADDOCK
PLANNED HIS ATTACK.

DOCS REALLY DID A GREAT
JOB.

AND WE BASICALLY JUST WENT BED
TO BED TO BED.

WE LEARNED LATE TODAY, ALL BUT
THREE HAVE NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED,
AND THESE ARE SOME OF THEIR
FACES.
