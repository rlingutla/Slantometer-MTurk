IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE
OLDER BROTHER'S WIFE IS IN
CUSTODY NOW, DO WE KNOW
ANYTHING?

I WANT TO SEE IF YOU HAVE
ANYTHING FROM THE SOURCES THAT
HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL NIGHT.

YOU KNOW, JUDGING FROM HIS
WOUNDS EARLIER ON TODAY AND
PROBABLY FROM THE FIRE FIGHT
THAT WENT ON.

CONDITION UNKNOWN, DIANE, BUT
OUR GUIDANCE IS THAT THE SUSPECT
IS IN CUSTODY.

A LOT OF THE S.W.A.T.

WE'VE ALL ACTUALLY BEEN UP SINCE
THAT TIME AND OVER THE COURSE OF
THE DAY TODAY IT KIND OF WANED.

AND MORE FROM THE MAYOR OF
BOSTON.

TALK ABOUT AN EARLIER
CONVERSATION THAT I COULD NOT
DISCLOSE.

AND HE SAID, "YEAH, SON, IT'S
OVER."

AND I REALLY DIDN'T FALL ASLEEP
AFTER THAT.

AT ONE POINT, A LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL HERE IN WASHINGTON WAS
LISTENING TO THE POLICE SCANNER
TRAFFIC AND THERE WAS A MOMENT
WHEN THE SUSPECT WAS NOT MOVING
AND THEN APPARENTLY SAT UP IN
THE BOAT.

WELL, AGAIN, IT RAISES THE
QUESTION, IF THERE WAS ANY
EXPLOSIVE AROUND THAT POLICE
WERE TRYING TO DETONATE.

WE THEN OVERHEARD THE POLICE
OFFICERS IN OUR BACKYARD TALKING
ABOUT THIS POKING HOLES THROUGH
THE PLASTIC.

"I HAVE NEVER LOVED THIS CITY
AND ITS PEOPLE MORE THAN I DO
TODAY.

YES END AND, AGAIN, WE WERE
TOLD EARLIER THAT THE GUN FIRE
SEEMS TO BEEN COMING FROM INSIDE
THE BOAT OUT AT POLICE, THAT
POLICE APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN,
THEY HAD SOME DEVICE, A ROBOTIC
DEVICE THAT COULD BE TIPPING THE
BOAT.

SO, NO INDICATION THAT HE WAS
IN SUCH GRAVE CONDITION THEY HAD
A DOUBT IF HE'D SURVIVE?

THERE WAS FEAR ENOUGH IN YOUR
HOUSE.

THIS IS A STAGGERINGRY
YOU'RE TELLING US.

AND ONE OF THOSE INDELIBLE
DETAILS ABOUT THE HUMANITY
INVOLVED IN WHAT HAS BEEN
HAPPENING IS, YOU SAY THE
NEIGHBORS HAD JUST BROUGHT HOME
A FOUR-DAY OLD INFANT?

AND AGAIN, WE HAD HEARD THAT
THE HANNEBURYS, SAW THE BOAT,
SAW BLOOD IN IT, WHICH INDICATED
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INJURED,
MAYBE IN SERIOUS CONDITION IN
THAT BOAT, BUT BRIAN ROSS, ARE
YOU HEARING THE SAME THING?
