WHAT CHANGED?

YOU BELIEVE THAT SYRIAN REFUGEES
SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE UNITED
STATES AS THEY ARE IN SO MANY
OTHER COUNTRIES.

PRESIDENT TRUMP DID NOT ALLOW
THE MOMENT TO PASS, SO I SUPPORT
HIS VERY MEASURED RESPONSE TO
THIS ATROCITY.

HAD HE COME TO CONGRESS FIRST,
WE WOULD KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS
BECAUSE A RESPONSE IS NOT A
STRATEGY.

WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT.

THE AGGRESSION OF THE U.S. ON
SYRIAN AIR FORCE TODAY IS A
PROOF THAT THE UNITED STATES IS
NOT INTENT ON FIGHTING TERRORISM
BUT HELPING TERRORISTS.

WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY AS
SAD IS CONTROLLING FATE HERE.

THAT'S WHAT THE CONSTITUTION
DEMANDS.

NIKKI HALEY IS HOLDING AN OPEN
DOOR MEETING INSTEAD.

THE MISSILE STRIKE ON SYRIA WAS
A MEASURED STEP.

IN GREEN, FUEL AND STORIES
RESERVOIRS.

IF IT IS AND THERE IS A STRATEGY
THAT IS BEHIND IT, THEN WE --
LET'S TALK.

WE'LL GET REACTION FROM AROUND
THE WORLD AND HEAR WHAT
LAWMAKERS FROM BOTH SIDES HAVE
TO SAY.

SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN MEMBERS
OF -- HAD FAMILY MEMBERS HERE
BUT THEY HAD BEEN VETTED FOR TWO
YEARS.

I ASKED FOR IT ALSO WHEN
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS
CONTEMPLATING UTILIZING MILITARY
FORCE.

IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY
OBJECT SYRIA, LET'S BE FRANK
ABOUT IT.

RUSSIA HAS BEEN POUNDING OUR
PROXIES INSIDE OF SYRIA, THE
SYRIAN MONITORS.

THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO IS
INVOLVED IN SETTING A VERY
BRIGHT -- YES, I'LL USE THE
EXPRESSION RED LINE IN SYRIA --
ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF ASSAD AND
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE AND U.N.

I BELIEVE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO VOTE WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON
DECIDED TO DO AIR STRIKES ON
BOSNIA.

BEYOND SYRIA, THE WHITE HOUSE
IS IN A NEW WORLD WITH RUSSIA,
IT WOULD APPEAR, ALONG WITH
IRAN, AL-ASSAD'S BIGGEST BACKER
ALONG WITH THE RUSSIANS.
