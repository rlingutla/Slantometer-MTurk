A GUT-WRENCHING LOOK AT THE
YOUNGEST VICTIM KILL IN THE
ATTACK.

BUT WHAT WE NORMALLY DO WE WILL
INCREASE SEARCHING AND MAKE SURE
WE HAVE MORE OFFICERS ON THE
STREET AND LOOKING AFTER PEOPLE
AND MAKING SURE THEY ARE SAFE.

IF TYLER IS OUT THERE OR
LISTENING.

YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THAT VIDEO
AND THE INDIVIDUALS.

YOU ARE LOOKING AT PHOTOS WE
RECEIVED JUST MINUTES AGO.

A CREW AND I WENT DOWN TO THE
SCENE JUST AS THE CREWS WERE
STARTING TO CLEAN UP.

THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOSE
THEIR LIFE RIGHT THERE AND THEN.

YOU HAVE THIS WHERE IT CAME FROM
WHO MADE IT THE TIME FRAME,
MAYBE IT WAS MADE TWO OR THREE
YEARS AGO AND THE PERSON HAS
BEEN HANGING ON FOR THAT LONG.

THEY PIECE IT BACK TOGETHER AND
THAT IS HOW THEY UNDERSTAND, THE
MODEL AND MAKE AND THAT KIND OF
INFORMATION THAT CAN ALLOW THEM
TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY THE
SOURCE OF PURCHASE.

THEY HAVE SEEN SO MANY BOMBS.

HE RELEASED A STATEMENT THANKING
PEOPLE FOR THE ATTENTION, BUT
THE SPOTLIGHT SHOULD INSTEAD BE
ON THE COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS WHO
DID WHATEVER THEY COULD TO SAVE
LIVES.

THESE, I AM TOLD, ARE VIDEOTAPE
FIRST IMAGES OF WHAT APPEARS TO
BE ONE OF THE BOMBS THAT
EXPLODED IN THE BOSTON MARATHON
YESTERDAY.

THESE ARE VERY VALUABLE PIECES
OF EVIDENCE WHICH I'M GETTING
WILL BE ICONIC PIECES.

DOCTORS HAD TO AMPUTATE WHAT WAS
LEFT OF HIS LEGS.

WHAT YOU CAN DO IS PUT YOUR
NAME ON A LIST.

NOW, IT'S A MATTER AS WE HEARD
GOING OUT AND FINDING IT.

HE CARRIED A WOMAN FROM THE
SCENE OF THE BLAST.

THIS WAS FIRST ON FOX THIS HOUR.

THOSE WILL BE HANDED OUT WHEN
THEY REGISTER TO GET THEIR
NUMBERS AND NOT SURPRISINGLY WE
ARE HEARING THERE IS A REVIEW OF
ALL SECURITY PROCEDURES FOR
SUNDAY'S MARATHON.

MOST OF INJURIES WERE TO THE
LEGS, LOWER EXTREMITIES BECAUSE
THE BLAST WENT ACROSS THE
GROUND.
