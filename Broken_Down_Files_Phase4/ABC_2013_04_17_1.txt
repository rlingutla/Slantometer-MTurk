CODE RED, EVACUATE THE
BUILDING.

WE'RE FIGHTERS.

AND HERE'S THE QUESTION --
HAS THE BOMBER BEEN SPOTTED
ON A SURVEILLANCE TAPE?

AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET
ANYONE PUSH US AROUND. YOU MESS WITH ONE OF US, YOU
MESS WITH ALL OF US.

AND THEY ARE MASTERS AT WHAT IS
KNOWN AS FACIAL RECOGNITION,
THE NEW SCIENCE OF CONVERTING A
FACE INTO A NAME, DEMONSTRATED
HERE BY AN INDIANA COMPANY THAT
WAS USED BY THE FBI FOLLOWING
THE 9/11 ATTACKS.

PEOPLE WERE GIVING US WATER,
FOOD, BLANKETS TO WRAP ON.

EXPERTS HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE
IMAGES.

THERE ARE WIRE FRAGMENTS WITH
MANUFACTURING NAMES, TINY NAILS
USED AS SHRAPNEL, AS WELL AS THE
MANGLED REMAINS OF THE PRESSURE
COOKER THAT AGENTS SAY WAS USED
TO BUILD THE BOMB, AND MAY WELL
HAVE FINGERPRINTS STILL ON IT.

I HAVE TO GIVE IT TO THE
BOSTONIANS.

♪
 THIS IS A CLOSE-KNIT PLACE,
THE CITY OF BOSTON.

THERE'S GOOD NEWS THERE
APPARENTLY THAT THEY HAVE SOME
FACES.

AUTHORITIES SAY THE FBI IS
FOCUSED ON PHOTOGRAPHS,
INCLUDING SOME TAKEN BY A
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA AT THE
LORD & TAYLOR STORE, THAT SHOW
A MAN IN THE RACE-DAY CROWD,
USING A CELLPHONE, WITH A BLACK
BAG STRAPPED ACROSS HIS CHEST
THAT AUTHORITIES SAY MAY CONTAIN
THE BOMB.

AS WE'VE HEARD THERE WAS
VIDEOTAPE EVERYWHERE AT THAT
MOMENT ON THAT DAY OF THE
MARATHON.

IT WAS A 747 THAT BLEW UP AT
ALTITUDE, SPREAD OVER A HUNDRED
SQUARE MILES.

ONE OF THE KEYS IN ANY TRIAL
IS LINKING THE EVIDENCE YOU HAVE
TO THE SUSPECT.

WE WILL NOT LET SOMEONE FORCE US
TO BE AFRAID OF OUR OWN SHADOW
IN THE CITY WE CALL HOME.

WE WANT TO BRING IN RICHARD
CLARK, WHO IS WAS A NATIONAL
COUNTERTERRORISM ADVISER AT THE
WHITE HOUSE UNDER TWO
ADMINISTRATIONS.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

WE WILL NOT BE PUSHED AROUND.

 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO WE
ARE, WHAT AMERICA IS, HOW WE
RESPOND TO EVIL, THAT'S IT.
