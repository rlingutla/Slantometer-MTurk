IF YOU WERE WATCHING OUR
SPECIAL COVERAGE YESTERDAY IN
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THIS
TORNADO, THEN YOU KNOW IT TOOK
ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO FOR A KIND
OF SICK FEELING TO ARRIVE IN
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

REMEMBER, WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH
AREAS LIKE THIS, THEY'RE WALKING
THROUGH HOME.

THIS COULD BE FROM 12 MILES
AWAY.

OKLAHOMA NATIONAL GUARD, MORE
THAN 200 SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN
CALLED TO DUTY.

WE THOUGHT THE DOOR WAS GOING TO
FLY OFF, AND THE MASSIVE DEBRIS
HIT.

THERE WERE TWO SCHOOLS THAT WERE
ACTUALLY IN THE DIRECT PATH OF
THIS TORNADO.

COULD YOU HEAR IT?

WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN YOU WERE
IN THERE?

WE HAVE TO HAVE BUILDINGS THAT
CAN SUSTAIN THE TYPE OF DAMAGE
THAT THEY'RE USED TO HERE,
OBVIOUSLY.

MILES OF DEVASTATION AFTER A
OUS TORNADO DECIMATED
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

JIM, YOU AND I WERE TALKING
BEFORE ABOUT A STATISTIC
THAT'S STARTING TO SURFACE TODAY
THAT THE SHEER ENERGY, THE
OUTPUT OF THIS STORM EQUALED THE
BOMB IGNITED IN HIROSHIMA.

BUT NATIONWIDE, ESPECIALLY
PEOPLE ON BOTH COASTS ARE ASKING
WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SHELTERS,
CELLARS, BASEMENTS?

YES, SIR.

I WAS DOWN IN TUSCALOOSA, AS
WERE YOU, AND AFTER THE 27,
APRIL 2011 OUTBREAK, WE SAW THEM
BUILD BACK HOMES FOR $75,000
WITH SAFE ROOMS.

THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH
US TONIGHT.

I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HER NAME.

WARREN PETERS ALREADY CLEANED UP
THEIR PARKING LOT.

WHAT DID YOU SAY?

AROUND THE CLOCK FRANTIC SEARCH
AFTER THE MASSIVE TWISTER.

COMMON IN OKLAHOMA BECAUSE THE
SOIL, HEAVY WITH CLAY AND WATER,
MAKES ANYTHING UNDERGROUND PRONE
TO FLOODING AND MOLD.
