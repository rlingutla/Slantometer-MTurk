IN 1976, THERE WAS A BOMB
USING A PRESSURE COOKER SET
BY CROATIAN SEPARATISTS
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK
CITY.

WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS, IT WAS MEANT TO
INSTILL TERROR AND FEAR AND
CHAOS.

MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT.

AN
EDUCATION AT BOSTON
UNIVERSITY AND WILL NEVER
RETURN HOME.

THERE IS A LOT OF
ANTICIPATION TRYING TO GET
THIS INFORMATION OUT FROM
FOX REPORTING FROM OUR
COLLEAGUE RICK LEVENTHAL A
COUPLE OF KEY PIECES OF
INFORMATION THAT
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING
AT TWO PERSONS OF INTEREST
THAT THEY HAVE PICTURES OF.

A CHINESE CITIZEN STUDYING
MATT AND STATISTICS AND
WATCHING THE RACE NEAR THE
FINISH LINE WHEN THE BOMB
EXPLODED.

HARD TO DEFECT.

SETTING A CITING A FLUID
INVESTIGATION BUT THE
NATIONAL TERRORISM CENTER
SET UP AFTER 9/11 TO ASSESS
THREATS AND SHARE THE
FINDINGS, TELLING A HANDFUL
OF LAWMAKERS THAT VIDEOS
AND PHOTOS LEADING UP TO
THE MOMENT ARE ALREADY
PROVIDING, QUOTE PROMISING
INTELLIGENCE ON THE CASE.

HIS NAME IS TYLER.

CRAIG BOSWELL ON THE
STREETS OF BOSTON TONIGHT.

FOX NEWS ASKED THE FBI
TO COMMENT ON THE STATUS OF
THE BOMB ANALYSIS BUT THERE
WAS NO IMMEDIATE RESPONSE,
YOU FROM WASHINGTON.

THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT
BULLETIN OBTAINED BY FOX
FROM FBI AND HOMELAND
SECURITY SENT TO LAW
ENFORCEMENT CONFIRMING ONE
BOMB WAS A PRESSURE COOKER
WITH SHRAPNEL INCLUDING
NAILS, B B AND BALL
BEARINGS.

THESE BAGS MATCH THE
DESCRIPTION THAT THE
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE
TOLD US ARE BELIEVED TO BE
CARRIED THE TWO BOMBS ON
MONDAY.

SHE SAID VICTORIA IS MY
NAME.

THEN WORD OF A BOMB THREAT
INSIDE -- INSIDE THE
COURTHOUSE, FORCING WORKERS
TO LEAVE.

IT'S CERTAINLY NOT.

SOME CRIME SCENE PHOTOS NOW
SPREADING OVER THE INTERNET
COULD HELP FEDERAL
INVESTIGATORS IN THEIR
SEARCH FOR A SUSPECT.

THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS
BATTERY SAYS IT'S VERY
COMMON.

SOME TALK THAT AN ARREST
HAD ALREADY HAPPENED.

IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
