BUT THERE IS NO FIRM
CONFIRMATION OF WHETHER THEY
WERE ACTUALLY EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
ALTHOUGH SOME OFFICIALS TONIGHT
SAY THERE IS REASON TO THINK
THAT SOME OF THEM WERE.

A BIT OF A CHAOTIC SCENE OUT
HERE.

THIS IS THE BACK BAY OF BOSTON.

PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOLD TO
SHELTER IN PLACE AND ONCE THEY
GO OUT, AVOID CROWDS WHICH IS
TRICKY ON THIS DAY WHICH IS A
HOLIDAY EVERY YEAR.

TO FINISH AT ALL YOU HAVE DONE
VERY WELL.

EMS WAS RUNNING TOWARD THE
SCENE.

THEN THE EXPLOSION RIGHT NEXT TO
THE FINISH LINE.

GET BACK, PLEASE!

TWO DIED.

WE KNOW THAT MUCH.

SUPER BOWL ORGANIZE OHHERS ARE
OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR TOO MUCH
SECURITY AT THE BIG GAME.

HERE WE ARE IN THE POST 9/11
ERA.

YOU'RE AT A MARATHON, ESPECIALLY
IN BOSTON WHERE THEY HAVEN'T HAD
ISSUES LIKE THEY HAVE HAD IN NEW
YORK, NOBODY WAS EXPECTING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN.

AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE APPARENTLY
WITH ADDED SHRAPNEL.

IT WAS A LOT OF THEM WITH LOST
LIMBS.

AFTER THE EXPLOSION THERE WERE
STREAMS OF PEOPLE WALKING THE
STREETS.

MARATHON RUNNERS AND SPECTATORS
VIOLENTLY INJURED.

SO HAVING SEEN THIS, HAVING
WITNESSED THIS, THE QUESTION
BECOMES HOW CAN WE EVER KEEP OUR
PUBLIC EVENTS SAFE IF SOMEONE
WAS ALLOWED TO GET TWO DEVICES
THIS CLOSE TO THIS CLASSIC A DAY
IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS?

AGAIN, HOW IRONIC THIS
HAPPENED AT WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE
MOST SECURE ZONE IN ALL OF
BOSTON ALONG THOSE 26 MILES
TODAY.

HEIGHTENING BASIC PREPAREDNESS,
PUTTING MORE POLICE ON THE
SCENE.
