THAT'S THE QUESTION.

RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CONFIRMED
FATALITY OF 37.

ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GONE,
INCLUDING TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS
WHERE CHILDREN HAD TO BE PULLED
OUT OF THE WRECKAGE.

IT MAY FIGURE THAT SOME OF THE
PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED THIS WERE
INDEED ABLE TO GET TO SHELTERS
AND THE OPPOSITE WAS NOT TRUE.

IT IS LIKE YOU SEE COMPLETELY
DESTROYED AS KIDS RUN UP TO
HOPEFULLY THEIR LOVED ONES.

GO GET AWAY FROM IT OR GO BELOW
GROUND.

WHERE DO YOU BEGIN ON SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

THERE ARE MILES OF DEVASTATION.

WE ARE JUST HOURS INTO THIS.

WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.

YOU CANNOT GET A CELL CALL IN OR
OUT.

IT IS ABOUT AN HOUR TO GET THOSE
TWO MILES.

LOCKED THE CELLAR DOOR WHEN WE
SAW IT COMING.

IT GOT LOUDER AND NEXT THING YOU
KNOW, YOU SEE THE LATCH COMING
UNDONE.

THE DOT YOU SAW ON SCREEN WITH
THE RADAR, THAT'S WHERE THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAS.

SEARCH AND RESCUE IS ONGOING AT
THIS POINT.

THAT'S ALL WE SEE HERE.

THAT ONE WAS MEASURED AT 302
MILES PER HOUR.

LET ME GO TO 315.
