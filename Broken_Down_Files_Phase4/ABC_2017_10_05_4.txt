YELLING AT THEM THAT THEY'RE
UNDER ATTACK.

BUT AS YOU BEGAN TO POINT OUT
RIGHT THERE, YOU HAVE LEARNED
WHAT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO RULE
THEY'RE STILL STUMPED, BUT
THEY'RE CERTAIN THEY WILL FIND
OUT A MOTIVE, SOONER OR LATER.

IT DOESN'T LOOK SO MUCH LIKE
THERE WAS A CONCERT THERE, BUT
AATTH
THOSE OVERTURNED LAWN CHAIRS,
WE'VE SEEN STROLLERS THERE,
WE'VE SEEN WALKERS THERE.

AND TONIGHT, OUR TEAM FLYING
BESIDE THE HOTEL AND OVER THE
MASSIVE CRIME SCENE WHERE THE
FBI IS STILL CAREFULLY COMBING
THROUGH THE EVIDENCE.

HELICOPTER HERE IN LAS VEGAS FOR
THE FIRST LOOK TONIGHT INTO
STEPHEN PADDOCK'S SNIPER'S NEST.

DON'T WALK!

EVIDENCE OF JUST THE ABSOLUTE
CHAOS.

WITH A BUMP STOCK, ASSAULT
RIFLES CAN FIRE HUNDREDS OF
ROUNDS PER MINUTE, CHANGING A
GUN FROM THIS TO THIS.

GO!

ALSO, GIVEN THE ARSENAL THAT HE
AMASSED, ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVE
MATERIALS AND THE FACT THAT HE
MAY HAVE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN,
THEY'RE NOW SAYING THAT THEY
CANNOT RULE OUT THAT HE HAD AN
ACCOMPLICE.

FOUND ON A DOZEN OF THE LAS
VEGAS SHOOTER'S WEAPONS, THOSE
BUMP STOCK ATTACHMENTS THAT
ALLOW A RIFLE TO FIRE LIKE A
MACHINE GUN.

HER LAWYER READ HER STATEMENT.

ALSO TONIGHT, WERE THERE TWO
OTHER CITIES THE GUNMAN WAS
LOOKING INTO?

WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THAT
OV TER TIME.

THE OTHER MAJOR HEADLINE
INVOLVES THE GIRLFRIEND, NOW
QUESTIONED BY THE FBI BACK HERE
IN THE U.S.
WHAT MARILOU DANLEY SAYS WHEN
ASKED IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING.

DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WOUNDED
PEOPLE WE CAN TAKE?

AND TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING
THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK MAY HAVE
SCOUTED OTHER TARGETS AS FAR
AWAY AS BOSTON AND CHICAGO.

FOUR DAYS LATER, STILL NO
MOTIVE.

DEMOCRATS, SOME REPUBLICANS AND
A SIGNAL TODAY FROM THE NRA ON
THIS?

ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED
EACH DAY.
