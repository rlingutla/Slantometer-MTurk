ATTACK AND
DO WE KNOW IF TODAY'S NEW
BOMBING BY SYRIA OF THAT TOWN
WHERE THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
OCCURRED WAS THAT RETALIATION?

IT'S JUST NOT OKAY TO GAS THEM.

THE FATHER OF BABY TWINS KILLED
BY THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THERE IS IRONY HERE THAT IT
DOES APPEAR THAT IT'S OKAY FOR
MR. ASSAD TO BLOW UP HIS PEOPLE.

I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ASKED
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
IF THE STRIKE SIGNALS A CHANGE
IN U.S. POLICY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDING AND
EXPLAINING THE DECISION NOT TO
BOMB THE RUNWAYS AND TONIGHT WE
HEAR FROM ONE OF THE MOST
VISIBLE VICTIMS FROM THE SYRIAN
ATTACK.

PLUS SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF FROM
THE AIRBASE HIT BY U.S.
MISSILES.

THIS STRIKE WAS RELATED
SOLELY TO THE MOST RECENT
HORRIFIC USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST WOMEN, CHILDREN AND AS
THE PRESIDENT SAID EVEN SMALL
BABIES.

WE DON'T WANT WORLD WAR III OVER
SYRIA.

THE BIG QUESTION, WILL SYRIA
RESPOND TO THE U.S.

BUT THE RUNWAYS UNTOUCHED.

WHETHER THAT SYRIAN ATTACK WAS
IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE
AMERICAN STRIKE WHICH PRESIDENT
ASSAD HAS CALLED AN UNJUST ACT
OF AGGRESSION BUT WE ARE SEEING
THE REACTION.

I TOLD THEM HELLO DARLINGS I
TOOK TOO LONG.

CRISIS IN SYRIA.

PERHAPS NO IMAGE MORE GUT
WRENCHING OF THIS ONE OF ABDUL
HAMEEM YOUSSEF HUGGING HIS
TWO LIFELESS
TWINS.

WE BEGIN
WITH NEW BOMBINGS BY PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL ASSAD ON HIS OWN
PEOPLE IN THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.

DIGGING DEEPER INTO THE DECISION
AROUND THAT STRIKE PLUS THE
BREWING CIVIL WAR INSIDE THE
WEST WING BETWEEN TWO OF THE
PRESIDENT'S TOP AIDES.

AND THAT TOWN BOMBED AGAIN TODAY
ACCORDING TO A WATCHDOG GROUP.

IT WAS A SLOW AND BRUTAL
DEATH FOR SO MANY.
