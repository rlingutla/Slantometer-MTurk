OPTIONS INCLUDE A NO-FLY ZONE TO
GROUND ASSAD'S AIR POWER.

THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT BOMBED
VILLAGES OUTSIDE DAMASCUS TODAY,
THE SAME VILLAGES HIT YESTERDAY
BY WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WAR CRIME.

TONIGHT THE CLAIMS OF A CHEMICAL
ATTACK HAVE STILL NOT BEEN
VERIFIED.

THERE IS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF
THE TUNNEL.

AN OUTRAGE.

THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT.

JUST LIFELESS BODIES, THEIR ARMS
FOLDED.

THIS IS BABY 11 FROM THE VILLAGE
OF DUMA, THE NUMBER WRITTEN ON A
BURIAL SHROUD.

NEAR IT, DEAD BODIES.

BUT HOW CAN ANYONE FAKE ROWS OF
DEAD CHILDREN?

WHAT ABOUT A MILITARY INVASION?

A SYRIAN CAMERAMAN CONTRACTED BY
OUR PARTNER ITN FILMED PEOPLE
LOOKING AT AN EXPLODED ROCKET.

THERE IS STILL NO DEFINITIVE
PROOF THAT CHEMICAL WEAPONS WERE
USED OR BY WHOM.

NO BLOOD.

EXPENSIVE AND A LONG-TERM
COMMITMENT, NOT ACTIVELY BEING
CONSIDERED.

HUNDREDS KILLED BY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THE REBELS SAY, MANY OF
THEM BURIED TODAY IN MASS
GRAVES.

AND AGAIN, THESE IMAGES ARE
GRAPHIC.

NBC NEWS HAS NO WAY TO CONFIRM
THAT THE CASUALTIES WERE CAUSED
BY THIS WEAPON.

THEY ARE UNCONFIRMED BY NBC
NEWS, BUT THEY ARE CONSISTENT
WITH THE ACCOUNTS OF WITNESSES
WE SPOKE TO.

NO APPARENT INJURIES.
