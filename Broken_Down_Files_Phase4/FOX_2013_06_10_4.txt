WE WANT TO TARGET TEA PARTY
MEMBERS.

AND LATE TODAY THE
POWERFUL CHAIR OF THE
SENATE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE DIANE DIANNE
FEINSTEIN CONFIRMING HER
COMMITTEE IS GETTING A
SIMILAR BRIEFING ALSO CLOSE
TO THE PUBLIC ON THURSDAY.

THE KEY IS GETTING TO
SNOWDEN BEFORE HE LEAKS
AGAIN AND BEIJING
INTERROGATES HIM.

YOU EITHER GIVE THEM WHAT
THEY WANT OR CONCEIVABLY
ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.

EVERY PLACE HE TOUCHED THE
SYSTEM ELECTRONICALLY,
TERMINALS, ACCOUNTS.

WELL, KUCINICH VOTED
AGAINST THE PATRIOT ACT.

SENATOR RAND PAUL TOLD "FOX
NEWS SUNDAY" HOST CHRIS
WALLACE HE WILL ASK PHONE
COMPANIES AND INTERNET
PROVIDERS TO INVITE THEIR
CUSTOMERS TO JOIN HIM IN
THE LEGAL CHALLENGE.

BUT ONE CONGRESSMAN CALLS
HIM A DEFECTOR WHO SHOULD
PAY THE PRICE FOR PUTTING
AMERICANS IN DANGER.

THE CONSULATE HERE IN HONG
KONG, I'M SURE THEY ARE
GOING TO BE VERY BUSY FOR
THE NEXT WEEK AND THAT'S A
FEAR I WILL LIVE UNDER FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE
HOWEVER LONG THAT HAPPENS
TO BE.

NEIGHBORS IN HAWAII SAY THE
COUPLE MADE SURE THAT
NOBODY COULD SEE INSIDE
THAT HOME EVERYTHING WAS
COMPLETELY BLOCKED.

THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT
AGAINST WHAT PAUL CALLS THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S BIG
GOVERNMENT INTRUSION MAKES
A GREAT POLITICAL
ORGANIZING TOOL OVER THE
NEXT FOUR YEARS.

DRAKE SAYS THE CHOICE OF
HONG KONG MAKES A LOT OF
SENSE BECAUSE IT SHOWS
SNOWDEN WANTED TO BE AS FAR
OUT OF REACH OF THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT AS POSSIBLE,
PROGRAMS, CATHERINE IT
SOUNDS LIKE LAWMAKERS ARE
ABOUT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT
THEM.

EVERYTHING WILL BE
AVAILABLE.

RAND PAUL IS A G.O.P.

29-YEAR-OLD EDWARD SNOWDEN
SAYS THAT'S EXACTLY WHY HE
EXPOSED THE GOVERNMENT'S
PHONE AND EMAIL
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS.

HE SAYS HE WORKED AS A
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
OFFICE IN HAWAII AS AN
EMPLOYEE OF A GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTOR.

AL QAEDA AND ITS
AFFILIATES NOW KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT WE ARE DOING.

IT DROPPED SOME A% AT THE
START OF TRADING AND ENDED
THE DAY DOWN.

SNOWDEN SAYS HE LEFT HIS
GIRLFRIEND BEHIND IN HAWAII
AND TOOK OFF FOR HONG KONG
THREE WEEKS AGO AFTER
COPYING THE DOCUMENTS HE
PLANNED TO RELEASE.

I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO
SITS THERE DAY TO DAY IN
THE OFFICE, WATCHES WHAT'S
HAPPENING AND GOES, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OUR
PLACE TO DECIDE.
