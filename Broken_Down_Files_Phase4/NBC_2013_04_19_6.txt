HERE ARE FOLKS TOLD A HALF HOUR
BEFORE THE GUNSHOTS IT'S OKAY TO
COME OUT.

WE DON'T KNOW.

THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO
LIBERATED THEIR TOWN IN EFFECT.

GREAT NEWS, STEVE.

UNBELIEVABLE, AS ONE SAID WHO'S
BEEN FOLLOWING THIS.

MICHAEL LEITER WHO WAS, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, IN THE ROOM THE
NIGHT OF THE BIN LADEN RAID WHEN
IT WAS PLANNED AND ORDERS
CARRIED OUT FROM THE SITUATION
ROOM.

ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL THE
VEHICLES, FIRST RESPONDERS, LAW
ENFORCEMENT START COMING OUT.
LISTEN TO THAT.

THERE IS A CHANGE IN MOOD,
STANCE AND DEMEANOR THERE.

AUTOMATIC WEAPONS DRAWN.

IS HE GRAVELY WOUNDED, WALKING?

FOLK IN WATERTOWN WHO WERE
FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ALL DAY
AND ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN SEEING
THE KIDS LOOKING AT THE
GROWN-UPS IN THEIR LIVES AND THE
GROWN-UPS WERE TOLD DON'T COME
TO THE DOOR UNLESS YOU ARE
CERTAIN IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT.

THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.

THEY WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THIS
INDIVIDUAL EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO
SURRENDER.

THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL INTEND TO
DO.

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE IS THEY
WILL TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY.

STEVE, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

THERE ARE FIVE CARS HEADED UP.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CONDITION
HE'S IN.

HE IS IN CUSTODY.

THEN THE FBI PROCEEDED TO
QUESTION HIM AT LENGTH.
