LOOK AT THAT.

THE STORM HIT THE ISLAND AS A
CATEGORY FOUR STORM, 155 MILES
AN HOUR SUSTAINED WINDS.

UP HERE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST.

MARIA IS BRINGING CATASTROPHIC
FLOODING TO PUERTO RICO.

A COUPLE OF FEET OF FLOODING
AROUND THESE APARTMENTS.

FORECASTERS SAY MARIA REGAINED
MAJOR HURRICANE STATUS AS IT
MOVED OFF THE COAST OF THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC TODAY.

STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN WITH
MORE.

AS LONG AS WE THREAT THIS NEEDLE
BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE EAST
COAST, I THINK WE'LL BE LOOKING
GOOD.

KEEPING THIS WELL OFFSHORE AND
THEN EVENTUALLY BY THURSDAY TO
FRIDAY OUT TO SEE.

IT'S GOING TO ALLOW MARIA TO
MOVE TO THE NORTH.

HURRICANE MARIA ROARING ACROSS
THE CARIBBEAN NOW LEAVING BEHIND
ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION.

WITHOUT HELP QUICKLY, THAT COULD
STEVE HARRIGAN IN SAN JUAN.

WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHITE
SPREAD DAMAGE IN ST. CROIX AND
THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.

CERTAINLY BEACH EROSION.

RESCUE WORKERS TODAY DEALING
WITH DOWNED STREETS AND FLOODING
STREETS AS THEY TRY TO REACH
VICTIMS THAT NEED HELP.

WE'VE SEEN A HYDRANT USED AS A
BATH THIS MORNING, SHEPARD.

WINDS SO POWERFUL, THEY RIPPED
CONCRETE BALCONIES OFF OF WALLS
AND NOW MARIA HEADED FOR THE
TURKS AND CAICOS AND THE
BAHAMAS.

IT'S A SLOW-MOVING STORM.

THE SAME AREA, AMBULANCES
TRAPPED UNDER THE COLLAPSED
ROOF.

THE STORM DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF
HOMES AND KNOCKED OUT
ELECTRICITY TO THE ISLAND AND
BROUGHT DOWN CELL PHONE TOWERS
AND LEAVING MOST PEOPLE UNABLE
TO CALL FOR HELP OR CALL FOR
FAMILY MEMBERS.
