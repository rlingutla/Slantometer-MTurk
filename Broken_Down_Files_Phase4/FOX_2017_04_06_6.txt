THE LAST COUPLE DAYS, THERE WAS
VIDEO OF A CHEMICAL ATTACK, A
SARIN GAS ATTACK, ONE
PERPETRATED BY BASHAR AL-ASSAD
HIMSELF AND IT APPEARS THE
POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS
CHANGED IN AN ENORMOUS WAY.

WORDS CATEGORY.

A WOMAN THAT FELL 60 FEET TO THE
GROUND WHILE TAKING A SELFIE ON
A BRIDGE IS NOT LIKELY TO FACE
CHARGES.

THE PRESIDENT CAME BACK TO THE
PRESS CABIN IN THE REAR RIGHT
SIDE OF AIR FORCE ONE TO TALK
ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
THINGS.

THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY IS
MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND THE
REST OF THE WORLD IS WATCHING
BECAUSE ALL OF THE OPTIONS ARE
BAD OPTIONS.

THAT MEANS THE UNITED STATES
WITH SYRIAN REBELS AGAINST THE
SYRIANS, THE RUSSIANS AND THE
IRANIANS THAT SUPPORT HEZBOLLAH.

THIS IS AS THE SECRETARY SAYS
THERE'S NO DOUBT THE REGIME OF
BASHAR AL-ASSAD IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CHEMICAL ATTACK THIS
WEEK ON HIS OWN CITIZENS.

THEY ARE THERE FIGHTING AGAINST
ISIS.

HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES GO IT
ALONE AGAINST THE RUSSIANS
SUPPORTING ASSAD'S REGIME?

THEY DROPPED BARREL BOMBS FROM
THE SKY AND MURDERS CHILDREN IN
THEIR BEDS ON A DAILY BASIS.

RUSSIA IS A KEY ALLY OF
AL-ASSAD.

ORGANIZING A COALITION FOR
SYRIA.

OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL ON THAT SAME LINE."

THE PRESIDENT TALKING TO THE
PRESS ABOUT SYRIA.

THE UNITED STATES TRYING TO GET
A COALITION FOR A POLITICAL
FRAME WORK FOR THAT TO HAPPEN
SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD.

IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT, WE HAVE A
MINUTE OF OTHER HEADLINES.

THE TRAGEDY THAT IS PART OF THE
SYRIAN CONFLICT.

WE HAVE UNITED STATES FORCES ON
THE GROUND.

NOW 30 MINUTES AGO WE LEARNED
THE UNITED STATES IS PREPARING
TO TAKE ACTION.
