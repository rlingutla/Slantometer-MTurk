FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF JOHN GLENN
GATHERING IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL
CEMETERY TO SAY THEIR FINAL
GOOD-BYES.

NOW AS A PATTERN BY AL-ASSAD
CONTINUES, THIS PRESIDENT HAS
MADE ANOTHER DECISION.

RIGHT.

IN THE SENDER IS BASHAR
AL-ASSAD.

IT IS A PERILOUS SET OF
CIRCUMSTANCES NOW.

THEY'LL BE FORCED.

ALTHOUGH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THEY'RE
WORKING ON SOME PLAN TO DO
SOMETHING EXTREMELY BOLD, AS A
FEW DAYS AGO, THEY HAD NO PLAN
IN PLACE AND NO INTENTIONS LIKE
THIS.

NEWS CHANNEL AND MUCH MORE ON
SECRETARY TILLER SEASON.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAYS
THAT STEPS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THE
UNITED STATES TO LEAD AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
REMOVE BASHAR AL-ASSAD FROM
POWER.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT
THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
RESPOND.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE
ANNOUNCING THAT STEPS ARE
UNDERWAY TO FORM AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO
REMOVE THE MURDEROUS SYRIAN
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

I WAS CRITICAL AT THE TIME THEY
DID THAT.

AND NOW VLADIMIR PUTIN IS
ACCUSING PRESIDENT TRUMP OF
RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

THERE'S NO QUESTIONING THIS.

THE RUSSIANS AND THE IRANIANS
ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE.

THAT WAS THE DECISION OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE
HORRIBLE IMAGES FROM THIS WEEK'S
ATTACK MADE HIM CHANGE HIS
ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD.

HIS RESPONSE TO THAT WAS THAT IT
IS UP TO THE SYRIAN PEOPLE TO
DECIDE THE LONG-TERM FUTURE OF
BASHAR AL-ASSAD.

WE HAVE 900 SPECIAL FORCE
THERE'S ALREADY IN HARM'S WAY.

THEY'RE ACCUSED OF HAVING TIES
TO THE SUICIDE BOMBER THAT
KILLED 13 OTHERS ON MONDAY.
