WE ARE GETTING BACKGROUND
INFORMATION OF GREAT
INTEREST TO ME.

WE HAD SHOOTOUT, A FIRE
FIGHT LAST NIGHT WITH
POLICE RESULTING IN SUSPECT
NUMBER 1' DEMISE AS IT
TURNED OUT AS HE WAS GUNNED
DOWN.

TALKING TO A FEW NEIGHBORS.

FAMILIES BEING ESCORTED.

FAST FORWARD NOW TO JUST A
FEW MINUTES BEFORE 700
TONIGHT IN WATERTOWN
MASSACHUSETTS WHERE SHOTS
RANG OUT.

SOMEONE HAD ASKED ME THAT
BEFORE.

IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A
GUNSHOT TO ME.

LIKE THERE IS AMBULANCES
AND NEIGHBORS AND IT WAS
JUST CRAZY BECAUSE THE
WHOLE SERIES HAS BEEN UP IN
THE EAST END AND THIS IS
JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM
WHERE WE LIVE.

I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE A
CAMERA ON THERE.

CAN YOU SEE THAT TRAILER IN
THE BACKYARD.

35 MINUTES AGO ON THE
STREETS OF WATERTOWN.

SWAT TEAM SURROUNDED HIM.

WE'RE TOLD THEY HAD
IMPROVISED GRENADES AS WELL
AND HURLED THOSE TOWARDS
THE VEHICLE.

THEY CAME OUT TO HEAR THE
GUNSHOTS FIRED.

AND IT'S REALLY QUIET ON
SCENE RIGHT NOW.

STANDOFF ENDED AND THE CAR
CAME TO A STOP.

TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

I HAVEN'T
IT LOOKS LIKE FROM WHAT I'M
LOOKING AT, IT LOOKS LIKE.

NO.

THERE IS A DOOR TO THE SHED
OPEN.
