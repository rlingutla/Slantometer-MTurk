AND I MEAN LARGE.

FORTUNATELY, THOUGH, THE DAMAGE
THAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT IS TO
THINGS AND NOT PEOPLE AND THAT
IS THE BLESSING IN ALL OF THIS
BECAUSE IT DID HAPPEN EARLY IN
THE DAY.

TODAY YOU WERE DOING SUCH
ONSIDE OF A TORNADO SHELTER.

CONTINUES TO BE ON THE GROUND
AND THIS TORNADO MEANS BUSINESS
AND IT IS COMING RIGHT TO YOUR
HOMETOWN IF YOU LIVE IN ADELOT.

AND IN JUST THE LAST HOUR OR SO
WE HAVE SEEN MOST OF THOSE GET
INTO THE WARNING CATEGORY WHICH
MEANS IT IS HIGHLY POSSIBLE FOR
TWISTERS TO DROP OUT OF THE
SKY.

ON DOWN TO WHATEVER THE HECK
THEY ARE HITTING ON THE GROUND.

TELL US WHERE?

IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.

NOT ONLY CONFINED TO OKLAHOMA
AND KANSAS BUT STEP UP TOWARDS
THE UPPER MIDWEST THROUGH THE
EVENING HOURS.

SOUTH AND EAST OF OKLAHOMA
CITY.

WE ARE LISTENING IN NOW TO
OUR FOX 25 IN OKLAHOMA CITY AND
YOU ARE LISTENING TO THEM TALK
WITH SOME OF THE STORM SPOTTERS
THAT THEY HAVE OUT THERE
GATHERING VIDEO.

YOU MENTIONED THE HEAVILY
POPULATED AREAS.

I WANT TO ASK WHY IS IT JUST
IN THE LAST LITTLE WHILE THIS
HAS GOTTEN WORSE.

I CAN HEAR IT.

HEAVY RAIN AND THE RISK FOR
TORNADOES.

AND OUR PRAYERS FOR THOSE
PEOPLE THAT THEY STAY SAFE
TONIGHT.

WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE A JUMP
BACK STORMBACK IN THE AREA.

HE TOLD THAT GUY DRIVING THIS
CAR.

THAT IS WHAT IS REALLY ALARMING
WITH THESE.

AS THOSE SYSTEMS COLLIDE.
