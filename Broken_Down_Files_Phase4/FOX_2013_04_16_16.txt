I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU,
SHEPARD, I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION OFF AIR.

LOOKING AT ALL THE MATERIALS,
TRYING TO TRACE THEM BACK TO THE
SOURCE AND HELPING THEM TRACE TO
WHOEVER BOUGHT THEM AND PUT THEM
TOGETHER.

I WAS THERE WHEN THE OKLAHOMA
BOMBING HAPPENED AND I DON'T
THOUGHT, SOMEHOW IN THE
AFTERMATH OF ALL THIS, WE'RE
BETTER PEOPLE.

PICTURES FROM THE SCENE COULD BE
CRUCIAL.

WHAT WAYS TOLD BY VETERANS,
THEY KNOW HOW THE BOMB WAS
BUILT.

DIFFICULT.

IT BRINGS EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

THEY CAN FOLLOW THAT UP.

STEVE CENTANNI IS LIVE IN
TIGHTENED IN MANY PLACES ACROSS
THE COUNTRY.

IN BOSTON THAT WORKED ALL NIGHT
LONG WITH NO REST TO SAVE LIVES
OF THE VICTIMS.

WE'RE NOT SHOWING YOU WORST PART
WHAT THE BLAST DID TO A MAN'S
LEG.

THERE IS A DNA ON THERE, THEY
KNOW IT.

A GRAVELY INJURED MAN IN A
WHEELCHAIR, THEY RAN AS LIVE
DURING STUDIO "B" AND CAME
ACROSS OUR ON MONITORS IN THE
STUDIO.

WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO GO?

KATHERINE, THE FIRST PICTURES OF
THE REMAINS OF THIS BOMB, WHAT
SOURCES ARE SEE SAYING WHAT SORT
OF EVIDENTIARY VALUE.

INVESTIGATORS HAVE INDICATED
WHOEVER CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK
DID USE PRESSURE COOKERS TO
CONSTRUCT THE BOMBS.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS PHOTO, THE
FIRST PICTURE SHOWS WHAT LOOKS
LIKE A BAG OR A BOX ON THE
STREET SIDE OF A METAL BARRICADE
SITTING ON THE CURB.

THEY IDENTIFY THE SOURCE AND
THEN TRY AND IDENTIFY WHO
PURCHASED IT.

9 CAMERA VIEWS THAT YOU SAW ALL
DAY YESTERDAY AND TODAY IS WHERE
THE FINISH LINE WAS WHERE SOME
5,000 PEOPLE NEVER MADE IT

THE DOCTORS SAID TODAY MANY OF
THOSE WHO WOKE UP AFTER SURGERY
STUNNED TO BE ALIVE SAID HOW
HAPPY THEY WERE MISSING LIMBS
AND EXCITED FOR ANOTHER DAY.
