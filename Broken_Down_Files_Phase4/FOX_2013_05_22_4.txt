THE WORK THAT THEY HAVE
AHEAD IS WEEKS AND MONTHS.

MONDAY'S TWIST ERR NOT ONLY
WIPED AWAY HOMES AND
SCHOOLS BUT MANY
BUSINESSES.

THEY SAY THAT THEY REBUILT
IN 1999.

THE CHILDREN INSIDE HUDDLED
WITH THEIR TEACHES A THE
STORY GOES AND THE SCHOOL
CRASHED TO THE GROUND
AROUND THEM.

I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE OKAY.

ABOVE THE SCHOOL ON WHICH
WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING FOR
THE PAST 48 HOURS.

HE WILL TAKE US ON A LIVE
DRIVING TOUR WITH MAWLT
PELL CAMERAS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

THIS GARAGE COMPLETELY
STANDING BUT YOU CAN SEE
THAT THE HOME AND ALL OF
THE DEBRIS IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE HOME IS JUST ALL STREWN
ABOUT.

THE RESOLVE OF THESE
PEOPLE.

IN SOME OF THESE AREAS YOU
WILL SEE BLUE TARPS ON TOP
OF HOUSE AFTER HOUSE.

THE WINDS GET STRONGER AND
WEAKER AS THE STORM MOVES
ALONG LIKE ANYTHING ELSE
IT PICKS UP ENERGY AND IN
SPURTS IT WILL BE STRONGER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

IT IS A BROKEN LINE OF
OBLITERATION.

THE CAMERAS WON'T BE AS
PREVALENT.

TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
PICTURES OF THE RUBBLE.

HOW ABOUT THAT.

OKLAHOMANS TELL US THEY
CAN.

THEY CRAWLED OUT FROM UNDER
THE TABLE I COUNTED THEM AS
THEY CAME OUT.

THE NOTICE WON'T BE AS
GREAT AND FRANKLY THEY WILL
JUST BE LEFT WITH A
HERCULEAN TASK OF FIGURING
OUT HOW TO GET THEIR LIVES
BACK TOGETHER.

MANY PATIENTS ARE STILL IN
SEVERAL AREA HOSPITALS.

BUT THOSE ARE THE BRAVEST
LITTLE CHILDREN IN THE
WORLD.
