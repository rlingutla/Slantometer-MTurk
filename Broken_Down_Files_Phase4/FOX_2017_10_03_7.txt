THIS VIDEO WHERE THE CONCERT
TOOK PLACE, STILL SHUT DOWN TO
THE MEDIA AND THERE'S STILL
INVESTIGATORS CRAWLING ALL OVER
THIS PLACE TRYING NOT TO DISTURB
THE EVIDENCE BY WEARING BOOTIES.

EACH ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN
LAS VEGAS HAS HIS OR OWN STORY.

THE MONEY MAY HAVE GONE TO HIS
GIRLFRIEND AND THEY'RE STILL
LOOKING INTO IT AND HAVE NOT
CONFIRMED THAT.

AT THE HOTEL, THEY WERE STILL ON
SCENE PROCESSING THE WEAPONS AND
THE AMMUNITION.

WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT EVERY CAR
HAS TO MATCH UP TO A CERTAIN
PERSON.

AS WE ALL KNOW, SOME OF THESE
CARS WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY
THEIR OWNERS.

FROM AN IRAQ WAR VETERANS TO
CIVILIAN PARAMEDICS THAT FOUND
THEMSELVES UNDER FIRE, WE'LL
MEET THE HEROS OF LAS VEGAS.

WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GUN LAWS.

HE SAID I'M SORRY FOR THE HURT
AND PAIN EVERYONE IS FEELING
RIGHT NOW.

THAT CAN BE EASILY CORRECTED.

THE SWAT TEAM BROKE DOWN THE
DOOR WITH EXPLOSIVES TO GET TO
THE GUNMAN ALREADY TO FIND OUT
HE ALREADY KILLED HIMSELF.

YOU CAN SEE THE BREACHED DOOR
ITSELF THERE COVERED WITH THE
YELLOW POLICE TAPE.

SCENE.

EVERYONE I SPEAK TO ABOUT
THIS CASE, SHEP, TALKS ABOUT IT
AS BEING AN ANOMALY.

THERE'S A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.

SO WHAT ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW
WITH THE GIRLFRIEND'S FAMILY?

TWO OF THESE MEMBERS WERE SHOT
WHILE PERFORMING CPR.

WE'RE LOOKING INTO HIM VERY
SERIOUSLY.

IF YOU LEAVE THE CAR, LOOK
AROUND THE GROUND AND THERE'S
BLOOD PRINTS ALL THE WAY OUT
HERE.

THEY THINK IT WAS TO THE
PHILIPPINES BUT THERE'S
CONFUSION OVER HER LOCATION AND
WHETHER SHE'S IN JAPAN.
