THEY DIDN'T USE THEM.

WHAT THE WORLD WAS WAITING FOR
NEXT, WAS WORD FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT
GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES MANY,
MANY LINES, BEYOND A RED LINE.

THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNING THE
ATTACK, CALLING IT QUOTE, AN
AFFRONT TO HUMANITY.

WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAYING THAT SYRIA CROSSED
NOT ONLY A RED LINE, BUT SEVERAL
LINES.

BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE TELLING YOU.

THE GRAPHIC IMAGES SEEN AROUND
THE WORLD.

WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS I
THINK YOU'VE NOTICED ABOUT ME IS
MILITARILY, I DON'T LIKE TO SAY
WHERE I'M GOING AND WHAT I'M
DOING.

FOR AMERICANS AT HOME TONIGHT
WONDERING WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN,
WHAT'S NEXT?

BUT DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF TIME
LINE FOR POSSIBLE ACTION HERE?

PREDECESSOR, IS PROMISING TO
TAKE ACTION.

HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE
TO DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?

IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
ME.

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN FRONT OF THE WORLD ON
SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL ASSAD, ON
THE APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK
THAT KILLED SO MANY FAMILIES AND
CHILDREN.

AND I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK
ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY, HAD A BIG
IMPACT ON ME.

WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE?

THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

DO THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER
ATTACKS?

THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR HE
WON'T SAY WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.
