ACTIVISTS SAY THIS IS AMATEUR
VIDEO OF SYRIA SHELLING THE SAME
AREA AGAIN TODAY.

OPPOSITION FORCES CLAIM THE
GOVERNMENT KILLED HUNDREDS OF
ITS OWN PEOPLE IN A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK OUTSIDE DAMASCUS.

THIS IS WHERE STRONG AMERICAN
REACTION CAN DETER HIM, BUT THAT
STRONG AMERICAN REACTION RIGHT
NOW SEEMS SOME WAY OFF.

AND A THREAT OF POSSIBLE FORCE
AGAINST SYRIA AFTER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK REPORTEDLY KILLED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING
CHILDREN.

THOSE INSPECTORS, THE UNITED
NATIONS ONES ALREADY IN
DAMASCUS, AS YOU SAID, SHEP,
JUST 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE
SCENE OF THE ALLEGED ATTACK, BUT
UNABLE TO GET THERE WITHOUT
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE,
NOT FORTHCOMING RIGHT NOW.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS A YEAR
AGO THAT THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WOULD BE A RED LINE IN
SYRIA.

NOW, THE UNITED NATIONS AND
SECRETARY-GENERAL HAS ALSO
CALLED FOR AN URGENT
INVESTIGATION.

WE ARE UNABLE TO CONCLUSIVELY
DETERMINE CW USE, BUT WE'RE
FOCUSED ON DOING EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE WITHIN OUR POWER TO
NAIL DOWN THE FACTS.

U.S. OFFICIALS ARE REFUSING TO
POINT FINGERS DESPITE THE VIDEO
AND ALL THE EVIDENCE.
