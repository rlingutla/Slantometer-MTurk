WE COULDN'T DO IT EVEN IF WE
WANTED TO.

WHILE THE U.S. DIRECTOR OF
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN AN
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH NBC
NEWS IS DISPUTING SOME OF HIS
CLAIMS.

I ASSURE YOU, WE DON'T WANT TO.

I CERTAINLY SITTING AT MY
DESK HAD THE AUTHORITY TO
WIRETAP ANYONE FROM YOU, YOUR
ACCOUNTANT, TO A FEDERAL JUDGE,
OR EVEN THE PRESIDENT IF I HAD A
PERSONAL E-MAIL.

THAT, INFER THAT THERE HAS BEEN
A REFERRAL TO TRACK DOWN THE
LEAK?

EVEN MORE WILL BE STORED IN THIS
NEW FACILITY IN UTAH, ALL LEGAL
SINCE 2008, RE-AUTHORIZED BY
CONGRESS IN 2012 AND REVIEWED
EVERY THREE MONTHS BY A SECRET
COURT.

DAMAGE THAT THESE REVELATIONS
INCUR ARE HUGE.

THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, FOR
WHATEVER REASON, HAS CHOSEN TO
VIOLATE A SECRET TRUST FOR THIS
COUNTRY.

NOW IN AN NBC NEWS EXCLUSIVE, A
VIGOROUS DEFENSE FROM THE
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE.

"THE GUARDIAN" PULLED THE COVERS
OFF AN ONGOING U.S. INTELLIGENCE
PROGRAM THAT'S QUIETLY COLLECTED
THE PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS IN THE NAME OF
NATIONAL SECURITY.

CRITICS SAID TODAY MORE
OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED.

I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO SITS
THERE DAY TO DAY IN THE OFFICE
WATCHES WHAT'S HAPPENING AND
GOES, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S
NOT OUR PLACE TO DECIDE.

BUT AT WHAT PRICE?

THIS SUNDAY NIGHT --
NATIONAL SECURITY.

CONFIRMED HE WORKED FOR THE
COMPANY LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

CONTRADICTED BY WHAT THE
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE TOLD US EXCLUSIVELY
ON SATURDAY.

THE NOTION THAT WE'RE TROLLING
THROUGH EVERYONE'S E-MAILS AND
VOYEURISTICALLY READING THEM OR
LISTENING TO EVERYONE'S PHONE
CALLS IS, ON ITS FACE, ABSURD.

I'M 29 YEARS OLD.

WATCHING AND WAITING.

THEY SAID IF THE REPORTS ARE
ACCURATE ABOUT THE LEAKS THEY
ARE SHOCKED AND THEY WOULD WORK
CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHORITIES ON
THE INVESTIGATION.
