THIS MASSIVE ONE RECORD
THROUGH MOORE AND SOUTH
OKLAHOMA CITY THIS
AFTERNOON.

REALLY WANT I WANT TO GET
OUT OF OF THE WAY AND GET
BACK TO IT I'M GETTING
FEEDBACK IN MY EAR.

AND WE THINK THAT SAFE
SHELTERS ARE REALLY
IMPORTANT IN ALL SCHOOLS.

EVEN SOME SCHOOLS SCHOOLS
DEVASTATED WITH A MASSIVE
TORNADO CAME ROARING
THROUGH TODAY.

COMMUNICATIONS ARE
IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS POINT.

FROM MOORE OKLAHOMA.

HOPEFULLY AS IT GOES ON
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING
THAT'S MANDATED.

THAT'S THE PATH THE TORNADO
TOOK.

BUT IT'S ALWAYS HOW MANY
TOOK THEM SERIOUSLY AND
TOOK SHELTER.

THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION.

THESE ARE NEW PICTURES THAT
WE ARE JUST GETTING IN HERE
AT FOX NEWS CHANNEL ON THE
RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF YOUR
SCREEN.

YET TODAY THE HOUSES WERE
ALREADY THERE AND MEN,
WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE IN
BASEMENTS LISTENING TO THE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
RADIO AND HOPEFUL OTHERS
WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE IN
BATHROOMS.

AND THEY RECEIVED THAT WORD
AFTER KNOWING THAT
NEIGHBORS IN A NEARBY TOWN
HAD HAD A DEVASTATING
TORNADO LESS THAN 18 HOURS
BEFORE.

AND BELIEVED TO BE DEAD
BENEATH THE RUBBLE.

WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT
MY PARENTS I CAN'T GET
AHOLD OF THEM.

THE NEWS IS MORE DISTURBING
FROM PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE
SHELTER.

MAYOR LEWIS.

WHERE WE ARE GETTING NEWS
NOW FROM BRIAR WOOD
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER    NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE BEGAN WITH THE SAME
WARNINGS TODAY AND THE HOPE
IS MANY PEOPLE HEEDED THEM.
