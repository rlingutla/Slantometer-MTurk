59 KILLED.

GREAT TO SEE.

THE PRESIDENT SHARING
PLEASANTRIES AND THANKS WITH
FIRST RESPONDERS.

THESE PICTURES ARE FROM THE
DAILY MAIL.

INVESTIGATORS SAY HE SET UP
CAMERAS ON A ROOM SERVICE CART
OUTSIDE THE DOOR SO HE COULD SEE

ANYTHING AS WELL LIKE US.

OUR SOULS ARE STRIKEN WITH GRIEF
FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO LOST A
HUSBAND OR A WIFE, A MOTHER OR A
FATHER, A SON OR A DAUGHTER.

GET BACK.

THEY DISCUSS HOW THE HALLWAYS,
THE TRAUMA CENTER AND THE OTHER
HOSPITALS IN THE AREA WERE JUST
LITERALLY OVERFLOWING WITH
PEOPLE.

HAVE BEEN LISTENING DELONG AS WE
DISCUSS THE OTHER NEWS ITEMS OF
THE DAY.

RAN IN TO HELP WHEN THE SCOPE
BECAME CLEAR.

THERE WAS A MEMORIAL LAST NIGHT
IN MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA FOR
50-YEAR-OLD STACY ECHABAR.

WE GOT WORD OF I DON'T KNOW HOW
MANY DOZENS OF PEOPLE THAT
TRANSPORTED VICTIMS TO THE
HOSPITALS IN VANS, TRUCKS.

THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO TAKE
TIME TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THOSE
PEOPLE.

AND THEN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
ITSELF TRYING TO ORGANIZE ALL OF
THE FIRST RESPONDERS COMING.

JOINING US TODAY ARE MANY OF THE
HEROS THAT WERE HERE DURING THAT
HORRIBLE MOMENT, THAT HORRIBLE
NIGHT.

WE MET PATIENTS THAT WERE
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLY WOUNDED AND
THE DOCTORS, THE NURSES, ALL OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE HOSPITAL HAVE
DONE A JOB THAT IS
UNDESCRIBABLE.

THESE TWO YOUNG LADIES HERE ARE
DISPATCHERS.
