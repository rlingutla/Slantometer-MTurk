AS THE AGENT CHASE DOWN CLUES
AND SURVIVORS FACE CHANGED
LIVES, THIS WEEK A RETIRED
CARPENTER DRIVE TO CHICAGO TO
PLACE 58 WHITE CROSSES ON THE
STRIP.

THAT RAPID FIRE HAIL OF BULLETS
LASTED TEN MINUTES.

THE HEAD OF TWO OF THE BIGGEST
HOTELS AND CASINOS IN THAT TOWN.

IF THERE'S A MOMENT WHERE WE
FEEL LIKE THE SAFETY AND
SECURITY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS
MAY BE AT RISK BECAUSE OF CUTS,
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO
RE-VISIT IT AT THAT TIME.

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WYNN
DECIDE ADD YEAR AGO THAT
LAS VEGAS WAS A SOFT TARGET.

NEVADIANS CREDIT FEDERAL
MONDAY PROGRAMS TO TRAIN THEM TO
DEAL WITH TERRORIST ATTACKS TO
DEAL WITH THE GREAT RESPONSE.

HE ALSO COACHED HIS SON'S
FOOTBALL TEAM AND RECENTLY WROTE
A MEMOIR ABOUT SERVING ON THE
LAS VEGAS POLICE FORCE.

WE WANT MORE INFORMATION.

HE FEELS LIKE HE'S FAMILY WITH
THEM JUST EMOTIONAL STORIES, ONE
AFTER THE OTHER.

THE CAR AT MANDALAY BAY HAD 50
POUNDS OF TANNERITE AND
AMMUNITION AND FERTILIZER.

NEVADA --
 CAN YOU SPEAK UP A LITTLE
BIT?

HIS FRIENDS SAID THE DECORATED
IRAQ WAR VETERAN WAS MOST PROUD
OF BEING A FATHER.

LAS VEGAS IS A BIG STORY STILL.

THERE COULD BE A FEW
EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS.

ON THE NIGHT OF THE MASSACRE,
HARTFIELD WAS AT THE COUNTRY
MUSIC FESTIVAL WHEN THE BULLETS
HIT THE CROWD.

HE USED HIS BELT AS A TOURNIQUET
ON A MAN'S LEG AND CARRIED
SEVERAL TO A TENT INCLUDING A
WOMAN SHOT IN THE BACK.

SERGEANT HARTFIELD, FATHER OF
TWO, SOLDIER, DEAD AT 34.

THAT'S THE CURRENT POSITION.

AND THERE'S NOW REPORTS THAT
PADDOCK TRIED TO BUY TRACER
AMMUNITION AT A PHOENIX GUN
SHOW.

YOU HAVE CUTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS
IN YOUR BUDGET PLANS?
