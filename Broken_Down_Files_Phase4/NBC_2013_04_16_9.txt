WHAT WE KNOW, WE HAVE MADE
PUBLIC OR MOST OF IT ANYHOW.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THE EXPLOSIVE
IN BOSTON WAS MOST LIKELY
SMOKELESS POWDER, GUNPOWDER LIKE
THIS, AVAILABLE AT SPORTING
GOODS STORES, NOT SOMETHING MORE
POWERFUL LIKE DYNAMITE.

THE SECOND THING, THEN, IS TO
SORT OUT HOW THIS COULD HAVE
HAPPENED.

SOME WERE GIVEN MEDALS FOR A
RACE THEY WERE UNABLE TO
COMPLETE.

ONE GENTLEMAN HAD NO LEGS BELOW
THE KNEES.

NIGHT SEARCHED THE APARTMENT OF
A FOREIGN STUDENT WHO WAS
INJURED IN THE BLAST AND SEEN
RUNNING AWAY, BUT THEY FOUND
NOTHING, AND HE IS NOT
CONSIDERED A SUSPECT.

THIS IS MY HOME.

INVESTIGATORS URGE ANYONE WHO
WAS AT THE SCENE YESTERDAY TO
SEND THEM PICTURES AND VIDEOS.

THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN CHAOS.

AND TODAY ANOTHER OF THE DEAD
WAS IDENTIFIED.

78-YEAR-OLD BILL IFFRIG WAS JUST
FEET FROM THE EXPLOSION, ABOUT
WHAT DID IT SOUND LIKE?

BUT THERE ARE ALSO ALONGSIDE
THIS, BRIAN, SOME EXTRAORDINARY
STORIES OF GRACE AND KINDNESS
THAT PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN, BOTH
NEIGHBORS FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND
VISITORS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE
CITY AND THE STATE.

AGENTS EVEN TOOK THE HIGHLY
UNUSUAL STEP OF ASKING PEOPLE
LEAVING BOSTON AT THE AIRPORT
TODAY IF THEY HAD PICTURES OF
VALUE, TOO.

THE TSA ALSO STUFFING UP
PASSENGER SCREENINGS.

THE OKLAHOMA CITY MARATHON, A
BIKE RACE IN HOUSTON, A 10K IN
MIAMI, NASCAR IN VIRGINIA, EVEN
THE KENTUCKY DERBY AND INDY 500
GETTING A SECOND LOOK.

HE SAW THE EXPLOSION AND
ATTENDED TO THE MOST SERIOUSLY
WOUNDED.

STILL MANY OTHERS WERE.

HE WAS KILLED.

BECAUSE THERE IS UNRESTRICTED
ACCESS TO THE RACE COURSE,
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S 28 MILES
LONG, PEOPLE CAN COME AND GO AND
BRING ITEMS IN AND OUT.

I'M NOT GOING TO BE AFRAID.
