DZHOKHAR, A WRESTLER, AND
TAMERLAN, A BOXER.

WAS IT CHECHNYAN NATIONALISM, AT
THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, THE
PRESIDENT MET AGAIN IN THE
SITUATION ROOM WITH HIS NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISERS.

AND IN MAJOR LEAGUE BALLPARKS.

IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANCEL
EVENTS, BUT YOU WANT TO BE
MONITORING CROWDS.

FANS SANG THE RED SOX ANTHEM,
"SWEET CAROLINE," WHEN WORD
SPREAD THE SUSPECT WAS IN
CUSTODY.

HE ORDERS NEARLY A MILLION
PEOPLE TO STAY HOME.

AND MUCH TO THE RELIEF OF THE
NATION, AT 845 P.M., THE
SUSPECT IS CAPTURED.

000 THE RELIEF THAT THIS
FRIGHTENING CHAPTER MAY BE OVER
HAS NOT ERASED THE SENSE OF
VULNERABILITY THAT THIS BROUGHT
ON, A REMINDER TERROR CAN STRIKE
ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, AND THE
RESPONSE WAS EVIDENT TODAY AT
PUBLIC EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

SEVEN -- THREE ARE STILL IN
CRITIC
CRITICAL CONDITION AND LESTER
THAT DOES INCLUDE A 7-YEAR-OLD
GIRL.

WITHIN A MONTH OF HIS RETURN,
IN AUGUST 2012, TAMERLAN SET UP
THIS YOUTUBE ACCOUNT FULL OF
ISLAMIE JIHADI POSTINGS, MANY IN
RUSSIAN, REFLECTING HIS FORMER
LIFE IN CHECHNYA.

SON JUST YOU GOT OUT OF
YESTERDAY ANOTHER SURGERY TODAY.

WHO HOPED TO BE ON THE U.S.
OLYMPIC TEAM.

AND WHEN "NBC NIGHTLY NEWS"
CONTINUES ON THIS SATURDAY, AS
BOSTON BREATHES A SIGH OF
RELIEF, HEIGHTENED ALERTS OF
PUBLIC EVENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY
TODAY.

HE WAS A GREAT YOUNG MAN.

♪ SWEET CAROLINE
♪ DA, DA, DA
♪ GOOD TIMES NEVER SO GOOD
♪ SO GOOD, SO GOOD, SO GOOD
WILL NEVER BE QUITE THE SAME.

THEY WANT TSARNAEV TREATED AS AN
ENEMY COMBATANT UNDER THE LAWS
OF WAR.

THE SUSPECT IS IN SERIOUS, BUT
STABLE CONDITION HERE AT BETH
ISRAEL AND YES, HE IS IN THE
VERY SAME HOSPITAL AS MANY OF
THE PEOPLE THE FBI SAYS HE TRIED
TO KILL.

THEY WERE SAVING THAT FOR
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE BOSTON
HAVE STOPPED ANOTHER ATTACK.

AND WE'RE WATCHING THE TV AND IT
JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE INSIDE
THIS STRANGE NIGHTMARE.

DID THESE BROTHERS JOIN EXISTING
SEPARATE CHECHEN FACTIONS?
