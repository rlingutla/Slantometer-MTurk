WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH WENT INTO
AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, I HAD ANT
WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE.

THE ACTS OF MR. ASSAD, THERE
NEEDS TO BE A RESPONSE.

LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT SAID
THE AIR STRIKES WERE IN THE
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST
OF THE UNITED STATES.

SHE SAID CONGRESS MUST DEBATE AN
AUTHORIZATION OF USE OF MILITARY
FORCE AGAINST A SOVEREIGN
NATION.

THERE'S 13 IN YELLOW.

THAT WAS PART OF YOUR SHORT
STATEMENT ON THIS MATTER.

WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THAT
RELATIONSHIP?

THE UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

FROM MY STANDPOINT, IF WE'RE
GOING TO GET EMBROILED MORE IN
THE WAR, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD COME TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS TO
LOOK FOR AN AUTHORIZATION.

THEY CONSOLIDATED THE REGIME'S
HOLDING.

WHO WILL DEFEAT ISIS FORCES IN
RAQQA AND WHO WILL HOLD THE
GROUND.

SHE SAYS BOLIVIA'S AMBASSADOR
CALLED FOR A CLOSED DOOR MEETING
AFTER THE STRIKE.

IRAN AND RUSSIA HAS FILLED THE
VACUUM.

JOHN ROBERTS IS LIVE IN
MAR-A-LARGO IN SOUTH FLORIDA.

WE WERE JUST TOLD THIS BY TWO
US IS SENIOR MILITARY
COMMANDERS.

WE SHOULD STEP UP TO THE PLATE.

FOX LEARNED THAT A RUSSIAN
WARSHIP IS MAKING ITS WAY TO THE
AREA AND THIS IS NO LONGER A
CONFLICT BY PROXY.

FOR EXAMPLE, HE'S USED THE
SEIZURE AND ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA
AS JUSTIFIABLE BECAUSE IT WAS
RUSSIAN FOR SO MANY CENTURIES.

FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, THIS IS
CLEARLY HIS MOST DRAMATIC
MILITARY ORDER SINCE TAKING
OFFICE.

LOOKS LIKE THERE'S THREE HERE.
