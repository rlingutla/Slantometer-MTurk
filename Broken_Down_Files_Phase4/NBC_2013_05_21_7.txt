I JUST WANTED TO JOIN
EVERYBODY WATCHING WISH YOU GOOD
LUCK.

IT ACTUALLY STARTED ACROSS THE
STREET IN OKLAHOMA CITY.

THEY THINK SHE GOT OUT.

AND WE DUG HER OUT OF LIKE WHERE
THAT RED THING IS, SHE WAS DOWN
RIGHT BEHIND THAT.

AND WE MENTION THAT FLUCTUATING
NUMBER OF CONFIRMED DEAD.

REMARKABLE HOW MANY CHILDREN DID
GET OUT OF THIS SCHOOL.

AND I TOLD MY DAUGHTER, MIA, IS
THAT YOUR FRIEND?

WHAT ABOUT THE ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL?

IT'S ABOUT A MILE RIGHT AT
OUR TAIL.

RIGHT NOW RESCUE TEAMS ARE STILL
SEARCHING FOR MISSING PEOPLE.

AND HE GOT UP THERE, AND HE
LOOKED DOWN AT ME, AND HE SAID,
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

THAT TWISTER HAD SPEEDS OF MORE
THAN 300 MILES PER HOUR, DAMAGED
MORE THAN 8,000 HOMES AND KILLED
AT LEAST 36.

WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE
EVERYTHING WE HAVE SEEN RIGHT
NOW.

YOU'RE GOING TO COUNT ON THAT
TO REBUILD THIS CITY YET AGAIN
AFTER '99.

ME AND MY MOM RAN ACROSS THE
STREET AND CAME OVER HERE.

NOT A MATTER THEY WOULD BE LEFT
OUT FOR ANY REASON.

15-YEAR-OLD MORGAN SMITH RODE
OUT THE STORM IN AN UNDERGROUND
SHELTER.

BATHROOM STALL CROUCHED OVER
FOUR CHILDREN, AND SHE DID WHAT
TEACHERS DO.

ONE OF THEM, LUCKILY, HAD NO
FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF SO
FAR.

RECOVERY EFFORT IS NOT LIMITED
TO THOSE IN UNIFORM.
