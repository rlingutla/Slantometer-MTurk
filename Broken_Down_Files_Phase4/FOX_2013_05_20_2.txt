THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE
THEY COULD GET TO THEY
STOPPED AND STARTED
HELPING.

THERE WAS AN AREA WIDE PUSH
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF
STORM SHELTERS.

YOU KNOW, AFTER YOU HAD
WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY

THIS ONE IT APPEARS IN THE
EARLY GOING ACCORDING TO
EVERYONE THERE IS EVEN
WORSE.

WHAT DO WE KNOW?

THEN SUDDENLY YOU COULD
TELL THERE IS A FARM THERE
IT TURNS OUT THAT WAS ORB
FARM.

TOMORROW THIS PARTICULAR
AREA IS OUT OF THE RISK
IT'S GOING TO BE A COOLER
DAY.

AND THAT WAS THE STORM BY
WHICH ALL OTHERS WERE JUDGE
DOLLARS.

AND THE TORNADO THAT WE
HAVE SEEN THE EXTENSIVE
DAMAGE FROM, THE MOORE
OKLAHOMA WE THINK RIGHT NOW
IS AN EF-4.

WE HAVE SEEN THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER PULLING UP IN THIS
PARKING LOT AS THOSE PEOPLE
WAIT TO PULL A FOURTH BODY
FROM THIS LOCATION.

AND WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW
MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN
TORNADO DEREK HAS NOT
PASSED.

THIS IS THE CASE,
NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER
NEIGHBORHOOD ACROSS THIS
DEVASTATED AREA.

ASIDE FROM THOSE AT THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ABOUT
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
SPEAKING.

OUR CASEY STEGALL IS IN THE
AREA AND HAS BEEN REPORTING
ON WHAT HE HAS SEEN FROM
THIS 7/11 THAT WAS BLOWN
AWAY.

IS IT DOESN'T MATTER LAST
WHEN I WAS ON THE GROUND
COVERING DEADLY TORNADOES
AND LAST NIGHT COVERING
THESE AND NOW IT DOESN'T
MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU
SEE THIS.

GOING THESE ARE LIVE
PICTURES COMING IN FROM
MOORE NOW.

EAST COAST AND'00 IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, WHERE THE
DEATH TOLL IS RISING
FOLLOWING TODAY'S
DEVASTATING TORNADOES THAT
TORE ACROSS THAT AREA AND
LEFT UNSPEAKABLE DAMAGE.

OUR METEOROLOGIST RICK
REICHMUTH WAS IN THE AREA
COVERING THE STORMS WHICH
HIT LAST NIGHT AND
ANTICIPATING THOSE FROM
TODAY.

I'M SHEPARD SMITH IN NEW
YORK.

GOVERNOR FALLON SAID THE
SCOPE OF THE DISASTER IS SO
GREAT THAT STATE OFFICIALS
NEED MORE TIME TO EVEN OPEN
LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS IS
RESCUERS.
