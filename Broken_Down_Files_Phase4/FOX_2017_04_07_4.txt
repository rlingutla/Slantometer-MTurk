IT DOESN'T TELL US WHAT
MR. TRUMP MIGHT DO NEXT.

IN TERMS OF ANY KIND OF
MUNITIONS THAT ASSAD NEEDS, AS
POINTED OUT, HE DOESN'T NEED
MUCH IN THE WAY OF TECHNOLOGY
FOR THE TACTICS HE'S EMPLOYING.

THE U.S. NAVY FIRING 60 TOMAHAWK
CRUISE MISSILES FROM TWO WAR
SHIPS.

LET'S FACE IT.

YOU HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CONTACTS.

THE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
IS OUTLAWED INTERNATIONALLY.

I HOPE WE CAN START THE
COOPERATI
COOPERATION.

THE STRIKES HITTING OVERNIGHT IN
SYRIA.

WE JUST LEARNED THAT THAT
HOTLINE SET UP BETWEEN THE
RUSSIAN AND U.S. MILITARY TO
PREVENT MILITARY MISHAPS IN
SYRIA, THAT IS BEING SHUT DOWN
BY THE RUSSIANS.

QUOTING HERE "THE LAST REMAINING
ELECTION FOG HAS LIFT.

THAT AS WE GET WORD THAT A
RUSSIAN WARSHIP IS HEADED TOWARD
THE TWO UNITED STATES NAVY
DESTROYERS USED IN THE STRIKES
ON SYRIA.

I DON'T THINK OUR MILITARY
LEADERS ARE ALL THAT CONCERNED
ABOUT IT.

SHOULD THE PRESIDENT HAVE
CONSULTED CONGRESS?

A PRIVATE COMPANY.

WE ALL NEED TO STOP AND TRY TO
FIGHT TOGETHER TO PREVENT THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THAT SYRIA
HAS BEGUN.

WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE
RUSSIAN SHIP IS STAYING IN
INTERNATIONAL WATERS.

THIS IS AN ACTION THAT CANNOT BE
TOLERATED.

IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO MORE,
THAT IT USE THEIR OWN BOMBERS.

AND THE BLUSTER FROM VLADIMIR
PUTIN AND HIS SPOKESPEOPLE?

WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT THE VIOLATION OF THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS PARTICULARLY,
IT IS A VIOLATION OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW.
