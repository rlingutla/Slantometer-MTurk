IT'S 67 FRANKLIN STREET IN
WATER TOWN.

AGAIN TO REPORT AND REPEAT
OUR HEATHER IS SAYING THAT
A SOURCE TELLS HER THAT
SHOTS WERE FIRED AND WE
CLEARLY KNOW THAT NOW AND
THAT THE SUSPECT IS DOWN.

THIS HAS BEEN A LONG
SEVERAL DAYS HERE IN
BOSTON.

HE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEE
TO MOVE THEM TOO FAST.

SUSPECT NUMBER 2.

WE'RE STUCK HERE RIGHT NOW.

IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE TO
GET CLOSE TO SUSPECT NUMBER
2.

HEATHER OUTSIDE OF
WATERTOWN MALL.

THEY WEREN'T RUNNING.

AND HAD THAT BOMB WORKED
PROPERLY, THIS STORY WOULD
HAVE TAKEN ITSELF TO AN
ENTIRELY NEW LEVEL.

CAN HEAR THE
SOUND.

I HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE
SAYING THAT HE IS
SURROUNDED.

BOB SAID THERE HAS BEEN 8
TO 10 EXPLOSIONS THAT HE
HAS HEARD.

YOU HAVE WALKED YOUR DOG.

YES.

THEY ARE EVACUATING THE
AREA WE HAVE SEEN FAMILIES
RUNNING OUT WITH TERROR ON
THEIR FACE.

HE MAY HAVE BEEN HIDING IN
THAT BOAT WITH THAT COVER
OVER IT.

I UNDERSTAND YOU WITNESSED
WHAT WENT DOWN ON FRANKLIN
STREET EARLIER.

THAT'S HOW IT TRANSPIRED.

'S GET
RIGHT TO WATER TOWN WHERE
OUR PRODUCER CHRIS LAIBLE
IS STANDING BY.
