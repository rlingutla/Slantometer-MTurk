NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE FLOOD
OF REFUGEES LEAVING THAT COUNTRY
AND ACCUSATIONS.

AND LISTEN, HARRIS, THIS IS THE
SWEET SPOT OF THE UNITED STATES
MILITARY CAPABILITY AND WE KNOW
HOW TO DO IT VERY WELL AND WE
HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST.

WABASHAR ASSAD'S REGIME IS USING
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO
ATTACK OUT ITS OWN CITIZENS.

IT COULD CREATE NOW HAVENS FOR
TERRORIST AND AMERICAN NATIONAL
SECURITY TIME TALKED ABOUT THE
NEXT STEP AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT
IS UNFOLDING, PICTURES THAT ARE
SO HARD TO LOOK AT AND
IMPOSSIBLE TO AUNTICATE AND SEEM
TO GO ALONG WITH CHEMICAL
ATTACKS IN SYRIA.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IS GETTING
REPORTS FROM THE U.S.
ENTELEIGENCE COMMUNITY WHICH
ACCORDING TO THE WHITE WHITE
TRYING TO ASCERTAIN WHAT
HAPPENED IN SYRIA AND WAITING TO
HEAR FROM A UNITED NATION'S TEAM
IN SYRIA BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
MAKES A DECISION ON HOW THE U.S.
WILL RESPOND.

YOU DON'T SEE US GOING IN
FROM THE GROUND AT ALL.

IN TERMS OF OUR OPTIONS,
HARRIS?

PRESIDENT CONFERRED WITH
ANOTHER WORLD LEADER ON SYRIA.

THEY ARE ACCUSING THE ANTI-
GOVERNMENT REBELS OF USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND OTHERS CALL
THAT A THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT
FROM THE NERVE GAS ASSAULT ON
A NEIGHBORHOOD THEY SAY.

IT THE PRESIDENT SPOKE BY THE
EXPERIENCE HIS PREDECESSOR OVER
THE WMD IN IRAQ AND LACK OF
INACCURATE WILL BOW TO THE UN TO
DO WHAT THEY CAN DO.

WE HAVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND IF
WE LET IT GO ON.

MY FIRST QUESTION WILL BE WHAT
WE LEARNED FROM MOLLY.

I COULDN'T SAY THE WORD BUT I
THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE MEAN.

IT CERTAINLY GIVES PRESIDENT
OBAMA MORE FLEXIBILITY TO ORDER
AIR STRIKES OR MISSILE ATTACKS
IF HE DECIDES TO DO.

THEIR MEETING AFTER A REPORT
THAT SYRIA'S GOVERNMENT
AGAINOUSED DEADLY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ON HIS CHILDREN.

GENERAL, WHAT I KNOW YOU SAID
IN THE PAST.

LET'S GET INSIDE OF ASSAD'S
HEAD.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAID THE UNITED
STATES IS TRYING TO CONFIRM THE
REPORT.

THE PICTURES ARE HARD TO VIEW,
BUT IF WE CAPTAIN DETERMINE,
GENERAL, WHERE THE TRUTH LIES,
WHETHER IT IS THE GOVERNMENT OR
REBELS BLAMED FOR THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, WHAT SHOULD OUR
MILITARY MOVE BE?

HOW WILL THE UNITED STATES
RESPOND TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA
THAT HAS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
POURING OVER THE BORDERS TRYING
TO ESCAPE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE
THAT THEIR COUNTRY HAS BECOME.
