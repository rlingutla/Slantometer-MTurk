TORNADOES HITTING IN OKLAHOMA.

CONTINUING COVERAGE AFTER
THE BREAK BECAUSE AGAIN
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE STILL IN
THE THE PATH OF THIS THIS
EVENING AND WITH THE HEATING
INDEX LATE IN THE DAY IT IS
STILL VERY DANGEROUS.

A LOT O THE GROUND OF STUFF CAN
HIT THE SKY.

I THINK I HEARD OVER THE
SCANNER THAT ONE POWER LINE HAD
FELL ON TOP OF A CAR WITH A
FAMILY INSIDE OF IT BUT THE
FAMILY IS SAFE.

HAVE AN EMERGENCY STORM PLAN,
SHELTER, WHERE THEY WILL GO TO
TAKE COVER AND QUICKLY HAVE
THEIR INFORMATION GATHERED.

AND IFKY GET SOME DIRECTION
FROM THE PRODUCERS IN THE BOOTH
PLEASE TO TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE
THIS IS.

EVEN I HAD BROKEN WINDOWS AND
ALL OF MY VEHICLES THAT WERE
SITTING OUT THEY ALL ENDED UP
BEING DAMAGED AND SO TREES THAT
HAVE FELL ON TOP OF HOMES AND
JUST IT JUST THE LIST GOES ON
AND A ON AND ON.

KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS
ARE AND HAVE A PLAN BEFORE THE
STORM HITS BECAUSE YOU ONLY
HAVE A MATTER OF MINUTES REALLY
TO SPRING INTO ACTION.

THEN HARRIS TOMORROW THE STORM
CLOUDS CLEAR HEATS UP AGAIN
AND THE THREAT FOR SEVERE
WEATHER YET AGAIN.

AND RIGHT NOW ALL EYES ARE ON
THE AREA AS JANICE DEAN WAS
SAYING PINK, OKLAHOMA, THAT IS
SOUTHEAST OF NORMAN.

A DANGEROUS FLUID SITUATION
THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.

SO TORNADOES ARE CONDUCIVE HERE
ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. UP
TOWARDS THE MIDWEST.

EMILY, ARE YOU WITH US?

NORMAN OKLAHOMA.

I WILL HAVE UREPORT INFORMATION
TO SEND YOUR PICTURES DIRECTLY
TO US.

THERE, CHRISTIAN HOW ARE
PEOPLE DEALING WITH THE
WARNINGS THERE?

I HAVE TO SAY.

YOU HAVE SEEN IT AROUND TOWN OR
BEEN AROUND NORMAN THE BIG
DOPPLER BALL IS RIGHT HERE AND
LOOKING OUT.

ON SEVERE WEATHER WATCH NOW AND
IT IS HITTING MUCH OF THE MID
SECTION OF THE COUNTRY.

WE APPRECIATE IT.
