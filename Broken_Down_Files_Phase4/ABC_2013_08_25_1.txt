SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK HAVE
OUTRAGED THE WORLD.

NOW TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA
THIS EVENING, AND TO A MESSAGE
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, INTENDED
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.

U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS, A
RESPONSE MUST BE TIMELY, DONE
SOON ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANOTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THAT TIME
HAS PASSED.

ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO MADE
VERY CLEAR THEY DO NOT WANT TO
TAKE ANY KIND OF ACTION ALONE.

WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED
IN THE MOST HORRIFIC WAY.

THE MESSAGE FROM THE U.S. TO
SYRIA THIS EVENING.

SYRIA SAYS IT WILL ALLOW
INSPECTORS.

AND SO TONIGHT HERE, WE ASK,
WILL AMERICA ACT?

TODAY, SYRIA SAID IT WOULD ALLOW
U.N.

FIGHTER
JETS LAUNCHING WEAPONS FROM
OUTSIDE SYRIAN AIR SPACE.

THE SYRIANS HAVE CREATED THIS
SANCTUARY, WHERE THERE ARE
SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES.

WILL THE WHITE HOUSE TAKE
ACTION, AFTER NEW AND GRUESOME
IMAGES?

SO, HOW SOON COULD THIS HAPPEN?

AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THERE IS
VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS
THE SYRIAN REGIME THAT USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ITS OWN
PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.

SO, THERE HAVE BEEN URGENT
MEETINGS WITH ALLIES HERE IN THE
REGION AND ELSEWHERE.

AND WORST CASE, DRAG US INTO A
LARGER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT.

I THINK THE BEST THAT WE
COULD HOPE FOR IS TO DETER MR.
ASSAD FROM USING CHEMICALS
AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AGAIN.
