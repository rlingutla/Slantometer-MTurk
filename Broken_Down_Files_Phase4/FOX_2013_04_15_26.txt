YOU KNOW, MARATHON MONDAY
IN THE CITY OF BOSTON.

I'M CURIOUS THOUGH ABOUT
WHAT THAT SCENE WAS LIKE IN
THE SECONDS BETWEEN AND IN
THE SECONDS AFTER THE
SECOND.

AND TODAY TO HAVE IT AT
THE FINISH LINE OF THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

BOMB SQUAD MONITORING.

LET'S REMEMBER THERE IS A
WHOLE NEW NATIONAL SECURITY
TEAM HERE AT THE SECOND
TERM DEFENSE SECRETARY
HAGEL.

THEY HAVE TAKEN PRECAUTIONS
THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE
SINCE 9/11.

WHAT THEY WILL DO AT THESE
RACES AND S. PREPOSITION
THEIR PERSONAL BELONGINGS
SO WHEN THEY FINISH THE
RACE THEY HAVE SOMETHING IT
TO RETURN TO.

HE WAS MAKING HIS WAY TO
ME.

THESE WERE NOT HUGE DEVICES
IN THAT SENSE.

THE WHITE HOUSE, OF COURSE
HAS CALLED THIS AN ACT OF
TERROR.

WE ARE IN TIMES SQUARE.

I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE
SAFEST WAY TO PUT IT RIGHT
NOW, SHEP.

THE MIDDLE OF "STUDIO B"
WHEN THIS HAPPENED THIS
AFTERNOON AND THE FIRST
VIDEO CAME IN.

AT THE TIME, THE ANSWER WAS
NO, THERE HADN'T BEEN.

WE WILL CONDUCT A SWEEP
WITH MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO
OTHER DEVICES ON THE
STREET.

WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY
CONFIRM THIS AND WE HAVEN'T
LEARNED TOO MUCH ABOUT THE
REST OF THE VICTIMS.

WE HAD HEARD THAT REPORT.

PATRIOT'S DAY.

THAT'S RIGHT, SHEP.

TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP OF
THE AREA NOW SO YOU CAN GET
A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED.
