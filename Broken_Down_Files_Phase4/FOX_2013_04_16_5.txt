THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BONDED US.

MANY WONDERED IF HE SURVIVED.

THIS COUNTRY IS A 14-YEAR-OLD
TEENAGER GOING THROUGH WHAT I
CALL SECURITY PUBERTY.

THE GROUND SHOOK, BIGGEST
EARTHQUAKE.

THAT THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES OF
GETTING AT WHOEVER PLACED IT.

WE SEE MATERIALS THAT ARE
CLEARLY, ACCORDING TO YOUR
SOURCES, THE MATERIALS THAT HELD
THIS BOMB AS IT SAT EITHER IN A
TRASH CAN OR SIDE 56 CURB.

THEY ARE VERY COMMON IN THE
STORES, BUT ALSO THEY ARE COMMON
FOR BOMB MAKING.

I HEARD THE BIGGEST SOUND
I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE AND
EVERYTHING WENT CHAOTIC.

WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS AN
ORDINARY, EVERYDAY PRESSURE
COOKER.

TERROR ATTACK IN BOSTON
AFFECTED LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS IN
THE NATION'S CAPITAL.

HAIR OR RESIDUE IN THE
EXPLOSIVES THEMSELVES.

DOCTORS ARE HAPPY TO SAY HE IS
IN GOOD CONDITION.

IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR
A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

SO WHAT WE'VE GOT RIGHT HERE IS
THE FIRST PICTURES OF THE PUZZLE
PIECES OF PUZZLE AND CRIME
SCENE.

WE LOOKED TOWARD THE FINISH
LINE.

PEOPLE LIKE BRUCE RAN TOWARD
THEM SO PEOPLE WERE OKAY.

DOCTORS WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH
THE WAY THE COMMUNITY CAME OUT
AND VERY IMPRESSED BY THE
RESILIENCE OF THE VICTIMS.

THE BOMBINGS HERE IN BOSTON
IS SPARKING A DEBATE FOR OUR
SECURITY.

THEY APPARENTLY SHOW THE
WRECKAGE OF A PRESSURE COOKER.

WE ARE OPERATING THAT FREE
SOCIETY SO PEOPLE WALKING ALONG
A STREET, WHETHER LINING UP A
MARATHON ROUTE, IT'S DIFFICULT
TO CONTROL IF PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO GO THROUGH CONTROLS TO GET TO
A PARTICULAR MORE CONCENTRATED
LOCATION.
