YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
IT IS, BUT YOU KNOW THEN
SOMEBODY SET A BOMB.

WE DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONE.

THERE ARE THOUSANDS
STRANDED WITHOUT THOSE
POSSESSIONS TONIGHT.

IT WAS JUST THREE YEARS AGO
YOU MAY RECALL WAS THE
TARGET ITSELF OF A
TERRORIST ATTACK.

WELL, WHEN THE INCIDENT
HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, A CREW
OF US WORKING AND I WAS THE
ONLY ONE THAT WAS OUTSIDE.

THAT'S A TYPICALLY BUSY
TIME AT THE FINISH LINE,
AND THERE WERE A LOT OF
PEOPLE STILL CROWDED AROUND
THE FINISH LINE.

THESE HAPPENED A FEW
SECONDS APART AND THEN A
LITTLE MORE THAN 1 HOUR AND
20 MINUTES LATER THERE WAS
THIS FIRE AND SOMETHING
THAT WENT BOOM AT THE JFK
LIBRARY IN THE DOOR CHESTER
SECTION.

JUST KIDS WHO AS I WAS
SAYING EARLIER WERE TAKEN
BY THEIR PARENTS TO SEE
WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A
JOYFUL SPORTING EVENT ON A
HOLIDAY IN BOSTON.

OR DOMESTIC WITH AN
INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT IE
SOMEBODY WHO IS BORN HERE
AND LIVED HERE AND
RADICALIZED ABROAD.

[EXPLOSION]
SCREAMING]
[EXPLOSION]
CAMERA CAPTURED THE SCENE
MOMENTS RIGHT AFTER THE
FIRST BLAST ALONG WITH THE
SECOND EXPLOSION.

MULTIPLE PEOPLE DOWN HERE,
OKAY?

THEY DROPPED EVERYTHING IN
THEIR ARMS AND RAN TO
SAFETY.

STEVE, FROM WHAT'S LEFT AT
THE SCENE AFTER SOMETHING
EXPLODES, YOU CAN LEARN A
LOT ABOUT WHAT'S FIRST
THERE.

A GUY CAN JUST WALK DOWN
THE STREET AND PUT A
BACKPACK AND TRASH BARREL
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT AN
ENTIRE REGION IS JUST
BROUGHT TO GRIPS.

ALL WENT DOWN WITH THE
FINAL WORD OF EXACTLY HOW
THINGS WERE GOING TO
PROCEED.

SO ARE ITS PEOPLE.

BUT THOSE HERE TONIGHT HAVE
THEIR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS
WITH OUR FELLOW COMPATRIOTS
IN BOSTON BECAUSE OF WHAT
HAPPENED THERE.

MOST OF THEM WERE LOWER
BODY INJURIES TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHRAPNEL WAS THERE BUT IT
WAS AN UGLY SCENE.

I TALKED TO ONE YOUNG MAN
WHO CAME IN FROM ST. LOUIS
MISSOURI.

WE DON'T YET HAVE ANSWERS
TO ANY OF THAT.
