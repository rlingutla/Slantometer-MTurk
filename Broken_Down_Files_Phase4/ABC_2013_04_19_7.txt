THEY WERE UNDER INSTRUCTIONS NOT
TO RETURN FIRE.

AND SO IT'S REMARKABLE, AFTER
ALL OF THIS, THAT IS SUSPECT WAS
ALIVE AT THIS POINT.

THAT'S FROM STATE REPRESENTATIVE
JOHN LONG.

THEY WEREN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY.

AND, LIKE I SAY, HE JUST
HAPPENED TO NOTICE, IT DIDN'T
LOOK RIGHT AND HE LOOKED INSIDE
AND THAT'S WHERE HE SAW THE
BLOOD AND THE BODY AND THAT'S --
THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE
PERSON NOW.

YES, AS MY NEIGHBOR SAID,
WHEN THEY TOLD US WE COULD GO
OUT, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE DID
THAT, BUT WITHIN MINUTES, THE
POLICE REALLY DESCENDED ON THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND WE HAD QUITE A
FEW OF THEM IN OUR BACKYARD AND
WE HEARD THEM SAYING THAT HE WAS
POKING HOLES THROUGH THE
PLASTIC, THAT SHRINK WRAP, ON
THE BOAT.

NOTHING CAN DEFEAT THE HEART OF
THIS CITY, NOTHING."

SO, IT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW,
INTERESTING THAT THAT'S WHERE HE
WAS, NOT AT THE YACHT CLUB, BUT
JUST DOWN THE STREET.

HE WAS IN THE BOAT, POKING HOMES
TO TRY TO SEE OUT.

THAT'S THE NEXT THING WE'RE
LOOKING FOR.

WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

BUT I DO BELIEVE HE IS ALIVE   D
AND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO
GET SOME ANSWERS, WHICH IS
PROBABLY THE MOST COMFORTING
FEELING, YOU KNOW, THROUGH ALL
THIS.

I ALSO READ A QUOTE FROM YOU,
YOU SAID, I'VE NEVER FELT SAFER
IN MY LIFE.

AND AGAIN, IT SEEMED
INCONCEIVABLE AFTER ALL THESE
REPORTS OF THAT GUN FIRE AND THE
WAY HE WAS SURROUNDED, PIERRE?

BUT INITIALLY, THEY ALL CAME
RUSHING DOWN THE STREET AND THEN
THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF GUN
FIRE.

WELL, I THINK THEY PROBABLY
DID APPROACH THE BOAT WITH THE
ROBOT.

NOW, ONE DISTINCTION IS THAT IN
MASSACHUSETTS, THERE IS NO DEATH
PENALTY.

THERE ARE FLIFR POLICE OFFICERS
WALKING UP, PEOPLE ARE
CONGRATULATING THEM, GIVING THEM
PATS ON THE BACK AND, YOU KNOW,
ASKING QUESTIONS, SO, IT'S MORE
OF A LESS TENSE SCENARIO RIGHT
NOW AND PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE AND
WALKING AROUND, SO, IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
LENIENT, YOU KNOW, AS IT WAS
EARLIER IN THE DAY.

AND A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE BEEN
ASKING ONLINE ABOUT SOMETHING
ALL DAY, THE OLDER BROTHER, THE
DECEASED BROTHER, HAD A WIFE OR
AT LEAST A GIRLFRIEND, WE'RE NOT
SURE IF THEY WERE MARRIED, BUT
THEY HAVE A 3-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
AS WELL.

AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT, IT'S A
LITTLE IRONIC, BECAUSE AS SOON
AS THE GOVERNOR LIFTED THE BAN
THAT WE COULD LEAVE OUR HOME IS
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT SEEMS
HELL BROKE LOOSE.
