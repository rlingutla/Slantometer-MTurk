AND SHE GOT A COUPLE
SCRAPES AND SCRATCHES.

IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

WE HEARD THE STORM.

SHE WILL BE IN OKLAHOMA
WHERE YOU ARE TOMORROW,
SHEP.

THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
HOUSES.

AND SO, WE ARE WORKING REAL
HARD RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO
GET A MORE ACCURATE COUNT
OF THE LOSS OF LIFE AND WE
HOPE TO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS
ON THAT.

THE TORNADO THREW IT UP
AGAINST THE HOUSE.

WE ALSO WERE HERE THIS
MORNING WHEN THIS PERIMETER
WAS UNSEALED AND THEY LET
THE RESIDENTS IN FOR THE
VERY FIRST TIME AND WE WERE
WITH THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE
SAW EVERYTHING FIRSTHAND
EVERYTHING I KNOW, I RODE
MY STREET, MY BIKE THROUGH
THIS STREET.

LISTEN AGAIN.

TO TRY TO VOOL TIER.

WERE THESE THINGS DONATED?

THE STUDENTS SIMPLY HAD THE
STRUCTURE TO PROTECT THEM.

AND YOU GO TO THE BUS AT
THIS TIME.

THE DOORS WERE ALREADY
LOCKED.

THAT'S MARY BARNHILL
SITTING NEXT TO HER
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW BRENDA.

SO FAR.

YESTERDAY, SHE WAS AT HOME
WHEN SHE HEARD THE TORNADO
WARNINGS.

SO SHE IS ACTUALLY QUITE
HAPPY ABOUT IT THAT WE ARE
ALL OKAY.

PEOPLE ARE HELPING OUT IN
SHELTERS.

NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.
