HE WAS SHOOTING
EVERYBODY.

I MEAN, THERE WAS
REALLY NOWHERE TO
MEANWHILE, MIKE CROCK
HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET
HIS FRIEND HELP.

THEY FOUND NO NOTES,
NO EMAILS, NO SOCIAL
MEDIA POSTINGS OR HOW
LONG AGO HE DEVELOPED
THIS PLAN, BUT THEY
SAY THEY DO NOT
BELIEVE HE HAD ANY
HELP.

HE WAS A VERY POPULAR
KID AROUND SCHOOL AND
AROUND TOWN.

OUR NATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT MIGUEL
ALMAGUER HAS MORE ON
THE MEN AND WOMEN ON
THE FRONT LINES IN THE
RUSH TO SAVE LIVES.

BUT POLICE SAY THEY
DON'T KNOW WHY HE
TARGETED A COUNTRY
MUSIC CONCERT.

YOUR INSTINCT WAS GET
DOWN, NOT RUN.

AND THERE WAS DEAD
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.

THOSE VIDEOS MADE US
ALL WITNESSES TO THE
SHOOTING.

SEMIAUTOMATIC WEAPONS
ARE LEGAL IN THE U.S.,
BUT FOR THREE DECADES
NEW SALES OF AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS HAVE BEEN
ILLEGAL.

BULLETS WERE HITTING
THE DIRT, SO YOU COULD
FEEL THE DIRT --
FEELING THEN
CONCUSSION OF THE
BULLETS.

POLICE SAY THE NUMBER
OF FULLY CONVERTED
MI
AUTOMATED GUNS HAS
RISEN SHARPLY.

FIRING OFF HUNDREDS OF
ROUNDS PER MINUTE.

IN THAT TIME LOOKING
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE,
WE COULD SEE POLICE IN
THE HALLWAY CHECKING
ON GUESTS TO MAKE SURE
THEY WERE OKAY.

BUT THE SON, STEPHEN
PADDOCK, HAD NO
BRUSHES WITH THE LAW.

IT WILL GO THROUGH A
POLICEMAN'S VEST,
THROUGH HIM, OUT THE
BACK AND INTO THE NEXT
PERSON.

MATTER OF SECONDS, A
COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL
TURNED TRAGIC AS A
STORM OF GUN FIRE
RAINING DOWN ON AN
INNOCENT CROWD.

BIG FAN OF LAS VEGAS.

HEATHER SAYS HE SAVED
MY LIFE AND LOST HIS.

HE LIVED THERE WITH
HIS GIRLFRIEND MARILOU
DANLEY.
