ROADS CRUMBLED AFTER UP
TO SEVEN INCHES OF RAIN FELL
OVERNIGHT.

THESE SEMIS STUCK IN NORTH
DAKOTA.

YOU CAN SEE THE FIERCE CLOUDS
THERE, DARKENING THE HORIZON,
SENDING DEBRIS IN EVERY
DIRECTION.

LET ME SHOW YOU THIS MAP.

AND WE DO BEGIN WITH A DANGEROUS
SCENE PLAYING OUT ACROSS MUCH OF
THE HEARTLAND AT THIS HOUR.

AND IN GEORGIA, PARTS OF ATLANTA
UNDER WATER.

WATCH AS LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES
THIS TWISTER IN SANFORD, KANSAS.
