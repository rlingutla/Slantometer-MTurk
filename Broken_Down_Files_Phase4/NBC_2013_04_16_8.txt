SHE LOVED HER JOB.

THEY SAID, DAD, YOU ARE SO
LUCKY.

SAID TO YOU?

IN FRONT OF HIS HOME OVER THE
WEEKEND DREW NEIGHBORS AND
FRIENDS WHO LEFT FLOWERS AND
CANDLES IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE
YOUNG BOY.

AS WE SAID, IT'S CONSUMED
THIS ENTIRE CITY.

POLICE AND SECURITY EXPERTS ARE
REITERATED TO US TODAY THAT THEY
REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO CALL IN
WITH TIPS AND WITH EVEN THE
SMALLEST BITS OF INFORMATION.

WERE ASSEMBLED INSIDE PRESSURE
COOKER POTS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE
AND NAILS TO MAGNIFY THE INJURY.

I HAD A WOMAN WHO I DON'T
KNOW CAME AND HELD MY HAND.

THEY POINT OUT THAT IN THE PAST,
THOSE SMALL CLUES HAVE VERY
OFTEN BEEN THE KEY TO TRACKING
DOWN A CRIMINAL OR BREAKING A
TERROR SUSPECT OR CELL.

AND SO MANY QUESTIONS AND
STORIES ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF
THIS.

REGIONAL BLOOD BANKS ARE ASKING
FOR DONATIONS FROM SURROUNDING
STATES, BRIAN, AS BOSTON HAS
DEPLETED ALL OF THEIR SUPPLIES.

WE'RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH SOME
OF THE STORIES THAT EMERGED
TODAY HERE IN BOSTON.

THEY WERE JUST VERY CHARMING.

BUT THERE IS ALSO A
DETERMINATION NOT TO BOW TO
TERRORISTS.

AND AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY EXCITED TO
SEE A MARATHON.

SENATOR BUT
INTERCEPTED AT AN OFF-SITE MAIL
SITE.

IT TAKES SOMETHING BIG FOR THIS
TO HAPPEN.

THE BOMBS WERE PLACED AMONG THE
CROWD DOWN THE BLOCK FROM EACH
OTHER, DETONATING JUST OVER TEN
SECONDS APART.

OFFICIALLY, IT WAS BACK TO
BUSINESS IN MOST OF BOSTON
TODAY.

IT'S NOW IN THE LAB TO SEE IF IT
REALLY IS THAT CHEMICAL.
