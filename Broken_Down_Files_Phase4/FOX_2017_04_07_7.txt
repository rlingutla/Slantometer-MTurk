WE SQUANDERED ALL THE
OPPORTUNITIES, SHEP, TO DO
SOMETHING FAVORABLE HERE FOR THE
SYRIAN PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FIVE
OR SIX YEARS.

INSTEAD OF A OVERWORKED
STATEMENT ABOUT A JOINT FIGHT
BETWEEN THE ENEMY, ISIS, THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROVED THAT
THEY WILL FIGHT THE LEGITIMATE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN A TOUGH
CONTRADICTION WITH INTERNATIONAL
LAW AND WITHOUT U.N. APPROVAL.

WAS A MESSAGE.

SUPPORT A BLOODY DICTATOR, THE
WHOLE WORLD SHOULD KNOW IT.

RUSSIA WAS ABLE TO SUCCEED AND
ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY INTENDED TO
DO, PROP UP THE REGIME WHEN THEY
WERE IN DANGER OF BEING
OVERTHROWN IN 2015.

I WISH HE CAME BEFORE.

WHAT MIGHT THAT BE?

MORE OF A RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF
DETERRENCE.

AMBASSADOR HALEY CALLED OUT
MOSCOW SAYING THE RUSSIANS HAVE
STOOD BESIDE SYRIA EVERY TIME
BASHAR AL-ASSAD HAS CROSSED THE
LINE OF HUMAN DECENCY.

OFFICIALS SAY THE STRIKES WIPED
OUT MOST OF THEM, BUT THEY SAY A
COUPLE ARE LEFT.

RETALIATING IN THAT WAY, IN THAT
MEASURED WAY.

THIS RESPONSE WAS A ONE-TIME
RESPONSE HOPEFULLY TO DETER
FUTURE USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THE RUSSIAN PRIME MINISTER IS
NOW SAYING THAT THE SYRIAN
STRIKES HAVE PUT THE UNITED
STATES ON THE VERGE OF A
MILITARY CLASH.

YOU WHETHER IT
WAS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO
OR NOT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE STRATEGY IS.

I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT THE THE
AIR STRIKES TARGETED.

STRIKE COULD LEAD TO A POLITICAL
SOLUTION AND THERE'S A CLEAR
PATH FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GET
THERE.

CLEARLY A LOT CHANGED FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

THE RUSSIANS OR THE SYRIAN
REGIME WAS TRYING TO DESTROY AND
COVER UP EVIDENCE OF THE
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.

THIS WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER IDEA
OF WHAT EVERYTHING IS.

ANY COUNTRY THAT CHOOSES TO
DEFEND THE ATROCITIES OF THE
REGIME WILL HAVE TO DO SO IN
PUBLIC VIEW FOR THE WORLD TO
HEAR.
