AND WE WILL SEE IT HERE.

WARNINGS OF LARGE SIZE
HAIL.

AND BACK HERE IN MOORE A
COMMUNITY DEALING WITH
TREMENDOUS SHOCK AND GRIEF.

SOME INSPIRATION OUT THERE
AMID ALL THE LOSS.

NEIGHBORHOODS WERE
DESTROYED.

IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR
ZONE.

AND EACH TIME THEY HAVE
BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO THE
NATION.

HOPE THAT MORE SURVIVORS
WOULD BE FOUND AND HOPE
THAT THE DEATH TOLL
WOULDN'T RISE AND THAT IS
EXACTLY EMBODIED RIGHT BACK
THERE.

AND ON THIS DAY IN 1881,
HUMANITARIAN CLARA BARTON
AND SOME FRIENDS FOUNDED
THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN
WASHINGTON D.C.
CLARA BARTON HAD GAINED
FAME YEARS EARLIER AS A
NURSE ON THE FRONT LINES OF
THE CIVIL WAR.

CASH I THINK YOU NEED IT A
NAP, DON'T YOU CASH AND
CORY AND CHRIS YOU NEED
SOME SHOES TOO BABE.

TODAY, AMERICANS ACROSS
THIS COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO
HELP PEOPLE LIKE BRENDA AND
HER NEIGHBORS.

RESCUE WORKERS WENT THROUGH
A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A
NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY AND
DID NOT FIND ANY MORE
VICTIMS.

RIGHT.

YOUR KIDS SEEM SO TIRED.

EARLIER TODAY OUR CASEY
STEGALL WENT OUT INTO ONE
OF THOSE SMALL SPACES AND
GOT A SENSE OF WHAT IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR
PEOPLE TO CLIMB BACK OUT
ONLY TO FIND HEIR HOMES
WERE I DON'T KNOW IF GONE.

I UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WOULD
BE.

BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGES
SHOW DESTRUCTION AT THAT
SCHOOL WHERE SEVEN CHILDREN
DIED.

WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

STAY RIGHT THERE SCOTT, SO
YOU YOU CAN SEE IT BACK
BEHIND YOU.

YOU REMEMBER SHE WAS
PIVOTAL IN THE BOSTON
BOMBING INVESTIGATION AS
WELL IN TERMS OF KEEPING
THE PRESIDENT IN THE LOOP
ABOUT THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENT.
