BLOCK PERIMETER, IT DIDN'T
TALK LONG TO GET THE GUY.

THIS IS NOT THE LAW, SHEP.

THERE IS IT BLOOD ON THE
OUTSIDE OF IT .

HOLD YOUR FIRE.

A SIMILAR THING HAPPENED IN
FEN WAY.

MY QUESTION IS A BIGGER
ONE.

OUR STATION IN BOSTON THAT
UN-- INVAL AUTOMOBILE.

A PHOTY OF THE BOAT IN THE
CENTER OF THE STAND OFF.

THEY COULD DETERMINE IF THERE
INTELLIGENCE OR NOT.

WE WERE FOUR HOUSES DOWN AND
WE ARE RIGHT THERE ON TOP OF
IT WE KEPT THE FILM ROLING AND
KIND OF DUCKED DOWN A LITTLE
BIT.

PART OF THAT AND I AM NOT JUST
PATTING THE F.B.I.

SUBJECT IS IN CUSTODY.

BUT MOST OF THEIR HISTORIC
ATTACKS ARE AGAINST THE
RUSSIAN ENTITIES.

HE DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO
AN ATTORNEY.

THE MILITARY TRIBUNAL IDEA
FELL OUT OF FAVOR.

IN 2011, THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT ASKED THE F.B.I.

IS WORKING
THROUGH A LONG LAUNDRY LIST
AND THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE
FEBRUARY FIB TASK FORCE SAID
THE VOLUME .

A PARTY TRYING TO POKE A HOLE
IN THE BOAT.

LAST NIGHT IN WATTWATT,
SCOW MANY PEOPLE HUDDLED IN L
HOUSES.

WE TRIED TO TALK TO HIM AND WE
WERE IN 15 OR 20 MINUTES OF
HARD NEGOTIATION AND MAKING
DEMANDS OF HIM AND HE DID NOT
RESPOND.
