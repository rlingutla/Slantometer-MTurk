MAYBE EVEN MONTHS.

IN YOBACOA, THE TOWN DECIMATED
BY A DIRECT HIT, WE FIND
DESPERATE RESIDENTS LINING UP
FOR WATER THAT'S BEEN TRUCKED
IN.

ORTEZ FLAGGED US DOWN.

AROUND PUERTO RICO IN DIRE
CONDITIONS.

THE ENTIRE ISLAND STILL WITHOUT
POWER.

THIS MAN, CLINGING TO LIFE.

FRAIL, DEHYDRATING IN THE
SWELTERING ROOMS.

AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, RIGHT
HERE TONIGHT, OUR ROB MARCIANO
TAKES US TO THE PART OF THE
ISLAND WHERE THE HURRICANE MADE
LANDFALL.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

IT'S ABOUT 90 MILES
EAST-SOUTHEAST OF GRAND TURK
ISLAND.

THE GOVERNOR OUT WITH THE
NATIONAL GUARD OVERNIGHT OUTSIDE
SAN JUAN RESCUING THE STRANDED.

I JUST WANT TO SAY, DANEESA,
I LOVE YOU.

HURRICANE WARNINGS ARE UP THERE.

AND YOUR FORECAST TAKES IT A LOT
FARTHER NORTH AND INTO THE OPEN
OCEAN, AND LIKELY KEEPS IT
THERE.

AS THE STORM BORE DOWN ON THE
ISLAND, MANY HAD NO SAFE PLACE
TO GO.

TONIGHT, WHAT WE'VE LEARNED
ABOUT THOSE AMERICANS, AS WE NOW
SEE THE CATASTROPHIC IMAGES
COMING IN.

A LITTLE BIT BETTER ABOUT THE
EAST COAST OF THE U.S.

AND IT'S BACK UP TO CATEGORY 3
STATUS, SO, FORMIDABLE STORM.

HURRICANE MARIA, THE WORST STORM
TO BATTER THAT ISLAND IN NEARLY
A CENTURY.

OVERWHELMING RIVERS IN
LEVITTOWN.
