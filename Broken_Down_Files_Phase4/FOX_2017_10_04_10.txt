ALL THROUGH THE CAMPAIGN AND
AS PRESIDENT, SHEP, PRESIDENT
TRUMP REALLY WAS A CHAMPION OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL US.

HER SISTERS SAY NO WAY.

THE MASS MURDER TOOK PLACE
SUNDAY NIGHT FILLS AMERICA'S
HEART WITH GRIEF.

IT TENDS TO CLEAR UP.

VINCENT PUT HIS WIFE IN A PLACE
THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE SAFE
FOR HER WHILE HE HELPED OTHER
PEOPLE TO SCRAMBLE FOR SAFETY.

THE SPIC YOULATION IS THAT HE
SENT IT TO HER BECAUSE HE KNEW
AS SOON AS HE COMMITTED THE
CRIME THAT ALL OF HIS ASSETS
WOULD BE LOCKED DOWN POSSIBLY
FOREVER AND SHE WOULDN'T GET ANY
KIND OF MONEY OUT OF THAT AT
ALL.

WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE HOW WE'RE
GOING TO LIVE EACH DAY.

ALL INVESTIGATIVE LEADS,
EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE
FUNNELS THROUGH HERE.

YOU CAN IMAGINE, YOU CAN
PROBABLY COUNT ON ONE HAND THE
NUMBER OF HOURS OF SLEEP HE'S
HAD.

AS WE CONTINUE HERE ON FOX NEWS
CHANNEL, WE'RE WAITING FOR THESE
FIRST RESPONDERS TO MEET WITH
THE PRESIDENT AND WE'LL HAVE
THAT LIVE FOR YOU IN JUST A
MOMENT.

THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TOURING
THE COMMAND FACILITY THERE.

WE WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIDE.

THERE'S MULTIPLE SHOTS COMING
UP THERE.

THAT'S COMING UP ON THE FOX NEWS
DECK THIS AFTERNOON.

NEWLY RELEASED VIDEO SHOWS WHAT
THEY WERE UP AGAINST.

JUST REMARKABLE STORIES,
SHEP, OF HOW EVERYBODY IN THIS
AREA WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE
MEDICAL COMMUNITY PITCHED IN.

THE WHITE HOUSE POOL WHICH
FOLLOWS THE PRESIDENT EVERYWHERE
HE GOES.

STILL A LITTLE BIT SOON.

HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE WHEN HE
KNEW THEY WERE COMING IN THROUGH
THE DOOR.
