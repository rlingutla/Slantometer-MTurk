NATIONAL SECURITY IS
STRENGTHENED WHEN WE HOLD
ACCOUNTABLE THOSE WHO
VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL
NORMS.

IF ANY AGGRESSION WERE
TO TAKE PLACE, WE HAVE TWO
OPTIONS.

OR NO ACTION.

JOE BIDEN SAID THERE IS NO
DOUBT WHO IS TO BLAME.

CHUCK HAGEL SPOKE TO HIS
BRITISH AND FRENCH COUNTER
PARTS BY PHONE TODAY.

ANY PLANS TO SECURE ASSAD'S
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD
REQUIRE SPECIAL OPERATIONS
AND BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED
HUNDREDS THERE.

BUT SYRIA REMAINS
DEFIANT.

THE WHITE HOUSE PLANS TO
SHOW SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WAS
BEHIND THE ATTACK.

ALSO WORTH NOTING BILL
THAT THE BRITISH PRIME
MINISTER HAS RECALLED
PARLIAMENT FROM ITS SUMMER
RECESS.

LEAST SOME OF THEM ANY WAY
SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD NOT
BE SOME SORT OF SYMBOLIC
HIT OR ATTACK, ED?

BUT THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO
EXPLAIN THE MISSION TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MCCAIN
SAYING TONIGHT HE CAN'T
JUST BE SOME SYMBOLIC MOVE
TO BACK UP THE PRESIDENT'S
RHETORIC FROM LAST SUMMER
ABOUT A RED LINE ON
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
IS GOING TO OPERATE
UNILATERALLY WITHOUT
CONGRESS.

MEANTIME, THE SPOKESMAN FOR
THE U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL
SAYS DIPLOMACY IS STILL BY
FAR THE PREFERRED MEANS OF
ENDING THIS CRISIS.

SAYING THERE MUST BE A
RESPONSE TO LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

AND THE WORLD SHUNNED
DISTANT IDOLLY BY.

WHAT WOULD A U.S. MILITARY
STRIKE LOOK LIKES A IT
STANDS NOW?

TO SURRENDER OR TO DEFEND
OURSELVES USING THE OPTIONS
AVAILABLE.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE
BBC, HAGEL SAID U.S.
WARSHIPS ARE STANDING BY
AWAITING ORDERS.

NOW THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS
THERE IS NO DOUBT THE U.S.
WILL RESPOND.
