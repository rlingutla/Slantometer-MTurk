POLICE AT THE INITIAL PRESS
CONFERENCE WARNING DOWNTOWN
BOSTON TO STAY CALM, BUT THE
-- ADMITTING THE STREETS WERE
NOT SAFE.

AND WERE YOU ABLE TO HELP
PEOPLE?

SHORTLY BEFORE WE CAME ON THE
AIR, THE PRESIDENT ADDRESSED THE
NATION.

THINKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT,
KEEP REMEMBER HEARING HOW THEY
RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE DANGER,
NOT THINKING.

WE HAVE A PHOTO OF THE CALL HE
HAD WITH FBI DIRECTOR MULLER IN
THE OVAL OFFICE.

SOUNDS LIKE THE BEST ADVICE
IS DON'T LET THEM AFFECT YOUR
LIFE, LIVE YOUR LIFE?

IT SOUNDED JUST LIKE A
BOMB -- WHAT I THOUGHT I BOMB
WOULD SOUND LIKE.

I DO NOT HAVE ANY FRIENDS WHO
WERE INJURED, THANKFULLY.

AGAIN, THAT WAS ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY THEY THOUGHT THIS
WAS SOME SORT OF PACKAGE LEFT
BEHIND IN THE MIDST OF THAT
CROWD TO HARM EVERYONE IN THE
IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY.

WE'RE RECOMMENDING TO PEOPLE
THAT THEY STAY HOME, THAT IF
THEY'RE IN MOTELS IN THE AREA,
THAT THEY RETURN TO THEIR ROOMS,
AND THAT THEY DON'T GO ANY PLACE
AND CONGREGATE IN LARGE CROWDS.

AND PEOPLE SHOULDN'T JUMP TO
CONCLUSIONS BEFORE WE HAVE ALL
THE FACTS.

FINISH LINE, BLEACHERS FILLED
WITH SPECTATORS, STUNNED AND
CONFUSED BY THE FIRST BLAST,
THEN WATCH IN HORROR AS 50 TO A
HUNDRED YARDS AWAY, A SECOND
EXPLOSION.

IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY
SOMETHING.

EYEWITNESSES SAY THE INJURED
WERE PILED ON THE SIDEWALK,
SEVERED LIMBS LITTERING THE
STREET, ONLOOKERS COMFORTING
EACH OTHER AS THE VIOLENCE AND
CHAOS ENGULFED THEM.

I SAW A WOMAN WHO APPEARED TO
HAVE LOST A GOOD PORTION OF HER
JAW.

I WAS IN THE CITY.

WE STILL DO NOT KNOW WHO DID
THIS OR WHY.

WE ALL JUST MOVED OUT OF THE WAY
FOR THEM.

PANICKING, AND ANOTHER BOMB WENT
OFF.

BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE WILL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, AND WE
WILL FIND OUT WHO DID THIS,
WE'LL FIND OUT WHY THEY DID
THIS.
