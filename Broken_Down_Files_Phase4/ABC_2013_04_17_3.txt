THE FBI PUT THAT PLANE BACK
TOGETHER JUST AS THEY ARE TODAY
PUTTING THE BOMBS BACK TOGETHER.

ARE ALSO EXAMINING TINY BITS OF
DEBRIS RECOVERED AT THE CRIME
SCENE.

THEY HAVE SET UP FACILITIES AT
A RESTRICTED LOCATION NEAR THE
BOSTON HARBOR.

NEW LEADS ON THE BOMBER AT THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

â™ª
 WE'RE STRONG PEOPLE AND WE'RE
NOT GOING TO LET ANYONE PUSH US
AROUND.

IS ARRESTED WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY FACE AT LEAST THREE
COUNTS OF PREMEDITATED MURDER,
FOR THE DEATHS OF 8-YEAR-OLD
MARTIN RICHARD, 29-YEAR-OLD
KRYSTLE CAMPBELL, AND THE THIRD
VICTIM IDENTIFIED JUST TODAY,
BOSTON UNIVERSITY GRADUATE
STUDENT LINGZI LU, A NATIVE OF
CHINA.

EVERYBODY WAS LENDING A HAND --
AND THESE ARE COMPLETE
STRANGERS.

AND FINALLY TONIGHT, WE WERE
GLAD SO MANY OF YOU LOVED
HEARING THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON
SEND OUT THEIR OWN MESSAGE TO
THE WORLD LAST NIGHT.

WE BEGIN IN BOSTON TONIGHT AMID
REPORTS OF A BREAK IN THE CASE.

SO WE MAY BE IN ONE OF THOSE
CASES THAT GETS CRACKED QUICKLY.

BUT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE
FORCED A POSTPONEMENT OF A NEWS
CONFERENCE WHERE OFFICIALS HAD
PLANNED TO TALK ABOUT A POSSIBLE
SUSPECT.

AND ON THAT VERY NOTE, STAY
WITH US, BECAUSE ALL THE PEOPLE
AROUND THE COUNTRY WERE SINGING
BOSTON'S FAVORITE ANTHEM TODAY.

THAT'S WHO WE ARE.

TONIGHT, BREAK IN THE CASE.

NOTHING THESE TERRORISTS DO
WILL SHAKE THEM.

THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS A
THOUSAND AGENTS ASSIGNED TO THIS
CASE.

TONIGHT THERE'S A SENSE FROM
MANY OF THEM THAT THEY'RE
GETTING MUCH CLOSER.

THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

IN THIS INVESTIGATION, THERE
WILL BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
IMAGES.

THIS IS AMERICA, AND EVEN
GREATER THAN THAT, THIS IS
BOSTON -- A HOME OF THE PATRIOT.
