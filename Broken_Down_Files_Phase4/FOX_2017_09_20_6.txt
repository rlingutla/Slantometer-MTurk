STEVE, LOOKS LIKE THINGS HAVE
CALMED DOWN.

THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

THESE GUYS BACK HERE ARE
INCREDIBLY DEDICATED.

I'M SPEAKING WITH YOU.

THE HOUSE JUST TREMBLED DURING
THIS SITUATION.

UNFORTUNATELY, CUTTING A CROSS
DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE ISLAND.

GONZALEZ COLON, THERE'S SO MANY
PUERTO RICANS, THERE'S SO MANY
CONCERNED ABOUT THE AREA OUTSIDE
OF THE CAPITOL.

THEY HAVE 100% OF THE POWER OFF.

THE PRESIDENT REMAINS VERY
ENGAGED AND HIS MESSAGE IS TAKE
CARE OF PEOPLE.

THAT'S ON TOP OF THE DEVASTATION
THAT HURRICANE IRMA HAS JUST
LEFT BEHIND.

THEY EXPERIENCED SOME DAMAGE TO
HOSPITALS, WHICH WERE ALREADY
WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO
ALLEVIATE SOME OF THOSE IMPACTS.

THIS WILL COMPOUND THE PROBLEMS.

THEN IT CONTINUES TO PULL TO THE
NORTH.

WE SIGNED UP FOR THIS JOB AND
DEDICATED TO HELPING THE
GOVERNORS ACHIEVE THEIR RESPONSE
GOALS AND HELP PEOPLE.

THEN ONCE WE WORK WITH THE
GOVERNORS, THERE WILL BE OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT
VOLUNTEER AND DONATIONS TO EACH
ONE OF THE TERRITORIES.

SHE'S PUERTO RICO'S RESIDENT
COMMISSIONER.

OF COURSE, THE WHOLE ISLAND IS
WITHOUT POWER.

CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING THROUGH
THIS THING?

ROADS, BRIDGES AND MANY
HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN HIT DIRECTLY
BY THIS HURRICANE.

SAYING I WANT TO HELP BUT NOT
SURE HOW TO DO IT, WHAT DO YOU
TELL THEM?
