EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS
BEEN IN OPERATIONS FOR A
LONG TIME, JUST
DISAPPEARING, GOING OFF THE
RADAR SCREEN ENTIRELY IS A
VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS.

THE TAKE AWAY IS THAT
MORRELL'S RESIGNATION IS
NOT AT ALL CONNECTED TO
THESE NSA SCANDALS, SHEP.

EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO IS
TRAINED.

FALSE.

FIGHT FOR AN ADULT LUNG
TRANSPLANT FINALLY GETS THE
SURGERY THAT COULD SAVE HER

WHEN WE ASKED WHETHER OR
NOT IT'S ACCEPTABLE
UNACCEPTABLE INVADES

YOU NEED TO COLLECT AWFUL
OF THE TELEPHONE CALLS MADE
IN THE 312 AREA CODE ON THE
CHANCE THAT ONE OF THOSE
PERSONS MIGHT BE ON THE
OTHER END OF THE PHONE.

SOME DID ASK WHY IS THE
GOVERNMENT STOCKPILING THE
PHONE RECORDS OF MILLIONS
OF INNOCENT AMERICANS?

THAT'S ONE OF THE GRAVE
CONCERNS WE HAVE THAT IN OUR
NETWORKS, THE SYSTEM
ADMINISTRATION OF THOSE
NETWORKS, I.T.

WITH A 702 SET OF
INFORMATION, BASED ON
OPERATIVES OVERSEAS WE SAW
CONNECTIONS INTO A PERSON
IN COLORADO.

WHAT ELSE DID WE LEARN AT
THESE HEARINGS TODAY,
CATHERINE.
