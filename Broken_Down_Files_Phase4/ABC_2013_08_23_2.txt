NOW REVEALING THE SYMPTOMS THEY
ARE TREATING.

AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
FORTHCOMING IN SAYING THAT RISK
MUST BE LOW.

THE SUBJECT WAS SYRIA AND
POSSIBLE RESPONSES BY THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

TONIGHT VOLUNTEERS, DOCTORS
WITHOUT BORDERS, INSIDE SYRIA,
TREATING PATIENTS.

UN OFFICIALS IN SYRIA ARE
PUSHING FOR ACCESS TO THE SITE
FOR INSPECTION.

THE PRESIDENT HUDDLING WITH
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, DOCTORS
ON THE GROUND TREATING THOUSANDS
OF PATIENTS, REVEALING THE
SYMPTOMS  TONIGHT.

THE PRESIDENT SPENT THE DAY
HUDDLED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM,
WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE AND HIS
MILITARY OPTIONS.

TONIGHT, EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL
ATTACK IN SYRIA IS MOUNTING.

AMERICAN WARSHIPS BEING
REPOSITIONED, WHAT IS COMING
NEXT?

THIS PROMPTED THE MEETING.

SAYING MORE THAN 3,000 PATIENTS
WERE RUSHED IN WITH WHAT THEY
CALL NEUROTOXIN SYMPTOMS,
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'D SEE IN A
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

BUT WITH THESE URGENT MEETINGS,
AND HIS STRONG LANGUAGE, IT
SUGGESTS HE MAY BE CHANGING HIS
MIND.

GROWING PROOF THAT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED TO
KILL MORE THAN 1,000 IN SYRIA,
AMONG THEM SO MANY CHILDREN.

U.S. FIGHTER JETS COULD ALSO
ATTACK FIRING FROM OUTSIDE
SYRIAN AIR SPACE, SOAPY LOTS
WOULD BE OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

THE WHITE HOUSE REVEALING THE
PRESIDENT DID SPEAK WITH BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON
TODAY.

CONFIRMS THE
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

WE BEGIN WITH THAT GROWING
URGENCY OVER SYRIA.
