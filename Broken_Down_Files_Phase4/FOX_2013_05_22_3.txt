ONE OF THE BIGGEST STARS IN
ALL OF COUNTRY MUSIC COMES
HOME.

HE WAS HERE ONMOND AND FLEW
FROM NASHVILE HOURS BEFORE
THE DISASTER.

BECAUSE THE GOAL NOW IS TO
GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES.

I KNEW YOU WERE HERE
BECAUSE I SAW YOUR NAME ON
THE WATER TOWER.

I'M SO PROUD TO BE THEIR
TEACHER BECAUSE THEY ARE
REMARKABLE AND RESILIENT
CHILDREN.

GROUND LOOK NOW OWE
INCREDIBLE CEFINGS OF
MONDAY'S TORNADO HERE IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

PUT THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR
HEAD AND PUT THEIR HEADS
YOU KNOW, DOWN.

ALSO DRONING AMERICANS.

THE LATEST OFFICIAL
ESTIMATES INDICATE THIS
TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR
DESTROYED UP TO 13,000
HOMES.

EAST OF TOWN.

GETTING CELL TOWERS UP.

THEY HELPED TO UNWIND WIRES
AND METAL THAT HAD WRAPPED
AROUND ANOTHER STUDENT'S
LEGS.

WITNESSES SAY TWO MEN WITH
A BUTCHER KNIFE OR MULTIPLE
KNIVES KILLED A MAN, HACKED
HIM TO DEATH.

THROUGHOUT THIS AREA, NOW
THE PATH OF THE DESTRUCTION
IS THINNER.

BUT IF YOUR HOME WAS IN
THAT AREA, YOUR HOME IS
DESTROYED.


I'M NOT SURE I HAVE MET
ANYBODY AS BRAVE OR AS
REMARKABLE AS THERESA
MOSIER HERSELF.

THEY WEREN'T PART OF THAT
STRUCTURE.

THERE IS NOT A ONE OF US IN
THAT BUILDING THAT WOULD
NOT HAVE LAID DOWN OUR
LIVES FOR THOSE KIDS.

THE AFTERMATH OF THE
APPARENT TERROR ATTACK IN
LONDON.

OFFICIALS HAVE JUST
ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE NOW
FOUND SIX PEOPLE WHO WERE
STILL MISSING AFTER
MONDAY'S KILLER TORNADO.
