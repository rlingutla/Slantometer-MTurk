YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT THERE.

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE
GOTTEN OUT A CHANCE TO LOOK AT
BEYOND DAMAGE THAT YOU ARE
SUFFERING BUT I'M CURIOUS TO
KNOW WITH US PEOPLE   BECAUSE PEOPLE
WATCH WILLING
SAY WICHITA IS A BIG CITY AND
IT IS FAIRLY RARE FOR POPULATED
AREAS TO GET HIT LIKE THIS.

GETTING INTO HEAVILY POPULATED
AREAS HERE.

SO YOU HAVE GOT THE VERY WARM
HUMID AIR MASS AND WARM
MOISTURE COMING IN FROM THE
GULF OF MEXICO.

THEN WE HAVE ALL OF THAT
MOISTURE I MEAN THE DEW POINTS
IN THE AREA, THE MOISTURE
CONTENT IN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS
IS OPPRESSIVE.

MONDAY STILL OKLAHOMA CITY UP
TOWARDS JOPLIN AND ALL OF THE
AREAS IN YELLOW HERE, YOU ARE
NOT OUT OF THE RISK ZONE.

MICHELLE PUT SOME STREETS ON
THERE AGAIN FOR US, PLEASE.

FORT DODGE.

EDMOND, OKLAHOMA, WE ARE
SEEING IT NOW.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON ANOTHER
ROAD COMING INTO SHAWNEE.

WE HAD SOME SIGHTINGS.

IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IN
OKLAHOMA CITY, AS IT FACES OUT
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION THE BLUE
SKIES ALTHOUGH THEY STILL LOOK
RATHER I DON'T KNOW PROBLEMATIC
POTENTIALLY BUT AT LEAST IT IS
NOT AS ACTIVE AS WHAT WE JUST
SAW.

CASEY CASEY CAN YOU HEAR
ME.

WHEN IT DOES COME TO OUR AREA,
YOU JUST GET IN THE CAR AND YOU
HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT.

I'M HERE, THANK YOU.

MEET KAREN PETERSON ON THE
GROUND IN EDMOND, OKLAHOMA.

MIGHT WANT TO HEAD BACK
TOWARDS SHAWNEE AND HEAD SOUTH.

WE HE KNOW THAT A MONSTER STORM
TOUCHED DOWN THERE TWISTER
OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA CITY.

EMILY, YOU WITNESSED SOME OF
THIS BECAUSE THIS VIDEO IS
TAKEN FROM EDMOND.

WHO IS BEING CAREFUL.
