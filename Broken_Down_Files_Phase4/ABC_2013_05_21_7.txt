THIS IS THE SCENE ALL OVER THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.

AND TONIGHT THE RESCUE EFFORT IS
UNDER WAY TO FIND AND CARE FOR
THESE SURVIVORS TOO.

TEACHER WHOSE PRAYER WAS
ANSWERED, TONIGHT A PRAYER FOR
THE TEACHERS AT THE OTHER
SCHOOL.

I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE WE
SURVIVED THAT.

A MAN IN A ROCKING CHAIR, AND
ALL THOSE FIREMEN MOVING IN TO
HELP.

A THANK YOU FROM MOM, AND A
PROUD TEACHER ANSWERS.

I WANT YOU TO STAY.

HER BODY ON TOP OF HIS AND
SEVERAL OTHERS AS THEY CRIED FOR
THEIR MOMS.

HEROES, THE TEACHERS DETERMINED
TO MAKE SURE THEIR STUDENTS
WOULD MAKE IT HOME TO THEIR
PARENTS.

NANCY E.
SHE CAN TELL A STORY THAT
PERHAPS NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD
CAN TELL.

THE WOMAN WITH A ONE IN A
MILLION CHARM --
 YOU'RE STILL TAKING THAT
PICTURE.

AT THE OTHER, THEY WERE STILL
HOPING FOR A MIRACLE TODAY.

THE FRANTIC SEARCH FOR
SURVIVORS CONTINUES.

AND THERE WAS THIS FATHER AS
PANICKED AS ANY PARENT WOULD BE.

AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE NOT
BEING ABLE TO GIVE THOSE KIDS
BACK TO THEIR PARENTS THAT
BROUGHT THEM TO ME THAT MORNING.

WHEN AUTHORITIES WERE ASKED
ABOUT THAT LATE TODAY, THEY
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE SIMPLY
ISN'T THE FUNDING TO PUT SAFE
ROOMS IN EVERY SCHOOL.

WELL, TONIGHT, YOU'RE GOING TO
MEET A WOMAN WHO LIVED THAT ONE
IN 100 TRILLION SHOT AND ABC'S
METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE TAKES
US TO SEE HER.

THE AMERICAN FLAG RISING IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, TONIGHT.

THE LORD GIVETH, AND THE LORD
TAKETH AWAY.

I KNOW HE IS AND I'M GRINNING.
