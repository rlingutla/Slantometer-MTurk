COMING UP INSIDE OF THE FOX
REPORT RETIRED FOUR STAR GENERAL
AND JACK KING WILL JOIN US.

THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE MISSION
TO GO AND DO AN INVESTIGATION TO
GET AT THE ROCKETS THAT WERE
FIRED AND WHERE WERE THEY FIRED
FROM AND WITNESSES TO SEE THAT.

WE KNOW IT IS A CHEMICAL ATTACK
TAKING PLACE.

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE
NEXT STEP IN SYRIA LOCKS LIKE.

YOU KNOW, IT IS SO
FRUSTRATING TO WATCH THIS
HAPPEN.

IF THEY CROSS THE REDLINE BY
USING CHEMICAL WEAPONS WHICH WE
HAVE REPORTS AND PICTURES
PREVIOUSLY AND WE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING AFTER THAT THREAT AND
YOU SAY WE DIDN'T HOLD A STRONG
LINE THEN?

JUST FROM THE AIR.

OTHERWISE HIS CREDIBILITY IS
GRAVELY DAMAGED AND THAT'S WHERE
WE ARE AT THE MOMENT.

THAT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
TALKED ABOUT A SHORT TIME AGO
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

IN FACT, THE NUMBER OF SYRIAN
REFUGEE CHILDREN IS AT 1
MILLION.

IT IS DISCERNIBLE RATHER
QUICKLY.

I BELIEVE WE SHOULD USE THIS
OPPORTUNITY NOT TO MAKE
A STATEMENT ATTACK BUT ELIMINATE
AND DEGRADE ONE OF HIS MAJOR
CAPABILITIES AND THE FIRST ONE
HE VALUES IS AIR POWER.

WE CAN ABSOLUTELY RENDER
A SIGNIFICANT BLOW TO HIM IF WE
CHOOSE TO DO THAT USING HIS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AS A REASON FOR
IT.

THERE IS NO ENTERTAINING THE
THOUGHT OF BEING ON THE GROUND
WITH OUR TROOPS IS WHERE YOU GET
IN MISSION CREEPS AND MORE
MISSION AND CHALLENGES.

THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE TONE
A STATEMENT ATTACK AND WHAT YOU
THINK IS REALLY NECESSARY HERE.

I THINK WE CAN DETERMINE.

WHO DID IT IS THE ISSUE THEN?

AND MORE LIKELY IS TO STAND OFF
IN THE MED TERRANNIAN AND
SURFACE SHIP SUBMARINE AND USED
PRECISION GUYEDED AMMUNITION IN
SYRIA THAT WILL BE OF VALUE TO
HIM.

IS THAT PART OF OUR MISSION,
TOO?

MOLLY, ON THE STORY ON WHICH
WE HAVE SEEN MOVEMENT SO MUCH.
