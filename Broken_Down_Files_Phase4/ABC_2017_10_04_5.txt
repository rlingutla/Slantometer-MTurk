FEDERAL SOURCES SAY HE LOOKED
INTO RENTING A ROOM IN THIS
BUILDING RIGHT NEXT TO ANOTHER
MUSIC FESTIVAL JUST THE WEEK
BEFORE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP, MEANWHILE,
WAS HERE IN LAS VEGAS TODAY.

BEFORE S.W.A.T.

AND WHAT WE'VE JUST LEARNED
ABOUT THE GUNMAN.

OUR TEAM STANDING BY.

ALL RIGGED SO HE COULD SEE
POLICE APPROACHING.

AND FROM THIS PERCH, HE WOULD
HAVE HAD A CLEAR FIELD OF FIRE,
RIGHT DOWN INTO THOSE TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO
THAT CONCERT BELOW.

INVESTIGATORS WANT TO KNOW IF HE
WENT ALONG WHEN SHE TRAVELED TO
DUBAI, WHERE SHE POSTED THIS
SMILING PHOTO.

AN HOUR LATER, THEY BREACHED THE
DOOR --
HIM ALREADY DEAD.

AND HAILED AS A HERO.

FINALLY TONIGHT, AMERICA
STRONG.

GOOD TRADEOFF.

TONIGHT, THE NEW STORIES NOW
EMERGING OF THE QUIET HEROES WHO
SAVED SO MANY LIVES HERE.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD YOUR REPORT
THERE, THE SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND
SPENT HOURS TODAY TALKING TO THE
FBI.

HE'S AN ANGEL AND SAVED HIM.

BUT TONIGHT, SHE REMAINS A
PERSON OF INTEREST, AS THEY NOW
ASK, HOW THE GUNMAN ASSEMBLED
SUCH AN ARSENAL WITHOUT ANYONE
NOTICING.

DID SHE KNOW ANYTHING?

GET OUT OF HERE, THERE'S
GUNSHOTS COMING FROM OVER THERE.

AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLE THING TO
SEE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HERE IN LAS
VEGAS.
