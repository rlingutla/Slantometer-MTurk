ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES IS THAT
THE RIVERS OVERFLOWED THEIR
BANKS.

SO IT'S REALLY SCARY.

SHE SAID THE WINDS ARE LIKE
SOMETHING OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE.

WE RECEIVED BETWEEN 12 TO 35
INCHES OF RAIN DURING THIS DAY.

I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO STEVE
HARRIGAN WHO IS LIVE IN SAN JUAN
FOR US THIS AFTERNOON.

THAT SAID, TOO EARLY TO SAY WHAT
THE IMPACTS ARE.

AS YOU SAID, THERE'S FOUR
MILLION AMERICAN CITIZENS HERE.

ALL OF THEM GOING UP INCREDIBLY
FAST.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS?

THEY DIE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND
SALUTE THE SAME FLAG.

THE GOAL IS LIFE SAFETY, LIFE
SUSTAINING MISSIONS BY GETTING
COMMODITIES IN.

THE STORM ON THE SOUTHEAST COAST
OF THE ISLAND WITH SUSTAINED
WINDS OF 155 MILES AN HOUR.

WE ARE STILL HAVING WINDS MORE
THAN 60 MILES PER HOUR.

WE'LL SEARCH AND RESCUE AND A
LET'S GET TO RICK REICHMUTH IN
THE EXTREME WEATHER CENTER, THIS
IS AWFUL.

A HORRIBLE FORM.

I'M STILL HAVING HEAVY WINDS IN
MY OWN HOUSE.

WE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF
HURRICANE BEFORE.

IF YOUR HOUSE IS MADE OF WOOD
WITH A METAL ROOF, JUST GONE.

NO LIGHTS, NO WAY TO GET HELP,
NO IDEA WHETHER YOUR HOME WILL
STAND UP OR FALL DOWN AROUND
YOU.

WE'RE ALSO GETTING A LOOK AT THE
DEVASTATION ON THE SMALL ISLAND
DOMINIQUE.
