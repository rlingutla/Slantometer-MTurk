SO WE HAVE THESE TWO GUIDANCE
TICK CELLS.

TO THE RIGHT IS THE SYSTEM ON
THE MAP.

TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT
YOU ARE SEEING?

ABOUT HOW THEY WILL SIT AND
LOOK HUGE AND GO RIGHT BACK UP
IN THE SKY AND IT IS REALLY
DIFFICULT TO SEE THEM COMING
SOMETIMES BECAUSE MANY OF THEM
HAVE BEEN RAIN-SOAKED.

OUR METEOROLOGISTS IN THIS
COMMUNITY DID A GREAT JOB OF
WARNING EVERYBODY FOR SEVERAL
DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS EVENT.

EARLIER TODAY IT WAS COOKING
AND THEN IN JUST THE LAST 15-20
MINUTES WE ARE SEEING
TOUCHDOWNS.

ING TOLING BETWEEN OKLAHOMA
CITY VIDEO AND NOW LOOKING TEN
MILES OUTSIDE WICHITA KANSAS.

THESE ROGUE SUPERCELLS AND WHEN
YOU ARE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT
THAT IS WHEN WE PARTICULARLY
SEE THINGS START TO


A FANTASTIC WAY TO GET AN EYE
INTO THE STORM AND GENERALLY WE
LEAN ON THEM A LITTLE BIT BUT
HOPING EVERYBODY STAYS SAFE.

WE ARE ABOUT 55 MILES OR SO
SOUTH OF NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.

THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND INTO
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.

PROBABLE FOR THEM TO DO SOME
DAMAGE WHEN THEY DO AND IN FACT
SOME OF THE AREAS ARE NOW IN
TORNADO WARNING BEYOND JUST THE
THUNDERSTORM WARNING MEANING
THERE HAVE BEEN TOUCHDOWNS ON
THE GROUND.

THEY KNOW TORNADOES.

THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN TO A
LOT OF THE FORECASTERS AND
METEOROLOGISTS BECAUSE AS
JANICE DEAN WAS SAYING EARLIER
THIS HAS REALLY SORT OF BEEN
TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF WEATHER
THAT SETS UP FOR THE SUPERCELLS
AND CELLS THAT PRODUCE THE
TORNADOES.

THE WINDS WHIPPING AS FUNNEL
CLOUD IS TRYING TO HOLD ITSELF
TOGETHER AND DOING SO RATHER
IMPRESSIVELY.

THEN THE STORM SORT OF TRACKED
TO THE EAST OF OKLAHOMA.

UNTIL YOU SEE IT, IT REALLY
DOESN'T SEEM REAL TO YOU AND
HAVING LIVED IN KANSAS CITY FOR
MANY YEARS AND I HAVE SEEN THE
TORNADOIC SYSTEMS MOVE ACROSS
THE PLAINS, YOU CAN PICK THEM
UP AND WATCH THEM MOVE INTO
YOUR TOWN.

ARE IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE
THE CHASERS ON THE GROUND LIKE
THE VIDEO YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT
THERE.

DO A TON OF DAMAGE AND THEN
ASCEND BACK UP INTO THE CLOUDS
AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING
THROUGHOUT THE PORTIONS OF
OKLAHOMA THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER
THE GUN THE LAST FOUR HOURS OR
SO HARRIS.

WE ARE GETTING THE DEBRIS
SIGNATURE ON RADAR.
