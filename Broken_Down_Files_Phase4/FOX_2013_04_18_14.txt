GREG, GOOD EVENING TO YOU
THERE IN NEW YORK.

THE FIRST MAJOR SPORTING
EVENT OF ANY KIND HERE
SINCE THE BOMBINGS AND
BEFORE THE PUCK WAS
DROPPED.

AND THE BAD NEWS WHEN YOU
HEAR THEM GOING PUBLIC,
THAT TELLS YOU THAT THEY
HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL OF THE
LEADS THEY HAD TO THIS
POINT AND THEY DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHO THESE
INDIVIDUALS ARE.

THEY SIMPLY TAILED HIM.

HE THEY PUT HIM ON A NO FLY
LIST.

THAT'S THE ONE THAT THE TWO
GENTLEMEN WANT YOU TO CALL
IN DO NOT APPROACH THEM AND
LET THEM KNOW IF YOU KNOW
THESE TWO GENTLEMEN,
SOMEONE KNOWS THEM AND SEES
WHO WILL HE THEY ARE.

ONCE YOU HAVE THE SUSPECTS,
THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE
FALL TOGETHER.

INDICATES CLEARLY BILL THAT
THESE TWO WERE ASSOCIATED.

DO NOT TAKE ANY ACTION ON
YOUR OWN.

THE FBI'S CRIME LAB IN
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA ONGOING.

INDEED.

IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY STILL
NEED THE PUBLIC'S HELP IN
.

YOUR SOURCE TOLD YOU
SOMETHING TWO DAYS AGO YOU
SAID ABOUT A GUY WEARING A
WHITE BASEBALL CAP THAT WAS
TURNED BACK WARDZ.

NOW, WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE
COULD BE IMPORTANT HERE,
GREG?

THEY HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH
THOSE OVER THE LAST FEW
DAYS.

THEY SURVEILLED HIM.

DOWN THE STREET HERE FROM
OUR LOCATION.

AND THEY TALKED ABOUT
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 THAT YOU
WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT.

AND INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY
CONSIDER THE SUSPECT ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO WHAT
THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS
SAY.
