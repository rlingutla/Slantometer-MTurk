SHEP, IT'S ALL BEING CALLED
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THEIR
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
ALL AIMED AT SOUTH KOREA.

MICROSOFT HAD ITS
VULNERABILITIES IN THE SOFT WAY.

IN THE U.S., THEY MADE OUT
PRETTY WELL.

A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN NORTH
KOREA AND THE MASSIVE GLOBAL
CYBER ATTACK.

WE SAW, WE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,
BUT COMPANIES LIKE SAMANTAC AND
SOME LABS IN RUSSIA, THEY SAW
BITS AND PIECES OF THIS ATTACK
THAT WAS USED IN PREVIOUS
ATTACKS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS
HAD A HAND IN.

THOSE SAY THE CYBER ATTACK
COMPUTER FILES AND HEAD THEM
RANSOM.

WE KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT CAN MAKE
WHATEVER THEY DO LOOK LIKE
SOMEBODY ELSE DID IT?

EVERYTHING FROM UNIVERSITIES TO
GAS STATIONS.
