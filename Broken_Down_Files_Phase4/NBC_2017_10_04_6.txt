I WAS BLEEDING TO
DEATH.

HIS DAD DID NOT.

HE WANTED EVERYBODY
TO KNOW HOW MUCH HE
LOVED THEM, AND HE
WANTED ME TO TELL
THEM.

GET BACK!

SO FAR THEY SAY NO
OBVIOUS ANSWERS.

MANY WERE OFF DUTY AND
HAD COME FROM ALL OVER
TO ENJOY SOME GOOD
MUSIC WHEN SUDDENLY
THE SHOOTING BEGAN.

EVERYBODY HAS A
ROLE IN SECURITY.

I STARTED LOOKING
AROUND LIKE I REALLY
DON'T WANT TO DIE.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS SAY
12 OF THE 23 RIFLES
FOUND IN PADDOCK'S
HOTEL ROOM WERE
EQUIPPED WITH BUMP
STOCKS TO MAKE THEM
FIRE LIKE MACHINE GUNS
AND CLIPS TO HOLD 60
TO 100 ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION.

THAT WAS THE LAST
THING HE SAID TO ME.

I'M GOING.

WE WILL NEVER LEAVE
YOUR SIDE.

THEY WERE GOING TO
STAY AT THAT HOTEL.

THE QUESTION NOW
WHETHER THAT TALK WILL
TURN TO ACTION.

WE DON'T HAVE THOSE
SORT OF INDICATORS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND THE FIRST LADY, AS
WE SAID EARLIER, MADE
THEIR WAY HERE TO LAS
VEGAS TODAY MEETING
WITH VICTIMS AND THEIR
FAMILIES, THANKING
FIRST RESPONDERS AND
MEDICAL STAFF OF THEIR
HEROIC EFFORTS AND
DELIVERING A MESSAGE
FROM THE NATION TO
THIS HEARTBROKEN CITY.

FOR SOME REPUBLICANS,
A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

I'M GOING.

OUT OF EVERYONE WHO
WAS RUNNING AWAY AND
SCREAMING, THERE WERE
A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING
TOWARD IT TO HELP.

GO THAT WAY!
