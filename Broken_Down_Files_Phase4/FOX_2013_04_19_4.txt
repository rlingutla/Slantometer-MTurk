IT SEEMS THAT FRIDAY
EVENING THAT THINGS MAY
FINALLY BE COMING TO A
CLOSE.

I WAS TALKING WITH FRED I
SAID THIS IS GOING DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SWAT
TEAM WAS SENDING IN SOME
KIND OF A ROBOTIC DEVICE TO
THAT AREA.

IN ADDITION, THE BOSTON
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS SENT
OUT AN URGENT TWEET OVER
TWITTER SAYING THAT BOSTON
IS BACK TO A -- SHELTER IN
PLACE ORDER FOR THE
CITIZENS OF THIS CIT
IN THE WAKE OF THIS
BREAKING NEWS, THE HOPE IS
THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IS
DOWN, THAT THERE A
OTHERS INVOLVED IN THIS AND
THAT BOSTON CAN REST A
LITTLE BIT MORE EASILY
TONIGHT.

WE HAD SEVERAL CALLS INTO
THE NEWSROOM.

AND AS A RESULT, SHE CALLS
UP AND SAYS PLEASE COME
CHECK THIS OUT.

AGAIN, WE ARE VERY
INTERESTED TO KNOW WHO THIS
SUSPECT IS.

I SEE TWO MEN IN THE FRONT
OF THAT.

LOOKING AT POLICE, THEY
DON'T SEEM TO BE MOVING
VERY QUICKLY.

A VERY QUIET CROWD RIGHT
NOW.

WE JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
WE WOULD GO WALK THE DOG.

WHY -- WENF
WATERTOWN AND POLICE ARE
RESPONDING.

MAN IS STILL INSIDE THE
BOAT AND REFUSING TO COME
OUT.

AS WE ARE SEEING HERE THERE
IS A TRAILER TO PULL THE
BOAT AND POTENTIALLY HE WAS
UP UNDER THE CANOPY THAT
CAME IN FROM JARED
HOLBROOK.

HEATHER HEARD FROM A SOURCE   A SUSPECT
IS DOWN.

WE HAD TO JUMP OUT OF THE
WAY.

WE HAVE HEARD I WOULD
SAY 8 TO 10 EXPLOSIONS IN
TOTAL.

RIGHT.

THERE IS AN ARMORED VEHICLE
JUST PULLING UP TO THE
SCENE RIGHT NOW.

HE IS SURROUNDED.
