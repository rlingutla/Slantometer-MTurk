HIS NAME IS ON THE WATER
TOWER.

ONLY ONE OF THOSE AMERICANS
WAS EVEN THE TARGET OF THAT
STRIKE.

SCOTT, TAKE US OUT THERE IF
YOU COULD.

IF YOU WERE JUST TO THE
LEFT OR RIGHT OF IT YOU
MIGHT HAVE SOME ROOF DAMAGE
AND THEN THE NEXT SERIES OF
HOUSES OVER, THERE MIGHT BE
DEBRIS FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR'S
HOME, WHAT USED TO BE YOUR
NEIGHBOR'S HOME ON TOP OF
YOUR HOUSE OR IN YOUR YARD.

MORE DEVASTATION MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

THAT'S THE NATURE OF THIS
STORM.

REMARKABLY, SHEP, ALL OF
THE INJURIES FROM THIS WERE
MINOR.

THE WHOLE HEART INSTITUTE
COLLAPSED LIKE IT WAS A PAN
PANCAKE.

BACK HERE IN OKLAHOMA WE
ARE GETTING NEW ACCESS TO
ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING
NEIGHBORHOODS.

MUCH MORE TO COME FROM
OKLAHOMA.

THIS WAS THE OKLAHOMA HEART
INSTITUTE.

YOU HAVE SOME HOMES THAT
JUST MAY HAVE SOME SHINGLES
MISSING FROM THEM AND RIGHT
NEXT DOOR YOU HAVE TOTAL
DESTRUCTION.

THAT'S WHY IN THIS AREA
THE WIDTH OF THE STORM THE
WIDTH OF THE TORNADO WAS
ABOUT TWO MILES.

HE SAYS FIRST THE COMMUNITY
NEEDS SOME TIME TO HEAL.

PEOPLE STANDING ON PILES OF
RUBBLE.

I THINK THEY WOULD SAY
YOU ARE THE BRAVEST TEACHER
IN THE WORLD.

WE ARE GOING TO NOW CUT TO
LIVE CAMERAS ON THE VERY
TRUCK THAT I'M RIDING IN.

IMPRESSIVE.

IT'S MUCH THINNER THAN THAT
IN SOME AREAS IT'S JUST A
FEW HUNDRED YARDS WIDE.

YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN THERE.
