THOSE ATTACKS ON FINDS OF THE
SECRET SERVICE WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA WAS SWORN IN FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 2009.

HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE SITE OF
THE INITIAL AND THEN THE
SECONDARY BOMB.

I WAS CARRYING SOMEBODY WHO
LOST BOTH OF THEIR LEGS IN THE
EXPLOSION.

IT IS CHAOTIC HERE DURING THE
MARATHON IN A GOOD WAY.

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT AND STATES AND CITIES
PREPARE FOR IN THE EVENT OF AN
ATTACK.

BUT I CAN TELL YOU IN TALKING TO
OFFICIALS AROUND HERE, BRIAN,
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF
FRUSTRATION OF HOW LITTLE THEY
DO KNOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME
WHICH IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS
CLEARLY BEING VERY CAREFUL WITH
THE LANGUAGE HE CHOSE TO USE.

HEARTBREAK HILL TODAY THE SITE
OF JUST HEARTBREAK.

YOU HAD MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS
AND A LOT OF BOSTON P.D.

WE DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WILL
BE ALLOWED BACK IN.

PEOPLE'S FACES INSTANTLY CHANGED
FROM SMILES TO TEARS AND FEAR
AND WERE BASICALLY RUNNING FOR
THEIR LIVES.

THERE WERE PEOPLE RUNNING OVER
TOWARDS THEM TO HELP THE
INJURED.

AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE, A VERY
HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE HERE.

AT LEAST FIVE OTHER PACKAGES
HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THE STREET,
HAVE BEEN DEEMED SUSPICIOUS AND
ARE BEING DESTROYED.

THE NATIONAL GUARD IS HERE AND
PEOPLE ARE ON ALERT.

AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE ARE 15
BLOCKS THAT ARE VIRTUALLY
FROZEN.

FOR THE MOST PART IT'S QUIET FOR
THIS AREA.

WE ARE BACK TONIGHT THIS DAY
OF THE TWIN BOMBINGS AT THE END
OF THE BOSTON MARATHON.
