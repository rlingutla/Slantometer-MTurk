BY ANY STANDARD IT IS
INEXCUSABLE AND DESPITE THE
EXCUSES AND EQUIVOCATIONS THAT
SOME HAVE MANUFACTURED, IT IS
UNDENIABLE.

BUT A COALITION OF ARAB AND
EUROPEAN STATES ALONG WITH THE
U.S. COULD BE USED TO JUSTIFY A
STRIKE.

ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT --
PLAN OF ATTACK?

HE TOLD US HE CAME TO HIDE FROM
THE POISON GAS.

TONIGHT THE WHITE HOUSE IS
GATHERING INTERNATIONAL BACKING
FOR POSSIBLE AIR STRIKES AGAINST
SYRIA WHILE U.N.
CHEMICAL WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE
FINALLY BEEN ALLOWED IN TO
GROUND ZERO OF LAST WEEK'S
ATTACK.

[ GUNFIRE ]
HE TELLS US "WE WERE NOT ALLOWED
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE BECAUSE
SNIPERS WOULD START SHOOTING AT
US.

WITH THOSE INSPECTORS ON THE
GROUND THEY SAY A MILITARY
OPTION WAS NOT AUTOMATIC.

TONIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO
FINAL DECISION HAS BEEN MADE
ABOUT ANY U.S. MILITARY ACTION.

IF RUSSIA HAD CHANGED ITS POLICY
OR SYRIA ACKNOWLEDGED WHAT IT
HAD DONE, THEY MIGHT NOT NEED TO
PUNISH THE REGIME.

NEARLY ONE MILLION OF THOSE
REFUGEES ARE CHILDREN, MOST
UNDER THE AGE OF 11.

TODAY, SAFE IN THE CAMP, JALAL
GETS A CHANCE TO BE A KID AGAIN.

THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO ORGANIZE
THE ALLIES, NOTIFY CONGRESS AND
LIKELY NOT ATTACK WHILE THOSE
U.N.

CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES FROM FOUR
U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS AND TWO
SUBMARINES ALREADY IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN.

TELLING ME, LESTER, THEY'RE
GOING TO PROVIDE INTELLIGENCE TO
BACK UP THEIR CONCLUSION IN
COMING DAYS PERHAPS AS EARLY AS
TOMORROW.

AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO
GO.

WANTS TO HELP.

AND NOT CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCK
PILES.

ANYONE WHO COULD CLAIM THAT AN
ATTACK OF THIS STAGGERING SCALE
COULD BE CONTRIVED OR FABRICATED
NEEDS TO CHECK THEIR CONSCIENCE
AND THEIR OWN MORAL COMPASS.

BUT THIS MAY ALREADY BE A SIDE
SHOW.

THEY HOPE THE ARAB LEAGUE WILL
ENDORSE A LIMITED ATTACK NOT
AIMED AT TOPPLING ASSAD BUT
MAKING IT CLEAR THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON THIS SCALE
IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE.
