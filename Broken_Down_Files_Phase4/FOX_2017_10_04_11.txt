HIS DEATH IS A TRAGIC LOSS FOR
THIS POLICE FORCE, FOR THIS CITY
AND FOR OUR GREAT NATION.

HE SAID I'M GOING TO BE HERE
WEDNESDAY AND HERE HE IS.

MEDICAL -- SOME PEOPLE GETTING
OUT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BEDS TO
MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS THAT WERE
MORE GRAVELY WOUNDED.

GET BACK.

PEOPLE PLUGGING WOUNDS, STOPPING
BLOOD FROM FLOWING OUT OF
PEOPLE'S BODIES.

IT'S AT THE MANDALAY BAY.

WE'RE WAITING FOR HIM TO WALK IN
THE ROOM.

WE ASK GOD TO EASE THEIR
SUFFERING.

NEWT GINGRICH WAS ON THE AIR,
MAYBE YOU LUMP THEM IN WITH THE
1934 LAW THAT BANS AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS BY CIVILIANS.

DIFFERENT POLICE DEPARTMENTS
WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE INJURED.

WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH
THAT.

THEY HAVE MADE A REAL EFFORT,
JOHN, TO PUT THESE HEROS OF THIS
TRAGEDY FRONT AND CENTER AND
THESE MEET AND GREETS.

THIS IS THE THIRD SET WE'VE SEEN
ON CAMERA.

THEY DID A GOOD JOB.

HAVE THEY FOUND OUT ANYTHING
ELSE?

TOM COLE ON ANOTHER NETWORK
SAID, THIS.

AGAIN, SHEP, THE PRESIDENT
SAYING LET'S MOURN THE DEAD,
TEND TO THE BOUNDED AND THEN
LET'S HAVE THE POLITICAL
MANDALAY BAY.

THE PRESIDENT JUST WRAPPED UP A
MEETING WITH SOME VICTIMS.

THE PRESIDENT ABOUT TO COME INTO
THIS ROOM WE'RE TOLD TO MEET
WITH ANOTHER SET OF FIRST
RESPONDERS.

TRACE, THANKS VERY MUCH.
