THE FBI SAYS THEY WANT EVERYBODY
TO HELP FIND THESE TWO MEN ON
THE SURVEILLANCE TAPE. PERSONS OF INTEREST IN THE
BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING. WE'LL TAKE YOU FRAME BY FRAME
THROUGH THE VIDEO. WHY THE FBI SAYS, LOOK AT EVERY

SOME 300 PIECES OF EVIDENCE
RECOVERED FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

SO OFTEN, TELL US THE KIND OF
DETAIL THE FBI IS ASKING
EVERYONE TO NOTICE.

RECOVERED THE MOST MATERIAL
FROM.
