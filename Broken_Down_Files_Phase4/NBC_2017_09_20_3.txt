AND THIS IS PART OF
THE REASON WHY.

IT'S TOO MUCH.

THE DANGER FROM
HURRICANE MARIA IS NOT
OVER YET.

BIG MAHOGANY TREES
THAT WERE ROOTED UP.

EVERYBODY HAS FELT
THE PAIN AND THE
ANXIETY OF NOT
SPEAKING TO LOVED
PATH OF DESTRUCTION IS
RELENTLESS,
DEVASTATING THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
OVERNIGHT.

RESIDENTS FORCED TO
WADE THROUGH
WAIST-HIGH WATER TO
SAFETY.

SO I'M TRYING TO GO TO
MY MOM'S HOUSE.

NEIGHBORHOODS
DEMOLISHED, STREETS
UNDER WATER.

THIS STORM EVEN
CRACKING CONCRETE IN
HALF.

AFTER THE STORM.

THE URGENT SEARCH FOR
VICTIMS TRAPPED IN
THAT COLLAPSED SCHOOL.

ESTIMATES SHOW THE
DAMAGE ACROSS PUERTO
RICO COULD TOTAL $30
BILLION.

SEARCH AND RESCUE
OPERATIONS FROM
MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN
PUERTO RICO AND THE
U.S. MAINLAND NOW
UNDER WAY.

WHICH ONE'S GOING TO
BE WORSE, THE STORM OR
WHAT COMES AFTER THE
STORM?

NEW VIDEO OUT OF ST.
CROIX TODAY SHOWS THE
EXTENT OF THE
DESTRUCTION THERE.

36 HOURS AFTER
HURRICANE MARIA
STORMED ASHORE IN
PUERTO RICO RIPPING
APART HOMES AND
FLOODING STREETS, IT'S
POSSIBLE WE HAVE NOT
YET SEEN THE WORST OF
IT.

THE EMOTIONAL TOLL
CAN'T BE MEASURED.

TODAY WE RODE ALONG
WITH THE NATIONAL
GUARD AND GOVERNOR
RICARDO ROSSELLO WHO
HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO
COMMUNICATE NOT JUST
WITH MAYORS IN SOME
PARTS OF THE ISLAND
BUT EVEN HIS OWN
PARENTS OUTSIDE SAN
JUAN.

DARK DAYS IN PUERTO
RICO EXPECTED TO LAST
MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE
MARIA RIPPED APART THE
ISLAND'S ENTIRE POWER
GRID.

THE MONSTER STORM
REGAINED STRENGTH
AFTER IT STRUCK PUERTO
RICO.
