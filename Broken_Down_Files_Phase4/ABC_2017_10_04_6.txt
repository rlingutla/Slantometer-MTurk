PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR THROUGH
THE AIRPORT.

IT IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S HAD TO
VISIT THE SCENE OF A MASS
SHOOTING, MEETING WITH
SURVIVORS.

DOES AMERICA HAVE A GUN
VIOLENCE PROBLEM?

AND IT WAS LAST NIGHT HERE, WE
WALKED INTO THAT ROOM AT DESERT
SPRINGS HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER
HERE IN LAS VEGAS, WHERE SHELDON
MACK IS RECOVERING.

THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
MOMENT THAT PLAYED OUT HERE
TODAY, AFTER AN INTERVIEW WE
BROUGHT YOU LAST NIGHT HERE.

NORTH OF THE MANDALAY BAY.

BUT I SPOKE TO A CASINO WORKER
WHO SAID THEY SAW HIM PLAY HIGH
STAKES VIDEO POKER FOR EIGHT
CONTINUOUS HOURS THE MORNING OF
THE ATTACK.

NOW, LAW ENFORCEMENT HASN'T
WEIGHED IN ON THIS YET.

AND BULLETS FLYING, OFFICERS
HUDDLED BEHIND A WALL, TRYING TO
PINPOINT THE SOURCE OF THE
MAYHEM.

HOURS AFTER SHE ARRIVED ON A
HTIGFLM RO FPHTH
SHOOTER'S LONG-TIME GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, TOLD THE FBI,
ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS, THAT SHE HAD NO
KNOWLEDGE OF HIS PLANS OR HIS
PURCHASE OF SO MANY GUNS.

HE TOLD US HE WANTED TO MEET
THAT HERO, AND SOMEONE HEARD
THAT LAST NIGHT.

BODY CAMERAS REVEAL OFFICERS
RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES AMID
UNCEASING GUNFIRE.

WHEN WE COME BACK TONIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO HEAR IT.

CONCERT-GOERS DRIVING HER TO THE
HOSPITAL, KEEPING PRESSURE ON
HER WOUNDS.

AND MATT, WE NOW KNOW, HE MAY
HAVE HAD SEVERAL HOTEL OPTIONS
FOR THIS ATTACK, ULTIMATELY
SPENDING MORE THAN THREE DAYS IN
THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL RIGHT
BEHIND ME.

HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THE
ROOM WHEN THE SUSPECT FIRED
THROUGH THE DOOR AT THE SECURITY
GUARD AND STRUCK HIM.

THE SONG THAT MOVED EVERYONE
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

ALL WITH A VIEW OF THE CONCERT.

AMERICANS DEFIED DEATH AND
HATRED WITH LOVE AND WITH
COURAGE.
