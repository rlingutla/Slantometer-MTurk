WE'RE READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

HE'S SOMEONE WHO NEVER
EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER FROM HIS
FATHER.

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TARGET
HIM PERSONALLY.

ARE THEY GOING TO TARGET HIM?

AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS
ALSO JOINING THE DEBATE ABOUT
WHAT KIND OF ACTION AND EXACTLY
WHEN.

THIS IS A LIMITED STRIKE.

COULD HE MAKE A DIRECT HIT ON
THE UNITED STATES?

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY
CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

WHY WOULDN'T THEY TARGET HIM?

YOU'RE READY TO GO LIKE THAT?

THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.

THAT'S GOT TO MAKE HIS NERVOUS.

MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS ME FROM
JERUSALEM TONIGHT.

TONIGHT TAKING AIM, AMERICA
WEIGHS MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
SYRIA AND TONIGHT WE TAKE YOU
INSIDE THE MIND OF THE LEADER
ACCUSED OF UNLEASHING CHEMICAL
WAR.

IT'S ONLY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.

TODAY IN ISRAEL A RUN ON GAS
MASKS, REQUESTS INCREASING FOUR
FOLD.

IN RESPONSE?

THE CENTER OF THIS HORROR.

I REMEMBER MEETING HIM AND
INTERVIEWING HIM.

NUCLEAR ARMED ISRAEL HAS THE
MOST ADVANCED BALLISTIC
MISSILES, CRUISE MISSILES AND
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS MAKING
EXPERTS BELIEVE ASSAD WOULD BE
CRAZY TO TRY TO HIT ISRAEL.
