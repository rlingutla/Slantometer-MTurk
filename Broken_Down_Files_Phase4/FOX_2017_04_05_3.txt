IT HASN'T WORKED.

DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED
STATES WILL BECOME FOR ENGAGED
IN THE CONFLICT?

IT'S WITHOUT QUESTION THAT THE
SYRIAN REGIMES TO USE BARREL
BOMBS TO KILL BABIES IN THEIR
BEDS BY THE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS IN WHAT IS
UNQUESTIONABLY A SERIES OF WAR
CRIMES.

I HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY, AND
IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE -- AND
I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
HAPPENED -- THAT MY ATTITUDE
TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS
CHANGED VERY MUCH.

HE ALSO TWEETED --
SAYS HE'S CHANGED HIS MIND.

I WATCHED ATTACK ADMINISTRATIONS
SAYING WE WILL ATTACK SUCH AND
SUCH A DAY AND SUCH AND SUCH AN
HOUR.

THE DICTATOR DID USE THEM
ANYWAY.

WHEN HE DIDN'T CROSS THAT RED
LINE AFTER MAKING THE THREAT,
THAT SET US BACK A LONG WAYS NOT
ONLY IN SYRIA BUT IN MANY OTHER
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

I AGREE WITH THAT 100%.

THE RUSSIANS ARE FIGHTING WITH
THEM AS ARE IRANIANS.

YOU MAY REMEMBER PRESIDENT OBAMA
IN 2012 WARNED THAT BARBER
AL-ASSAD CROSSED A RED LINE
SHOULD HE USE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED,
HE'S BEEN VERY RELUCTANT TO FIRE
THE U.S.

PRIORITY TO
GET RID OF ASSAD IN SYRIA, THAT
WOULD BE A MAJOR SHIFT.

ONE TO KNOW IF THIS IS A SIGNAL
OF A MILITARY RESPOND THE U.S.

THE SYRIAN REGIME IS BACKED BY
THE RUSSIANS.

PRESIDENT OBAMA RESPONDED WITH
DIPLOMACY AND STEAD OF MILITARY
ACTION.

WHEN YOU HAVE A REGIME CHANGE,
YOU WIND UP IN A WORSE SPOT THAN
YOU DID BEFORE EXACTING A CHANGE
AT THE TOP.

THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID IN THE
PAST, AS A CANDIDATE AND AS
PRESIDENT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH
REGIME CHANGE.

REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO SEE
IS THERE GOING TO BE A
DIFFERENCE FROM THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION IN WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENS ON THE GROUND.

THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO
THINK THIS THROUGH THAT ALLOW
YOU TO BE TOUGH ON ASSAD AND
KNOW IT'S TOUGH TO OVERTHROW
HIM.
