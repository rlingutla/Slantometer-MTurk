WE HAVE TWO REPORTS
STARTING WITH THE
SYRIAN CRISIS AND
NBC'S RICHARD ENGEL.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
HORRIFIED BY THE
DEADLY GAS ATTACK ON
CIVILIANS SAYING IT
CROSSES MANY LINES AND
OFFERING THE VAILED
WARNING THERE MAY BE A
NEW U.S.APPROACH TO
SYRIA.

THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS
BY THE ASSAD REGIME
CANNOT BE TOLERATED.

BIG REVERSAL.

DOCTORS SAY IT'S
CONSISTENT WITH
EXPOSURE TO A NERVE
AGENT LIKE SARIN GAS.

A CHEMICAL ATTACK
THAT WAS SO HORRIFIC
IN SYRIA AGAINST
INNOCENT PEOPLE
INCLUDING WOMEN, SMALL
CHILDREN, AND EVEN
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE
BABIES, THEIR DEATHS
WAS AN AFFRONT TO
HUMANITY.

HE'S BEEN CALLED AN
ISOLATIONIST, HE
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE ONE
TODAY.

AT THE U.N. SECURITY
COUNSEL AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY MADE AN
EMOTIONAL ADDRESS.

JUST TWO DAYS AGO
THE ADMINISTRATION
SEEMED WILLING TO
ACCOMMODATE ASSAD.

MY ATTITUDE TOWARD
SYRIA AND ASSAD
CHANGED VERY MUCH.

AFTER AN ALLEGED
CHEMICAL ATTACK BY
ASSAD'S REGIME, THE
VICTIMS ARE STILL
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.

WHICH OFFERED TODAY A
VERY DIFFERENT
EXPLANATION FOR THE
VICTIMS, SAYING
ASSAD'S TROOPS BOMBED
A TERRORIST'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS DEPOT.

BUT VIDEO OBTAINED BY
NBC NEWS OF WHAT
WITNESSES SAY IS THE
IMPACT SITE SHOWS A
CRATER IN AN OPEN
ROAD, NO DEPOT NEARBY.

I NOW HAVE
RESPONSIBILITY AND I
WILL HAVE THAT
RESPONSIBILITY AND
CARRY IT VERY PROUDLY.

THE FIRST, SYRIA'S
LEADER ASSAD.

LOOK AT THOSE
PICTURES.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M
DOING ANYTHING ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

ARE RISKS LIKE SYRIAN
AIR DEFENSES AND
POSSIBLE RUSSIAN
RESISTANCE.

AFTER BLAMING FORMER
PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR
NOT TAKING ACTION
AFTER DRAWING A RED
LINE ON CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, TODAY THAT
CHANGED TOO.

HE LEFT OPEN THAT
POSSIBILITY.
