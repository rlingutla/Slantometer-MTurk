LAS VEGAS MASS
SHOOTING.

GET DOWN.

TONIGHT A BAFFLING
MYSTERY.

NOW TO THOSE WHO
DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT.

ONLY THOSE WHO LIVED
THROUGH IT CAN SPEAK
TO THE HARD CHOICE OF
SURVIVAL IN A PLACE
WHERE IT APPEARED
THERE WERE NO GOOD
CHOICES.

50 YEARS AGO 16 DEAD
IN TEXAS.

INSIDE THE ARSENAL HE
USED TO CARRY OUT HIS
RAMPAGE.

SHE IS NOT A SUSPECT.

WHAT UNFOLDED JUST
A FEW STEPS FROM HERE
LAST NIGHT IS ALMOST
TOO MUCH TO BEAR.

THAT'S WHY IT'S SO
DEADLY.

THE QUESTION IS HOW
MAY THE SHOOTER HAVE
GOTTEN HIS HANDS ON
WHAT WERE ESSENTIALLY
MILITARY GRADE MACHINE
GUNS?

MANY WONDERING IF THE
SOUNDS WERE PART OF
THE SHOW.

IT WAS NOT BY HIMSELF.

MOMENT BACKSTAGE MORE
CRITICAL DECISIONS.

OUR COLLECTIVE
SENSE OF SECURITY WAS
SHATTERED AGAIN TODAY
MASS SHOOTING IN
AMERICA.

RIGHT NOW, WE NEED
YOUR TRUCK.

HOW DID HE GET AHOLD
OF THEM?

HITTING YOUR FACE,
THE DIRT IS.

YES, THE WHOLE
TIME.

WE GOT SHIRTS OFF AND
COME PRESSED IT.
