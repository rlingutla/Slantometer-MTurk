TODAY A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL SAID THE U.S. MUST BE,
QUOTE, HUMBLE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN
AND CANNOT DO.

U.S. BOOTS ON THE GROUND.

FOR WAR-WEARY AMERICANS, THAT'S
NOT EVEN UNDER CONSIDERATION.

WE TURN OVERSEAS NOW TO
SYRIA AND SOME HORRIFYING IMAGES
THAT WILL INSTINCTIVELY MAKE YOU
WANT TO LOOK AWAY.

BUT WASHINGTON WORRIES, WHO
WOULD GET THE WEAPONS?

IT HAS INSPECTORS IN DAMASCUS
RIGHT NOW, JUST A FEW MILES FROM
WHERE SO MANY DIED YESTERDAY,
BUT THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WON'T
LET THEM SEE WHAT COULD BE THE
WORST ATROCITY IN SYRIA'S
ATROCIOUS WAR.

YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHAT THE
REBELS SAY IS THE EVIDENCE.

A VICIOUS CIVIL WAR NOW IN ITS
THIRD YEAR, MORE THAN 100,000
DEAD, NEARLY 2 MILLION REFUGEES.

IN SYRIA OUTRAGES HAVE LONG GONE
UNPUNISHED.

ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT --
OUT OF CONTROL AND RUNNING OUT
OF CASH TO FIGHT THE WORST FIRE
 EYES OF THE WORLD ON THE
ATROCI IN SYRIA.

THE REBELS ARE DIVIDED WITH SOME
LINKED TO AL QAEDA.

AND WITH ASSAD BACKED BY RUSSIA,
IRAN, AND HEZBOLLAH, THERE IS
LITTLE THE WORLD CAN DO.

YET THEY CANNOT BE IGNORED.

MORE VIDEOS EMERGE FROM SYRIA
TODAY.

SOME OF IT IS VERY GRAPHIC.

VIDEO EVIDENCE OF WHAT MAY HAVE
HAPPENED NOW INSIDE SYRIA.

A MASS CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

ARMING THE REBELS.

HAS SHOCKED THE WORLD.

FROM THE SYRIAN REGIME DENIALS,
AS THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE WHICH
FOR A YEAR HAS CALLED THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA A RED
LINE, IS BEING CAUTIOUS AS IT
NOW CALLS FOR AN INVESTIGATION.
