THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE HANG
OUT WITH, SAYING AND I'M
QUOTING HERE IT GIVES
GOVERNMENT COMPREHENSIVE
ASSOCIATION.

AFTER ONE BRIEFING A SENSE
THERE IS MORE TO THE
PROGRAMS AND THE WAY THEY
ARE POLICED.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT
REVELATIONS THAT HAVE NOT
YET BEEN HEARD OVER THE
NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS, A
MONTH, HOW FAST WE GET THE
NEXT ONE OUT IS SOMETHING
WE ARE DECIDING NOW.

THE AMERICAN CIVIL
LIBERTIES UNION REPORTS IT
HAS NOW FILED A
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE
ARGUING THE PROGRAM
VIOLATES BOTH FREEDOM OF
SPEECH AND PRIVACY RIGHTS.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS YET
TO COMMENT, SHEP, ON EITHER
ONE OF THESE LAWSUITS.

JUST NOW KEITH ALEXANDER IS
NOW SCHEDULED TO EXPLAIN
HIMSELF TO THE HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ON
THURSDAY.
