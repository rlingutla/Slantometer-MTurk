PRETTY QUICKLY.

THE LATEST ON WHO IS BEHIND
THIS, AND THE NATURE OF THESE
BOMBS, LET'S GO TO ABC'S SENIOR
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT WHO HAS
BEEN WORKING THIS STORY ALL DAY,
PIERRE THOMAS.

IN L.A., THEY'RE DISPATCHING
BOMB SQUADS AND BOMB SNIFFING
DOGS.

I HAVE TO SAY THAT, EVERYONE WAS
VERY CALM AND WE JUST MOVED OUT
OF THE WAY AND LET THE
PROFESSIONALS WORK.

THE INJURIES WE WERE SEEING WAS
MOSTLY TO PEOPLE'S LEGS.

SIMILAR TO TODAY'S BOSTON BLAST,
THE ATLANTA OLYMPICS BLAST IN
1996.

BASICALLY THE EXPLOSION
OCCURRED TO MY LEFT.

WHAT CAN I DO TO KEEP MYSELF
SAFE?

THIS IS LIKE THE SCARIEST THING
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED.

WELL, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, WE
PUT TOURNIQUETS ON PEOPLE QUICK
AS WE CAN.

YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THE RISKS
UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIFIC
INFORMATION ABOUT A PARTICULAR
ACTOR, YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE
SAFETY ANYWHERE.

PEOPLE WORK IN THE RESTAURANTS
TELLING US TO GET AWAY FROM THE
SCENE, GET FAR AWAY.

WE SAW PEOPLE BEING WHEELED OUT
ON WHEEL CHAIRS AND STRETCHERS
WHO HAD LOST THEIR LIMBS.

I RAN IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
FAST AS I COULD.

POLICE TAPE PUT ON THE SCENE AS
A PRECAUTION.

ANY RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS, ANY
RESPONSIBLE GROUPS WILL FEEL THE
FULL WEIGHT OF JUSTICE.

RUN!

PEOPLE STARTED TO SAY, MAYBE A
TRANSFORMER BLEW.

I'M FROM LOS ANGELES, SO IT FELT
LIKE OF LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE.

OF NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS,
SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO PLACE TWO
BOMBS, GIVING SO MANY SECOND
THOUGHTS ABOUT BEING AROUND
LARGE CROWDS.
