EXPERTS COUNSELING CHILDREN HERE
SAY THE SURVIVING STUDENTS ARE
VICTIMS, TOO, LIKELY TRAUMATIZED
BY WHAT THEY SAW MONDAY, WHO
THEY DIDN'T SEE TODAY.

WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WE
JUST GOT TO SAY HI TO EACH OTHER
AGAIN.

UP NEXT, A INCREDIBLE
SURVIVAL STORY WE HAVEN'T HEARD

THOSE WOMEN WERE, THEY WERE
GODSENDS.

PARENTS JUST NEED TO SPEAK
HONESTLY WITH THEIR CHILDREN BUT

THEY'RE SAFE.
