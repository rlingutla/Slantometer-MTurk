THE CAMPUS FROM UNLV IS A FEW
MILES FROM THE SHOOTING.

IT'S PHENOMENAL.

IF HE BLEW ALL OF HIS MONEY
GAMBLING THEY WOULD KNOW THAT BY
NOW, WOULDN'T THEY?

THE LAWYER READ A STATEMENT TO A
CROWD OUTSIDE FBI HEAD QUARTERS
IN L.A. AFTER AGENTS QUESTIONED
HER FOR HOURS.

THE AREAS ARE CARVED OUT BETWEEN
THE RUNWAYS AND THE TAXIWAYS.

WHEN HE SAID ON THE RUNWAY OF
ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW.

HE KILLED 58 PEOPLE AND INJURED
HUNDREDS MORE AT THE COUNTRY
MUSIC FESTIVAL ACROSS THE
STREET.

HAVE TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK
AT IT.

THE SHERIFF LAST NIGHT IN THIS
ASTOUNDING NEWS CONFERENCE MADE
MENTION OF A POTENTIAL
ACCOMPLICE.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY'RE STILL
STRUGGLING WHY HE DID THIS.

SOME CONSERVATIVES AND
REPUBLICANS HAVE COME OUT IN
FAVOR OF TAKING A LOOK AT BUMP
STOCKS.

SHEP, THERE WAS A GROUP OF
FIREFIGHTERS THAT WAS HANDLING A
CAR NEAR MANDALAY BAY BEFORE
THIS STARTED.

HER LAWYER SPEAKING NOW AFTER
HOURS OF FBI QUESTIONING.

THEY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE
FIRST WIFE, THE SECOND WIFE,
PEOPLE HE WORKED WITH.

WERE THEY BULLETS THAT WERE
BEING RANDOMLY FIRED?

POSSIBLE.

HE GAMBLED A LOT.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WE HAD A LOT
ON OUR HANDS.
