TO SIXTH GRADER BRADY WHO WAS
INSIDE BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL WHEN THE STORM HIT.

AND I WAS AT WORK, SO I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

AND HOURS AGO FATHER AND SON
WERE REUNITED, HERE'S THEIR
STORY IN THEIR OWN WORDS.

55 MILLION AMERICANS STILL IN
THE STORM ZONE TONIGHT.

AND WE WALKED OUT, AND WE WERE
ALL ALIVE.

AND TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FROM
ONE WOMAN WHO'S A RESIDENT OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

IT JUST TORE THROUGH IT LIKE
A TRUCK RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE
CENTER OF IT.

I FELT THEM AND IT WAS
RAINING ON ME AND ALL THAT.

I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR EVERYBODY
THAT THEIR HOUSES ARE GONE.

MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST ARRIVING BY
PRIVATE VEHICLE AS WELL.

GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT
YOU'RE HEARING AROUND TOWN.

ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON, BECAUSE
THIS IS STILL A VERY LARGE AREA.

AND 30 MINUTES AGO YOU DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE HE WAS?

THIS IS IN THE DAY.

I JUST RUSHED HOME, WE JUST GOT
REUNITED, BUT HE'S OKAY.

FOR ONE FAMILY, SUCH GREAT
NEWS TONIGHT.

HOUSES EVERYWHERE JUST
FLATTENED.

SOMETHING THAT I GOT TO TELL
YOU, I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

THERE WERE PEOPLE CRAWLING OUT
FROM EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE.

THE GOOD NEWS NOW IS THAT
STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL AND
ADULTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
SCHOOL, TELL US THAT NO CHILDREN
DIED.
