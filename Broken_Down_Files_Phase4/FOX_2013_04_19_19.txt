AND OUR HEATHER AGAIN FROM
THE SOURCE SAYING THAT,
INDEED, SHOTS WERE FIRED
AND THE SUSPECT IS DOWN.

I HEARD THE GUNSHOTS.

THE FBI REPORTED BACK TO
THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT THAT
IT FOUND NOTHING BUT TOLD
THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TO
FOLLOW UP IF THEY HAD ANY
MORE CONCERNS.

AND THIS ALL HAPPENING IN
THE BACKYARD AT 67 FRANKLIN
STREET WHERE WE BELIEVE
SUSPECT 2 IS HOLD UP IN
THIS BOAT THAT YOU SEE ON
THE RIGHT PICTURE HERE IN
THE ARROW WITH THE TARP ON
IT THAT HE HID IN THERE.

DOES HE STILL HAVE A
WEAPON?

WE HAVE CORRESPONDENTS AND
CREWS ON SCENE FOX 25 LIVE

BOB, IS THERE A
HELICOPTER OVERHEAD AT THIS
POINT?

SWAT TEAM PULLED BACK.

SOURCES ARE TELLING ME
THAT THE SUSPECT NUMBER 2
IS NOT APPREHENDED BUT HE
IS SURROUNDED.

WE BELIEVE IT TO BE 67
FRANKLIN STREET IN
WATERTOWN.

BUT IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO
GO THERE WE HEARD FROM
AUTHORITIES EARLIER TODAY
THEY CAN'T BE SURE THAT
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE
INVOLVED BESIDES THESE TWO
SUSPECTS.

AND IT'S A STREET THAT --
THE CIRCLE OF STREETS THAT
I TAKE MY DOG WITH AND WE
WERE JUST READY TO COME TO
THE END OF RUSSELL AND
CROSS OVER AND WE JUST
HEARD LIKE THIS POP, POP
POPPING KIND OF LIKE
FIREWORK POPCORN FIRE.

HERE AGAIN WE SEE MORE
PEOPLE RUNNING DOWN THE
STREET.

AND WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON
IT.

HE IS IN THERE.

WELL, I HEARD THE
GUNSHOT.

HE IS INDEED IN THE BOAT.

AND WE BELIEVE THEY ARE AT
67 FRANKLIN STREET.

A 20 BLOCK AREA WHERE
SWATTED TEAMS AND ARMORED
PERSONNEL -- ARMORED --
BODY ARMORED PEOPLE,
AUTHORITIES FROM THE FBI
THE LOCAL POLICE, THE STATE
POLICE ALL WENT IN AND NOW
