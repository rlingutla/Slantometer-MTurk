I SAID I KNOW.

WE ARE LIVE AT THAT SCHOOL
NEXT.

SAYS SHE HAD BEEN BURIED
UNDER BRICKS AND OTHER
DEBRIS AT THAT SCHOOL.

FIRST OF ALL, THE STORY OF
A BRIAR ROAD ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL TEACHER AND THE
TERRIFYING ORDEAL THAT SHE
AND HER ENTIRE FAMILY WENT
THROUGH INSIDE THAT SCHOOL.

SECOND GRADE IS TRAPPED.

THEIR THOUGHTS ARE WITH
THOSE AT THE OTHER SCHOOL
HOMES WHERE ONE OF HER
STUDENTS DIDN'T MAKE IT.

JOHN ROBERTS IS LIVE IT THE
BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY.

THERE IS SOMETHING IN MY
LEG.

THEY PUT HER IN THE BACK OF
THE PICKUP TRUCK AND TOOK
HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

AND WHEN I LOOKED THERE WAS
A TABLE LEG THROUGH HER
RIGHT CALF.

NOW THEY SAY IT'S
REMARKABLE THAT EVERYBODY
AT BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY
SURVIVED.

WHEN THE LADY AT THE
FRONT WHEN I RAN THROUGH
SHE IS YELLING SECOND GRADE
IS TRAPPED.

THE KIDS WERE BACK
UNDERNEATH THIS AROUND THE
CORNER HUNKERED DOWN, SOME
OF THEM LAYING DOWN FLAT
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHO THESE PEOPLE WERE OR
WHAT HAD BECOME OF THEM BUT
NOW WE DO.
