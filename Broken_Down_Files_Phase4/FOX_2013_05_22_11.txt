YOU SEE NOTHING BUT DEBRIS.

JIM WAS IN THAT SAME
CHOPPER 14 YEARS AGO AND
FLYING THAT SAME PATH WHEN
THE LAST HUGE STORM HIT
HERE.

YOU TAKE THE CHILDREN UP
AGAINST THE INSIDE WALL.

THANK GOD SHE GOT TO KEEP
HER STUFF.

HOW SCIEWNTS GOT OUT ALIVE.

WHEN THE TORNADO WARNINGS
CAME, IN SEVERAL OF THE
PARENTS OF HER CHILDREN
RUSHED TO THAT SCHOOL, GOT
THEIR KIDS, TOOK THEM AWAY.

ONE THAT STRETCHES FOR MANY
MILES.

YOU WILL SEE SOME THE
DESTRUCTION ISN'T QUITE AS
SEVERE.

WHAT AN IMPRESSIVE BUNCH.

GOT A BIG SPREAD OUT THERE.

SO THE AREA OF DESTRUCTION
IS MASSIVE AND THE DENSITY
OF IT IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

BUT, BEHIND US, IT WASN'T
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

AND THE FAMILIES WHO ARE
LEFT WITH NOTHING.
