THEY WERE WALKING TO TRY TO
ASSESS THE DAMAGE.

THE STORM HAS SNAPPED PALM
TREES, PEELED OFF ROOFTOPS.

THE STORM HIT AND BLEW AWAY THE
MAYOR'S ROOF.

THEY DO HAVE DAMAGE TO THEIR
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH WOODEN
HOUSES.

OUR VIEWERS WATCHING ACROSS THE
48 AND AROUND THE WORLD THIS
AFTERNOON, WHAT CAN PEOPLE DO TO
HELP YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF
PUERTO RICO?

SO IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS AS
THE SYSTEM PASSED TO THE SOUTH
OF THE ISLANDS LAST NIGHT, THE
WINDS EXPANDED AND THEY
BASICALLY -- THEY HAD UP TO
ABOUT 137 MILES PER HOUR WINDS.

IT'S A GOOD TIME TO REMEMBER
THAT PUERTO RICANS ARE AMERICANS
JUST LIKE ALL OF US.

FORECASTERS SAY HURRICANE FORCE
WINDS EXTEND 60 MILES FROM THE
EYE OF MARIA.

OFFICIALS SAY THE EXTREMELY
DANGEROUS STORM KNOCKED OUT
POWER TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND.

WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE NOW?

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW DEALING
WITH ITS THIRD NATURAL DISASTER
IN LESS THAN A MONTH.

NOW ALL OF PUERTO RICO IS
WITHOUT POWER RIGHT NOW.

IN SOME CASES, THEY'RE DANGEROUS
BY YEARS OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE
AND MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE
UNDERFUNDED AND COULD BE
OVERWHELMED BY THE STORM.

I KNOW THIS NATION AND THE
GENEROUS PEOPLE OF AMERICA WILL
RESPOND AS THEY ALWAYS DO.

ACTUALLY, A LOT OF COMMUNICATION
TOWERS WENT DOWN AND ARE OFF
LINE.

THE POWER IS OFF.

THE RAIN HORIZONTAL AND ALL THE
TREES ON THE GROUND.

IT'S THE THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN
A MONTH THAT A HURRICANE
LANDFALL ON THE U.S.

GOING FORWARD, FLOODS AND
MUDSLIDES.
