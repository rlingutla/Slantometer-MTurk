WHAT A CHAR AL-ASSAD DID IS A
WAR CRIME.

HIS ADMINISTRATION HOSTING THE
MINISTER OF CHINA A SUCCESSFUL
VOTE ON HIS SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE AND OF COURSE THE
MISSILE STRIKE AGAINST SYRIA 

SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS HELPED

AS WAS ALLUDED TO THIS WEEK
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED MORE
PLANTS TO STRIKE THE ASSAD
REGIME.

IT IS AN ATROCITY.

ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH AND
THAT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
WILLING TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE.

WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THE
GLOBAL REACTION POURS IN?

U.S. OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO
WHETHER RUSSIA MAY HAVE
SUPPORTED US.

WHAT ELSE WOULD I GUESS WE LIKE
TO SEE AS FAR AS AIRSTRIKES INTO
SYRIA, WHAT MORE THEY TALKING
ABOUT?

A RUSSIAN DRONES SEEN OVER A
HOSPITAL WHERE VICTIMS OF
TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK WERE TAKEN AND FIVE HOURS
LATER RUSSIAN AND SYRIAN JETS
BOMBED IT IN AN EFFORT TO KILL
MORE PEOPLE AND DESTROY THE
EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK

RESPONSE
OF THE VERY FIRST PLACE.

IS DOING IT ON HIS OWN.

THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE JOHN
STRIKE WAS A GOOD START BUT MORE
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

THIS IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER.

THEIR PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON
PLANNING THIS SINCE 2003.

IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING TO
CONTINUE ON WITH HIS AMERICA
FIRST THEME INSTEAD OF COUNTRIES
LIKE SYRIA OR IS HE BECOMING A
BIT MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN
INTERVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT
HE WARNED AGAINST ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

IT ALSO SAYS IT'S A SETBACK FOR
RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. AND MAY
HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR
THE REGION.

PROTESTERS LINING THE STREETS OF
DAMASCUS CALLING THE ATTACK AND
AGGRESSION AGAINST THE ENTIRE
NATION BUT RUSSIA REMAINS THE
MOST CRITICAL.

AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST
CONTINUE TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQA
AND STOP THIS FLOW THAT IS
COMING OUT OF RAQQA AND BEING
SENT TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED
STATES TO PREVENT TERROR.

THAT'S RIGHT IN OFFICIALS
I'VE SPOKEN TODAY SAID NOT TO
EXPECT ANY MORE AIRSTRIKES ON
THE ASSAD REGIME ANYTIME SOON.
