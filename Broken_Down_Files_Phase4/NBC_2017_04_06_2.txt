VICTIMS ON THE GROUND
REACTING LIKE THEY HAD
BEEN EXPOSED TO A
NERVE AGENT.

AS LANGUAGE ABOUT
THE ASSAD REGIME
CANNOT LEAD AN
UNBIASSED
INVESTIGATION.

IS AMERICA ABOUT TO
WEIGH DEEPER INTO A
BLOODY CIVIL WAR AFTER
THAT HORRIFIC CHEMICAL
ATTACK.
GOOD EVENING FROM
LOS ANGELES, TO OUR
VIEWERS IN THE WEST,
AS WE COME ON THE AIR,
THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE
MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF
LAUNCHING A MAJOR
MILITARY STRIKE
AGAINST SYRIA.

IF HE ACTS DECISIVELY
AND RESPONSIBLY, HE
CAN SET THE MIDEAST.

AS FAR AS I CAN
TELL, CONGRESSMAN
NUNES KILLED THAT.

SECRETARY OF STATE
SUGGESTING THERE'S NO
ROLE FOR ASSAD TO
GOVERN THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE.

NOW JUST 11 WEEKS INTO
HIS ADMINISTRATION,
THIS CRISIS BRINGING
HIM TO THE BRINK OF A
DECISION THAT WILL
DEFINE HIS LEGACY.

IF HE DOES NOTHING,
IT'S GOING TO BE OBAMA
ON STEROIDS IN TERMS
OF HIS PERCEPTION.

CRYING OUT THE NAMES
OF HIS 2-YEAR-OLD
TWINS.

THE WORK HAS ALWAYS
CONTINUED BUT NOW I
THINK THE CLOUD THAT
HAD SETTLED OVER THE
COMMITTEE'S WORK HAS
BEEN LIFTED.

VICTIMS LIKE THE ONES
BURIED TODAY BY ABDEL
HAMEED EL-YOUSSEF.

TRIGGERING HIS
REVERSAL ON SYRIA.

HIS CHILDREN AND WIFE
AMONG THE MORE THAN
HUNDREDS OF SYRIANS
KILLED.

CONGRESSMAN MIKE KONYA
WAY OF TEXAS, TELLING
REPORTERS HERE AT THE
CAPITOL HE WILL FOLLOW
EVERY LEAD IN THIS
INVESTIGATION NO
MATTER HOW LONG IT
TAKES.

IT'S A SERIOUS
MATTER, IT REQUIRES A
SERIOUS RESPONSE.

HITTING A HOSPITAL,
THE FLASHES AND BOOMS
CLEARLY VISIBLE.
