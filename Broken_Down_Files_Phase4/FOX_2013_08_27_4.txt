EVEN THOUGH IN THE 2008
CAMPAIGN, HE SLAMMED THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR
ACTING UNILATERALLY, TAKE A
LISTEN TO HOW I PRESSED JAY
CARNEY ABOUT THIS AND
LISTEN TO THE VICE
PRESIDENT AS WELL.

YEAH, THE FOREIGN
MINISTER SPEAKING OUT TODAY
SAYING THAT ABSOLUTELY
WITHOUT QUESTION SYRIA WILL
DEFEND ITSELF IF ATTACKED.

IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH
THAT IT'S ABOUT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THEIR USE IS
WRONG.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO CARRY
OUT A SURGICAL STRIKE ON
CHEMICAL WEAPONS STORAGE
FACILITIES, ASSAD IS
ESTIMATED TO HAVE
1,000 TONS OF THOSE
MATERIALS.

BUT SOME DEMOCRATS ON
CAPITOL HILL LIKE
CONGRESSWOMAN BARBARA LEE,
THE ONLY MEMBER OF CONGRESS
TO VOTE AGAINST THE WAR IN
AFGHANISTAN DEMANDING A
DEBATE AND VOTE IN
CONGRESS.

INTERESTING BECAUSE VICE
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN TODAY
ADDED HIS NAME TO THE
COURSE OF TOP OFFICIALS
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
SAYING THAT ASSAD AND SYRIA
NEEDS TO BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.

WHENEVER PRESIDENT OBAMA
GIVES THE ORDER.

NOT BEFORE NATO MEETS
BRUSSELS TOMORROW AND WE'RE
TOLD IT WOULD OCCUR MOST
LIKELY THIS WEEKEND.

BUT FIRST TO JENNIFER
GRIFFIN LIVE AT THE
PENTAGON WITH US THIS
EVENING.

BUT THERE MUST BE A CLEAR
GOAL.

YOU CAN SEE THE BULLET
HOLES IN ONE OF THEIR
VEHICLES THERE.

WOULD THE THE
ADMINISTRATION GET
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY OR
IS THIS A DECISION THE
PRESIDENT WILL MAKE ON HIS
OWN.

WE'LL GO LIVE TO THE WHITE
HOUSE IN A MOMENT HERE
INSIDE OUR FOX REPORT
TONIGHT.

WE ARE READY TO GO LIKE
THAT.

A U.S. MILITARY IS READY TO
GO IF PRESIDENT OBAMA GIVES
THE ORDER FOR A STRIKE
AGAINST SYRIA.

FORMING AND IN PLACE.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT'S
PREPOSTEROUS TO SUGGEST
THAT SYRIA WAS NOT BEHIND
LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK.

FOUR NAVY DESTROYERS IN
POSITION AND AT LEAST ONE
NUCLEAR POWERED SUBMARINE.

BUT DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK
HAGEL STRESSING THE U.S.
WILL COORDINATE ANY ACTION
WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL
PARTNERS.

DESPITE DIFFICULTIES THAT
THEY HAVE FACED, INCLUDING
A SNIPER ATTACK ON THEIR
CONVOY.
