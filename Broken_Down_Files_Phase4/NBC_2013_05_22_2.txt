75% OF HOMES HAVE BEEN REBUILT,
AND 80% OF NEW HOMES NOW INCLUDE
A SAFE ROOM.

A VIEW WE HAVEN'T SEEN UNTIL NOW
OF THE OKLAHOMA NEIGHBORHOOD AND
SCHOOL THAT TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

THIS IS WHAT BEING OKLAHOMAN
IS ABOUT.

BACK IN JOPLIN, THE FOLKS ARE
TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE
LEARNED THESE PAST TWO YEARS.

A THIRD OF THE TOWN WAS
DESTROYED.

EMERGING IN JOPLIN, ONE THAT
LOOKS ALMOST NOTHING LIKE THIS
22-MILE PATH OF DESTRUCTION.

ALSO HOW SO MANY PEOPLE SURVIVED
BY HIDING AND RIDING IT OUT IN
SOME UNUSUAL PLACES.

JOPLIN IS A CITY OF HOPE.

ALL I HEARD WAS A -- AND IT
WAS QUIET.

CONCERN HERE, CLEANING UP AS
HEAVY EQUIPMENT CREWS MOVED IN
TODAY, SO DID AN ARMY OF
VOLUNTEERS, LOADED WITH RAKES,
SHOVELS, AND BIG HEARTS.

FOLLOWING THE RAREST OF ALL
TORNADOES, THE EF5, THE MOST
POWERFUL ON EARTH.

THAT'S A HUGE IMPACT IN A TOWN
OF ONLY 56,000.

THEN THE CHILDREN KILLED AT
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
LIKE BEST FRIENDS AN TONE I
CAN'T CANDELARIA AND EMILY
CONATZER.

WE ARE JUST BACK FROM MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, WHERE LIFE WON'T BE
NORMAL FOR YEARS, WHERE THE
EARTH HAS BEEN WIPED CLEAN IN
SOME PLACES, AND WHERE THE DEATH
TOLL STANDS STILL AT 24, 324
PEOPLE INJURED, TEN CHILDREN
INCLUDING TWO INFANTS ARE AMONG
THE DEAD.

WHEN WE COME BACK, A MESSAGE
OF HOPE FROM THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW
WHAT THE PEOPLE IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, ARE IN FOR.

HEARD AN INTERIOR ROOM WAS THE
FASTEST PLACE TO SHELTER IN A
PINCH.

THE FATHER OF JENAE HORNSBY
ANOTHER THIRD GRADER, SPOKE OF
THE SEARCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

IF YOU ASK MOST PEOPLE OUT
THERE, THEY ARE GOING TO REBUILD
AND PROBABLY GET A STORM
SHELTER.

AMONG THEM 65-YEAR-OLD HEMMET
BONDI.

THERE IS PLENTY OF INSPIRATION
TO BE FOUND HERE.
