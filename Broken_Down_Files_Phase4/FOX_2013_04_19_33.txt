THEY ARE SAYING THAT ONE
OF THE SUSPECTS IS LIKELY
ONE OF THE SUSPECTS HERE IN
THIS WHOLE THING IS DOWN.

WE TOOK A RIGHT.

PHONE SHE IS ON FRANKLIN
STREET ANDEPORT
OF SHOTS FIRED.

AND WE ARE LOOKING AT AN
AREA OF BIRCH AND WALNUT IN
WATER TOWN WHICH RUNS SORT
OF OFF OF ARSENAL STREET IN
WATERTOWN.

BEEN ON EDGE FOR A WHILE.

WE WERE TOLD WE COULDN'T
COME UP.

EVERY FRONT PORCH HAS AN
AREA UNDERNEATH IT AND
THERE IS A -- PLENTY OF
PLACES WHO HIDE THE WAY
CONSTRUCTION IS DONE IN
WATER TOWN BUT THEY
SEARCHED IT ALL AND
COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

AND AT SOME POINT, IN THE
NEAR TERM, WE EXPECT TO
HEAR FROM POLICE ABOUT WHAT
HAS JUST HAPPENED AND
WHETHER IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
BOSTON AND THE UNITED
STATES' NIGHTMARE IS AT
LEAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE
AT LEASE -- LEAST THIS
STAGE OF IT.

JOINING US MY STATIONS
ACROSS THE STATION.

THE FIRE FIGHT THAT ENSUED
AND THEN HIS SUBSEQUENT
FLEEING ON FOOT.

VERY ACTIVE SCENE.

AND, FRANKLY THEY
RESPECTED THAT REQUEST AND
DID SO.

IS THERE A HELICOPTER
OVERHEAD AT THIS POINT?

WE TALKED WITH WITH MARY
SULLIVAN AN EYEWITNESS WHO
SAID SHE WAS GETTING OUT
BECAUSE THE LOCKDOWN HAD
BEEN LIFTED AND SHE WENT
OUT AND WAS GOING TO TAKE
THING TO FOR A WALK AS THEY
OFTEN DO AND SUDDENLY HEARD
THE GUNFIRE AND KNEW THINGS
WERE NOT NORMAL.

WE HAVE, UNDERSTAND THAT
THE SUSPECT IS IN THE BOAT.

I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE
WALKING THIS WAY OR OTHER
WAY.

WE BELIEVE THERE ARE
SOMEWHERE AROUND HUNDREDS
OF OFFICERS ON SCENE AND
THAT THE SECOND SUSPECT IS
SURROUNDED.

RIGHT, ONE OF THOSE WAS
VERY LOUD.

20 MINUTES AGO REPORTS OF
SHOTS FIRED THEY CAME INTO
OUR NEWSROOM FROM NEIGHBORS
AND WE WENT FROM HAVING
VERY LITTLE GOING ON
OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWING THAT
PRESS CONFERENCE VERY
MELLOW IN THE STREETS OF
WATERTOWN.

OR THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY
DID.
