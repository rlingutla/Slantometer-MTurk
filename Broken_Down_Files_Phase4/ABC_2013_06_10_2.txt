THEN A HUGE JUMP, A CIA SPY IN
SWITZERLAND WORKING WITH
COMPUTERS.

SNOWDEN CLAIMED HE HAD QUITE THE
TOP SECRET RESUME FOR SOMEONE
WHO DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

IT TURNS OUT HE IS ABOUT ONE
OF 850,000 PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
WHO HAVE SUCH TOP SECRET
CLEARANCE.

NEIGHBORS SAID HE VANISHED ONE
DAY.

IS SNOWDEN HAS APPARENTLY WITH
HIM MORE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS
INCLUDING THE NAMES OF HUNDREDS
OF SECRET AGENTS.

BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT, EVERY MEAL
CAME FROM ROOM SERVICE, PILL
OH,S STUFFED UNDER THE DOOR TO
PREVENT EAVES DROPPING, AND HE
USED THE CODE NAME VERAX, LATIN
FOR TRUTH TELLER TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE WASHINGTON POST.

HE IS ON THE MOVE TONIGHT.

I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING SCHOOL
WORK AND COME TO FIND OUT HE
DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE FROM HIGH
SCHOOL.

DIANE, IT ALSO HAS AN
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S.
 WHAT DO INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS SAY TO YOU ABOUT
SOMEONE OF THAT RANK WITH ACCESS
TO THOSE TOP SECRETS?

THAT'S A FEAR I'LL LIVE UNDER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, HOWEVER
LONG THAT HAPPENS TO BE.

850,000.

WE BEGIN WITH ONE YOUNG AMERICAN
MAN WHO SAYS HE HAS CONTROL OF A
LOT OF THE NATION'S SECRETS
TONIGHT.
