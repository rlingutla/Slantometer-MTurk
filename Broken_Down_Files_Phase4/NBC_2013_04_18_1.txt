THEY HOPE TO KEEP LOOKING
THROUGH THE PICTURES AND AS THEY
COME UP WITH PICTURES THAT SHOW
PERHAPS BETTER VIEWS AND BETTER
RESOLUTION, THEY WILL RELEASE
THOSE, TOO.

SOMEBODY OUT THERE KNOWS
THESE INDIVIDUALS AS FRIENDS,
NEIGHBORS, CO-WORKERS OR FAMILY
MEMBERS OF THE SUSPECTS.

♪
CATHEDRAL, TEARS FLOWED OPENLY.

THEY SAY THEY DID NOT SEE THE
OTHER MAN ACTUALLY PLANTING A
BOMB.

FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA
TRAVELED WITH THE PRESIDENT
TODAY AND VISITED PATIENTS AND
STAFF AT SOME OF THE HOSPITALS
THAT TREATED THE WOUNDED.

HE WITNESSED THE START OF WHAT
SOMEONE TODAY CALLED THE FIRST
NATIONWIDE ELECTRONIC
CROWD-SOURCED MANHUNT OF THE
DIGITAL ERA.

WE LIVE IN SUCH A FREE COUNTRY
AND TO HAVE A SENSE OF
INSECURITY.

I HAVE LOOKED AT THE WEB
TONIGHT.

♪ THE LAND OF THE FREE
TODAY IS ITS HEART.

ALL RIGHT.

WHO ARE THESE TWO MEN?

THE PRESIDENT WAS HERE JUST A
FEW HOURS BEFORE WE LEARNED OF
THE SUSPECT.

WHEN THE CROWD WATCHING US
GLOMMED ONTO THE FACT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT PICTURES OF
SUSPECTS, THE SMARTPHONES
IMMEDIATELY CAME OUT.

FINALLY HERE TONIGHT IN THE
WAKE OF THE MARATHON BOMBINGS,
BOSTON STRONG HAS EMERGED AS THE
PHRASE AND THE ICONOGRAPHY THAT
THE ENTIRE REGION HAS TAKEN ON.

BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
THE GROUND, THEIR VISIBILITY IS
GOING TO BE LIMITED AS THE CROWD
IN FRONT OF THEM BLOCKS THEIR
VIEW.

SO, PETE, THE VIDEO AND
STILLS HAVE ONLY BEEN IN OUR
HANDS FOR ABOUT AN HOUR NOW.

REACHED OUT TO RESCUE AND
COMFORT.

♪
RECOVERING FROM A BROKEN LEG,
PERSONIFIED HIS CITY AS HE STOOD
TO SPEAK -- WOUNDED BUT
DETERMINED.

IT WAS SHORTLY BEFORE THE BOMB
THEIR ATTENTION WAS FOCUSED ON
THE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAT.

WE COME TOGETHER TO PRAY AND
MOURN.
