THIS IS ELECTRONICS AND
TECHNOLOGY.

WAS THIS DONE FOR POLITICAL
REASONS?

OF COURSE A FORMER NSA
CONTRACTOR JUST BLEW THE LID OFF
TWO GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS AND ARE THREATENING TO
DO MORE.

LAWMAKERS SAY FEWER PEOPLE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR
HANDS ON THE GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE DATA AFTER THESE
NEW HIGH PROFILE LEAKS.

MORE THAN HALF A MILLION
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS HAVE SOME
KIND OF SECURITY CLEARANCE.

TIME HE WANTS TO.

WHY DOES A CONTRACTOR HAVE
ACCESS TO INFORMATION WE ARE
SPENDING $13 BILLION TO PREVENT
OUTSIDERS FROM GETTING THEIR
HANDS ON.

QUOTING  WE HACK NETWORK
BACK BONES LIKE HUGE
INTERNET ROUTERS THAT GIVE
US ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS
WITHOUT HAVING TO HACK
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

ACCORDING TO A CONSULATE
WEB SITE IT CLOSES FOR
CHINESE AND AMERICAN
HOLIDAYS.

MORE RELATIVE'S MORRELL'S
REPLACEMENT WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

WHEN ASKED MORE THAN 70%
SAY THEY THINK CONGRESS
SHOULD CONTINUE TO
INVESTIGATE THE IRS, THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND
BENGHAZI RESPECTIVELY.

BUT WE'RE LEARNING HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTORS ARE
ABLE TO ACCESS TOP SECRET
SECURITY INFORMATION.

AND AN ISSUE WHICH THE
PRESIDENT WELCOMES THE
DEBATE ON AND THE
ADMINISTRATION HAS WELCOMED
THE DEBATE ON WHICH IS
SURVEILLANCE.

AND GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO
MEAN TO DO HARM.

DECLASSIFY SOME OF THE
INFORMATION SO HE CAN TELL
ALL THE US ABOUT HOW THE
SURVEILLANCE WORKS.

THIS SESSION IS CLASSIFIED
AND CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC
TODAY WE LEARNED THE DEPUTY
DIRECTOR OF THE CIA
RESIGNED.

EDWARD SNOWDEN REPORTEDLY
CLAIMS THE U.S. HAS BEEN
HACKING CHINESE COMPUTERS
FOR YEARS.

HE SAYS IF THE GOVERNMENT
RELEASES TOO MANY DETAILS,
QUOTE  AMERICANS WILL DIE.

BUT THIS ISSUE HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

IT WAS MADE SOME TIME AGO.
