HE'S TOURING THE COMMAND CENTER
THERE WITH THE SHERIFF WHO HAS
DONE AMAZING WORK IN THE WAKE OF
THIS HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

IT'S A FIVE NETWORK POOL.

ADAM LAXAULT.

NOW YOU HAVE SENATOR JOHN CORNYN
SAYING MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT
BANNING THESE.

THERE'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A
CLASH IN CONGRESS OVER HOW FAR
TO GO IN THE WAKE OF THIS
INCIDENTS.

HE'S A SICK, DEMENTED MAN.

THAT'S WHAT KIND OF MAKES THE
TRIGGER TURN INTO AUTOMATICALLY
ENGAGED WEAPON, SHEP.

FROM HERE, THE PRESIDENT WANTS
TO MEET THE HEROS OF THE EVENT
THAT WERE AT THE IT IS ON SUNDAY
NIGHT.

THOSE GUNS WORTH BETWEEN
$100,000 AND $110,000.

SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME
INCREMENTAL PATH FORWARD TO SOME
KIND OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING
TO DO THIS KIND OF WEAPONRY
WHERE 800 ROUNDS CAN GO OFF IN A
MINUTE AND KILL SO MANY
PEOPLING.

THAT'S THEIR POSITION.

WE'LL SEE THEM IN A COUPLE
MINUTES.

ABOUT A MINUTE AGO, WE GOT A
TWO-MINUTE WARNING ON THIS.

I CAN TELL YOU ON BEHALF OF
OUR COUNTRY, OUR GREAT, GREAT
COUNTRY, WE WANT TO THANK YOU.

WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE THE
BRAVERY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
WITNESSED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

HELLO, MAYOR.

EARLIER, THE PRESIDENT AND THE
FIRST LADY MET VICTIMS AND MED
CAT WORKERS AT A HOSPITAL IN
LAS VEGAS.

GET BACK.

HE SAID THERE WILL BE TIME FOR
THAT.

I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
