I ALREADY HAD MY BAG.

THAT'S KIND OF GROUND ZERO.

CLASSROOMS COMPLETELY
OBLITERATED, AN AUDITORIUM CAVED
IN.

BACK HERE IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, LET'S SPEND A MOMENT
TALKING ABOUT THE TRUE FIRST
RESPONDERS, THE RESCUE TEAMS,
THE NATIONAL GUARD.

SHE'S ALIVE.

THIS ONE TOOK HIS HOME.

WE'VE STARTED THE PROCESS
ALREADY.

I MEAN, IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT
OUR KIDS IN A HALL AND TEACH
THEM HOW TO CROUCH AND HOLD
THEIR HANDS OVER THEIR HEAD, WE
HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE THAT'S NOT
GOING TO BE BLOWN APART.

IT WAS PRETTY LOUD.

ROOM FOR A SHELTER IS A
DIFFERENT MATTER.

AND I DID THE TEACHER THING THAT
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT SUPPOSED TO
DO, I PRAYED, AND I PRAYED OUT
LOUD.

THERE'S ACTUAL FEMA HERE IN
OKLAHOMA.

TONIGHT AS WE STAND HERE
TALKING --
 A WEEK AND A HALF AGO THE
ATMOSPHERE DECIDED
WE'RE GOING TO PULL A SWITCH,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
THE TORNADO DROUGHT IS OVER AND
YOU'VE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THAT.

MINUTES THE LANDSCAPE OF THIS
SUBURBAN TOWN WAS CHANGED
FOREVER.

WE LEARNED TODAY OFFICIALLY WHAT
TORE THROUGH HERE YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON WAS, IN FACT, AN EF-5
TORNADO.

AND THEY POINT OUT
WE COULD SEE AS MANY AS 20,000
PEOPLE DISPLACED BY ALL THIS.

THESE SISTERS TOOK THEIR OWN
CHILDREN FROM THE SCHOOL JUST
MINUTES BEFORE THE TORNADO HIT.

LUCKILY THOSE DIRE NUMBERS DID
NOT MATERIALIZE, BUT SADLY THERE
HAS WELL BEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH
BAD NEWS TO GO AROUND AT THAT
SCHOOL.

SHE'S AT A HOSPITAL IN NORMAN.

THE INSURANCE CLAIMS LIKELY
TOPPING $1 BILLION, BUT LUCKILY
THERE WILL BE TIME TO DISCUSS
ALL OF THAT.
