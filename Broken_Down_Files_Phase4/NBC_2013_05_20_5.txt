ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE REPORT
THAT MANY SCHOOL CHILDREN MAY
HAVE BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE ONE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

WE HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND --
WE HAD A LONG WIND-UP ON SEVERE
WEATHER.

BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN EITHER AN
F4 OR F5, THE STRONGEST
INTENSITY ON EARTH, IT WAS OVER
A MILE WIDE AT THE BASE OF THE
STORM.

DON'T LOSE YOUR LIFE.

HER NEIGHBORS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.

PEOPLE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE ARE
STRUGGLING IN THAT WAY AS WELL.

THEY WERE BEING PROTECTED BY
SOME OF THE TEACHERS THAT WORKED
IN THIS SCHOOL BUILDING.

I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED
HERE.

SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL STILL GO
THROUGH THE BUILDING THROUGH
NIGHT, WE ARE TOLD BY
FIREFIGHTERS, TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

ANOTHER BREAK.

IT'S ALREADY DIFFICULT FOR
PEOPLE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY LIVED.

IT'S TOTALLY DESTROYED.

A MASSIVE TORNADO JUST OUTSIDE
OKLAHOMA CITY.

OUR FRIENDS AT KFOR, THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER PUTTING THE EARLY DEATH
TOLL AT 37 SOULS TONIGHT.

THIS THING HASN'T DECREASED
IN SIZE ANY.

MIKE, EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT, PEOPLE UNABLE TO
FIND ADDRESSES, UNABLE TO LOCATE
WHERE THEY ONCE LIVED.

IT'S TOTAL DEVASTATION.

YOU JUST CAN'T FIND ADDRESSES
OUT HERE.

JESSE WELLS FOR KFOR FOR THAT
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE WE MAY
HAVE A VERY, VERY GRIM SITUATION
AS THE SEARCH AND RESCUE GOES
ON.

BUT SO FAR THE STATE MEDICAL
EXAMINER HAS TOLD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS THE INITIAL DEATH TOLL IS
37 FROM THIS ONE TORNADO.
