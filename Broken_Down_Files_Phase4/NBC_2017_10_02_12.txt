SOME CLINGING TO LIFE,
OTHERS WALKING
WOUNDED.

THEY FOUND 64-YEAR-OLD
STEPHEN PADDOCK THERE.

HE WAS SHOT IN THE
CHEST.

AS OF RIGHT NOW AT
LEAST 59 DEAD,
HUNDREDS INJURED
AS WE COME ON THE AIR
A BROKEN-OUT WINDOW ON
THE UPPER FLOOR OF THE
MANDALAY BAY HOTEL
BEHIND ME POINTS TO
WHERE HELL WAS
UNLEASHED.

THE IMAGES ARE HARD TO
SHAKE.

SURVIVORS DESCRIBING
SCENES OF SHEER
TERROR.

FAMILIES ARE BEING
DIRECTED HERE TO THIS
CONVENTION CENTER.

AND MIKE TOLD US HE'S
PLANNING TO DONATE
BLOOD FOR THE INJURED.

KEVLAR HELMETS AND
VESTS, THEY TENDED TO
THE WOUNDED ANY WAY
THEY COULD.

JUST LIKE AN
ASTEROID FELL OUT OF
THE SKY.

WE ACTUALLY LOADED
FOUR WOUNDED PEOPLE UP
IN THE BACK OF A
PICKUP TRUCK AND TRIED
TO GET TO THE
HOSPITAL.

THEY LAID OVER TOP
OF US EVERY TIME A
ROUND WAS FIRED.

I DIDN'T KNOW TO GET
UP, TO RUN, JUST TO
STAY, TO DUCK.

IN LAS
VEGAS A GRIM NEW
RECORD IS ABOUT TO BE
SET.

MY SON WAS THERE.

A TIMELINE OF THE
HEROES.

I LOVED QUINTON.

I GRABBED MY SON BY
THE HAND.

BULLETS FLYING
EVERYWHERE.

WE'RE GETTING SHOT
AT.
