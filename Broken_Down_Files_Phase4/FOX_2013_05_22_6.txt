ONE MAN WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS
AMONG THOSE KILLED AT PLAZA
HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
SAYS HE ARRIVED THERE 10
MINUTES AFTER THE TWISTER
HIT AND HE SAYS WHEN HE
FINALLY RETURNED TO HIS
HOUSE, WITHOUT HIS CHILD
HIS HOME WAS GONE.

THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE THEY
HAVE NOW FOUND ALL OF THE
SURVIVORS.

YOU CAN TALK TO ME PEOPLE
WHEN THEY ARE ON TOP OF
THEIR-WHAT WAS THEIR HOME
AND THEY ARE IN GOOD
SPIRITS FOR THE MOST PART.

AND PRESIDENT OBAMA SET TO
VISIT HERE THIS SUNDAY TO
MEET WITH SURVIVORS AND
FIRST RESPONDERS OR THAT'S
THE PLAN AS THE PRESIDENT
COMES TO THE HEARTLAND THIS
SUNDAY.

THEY WERE FURTHER DOWN THAN
I WAS.

JUST AS JOPLIN, MISSOURI
DID, AS SOUTH MISSISSIPPI
DID, AND AS THE NORTHEAST
DID AFTER SUPER STORM
SANDY, THEY WILL NEED US
AND AS AMERICANS, WE WILL
BE THERE FOR THEM BECAUSE
THAT'S HOW WE ROLL.

PINNED UP AGAINST THE WALL
WITH ONE OF THOSE BRING
PILLARS.

TWO OF THEM INFANTS.

GROUND NOW, MOORE
OKLAHOMA, WHERE TODAY THE
MEDICAL EXAMINER ANNOUNCED
HIS OFFICE HAS IDENTIFIED
ALMOST ALL OF THE 24 PEOPLE
WHO DIED IN THE TORNADO
MONDAY.

HE WAS IN TOWN BEFORE THE
STORM HIT.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT NOW AND
FOR THE FIRST TIME ADMITS
MULTIPLE U.S. CITIZENS HAVE
DIED IN COUNTER TERRORISM
OPERATIONS OVERSEAS.

AND THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE
WE WATCHED FROM THE
HELICOPTER TWO DAYS AGO AS
RESCUE WORKERS AND
NEIGHBORS WERE PULLING AWAY
ALL OF THE -- WHAT WAS LEFT
OF THE SCHOOL TO TRY TO GET
TO THE CHILDREN.

FOR A WHILE, THE THEATER
REPORTEDLY SERVED AS A HUB
FOR VOLUNTEERS.

AND THEN THERE WILL BE A
HOME HERE AND A HOME THERE.

CARS FLEW INTO THE
CLASSROOMS.

A LIVE LOOK AT THAT THEATER
WITH THE BILLBOARD UP "GOD
BLESS MOORE."

HOW THEY ESCAPED NEXT.

LET'S GO AHEAD NOW AND
SWITCH BACK TO THE RIGHT

TOBY KEITH TOLD ME THAT IS
SOMETHING THAT COMES
NATURAL TO SOONERS.

AND WHEN YOU CALL SOME
PLACE HOME, YOU CAN TELL
THAT PEOPLE ALREADY
STARTING TO PICK THEMSELVES
UP.
