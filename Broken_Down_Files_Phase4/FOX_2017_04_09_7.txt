PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.

AND REASON THEY ARE CONCERNED IS
BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER HOW
QUICKLY THINGS WENT SOUTH IN
LIBYA WITH GADHAFI WAS TOPPLED.

ONE SURVIVOR OF THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK THAT SPURRED THAT
OPERATION SAID PEOPLE SHOULD
FORGET THE POLITICS.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LEADERS TO
BE ABLE TO SEE CLARITY THROUGH
CHAOS.

BUT, LEADERS MUST ACT.

TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN
CONGRESS.

HE IS KILLING NOT ONLY HUMAN
BEINGS AND CHILDREN, BUT ANIMALS
AS IF THEY WERE THE SAME.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I FAINTED.

IT WAS WATCHING VIDEOS OF
THIS HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK
WHICH DROVE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO
INTERVENE.

THE ASSAD REGIME TOOK THEM OUT
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

FAMILY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

CONGRESS DOES NEED TO LEAD AND
THAT NEED TO HAVE A VOICE IN
THIS.

THE BEST THING WE CAN DO AS
LEADERS IN CONGRESS IS TO TAKE
IT UP IN DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT
IT.

IT IS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND
WATCHING THE IMAGES AND
LISTENING TO THAT FAMILY.

WHEN YOU COME BACK, I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT VETERANS AFFAIRS.
