AN INCIDENT AT THE LIBRARY NOW
APPEARS TO BE UNRELATED, A
MECHANICAL FIRE

I REALIZED IT WAS AN EXPLOSION,
TURNED TO MY RIGHT TO LEAVE THE
AREA.

AND WE ALL KIND OF PAUSED AND
THE EARTH SHOOK.

SO THE RUNNERS THAT WERE INJURED
WERE EXHAUSTED FROM THE RUN AND
THE SPECTATORS WHO WERE INJURED
WERE SIMPLY IN TOTAL SHOCK.

TELL ME EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE,
WHAT YOU SAW, WHAT YOU HEARD.

POLICE IN ACTION, STANDING
OVER A FALLEN MARATHON RUNNER.

SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT YOUR
FELLOW RUNNERS?

IT WAS VERY LOUD.

I SAW QUITE A FEW CASUALTIES,
ONE GUY WITH HIS LEGS GONE AT
THE KNEES.

YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NOT A LOT
OF CHAOS.

THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S
DIRECTED THE FULL RESOURCES OF
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP
NOT ONLY WITH THE INVESTIGATION
IN BOSTON AND THE RECOVERY IN
BOSTON, BUT ALSO TO SECURE OTHER
PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES AS
NECESSARY.

BOOM, YOU FELT IT, IT HURT YOUR
EARS.

IMMEDIATELY AMBULANCES STARTED
PILING THROUGH.

I SAW RUNNERS IN FRONT OF ME
FALL, SOME WITH INJURIES, AND
THEN I LOOKED OVER AND SAW JUST
A PILE OF BODIES, THE WORST
THING I THINK I'VE EVER SEEN IN
MY LIFE.

WHEN WE COME BACK, A RUNNER WHO
WAS CROSSING THE FINISH LINE
WHEN THOSE BOMBS WENT OFF.

APPARENTLY THEY HAD TAKEN ALL
THE BLAST AND I WAS UNSCATHED.

SO WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED ABOUT
THE INVESTIGATION?

WE ATTEMPTED RESUSCITATION OF A
YOUNG LADY, GOT HER BACK TO THE
MEDICAL TENT, BUT SHE DID NOT
MAKE IT.

THEN I SMELLED A LOT OF SMOKE.
