THAT AND CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF THE DISASTER IN
THE HEARTLAND.

THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY NONE OF THE CHILDREN AT
BRIAR WOOD PERISHED.

[SIREN]
 A LOT OF RUMBLING.

THE WOMAN CENTER AND BACK
BEHIND JUST WHAT'S LEFT OF
THIS FACILITY.

THAT RAIN TODAY AND COLD
AND REALLY DRAINING.

FELLOW WHO LIVES JUST
ACROSS THE STREET, HIS NAME
IS JIM GARNER.

IT'S ONE THING YOU KEEP
YOUR KIDS IN A ROUTINE AND
EVERY DAY YOU WANT TO EAT
AT THIS TIME.

OF THAT JOHN, IT'S MY
UNDERSTANDING YOU MET A MAN
WHOSE DAUGHTER REALLY
DIDN'T TRUST THAT THE
SCHOOLS COULD BE SAFE IN
THE STORM.

THE COMMUNITY HERE WILL
REBUILD.

HER COUSIN HAD CAME DOWN
AND BROTHER AND THEY
BROUGHT SOME SUPPLIES.

I UNDERSTAND.

NOW CORY'S TEACHER IS
IN THE HOSPITAL, RIGHT
WITH AN ARM INJURY.

TODAY WE SPOKE WITH A WOMAN
WHO WENT TO JOPLIN BACK
THEN TO HELP.

TEAM FOX COVERAGE BEGINS
NOW.

DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
WHY IT HAPPENED TO US.

AND WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM
A GRANDFATHER WHOSE
DAUGHTER AND CHILDREN AS
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY.

LOOK AT THIS.

THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS
BEFORE.

NOW, THE RED CROSS SAYS
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ACTUALLY PREFER TO STAY
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

SHE SAYS THE ENTIRE ROOM
VANISHED DOG AND ALL.
