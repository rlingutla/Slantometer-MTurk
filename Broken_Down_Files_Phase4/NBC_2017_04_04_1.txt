ONE OF THE DEADLIEST
OF ITS KIND IN SYRIA'S
SIX YEARS CIVIL WAR.

IN 2013, THE U.S. THREATENED WAR WHEN
MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE
WERE KILLED IN ANOTHER
ALLEGED CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

AMAZINGLY, THE
ACTIVIST SURVIVED.

VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO
A MAKESHIFT CLINIC
BUILT IN A CAVE TO
PROTECT IT.

A WORD OF CAUTION.

THERE, A FATHER KISSED
HIS DAUGHTER GOOD-BYE.

CHILDREN GASPING FOR
AIR, ASSAD BLAMED FOR
A GRISLY MASSACRE ON
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

WITNESSES SAY IT WAS A
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK.

AND ANOTHER
TROUBLE SPOT OVERSEAS,
SYRIA, THE WORLD
REACTING WITH HORROR
AND REVULSION TO THE
APPARENT POISON GAS
ATTACK THAT KILLED
DOZENS OF CIVILIANS
AND SICKENED DOZENS
MORE, MANY SMALL
CHILDREN.

TONIGHT, CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

THE WHITE HOUSE
TONIGHT POINTING THE
FINGER OF BLAME TO
SYRIAN PRESIDENT
ASSAD, ALSO CALLING
OUT THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION,
SUGGESTING IF IT STOOD
UP TO ASSAD DURING ITS
WATCH, THIS MIGHT NOT
HAVE HAPPENED.

THE SYRIAN ARMY DENIES
IT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

THERE ARE UPSETTING
IMAGES IN THIS REPORT.

NOW, IS PRESIDENT
TRUMP WILLING TO STEP
IN?

NO ONE IS DOING
ANYTHING TO STOP THESE
DEATH ATTACKS.

MEDICS AND VOLUNTEERS
IN THIS REBEL
CONTROLLED PART OF
SYRIA RUSHED THE
INJURED TO LOCAL
CLINICS, THEY CLAIM
SYRIAN PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL ASSAD'S
REGIME FIRED WITH A
CHEMICAL NERVE AGENT
BANNED, SARIN.

FIRST RESPONDERS
DOUSED THE VICTIMS
WITH WATER AND
STRIPPED OFF THEIR
CLOTHES TO WASH OFF
WHAT THEY SAID WAS A
CHEMICAL WEAPON.

IN A STATEMENT ON
TODAY'S ATTACK,
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS
BY THE BASHAR AL ASSAD
REGIME ARE A
CONSEQUENCE OF THE
PAST ADMINISTRATION'S
WEAKNESS.

BUT WHEN RUSSIA
BROKERED A DEAL, A
U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE
NEVER CAME.

PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD
WARNED THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS WOULD
CROSS A RED LINE.
