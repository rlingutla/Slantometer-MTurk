WE ARE TOLD THEY COULD COME HE
IS IN A HOSPITAL BED.

THERE IS A LOT OF PAL
PAITATIONS IN THE F.B.I.

NO MOTHER MOVEMENT IN THE
BOAT AT THIS TIME.

WE'LL LOOK AT SPECIAL
INSIGHT WITH DAVID WILLIAMS
WHO IS LIVE WITH US IN
WASHINGTON.

SO THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THAT
SHOT.

THE CAR HE ABANDONED HAD BLOOD
STAINS AND WE DID A SEARCH
INSIDE OF THE PERIMETER.

36,000 RUNNERS HIT THE STREETS
OF LONDON FOR THAT CITY'S BIG
MARATHON.

THE F.B.I.

POLICE OFFICER AND HEART AND
SOUL OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE
MARATON.

IT IS THE BOTTOM OF THE HOUR
AND TIME FOR THE TOP OF THE
NEWS AND THE UNCLE OF THE
BOSTON TERROR SUSPECT SPEAKING
OUT SAYING HE IS RELEGALED
THAT THE YOUNGER BROTHER IS
STILL ALIVE.

FOR HIS OWN SAKE TO GET
FORGIVENESS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE
BEEN HARMED AND HAVE BEEN
HURT.

HE SAID COURTS.

A LOT OF LOVE HERE TOO,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

FROM THE FAMILIES OF THE
VICTIMS.

THEY ARE DUMMY ROUNDS FIRED IN
THE BOAT SO EVERYBODY HOLD
FIRE.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT, THE SUSPECT
WORKING OUT IN A GYM, HANGING
OUT AND PARTYING.

APPARENTLY YOU DID.

FIRST QUESTION, WHAT DO I
KNOW ABOUT THE GROUP, VERY
LITTLE.

THAT IS THE SPOT IT ENDED FOR
HIM AND HIS LIFE OF FREEDOM IS
MOST LIKELY OVER .

MY PHONE STARTED TO RING AND
MY COUSIN SAID THEY CAUGHT HIM
AND I COULD GO OUT .
