DEFENSE.

BOMBED OUT FUEL TANKS AND DAMAGE
TO AIRCRAFT SHELTERS.

THE MARKINGS FROM THE BOMBINGS
SEEN ON BUNKERS.

WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
ANNOUNCED THE STRIKE HE POINTED
TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED.

NOT LONG AGO TRUMP WAS RELUCTANT
TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.

OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO
CHANGE TO OUR MILITARY POSTURE.

ABC EAST ALEX MARQUARDT LEADS US
SYRIAN AIRBASE HIT BY THE U.S.
MILITARY BACK UP AND
RUNNING, NEW PHOTOS SHOWING
SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF LESS THAN
24 HOURS AFTER THE U.S. STRIKE.

BACK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
WANTED TO PUNISH SYRIA FOR A
PREVIOUS CHEMICAL ATTACK.

DESCRIBING THE MOMENT THE PHOTO
WAS TAKEN YOUSSEF SAID I WASN'T
AWARE OF ANYTHING.

PRESIDENT STILL INSISTS THE
TOMAHAWK MISSILE STRIKE WAS AN
UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.

THAT FATHER'S STORY AND THE
IMAGES SO DEVASTATING.

TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP
DEFENDING THE DECISION NOT TO
BOMB THE RUNWAYS.

THE REASON YOU GENERALLY DON'T
HIT RUNWAYS IS THAT THEY ARE
EASY AND INEXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY
FIX.

WE ARE CALLING ON BASHAR AL
ASSAD TO CEASE THE USE OF THE
WEAPONS.

HE LOST 25 RELATIVES IN THE
ATTACK DURING WHICH HE FAINTED.

EVEN BEAUTIFUL BABIES WERE
CRUELLY MURDERED IN THIS VERY
BARBARIC ATTACK.

EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT WAS
JUGGLING TWO FOREIGN ISSUES,
CHINA AND SYRIA.

ASKED FOR THEM HE SAID.
