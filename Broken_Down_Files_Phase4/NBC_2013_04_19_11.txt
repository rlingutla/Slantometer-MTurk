THIS WHOLE AREA IS FIVE
STREETS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

SOME OF WHICH FOLKS HAVE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE BECAUSE THEY ARE FOR
SPECIALIZED TASKS.

HAVING BEEN IN SIMILAR
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS WORKING
WITH TACTICAL TEAMS, THIS IS A
HAND IN GLOVE OPERATION.

WE HAVE SEEN THIS ALL NIGHT
LONG.

IT'S BEEN A HORRIFYING NIGHT
IN BOSTON, THE WORLD HAS BEEN
WATCHING WHAT'S HAPPENING.

WE JUST SAW KIND OF A SECOND
ARRIVE.

OLDER BROTHER AND YOUNGER.

THOSE ARE ERECTABLE SPOTLIGHTS
THEY CAN PUT UP.

JUST TOLD WE HAVE ANOTHER GUEST.

MEANING THE FBI IS IN CHARGE.

FROM THE SCENE ACCORDING TO MY
SOURCE THE SUSPECT IS IN
CUSTODY.

THEY ARE UNITED IN PURPOSE.

IT ENDED WITH A WHIMPER, NOT A
BANG.

INCREDIBLE COORDINATION BETWEEN
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

BY THE WAY, THE BOAT SEEMED TO
HAVE A SHRINK WRAP.

THEY ARE BRINGING HIM UP IN THIS
DIRECTION.

OKAY.

THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT SORT
OF CONDITION IS HE IN.

THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
HEARD LAST NIGHT WITH EXPLOSIONS
AND SHOTS.

THIS IS A TIME TO READ A SAD
STATEMENT FROM THE FAMILY OF
SEAN COLLIER, THE POLICE OFFICER
KILLED LAST NIGHT ON THE M.I.T. CAMPUS.
