CHECKED IN, CARRYING MULTIPLE
BAGS AND LIKELY PASSING A SIGN
JUST LIKE THIS.

SO, HE JUST ONE TIME PULLED
HIS PHONE OUT AND SAID, HERE'S A
PICTURE OF THE SLOT MACHINE
WHERE WE WON $20,000.

RELATIVES, DANLEY APPARENTLY MET
PADDOCK AT THIS HOTEL CASINO IN
RENO, WHERE SHE WORKED AS A
HOSTESS TO ENTERTAIN HIGH
ROLLERS, LIKE PADDOCK.

THE DISCOVERY BY POLICE OF SO
MANY WEAPONS, SO MUCH AMMUNITION
AND EXPLOSIVES AT THE HOME THEY
SHARED IN MESQUITE, NEVADA.

YEAH, HE ONLY HAD A
TWO-SEATER TRUCK, SO, I WAS
LAYING MANY THE BED WITH HIS
NIGHT OUT OF HER HEAD.

PLAYING OUT STILL.

AND THERE WAS ANOTHER MAJOR
DEVELOPMENT LATE TODAY.

THE DOOR THAT S.W.A.T. TEAMS
BROKE DOWN.

SHOOTER MAY HAVE HAD EYES ON
THEM.

BUT PADDOCK DIDN'T JUST BRING IN
A FIREARM.

THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HERO WAS
GRAZED BY A BULLET, TOO, BUT IS
NO LONGER AT THE HOSPITAL.

AND I THINK, AS A MOM, KNOWING
THAT THEY HAD TO SEE THAT, AND
THAT'S STUCK WITH THEM FOREVER.

WE NOW KNOW THE GUNMAN WAS
FIRING FOR NINE MINUTES AFTER
THAT FIRST 911 CALL CAME IN.

MORE THAN 100 PATIENTS BROUGHT
TO THIS HOSPITAL ALONE.

EVEN ORDERING ROOM SERVICE
SEVERAL TIMES?

SOME HERO CAME AND SAVED ME,
NAME?

YEAH.

YEAH, SOMEHOW IT WENT
UNNOTICED.

DOCTORS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO
THEY WERE OPERATING ON, IT WAS
HAPPENING SO FAST.

THEN HE GOT SHOT, TWICE.
