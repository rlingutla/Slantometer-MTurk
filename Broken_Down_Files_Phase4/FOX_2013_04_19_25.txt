AND A LOT OF COMMOTION.

THE FIRST SWAT VEHICLE
LIGHTS AND SIRENS FOR THE
FIRST TIME WE HAVE HEARD
HERE ALL DAY ACCORDING TO
THE CREWS WHO HAVE BEEN
HERE.

SHOTS FIRED IN THIS
VICINITY IS WHAT WE ARE
GETTING CALLS OF.

AGAIN, THE SUSPECT
COMPLETELY SURROUNDED AND
NOW LATE WORD THAT ARE AS
MANY AS 8 TO 10 BLASTS AND
JUST HEARD TWO MORE.

LIVE PICTURE OF THIS
AMBULANCE RIGHT ON FRANKLIN
STREET.

AGAIN, WE HAVE NO WAY OF
KNOWING.

AS MANY AS 30 SHOTS FIRED
JUST DOWN THE STREET JUST A
FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM WHERE
OUR POLICE HAVE BEEN
SEARCHING FOR THIS SUSPECT
NUMBER 2 FOR HOURS.

HE THOUGHT HE HEARD AS MANY
AS 20.

AGAIN, THAT'S FROM A SOURCE
CLOSE TO THE FBI.

WE ARE SEEING FLASHES IN
LIGHT IN ADDITION TO THE
STROBE LIGHTS COMING FROM
THE VEHICLE.

JUST LIKE A ROLL OF FIRE
CRACKERS GETTING SHOT OFF.

[GUNFIRE]
 HOLY, HOLY.

STATE POLICE HELICOPTER IS
ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE THE
LOCATION WHERE THESE
EXPLOSIONS ARE ARE
HAPPENING.

WE COULDN'T GO ON FRANKLY.

RIGHT NOW I'
HIDING BEHIND A TREE RIGHT
NOW AND LOOKING AT THE
SCENE AND SEEING THE
ARMORED VEHICLE AND THE
HELICOPTERS ABOVE US RIGHT
NOW.

TALKING TO RESIDENTS THAT
WERE JUST COMING OUT OF
THEIR HOMES AFTER THE ORDER
WAS LIFTED TALKING ABOUT
WHAT THEIR EXPERIENCES WERE
LIKE OVER THE LAST 16
HOURS, HOW NERVOUS THEY
WERE GOING THROUGH ANOTHER
NIGHT NOT KNOWING IF THE
SUSPECT WAS CAUGHT OR
KNOWING THAT HE WASN'T
CAUGHT.

STATE POLICE ARE FLOODING
THIS AREA.

I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME
EXPERIENCE IN THE MILITARY
AS YOU ARE A MARINE WHO
ALSO WORKED WITH
EXPLOSIVES, SO TELL US A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND
WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OR
DIDN'T HEAR.

MAKESHIFT GRENADES.

HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
