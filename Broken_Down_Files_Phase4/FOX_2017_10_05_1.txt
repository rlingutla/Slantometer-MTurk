WE'LL SEE HOW QUICKLY
CONGRESSIONAL LAWMAKERS CAN
UNPACK SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
SHEPARD.

POLICE WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, THE
WHITE HOUSE WEIGHING IN ON A
CONTROVERSIAL GUN DEVICE WHICH
MAY HAVE HELPED THE VEGAS
SHOOTER CARRY OUT HIS MADNESS.

A QUIET MILLIONAIRE WOULD
SUDDENLY SHOOT 58 PEOPLE.

I WONDER IF THEY DON'T KNOW
ABOUT MOTIVE THAN WHAT WE'RE
HEARI
HEARING?

JOE MANCHIN, HEIDI HEIDCAMP,
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO
AHEAD, WHY INVESTIGATORS SAY THE
KILLER IN LAS VEGAS MAY HAVE HAD
HELP.

THEY SAY STEPHEN PADDOCK RENTED
ROOMS OVERLOOKING TWO OTHER
MUSIC FESTIVALS.

UNLV ANNOUNCED THAT SATURDAY
NIGHT'S GAME AGAINST SAN DIEGO
STATE WILL BE CALLED HERO'S
NIGHT.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM THE
INVESTIGATORS.

RIGHT.

THE PLAYERS TO WEAR THIS HELMET
THIS SATURDAY AND THROUGH THE
END OF THE SEASON.

IT WILL GO INTO HIS FINANCIAL
BACKGROUND, GOES INTO ANYBODY HE
CONTACTED.

IT COMES JUST AFTER THE NATIONAL
RIFLE ASSOCIATION CALLED ON THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REVIEW
WHETHER BUMP STOCKS COMPLY WITH
THE LAW.

THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATION
WILL GO.

WE'LL HAVE THAT NEXT.

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I
PERSONALLY NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE
THIS.

YOU'RE NOT SEEING ANYTHING ON
HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINES.

THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE WORKING
WITH MULTIPLE SHOOTERS.

WE KNOW THIS PRESIDENT WAS AT
ONE POINT A NEW YORK LIBERAL.

NOW THE CHICAGO POLICE HAVE IN
FACT CONFIRMED THIS IS THE VERY
SAME STEPHEN PADDOCK THAT DID
BOOK THAT HOTEL AT THE
BLACKSTONE OVERLOOKING
LOLLAPALOOZA.

WE DON'T.
