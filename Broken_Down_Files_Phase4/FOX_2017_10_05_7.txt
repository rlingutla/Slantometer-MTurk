A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE LAS VEGAS GUNMAN, STEPHEN
PADDOCK.

THE BLACKSTONE HOTEL RELEASED A
STATEMENT.

LISTEN TO THIS.

OTHERWISE, IT WOULD BE A SUPER
HUMAN EFFORT TO PULL OFF WHAT HE
DID ALONE.

WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO CONFIRM THAT WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH TO RULE IT OUT.

AT ONE POINT IN TIME, THE RADIO
TRAFFIC WAS SO JUMBLED THAT THE
FIREFIGHTERS DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHERE THE SHOOTING WAS COMING
FROM.

WE'RE LEARNING THE GUNMAN MAY
HAVE HAD OTHER TARGETS IN MIND.

FBI AGENTS QUESTIONED THE
GUNMAN'S GIRLFRIEND YESTERDAY.

THIS IS THE ONE AREA AT BEST
THAT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU'RE FOR
GUN CONTROL OR GUN CONTROL OF
THIS TYPE THAT YOU'LL FIND ANY
KIND OF COALESCING OF PEOPLE
SUPPORTING IT.

THEY WERE WORKING THIS WHOLE
TRIAGE SETUP UNDER FIRE.

SO WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT ON
THE REPORTS OF THE AVIATION FUEL
TANKS, WE JUST MENTIONED
FUEL TANKS WERE HIT BE SOME
BULLETS.

THIS IS AS MUCH COALESCING
AROUND ONE PROACTIVE THING THAT
THEY COULD DO IN LEGISLATION
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE SHERIFF
WHO DIDN'T GIVE ANY OTHER
DETAILS.

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN TELL
US HOW OR WHAT PADDOCK WAS
FEELING.

YOU WINDER IF HE WON'T MIGRATE
IN THAT DIRECTION.

IF AN ATTACK HAPPENS, IT'S AN
ISLAMIC ATTACK OR RACIALLY
MOTIVATED ATTACK.

THAT'S ALL PART OF THE
INVESTIGATION.

WE WELCOME THAT.

HE SEEMED TO HAVE VARIOUS
DIFFERENT JOBS, ALL GOOD JOBS,
BUT DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND
DIFFERENT JOBS.

THERE'S REPORTS THAT PADDOCK
SCOUTED OUT HOTELS IN FENWAY
PARK IN BOSTON AND WE'RE
LEARNING HE MIGHT HAVE PLANNED
TO ESCAPE AFTER THE VEGAS
ATTACK.
