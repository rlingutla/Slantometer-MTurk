BEING ABLE TO SEE HER AND
SHE IS OKAY.

WE HAVE MOORE INFORMATION
AT OUR WEB SITE.

IT'S THE HEARTLAND OF
AMERICA.

WE HAVE AN IMAGE OF ONE
CHILD WHO PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS
WAS CALLING OUT FOR HIS
FATHER AS MEN PULLED HIM
FROM THE SHATTERED CONCRETE
OF THAT SCHOOL.

EVERYTHING IS GONE, YOU
KNOW.

SHE HID WITH THEM IN THE
CELLAR.

SHE SAID SHE WASN'T
SCARED BUT I KNOW IT WAS
PROBABLY A DIFFERENT STORY
IN THERE I WASN'T THERE.

I GUESS THE WALLS CAVED IN
WHERE THEY WERE AND THEY
TOLD ME SOMETHING HAD
LANDED ON HER ARM.

ALL THE ORDINARY EFFECTS OF
EVERY DAY LIFE TURN TO
PIECES AND SCATTERED IN THE
WIND AFTER A COLUMN OF
DESTRUCTION DROPPED FROM
THE SKY AND CHEWED A
17-MILE PATH ACROSS THIS
CITY AND REGION.

HOMES HERE GONE, SHREDDED,
CRUSHED WALLS AND
FURNITURE.

THIS I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW IS SHE DOING THERE?

BROUGHT THEM HOME AND
TOOK THEM IMMEDIATELY TO
THE UNDERGROUND TORNADO
SHELTER RIGHT BEHIND THEIR
HOUSE.

NOT A SINGLE STRUCTURE
STANDING AS FAR AS THE
CAMERA COULD SEE.

BUT WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS
ARE SAYING PRIVATELY THAT
LIKELY GO AT SOME POINT BUT
RIGHT NOW PUBLICLY, THEY
ARE SAYING HE DOES NOT WANT
TO GET IN THE WAY OF ALL
THE FIRST RESPONDERS TRYING
TO YOU KNOW, BRING
EVERYONE TOGETHER, TRY IN
THAT RECOVERY MISSION TO
DEAL WITH EVERYONE ON THE
GROUND.

SHEPARD, ON THE OUTSIDE
TODAY WAS ABOUT SIFTING
THROUGH THE RUBBLE IT WAS
ABOUT PICKING THROUGH THE
PIECES AND CLEANING UP.

TODAY ON "STUDIO B" I SPOKE
WITH A MAN WHOSE 6-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER MADE IT OUT OF
THAT SCHOOL ALIVE.

HE WHITE HOUSE.

BUT WHEN THE TORNADO SIRENS
WENT OFF SCHOOL OFFICIALS
SCRAMBLED TO GET THEM ALL
INTO THE HALLWAY AN AREA
THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE A
SAFE PLACE.

MY GRANDPARENTS LIVE UP
HERE.

WHERE ARE YOU STAYING
AND CASH NEEDS A HUG.
