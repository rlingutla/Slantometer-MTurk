THERE IS A HOLE.

OKAY, NO ONE FIRE IN HERE.

I LAID OVER HIM AND I SOBBED
FOR A MINUTE.

WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE
DEADLY ARSNIL AS THE TWO
BROTHERS TRIED TO MAKE A
DESPERATE ESCAPE.

I AM NOT SURE IF THEY WILL
WORK THEIR WAY ON THE BOAT
AGAIN.

YOU WILL HEAR DUMMY ROUNDS
GOING INTO THE BOAT.

WE FOUND APE HOUSE WHERE THERE
A POOL OF BLOOD OR A CIRCLE OF
BLOOD.

[ APPLAUSE ]
 HOLDING A BANNER THAT READS
WATERTOWN RAIDER PRIDE.

NO.

DUMMY ROUNDS INTO THE BOAT.

FOR ALL 180 WHO SUFFERED.

ALL UNITS DON'T RETURN
FIRE.

ON THE
BACK.

THERE MIGHT BE A FLASH BACK.

EVERYBODY WHO WORKED COUNTER
TERRORISM IS FULLY AWARE OF
THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON
IN THE CAUCUS OF DAGIS STAN
AND CHECHNYA AND THERE IS A
LOT THERE.

INVESTIGATORS READY TO
QUESTION HIM.

WE ARE GETTING A
SECOND-BY-SECOND STORY HOW IT
WENT DOWN FROM THE OFFICERS
WHO LIVED IT NOW THE AUDIO
FROM THE POLICE RADIO.

WE SAW THEM LEAVE, WE KNOW
THERE ARE INVESTIGATORS HERE
AND THEY'RE NOT SAYING MUCH OF
ANYTHING AS THE INVESTIGATION
CONTINUES, SHEPHERD.
