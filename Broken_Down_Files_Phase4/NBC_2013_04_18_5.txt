EVERYBODY IN THE CITY KNOWS
EACH OTHER.

I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES BOSTON
BOSTON, YOU KNOW?

WHEN THOSE ARMS GREW WEARY --
♪ O, SAY DOES THAT STAR
SPANGLED ♪
IN THE CITY WHERE THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION BEGAN.

WHAT TIME DID THEY PUT THE
DEVICES DOWN?

IT'S EVEN MORE SO NOW.

YOUR DAUGHTER CRYSTAL WAS
ALWAYS SMILING.

♪ O SAY CAN YOU SEE
RENDITION OF THE NATIONAL ANTHEM
AT THE BRUINS GAME CAME AS NO
SURPRISE.

A REMINDER THAT THIS ATTACK
REMAINS UNSOLVED.

TOMORROW THE SUN WILL RISE
OVER BOSTON.

I'M SICKENED BY THIS.
