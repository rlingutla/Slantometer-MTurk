NOW THE U.S. MILITARY
IS INVESTIGATING IF
RUSSIA WAS COMPLICIT
IN THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
OR MERELY FAILED TO
STOP IT.

BUT THIS ATTACK,
LIMITED AND APENANTLY
A ONE OFF, WAS NOT
ABOUT REDEFINING
RELATIONS WITH SYRIA
OR RUSSIA, BUT SENDING
A MESSAGE.

TONIGHT A WAR OF WORDS
AS RUSSIA LASHES OUT
AND THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WARNING
ITS PREPARED TO TAKE
FURTHER ACTION.

WE ARE PREPARED TO DO
MORE.

THE SIGNAL IS AS
IMPORTANT AS THE
ACTUAL DAMAGE THAT WAS
DONE.

90 MINUTES LATER, HE'S
BRIEFED IN THIS SECURE
ROOM AT MAR-A-LAGO.

FOR SEVERAL LONG
MINUTES OVERNIGHT,
DOZENS OF AMERICAN
TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILES RAINED DOWN
ON THE SYRIAN MILITARY
AIRFIELD THAT'S BEEN
LINKED TO THIS WEEK'S
DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
ON CIVILIANS IN A
REBEL HELD AREA OF THE
COUNTRY.

THE U.S. TONIGHT
ASSESSING THE DAMAGE
AND MEASURING THE
REACTION AND FALLOUT
TO THE PUNISHING AIR
RAID ON SYRIA.

WE HAVE TWO REPORTS,
FIRST RICHARD ENGEL ON
THE MISSILE ATTACK
IMAGES TONIGHT FROM
RUSSIAN TV OF THE
SYRIAN BASE ATTACK ON
ORDERS FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

THE U.S. MILITARY,
HOWEVER, SAYS THERE
ARE NO INDICATIONS
MOSCOW PLANS TO
RETALIATE.

THE U.S. SAYS IT
AVOIDED TARGETING
CHEMICAL WILLS ON THE
BASE TO PREVENT
DISBURSING TOXINS.

THE U.S. TOMAHAWK
ATTACK IN SYRIA, HOW
WILL ASSAD RESPOND?

BUT THE U.S. MILITARY
LATE TODAY RELEASING
THESE PHOTOS, SHOWING
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO
THE BASE, THE U.S.
SAYS THE SYRIAN REGIME
USED TO LAUNCH THIS
WEEK'S DEADLY CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

I THINK THEY HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
FORCEFULNESS TO THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY.

THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS
IT INFORMED MOSCOW
BEFORE THE STRIKES TO
AVOID RUSSIAN
CASUALTIES ON THE
BASE.

THE WHITE HOUSE
PUSHING BACK ON
REPORTS OF AN IMMINENT
STAFF SHAKEUP THAT
COULD INCLUDE BANNON
AND CHIEF OF STAFF
REINCE PRIEBUS, CRISIS
ON FRONTS IN THE
AFTERMATH OF THE
PRESIDENT'S MOST
SIGNIFICANT MILITARY
MOMENT YET.

THE QUESTION IS, YOU
KNOW, THE OTHER SIDE
GETS A VOTE, WHAT WILL
THE IRANIAN
REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS
DO?

WASHINGTON TODAY,
LAWMAKERS BRIEFED ON
WHAT HAPPENED.

HEZBOLLAH MILITIAS AND
FOR THAT MATTER, ASSAD
HIMSELF.

THE UNITED STATES
TOOK A VERY MEASURED
STEP LAST NIGHT.
