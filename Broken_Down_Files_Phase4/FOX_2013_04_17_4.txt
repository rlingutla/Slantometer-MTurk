AND HE HAS A MESSAGE FOR
THE WOMAN WHO IS TRYING TO
FIND HIM.

IS HE LIVE AT THE CHURCH
WHERE TOMORROW PRESIDENT
OBAMA IS SET TO ATTEND A
PRAYER SERVICE THAT WE WILL
COVER CERTAINLY.

NOW, ANY DOCTOR WILL TELL
YOU IT IS PERFECTLY NATURAL
TO FEEL ON EDGE, ESPECIALLY
AFTER NEWS OF AN ATTACK.

MIKE TOBIN WAS AT THE
HOSPITAL A LITTLE BIT
EARLIER.

IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE I
COULD DO, I COULD TALK TO
HER.

WE ARE TOLD BY FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES THAT A PRESSURE
COOKER WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE
BEEN USED IN AT LEAST ONE
OF THE TWO BOMBS.

THAT IS UNDERSCORING THE
UNDERLYING TENSION THAT
STILL REMAINS HERE IN
BOSTON, NOW TWO DAYS AFTER
THAT BOMBING THERE AT THE
FINISH LINE, BILL.

WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY THAN
FROM LAST NIGHT ON THAT?

INVESTIGATORS HAD ARRESTED
A SUSPECT AND WAS BRINGING
HIM THERE.

THAT BEING SAID, THERE IS A
SOMBER NOTE COMING OUT OF
BOSTON MEDICAL.

AS WE MENTIONED A MOMENT
AGO, THERE WAS AN EXPECTED
STATEMENT FROM THE FBI.

WHAT MORE DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THIS?

BUT THE BOSTON POLICE
DEPARTMENT JUST ABOUT 12
MINUTES AGO ON THEIR
OFFICIAL TWITTER FEED SAID
THAT AT 800 EASTERN TIME
THE FBI WILL MAKE A
STATEMENT ABOUT THE LATEST
EVENTS TODAY.

MEANWHILE, CHECKED OUT ONE
TIME I'M JUST HEARING NOW
FROM OUR PRODUCERS IN NEW
YORK THAT THE STATEMENT
THAT WAS SCHEDULED AT 800
EASTERN TIME IN COPLY SCARE
-- COPLEY SQUARE,
THAT'S NOW BEEN CANCELLED.

WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

YESTERDAY THE MASSACHUSETTS
GOVERNOR DEVOL PATRICK SAID
HE VISITED THE WOMAN
VICTORIA IN THE HOSPITAL
AND SHE SAID THAT TYLER
HELPED CALM HER DOWN, EVEN
SHOWING HER HIS OWN SCAR ON
HIS BODY.

THEY ARE VERY CLEAR.

AGAIN, TRYING TO LINK UP
THE MEN WHO ARE BELIEVED TO
BE RESPONSIBLE WITH IMAGES
FROM BOILSTON STREET, BILL?

FOX NEWS CONFIRMS THAT A
PICTURE, AN IMAGE OF TWO
MEN, TWO PERSONS OF
INTEREST IS NOW BEING
CIRCULATED THROUGH THE LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HERE
IN BOSTON ACROSS THE
COUNTRY LOOKING FOR THE
IDENTITY OF TWO MEN WHO
WERE SEEN NEAR THE SCENE OF
THE BOMBING EXPLOSIONS ON
MONDAY AFTERNOON NEAR THE
FINISH LINE BEHIND ME ON
BOYLSTON STREET.

SOMETIMES THESE EVENTS
TURNED ON THE MINUTE
LITERALLY YET AGAIN THEY
HAVE RECORDING FROM THE
BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT.
