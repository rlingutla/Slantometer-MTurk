SOMETHING REALLY BIG.

BUT HE IS SURROUNDED.

WE KNOW TODAY THEY FOUND A
PRESSURE COOK ERM BOMB AS
WELL AS OTHER PIPE BOMBS IN
THE STREET NEAR THEIR HOME
OF CAMBRIDGE  SO THEY ARE
BEING AS CAUTIOUS AND
CAREFUL AS THEY POSSIBLY
CAN TO KEEP THE NEIGHBORS
IN THIS RESIDENTIAL AREA
SAFE.

WE ARE ON LOCKDOWN.

EVERYONE HAS MOVED FROM
THEIR OTHER SCENES TO THIS
SCENE AND WHAT A SCENE FOR
THE NEIGHBORS OF FRANK LIB
STREET HERE IN WATERTOWN.

THE SECOND SUSPECT IN THE
BOSTON MARATHON BOMBING
THAT HAPPENED MONDAY
AFTERNOON BEFORE 300.

THE POLICE GO OUT, FIND IT,
AT SOME POINT SHOTS BEGIN
TO FIRE.

SECOND SUSPECT
MAY  BEENINCAPACITATED.

THEN SUDDENLY WE HAD A NUMBER OF POLICE
VEHICLES
ALL START TO MAKE THEIR WAY
DOWN THE STREETS OF
WATERTOWN.

THE
STREET.

NOW BELOOK AT THIS AND GET
NEW INFORMATION THAT SHOTS
HAVE BEEN FIRED SOME 20 TO
30 SHOTS FIRED IN WATERTOWN  STREET.

BUT, THE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN
THAT HOUSE ACCORDING TO THE
MOST RECENT REPORTS CALLED
UP THE POLICE AND GOES,
HEY, YOU SEARCHED HERE BUT
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT NOW.

WE HEARD 20 TO 30 SHOTS
FIRED BY EYEWITNESS
ESTIMATES.

THEY ARE BLOCKING OFF THE
AREA AND AMBULANCES GOING
DOWN THE ROAD.

AND AS HE WE RAN ACROSS
RUSSELL TO THE CORNER OF
RUSSELL -- ALL THESE CARS
AND POLICE CARS AND HUMVEES
AND POLICE AND EVERYONE
JUST STARTED TO RUN DOWN TO
FRANKLIN STREET, WHICH IS A
VERY RESIDENTIAL AREA AND
SO WE JUST STARTED FILMING
AND THE GUN -- IT WAS JUST
LIKE A VERY QUICK LIKE
ALMOST 30 SECONDS OF
GUNSHOTS.

THERE IS DOZENS OF POLICE
ON THE SCENE.

AND THEN THAT'S WHEN PAUL
SUTHERLAND HEARD THE SHOTS
SHORTLY AFTER THAT.

WHATEVER IT IS WE WERE
REACHING WHEN ALL THE
GUN --
 JARED, CAN YOU HOLD ON
ONE SECOND PLEASE?

WE WANT TO SHOW THIS IS
WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE 67
FRANKLIN STREET AND THERE
WAS TALK OF SUSPECT
POTENTIALLY HIDING IN A
BOAT AND WE GET A BETTER
LOOK AT IT NOW AS WE PULL
THIS IMAGE IN CLOSER.

AND I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO DEFINE IT BUT YOU COULD
JUST TELL SOMETHING BIG WAS
HAPPENING.
