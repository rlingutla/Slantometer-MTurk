ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS WE
WILL TAKE YOU THERE WHEN IT
STARTS.

AS THEY DID, IMAGINE
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE AROUND THE FINISH
LIBRARY AT THE BOSTON
MARATHON.

BUT WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE,
SHEP, AS YOU LOOK AT THE
SCENE OF THE EXPLOSIONS
AGAIN IS TWO EXPLOSIONS,
TWO PEOPLE DEAD, MORE THAN
100 WOUNDED.

THE LAST RUNNERS FINISHED
TIME IN THE MARATHON IS
LISTED OFFICIALLY AT
257 P.M.
THEN THE SECOND ONE WENT
OFF, JUST DOWN THE STREET
FROM THE FIRST ONE.

THANK YOU.

WELL, WE ARE GETTING A
LOT OF UNCONFIRMED REPORTS.

IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET ON
THE SIX TRAIN IN NEW YORK
CITY WITH A BACKPACK ON
THEY CAN ALL DOO THAT WE
HAVE BEEN THANKFUL ALL
THESE YEARS SINCE THE
TERRORIST ATTACK ON OUR
NATION BEEN THANKFUL IT
HASN'T HAPPENED.

OF COURSE, THE COMMON THEME
FROM CITY HALLS IS THAT WE
ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

NOT JUST FOR SAFETY SAKE
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ENSURE
THAT ALL OF THE VICTIMS ARE
SAFE, BUT THEY WANT TO TALK
TO PEOPLE THAT WERE
WITNESSES.

DO?

IT'S QUIETED DOWN
CONSIDERABLY.

ALL OF THE PIECE GOES
SOMEWHERE.

IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE
AROUND AT ALL.

CRYSTAL, WHAT DO WE KNOW,
IF ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE
POSSIBLE VICTIMS HERE?

RUN ARERS DOWN TO MY LEFT.

AND THE POLICE RUSHING US
OUT OF THE LIBRARY BECAUSE
THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE
A DEVICE INSIDE THE
LIBRARY.

THE FINISH LINE WAS REALLY
PACKED WITH FAMILY MEMBERS
KIDS, PEOPLE WAITING FOR
THEIR LOVED ONES TO CROSS
THE FINISH LINE.

I WANT THAT ROAD --

WE'RE STILL WAITING ON
YACHT DATE FROM
INVESTIGATION AS TO MORE
INFORMATION.

AND WE'LL HAVE THAT FOR YOU
IN JUST A MOMENT.
