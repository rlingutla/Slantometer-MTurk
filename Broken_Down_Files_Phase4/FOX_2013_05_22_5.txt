THERE IS A LOT OF
FAMILIES THANKING YOU FOR
KEEPING THEIR CHILDREN
ALIVE TODAY.

SANDY TOLD US SHE
ACTUALLY HAD TO BE DRAGGED
OUT BY HER FEET BY
PARAMEDICS.

1 DAYS INTO THIS.

EXTRAORDINARY.

SHE LIVES A COUPLE MILES
DOWN FOURTH STREET HERE IN
THIS PATH WE ARE STANDING
IN GOT HER HOUSE RIGHT
MORNING BOARDING UP.

YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HEARD
MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS SHEP, POWER
OF MANY ATOMIC BOMBS AND
BEHIND ME IS A CLEAR
EXAMPLE OF THIS.

AND AS YOU LOOK ALONG THAT
STRAIGHT LINE.

EVERYBODY HAD TO GET OUT.

MANY KILLED IN THE
DESTRUCTION OF PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY.

THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE THE
SEVEN CHILDREN DIED.

HUNDREDS MORE ARE HURT.

THOSE ORANGE X'S.

M'S STOOD FOR MISSING.

AND THEN AS WE HEARD IT
APPROACHING, BECAUSE YOU
COULD HEAR IT IT WAS LIKE
10 FREIGHT TRAINS.

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, YOU
KNOW BECAUSE YOU ARE SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR
SAFETY.

AND THE PILES WERE STILL
OVERWHELMING.

RIGHT NOW WE ARE TRYING
TO GET EVERYBODY, YOU KNOW
GET WOOD ON PEOPLE'S HOUSES
GET THEM SCREWED IN AND
GETS THE TARPS ON.

AND THEY SAY WE HAVE
REBUILT BEFORE AND WE'RE
GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

MOORE, OKLAHOMA O, WHERE
ONE LOCAL BUSINESS THAT
COULD HELP PEOPLE GET AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS
DEVASTATION WILL REOPEN
THIS WEEK.

AS IT TURNED OUT, IT WAS AN
AWFUL SCENE THERE.
