SHE BELIEVES IT WAS BECAUSE HER
SCHOOL WAS CONSTRUCTED
DIFFERENTLY.

THE FASTEST WINDS EVER RECORDED
INSIDE A TORNADO, TOPPED 300
MILES PER HOUR.

WHAT IS THAT?

BOTH RIGHT HERE ON THIS SAME
SPOT.

UNLIKE PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY,
MORE TRADITIONAL WITH A LONG
LINE OF CLASSROOMS UNDER ONE
ROOF.

AND THIS LITTLE GIRL, WHO SAID
SHE JUST WOULDN'T LET GO OF THAT
DESK.

HE SHOWS US HOW HE OPENED THAT
DOOR AND THIS IS WHAT HE SAW
WHEN HE WALKED OUT.

TAKING US DOWN INTO HIS CONCRETE
STORM SHELTER WHERE THEY WERE
HUDDLED.

AND NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU A
REUNION PICTURE, A LITTLE BOY,
AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN HIS FACE,
REUNITED WITH THE SMALLEST
MEMBER OF HIS FAMILY, HIS DOG
RIPPY.

AND TONIGHT, WE ALSO HAVE PHOTOS
COMING IN, A TRUE-GRIT MOMENT,
OKLAHOMA STYLE.

HOME AFTER HOME OBLITERATED
HERE.

TEACHER THINKING ABOUT ALL THOSE
OTHER TEACHERS AT THE OTHER
SCHOOL.

THE TORNADO WENT IN AND I WAS
SO AFRAID THAT I WAS HANGING ON
TO ONE OF THE DESKS.

LEARNED THAT MONSTROUS TORNADO
WAS IN SOME PLACES EVEN STRONGER
AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN FIRST
THOUGHT, A PROMISE FROM
AUTHORITIES HERE.

THE TORNADO.

SAID THIS IS NOT A DRILL.

AT THE CENTER OF THOSE BUILDINGS
AN OPENING TO THE OUTDOORS.

I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE OTHER
-- I COULDN'T LEAVE THE OTHER
KIDS.

I WISHED I COULD HAVE SPLIT
MYSELF INTO TWO AND STAYED THERE
AND TRIED TO HELP OUT SOME OF
THOSE OTHER KIDS, BECAUSE I CAN
IMAGINE HOW THEY WERE FEELING AT
THAT TIME.

JORDAN AND HER WONDERFUL
FAMILY.
