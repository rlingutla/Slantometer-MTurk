OKLAHOMA."

REPORTER FOR KFOR TV'S CHOPPER 4
WATCHED THE HORROR UNFOLD.

IT LOOKS LIKE A WAR ZONE AND
IT WAS, IN FACT, A FOG OF WAR.

WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE PLANS.

BUT THE OTHER, AT LEAST SEVEN
FATALITIES THAT WE KNOW OF,
AND THIS WAS A WEEK THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED WITH
CELEBRATION.

WE TALK ABOUT THE FOG OF WAR IN
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

I REMEMBER THE LITTLE BOY
SAYING I LOVE YOU, MISS
CROSSWHITE.

AND IT'S JUST AS DEVASTATED AS
PLAZA TOWERS.

THEIR PARENTS HAD PICKED THEM UP
JUST BEFORE THE SCHOOL WENT ON
LOCKDOWN MONDAY, BUT THE
MAJORITY STAYED INSIDE AS THEY
PRACTICED IN DRILLS MANY TIMES.

WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
BLAST, CERTAINLY THAT IS AN
AMAZING ANALOGY.

I KNOW CERTAINLY YESTERDAY
RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS WITH
PEOPLE, WHY DON'T SCHOOLS
HAVE STORM SHELTERS?

THEY'RE NOT SURE.

THE TWISTER'S DEVASTATING PATH
17 MILES LONG.

THIS SCHOOL IS BASICALLY GONE.

PEOPLE'S HOMES.

WHY AREN'T THERE MORE SAFE
HOUSES WITHIN HOUSES ACROSS THIS
REGION GIVEN THE WEATHER HERE?

TOMORROW WAS SUPERKIDS DAY AT
THE SCHOOL.

I SAID, OKAY, I'LL GET THEM IN.

FEMA SAYS IT'S LOOKING INTO WHAT
CAUSED THE DELAY.

THERE WAS THAT DIRE FIRST REPORT
THAT UPWARDS OF 75 STUDENTS AND
FACULTY MIGHT BE TRAPPED, MIGHT
BE UNACCOUNTED FOR.
