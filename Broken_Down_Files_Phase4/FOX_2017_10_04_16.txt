COMING OUT OF A WINDOW.

FOR THOSE JOINING US ON FOX
TELEVISION STATIONS, HE GAVE AN
INVITATION TO THOSE IN THE
IF YOU'RE EVER IN WASHINGTON
D.C., COME SEE ME AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.

THE PRESIDENT THIS AFTERNOON IS
IN LAS VEGAS WHERE HE'S ABOUT TO
MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS.

THIS IS WHERE WE DO ALL THE
OPERATIONAL DECISIONS IN THE
AREA.

I KNOW BECAUSE I READ THE MAIL
AND STUFF THAT THERE'S A LOT OF
CONSERVATIVES CONCERNED THAT HE
MIGHT BECOME MORE PRO GUN
CONTROL IN THE DAYS AHEAD.

IT'S A LITTLE GLITCHY.

INTERVENTION WHILE OUR FOX
TELEVISION STATIONS JOIN US.

KILLER'S GIRLFRIEND RETURNS TO
THE UNITED STATES.

HE WENT ON THE SAY THAT HE
DID NOT SELL STEPHEN PADDOCK ANY
AMMUNITION OR ANY OF THOSE BUMP
STOCKS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALL
DAY LONG.

THE SAME IN AMBULANCES AS THEY
WERE LOADING PEOPLE IN
AMBULANCES TO TAKE THEM TO
HOSPITALS FROM THE SHOOTING
SCENE.

THAT'S WHAT DANLEY'S SISTER TOLD
A TV SISTER IN AUSTRALIA.

THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR.

JOHN ROBERTS FOLLOWING ALONG
WITH THE PRESIDENT OUT IN
LAS VEGAS TODAY.

 THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

ON BEHALF OF THE GRATEFUL
NATION, MELANIA AND I THANK EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU IN LAW
ENFORCEMENT IN THE DEPTHS OF

FIRST RESPONDERS.

HE'S DONE SO.

YOU ON THAT.
