THANK GOD WE HAD A SHELTER.

AND HE WAS THE LAST ONE TO BE
REUNITED WITH A FAMILY MEMBER,
SO WE'VE GOT HIM.

ALSO AT THIS POINT I'M SEEING
THE WARREN THEATER, NOW WE'RE
SEEING SOME OF THE WALLS UP, BUT
JUST PEOPLE WALKING THE STREETS.

SO THAT'S ALL -- IT DIDN'T
MATTER.

YOU SEE PEOPLE JUST SITTING
AROUND WITH THEIR STUFF THAT'S
DESTROYED.

HE'S MY SON.

BUT SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AT THE
DAMAGE AND YOU SEE IT AND IT
REMINDS YOU OF ANOTHER STORM AND
THIS STORM IS REMINDING US A LOT
OF JOPLIN AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD
THING.

THEY RANGE, WE HAVE TEN IN
CRITICAL CONDITION RIGHT NOW.

HOPEFULLY WE DIDN'T LOSE ANY
LIVES HERE.

CARS TOSSED.

LOCAL TELEVISION HELICOPTER
CATCHING THE PICTURES, CATCHING
THIS TORNADO, RANKED A
PRELIMINARY EF-4 HELP YOU CAN
SEE THE FLASHES OF THE POWER
LINES AND TRANSFORMERS BEING
RIPPED APART.

HE WAS DIRECTLY IN THE TORNADO.

WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THERE,
HOURS AGO, WAS THE SCHOOL
GYMNASIUM.

THE WATER IS SPOUTING OUT OF THE
PLUMING AND THEY'RE STILL
DIGGING THROUGH TRYING TO FIND
THINGS BEFORE THE SUN SETS.

SO SHE SAID THAT THEY HAD TO
MOVE, SO THEY WENT INTO AN
INTERIOR CLOSET.

ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT, BUD?

STARTED HEADING IN.

SHINGLES AND PIECES OF SHEET
ROOT AND WOOD IN OUR YARD AND
ALL ACROSS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

GOT HOME FAST AS POSSIBLE, GOT
OUR DOGS, AND GOT INTO THE
SHELTER, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
LATER, WE WERE HIT.

THAT PUTS IT DEFINITELY IN THAT
EF-4 AND MAYBE EVEN HIGHER
CATEGORY, THE STORM THAT'S
CAPABLE OF TAKING A FOUNDATION
AND CLEARING IT OF DEBRIS, AS
THE STORM LEAVES THE AREA.
