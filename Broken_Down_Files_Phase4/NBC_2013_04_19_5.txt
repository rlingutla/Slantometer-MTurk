AND THE TECHNOLOGY TO PULL IT
TOGETHER.

THEY HEARD HE WAS IN CUSTODY AND
FOLKS ARE OBVIOUSLY JOYOUS.

EVEN THOUGH, AS KERRY AND I AND
PETE WILLIAMS AND I HAVE BEEN
THEORIZING IT'S LIKELY, KNOWING
HOW THESE GUYS WORK, THEY WILL
NOT USE LIGHT FOR THE TAKEDOWN
ITSELF.

THIS HAS GONE IN ALL DIRECTIONS
ALREADY TODAY.

PEOPLE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN NOT GIVEN A MIRANDA
WARNING.

THESE FOLKS HAVE HAD A REALLY
TOUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

NOT KNOWN IF THEY ARE FRESH
WOUNDS FROM TONIGHT'S EXCHANGE
OF FIRE.

DAN, YOU'RE WATCHING FROM
THERE.

PEOPLE ARE SO ANXIOUS TO EXPRESS
THEIR THANKS.

WE DON'T KNOW PRECISELY HIS
CONDITION.

IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCENARIO
INVOLVING UMAR ABDEL MUTALLAB,
THE SO-CALLED CHRISTMAS DAY
BOMBER, SIMILAR SITUATION.

THIS WAS VISITED UPON THEM AFTER
THEY WITNESSED THE HORRIBLE
BOMBING AT THE FINISH LINE OF
THE BOSTON MARATHON.

VARIOUS SIZES AND SHAPES OF
VEHICLES.

IN MY VIEW, THEY WILL WANT TO
KNOW, AGAIN, ANY WEAPONS OUT
THERE.

YOU HEAR THESE MULTIPLE REPORTS.

THE OTHER LESSON IS ABOUT LAW
ENFORCEMENT, TRAILS PEOPLE LEAVE
BEHIND.

WE SAW HOUSE-TO-HOUSE SEARCHES
TAKING PLACE WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT IN MILITARY DRESS.

THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS KID'S
COMPUTER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

IT WILL BE A KIND OF GAUNTLET.

SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS CONFIRMED HE'S ALIVE,
IN CUSTODY.
