50 MORE FACE SERIOUS
SURGERIES AND WHILE SO
MANY LIVES WERE SAVED,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO
REMEMBER TONIGHT MANY
ARE STILL FIGHTING FOR
THEIR LIVES.

THE STAGE 400 YARDS
FROM THE HOTEL WITH
THE CROWD GATHERED IN
FRONT.

IN THIS COUNTRY WE
HAVE WITNESSED EVENTS
LIKE THESE FAR TOO
OFTEN, BUT IT ALL
SEEMS THAT THE WORST
OF TYPES OFTEN BRING
OUT THE BEST IN
HUMANITY.

I KNEW THEY CAME
FROM THE HOTEL.

DURING THAT LOCKDOWN,
OUR TEAM WAS TOLD TO
STAY IN THE HOTEL ROOM
FOR TEN HOURS.

WE PUT GURNEYS
OUTSIDE.

TWO MANHATTAN BEACH,
CALIFORNIA, RESIDENTS
DIED IN THE MASSACRE,
INCLUDING RACHEL
PARKER, A LONG TIME
RECORDS TECHNICIAN FOR
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

I HAD HIM DOWN AND
I WAS ON TOP OF HIM.

IT WAS EXACTLY A
STAMPEDE.

MY VIEW IS THEY
HAVE NO PLACE IN OUR
SOCIETY.

SECRETARY LISA ROMERO
AND OFFICE MANAGER
SUSAN SMITH ALSO AMONG
THE VICTIMS.

THEY ARE WEAPONS OF
LAW.

INVESTIGATORS SAY IN
THE PAST FEW WEEKS HE
GAMBLED HEAVILY AT LAS
VEGAS HOTELS AND
CASINOS, PLACING TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS IN BETS.

WHAT WOULD I DO?

NEVADA, THERE'S NO
LIMIT ON HOW MUCH
AMMUNITION YOU CAN BUY
AND SHOOTING ONE
DOESN'T REQUIRE MUCH
SKILL.

ROBBINS ATTENDED THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA
LAS VEGAS.

THERE'S MUCH MORE
STILL AHEAD AS WE
CONTINUE TONIGHT FROM
LAS VEGAS INCLUDING
THE SHOOTER'S GUNS.

AT THIS POINT I CAN
BARELY BREATHE.

HOW WOULD I REACT?

MASS MURDER ON A
AT LEAST TWO NEVADA
GUN DEALERSHIPS SAY
THE SUSPECT LEGALLY
PURCHASED WEAPONS
THERE, BUT WHAT'S NOT
CLEAR IS HOW HE GOT
HIS HANDS ON SO MANY
POWERFUL WEAPONS OF
WAR.
