THEN THERE ARE THOSE STILL
FIGHTING TO SURVIVE.

SAY THERE ARE NO CREDIBLE
THREATS, BUT THE BOSTON BOMBING
STRIPPED AWAY ANOTHER LAYER OF
INNOCENCE TO EVERYDAY AMERICAN
LIFE.

FEDERAL AGENTS ARE WAITING TO
QUESTION HIM.

THEIR SONS ARE NOT TERRORISTS
AND HAVE BEEN FRAMED BY THE FBI.

TEAMS AND A POLICE HELICOPTER
TAKE UP POSITIONS AROUND AND
ABOVE THE BOAT.

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF
WATERTOWN WHERE THIS ALL ENDED
IS ONLY ABOUT 60 OFFICERS STRONG
AND OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, IT
WAS TESTED IN WAYS THAT EVEN THE
BIGGEST POLICE FORCES WILL
RARELY OR EVER EXPERIENCE.

CHIEF DEVOE SAYS HE GETS
CHOKED UP WHEN HE THINKS ABOUT
THE CHEERS AND THANKS HIS MEN
AND WOMEN GOT FROM THE CROWDS OF
GRATEFUL RESIDENTS LAST NIGHT
FOR THEIR JOB WELL DONE.

RICH AND AND YVONNE BROUGHT
2-YEAR-OLD DYLAN WITH A MIXTURE
OF RELIEF AND RESERVATION.

WEREN'T JUST RED SOX FANS, THEY
WERE BOSTON FANS.

WELL, FOR A LOUSY SITUATION,
I JUST THANK MY LUCKY STARS
THEY'RE ALIVE, SO IT'S A GREAT
DAY.

IF SO, WHY WEREN'T THEY ATTACK
ING RUSSIAN TARGETS?

ON THE ICONIC GOLD HELMETS OF
NOTRE DAME'S FOOTBALL TEAM
DURING HIS SPRING GAME.

FOR 8-YEAR-OLD MARTIN RICHARD,
FOR 29-YEAR-OLD KRIS.

DEVAL PATRICK DOES WHAT NO
GOVERNOR IN MODERN U.S. HISTORY
HAS EVER DONE.

IT CERTAINLY IS LESTER AND
YOU KNOW HOW BOSTON
LOVES ITS TRADITIONS FROM THE
MARATHON TO THE SWAN BOATS TO
THE SONGS THEY SING AT FENWAY
PARK.

WE DO NOT HAVE AN
APPREHENSION OF OUR SUSPECT THIS
AFTERNOON, BUT WE WILL HAVE ONE.

HE LOOKS INSIDE JUST UNDER
THE TARP, SEES A SMALL POOL OF
BLOOD AT THAT POINT.

HIS GOAL WAS ALWAYS TO BECOME A
POLICE OFFICER.

AN OFFICIAL TELLS US AFTERWARDS
THAT SO FAR, THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE OF FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT,
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING.

GRAD STUDENT LINGZI LU, AND SEAN
