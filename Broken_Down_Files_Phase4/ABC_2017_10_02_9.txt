WE ARE STILL IN A
FACT-FINDING MISSION.

YOU WILL HEAR FROM HIS FAMILY,
RIGHT HERE THIS EVENING.

IN THE HEART OF THE LAS VEGAS
STRIP.

CAN WE GET IN?

REMARKABLY TODAY, HIS FAMILY
SAID THERE WERE NO SIGNS THAT
ANY OF THIS WAS COMING.

THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE.

AND SOME OF THE DOCTORS WE
LEARNED HAD JUST RECEIVED SOME
TRAINING THAT PROVED CRITICAL IN
THEIR RESPONSE HERE?

BUT HE DID DESCRIBE HIS BROTHER
AS A MULTIMILLIONAIRE, WHO
PLAYED HIGH STAKES POKER, BUT
EVEN THERE, NO SIGNS YET TONIGHT
OF ANY FINANCIAL PROBLEMS?

1008 P.M., 22,000 COUNTRY MUSIC
FANS PACKED IN, ENJOYING THE
ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL.

AND WE ARE HERE AT THE SCENE OF
THE WORST MASS SHOOTING IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.

DOWN ON CONCERT-GOERS LIKE HELL
FIRE, LAS VEGAS S.W.A.T.

THE SHERIFF OF THE LAS VEGAS
POLICE DEPARTMENT TELLS US
PEOPLE, HOTEL GUESTS LET THEM
KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THIS WAS
HAPPENING AND THEY WERE ABLE TO
PINPOINT THE SUITE WHERE THE
SHOOTER WAS STAYING.

IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME, BUT WE
ARE BEGINNING TO SEE MANY OF THE
FACES HERE THIS EVENING, THE
LOVED ONES LOST.

TEAMS MOVE
IN, SURROUNDING THE SUSPECT'S
HOTEL DOOR.

THE SHERIFF HERE, JOSEPH
LOMBARDO, REVEALING A SHORT TIME
AGO THE DEATH TOLL IS NOW UP TO
59.

THIS EVENING, INVESTIGATORS ON
THE SCENE OF THE GUNMAN'S HOME.

LET'S GO!

AND POLICE STILL POURING OVER
THIS CRIME SCENE.

THERE'S A MASS SHOOTING!
