INCREASED SECURITY AT
HOTELS, PROMINENT LOANINGS,
THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY
SYSTEM.

SPECTATORS AND THOSE WHO
HAD ALREADY COMPLETED THE
RACE AND WERE SIMPLY
WAITING FOR FRIENDS OR
RELATIVES TO COME IN.

IT WAS PEOPLE UP AGAINST
FENCES.

BUT, AGAIN, YOU HAVE THE
SENSE THAT PEOPLE WERE
SOMEWHAT BLINDSIDED BY WHAT
HAPPENED IN BOSTON TODAY
CATHERINE.

AND SO ALL OF A SUDDEN
PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AT US.

EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT
AGENCY INVOLVED RIGHT NOW.

CERTAINLY VERY SAD
SITUATION HERE HISTORIC
EVENT IN BOSTON.

WE KNEW IT WASN'T RIGHT.

YOU KNOW, IT WAS OUR
SENSE IN WATCHING THIS THAT
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
TRYING TO RISE ABOVE AND
GIVE A HAND THERE AT THE
TIME.

WE HAVE BEEN SEEING VIDEO
OF THE EXPLOSION GIVING US
TIME LINE HOW THIS WENT
DOWN.

HE WAS A QUARTER MILE
BEHIND THE FINISH LINE,
FINISHING HIMSELF WHEN THE
EXPLOSION OCCURRED BUT HE
NEVER HEARD THE EXPLOSION.

NEW YORK CITY'S TIMES
SQUARE.

BUT I'M NOT SURE IT'S
COMPLETELY RELEVANT AT THE
MOMENT ANYWAY.

ONCE YOU GET TO THE LOWER
END OF INJURIES, NOT EVERY
ONE ACCOUNTED BY SOME
ORGANIZATION.

WERE I TELLING YOU ABOUT IT
NOW, AND EXPLAINING TO YOU
THAT THERE WERE MASS
CASUALTIES AND THE SCENE
WAS CHAOTIC WOULD NOT HAVE
NEARLY THE IMPACT ON THE
COLLECTIVE PSYCHE THAT THIS
VIDEO DOES.

WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING
FIRST IS LOOKING AT THE
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES.

THE STREETS ARE EXPECTED TO
BE COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF.

AND WE ARE EXPECTING THAT
SHOULD BEGIN SHORTLY.

THAT'S NOT A MATTER OF
SPECULATION.

THIS WAS THE FOUR HOUR MARK
OF THE MARATHON.
