WE WERE COMING DOWN RUSSELL
AVE.
AND WE WERE JUST ON THE
CORNER ACROSS FROM FRAN
LYNN STREET AND WE JUST
HEARD THIS RAPID GUNFIRE
THAT STAND SOUNDED LIKE
FIREWORKS.

AT LEAST MORE THAN A DOZEN
POLICE CARS.

COULD HAVE BEEN EXPLOSIVE
OR COULD HAVE BEEN A
GUNSHOT.

WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE
AMBULANCE MOVE YET.

COULD BE ON HIS BODY
ANYWHERE.

STAND BY IF YOU WOULD.

YOU KNOW, WE FELT SAFE AND
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE
HEAR ALL THIS GUNSHOT IN
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

SWAT TEAM AS WELL.

AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT
WAS.

CAN YOU TELL BY WANDERING
ABOUT THIS CITY.

A LOT OF ACTIVITY OUT
THERE.

JARED HOLBROOK, AGAIN
COULD YOU GIVE US THE EXACT
LOCATION OF THE HOUSE WHERE
AUTHORITIES ARE RIGHT NOW?

WE ARE WATCHING THIS HERE
UNFOLD 67 FRANKLIN STREET.

THE -- AND SHE SAID THAT
THERE WERE BLOODY CLOTHES
THERE AS WELL.

THERE IS NO LIGHT ON THE
AREA.

WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM
POLICE AS THEY MOVE IN WITH
THAT ROBOT.

WE STAYED IN ALL DAY.

I'M 50 TO 100 YARDS AWAY.
