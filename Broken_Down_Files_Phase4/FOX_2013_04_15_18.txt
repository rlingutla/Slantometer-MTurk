WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM
BOSTON THEY WANT TO NOW GO
THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE
MARATHON ROUTE 26.2 MILES
TO CHECK OUT EVERY SINGLE
PACKAGE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT
ON THE SECRETS AROUND
BOSTON.

TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE
TALKING ABOUT THIS DATE, IT
IS JUST IN A VACUUM WITHOUT
HISTORICAL CONTEXT IS
REALLY TO MISS THE FACTS
HERE.

NOT JUST OVER THIS
INVESTIGATION THE WHITE
HOUSE COULD BE A TARGET.

UNITS STAY OFF THE AIR.

WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THE
15-BLOCK AREA AROUND COP
COP-LEY PLACE.

AND NOW BOSTON POLICE,
FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND STATE
OFFICIALS, THEY ARE
ACTUALLY INSPECTING THOSE
PACKAGES TO MAKE SURE THEY
ARE NOT SUSPICIOUS.

BOTH BLASTS CAME JUST
BEFORE 300 BOSTON TIME.

AND, SHEPARD THE NEW YORK
CITY MARATHON HAPPENED TO
HAVE BEEN CANCELLED LAST
NOVEMBER BECAUSE OF
HURRICANE SANDY.

THERE ARE SO MANY STORIES
JUST LIKE, THIS SHEPARD
TONIGHT HERE IN BOSTON.

THERE ARE THREE BASIC
QUESTIONS HERE.

I DON'T KNOW IF I DID
THAT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE AN
OUT-OF-BODY EXPERIENCE.

FOR THE BOSTON MARATHON
THEY HAD PREPARED WELL WITH
THE HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY
MANAGERS.

I SAW HIM WITH ONE CHILD
UNDER EACH ARM.

IN FACT, CITIES WORLDWIDE
ARE ON ALERT.

YEAH.

YES WE'RE AT OUR HOTEL
IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW.

BOSTON IS A TOUGH AND
RESILIENT TOWN.

THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT GET
SOME DISCREPANCY 98 AND
SEEING UP TO 115,000.

I'M EXTREMELY CONFIDENT
THAT BOSTONIANS WILL PULL
TOGETHER, TAKE CARE OF EACH
OTHER, AND MOVE FORWARD AS
ONE PROUD CITY AND AS THEY
DO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL
BE WITH THEM EVERY SINGLE
STEP OF THE WAY.

THAT IS WHY WE WERE TOLD AT
THE TIME THAT CELL PHONE
TRAFFIC HAD BEEN SHUTDOWN.
