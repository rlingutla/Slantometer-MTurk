I COULD BE CONVINCED THAT WE
HAVE SEEN MORE ACTIVITY.

HE WAS BADLY HURT, TAKEN TO THE
HOSPITAL, GIVEN TREATMENT.

YOU WILL HEAR EVERY ENTERING AND
EXITING VEHICLE APPLAUDED NOW
AND HERE IS MY PREDICTION COMING
TRUE.

WHAT'S GOING TO START HAPPENING
THERE IN WATERTOWN, AND YOU CAN
TELL THIS ALREADY, YOU SAW ONE
TACTICAL OFFICER COME OUT TOWARD
THE WAITING CROWD.

HE HAS INFORMATION WE NEED.

HE'S IN CUSTODY.

OUTSTANDING.

WE BELIEVE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

WE ARE HEART BROKEN BY THE LOSS
OF OUR WONDERFUL AND CARING SON
AND BROTHER, SEAN COLLIER.

FACING ANOTHER TOUGH NIGHT.

THIS KIND OF THING WILL HA.

EVERYBODY IS STANDING DOWN,
SATISFIED.

THERE IS A PARADE OF TRAFFIC
HAPPENING NOW.

IF THEY SHOT RIGHT AT THE BOAT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED THE
BOAT INTO SWISS CHEESE.

EXCELLENT.

SUSPECT HAS BEEN APPREHENDED.

842 ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

THESE ARE JUST CITIZENS OF A
TOWN IN EASTERN MASS.

EMPTIED THE HOUSE OF OCCUPANTS
AND WENT IN TO SEARCH IT.

WHAT'S THE FIRST SET OF OFFICIAL
EYEBALLS THAT WILL SIT DOWN
ACROSS FROM OR RIDE WITH THIS
SUSPECT.
