WE HAD TWO OR THREE SIGHTINGS
OF TORNADOES BUT SO FAR WE ARE
NOT SEEING THAT WE SEE ANYTHING
OF ANY REAL TORNADO DAMAGE.

IN FACT SOME OF THE EARLY
REPORTS FROM THE WEATHER
SPOTTERS ON THE GROUND IS THAT
IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA ALONE
14 DIFFERENT TORNADOES HAVE
BEEN GENERATED IN THE LAST FOUR
HOURS OR SO.

YOU CAN SEAT HOOK THERE CLEARLY
AND THEN THE OTHER IS REALLY
MOVING OUT OF THE AREA IN
NORTHWESTERN CREEK COUNTY.

TORNADOES TOUCHING DOWN IN
KANSAS AND OKLAHOMA AND THE
SYSTEM NOW COOKING UP.

THE DYERNAL HEATING.

CURRENTLY I'M OUTSIDE KIND OF
LOOKING AT THE DAMAGES.

AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW
EVERYONE IS TRYING TO RECOVER.

YES MA'AM.

IT DOES HELP.

THE DOUGHNUT HOLE THAT YOU SAW
RIGHT THERE.

YES, I AM.

AND ALSO HAVING TO TAKE THE
SPOTTERS AND CHASERS OUT THERE
HAVING TO TAKE WHAT THEY ARE
SAYING ALSO TO HEART BECAUSE
THE RADAR MAY BE SAYING ONE
THING AND WHAT IS ON THE GROUND
MAY BE SAYING ANOTHER THING.

WE FORECAST THAT WICHITA AND
KANSAS CITY MIGHT BE TOUCHED BY
THIS AND IN FACT THAT HAS
HAPPENED TODAY WITH YOUR CITY.

YOU CAN SEE IT COMING AND IN
THE SKY.

WE ARE SENDING CORRESPONDENTS
INTO THE HEART OF THIS.

BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE HOW LONG
THIS SITS ON THE GROUND AND
THEN JUST -- THIS IS WHAT CASEY
WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE.

I-40 AND THEN AFTER THAT MOVE
TO THE EAST AND PULL UP CITIES
THERE FOR YOU.

WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THAT
TORNADO IS AT.

AGAIN, JUST EAST AND NORTHEAST
OF DALE.

WE ARE COVERING COVERING THIS
BREAKING NEWS HAPPENING IN THE
MID SECTION OF THE COUNTRY.
