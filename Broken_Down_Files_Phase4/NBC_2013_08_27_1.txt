SHE LED US DOWN UNMARKED ROADS
TO A PLACE WE COULD NOT HAVE
FOUND BY OURSELVES, INTO HER
SMALL SHELTER.

AS THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
AMPS UP THE RHETORIC FOR
POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
SYRIA, A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE
FOCUSED ON OTHER THINGS, LIKE
THE DWINDLING DAYS OF SUMMER.

CELEBRATE THE TROOPS, MANY WORRY
ABOUT WHAT MIGHT LIE AHEAD.

HE SAYS "MY STOMACH FEELS
FUNNY."

BUT TODAY THE ARAB LEAGUE, LED
BY THE SAUDIS DENOUNCED THE
ASSAD GOVERNMENT FOR THE
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

WE GET INVOLVED IN SO MANY
PLACES WE REALLY DON'T BELONG.

I PRAY FOR THOSE GUYS EVERY
NIGHT.

TO ME IT SHOULD BE WITH THE
ALLIES, OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO
GET INVOLVED WITH SOMETHING WE
DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN.

NOW, WHAT TO DO WITH SYRIA,
THAT'S THE QUESTION NOBODY HAS
THE ANSWER.

ZAATARI CAMP, A DOCTOR LEADS US
TO ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE
HERE.

THE MILITARY SIGNALS ITS FORCES
ARE IN PLACE AND ABLE TO STRIKE
SYRIA AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE
SHOULD THE PRESIDENT ISSUE THE
ORDER.

AND FROM THE PENTAGON, WORD THAT
U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE IN PLACE AND
READY TO LAUNCH WHEN THE ORDER
IS GIVEN.

THE ADMINISTRATION WILL GIVE A
CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE
ASSESSMENT TO CONGRESS THIS WEEK
AND MAKE A DECLASSIFIED VERSION
PUBLIC.

PUTIN INTERRUPTED A MEETING TO
TAKE A CALL FROM THE BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER.

CHEMICAL WEAPONS?

PUTIN IS STILL BLOCKING U.N.
ACTION.

THE U.S. MILITARY PLAN IS NOT TO
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIVIL
WAR AND TRY TO TOPPLE ASSAD.

ON THE DIPLOMATIC SIDE,
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR AN
ATTACK IS GROWING.

WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SYRIA ARE
APPALLING SCENES OF DEATH AND
SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY THE ASSAD
REGIME.

THEY ARE PATRIOTIC, BUT THEY ARE
ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ANY FUTURE
MILITARY CONFLICT.
