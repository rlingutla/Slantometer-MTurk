SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, YOU
SEE THE SAME FINGERPRINT,
USUALLY LEADS YOU TO THE SAME
CONCLUSION.

BUT THERE'S OTHER ATTACKS MOSTLY
IN ASIA AND SEEM TO THINK THE
RANSOM GAINED IN THE ATTACKS,
$100,000 SO FAR.

WE'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS THAT KIM
JONG-UN'S REGIME HAD A WHOLE
ARMY OF CROOKS TALKING IN A
VARIETY OF WAYS, A VARIETY OF
TARGETS.

IT'S IN THE EARLY DAYS AND CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

THE THING ABOUT CYBER IS,
THERE'S NO DISTANT ISSUE HERE.

CYBER ATTACK THAT HIT HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF COMPUTERS IN 150
COUNTRIES LAST WEEK MAY BE
CONNECTED TO NORTH KOREA.

300,000 TARGETS WORLDWIDE.

RUSHERS SAY THE WANNA CRY
SOFTWARE CONTAINED CODE USED IN
OTHER HACK ATTACKS LINKED TO THE
NORTH KOREANS.

30,000 INSTITUTIONS WERE
TARGETED.

IS THIS A WAY TO GENERATE
REVENUE TO GENERATE BILLIONS IN
RANSOM OR IS IT A SHOT ACROSS
THE BOW?

THAT INCLUDES THE CYBER ATTACK
TO SONY IN 2014.

AND THEN THERE'S THE HACKERS AND
THEN THE USERS LIKE YOU AND ME
THAT SHOULD PUT UP MORE
DEFENSES.

KIM JONG-UN SAYS THE WEAPON IS
ABLE TO HIT THE UNITED STATES
MAINLAND.

THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR FOUR
DAYS.

ON CYBER, THEY'RE INSIDE THE
GATE.

WHY IS THIS NOT?

GREG?

IS IT A MONEY-MAKING ENTERPRISE
OR MORE?

COULD THE ROGUE NATION HAVE THE
POWER TO CRIPPLE COMPUTERS
AROUND THE GLOBE?

NEW CLUES IN THE WORLDWIDE HACK
ATTACK POINTING TO NORTH KOREA.
