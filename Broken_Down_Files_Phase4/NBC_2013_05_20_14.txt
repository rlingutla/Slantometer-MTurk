WITH THE HOUSES WHERE I'M
STANDING THERE'S NOTHING.

AS MANY NOW AS 30 SCHOOL
CHILDREN UNACCOUNTED FOR AND MAY
HAVE INDEED PERISHED IN THE
SCHOOL AS IT WAS DIRECTLY STRUCK
BY THE TORNADO.

THERE IS NO POWER, NO LIGHTS, NO
COMMUNICATIONS.

THE STRONGEST WINDS EVER
MEASURED ON THE PLANET BECAUSE
THAT OCCURRED JUST AFTER THE
TECHNOLOGY CAME INTO PLAY THAT
ALLOWED US TO MEASURE TORNADOES.

PILES OF RUBBLE.

IT APPEARS WE ARE COVERING A
HISTORY-MAKING TORNADO IN
OKLAHOMA THIS EVENING.

THERE IS NO PLACE BETTER
PREPARED FOR A STORM LIKE THIS
THAN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

I WALKED FROM THE SCHOOL OVER
HERE AND I HEAR A HISSING SOUND
AND REALIZE, LET'S GET OUT OF
HERE.

THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.

AS WE MENTIONED WEATHER CHANNEL
METEOROLOGIST MIKE SEIDEL IS ON
FOOT IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

OUT OF EVERY CONCRETE SLAB YOU
SEE WATER GEYSERS.
