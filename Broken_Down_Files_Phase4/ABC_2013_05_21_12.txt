THIS PHOTO OF A KISSING COUPLE
AND A NOTE FROM THE PERSON WHO
FOUND IT.

ON THE DRIVER'S SEAT, SITTING
RIGHT THERE.

DESTROYED TOO.

AND WE LEARNED FROM THOSE TWO
TEACHERS EARLIER TODAY, DIANE,
THAT THERE WERE NO SAFE ROOMS IN
EITHER OF THOSE SCHOOLS.

ABC NEWS COVERING THE STORY OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

AS MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF
MEXICO PUSHES UP, YOU HAVE
COOLER, DRIER AIR FROM THE WEST
ALOFT.

BABY PICTURES, EVEN A SONOGRAM,
GRADUATIONS, WEDDINGS, AN "I
LOVE YOU" TO MOM.

LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER TONIGHT
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THAT DOES.

BUT TONIGHT WE HAVE LEARNED
34 HORSES SURVIVED.

AND JORDAN, HOW LONG DID THAT
TORNADO SEEM TO LAST FOR YOU?

THIS MOTHER REUNITED WITH HER
SON WHO'S BEEN SOBBING IN THE
ARMS OF HIS TEACHER, WAITING FOR
HER.

SAYING DURING ALL THIS?

THESE HORSES ARE HOW WE
SURVIVE.

AND THOSE REUNIONS CONTINUE.

I WAS JUST GRABBING ON TO
WHATEVER I COULD.

I HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE UNTIL
THE WALL FELL ON TOP OF ME AND
KNOCKED ME OUT.

SHE RODE OUT THE STORM ALL ALONE
AFTER HER OWNERS BARELY ESCAPED
TO A SHELTER JUST TWO MINUTES
BEFORE THE TWISTER HIT.

AT ONE SCHOOL, A MIRACLE.

HER.

AND I WANTED MY FAMILY TO BE
SAFE, BUT I ALSO WANTED
EVERYBODY ELSE'S FAMILY TO BE
SAFE TOO.
