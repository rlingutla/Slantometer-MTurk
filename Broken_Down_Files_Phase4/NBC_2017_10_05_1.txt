THE CRIME SCENE AND A TIME LINE
OF THE BLOOD SHED.

IT WAS JUST MASS CHAOS.

RADIO STATION HAS BEEN PLAYING
IT IN STEWART'S HONOR.

BUT INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY HAVE
YET TO FIND ANY HEALTH PROBLEMS,
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL, GRAVE ENOUGH
TO PUSH HIM INTO BECOMING A
KILLER.

THROUGH ALL THIS HAS BEEN THE
NRA, SILENT SINCE SUNDAY'S
SHOOTING.

SO MANY MOMS AND DADS, SONS AND
DAUGHTERS, FRIENDS AND LOVED
ONES GONE NOW, BUT NEVER
FORGOTTEN.

ANGIE GOMEZ OF RIVERSIDE LOVED
THEATER AND MAKING PEOPLE LAUGH.

TONIGHT, INVESTIGATORS QUESTION,
DID HE HAVE AN ESCAPE PLAN AND
POSSIBLY HELP?

WITH 1600 ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION
AND 50 POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES.

WE ARE OPEN TO HAVING THAT
CONVERSATION.

SHE LIVED SO HUMBLY.

CHAOS ON THE VEGAS STRIP.

YOU'VE BEEN SHOT?

DRAMATIC NEW TAPE AND A NEW TIME
LINE.

THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH
YOU.

AS FOR POLICE SAYING HE
MIGHT HAVE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN,
INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY FOUND NO
HARD EVIDENCE OF THAT OR OF HELP
FROM ANYONE ELSE IN PLANNING OR
CARRYING OUT THE ATTACK.

GET DOWN!

HE METICULOUSLY PLANNED ON
THE WORST DOMESTIC ATTACK IN THE
UNITED STATES HISTORY.

IF I KEEP A CONSTANT FORWARD
PRESSURE ON THIS, IT SIMULATES
FULL AUTO.

THE NIGHT THERE IS SO MUCH
UNCERTAINTY AND PAIN.
