HERE'S A SATELLITE IMAGE OF THAT
SYRIAN BASE.

I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT GOES FROM
HERE.

HE'S BEEN USING BARREL BOMBS
FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST
FIVE YEARS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.

WE'RE RESPONDING NOW.

I THINK IT WAS WELL-DONE.

SO UNLIKELY ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN
U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND RUSSIAN
SHIPS.

I THINK IT'S EASY TO ANSWER PART
OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

FOR US TO ARBITRARILY SAY THAT
WE'RE NOT GO ALLOW THEM IN I
THINK IS A MISTAKE.

THIS PRESIDENT PRODUCED REAL
CONSEQUENCES.

IT'S ABOUT TIME WE'RE REACTING.

IF THERE WERE ANOTHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK, THERE'S NO DOUBT
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD
RESPOND AND ESCALATE HIS ATTACK.

SHEPARD, WELL, I THINK IT WAS
A GOOD STRIKE FOR THE PURPOSES
THAT WERE ANNOUNCED AND THE
PURPOSES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
ANNOUNCED.

THIS IS BY AND LARGE AN
INTRACTABLE SITUATION.

I THINK FOR THEM TO DO ANYTHING
THAT WOULD AGGRAVATE THE
SITUATION FURTHER DOESN'T MAKE A
LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

IT'S IN RESPONSE TO ILLEGAL WAR
CRIME TYPES OF ACTIONS.

BY PRESENT, I DO NOT BELIEVE HE
NEEDS AUTHORIZATION IN TERMS OF
DEFEATING ISIS, WHICH IS NOW IN
SYRIA.

IF ASSAD CARRIES OUT ANOTHER
ATTACK LIKE THIS, THEN WHAT?

IT WAS RUSSIA INVOLVED IN
PRECISION BOMBING OF HOSPITALS
AND HUMANITARIAN ENVOYS.

HERE'S WHERE THE TALE WILL BE
TOLD.

IT IS MOSTLY TO SEND A MESSAGE.
