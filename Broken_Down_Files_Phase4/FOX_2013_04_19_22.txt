THAT'S PAUL SUTHERLAND
HE ACTUALLY HEARD THE
SHOTS, TELLING US SEVERAL
SHOTS.

AND THERE IS IS HOPE THAT
THIS IS SUSPECT NUMBER 2.

TWO YEARS AGO AN UNNAMED
FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ASKED
THE FBI TO CHECK OUT THE
OLDER OF THESE TWO
BROTHERS.

LOOKING AT FRANKLIN
STREET HEAVY POLICE
ACTIVITY.

A SUSPECT IS DOWN.

WE DID SEE HEAVILY ARMED
OFFICERS WITH GUNS DRAWN.

WE WERE JUST ON THE SIDE
STREETS RIGHT THERE WHERE
THE MEDIA HAS BEEN STAGING
HERE FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS
ABOUT, MAYBE 16 HOURS.

HE IS STILL MOVING.

THEN WE HAD A LULL OF ABOUT
30 SECONDS.

SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS AND
YOU HEARD PAUL SUTHERLAND
SAYING MULTIPLE SHOTS
FIRED.

WE INTERRUPT REGULAR
STATIONS
AND FOX STATIONS TO BRING
YOU BREAKING NEWS FROM
WATER TOWN, MASSACHUSETTS.

WELL, FIRST I HEARD
ABOUT -- TWO POPS, YOU
KNOW LOUD DISTINCT POPS,
GUNSHOTS.

IF WE CAN THROW UP A GOOGLE
MAP, AGAIN, THERE WAS A
BOAT TRAILER IN THE YARD OF
THE HOME IN THE BACKYARD.

THEY DO HAVE HIM CORNERED.

BOB AGAIN --
 -- WE'RE ANXIOUSLY
AWAITING WORD.

BOB, I'M SORRY WE CAN'T
HEAR YOU AND WE DO WANT TO
UPDATE PEOPLE ON THE
LATEST.

IT'S LIKE THE FIRST
BREATH OF FRESH AIR THEY
HAVE HAD IN A WHILE.

POLICE WERE TOLD HAVE
SURROUNDED THIS BOAT IT IS
THE BELIEF OF ALL INVOLVED
THAT THIS IS THE SUSPECT.

IT APPEARS PROGRESS
SOMETHING MADE WE'RE TOLD
FROM THE SCENE.

AND JUST ALL THE POLICE
CAME IN AND THAT SOMETHING
WAS HAPPENING.
