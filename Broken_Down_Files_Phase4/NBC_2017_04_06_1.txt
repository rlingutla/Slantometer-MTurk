BREAKING NEWS
TONIGHT A
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
PREPARING
OPTIONS FOR A MILITARY
STRIKE IN
SYRIA.

IMAGES LIKE THESE HAVE
HORRIFIED THE
PRESIDENT.

HERE IN THE U.S., A
HIGH STAKES CRASH
COURSE, SYRIA NOW
OVERSHADOWING NORTH
KOREA.

CALLING ON OUR ALLIES
TO ACT THROUGH THE
POLITICAL PROCESS.

THE COMPANY AT THE TOP
OF HIS AGENDA.

STEPPING OFF HIS PLANE
INTO THE CENTER OF AN
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS,
PRESIDENT TRUMP
HUDDLING TONIGHT WITH
HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY
FOR AN URGENT BRIEFING
ON MILITARY OPTIONS
AGAINST BASHAR AL
ASSAD.

THE INVESTIGATION
CAN HAVE A FRESH
START.

AS A WAY OF PUNISHING
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT
FOR THAT HORRIFIC
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK EARLIER THIS
WEEK.

THOSE STEPS ARE
UNDERWAY.

SPOKES PERSON TODAY
TELLS THE U.S.

NOT SPECIFIC BUT STILL
HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL
YET HE MAY MOVE TO
PUSH ASSAD OUT.

AND IN A MAJOR POLICY
SHIFT, THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS
SPEAKING OPENLY ABOUT
REMOVING BASHAR AL
ASSAD FROM POWER.

TWO MILITARY
OFFICIALS TELL NBC
NEWS THE U.S. WATCHED
ON RADAR AS A SYRIAN
PLANE DROPPED BOMBS IN
THE NORTHERN PART OF
THE COUNTRY MONDAY.

SOMETHING SHOULD
HAPPEN, HE SAYS.

SCHIFF ALSO SAYS
HE'S OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
WORKING WITH THE
REPUBLICAN TAKING OVER
THE PROBE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SPENT
PART OF THIS DAY
HUDDLED WITH HIS TOP
MILITARY ADVISERS,
REVIEWING OPTIONS THAT
MAY INCLUDE KEEPING
SYRIA'S AIR FORCE OUT
OF THE SKY OR EVEN
CRUISE MISSILE
ATTACKS.

AND HE'S THERE, AND I
GUESS HE'S RUNNING
THINGS, SO SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

THIS IS THE ULTIMATE
TEST FOR A COMMANDER
IN CHIEF, WHETHER TO
TAKE MILITARY ACTION,
IN THIS CASE, AFTER A
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
THAT HAS GRIPPED THE
COUNTRY WITH THE WORLD
WATCHING.

IT'S
SUPPORT FOR ASSAD IS
NOT CONDITIONAL.

I THINK WHAT
HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS A
DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.
