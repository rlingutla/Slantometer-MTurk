LAST TORNADO MAYBE THE
PEOPLE THAT GOT HIT THIS
TIME WERE HELPING THOSE
PEOPLE WHEN THEY GOT HIT.

THEY HAD BEEN LOADING TRUCK
LOAD AFTER TRUCK LOAD BY
THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY.

THEY ARE RESOURCEFUL AND
GOT THAT SPIRIT.

THINK OF THIS AS A FUNNEL
LIKE YOU WOULD USE IN YOUR
KITCHEN.

BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE JUST
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST GOING TO
FOCUS ON GETTING THE
INFRASTRUCTURE PUT BACK IN
PLACE.

HE SAYS IN AREAS THE
DESTRUCTION IS WORSE, BUT
THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF THE
DESTRUCTION IN 1999 WAS
LONGER.

WELL, WHEN IT HAD HAD
PASSED OVER THROUGH THEIR
TEARS, THROUGH EVERYTHING,
THEY GOT UP THEY HELPED
TAKE CINDER BLOCKS OFF
THEIR CLASSMATES' LEGS.

WE ARE FLYING ALONG A
STRAIGHT LINE.

YET, EVERY SINGLE TEACHER
AND STUDENT AND
ADMINISTRATOR MANAGED TO
GET OUT OF THEIR ALIVE.

IT'S MUCH THE SAME WAY
HERE.

THE CLOUDS LIFTED UP SOME.

SANDY JONES IS THE CLINIC
DIRECTOR THERE.

THIS TREE THAT YOU SEE HAS
ALL OF ITS NEEDLES AND
LEAVES STILL ON IT AND AS
YOU HAVE SEEN, SHEPARD THE
WINDS SO POWERFUL IT CAN
STRIP THE BARK RIGHT OFF OF
TREES.

BUT THEY HAVE VOWED THEY
WILL REBUILD AND WHEN YOU
LOOK DOWN BELOW, YOU WONDER
CAN THOSE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE
IN THE YEARS TO COME?

I HAD THIS MUCH ROOM.

NOW, BACK TO THE PATH OF IT
ITSELF.

AND THEIR PARENTS SAW THEM.

THOSE WERE THE VERY FIRST
MARKS THAT FAWNDERS MADE
MADE WHEN THEY GOT IN HERE.

THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING
COMING UP ON THE RIGHTS
HERE.

THE TIP OF THE FUNNEL IS
VERY THIN.
