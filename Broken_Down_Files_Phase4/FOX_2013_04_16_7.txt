SERIAL NUMBERS, MANUFACTURER
INFORMATION, DUFFEL BAG AFTER
THE BOMB EXPLODED.

AN UPDATE HOW HE IS DOING.

LISTEN.

WE ARE LEARNING THAT MOM THOUGHT
HER DAUGHTER SURVIVED THE BLAST,
ACCORDING TO A FRIEND'S FACEBOOK
POST THE FAMILY LEARNED THE
TRUTH WHEN THEY GOT TO THE
HOSPITAL AND REALIZED THE
PATIENT IN THE ROOM, IT WAS NOT
THEIR DAUGHTER AFTER ALL.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT YOU CAN'T SECURE
EVENTS LIKE THIS.

AFTER THE EXPLOSION, SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN PARTIALLY BLURRED,
YOU CAN'T SEE THE CARNAGE THAT
IT LEFT BEHIND.

WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO SAY?

BOTH HIS LEGS WERE GONE.

WE WERE PICKING UP METALS AND
PEOPLE WERE CONGRATULATING --
PICKING UP OUR MEDALS AND ALL OF
A SUDDEN, JUST KABOOM.

FINDING A PIECE OF EVIDENCE LIKE
THIS THAT YOU CAN PIECE TOGETHER
YOU'VE GOT TWO TRACKS IN THE
INVESTIGATION.

THEY ARE VERY COMMON EVERYDAY
PIECES.

EVERYBODY SAID YOU NEED TO RUN.

WHITE HOUSE SAYS HE WILL SPEAK
AT AN INTERFAITH SERVICE
DEDICATED TO THE VICTIMS OF THE
BOSTON BOMBING.

I WAS SITTING ON THE COUCH.

IT APPEARS THAT THE LONDON
MARATHON IS GOING TO BE A A
TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS HERE IN
BOSTON?

SOME SAY OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES
KNOB JEOPARDY IF SECURITY
TIGHTENS FURTHER.

AMONG THE FIRST RESPONDERS,
MEDICAL WORKERS AND CIVILIANS
THAT RAN TO HELP THOSE THAT WERE
INJURED.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET WAS
THE OTHER ONE.

I SAW A FIREBALL WHICH IS NOT
LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

YOU MENTIONED THE PRESSURE
COOKER.
