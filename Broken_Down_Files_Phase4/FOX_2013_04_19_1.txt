TWO MORE, A TOTAL OF 8
EXPLOSIONS.

THEY SEEM TO BE WALKING.

AND AUTHORITIES SET OFF
FLASH BANGS INSIDE THE
BUILDING TO TRY AND RESCUE
THE HOSTAGE SHOWS FLASH
BANGS ENDED UP SETTING THE
HOUSE ON FIRE, REMEMBER?

AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE WE
HEARD TWO MORE POPS WHICH
SOUNDED LIKE GUNSHOTS.

IF I'M CORRECT HERE AND
I'M TOLD THIS IS THE SAME
AREA WHERE THE SUSPECTS
WERE SPOTTED LAST NIGHT AS
WELL W WAS
A REPORT THAT.

THEY WANT TO BRING THIS
ROBOT IN TO THE BOAT TO
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO
EXPLOSIVES.

A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE.

THOUGH PEOPLE ARE ON EDGE.

IT IS A VERY TENSE
SITUATION RIGHT NOW OUTSIDE
67 FRANKLIN STREET WHERE
THERE IS A STANDOFF WITH
THE SUSPECT NUMBER 2 HIDING
IN THAT BOAT.

JUST ABOUT 40 MINUTES
AGO THE GOVERNOR SAYING WE
ARE BACK TO MONDAY, MEANING
THEY DID NOT APPREHEND THE
SUSPECT TODAY THAT THEY HAD
TO FOLLOW NEW LEADS.

SUGGESTING POSSIBLY THAT
SOMEBODY MAY HAVE CHANGED
THERE FAST FORWARD JUST A
FEW MINUTES.

SENDING IN A BOMB ROBOT AND
SEE THE IMAGES.

AND RIGHT NOW BASICALLY
WHAT YOU HAVE IS A
STANDOFF.

THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKINGOUT RIGHT
THERE.

A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO.

THERE IS SOME REPORTS NOW
THAT THEY MAY HAVE ACTUALLY
FOUND THE GUY INSIDE THIS
BOAT WITH THE TARP OVER IT
BY USING IMAGES FROM A
HELICOPTER.

THEY HAVE GOT HIM CORNERED.

IT CERTAINLY IS.

BEAR IN MIND THAT HIS
BROTHER WAS SAID TO
POSSIBLY HAVE HAD ANOSIVE DEVICE LAST
NIGHT.

OVER NEAR FRANKLINEET
RIGHT NOW.
