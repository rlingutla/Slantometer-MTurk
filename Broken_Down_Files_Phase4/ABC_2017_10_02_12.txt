PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER,
SHELTERING BEHIND ANYTHING THEY
COULD.

AND THE FACES OF THE VICTIMS.

THE UNMISTAKABLE SOUND DIFFERENT
FROM ANYTHING WE'VE HEARD FROM
ALL OTHER RECENT MASS SHOOTINGS.

AND WHAT THE SHERIFF HERE
REVEALED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO,
IN A MOMENT.

DOCTORS OVERWHELMED WITH
HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS.

SENDING A ROBOT TO THE DOOR.

AND TONIGHT, RIGHT HERE, THE
AUDIO, AS S.W.A.T.

HIS GAMBLING HABIT, HIS FAMILY
HISTORY, AND THIS QUESTION --
DID HE HAVE ANY TIES TO FOREIGN
GROUPS?

790-RI, I'M GOING TO FORM A
STRIKE TEAM.

HORROR, TONIGHT WE ARE ALSO
LEARNING OF ASTONISHING ACTS OF
HEROIC BRAVERY, HUDDLING
TOGETHER, CARRYING THE INJURED
THROUGH THE CHAOS AND TO SAFETY,
USING THEIR OWN BODIES AS
PROTECTION.

AND THEY TOLD YOU, THIS IS GOING
TO BE A COMPLEX INVESTIGATION AT
EACH OF THESE SCENES.

YEAH, EVERYBODY WAS JUMPING
OVER THE FENCES AND STUFF, BUT
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO
LEAVE MY BUDDY.

HE HAD KILLED HIMSELF.

WAITING UP TO FIVE HOURS TO
DONATE.

POLICE DESCENDED HIGH ABOVE THE
PANICKED CROWDS, S.W.A.T.

HE WAS A WEALTHY GUY AND HE
LIKED TO PLAY VIDEO POKER.

YOU GUYS WERE TRYING TO DO
TRIAGE WHILE THE SHOOTING IS
STILL GOING ON?

TONIGHT SEARCH FOR CLUES AT HIS
HOME IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY
IN MESQUITE, NEVADA, THE MOTIVE
OF 64-YEAR-OLD STEPHEN PADDOCK,
SEEN IN THIS PHOTO POSTED ON
FACEBOOK BY HIS GIRLFRIEND,
REMAINS A MYSTERY.

ASSEMBLING A REMARKABLE ARSENAL.

AND WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS
INDIVIDUAL.
