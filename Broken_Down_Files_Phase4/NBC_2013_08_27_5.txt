PHYSICAL THERAPY HAD HELPED HIM
WALK, HIS MOTHER SAYS, BUT
SYRIA'S WAR HAS CHANGED THAT.

MOMENTUM FOR PUNISHING ACTION
AGAINST THE ASSAD GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE
DAY, AND AS WE BEGIN HERE
TONIGHT, THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW
DEVELOPMENTS TO REPORT.

NBC'S KEVIN TIBBLES WENT TO THE
MINNESOTA STATE FAIR TODAY TO
SEE HOW ALL THIS IS PLAYING FAR
FROM WASHINGTON.

WE ARE READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

IN THE MEANTIME, THEY OFFER
NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS AND
WEEKLY CHECKUPS TO HELP HIM GAIN
WEIGHT AND GET STRONGER.

NOBODY SHOULD USE THAT.

PLUS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

HIS MOTHER FEARS FOR HIS LIFE.

SHE SAYS, I'M VERY SAD ABOUT MY
SON.

SINCE THEY FLED HERE, SHE'S
TRYING TO GET HELP AS HER SON'S
CONDITION WORSENS.

WHEN I SAW HIM, THE LIFE IN
EYES DIED WHEN YOU SAW HIM?

AND THERE HE WAS, HIS FACE
GAUNT, HIS ARMS LIKE TWIGS.

WE HAVE PLENTY OF OUR OWN
BATTLES TO BE FOUGHT.

THAT'S AWFUL.

FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE FALSE
CLAIMS ABOUT IRAQ'S WMD A DECADE
AGO.

WE SUGGESTED A CLINIC SHE DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT, IN THIS SPRAWLING
CAMP AND OFFERED HER AND IBRAHIM
A RIDE THERE.
