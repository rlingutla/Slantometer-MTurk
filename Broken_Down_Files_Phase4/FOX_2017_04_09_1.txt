AND NOT ENOUGH TO COMPLEXION A
POTENTIALLY GREATER CONFLICT.

CONGRESS CUT SEEM TO AGREE ON
ANYTHING.

GOES OUT FIRST BECAUSE, LET'S

THAT'S NEXT LINE POINT.

WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
ABOUT A NATIONAL SECURITY
CONCERN BUT ON A DIFFERENT
TOPIC, TALKING ABOUT CHURCH
BOMBINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
TWEETING, SO SAD TO HEAR OF
TERRORIST ATTACK IN EGYPT, U.S.

BUT IS IT ENOUGH?

ALSO UNFOLDING U.S. MAKING MOVES
IN TWO MAJOR GLOBAL HOT SPOTS,
SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA, PRESIDENT
TRUMP ARRIVING BACK IN
WASHINGTON D.C. AFTER A FEW DAYS
IN FLORIDA MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT OF CHINA.

WE'VE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT
SHE'S DONE ANYTHING IMPROPER,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE AN EFFORT TO
TAR AND FEATHER HER.

WE CANNOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVEN
SYRIA SIGNED ONTO THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS CONVENTION AS WELL.

THE FEELING IS ONE OF
GRATITUDE TOWARD THE U.S.

I WANT TO TELL PRESIDENT
TRUMP, THE FIRST STRIKE WAS
GOOD, IT SAVED US.

THAT'S WHEN EXECUTIVE HAS
FLEXIBILITY IN TIME TO TAKE
ACTION IF THEY DEEM FIT.

HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL.

THIS PRESIDENT, AND THE PREVIOUS
PRESIDENT, TWO ADMINISTRATIONS
OPERATING OFF USE OF MILITARY
FORCE FROM 16 YEARS AGO FROM A
THIRD ADMINISTRATION.

BUT JUST A FEW HOURS LATER THE
AIRBAGS CONTINUED WORKING, IT'S
LIKE A CHALLENGE FROM ASSAD.

I CAN STILL ATTACK FROM THE SAME
BASE YOU ATTACKED.

UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGY AND
THE GOALS ARE.

UNDER THE UN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
TREATY, YOU CANNOT PRODUCE,
DEVELOP, OR USE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, I DO SUPPORT THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS ACTION.

AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE, THE
WHOLE FAMILY WAS DEAD.

HE SAID THE U.S. SHOULD DO MORE
NOW, NOT JUST ONE STRIKE.
