MATT POLICE ARE CALLING THAT
SECURITY GUARD A TRUE HERO.

I SAID, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THESE WERE INNOCENT PEOPLE.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED REPORTS
THE SHOOTER LEFT BEHIND SOME
KIND OF A NOTE, WHICH
AUTHORITIES SAY CONTAINED A
SERIES OF CRYPTIC NUMBERS, BUT
WAS NOT A SUICIDE NOTE.

AND THAT LAW SHOULD NEVER BE
CHANGED.

HE BEGAN FIRING WILDLY INTO IT
INJURING THAT SECURITY GUARD.
