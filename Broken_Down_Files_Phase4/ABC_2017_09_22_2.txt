JUST ABREAST OF
NORTH CAROLINA, THE FORECAST
GETTING CLOSE TO THE U.S. AND
OUR SPAGHETTI MODELS SPREAD OUT.

THURSDAY AS SHE STRUGGLED TO
KEEP 11 NURSING HOME PATIENTS
ALIVE.

DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING IN PUERTO
RICO.

THEN THE SON OF ONE OF HER
PATIENT'S SHOWS UP WITH A DIESEL
THAT THE CARE CENTER DESPERATELY
NEEDS.

CALLING AGAIN TODAY.

WE'RE GLAD TO SEE THE NURSING
HOME AT LEAST GOT SOME FUEL.

POWER GONE.

THE GENERATOR OUT OF FUEL.

TONIGHT THE NEW EMERGENCY IN
THIS UNFOLDING DISASTER.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

AND THE NEW STORM MODELS SHOWING
THE TRACK OF HURRICANE MARIA
ONCE AGAIN CLOSER TO THE EAST
COAST OF THE U.S.
WE HAVE THE TIMING AND THE
POSSIBLE PATH.

IT'S BEEN 20 HOURS SINCE WE
CALLED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON
HER BEHALF.

ROB MARCIANO IS BACK WITH US.

FLASH FLOODING FORCING 70,000
PEOPLE TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.

THE MEANTIME THE POSSIBLE
PATHS FOR HURRICANE MARIA AS IT
MOVES TOWARDS THE EAST COAST.

WE HAD TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH
AND WE'RE NOT ALONE.

SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE AND THERE
COULD BE SOME DIRECT IMPACTS
FROM MARIA IN THE U.S.
BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

A DAM AT IMMINENT RISK OF
FAILURE, A LIFE-THREATENING
SITUATION.

MARIA HASN'T SEEN OR HEARD FROM
HER MOTHER SINCE BEFORE THE
HURRICANE HIT.

I SEE WHEN THAT RUNS OUT --
 WHAT WE GOING TO DO?
