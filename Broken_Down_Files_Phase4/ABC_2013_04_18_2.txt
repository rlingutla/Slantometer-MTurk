THERE IS STILL NO INDICATION OF
WHETHER THERE WAS AN ACT OF
FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM,
BUT THE PRESIDENT VOWED TODAY
THE BOMBERS, WHOEVER THEY ARE,
WILL NOT ESCAPE.

A SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIAL TELLS ME E WO
SUSPECTS IS SEEN IN ANHER
VIO MAKING A CELLPHONE CALL
AROUND THE TIME OF THE
EXNS.

ONE WITH A BLACK CAP, THE SECOND
WITH A WHITE CAP WORN BACKWARDS.

BOTH WEARING BACKPACKS THAT THE
FBI BELIEVE HELD THE BOMBS.

AS WE SAID, THE PRESIDENT
TODAY DELIVERED A SUMMONS, A
PROMISE, AND A BLAZING TRIBUTE
IN BOSTON.

WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE.

THE FBI SAYS ONLY ONE OF THE TWO
POTENTIAL SUSPECTS, THE ONE WITH
THE WHITE CAP, WAS ACTUALLY SEEN
PLACING HIS BACKPACK AT THE
SCENE OF AN EXPLOSION.

SOME OF THE COMPONENTS,
INCLUDING THIS BATTERY, AND THIS
CIRCUIT BOARD, WERE RECOGNIZED
BY HOBBYISTS AS PARTS OF A TOY
REMOTE CONTROL CAR, SIMILAR TO
THIS ONE SEEN IN AN ONLINE
VIDEO.

WE MAY BE MOMENTARILY KNOCKED
OFF OUR FEET, BUT WE'LL PICK
OURSELVES UP.

[ APPLAUSE ]
CHEERS WERE ABRUPTLY SILENCED
MARATHON DAY, THE PRESIDENT
TODAY ROUSED THEM ONCE AGAIN.

THE ANGUISH, STILL SO FRESH FROM
THE PARISHIONERS TO THE
PRESIDENT HIMSELF.

ACCORDING TO THE FBI.

AND, YES, YOU WILL FACE JUSTICE.

THE OWNER OF ONE HOBBY STORE
OUTSIDE BOSTON SAID FBI AGENTS
INTERVIEWED HIM LAST NIGHT AND
LEFT LITTLE DOUBT THAT A REMOTE
CONTROLLED UNIT HAD BEEN USED IN
THE BOMBS.

THE FBI RELEASING SURVEILLANCE
TAPES.

AND TO LOOK OVER EVERY FRAME BY
FRAME, THEY SENT EVERYONE TO THE
WEBSITE, FBI.GOV TO CHECK IT
OUT.

AND RUNNERS, IN THOSE SIGNATURE
MARATHON JACKETS.

RE IDENTIFT O.

THE FBI IS BASING ITS TWO-BOMBER
THEORY ON THESE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA VIDEOS AND STILL PICTURES
MADE PUBLIC LATE TODAY.

THEY BELIEVE THAT THE CELLPHONE
WAS USED TO TRIGGER ONE OF THE
EXPLOSIONS.
