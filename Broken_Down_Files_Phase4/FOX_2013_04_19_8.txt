AND THEY ARE FLYING PAST A
LARGE SWAT HEADQUARTERS HAS
BEEN DOWN HERE AND THEY ARE
ALL HEADED RIGHT THIS
MINUTE TOWARD WATERTOWN
GETTING STRAIGHT ON TO THE HIGHWAY
AND IN THAT
DIRECTION.

BOB, DO YOU HAVE AN
ADVANTAGE POINT DOWN TO THE
EDGE OF THIS STREET?

AND TOAD IT WHEN SHE SAW
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RACING
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND EVENTUALLY DOWN TO THIS
LOCATION RIGHT HERE WHERE
WE ARE TOLD THROUGH SOURCES
AT 67 FRANKLIN STREET THAT
THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS
PERSON IN CUSTODY YET.

WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

A ROBOTIC DEVICE THAT WILL
BE ABLE TO SEARCH THE BOAT
AND THAT AREA AND IN THE
BACKYARD WHERE IT IS BEEN
TOLD TO US AND JARED
HOLBROOK REPORTED EARLIER
THAT POTENTIALLY THE
SUSPECT WAS HIDING IN THAT
BOAT UNDER ONE OF THOSE
CANOPIES YOU PUT ON TO
WINTERIZE YOUR BOAT.

HEAVY, HEAVY POLICE
PRESENCE RIGHT HERE.

AN AMBULANCE TYPE VEHICLE
OBVIOUSLY.

IF YOU REMEMBER THE
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED IN
CALIFORNIA WHEN THE MAN WAS
GOING TO -- HE WAS SHOOTING
A BUNCH OF COPS OUT THERE.

67 FRANKLIN STREET IS WHAT
WE BELIEVE TO BE THE
ADDRESS.

BOTTOM LINE IS THEY WANT
TO GET HIM AS YOU SAID,
THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM
ALIVE.

BUT NOW WE SEE SOME PEOPLE
MERELY WALKING UP TO IT AT
THIS POINT.

PRESSURE COOKER BOMB WAS
FOUND TODAY IN CAMBRIDGE.

FAMILIES WERE EVACUATING
EARLIER RUNNING AT A GOOD
CLIP.

YEAH.

YOU COULD SEE EVERYBODY
HANGING OUT ON THE PORCH.

ONCE THE SUN C
WAS A VERY TENSE PLACE.

CHRIS, I GUESS THIS WAS
WHAT, 10, 15 MINUTES AGO?

NOT TOO FAR
AWAY.

WAS HE SHOT IN THIS
BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE?

YES.
