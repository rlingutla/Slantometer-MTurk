REALLY BAD.

ALTHOUGH THE IMAGES ARE
GRUESOME, THE ATTACKS HAVE NOT
CHANGED.

THAT IS EVERYTHING IN THIS
EQUATION.

THIS ALL COMING ONE WEEK AHEAD
OF THAT VISIT, SHEP, AS THE
SECRETARY OF STATE SPEAKING AT
LENGTH ABOUT SYRIA PREVIOUS TO
THIS SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS
ALREADY IN DISCUSSIONS, TALKING
ABOUT A POST AL-ASSAD SYRIA AND
AS YOU PLAYED LEADING INTO OUR
DISCUSSION HERE, THAT THE U.S.
IS LEAVING A NUMBER OF OPTIONS
ON THE TABLE IN RESPONDING TO
THIS.

"WHAT WILL WE GET FOR BOMBING
SYRIA BESIDES MORE DEBT AND A
POSSIBLE LONG-TERM CONFLICT?

THE RUSSIANS ARE SUPPORTING HIM.

THE DEVICE TURNED UP IN THE
APARTMENT WHERE THE SUSPECT
LIVED.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SPOKEN ABOUT
SYRIA AS HE HEADED ON AIR FORCE
ONE DOWN TO FLOOR.

YOU SEE BABIES DEAD FROM GAS AND
A VERY HEINOUS FORM OF GAS,
WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE
ACCESS, TO IT'S BAD STUFF.

MOMENTS AGO, SECRETARY OF STATE
TILLERSON SAID THE SECOND MAJOR
SIGNAL OF AN AMERICAN POLICY
CHANGE TOWARDS SYRIA.

SO FAR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MANY
OTHER WORLD LEADERS SAY THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS FLATLY TO
BLAME.

THAT BECAUSE PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAID THE SAME THING BACK
REGARDING THIS MATTER EARLIER.

SO I'LL READ THE TRANSCRIPT.

THESE PICTURES ARE NEW.

HOW DO YOU COME TO SOME
AGREEMENT WITH THE RUSSIANS WHO
HAVE BEEN PROPPING UP THE SYRIAN
DICTATOR?

THE PRESIDENT SAID WHAT ASSAD
DID IS TERRIBLE.

THAT'S THE WORDS FROM SHERIFF
DEPUTIES.

BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
OVERTHROW BASHAR AL-ASSAD?

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

IT'S THE RUSSIAN'S AIRSPACE.
