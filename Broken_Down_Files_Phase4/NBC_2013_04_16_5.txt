AND TONIGHT, GOVERNOR OF
MASSACHUSETTS DEVAL PATRICK IS
WITH US FROM THE COMMAND POST AT
THE WESTIN HOTEL NOT FAR FROM US
HERE.

WERE WATCHING THE RACE.

I HEARD YOUR PUBLIC PLEA,
GOVERNOR, A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS
HELPED BY AN ARMY SERGEANT JUST
BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN.

NEWTOWN SHOOTING VICTIMS WERE AT
THE RACE, BUT NONE WERE INJURED.

URGENCY OF YESTERDAY'S RESPONSE.

THE INVESTIGATORS AT THE
FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL
ARE COORDINATING BEAUTIFULLY,
AND WE HAVE EVERY CONCEIVABLE
ASSET ON THE GROUND, AND THEY
ARE LITERALLY COMBING THE BLAST
SITE WITH A FINE-TOOTH COMB TO
PIECE TOGETHER WHAT HAPPENED AND
ULTIMATELY THE STORY OF HOW AND
BRING WHOMEVER IS RESPONSIBLE TO
JUSTICE.

THE YANKEES AND RED SOX LOGOS
SIDE BY SIDE RIGHT THERE ON THE
SIDE OF YANKEE STADIUM IN THE
BRONX WHERE TONIGHT THE YANKEES
WILL PAUSE TO PLAY THE FENWAY
ANTHEM "SWEET CAROLINE" AS THE
ULTIMATE SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR
BOSTON.

TOM COSTELLO IS AT THE VERIZON
CENTER IN WASHINGTON WHERE
THERE'S AN NHL GAME TONIGHT.

I JUST KEPT THE CAMERA UP,
JUST PUSHED THE RAPID SHUTTER
BUTTON DOWN AND JUST TOOK, YOU
KNOW, 25 PICTURES OVER THE
COURSE OF -- IF FELT LIKE A LONG
TIME, BUT I THINK IT WAS ONLY 15
OR 20 SECONDS.

ON THIS DAY AFTER, MANY
AMERICANS FELT ON EDGE LIKE THEY
HAVEN'T IN YEARS.

BRIAN, THIS HEAVY POLICE
PRESENCE WILL BE A WAY OF LIFE
FOR BOSTON RESIDENTS FOR SOME
TIME TO COME, BUT THERE WERE
THOUSANDS OF VISITORS HERE,
SPECTATORS, THEY CAME TO BEAR
WITNESS TO A GREAT SPORTING
EVENT.

I THINK THE EVENT IN BOSTON
YESTERDAY WILL RAISE ONCE AGAIN
THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THERE IS
A REASON, THERE IS A NEED FOR
THE EXTRA SECURITY THAT THEY
ENCOUNTER.

A FORMER BOMB INVESTIGATOR SAYS
THE EXPERTS KNOW WHAT TO LOOK
FOR.

IN WASHINGTON, A HEAVY POLICE
PRESENCE IN THE SUBWAYS.

THERE HAS TO BE HUNDREDS, IF
NOT THOUSANDS, OF PHOTOGRAPHS OR
VIDEOS OR OBSERVATIONS THAT WERE
MADE DOWN AT THAT FINISH LINE
YESTERDAY.

NOW SHE REMEMBERS THE COMPASSION
OF THOSE WHO RUSHED TO HELP.

THE AREA WAS CHECKED TWICE FOR
BOMBS YESTERDAY, BUT THERE WAS
NO SECURITY SCREENING.

NUMBER OF STORIES THAT WILL
BREAK YOUR HEART HERE INCLUDING
THE STORY OF THE SECOND VICTIM,
KRYSTLE CAMPBELL.

THERE'S MULTIPLE PEOPLE DOWN!

IT'S A SLOW PROCESS.
