AND MANY OF THEM CHILDREN WHO
WERE PULLED FROM AN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL THAT TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

THIS IS IT RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME
AS I STEP OUT OF THE WAY, AND
LET JOE ZOOM IN.

PEOPLE SAY, WHY DO YOU DO STREET
SIGNS FIRST?

LESTER, LET'S BEGIN WITH THIS
DEATH TOLL.

HUNDREDS MORE ARE INJURED.

I MEAN YOU JUST HAVE TONS OF
DEBRIS EVERYWHERE.

NOW, BRING US UP TO DATE.

WE ARE NOT DYING TODAY.

MISERABLE AFTERNOON IN OKLAHOMA,
THE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS HIT
HOME.

THAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE
TO DO.

THERE'S SO MANY TRUCKS THEY
CAN'T GET TO IT.

NOW, SAFE ROOMS.

THIS IS ONE HOUSE IN YOUR TOWN.

THE PATH WAS 17 MILES LONG, 17
MILES OF REAL ESTATE.

IF YOU LIVED HERE FOR 30 YEARS,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STREET IS.

WEATHER CHANNEL METEOROLOGIST
OUR OLD FRIEND JIM CANTORE IS
HERE WITH US.

7 OF THEM WERE STILL INSIDE
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

LAST WEEK AT SCHOOL,
GRADUATION.

THEY'RE WORKING ON IT.

THE HOUSE DOESN'T LOOK THE
SAME EITHER.
