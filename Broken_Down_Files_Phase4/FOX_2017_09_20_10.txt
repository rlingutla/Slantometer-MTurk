WE JUST MOVED AROUND TO A
NEIGHBORHOOD.

WE'LL BE ADDING IMPACTS ACROSS
PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY AS THE STORM PULLS
OFF TO THE NORTH.

WEST COAST, 300 IN PUERTO RICO
WHERE HURRICANE MARIA HAS BEEN
PUNISHING THAT ISLAND WITH
POWERFUL WINDS.

SOME HOUSES WE SAW ON THE STREET
GONE.

WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN
ISLAND WITH FIVE MILLION PEOPLE,
THAT IS ASTOUNDING.

THE MOST URGENT NEED IS
RESTORING THE POWER ON THE
ISLAND.

THERE'S SO MANY DOWNED POWER
LINES AND DOWNED BRANCHES.

THERE'S A LOT OF FLOODING IN
MANY AREAS.

FIRST TO PUSH OUT DEBRIS TO OPEN
THE ROADS AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY
POWER TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO
GET IT BACK UP AND TRY TO
RESTORE ROUTINE.

ALL GUIDANCES HAVE A WEAKER
STORM.

THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE ISLAND,
FEMA, WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR,
WORKING WITH THE TEAMS.

WE DON'T KNOW THE RESULTS YET.

WE'LL CONTINUE TO MEET THE
DEMANDS.

WE'VE BEEN MANAGING PEOPLE FROM
ST. THOMAS, THE U.S. VIRGIN
ISLANDS, THE BRITISH VIRGIN
ISLANDS, GIVING SHELTER TO THEM.

THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
WARNING OF LIFE THREATENING
WINDS AND STORM SURGE AND RAIN
OVER PUERTO RICO IN ST. CROIX
TODAY.

UNLIKE HERE IN THE U.S., THE
CELL PHONE PROVIDERS IN PUERTO
RICO RELY SOLELY ON THE PUBLIC
POWER GRID.

THEY'VE BEEN RUNNING FOR 30 DAYS
AT THIS POINT.

THOSE WOODEN HOUSES ARE ALMOST
GONE IN MANY AREAS OF THE
ISLAND.

EXPAND OF ALL THAT YOUR
DEPARTMENT IS DEALING WITH, IT'S
HARD TO FATHOM HOW DIFFICULT IT
MUST BE TO GET THROUGH THIS.

YES, STILL, A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE STILL HERE BECAUSE OF THE
FLOODING AND THE RIVERS OUT OF
THEIR BANKS.
