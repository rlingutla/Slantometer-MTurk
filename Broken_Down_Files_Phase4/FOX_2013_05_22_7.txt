AND YOU CAN SEE AGAIN I'M
TRYING TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS IS.

THE MOORE THEATER RIGHT
HERE IN THE HEART OF ALL OF
THE DESTRUCTION A PLACE
MAYBE WHERE FOLKS COULD GET
AWAY AND TAKE THEIR MINDS
OFF ALL OF THIS MESS EVEN
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES.

I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM
THE SCHOOL ACROSS ABOUT A
FOUR TO FIVE MILE AREA OF
THE WORST OF DESTRUCTION.

HERE IN MOORE OKLAHOMA,
OFFICIALS NOW SAY MONDAY'S
TORNADO MAY HAVE DAMAGED OR
DESTROYED AS MANY AS 13,000
HOMES.

AS IT STANDS NOW 24 PEOPLE
HAVE DIED IN THIS DISASTER.

THEY ARE CRYING THEY ARE
UPSET.

THEY LOOKED INSIDE AND
MOVED ON.

THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THEY
MIGHT NOT EVER BE ABLE TO
GET IT ACCOMPLISHED.

AND I KNOW THAT ANY TEACHER
IN THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE
DONE THE SAME EXACT THING.

WHEN THE WINDS BLEW OUT THE
WALLS AND THOSE GERDERS
CAME DOWN AND COLLAPSED THE
ROOF.

HE HAS BEEN DRIVING AROUND
IN OUR QUICK RESPONSE
VEHICLE.

GETTING THE PEOPLE BACK IN
THEIR HOUSES.

EVEN IN THAT THEY STILL
KNEW TO HELP THEIR
CO-WORKERS AND SO I'M SO
PROUD OF THEM.

NO PRECISE COUNTY DATE.

THAT'S NOT AN OPTION NOT TO
KEEP THEM ALIVE.

THERE WAS SO MUCH DEBRIS ON
THAT DAY THERE WAS SO MUCH
WORK TO BE DONE.

BUT IF YOU COULD PUSH THAT
FUNNEL DOWN INTO THE
GROUND, THE AREA WHICH IS
CONCENTRATED ON THE GROUND,
IT'S WIDER.

DESPITE EVERYTHING.

HE IS SET TO MEET WITH
SURVIVORS AND THANK THE
RESPONDERS.

THAN A YEAR OLD.
