U.S. OFFICIALS TELL US A RUSSIAN
OR SYRIAN DRONE WAS SEEN FLYING
OVER A HOSPITAL WHERE THE
VICTIMS WERE TAKEN ON TUESDAY
SHORTLY BEFORE THAT HOSPITAL WAS
BOMBED.

ACCORDING TO THE U.S. MILITARY,
THE TARGETS INCLUDING RUNWAY,
THE AIRCRAFT THEMSELVES, HANGERS
AND FUEL.

THAT COULD MAKE A DIPLOMATIC
SOLUTION POSSIBLE.

NOT ONLY TO THE SYRIAN DICTATOR
BUT TO OTHERS.

IN FACT, WANTED TO TAKE EVEN
MORE ACTION IN THIS ATTACK
YESTERDAY.

IN ORANGE, THOSE ARE WORKSHOPS.

SOME INVOLVE COOPERATION WITH
RUSSIA.

THE PRESIDENT JUST A WEEK AGO
HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN OR AT LEAST
WHAT HE SAID HOW -- WHAT HE WAS
TALKING ABOUT.

AND AHEAD, WE'LL SPOOK TO A
LAWMAKER FROM EACH PARTY AND
EACH PARTY'S ROLE IN THIS AND
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD
HAVE TO GO TO CONGRESS FOR
APPROVAL AS PRESIDENT TRUMP
SUGGESTED THAT BARACK OBAMA
SHOULD BACK IN THE DAY.

WELL, I THINK THE RUSSIANS
WILL VET NOR AWHILE.

I DON'T BELIEVE THE RUSSIANS
WILL DO ANYTHING TO AGGRAVATE
THE SITUATION WITH THE UNITED
STATES.

AL-ASSAD CALLED THE STRIKES
RECKLESS AND ACCUSED THE UNITED
STATES OF HELPING ISIS.

THE ONE DOT THERE.

FOR AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE.

EXPERTS SAY IT'S OF NO CONCERN.

FOX NEWS HAS LEARNED THAT A
RUSSIAN NAVAL SHIP IS HEADING TO
THE REGION.

THE MORE INTERESTING QUESTION
IS, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GO AFTER
THE REGIME, HE DIDN'T GET
INVOLVED IN THE CIVIL WAR, HE
MADE A STATEMENT ABOUT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, WHAT HAPPENS IF ASSAD
GOES AFTER CIVILIANS IN NORTHERN
IRAQ WITH CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS?

THE PENTAGON HAS SUBMITTED PLANS
FOR THAT.

THAT ACCORDING TO THOSE DEFENSE
OFFICIALS THAT JUST BRIEFED HERE
AT THE PENTAGON.

THE PRESIDENT DITHERED.
