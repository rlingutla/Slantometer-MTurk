AND SO THEY HAVE A GOOD
CASE AGAINST THIS GUY.

OKAY?

AND I WONDER IF GOVERNOR
PATRICK HAPPENED AROUND 7
O'CLOCK LIFTED THAT ORDER TO
STAY IN PLACE IF YOU WOULD
HAVE FOUND HIM ALIVE?

WE'LL GET MORE FROM THE HEAD
JOURNALIST OF FOX NEWS .

SHOTS FIRED.

THEY WERE PREPARE ALMOST LIKE
TWO SOLDIERS WALKING DOWN BOL
STON STREET TO DO THAT.

CHARGINGS FOR THE SURVIVING
BOSTON SUSPECT COULD COME
TONIGHT.

 LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THE
BOMBINGS IN BOSTON.

AND THEY'RE EXCHANGED.

BE ADVISED F.B.I.

ALL UNITS HOLD YOUR FIRE.

STAND BY.

WITH US NOW IS THE CHIEF
HIMSELF LIVE FROM WATTWATT.

WHILE POLICE SEARCHED FOR
SUSPECTS.

HE'S IN CUSTODY.

HE'S NOT GETTING THAT.

YOU KNOW, WE HAD ASKED OUR
COMMUNITY TO BE DILIGENT AND
RESPECT OUR SHELTER IN PLACE
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT GENTLEMEN
DID.

OFF OF THE AIR.

ALL UNITS BE ADVISED GAS GOING
INTO THE BOAT.

IT A GREAT SHOW OF SUPPORT BY
THE YANKEES FANNINGS.
