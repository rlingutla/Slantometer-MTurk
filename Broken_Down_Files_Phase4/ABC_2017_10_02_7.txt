WE NEED TO POP THIS AND SEE IF
WE GET ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM
THIS GUY, TO SEE IF HE'S IN HERE
OR IF HE'S ACTUALLY MOVED OUT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

THERE WAS DANA GARDNER.

SHOTS FIRED FROM MANDALAY
BAY, THERE'S MANY PEOPLE DOWN.

TERRIFIED PEOPLE ON THE GROUND,
DURING THE ROUNDS OF RELENTLESS
GUNFIRE, THEY WERE HUDDLING.

MATT, WHO HAS BEEN HERE SINCE
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS, THANK
YOU.

AND TONIGHT, THE HORRIFIC TOLL
NOW EMERGING.

THEY SAY HE HAMMERED THROUGH THE
HOTEL'S THICK WINDOWS AND
STARTED FIRING ON THE CROWD
BELOW.

LEADING A MOMENT OF SILENCE,
ORDERING FLAGS FLOWN AT HALF
STAFF AND PERSONALLY CALLING THE
LAS VEGAS SHERIFF.

LEARNING ABOUT THAT LATE TODAY.

ALL UNITS, MOVE BACK.

THERE WERE MEN GOING OVER
THEIR WIVES, THEIR GIRLFRIENDS
TO BLOCK THEM.

IT WAS PAINFUL.

THE AUDIENCE, HUDDLING ON THE
GROUND, THE MANDALAY LOOMING
OVER THEM.

I NEED FIVE OFFICERS ON ME.

THEY WOULD RUN FOR THEIR LIVES
BEFORE WITNESSES SAY THE GUNFIRE
WOULD THEN BEGIN AGAIN.

WAS THIS PART OF THE SHOW?

WE JUST NEED TO GET PEOPLE OVER
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

THE KILLER'S ARSENAL.

WE'VE CHECKED ALL THE FEDERAL
DATABASES AND LOCAL DATABASES
AND STATE DATABASES.

WHAT WE HAVE JUST LEARNED
TONIGHT ABOUT THE HEAVY
ARTILLERY DISCOVERED IN THAT
SOURCES NOW REVEALING THE
ASSORTMENT OF HIGH POWERED
WEAPONS, CAPABLE OF SLICING
THROUGH BODY ARMOR WORN BY
POLICE.
