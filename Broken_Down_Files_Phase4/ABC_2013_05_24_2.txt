MRS. DIEDZIK, WHO TOLD THEM
THIS --
 IT'S ALMOST OVER!

ALL DAY LONG AND ALL YEAR LONG.

BUT SHE KNEW IT WOULD CALM THEM.

THEY WERE REMEMBERING, BECAUSE
THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS
LEFT OF SCHOOL FOR THE YEAR.

AND IN THE CLASSROOM NEXT DOOR,
WE WERE SURPRISED TO MEET MISS
DOMINICK, ALREADY BACK PICKING
UP THE PIECES.

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

SO MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO
PARENTS.

THE TEACHERS PROTECTING THEIR
STUDENTS, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY OF
THEM ARE PARENTS, TOO, WITH
THEIR OWN CHILDREN IN THOSE TWO
SCHOOLS.

MY ENTIRE CLASS WAS SAFE AND
WELL.

THEIR SCREAMS WE WILL NEVER
FORGET.

THE OKLAHOMA TEACHERS
AND EVERY TEACHER IN THIS
COUNTRY WHO JUMPS IN WHEN OUR
CHILDREN NEED THEM.

WE ALSO LEARNED THAT WHEN THE
TORNADO HIT, SHE HAD HER
CHILDREN SINGING IN THE HALLWAY,
TRYING TO DISTRACT THEM.

MY SON AND ALL OF THE KIDS
HUDDLED DOWN WITH THEIR HANDS
CLASPED BEHIND THEIR HEADS.

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

WE HEARD THAT TEACHER TRYING TO
CALM HER STUDENTS THE MOMENT
THAT TORNADO HIT.

AND LYING ON TOP OF HIM AND THE
OTHER CHILDREN, HIS TEACHER,
MRS. BITTLE.

MRS. BITTLE, WHAT GOT HER
THROUGH.

EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW IT WOULDN'T
GO THROUGH.

OUR CHILD IS MY CHILD, SHE SAID.

I HATE THIS!
