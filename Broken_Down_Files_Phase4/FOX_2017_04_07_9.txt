I DON'T WANT TO AVOID THAT
SITUATION.

THE PRESIDENT JUST DECIDED TO GO
AFTER THE ONE BASE SPECIFICALLY
TIED TO THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN
NORTHERN IRAQ AND THE CIVILIANS
THERE.

IT'S A PRETTY EXPANSIVE PLACE.

I'LL SPEAK WITH THAT ANALYST
NEXT.

THAT'S HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HAVE THEIR VOICE AND THAT IS
WHAT THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDS.

SHOULD THE UNITED STATES PIT
ITSELF AGAINST THOSE THREE
POWERS AT THE SAME TIME AND DO
YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT
SPREAD SOMETHING.

I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE
SHOULD WORK -- IT'S WORTH DOING.

SO HE HOLDS THAT FATE.

DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICANS
AGREEING ON THAT.

THEY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY
WANTED.

SEAN SPICER WAS HERE.

ACCORDING TO THE MILITARY, THEY
HIT ALL 13.

IT TOOKES 30 MINUTES TO LAUNCH
THE TOMAHAWKS.

SO HE IS GOING TO CARRY OUT
PAY-BACK RIGHT NOW.

THERE'S GOOD OPTIONS.

WE CAN PROTECT THEM WITH
INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO DO
SOMETHING.

WE'LL HERE FROM GENERAL JACK
KEANE AND CHRIS WALLACE.

AN ATTACK WHICH THE PRESIDENT
SAYS THERE'S NO DOUBT THE
MURDEROUS SYRIAN DICTATOR BASHAR
AL-ASSAD ORDERED.

BUT WE HELP THAT WILL NOT BE
NECESSARY.

IF YOU LOOK IN THE BLUE DOWN
HERE, ALL OF THIS, THESE ARE
AMMO STORAGE AREAS.
