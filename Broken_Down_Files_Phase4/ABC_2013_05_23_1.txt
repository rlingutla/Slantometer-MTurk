I FEEL FORTUNATE, BUT IT
HURTS.

SHE'LL BE BACK IN THE CLASSROOM
NEXT FALL.

VIOLENT WEATHER ROLLING ACROSS
AMERICA RIGHT BEFORE THE BIG
MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND, AND A
WORRISOME WARNING TONIGHT ABOUT
THE COMING HURRICANE SEASON.

PARENTS LIKE ED KELLEY WRESTLE
WITH SURVIVOR'S GUILT.

I DON'T THINK I'M A HERO.

FUNERALS.

I THINK IT'S WHAT ANYBODY WOULD
DO.

STORM FRONT.

AND IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
TODAY, THE FIRST FUNERALS FOR
THE PEOPLE KILLED BY THAT EF-5
TORNADO AND ON WHAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL,
SOME TEACHERS RETURNED TO THE
SCENE OF SO MUCH HORROR THREE
DAYS AFTER THAT DIRECT HIT
TWISTER OUTBREAK.

AND I REALLY WISH THEY WERE
THERE BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE THEM.

I TRIED TO SAVE THEM.

THREE OF MY FRIENDS HAD
SIBLINGS THAT DIED.

KINDERGARTEN TEACHER JENNIFER
SIMONS ARRIVED BACK AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY LATE TODAY FOR
THE FIRST TIME SINCE MONDAY'S
TORNADO.

[ SHOUTING AND CHAOS ]
TODAY MANY PARENTS EXPRESSED
THEIR GRATITUDE, AN ASSEMBLY FOR
ALL THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS ON
WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST
DAY OF SCHOOL.

HER SADNESS, HIDDEN BEHIND A
SMILE.

ENDURED AND THE BRAVERY SHE
DISPLAYED, CAUGHT ON TAPE AT
BRIARWOOD WHERE OTHER TEACHERS
BATTLED DARKNESS, FEAR, FALLING
DEBRIS, AND PROTECTED CHILDREN.

TEACHER JENNIFER SIMONS, JUST
HER SECOND YEAR IN THE
CLASSROOM, HER RIGHT ARM CRUSHED
BY THE TORNADO.

AND NONE OF THEM WERE THERE.

HERE, WHERE SEVEN CHILDREN DIED,
HER SIX STUDENTS LIVED.

HER SCHOOL, JENNIFER TOLD US,
NOT HER SPIRIT.
