KATY TUR, PART OF OUR TEAM HERE
AS WELL, SHE'S BEEN LOOKING INTO
THE VICTIMS ALL DAY.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING THEM
APPEAR ON THE INTERNET INCLUDING
JUST LAST MONTH IN AN AL QAEDA
MAGAZINE "INSPIRE."

WHAT I EXPERIENCED MYSELF, I
GIVE SOMETHING TO COMFORT HIM
AND GIVE HIM HOPE AND GET HIM
OUT OF THERE AS SOON AS WE
COULD.

SHE WAS LEFT WITH SHRAPNEL IN
HER LEG AND A SHATTERED FEMUR.

THEY WERE SITTING THERE NOT
ABLE TO GET INTO THEIR HOTEL,
NOT HAVING EATEN, AND THEY
WEREN'T COMPLAINING.

YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER
DAUGHTER.

THEY AND DOZENS OF OTHERS ARE
TRYING TO RECOVER TONIGHT.

INTELLIGENCE NERVE CENTER, THE
POLICE CHIEF INSISTED HIS
CAMERAS AND OFFICERS CAN'T DO IT
ALONE.

SOMETHING JUST BLEW UP.

AS THESE HOMELAND SECURITY
BULLETINS NOTE, PRESSURE COOKERS
HAVE BEEN USED FOR DECADES IN
TERROR BOMBINGS.

WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE?

AND THEY'RE SITTING OUT THERE
AMONGST EVERYONE THAT'S WATCHING
THIS EVENT THIS MORNING.

YOU'RE HELPING TO FIND HIM TO
REUNITE HIM WITH HER.

AND THIS BREAKING NEWS ON
ANOTHER NOTE.

THE LITTLE THINGS WE COULD DO,
MY FRIENDS AND I, TO HELP PEOPLE
OUT IN THIS TRAGEDY.

HER PARENTS WERE FIRST TOLD THAT
IT WAS HER FRIEND WHO DIED,
BRIAN, BUT DOCTORS HAD TO RETURN
AND TELL THEM IT WAS KRYSTLE WHO
PASSED AWAY.

BOTH WERE LATER DEEMED SAFE.

HIS MOM AND SISTER RIGHT NOW ARE
IN VERY BAD SHAPE.

WELL, I THINK YOUR REPORTS
ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE
INVESTIGATION ARE PRETTY
THOROUGH.

JUST DIDN'T SEEM REAL.
