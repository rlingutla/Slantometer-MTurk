YESTERDAY THIS RUSSIAN WARSHIP
PASSED THROUGH TURKISH WATERS
HEADING TOWARDS THE SYRIAN
COAST.

I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR BOMBING
WILL LEAD TO PEACE.

BY ALL ACCOUNTS PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S VERY PLEASED THAT HIS
DECISION TO STRIKE AND WITH HOW
IT'S PLAYING OUT.

WAR HAS CAUSED THESE REFUGEES
TO FLEE SO WILL MORE WAR
ACCELERATE OR ACCENTUATE THE
CURRENT INVOLVEMENT?

I WOULD SAY THERE WOULD BE MORE
DEATHS AND MORE REFUGEES.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOVE TO STRIKE
THE SYRIAN AIRBASE WINNING
PRAISE FROM OUR ALLIES AROUND
THE WORLD WHILE RUSSIA AND IRAN
ARE PREVENTING THE ATTACK --
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK.

SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE
THE RIGHT FIRST STEP AND I THINK
HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

WE BEGIN WITH KRISTIN FISHER WHO
IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
THIS WEEKEND AT MAR-A-LAGO IN
FLORIDA AND KRISTIN IT'S BEEN
OVER 48 HOURS SINCE HE TOOK HIS
VERY FIRST BIG MILITARY ACTION
AS PRESIDENT.

JULIE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
EXPECT MORE AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES
AGAINST ASSAD REGIME BECAUSE IT
SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS HINTED THAT THERE ARE MORE
TO COME AND OF COURSE THEIR
POLICY AT THIS POINT AT LEAST
WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE
CLEAR IS THAT HE DOESN'T PLAN ON
MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

THE SAUDI TEAM CALLED A
COURAGEOUS ACT AND SPRAYS BY
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON
CAPITOL HILL.
