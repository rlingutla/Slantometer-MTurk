I KEPT DOING CHEST
COMPRESSIONS WITH ONE ARM UNTIL
I NOTICED I WAS STARTING TO
VANDERSTAY HIT BY A BULLET AND
SHRAPNEL.

AND IN THE CORNER, A PILE OF 17
MAGAZINES HOLDING 100 ROUNDS
EACH.

COUPLED WITH EASY ACCESS TO THE
POWERFUL WEAPONS HE BEGAN TO
ACCUMULATE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO,
A DEADLY COMBINATION.

AND HE RODE WITH HIM IN A TRUCK
ALL THE WAY TO THAT E.R.

JIMMY GROVER, A 25-YEAR-OLD
PARAMEDIC FROM ORANGE COUNTY,
CALIFORNIA, WAS HERE IN LAS
VEGAS VISITING.

IT'S COMING OUT OF A WINDOW.

TONIGHT HERE, THE LIST OF
HEROES, AND WHAT HAPPENED IN
THAT VERY SAME HOSPITAL ROOM
TODAY.

WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE
SURVIVORS.

A SON, WHO WAS AT THE CONCERT
SHOT, AND THEN SAVED BY A YOUNG
MAN WHO HELD PRESSURE TO HIS
WOUNDS ALL THE WAY TO THE
HOSPITAL, STAYING NEXT TO HIM IN
THE E.R.

PADDOCK ALSO INSTALLING HIS OWN
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.

WE'D LOVE TO FIND THAT FELLA.

CECILIA, THE PRESIDENT SAID ANY
DISCUSSION ABOUT GUNS WILL COME
DOWN THE ROAD TODAY, BUT ON
CAPITOL HILL TODAY, THERE WAS A
ALREADY A LOT OF FOCUS ON WHAT
ARE CALLED BUMP STOCK
ATTACHMENTS THAT MATT REPORTED
ON, THAT CAN ESSENTIALLY TURN
ASSAULT RIFLES INTO AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS WHEN THEY'RE ATTACHED.

AND THERE IS WORD TONIGHT THAT
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND TWO
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS ARE TALKING
ABOUT LEGISLATION TO BAN THEM?

WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THAT TODAY.

BUT FOR SOME REASON, HE DIDN'T
PURSUE THE PLAN, INSTEAD, HE
WAITED A WEEK FOR THE HARVEST
FESTIVAL.

AND TONIGHT, THE SURVIVOR'S
FAMILY AND THE HERO'S FAMILY,
ALL TOGETHER AFTER THE HORROR.

JUST AS WE ALSO SEE THE POLICE
RESPONSE THROUGH THEIR BODY
CAMS.

SOME WERE VERY, VERY BADLY
WOUNDED AND THEY WERE BADLY
WOUNDED BECAUSE THEY REFUSED TO
LEAVE, THEY WANTED TO HELP
OTHERS, BECAUSE THEY SAW PEOPLE
GOING DOWN ALL OVER.

MIND STILL, IT JUST -- HAUNTS
THE MAN WHO HE SAYS SAVED HIS
LIFE.

SOMEHOW, HE WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY
AND TELL THE TACTICAL TEAM THAT
PADDOCK WAS IN ROOM 135.
