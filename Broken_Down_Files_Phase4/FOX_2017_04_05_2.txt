THAT MAY NOT WORK ANY TIME SOON
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE UN PRECEDE
PRECEDENTED.

THAT TOO IS A WAR CRIME.

WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
INNOCENT BABIES, BABY, LITTLE
BABIES, WITH A CHEMICAL GAS THAT
IS SO LETHAL THAT PEOPLE WERE
SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT GAS IT WAS,
THAT CROSSES MANY, MANY LINES,
BEYOND A RED LINES.

WHILE THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS
APPROACH TO BASSER AL-ASSAD, IT
SHOWS HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TRUST
OF THE PLAYER THERE'S IN SYRIA.

BECAUSE IT WAS A BLANK THREAT.

THIS IS PURSUED BY.

REPORTING, HUGH WOULD A
STATEMENT LIKE THIS IN THAT
SETTING, ACCOMPANIED BY THAT
WORLD LEADER, BE RECEIVED IN
TEHRAN, MOSCOW, DAMASCUS?

WHEN ADD IN SYRIA'S ACTIONS
CROSSED A RED LINE, HE SAID
THIS.

IT DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN
THAT.

IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST MAJOR
OVERSEAS CRISES THAT HE'S HAD TO
DEAL WITH AND THE FIRST TIME
HE'S HAD TO TRANSLATE THE TOUGH
TALK ABOUT DEALING WITH
ADVERSARIES AND DEALING WITH
DIFFICULT DECISIONS INTO ACTUAL
ACTION.

THIS COULD BE A GAME CHANGER
IN THE POSTURE TOWARDS SYRIA.

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'VE
NOTICED ABOUT ME IS MILITARILY,
I DON'T LIKE TO SAY WHERE I'M
GOING, WHAT I'M DOING.

TRUMP VERY RELUCTANT TO SHOW ANY
LEG ON THAT AT THE WHITE HOUSE
TODAY.

IT'S ALREADY HAPPENED, HIS
ATTITUDE AND SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS
CHANGED.

IT'S CLEAR THIS ATTACK YESTERDAY
IN SYRIA HAS HAD A PROFOUND
IMPACT ON THE PRESIDENT.

THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED
STATES.

IT'S EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER THIS
WILL AFFECT HOW TRUMP IS
AFFECTING THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA
AND THE FIGHT AGAINST THE
ISLAMIC STATE GROUP IN SYRIA,
WHICH PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID
IS HIS TOP PRIORITY.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE
PRESIDENT HAS BLAMED BARBER
AL-ASSAD FOR KILLING HIS OWN
PEOPLE.

BUT TALK IS TALK.

WHAT DOES THIS SIGNAL TO YOU AND
HOW WOULD THIS SIGNAL BE
RECEIVED IN YOUR MIND IN THOSE
CAPITOLS OF DAMASCUS, MOSCOW AND
BEYOND?
