WE HAVE VIDEO FROM EARLIER
WHERE THE DEBRIS FIELD WAS
SPINNING AROUND AND POPPED UP
ON THE SCREEN.

ANYBODY YOU KNOW GET HIT BY
THAT OR WERE PEOPLE PRETTY MUCH
TUCKED INSIDE?

MOMENTS AGO WE HAD ENORMOUS
TOUCHDOWN AND I'M SEEING
REPORTS OF DAMAGE.

HE IS IN THE RAIN AND HAIL UP
HERE NOT TOO FAR FROM GAIL
OKAY.

THANK YOU.

AND NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE
THE VIDEO COME IN FROM
STRINGERS.

THIS IS SHOWING THE DEBRIS
FIELD AND THIS REALLY
COMMUNICATES TO THE FORECASTING
EXPERTS AND I KNOW JANICE DEAN
IS WATCHING THIS, THIS
COMMUNICATES THE SIZE AND POWER
OF THIS TYPE OF MONSTER HITTING
THE GROUND.

DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN AND OUT
FROM OKLAHOMA AND NOW ADD IOWA
TO THE LIST OF PEOPLE NOW
MILLIONS OF THEM WHO NEED TO BE
ON THE LOOKOUT.

FOX URGENT.

YOU ARE TALKING WITH US.

OKLAHOMA IS THE AREA I WANT
TO FOCUS IN WITH THE VISUALS OF
THE FUNNEL CLOUDS DROPPING FROM
THE SKY.

ALREADY SEE SOME GUSTY WINDS
EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THAT
TORNADO.

HARRIS WE ARE ON THE PHONE
OBVIOUSLY HEADING UP I-35.

EARLIER ON TODAY THE
THUNDERSTORMS CLEARED AND THEN
THE SUN COMES OUT AND HEATS UP
THE ATMOSPHERE AGAIN.

THAT IS PART OF THAT CELL AS I
MENTIONED THAT IS ACTUALLY
SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY
BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT THESE TWO
MAJOR CELLS IF YOU LOOK AT THE
RADAR THAT ARE SPAWNING THE
TORNADOES.

OKLAHOMA REALLY RIGHT NOW FOR
TORNADO ACTIVITY THIS AREA NO
STRANGE TO TORNADOES BUT THEY
KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN THE SIREN
COMBOSS   GO UP.

IT IS SURREAL.

WITH THE WIND THAT BLOWS IN
OKLAHOMA IT CAN CERTAINLY BLOW
HE A PIECE OF HAIL THAT BIG
INTO A WINDOW SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE NEAR THE WINDOWS WHEN
THAT IS FALLING EITHER.

SO YOU ARE IN CHARGE OF KEEPING
PEOPLE SAFE.

TAKING A LOOK AT THE SEVERE
THREAT FROM TEXAS ALL THE WEIGH
UP TO THE MIDWEST THE GREAT
LAKES WITH THE CONCENTRATED
RISK OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS.
