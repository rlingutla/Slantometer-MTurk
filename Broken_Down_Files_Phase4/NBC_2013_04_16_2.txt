HE RECALLED HIS WIFE'S WORDS OF
COMFORT AS HE CALMED JEFF
BAUMANN JR.
BAUMANN LOST HIS LOWER LEGS BUT
SURVIVED.

IT WAS BLAST INJURIES TO THE
LOWER EXTREMITIES FOR THE MOST
PART.

IT'S A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE AND
BLOODY LESSON WE'RE HAVING TO
LEARN THIS TIME.

HE SNAPPED THESE PICTURES IN
RAPID SEQUENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER
THE FIRST EXPLOSION.

THE NEXT MAJOR MARATHON IS THIS
SUNDAY IN LONDON.

I CAME DOWN.

29-YEAR-OLD KRYSTLE CAMPBELL OF
MEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS.

CROWD WATCHING THE MARATHON WITH
HIS PARENTS, 11-YEAR-OLD BROTHER
AND 5-YEAR-OLD SISTER CLOSE TO
WHERE THE BLAST WENT OFF.

PETER DEANDRADE LIVES TWO BLOCKS
FROM WHERE THE BOMBS WENT OFF.

IT'S A PAINFUL ONE.

PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE SHUT DOWN.

IT IS ONE OF COUNTLESS IMAGES
THAT CAPTURED THE DAY, IMAGES
AUTHORITIES HOPE ALSO CAPTURED
THE BOMBERS.

WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE PEOPLE
THAT THEY'RE WATCHING.

EVERYBODY THAT KNEW HER LOVED
HER.

GOVERNOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING
WITH US.

THE BADGE TODAY.

A VIEW THAT CHANGES IN AN
INSTANT.

IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY
HORRIBLE SCENE, AND WHAT WE WERE
ABLE TO DO IS PULL TOGETHER WHAT
WE NEEDED TO PULL TOGETHER IN A
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

MEDALS HOPELESSLY TARNISHED BY
TRAGEDY.

THE RIVALRY TAKES A BREAK.
