THEN THEY CAN USE THE
SYSTEM TO GO BACK IN TIME
AND SCRUTINIZE EVERY
DECISION YOU EVER MADE.

LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF
THE ISSUE ARE DISAGREEING
ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS A
MASSIVE GOVERNMENT
OVERREACH.

IF I WANT TO COMPARE THE
HERO A PERSON WHO STOPPED
THAT ATTACK AS HE WAS
TRYING TO CARRY OUT THE
UNITED STATES.

THESE PROGRAMS ARE
WITHIN THE LAW.

WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
GOING AFTER A TERRORIST.

HE IS PUTTING AMERICAN
LIVES AT RISK.

PEOPLE THAT IS SOMEWHAT OF
HERO, MAYBE ACCUSING THE
GOVERNMENT OF OVERREACH.

WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS
AN AGREEMENT TO GO WITH
THAT JOURNALIST.

KING IS MEMBER OF THE HOUSE
HOMELAND SECURITY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHAT
ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT THE
SECRET SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM?

IS THAT A DEFENSE POSSIBLY
FOR HIM?

RIGHT NOW, SARA BREATHING
WITH THE HELP OF A
VENTILATOR.

A REPORT HAS BEEN FILED AND
THAT IS FIRST STEP TOWARD A
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

THERE IS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
AND ESPECIALLY THE FISA
COURT.

NSA IS PRETTY MUCH AWARE
WHAT HE TOOK WITH HIM.

NOW THAT SOMEONE HAS COME
FORWARD, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

THAT IS POWERFUL TERM.

HE HAS DISCLOSED TOP SECRET
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

BECAUSE IT'S CHINA IT WILL
BE A POLITICAL AS WELL AS
LEGAL -- IF THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT WANTS TO
COOPERATE WITH THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, SNOWDEN
WILL BE ON PLANE U.S.

UNFORTUNATELY FOR MR. SNOWDEN
HAS CAUSED FAR MORE
PROBLEMS FOR HIMSELF AND HE
HAS DEFECTED.

WE DO KNOW THIS IS A
SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE
TERRITORY OF CHINA AND
THERE IS EXTRADITION
BETWEEN HONG KONG AND THE
UNITED STATES.
