THIS WILL BE A MARSHALL PLAN
SCALE REBUILDING OF THE
ELECTRICAL GRID BEFORE YOU CAN
HAVE THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS
WE KNOW IT IN PUERTO RICO.

A WI-FI HOT SPOT.

THERE'S CLEANUP AND RECOVERY IN
PUERTO RICO, AND IN TEXAS, AND
OF FLORIDA, AND A LONG, LONG
LIST COMING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

THERE IS NO OVERSTATING THE
CRISIS HERE, THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD COME.

I LIVED IN THE VERY HOUSE WHEN I
WAS A TEENAGER.

IT IS BECAUSE -- EIGHT HUGE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO BE
LIKE, SHEP.

CELL PHONES ARE TOUGH.

IMAGINE A MONTH FROM NOW OR TWO
MONTHS FROM NOW.

SCHOOLS ARE CLOSER, BY THE WAY.

ARMED GUARDS ON THE GASOLINE.

THIS COMES DAYS AFTER THE STORM
SLAMMED PUERTO RICO, LEAVING
BEHIND DESTRUCTION AND I CANNOT
POWER IT TO EVERYBODY THERE.

THEY ARE SAYING THAT 4-6 MONTHS
BEFORE THEY GET THE POWER GRID
UP AND RUNNING SO PEOPLE WOULD
GENERATORS, THIS WILL BECOME A
SYMBOL OF WHAT THEY BECOME
TODAY.

OFFICIALS HAD MANDATORY
EVACUATION SEVERAL ISLAND
STARTING TODAY.

IT WAS PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION, BY
INCOMPETENCE, BY SCANDALOUS
DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE PURCHASING
FUEL OIL, PURCHASED THE LOW
WAS GREAT, IT SOLD FOR THE
HIGHEST.

TO BRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN
AND THEY ARE NOBLE PEOPLE, AND
ARE HELPING, BUT WITH THIS
ISLAND NEEDS IS AN ENTIRE NEW
POWER GRID.

WITHOUT GAS, THEY CAN'T RUN THE
GENERATORS THAT THE FEW HAVE TWO
POWER THE WATER PUMPS THAT ALLOW
THEM NOT ONLY TO GET WATER TO
BATHE AND DRINK, BUT ALSO TO RUN
THE TOILET.

ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK INTO THIS
CRISIS.

PEOPLE THERE ARE GROWING MORE
DESPERATE BY THE HOUR.

THEN CAME THE MUCH MORE SAVAGE,
POWERFUL HURRICANE MARIA, AND
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED
THIS ISLAND.
