POINT THERE IS A SUBWAY
STOP 30 YARDS WHERE WE ARE
GOING TONIGHT IN BOYLSTON
STREET.

A MOVING SCENE AT LAST
NIGHT'S BOSTON BRUINS
HOCKEY GAME.

AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS IF
THEY INDEED ARE
RESPONSIBLE.

WHEN WE WENT BACK AND
STARTING INVESTIGATED THE
"U.S.S. COLE" BOMBING, THE
BAD GUYS HAD LEASED A ROOM
HAD A SAFE HOUSE NOT FARM
FROM THE HARBOR.

WE ARE WATCHING ENORMOUS
DEVELOPMENT IN A MARATHON
ATTACK ONLY TWO HOURS AGO
THE FBI RELEASING VIDEO OF
TWO SUSPECTS AT THE SCENE
OF MONDAY'S BOMBINGS AND
THEY CALLED THEM SUSPECTS.

I MEAN SOMEBODY PUT THESE
BOMBS DOWN THERE AND THE
FBI SEEMS PRETTY SURE THAT
IT'S THESE TWO GUYS.

SUSPECTS FOR THE FIRST TIME
AFTER THE BOMBING ON MONDAY
IN THE BOSTON MARATHON.

WELL, BILL, ONE OF THE
FIRST THINGS THAT STRUCK ME
IS GONE IS THIS DISCUSSION
OF PERSON OF INTEREST OR
PEOPLE WITH WHOM THE
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS WANT
TO SPEAK.

IF THEY DID CALL.

WITH WILL MORE IN A MOMENT
IN THE BREANTS IN BOSTON.

I THINK I HEARD EARLIER ONE
OF YOUR REPORTERS EARLIER
MENTIONED THINK ABOUT THE
CAPS.

BILL GOOD AFTERNOON FORMER
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN
CHARGE THE FBI IN NEW YORK
NOW MAKES HIM HOME HERE IN
NEW YORK.

BILL, THE FBI HAS
ALREADY PROCESSED THOUSANDS
OF LEADS AND TIPS AND NO
DOUBT WILL GET MANY
THOUSANDS MORE.

THE FBI ASKING FOR HELP NOW
TRACKING DOWN TWO SUSPECTS
IN MONDAY'S BOMBINGS AT THE
MARATHON HERE IN BOSTON.

BECAUSE AS THE FBI PUT IT
TODAY, SOMEBODY KNOWS WHO
THESE GUYS ARE.

WHEN THAT KIND OF THING
COMES OUT.

THEY HAD AN I.D.

THE FBI RELEASING PICTURES
OF THE MEMBER IT CALLS
SUSPECTS.

INCREDIT DIB CLEAR THESE
TWO SUSPECTS AT ONE POINT
THEY ARE SEEING ONE WALK
BEHIND THE OTHER NEAR THE
FINISH LINE.

AND DAYS UNTIL THESE MEN
ARE CAUGHT.
