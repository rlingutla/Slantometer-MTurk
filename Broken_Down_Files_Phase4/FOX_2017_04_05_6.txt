IF HE IS INDEED CHANGING THE
WAY HE VIEWS ASSAD AND CHANGING
FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN
MULTIPLE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING THAT IT
WAS NO LONGER A U.S.

I'VE BEEN WATCHING IT AND SEEING
IT.

THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A
THEME.

IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A POWERFUL
ALLY WITH THE KING OF JORDAN
STANDING AT THE PRESIDENT'S
STRIDE WHO IS STRIDENT IN HIS
CONDEMNATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IN
SYRIA.

BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN HE NEEDS TO
MAKE ASSAD THE FOCUS OPEN
AMERICAN REGIME CHANGE.

THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT SPECIFIC.

THAT IT'S NOW HIS
RESPONSIBILITY, AND THAT HE WILL
ACT.

PEOPLE ARE HEARTENED TO HEAR THE
PRESIDENT SO FORCEFULLY, TALKING
IN EMOTIONAL TERMS ABOUT THE
VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK.

THAT'S WORLD WAR DEFINED.

WE DID NOT MAKE REGIME CHANGE A
FOREIGN POLICY GOAL.

THE SYRIAN DICTATOR'S BARREL
BOMBS HAVE KILLED TENS OF
THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS
INCLUDING WOMEN AND BABIES IN
THEIR BEDS.

UNCLEAR WHAT HE WILL DO.

CONSIDERING AS NIKKI HALEY
SEEMED TO SUGGEST AT THE
SECURITY COUNCIL OR IF IT'S
GOING TO BE MORE RHETORIC THAT
DOESN'T AMOUNT TO ANYTHING.

I AGREE WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT
YOU WERE JUST ENGAGED IN WITH
YOUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS ON
WHETHER TRUMP HAS TAKEN A WHOLE
NEW PERSPECTIVE ON ASSAD.

IT WAS A HORRIBLE THING.

OF THIS WE'RE SURE.

WHEN YOU CAN CONSIDER WHAT THE
OPTICS OF THIS ARE, JORDAN, THE
UNITED STATES, SYRIAN REBELS
AGAINST THE RUSSIANS AND
IRANIANS.

THE ADMINISTRATION SAID THAT
REGIME CHANGE WAS NOT A
PARTICULAR PRIORITY FOR THE U.S.
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESIDENT
MAY BE CHANGING HIS MIND, IF NOT
ON REGIME CHANGE, AT LEAST IN
THE UNITED STATES APPROACH TO
AL-ASSAD.

WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING ALREADY
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT
ARE LOOKING TO THE U.S. FOR
LEADERSHIP.

WE'VE HAD THAT AS OUR FORMAL
POLICY SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA
ARTICULATED THAT IN 2007.
