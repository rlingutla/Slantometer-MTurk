WHILE MICHELLE IS DOING THAT
YOU CAN SEE ON THE CHASE NET
TWO RIGHT THERE ON THE
RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN
THE TORNADO IS RIGHT BEHIND THE
BILL BILLION BOARD RIGHT BEHIND
THE SIGN RIGHT THERE.

HAS IT HELPED AT ALL TODAY
THAT THIS HAPPENED DURING THE
DAY TIME HOURS?

WHAT WAS GOING ON?

IT WAS MUGGY AND STIFLING.

SO FAR TODAY JUST OUR COVERAGE
ALONE WE COUNTED IS SEVERAL OF
THEM.

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE
THIS MAYOR BREWER.

IT IS MORE FRIGHTENING AT NIGHT
TO PUT THE EMERGENCY PLANS INTO
PLACE BECAUSE PEOPLE TEND TO
KIND OF SLACK OFF ON THAT.

WHAT WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THE
SEVERAL DAY EVENT IS THE HUGE
BUILDING.

THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE TULSA
AREA.

MAYOR BREW ARE ARE YOU WITH
US?

THERE IS RED ALL OVER THE MAP
AND THAT MEAN THERE'S IS
DANGER.

TODAY.

AND NOW WE ARE LEARNING MORE
ABOUT THIS.

LET'S GO AHEAD AND THE DOUGHNUT
HOLE THAT YOU SEE RIGHT THERE
THIS IS THE ACTUAL RADAR SITE.
