WE KNOW PIPE BOMBS WERE
FOUND TODAY IN CAMBRIDGE.

SO WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY
HAVE GOTTEN SOMEONE BUT IT
SEEMS THAT SOMETHING BIG
HAPPENED HERE.

I DIDN'T COUNT THEM BUT
THAT SOUNDED ABOUT RIGHT.

NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT'S
ON SCENE.

WE ARE GETTING WORD IN
RIGHT NOW FROM SOURCES AS
WELLING.

WE ARE SEEING FAMILIES
BEING EVACUATED.

BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING MORE
INFORMATION AS THIS COMES
IN.

RIGHT NOW WE KNOW SUSPECT
NUMBER 2 IS ALIVE.

THIS WAS ALL DAY PRESENCE.

SO WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON
ALL OF THIS AS IT IS
STARTING TO SINK IN.

THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT
NOW.

THEN WE HAD REPORTS THAT
POLICE CARS WERE LEAVING
CRYSTAL HAINES IS ON THE
PHONE.

HOW FAR AWA
HOME FROM THE CURRENT SCENE
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT ON
FRANKLIN STREET.

WE KNOW THE PRESSURE COOKER
BOMBS THAT WERE USED IN THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT HE
TOO HAS AN INJURY AGAIN
THIS WAS 67 FRANKLIN STREET
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US
IN WATER TOWN WHERE SUSPECT
NUMBER 2 FROM THE BOSTON
MARATHON BOMBING IS
APPARENTLY IN THAT BOAT
THAT YOU SEE RIGHT THERE
WITH THE TARP UNDER HIM.

WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
MANPOWER TO LOCKDOWN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.

SO WE JUST WENT A BACK WAY
ON RUSSELL AVE.
WE GO DOWN FRANKLIN STREET
AS WE WERE APPROACHING
AUBURN STREET, ALL WE HEARD
WAS GUNFIRE.

FINALLY THE DOG CAN GO OUT
FOR A WALK AND YOU HEARD
ALL OF THIS.

WE CAN SEE THE FLASH AS
WELL.

THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
MARK, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT
THIS SUSPECT LIKED BOMBS.
