GOOD AFTERNOON FROM FOX NEWS IN
NEW YORK, A LIVE LOOK WHERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MEETING SOME
OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS, THE
HEROS OF THE ATTACK OUTSIDE THE
MANDALAY BAY AT THE COUNTRY
MUSIC FESTIVAL SUNDAY NIGHT.

THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT
SUGGESTED OVER TIME PRESIDENT
TRUMP THAT USED TO BE MUCH MORE
LIBERAL IN MANHATTAN WAS --
MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE FOR GUN
CONTROL AT A TIME BEFORE HIS
PRESIDENCY.

WE DON'T NEED TO GO FURTHER THAN
THAT.

THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND HOW
THEY REACTED TO THIS SITUATION
PROVIDED SO MANY LOVE AND CARE
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HARMED
BY THIS HORRIBLE INCIDENT.

I KNOW THAT HE WAS VERY TAKEN,
NOT ONLY WITH THE SCOPE AND THE
DEPTH OF THIS TRAGEDY AND THE
HORRIBLE FACT THAT SO MANY
PEOPLE WERE KILLED.

WE WILL MARCH FORWARD AS A
FAMILY, GIVING EACH OTHER
COMFORT, SUPPORT AND LOVE.

WE'RE GOING TO GET THE ANSWERS.

HE MAY BE COMING AGAIN AS WELL
DEPENDING HOW THINGS PROGRESS
WITH THE INVESTIGATION.

WE JUST WANT TO THANK YOU.
