INSIDE THE ATTACK.

ONCE THEY BLEW UP THAT DOOR,
THEY SAW THE SHOOTER HAD KILLED
HIMSELF, BUT THEY SAW HIS
ARSENAL, SO THEY KNEW THEY HAD
THEIR MAN.

LISA ROMERO, A SECRETARY AT
MIYAMURA HIGH SCHOOL IN
GALLUP, NEW MEXICO.

OFFICERS MOVING UP THE MASSIVE
GLASS TOWER.

TEAMS
JUMPED INTO ACTION TO TAKE DOWN
THE SHOOTER.

BUT FIRST, WHAT BEGAN TO PLAY
OUT SHORTLY AFTER 1000 P.M.
LOCAL TIME, RIGHT HERE IN LAS
VEGAS.

TEAM WAS PUTTING
TOGETHER THEIR PLAN.

I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND I
TOLD HIM THAT I LOVED HIM AND MY
LITTLE GIRL, IN CASE I DIDN'T
TRAPPED IN A ROOM WITH OTHERS
NEAR THE STAGE.

THE DEADLIEST MASS SHOOTING IN
MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY.

ALSO TONIGHT, HOSPITALS
OVERWHELMED WITH THE INJURED.

STRIP, FROZEN, TOTAL LOCKDOWN.

AUTHORITIES HOPE HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, WHO ONCE WORKED
AS A CASINO HOSTESS FOR HIGH-END
PLAYERS, CAN PROVIDE SOME
INSIGHT.

IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO WEIGH
IN ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE
WE HAVE ANY MORE FACTS.

HOTEL WINDOW SHOOTING AT
THOUSANDS OF HELPLESS
CONCERT-GOERS BELOW.

"I FELT HIM GET SHOT IN THE
BACK," SHE TOLD REPORTERS.

BUT THEY ALSO TWEETED THIS
TODAY, SAYING WE ARE IN NEED OF
CERTIFIED TRAUMA COUNSELORS.

SONNY MELTON, A TENNESSEE
HUSBAND AND NURSE.

EVEN SAYING TODAY, NO PARKING
TICKETS.

BUT PERHAPS, WHAT'S MOST
STRIKING ABOUT THIS SHOOTING IS
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WHERE THAT
STORY OF THE MANDALAY, AND THAT
CONCERT BELOW, YOU CAN SEE,
ABOUT 40 YARDS AWAY FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING.

IT WAS NON-STOP SURGERY AFTER
SURGERY UNTIL ABOUT 430, 5:00
THIS MORNING.
