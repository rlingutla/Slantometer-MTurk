THOUGH JIM TOLD ME HE HAD
TO HOLD ON TO THAT DOOR
BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE THE
TORNADO WAS TRYING TO SUCK
IT OPEN AND SUCK THEM OUT.

AN X MEANS THAT THEY HAVE
SEARCHED THE VEHICLE AND
THERE IS NOBODY INSIDE.

SO SHEP, THEY GOT TO
COLOR, WHICH IS GOOD FOR
EVERYONE HERE TO SEE.

SHE ADDED SIX MORE
CHILDREN.

SALVATION ARMY OFFICIALS
SAY THAT THEY HAVE
DISPATCHED RESPONSE TEAMS
AND SET UP MOBILE FOOD
STATIONS TO GET REALLY
WHATEVER THEY CAN TO THE
VICTIMS.

BEAMS COMING DOWN, METAL IN
THE TREES.

OKLAHOMA STRONG.

HE ALSO TOLD ME HE IS NOT
WEARING A JACKET TODAY
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FIND
HIS CLOSET.

WE SAW HOW WELL THAT DID
DURING THIS TORNADO.

WE APPRECIATE IT REALLY
DO.

SHE SAID THAT THE SCHOOL
FELL DOWN.

SO SHE WENT TO THE SCHOOL
AND PICKED MY GRAND KIDS UP
FROM SCHOOL.

SHE DID THE RIGHT THING.

WHEN THE FIGHTING ENDED
THE ANGEL OF THE
BATTLEFIELD DISCOVERED THE
SWISS BASED RED CROSS
NETWORK WHILE VISITING
EUROPE.

IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT
WE WILL GET THERE.

MEANWHILE, IN TERMS OF THE
PRESIDENT WE DON'T KNOW
YET WHEN HE WILL GO.

HE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO
HIT THE STREETS SEARCH THE
ENTIRE COMMUNITY AT LEAST
TWICE MORE, JUST TO BE
SURE.

THE SCHOOL WHERE THE
TORNADO -- WELL, THE
TORNADO THE SCHOOL TORNADO
FLATTENED.

TONIGHT SEARCH CREWS AND
SEARCH LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
BURIED ALIVE ONE DAY AFTER
THE TORNADO SCRAPED THE
LANDSCAPE RAW.

WE HAVE SALVAGED SOME
PICTURES AND SOME CLOTHES
AND EVERYTHING ELSE I JUST
COUNT IT AS A LOSS.
