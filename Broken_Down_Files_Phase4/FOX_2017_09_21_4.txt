IT'S PEOPLE TAKING RUBBISH FROM
HURRICANE IRMA AND TRYING TO USE
IT TO PROP UP A POWER LINE THAT
WAS DOWNED BY HURRICANE MARIA.

OLDER PEOPLE GETTING HELP.

CHIEF METEOROLOGIST RICK
REICHMUTH IN THE EXTREME WEATHER
CENTER.

USING ONE HURRICANE TO HELP
ANOTHER.

THEY'RE WITHOUT ELECTRIC POWER.

HELP IS ON THE WAY FROM FEMA AND
FROM THE COAST GUARD.

THE STRONGEST HURRICANE
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER TO HIT PUERTO
RICO IN MORE THAN 80 YEARS.

THIS IS TYPICAL DAMAGE, I'M
TOLD.

THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
HERE IN THE U.S. REPORTS THAT
MARIA IS EXPECTED TO BRING
DANGEROUS WINDS, HEAVY WIND TO
THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS AND
THE BAHAMAS LATER TODAY.

THINK HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO
FREE UP THIS ROAD AND FREE UP
THE POWER LINES?

THE PEOPLE ARE RESILIENT.

LET'S GET MORE ON THE
HURRICANE'S PATH.
