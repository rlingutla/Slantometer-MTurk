AS SOON AS HIS MEDICAL CONDITION
ALLOWS, ABOUT WHETHER HE HAD ANY
ACCOMPLICES OR OVERSEAS
CONNECTIONS.

THIS AFTERNOON, I SPOKE WITH
WATERTOWN POLICE CHIEF ED DEVOE
ABOUT THE LARGER IMPLICATIONS OF
WHAT HIS OFFICERS ACCOMPLISHED.

THE YOUNGER SUSPECT, DZHOKHAR
TSARNAEV, CAPTURED LIVE LAST
NIGHT, IS UNDER GUARD AT A
BOSTON HOSPITAL.

THEY FRAMED THEM AND THEY WERE
SO COWARDLY THAT THEY SHOT THE
BOY DEAD.

LIZ NORDEN'S TWO SONS EACH LOST
A LIMB NEAR THE FINISH LINE.

I DO THINK THE POLICE
PRESENCE IS NECESSARY.

IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

AND NOBODY'S GOING TO
DICTATE.

YOU WANT TO HAVE PERHAPS MORE
DOGS, MORE UNDERCOVER AGENTS.

THIS IS A BIG MYSTERY.

THE GREATER BOSTON AREA
SHUT DOWN.

BOTH WERE ATHLETIC.

I DON'T KNOW WHO EXACTLY FRAMED
THEM, BUT THEY DID.

AUTHORITIES BELIEVE HIS OLDER
BROTHER, TAMERLAN, KILLED IN A
GUN BATTLE EARLY FRIDAY MORNING
WHILE WEARING EXPLOSIVES
STRAPPED TO HIS CHEST, MAY HAVE
INSTIGATED THE PLOT AND
PERSUADED DZHOKHAR TO JOIN HIM,
BUT WHY?

WATERTOWN RESIDENT
DAVE HENNEBERRY HAD SEEN
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS IN THE BOAT
IN HIS BACKYARD.

WE DON'T BACK DOWN.

THE FBI AS YOU HEARD SAID AFTER
INTERVIEWING TAMERLAN AT
RUSSIA'S REQUEST IN 2011, THEY
SOUGHT AND FAILED TO GET MORE
INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA'S
INTELLIGENCE AND STATE SECURITY
AGENCIES, SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS
STILL TO ANSWER.

OFFICIALS SAY 33-YEAR-OLD
TRANSIT OFFICER RICHARD DONOHUE
WAS SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES DURING
THE GUNFIGHT WITH THE TSARNAEV
BROTHERS IN WATERTOWN, TONIGHT,
IN SERIOUS CONDITION.

TAMERLAN FLEW TO RUSSIA FOR SIX
MONTHS.

CHILDREN STILL FLOCKED TO MRS.
MALLARD AND HER DUCKLINGS IN THE
PUBLIC GARDEN, BUT PARENTS ARE
NOT AS CAREFREE.
