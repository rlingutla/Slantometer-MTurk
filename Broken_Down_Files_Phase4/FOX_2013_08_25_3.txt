NO, THE SYRIANS THINK
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS WEAK AND ARE
TRYING TO BULLY HIM.

THE REPORTED CHEMICAL ATTACK IN
SYRIA'S CAPITAL CITY, KILLING
HUNDREDS.

CRUISE MISSILES LIKE THE
ONES I AM ABOUT TO SHOW YOU ARE
ONE OF THE WEAPONS IN OUR
ARSENAL.

THAT IS BLUNT.

LET'S TALK ON THE SUBJECT
MATTER OF OTHER COUNTRIES
ISSUING THREATS TO AMERICA,
SHOULD IT GET INVOLVED OUTSIDE
THE BOUNDS OF THE UNITED
NATIONS.

AMERICAN WAR SHIPS SITTING NOT
FAR FROM SYRIA.

I THINK THE REAL PROBLEM FOR THE
UNITED STATES IS THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION IS REACTING MORE
OUT OF POLITICAL CONCERN THAN
FROM STRATEGIC THINKING.

A COUPLE HOURS AGO, WE
LEARNED THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH
THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE TODAY.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
HAS ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COLLEAGUES
OVER THE WEEKEND.

I BELIEVE THE RUGS DON'T WANT
CHEMICAL WEAPONS USED, AS DOES
THE UNITED STATES, SO WE DO HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY, I HOPE THE
PRESIDENT WILL TRY TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF.

AS YOU KNOW, WORLD GOVERNMENTS,
INCLUDING OUR OWN, ARE PONDERING
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR
IN SYRIA CREATING MILLIONS OF
REFUGEES, PUTTING PRESSURE ON
NEIGHBORING MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND
POTENTIALLY PUNCHING HOLES IN AN
ALREADY FRAGILE IMBALANCE THERE.

ASIDE FROM THE WRANGLING BY THE
POLITICIANS AND DIPLOMATS,
TODAY, POPE FRANCIS CALLED FOR
ACTION, URGING THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY TO STEP UP EFFORTS TO
HELP SYRIA END THE WAR.

FOX REPORT, THE LATEST
RESPONSE HERE AND OVERSEAS TO
NEW TALKS OF MILITARY
INTERVENTION AGAINST THE ASSAD
REGIME.

IF THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T ACT
WITH MASSIVE FORCE IN SYRIA, IF
IT IS JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST
TO THE ASSAD REGIME, WHICH MANY
ARE PREDICTING, I THINK THE
LESSON IRAN DRAWS FROM THAT WE
BETTER GET OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS
CAPABILITY IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE
THEN WE WILL BE IMMUNE TO AN
AMERICAN SLAP ON THE WRIST.

THE REAL PROBLEM IS THE REGIME
IN IRAN.

CURIOUS OF YOUR THOUGHTS.

AND I'LL CHANGE TOPICS JUST
SLIGHTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO ASK
YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS.

YOU ALSO SAID WE SHOULDN'T BE
INVOLVED THERE THE WAY WE ARE,
SYRIA IS A SECONDARY ISSUE.

HE RENEWED CALLS FOR THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT AND REBELS TO PUT
DOWN ARMS AND START TALKING.

U.S. OFFICIALS SAY AT THIS POINT
IT IS PROBABLY TOO LATE.
