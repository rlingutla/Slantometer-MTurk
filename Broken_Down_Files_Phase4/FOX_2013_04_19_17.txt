WE HAD LISTENED TO THE
GOVERNOR AND THE BAN WAS
LIFTED SO FOUR OF US WENT
OUT.

ALL OF A SUDDEN CARS CAME
FROM EVERYWHERE.

JARED, I JUST WANT TO
PASS ALONG TO THE AUDIENCE
BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING NEW
INFORMATION.

THE BAN WAS LIFTED ON
PEOPLE HAVING TO STAY
INDOORS.

HAD THEIR HANDS ON THEIR
HIPS WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE
THEIR GUNS OVERHEAD.

WE BELIEVE AGAIN THIS IS 67
FRANKLIN STREET IN WATER
TOWN.

NOT SURE IF THOSE ARE
RELATED.

HE IS IN A BOAT WITH A
CANVAS COVER AND SOMEBODY
WAS POKING HOLES IN THE
CANVAS COVER IN THE BOAT.

SHOOTING, THERE WAS
 JOINING US ON THE PHONE
IS MARY SULLIVAN A WITNESS
TO THE SHOOTINGS THAT JUST
TOOK PLACE EARLIER AT ABOUT
720.

I WASN'T COUNTING THEM.

THREE -- THERE WERE THREE
SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS WITH
PAUSES IN BETWEEN.

HEATHER SAID FROM HER
SOURCE FROM THE STATE
POLICE SUSPECT IS DOWN.

THIS IS FRANKLIN STREET IN
WATERTOWN.

WE SAW LAW ENFORCEMENT
STARTING TO LEAVE AND THEN
ALL OF THIS JUST UNFOLDED
SO QUICK SO FAST.

AUTHORITIES HAVE COME FROM
BOSTON AND DID IMMEDIATELY
FROM OUR POSITION IN
DOWNTOWN BOSTON WE WATCHED
THEM HEADING IN THAT
DIRECTION.

SO THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE
SURROUNDED BY LAW
ENFORCEMENT, BUT STILL
MOVING.

THE SOUNDS REMINISCENT WHEN
WE HEARD EARLIER THIS
MORNING GUN BATTLE WITH 200
GUNSHOTS FIRED AND THE
DEATH OF SUSPECT NUMBER 1.

THERE WAS A RAPID FIRE
BARRAGE.

AND AT THE SAME TIME, WFXT
IN BOSTON OUR LOCAL STATION
NUMBER OF REPORTERS THERE
ON SCENE HAD EYEWITNESS
REPORTS FROM THEIR OWN
REPORTERS AND FROM A LOCAL
RESIDENT WHO SAW THIS AND
SAID THAT THEIR ENTIRE
NEIGHBORHOOD IS NOW ON
LOCKDOWN.

THEY LISTED THE ORDER WHICH
REQUIRED PEOPLE TO SHELTER
IN PLACE.
