AS FAR AS THE MUDSLIDES GO,
ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL
MOUNTAINOUS PART OF THE COUNTRY

I HAVE EXTRA BATTERIES FOR MY
CELL PHONE BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO HAVE COMMUNICATION.

I WOULDN'T SAY WE'RE STRETCHED

FOLLOWING A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY
AS TO WHAT THE HURRICANE JOSE
HAS DONE.

YOU'LL HAVE THAT.

LET'S GO TO BROCK LONG NOW FROM
FEMA WHO BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP
BY PHONE ON HURRICANE MARIA.
