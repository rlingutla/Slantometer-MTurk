FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE SEE WHAT
STUDENTS SAW HUDDLED IN THAT
BATHROOM.

STUDENTS TELL HER, I HATE THIS.

SHE SAID SHE'LL CHERISH THIS
PHOTO.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

THEY'RE GOING TO SAVE THEIR
POSSESSIONS.

AND HE FINDS HER ALIVE.

OH, MY GOD!

AMONG THE ONLY WALL STANDING,
THAT BRICK WALL TO THE BATHROOM
WHERE HER CLASS WAS SAVED.

HER SON SAM, A FIRST GRADER, HER
DAUGHTER MARIE IN FOURTH.

♪ CAN YOU HEAR THIS SONG
♪ THE OKLAHOMA STRONG
NEWS.

THIS IS THE MOMENT THE MONSTROUS
TORNADO HIT BRIARWOOD
ELEMENTARY.

EVEN NEWCOMERS LIKE NBA STAR
KEVIN DURANT TAKE PRIDE IN OKIE
RESILIENCE.

MILE IN FRONT OF SUNDAY'S
VIOLENT STORM, WATCHING YET
ANOTHER TORNADO PLOW THROUGH RED
DIRT AND THE HOUSES BUILT ON IT,
I SILENTLY WONDERED "WHY DO I
LIVE HERE?"

AND THE 1995 OKLAHOMA CITY
BOMBING.

ARRIVES.

THE O WORD WAS EQUIVALENT TO A
DUST BOWL.

SAM, THERE'S DADDY.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.
