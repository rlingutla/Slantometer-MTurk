AND THAT'S THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS
WHERE THOSE SKILLS ARE.

THAT WAS PASSED TO THE FBI.

OR SEEMS TO BE.

THE ADMINISTRATION
ULTIMATELY BLAMED THE CIA
FOR PROVIDING BAD
INFORMATION TO THEN
AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE WHO
BLAMED A DEMONSTRATION THAT
SPUN OUT OF CONTROL FOR THE
TERRORIST ATTACK.

WAS IT DONOR FUTURE
REASONS ONLY 29%.

THE MORE NEED YOU HAVE FOR
REALLY HIGH END CAPABLE
TECHNOLOGY SKILLS.

ED HENRY HAS THAT LIVE FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE.

ED SNOWDEN SAYS THE U.S. IS
WAGING CYBER WAR ON CHINA,
HAS BEEN FOR YEARS AND HE
CAN PROVE IT.

PLUS, NEW FROM THE LEAKER.

SO A SMALL MAJORITY THERE.

WELL, SHEP OBVIOUSLY
THE BACK DROP FOR ALL OF
THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S
POLITICAL STANDING AND THE
FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE
CONTROVERSIES LIKE THE IRS
TARGETING CONSERVATIVE
GROUPS HAS HELPED FUEL THIS
ANGER TOWARDS THE
GOVERNMENT.

LOOK AT THE SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM AT THE NSA AS WELL
AND HOW THAT IS EFFECTING
THINGS.

SAYING TO THE NEWSPAPER,
AND I'M QUOTING AGAIN
LAST WEEK THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT HAPPILY OPERATED
IN THE SHADOWS WITH NO
RESPECT FOR THE CONSENT OF
THE GOVERNED.

LISTEN.

BECAUSE WE HAD STORED THAT
DATA IN A DATABASE WE
COULD TAKE THAT NUMBER AND
GO BACKWARDS IN TIME AND
SEE WHO HE WAS TALKING TO.

HE HAS BEEN IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS STORM OBVIOUSLY.

HAINES APPARENTLY HAS NO
EXPERIENCE AT THE CIA BUT
SERVED AS DEPUTY ASSISTANT
TO THE PRESIDENT AND LEGAL
ADVISOR TO THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL.

AND THEIR PHONE
RECORDS.

AND WHILE ALEXANDER SAID
THE DRILLDOWN ON AMERICAN
CITIZENS MUST BE CLEARED BY
A NATIONAL SECURITY COURT,
SENATORS SAYING IT WASN'T
ENOUGH GIVEN THE PERVASIVE
ENVIRONMENT OF MISTRUST.

FOR NOW, HE IS STILL IN
HIDING BUT FORMER CIA AGENT
MIKE BAKER SAYS NOT FOR
LONG.
