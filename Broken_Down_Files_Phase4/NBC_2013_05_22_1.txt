THE MASSIVE FUNNEL MAKES IT
HARDER TO COMPREHEND HOW SO MANY
PEOPLE SURVIVED.

BETHANY FIRST SHARED HER STORY
OF SURVIVAL WITH BRIAN AFTER SHE
AND HER HUSBAND DON RODE OUT THE
TORNADO IN THIS BATHTUB.

TRY TO SAY THE RIGHT THINGS
THAT CAN COME EVEN WHENEVER IT
DOESN'T SEEM THERE COULD BE
ANOTHER BRIGHT DAY.

BUT I GET TO LIVE IT FOR HIM,
TOO.

TRAPPED HE SCRAPED A METAL WIRE
THROUGH AN OPENING TO ATTRACT
HIS NEIGHBORS' ATTENTION.

BUT HE DIDN'T SURVIVE.

FEW HOMES IN THIS CORNER OF
TORNADO ALLEY HAVE STORM CELLARS
OR SAFE ROOMS.

THEY REPORTEDLY DIED HOLDING
ONTO EACH OTHER.

AND, YOU KNOW, HE'S MY HERO.

IT IS WHERE JAN DAVIS AND
THERESA PRICE TOOK COVER WITH 20
OTHERS.

I HOPED SHE WAS ALIVE.

DEVASTATION IS A SHORT WHILE,
BUT DETERMINATION LASTS ALL THE
TIME.

HE GOT ON TOP OF ME TO TAKE
THE BRUNT OF MOST OF IT.

WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
SUFFER, BUT WE ALSO KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO GET BACK UP.

IT'S CALLED OKLAHOMA STRONG.

MERCY HOSPITAL, A NEW FACILITY
WILL OPEN IN 2015 WITH WALLS AND
WINDOWS BUILT TO WITHSTAND 250
MILE AN HOUR WINDS.

$2 BILLION IN DAMAGE AND THIS
TOWN IS STILL BEGINNING TO
ACCEPT, UNDERSTAND, AND GRIEVE
THE LOSS OF SO MANY WHO LIVE
HERE AS WE LEARN MORE NAMES OF
THE DEAD.

NEARLY 90% OF AFFECTED
BUSINESSES ARE NOW OPEN.

I WAS JUST HOPING MAYBE SHE
MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN
UNCONSCIOUS.

HALF HIS HOUSE AND MOST OF HIS
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS GONE.
