AS YOU START TO DRIVE IN
YOU SEE THAT THIS IS
PLAYING OUT REALLY FOR
MILES AND MILES AND MILES
ALL AROUND.

THE BROWN AREA IS WHERE THE
TORNADO WAS MOVING.

BUT WE KNOW OF FOUR PEOPLE
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTING
OF THE LOCAL NBC STATION OR
I SHOULD SAY THE CBS
STATION WHO DIED WHILE
TRYING TO SHELTER IN A
FREEZER AND FOUR OTHERS WHO
DIED AT 7/11.

AS WE SEE THIS DEVASTATION
AND A BULLDOZER COME IN TO
TRY TO HE REMOVE.

WE DO THINK THE WINDS WERE
UP TO 200 MILES PER HOUR
WITH THIS PARTICULAR STORM.

OF THE OKIN WHICH IS THE
NEWSPAPER OF RECORD FOR THE
AREA.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

THIS IS BREAKING NEWS ON
FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

I'M LOOKING AT THE -- WE
SAVED OUR WEDDING PICTURES.

I MENTIONED THE STORM THAT
HIT THERE IN 1999.

THE BIG SEVERE WEATHER AT
LEAST THE OKLAHOMA CITY
AREA RIGHT NOW IS GONE.

I DON'T KNOW.

YOU SEE THAT GROUP OF
PEOPLE THEY ARE SEARCHING
FOR A FOURTH VICTIM BECAUSE
THERE WAS A THIRD LAID OUT
ON THE SIDEWALK THERE WHEN
SOME OF THE FIRST
RESPONDERS GOT HERE.

AND SO MANY OF THESE
STUDENTS SHELTERED IN PLACE
IN THE HALLS.

CONTINUE TO SEND THEM TO
US.

VOLUNTEERS AND FIRST
RESPONDERS ARE ON THE
GROUND IN MOORE LOOKING FOR
ANYBODY WHO MAY STILL BE
TRAPPED BENEATH THE DEBREE
HOPING THAT EVEN WITH THE
MAGNITUDE LIKE NOTHING WE
HAVE YEARS IN THIS NATION
THAT THEY WILL FIND ANY
NEIGHBORS FRIENDS, BAND
MEMBERS -- MEMBERS WHO MAY
BE MISSING.

THESE ARE LIVE PICTURES
ABOVE PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHERE THE
LOCAL NBC TELEVISION
STATION IS REPORTING FROM A
REPORTER ON SCENE THAT 24
CHILDREN ARE TRAPPED AND
DIED IN THIS SCHOOL IN
THIS POWERFUL TORNADOT
STRUCK IN THE MID AFTERNOON
THERE.

WE WILL BE OKAY BUT
EVERYTHING IS GONE.

IN 1999, 36 PEOPLE WERE
KILLED WHEN THE WORST
TORNADO STRIKE THIS HEART
LAND OF AMERICA HAD EVER
KNOWN FOR EVER CHANGED
THEIR LIVES.

YOU RUN AND GO DOWN INTO
THE SHELTER AND WAIT.
