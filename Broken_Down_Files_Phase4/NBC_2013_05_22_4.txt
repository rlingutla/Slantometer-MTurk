I HOPE EVERYONE'S OKAY.

TODAY WE LEARN HOW AND WHERE SO
MANY PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO HIDE,
RIDE IT OUT, AND SURVIVE THIS
ONE.

CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THEY
HAVE COUNTED UP 13,000 HOMES IN
THE PATH OF THIS ONE STORM, SOME
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY EXPRESSING
BOTH THANKS AND SURPRISE THAT
THE TOLL WASN'T EVEN HIGHER.

EMILY'S MOTHER POSTED ON
FACEBOOK, I KNOW SHE IS IN
HEAVEN SMILING DOWN.

TODAY, TOWN OFFICIALS PROPOSED
THE IDEA OF MAKING THEM
MANDATORY FOR NEW HOMES.

TWO YEARS LATER, THE VOID
REMAINS, BUT BETHANY IS GRATEFUL
FOR A SECOND CHANCE.

AT THE SAME TIME, FOLKS CONTINUE
TO MARVEL THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
WALKED OUT OF WRECKAGE LIKE THIS
ALIVE.

HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.

NOW SOME OF JOPLIN'S FIRST
RESPONDERS HAVE GONE TO MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, TO HELP OUT.

ONCE WE HAVE THE FIRST
RESPONDERS THAT COME IN CONTACT
WITH THE BODIES, ESPECIALLY
CHILDREN, THEY ARE OFFERED
DIFFERENT COUNSELING.

THE TINKER FEDERAL CREDIT UNION
BEFORE THE TORNADO AND AFTER.

THE HEAVILY REINFORCED VAULT IS
ALL THAT'S STANDING.

BRIAN, KIDS WHO ATTEND SCHOOLS
THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED HAVE
BEEN ENCOURAGED TO GO TO OTHER
SCHOOLS SO THEY CAN AT LEAST
CLOSE OUT THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH
THEIR CLASSMATES.

THE FIGURE YOU MENTIONED, 13,000
HOMES IN THE PATH, THAT'S
DESTROYED OR BADLY DAMAGED.

HOLD ON TO YOUR CAP AND GOWN.

THE BRICKS ARE A CHERISHED
SYMBOL OF ALL THAT WAS LOST TWO
YEARS AGO TODAY WHEN AN EF5
TWISTER TORE UP JOPLIN INCLUDING
THE HIGH SCHOOL.

ITS ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS SECURELY
BURIED UNDER GROUND.

CELEBRATE AS THIS TOWN REBUILDS,
BUT IT IS THE STRENGTH OF ITS
PEOPLE THAT IS THE TRUE MEASURE
OF SUCCESS.

FIRSTHAND LOOK AT THE
DEVASTATION INSIDE THE SCHOOL,
AND THE TOLL IT TOOK ON FIRST
RESPONDERS.

THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE A
FEW OF THESE OUT TO VARIOUS
FOLKS WITH TIES TO THAT
COMMUNITY.
