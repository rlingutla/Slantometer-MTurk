AND THEY FOUND ROOM FOR MANY
PEOPLE.

SO MANY OF THEM RAN FOR THE EXIT
AS YOU WOULD EXPECT AS MANY
PEOPLE WOULD.

YOU'RE ALWAYS REACTING TO THE
LAST INCIDENT.

THE SHERIFF SAYS THE GUNMAN
KILLED HIMSELF AS SWAT TEAMS
APPROACHED.

I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN YOU GUYS
ARE GOOD BUT YOU PROVED IT.

ANY TIME HE GETS IN THE SAME
ROOM WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR
MILITARY FOR THAT MATTER, HE
ALWAYS HAS THE HIGHEST PRAISE.

THAT AND WE'RE WAITING FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO COME IN AND
MEET WITH FIRST RESPONDERS,
POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS
THAT WILL MEET WITH HIM SHORTLY.

DIFFERENT PEOPLE TELLING STORIES
OF IF I DIDN'T KNOW TO CROUCH
DOWN AND WAIT AND WAIT FOR
INSTRUCTIONS OR BE RUNNING FOR
THE EXITS WHERE THE HUGE CROWDS.

I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE
FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND
ACROSS THE WORLD FOR THEIR
OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT AND
GENEROSITY THAT HAS COME HERE.

MIGHT BE SOMEBODY THERE.

BEHIND THE PRESS THERE WERE
INTEGRAL IN SAVING NUMEROUS
LIVES.

IT'S A UNIT THAT OPERATES ON
CELL SERVICE.

GET OUT OF HERE.

GO THAT WAY, GO THAT WAY.

WE HELD THOSE FLAMES OUT IN
FRONT OF US TO SHOW TRIBUTE TO
THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES
OF THIS HORRIBLE EVENT.

WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GOOD LEADS.

THE ROOM BEGINNING TO FILL WHERE
THE PRESIDENT WILL GREET THOSE
FOLKS.
