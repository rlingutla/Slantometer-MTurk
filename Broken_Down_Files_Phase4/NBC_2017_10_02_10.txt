YOU DID GOOD.

THE MORE DETAILS WE
LEARN ABOUT STEPHEN
PADDOCK, THE DEEPER
THIS MYSTERY GETS.

IT'S TOO EARLY TO KNOW
ALL THE NAMES OF THOSE
WHO HELPED OTHERS LAST
NIGHT, BUT IN THE
COMING DAYS AND WEEKS,
WE WILL.

WE HAVE AN ACTIVE
SHOOTER INSIDE THE
FAIRGROUNDS!

IN ORLANDO, 49.

IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL CRAZIEST
THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN
INSIDE OF A TRAGEDY.

WE HAVE A TEAM
ASSEMBLED TO COVER ALL
ANGLES OF THIS
DEVELOPING STORY.

SO THAT YOUNG MAN,
SOMEBODY'S SON, YOU
KNOW, PASSED AWAY
RIGHT THERE.

28-YEAR-OLD SINGLE
MOTHER JESSICA
KLEMCHUCK WAS VISITING
LAS VEGAS WITH HER
FIANCE BRENT URLAH.

AND SPECIAL EDUCATION
TEACHER SANDY CASEY.

WE HAVE AN ACTIVE
SHOOTER!

THE PRESIDENT SAID
HE'LL VISIT LAS VEGAS
ON WEDNESDAY AFTER HIS
TRIP TO
HURRICANE-RAVAGED
PUERTO RICO TOMORROW.

TONIGHT AS THE DEATH
TOLL CLIMBS, SO MANY
PEOPLE STILL SEARCHING
FOR LOVED ONES AND
ANSWERS.

1 HOUR AND 12 MINUTES
AFTER THE SHOOTING
BEGAN, THE S.W.A.T.

EVERYBODY RUNNING.

WE'RE ON THE GROUND
UNDERNEATH.

I'M WITH A YOUNG MAN
WHO DIED IN MY ARMS,
SHE WROTE ON FACEBOOK.

A FULLY AUTOMATIC
CAPABILITY BY JUST
REPLACING THE STOCK.

BROTHER ERIC PADDOCK
SAYS THE FAMILY NEVER
SAW IT COMES.

STOP.
