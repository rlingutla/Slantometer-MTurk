I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DO
REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS
NEWSCAST ED SNOWDEN IS
APPARENTLY MAKING NEW
CLAIMS ABOUT THE U.S.

HE CALLS THAT BLATANT
HYPOCRISY SAYING AND I'M
QUOTING HERE, NOT ONLY DOES
IT DO SO BUT IT IS SO
AFRAID OF IT BEING KNOWN
THAT IT IS WILLING TO USE
ANY MEANS SUCH AS
DIPLOMATIC INTIMIDATION TO
PREVENT THIS INFORMATION
FROM BECOMING PUBLIC MUCH
THE STATE DEPARTMENT WAS
ASKED TODAY ABOUT TARGETING
FOREIGN COMPUTERS AND
RESPONDED THIS WAY.

THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS
FEARFUL THAT IN THIS
MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA YOU
GET, THAT THERE IS THE
ABILITY OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TO SYNTHESIZE
THAT DATA AND LEARN
SOMETHING MORE.

52% SAYING HE SHOULD
RESIGN.

MICHAEL DANIEL IN THE D.C.
TONIGHT, MIKE?

HERE, REMEMBER THIS?

AND HE NOTES THE PROCESS OF
GETTING A SECURITY CLEARANCE IS
THE SAME WHETHER YOU'RE A
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE OR A
CONTRACTOR.

NOW HE SAYS HE IS READY TO
FACE JUSTICE IN HONG KONG.

TODAY DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAID
SHE WAS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF
CONTRACTORS AND THEIR ACCESS TO
HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
BUT AN EXPERT SAYS THE CHALLENGE
FOR THE GOVERNMENT IS THERE'S
SERIOUS COMPETITION WITH WALL
STREET AND SILICON VALLEY FOR
THE BEST TECHNICAL MINDS.

FIRST QUESTION ASKED HOW
FOLKS FEEL ABOUT THE
COUNTRY'S POLITICAL
LEADERS.

5% SAY THEY HAVE A GREAT
DEAL OF CONFIDENCE.

SO HER RESPONSE WASN'T
EXACTLY CRYSTAL CLEAR
SHEP.

THE SOUTH CHINA MORNING
POST NEWSPAPER REPORTS
SNOWDEN PROVIDED UNVERIFIED
DOCUMENTS TO PROVE HIS
STORY.

WELL BECAUSE HE SAYS
THAT AMERICA HAS LONG SAID
THAT IT DOES NOT TARGET
CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE
UNLIKE ITS ADVERSARIES,
SHEP.

ED?

SO WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU
DON'T KNOW HE IS IN 312
YET?

THE NSA DIRECTOR IS ALSO
DEBUNKING ONE OF SNOWDEN'S
PREVIOUS CLAIMS.

71% SAY WE CAN DO BETTER.

YEAH, HE SAID HE HAD
MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO FLEE
BUT, INSTEAD, HE DECIDED TO
STAY AND FIGHT.

WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.
