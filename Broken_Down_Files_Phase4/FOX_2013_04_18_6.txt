AND, SIR, GOOD EVENING TO
YOU.

MORE THAN 30,000 SOCIAL
MEDIA MESSAGES WERE
COLLECTED WITHIN A ONE MILE
RADIUS OF THE FINISH LINE
FROM 24 HOURS BEFORE TO 24
HOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSIONS
MESSAGES THAT SEEMED OUT OF
PLACE WERE CODED INCLUDING
TWEETS ABOUT TWO BOSTON
HOTELS WERE ANNUALIZED
FURTHER.

ONES THAT WE HAVE BEEN
WAITING DAYS FOR.

OUR FOX AFFILIATE OUT HERE
IS LINKING THAT TO A POLO
BALL CAP WITH THE NUMBER
THREE EMBROILED ON THE
SIDE.

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THESE
PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE, RATHER,
SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO
THAT YOU ARE HEARING?

THE POINT TO BE MADE HERE,
RICK, IS THAT THEY CANNOT
SOLVE THIS CASE WITHOUT
HELP FROM THE PUBLIC NOW
CAN THEY?

THE FBI RELEASED THESE
IMAGES ONLY TWO HOURS AGO
AND BOTH MEN CARRYING BAGS
AND WEARING BASEBALL CAPS.

ARREST, IF THERE IS AN
APPREHENSION, WH
CHARGES COULD BE FILED IN A
CASE LIKE THIS?

IF YOU HAVE VIDEO,
PICTURES, CAMERA CELL
PHONES ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
TURN IT OVER TO THE FBI
BOSTON LAW ENFORCEMENT.

WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE
PLAN WAS FOREIGN OR
DOMESTIC OR INDIVIDUAL ACT.

EVEN THOUGH THESE TERRIBLE
CRIMES COMMITTED.

LOOK AT THESE CAPS.

PULLING UP PIECES OF THE
ASPHALT.

A BALL CAP TURNED BACKWARDS
THAT WAS NEAR THE FORUM
RESTAURANT OR THE FINISH
LINE AT THAT TIME WHEN THE
EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE MAYBE
HAS SOME PHOTOGRAPHS COULD
GO RE-EXAMINE THEIR
PHOTOGRAPHS AND LOOK AT
THIS INDIVIDUAL WITH THE
WHITE BALL CAP TURNED
BACKWARDS.

THEY PUT OUT A WORD OF
CAUTION AS THEY HAVE TO AN
EXTENT.

AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE
REMINDED OF THE HORRORS OF
THAT DAY AND THE PAIN AND
ANGUISH AND AWFUL INJURIES
THAT THESE TWO SUSPECTS
ALLEGEDLY INFLICTED.

THESE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN
CRIMES BEFORE THEY CAME TO
BOSTON.

THEY ARE VIOLENT.

A SOURCE OF MINE WITH
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF
INVESTIGATION WAS LOOKING
AT A PICTURE OF WHAT WE
BELIEVE IS SUBJECT NUMBER 2
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 WEARING
THE WHITE BASEBALL CAP
BACKWARDS.
