BUT THIS COMMUNITY HAS
FACED SITUATIONS LIKE THIS
IN THE PAST.

WE ARE SHOWING YOU THE
DESTRUCTION AROUND THIS
AREA AS WE SPEAK.

EVERYBODY HAS BEEN HELPING
OUT.

AND BEFORE THEY KNEW IT THE
DOG WAS UP AND WALKING
AROUND.

JUSTIN TOLD ME HE WAS AT
WORK WHEN THE TORNADO HIT.

SHE THEN HAD TO CHOOSE
WHETHER TO STAY THERE
CLOSE TO HER ELDEST
DAUGHTER OR RUSH HOME TO
HER TWO YOUNGEST CHILDREN.

ENTER YOUR INFORMATION AND
LIST YOURSELF AS SAFE AND
YOU CAN CHECK WITH PEOPLE
WHO HAVE REGISTERED AS
WELL.

THERE ARE EMPTY SPACES
WHERE THERE USED TO IT BE
LIVING ROOMS AND BEDROOMS
AND CLASSROOMS.

AND NOW THEY ARE AT IT
AGAIN.

THAT WAY.

LAWMAKERS FROM THIS AREA
SAY HELP IS REALLY ALREADY
POURING IN FROM ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AND FOR THAT MATTER
AROUND THE WORLD.

TAKE A LISTEN.

AND SHE WAS EXCITED THAT
THERE WAS NO MORE SCHOOL.

I DON'T THINK -- THESE ARE
THE ONLY CHILDREN IN THE
WORLD THAT DON'T TALK.

SHE LEFT THEM IN THE CAR.

IT'S A TOUGH DECISION I
DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH
AGAIN.

HERE IN OKLAHOMA HAS
SEPARATED MANY PETS FROM
THEIR OWNERS.

BUT, IT WAS SCARIEST THING
THAT I HAVE EVER WENT
THROUGH.

SO I'M PROUD OF HER FOR
BEING SMART.

WERE SAVED HER LIFE.
