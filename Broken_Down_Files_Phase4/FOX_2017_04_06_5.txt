THIS AFTER INTERNATIONAL
INVESTIGATORS SAY HE LAUNCHED
ANOTHER CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
KILLING DOZENS OF HIS OWN PEOPLE
AN INJURING DOZENS AND CHILDREN
AS THEY SLEPT IN THEIR BEDS.

WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA IS ONE OF
THE TRULY EGREGIOUS CRIMES.

AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK TO THIS.

THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO, YOU
SAW WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE
SHIFT IN UNITED STATES POLICY
TOWARDS SYRIA.

REX TILLERSON IN THE CAMP OF
YES, HE NEEDS TO GO.

THIS IS ON CAMERA.

THE AMERICANS ORGANIZING A
COALITION TO SETTLE IT ALL.

IF WE GAVE THEM ALL OF THOSE
CONCESSIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE,
THEY WOULD -- PUTIN IS ENJOYING
A SUPREMACY THAT HE'S NEVER HAD
BEFORE.

BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THE SYRIAN
DICTATOR, BASHAR AL-ASSAD, HAS
BEEN MURDERING HIS PEOPLE BY THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FOR YEARS.

IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH SYRIA AND THE POTENTIAL
THERE IS OVERSHADOWING THAT.

FOR THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT SAID
WE WOULD WELCOME A MORE
CONSIDERED APPROACH.

THE CHANCES OF CONGRESS WEIGHING
IN ON THIS, A.B.?

CHANGE IN POLICY.

HE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE
SUMMIT HE'S HAVING WITH
XI JINPING, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO
BE THE THEME OF THIS NEXT 24
HOURS.

AND IF THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT
THIS WAS A SARIN ATTACK, IT
SHOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE
PUBLIC BEFORE THERE'S ANY
MILITARY INTERVENTION.

SAID THAT THE AL-ASSAD REGIME'S
ACTIONS CANNOT BE TOLERATED.

IF SO, WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARDS?

THEY ABDICATED THE
RESPONSIBILITY.

THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DISCUSSING
THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

WHO HOLDS THE LAND THEN?
