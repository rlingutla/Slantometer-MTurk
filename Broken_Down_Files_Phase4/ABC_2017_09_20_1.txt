EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, DOWNED
POWER LINES LIKE THESE, WHICH
STRETCH RIGHT ACROSS THE
EXPRESSWAY.

IT MAY VERY WELL STRENGTHEN
AGAIN AS IT HEADS TOWARDS THE
TURKS AND CAICOS.

A LOT OF DESTRUCTION TO HOMES,
DOWNED TREES AND POWER LINES, AS
WELL.

BUT SOMETHING WE'LL BE WATCHING
VERY, VERY CLOSELY IN THE COMING
DAYS.

STRUCTURES COLLAPSING.NCHES OF
AREAS, ENGULFING WHOLE
NEIGHBORS.

MANY OF THESE HOMES NOT BUILT TO
WITHSTAND ANY HURRICANE, LET
ALONE A CATEGORY 4.

HARD.

EVACUEES MOVED OFF THIS ARENA
FLOOR, DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS.

THIS IS WHAT SO MANY STREETS
ACROSS SAN JUAN LOOK LIKE
TONIGHT.

150-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS RIPPING
BUILDINGS APART, KNOCKING OUT
POWER EVERYWHERE.

FLOODING IN EVERY DIRECTION.

OBVIOUSLY, THE EYE GETTING
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO US, THAT
EYE WALL NOW SCRAPING THE
NORTHERN BEACHES THERE.

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT NOW
CONFIRMS, 100% OF PUERTO RICO
NOW WITHOUT POWER.

OFFICIALS SAYING MANY AREAS WILL
BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS,
MAYBE EVEN MONTHS.

â™ª
TERRIFIED RESIDENTS SINGING
ABOUT STRENGTH DURING TRYING
TIMES TO EASE THE FEAR.

THE FIRST CATEGORY 4 STORM TO
STRIKE PUERTO RICO IN 85 YEARS,.

DAMAGE, IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED
HERE?

AND THE SATELLITE IMAGE TONIGHT
DWARFING THE ISLAND.

THEY'VE ISSUED A CURFEW AND THE
GOVERNOR NOW SAYING HE IS
LAUNCHING SEARCH AND RESCUE
TEAMS AS WE SPEAK.

THE JOHN K. KENNEDY EXPRESSWAY.
