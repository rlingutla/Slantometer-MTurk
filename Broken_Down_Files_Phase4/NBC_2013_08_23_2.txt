WHAT WE HAVE SEEN INDICATES THAT
THIS IS CLEARLY A BIG EVENT OF
GRAVE CONCERN.

BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR A NO-FLY
ZONE, BOTH ARE OUT OF THE
QUESTION.

BECOMING MORE CLEAR TONIGHT.

RIGHT NOW THAT'S UNCLEAR AND THE
PRESIDENT'S CLOSEST ADVISERS
ARE DIVIDED ON THE OPTIONS THAT
ARE IN FRONT OF THEM.

IT IS THESE HEART-WRENCHING
IMAGES OUT OF SYRIA,
LIFELESS BODIES, MANY OF THEM
CHILDREN, ALLEGEDLY
VICTIMS OF BRUTAL CHEMICAL
WEAPON ATTACKS THAT ACCELERATED
THE DEBATE IN WASHINGTON.

NUMBER ONE, THAT THE U.S. GETS
ACTUAL PROOF THAT ASSAD USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

LESTER, FOR INSTANCE, IN LIBYA,
THERE WAS A U.N. RESOLUTION TO
ENFORCE.

AS THE INTERNAL DEBATE
ABOUT SYRIA HAS
DEVELOPED OVER MONTH,
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
SUSAN RICE AND
AGGRESSIVE ACTION.

WHEN DOES THE UNITED STATES,
WITH VERY LITTLE COST, STAND UP
FOR THESE PEOPLE?

THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE
LEANING EVERY ON SENDING SOME
SORT OF STRIKE.

DIED VIOLENTLY WHILE SLEEPING
AND DIED HUNGRY.

WE ARE RIGHT NOW GATHERING
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR EVENT.

HERE IN SYRIA RIGHT NOW, THERE
IS NOTHING LIKE THAT ON THE
TABLE.

IS AMERICA ABOUT TO GET INVOLVED
IN SYRIA?

ANN CURRY SPOKE WITH A DOCTOR
INSIDE SYRIA TREATING SOME OF
THOSE VICTIMS.

SOMETIMES WHAT WE HAVE SEEN
IS THAT FOLKS WILL CALL FOR
IMMEDIATE ACTION, JUMPING INTO
STUFF THAT DOES NOT TURN OUT
WELL.

AS THE U.S. OFFICIALS ARE TRYING
TO CONFIRM THE NATURE OF THE
ATTACK, NBC NEWS HAS SPOKEN TO
ONE OF THE DOCTORS ON THE GROUND
TREATING THE VICTIMS.

THE BIG DEBATE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE OVER WHAT TO DO ABOUT
SYRIA.

IS THIS THE TRUTH?

IS THIS REAL?
