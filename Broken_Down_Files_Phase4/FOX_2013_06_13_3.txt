I GUESS THEY ASKED HIM
TODAY ABOUT THE IRS
INVESTIGATION AS WELL.

SHEPARD THERE ARE, IN
FACT, MORE THAN A HALF A
DOZEN APPS AVAILABLE ONLINE
SUCH AS SEE CLIFT AND
SILENT CIRCLE THAT SAY THEY
WILL PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY.

ADDING, YOU JUST NEED COURT
APPROVAL IF YOU WANT TO GET
TO THAT CONTENT, SHEP.

SHEP, THAT'S BECAUSE
THERE IS A CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION LOOKING INTO
THE TARGETING OF THOSE
CONSERVATIVE ORGANIZATIONS
BY THE IRS.

SOURCE TELLS FOX NEWS THAT
STONE'S ELECTRONIC TRAIL
HAS BEEN TRACED TO THE
DOCUMENTS HE ACCESSED AND
THE SYSTEMS.

-- TODAY.

CAN YOU TELL ME SOME
BASICS?

THEY CAN BE USED FOR
TEXTING, EMAIL AND EVEN
VIDEO CONFERENCING.

THUMB DRIVES ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE BANNED ON THESE
SECURE NETWORKS, SHEP.

THE NEXT TIME YOU USE YOUR
SMART PHONE.

SAYS NOBODY IS LISTENING TO
YOUR PHONE CALLS.

NO DISCUSSION OR
ANTICIPATION OF
CONVENIENT.

CATHERINE, LAWMAKERS HAD
LOTS OF OTHERS QUESTIONS
FOR THE FBI DIRECTOR TODAY.

I'M NOT PERSUADED THAT
THAT MAKES IT OKAY TO
COLLECT EVERY -- EVERY
CALL -- IT'S MY FEAR THAT
WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF
BECOMING A SURVEILLANCE
STATE.

I WOULD SAY NO.

ALSO AHEAD THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN
SAYS A LIST OF PLOTS
DISRUPTED BY THE NSA MAY BE
DECLASSIFIED AS EARLY AS
MONDAY.

IS HE ALSO STATING THINGS
THAT ARE JUST CAN DID CANDIDLY
NOT CORRECT.

IT SEEMS UNUSUAL THAT HE
WOULD BE IN CHINA AND
ASKING FOR PROTECTION OF
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
GIVING PRESS CONFERENCES TO
CHINESE MEDIA THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE SAID HE WAS PART
OF THE CHINESE THAT HE
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN.

BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
TAKE ANY CHANCES, THERE IS
AN APP.

WHICH THEY SAY WILL INVOLVE
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND
CONSUMER ADVOCATES FOR FOR
MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES.
