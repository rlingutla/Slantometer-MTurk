BACK IN NEW YORK, A CITY
USED TO BEING ON HIGH ALERT,
NYPD OFFICERS WILL BE OUT IN
FULL FORCE AT TWO RACES
TOMORROW, INCLUDING THE ANNUAL
9/11 MEMORIAL 5K.

COUNTRY, RECREATIONAL EVENTS ARE
ON PARALLEL TRACK WITH A NATION
ON GUARD.

WE MADE SURE PUBLIC SAFETY
WAS A PARAMOUNT SITUATION HERE.

WELL, THIS WEEK, THE NATION
ADOPTED SOME OF THOSE TRADITIONS
AND IT'S HELPING THE CITY MOVE
FORWARD.

TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ANY
SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
UNATTENDED BAGS.

IN CALIFORNIA AT THE ANNUAL LONG
BEACH GRAND PRIX, MORE MANPOWER
AND VIGILANCE TO HANDLE THE
170,000 SPECTATORS ATTENDING THE
CELEBRITY CHARITY RACE.

IT JUST FELT WRONG THAT THIS
HAPPENED TO US.

POLICE
OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED IN HIS
PATROL CAR THURSDAY NIGHT, JUST
ARE 55 MINUTES BEFORE HIS SHIFT
WOULD HAVE ENDED.

BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER AND
WE CARE FOR EACH OTHER AND
BOSTON IS STRONG, IT'S SYMBOLIC
OF THAT, WHETHER WE'RE FROM
SOUTH CAROLINA OR MASSACHUSETTS.

NEW PICTURES RELEASED BY
MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE TODAY
SHOW WHAT THEY SAY IS THE
SUSPECT HIDING IN THE BOAT.

POLICE CONVERGED ON A HOUSE A
HALF MILE FROM WHERE THEY HAD
LAST SEEN THE SUSPECT MORE THAN
16 HOURS EARLIER.

IT'S RUNNING BETWEEN TWO
HOSPITALS, TRYING TO BE EACH OF
THEM AS SICK AS THEY ARE OR HURT
AS THEY ARE, IT'S, I COULDN'T BE
IN BOTH PLACES AT BOTH TIMES.

IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT IS
COMMENDING HIS FEDERAL
OFFICIALS, ALSO STATE AND LOCAL
OFFICIALS, BUT THEY
ARE STILL ASKING WHY DID SOMEONE
WHO WAS ALREADY IN THE FBI'S
DATABASE GET THROUGH THE CRACKS.

THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS
DECIDED TO HAVE THE YOUNGER
TSARNAEV QUESTIONED FOR THE
FIRST 48 HOURS BY A SPECIAL HIGH
VALUED INTERROGATION TEAM
WITHOUT ADVISING HIM OF HIS
RIGHTS TO COUNSEL UNDER WHAT IT
CALLS A PUBLIC SAFETY EXCEPTION,
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TONIGHT
SAYS THAT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH.

[ GUNFIRE ]
655 P.M.
47 MINUTES AFTER THE ORDER WAS
LIFTED, SHOTS FIRED.

SHOTS ARE FIRED AS S.W.A.T.
