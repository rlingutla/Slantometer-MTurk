RELEASED BY THE U.S.
COAST GUARD SHOWS A
WOMAN AND TWO CHILDREN
BEING HOISTED TO
SAFETY AFTER THEY WERE
STRANDED ON A CAPSIZED
BOAT OFF THE COAST.

HELP THEM PERSEVERE.

I'M GLAD WE'RE
ALIVE.

OF THEM, LIKE THIS
CREW FROM VIRGINIA,
HURRICANE MARIA IS YET
ANOTHER DISASTER IN
WHAT SEEMS LIKE AN
UNRELENTING SEASON OF
CATASTROPHE.

POWER IS OUT TO THE
ENTIRE ISLAND AND 95%
OF CELL SERVICE IS
DOWN.

WE'RE GOING TO DO
WHATEVER WE CAN TO
HELP THEM.

THIS CREW IN SAN JUAN
ARE HEADED TO CHECK ON
A FAMILY WHO HASN'T
BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE
THE STORM.

I'M GADI SCHWARTZ
IN PUERTO RICO, WHERE
THIS HOTEL LOBBY IS
MISSION CONTROL FOR
HUNDREDS OF RESCUERS.

IT'S DEVASTATING
BECAUSE YOU LOSE
EVERYTHING.

I'M WORKING IN GEORGE
AND I'M WORKING IN
HUGO AND I NEVER SEE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

FOLKS HERE HAVE
TAKEN A PRETTY BIG HIT
WITH THESE STORMS.

LISA?

YEAH.

YOU HAVE TO START FROM
ZERO.

I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

TOWN AFTER TOWN UNDER
WATER AND UNDER
PRESSURE.

BACK-TO-BACK
CALAMITIES --
 THEY CAME, ALL
THESE MOMENTS OF
HUMANITY --
 OKAY, I LOVE YOU.

IN THE NORTHWEST PART
OF THE ISLAND AN
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS
DAM FAILURE IS FORCING
MORE FRANTIC
EVACUATIONS.

HEART-POUNDING RESCUES
AND NEW EVACUATIONS AS
FLOODWATERS RISE IN
PUERTO RICO.

IN MANY PLACES THE
FLOODWATERS ARE
RECEDING, BUT MANY
COMMUNITIES ARE STILL
INUNDATED.
