CHUCK, IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN.

RELATIONSHIP THE PRESIDENT
SAID REPEATEDLY THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BY BASHAR
AL ASSAD WOULD CROSS THE RED
LINE.

LOOKS LIKE IN SOME FORM.

AND IT IS THE PUBLIC PLEDGE
COUPLED WITH THE HORRIFIC
PICTURES THAT PROMPTED SENIOR
OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER SPECIFIC
MILITARY RESPONSES, EVEN AS THE
PRESIDENT PREACHES CAUTION.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
INITIALLY AGGRESSIVE AND
SOFTENED UNTIL THE LATEST
PICTURES EMERGED AND TODAY IS
ADVOCATING AN AGGRESSIVE
RESPONSE.

CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS A SHAME
ON THE FACE OF HUMANITY.

READY TO STRIKE?

THIS IS QUITE POWERFUL AND
CLEARLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS
NOT BEEN FAKED.

THERE IS WORD TONIGHT THE
PENTAGON IS DRAWING UP MILITARY
OPTIONS TO RESPOND TO THIS
WEEK'S ATROCITIES IN SYRIA, AS
THE WHITE HOUSE COMES UNDER
INCREASING PRESSURE TO ACT.

I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CANNOT
DO ANYTHING EXCEPT MEETING AND
PROMISING.

KEY PRESIDENTIAL AIDES ARE SPLIT
OF HOW TO RESPOND.

HE SAYS THE WORLD IS IGNORING
THEM.

BUT IF HE WANTS REGIME CHANGE,
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
EASILY.

WHAT IS ON THE TABLE, LIMITED
AIR STRIKES, MOST LIKELY CRUISE
MISSILES LAUNCHED FROM NAVY
DESTROYERS TARGETING
KEY ASSAD MILITARY
COMMAND POSTS AND WHILE THE U.S.
AND WHILE THE U.S.
IS STILL GATHERING EVIDENCE,
EMOTIONS ARE HIGH.

THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND,
SECOND, THEY NEED TO HAVE A
LEGAL JUSTIFICATION.

DEMPSEY EXPRESSED RELUCTANCE.

THE QUESTION IS, WHAT DOES THAT
MILITARY OPTION LOOK LIKE?

FEARING FOR HIS OWN LIFE, HE
WOULD NOT GO ON CAMERA.

A DOCTOR ON THE FRONT LINES
THERE TELLING US WHAT HE SAYS
IS REALLY GOING ON.

CONSIDERING A VERY NARROW RANGE
OF MILITARY OPTIONS.
