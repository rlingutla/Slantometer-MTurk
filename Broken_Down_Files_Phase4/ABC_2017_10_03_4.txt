YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAYING THAT
THE HARD PART WAS KNOWING SO
MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T GET OUT.

HE HID A CAMERA IN A SERVICE
CART IN THE HOTEL HALLWAY, SO HE
WOULD KNOW WHEN POLICE WERE
MOVING IN.

AN AR-15 SEEN THROUGH THE
BATTERED DOORWAY OF THE
SHOOTER'S LUXURY SUITE.

SAVED MY LIFE.

IN FACT, THE SHERIFF SAYING THAT
MULTIPLE HOTEL EMPLOYEES HAD
BEEN IN THAT ROOM BEFORE THE
SHOOTING, WHICH BEGS THE MAJOR
QUESTION, GIVEN HOW ELABORATE
PADDOCK'S SETUP HAD BEEN WITH
THOSE TEN CASES OF LUGGAGE, THE
23 FIREARMS, THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
OF AMMUNITION AND, OF COURSE,
THOSE CAMERAS, HOW NOBODY
NOTICED ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND AND GOOD
SAMARITANS WHO HELPED SAVE HER,
PUTTING HER IN THE BACK OF A
TRUCK.

DENISE BURDITUS, FROM WEST
VIRGINIA, MARRIED 32 YEARS.

AND TONIGHT, VIDEO OF THAT VERY
ROOM TAKEN BY A TOURIST WHO
STAYED IN THAT ROOM JUST A YEAR
AGO.

IT SEEMS SURREAL.

ONE OF THE SURGEONS TAKING US
FROM ROOM TO ROOM, AND WE MET
THE SURVIVORS.

I HAD NO IDEA.

THAT HOTEL RIGHT BEHIND ME.

CURRENTLY, SHE'S A PERSON OF
INTEREST.

TODAY, OUR FIRST GLIMPSE INSIDE
THAT HOTEL ROOM.

I ANTICIPATE SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO COME IN
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

AMONG THEM, NEYSA TONKS FROM LAS
VEGAS, A MOTHER OF THREE BOYS.

ONE MONITORING THE HALLWAY, SEEN
RIGHT THERE ON THAT SERVICE
CART, POSSIBLY TO MONITOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.

WE HEAD INTO DESERT SPRINGS
HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER HERE IN
LAS VEGAS.

AUTHORITIES SAY HE CHECKED INTO
THE GLITTERING MANDALAY BAY
RESORT LAST THURSDAY.

SUCH EVIL?
