THE FBI IS ANALYZING AN ENVELOPE
SENT TO A U.S.

MARGUERITE SMITH INVITED THREE
RUNNERS AND THEIR FIVE FRIENDS
INTO HER HOME AND FED THE
SHIVERING GROUP FROM KANSAS
CITY.

AN UNRELATED NOTE.

AND EVERY YEAR WE HAVE LEARNED
LESSONS FROM THE ONE BEFORE.

THEY ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE
THE MINUTE PIECES OF AN ARTICLE
THAT A CIVILIAN WOULDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT IT WAS, BUT A BOMB
INVESTIGATOR LIKE FBI OR ATF
WILL SAY, THAT'S FROM A CLOCK.

YEAH, I WAS REALLY LUCKY THAT IT
ENDED UP LIKE IT DID.

AT THE FINISH LINE IT ONLY TOOK
MOMENTS FOR A JOYOUS
ACCOMPLISHMENT TO TURN TO
TERRIFYING CONFUSION.

MEANWHILE, EVENT ORGANIZERS
BEGAN REVISITING SECURITY PLANS
FOR BIG UPCOMING GATHERINGS.

FIRST OF ALL, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN ON THE INSIDE ALL
DAY, ANYTHING YOU'VE LEARNED?

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS
HAPPENED.

ABLE TO RETURN TO THE ROUTE TO
COLLECT BELONGINGS THAT WERE
LEFT IN THE HASTE OF YESTERDAY'S
FLEE TO SAFETY.

FINALLY TONIGHT FROM BOSTON,
INEVITABLY WHEN SOMETHING BAD
LIKE THIS HAPPENS, TERRIFIC
STORIES OF HEROISM AND KINDNESS
EMERGE.

THEY STARTED OFF WITH "GOD BLESS
AMERICA" A FEW MINUTES BACK.

WE'RE BACK AT THE CORNER OF
THE PUBLIC GARDEN HERE IN
BOSTON.

YOU SEE PEOPLE, AND THEIR
FACES ARE REALLY SOBER, JUST
WALKING AROUND.

STRAPPED TO HER BODY WITH A VIEW
OF THE FINISH LINE ON THE
HORIZON.

WE CARRIED EVERYTHING OUT ON
PLATTERS AND STARTED FEEDING
PEOPLE AND BROUGHT OUT COFFEE.

YOU HEAR THE CHURCH BELLS BEHIND
US.

SHE HAD A HEART OF GOLD.

REMEMBERED 8-YEAR-OLD MARTIN
RICHARD, THE YOUNGEST OF THE
VICTIMS.
