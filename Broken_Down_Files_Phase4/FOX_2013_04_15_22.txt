THE BLASTS 200 FEET APART.

OFFICIALS HAVE POSTPONED
IT.

OF COURSE, THE DEADLY
TERROR ATTACK THERE IN
BOSTON IS RAISING CONCERNS
ABOUT SECURITY ACROSS THE
NATION.

OVER 100 PEOPLE INJURED AT
LEAST TWO SERIOUSLY.

THEY THINK IT WAS A FIRE,
UNRELATED.

I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY
CLARITY IN THIS MATTER.

OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?

HOTELS IN THE AREA REMAIN
LOCKED COUNSEL AND THE
PEOPLE HERE IN BOSTON, THE
AUTHORITIES, THE MAYOR AND
GOVERNOR ASKING PEOPLE TO
STAY INSIDE TONIGHT.

A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN THEY
HEARD THIS EXPLOSION, WHEN
THEY WERE NEAR THIS
EXPLOSION, THEY PANICKED.

HOW DO I GET THEM OUT OF
HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?

SIR, IT'S NICE TO SPEAK
WITH YOU.

I THOUGHT MAYBE, YOU KNOW,
BEING PATRIOT'S DAY I
THOUGHT MAYBE SOMEONE FIRED
A MUSKET AND I SAW THE
PLUME OF SMOKE AND I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS UP.

I HAVE SPOKEN TO A HALF
DOZEN PEOPLE SHEPARD WHO
WORK THIS ISSUE ON CAPITOL
HILL OR THEY ARE IN FEDERAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE
SENSE I HAD FROM EVERY
CONVERSATION IS THAT THERE
WAS NOTHING SPECIFIC OR
CREDIBLE AT LEAST INITIALLY
THEY WERE SAYING TO ME THAT
THERE WAS A THREAT TO THE
BOSTON MARATHON.

IT SOUNDED LIKE A CANNON
WENT OFF.

THE OTHER THING I WOULD
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS
THE FACT THAT THE
EXPLOSIONS WERE NEARLY
SIMULTANEOUS AND ABOUT 50
TO 100 YARDS APART.

WE DO NOT HAVE INDEPENDENT
CONFIRMATION OF WHO THIS
PERSON MIGHT BE.

NOBODY WAS HURT THAT -- IN
THAT FIRE.

THEY ARE STILL
INVESTIGATING.

IT SEEMS TO BE WE ARE IN
THE REGION OF 100 INJURED
IN THIS.

FOR THE NEWS CONFERENCE TO
BEGIN AND WE'LL TAKE YOU TO
THAT LIVE AFTER THIS.
