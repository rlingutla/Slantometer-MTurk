I'LL NEVER FORGET HER
FACE, EVER.

GUN DEBATE CENTERS ON
PIECE OF PLASTIC LIKE
THIS.

GOT THIS FAR AND
TREATED?

ALL TO REMEMBER THE
UNFORGETTABLE,
LIFETIMES LOST IN
INSTANCE.

PEOPLE CALLING TO
CHECK ON LOVED ONES?

IT WAS THE BIGGEST
RELIEF OF MY LIFE.

TONIGHT POLICE SAY THE
GIRLFRIEND IA PERSON
OF INTEREST.

SPECIFICALLY THE
DEVICE USED BY THIS
KILLER TO MODIFY HIS
GUN INTO MACHINE GUN.

SAT ON A LOT OF BOMBS,
NEVER BLEW HIM UP.

AND I KNEW HE WAS
TAKING CARE OF
PATIENTS BECAUSE
THAT'S WHO MY DAD IS.

STEPHANIE GOSK HAS
MORE.

NEXT DOOR.

IT'S WHAT WE DO.

PRETTY POWERFUL AND
WRITTEN AS A TRIBUTE
TO HER FATHER BUT
COULD BE A TRIBUTE TO
ALL THOSE WHO STEPPED
FORWARD SUNDAY NIGHT
AND PUT THE SAFETY OF
OTHERS IN FRONT OF
THEIR OWN.

WHAT DID SHE KNOW?

WALKED INTO THE
GARAGE, I NOTICED A
LARGE SAFE, HALF THE
SIZE OF A
REFRIGERATOR.

ONLY PERSON WHO
LIKELY KNEW DAILY
ROUTINE WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE PERSON HE WAS
LIVING WITH.

ALL THINGS THAT
MAKE AMERICA SAFER AND
DON'T INFRINGE ON THE
SECOND AMENDMENT,
COUNT ME IN.

I GUARANTEE YOU HE'S
FULLY COVERED IN RED,
SONNY MELTON'S MOTHER
SHARES THE PAIN,
HEARTBREAK FELT BY A
NATION.

DANLEY WAS NOWHERE
NEAR LAS VEGAS THAT
NIGHT.
