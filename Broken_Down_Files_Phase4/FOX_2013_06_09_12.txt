WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A
DEBATE IN THE OPEN.

MANY THINK THE GOVERNMENT
OVERSTEPPED ITS BOUNDS AND
THEY INCLUDE BOTH
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
DOES NOT WANT TO COOPERATE
HE MAY HAVE FOUND A SAFE
HAVEN.

WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT AND
LEADER OF CHINA WERE HERE.

THIS IS TREMENDOUS BOOST TO
AL-QAEDA.

I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY WHO
SITS DAY TO DAY IN THE
OFFICE AND GOES -- THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OUR
PLACE TO DECIDE.

HONG KONG IS A UNIQUE PART
OF CHINA, BUT HONG KONG IS
GOVERNED BY CHINA AND THE
CHINA AND UNITED STATES
HAVE AN EXTRADITION TREAT.

THIS IS MATTER OF
EXTRAORDINARY CONSEQUENCES
TO AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE.

JURY WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON
WHO THEY BELIEVE.

AND COURT AUTHORIZED THIS
WARRANT OF THIS NATURE.

HE IS A FORMER C.I.A.

I WOULD HOPE THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT BEGIN
PROSECUTION AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE.

IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC
OBJECTIONS, THERE IS A FISA
COURT THAT MONITORS THIS ON
A REGULAR BASIS.

WE'RE TOLD HE IS IN HONG
KONG RIGHT NOW AND HOPES TO
SEEK ASYLUM.

DO THEY REALIZE THE
CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THEY
ARE DOING HERE?

THIS IS GOING TO BE
TREASURE TROVE OF STUFF
COMING OUT THE COMING
WEEKS.

FOURTH AMENDMENT PREVENTS
UNLAWFUL SEARCH AND
SEIZURES OUGHT TO BE
IMPORTANT TO US AND THERE
HAS TO BE A BALANCE HERE.

SNOWDEN IS A CONTRACTOR
WORK FOR THE NSA.

THE FACT IS YOU CANNOT HAVE
EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDING
WHAT LAW THEY ARE GOING TO
FOLLOW AND WHAT LAW THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW.

I DON'T AGREE WITH PETER
KING THAT JAMES
SENSENBRENNER THAT WROTE
THE PATRIOT ACT I DIDN'T
WANT IT TO BE USED THAT
WAY.
