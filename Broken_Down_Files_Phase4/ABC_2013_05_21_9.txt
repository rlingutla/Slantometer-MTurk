BUT THERE'S STILL HOPE HERE, AND
THERE ARE STILL TEARS.

AND RIGHT THERE, WHERE THE
DEADLY PATHS CROSS --
MISS DAVIS'S HOUSE.

IMPOSSIBLE STRENGTH AND
SURVIVAL.

TONIGHT AS THEY CONTINUE TO
SEARCH THERE, AN HONEST FIRE
CHIEF.

 AND AS WE SAID A MOMENT AGO,
HERE IS HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS
THAT YOUR HOUSE COULD BE HIT
TWICE, EACH TIME BY ONE OF THE
BIGGEST TORNADOES.

HELPING LINK ANIMALS TO OWNERS.

A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY PLANS TO
ADOPT IT, GIVE IT A HOME.

NANCY TELLS US THAT SHE DOES
WANT TO REBUILD AGAIN, DESPITE
ALL OF THAT.

BLOCK HERE WHO TOLD US HE TOOK
SHELTER IN HIS BATHTUB WITH HIS
ENTIRE FAMILY.

WHEN THEY EMERGED, HIS HOUSE WAS
GONE.

ACKNOWLEDGING THOSE TWO SCHOOLS
WERE AMONG THOSE THAT WERE NOT
FUNDED.

IT'S JUST NOT -- DOESN'T SEEM
REAL TO YOU THAT THIS IS
OCCURRING.

THEY WERE COVERING THEIR
HEADS WITH THEIR BACKPACKS.

YOU SAW IT COMING RIGHT AT YOU?

"JUST HOPING THAT THE TWO IN
THIS PHOTO ARE OKAY."

TONIGHT WE MEET THESE PARENTS
AND LEARN WHAT THEY DID TO SAVE
OTHER CHILDREN TOO.

SHE'S BLOODIED.

WHEN EVERYTHING COLLAPSED, THEY
WERE ABLE TO CRAWL OUT THROUGH
THE OPEN AREA IN THE MIDDLE,
PASSING THE CHILDREN OVER THE
RUBBLE.

THAT IS.

HERE ARE THE ODDS.
