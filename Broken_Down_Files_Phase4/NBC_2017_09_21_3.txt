I HAVEN'T TALKED TO       
   MY MOM EITHER.

SHE'S A SINGLE MOTHER.

EVERYBODY HAS FELT        
   THE PAIN AND THE             
   ANXIETY OF NOT               
   PATH OF DESTRUCTION IS       
   RELENTLESS,                  
   DEVASTATING THE              
   DOMINICAN REPUBLIC           
   OVERNIGHT.

THE MONSTER STORM            
   REGAINED STRENGTH            
   AFTER IT STRUCK PUERTO       
   RICO.

DANGEROUS STORM SURGE        
   AND DAMAGING WINDS           
   THAT RIP ROOFS OFF           
   HOMES.

THE EMOTIONAL TOLL           
   CAN'T BE MEASURED.

CELL PHONE SERVICE SO        
   UNRELIABLE THAT PEOPLE       
   LIKE THIS WOMAN STILL        
   HAVEN'T HEARD FROM           
   THEIR FAMILY.

TODAY WE RODE ALONG          
   WITH THE NATIONAL            
   GUARD AND GOVERNOR           
   RICARDO ROSSELLO WHO         
   HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO          
   COMMUNICATE NOT JUST         
   WITH MAYORS IN SOME          
   PARTS OF THE ISLAND          
   BUT EVEN HIS OWN             
   PARENTS OUTSIDE SAN          
   JUAN.

TONIGHT, IN THE WAKE         
   OF HURRICANE MARIA,          
   PARTS OF PUERTO RICO         
   ARE DESPERATE.

IT IS STILL EXTREMELY        
   DIFFICULT TO GET             
   AROUND SAN JUAN.

WATER IS RUNNING             
   SHORT.

LET'S GET THE LATEST         
   FROM OUR GABE                
   GUTIERREZ.

WE'RE DESPERATE.

FOR MANY IN PUERTO           
   RICO, THE CLEANUP IS         
   JUST BEGINNING.

ESTIMATES SHOW THE           
   DAMAGE ACROSS PUERTO         
   RICO COULD TOTAL $30         
   BILLION.

WHICH ONE'S GOING TO         
   BE WORSE, THE STORM OR       
   WHAT COMES AFTER THE         
   STORM?

I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR        
   35 YEAR AND THIS IS          
   TOO MUCH.

MANY AREAS UNREACHABLE       
   BY LAND OR BY PHONE          
   AND VIRTUALLY THE            
   ENTIRE U.S.

RESIDENTS FORCED TO          
   WADE THROUGH                 
   WAIST-HIGH WATER TO          
   SAFETY.

NOW UP TO 18 ACROSS          
   THE CARIBBEAN                
   INCLUDING ONE DEATH          
   HERE IN PUERTO RICO.
