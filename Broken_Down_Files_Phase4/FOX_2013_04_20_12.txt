THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT
ATTACKED THE UNITED STATES.

PLUS WHAT WE NOW KNOW ABOUT THE
STAND-OFF THAT BROUGHT HIM TO
JUSTICE.

AND THAT'S WHEN I GRABBED MY
SON'S HAND AND SAID I DON'T
WANT YOU TO HEAR THIS.

YEAH, WE HAVE THE BOAT
SURROUNDED HERE FROM ALL
CORNERS.

LAST THING YOU NEEDED WAS
SOMEBODY ELSE HURT.

HE ADD A CITY.

HE DID NOT EVEN LEAVE HIS
HOUSE AT ALL EVEN TO GO IN HIS
BACK YARD UNTIL WE TOLD HIM IT
WAS OKAY BY SIX CAN BE
O'CLOCK.

REPORTS THAT THEY
INVESTIGATED HIS REPORT TO
GROUPS AND EVENTUALLY RELEASED
HIM.

IS THE INTENTION TO TRY HIM IN
COURT.

THAT WILL BE SCUTINIZED.

AND HERE IS A PHOTO FROM THAT
CAMERA.

ABOUT
WHAT THEY SAW WHEN THEY LOOKED
AT THIS AND WHAT DID THEY
MISS.

MARATHONERS ARE A TRIBE AND
SO WHEN SOMETHING AS HORRIBLE
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BOSTON,
HAPPENED.

AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD
GO BEFORE CONGRESS.

THERE ARE GUARDS IN EVERY
ENTRANCE AND EXIT.

WE'LL LISTEN ALONG WITH OUR
VIEWERS.

WHO WILL REPRESENT THE MAN IN
COURT.

THE SCHOOL EVACUATED THE
CAMPUS AFTER THE SCHOOL
REALIZED THAT THE SUSPECT WAS
A STUDENT.

HE HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED AND WE
ARE WAITING FOR MORE ON THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ON HOW THEY
PLAN TO PROCEED AMID
CONTROVERSY AND HOW THEY THINK
IT SHOULD PROCEED AND STILL NO
WORD.

YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND
QUESTION THEM RIGHT NOW FOR
THE PUBLIC SAFETY.
