THAT'S WHY THERE WERE LOWER LIMB
INJURIES.

IT WAS ONE OF THE CRAZIEST
SCENES I HAVE SEEN.

THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING
ON.

THEY SAY THERE WERE OTHER
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES.

AT THAT VERY MOMENT I WALKED
OUTSIDE.

AFTER THE MARATHON RIGHT ABOUT
NOW THIS AREA WOULD BE CROWDED.

CHUCK TODD WAS STANDING IN THE
BRIEFING ROOM WHEN THE PRESIDENT
ENTERED AT ABOUT 610 TONIGHT TO
GIVE HIS REMARKS ON WHAT THE
WHITE HOUSE WAS SAYING SO FAR.

THE ATTACKERS USED HOME MADE
EXPLOSIVES PACKED INTO
BACKPACKS.

AND NUMBER TWO, THE NATURE OF
THESE INJURIES.

IT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE WANTS TO
MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A SHOW
OF FORCE AND SHOULD SOMETHING
ELSE ARISE THAT THEY ARE IN A
GOOD POSITION TO RESPOND.

THERE IS NO SUSPECT IN CUSTODY,
AUTHORITIES SAY.

PEOPLE ARE OUT.

THAT'S THE KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY
SECURITY YOU GET IN A
PRESIDENTIAL ZONE.

THE BARS ARE OPEN.

INITIALLY NOBODY THOUGHT -- THEY
WEREN'T SURE IF IT WAS EVEN AN
ACCIDENT, A GAS MAIN BREAK.

WE ARE TOLD, BY THE WAY, THAT
ONE OF THE TWO VICTIMS KILLED IN
THE EXPLOSION WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT HERE.

THIS IS LIKE A BOMB EXPLOSION
THAT WE HEAR B ABOUT ABOUT ON T
IN BAGHDAD OR ISRAEL OR
SOME OTHER TRAGIC PLACE IN THE
WORLD.

WHILE AUTHORITIES TRY TO FIGURE
OUT WHO BROUGHT TO SUCH A
VIOLENT DEADLY END THE DAY THAT
PEOPLE IN BOSTON, BRIAN, HAVE
ALWAYS CALLED THE VERY BEST DAY.

WE TALK ABOUT HOW SECURITY
CHANGED AFTER 9/11.
