EVEN FAMILY PHOTOS LIKE THIS, A
FATHER AND A MOTHER AND MAYBE
THEIR LITTLE GIRL.

SHE HAS LOST HER HOME TO A
TORNADO --
TWICE.

JUST BEFORE WE CAME ON THE AIR,
ANOTHER VISIT TO THE HOME RIGHT
HERE BESIDE US.

AND TONIGHT FAMILIES SHOW US HOW
THEY EMERGED FROM UNDERGROUND
SHELTERS TO SEE THEIR HOMES
SIMPLY ERASED.

ALL ACROSS THE TORNADO ZONE, JOY
AT THE RECOVERY OF THE SMALLEST
MEMBERS OF A FAMILY.

WATCH THIS.

AND THAT WE BELIEVE IN EACH
OTHER, NO MATTER WHAT.

TWO TIMES IN THAT CELLAR.

COMING RIGHT FOR THE SCHOOL.

THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME.

I WANTED HER TO FEEL SAFE AND
THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE OKAY.

TODAY WE WENT TO MEET THEM.

HER NAME IS FLY.

WE BEGIN WITH A SPECIAL EDITION
OF "WORLD NEWS" TONIGHT.

A LITTLE GIRL'S PINK TIARA.

BUT AMID THE WRECKAGE, THERE IS
A LOOK TO THE FUTURE.

WE MET HIS WIFE TODAY, GIANT
SMILE ON HER FACE, EVEN THOUGH
SHE HAS NO HOME LEFT, SHE HAS
HER FAMILY.

THOSE TWO INGREDIENTS MIX
TOGETHER AND OFTEN AND,
UNFORTUNATELY, MAKE FOR
DEVASTATION.

AND COMING UP NEXT HERE, HOW
THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER STILL
WAVES IN OKLAHOMA TONIGHT.

HIS CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS THAT HAD
BEEN IN HIS ATTIC, WERE IN HIS
DRIVEWAY.
