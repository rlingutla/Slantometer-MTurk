THE SURVIVORS SPRAYED DOWN.

WHAT COULD WE USE?

IF YOU DO, MANY BAD THINGS WILL
HAPPEN.

WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE EQUIPMENT
THERE OVER SYRIA NOW THEY COULD
ACTUALLY WATCH, GO BACK AND SEE
WHAT KIND OF AIRCRAFT DROPPED
THOSE MUNITIONS.

AT SOME POINT I MAY.

AND MARTHA JOINS ME NOW.

SAYING IN HIS WORDS, SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

WILL YOU AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL
COALITION TO REMOVE ASSAD?

THIS EVENING, THE PRESIDENT AND
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT NOW
WEIGHING OPTIONS AFTER TRUMP
REPEATEDLY SAID BEFORE THAT THE
U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED IN
SYRIA.

THIS SHIFT COMES JUST 24 HOURS
AFTER THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE
WORLD WATCHING, SAID THOSE
IMAGES OF CHILDREN GASSED HAD
CHANGED HIS MIND.

GO AFTER MILITARY TARGETS SUCH
AS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIT THEM,
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO BLOW
THEM UP, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GOING
TO CREATE AGENT PLUMES, WHICH
ARE GOING TO DAMAGE, YOU KNOW,
CIVILIAN AREAS.

THOSE STEPS ARE UNDER WAY.

AMBASSADOR, NIKKI HALEY ASKING
HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE TO
DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?

HASN'T SAID WHAT HE WOULD DO IN
SYRIA, BUT THERE ARE MANY
MILITARY OPTIONS.

UNIT 450, OF THE SYRIAN AIR
FORCE.

COULD BE LESS SWEEPING BECAUSE
OF THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN
SOLDIERS AND ADVISERS ACROSS
SYRIAN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO MAKE A
DECISION THAT'S GOING TO DEFINE
HIS PRESIDENCY ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER.

NOW, RUSSIANS ARE INVOLVED AND
AMERICAN TROOPS ARE THERE.

TRUMP, WITH HIS STRONGEST WORDS
YET ON THE CRISIS IN SYRIA.
