SHE HAS A BADLY BRUISED EYE AND
FACE, BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.

TONIGHT, DIRECT HIT, TWISTER
OUTBREAK.

TONIGHT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU
INSIDE THE 17 MILES OF
DESTRUCTION, SCHOOLS,
NEIGHBORHOODS, HOSPITALS
PULVERIZED, AS OUR ABC NEWS TEAM
IS EVERYWHERE IN THE STORM ZONE
TONIGHT, AND OUR COVERAGE OF THE
DIRECT HIT TWISTER OUTBREAK
BEGINS WITH ABC'S ANCHOR DAVID
MUIR ON THE GROUND RIGHT THERE
IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

IT'S THE GEOGRAPHY.

THIS NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WE'RE
STANDING IN, LOOKS LIKE SO MANY
THAT WE DROVE THROUGH TODAY.

SO MANY ANIMALS SEPARATED FROM
THEIR OWNERS.

IN FACT, TONIGHT, NEARLY TEN
MILLION FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF
TORNADOES.

OKLAHOMA TONIGHT WHERE WE
LEARNED JUST A SHORT TIME AGO,
THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THIS
COMMUNITY, THAT TORNADO
SURPASSED 200 MILES PER HOUR.

I'M THE ONLY ONE.

NEIGHBORS SIFT THROUGH MOUNDS OF
RUBBLE TRYING TO SALVAGE WHAT
LITTLE SURVIVED, HELPING EACH
OTHER CRAM THEIR MEMORIES INTO
PLASTIC BAGS.

TAPE, THAT HUSBAND WHO WATCHED
THE TORNADO COMING TOWARD HIS
HOUSE, TOWARD HIS FAMILY.

[ SIRENS ]
HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN
WAITING IN THE STORM SHELTER,
THEIR BUNKER.

STILL AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS," A
ONE IN 100 TRILLION CHANCE THAT
A HOUSE HIT BY AN EF-4 TORNADO
IN 1999 WOULD BE HIT BY A BIG
ONE AGAIN.

RAN OVER AND GOT ON TOP OF THE
KIDS.

OR ARE YOU THE ONLY ONE?

AND I COULDN'T LEAVE THEM.

PEOPLE'S LIVES SCATTERED ALL
OVER THESE PROPERTIES, THERE ARE
TOYS, YOU CAN SEE HERE,
STROLLERS, THEIR LIVES.

THEY ALL ARE SPECIAL TO ME.

WHERE ONE OF NATURE'S RAW FORCES
SHATTERED SO MANY LIVES IN A
MATTER OF MINUTES.

OH, MY GOD!
