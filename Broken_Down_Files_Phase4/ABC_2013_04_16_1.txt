SMILING EYES OF MARTIN RICHARD
MAKE THE SORROW OF WHAT HAPPENED
MONDAY AFTERNOON ALL THE MORE
PALPABLE.

CLUES SO FAR TELL OUR EXPERT
WHETHER THIS TERRORIST WAS PART
OF ANY ONE ORGANIZATION.

AND OF COURSE SCORES OF OTHER
PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THIS
ATTACK.

WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THEY
ARE.

I COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER
DAUGHTER.

THIS WAS A HEINOUS AND
COWARDLY ACT, AND GIVEN WHAT WE
NOW KNOW ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE,
THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING IT AS
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.

YOU COMPLETED THE MARATHON?

LOOK AT THIS CELLPHONE FOOTAGE,
SHOT BY A SPECTATOR STANDING
BETWEEN THE TWO BOMBS.

WE'VE SEEN THIS IN AMERICA
BEFORE, WHEN A CRISIS HITS HOME,
THIS NATION WILL RALLY.


THEY ARE ON THE WAY, SIR,
THEY ARE ON THE WAY.

BECAUSE WHAT THE WORLD SAW
YESTERDAY IN THE AFTERMATH OF
THE EXPLOSIONS WERE STORIES OF
HEROISM AND KINDNESS AND
GENEROSITY AND LOVE.

FAMILY WENT TO THE BOSTON
MARATHON EVERY YEAR.

THERE ARE NUMEROUS DESCRIPTIONS
ONLINE ABOUT HOW TO BUILD A
PRESSURE-COOKER BOMB, INCLUDING
THIS DETAILED ONE POSTED IN AN
AL QAEDA INTERNET PUBLICATION.

AS YOU SAID THE STRONGEST
CLUES ARE IN THE NATURE OF THE
BOMB.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?

LOOKS LIKE HE WAS OUT TO KILL
AND MAIM.

HE WAS THE FASTEST KID, THE
TALLEST ON HIS TEAM.

BUT ONE OF THOSE TWIN EXPLOSIONS
ENDED HIS SHORT LIFE, SENDING
HIS MOTHER TO THE HOSPITAL WITH
A SERIOUS HEAD INJURY.

THEY'RE TWISTED AND DEFORMED.

FROM BOSTON TONIGHT WE HAVE NEW
IMAGES OF A CITY INTERRUPTED,
HALF-EATEN SANDWICHES ABANDONED
WHERE THE BOMBS WENT OFF.
