THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING HARD
TIME GETTING THEIR MINDS
AROUND EXACTLY HOW BIG THIS
AFTER A TORNADO LIKE THIS
HITS THE FRONT MOVES ON
AND YOU ARE ABLE TO AT
LEAST CLEAN UP AFTER WHAT'S
HAPPENED.

HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO BRING
US FIRST-HAND REPORTING OF
THE DEATH OF FOUR MORE
PEOPLE AND THE LIVE
PICTURES SHOW A RESCUE
AND/OR RECOVERY EFFORT
WHICH IS UNDERWAY RIGHT
NOW.

OF COURSE, ANOTHER STRUCK
AS WELL.

THERE.

TWO DOZEN CHILDREN BELIEVED
TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.

IF YOU ARE LIKE ME, YOU ARE
WONDERING HOW CAN I HELP
THESE PEOPLE?

AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR
LOCAL STATION THERE THEY
ARE SHOWING WHERE THE STORM
SYSTEM IS NOW.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROTECT
MY HOUSE FROM PEOPLE THAT
MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE ON THE
GOOD SIDE.

AND THE SIRENS GOING OFF.

AT THE 7/11 IT' AS TO BE A
GAS PUMP BUT IT'S NOTHING
BUT ELECTRONICS AND WIRES
HANGING OUT.

IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS DARK
OUTSIDE.

SO IF THEY ARE OUT THERE
AND THEY ARE WATCHING,
PLEASE LET THEM KNOW THAT I
AND MY FAMILY IS OKAY.

I'M JUST IN SHOCK.

WITH WINDS UP TO 200 MILES
PER HOUR.

I KNOW THAT -- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GO
TONIGHT.

I THINK THE THING FOR US
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
HAPPENED IN THE PAST TO OUR
COMMUNITY AT MOORE.

THEY NEED HELP CLEANING UP.

YOU CAN DONATE TO THE
NATIONAL -- YOU CAN DONATE
TO THE RED CROSS AND SO THE
SALVATION ARMY THERE WILL
BE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD.

IN MANY CASES THEY ARE
CERTAINLY NO ELECTRICITY.

CAN'T SAY ANY SPECIFICS
ABOUT THE 7/11 WHERE WE
ARE.
