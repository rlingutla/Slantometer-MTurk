THOSE SUITCASES FULL OF WEAPONS.

WAY TO THE HOSPITAL WITH YOU.

AND AS FOR SHELDON, HE WANTS TO
MEET THAT HERO WHO WAS RIGHT
THERE BY HIS SIDE.

ONE OF THEM POSTED THESE PHOTOS
ON FACEBOOK.

SHOT IN THE ARM AND IT WENT
STRAIGHT THROUGH TO HER ABDOMEN.

THINK ABOUT.

I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, IT STILL
HASN'T FULLY HIT ME.

I WISH I DID.

THE E.R.

WHERE AUTHORITIES CAME BEFORE
THE CAMERAS JUST A SHORT TIME
AGO AND REVEALED SEVERAL
STUNNING FINDINGS TONIGHT.

AND MATT, WE KNOW THE GUNMAN
STAYED IN THAT ROOM UNDETECTED
FOR DAYS.

THEY KNOW THEIR SON STILL HAS SO
MANY QUESTIONS, AMONG THEM, WHY?

WHEN WE COME BACK HERE
TONIGHT, MORE OF THE FACES OF
THOSE WE LOST HERE, FROM THE
NAVY VETERAN, TO THE WIFE WHO
DIED IN HER HUSBAND'S ARMS.

THERE WERE SO MANY PATIENTS, YOU
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME -- YOU
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO THESE
PATIENTS WERE?

YOU KNOW, I -- I HAVE A LIFE
AHEAD OF ME, WHY DOES SOMEONE
WANT TO KILL ME AND LEAVE ME
LYING ON THIS FIELD AND
EVERYBODY ELSE?

SHELDON, HOW ARE YOU?

THEY'RE MAKING PLANS FOR HER TO
THE FBI IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN
MAKING SURE SHE GETS ON A PLANE
TO COME BACK TO THE U.S., WHICH
WE'RE TOLD COULD HAPPEN IN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.

 AND FINALLY TONIGHT HERE,
FOR ALL OF THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF
FRIENDS, STRANGERS AND THE
MEDICAL TEAMS HERE IN LAS VEGAS,
WE CANNOT FORGET THE 59 LIVES
LOST.

YEAH, HE WOULDN'T LEAVE MY
SIDE.

AND TONIGHT, WE HAVE JUST
LEARNED THE GUNMAN WAS FIRING AT
THE CROWD FOR NINE MINUTES.
