THIS STORM EVEN              
   CRACKING CONCRETE IN         
   HALF.

DAMAGING AN                  
   INFRASTRUCTURE THAT          
   WAS ALREADY CRUMBLING.

OFFICIALS SAY HELP IS        
   ON THE WAY, BUT A FULL       
   RECOVERY COULD TAKE          
   HALF A YEAR.

SHE SAYS SHE'S SCARED        
   WHAT THE NEXT SIX            
   MONTHS ARE GOING TO          
   BRING.

NEIGHBORHOODS                
   DEMOLISHED, STREETS          
   UNDER WATER.

HOURS TO GET GAS TO          
   POWER THEIR GENERATOR.

POWER LINES ACROSS           
   THIS AREA ARE DOWN.

IT'S EXPECTED TO CUT         
   CLOSE TO TURKS AND           
   CAICOS LATE TONIGHT,         
   AND AFTER THAT THE           
   CURRENT TRACK SHOWS IT       
   BARRELING BETWEEN THE        
   U.S. EAST COAST AND          
   BERMUDA.

BUT THE TRUE EXTENT OF       
   THE DAMAGE IS NOT YET        
   KNOWN.

SEARCH AND RESCUE            
   OPERATIONS FROM              
   MULTIPLE AGENCIES IN         
   PUERTO RICO AND THE          
   U.S. MAINLAND NOW            
   UNDER WAY.

COMMUNICATIONS ARE           
   SPOTTY.

REALLY DEVASTATING.

TONIGHT THE MILLIONS         
   OF AMERICANS THERE           
   WAIT AS AN URGENT            
   RELIEF EFFORT KICKS          
   INTO HIGH GEAR.

HURRICANE MARIA              
   GAINING STRENGTH AND         
   ON THE MOVE.

POWER IS OUT ACROSS          
   THE ISLAND.

WE'RE LIVE IN THE            
   DISASTER ZONE.

SHE HAS TO TAKE CARE         
   OF HER DAUGHTER, AND         
   SHE DOESN'T KNOW             
   WHAT'S GOING TO              
   HAPPEN.

DOZENS OF FAMILIES           
   RESCUED DURING THE           
   EARLY MORNING WITH           
   JUST FLASHLIGHTS TO          
   GUIDE THEM IN THE SAN        
   JUAN COMMUNITY.

THAT'S BECAUSE ENTIRE        
   AREAS REMAIN CUT OFF         
   THIS EVENING.

PEDRON RODE OUT THE          
   STORM IN HIS HOME AND        
   TODAY RETURNED TO HIS        
   BUSINESS.
