ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO JON
KARL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

I WANT TO PLAY THE SOUND.

TEAM CAME.

AND FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE
INJURED AND IN THE HOSPITAL AND,
OF COURSE, FOR THE FAMILIES OF
THOSE WHO DIED AND WHO HAVE BEEN
SO SERIOUSLY INJURED, I KNOW, AT
THIS POINT, ANSWERS ARE
SOMETHING THAT MATTERS, VITALLY
TO THEM.

NO, REALLY, IT WAS JUST
OVERHEARING THEM.

THIS SEEMS TO GIVE NEW VALIDITY
TO THAT, BRIAN.

AND HIS WIFE, WHO IS SUFFERING
SOME MAJOR MEDICAL PROBLEMS, IS,
YOU KNOW, ALL HER --
EVERYTHING -- THEY JUST RUSHED
THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE AND SHE
COULDN'T -- THEY COULDN'T TAKE
ANYTHING WITH THEM.

AGAIN, MARTHA RADDATZ, WE
KNOW HIS OLDER BROTHER HAD GONE
BACK TO RUSSIA.

HERE HE IS AGAIN.

THERE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN
HERE, AS THEY HAVE, FOR A VERY
LONG TIME AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR
ABOUT 11 YEARS, WE ALL KNOW EACH
OTHER VERY WELL.

AND THAT THEY SENT IN ROBOTS TO
LOOK AT HIM AND A SPECIAL
MACHINE THAT COULD TIP THE BOAT
AND TIP IT OVER.

I WANT TO TELL EVERYBODY
ABOUT A TWEET FROM MAYOR TOM
MENINO OF BOSTON.

AND THAT MAY BE WHAT HAPPENED.

AND, AGAIN --
DIANE, HE MENTIONED THAT THE
GOVERNOR IS ALREADY HERE AT THE
COMMAND CENTER AND WE SHOULD SEE
HIM SHORTLY.

WE GO BACK HERE TO THE SNIPER IN
2002, AND HOW TERRIFYING THAT
WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

FACT THAT HE WENT BACK TO
COLLEGE THE NEXT DAY.

PEOPLE APPLAUDING.

BUT TO GO BACK OVER IT ONCE
MORE, SIR, SO, YOUR FRIEND, IT'S
DAVE HANNEBURY, SYOU SAY?

ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TAKEN
HIM.

"WE GOT HIM."
