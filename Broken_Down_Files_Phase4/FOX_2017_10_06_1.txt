OFFICIALS TELL NBC THAT THEY
FOUND A PHONE CHARGER IN THE
ROOM THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE
GUNMAN'S CELL PHONE.

WE'LL TALK TO HIM.

ONE FOR EACH PERSON KILLED.

THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE YESTERDAY.

IN ADDITION, RECORDS SHOW
SOMEBODY ELSE DID ACCESS THAT
ROOM WHILE HIS CAR WAS GONE.

INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH WHILE THE
NRA IS SAYING MAYBE WE SHOULD
REGULATE AND RESTRICT THE BUMP
STOCKS, ERIC PRATT SAYS NO.

WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO
THAT OVER THE COMING DAYS.

SO WE HOPE TO GET MORE DETAILS,
A PICTURE IS EMERGING OF STEPHEN
PADDOCK THAT PAYMENTS HIM AS A
LOSER, ALONER THAT WOULD GO TO
PROSTITUTES.

THIS DEVELOPMENT AS
INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO
DETERMINE WHY THE GUNMAN FIRED
ON A COUNTRY MUSIC FESTIVAL
KILLING 58 AND INJURING MORE
THAN 400.

THANK YOU, SARAH.

FRIENDS AND FAMILY SAY
CHARLESTON HARTFIELD WAS ONE OF
THE GREATEST AMERICANS THEY EVER
KNEW WITH A HEART OF GOLD AND
THAT HE DIED TRYING TO SAVE
OTHERS.

NEW REPORTS ON WHAT THE GUNMAN
HAD IN HIS ROOM AND QUESTIONS
NOW.

WAS SOMEONE ELSE IN HIS ROOM?

TRACERS COULD HAVE MADE THIS
SHOOTING MORE DEADLY, MORE
ACCURATE BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE
ROUNDS WERE GOING.

WHEN YOU HEAR THE KINDS OF
THINGS -- WE'LL HAVE AN
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW SUNDAY --
THAT HE DID TO TRY TO HARDEN THE
WYNN HOTEL AND TO HARDEN THE
ENCORE HOTEL IN TERMS OF
BRINGING IN FORMER SEAL TEAMS
SIX MEMBERS, FORMER CIA
OFFICERS, HIDDEN DETECTORS,
HIDDEN PROFILERS IN THE CASINOS.

HERE YOU CAN SEE THE FORMER
SERGEANT'S WIDOW AND THEIR TWO
CHILDREN AT THE FRONT OF THE
PROCESSION LAST NIGHT.

INVESTIGATION INTO THE LAS VEGAS
CONCERT KILLER.

HASN'T CHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY.

ARE YOU RETHINKING THAT?

IMAGES IN OUR SLIDE SHOW FOR YOU
THIS AFTERNOON.
