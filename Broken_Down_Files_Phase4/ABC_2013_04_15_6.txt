THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA.

YES, DEFINITELY FELT
EVERYTHING AROUND ME SHAKE AND
MOVE.

LOOK AGAIN.

RUMORS STARTED -- WE STARTED
HEARING PEOPLE TALK THAT THERE
WAS A BOMB AND ANOTHER BOMB.

BUT THIS OBVIOUSLY BEING TREATED
AS A TERRORIST ATTACK, ALTHOUGH
THE PRESIDENT DID NOT USE THAT
WORD.

AND ONE OF THEM, ONE OF THOSE
RUNNERS WAS A WOMAN NAMED ALISON
WHO JOINS US ON THE TELEPHONE.

WE HEARD THAT HOSPITAL OFFICIALS
SAID IT WAS LIKE A WAR ZONE.

HOW HARD WAS IT TO MAKE YOUR WAY
OUT OF THE SCENE?

THE AMOUNT OF FATALITIES WAS
EXAGGERATED.

WHEN YOU COMPROMISE HOW YOU
LIVE, THAT GIVES THEM A VICTORY.

I HAVE TO COMMEND REALLY THE AA
FOR DOING AN AMAZING JOB GETTING
EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WAY AND
ORDERLY.

ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIED.

AND NOW WE WANT TO BRING YOU
MORE ON THAT MOMENT WHEN THOSE
BOMBS WENT OFF AT THE BOSTON
MARATHON, AS RUNNERS WERE
CROSSING THE FINISH LINE.

YOU THINK PATRIOTS' DAY MARATHON
MONDAY AND YOU DON'T THINK
ANYTHING LIKE THIS IS EVER GOING
TO HAPPEN ON A DAY LIKE THIS IN
BOSTON.

KEEP IN MIND, THIS WAS AT THE
END OF THE MARATHON.

THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING
KILLING 168.

THEN CARRYING AT LEAST 99
INJURED INTO THE RACE MEDICAL
TENTS BEFORE THE HOSPITAL.

BUT THERE ARE INJURIES OF
MANY DIFFERENT KINDS, BURNS AS
WELL.

THEY SAY IT CONFIRMS WHAT THEY
THINK.

THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS FOR
YOU, AND I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR IT.
