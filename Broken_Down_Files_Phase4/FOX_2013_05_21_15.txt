WE ARE GOING TO GO TO BED
AT THAT TIME.

BUT ITS MISSION TO SUPPORT
THOSE IN NEED BEGAN 132
YEARS AGO TODAY TODAY THAT
MISSION CONTINUES AS THE
RED CROSS WORKS TO HELP
VICTIMS IN THE HEARTLAND.

ART SUPPLIES PROVIDED TO
THE YOUNGEST WHO WERE
KICKED FROM THEIR HOMES BY
THAT TORNADO.

LOOK AT THAT A POWERFUL
IMAGE, A TATTERED AMERICAN
FLAG HANGING.

SO THEY ARE FEVERISHLY
SEARCHING.

THE FEAR IS SOME HOMES MAY
HAVE COLLAPSED ON TOP OF
THOSE STORM SHELTERS AND
THE FEAR IS SOME PEOPLE
COULD STILL BE TRAPPED.

SHE ENDED UP NEEDING TO
SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION
BECAUSE SHE HAD CUTS AND
SCRAPSZ AND WAS BLEEDING.

BUT RESCUE WORKERS DID
MANAGE TO PULL SOME OF THE
KIDS OUT OF THE RUBBLE
FORMING A HUMAN CHAIN TO
PASS THEM TO SAFETY.

IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THOUGH,
DID YOU LOSE EVERYTHING?

I'M FROM KANSAS
ORIGINALLY.

AND OVER HERE YOU CAN SEE
THE REST THAT WAS DONE BY
THE STORM.

A WOMAN CARRYING A CHILD
THROUGH A FIELD.

THE FIRE CHIEF HERE SAYS HE
IS 98% SURE THAT TEAMS FROM
ALREADY FOUND ALL THE
SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS.

YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICIAL
WHITE HOUSE PHOTO OF THAT,
LISA MONICA.

YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHAT'S
LEFT OF THE HOME.

THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO
DO IS BRING THE PRESIDENT'S
SECURITY DETAIL IN AND
DISTRACT FROM ALL OF THAT,
SHEP.

WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE
PEOPLE AND BODIES THAT HAVE
BEEN TAKEN TO THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER'S OFFICE, BUT WE
HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT THERE
MAY BE BODIES THAT HAVE
BEEN TAKEN TO LOCAL FUNERAL
HOMES.

24 HOURS LATER AND YOU
COULD TAKE THIS CAMERA TO
ANY PLACE WITHIN MILES AWAY
AND FIND SOMETHING EXACTLY
LIKE THIS.

HAVE YOU AND YOUR
NEIGHBORS BEEN ABLE TO GET
WHAT YOU NEED?

IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.
