AND NOW THERE'S REALLY -- I
HAVEN'T HEARD ANY EXPLOSIONS OR
GUN FIRE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
FOR, I'D SAY ABOUT ANOTHER 45
MINUTES, HOUR AT THIS INT.

BUT YOU KNOW, I DO BELIEVE HE
WAS BLEEDING OUT PRETTY BADLY.

IT'S A VERY CLOSE KNIT
NEIGHBORHOOD.

AND, AGAIN, WHEN WE HEAR THAT HE
IS IN CUSTODY, WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?

UNCLEAR ON WHAT EXACTLY HIS
CONDITION IS, DIANE.

ONE OF OUR OFFICIALS GOT A TEXT
FROM THE SCENE SAYING SUSPECT IS
ALIVE IN THE AMBULANCE.

AND HIS EARLIER TWEET, "WE GOT
HIM."

WELL, AGAIN, WE KNOW THERE IS
THE FOG OF INFORMATION RIGHT NOW
BUT YOU DID THINK THAT YOU
OVERHEARD POLICE IN THE BACKYARD
TALKING ABOUT THE SUSPECT,
PERHAPS, TRYING TO LOOK OUT OF
THIS COVERING THAT WAS ON THAT
BOAT AND WE WILL TRY TO VERIFY
THAT THROUGHOUT THIS EVENING.

THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A
SUICIDE VEST AND, DICK CLARK,
HOW WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
DETERMINE, ULTIMATELY, IF HE HAD
ONE ON OR NOT IF THEY COULDN'T
APPROACH THE BOAT?

I THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT
OF PEOPLE ASKING QUESTIONS JUST
LIKE THAT TOMORROW.

ONE LITTLE BOY SAID TO HIS DAD,
"IT IS OVER?"

EVERYONE IS STILL HERE.

AGAIN, WE HEARD THIS REPORT
FROM AN EYEWITNESS AND IT WAS SO
EARLY AND WE WERE ALL TRYING TO
BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL, THAT THE
POLICE HAD BEEN OVERHEARD SAYING
THAT THEY HAD SEEN HIM SNEAKING
A LOOK OUT FROM UNDER THAT COVER
ON THE BOAT.

HE LIFTED UP THE ZIP COVER AND
HE -- AND AS HE WENT UP TO THE
LADDER, HE NOTICED BLOOD AND
THEN HE THOUGHT HE SAW WHAT
LOOKED LIKE A BODY LAYING IN THE
BOAT.

I WANT TO BRING IN DICK
CLARK, BECAUSEHIIS STUNNING
NEWS, DICK.

AH, WE DID HEAR THAT REPORT
OF SOME EXPLOSION.W, TELL ME AB
BOAT AGAIN AND THE PURPOSE OF
THAT?

I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE WAS
INJURED, YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY
ELSE WAS INJURED.

CONFIRM THAT THE SUSPECT IS
ALIVE.

INITIALLY THERE WAS A LOT OF
GUN FIRE, SO, WE WERE TOLD, GO
OUTSIDE, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE DID.

WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE HE WENT.
