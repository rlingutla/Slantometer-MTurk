HOLD THEIR FIRE.

WE SAW INVESTIGATORS COME OUT
AND CAR PARKED HERE LAST
EVENING AFTER THE SUSPECT
BROUGHT HERE.

THE LATEST WORD IS THAT THE
SUSPECT REMAIN HOSPITAL IN
SERIOUS AND STABLE CONDITION
STILL UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE
BEFORE THE MANHUNT ENDED WHEN
HE WAS DISCOVERED BLOOD
YEHIDING OUT IN WATERTOWN.

IT JUST POPPED UP.

BUT PEOPLE WANTING TO RUN AND
SHOW SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE OF
BOSTON AND MARATHONERINGS.

AN UPDATE ON THE 24 HOURS
SINCE THEN.

THE LAST THING YOU WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT WAS THIS.

WE LEARNED YESTERDAY THALT
F.B.I.

FEDS ARE ENVOKING AN EXCEPTION
TO THE RULE AND ALREADY THE
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES IS
SLAMMING THAT DECISION .

POTENTIAL OF IT HAPPENING.

FURTHER MORE WHEN I WATCHED
THEM MARCH INTO THE SCENE
WHERE THEY LAID DOWN THE
IED'S.

WE ARE NOT SURE WHETHER THAT
GOT THERE AS HE GOT NINETY-TWO
IN I HIDE OR AUTHORITIES
BRINGING HIM OUT.

A LOT OF PRIDE IN THAT TOWN
TONIGHT.

YEAH.

RELEASING A STRONG
STATEMENT.

THEY ARE LITERALLY ON STAND
BY.

â™ª AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE.

WE ARE TOLD ONE OF THOSE
INJURIES CAME FROM THE FIRST
SHOOT OUT.

YOU CAN SEE IT SHOWS THE SUSPECT
APPARENTLY LYING DOWN AT THE
BOTTOM OF THAT BOAT.

WE COULD ONLY HEAR GUNSHOTS
ANDS AND CHOPPERS OVER HEAD.
