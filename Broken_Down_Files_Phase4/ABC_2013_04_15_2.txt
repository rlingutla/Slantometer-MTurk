HERE IN NEW YORK, CRITICAL
RESPONSE TEAMS WERE DEPLOYED
AROUND THE CITY, AT HOTELS AND
LANDMARKS.

SO I FINISHED FIRST.

TERROR AT THE BOSTON MARATHON.

WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME INTO THE
BRIEFING ROOM A SHORT WHILE AGO,
HE VOWED TO FIND OUT WHO WAS
RESPONSIBLE AND HOLD THEM
RESPONSIBLE.

BECAUSE MOST OF THE INJURIES
WERE TO THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

COMING UP NEXT HERE ON
"WORLD NEWS," WE'LL HAVE MORE ON
THE TERROR AT THE BOSTON
MARATHONS AND SOME OF THE OTHER
HEADLINES FROM THIS DAY.

SO WE ALL STARTED SHUFFLING THE
BEST WE COULD AFTER RUNNING TO
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

WHAT CAN WE DO AT A LARGE
CROWD EVENT?

LIVE YOUR LIFE.

AND THEN, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY
STARTED RUNNING.

MOST OF THE INJURIES, THOUGH,
SUFFERED BY SPECTATORS WHO CAME
TO CELEBRATE THE FINISH.

EVERYTHING IS BEING LOOKED AT.

I SAW A TRASH CAN EXPLODE AND
PEOPLE STARTED THROWING DOWN THE
BARRICADE AND RUNNING OVER EACH
OTHER.

DESCRIBED BY AUTHORITIES AS
SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES, THERE
WAS NO WARNING, NO ADVANCE
THREAT, BUT PARAMEDICS, NATIONAL
GUARD AND POLICE WERE ALREADY ON
THE SCENE FOR THE MARATHON'S
SECURITY AND MEDICAL NEEDS.

WELL, AGAIN, DR. PAINTER, A
HARROWING, HARROWING DAY.

 AND YOU KNOW IT IS SO
DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO
PROTECT AGAINST THESE EVENTS,
WHAT ARE CALLED SOFT TARGETS AND
ABC'S DAVID KERLEY TELLS US
MORE.

I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT IN
BOSTON.

SO YOU COULD ACTUALLY FEEL
THE GROUND SHAKING?

AGAIN, ALL OF THE ABOVE, AS
ONE SOURCE TOLD ME, THEY WILL
LOOK AT DOMESTIC GROUPS,
INTERNATIONAL GROUPS UNTIL THEY
GET A SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT
POINTS THEM IN ONE DIRECTION,
EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.

AND OF COURSE AROUND THIS
COUNTRY AND THE WORLD, MAJOR
CITIES ARE RAMPING UP SECURITY
IN RESPONSE TO THE BOMBING AT
THE BOSTON MARATHON.
