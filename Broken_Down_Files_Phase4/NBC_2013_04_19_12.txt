WHAT CAN YOU ADD, CLINT?

THAT'S QUITE A REACTION FROM THE
CROWD.

HE'LL BE IN FEDERAL CUSTODY HERE
BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE
INVESTIGATION SINCE THE BOMBING
HAS BEEN UNDER THE FBI'S
JURISDICTION BECAUSE OF A
FEDERAL LAW, A TERRORISM ATTACK
IS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE
FBI.

THAT WAS THE KIND OF WORK THEY
WERE DOING TODAY, LOOKING FOR
TELLTALE SIGNS THAT SOMEONE
MIGHT BE HIDING OUT.

THEY HAVE BEEN STANDING HERE
WITH US LISTENING TO THE BEST
THEY CAN.

ALL RIGHT.

HE WAS PROBABLY WOUNDED LAST
NIGHT IN THE EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE
IN WHICH HIS BROTHER WAS KILLED.

ANOTHER POLICE OFFICER, TRANSIT
OFFICER WAS SERIOUS LY WOUNDED T
THE BEGINNING OF THE CHASE.

A LIGHT TRUCK JUST ARRIVED IN
THE FOREGROUND THERE ON THE
RIGHT.

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL
NEVER GO FOR THAT.

THEY ARE STILL OFFICIALLY
SECURING THE SCENE.

THEY WILL TAKE HIM AWAY.

LISTENING TO THEM MADE IT FEEL
LIKE THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE.

THEY WOULD STILL WANT TO GET AT
THE START OF THE INVESTIGATION
TONIGHT, SEE WHAT THEY ARE
DEALING WITH.

OF COURSE, NOW AS YOU MENTIONED
THE MEDIC IS AT THE BOAT --
YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO
THE COVERAGE OF OUR STATION WHDH
IN BOSTON AS THEY WERE TALKING
YOU SAW THE WATERTOWN EMS
AMBULANCE THAT WAS PARKED THERE
FOR SO LONG TAKE A RIGHT AND GO
DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

REALIZE LAW ENFORCEMENT, I'M
SURE AS A GROUP HAS AN
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD
LIKE TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN
LIKE IN ANY OTHER SITUATION.

CAMPUS POLICE OFFICER.

THEY BELIEVE SUSPECTS WHO COMMIT
CRIMES HERE SHOULD BE TREATED IN
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

WE WORKED THROUGH THE PROBLEM
MORE.

I WILL TELL YOU, WHAT A 24 HOURS
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ENDURED.
