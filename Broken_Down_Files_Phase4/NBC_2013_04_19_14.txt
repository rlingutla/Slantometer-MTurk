WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED IN 2000.

THE LEAPS AND BOUNDS TECHNOLOGY
HAS TAKEN.

THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING UP BIRCH
OR FRANKLIN AREA NOW.

THEY WERE NOT FOOLING AROUND.

THEY ARE ASKING FOR A MEDIC TO
THE SCENE WHICH MEANS THEY ARE
GOING TO BE TRYING TO TREAT HIM.

BOSTON P.D.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE'LL GIVE THIS A FEW SECONDS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
BE IN A WAR ZONE.

IT WOULD INDICATE -- THE
SURPRISE HERE -- IT WOULD
INDICATE THE SUSPECT IS ALIVE,
ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND ABLE TO
MOVE.

THE HELICOPTER CAME OVER AND
YOU SAID, I WILL BE GLAD WHEN
THAT'S OVER.

IF HE'S GRAVELY WOUNDED OR NEEDS
MEDICAL ATTENTION HE WILL BE
TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL WHERE HE
WILL BE GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION.

OUR ONLY SOLACE IS THAT SEAN
DIED BRAVELY DOING WHAT HE
COMMITTED HIS LIFE TO DO --
SERVING AND PROTECTING OTHERS.

HOW DID THEY COME AT THE HOUSE?

THEY USED IT AS A TEXTBOOK
EXAMPLE.

DID NOT EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO DO
HIS JOB.

THERE WILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN
PRETHIS ARREST A VERY EXTENSIVE
DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE FBI AND
THE REST OF THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW SUCH AN
INTERROGATION WILL OCCUR AND
WHAT THE KEY ISSUES ARE.

AS WE HEARD THE VOLLEY OF
GUNFIRE IT SOUNDED LIKE AT LEAST
ONE IF NOT TWO 30-ROUND
MAGAZINES FROM THE TACTICAL
OFFICER'S WEAPON.

THEY HAVE CALLED FOR A MEDIC TO
THE SCENE.

WE HAVE CONFIRMED HERE,
BRIAN, AS WELL THAT THE SUSPECT
IS IN CUSTODY.

THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT.
