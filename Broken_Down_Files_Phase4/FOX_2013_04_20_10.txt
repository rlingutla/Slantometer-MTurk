HIS ARM IS BLOOD AND HE
BROUGHT IT BACK DOWN.

PUT OUT A MEMO
THAT ADDRESSES THE TERRORIST
CASES THAT THEY COULD EXPAND
THE TIME IN WHICH THEY CAN
QUESTION A SUSPECT WITHOUT
READING THEM THEIR RIGHTS.

HE WILL BE ABLE FOR HIS OWN
SAKE.

I AM NOT SURED THAT THEY WOULD
COME TO TARGET US.

IT IS AMAZING .

HIS MOTHER INSISTING HE'S
INNOCENT.

WHY IT IS NOT HAPPEN NEGLIGENT
PAST WE DON'T KNOW.

I AM ASSUMING THAT IS
RIGHT, YES.

HAD INVESTIGATED THE
OLDER BROTHER'S POSSIBLE TIE
TO TERROR GROUPS AND TURNS OUT
THAT IS NOT ALL OFFICIALS WERE
INVESTIGATING.

CHIEF, CONGRATULATION AND
THANK YOU.

INVESTIGATORS SAY THE
SUSPECT IS IN NO SHAPE TO FACE
QUESTIONING REGARDING THE
BOSTON BOMBING.

THE F.B.I.

HEAP'S ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
BOAT LOOKING AT IT FROM THE
DRIVEWAY.

I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER AND SO I
CRAWLED OUT OF THE BATHROOM TO
PEEK AT MY TELEVISION AND WHEN
I DID THAT, I SAW HOW MUCH
ENFORCEMENT WAS OUT HERE AND I
CAME OUT OF THE BATHROOM AND
BROUGHT HIM OUT WITH ME.

WE KNEW HE WAS LOSING BLOOD
BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW EXTENSE
ITCH HIS INJURIES.

OFFICERS ARE NOT READING THE
SUSPECTS RIGHTS IN THE CASE.

I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT MY
DEPARTMENT AND COMMUNITY.

SINCE THE ATTACKS OF 9/11
IN 2001, IT A CONCERN THAT
THIS SORT OF THING WOULD
HAPPEN, AND THAT JUST A COUPLE
OF LONE WOLFLESS MIGHT
ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING ON THE
SUBWAY STATION OR SOMEWHERE
ELSE.

ALL UNITS HOLD YOUR FIRE.

THAT IS CREATING UNEASE AT THE
BUREAU.
