IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYONE
COULD SURVIVE IN THIS.

IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A TORNADO THIS
SIZE AND THIS MANY KIDS HURT,
MISSING AND LOST THEIR LIVES TO
REALIZE THAT THEY NEED
UNDERGROUND SHELTERS.

DEVASTATING TORNADO, AND SO MANY
PEOPLE ARE ASKING, WHY AREN'T
THERE MORE BASEMENTS IN THE VERY
PLACE THEY NEED THEM MOST,
TORNADO ALLEY, AND WHY AREN'T
THERE MORE TORNADO SHELTERS?

IT WAS ON THE GROUND FOR 40
MINUTES.

NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
WEATHER EVENT THAT CAUSED ALL
THIS.

WE MENTIONED SEVEN DIFFERENT
STATES HAVE WATCHES AND
WARNINGS.

THIS IS HOME.

THAT SHE'S ALIVE.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TONIGHT IS
THUNDERSTORMS ALL THE WAY REALLY
FROM NEW YORK AND CONNECTICUT ON
DOWN THROUGH TENNESSEE.

LET'S USE THIS HOUSE AS AN
EXAMPLE.

THE BASE OF THIS STORM NOW
CONFIRMED TO BE AT ITS WIDEST
POINT, 1.3 MILES WIDE ON THE
GROUND.

A REINFORCED BOX ALMOST LIKE A
BANK VAULT BUT BUILT TO FEMA
TORNADO STANDARDS, BUT THEY COST
8,000 TO $10,000 EACH.

WE'RE SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY,
AND TODAY WE HAD OUR SUSPICIONS
AND WORST FEARS REALIZED.

THERE IT IS.

I HAVE BLOOD IN MY HAIR FROM
MY FRIEND.

WITH SHELTERS.

THAT 1999 TORNADO TOOK DON
BESSINGER'S FENCE.

THE DAMAGE.

IT RIPPED OPEN THE DOOR, AND
IT -- JUST GLASS AND DEBRIS
STARTED SLAMMING ON US.

HERE IN THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA,
THE EXPRESSION "THIS HARD LAND"
COMES TO MIND, AND IT'S TRUE IN
MORE WAYS THAN ONE.
