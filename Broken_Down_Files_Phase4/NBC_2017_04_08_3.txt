PRESIDENT TRUMP A TWO
WORD WORLD VIEW.

ALSO TODAY THE
PRESIDENT IN
TRADITIONAL LETTER
FORM WROTE TO CONGRESS
WITH HIS OFFICIAL
LEGAL BASIS CLAIMING
HIS PURPOSE, TO
DEGRADE THE SYRIAN
MILITARY'S ABILITY TO
CONDUCT FURTHER
CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACKS AND HIS POWER
BY ACTING IN THE
FOREIGN POLICY
INTERESTS OF THE
UNITED STATES
REASONING THAT BOTH
CONFLICTS AND SUPPORTS
PAST CAMPAIGN
POSITIONS.

TRYING TO BAN ALL
SYRIAN REFUGEES FROM
ENTERING THE UNITED
STATES, BOMBING THE
SYRIAN REGIME AND
BOMBING GROUPS THE
REGIME IS FIGHTING
ATTACKING BOTH SIDES
IN A CIVIL WAR SOME
MIGHT SAY IS NO POLICY
AT ALL.

PRESIDENT TRUMP
DEFENDED THE SYRIAN
OPERATION TODAY AND
PRAISED THOSE WHO
CARRIED IT OUT, BUT
ANOTHER FIGHT WAS
GOING ON INSIDE THE
WHITE HOUSE.

ON THIS SATURDAY
NIGHT, RISING TENSIONS
AFTER THE USAIR STRIKE
ON SYRIA, RUSSIA TAKES
A HARD LINE, SENDING A
WARSHIP TO THE
MEDITERRANEAN, VOICING
NEW SUPPORT FOR THE
ASSAD REGIME.

REMEMBER THAT EDITOR
WHO SAID HE WAS OFF
THE TRUMP TRAIN?

THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

NEW IMAGES SHOW THE
TOWN HIT BY A CHEMICAL
ATTACK WHICH THE U.S.
SAYS WAS HIT BY THAT
BASE IT IS A GHOST
TOWN NOW, BUT THERE
WERE MORE AIR STRIKES
TODAY.

ADD TO THAT, CRITICISM
AIMED AT CHIEF OF
STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS
AFTER SOURCES SAY THE
PRESIDENT PEPPERED
ALLIES SEEKING TO
ASSIGN BLAME OVER THE
HEALTH CARE FAILURE,
RUMORS OF A
RESHUFFLING, BUT
TONIGHT THE POWER TRIO
HELD A LONG MEETING.
