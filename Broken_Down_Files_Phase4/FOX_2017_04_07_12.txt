VERY CRUDE BOMBS THAT ARE TOSSED
FROM HELICOPTERS OR FIXED-WING
PLANES.

AN ANALYST SENT THE MESSAGE THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WILLING TO GO
IT ALONE WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING
ON DANGEROUS DICTATORS, POSSIBLY
EVEN CHINA'S ALLY IN NORTH
KOREA.

GRADE TO BE HERE.

WITH THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

I NEED TO KNOW THE FACTS.

I GUESS WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER
MEASURES WE SHOULD IN ANSWER TO
THAT PROVOCATION.

WE'RE NEARING 24 HOURS NOW SINCE
THE PRESIDENT ORDERED THE
STRIKES ON THAT AIR BASE IN
SYRIA.

SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS -- IT
IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESIDENT
NOW TO COME TO CONGRESS WITH
WHAT THAT STRATEGY IS AND IF
THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL USE OF
MILITARY FORCE, THEN IT SHOULD
BE FIRST VOTED ON AND DEBATED BY
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES
AL-ASSAD LAUNCH ANOTHER SARIN
GAS ATTACK ON HIS OWN PEOPLE
THIS EVENING KILLING WOMEN AND
BABIES, THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO
TO CONGRESS BEFORE RETALIATING?

WE SHOULD RESPOND IN KIND
PROPORTIONATE WITH WHATEVER
MEASURES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION
WOULD DEEM APPROPRIATE.

THAT'S WHAT NIKKI HALEY TOLD
BOLIVIA.

IT'S WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD
HAVE DONE AFTER THE FIRST USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS OF THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE.

THEY DON'T BELIEVE THERE WERE
ANY RUSSIANS KILLED.

THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
NANCY PELOSI, IS DEMANDING THAT
PAUL RYAN IS CALLING THE
REPRESENTATIVES BACK AFTER THE
AIR STRIKES LAST NIGHT.

SEEING THE HORRIFIC
CHILDREN DEAD, DYING OR
SUFFERING SO HORRIBLY PLAYED
INTO IT AND THEN THERE'S THIS
IDEA THAT IF BASHAR AL-ASSAD
WERE TO GET AWAY WITH IT, THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS MIGHT
BECOME SOMEWHAT NORMALIZED AND
WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT
THEY WOULD BE USED AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES, WHICH PRESENTS
THAT URGENT NATIONAL SECURITY
THREAT THAT THE PRESIDENT CITED
LAST NIGHT.

THIS IS A VERY MEASURED ATTACK.

YOU CAN SEE THE RUNWAYS AND THE
ACCESS LANES.

THEN WHAT DOESPRESIDENT TRUMP
DO?

CHEMICAL WEAPONS ARE OVER THE
LINE BUT SLAUGHTERS THOUSANDS
WITH CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS ISN'T?

MORE DRONE FOOTAGE FROM RUSSIAN
TELEVISION.

IS OTHERS ARE PRAISING HIM FOR
TAKING THE ACTION.
