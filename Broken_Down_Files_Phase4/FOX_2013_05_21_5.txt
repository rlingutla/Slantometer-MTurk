OKAY.

JOHN WHAT'S THE LATEST ON
THAT SCHOOL.

SHE GRABBED A BUNCH OF KIDS
AND TOOK THEM INTO THE
BATHROOM.

SHE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.

I MEAN, AS CAN YOU IMAGINE
HAVING TO PULL ANYBODY
WHETHER IT BE CHILDREN OR
ADULTS IS JUST GOING TO BE
OVERWHELMING FOR A PERSON.

IF THERE IS ANY GOOD NEWS
IN THIS DISASTER.

HE TOLD ALL THOSE AFFECTED
THAT THEIR COUNTRY WILL BE
THERE TO HELP TODAY AND
FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

ALL RIGHT.

NINE OF THOSE CHILDREN.

HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON HIS DAUGHTER, WHO
HAS FOUR KIDS AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY GOT A
HINKY FEELING ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

AMAZING STORIES OF LOSS,
SHEP.

THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF
THEIR HOUSE.

YOU SEE THE X'S ON THE SIDE
OF THESE VEHICLES, RIGHT?

THEY ARE OKAY.

AND WITH ALL OF THOSE WHO
AS DARKNESS FELL SEARCHED
FOR SURVIVORS THROUGH THE
NIGHT TENT THE FLAG ON
CAPITOL HILL IS STILL
FLYING AT HALF-STAFF IN
HONOR OF THE VICTIMS IN
OKLAHOMA.

THE DEVASTATING ALFRED T.
MURROW FEDERAL BUILDING
BOMBING.

SAVED MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

THE MOOD OVER THERE HAS
DEFINITELY CHANGED.

WE HAVE A COUPLE PERFORM
OPTIONS.

OUR ALICIA ACUNA IS LIVE IN
ONE OF THE MOORE COMMUNITY
CENTER WHICH IS THE SHELTER
FOR EVERYBODY HERE TONIGHT.
