OH, MY GOD!

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

OH, THERE'S OUR PLAYGROUND.

CELLPHONE VIDEO FROM INSIDE AN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN THE FURY OF
THE MONSTER TORNADO.

NOT BE A WHOLE BUNCH OF CRY
BABIES.

HONEY, IT'S OKAY.

AS WE WALK TOWARD IT, THE FIRST
THING WE NOTICE, THE MANGLED
PLAYGROUND.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

WE'LL GET IT BACK TO HER AFTER
THE BROADCAST.

JUST BEYOND THAT CAR, SHE TAKES
ME UNDERNEATH THE TWISTED METAL,
DOWN THE HALLWAYS, ALL THAT'S
LEFT OF THE SCHOOL.

TEACHER WITH THE WHISTLE, TRYING
TO CALM THE STUDENTS.

YOU KNOW, IT'S TOUGH RIGHT NOW,
BUT THE SUN WILL SHINE SOON.

YOU CAN HEAR THE STUDENTS
DISTRAUGHT.

THE ANSWER IS ROOTED IN DUST --
I'M AN OKIE.

THEY HAD JUST THREE DAYS LEFT.

TONIGHT THERE ARE OTHER
PARTS OF THE COUNTRY UNDER THE
THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER.

FROM BOSTON TO D.C., AS FAR WEST
AS CLEVELAND, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
TOLD TO BRACE FOR HIGH WINDS,
HAIL, AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
OF A TORNADO.

AND THEN IN FRONT OF HER, SAM
APPEARS.

SUPERSTARS AND ANONYMOUS VICTIMS
ALIKE.

THE FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM BACK
IN THE CORNER THERE, WHERE HER
SON'S TEACHER WAS LYING ON TOP
OF HIM AND THE OTHER CHILDREN,
TO KEEP THEM SAFE.
