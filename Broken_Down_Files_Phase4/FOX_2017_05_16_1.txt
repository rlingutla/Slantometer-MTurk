AND PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
HELD HOSTAGE.

BUT ENOUGH DATA POINTS SUGGEST
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAD SOME
HAND IN THIS.

THERE WAS A 2014 ATTACK ON SONY
PICTURES.

NOW, SECURITY FIRMS HERE AND IN
EUROPE AS WELL AS THE U.S. AND
TODAY IN SOUTH KOREA ARE MAKING
THIS NORTH KOREAN LINK.

WHAT RESEARCHERS SAY THEY FOUND
AS WE APPROACH THE BOTTOM OF THE
HOUR AND THE TOP OF THE NEWS.

DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER HERE IN
THE UNITED STATES OR DOING
THINGS ELSEWHERE.

IT'S POSSIBLE THE ATTACKERS
COPIED THE CODE.

THIS IN A PHYSICAL WAY, IN OTHER
WORDS, USING HUMANS, GOING TO
THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TO DO
WHAT THEY'RE ALLEGED TO HAVE
DONE IN A CYBER WAY, THAT MIGHT
BE CONSIDERED AN ACT OF PRETTY
EXTREME AGGRESSION.

YOU ARE HERE.

SHOWS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS OR
WHOEVER IS DOING THIS CAN AFFECT
HUNDREDS OF COUNTRIES AND MAYBE
IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S A
SHOOTING WAR THAT HAPPENS ON THE
KOREAN PENINSULA, THEY CAN DO
MORE DAMAGE.

PEOPLE CAN FAKE DATA AND CHANGE
THINGS AROUND AROUND MAKE THINGS
LOOK LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.

EUROPE WAS HIT HARD.

INTERESTINGLY, CHINA HIT VERY
HARD.

SOME MIGHT TREND TOWARDS AN ACT
OF WAR.

NOW AS YOU HINTED AT, THE
PROGRAM CODE FOUND IN THIS
LATEST MALWARE, RANSOMWARE
ATTACK, IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO
OTHER ATTACKS.

BUT IT'S LOOKING STRONG.

AND LET'S GO TO OUR COUNTSER
TERRORISM EXPERT.

IF YOU FIRE A MISSILE, YOU HAVE
TO MAKE TO IT JAPAN OR SOUTH
KOREA.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THAT SOMEONE MIGHT DRAW THE
CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS THE NORTH
KOREANS?
