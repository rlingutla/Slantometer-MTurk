INJURING MORE THAN 500 AND
KILLING 59.

THAT'S THE KIND OF FIREPOWER
THAT RAINED DOWN ON THOSE
INNOCENT CONCERT GOERS.

FAMILY MEMBERS SAY THEY ALSO
CANNOT EXPLAIN WHAT WOULD
MOTIVATE PADDOCK TO CARRY OUT
THE MASSACRE.

STILL HUNDREDS OF CARS AROUND
THIS AREA.

I ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HIS
POSITION.

YOU CAN SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE
A USED ROOM SERVICE TRAY.

THAT'S THE REPORT NOW FROM THE
DAILY MAIL NEWSPAPER BASED IN
THE UNITED KINGDOM.

WE'LL HAVE MORE ON ALL OF THE
DEVELOPMENTS IN LAS VEGAS,
INCLUDING VIDEO IN JUST A
MOMENT.

A U.S. GOVERNMENT SOURCE SAYS
THE FEDS HAVE INTERVIEWED A
RELATIVE OF THE SHOOTER'S
GIRLFRIEND AND WE HAVE JUST
THE SHOOTER WORKED AS A LETTER
CARRIER AND AN IRS AGENT
SEPARATELY FOR A TOTAL OF A
DECADE.

WE CONFIRMED THROUGH A U.S.
GOVERNMENT SOURCE THAT FEDERAL
INVESTIGATORS HAVE INTERVIEWED A
IMMEDIATE RELATIVELY MARILOU
DANLEY.

THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE
SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB.

MEN AND WOMEN MURDERED AT A WARM
WEEKEND NIGHT IN LAS VEGAS.

THAT WILL TAKE THEM A COUPLE
MORE DAYS.

WE HAVE NEW IMAGES OF THE GUNS
THE SHOOTER USED DURING THE
MASSACRE.

REPORTING OF THE DAILYMAIL.COM
FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT THE
GUNMAN HAD CAMERAS REPORTING HIS
CARNAGE.

WE DON'T KNOW THAT MR. PADDOCK
USED THIS PARTICULAR SITE, OF
COURSE, BUT IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF
WHAT IS OUT THERE.

WELL, THERE'S TWO HOSPITALS
WITH CRITICAL PATIENTS NOW.

DARKENING THOSE THAT WERE KILLED
IN LAS VEGAS AND A WEEKEND
TERROR ATTACK IN MARSEILLE.

WHAT HAPPENED IN LAS VEGAS IS IN
MANY WAYS A MIRACLE.

HE SAID MANY OF THE GUNSHOT
WOUNDS WERE SO HORRIFIC, A LOT
OF THE STAFF WILL LIKELY NEED
PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP.
