AT LAST CHECK, WE RECEIVED A
TOTAL OF 37 PATIENTS.

WE WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST
AS YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE.

I KNOW THIS IS PRETTY WILD TO
TAKE IN ALL AT ONE TIME.

A MASSIVE TORNADO DESCENDING
THROUGH THE HEARD LAND LIKE A
WRECKING BALL.

WE LINE OUR KIDS UP, STRAIGHT
INTO THE INNER MOST BATHROOM AND
PUT MATS ON TOP OF ALL OF US,
HUDDLED TOGETHER UNTIL IT WAS
OVER.

AN ENTIRE TOWN IN RUINS.

STILL AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS," WE
HAVE MORE STORIES FROM THE STORM
ZONE, INCLUDING THE INCREDIBLE
ONE OF A FATHER AND SON
RE-UNITED TONIGHT.

PEOPLE DIGGING AND CRAWLING
THROUGH RUBBLE.

ARE THERE AMBULANCES GOING OUT
ALL OVER TOWN, OR ARE YOU STILL
LOOKING FOR REINFORCEMENTS?

ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD, GONE.

SOME KIDS WERE NOT FOLLOWING
DIRECTIONS OF STAYING AWAY FROM
UNDER THE, UH, SINKS AND STUFF.

I KNOW WALKING AROUND AND SEEING
EVERYBODY, IT'S PRETTY TOUGH.

SHE WAS TAKING IT IN STRIDE
BECAUSE SHE WAS SITTING IN FRONT
OF WHAT USED TO BE HER HOME,
WHICH NO LONGER EXISTED.

AND IS IT POSSIBLE, WITH
PRIVACY, TO GIVE US ANY SENSE OF
THEIR CONDITION?

WELL, THANKFULLY NONE OF THE
FIVE CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE RIGHT
NOW ARE LISTED IN CRITICAL.

BROOK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TALKING WITH US TONIGHT.

WE WERE TOLD TO GET IN OUR
TORNADO PRECAUTION SYSTEM.

THE SIREN.

AND SO MANY HAD SHELTERS.

THERE'S A HUGE FLASH RIGHT
THERE.
