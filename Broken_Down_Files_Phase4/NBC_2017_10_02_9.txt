IT'S HAPPENED
AGAIN.

MOVE BACK.

YOU ARE MY ONE AND
ONLY SHE WROTE TO HIM
LAST WEEK.

VICTIMS POURING INTO
HOSPITALS ANY WAY THEY
COULD FOR HOURS.

THE DEADLIEST MASS
SHOOTING IN
MODERN AMERICAN
HISTORY.

THEY LOOKED FOR
MARILOU DANLEY BUT SHE
WAS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY.

HE GOT HIT THREE
TIMES IN THE CHEST.

AMONG THOSE KILLED, A
NEWLYWED PROTECTING
HIS WIFE.

FLOOR OF THE MANDALAY
BAY RESORT HAD OPENED
FIRE ON 22,000 CONCERT
GOERS.

THE MOST DEADLY MASS
SHOOTING EVER.

AND THEN ONE AFTER
THE OTHER.

MIKE CROFT WAS TEN
FEET FROM THE STAGE
WHEN THE SHOTS BEGAN.

AT THE TWO LARGEST
TRAUMA CENTERS IN LAS
VEGAS, INCLUDING THIS
ONE, AT LEAST A DOZEN
REMAIN IN CRITICAL
CONDITION.

BELIEVING THE ONLY WAY
TO GET OUT WAS TO RUN
ACROSS THE STAGE THAT
JASON ALDEAN JUST
FLED.

AND WHEN WE DO,
PERHAPS A NEW TIMELINE
IS IN ORDER.

WE WERE LAYING DOWN ON
THE FLOOR.

SPLIT SECOND
DECISIONS.

THE LOSS AND TALES OF INCREDIBLE
HEROISM COMING OUT OF LAS VEGAS.

AND I GOT MY WIFE UP.

AS THE CHAOS UNFOLDED
OUR TEAM WAS ACTUALLY
STAYING IN THE
MANDALAY BAY TOWER
UNDER LOCKDOWN.
