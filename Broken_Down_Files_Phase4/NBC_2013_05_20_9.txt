IT HAPPENED JUST A FEW HOURS AGO
IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA, JUST TO THE
SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA CITY.

THAT ONE LOOKS HARDER HIT THAN
ANY OF THEM BEFORE.

HORRIFIC.

WHAT YOU SEE OVER MY SHOULDER IS
THE AGONIZING WAIT OF PEOPLE
TRYING TO GET BACK INTO THE
COMMUNITY.

AGAIN, APPARENTLY THERE MAY
STILL BE KIDS INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

IT'S AN OFFICE ON THE FRONT OF
THIS SCHOOL.

NOW IT IS THE HARD TASK OF
TRYING TO PUT YOUR LIFE BACK
TOGETHER AND TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SO MUCH
CHANGED FOR YOU IN AN INSTANT.

WE SPOKE WITH A YOUNG WOMAN THAT
LIVES IN THIS HOME.

I'VE GOT TO GO.

IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO
BEGIN.

BRIAN, AS THE SUN GOES DOWN,
IT'S GOING TO GET DARK AND MAKE
IT TOUGH TO FIND ANYTHING.

AGAIN, WHEN YOU HEAR A
SURVIVOR STORY IT MEANS, ALMOST
BY DEFINITION IN THE HEART OF
THIS STORM THAT THEY HAD
SOMEWHERE TO GO.

WE KNEW THIS SYSTEM WAS COMING.

SHE WAS NOT HOME AT THE TIME,
THANK GOODNESS.

WE KNOW EVERYONE IS AFFECTED IN
THE SAME WAY AT THIS POINT.

THIS IS WAR ZONE TERRIBLE.

SO I'M HOPING THAT SIRENS WERE
BLARING FOR A GOOD, LONG TILE.

THE SEARCH FOR KIDS, THERE MAY
STILL BE KIDS INSIDE.

HERE NOW IS SOME OF THE EARLY
REPORTING FROM THAT SCHOOL, OUR
FIRST INDICATION WE MAY HAVE HAD
A DEVASTATING SITUATION THERE.

DR. FORBES, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?
