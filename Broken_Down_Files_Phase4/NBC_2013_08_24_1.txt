YOU ADD CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO THE
PICTURE, AND THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR
THE PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT CORE
NATIONAL INTERESTS BEING AT
STAKE HERE.

WITH U.S. WARSHIPS ON ALERT IN
THE MEDITERRANEAN, THE PRESIDENT
LOOKS FOR OPTIONS AFTER DOCTORS
INSIDE SYRIA CONFIRM THOUSANDS
WERE TREATED FOR SYMPTOMS OF A
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

NOW ALL OF THEM THEY SAY
DISPLAYED SYMPTOMS OF
NEUROTOXICITY, AN INDICATION
THAT PERHAPS CHEMICAL WEAPONS
WERE ACTUALLY USED.

THE PRESIDENT MET WITH HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISERS
TODAY, DAVID, WHAT ARE WE
LEARNING?

DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS, WHICH
HAS TEAMS IN SYRIA, CONFIRMS
THAT THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN TREATED
FOR SYMPTOMS OF EXPOSURE TO A
CHEMICAL AGENT.

DESPITE THAT, THERE IS
DISAGREEMENT I CAN TELL YOU
AMONG THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISERS
ABOUT WHAT SHOULD COME NEXT.

THE HUMAN COSTS IN SYRIA HAVE
BECOME JUST TOO HIGH TO BEAR.

WARSHIPS ARE ON
ALERT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN NEAR
SYRIA.

SEARCHING FOR A SERIOUS
STRATEGY.

AMONG THE QUESTIONS, WHAT IS THE
LEGAL JUSTIFICATION FOR MILITARY
ACTION AND WHAT WOULD AN ATTACK
ACCOMPLISH?

AS THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES
WEIGH A POSSIBLE MILITARY OPTION
AGAINST SYRIA, A SENIOR IRANIAN
LAWMAKER TODAY WARNED THAT ANY
MILITARY INTERVENTION INSIDE
SYRIA WOULD RESULT IN A REGIONAL
WAR THAT WOULD NOT END FAVORABLY
TO THE UNITED STATES OR TO
ALLIES ACROSS THE REGION.

TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA NOW.

RIGHT NOW THE U.S. NAVY HAS FOUR
GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYERS IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN, TWO WELL WITHIN
FIRING RANGE OF ANY TARGETS IN
SYRIA.

THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED THIS
WEEK'S ALLEGED CHEMICAL ATTACK
AS A "BIG EVENT WITH GRAVE
CONCERN."

MILITARY OFFICIALS ARE WARNING
THAT EXTREMIST FIGURES LIKE AL
QAEDA ARE BEING DRAWN TO THE
CHAOS IN SYRIA LIKE "MOTHS TO A
FLAME."

INSPECTORS ACCESS TO THE SITE OF
ATTACKS SO THAT THEY CAN
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TELLING US
THE CASE FOR MILITARY ACTION IS
TAKING SHAPE.

WHAT'S CLEAR, LESTER, THERE
IS A NEW SENSE OF URGENCY IN THE
WHITE HOUSE AFTER THIS ATTACK.

THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IS
TRYING TO VERIFY FACTS ON THE
GROUND AND AT THIS POINT THE
WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING LITTLE,
ONLY STRESSING THAT WHILE THE
U.S. HAS A RANGE OF OPTIONS
AVAILABLE, THE PRESIDENT WILL
MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN A
DELIBERATE WAY RATHER THAN
PURSUE QUICK ACTION BEFORE ALL
THE FACTS ARE KNOWN.

ON THE TABLE LIMITED AIR
STRIKES, MOST LIKELY CRUISE
MISSILES LAUNCHED FROM THOSE
DESTROYERS, TARGETING KEY ASSAD
MILITARY COMMAND POSTS.
