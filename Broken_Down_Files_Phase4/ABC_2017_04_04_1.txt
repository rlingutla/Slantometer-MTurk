AT LEAST SOME OF THE WEAPONS
REMAINED.

CHANGE IN LONGTIME U.S. POLICY
THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD MUST GO.

OUR TEAM MAKING CONTACT WITH A
DOCTOR ON THE GROUND.

I THINK THE STATUS IN THE
LONGER TERM STATUS OF PRESIDENT
ASSAD WILL BE DECIDED BY THE
SYRIAN PEOPLE.

THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
HOLD ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AMONG THE
VICTIMS.

GASPING FOR AIR TO SURVIVE.

BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WILL DO ABOUT IT
AND WHETHER THEY NOW WANT ASSAD
TO GO.

I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, AND FROM NOW ON, IT'S
GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.

HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT TODAY
BUT HE DID SAY THIS IN A SPEECH
ON THE ECONOMY.

OVER THESE SCENES OF HORROR AND
SUFFERING IN SYRIA.

CHILDREN CLINGING TO LIFE,
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.

REX TILLERSON IGNORED QUESTIONS
ON THE ATTACK.

THE IMAGES ARE DISTURBING.

MR. SECRETARY, ANY COMMENT ON
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA?

WHILE THIS LOCAL ACTIVIST
REPORTED FROM ONE OF THOSE
HOSPITALS, IT WAS HIT WITH
ANOTHER AIRSTRIKE.

BUT THE STATEMENT ALSO TOOK AIM
AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

AND THE MOMENT ANOTHER EXPLOSION
HITS.

THAT'S NOT SPECULATION ON OUR
PART.

BASHAR AL ASSAD SHOULD STILL
BE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA?
