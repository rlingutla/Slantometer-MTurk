THANK YOU.

SHE WAS SENT AWAY.

WE DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

HERE AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
WE REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN WHO
DIED THIS WEEK, CHARLES
HARTFIELD.

NO QUESTION WE OUGHT TO LOOK
INTO THAT.

THE LAS VEGAS GUNMAN ENCOURAGED
HIS GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY,
TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY FOR THE
MASSACRE.

THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE BEEN VISITORS FROM OUT OF
TOWN HERE FOR THE WEEKEND AND
JUST WANTED TO ENJOY SOME
COUNTRY MUSIC AND JASON ALDEAN
PACKING IN A CROWD OF 22,000
PEOPLE.

THEY WERE FULL THE NIGHT THAT IT
HAPPENED BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

HIS OPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DO
IT HIMSELF.

THE GUNMAN DIED, ACCORDING TO
AUTHORITIES, KILLED HIMSELF.

THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PIECE.

A MATTER OF IDENTIFICATION,
OFFICER HANCOCK AT THE END TO
YOUR RIGHT THERE, HE WAS THE
FIRST SWAT OFFICER TO ENGAGE THE
INDIVIDUAL.

THE PRESIDENT REALLY WANTED TO
COME HERE.

WE'LL TAKE YOU TO VEGAS FOR A
LOOK AT THE CITY IN MOURNING AND
AN INVESTIGATION UNRELENTING.

DEMOCRATS ARE PUSHING THAT.

LISTEN TO THE FAMILY AGAIN.

JUST DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO PICK UP
THE PHONE.

THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING.

THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO PAY
TRIBUTE TO THAT.

SOME OF THE MOST AMAZING
PEOPLE.
