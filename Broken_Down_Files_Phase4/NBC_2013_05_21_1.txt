THE SIGNS ARE JUST GONE.

SO WE COULD PUT IT OVER OUR
TEACHER SAW THE FUNNEL CLOUD
APPROACHING AND YELLED FOR
EVERYONE TO LEAVE THE HALLWAY
AND GET INTO CLOSETS OR
BATHROOMS.

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
200-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS.

IF YOU LOOK OVER ACROSS THE
STREET AT THE HOSPITAL OVER
THERE, THEY'VE STARTED TO CLEAN
UP ALREADY.

THE TWISTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
AT LEAST 24 DEATHS INCLUDING 9
CHILDREN.

THAT IS FOR A FACT.

HOW LOUD WAS IT?

SO MOST HOMES ARE BUILT ON A
CONCRETE SLAB.

WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE
NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF TORNADO
PREPARATION IS HELD IN OKLAHOMA
CITY, AND THEY DO THAT EVERY
YEAR FOR A REASON.

WE STARTED PUTTING UP STREET
SIGNS.

AGAIN, IF YOU WERE WITH US
WHEN THIS NEWS FIRST BROKE
YESTERDAY RIGHT ON THROUGH "NBC
NIGHTLY NEWS" LAST NIGHT, YOU
HEARD OUR INTERVIEW, A VERY
EARLY TENTATIVE INTERVIEW
BY PHONE WITH THE MAYOR OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

AS AN OKLAHOMAN, IT HURTS.

FIRST OFF, TO START OUR
COVERAGE, A VERY BASIC
QUESTION, WHAT HAPPENED HERE TO
CAUSE ALL THIS?

OKLAHOMA HAS A LOTTERY TO DECIDE
WHO GETS STATE HELP TO PAY FOR
THEM.

TONIGHT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT
HERE.

WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?

WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF WATCHES
AND WARNINGS OVER SEVEN SEPARATE

BUT SHE'S ALIVE?
