BASH TAKE A LOOK AROUND
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT

SO WE DON'T GET AHEAD OF
OURSELVES IN THE REPORTING
WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT IS
THAT THE SUSPECT IS NOW
SURROUNDED IN THE BACKYARD
OF A STREET IN FRANKLIN
STREET IN WATERTOWN.

ONE MOMENT.

THERE WAS A FEW DOZEN OF
THEM THAT WE HEARD.

I WAS PRETTY SURE OF IT.

THERE IS ANOTHER ONE.

MY STANDING WAS THAT IT WAS
IN A BOAT.

WE ARE STILL HERE ON
SCENE.

PRETTY SOON YOU HAD THE
POLICE HELICOPTER OVERHEAD
IT BECAME APPARENT THAT
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE
HAS BEEN HIDING THERE FOR.

AUTHORITIES RIGHT HERE THEY
ARE BACKING IN A RESCUE
TRUCK.

SUSPECT IS ALIVE AND
SURROUNDED AND BELIEVED TO
BE THE SECOND OF TWO KNOWN
SUSPECTS IN THE BOMBING AT

COME OUT LET'S HEAR THE
AUDIO OF THE GUNSHOTS AGAIN

MISSED IT AND JOINING US

SWAT TEAM THAT HAD THAT
BOAT SURROUNDED.
