YOU SEE MAJOR CEMENT
CONSTRUCTION ALSO BEING DAMAGED.

HOUSES AND CARS PILED ON TOP OF
EACH OTHER.

HOW MANY MORE PATIENTS CAN YOU
RECEIVE?

I SAW A COUPLE BEFORE ME MOVED
TO A DIFFERENT AREA.

SHE WORKS AT A DAYCARE CENTER,
AND WHEN THE STORM HIT, IT WAS
UP TO HER TO KEEP SMALL CHILDREN
CALM AND SAFE, AND HERE'S WHAT
SHE TOLD US.

SUDDENLY SKIES ARE DARK AS
MIDNIGHT AS THE STORM MOVERS IN.

AND COMING UP NEXT HERE,
OTHER FAMILIES SENDING A MESSAGE
TO THE WORLD FROM THE STORM
ZONE, HOW ONE WOMAN COMFORTED A
LOT OF SMALL CHILDREN AS THE
TORNADO WAS BEARING DOWN.

IT'S DEVASTATING.

WE MET ONE WOMAN LOOKING FOR HER
NIECE.

SO THIS SEARCH AND RESCUE IN
THIS IMMENSE OF A DISASTER WILL
TAKE DAYS BEFORE THERE'S A FINAL
TOLL OF THE DEAD, AND ALL OF THE
LIVING ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.

NOW, I WANT TO CHECK BACK IN
WITH ABC'S METEOROLOGIST JINKER
ZEE FOR A MOMENT.

ONE WOMAN TOLD US, WE JUST WANT
TO FIND OUR OWN THINGS BEFORE
SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

EARLIER, MELISSA NEWTON SPOKE
ABOUT THE DEVASTATION SHE SAW
WHEN SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE HER
DOOR.

YOU CAN SEE THE TORNADO FILLING
THE SKY.

ANOTHER AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS
TORNADO IS ON THE RADAR, WHEN IT
FIRST POPPED OUT IN NEWCASTLE,
BY THE WAY, THIS IS BEING CALLED
THE NEWCASTLE-MOORE TORNADO, BUT
WHEN IT DROPPED DOWN, IT WAS
JUST A FINGER OF A TORNADO,
BARELY A FUNNEL CLOUD.

AND OF COURSE SO DANGEROUS.

ONE IN SERIOUS AND THE OTHERS
ARE FAIR OR GOOD.

ANY OF YOUR CHILDREN FROM THOSE
SCHOOLS, AND WHAT ABOUT THEIR
CONDITION?

SHE KNEW SHE WAS OKAY, BUT STILL
HADN'T BEEN RE-UNITED.

WE WERE LESS THAN A MILE FROM IT
WHEN IT HIT THE SCHOOL, AND YOU
COULD SEE THE EXPLOSION AND THE
DEBRIS WHEN IT HIT THAT LARGE
STONE STRUCTURE.
