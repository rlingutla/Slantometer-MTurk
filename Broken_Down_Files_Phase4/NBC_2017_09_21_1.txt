HERE MANY ROADS ARE          
   IMPASSABLE AND               
   COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS       
   ARE DOWN WHICH MEANS         
   IT COULD TAKE QUITE A        
   WHILE TO GET A HANDLE        
   ON THE FULL SCOPE OF         
   MARIA'S DESTRUCTION.

AND THIS IS PART OF          
   THE REASON WHY.

AFTER KNOCKING OUT ALL       
   POWER IN PUERTO RICO.

TONIGHT, POWERLESS       
   AND PARALYZED.

NEW VIDEO OUT OF ST.         
   CROIX TODAY SHOWS THE        
   EXTENT OF THE                
   DESTRUCTION THERE.

MANY ROADS ARE               
   IMPASSABLE.

NOW FAMILIES ACROSS          
   THE I ISLAND TRYING TO       
   PREPARE FOR THE HUMAN        
   DARKNESS OF LIFE OFF         
   THE GRID.

THE DANGER FROM          
   HURRICANE MARIA IS NOT       
   OVER YET.

AND THE NUMBER OF            
   POSSIBLE CASUALTIES IS       
   STILL UNKNOWN.

TERRITORY        
   IS WITHOUT POWER.

AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE        
   JUST NOW STARTING TO         
   GET OUR FIRST LOOK AT        
   THE DEVASTATION.

PEOPLE DIED FROM THE         
   STORM.

DARK DAYS IN PUERTO          
   RICO EXPECTED TO LAST        
   MONTHS AFTER HURRICANE       
   MARIA RIPPED APART THE       
   ISLAND'S ENTIRE POWER        
   GRID.

VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE         
   ISLAND IS WITHOUT            
   POWER.

AFTER THE STORM.

IT'S SHOCKING.

36 HOURS AFTER               
   HURRICANE MARIA              
   STORMED ASHORE IN            
   PUERTO RICO RIPPING          
   APART HOMES AND              
   FLOODING STREETS, IT'S       
   POSSIBLE WE HAVE NOT         
   YET SEEN THE WORST OF        
   IT.

SO I'M TRYING TO GO TO       
   STREETS ARE LITTERED         
   WITH DOWNED POWER            
   LINES.

BIG MAHOGANY TREES        
   THAT WERE ROOTED UP.

NEARLY ALL OF ITS 3.5        
   MILLION RESIDENTS            
   WITHOUT ELECTRICITY          
   TONIGHT.
