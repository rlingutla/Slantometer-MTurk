SHE'S BANGED UP PRETTY GOOD.

BRIAN NORCROSS AT WEATHER
CHANNEL HEADQUARTERS.

WE'VE GOT THE PICTURES.

I'M TRULY STUNNED BY WHAT I SEE.

THOSE PICTURES, SO MUCH COVERAGE
FROM KFOR AND HERE NOW A
COLLECTION OF THEIR EARLY
COVERAGE FROM THE STORM'S FIRST
MOMENT OF ARRIVAL.

THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

I'M AFRAID OF WHAT WE'LL END UP
SEEING TOMORROW WHEN MORE
NUMBERS COME OUT, WHEN THERE IS
A MORE COMPREHENSIVE TALLY OF
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

HE'S DONE HUNDREDS OF DAMAGE
SURVEYS IN HIS LONG CAREER.

AND THE ONLY ONES WE HAVE SEEN
COME OUT ARE TWO AMBULANCES WITH
THEIR SIRENS FLASHI INING ABOUT
HOUR AGO.

AS DEVASTATING AS IT GETS FROM A
HISTORY-MAKING TORNADO IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

OVERNIGHT IT WENT TO 92.

THEY HAVE ALREADY SET UP THE
LIGHTS.

I'M LOOKING AT THE PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND THE LATEST
I GOT FROM NURSES AND DOCTORS AT
TRIAGE ARE AT LEAST 24 CHILDREN
ARE STILL MISSING.

THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE RUBBLE.

MAN, IT'S ABOUT A MILE RIGHT AT
OUR TAIL.

AS WE PAN AROUND FURTHER YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO SEE ALL AROUND,
360 DEGREES AROUND WHERE I'M
STANDING ALL OF THE HOMES
LITERALLY LEVELLED TO THE
GROUND.

WE SAW THIS TWO YEARS AGO IN
JOPLIN, MISSOURI.

AT THAT TIME EARLY ON IN THAT
TORNADO THE FATALITY COUNT WAS
29.

THAT'S ANOTHER SCHOOL.

CONJECTURE IS SOMETHING WE DON'T
LIKE TO DO.
