CARS ON TOP OF CARS.

HONESTLY IT'S NOT JUST THE
SCHOOL THAT GOT HIT.

SADLY, I FATHER YOU ARE
RIGHT.

I STILL HAVE A LITTLE GIRL
BURIED IN THERE.

TONIGHT IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE COMING
OUT.

AN ENORMOUS, PERHAPS HISTORIC
PATH OF DESTRUCTION AFTER A
DIRECT HIT FROM A TORNADO
ESTIMATED AT A MILE WIDE.

VIOLENT, VIOLENT MOTION, A HUGE
DEBRIS CLOUD AROUND IT.

THERE IS A PUNGENT ODOR TO HAVE
NATURAL GAS AND GASOLINE.

WE DON'T KNOW.

SHE'S OKAY.

LOOK AT THAT SCHOOL, GUYS.

WE WERE INSIDE THE CELLAR DOOR.

WE TALKED TO ONE SCHOOL TEACHER
A LITTLE BIT AGO.

THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE
OUTSIDE OF MOORE.

AS A PARENT THIS IS KIND OF
HARD TO REPORT ON.

THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER
SEEN.

IT IS A SCENE OF UTTER
DESTRUCTION, ALMOST BEYOND
WORDS.

MIKE SEIDEL, NOT MUCH LEFT IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

WE THOUGHT WE DIED.

THESE HOMES ARE FLATTENED.
