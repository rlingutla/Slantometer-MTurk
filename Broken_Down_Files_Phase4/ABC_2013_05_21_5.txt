NO HOME LEFT, BUT HE HAS HIS
FAMILY AND HE SHOWED US WHY.

AND WE WILL BE STAYING ON
THE STORY OUT OF MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, COVERING IN REALTIME
ON ABCNEWS.COM.

AFTER SO MUCH CHAOS AND FEAR.

WELL, NEXT, EXTRAORDINARY
EFFORTS TO BRING THOSE PETS HOME
TOO.

IT'S LIKE BEING IN A MOVIE, AND
IT'S LIKE EVERYBODY'S PLAYING A
PART.

SHE'S OUT?

THEY'RE WALKING AWAY FROM BRIAR
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH TOOK A
DIRECT HIT.

IT WAS OVER.

SUDDENLY SILENCE.

TONIGHT YOU'LL MEET A
94-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO HAD THAT
ONE IN 100 TRILLION SHOT HAPPEN
TO HER.

TRAMPLING AN 18-MILE PATH
THROUGH MOORE.

PARENTS CLUTCHING THEIR
CHILDREN, AND A BOY SCOOPED UP
THERE BY A JOYFUL TEACHER IN A
BRIGHT RED SHIRT.

AND AT THE PLAZA TOWERS
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THEY'RE STILL
SEARCHING.

ANIMAL SURVIVORS RIGHT THERE
WITH THEIR OWNERS THROUGHOUT THE
STORM.

AS YOU KNOW, TWO DIRECT HITS ON
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS HERE TODAY.

I HELD MY DOG CLOSE TO ME AND
JUST WAITED TO SEE WHAT WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

AND WE WILL BE WATCHING.

SO I JUST HELD ON.

NOW THEY'RE JUST MEMORIES BURIED
HERE IN THE RUBBLE.

REBUILD A HOME HE MOVED INTO
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO.
