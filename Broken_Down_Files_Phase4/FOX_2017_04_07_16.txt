SHOULD THE SYRIAN DICTATOR
STRIKE AGAIN ON HIS OWN PEOPLE
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS, SHOULD
THE PRESIDENT TAKE OUT HIS AIR
FORCE?

LET'S LOOK IN RED.

APPROACH IN
THAT WAR-TORN NATION AND DEALING
WITH THE TYRANT HIMSELF WHO FOR
YEARS HAS BEEN SLAUGHTERING HIS
OWN PEOPLE.

SYRIA CLAIMS SEVEN ARE DEAD AND
WE'RE GETTING OUR FIRST APPARENT
LOOK AT THE BASE AFTER THE
STRIKES.

THERE WAS NO CONTACT WITH
RUSSIA.

ASSAD HAS SIX AIR BASES AND
COULD HAVE GONE AT AFTER COMMAND
AND CONTROL AND THE PRESIDENT
PERSONALLY.

SOME CIRCLED OVERHEAD AND THEN
AN HOUR LATER AT 840 P.M.
EASTERN, ALL 59 MISSILES HIT
WITHIN TWO TO THREE MINUTES WITH
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID
THE NERVE AGENTS WERE LOADED ON
TO A RUSSIAN-MADE WAR PLANE.

THE U.S. SAID THEY GAVE RUSSIA
AN HOUR HEADS-UP.

WHERE EACH BLUE CIRCLE IS,
THAT'S WHERE A TOMAHAWK MISSILE
STRIKES.

AND DESPITE ALL THIS PUBLIC
BLUSTER AND STATEMENTS, I'M TOLD
BY SOURCES THAT ALONG OFFICIAL
DIPLOMATIC LINES THERE'S VERY
LITTLE BLOW-BACK FROM THE
RUSSIANS.

60 TOM HOUSE MISSILES WERE
LAUNCHED FROM THE EASTERN M
MEREDETARIAN SEA.

OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 24,
48 HOURS, ALL THAT HAS GONE OUT
THE WINDOW.

IN TERMS OF PUTIN'S BLUSTER,
WE'RE USED TO IT AND WE'LL HEAR
MORE OF IT.

NOT VERY MUCH.

WE'LL SEE THE MANIFESTATION OF
THAT UNFOLD IN THE NEXT NUMBER
OF WEEKS.

BEN CARDON OF MARYLAND, THE
RANKING FOREIGN RELATIONS
MINISTER.

AT THE MOMENT, ALL WE'VE SAID
FOR SURE IS WE WANT TO DEFEAT
ISIS AND WE WON'T LET HIM USE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THERE'S NOTHING EASY HERE.

THE PENTAGON IS INVESTIGATING
WHETHER MOSCOW WAS INVOLVED IN
THE STRIKE ON THE SYRIAN PEOPLE
WITH THE SARIN GAS.

SHOULD THERE BE A REGIME CHANGE?
