 HOLY, HOLY.

RIGHT.

THE IDENTITY, THEY TOLD
US TO GET OUT OF THE AREA.

BLACK TRUCKS AND THE DEA
AND EVERYTHING.

RIGHT NOW THOUGH WE DON'T
HAVE THAT VERIFIED BUT
CERTAINLY HAVE IT ON HAND
AND HAVE IT AT THE READY
RIGHT NOW THEY WILL STAY
IT'S A STANDOFF BETWEEN
AUTHORITIES AND THE SUSPECT
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE
HIDING IN A BOAT.

THROUGHOUT THE DAY
WATERTOWN WAS IN LOCKDOWN
AS WERE ALL THE COMMUNITIES
AROUND IT AS WAS THE CITY
OF BOSTON.

IT MIGHT BE THAT THIS
SUSPECT IS INDEED DOWN AS
MY STATE POLICE SOURCE IS
TELLING ME.

ABOUT 10 SECOND INTERVAL
AND THEN WE HEARD A THIRD
SHOT.

WE HAVE A NUMBER OF THEM
STATIONED ALL OVER THE
AREA.

WE SAW PEOPLE WITH WEAPONS
RUSHING HURRIED AROUND THE
EDGE OF THE HOME AT THE END
OF THE STREET.

AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
HIS CONNECTION IS TO THIS
HOUSE.

WE HAVE A RESIDENT FROM
WATERTOWN WHO LIVES A FEW
BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE SPOT
WHERE THIS ACTIVITY IS
GOING.

IT'S VERY TENSE.

JARED?

AND SO NOW WE KNOW HE IS
INJURED, HE IS IN THAT
BOAT.

THEY SEARCHED THIS BOAT IN
THE BACK OF THIS HOME AT 57
FRANKLIN STREET AS WELL.

GOING AROUND THE BASE --
YOU SEE THE WINDOWS DOWN
THERE WITH THE WHITE
SHUTTERS, THEY WERE WALKING
AROUND THE FRONT OF THAT
HOME.

SOURCES TELLING US NOW THAT
THE SUSPECT IS INJURED FROM
LAST NIGHT FROM LAST
NIGHT'S CAR CHASE.

CAN SEE THEY ARE NOT
SPEEDING ANYMORE AND THE
SIRENS ARE NOT BLARING.

IT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD OF
LARGER HOMES.
