IT TAKES A WHILE TO LEARN WHEN
IT'S COMING YOUR WAY.

IT TURNED OUT HE WAS QUESTIONED
FOR A TIME AND THEN GIVEN HIS
MIRANDA WARNING AND THE POLICE
SAID HE KEPT TALKING.

IS IT ALL OVER?

THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN ALL
NIGHT LONG.

THIS FLASH-BANG TECHNOLOGY, IF
THAT EXPLAINS POPS PEOPLE HEARD
OTHER THAN GUNFIRE, THEY ARE A
BRIEFLY DEVASTATING WEAPON THAT
CAN JUST TAKE HOLD OF YOUR
SENSES AND LEAVE THE SUSPECT
BLINDED AND DEAFENED MOMENTARILY
WHILE PEOPLE MOVE IN.

YOUNGER BROTHER STILL ALIVE
BEING TRANSPORTED TO A HOSPITAL.

BOSTON GLOBE IS TWEETING OUT
THAT ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS IS
IN CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO
HEAR COPS SAY, YOU KNOW, THE
CLASSIC MOVIE LINE "COME OUT ON
YOUR OWN TERMS, COME OUT WITH
YOUR HANDS UP."

ARE MOST OF THE VEHICLES IN THE
DRIVEWAY OR DID THEY COME AT IT
THROUGH A BACK WAY?

TYPICAL TO WANT TO CLEAR IT
BEFORE YOU SEARCH.

REALLY ABOUT THE BEST POSSIBLE
OUTCOME TONIGHT.

SOMEBODY SAID, REMEMBER, THIS IS
A FEDERAL SHOW.

ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO
WOULD SIMPLY LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
IT TAKES FOR A 19-YEAR-OLD TO BE
CONVINCED THAT PUTTING A BOMB
DOWN NEXT TO LITTLE KIDS IS A
GOOD IDEA.

THERE IS SUCH A SENSE OF PURPOSE
AND DEDICATION WE ARE SEEING
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
THAT ALL CONVERGED IN WATERTOWN.

IN CUSTODY.

A FEW OF THE OFFICERS TAKING
PICTURES TO COMMEMORATE THE
MOMENT OF THIS SUCCESSFUL END.

DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

FOLLOWING OKLAHOMA CITY WE WERE
IN ROUGH SHAPE IN TERMS OF THE
ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE THIS TYPE
OF THING.

IT'S HARD FOR US TO SEE, PICK
OUT INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENT EXCEPT
THAT VEHICLES KEEP COMING AND
GOING.

THE SHOT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING
AT --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 NOW WE ARE HEARING -- LISTEN
TO THAT.

THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A BIG
APPLAUSE FROM THE CROWD AS IT
PARTED AND THE AMBULANCE WENT
BY.
