THEY WILL WANTED TO GET OUT
OF HOUSE AND WALK AROUND.

I FIRST WHAT I HEARD OR SAW
WAS I PULLED OVER AND THE
SWAT TEAM HAD GONE BY ME.

AT LEAST THE SUSPECT THEY
ARE GOING AFTER RIGHT NOW.

SUDDENLY NOW FIVE
MINUTES TO GO WE GET A
NUMBER OF CALLS FROM PEOPLE
SAYING SHOTS FIRED.

NOW YOU HAVE THE
INFORMATION THAT, AGAIN,
ABOUT TWO BLOCKS IN THAT
DIRECTION YOU HAVE SOMEONE
WHO IS SURROUNDED RIGHT
NOW, ACCORDING TO THE
INFORMATION WE ARE GETTING
FROM OUR AFFILIATE SHEP.

WE ARE STILL ARSENAL
STREET.

COVERAGE.

BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE
SCENE, IT'S A WHOLE ANOTHER
STORY AND IT'S JUST CRAZY
HOW THINGS CAN CHANGE IN A
MATTER OF A SECOND.

SO THERE IS A NEGOTIATION
PERIOD GOING ON RIGHT NOW
THIS A STANDOFF, THIS WOULD
OBVIOUSLY BE SUSPECT NUMBER
2.

OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE GOING TO
TRY TO TAKE HIM OUT ALIVE.

THE SCENE IS BECOMING A
LITTLE BIT MORE ACTIVE DOWN
THERE TOWARDS THE END.

THANKFULLY, IN THIS CASE,
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

THEY WERE WORKING TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH A NEIGHBOR AND
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
WE DO.

AS YOU MAY KNOW, WHEN THEKEDOWN HAPPENED,
SUSPECT NUMBER 1 IN THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS IN THE
EARLY MORNING HOURS OF
TODAY, THERE WERE MULTIPLE
EXPLOSIVES, ONE OF THESE
PRESSURE COOKER BOMBS WAS
THROWN OUT A WINDOW.

YOU CAN SEE IN FRONT OF
THE HOUSE RIGHT THERE ON
THE LEFT AS NIGHT FALL
FALLS HERE, YOU CAN SEE THE
BOMB SNIFFING DOGS ARE IN
THE AREA AS WELL.

AND NOW AUTHORITIES SENDING
IN A ROBOT TO MAKE SURE
THERE ARE NO EXPLOSIVES.

SO, AND THAT IS HOW IT ALL
CAME DOWN.

YOU COULDN'T HEAR A PIN
DROP IT'S SO QUIET OUT HERE
RIGHT NOW.

IT IS NIGHT FALL RIGHT NOW.

NOW, JARED IS TELLING US
OBVIOUSLY THAT THERE WAS A
BOAT ON THAT
AND THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MAY
HAVE BEEN IN THERE TRY TO
POKE HOLES TO SEE WHO WAS
OUTSIDE.
