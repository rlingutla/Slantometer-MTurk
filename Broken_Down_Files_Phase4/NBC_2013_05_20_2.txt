CARS ON TOP OF HOMES.

SEARCH AND RESCUE WILL GO ON
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

IT'S A PURE MIRACLE SHE WAS ABLE
TO SAVE HERSELF AND THE DOG AND
GET OUT OF THAT TUB.

THERE IS A TRUCK, SUV OF SOME
KIND THROWN INTO THE FRONT OF
THE SCHOOL.

REMEMBER, LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE
IN OKLAHOMA CITY MEANS THESE ARE
REPORTERS COVERING THEIR OWN
COMMUNITY.

SHE'S GOT BLOOD ALL OVER HER,
BUT SHE'S OKAY AND HER DOG IS
OKAY, TOO.

WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET
MUCH COMMUNICATION.

THERE ARE FIRES BURNING FROM
OPEN GAS LINES.

THERE ARE ABOUT 150 RESPONDERS
OVER THERE TRYING TO COMB
THROUGH THE WRECKAGE.

THE RUBBLE IS GONE.

AS I WALKED THROUGH MOORE I SAW
PEOPLE WALKING DOWN THE STREETS
WITH THEIR PETS, BLOODIES.

THAT BROUGHT HOPE TO US HERE.

I CAN GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE OF
WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

IT IS, BRIAN.

THE SCHOOL IS JUST BLOWN APART.

AS MIKE SAYS, IT IS EARLY YET.

ONE GIRL CAME BACK TO SAVE HER
DOG AND GOT INTO THE BATHTUB.

WE HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH A
SURVIVOR, SOMEONE WHO WAS
EVACUATED AND MADE IT THROUGH
THIS STORM IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

I WAS NOT IN JOPLIN, BUT AS FAR
AS I CAN SEE LEFT AND RIGHT,
ABOUT 150 TO 200 YARDS, THERE IS
NOTHING LEFT.

IT GOES ON AT LEAST A MILE DOWN
THERE.
