GINGER ZEE HAD BEEN WARNING ALL
OF US OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS
THAT THIS SUNDAY EVENING, THE
SEVERE WEATHER WOULD TAKE AIM AT
FAR MORE POPULATED AREAS.

KANSAS LANDSCAPE, MULTIPLE
VIOLENT TORNADOES.

THE STEADY AND INTENSE DOWNPOUR,
FLOODING BACKYARDS.

THERE'S BEEN NEARLY 400 REPORTS
OF SEVERE WEATHER IN JUST THE
LAST 2 DAYS.

MAJOR HIGHWAYS TURNING INTO
RIVERS.

ANYWHERE FROM OKLAHOMA CITY TO
KANSAS CITY.

THIS IS AN ACTIVE AND FLUID
SITUATION.

BUT THE LARGE, SEVERE WEATHER
THREAT GOES FROM MINNESOTA TO
TEXAS.

METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT ALL TONIGHT.

IT'S BELIEVED THERE'S
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.

IT'S MOVING TO OUR NORTH AND
EAST.

ALL OF IT UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW.

KNOCKING OUT POWER ALREADY.

AND TOMORROW, THE STORM MOVES
SLOWLY TO THE EAST, FROM
CHICAGO, DOWN TO TEXAS.

IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US.

THERE'S A TORNADO ON THE GROUND
NEAR OKLAHOMA CITY.

PUMMELING THIS WINDSHIELD IN
NEBRASKA.

THIS PLAYSET SUBMERGED FROM THE
RISING WATERS.

THE SKY DARKENING AS SHE WAS
JUST READY TO COME ON THE AIR
FOR US.

THAT IS THE STORM THAT BROUGHT
THE TORNADO RIPPING THROUGH
WICHITA, KANSAS.
