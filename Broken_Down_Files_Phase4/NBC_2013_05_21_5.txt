A LOT OF TOUGH QUESTIONS
BEING ASKED HERE TODAY.

IT'S LIKE YOU TAKE
CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
INJURED, THEN YOU START PUTTING
UP THE STREET SIGNS.

HE SAID, YOU'RE GETTING IN
THERE, TOO.

UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ONE DIDN'T.

SEPARATELY, THE CITY OF MOORE
WAS APPLYING FOR $2 MILLION IN
FEDERAL AID TO HELP BUILD SAFE
ROOMS IN 800 HOMES, BUT THE CITY
COMPLAINED THAT THE PROGRAM WAS
DELAYED BECAUSE FEMA STANDARDS
WERE, QUOTE, A CONSTANTLY
CHANGING TARGET.

WELL, GOOD EVENING FROM WHAT
HAS TO BE THE SADDEST PLACE ON
EARTH, THE MOST TORN-UP PLACE ON
EARTH, AND THAT'S THE CITY OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HOME.

ABSOLUTELY.

I FOUND A PHOTOGRAPH OF TWO
YOUNG WOMEN ON THE FRONT YARD,
BUT I ALSO KNOW -- I'VE COVERED
A LOT OF THESE.

IT WAS A MATTER THEY HADN'T BEEN
BROUGHT FORWARD YET.

WHEN SHE EMERGED, A NEIGHBOR WAS
TRAPPED IN THE DEBRIS ACROSS THE
STREET.

SO THIS IS NOT AN UNDOABLE
THING.

A LOT OF AMERICANS WENT TO BED
LAST NIGHT HEARING A NUMBER 51,
SOME OF THEM 91.

WE HAD TURNED ON THE RADIO IN
THE CAR, AND THEY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A CHILD.

PLAZA TOWERS IS ONE OF THE OLDER
SCHOOLS.

THE OLDER SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE
THEM.

A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE.

ANYTHING THEY CAN REMEMBER.

HE SAID YOU'VE GOT TO GET
THEM IN THERE.

EVERYTHING WAS BANGING AGAINST
THE DOORS AND
IT WAS THE HOUSES BREAKING APART
HITTING THE DOOR.
