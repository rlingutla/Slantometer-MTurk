TWO SOURCES SAY THE
GUNMAN BOUGHT SOME
AMMO  FROM A RECENT
GUN SHOW IN PHOENIX.

I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
FOR MOTIVE.

TONIGHT WE NOW KNOW
THE NAMES OF ALL 58
VICTIMS, 30 WITH TIES
TO SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA.

I'M GRATEFUL I
DIDN'T HAVE TO
COMPLETELY SAY GOODBYE
TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE.

POLICE NOT CONVINCED
THAT THE ATTACKER KEPT
IT TO HIMSELF.

HE ITS THE ONLY
SHOOTER,
I'M CONFIDENT HE WAS
THE ONLY PERSON
INVOLVED AND THE ONLY
PERSON IN THE ROOM.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN
THE INVESTIGATION.

THE YOUNGEST JUST 20.

MEANWHILE, ALL 58
VICTIMS KILLED HAVE
NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED.

INVESTIGATORS
EMPHASIZING LATE TODAY
THEY DON'T BELIEVE
THERE WAS A SECOND
SHOOTER, BUT A LOT OF
QUESTIONS REMAINED
ABOUT WHO ELSE MAY
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS
PLOT.

AND SOUGHT TO PURCHASE
TRACER ROUNDS, BULLETS
THAT LEAVE A VISIBLE
TRAIL IN THE DARK.

VEGAS POLICE OFFICER
CHARLESTON HARTFIELD
SERVED 16 YEARS IN THE
MILITARY, DYING ON A
BATTLEFIELD AT HOME IN
THE CITY HE LOVED.

TODAY IN CHICAGO AND
AUSTIN, STEPPED-UP
SECURITY AS THOUSANDS
GATHER FOR CONCERTS
AND BASEBALL GAMES.

WHAT THEY'RE UNCERTAIN
ABOUT IS AFTER MONTHS,
POSSIBLY EVEN YEARS OF
METICULOUS PLANNING,
HOW COULD NO ONE ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THE
MURDEROUS PLAN?

THE WINDOWS WHERE
STEVEN PADDOCK
UNLEASHED THE MURDER,
THE NIGHTMARE.

BUT DID ANYBODY ELSE
KNOW WHAT HE WAS
PLANNING AND WHY?

BAILEY SCHWEITZER,
THE OLDEST, 67-YEAR
OLD PATI MESTAS, LOVED
LIFE AND HER EIGHT
GRANDCHILDREN.

INVESTIGATORS POUR
OVER THE CRIME SCENE
BEHIND ME THEY SAY
THEY ARE CONFIDENT THE
GUNMAN ACTED ALONE.

SHOT FOUR TIMES,
SAMANTHA FERANDA WAS
ABLE TO GO HOME TODAY.

THAT IS THE MAIN FOCUS
OF OUR INVESTIGATION
RECORDS SHOW PADDOCK
EARNED AT LEAST
$5 MILLION GAMBLING IN
2015.
