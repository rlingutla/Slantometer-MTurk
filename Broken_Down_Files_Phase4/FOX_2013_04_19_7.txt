HOLD ON ONE SECOND,
GUYS.

AND SO WE KIND OF HOOKED UP
OUR DOG AND MY 20-YEAR-OLD
CHILDREN AND MY SON'S
GIRLFRIEND WAS WITH US AND
WE WERE COMING DOWN RUSSELL
AVE AND WE WERE READY TO
GET TO THE END OF RUSSELL
AVE TALKING TO A STUDENT
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU
HEARD THIS SERIES OF
GUNSHOTS.

TENSE SITUATION IN
WATERTOWN WHERE WE BELIEVE
SUSPECT NUMBER 2 IS HOLD
UP.

REPORTS THAT THE SUSPECT IS
SURROUNDED, POSSIBLY IN THE
BOAT IN WATER TOWN.

SO POLICE CAME BACK.

WE HAVE NOTHING TO INDICATE
ANY FURTHER HAVE BEEN
INJURED THERE AT LEAST AT
THIS MOMENT.

IS HE SURROUNDED BY A
NUMBER OF AUTHORITIES, BUT
HE DOES NOT WANT TO COME
OUT.

JUST FOR THE VIEWERS AT
HOME, BOB, TO KNOW WHAT WE
ARE EXPERIENCING HERE.

THE FBI FULLY SCRUBBED THIS
INDIVIDUAL SCRUBBED
MEANING THEY CHECKED OUT
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM AND
THEN EVENTUALLY WENT --
ENDED UP TALKING TO HIM
QUOTING NOW  WE DID NOT
FIND ANYTHING, THE OFFICIAL
SAYS.

I WAS JUST ACTUALLY DOING
AN INTERVIEW ABOUT ONE OF
THEM WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEING
INDOORS FOR THE LAST 24
HOURS OR SO WHEN WE HEARD
PROBABLY ABOUT 10 TO 20 IF
NOT MORE GUNSHOTS GO OFF.

ALL RIGHT, JARED, HANG
ON ONE SECOND, JARED.

THE SUSPECT IS STILL ALIVE.

IT'S THEIR REPORTERS WHO
ARE ON THE SCENE AT THIS
MOMENT.

AND WE HAVE GIVEN YOU THE
SCENARIOS.

WE HAVE JUST GOTTEN THIS
FROM A SOURCE AT THE FBI.

SURE, WHAT EXACTLY DID
YOU SEE THOUGH IN TERMS OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOW
THEY WERE CARRYING
THEMSELVES?

AS NIGHT.

BOB WARD SAID HE HEARD SOME
8 TO 10 EXPLOSIONS IN THAT
AREA POSSIBLY COMING FROM
THE BACKYARD WHERE THAT
SUSPECT IS HOLD UP IN A
BOAT THAT YOU SEE RIGHT
THERE.

IT DID SOUND MORE OF LIKE
AN EXPLOSIVE.

HERE IS ANOTHER TEAM OF
MILITARY PERSONNEL GOING
DOWN THE ROAD.
