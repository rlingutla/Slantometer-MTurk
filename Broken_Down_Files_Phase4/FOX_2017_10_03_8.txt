YOU CAN TELL THE CARS TELL THE
STORY HERE.

WE HAVE A TRAGEDY.

THE GUARD WE'RE TOLD SURVIVED.

POLICE OFFICERS SAY 23 FIREARMS
WERE FOUND THERE.

THE PAPER INDICATES HE SET UP
ONE BY A WINDOW WHICH HE BROKE
TO RECORD THE KILLING SPREE AND
ANOTHER IN THE HALL OUTSIDE THE
HOTEL ROOM DOOR SO HE WOULD KNOW
WHEN THE COPS APPROACHED.

ACCORDING TO "THE WASHINGTON
POST," THE FATHER OF THREE WAS
SEPARATED FROM HIS FAMILY BUT
STAYED BEHIND TO DIRECT DOZENS
OF PEOPLE TO SAFETY.

DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT GUN
CONTROL.

THE PAPER IS REPORTING THAT
ALONG WITH 23 GUNS THAT STEPHEN
PADDOCK BROUGHT INTO THE ROOM,
HE ALSO BROUGHT MULTIPLE CAMERAS
WITH HIM.

THEY'RE STILL INVESTIGATING.

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

FOR INSTANCE, 30-YEAR-OLD COPY
MACHINE REPAIR MAN JONATHAN
SMITH.

DURING THE MASSACRE,
INVESTIGATORS SAY THE SHOOTER
SHOT AT SECURITY GUARDS THROUGH
HIS HOTEL DOOR HITTING ONE IN
THE LEG.

PEOPLE THAT KNEW HIM SAID HE WAS
A MILLIONAIRE, HAD A HIGH STAKES
VIDEO POKER HABIT.

FIRST, TWO YEARS AGO, THE
REPLICA EIFFEL TOWER AT THE
PARIS CASINO IN LAS VEGAS WENT
DARK IN MEMORY OF ALL THAT WENT
DIED IN A TERROR ATTACK IN THE
FRENCH CAPITOL.

LAST NIGHT, THE ORIGINAL
RETURNED THE RESPECT.

AT THE END OF EACH GUN APPEARED
TO BE A BUMP STOCK WHICH
MODIFIES WEAPONS TO MAKE THEM
FULLY AUTOMATIC.

THE FBI IS ON SCENE.

FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS TELL FOX NEWS, STEPHEN
PADDOCK SENT ABOUT $100,000
OVERSEAS.

AHEAD, WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE
VICTIMS ALONG WITH THE BRAVE
BYSTANDERS THAT RISKED AND IN
SOME CASES GAVE THEIR LIVES TO
HELP SAVE OTHERS.

A LOT OF THORNY POLITICAL
ISSUES LIE AHEAD.
