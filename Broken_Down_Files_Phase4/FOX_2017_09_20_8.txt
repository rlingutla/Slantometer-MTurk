WE SAW POWER CREWS OUT ON FOOT
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE.

THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX
MARIA AS IT BATTERS PUERTO RICO.

WE'VE SEEN TREES SNAPPED, PARTS
OF WELL-MADE STRUCTURES
COLLAPSE.

THIS IS THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE
RIGHT NOW.

FEARS ARE FOR THE VERY YOUNG AND
THE VERY OLD.

THE NUMBER 1 CLIENT IS THE WATER
COMPANY.

THAT WAS 145 MILES PER HOUR
WINDS EARLIER THIS MORNING.

HERE'S A LOOK AT THE DAMAGE IN
ST. CROIX, ONE OF THE U.S.
VIRGIN ISLANDS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES
BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY WINDS.

OFFICIALS IN ST. CROIX WARNED
PEOPLE TO STAY AWAKE MOST OF THE
NIGHT AND KEEP THEIR SHOES ON IN
CASE THEY NEEDED TO RUN.

THE WINDS WERE DRAMATIC AND
POSSIBLY DEADLY.

THE RUSSIA ARE THE HURRICANE
FORCE WINDS STAYING TO THE NORTH
OF THE NORTH SIDE OF THE IDEA OF
THE D.R.

THE ISLAND'S REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS AND RIDING OUT THE
STORM IN A CLOSET EAST OF
SAN JUAN.

WERE PEOPLE EVACUATED
EFFICIENTLY?

I WANT TO THANK VICE PRESIDENT
MIKE PENCE AND FEMA DIRECTOR FOR
THEIR CALLS AND THEIR DILIGENCE.

SO COMMUNICATIONS ARE ALSO VERY
LIMITED AND THE ISLAND'S POWER
AUTHORITY IS MASSIVELY IN DEBT.

PULLING TO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND
AROUND PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST.

A LOT OF THE PEOPLE ON THE
ISLAND DO NOT HAVE COMMUNICATION
AT THIS TIME.

THESE HURRICANES CAUSING MORE
PROBLEMS FOR AN ISLAND THAT HAS
SPENT YEARS IN FINANCIAL CRISIS.

THE WINDS BEGAN AT 100 A.M.
