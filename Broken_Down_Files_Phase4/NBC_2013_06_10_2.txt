OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD BE
CONCERNED IF SOME OF THE VERY
SENSITIVE INFORMATION HE HAS
WOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF A
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE.

MICHAEL MOORE TWEETED HERO OF
THE YEAR.

UP AT HIS FATHER'S HOME NEAR
ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA.

AND TONIGHT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
IS HOT ON SNOWDEN'S TAIL AS IT
INVESTIGATES WHETHER OR NOT HE
BROKE THE LAW BY SHARING
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

POLITELY DUCKED REPORTERS.

A CHECK OF THE JOB WEBSITE
MONSTER.COM TODAY SHOWED 796 JOB
OPENINGS REQUIRING TOP SECRET
CLEARANCES.

THE U.S. WHAT DO THE CHINESE
KNOW?

SUPPORTERS IN NEW YORK TODAY,
SNOWDEN IS COURAGEOUS.

BUT THERE IS ALSO A HUGE SHADOW
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OF
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS, SOME OF
THEM CORPORATIONS WITH FAMILIAR
NAMES.

INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS SAY THE
REAL WHIZ KIDS ARE KIDS, THE
GENERATION THAT LEARNED
COMPUTERS EVEN BEFORE THEY COULD
TALK.

THEY'RE NOT MOTIVATED
NECESSARILY BY A SCAR OF 9/11.

SECRETARY CANCELED A TRIP TO
WASHINGTON TODAY TO DEFEND
COOPERATING WITH THE NSA.

WITH SO LITTLE FOREIGN EDUCATION
TO HANDLE SUCH SENSITIVE
SECRETS?

AN INTERNATIONAL MANHUNT FOR THE
29-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO SAYS HE'S
THE ONE WHO EXPOSED THE
GOVERNMENT SECRET SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAM.

HE TOLD "THE GUARDIAN" --
 I'M JUST ANOTHER GUY THAT
SITS IN THE OFFICE DAY TO DAY
AND
WATCHES WHAT IS HAPPENING AND
THINK THIS IS NOT OUR PLACE TO
DECIDE.

WITH THE NATION'S SECURITY AT
STAKE.

AND A MONTH LATER HE COPIED TOP
SECRET DOCUMENTS AND THEN FLEW
TO HONG KONG TO MEET WITH GLENN
GREENWALD OF "THE GUARDIAN."

BUT IT DOES RAISE QUESTIONS
WHETHER TOO MANY CONTRACTORS ARE
NOW IN ON THE GOVERNMENT'S
SECRETS.

JULIAN ASSANGE OF WIKILEAKS
CALLED HIM A HERO.

WHAT ONCE STARTED AS A
PROCESS OF AUGMENTING AND
FIGHTING THE WAR ON TERRORISM
HAS NOW BECOME AN INDUSTRIAL
SYSTEM.
