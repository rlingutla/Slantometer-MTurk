THEIR HOUSE IS GONE BUT
TONIGHT BOTH MOM AND
DAUGHTER ARE OKAY.

I'M GOING TO GET YOU OUT.

YOU WILL REMEMBER THE STORM
DESTROYED NOT ONE BUT TWO
SCHOOLS THAT DAY.

SHE SAYS RESCUERS SAVED HER
AND THEN SOMEBODY HANDED
HER TO HER MOM WHO CARRIED
HER THROUGH THAT FIELD TO
SAFETY.

COBB AND THREE CHILDREN
BARELY ESCAPED WITH THEIR
LIVES.

STARTED RUNNING TOWARDS
THE SCHOOL, I ASKED THE
TEACHER WHERE MY
DAUGHTER -- WHERE HER CLASS
WAS, AND SHE SAID THEY ARE
STILL TRYING TO PULL THEM
OUT AND RIGHT WHEN I RAN
UP TO ASK IF I COULD HELP
START PULLING PEOPLE OUT
TRY TO HELP SOME GUY JUST
HANDED HER TO ME.

I JUMPED OVER HERE.

WOULDYOU WILL HEAR FROM THE
MOTHER AHEAD AS FOX REPORTS
LIVE TONIGHT.

SHE HAD BEEN IMPALED,
YES.

THE MOM IS LATISHA GARCIA.

HE GOT THE STUDENTS OUT
BUT THEIR TEACHER SCREAMED
THAT SHE WAS STUCK.

SHE IS OKAY.

DAYS SINCE THAT TORNADO
RIPPED APART MOORE
OKLAHOMA WE HEARD A LOT
ABOUT THE SEVEN CHILDREN
WHO DIED INSIDE PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

AT BRIAR ELEMENTARY
TEACHERS SALVAGED WHAT
THINK COULD BEFORE THE
SCHOOL IS DEMOLISHED.

THE TORNADO MADE IT THERE
BEFORE MOM DID.

THE DEADLY TORNADO HIT TWO
SCHOOLS SEVERAL CHIRP DIED
AT PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY.

SHE SAID SHE'D HAD BEEN
RACING THE TORNADO TO GET
TO IT HER DAUGHTER JASMINE
A THIRD GRADER.

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
COULD YOU IMAGINE THIS CAME
APART THIS VIOLENT ACKENNED
NO ONE WAS KILLED?

THIS IS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE
STREET FROM BRIAR WOOD
SCHOOL.

SHE SAID NO, I'M STUCK TO
THE TABLE.
