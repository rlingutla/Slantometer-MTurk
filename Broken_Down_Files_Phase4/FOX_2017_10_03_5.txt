SOMETHING THEY HAVE NOT FOUND.

SEE ME.

HE STAYED BEHIND TO REVIVE HIS
FATHER THAT WAS SHOT.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WENT TO
HOSPITALS AFTER THE SHOOTING AND
SOME DOCTORS HAVE SAID IT WAS
VERY TOUGH TO KEEP UP AS THE
PATIENTS KEPT COMING.

FIRST A LOOK AT MORE OF THE
VICTIMS.

HE TRANSPORTED BETWEEN 20 AND 30
PEOPLE AND LATER RETURNED THE
KEYS TO THE TRUCK'S OWNER AND
THEN THERE'S TRAVIS PHIPPEN AN
EMT.

FROM BOSTON 25 NEWS, WE OBTAINED
THESE PHOTOS.

THIS IS A TRUE FEAT OF HEROISM
ON THEIR PART.

SEE ME.

HERE AT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
CENTER, 20 REMAIN AT THIS POINT
IN THE ICU.

WE ARE GETTING A LOOK INTO THE
HOTEL ROOM ITSELF FROM WHICH THE
GUNMAN CARRIED OUT THE DEADLIEST
SHOOTING IN MODERN AMERICAN
HISTORY.

REPORTS THAT THE GUNMAN VIDEOED
HIMSELF AS HE MURDERED PEOPLE.

FBI OFFICIALS DECLINED TO
COMMENT ON THIS INTERVIEW ONE
WAY OR THE OTHER TO FOX NEWS
EARLIER TODAY.

THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF PRESENCE
ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR THEY HAVE
BEEN ON BLOGS WRITING ABOUT
THEIR POINT OF VIEW.

I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY
WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
PRODUCER, JAKE GIBSON.

RIGHT NOW THEY'RE GOING BACK TO
THE CRIME SCENE IN MESQUITE.

HE MADE MUCH OF THE MONEY FROM
REAL ESTATE AND LIVED A
COMFORTABLE LIFE.

HE POSTED A STATEMENT SAYING HE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS
HAPPENED.

BUT WHAT IS CLEAR FROM THE SCOPE
OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE
LOCATIONS, THE FIREPOWER, THE
AMMUNITION, ALL OF THESE THINGS
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE LAST
24 HOURS IS THAT IT TOOK
SIGNIFICANT PREMEDDATION, RIGHT?

INVESTIGATORS SAY POD DOCK HAD
NO CRIMINAL RECORD AS FAR AS
THEY KNOW.
