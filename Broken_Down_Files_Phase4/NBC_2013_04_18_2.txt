THE FBI'S HOPE IS THAT PEOPLE
WILL SEARCH THEIR MEMORIES TO
SEE IF THEY CAN SHED LIGHT ON
WHAT'S NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION.

NO DOUBT A BIG STEP FORWARD IN
THIS INVESTIGATION.

BRIDGESTONE LOGO, THAT'S WHAT WE
ARE TOLD BY FEDERAL
INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE SEEN
THESE PICTURES FOR A WHILE BASED
ON THEIR OWN ANALYSIS.

ONE MAN SAID TO ME, I WISH I
KNEW THEM.

IT WAS A TIGHT TOWN BEFORE THIS.

ONE THING THE FBI SAID TONIGHT
IS THAT THIS IS IN ESSENCE A
STARTER SET OF PHOTOS.

BECAUSE THIS IS BOSTON.

IT MAY BE DIFFICULT BUT THE
NATION IS COUNTING ON THOSE WITH
INFORMATION TO COME FORWARD AND
PROVIDE IT TO US.

WHEN WE COME BACK HERE
TONIGHT, THE AMAZING MOMENT FROM
LAST NIGHT IN BOSTON.

I DON'T HAVE THE PRECISE TIME
IN FRONT OF ME.

THIS VIDEO SHOWS THE MEN WALKING
TOGETHER TOWARD THE FINISH LINE.

AS THEY ANALYZED MORE PICTURES
THEY REALIZED THE TWO SPENT TIME
TOGETHER.

HIGHEST QUALITY IN ONE SENSE AND
ALSO A BIRD'S EYE VIEW.

WITH RESOLVE IN THE FACE OF AN
UNKNOWN ENEMY THE PRESIDENT
RALLIED BOSTON AND AMERICA TO BE
UNDETERRED.


â™ª AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE


HE'S CARRYING A DARK BACKPACK.

WHETHER HE KNEW ABOUT THEM OR
NOT IS UNCLEAR.

AFTER ALL THE TALK ABOUT ALL
THE GOOD DIGITAL IMAGES OF THE
FINISH LINE, THE VIDEO THAT'S
BEEN RELEASED IS SO FAR PRETTY
STANDARD SURVEILLANCE CAMERA,
BUILDING-MOUNTED.

THE OTHER MAN IS WEARING A BLACK
BASEBALL CAP WITH WHITE BANDS ON
THE BILL AND A WHITE LETTER ON
THE FRONT.

PAID TRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO DIED.
