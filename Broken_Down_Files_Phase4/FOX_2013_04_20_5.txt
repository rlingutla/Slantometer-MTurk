AT THE SOX GAME PLAYERS AND
FANS SANG THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

THE LAW WAS IN 1984 .

THEY WILL PUT MORE EMPHASIS
AND MORE SECURITY.

THAT THE SAME YEAR THE RUSSIA
GOVERNMENT ASKED THE U.S. TO
INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE OLDER
BROTHER HAD TIES TO THE GROUP.

THAT IS THE LATEST FROM THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

HE SHOULD BE ARRAIGNED IN 24
HOURS AND THEY HAVE MADE
EXCEPTIONS IN THE OF OSAMA BIN
LADEN'S SON IN LAW AND
ATTEMPTED TIMES SQUARE BOMBER
F. YOU ARE AN ENEMY COMBATANT
IT COULD BE MONTHS BEFORE
COMING TO COURT.

WE'LL BREAK DOWN THE
COMPLICATED LEGAL ISSUINGS.

BOSTON REALLY BRINGING ITSAN
THEM.

THOUSANDS OF INVESTIGATORS
HUNTED FOR HIS BROTHER AND
HIM.

AND WITH THAT, THE DAY OF
FEAR ALL OVER THE REGION OVER.

IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE HE WAS
ABLE TO DO MUCH MOVING AT ALL.

THAT'S ALL AHEAD.

ITAL YENT GUTS AND GLORY,
THAT'S HOW THE POLICE CEF
DESCRIBED THE OFFICER THAT
CAPTURED THE TERRORIST ATTACK.

YEAH, WHERE AT.

LIVE PARTY IN THE BOAT
CONFIRMED.

FIRST TIME I AM SEEING IT
ALONG WITH YOU.

THAT MEANS MORE OFFICERS AND
SNIFFING DOGS ON HAND AND
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
SPECTATORS EXPECTED TO LINE
THE ROUTE.

AFTER THE BOMB, THE SHOOTING,
THE LOCKDOWN AND THE CHAOS.

IT WOULD SEEM GENERALLY THEY
WORKED AND ACCORDINGLY I THINK
THEY CERTAINLY HAD TRAINING TO
DO THAT .

DO YOU KNOW IF HE ALL DAY OR
IF THAT BOAT WAS SRCHED IN
ADVANCE.
