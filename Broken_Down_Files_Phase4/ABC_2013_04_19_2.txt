CERTAINLY, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
VERY RELIEVED.

SUSPECT IN CUSTODY.

TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FRIEND DAVE.

YES, MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS
HAVE A NEWBORN, HE CAME HOME ON
ZSH I KIND OF LOST TRACK OF
TIME, IT WAS EITHER WEDNESDAY OR
THURSDAY.

ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM TONIGHT?

COMMISSIONER DAVIS HAS BEEN IN
HERE.

FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES
TELLING US THAT THE SUSPECT IS
IN CUSTODY.

JON, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THERE
AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, IMMEDIATELY
IN THE NEXT HOURS?

AND AS WE SAID EARLIER, THE
VULNERABILITY OF THAT COUPLE IN
THAT HOUSE, THE BOAT SO CLOSE,
THE SUSPECT SO CLOSE.

TAKEN ALIVE, THEN THAT SETS HIM
UP FOR A TRIAL ON CHARGES, MOST
LIKELY, OF PREMEDITATED MURDER
UNDER FEDERAL LAW, AS I
UNDERSTAND IT, THAT WOULD BE THE
PLAN, TO TRY HIM UNDER FEDERAL
TERRORISM CHARGES, NOT STATE
MURDER CHARGES.

I JUST TALKED TO WITH THE STATE
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS AREA.

UNDER FEDERAL TERRORISM CHARGES,
THERE COULD BE.

ONE WEEK AGO, THOSE TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE BOMBINGS.

AND LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TRYING
TO, YOU KNOW, ASSESS WHAT WAS
GOING ON, SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON
AROUND HIM.

WE HAVE A KIND OF DARK AGE IN
THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WHEN HE
WAS BACK IN RUSSIA.

MANY OF THESE SAME PEOPLE WERE
STANDING ON THE CORNER WHEN THE
POLICE WENT IN AND THEY WERE
CHEERING THEN AND YELLING.

HE WENT OUT IN HIS YARD AFTER
HE WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO EXIT,
SO, THIS WAS VERY RECENTLY THIS
EVENING.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS A LOT OF
BARNS, OLD OUTBUILDINGS,
GARAGES, SHEDS AND SUCH AND I
HAVE TO ADMIT, EVEN WHEN I HEARD
THE POLICE SAYING THEY FELT
CONFIDENT THEY'VE DONE A
THOROUGH SEARCH, I HAD
QUESTIONS, JUST BECAUSE I KNOW
THE NATURE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND ALL THESE OUT BUILDINGS AND
WONDERED, REALLY, IF THEY HAD
MANAGED TO GO INTO THE NOOKS AND
CRANNIES.

THEY'RE JUST WAITING.

BUT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING
THAT THIS WAS A CASE, BEING
HANDLED BY THE FBI, BY THE
FEDERAL GOTT, AND THE
JURISDICTION WOULD BE WITH THE
U.S. ATTORNEY HERE IN
MASSACHUSETTS.
