IF YOU HEAR US DROP OFF WE
ARE TRYING TO LISTEN IN AS
WELL.

THE WAY IT ALL WENT DOWN IS
THAT SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER
WAS LIFTED.

ONCE THAT ROBOTIC DEVICE
WENT IN, WE UNDERSTAND THAT
POTENTIALLY THAT IS WHEN WE
STARTED TO HEAR SOME OF THE
EXPLOSIONS.

THEY THINK THAT SUSPECT
NUMBER TWO HAS BEEN FOUND.

THANKFULN'T
EXPLODE IN THE WAY THEY HAD
HELPED.

IT LOOKED LIKE AN ARMED
CITY AT WAR.

HE IS FROM A DIRE SITUATION
AT THIS POINT.

IT DID SOUND LIKE A FLASH
BANG.

THE HOUSE LOOKS LIKE IT IS
ON BIRCH STREET IN THE AREA
OF WALNUT STREET OF
WATERTOWN.

ESCORTED BY POLICE DOWN THE
STREET IN A VERY CALM
MANNER BUT MOVING ALONG AT
A VERY GOOD CLIP AS WELL.

NOW YOU ARE SEEING MEMBERS
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT ARE
PICKING UP THE PACE A BIT.

YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE
THERE.

15, 20 MINUTES AGO AS IT
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED TO US.

AND THERE IS TWO MORE JUST
NOW.

MULTIPLE WITNESSES HAVE
ALREADY REPORTED SOME 20 TO THERE
IN WATERTOWN.

THE INDIVIDUAL KNOWS THEY
ARE SURROUNDED.

WE WERE JUST WATCHING A
FAMILY WALK BY.

IT'S THE FEELING OF
RELIEF BECAUSE I'M
WATERTOWN RESIDENT AND MOST
OF THE DAY I WAS COOKED UP
AND I LEFT THE HOUSE.

JARED I'M GOING TO STOP
YOU FOR JUST A MOMENT TO
SAY WE ARE GETTING FROM BOB
WARD.

AGAIN, LOOK AT THE TRAILER
BACK HERE AT 67 FRANKLIN
STREET.
