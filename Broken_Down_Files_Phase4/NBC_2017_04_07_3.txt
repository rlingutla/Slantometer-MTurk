DON'T LIKE HOW THE
PRESIDENT CUT OUT
CONGRESS.

SPOKESMAN CALLED THE
ATTACK A SIGNIFICANT
BLOW IN RELATIONS WITH
WASHINGTON.

BUT BY GETTING
INVOLVED IN SYRIA, THE
PRESIDENT REVERSED HIS
PAST POSITION.

TONIGHT AS POST STRIKE
IMAGES OF THE AIR
FIELD EMERGED, WE HAVE
NEW DETAILS ON HOW THE
U.S. OPERATION
UNFOLDED, THE MESSAGE
SENT, AND QUESTIONS
OVER WHETHER THIS
OPENS A NEW CHAPTER IN
A CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT
TRUMP REPEATEDLY
PROMISED TO STEER
CLEAR OF.

THAT TRIGGERS 48 HOURS
OF INTENSE MEETINGS
INCLUDING ONE ENROUTE
TO PALM BEACH.

WE'RE
LEARNING MORE ABOUT
THE DRAMA BEHIND THE
SCENES IN THE MOMENTS
LEADING UP TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP
ORDERING THOSE STRIKES
ON SYRIA.

ACCORDING TO AN
ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIAL.

RUSSIA APPARENTLY
TRYING TO DOWNPLAY THE
IMPACT OF THE STRIKES.

THAT'S THE POLICY
PUSHED BY STEVE
BANNON, RECENTLY
OUSTED FROM THE
POWERFUL NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNSEL
SPARKING SPECULATION
HE'S LOSING INFLUENCE.

DECISION HE MADE AFTER
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE
CALLS A 72-HOUR
EVOLUTION.

BASHAR AL ASSAD'S
GOVERNMENT TODAY CALL
THE STRIKES FOOLISH
AND UNMOTIVATED.

RESPONSE FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP ASKED
ABOUT HIS STRIKE IN
SYRIA.

INCREASE ITS AIR
DEFENSES IN SYRIA.
