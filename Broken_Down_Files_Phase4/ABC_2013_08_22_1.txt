REPORTER THE FBI DIRECTOR IS
CONCERNED ABOUT RADICALS WHO
HAVE GONE TO FIGHT INCLUDING
MEMBERS OF AL QAEDA, AND HE SAID
THERE IS INTELLIGENCE AMERICANS
MAY HAVE JOINED THEM.

ARE THEY A NEW THREAT TO OUR
HOMELAND.

OUR SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT
PIERRE THOMAS SAT DOWN WITH FBI
DIRECTOR ROBERT MULLER TODAY.

RACING
TO FIND OUT WHETHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS KILLED THESE MEN, WOMEN
AND CHILDREN AND JUST HOW MANY
DIED.

WE KNOW MULLER IS ABOUT TO
STEP DOWN AFTER 12 YEARS.

ALWAYS.

HE SAID THOSE THREATS ARE VERY,
VERY REAL.

AS HE GETS READY TO LEAVE HIS
POST, PIERRE, YOU ASKED WHAT
STILL KEEPS HIM UP AT NIGHT AND
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

WE TURN OVERSEAS TO SYRIA
AND THE STUNNING NUMBERS TONIGHT
WE HEARD FROM THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, POTENTIALLY MORE
THAN 1,000 VICTIMS IN THE LATEST
POSSIBLE CHEMICAL ATTACKS, THE
WORLD STILL STUDYING THOSE
DISTURBING IMAGES, THE VICTIMS,
INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF
THIS NEWEST ATTACK.

DAVID, TONIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA
HAS DIRECTED THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY TO DO EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SUSPECTED
ATTACK, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE U.S.

TODAY A SHOCKING NEW NUMBER FROM
OPPOSITION GROUPS REVEALED IN
WASHINGTON.

THIS WAS REALLY SOMETHING TODAY
IN YOUR INTERVIEW EXPRESSING
REAL CONCERN ABOUT AMERICANS ON
THE GROUND IN SYRIA?

THIS EVENING THAT DISTURBING
HEADLINE FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT
WHAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT NOW.

SO, YES, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
THAT.

BREAKING NEWS, THE STUNNING
NUMBERS ON SYRIA, HOW MANY
PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTACKED
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND WHAT
THE FBI DIRECTOR IS TELLING ABC
NEWS ABOUT AMERICANS IN SYRIA.

RESPONSE WOULD BE.

YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT
THEY -- NUMBER ONE, THE
ASSOCIATIONS THEY WILL MAKE AND
SECONDLY, THE EXPERTISE THEY
WILL DEVELOP AND WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WILL UTILIZE THAT EXPERTISE
TO UNDERTAKE AN ATTACK IN THE
HOMELAND.

BUT THE WORLD IS REACTING
SWIFTLY AND FORCEFULLY.

U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE ON
THE GROUND FACING HUGE HURDLES
TRYING TO DETERMINE IF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WERE, IN FACT, ACCUSED.

AS U.N. INVESTIGATORS BEG FOR
ACCESS TO THE SITE, THE EVIDENCE
MAY BE QUICKLY DISSIPATING.
