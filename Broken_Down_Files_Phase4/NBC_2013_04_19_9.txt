BIG RELIEF, BRIAN, FOR FOLKS
THAT WERE POTENTIALLY GOING TO
FACE ANOTHER NIGHT OF
UNCERTAINTY THAT THIS PERSON
COULD BE OUT THERE, A PERSON
WHO'S SHOWN WILLINGNESS TO DO
GREAT HARM.

WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT
ASSUMPTION.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS
CONDITION IS NOW.

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CONDITION
HE'S IN.

FORMER HEAD OF COUNTER TERRORISM
FOR THIS COUNTRY, MICHAEL, WALK
US THROUGH WHAT IS LIKELY TO
HAPPEN NOW.

DAN, YOU ARE JOINING US WITH
CONFIRMATION OF WHAT STEVE SAID.

IS THAT CORRECT?

CLINT VAN ZANT, FBI VETERAN
PROFILER.

VERY UNSETTLING.

WHAT THE LAST 12 YEARS HAVE
GIVEN US IS INCREDIBLE HUMAN
CAPITAL.

THEY HAVE AN AMBULANCE ON THE
SCENE.

YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE
HAPPIEST CORNER IN THE
COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.

ANY OF US WHO HEARD SHOTS FIRED
IN ANGER KNOW WHAT A HORRIBLE
SOUND THAT IS.

BRIAN, AS PETE MENTIONED
DURING THE CHRISTMAS DAY BOMBER
IN 2009, WE HADN'T FULLY
ESTABLISHED A PROTOCOL AND
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW A TERROR
SUSPECT WOULD BE INTERROGATED.

BUT THERE ARE RULES OF
ENGAGEMENT THAT WILL SUGGEST IF
YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER, THE LIFE
OF SOMEBODY ELSE DO WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DO.

CAR COMING OUT.

THEY WILL REST WELL TONIGHT HERE
IN WATERTOWN.

WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD SOME
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE SAY THIS
PERSON SHOULD BE DECLARED AN
ENEMY COMBATANT, NOT GIVEN
MIRANDA WARNING AND SHOULD BE
SUBJECT TO A MILITARY-STYLE
INTERROGATION.

I'M RELIEVED.

THEN ONE OF THEIR OWN, A POLICE
OFFICER AT M.I.T., MURDERED,
AMBUSHED YESTERDAY.
