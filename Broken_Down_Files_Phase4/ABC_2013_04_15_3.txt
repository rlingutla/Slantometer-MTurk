THEY SPED INTO ACTION,
PRONOUNCING TWO DEAD ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY, TRAGICALLY, ONE OF
THEM AN 8-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

I HAD JUST CROSSED OVER THE
FINISH LINE AND WAS GETTING MY
WATER AND MY MEDAL AND ALL OF
THAT.

I HAD HEARD 26.

INITIAL REPORTS OF OTHER
BOMBS IN THE AREA, NOW
DISCOUNTED BY POLICE.

THE GROUND SHOOK, YOU COULD JUST
FEEL IT GOING DOWN THROUGH YOU.

TURNED ME BACK AROUND FACING THE
BUILDINGS.

BUT THEN IMMEDIATELY WE HEARD
ANOTHER ONE.

PIERRE THOMAS WILL KEEP WORKING
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, I KNOW.

AND RIGHT AFTER THE EXPLOSION,
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN FRONT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SHUT DOWN.

THE BUILDING WITHSTOOD THE
BLOOFT.

EXPLOSION SHATTERED THE MARATHON
AND REOPENED WOUNDS IN THIS
COUNTRY.

LOTS OF LACERATIONS.

IT SMELLED LIKE FIRE.

DID YOU GATHER PEOPLE IN YOUR
ARMS?

THE EXPLOSION WENT OFF RIGHT
BY THE FINISH LINE.

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS RIGHT
NOW ARE AT THE SCENE, THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR PIECES OF THE DEVICE
IN ORDER TO BEGIN TO PUT THEM
BACK TOGETHER TO GET A SENSE OF
WHO MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT'S NOT
THE CASE RIGHT NOW.

ALSO WE'RE TOLD IN ADDITION TO
LOOKING AT POTENTIAL DOMESTIC
SUSPECTS, THEY'RE LOOKING AT
PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE THE
BOSTON AREA AIRPORT.

THE PRESIDENT WAS INFORMED OF
THIS JUST MINUTES AFTER IT
HAPPENED AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN
TO RECEIVE BRIEFINGS FROM HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM.

IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, IT SEEMS TO
COME FROM A FAIRLY CONFINED
SMALL AREA.
