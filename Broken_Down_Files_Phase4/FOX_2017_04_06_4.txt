THIS IS A VERY BIG CHANGE OF
MIND AFTER THE ATTACK.

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE
DIFFUSED ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE IN ST. PETERSBURG AND
ARRESTED THREE PEOPLE IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SUBWAY
BOMBING.

PRESIDENT TRUMP KNEW THERE WERE
CHEMICAL ATTACKS IN THE PAST,
THAT, AS YOU POINTED OUT, THIS
PRESIDENT HAD BEEN BUTCHERING
HIS OWN CIVILIANS TO THE TUNE OF
500,000 PEOPLE OVER SEVEN YEARS.

A SYRIAN AIR STRIKE HIT A REBEL
FACTORY.

THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER POLITICAL
DEBATE AND WHOLE OTHER HURDLE.

HE CHOSE THE BAD OPTION THAT WAS
TO REMAIN OUT OF THIS CONFLICT
LARGELY.

THERE'S RUSSIANS EVERYWHERE
THERE.

THERE WILL BE A RANGE OF OPTIONS
PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT ON
HOW HE COULD RESPOND MILITARY.

WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A COMMERCIAL
BREAK.

HE SAID THE UNITED STATES IS
ORGANIZING AN INTERNATIONAL
COALITION TO RESPOND TO BASHAR
AL-ASSAD'S CHEMICAL ATTACK ON
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

THE NEWS WITH SHEP CONTINUES
AFTER THIS.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAY
THAT THE UNITED STATES WITH
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
STILL EXPLORE A RELATIONSHIP
WORKING TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA ON
AREAS THAT BENEFIT THE UNITED
STATES.

THOSE ARE THE VERY BIG QUESTIONS
THAT HAVE JUST ARISEN ON AN
ENORMOUS NEWS DAY.

LET'S GO BACK TO A.B.

PEOPLE IS A WAR CRIME.

A ROUTINE LEADER SUMMIT BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA IS
TURNING INTO SOMETHING ELSE ALL
TOGETHER.

GLENN WAS THE FIRST AMERICAN TO
ORBIT THE EARTH.

ARE WE GOING TO GO TO WAR
AGAINST THEM OR ARE WE GOING TO
TRY TO COAX THE RUSSIANS INTO
DEPOSING AL-ASSAD WITH US?

AGAIN THAT MEETING IN RUSSIA
SAYS IT WILL BE SO PIVOTAL.

HE DIDN'T ACT.
