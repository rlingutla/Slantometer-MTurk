I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR
35 YEAR AND THIS IS
TOO MUCH.

SHE SAYS SHE'S SCARED
WHAT THE NEXT SIX
MONTHS ARE GOING TO
BRING.

IT'S EXPECTED TO CUT
CLOSE TO TURKS AND
CAICOS LATE TONIGHT,
AND AFTER THAT THE
CURRENT TRACK SHOWS IT
BARRELING BETWEEN THE
U.S. EAST COAST AND
BERMUDA.

NEARLY ALL OF ITS 3.5
MILLION RESIDENTS
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY
TONIGHT.

IT IS STILL EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT TO GET
AROUND SAN JUAN.

THAT'S BECAUSE ENTIRE
AREAS REMAIN CUT OFF
THIS EVENING.

DANGEROUS STORM SURGE
AND DAMAGING WINDS
THAT RIP ROOFS OFF
HOMES.

TONIGHT NEW HOP AS
RESCUERS PULL
SURVIVORS FROM THE
RUBBLE.

IT'S TOO MUCH.

TONIGHT, POWERLESS
AND PARALYZED.

MORE THAN 48 HOURS
AFTER MEXICO'S
EARTHQUAKE.

SHE'S A SINGLE MOTHER.

TERRITORY
IS WITHOUT POWER.

CELL PHONE SERVICE SO
UNRELIABLE THAT PEOPLE
LIKE THIS WOMAN STILL
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM
THEIR FAMILY.

WE'RE LIVE IN THE
DISASTER ZONE.

POWER LINES ACROSS
THIS AREA ARE DOWN.

HARD-HIT DOMINICA
OFFICIALS CONFIRM 15
PEOPLE DIED FROM THE
STORM.

BUT THE TRUE EXTENT OF
THE DAMAGE IS NOT YET
KNOWN.

AFTER KNOCKING OUT ALL
POWER IN PUERTO RICO.

IT'S SHOCKING.
