THAT VIDEO SHOWS TWO MEN IN
BASEBALL CAPS.

EVERYONE SHOULD LOOK AT THE
HATS THESE GUYS ARE WEARING
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY
BOUGHT THEM FOR THAT DAY
MONDAY THE ATTACK AT THE
MARATHON.

SOMEONE KNOWS WHO THEY'RE.

SO, WHAT WE KNOW FROM THIS
NOW IS THAT THEY NEED THE
HELP OF THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC, BILL.

NO ONE SHOULD APPROACH
THEM.

REMEMBER, YOU SEE TWO GUYS,
ONE OF
VAD YES TAPE ACCORDING TO
THE FBI LITERALLYE BACKPACK WHERE
THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AND  TS
BE.

YOU NORTH GOING TO HIDE
EVERYTHING TO TRY TO FOOL
THE PUBLIC BUT WHAT YOU ARE
GOING TO DO IS KEEP SOME
THINGS IN RESERVE THAT ONLY
SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW WHO HAD
BEEN THERE.

BACK ON THE STREETS OF
BOYLSTON IN A MOMENT.

THE OTHER A WHITE HAT
TURNED AROUND BACKWARDS
THAT IS SUSPECT NUMBER 2.

BUT SPECIFICALLY ON THE
CELL PHONE EVIDENCE, IS IT
TRUE THEY CAN PIN POINT
EVERY CALL OF EVERY MOMENT
AT THAT HOUR OF THE DAY
FROM 200 TO 3:00 ON MONDAY
AFTERNOON AND IF THEY CAN
CAN THEY TRACE IT?

THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED AN
EXPLANATION.

THE FBI IS LAUNCHING A
SERIOUS APPEAL TO THE
PUBLIC, ARE THEY NOT?

WHAT ARE THEY SAYING DOWN
THERE TONIGHT.

THEY ARE GOING TO BE
GETTING A LOT OF FALSE
LEADS, BILL.

THE BODY LANGUAGE THEY LOOK
FOR.

MORE ON THAT AS OUR
COVERAGE CONTINUES IN
BOYLSTON STREET AS WE
REMEMBER THE THREE WHO WILL
NO LONGER BE WITH US HERE
IN BOSTON.

WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WAS
GATHERED DURING THAT
48-HOUR PERIOD?

BUT IF WE WANT TO SORT OF
LOOK AT WHAT I THINK IS THE
LEADING EDGE OF THIS STORY
NOW IS THAT THERE ARE TWO
INDIVIDUALS, BUT THEY HAD
TO HAVE SOME KIND OF HELP.

LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS
WOULD TELL YOU IT WOULD
SUGGEST THERE WAS A FAIR
DEGREE OF PLANNING IN THE
PLOT BY THESE TWO MEN IF,
INDEED, THEY ARE THE TWO
WHO CARRIED IT OUT.

THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE
TO TAKE THE CALLS IN THE
BOSTON AREA.
