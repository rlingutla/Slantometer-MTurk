AND NOW, WE ARE LEARNING HE
SPOTTED A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD.

ERIC FRAZIER, THE MARINE VET WHO
DROVE BOTH JIMMY AND SHELDON TO
THE HOSPITAL, IT TURNS OUT THAT
MARINE VET RUSHED A DOZEN
VICTIMS TO THE E.R. THAT NIGHT.

WE SEE IT IN THE FACES HERE,
AMID UNIMAGINABLE GRIEF, FINDING
COMFORT IN ONE ANOTHER.

ON THE TIP OF THE RIFLE, A FLASH
HIDER, MAKING ITS FIERY BLAST
DIFFICULT TO SPOT.

HE SENT HER AWAY, SO THAT HE
HE CAN PLAN WHAT HE IS PLANNING
WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONS.

POSSIBLY CHECKING INTO MULTIPLE
HOTELS BEFORE THE ATTACK, ALL
WITHIN SHOOTING DISTANCE OF THAT
CONCERT SITE.

5-YEAR-OLD AIDEN HUSER,
SEPARATED FROM HIS MOTHER WHEN
THE SHOOTING BEGAN.

YOU'RE LOOKING AT 1,700 BULLETS.

HEY, YOU GUYS, GET DOWN!

STRENGTH AND RESOLVE OF THIS
COMMUNITY.

HIS RELATIVES SAW IT.

HUNDREDS OF ROUNDS OF
AMMUNITION.

ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED OF THE
GUNMAN'S EXTRAORDINARY PLANNING.

AND WHAT MAKES THIS SO URNG IS
MILLING ABOUT WITH THE PUBLIC AT
THAT HOTEL, OUT IN THE OPEN, FOR
DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK.

IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT CAB
DRIVER, I WOULDN'T BE HERE,
SO -- AND DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

OUR PRAYERS FOR THE VICTIMS.

THIS ASSAULT RIFLE, ONE OF 12
OUTFITTED WITH AN ATTACHMENT
CALLED A BUMP STOCK.

THAT GUARD, STILL ABLE TO TELL
POLICE HE'D FOUND THE GUNMAN.

FRIENDS OF THAT HERO WERE
WATCHING THE NEWS LAST NIGHT.

WHAT HAS SHE REVEALED?
