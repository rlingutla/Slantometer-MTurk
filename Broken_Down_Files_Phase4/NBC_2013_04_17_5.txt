ON OUR BROADCAST TONIGHT,
CLOSING IN ON A SUSPECT IN
BOSTON.

WE HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE
DEVICES THEMSELVES AS THIS CASE,
AS WE SAID, NOW PICKS UP SPEED.

THIS IS THE CORNER OF
BOYLSTON AND BERKELEY STREETS IN
BOSTON WHERE A MEMORIAL HAS
SPROUTED UP ABOUT A BLOCK FROM
WHERE THE BOMBINGS TOOK PLACE.

AMPUTATIONS AND THREE GRUELLING
DAYS OF SURGERY, KING IS
ASTONISHED BY HIS PATIENTS'
RESILIENCE.

WELL, THEY ARE ON THE JOB
TONIGHT IN BOSTON.

A LOT OF THE SIGNS WE HAVE SEEN
FEATURE THE SLOGAN OF THE MOMENT
IN THAT CITY -- BOSTON STRONG.

OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE
WILLIAMS HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THE
INVESTIGATION ALL DAY.

SO FAR WE HAVE FOUND SOME OF THE
NEEDLES DOWN TO THE ZIPPER PULL
ON WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE BAG
AND THE WIRES AND THE BATTERY.

ONE IN PARTICULAR TONIGHT THANKS
TO THE ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES AND
VIDEOS ROUNDED UP IN THE TWO
DAYS SINCE THE BOMBING.

BUT WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT WHO
STILL ON EDGE.

ALL OF THAT HELPS.

THE TRAUMA SURGEON WHO SERVED IN
IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, SUDDENLY
FACED DECISIONS HE THOUGHT HE'D
LEFT ON THE BATTLEFIELD --
WHETHER TO AMPUTATE.

A RELIEVED 20-YEAR-OLD SARAH
GERARD LEFT THE HOSPITAL WITH
HER LEG IN A CAST.

AFTER SAVING SO MANY LIVES,
AFTER DEALING, REMEMBER, WITH
WHAT LOOKED LIKE COMBAT
INJURIES, SOME VICTIMS ARE NOW
LEAVING THE HOSPITAL TELLING
THEIR STORIES FOR THE FIRST
TIME.

ALL POTENTIALLY PROMISING LEADS,
SAYS A BOMB EXPERT.

DEBRIS FIELD TO THE LEFT.

WE ONLY CARE ABOUT THREE
THINGS IN THIS TOWN -- POLITICS,
SPORTS AND REVENGE.

GETTING EXACTLY WHAT IT ASKED
FOR.

NO WAY.

WE ARE GETTING A CLOSE-UP LOOK
AT HOW THE BOMBS WERE MADE.
