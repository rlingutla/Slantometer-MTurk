AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT ON THIS
NIGHT, 62 INJURED ARE STILL
FIGHTING FOR RECOVERY IN THE
HOSPITAL, AND 12 OF THEM REMAIN
IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

WE WILL NOT BE BULLIED.

AND WE HAVE A FOOTNOTE ON
THE TRAGIC EVENTS IN BOSTON FROM
COMEDIAN STEPHEN COLBERT WHO
USED LAUGHTER TO CREATE A
MESSAGE IN TRIBUTE TO THE TOUGH
PEOPLE OF A GREAT AMERICAN CITY.

WE GRIEVE FOR THEM.

CODE RED EVACUATION.

IF THEY HAVE A SUSPECT
IDENTIFIED, THEY KNOW THE AREA
THAT SUSPECT WAS IN, THEY'LL BE
ABLE TO THEN TRACK THE PERSON
BACK TO AN IMAGE AND SAY, HERE
WE HAVE HIM.

COURTHOUSE, WHERE ANY SUSPECT
WOULD STAND TRIAL, WAS EVACUATED
LATE THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE OF
A BOMB THREAT THAT,
UNDERSTANDABLY, WAS TAKEN VERY
SERIOUSLY.

PUT OUT THE WORD TODAY, JUST 48
HOURS AFTER THE BOMBS WENT OFF,
THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE FOUND THE
BOMBER.

WAS THE BOMBER CAUGHT ON TAPE BY
A STORE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA?

TOO EARLY TO TELL YET.

WE'RE A STRONG PEOPLE.

AS AN AMERICAN, MY HEART IS
BROKEN.

AND IN THEIR OWN WORDS,
TONIGHT AS THE PEOPLE OF BOSTON
RECOVER, THEIR PROUD MESSAGE TO
THE WORLD. 

SELFLESSLY, COMPASSIONATELY,
UNAFRAID.

THE DEVELOPMENTS CAME ON A DAY
OF UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS
AND A SERIOUS CASE OF SECURITY
JITTERS.

SO WE THOUGHT TONIGHT WE'D GO
BACK TO THEM FOR EVEN MORE, A
SPIRITED, RALLYING CRY DELIVERED
AS ONLY BOSTONIANS CAN.

THE KEY FRAMES ARE JUST A FEW OF
THE MILLIONS OF FRAMES OF VIDEO
EXAMINED IN THE LAST 36 HOURS BY
A SPECIAL TEAM OF FBI FORENSIC
EXPERTS, THE OPERATIONAL
TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.

YOU MESS WITH ONE OF US, YOU
MESS WITH ALL OF US.

FOR PETE SAKE, BOSTON WAS
FOUNDED BY THE PILGRIMS, A
PEOPLE SO TOUGH THEY HAD TO
BUCKLE THEIR [ BLEEP ] HATS ON.

IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO
MATCH THE BOMB TO THE BAD GUY.
