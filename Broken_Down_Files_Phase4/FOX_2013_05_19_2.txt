THE WEIRDEST THING I HAVE SEEN.

YOU SEE ON THE BACK EDGE OF IT
THERE IN OKLAHOMA CITY A LITTLE
PEEK OF DAYLIGHT AND PEOPLE
THERE ARE TOLD T
HEED THE WARNINGS WITH BECAUSE WE
HAVE SEEN BREAKS LIKE THIS IN
THE SKIES AND THEN SUDDENLY A
WALL CLOUD AND SUDDENLY A LARGE
FUNNEL.

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TORNADO
CONDITIONS THERE.

TORNADO WARNINGS SEVERAL IN AND
AROUND OKLAHOMA CITY.

I'M TOLD SOME OF THE LIGHTS YOU
WILL SEE THAT ARE HITTING
TRANSFORMERS GOING OUT AS THE
SYSTEMS MOVE THROUGH WITH ALL
THEIR POWER.

LIVE COVERAGE OF THE TORNADO
OUTBREAK.

IT IS NOT NORMALLY HUMID IN
NORTH TEXAS AND THE SOUTHERN
PART OF OKLAHOMA.

WE BELIEVE A TOUCHDOWN
HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK.

THANKS, JOHN.

I MEAN HARRIS, OBVIOUSLY WE ARE
THIS THIS WORLD OF CELL PHONES
AND WANNABE STORM CHASERS AND
THIS IS WHAT REALLY SCARES ME
IS THIS IS WHERE WE WILL SEE
THE DEATHS UNFORTUNATELY.

WICHITA'S MAYOR SAID THEY ARE
DOING A FABULOUS JOB.

SO DIFFERENT THAN A HURRICANE.

I SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE
THERE NOT VERY LONG AGO AND
THEY HE SAID THAT THEY WERE
STARTING TO SEE SOME CLIMATIC
ACTIVITY LITERALLY OUT OF THE
BACK OF THEIR OFFICE DOOR.

I MEAN THERE IS GOING TO BE
OTHER INJURIES AND ACCIDENTS
THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF TORNADO
BUT NOT THE TORNADO ITSELF AND
THAT IS THE IMPORTANT THING
TOO.

ONE OF THE MAIN INGREDIENTS WE
NEED FOR THE STORMS IS THE WARM
AIR AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND
LOOK AT THIS HARRIS TALKING
FRONT.

I'LL SEE IF I CAN GET YOU
ANOTHER VIEW OF IT.

OKLAHOMA CITY AND THEN SOUTH OF
OKLAHOMA CITY, THE VERY FIRST
REPORT [BREAK IN AUDIO] AND
THAT IS ABOUT 17 MILES NORTH OF
OKLAHOMA CITY, DEBRIS BUT NO
INJURIES WE ARE TOLD.

ZOOM DOWN RIGHT THERE AND THEN
TAKE A PEEK AT THAT WITH THE
VELOCITY SHOTS BECAUSE THIS
HAPPENS TO BE ACTUALLY SHOWING
THE STRONG ROTATION.

WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK
WITH JENNIFER MONROE THE PUBLIC
INFORMATION SPECIALIST FOR THE
TOWN OF EDMOND, OKLAHOMA JUST
OUTSIDE OF OKLAHOMA CITY WHERE
THEY HAVE SEEN SO MUCH
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AND DANGEROUS
CONDITIONS AND EVEN SOME
INJURIES.

PARKED, OF COURSE.
