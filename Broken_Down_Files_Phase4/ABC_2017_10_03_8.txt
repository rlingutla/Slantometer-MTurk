THE SURGEON TOLD US THAT BOTH
OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO
BE OKAY.

DANLEY, WHO USES AN AUSTRALIAN
PASSPORT, TRAVELED TO HER HOME
COUNTRY, THE PHILIPPINES, TWO
WEEKS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, ON
PADDOCK ACTUALLY VISITED HER
FAMILY IN THE PHILIPPINES FOUR
YEARS AGO.

STILL WANTS TO MEET THAT HERO,
AND HIS MOM AND DAD WOULD LIKE
TO MEET HIM, TOO.

TONIGHT, THE SURVIVORS.

THEN, OFFICERS AND SECURITY
GUARDS SPOT THE SHOOTER.

I JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S A
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD IT A LOT
WORSE.

ONE OF THEM, A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL
BROUGHT ON THE BACK OF A PICKUP
TRUCK.

THE OTHER INSIDE HIS ROOM.

IT'S KIND OF STARTING TO, BUT --
NOT FULLY.

BRIAN ROSS JOINS US LIVE
TONIGHT.
