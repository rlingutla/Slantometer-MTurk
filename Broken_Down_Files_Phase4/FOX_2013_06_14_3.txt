ED SNOWDEN WILL PAY THE PRICE
FOR EXPOSING NATIONAL
SURVEILLANCE AGENCY SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS.

IT READS IN PART, QUOTING HERE,
MAYBE HE HAS MORE EVIDENCE.

BRITISH OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL
NOT ALLOW HIM INTO THE COUNTRY.

THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD
LET HIM SPEAK OUT AND ACCORDING
TO WHETHER THE INFORMATION IS
PUBLIC, USE IT AS EVIDENCE TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE UNITED STATES
OPENLY OR IN PRIVATE.

I HAD ACCESS TO, YOU KNOW,
THE FULL ROSTERS OF EVERYONE
WORKING AT THE NSA.

NOW THERE'S WORD THE FORMER NSA
CONTRACTOR COPIED THE CLASSIFIED
DOCUMENTS USING A DEVICE YOU MAY
ALREADY OWN.

NOW WORD ON WHETHER THEY GOT ANY
INFORMATION AND NO COMMENT FROM
THE FBI.

BUT BECAUSE HE WAS A SYSTEMS
ADMINISTRATOR HE WOULD HAVE MORE
LATITUDE TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF
STORAGE DEVICE ON HIM.

NOW "THE LOS ANGELES TIMES"
IS RT ROING THAT SNOWDEN SNUCK
THE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS OUT OF
THE U.S. ON A THUMB DRIVE LIKE
THIS.

AT LAST WORD, THAT PERSON WAS
REPORTEDLY HIDING OUT IN HONG
KONG THREATENING TO REVEAL MORE
SECRETS.

NOW ONE COMMUNIST BACKED
NEWSPAPER IN CHINA IS SUGGESTING
THE GOVERNMENT HANG ON TO
SNOWDEN FOR A WHILE.
