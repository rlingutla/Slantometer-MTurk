IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL
JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE,
BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A
MANY STATES IN THE UNION.

WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE
BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF
THE HURRICANES.

NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF
PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT
GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME
AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS
THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS
STATION IN PUERTO RICO.

MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN
LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT
WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY,
A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA
MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.

MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT
THE ISLAND.

IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.

3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN
THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION,
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET
WORSE.

I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE
IS A.

WATER FLOWS FROM THE DAM ON THE
NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND,
WHERE OFFICIALS TOLD THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.

PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AND AT
SAN JUAN TO LINE UP TO BUY GAS.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GAS TO GO
AROUND.

IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.

NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.

I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL
HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE
WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.

THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR
HIMSELF.

OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH
STRONGER.

EMERGENCY WORKERS DELIVERED MORE
THAN 1 MILLION AND A HALF
GALLONS OF WATER TO THE ISLAND.

HERE'S THE LATEST TRACK FOR YOU,
FORECASTERS SAY THEY DO NOT
EXPECT THAT CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE
UNITED STATES AT ALL.

THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.
