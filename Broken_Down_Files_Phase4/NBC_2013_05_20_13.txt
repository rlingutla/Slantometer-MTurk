WE'LL TAKE A BREAK.

YOU HAVE TO SET UP SOME
STRUCTURE AND SEARCH PROPERTY BY
PROPERTY.

MUCH OF THE CITY OF MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, HAS BEEN WIPED OUT.

THEY ARE GATHERING RIGHT NOW,
SETTING UP COMMAND POSTS, TRYING
TO BE ORDERLY IN HOW THEY
RESPOND TO THIS.

WE'LL SHOW YOU LATER.

ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION AT
DIFFERENT POINTS IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, IS EARTH HAS BEEN
WIPED CLEAN.

WHEN YOU ARE AT GROUND LEVEL IN
THIS DEBRIS FIELD IT ALL LOOKS
THE SAME.

EVEN OUT WHERE WE PARKED ON THE
FRINGE NEAR I-35 IT'S NOT BIG
DEBRIS, BUT THERE IS DEBRIS
EVERYWHERE.

STORM CELLAR, BASEMENT OR SAFE
ROOM.

YOU KNOW, WE REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO TALK TO ANYBODY COMING
OUT.

THERE ARE SEVEN OR EIGHT
AMBULANCES WAITING.

MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT
BEING ALLOWED BACK INTO THEIR
HOMES.

EVERYTHING IS GONE.

IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL DAY INTO
THIS EVENING IN OKLAHOMA CITY IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA, TO BE SPECIFIC.

SPEAKING OF THE PARALYSIS, THE
USAGE OF CELL PHONES HAS MADE
TRYING TO USE THE CELL PHONES
BASICALLY USELESS.

 A SPECIAL GOOD EVENING TO
OUR VIEWERS IN THE WESTERN PART
OF THE UNITED STATES THIS
EVENING.

MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN TRYING
FOR HOURS.

PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE CALLS
IN NOW ASKING US, DO OUR PHONES
WORK, AND THEY DON'T EITHER.

THE ONLY VEHICLES WE ARE SEEING
GO IN ARE AMBULANCES, STATE
TROOPERS, POLICE, UTILITY
COMPANIES.

I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF GETTING
CLOSER THAN I WANT TO BE TO IT
RIGHT NOW.
