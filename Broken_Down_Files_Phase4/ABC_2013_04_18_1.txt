OFF TO THE SIDE OF THIS VIDEO,
RUNNERS CAN BE SEEN HEADING TO
THE FINISH LINE AND TIME CODE
MARKERS INDICATE THE FOOTAGE WAS
MADE ABOUT 13 MINUTES BEFORE THE
FIRST BOMB WENT OFF.

IT LOOKED TO ME THAT ONE OF
THE COMPONENTS WAS A RADIO
RECEIVER.

THE SOURCE SAID IT'S A
TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS BUT A TOP
PRIORITY.

THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS DEAD ON.

THE FBI CONSIDERS THEM ARMED,
DANGEROUS, ASKED THAT NO ONE
APPROACH THEM.

IS WHAT ONE OFFICIAL CALLED AN
ELECTRONIC DRAGNET, PUSHING
THESE IMAGES FAR AND WIDE TO
ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN THE HUNT.

BUT THEY ASK ALL MEMBERS OF THE
PUBLIC TO LOOK AT THESE TAPES,
TO STUDY THEM IN DETAIL AND
HELP.

WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

THE OFFICIALS SAID A MASSIVE
EFFORT IS UNDER WAY TO CAPTURE
EVERY CELLPHONE CALL IN THAT
LOCAL AREA AT THE TIME OF THE
BOMBINGS, TO SEE IF THEY CAN
TRACE IT BACK TO THE BOMBER.

THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO LINED
THE STREETS OUTSIDE OF THE
CHURCH HERE TODAY, THEY COULDN'T
HEAR PRESIDENT OBAMA OR ANYONE
ELSE INSIDE.

AS YOU SAY, DESCRIBED AS ARMED
AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

[ APPLAUSE ]
 NOT HERE IN BOSTON,
NOT HERE IN BOSTON.

BROUGHT THEM TO THEIR FEET.

AMONG THEM FAMILIES OF THE
VICTIMS.

TWO PEOPLE CALLED PERSONS OF
INTEREST IN THE MARATHON-DAY
BOMBINGS.

INSTRUCTIONS ON THE INTERNET
ABOUT HOW TO USE A REMOTE
CONTROLLED TOY CAR TO SET OFF A
BOMB, BOTH FROM "THE ANARCHIST
COOKBOOK" AND SEVERAL JIHADIST
SITES AS WELL.

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN SEE
AS YOU LOOK AT THE TAPE IS THAT
THE BLACK BACKPACK IS ONE
CRITICAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

IF THEY SOUGHT TO INTIMIDATE
US, TO TERRORIZE US, IT SHOULD
BE PRETTY CLEAR BY NOW THAT THEY
PICKED THE WRONG CITY TO DO IT.

BUT THEY WARN THESE ARE
DANGEROUS MEN.

WE ARE RELEASING PHOTOS OF
THESE TWO SUSPECTS.
