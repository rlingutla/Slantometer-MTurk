ARE TO BELIEVE THAT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRACKS
EVERY SINGLE THING WE DO,
YET, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
CANNOT LOCATE A 29-YEAR-OLD
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT.

ALSO ON CAPITOL HILL THE
HEAD OF THE NSA AND U.S.
CYBER COMMAND JEN KEITH
ALEXANDER WHOSE PROGRAMS
ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE
LEAKS.

PLUS THE MAN BEHIND THE
BIGGEST INTELLIGENCE LEAK
IN A GENERATION.

BUT HE MAY NOT BE THROUGH
TALKING.

THEY SAY THAT WILL PROVE
THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE
FEDS UNFETTERED ACCESS TO
THEIR SERVERS GOOMG TO
REPORTERS PUT THE LETTER IN
WRITING TO THE ERIC HOLDER
AND FBI DIRECTOR ROBERT
MUELLER.

RARE BRIEFING OF THE FULL
HOUSE BY SENIOR AT THE    DEPUTIES
AT
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FBI
AND NATIONAL SECURITY
AGENCY ABOUT THE DATA
COLLECTION PROGRAM.

THE ACLU LAWSUIT SHEP,
GOES EVEN A STEP FURTHER
THAN WHAT YOU SAID
ACCUSING THE GOVERNMENT OF
VIOLATING OUR VERY RIGHT OF
ASSOCIATION.

BUT ALSO BY THE PARENTS OF
MICHAEL STRANGE.

1984 WAS PUBLISHED BASS IN
194, IT TELLS OF A NEAR
FUTURE WORLD IN WHICH
NEARLY ALL OF OUR
ACTIVITIES ARE UNDER
SURVEILLANCE GOVERNMENT
SURVEILLANCE AND MIND
CONTROL.

AMAZON.COM REPORT THAT
SALES OF THE PAPERBACK
VERSION OF THAT BOOK HAVE
TRIPLED OVER THE LAST 24
HOURS.

THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
WENT EVEN FURTHER.

THE SECOND LAWSUIT WAS
FILED BY A FORMER DOJ
PROSECUTOR WHO HAS SUED THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
BEFORE.

IT SHOWS OUR ADVERSARIES
WHAT OUR CAPABILITIES ARE.

ARE YOU WILLING TO SAY
WHETHER YOU SEE SNOWDEN AS
A WHISTLEBLOWER?

TONIGHT, THE DEMOCRATIC
SENATOR OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
DIANNE FEINSTEIN SAYING THE
DECLASSIFYING INFORMATION
ON THE NSA PROGRAMS WOULD
SHOW SO.

THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS
INFORMATION PUTS AMERICANS
AT RISK.

LAWMAKERS PRESSING
WITNESSES ON HOW A
29-YEAR-OLD CONTRACTOR GOT
A HIGH LEVEL SECURITY
CLEARANCE.

YOU CAN'T COME FORWARD
AGAINST THE WORLD'S MOST
POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY AND BE COMPLETELY
FREE FROM RISK BECAUSE THEY
ARE SUCH POWERFUL
ADVERSARIES THAT NO ONE CAN
MEANINGFULLY OPPOSE THEM.

SOME OF THE MEDIA
ACCOUNTS I HAVE READ BASED
ON THE LEAKS DO NOT PAINT A
COMPLETE AND ACCURATE
PORTRAYAL HOW THE PROGRAMS
WORK AND HOW THE SAFEGUARDS
THAT EXIST FOR THE PROGRAM
WORK.

THE FEDS ARE GIVING MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPY
PROGRAMS.
