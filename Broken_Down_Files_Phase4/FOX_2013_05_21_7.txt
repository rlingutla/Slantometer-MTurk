I DON'T KNOW WHAT I
WOULD HAVE DONE IF I HAD
LOST MY GRAND KIDS.

AMAZING STORIES OF
SURVIVAL.

EMPTINESS HERE IN MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

ANOTHER HORRIBLE STORM IN
2003.

ONE OF CHRIS' CHILDREN IS A
KINDERGARTNER AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY.

YOU ARE A VERY LUCKY MAN.

I HAVEN'T GIVE IT MUCH
FUTURE THOUGHT YET.

OKLAHOMA NEEDS YOUR PRAYERS
AND YOUR HELP.

BUT AMID THE DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION A SYMBOL OF
STRENGTH.

RESCUE CREWS SEARCHING FOR
SURVIVORS YESTERDAY FOUND
AN AMERICAN FLAG AND RAISED
OLD GLORY ABOVE THE RUBBLE.

IT'S OKLAHOMA.

THEY ARE IN FRONT OF
BRENDA'S HOUSE OR WHAT
REMAINS OF IT.

JIM GARNER, HIS DAUGHTER
AND 10 CHILDREN RODE OUT
THIS TORNADO IN UNDERGROUND
STORM SHELTER SHEP.

WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU THE
DEVASTATION AND CLEANUP AS
THE NEWSCAST CONTINUES.

PRETTY GOOD.

PEOPLE TO STAY WITH AND
SOME SUPPORT AROUND YOU?

IT'S VERY EASY.

I DON'T KNOW HOW BAD IT IS
YET.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO
DONATE.

HAVE THEY SEEMED OKAY?
