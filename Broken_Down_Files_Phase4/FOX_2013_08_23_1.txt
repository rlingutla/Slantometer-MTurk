OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS A
HIGH LEVEL MEETING
YESTERDAY TO DISCUSS
AMERICA'S OPTIONS.

BUT THERE ARE FEW SIGNS
TONIGHT, JON, THAT THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IS ABOUT
TO PROVIDE THOSE WEAPONS
INSPECTORS WITH SAFE
PASSAGE FOR THE ADMITTEDLY
DANGEROUS 15 MINUTE
JOURNEY.

BRITAIN, TURKEY, AND FRANCE
LEADING THE WAY AND
POINTING FINGERS PRETTY
DIRECTLY AT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND
DEMANDING THAT THOSE U.N.

AMERICA NEEDS TO PAY
ATTENTION TO THOSE REPORTS
OF A MASSIVE AND DEADLY
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN
SYRIA.

JUMPING IN TO STUFF THAT
DOES NOT TURN OUT WELL.

PRESIDENT OBAMA MAKING
CLEAR IS HE IN NO RUSH TO
GET THE U.S. MILITARY
INVOLVED IN SYRIA'S
2-YEAR-OLD CIVIL WAR EVEN
AMID MOUNTING CLAIMS THE
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT AGAIN
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST ITS OWN PEOPLE THE
SITUATION IN SYRIA IS VERY
DIFFICULT.

CLEARLY MANY, MANY HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

JONATHAN THE SYRIAN FORCES
STILL CLAIM THEY DID NOT
CARRY OUT THIS ATTACK.

WEAPONS INSPECTORS WHO HAVE
ALREADY ARRIVED IN DAMASCUS
NOW BE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL TO
THE SITE OF THE ALLEGED
ATTACK.

I LOVE SIERRA AND I MISS
SYRIA.

NOW, WHAT'S NEXT?

THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY
RULED OUT U.S. GROUND
TROOPS IN SARA I CAN'T.

CAN RESULT IN US BEING
DRAWN IN TO VERY EXPENSIVE,
DIFFICULT, COSTLY
INTERVENTIONS THAT ACTUALLY
BREED MORE RESENTMENT IN
THE REGION.

PLUS, A GRIM MILESTONE ON
THE NUMBER OF CHILD
REFUGEES NOW TRYING TO
ESCAPE THAT BLOODY CIVIL
WAR.

HARD TO SAY HOW 1,000 OR
COUPLE HUNDRED DEAD FROM A
CHEMICAL WEAPON WHILE
DEPLORABLE WOULD IMPACT HIS
CALCULUS.

NOW, TO PUT THAT
1 MILLION FIGURE IN
PERSPECTIVE, U.N. OFFICIALS
POINT OUT THAT IT IS AS IF
EVERY SINGLE CHILD HAD BEEN
FORCED TO LEAVE THE CITIES
OF L.A. AND BOSTON
COMBINED JON.

OF COURSE, ALL THIS IS
UNFOLDING AS THE PRESIDENT
WRAPS UP A TWO-DAY BUS TOUR
THROUGH NEW YORK AND
PENNSYLVANIA TO TALK ABOUT
HIS PLANS FOR THE ECONOMY.

ALL I WISH IS THAT SYRIA
COULD BECOME PEACEFUL
AGAIN, THAT'S ALL I WANT
FOR THE TROUBLE TO STOP.

ED HENRY IS TRAVELING WITH
THE PRESIDENT.

ONE WEEK AGO THIS WEEK THAT
HE DREW THAT RED LINE ON
CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SARA I
CAN'TENNED A PROMISED THERE
WOULD BE ENORMOUS
CONSEQUENCES IF SYRIA
CROSSED THAT RED LINE.
