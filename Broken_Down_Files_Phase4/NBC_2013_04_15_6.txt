WE SAW A WOMAN RIGHT OVER HERE,
WITNESSES SAW HER STUMBLING TO
THIS BLOCK WITH SHRAPNEL WOUNDS.

ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT
DID NOT SAY IS HE DID NOT CALL
THIS TERRORISM.

BOSTON POLICE CALLED IN ALL OFF
DUTY OFFICERS TO HELP.

I LOOKED DOWN THE STREET AND YOU
COULD SEE SMOKE COMING.

IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO SEE
TRASH BINS REMOVED, MAILBOXES
REMOVED, EVEN THE MANHOLE COVERS
SCREWED DOWN.

FOR ANY POLICE AGENCY PLANNING
FOR BIG CROWDS MEANS MONTHS OF
NIGHTMARES.

WHEN THE SECOND EXPLOSION
HAPPENED 15 SECONDS LATER PEOPLE
STARTED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS
SOMETHING FISHY, SOMETHING BAD.

IT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM NORMAL
FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE
PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN BIG CITIES
AND ESPECIALLY ON THE EAST
COAST, ARE GOING TO SEE
PRECAUTIONS AT TRAIN STATIONS
AND AIRPORTS AND PERHAPS BIG
OBVIOUS MOVEMENT OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT, THERE IS NO REASON
TO FEAR THAT THIS IS ANY, AT
THIS HOUR, PART OF ANY WIDER
PLAN.

THE STREETS ARE CLOSED RIGHT
NOW.

ANOTHER BREAK AND WE ARE BACK
WITH MORE AFTER THIS.

YOU CAN'T PROTECT ALL OF THE
PEOPLE AT ALL OF THE LARGE
SPORTING EVENTS OR ANY PUBLIC
GATHERING.

WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED ALL DAY FROM THE FBI
DIRECTOR, HOMELAND SECURITY
DIRECTOR, CHIEF TERRORISM
ADVISER.

NBC HAS CONFIRMED SHRAPNEL WAS
PART OF THEEGS -- THESE
EXPLOSIONS.

THE SUBWAYS WERE SHUT DOWN AND
BECAUSE OF THAT, PEOPLE HAD TO
WALK FOR MILES IN SOME CASES TO
THEIR DESTINATION.

AS YOU NOTED, THE SHRAPNEL, THE
IDEA THERE COULD HAVE BEEN BALL
BEARINGS OR SOMETHING ELSE IN
THESE EXPLOSIVES SPECIFICALLY
TRYING TO KILL OR MAIM, NOT JUST
TRYING TO HAVE A SMALL EXPLOSION
AND GET SOME ATTRACTION.

WE WANT TO TALK NOW TO AN
EYEWITNESS, SOMEONE WE SPOKE TO
EARLIER DURING OUR DEVELOPING
LIVE COVERAGE.

BOSTONIANS ARE TOLD TO STAY
INDOORS.

I WAS ABOUT A HALF BLOCK AWAY
FROM THE SCENE.

ONE RUNNER HIT BY SHRAPNEL GOES
DOWN.
