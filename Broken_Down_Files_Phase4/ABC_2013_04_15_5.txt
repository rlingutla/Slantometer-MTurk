I SPOKE WITH SOURCES WHO WERE
WATCHING AND WITNESSES THAT
PARTICULAR VIDEOTAPE.

IN SECONDS THEY WERE THERE.

POLICE ARE REVIEWING SECURITY
PLANS FOR THE LONDON MARATHON ON
SUNDAY.

BE AWARE OF YOUR ENVIRONMENT.

WHAT'S THE LATEST YOU'RE HEARING
ON THE VICTIMS?

JUST A SCARY SCENE.

THIS ATTACK, FAR FROM THE FIRST,
TARGETING INNOCENT CIVILIANS.

I KNOW IT WAS YOUR FIRST
MARATHON RUNNING IN BOSTON AND I
JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN, THAT IT
WAS A HARROWING DAY FOR YOU AND
SO MANY MORE PEOPLE.

THIS DOCTOR SPRANG INTO ACTION
TO HELP THE VICTIMS.

UNFORTUNATELY THESE KINDS OF
SETTINGS, MARATHON, FOOTBALL,
BASEBALL, SOCIAL EVENT, CONCERT.

LOOK AGAIN AT THIS VIDEO.

AND WHEN THOSE BOMBS WENT
OFF, THERE WAS ONE PERSON
STANDING THERE, AN EMERGENCY
ROOM DOCTOR, WHO WAS JUST 20
FEET AWAY FROM ONE OF THE
EXPLOSIONS.

THE PUBLIC MOVED ACROSS THE
STREET TO PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.

AND A RIVETING PICTURE FROM
THIS DAY WHEN WE COME BACK.

THEN I LOOKED TO MY LEFT WHERE I
HAD BEEN AND THERE WERE AT LEAST
SIX BODIES DOWN THERE.

I JUST INTERVIEWED A NURSE HERE
ON THE SCENE WHO SAID SHE
TREATED DOZENS OF PEOPLE,
INCLUDING CHILDREN, MANY PEOPLE
WITH SEVERE TRAUMA, PULMONARY
DISTRESS, YOU NAME IT.

ANY SURVEILLANCE TAPE THAT WOULD
GIVE THEM AN IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE
DONE THIS.

AND WAS THERE CHAOS, WAS THERE
PANIC?

IT WAS LOTS OF THAT DARK SMOKE
THAT GOES ALONG WITH A FIRE.

AND I HEARD THIS BIG EXPLOSION.
