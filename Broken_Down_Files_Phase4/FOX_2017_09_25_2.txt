SHEP, THERE HAS BEEN AN
EXODUS FROM PUERTO RICO SINCE
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.

IT WILL NOT MAKE LANDFALL THEY
TELL US, BUT THEY SAY IT WILL
CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE
UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST.

MY FAMILY, GOD KNOWS I LOVE
THEM.

SO SERVICE, EXTREMELY SPOTTY.

THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD, GAS AND
THE CLEANUP EFFORT THAT COULD BE
MEASURED IN MONTHS.

OF SEVERE DISRUPTION.

OF THE 3.4 MILLION, YOU'LL SEE A
TREMENDOUS EXODUS TO FLORIDA,
NEW YORK STATE, AND LESS THIS
POWER GRID IS RESTORED.

CONCERNS OF THE DAM WOULD BREAK
AND CAUSE MORE FLOODING.

IMAGES TO SHOW YOU IN A
SLIDESHOW THIS AFTERNOON,
CERTAINLY DIFFERENT ISLAND AND
IT WAS A WEEK AGO.

WE WILL GO LIVE AND TALK TO
GERALDO RIVERA, WHO IS THERE,
BECAUSE HE HEADED TO THE ISLAND
TO HELP HIS FAMILY.

THERE IS NO SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING ON AN ISLAND WITH NO
WATER AND NO FUEL THEN THE LINES
AT THE SERVICE STATIONS.

HE IS PUERTO REAGAN HIMSELF AND
HIS LIVE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON.

THE ISLAND GOT RACKED BY
HURRICANE IRMA TWO WEEKS AGO.

ONE LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY,
HURRICANE MARIA SAID BACK TO
UNITED STATES TERRITORY BY
DECADES, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT
ISLAND THAT IT WAS WEEK AGO.

MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
OFFERING TO HELP THIS WOMAN
EVACUATE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT
OPENED THE GATES OF A DAM NEAR
HER HOME.

THIS SITUATION IS AS DIRE AS YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

SPILLED BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR
FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE OF
PUERTO RICO

REPORTS PEOPLE WAITED HOURS IN
SOME AREAS TO GET A LITTLE BIT.

80% OF THE CROPS HAD BEEN
DESTROYED.
