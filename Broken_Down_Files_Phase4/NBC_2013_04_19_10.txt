IT'S OVER.

THIS WILL REMAIN A CONTROVERSIAL
DECISION.

I HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL DAY AS
LONG AS WE KEEP THE BALANCE MORE
GOOD GUYS THAN BAD WE'LL BE ALL
RIGHT.

SUSPECT NUMBER TWO ALIVE.

THOSE WEAPONS ARE THE SAME
ISSUED TO THE ARMED FORCES
OVERSEAS.

NO TELLING.

CAME TO THE HOUSE.

HE'S BEING TAKEN TO MOUNT AUBURN
HOSPITAL IN CAMBRIDGE.

THEY CAN GET ALL OF THAT
INFORMATION FROM HIM BEFORE THEY
ACTUALLY MIRANDAIZE HIM.

HE OR SHE WILL BE WORKING HARD
TO EXTEND A HAND AND ALLOWS THIS
INDIVIDUAL TO COME OUT.

VERY GOOD REASON.

SEVERAL PEOPLE NOTICED A BLACK
VEHICLE WHICH PEOPLE ASSUME TO
BE A HEARSE IN THE FOREGROUND.

IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORK LIKE
THAT.

ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE HAD THERE
NOT BEEN THE VIDEO AND
PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF THE
PERPETRATORS.

HE MAY BE ABLE TO ADD.

I'M WITH RITA WHO LIVES IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

HE'S ALIVE.

ONCE THEY MIRANDAIZE HIM, THEY
WILL GO THROUGH ALL OF THE
THINGS THEY NEED TO KNOW.

WE SEE THE AMBULANCE PULLING IN
RIGHT NOW.

HE'S ALIVE.
