A YEARING ON PRESIDENT OBAMA
SAID CHEMICAL WEAPON USED IN
SYRIA WOULD BE CROSSING A RED
LINE.

WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR
EXPERIENCE.

THE TOP BRASS SUGGESTING THAT
THE U.S. MILITARY IS READY TO
ACT ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE IN
SYRIA.

THE CIVIL WAR AND ESTIMATES PUT
IT AT MORE THAN 100,000.

THIS IS SIX MAJOR AIR FIELDS AND
TAKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE DOWN AND
AMMUNITION AND AIRPLANE THEM AND
CREATOR THE RUN AWAY.

BUT BOLTON BELIEVES THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION WILL TRY TO
INDICT THE SYRIAN REGIME IN THE
INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT.

MOMENTUM IS BUILDING FOR THE
WORLD TO TAKE ACTION IN SYRIA IN
THE WAKE OF NEW ACCUSATIONS OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.
