DRILLING DOWN FURTHER NOW ON HIS
FINANCES, HIS COMPUTER AND HIS
MENTAL HEALTH, DAVID.

MOST POWERFUL GUN LOBBY, TODAY,
A CALL FOR CHANGE IN THE WAKE OF
THE NATION'S DEADLIEST MASS
SHOOTING.

THEIR PURCHASE IN THE WEEKS
BEFORE.

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

RUN!

ACCORDING TO SOURCES BRIEFED ON
THE INVESTIGATION, HE BOOKED
ROOMS AT CHICAGO'S BLACKSTONE
HOTEL IN AUGUST, THE SAME DATES
AS THE LOLLAPALOOZA FESTIVAL
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IN GRANT
PARK.

GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST HERE.

FAR SILENT ON GUN CONTROL IN THE
WAKE OF THE LAS VEGAS MASSACRE,
BUT LATE TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP
SIGNALED HE'LL BE WEIGHING IN ON
THE BUMP STOCK DEBATE, TOO.

EMPLOYEES HERE TODAY TOLD US THE
FBI QUESTIONED THEM ABOUT
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH
PADDOCK AND HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, WHEN THEY CAME
TO BUY THE CAR.

SHOCKINGLY, PEOPLE SEEM UNABLE
TO PROCESS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

I DON'T THINK THE 80 OR
90 MILLION AMERICANS WHO
EXERCISE THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHTS TO OWN A GUN SHOULD BE
PUNISHED FOR THE ACT OF ONE EVIL
PERSON.

BUT NO EVIDENCE HE TRAVELED TO
BOSTON, EITHER.

THE NRA NOW SAYS, "DEVICES
DESIGNED TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC
RIFLES TO FUNCTION LIKE FULLY
AUTOMATIC RIFLES SHOULD BE
SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
REGULATIONS."

THOSE ARE SHOTS!

HIGH ABOVE THE LAS VEGAS STRIP
AT THE GILDED DE.CAFATHF  OE
INSIDE ONE SHATTERED WINDOW,
PILLOWS STACKED HIGH ON A
STRIPPED BED.

I'M BLEEDING SO MUCH.

IN, ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

RIGHT HERE, COME IN HERE.

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

NEARLY 38,000 PEOPLE.
