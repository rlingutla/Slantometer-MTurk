WE ARE BACK TONIGHT.

TWO DAYS LATER A
PAKISTANI-AMERICAN WAS CAUGHT
TRYING TO BOARD A FLIGHT TO THE
MIDDLE EAST.

THOSE STILL ON THE COURSE WERE
DIVERTED AWAY FROM THE FINISH
LINE.

IT WAS LOUD.

YOU REDUCE THE PROBABILITY TO
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING MINUSCULE SO
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS YOUR
RESPONSE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP
CASUALTIES TO A MINIMUM N TIMES
SQUARE 2010.

THE POLICE COMMISSIONER ASKED
EVERYBODY TO STAY INSIDE,
EVERYBODY TO GO HOME IF THEY
CAN.

BUT IT IS NOT THE SIGN OF A
SPECIFIC THREAT NECESSARILY.

THAT ONCE THE SECOND BUILDING
WAS HIT THAT DAY WE KNEW IT WAS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

BUT SECURITY EXPERTS HAVE BEEN
DEALING WITH TERRORIST THREATS
AT BIG GATHERINGS SINCE THE
MUNICH GAMES IN 1972.

PEOPLE SHOULD VIEW THE
PRECAUTIONS IN WASHINGTON, NEW
YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, LOS ANGELES
MERELY AS PRECAUTIONS.

IT'S CELEBRATORY.

YOU COULD LOOK AT ANY DIRECTION
AT ANY MOMENT AT THE
INTERSECTION AND THERE WERE
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE THAT YOU COULD SEE IN ANY
DIRECTION SHUTTING DOWN THE
STREETS.

MOST OF THE SECURITY WOULD BE
FOCUSED ON THE FINISH LINE AREA
WHERE THE ACTUAL BOMBING
A BACKPACK HOLDING PIPE BOMBS
PACKED WITH NAILS EXPLODED IN
OLYMPIC PARK.

HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN GIVING
BRIEFINGS TO THE LEADERSHIP IN
CONGRESS.

SEEN FROM ACROSS THE CHARLES
RIVER.

EVERYONE WAS RELAXED AND HAPPY.

WHILE IT'S FAMILIAR NOW TO US IN
A KIND OF HIDEOUS WAY, IT ALSO
ISN'T.

WHAT CAN YOU TELL US THERE?

A SERIES OF COORDINATED SUICIDE
ATTACKS ON THE SUBWAY AND BUS
SYSTEM LEFT 52 PEOPLE DEAD, 700
INJURED.

SOME PEOPLE WERE VERY, VERY
BADLY HURT.
