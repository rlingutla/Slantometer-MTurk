WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO?

OU HEAD FOOTBALL COACH BOB
STUCKS BROUGHT STACKS OF
$50 GIFT CARDS AND DECIDED
TO COME HERE AND VISIT WITH
THE FAMILIES AT THIS
SHELTER.

TRACY'S DAUGHTER EXCITED
THAT THERE WAS NO MORE
SCHOOL AND TRACY'S
DAUGHTER SAVED BY THE
ACTION SHEP, OF THAT
HEROIC TEACHER'S AIDE WHO
JUST COVERED HER UP AND
SAVED HER FROM ALMOST
CERTAIN DEATH.

WE SHOULD POINT OUT SHEP,
NEITHER BRIAR WOOD NOR
PLAZA TOWERS HAD ANY KIND
OF SAFE ROOM OR HARDENED
TORNADO SHELTER.

THEY ALL ESCAPED UNSCATHED.

THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO
REPAIR.

THE HOME THEY HAD BEEN RENT
SOMETHING NOW LEVELED.

SHE SAYS SHE REMEMBERS
VIVIDLY THOSE HEART BROKEN
SURVIVORS NOW SHE IS ONE OF
THEM.

WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM SOME
OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
TAKING PART IN THE MASSIVE
SEARCH AND RESCUE
OPERATION.

OUR GRATITUDE IS WITH THE
TEACHERS WHO GAVE THEIR ALL
TO SHIELD THEIR CHILDREN
WITH THE NEIGHBORS FIRST
RESPONDERS AND EMERGENCY
PERCH NELL TO HO RACED TO
HELP AS SOON AS THE TORNADO
PASSED.

LISTEN.

INSTEAD, THEY ARE HAVING TO
CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT AND
FRANKLY START FROM SCRATCH.

DOZENS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR
LIVES.

TODAY, WE CAME ACROSS TRACY
STEPHAN IN HER BACKYARD,
WHAT USED TO BE HER
BACKYARD SIFTING THROUGH
THE WRECKAGE OF HER HOME.

TOOK THEM A FEW OF THEM AND
WENT INTO THE CLOSET.

DURING AN EMOTIONAL
INTERVIEW WITH A CBS
STATION HERE, ONE WOMAN
DESCRIBED HOW THE CHAOS OF
THE STORM TORE HER DOG FROM
HER BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENED
NEXT.

YEAH.

CAN YOU CALL THE RED CROSS
AT 1-800-RED-CROSS.

IT JUST LOOKED LIKE BOMBS
HAD BEEN IGNITED
EVERYWHERE.

YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT
MOMENT WHEN YOU FIRST SAW
YOUR DAUGHTER; THE HAPPIEST
DAY OF MY LIFE.
