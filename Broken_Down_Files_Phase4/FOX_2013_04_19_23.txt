WE DON'T KNOW.

YOU HEARD MULTIPLE
SHOTS.

ARSENAL STREET IN
WATERTOWN.

WE KNOW IT TO THIS MOMENT.

IS HE TOTALLY SURROUNDED.

THEY WERE PUSHING US BACK
SEVERAL BLOCKS AND WE
DIDN'T REALIZE HOW CLOSE WE
WERE.

EVERYONE HERE IS LISTENING
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT WAS
EXACTLY.

NOT FAR FROM WHERE WE HAVE
BEEN SITUATED ALL DAY LONG.

SHE WENT OUT AND LOOKED,
THERE WERE BLOODY CLOTHES
INSIDE THE SHED SHE
REPORTED TO POLICE.

YEAH, YOU ARE RIGHT.

HOLY, HOLY HOLY.

NOW THERE IS A ROBOT GOING
IN IT'S OUR STANDING TO
CHECK TO SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY BOMBS THERE.

THERE IS A QUESTION HERE.

TWO YEARS AGO WITH A MAN
WHO DIED OVERNIGHT.

THERE IS NO WARNING THAT
THEY WERE GOING TO TRY
TO -- THERE IS IS NO
WARNING THAT THEY WERE
GOING -- WE KNOW THAT WE
HAVE HEARD ABOUT 10
EXPLOSIONS OUT HERE IN THE
AREA WHERE SUSPECT NUMBER 2
TRAPPED.

THERE IS A VERY FLUID
SITUATION AIR WING OF THE
MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE
IS UP OVER THE SCENE.

IT WAS A LOT.

WE HAVE GOT THE STATE
POLICE AND EVERYONE BACK AT
THE SCENE ON FRANKLIN
STREET IN WATERTOWN WHERE
NOT FAR FROM THE WATERTOWN
MALL.

I'M BACK WITH OUR FRIEND
PAUL SUTHERLAND WHO CAME
HERE ON SCENE AND HE WAS
RIGHT THERE RUNNING RIGHT
AHEAD OF US TOWARD THE
ACTIVITY.

WE NEED TO BE A NORMAL
CITY AGAIN.
