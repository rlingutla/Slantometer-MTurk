HE'S TALKING ABOUT AN
INTERNATIONAL COALITION TO TAKE
OUT AL-ASSAD WITH ALL OF THESE
TERRIBLE OPTIONS.

LOOK AT THE TWEET THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP SENT BACK, BEFORE HE WAS
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT
RUSSIA NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT ITS
SUPPORT FOR BASHAR AL-ASSAD AND
THIS IS ONE WEEK AHEAD OF
SECRETARY OF STATE REX
TILLERSON'S VISIT TO MOSCOW
WHERE HE WILL MEET WITH THE
STATE DEPARTMENT THERE.

OFFICIALS SAY THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK WILL COLOR THOSE
DISCUSSIONS.

WILL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

THE AMERICANS SAY IT HAPPENED
ANOTHER.

HE DIED IN DECEMBER AT AGE 95.

IT'S A MATTER OF HOW MUCH YOU'RE
WILLING TO GIVE.

YOU HAVE THIS TOXIC MIX OF ALL
OF THOSE PEOPLE AND TO REMOVE
THIS MAN FROM POWER, REGIME
CHANGE, SOMETHING AGAINST WHICH
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS RAILED FOR
YEARS.

THE RUSSIANS SAYING ONE THING
AND THE AMERICANS SAYING
ANOTHER.

WE'LL LEARN MORE IN WEEKS TO
THIS FURTHER.

SO I DON'T KNOW -- IT'S
INTERESTING THAT TRUMP SAID
UNTIL YESTERDAY THAT HE DOESN'T
TELEGRAPH WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO
AND HE LIKES TO DO THINGS
SECRETLY.

CREWED AIRLIFTED HER AND SHE'S
EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.

THE IRANIANS ARE IN THE MIX
SUPPORTING HEZBOLLAH.

IS MILITARY ACTION, BOOTS ON THE
GROUND AHEAD FOR THE UNITED
STATES IN SYRIA?

IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO
SEE WHAT THEY'RE CONSIDERING,
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE WILLING
TO PUT GROUND FORCES ON.

SO THE QUESTION IS NOT THAT
THERE'S JUST A RUSSIAN ANGLE
HERE, THE RUSSIAN PART IS
EVERYTHING.

BY THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

THEY THINK THE U.N. SHOULD DO AN
INVESTIGATION.

THE CONGRESS AT SOME POINT,
SHEP, IS GOING TO HAVE TO
WEIGH-IN ON THIS.
