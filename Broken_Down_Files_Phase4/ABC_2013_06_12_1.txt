STRONGLY DEFENDED THE NSA'S
SECRET PROGRAMS AS LEGAL,
NECESSARY AND RESPONSIBLE HE
SAID, FOR STOPPING DOZENS OF
TERRORIST EVENTS IN THE U.S. AND
ABROAD.

OUR SECURITY IS JEOPARDIZED.


NOW WE TURN TO THAT MANHUNT,
THE 29-YEAR-OLD GIVING CHASE TO
THE U.S. SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT.

FALSE.

THAT'S THE $64,000 QUESTION
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE TARGETS
ARE.

IT CLEAR HE IS STILL IN HONG
KONG TELLING THE SOUTH CHINA
POST IT IS HERE THAT HE WANTS TO
MAKE HIS LAST STAND TO REVEAL
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS AND
TARGETS WORLDWIDE.

I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DO THAT.

THE ACCESS THAT HE HAD, THE
PROCESS THAT WE DID.

IF THAT COMES OUT THEN THERE
WILL BE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO
NATIONAL SECURITY.

OTHERS SAID THE 29-YEAR-OLD
SNOWDEN HAD BEEN DISHONEST ABOUT
HIS BACKGROUND AND HIS CLAIMS TO
"THE GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER THAT
U.S. CITIZENS ARE BEING WIRE
TAPPED.

EDWARD SNOWDEN WHO MADE ALL
THOSE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS
PUBLIC EMERGED FOR A SHADOWY
MOMENT BEFORE DISAPPEARING
AGAIN.

THE NSA ACKNOWLEDGED HE WAS
STUNNED THAT A 29-YEAR-OLD
ANALYST WHO DROPPED OUT OF HIGH
SCHOOL IN HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR
COULD HAVE ACCESS TO SO MANY TOP
SECRET DOCUMENTS.

I, SITTING AT MY DESK, HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO WIRE TAP ANYONE
FROM YOU OR YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A
FEDERAL JUDGE TO EVEN THE
PRESIDENT IF I HAD A PERSONAL
E-MAIL.

THE HEAD OF THE NSA, GENERAL
KEITH ALEXANDER, SAID SNOWDEN
ALREADY HURT THE U.S.
 GREAT HARM HAS ALREADY BEEN
DONE BY OPENING THIS UP.

HE EVEN HINTED THERE MAY BE MORE
SECRETS TO COME.

SNOWDEN MAY BE HOLDING A LOT
MORE SECRETS.

HIS LAST POST WAS AT THE NSA,
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
FACILITY IN HAWAII THAT IS A HUB
FOR AMERICAN SPYING AND COMPUTER
HACKING ON CHINA AND NORTH KOREA
AS WELL AS HONG KONG.

IF HE MAKES PUBLIC THE NAMES OF
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OTHERS
WHO ARE TARGETS IT COULD BE FAR
MORE DEVASTATING THAN WHAT HE
HAS DONE SO FAR.

I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS OVER
THAT.
