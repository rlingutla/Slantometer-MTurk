I HATE THIS!

THEY'RE GOING TO BOARD THEIR
HOUSE UP.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
TELLING US WINDS WERE MORE THAN
200 MILES PER HOUR AT THAT
POINT.

NOW HE'S GOING TO TELL US WHY
200-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS CANNOT
SHAKE SOMETHING HE LOVES --
THE SPIRIT OF THE PEOPLE AT
HOME.

THEN THEY WALK OUTSIDE.

JUST PERSISTENT, TENACIOUS
WILL TO SURVIVE AND CALL THIS
HOME.

HER STUDENTS HAD MADE THIS FOR
HER BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING ON
TO MIDDLE SCHOOL.

ONE MORE DISCOVERY I WANTED TO
SHOW YOU FROM INSIDE THAT
SCHOOL.

OH, MY GOD!

IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

ONCE OUTSIDE, THE TEACHER, NOW
WORRIED ABOUT TWO OTHER
STUDENTS.

ONCE FILLED WITH TEACHERS AND
PARENTS' CARS RIGHT THERE ON THE
RIGHT, EMPTY.

JOEY!

OH, MY GOD.

WE'LL SHOW YOU THE MAP WITH THE
NEW SYSTEM SWEEPING IN FROM THE
WEST.

AND THIS IS WHAT THEY HEARD.

WERE HERE TODAY TOURING THE
DAMAGE, AND AGAIN THE QUESTIONS
SURROUNDING THOSE SAFE ROOMS AND
WHY THERE WERE NOT ANY IN EITHER
OF THOSE TWO SCHOOLS.

AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE, AS THAT
TWISTER HOVERED OVER THE SCHOOL,
IT WAS PITCH BLACK, AND
TERRIFYING INSIDE.

BUT OKIES, LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC
SUPERSTAR TOBY KEITH, A MOORE
NATIVE, WHO STILL LIVES HERE,
NOW DEFINE OKIE WITH WORDS LIKE
RESILIENT AND TOUGH.

NOW THE LATEST TONIGHT ON
THE BIG STORY WE'VE BEEN
COVERING THIS WEEK, THE DIRECT
HIT TWISTER OUTBREAK IN
OKLAHOMA.
