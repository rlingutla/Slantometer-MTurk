HAS NOW RETURNED TO A STATE
OF ALERT AS WELL.

HI SARAH AND MARK, AN
AMAZING TURN OF EVENTS
MOMENTS AFTER THE STATE
POLICE MAKE THE
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO RESUME THE SEARCH
IN ANOTHER WAY.

A SITUATION MOMENTS AGO
WE HAD A SERIES OF --
[INAUDIBLE] SUSPECT NUMBER
2 IS HOLD UP.

SWAT TEAM PEOPLE GET OUT
AND THEY ALL DISPERSE RIGHT
OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

BOB, I WANT YOU TO HEAR
THIS AS WELL.

WE HAVE MARY SULLIVAN,
RESIDENT OF WATERTOWN AND
MARY, IT'S MARK ALONG WITH
SARAH UNDERWOOD.

SHOULD SOMEONE SUFFER ANY
TYPE OF WOUNDS OR INJURIES
AT THIS POINT.

IT WAS 15 MINUTES AGO
RIGHT AFTER THE PRESS
CONFERENCE ENDED.

A WOMAN CALLED POLICE IN
WATER TOWN AND SAID THAT
THE COPS HAD EARLIER SWEPT
THIS BOAT ABOUT WHICH THE
LOCAL ANCHORS ARE SPEAKING
BUT NOW SHE SEES THE SHED
DOOR IS OPEN.

I FIGURED IT WAS EITHER A
FLASH BANG OR PIPE BOMB.

LIVE PICTURES OF
FRANKLIN STREET AS WELL
WHERE WE CAN SEE THE STATE
POLICE AND SQUAD TEAM
MEMBERS AND ALSO MEMBERS OF
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
COMMUNITY OF WATERTOWN ARE
THERE AS WELL.

STILL A VERY ACTIVE SCENE.

WE SLOWED DOWN.

IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THE
SUSPECT THERE IN THE BOSTON
MARATHON BOMBING WAS
UNDERNEATH THIS BOAT TARP
AND NOW THERE ARE REPORTS
OF ALL OF THESE EXPLOSIONS
AND THE EXPLOSIONS, THOUGH
THEY ARE BEING REPORTED BY
THE LOCAL REPORTER AS A
SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS, IT'S
POSSIBLE THAT WHEN THEY
SENT THIS ROBOT IN TO DO
THE EXPLORATION OF THE
AREA, TAKE A LOOK AT VIDEOS
AND THE REST, THEY COULD
HAVE SET OFF A FLASH BANG
IN THERE.

SOMEBODY IS BEING SHOT AT
IT AND WE KEPT FOLLOWING
THE.

BUT, AGAIN VERY FLUID
SCENE IN WATER TOWN.

AND THE SUSPECT IS DOWN.

HERE WHERE WE ARE STANDING
IN BOSTON A FEW BLOCKS FROM
WHERE THE ORIGINAL
TERRORIST ATTACK HAPPENED,
POLICE AND SWAT VEHICLES
HAVE BEEN STREAMING TOWARD
WATER TOWN FOR THE LAST TWO
MINUTES.

WE HEARD OFFICERS TALKING
ABOUT WE GOT HIM.

THREE TRUCKS WENT BY AND I
SAID SOMETHING IS GOING ON
TO JANEL.
