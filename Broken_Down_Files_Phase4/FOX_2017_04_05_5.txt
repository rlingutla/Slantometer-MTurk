WHAT HAS CHANGED.

WE HAVE NO WAY TO KNOW WHETHER
THE PRESIDENT WAS SIGNALLING AN
IMMEDIATE MILITARY RESPONSE.

HE TWEETED THIS.

I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU, AS
MUCH AS I RESPECT YOU.

TURN THEM INTO AUTONOMOUS PARTS
OF SYRIA OVER TIME AND HELP THE
REGIONS IF WE EVER GET TO A
PEACEFUL PERIOD TO HELP
RECONSTRUCT THEMSELVES, HE
DOESN'T HAVE TO GIVE ANY MONEY
OR DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT AND HOPE
THAT SOME OTHER PROCESS PUSHES
HIM OUT OF POWER.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING ONE
THING.

ALL OF US HAS BEEN HARDENED BY
THE WARS OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO
THE POINT THAT IT WAS EASIER TO
FRANKLY TURN OFF THE TELEVISION
AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THESE
TRAGEDIES BECAUSE WE BEGAN TO
DOUBT IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THEM ANYWAY.

THIS SORT OF THING HAS BEEN
HAPPENING FOR YEARS.

AND CITIZEN TRUMP URGED OBAMA
NOT TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.

I THINK IT'S GOT TO FEEL
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU'RE SITTING IN
THAT OVAL OFFICE THAN IT WOULD
HAVE EVER FELT AS A CONSUMER OF
THE NECESSARY.

SAYING THAT IT HAS CROSSED A
NUMBER OF LINES, NOT JUST A RED
LINE, AND IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR
THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE SOME
SORT OF ACTION IN THE WAKE OF
ALL OF THIS.

THEY TELEGRAPHED WHAT THEY WOULD
DO IN MOSUL TELLING LEADERS WHAT
THEY WOULD DO TO DIG IN OR GET
OUT.

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE THIS
CRISIS WHEN HE SET THE RED LINE
IN THE SAND.

LIKE SERBIA AND BOSNIA AND
KOSOVO.

AND THE PRESENCE OF KING
ABDULLAH GAVE THIS MORE GRAVITY.

IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WE'RE TO
TAKE HIM LITERALLY AND
SERIOUSLY, SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR
FOREIGN POLICY SHIFT.

THAT ACT ON CHILDREN HAD A
BEEN IMPACT ON ME.

NEWS DECK, A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR
THE UNITED STATES AND A WORLD.

IT'S THE WAY IN WHICH MR. TRUMP
HIMSELF HAS BECOME ENGAGED IN
THE WHOLE PROCESS.

THAT IS WHY THIS IS SUCH A
DEFINING MOMENT FOR HIM.
