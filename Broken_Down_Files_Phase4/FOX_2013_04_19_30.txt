A SOURCE TELLING OUR OWN
HEATHER THAT THE SUSPECT IS
DOWN.

EVERYONE -- EVERYBODY IS
TRYING TO LISTEN IN AND GET
A GRASP FOR WHAT EXACTLY
THOSE SOUNDS WERE.

AT LEAST 20 SHOTS.

SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE
RIGHT NOW AT 728 IN THE
EVENING AS POLICE HAVE THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDED AS
WELL.

THERE IS A STATE POLICE
HOSPITAL OVERHEAD
MONITORING THE SITUATION.

AND IT'S OUR STANDING THAT
THEY SEARCHED THE AREA.

SOME 20 SHOTS FIRED IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD IN WATER TOWN
AS ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS
SAID ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT
WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
INUNDATED WITH POLICE AND
THESE SHELTERED TRUCKS.

A WOMEN WITH HER CHILDREN
AND THE PANIC ON THEIR
FACES AFTER LISTENING TO
WHETHER IT WAS 20 OR 30
SHOTS FIRED YOU CAN'T
IMAGINE WHAT THESE PEOPLE
IN WATERTOWN.

NOW, POLIC
A ROBOT TO MAKE SURE THAT
THERE ARE NOLOSIVE
DEVICES THERE.

HE BELIEVES THEY MAY HAVE
BEEN FLASH BANKS.

AMBULANCE BEING BACKED UP
RIGHT HERE.

SCENE HERE AND STAND BY ON

REACTING TO THIS.
