MY HEART STARTED TO PALPITATE
HERE AND I'M STILL PALPITATING.

AND THEN I WOULD SAY A GOOD 45
MINUTES, HOUR LATER, THERE WAS
MORE GUN FIRE AND WHAT SOUNDED
LIKE THREE SMALL EXPLOSIONS, I
MEAN, WE'RE ABOUT FOUR HOUSES
AWAY, THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED
LIKE TO ME.

I THINK I'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER
ONCE WE KNOW, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
OVER.

BUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS, AFTER
THEY LIFTED THE BAN, MY
NEIGHBORHOOD, DAVID
NEIGHBOR, HE WENT OUTSIDE TO GET
SOME FRESH AIR AND HE HAD HIS
24-FOOT BOAT ON A TRAILER WITH A
WINTER COVER, A SHRINK WRAP
COVER OVER IT.

THEY APPARENTLY WERE STANDING
THERE, HE WAS FIRING ON THEM AND
THEY SOME HOW COULD TIP THE BOAT
TO TRY TO DISABLE AT LEAST HIS
ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN FIRING AT
THEM?

YOU SAID THERE WAS GUN FIRE,
THEN SOMETHING SOUNDED EXPLOSIVE
AND THEN GUN FIRE AGAIN?

AND, YOU KNOW, AND I HAD EVEN
SAID EARLIER TODAY, NOT ABOUT
THAT BOAT, BUT WE LIVE RIGHT
NEAR THE CHARLES RIVER AND THERE
IS A YACHT CLUB THAT HAS ALL THE
BOATS SHRINK WRAPPED AND I SAID,
THINKING OUT LOUD THIS MORNING,
I SAID, DO YOU THINK THEY'VE
GONE THROUGH ALL THOSE BOATS?

THERE ARE ABOUT TEN INDIVIDUALS
THAT CAME ALL IN THEIR DARK
UNIFORMS HERE WITH RIFLES, ET
CETERA.

WHICH WOULD INDICATE AND WE
HAD NOT HEARD THIS BEFORE, THAT
HE MIGHT HAVE STILL BEEN ALIVE
WHEN THEY CAME UP.

ALL RIGHT, I WANT TO GO BACK
TO BRIAN ROSS, BECAUSE, BRIAN,
ON THE SCENE, DO THEY NOW
BELIEVE, AND I KNOW YOU DO NOT
KNOW HIS CONDITION YET, COULD BE
A SPECTRUM OF THINGS, BUT HAS
ANYBODY SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT
THEY BELIEVE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO
GET SOME INFORMATION FROM HIM
ABOUT HOW MANY INVOLVED, WHAT
ELSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLANNED?

WE OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE THIS
CLARIFIED AS TIME GOES ON.

CAN SEE THAT AMBULANCE GOING
DOWN THE STREET, WE BELIEVE THAT
THE SUSPECT WAS INSIDE THAT
AMBULANCE.

TEAM, THE
BOSTON POLICE, THE WATERTOWN
POLICE, THEY'VE ALL BEEN IN MY
HOUSE HERE INTERVIEWING HIM AND
HE'S JUST TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT.

AND THAT ALMOST MAKES YOU THINK
THAT THEY WERE PLANNING
SOMETHING ELSE, THIS THEY WERE
JUST GOING TO GO BACK TO THEIR
REGULAR LIFE.

IT COULD MEAN HOSPITAL, IT
COULD MEAN --
THEY SENT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL,
MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO THE SCENE,
WHICH WOULD BE TYPICAL IN A
SITUATION LIKE THIS, NOT ONLY
FOR THE SUSPECT, BUT ALSO FOR
POTENTIAL INJURIES TO POLICE, AS
WELL.

YES, WE'VE BEEN IN ALL DAY
AND THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN -- WE'RE LIFTING THE BAN,
BUT WE SUGGEST YOU DON'T GO TOO
FAR AND HE JUST WENT OUT TO HIS
YARD AND RIGHT IN HIS YARD,
RIGHT OUTSIDE HIS BACK DOOR IS
HIS BOAT AND LIKE I SAID, I TOLD
YOU THE REST OF THE STORY.

BUT LET ME GO THROUGH THAT
AGAIN.

THE SUSPECT.

HE NOTICED SOMETHING WAS OFF.

WELL, AGAIN, SUCH VIVID
DETAIL THAT YOU ARE ALL GIVING
US FROM PHONING IN AND WE THANK
YOU.
