THAT'S WHY NOBODY KNOWS YOU
ARE.

ALL OF THAT BEING PULLED
OUT OF THE BOMBING VICTIMS
TO BE ANOTHER EMOTIONAL
DAY.

WE ARE WATCHING ALL THE
DEVELOPMENTS TONIGHT IN A
STRANGE TWIST AGAIN ONLY
MOMENTS AGO THE BOSTON
POLICE DEPARTMENT SENT OUT
A MESSAGE THAT THE FBI
WOULD PUT A STATEMENT OUT
AT 800 AND THEN QUICKLY
RETRACTED THAT.

WE ARE NOW HEARING THE FBI
WILL BE HOLDING A LONG
AWAITED BRIEFING IN 30
MINUTES.

AND NOW WE'RE LEARNING THE
FEDS ARE LOOKING FOR TWO
MEN SEEN IN PHOTOS NEAR THE
BOMB SITE.

MOST OF THEM MEN AT THE
MARATHON WHO CARRIED BLACK
BACKPACKS OR OTHERWISE
LOOKED SUSPICIOUS.

CONTRARY TO SOME EARLY
REPORTING THOUGH, TYLER
DODD SAYS HE NEVER SERVED
IN THE MILITARY BUT HE
ADDED THAT VICTORIA'S
STRENGTH PROVED TO BE
INSPIRING.

WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING.

THERE IS NO, AS FAR AS I
KNOW ANY MAGIC BULLETS TO
PREVENT THIS.

AS SHE LAID LEADING AFTER
THE BLAST AND TONIGHT TYLER
HAS BEEN FOUND.

WELL, THE PRESIDENT WILL
COME HERE TO THE CATHEDRAL
OF THE HOLY CROSS JUST
ABOUT 1100.

AS I MENTIONED, IF IT
HAPPENS TONIGHT YOU WILL
SEE IT HERE ON THE FOX NEWS
CHANNEL.

IN THE 1970S AND 1980S, IT
WAS A COMMON TACTIC USED BY
THE IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY
IN THE UK AND ALSO IT WAS
USED IN THE 1980S BY
COLOMBIAN REBELS.

WE ARE LIVE ON BOYLESTON
STREET IN BOSTON'S BACK
BAY.

AND YOU CAN SEE WORKERS
PUSHING CRIBS DOWN THE
STREET, POSSIBLY FROM THE
DAY CARE CENTER INSIDE THAT
COURTHOUSE IN BOSTON.

THIS IS AN ACTIVE
INVESTIGATION THAT IS
ONGOING TONIGHT.

LIVE IN THE NATION'S
CAPITOL FOR A LOOK AT WHAT
LAWMAKERS DID AND WE'LL GET
SOME REACTION FROM
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

THE FBI LATER SAYING THERE
WERE NO ARREST AND HAS NOT
BEEN ONE.

THERE WILL BE NO STATEMENT
TONIGHT BUT THE NEWS
â™ª
NEWS ON TWO SIGNIFICANT
STORIES TONIGHT.

QUICKLY RICK, WE HAVE
ALSO LEARNED EARLIER TODNVESTIGATORS
FOUND
MORE POSSIBLE PARTS FROM
THE BOMB.
