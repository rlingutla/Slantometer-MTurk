HERE IS A PICTURE RIGHT
HERE WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE.

AS THEY CONTINUE THEIR
RESCUE WORK WE DO HAVE A
REPORT FROM THE LOCAL CBS
STATION AND A TRAGIC ONE IT
IS FROM KFOR, A FAN AS IT
IT PARTICULAR NEWS
OPERATION THEY RUN THERE.

SO, A WOMAN AN INFANT
CHILD, A MAN ALREADY
RECOVERED.

SO ANYBODY WHO THINKS THIS
IS OVER IS SADLY MISTAKEN.

FIRST RESPONDERS FROM ALL
OVER FLOODING IN HERE.

REMEMBER JOPLIN, MISSOURI
AND THE WIPING OUT OF A
LARGE PART OF THAT TOWN.

EVERYTHING THAT CAN I SEE
IS GONE.
