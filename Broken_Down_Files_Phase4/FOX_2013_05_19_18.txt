IT IS WEIRD.

THAT IS THE WEIRD THING ABOUT
THIS AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE VIDEO HE OF THE BLUE SKY
THERE OUT TO THE DISTANCE IN
OKLAHOMA CITY.

WHEN YOU SEE THIS, IT RARELY
HITS THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE
TALL BUILDINGS AND SO MANY
STRUCTURES.

BUT ALSO EVERY NOW AND THEN AS
I PUT MY EYES TO THE IS CENTER
OF THE SCREEN NOW YOU WILL SEE
A FUNNEL CLOUD COME OUT OF THE
SKY.

NORTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA CITY AND
THEN SOUTHEAST OF OKLAHOMA
CITY.

IT IS JUST WEST OF BETHEL ACRES
AND IT IS JUST A COUPLE OF
MILES SOUTH OF THE INTERSTATE.

THIS GUY IS A TRAINED STORM
SPOTTER IS WHAT I'M HEAR FT.
WORTH AFFILIATE THERE.

YOU COULD SEE HE IT COMING AND
THAT WAS HELPFUL YES.

TORNADOHUNTER .COM I UNDERSTAND
HAS SENT THIS TO US.

BACK TO YOU.

THE HAIL CAME AT SUCH A
VELOCITY, RIPPED HOLES THROUGH
THE HOUSES AND TORE UP SIDING
AND BROKEN WINDOWS AND THINGS
OF THAT NATURE.

EVEN THOUGH FORECASTERS WERE
PREDICTING THIS, THESE DROP
DOWN OUT OF THE SKY.

MICHELLE AFTER YOU GET THE
TRACK UP THERE LET ME KNOW.

THERE IS SHAWNEE.

TUNE IN AND JUST LISTEN RIGHT
NOW.

I WISH I COULD SAY THAT THEY
WERE.

WE SAID THIS ON FOX REPORT LAST
NIGHT.

WE ARE ARE PUTING THAT UP NOW.

METEOROLOGIST JANICE DEAN IS IN
THE FOX EXTREME WEATHER CENTER
WHERE IT IS EXTREME RIGHT NOW
JANICE.

YOU KNOW, WE DID HAVE SOME
ELECTRICAL LINES BLOWN DOWN
BECAUSE OF THE WIND BUT FOR THE
MOST PART EVERYONE WAS
FOREWARNED.
