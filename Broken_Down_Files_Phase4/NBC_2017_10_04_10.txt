WHETHER WE LIKE IT
OR NOT, OUR LIVES ARE
INTERTWINED FOREVER.

STILL AHEAD
TONIGHT, HOTELS ON
HIGH ALERT.

WE'RE NOT GOING TO
TALK ABOUT THAT TODAY.

WASHINGTON THEY ARE
TALKING.

I WAS GOING TO DIE.

BUCHANAN'S TEAM
SCRAMBLED TO PUT ON
KEVLAR.

HE NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TO ME OR TOOK
ANY ACTION THAT I WAS
AWARE OF THAT I
UNDERSTOOD IN ANY WAY
TO BE A WARNING THAT
SOMETHING HORRIBLE
LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

MAJOR NEW SECURITY
MEASURES DEPLOYED IN
LAS VEGAS, THREE DAYS
AFTER SUNDAY'S MASS
SHOOTING FROM A HOTEL
ROOM WINDOW.

HE SAW HER AND
REACTED.

INCREDIBLY THE BULLET
HAD PASSED THROUGH HER
WITHOUT HITTING ANY
VITAL ORGANS.

WE'RE DOING BAG
CHECKS.

HOTELS AND CITIES CAN
DO MORE.

TRAGEDY HIT, THE PLACE
KNOWN AS SIN CITY HAD
NO SHORTAGE OF ANGELS.

AS THE WHITE HOUSE
DEALS WITH THAT
FALLOUT IN CONGRESS,
THERE ARE GROWING
CALLS FOR A BAN ON
BUMP STOCKS, THE
DEVICES THE LAS VEGAS
GUNMAN USED TO TURN
HIS SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS ESSENTIALLY
INTO AUTOMATIC MACHINE
GUNS.
