JR. TO THE ENACT THAT THEY
COULD GET AN ABSOLUTE AFTER
LANCASTER OF -- AFTER    --
AVALANCHE.

ONE IN A BLACK HAT, THE
GENTLEMAN IN THE BLACK HAT
AND A WHITE COLLARLESS
SHIRT.

RICK, I WANT TO MENTION
THIS TO YOU.

SUBJECT NUMBER 2 WITH A
WHITE HAT WORN BACKWARDS
ALSO WEARING A DARK JACKET
AND JEANS.

WE NOW KNOW FROM THE FEDS
HERE IN BOSTON THAT THAT
WAS A BACKPACK PLACED AT
THE SITE OF ONE OF THOSE
EXPLOSIONS.

IT ALMOST CERTAINLY MEANS
ACCORDING TO LAW
ENFORCEMENT EXPERTS I HAVE
SPOKEN TO TONIGHT THAT
THESE TWO WERE NOT
PREVIOUSLY ON ANYONE'S
RADAR AS POTENTIAL
TERRORISTS.

THAT TEAM PAID TRIBUTE TO
THE VICTIMS, THE FIRST
RESPONDERS AND ALL THOSE
AFFECTED.

WE KNOW THESE KIND OF
THINGS OCCUR.

EVIDENCE BECAUSE IN
PARTICULAR THEY MAY BE AGE
TO IDENTIFY THE LABORATORY
UNDERWRITER ON ONE OR MORE
OF THE PRESSURE COOKERS
THAT COULD LEAD TO WHERE IT   THE
PEOPLE WHO
PURCHASED IT.

THEY ARE K. NOT ONLY
ALLEGEDLY IDENTIFY THE
IN THE COURSE OF A TRIAL
THEY PROVIDE THE SEQUENCE
OF CONVENIENCE LEADING UP
TO THE EXPLOSION.

WE HAD A SINGLE PERSON OF
INTEREST AND WE WERE
WORKING TO CONFIRM WHETHER
OR NOT THIS PERSON WAS
WORKING BY HIMSELF OR WITH
SOMEONE ELSE.

WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE THAT
WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN?

EXCELLENT POINTS TERRY.

RICK, I THINK IT SAYS AN
AWFUL LOT THAT THE FBI IS
RELEASING THESE IMAGES NOW.

THEY ARE.

BUT I THINK RICK WOULD
AGREE WITH ME THAT OUR
EXPERIENCE WOULD TELL YOU
THAT THINGS WERE MOVING AT
A VERY FAST PACE AND IT WAS
EXTREMELY FLUID.

BECAUSE THERE IS MORE TO
TALK ABOUT TOO ON THE
FORENSIC SIDE OF THIS AND
ALSO WHERE THIS
INVESTIGATION GOES.

THE FBI HAS NAMED THEM
SUSPECT ONE AND SUSPECT 2
SUSPECT 1 WEARING A DARK
HAT, SUSPECT 2 A WHITE HAT.

WITH THE FBI CALLING FOR
THE PUBLIC'S HELPY THE U.S.

FOLLOWING ON WHAT WE HAD
REPORTED EARLIER THAT
FEDERAL SOURCE HAD
INDICATED THEY HAD A CLEAR
IMAGE OF SOMEONE PLACING A
DEVICE AT THE SCENE WHERE
ONE OF THE EXPLOSIONS TOOK
PLACE.
