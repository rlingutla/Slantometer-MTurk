NO FURTHER MOVEMENT AT THIS
TIME.

I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE
COUNTER TERRORISM COMMUNITY IS
AWARE .

HE IS STILL UNCONSCIOUS AND IN
SERIOUS CONDITION.

BUT WAS IT THE INTENT OF THE
LAW TO STOP AN IMMINENT THREAT
AGAINST THE PEOPLE.

OTHER PHOTOS FROM A
MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE SHOW
THE BOAT DURING THE STAND-OFF.

THERE IS SO MANY PLOTS IN THE
LAST 10 OR 11 YEARS.

IT WOULD SEEM THERE A NUMBER
MUCH IED'S BUILT .

THE SECOND INJURY COULD HAVE
COME FROM THERE AND THEY
HAVEN'T TOLD US IT IS FROM
THERE BUT THE MORE RECENT ONE
IS FROM LAST NIGHT.

HIS HEAD TO THE LEFT OF THE
BOAT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT
THE BOAT FROM THE DRIVEWAY.

EXPLOSIVES REQUIRE A
SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED
TRAINING, SHEPHERD.

IT LASTED MORE THAN AN HOUR.

WE GRABBED OUR PHONES AND
CAM RAS AND STARTED RECORDINGS
AND WITHIN A COUPLE OF SECOND
AND THEY OPENED UP FIRE AND
MASSIVE ARTILLERY AND IT SO
LOUD.

WE HAVE.

WE HAVE TRIED 500 CASES IN THE
FEDERAL COURT AND ONLY A
HANDFUL OF MILITARY CASE .

YEAH.

STATE POLICE IS PUTTING THE
STANDARD RIM ON THE FRONT OF
THE ARMOR AND MAKE THEIR WAY
IN THE BACK YARD AND TRY TO
RIP THE TOP OFF OF THE TOP OF
THE BOAT.

WELL, BECAUSE OF THAT, I
WONDER WHAT KIND OF SHAPE YOU
THOUGHT HE WAS IN?

WE HAVE AN IMAGE THAT SHOWS THE
SUSPECT AT THE BOAT WHERE POLICE
CAPTURED HIM AFTER YESTERDAY'S
INTENSE GUNFIGHT.

RED SOX ANTHEM BEING SUN IN
YANKEES STADIUM ON ENEMY
GROUND.

THAT IS FIRST ON FOX THIS
SATURDAY NIGHT.
