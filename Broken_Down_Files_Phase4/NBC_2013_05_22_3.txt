THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN ANY OF OUR
MINDS THAT THE BUILDING WAS GONE
ON THE OUTSIDE.

INCLUDES A 4-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER
WHO BETHANY CALLS HER
INSPIRATION.

CLOSET WHEN HIS HOUSE FELL IN
AROUND HIM.

SWEPT AWAY AS HE HUDDLED IN A
BATHROOM WITH HIS WIFE.

FINALLY TONIGHT I HAVE HERE
WITH ME ON THE DESK A BRICK FROM
JOPLIN HIGH SCHOOL.

162 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

I COULD HEAR THE VOICES
SAYING, MAKE A NOISE, KEEP
MAKING NOISE BECAUSE THEY COULD
NOT FIND ME.

LAST DAY OF SCHOOL IN MOORE.

YOU HELP YOUR FRIENDS AND
FAMILY.

I GET TO SAY THANK YOU FOR --
LETTING ME HAVE THIS LIFE.

HE AND HIS WIFE CHOSE THIS
CLOSET.

IT'S A QUESTION MIKE SOTO HAS
WRESTLED WITH SINCE HE WAS
PULLED FROM UNDER HIS HOUSE ON
MONDAY.

OTHERS DIDN'T.

I SAT THERE -- WE SAT THERE FOR
A BIT.

I KNOW THAT WIND IS A LOT OUT TO
THERE BUT IT'S GOING TO CALM
DOWN FOR US.

BACK STRONGER.

EVEN THROUGH THE CLOSED DOOR
YOU COULD HEAR THE
DISINTEGRATION OF WHAT WE ARE
STANDING IN NOW.

TO ME THAT WAS THE ONLY
OPTION.

IMAGINE THAT.

FINALLY THEY FOUND ME.
