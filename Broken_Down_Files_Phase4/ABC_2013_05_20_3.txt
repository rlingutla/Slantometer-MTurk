BUT IT HASN'T BEEN YET.

WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT
THOSE CHILDREN IN THE TWO
SCHOOLS, WHO WERE INSIDE.

AND THE THIRD DAY SEEMED TO HAVE
DROPPED THE WORST TORNADO OF
THEM ALL.

WE WERE PULLING WALLS OFF OF
PEOPLE.

YEAH, SHE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THE
ROADS ARE STILL IMPASSABLE IN
THAT AREA, SO IT'S TAKING A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO
GET OUT OF THE AREA AND TO OUR
HOSPITAL.

IN SOME PARTS, EVERYTHING
LEVELED.

I WANT TO TURN TO ABC'S SAM
CHAMPION 26 MILES AWAY FROM LAKE
THUNDERBIRD, OKLAHOMA.

BUT THE GYM, TORN APART.

THEY GOT DOWN.

THE AMBULANCES ARE SHOWING UP,
INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PATIENT AT A
TIME, THEY'RE BRINGING THREE AND
FOUR PATIENTS AT A TIME.

UNBELIEVABLE DESTRUCTION.

OUR EXTREME WEATHER TEAM RIGHT
THERE IN THE HEART OF TORNADO
ALLEY, WITH THE VERY LATEST ON
"WORLD NEWS."

NATIONAL GUARD DESCENDING AND
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAMS RACING
INTO TOWN.

THIS IS THE THIRD DAY THAT
VIOLENT STORMS HAVE BEEN IN THIS
AREA.

SHE GOT HER ARM INJURED.

IT WAS JUST DEBRIS.

IT IS MIND-BLOWING.

MOMENTS AGO I SPOKE TO A
HOSPITAL 12 MILES FROM MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, WHERE THE INJURED ARE
BEING CARED FOR RIGHT NOW.

AND THEY GOT UNDER THERE AND
SOME OF THE BLOCKS COLLAPSED ON
THEM.
