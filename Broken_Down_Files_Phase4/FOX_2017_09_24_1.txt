MY HUSBAND GOES OUT AT FOUR IN
THE MORNING EVERY DAY TO GET
GASOLINE FOR THE GENERATOR.

NO DATE OR TIME HAS BEEN
SCHEDULED FOR THAT VISIT.

SOME OF THE BEST NEWS I CAN
REPORT IS THAT COMMUNICATIONS
ARE SLOWLY RETURNING IN SAN
ONE.

OFFICIALS SAY THAT DAM COULD
STILL BREAK AT ANY MOMENT.

THEY ARE TRYING TO REESTABLISH
COMMUNICATION THERE.

PLUS, ANOTHER NATURAL DISASTER
ESTATES PUERTO RICO.

THIS LAST HOUR WE STARTED
GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF SIGNAL
ON OUR CELL PHONE WHICH HAD
PREVIOUSLY BEEN NONEXISTENT.

WE ARE TRYING TO LEAVE.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID HE
PLANS TO VISIT THE ISLAND.

NOW A THREAT OF A DAM COLLAPSE
IS FORCING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
FROM THEIR HOME.

FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, AFTER
LOSING THEIR HOME, THE LONG
LINES FOR FUEL, FOOD AND
WATER, ALONG WITH THE PROSPECT
OF GOING MONTHS WITHOUT POWER
IS JUST TOO MUCH AND HUNDREDS
OF THEM ARE NOW TRYING TO FIND
A WAY.

OFFICIALS ACROSS THE TERRITORY
ARE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS
JUST WHAT HOW WIDESPREAD THE
DAMAGES AND HOW BAD IT IS IN
SOME AREAS, PARTICULARLY THOSE
SMALL TOWNS ALONG THE WESTERN
AND SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PARTS
OF THE TERRITORY WHERE THE
STORM REALLY DAMAGED
SEVERELY.

THIS WEEKEND PUERTO RICO
CONGRESSWOMAN SAID FEMA
ADMINISTRATOR AS WELL AS
FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO
WILL BE MAKING THEIR WAY TO
THE ISLAND TOMORROW TO SURVEY
THE DAMAGE FOR THEMSELVES.

THAT DISCONNECT, NOT BEING
ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOUR LOVED
ONES AND LET THEM KNOW HOW
YOU'RE DOING.

THAT NUMBER COULD STILL RISE
AS THE INDICATIONS ARE
REESTABLISHED.

TODAY THE GOVERNOR SAID THE
DEATH TOLL REMAINED AT TEN.

THEY HAVE SLOWLY STARTED TO
COME INTO THE COUNTRY.

WE CAN SURVIVE THAT WE HAVE A
LITTLE GIRL AND IT'S
COMPLICATED.

THIS IS CRAZY.

ATT DISPATCHED SOME OF THE
CREWS TO REBUILD AND REPAIR
THE CELL TOWERS HERE IN PUERTO
RICO.
