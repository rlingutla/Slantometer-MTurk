WELL, BECAUSE CYBER IS A
STRANGE THING.

AND NOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF
THIS HACKING ATTACK SAID TO BE
$4 BILLION.

WE DID HEAR TODAY BEIJING
OFFICIALS SAYING LISTEN, THIS
HAS TO END HINTING THAT NORTH
KOREA HAS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IT.

WE TALK NORTH KOREA AND THEIR
NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS, THE
MISSILE CAPABILITIES.

WE THINK THE NORTH KOREANS WERE
INVOLVED IN THE BANGLADESH
SENTRA BANK ATTACK AND ANOTHER
POLAND BANK ATTACK.

AGAIN, THE INVESTIGATION NOT
COMPLETELY SURE THAT NORTH KOREA
IS INVOLVED.

THAT'S WHY EUROPOL AND OTHER
INVESTIGATIVE BODIES ARE WORKING
HARD AS WELL AS THE BLAME GAME.

GREG PALKOT HAS MORE.

BUT THE DISRUPTION IS MAXIMUM.

YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SONY
PICTURES DEBACLE.

WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS
ATTRIBUTION.

RESEARCHERS SAY THE DISCOVERY
DOES NOT CONFIRM NORTH KOREA'S
CYBER ATTACK.

CYBER CRIMINALS SAY THEY STOLE A
COPY OF THE BLOCKBUSTER BEFORE
ITS RELEASE AND DEMANDING DISNEY
PAY UP OR ELSE.

THIS COMES DAYS AFTER NORTH
KOREA TESTED A MISSILE.

BRITAIN'S HOSPITAL NETWORK AND
GERMANY'S RAILWAY HIT.

THIS IS NOT THE END OF THIS.

WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS?T'S I
KOREA IS THE CULPRIT, THIS IS A
COUNTRY RUN BY A CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISE THAT ALSO HAS AN
ARMY.

THE ATTACK AFFECTED A LIMIT
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES.

THEY FOUND WAYS TO COUNTER ACT
THAT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD THE
INTERNET FOR SEVERAL DECADES
NOW, WE DON'T THINK OF IT IN WAR
CONCEPT.
