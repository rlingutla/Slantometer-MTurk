MANY HERE HAVE EITHER SERVED
OR HAVE LOVED ONES SERVING
OVERSEAS.

BRUSHING ASIDE ASSAD'S DENIAL,
THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL IS TO
PUNISH HIM AND STOP HIM FROM
ORDERING ANOTHER CHEMICAL
ATTACK.

OFFICIALS HAVE DELAYED THE
ANTICIPATED RELEASE FOR A DAY OR
SO, TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO
MISTAKES.

NOT WAITING FOR A REPORT FROM
THE U.N. CHEMICAL WEAPONS TEAM
THAT FINALLY GOT TO THE ATTACK
SITE MONDAY.

HIS FATHER WAS KILLED.

AND A NEW HORROR NEAR ALEPPO,
THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS
PHOSPHOROUS BOMBS AND NAPALM
DROPPED ON CIVILIANS MONDAY,
KILLING AT LEAST TEN, WOUNDING
DOZENS.

THERE'S NO DOUBT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.

THIS INFANT APPARENTLY BARELY A
MONTH OLD.

MOST TOO HORRIFYING TO SHOW ON
TELEVISION.

BUT OPPOSITION LEADER GENERAL
LEE JUST TOLD RICHARD ENGEL THEY
WILL SEIZE THE CHANCE TO TRY TO
DEFEAT ASSAD.

SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

HEAT WAVE BEATS DOWN, FOLKS HEAD
FOR THE MIDWAY, THE COTTON
CANDY, CORN DOGS, CORN ON THE
COB, ICE CREAM, EVEN PICKLES ON
A STICK.

THEY'RE TORN ABOUT WHAT AMERICA
SHOULD DO.

SYRIA'S ALLIES, IRAN OR
HEZBOLLAH RETALIATE AGAINST
ISRAEL?

HE IS 10 YEARS OLD, BORN IN
SYRIA WITH A CONDITION THAT
CAUSES HIS MUSCLES TO ATROPHY.

A REPORT THAT HAS NOT BEEN
INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED.

INTELLIGENCE IS UPDATING TARGETS
TO TEACH ASSAD A LESSON.

THE BOY'S MOTHER.

EMERGING ONLY TODAY.

THIS FAST MOVING CHAIN OF EVENTS
ALL TOUCHED OFF BY THOSE
HORRIFIC IMAGES OF DEAD AND
DYING CIVILIANS THAT SHOCKED THE
WORLD.
