ON THE INCREDIBLE WORK DOCTORS
AND NURSES ARE DOING IN THIS
CITY.

DISTURBINGLY, A LAW ENFORCEMENT
SOURCE TELLS ABC NEWS, A CAMERA
WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ROOM,
SUGGESTING THE GUNMAN MAY HAVE
RECORDED HIMSELF.

OTHERS IN CRITICAL CONDITION.

AND TONIGHT, THE STAGGERING NEW
TOLL.

THIS IS DEFINITELY THE PLACE
WHERE THEY WERE FIRING INTO THE
CROWD.

WE ARE AT THE END OF THE HALL.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO!

HE DIED WHILE PROTECTING HIS
WIFE, HEATHER, AS BULLETS RAINED
DOWN ON THEM.

WE NEED BLOOD, SO, IF ANYBODY
CAN CONTRIBUTE BLOOD.

TEAMS
ARE CLOSING IN ON THE SHOOTER.

RIGHT NOW, WE NEED YOUR
TRUCK.

RAPID FIRE SHOOTING STARTS
AGAIN.

WE ARE GOING TO BE PEEKING OUT
INTO THE HALLWAY.

IT IS INCREDIBLE.

MORE THAN 500 INJURED.

AND THE FACES OF THE VICTIMS
BEGINNING TO EMERGE.

LISTEN.

ONE WAS CRITICAL, BUT HE IS
STABLE, AND ONE OF MY OFFICERS
WAS OFF-DUTY, ATTENDING THE
CONCERT AND LOST HIS LIFE.

THOSE BULLETS HAD TO TRAVEL WELL
OVER 300 YARDS TO HIT THEIR
VICTIMS AT THE CONCERT.

HUNDREDS MORE WITHIN THE
FOLLOWING MINUTES.
