BUT BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY
BORIS JOHNSON CANCELLED HIS
PLANNED TRIP, AT THE U.S.'
REQUEST.

THE CRITICAL TEST FOR THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.

THAT WARNING COMES EVEN AS U.S.
OFFICIALS WORK OUT EXACTLY WHAT
THE ADMINISTRATION HOPES TO
ACCOMPLISH IN SYRIA.

SHOWDOWN WITH RUSSIA.

IF WE HAVE A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA,
BELIEVE ME, THAT'S A GOOD THING,
IN SYRIA HAVE PUSHED THE TWO
NATIONS EVEN FARTHER APART.

RUSSIA FURIOUS WITH THE U.S.
STRIKE ON SYRIA.

IT'S WORTH NOTING, THE KREMLIN
HAS CLEAR GOALS WHEN IT COMES TO
SYRIA.

THAT PROMPTED THIS WITHERING
POST ON THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY'S FACEBOOK PAGE.

ADDING, "RUSSIA AND IRAN WILL
NOT ALLOW THE UNITED STATES TO
BE THE ONLY SUPERPOWER IN THE
WORLD."

INFURIATING RUSSIA AS THE
SECRETARY OF STATE PREPARES TO
TRAVEL THERE.

THIS WEEK, SECRETARY OF STATE
REX TILLERSON HEADS TO MOSCOW
HOPING TO MEND FENCES.

DAVID, THERE HAS BEEN TOUGH TALK
ON BOTH SIDES.

THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT SO CLEAR ON
THE ISSUE.

THE TENSION RISING.

OUR DECISIONS WILL BE GUIDED
BY OUR VALUES AND OUR GOALS AND
WE WILL REJECT THE PATH OF
INFLEXIBLE IDEOLOGY THAT TOO
OFTEN LEADS TO UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES.

UNDER AN UNFLATTERING PICTURE OF
JOHNSON, THE RUSSIANS ACCUSE
BRITAIN OF "FUNDAMENTAL
INCOMPREHENSION OR IGNORANCE OF
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SYRIA, OF
RUSSIA'S EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THAT
CRISIS, AND OF THE POINT OF
DIPLOMACY IN GENERAL."

MUCH MORE MEASURED WITH THEIR
WORDS.

THEY WANT ASSAD TO REMAIN IN
POWER.

WE DON'T SEE A PEACEFUL SYRIA
HIS WEEKLY ADDRESS, WAS A BIT
MORE VAGUE.

TODAY, U.N. AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY SUGGESTED REGIME
CHANGE MAY NOW BE THE GOAL.
