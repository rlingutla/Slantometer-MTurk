A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
COME TO GET AWAY FROM
IT ALL, HELPING
OTHERS.

AND TO SEE THE CELL
PHONES LIGHT UP, HEAR
THE RINGING, THAT WOKE
ME UP THE FIRST NIGHT.

TONIGHT, A
DEEPENING MYSTERY
AFTER THE MASSACRE
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

DUE TO THE COST OF
THE PART AND INCREASED
COST IN AMMUNITION
WHEN YOU FIRE, NOT
SOMETHING WE
NECESSARILY SEE VERY
OFTEN.

HE'S A VET.

COMMUNITY SHAKEN BY
TRAGEDY BUT SHOWING SO
MUCH KINDNESS, THE
WORST OF TIMES
BRINGING OUT BEST OF
HUMANITY.

SHE WAS CRYING AND
JUST KEEP TALKING TO
HER SO WE KNEW SHE WAS
CONSCIOUS.

YELLOW POLICE TAPE
MARKS THE SCENE WHERE
THE RAIN OF GUNFIRE
CAME FROM, STEPHEN
PADDOCK'S 32ND FLOOR
HOTEL ROOM.

I'LL MISS HIS SMILE
AND I'LL MISS HIM
SAYING I LOVE YOU
MAMA.

INTRICATE SETUP,
WEAPONS MODIFIED FOR
MAXIMUM KILLING AND
STRATEGICALLY PLACED
CAMERAS.

I HAD NO IDEA A
LUNATIC LIVED THREE
DOORS DOWN.

VEGAS MASS SHOOTING,

WHAT HE DID WAS NOT
LOST ON HIS
19-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WHO WROTE IN A
FACEBOOK POST.

OH, MY GOD.

NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR DAD
WHO LOVED GOLF.

I WOULD PRAY THAT
NRA DID SOUL SEARCHING
ABOUT THE BUMP STOCKS.

HEATHER HAD A STORY
BOOK MARRIAGE.

THEY'RE LEGAL BUT
CONGRESS MAY
RECONSIDER.

HEAR MORE IN A MOMENT
BUT FIRST GETTING
FIRST GLIMPSE IN THE
KILLER'S HOTEL ROOM
TURNED SNIPER'S NEST
IN THE HOTEL BEHIND
ME.

POLICE WERE ON THE
LOOKOUT FOR MARILOU
DANLEY.
