WE MUST HAVE FAITH.

IT'S A DILEMMA HOW THAT DEBATE
WILL GO FORWARD AS TO WHAT LAW
COULD BE CRAFTED TO STOP WHAT
HAPPENED SUNDAY NIGHT.

I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH.

INCLUDING LAS VEGAS METROPOLITAN
POLICE OFFICE
POLICE OFFICERS.

THE FACT THAT AS YOU POINTED
OUT, SO MANY CIVILIANS DOVE ON
THEIR LOVED ONES OR SACRIFICED
THEIR OWN LIVES OR STOLE PICKUP
TRUCKS TO PUT PEOPLE IN THE BEDS
BECAUSE THE AMBULANCES WERE SO
OVERWHELMED.

A CONCERTED EFFORT ON THE PART
OF THIS WHITE HOUSE.

WE PRAY FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE
INJURED AND THOSE INJURED
OFFICERS THAT SO BRAVELY THROUGH
THEMSELVES INTO DANGER WHEN DUTY
CALLED.

WE CANNOT BE DEFINED BY THE EVIL
THAT THREATENINGS US OR THE
VIOLENCE THAT INCITES SUCH
TERROR.

IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SEE
WHAT YOUR LEADERSHIP IS
PROVIDING YOU.

SADLY THEY REPORTED TO US SOME
OF THE VICTIMS WITH REALLY --
WERE LEFT IN A POSITION TO
IDENTIFY THEM.

FIRST FROM THE FOX NEWS DECK
THIS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON,
PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT TO MEET
WITH HEROS OF THE LAS VEGAS
ATTACK INCLUDING THE FIRST
RESPONDERS AND ORDINARY PEOPLE
THAT RISKED THEIR LIVES TO SAVE
OTHERS.

GET BACK.

YES, WE'RE HURT, WE'RE HURT
BADLY, BUT WE'RE NOT BROKEN.

WHAT I SAW TODAY IS AN
INCREDIBLE TRIBUTE TO
PROFESSIONALISM.

WHERE IS IT AT?

BUT IN THE PAST YEAR ALONE, HE
HAS AMASSED SOME 30-PLUS
WEAPONS, A GUN SHOP OWNER IN
MESQUITE WHERE HE HAD A HOME
PADDOCK BOUGHT A WEAPON AND THAT
IS THE SAME DAY THAT HE CHECKED
IN TO THE MANDALAY BAY HOTEL.

NOW THE PRESIDENT MAKING THE
ROUNDS OUT IN LAS VEGAS AND
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS
GUN CONTROL AT A LATER DAY.

SHE FLEW IN TO LOS ANGELES FROM
THE PHILIPPINES LAST NIGHT.

SENATOR HELLER AND HIS WIFE,
MELANIA WAS THERE WITH HIM.
