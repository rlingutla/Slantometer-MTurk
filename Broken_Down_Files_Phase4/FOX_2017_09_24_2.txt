HURRICANE MARIA CAUSED
HEAVY DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO
WHERE THE POWER AND PHONE
SERVICE IS STILL OUT FOR MOST
OF THE ISLAND.

PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO USE
THEIR PHONES AFTER HURRICANE
MARIA SLAMMED THE ISLAND.

IT'S TERRIBLE.

IN FACT, FOLKS HAVE DRIVEN AS
FAR AS 40 OR 50 MILES TO TRY
TO FIND CELL PHONE SIGNAL TO
BE ABLE TO PLACE A CALL OR
MAKE A TEXT OR JUST SEND THAT
MESSAGE OUT.

IN WESTERN PUERTO RICO, THE
THREAT OF A COLLAPSING DAM HAS
FORCED 8000 PEOPLE TO
EVACUATE.

THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE
TOUGHEST, MOST CHALLENGING
PART FOR PEOPLE IN PUERTO RICO
AS WELL IS BACK IN THE
STATES.

AFTER RECEIVING MORE RAIN
TODAY, THE NATIONAL WEATHER
SERVICE EXTENDED A FLASH FLOOD
WARNING UNTIL 815 TONIGHT.

ALONG THE HIGHWAY IS ONE OF
THE FEW PLACES THAT HAS
SIGNAL.

YOU CAN SEE LONG LINES OF CARS
STOPPING TO TRY TO CONNECT
WITH THEIR LOVED ONE.

HAVE TRYING FOR DAYS TO GET
THE TOUCH WITH MY FAMILIES IN
THE UNITED STATES.

EVERYONE IS FIGHTING FOR
GASOLINE.

GETS BACK AT TWO OR
300 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
WITH TEN DOLLARS AT THE MOST.
