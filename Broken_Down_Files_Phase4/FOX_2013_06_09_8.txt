NEXT, LIVE, WE'LL TALK WITH
PETER KING OF NEW YORK WHAT
HE THINKS SHOULD HAPPEN TO
THE MAN EDWARD SNOWDEN.

HE FIRST WORK AS AN NS A A
AS SECURITY GUARD BEFORE
TRANSFERRING TO C.I.A..
THAT JOB GAVE HIM CLEARANCE
TO ACCESS A WIDE ARRAY OF
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

RESPONSE TONIGHT?

WE GOT A STATEMENT FROM THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY,
WHAT DOES IT SAY.

HE WAS A CONTRACTOR WORKING
FOR THE NSA.

UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE
GUY IS DISGRUNTLED.

I HAD TO WHISTLE BLOW ON
ABLE DANGER REGARDING DATA
MINING PRE-9/11 SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE DENNIS HASTERT
ASKED ME TO TESTIFY.

I'M TELLING YOU WITH HIS
ATTITUDE AND WAY HE HAS
TALKED ABOUT AND HE IS
DISGRUNTLED AND I SUSPECT
HE HAS INFORMATION FROM
C.I.A.

YOU HEARD CONGRESSMAN KING
TALKING A LITTLE BIT BUT
YOU DUG IN DEEPER.

SNOWDEN SAYS HE COULD
MONITOR ANYBODY.

SO WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN
THAT.

I AGREE WITH REPRESENTATIVE
KING THAT THIS IS TRAGIC.

HE COULD BE ARRESTED AT
ANY TIME A PLACE HE LEAST
EXPECTS.

GET A WARRANT, GO AFTER A
TERRORIST OR A MURDERER OR
RAPIST BUT DON'T TROLL
THROUGH A BILLION PHONE
RECORDS EVERY DAY.

GO TO THE CONGRESS OR
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

HE HAS DONE DAMAGE AND DO
MORE BY THE FACT HE IS
SITTING IN CHINA.

BECAUSE OF THAT YOU SEE
THINGS THAT MAYBE
DISTURBING, BUT OVER THE
COURSE OF A NORMAL PERSON'S
CAREER YOU WOULD SEE ONE OR
TWO INSTANCES.

HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN
ELIZABETH CITY, NORTH
CAROLINA AND LATER MOVED TO
MARYLAND BUT DESPITE AN
ACADEMIC RECORD HE WAS
GREAT WITH W COMPUTERS AND
FOUND HIS WAYS INTO JOBS AT
C.I.A.

NO ONE CAN OPPOSE THEM.

AND WHY IS HE IN HONG KONG?
