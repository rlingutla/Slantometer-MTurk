CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT HALLIE
JACKSON TAKES A LOOK.

HE'S THE REASON I WAS
ABLE TO RETIRE.

BUMP STOCK AND LAS
VEGAS SHOOTER
PURCHASED TWO BEFORE
THE ATTACK.

YEAH.

SHE'S OKAY.

HIS 22-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER AT THE
CONCERT.

OFFICIALS SAY HE
FIRED MOST OF THE
SHOTS IN THE FIRST
NINE MINUTES OF THE
ATTACK.

THERE WAS A POINT
WHERE I WAS BACKSTAGE,
LOOKED OUT AND
EVERYTHING WAS BLACKED
OUT.

WE ARE AWARE OF A
DEVICE CALLED A BUMP
STOCK, AND THAT
ENABLES AN INDIVIDUAL
TO SPEED UP THE
DISCHARGE OF
AMMUNITION.

BROTHER-IN-LAW THE
MOST PATRIOTIC PERSON
YOU EVER MET.

WORKING CONCERT
SECURITY SUNDAY NIGHT.

TURN SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS INTO VIRTUALLY
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS,
THAT'S SOMETHING I
THINK WE'LL TAKE A
LOOK AT.

I HAD TO STAND
THERE AND HOLD A
GIRL'S IV BAG AS SHE
WAS CRYING AND JUST
KEEP TALKING TO HER SO
THAT WE KNEW SHE WAS
CONSCIOUS.

MARRIED FOR MORE THAN
20 YEARS BEFORE
GETTING DIVORCED IN
2015.

BIGGEST RELIEF OF MY
LIFE.

CRITICAL QUESTION
TONIGHT, DID SHE HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT HE WAS
PLANNING?

COULDN'T TELL WHERE
THE BULLETS WERE
COMING FROM, HE
GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND
AND RUNNING WITH ME
AND THEN I FELT HIM --
I FELT HIM GET HIT IN
THE BACK.

REMINDS YOU OF
NIGHTMARE YOU HAD
WAKING UP.

FLEW TO THE
PHILIPPINES AROUND
PADDOCK WIRED MONEY TO
BANK IN THAT COUNTRY.
