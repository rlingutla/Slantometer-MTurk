MOURNERS LEFT CANDLES AND
FLOWERS AND ON THIS DRIVEWAY
SOMEONE WROTE THE WORD PEACE.

WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS
REMINDED OF, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE
OF THE BOMBER?

ONE OF THE THINGS THEY LOOK AT
IS THE LOCATION, BOSTON MARATHON
THE DATE ON TAX DAY, ON PATRIOTS
DAY, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS BEFORE
THE ANNIVERSARY OF WACO.

AN OBJECT ALONG THE MARATHON
ROUTE ON THE CURB THERE.

HIS NAME IS TYLER.

FROM THE MOTHER CONFIRMED
FATALITY.

WHAT ARE YOUR SOUTH, FOREIGN?

THEIR PROPOSAL WOULD PUT THE 11

KATHERINE HERITAGE, A QUICK
GOOGLE SEARCH, THERE ARE A LOT
OF MANUFACTURERS IN THE STATE OF
GEORGIA.

NAMED VICTORIA.

WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW,
APPARENTLY ARE PHOTOS OF SOME OF
THAT EVIDENCE.

HERE IN WASHINGTON, A SECTION OF
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE IN FRONT OF
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS SHOT DOWN.
