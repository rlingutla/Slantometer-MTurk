JULIE TO SERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH
SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION?

WILL THERE BE LESS REFUGEES
UNLESS DEATH?

ANIMOSITY BETWEEN TURKEY AND
ASSAD REGIME GOES BACK DECADES.

WE SEE THE U.S.

JULIE BUT SENATOR IF WE DON'T
GET INVOLVED WHAT DID THEY DO
JUST CHEMICALLY GASSED EVERY
BABY IN THE PLACE AND EVERY
WOMAN AND CHILD?

THE ONE AREA WHERE PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM
THAT WAS HIS DECISION TO ACT
WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BUT EVEN
ON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED
THAT DECISION TODAY IN A LETTER
TO CONGRESS.

LAST NIGHT AT THE PRESIDENTS
REQUEST THE TWO SAT DOWN AT
MAR-A-LAGO BUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL
DIVISIONS REMAIN.

JULIE ONE OF THOSE U.S. WARSHIPS THAT FIRED THE TOMAHAWK
CRUISE MISSILES INTO SERIOUS
HEADING TO AN UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO
REARM.

THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DEPLORABLE.

OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HEAR WHAT THEIR PLAN IS UNTIL IT
HAPPENS.

THE MAN WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN
LADEN SAYS DIPLOMACY MUST BE A
FACTOR.

HE WROTE THAT I ACTED IN THE
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND
FOREIGN-POLICY INTERESTS OF THE
UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO MY
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO
CONDUCT FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AS
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
DECISION TO LAUNCH AIRSTRIKES IN
SYRIA GETTING PRAISE AND
CRITICISM ARE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS SOME THINKING THE
MATTER NEEDS TO BE DEBATED ONCE
THEY RETURN FROM EASTER RECESS
IN TWO WEEKS THROUGH PUBLIC
WEIGHING IN AT A TOWN HALL IN
CALIFORNIA TODAY SAYING WHILE
SUCH AN ATTACK MAY BE NECESSARY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS NEED TO MAKE
THE DECISION, NOT THE PRESIDENT
ALONE.

EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF POLICIES HE
GOING TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AND
WILL IT ALIGN WITH THE JARED
KUSHNER BRANCH OF THE WEST WING
OR WHAT SIDE MORE WITH STEVE
BANNON?

THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING
ANY REPORTS OF A STAFF SHAKEUP
IS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM
THE GOOD WEEK THE PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S HAD.

JULIE WE HAVE TO "FOX NEWS"
TEAM COVERAGE.

RADIOS OFFICIALS SAY RUSSIA HAS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS EXPERTS INSIDE
SYRIA INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINAL
ROLE -- A LITERAL PRE-TWO DAYS
AFTER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA 

UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

I THINK THIS RIFT BETWEEN
BANNON AND KUSHNER IS INDICATIVE
OF THE CROSSROADS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS AT.

ARE CONDUCTING IN CREASED AIR
PATROLS A CASE OF SYRIAN OR
RUSSIAN MILITARY TRIES TO ATTACK
AMERICAN FORCES ON THE GROUND.
