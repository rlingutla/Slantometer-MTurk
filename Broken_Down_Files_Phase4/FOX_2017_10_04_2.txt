SHE DECIDED TO GO TO COLLEGE.

IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT ON
THE PHONE CALLING THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT.

WHEN THERE WERE BULLETS RAINING
DOWN FROM THE WINDOWS BEHIND ME,
50, 75 AT A TIME BECAUSE HE HAD
BIG MAGAZINES, THE OFFICERS TOOK
COVER BUT MOVED TOWARD THE
DANGER.

THEIR STORIES OF PEDIATRIC
SURGEONS OPERATING ON ADULTING,
OB-GYNS THAT TYPICALLY ARE NOT
IN THE TRAUMA CENTER MANNING THE
TABLES.

GENERALLY SPEAKING, I'LL BE
SURPRISED IF IT DOES BECAUSE
THEY BREAK DOWN SO QUICKLY IN
ALL OF THIS POLARIZING AND ALL
OF THE DIFFERENCES AND IF DEBATE
GOES NOWHERE BECAUSE OF THE
VOTES AND THE WAY THEY'RE SET UP
IN CONGRESS NOW.

EVERYTHING THAT THIS FELLOW
SEEMED TO DO SHORT OF WHAT HE
DID SUNDAY NIGHT WAS WITHIN THE
LETTER OF THE LAW.

OUR AUDIENCE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL
JUST A MOMENT AGO MET THE FIRST
POLICE OFFICERS CREDITED WITH
ENGAGING THE SUSPECT INSIDE THE
ROOM.

EIGHT I BELIEVE FROM THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA FROM DIFFERENT
JURISDICTIONS.

IT'S UNDERSTAND, CNN, ABC AND
CBS AND US.

WE'RE DEFINED BY THE LOVE, OUR
CARING AND OUR COURAGE.

SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN TAKE
PLACE FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND
HOURS.

IT'S UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR
HISTORY.

I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SILENCER
BILL THAT APPEARED TO BE
SHELVED.

WHEN THE WORD AND WORST OF
HUMANITY STRIKES, THE BEST OF
HUMANITY RESPONDS.

WE NEED TO ENFORCE EXISTING
LAWS.

GO THAT WAY.

I PERSONALLY WANT TO THANK THEM
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE
OF NEVADA FOR TAKING THE TIME TO
COME OUT HERE AND PROVIDE US
THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR COMFORT
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY'LL
BRING TO US.

THEY WERE BLOWING THE DOOR OPEN
WITHIN MINUTES TO GET INSIDE AND
CLEARLY HAD CORNERED THIS GUY,
THE SHOOTER.

IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE
INFORMATION FROM LAS VEGAS
POLICE, AND THEY CALL THEM METRO
THERE, THAT WHAT THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT, THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE
THE CALLS WERE INCOMING.

BRIEFLY I ATTENDED A CANDLELIGHT
VIGIL LAST NIGHT AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA.
