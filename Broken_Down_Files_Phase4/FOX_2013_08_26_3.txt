YEAH, THEY MAY HAVE
DECIDED TO DO THAT JON,
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE
DIFFICULTY THOSE YATIONS
WEAPONS INSPECTORS HAVE
FACED IN DOING THEIR JOB
INSIDE SYRIA.

DEFENSE SECRETARY CHUCK
HAGEL SAYS THE U.S. IS
LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS TO
RESPOND TO A SUSPECTED
CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA
THAT REPORTEDLY KILLED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
INCLUDING CHILDREN.

UNITED STATES IS LOOKING
AT ALL OPTIONS.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN
KERRY CAME OUT TODAY AND
RATHER DRAMATICALLY
DECLARED THAT IN FACT THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT BELIEVES
THAT THERE WAS A CHEMICAL
ATTACK AND THAT THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR IT.

THAT'S THE WORD FROM
PENTAGON OFFICIALS.

THESE WERE THE STRONGEST
COMMENTS YET FROM ANYONED
IN THE ADMINISTRATION.

THEY OBVIOUSLY WANT TO KEEP
AS MUCH AS THIS BEHIND
CLOSE THE DOORS AS THEY
CAN.

BUT U.S. OFFICIALS HAVE
ALREADY MADE THEIR OWN
CONCLUSIONS.

FIRED FROM AIRPLANES THAT
WOULD BE FLYING BELOW
SYRIAN RADAR.

AND PRESIDENT OBAMA IS
CONSIDERING THE OPTIONS FOR
A POSSIBLE MILITARY
RESPONSE.

PRESIDENT ASAN AS
DEFIANT AS EVER?

THAT FROM SECRETARY OF
STATE JOHN KERRY.

WE WILL WILL GO LIVE TO THE
WHITE HOUSE FOR THE LATEST
ON THE MILITARY OPTIONS
COMING UP ON "THE FOX
REPORT."

JOHN KERRY SAYS EVIDENCE
IS REAL AND COMPELLING, HE
SAYS THERE MUST BE
CONSEQUENCES.

IN THE INTERVIEW PRESIDENT
ASSAD SAID QUOTE  THINK
MEANING THE UNITED STATES
CAN START A WAR BUT THEY
WILL NOT KNOW WHERE IT WILL
SPREAD OR HOW IT WILL END.

THAT'S AN OPTION ON THE
TABLE.

IST WARSHIPS IN STRIKING
DISTANCE OF SYRIA.

UNDER PRETTY HEAVY PRESSURE
FROM REPUBLICANS TO ACT.

THAT'S WHY REPUBLICAN JOHN
MCCAIN TODAY DECLARED THE
PRESIDENT BETTER BACK UP
THESE WORDS.

THIS IS THE FOX REPORT,
TONIGHT, OF THE EVIDENCE OF
A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK
IN SYRIA IS UNDENIABLE.
