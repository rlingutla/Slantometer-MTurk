THE PICTURES ARE VERY DRAMATIC,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED THIS
UNFOLD LIVE ON THE WEATHER
CHANNEL.

SEVERE WEATHER BREAKING OUT
RIGHT NOW FROM THE PLAINS TO THE
GREAT LAKES.

BIG-TIME DEBRIS CLOUD.

REMIND FOLKS THE WEATHER CHANNEL
IS COVERING THIS ONLINE AND ON
CABLE.

WOW!

IN OKLAHOMA CITY,
70-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS TOOK DOWN
BLOCK AFTER BLOCK OF POWER
LINES.

KELLY, WHAT AREAS ARE ON ALERT?

IT'S GOING TO BE HEADING
FOR --
 RIGHT IN FRONT OF US!

ONE MILE SOUTH OF WATERLOO ROAD.

BASEBALL-SIZED HAIL.

THERE IS A CLEARING NOW BUT
LESTER, WE'RE TOLD THE VERY
WORST OF THIS STORM COULD BE
STILL TO COME TONIGHT AND INTO
TOMORROW.

SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS AND
TORNADO WATCHES ARE UP IN AT
LEAST SIX STATES TONIGHT.

THEY COULD BE LARGE AND
LONG-LIVED, THAT MEANS LASTING
FOR MILES ON THE GROUND.

I PROBABLY DRIVE BACK CLOSE
TO OKLAHOMA CITY AND JUST STAY
IN THAT UNDERGROUND PARKING
GARAGE FOR A WHILE.

RESIDENTS ARE AWARE TONIGHT AND
MONDAY COULD BE EVEN WORSE.

JUST WITHIN THE LAST HOUR WE
HEARD THE TORNADO SIRENS
MULTIPLE TIMES.

IT IS RIGHT OVER US BUT WE CAN
STILL SEE IN CONTACT WITH THE
GROUND FARTHER OFF TOWARD THE
NORTHEAST.

I JUST DON'T TAKE CHANCES WITH
TORNADOES.

TAKE A LOOK AT THE TORNADO
WATCHES FROM GO FROM WISCONSIN
AS WELL AS THE TWIN CITIES, DOWN
INTO TULSA.

SO THE TURNING OF THOSE WINDS
ALLOWS THE STORMS TO DEVELOP
ROTATION.
