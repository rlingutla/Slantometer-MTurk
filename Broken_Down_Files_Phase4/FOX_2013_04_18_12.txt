THEY ARE BOTH CARRYING
BAGS.

NEWLY RELEASED PHOTOS AMEND
THE VIDEO.

WELL, THE FBI CONSIDERS
BOTH MEN ARMED AND
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION
TIPS EVIDENCE, ANYTHING
THAT MAY HELP,
1-800-CALL-FBI 225-5324
THE NUMBER THAT IS NOW
PUBLIC AS WELL.

MAYBE IN THE VICINITY OF A
HOTEL WHERE THESE GUYS
STAYED.

NOW AT LEAST FUR TRACKS IN
THIS INVESTIGATION THAT WE
KNOW OF, THE BOMB
COMPONENTS, THE VIDEOS, THE
STILLS AND THEN ALSO SOCIAL
MEDIA, BILL.

DO NOT TRY TO APPREHEND
THEM.

AND THAT'S WHAT CLEARLY
PROPELLED THEM TO RELEASE
THESE IMAGES WEIGHING,
LETTING THESE GUYS KNOW
THAT THEY WERE BEING HUNTED
AGAINST TRYING TO GENERATE
MORE INTEL AND MORE
INFORMATION AND POSSIBLY
NAMES AND ADDRESSES FOR THE
TWO GUYS THAT WE ARE NOW
SEEING IN THIS VIDEO AND IN
THESE STILL PICTURES AS YOU
MENTIONED THEY ARE ONLY
BEING IDENTIFIED AS
SUSPECTS NUMBER 1 AND 2.

THE FEDS COULD FILE
TERRORISM CHARGES AGAINST
THESE SUSPECTS.

AND SOME OF THESE THINGS
THEY ARE USING TO FILTER
SOME OF THE CALLS THAT ARE
COMING IN.

FOR CLARITY THESE IMAGES
SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONES, I
EMPHASIZE THE ONLY ONES
THAT THE PUBLIC SHOULD VIEW
TO ASSIST US.

OUR TEAM FOX COVERAGE
CONTINUES WITH CATHERINE
HERRIDGE.

IF THEY SPENT ANY TIME IN
THE BOSTON AREA, OR ANY
TIME IN THE UNITED STATES,
THEN SOMEONE INTERACTED
WITH THEM.

THEY SHOULD LOOK AT THE
JACKETS THEY ARE WEARING.

NOW WE HAVE TO FOCUS THE
PUBLIC AND FOCUS THEM ON A
MAN'S DAILY ROUTINE AND A
MAN'S DAILY BEHAVIOR.

RENT A ROOM MAYBE TWICE IN
THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

HERE IS MORE FROM THE
SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF
THE BOSTON OFFICE.

SO IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO
THE PUBLIC.

BRIDGESTONE BALL CAP.

BILL, THE IMPORTANT THING
RIGHT NOW IS THAT ANYBODY
THAT WAS IN THE AREA AFTER
THE FINISH LINE OUGHT TO BE
LOOKING AT THEIR FILM THAT
THEY THOUGHT WAS IRRELEVANT
PRIOR TO THIS EVENT BECAUSE
THESE INDIVIDUALS DROPPED
THE BOMBS ON THE STREET AND
KEPT ON WALKING.
