IN AN INVESTIGATION, YOU DON'T
WANT TO TIP YOUR HAT.

HE BELIEVES THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK
DID HAVE AN ACCOMPLICE.

WELL, WE HAVE DEFINITELY
CONFIRMED THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK
DID BOOK A HOTEL ROOM IN CHICAGO
OVERLOOKING GRANT PARK IN AUGUST
DURING THE LOLLAPALOOZA CONCERT
THAT MALIA OBAMA WAS IN
ATTENDANCE THERE.

PERSON MAY BE CRAZY.

AT NO TIME DID SHE KNOW WHAT HE
WAS GOING TO DO HERE'S DANLEY'S
ATTORNEY READING HER STATEMENT.

CERTAINLY -- I'VE COVERED SOME
OF THESE TRAGEDIES A LONG TIME.

WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT.

REASON, RIGHT?

WE CAN CONFIRM A RESERVATION WAS
MADE UNDER THE NAME OF STEPHEN
PADDOCK.

THAT'S COMING UP FROM THE FOX
NEWS DECK ON A THURSDAY
FIRST RESPONDERS THAT RUSHED
INTO HARM'S WAY AND FIRED INTO A
CROWD OF 22,000 PEOPLE.

AND THEY MAY.

YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER 2018
ELECTION YEAR, A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS THAT DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE AN ELECTION YEAR ISSUE.

HER NAME IS MARILOU DANLEY.

MAYBE THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN
PURCHASING 33 WEAPONS OVER THE
COURSE OF A YEAR.

IN A STATEMENT LEADERS OF THE
GUN RIGHTS GROUP WROTE "THE NRA
BELIEVES THAT DEVICES DESIGNED
TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES TO
FUNCTION LIKE FULLY AUTOMATIC
RIFLES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO
ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS."

HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO ME OR
TOOK ANY ACTION THAT I WAS AWARE
OF THAT I UNDERSTOOD IN ANY WAY
TO BE A WARNING THAT SOMETHING
HORRIBLE LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO
HAPPEN.

SHE SAID WHEN HE SENT HER
$100,000 AND TOLD HER TO BUY A
HOUSE, SHE THOUGHT HE WAS
BREAKING UP WITH HER.

WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT HE
BOOKED A HOTEL ROOM AT THE
MANDALAY BAY AND ANOTHER CONCERT
CALLED LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL BY
CHANCE THE RAPPER.

THEN THEY SAID THE FEEL OF
VICTIMS WAS ALMOST A MILE LONG.

SHE SAID THE KILLER SENT HER TO
THE PHILIPPINES WHERE SHE HAD
FAMILY AND SHE WAS OUT OF THE
COUNTRY FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS.
