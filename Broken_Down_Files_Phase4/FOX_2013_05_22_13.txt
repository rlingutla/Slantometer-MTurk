WE WERE UP FOR HOURS
LOOKING AT THE DESTRUCTION
THE TORNADO INFLICTED.

PEOPLE SURVIVED THE
TORNADO, TURNS OUT A
MEDICAL FACILITY TURNING A
MEDICAL FACILITY INTO
ABSOLUTE RUBBLE TRAPPING 14
PEOPLE INSIDE.

GET EVERYTHING UP AND
RUNNING AND THEN GET PAST
THE FUNERALS AND THE SHOCK
OF THING THIS AND ONCE WE
TURN THE CORNER THEN WE
WILL ALL DIVE IN AND TRY TO
RAISE A BUNCH OF MONEY FOR
THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE IN THE MUSIC LOVE TO
DO.

ALMOST LIKE HIT BY
EARTHQUAKE.

THEY HAVE BEEN DRONED TO
DEATH.

THE TOP IS VERY WIDE.

SHE IS A FOURTH GRADE
TEACHER AT BRIAR WOOD
ELEMENTARY.

LET'S GO AGAIN TO THE LEFT
AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THESE
PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE AREAS
ARE RESTRICTED FOR OBVIOUS
REASONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
TO LET THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE
HERE COME AND GET TO THEIR
HOMES, GET TO THEIR
BELONGINGS AND TRY TO
SALVAGE WHAT THEY CAN.

TORNADO IS JUST ANOTHER BAD
DAY BLOOD ROCK WE ARE RIGHT
BACK IN THE MIDDLE.

EVERYTHING FROM PASSING OUT
WATER BOTTLES, OFFERING
FOOD TO RESCUE WORKERS AND
THE MEDIA FOR THAT MATTER.

THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC
THREATS THERE.

TOBY KEITH GREW UP RIGHT
HERE IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS
WHERE THE STORM WAS AT ITS
WIDEST.

FRANKLY, YOU CAN SET UP A
TRIPOD AND CAMERA AND YOU
CAN DO LIVE SHOTS BUT TO
REALLY CONVEY TO PEOPLE HOW
WIDESPREAD THE DAMAGE IS,
THIS TELLS THE STORY.

ON THIS DAY IN 1999, THE
PEOPLE OF MOORE, OKLAHOMA
HAD BEEN CLEANING UP FOR 19
DAYS.

THERE ARE ABOUT 10 ELDERLY
PATIENTS INSIDE AT THE
TIME.

OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU
ALONG THE PATH OF THE
STORM.

NOT FAR FROM YOUR LOCATION
IN OUR QUICK RESPONSE
VEHICLE, A QRV.

SCOTT, PULL OUT AND SHOW
FORWARD IF YOU WOULD, AND
YOU WILL SEE AHEAD OF US
THE PATH OF THE STORM WAS
MUCH THINNER, MEANING THE
CLOUDS HAD LIFTED HIGHER
AND THE PART OF THE CONE
THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE
GROUND IS MUCH SMALLER.

WE HAVE SEEN THE HARD HIT
NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THIS BUT
ONLY FROM ABOVE.
