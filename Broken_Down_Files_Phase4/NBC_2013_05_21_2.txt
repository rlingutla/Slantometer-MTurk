OUR TEAM IS HERE AND ON THE
GROUND, AND OUR SPECIAL COVERAGE
BEGINS NOW.

AND THERE'S SO MUCH OF THIS,
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG HAUL
THAT BEGINS WITH A GRID AND
HOUSE-BY-HOUSE SEARCHES, WHICH
HAVE NOT YET ALL BEEN COMPLETED.

IT STANDS RIGHT NOW CONFIRMED AT
24.

BRIAN, UNRECOGNIZABLE.

WITH SAFE ROOMS IN THEM.

A CATASTROPHIC RAMPAGE FOR 17
MILES ON THE GROUND.

THIS WAS THE HEART OF THE
SEARCH YESTERDAY.

OFFICIALS SAY IT COULD CHANGE
AGAIN BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL
THOSE UNACCOUNTED FOR, BRIAN, AS
THE SEARCH GOES ON.

LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND LET'S
TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS REGION
NEEDS TO DO.

WHEN YOU HAVE A LIMITED
NUMBER OF FUNDS, YOU SET
PRIORITIES ON WHICH SCHOOLS YOU
DO WANT TO ASK FOR.

ENTRANCES BLOCKED WITH CRUMBLED
CARS TOSSED DURING THE STORM.

A RESIDENTIAL
SAFE ROOM CAN BE INSTALLED IN
THE GROUND OR INSIDE THE HOME
ITSELF.

WHY?

LESTER HOLT, PART OF OUR TEAM
HERE WITH US TO START OFF OUR
COVERAGE.

IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

WE HAVE AN ACTIVE AND DANGEROUS
SITUATION IN SEVEN SEPARATE
STATES FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS.

AND, BRIAN, MISS CROSSWHITE WAS
TELLING US THAT THEY HAD SORT OF
A FIREMEN'S BRIGADE GOING WITH
ADULTS HELPING SOME OF THE KIDS
OUT OF THE SCHOOL,
WALKING OVER A BOOKCASE, USING
IT AS STAIRS AND PASS THEM ALONG
FROM ONE ADULT TO THE NEXT TO
GET THEM TO SAFETY.

ANXIOUS HOUR WONDERING IF HER
LITTLE BOY WAS STILL ALIVE, AND
NOW SHE WONDERS WHY THE SCHOOL
DIDN'T HAVE A BETTER SHELTER
PLAN.

SHE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

THERE IS ALMOST A FAITH-BASED
FEMA HERE IN OKLAHOMA.
