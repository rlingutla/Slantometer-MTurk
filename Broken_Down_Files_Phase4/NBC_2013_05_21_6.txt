WE WILL REBUILD IT.

ON THIS PASS ALL THEY FIND IS
EMPTY HOMES.

MOM, THAT'S MY FRIEND.

AT LEAST 24 ARE CONFIRMED DEAD.

MAYOR GLENN LEWIS HERE IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

WELL, YOU CAN'T FIND WHERE
YOU'RE AT.

WE THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD, TO BE
HONEST.

WHEN WE COME BACK,
INFORMATION FOR ALL THOSE
LOOKING TO HELP THE FOLKS HERE.

TODAY NEW IMAGES OF THE STORM AS
IT BARRELED INTO MOORE,
REINFORCING WHAT EVERYONE HERE
IS SAYING --
 THE WHOLE ROOF JUST CAME OFF.

WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING
TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS BUILDING
CODE AND SHELTER ISSUE HERE IN
THIS DEVASTATED TOWN OF MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

RIGHT.

TORNADO WATCHES.

INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 500
STUDENTS WERE COUNTING DOWN THE
DAYS IN THEIR FINAL WEEK OF
CLASS, BUT IN JUST A MATTER OF
MINUTES, THEIR CAMPUS WENT
FROM LOOKING LIKE THIS TO THIS.

WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE
WRECKAGE OF JUST ONE OF THESE
RESIDENTIAL HOMES.

YES.

WE'VE SEEN IT FROM THE AIR.

THERE ARE PRIVATE DONORS, AND
I'VE BEEN ASSURED ALL DAY THAT
SO MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LINING UP
TO TAKE CARE OF THE GOOD PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN HIT.

WE ASKED HIM AT THE TIME A
QUESTION SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE,
WHERE DO YOU BEGIN?

LAST YEAR 500 HOMEOWNERS WERE
CHOSEN OUT OF 16,000 APPLICANTS.

IT'S JUST LIKE A LAWN MOWER WENT
RIGHT THROUGH.
