SAT WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND
NOW THEY FIND THEMSELVES
STANDING ON MERE SPLINTERED
BOARDS AND MATTRESSES AND
ELECTRICAL WIRES AND JUST
HEART BREAK IS WHAT IT IS.

THAT'S THE WORD TONIGHT
FROM THE OWNER OF THE LOCAL
WARREN MULTI-PLEX MOVIE
THEATER.

HAS STRUCK OUR TEAM IS THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
COME HERE TO HELP.

HOSPITALS REPORT THEY ARE
200 PEOPLE.

VIDEO CAPTURED ONE EVER THE
TERRORISTS RANTING HOLDING
ONE OF THE BLOODY KNIVES
BEFORE HE POLICE SHOT HIM.

DOZEN BEES OF THEM
CHILDREN.

AS CREWS WORKED ON THAT
THEATER EARLIER THIS WEEK
THERE WAS A MESSAGE ON THE
MARQUEE THAT READ PLEASE
PRAY.

TWO DAYS LATER ONE OWNER OF
ONE OF THOSE BUSINESSES
SAYS IS HE ALREADY GETTING
READY TO REOPEN.

BUT YOUR HOUSE ITSELF IS
FINE.

AS OUT MIGHT IMAGINE.

AND THE AREA OF THE FUNNEL
CLOUD THAT WAS TOUCHING THE
GROUND IS SMALLER.

LIFTED BACK NOT TO BE SEEN
AGAIN AND THEN THE
RESIDENTS CAME BACK TO TRY
TO ASSESS WHAT HAD
HAPPENED.

10 OF THOSE VICTIMS,
CHILDREN.

JEREMY IF WE CAN AND CAN
YOU SEE THAT THE DAMAGE IS
EXTREMELY RANDOM.

THEY CRAWLED OUT.

YOU WILL SEE AN AREA WHERE
IT JUST SORT OF DUG UP THE
DIRT AND REPLACED THE GRASS
WITH DIRT.

AND AS IT APPROACHED, YOU
KNOW, I JUST PUT MY ARMS
OVER THE CHILDREN.

NEIGHBORHOOD AFTER
NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE AFTER
HOUSE, JUST COMPLETELY
OBLITERATED.

THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE
THE SEARCH JUST IN CASE
THERE IS SOMEONE NOT ON
THEIR LIST.

THIS ISN'T A TWO MILE WIDE
PATH IN THIS AREA.
