THEY HAVE NO HISTORY OF
ATTACKING THE AMERICA.

HOURS AND 56 MINUTES FLAT.

THEN HE LOOKED AND HIS DECK HAS
A BOX, THE ENGINE BOX IS UP
ABOVE THE DECK.

BUT ONCE HE'S CONSCIOUS A
SPESHLT TEAM PLANS TO QUESTION
HIM UNDER WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE
PUBLIC SAFETY EXCEPTION.

HOUSE DOWN, THE PRIORITY NOW IS
TO LEARN THE MOTIVES OF THE TWO
BROTHERS WHO AUTHORITIES SAY ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL
TERROR ATTACK ON THE BOSTON
MARATHON.

THAT DARK FORM RIGHT THERE IN
THE BACK OF THE BOAT, THAT,
POLICE SAY, IS 19-YEAR-OLD
DZHOKHAR TSARNAEV.

THE SURPRISING ONLINE CAMPAIGN,
BREWING RIGHT NOW, KEEP IT HERE.

THERE WAS NO FANATICISM.

ON THIS DAY WHEN A MILLIONS OF
BOSTONIANS EMERGED FROM THEIR
POLICE-ORDERED HIBERNATION, WE
ARE GETTING EXTRAORDINARY NEW
IMAGES FROM THE CAPTURE OF
SUSPECT NUMBER TWO.

I MEAN, HE'S TAKEN CARE OF THAT
BOAT METICULOUSLY SINCE HE'S HAD
IT AND NOW IT'S FULL OF HOLES.

INDEED THEY ARE.

LET ME GET BACK TO THE FBI
INVESTIGATION INTO THE OLDER
BROTHER.

AND TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA
HELD A MEETING IN THE SITUATION
ROOM TO GET AN UPDATE ON THE
INVESTIGATION.

WHAT INVESTIGATORS WILL WANT TO
FIND OUT IS WHETHER HE WENT TO
SOME SORT OF TRAINING CAMP, SOME
RADICAL TRAINING CAMP THAT DID
HAVE A BEEF WITH AMERICA.

WE HAVE MOVEMENT.

I CERTAINLY CAN'T PUT IT
TOGETHER THAT HE WAS A PERSON
FIRING A WEAPON AND POTENTIALLY
KILLING PEOPLE.

THE POLICEMANHUNT WAS
UNPRECEDENTED.

THE RUSSIANS SAID HE WAS A
RADICAL ISLAMIST, PREPARING TO
LEAVE THE U.S., POSSIBLY FOR A
TRIP TO THE CAUCUSES.

THE HEROISM, THE STOICISM,
COMMUNITY SPIRIT AND ALL OF THAT
EXPRESSED WITH THAT UNMISTAKABLE
ACCENT, A MIXTURE OF VINEGAR AND
MOLASSES.

WHAT?
