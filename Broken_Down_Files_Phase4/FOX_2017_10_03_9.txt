DIDN'T CARE ABOUT RELIGION OR
POLITICS.

THEY PULLED HARD DRIVES AS WELL.

WE HAVE DEBRIEFING TEAMS
OFFERING SERVICE TO THE STAFF.

THIS DOESN'T GIVE US MOTIVE BUT

THIS GUY IS REALLY A GHOST WHEN
IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND NO

A REMINDER, SHEP, AS WELL AS
SO MANY PHYSICAL SCARS, THERE
WILL BE MANY MENTAL SCARS THAT
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO HEAL.
