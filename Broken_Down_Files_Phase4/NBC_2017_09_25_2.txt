GETTING WATER IS
EXTRAORDINARILY
DIFFICULT.

WITH MANGLED POWER
LINES EVERYWHERE AND
EYE-POPPING LINES AT
GAS STATIONS, PEOPLE
HERE FEEL PARALYZED
AND DISCONNECTED.

THERE IS DEVASTATION
EVERYWHERE.

WHEN OFFERED A
SATELLITE PHONE, SHE
TELLS THEM SHE'S ALL
RIGHT, BUT HER
95-YEAR-OLD
GRANDFATHER PASSED
AWAY DURING THE STORM.

A DAY-LONG JOURNEY
ABOARD A MILITARY
TRANSPORT.

AS WE NOTED, WE
ARRIVED HERE TODAY
ABOARD AN AIR NATIONAL
GUARD C-130.

THIS IS THE TOWN,
YES.

MANY OF US, WE
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF
MONEY.

NO POWER AND NO END IN
SIGHT.

AND THEY'RE REALIZING
NOW THIS IS A MISSION
THAT'S GOING TO LAST A
LONG TIME.

THIS C-130 BELONGS TO
THE RHODE ISLAND
NATIONAL GUARD.

NO CELL SERVICE
EITHER.

WITH THE SUN BARELY
UP, THIS CORNER OF THE
SAVANNAH INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT IN GEORGIA WAS
ALIVE WITH THE SOUNDS
OF VITAL PROVISIONS
BEING LOADED ABOARD
NATIONAL GUARD
TRANSPORTS.

A HUB OF AN AERIAL
LIFELINE PROVIDING
HUMANITARIAN AID THAT
TAKES ON ADDED MEANING
FOR THESE CREWS.

I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

EVEN AS WE LOOK AT
WHAT HURRICANE MARIA
DID TO PUERTO RICO,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT
TONIGHT, IT IS STILL A
HURRICANE, A CATEGORY
1.

THAT MEANS BANKS AND
HOSPITALS AND THE
THINGS THAT PEOPLE
DEPEND ON, THEY CAN'T
GET TO UNLESS THERE
ARE GENERATORS
WORKING.

SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW
THE ISLAND BEFORE
MARIA HIT AND AFTER,
NOW ALMOST TOTALLY IN
THE DARK.

THIS SMALL PIECE OF
AMERICA ALMOST A
THOUSAND MILES FROM
THE U.S. MAINLAND HAS
NEVER FELT MORE
REMOTE, BUT IT IS NOT
FORGOTTEN.

WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM
PUERTO RICO IN JUST A
MOMENT, BUT FIRST,
LET'S SEND IT UP TO
NEW YORK WITH SAVANNAH
GUTHRIE WHO HAS SOME
OF THE OTHER BIG
STORIES OF THE DAY.
