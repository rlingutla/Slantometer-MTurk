CORRECT?

THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE TERRORISTS
HAVE.

EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.

A PLACE OF CELEBRATION INSTANTLY
TRANSFORMED INTO A SCENE OF
CHAOS.

EVERYBODY STARTED RUNNING THE
OTHER WAY.

THE MARINE CORPS MARATHON
ATTRACTS 30,000 RUNNERS EACH
YEAR.

AT FIRST IT SOUNDED LIKE A
CANNON BLAST.

THEY WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING
ON.

DOUBLE IT, 52 THE MILES BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TWO SIDES OF THE
STREET.

THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TO
GET SCARED, RUN AWAY.

THEN CHAOS EVERYWHERE.

PEOPLE REPORTED SEEING
TOURNIQUETS APPLIED ON THE
RACEWAY.

RACE OF A DIFFERENT KIND -- TO
RESCUE PEOPLE AND SAVE THEM.

AUTHORITIES WOULD NOT SPECULATE
ON WHETHER IT WAS TERRORISM.

IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY
DIFFICULT, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE,
THAT 26-MILE ROUTE.

THAT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

THE TWO EXPLOSIONS
GOING OFF WITHIN SECONDS OF EACH
OTHER AT BOSTON'S COPLEY SQUARE.

EVERYBODY WAS RUSHING.

INSTEAD THIS YEAR IT TURNED INTO
A HORRIBLE DAY.

AND THEN PANDEMONIUM STRUCK.
