OVER.

NIGHT'S GAME WAS CANCELED FOR
SECURITY REASONS, THE EMOTIONS
RAN EVEN DEEPER THIS AFTERNOON.

THE VILLAGE WHERE THE MOTHER'S
FAMILY LIVED, WE SEARCHED FOR
CLUES ABOUT THE BROTHERS.

THE HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM DID
WORK IN TRYING TO NEGOTIATE HIM
OUT OF THAT BOAT.

YOU THOUGHT RIGHT AWAY IT WAS
A BOMB?

YOU KNOW, MY WIFE WAS TEN YARDS
FROM A MAJOR EXPLOSION.

IF THEY RULE OUT SOME SORT OF
FOREIGN PLOT, AND THAT'S A BIG
IF AT THIS POINT, IT WOULD MAKE
THESE TWO BROTHERS, ASSUMING
THEY'RE PROVEN TO BE GUILTY, IT
WOULD MAKE THEM LONE WOLVES,
WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND IT, HAS
BEEN KEEPING UP NATIONAL
SECURITY OFFICIALS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT FOR YEARS NOW.

YEAH, I WAS JUST THINKING I
CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS ING.

SEEKING REFUGEE STATUS.

WITH THE MANHUNT NOW OVER, THE
FBI IS LOOKING FOR A
MOTIVE BEHIND THE BOMBINGS?

HIS NAME IS DAVE HENNEBERRY.

PLENTY OF COMMERCE TODAY.

THE BLAST FROM THE EXPLODED
FERTILIZER PLANT IN WEST, TEXAS,
SO STRONG IT ROCKED BERTI'S CAR.

WE'RE GLAD THEY'RE BOTH OKAY.

CALL WITH ABC NEWS THIS EVENING,
THE MOTHER OF THE SUSPECTED
BOSTON BOMBERS SAID SHE AND HER
HUSBAND PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO THE
U.S. TO SEE THEIR YOUNG SON
CAPTURED FRIDAY NIGHT.
