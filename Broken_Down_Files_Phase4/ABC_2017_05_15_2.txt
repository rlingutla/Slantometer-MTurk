CRIED A LOT.

AND TONIGHT, INVESTIGATORS SAY
NEW CLUES MAY BE POINTING TO A
FAMILIAR CULPRIT.

NEW WAVES OF THIS ATTACK.

USE THOSE AUTOMATIC UPGRADES.

IT APPEARS LESS THAN $70,000
HAS BEEN PAID IN RANSOM.

HACKERS INFECTING SOME 300,000
COMPUTERS IN MORE THAN 150
COUNTRIES NOW, INCLUDING THE
U.S., LOCKING THOSE COMPANIES UP
THROUGH THEIR COMPUTERS, AND
THEN DEMANDING RANSOM TO FREE
THE FILES.

MORE THAN 300,000 IN 150
COUNTRIES.

HORRIBLE.

COMPANIES APPEAR TO HAVE
FOLLOWED THE HACKERS' DIRECTIONS
TO PAY $300 IN RANSOM OR MORE TO
HAVE THEIR FILES FREED, AND
THAT, TOO, TURNED OUT TO BE
SCAM.

AND NOW TO ANOTHER GLOBAL
WORRY AT THIS HOUR.

BUT THE COUNTRY HAS A LONG
RECORD OF COMPUTER CRIMINALITY.
