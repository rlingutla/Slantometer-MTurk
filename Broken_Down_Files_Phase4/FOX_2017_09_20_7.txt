YOU HAVE TO BE STRETCHED THIN
RIGHT NOW.

ONE WOMAN THAT LIVES IN SAN JUAN
TOLD THE "MIAMI HERALD" THAT HER
HOUSE WAS TREMBLING.

HOW CAN WE HELP?

NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF
HELP.

WE KEPT 3,200 STAFF ON THE U.S.
VIRGIN ISLANDS AND PUERTO RICO.

PUERTO RICO UNFORTUNATELY,
THEY'RE UNDER FLASH FLOOD
WARNINGS IN THE COMMONWEALTH.

EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK HERE, IT'S A
WET MISS AND IT'S NOT GETTING
BETTER SOON.

SOIL.

TO MOVE AROUND HERE, IT'S
STREAMLY DIFFICULT.

THEY'RE STARTING TO DEPLOY OUT
AS THE STORM -- ELEMENTS OF THE
STORM PASS THROUGH.

SO THAT'S MAYBE THE REASON SOME
PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE STATES
ARE CALLING THEIR FAMILIES AND
PEOPLE AND FRIENDS IN PUERTO
RICO AND THEY'RE NOT ANSWERING,
BECAUSE OF THAT.

WE MAY NEED A LOT OF HELP TO
HELP THE ISLAND RECOVER.

SO NO POWER MEANS NO WATER, NO
SEWER.

THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE
SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE U.S.

THE FEDS FACING ANOTHER HUGE
CLEANUP.

SHEPARD, THE WIND HAS CALMED
CONSIDERABLY, UNDER 50 MILES PER
HOUR THAT MEANS THE POLICE AND
FIRST RESPONDERS CAN GO OUT.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PUERTO
RICO'S BEST AND BRIGHTEST LEAVE
THE ISLAND EACH YEAR FOR BETTER
JOBS IN THE U.S.

WE'RE TRACKING THE HURRICANE.

HE CALLED ME.

WHERE I'M STANDING NOW, CHUNKS
OF BUILDINGS, SATELLITE DISHES,
BALCONIES, PIECES OF WALL, HOLES
IN BUILDINGS.
