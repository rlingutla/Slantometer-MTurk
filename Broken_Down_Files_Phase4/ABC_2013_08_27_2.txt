I SHOULD REMIND EVERYBODY HE
GREW UP A LOT OF HIS LIFE IN
LONDON.

U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE IN PLACE,
CRUISE MISSILES AT THE READY,
THE TARGETS IN SYRIA SELECTED.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS A DECISION
IS NEAR AND U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE
IN POSITION.

THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED
IN THIS CIVIL WAR BUT IT MUST BE
EXTRAORDINARY FOR YOU TO LOOK AT
THIS MAN AS YOU SAY EDUCATED IN
LONDON WHO IS DOING THESE KINDS
OF BRUTAL, BRUTAL THINGS.

THERE IS NO ONE STRONGER IN THIS
REGION.

ENOUGH TO RAIN CHEMICALS DOWN
ON HIS PEOPLE KNOWING THE
POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES THERE IS
NO TELLING WHAT HE WOULD DO IF
CREWS MISSILES START RAINING
DOWN ON HIS OWN REGIME.

THEY HAVE MADE A POINT OF THAT
BUT CERTAINLY MILITARY TARGETS
IN HIS REGIME.

A BRUTAL DICTATOR WHO THE VICE
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY IS
UNDENIABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
GASSING HIS OWN INNOCENT PEOPLE.

AS WE BEGIN TONIGHT, THE CLOCK
IS TICKING ON U.S. MILITARY
ACTION IN SYRIA.

THE GOAL, TO STOP A MAN USING
BRUTAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS 5,000
MILES AWAY.

NO QUESTION THAT THE U.S. IS
READY TO STRIKE A PUNISHING BLOW
TO ASSAD.

ADD TO THAT 100,000 MISSILES AND
ROCKETS INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF
POWERFUL SCUD MISSILES WHICH
COULD REACH ANY TARGET IN
NEIGHBORING ISRAEL.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU SAYING ISRAEL IS READY
FOR ANY SCENARIO AND IF WE
IDENTIFY ANY ATTEMPT WHATSOEVER
TO HARM US, WE WILL RESPOND IN
STRENGTH.

HE'S A PHYSICIAN, EDUCATED
THERE.

IT MIGHT CREATE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR ISRAEL THAT THEY
WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF AND PERHAPS ASSAD WOULD RUE
THE DAY THAT HE GAVE THEM THIS
OPPORTUNITY.

I THINK THEY'RE AFRAID OF
REACTION AND THEY DON'T WANT
REGIME CHANGE.

THE SYRIAN REGIME.

WHAT DO THEY EXPECT FROM HIM
NEXT?

THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS HUNDREDS
OF TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND STOCK
PILES OF SARIN.
