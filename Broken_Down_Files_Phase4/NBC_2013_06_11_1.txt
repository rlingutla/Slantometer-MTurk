LAM, HIS PICTURE PLASTERED ON
EVERY HONG KONG NEWSPAPER
REPORTS NBC'S IAN WILLIAMS.

AFTER BRIEFLY COMING FORWARD
THIS WEEKEND TO ANNOUNCE HE WAS
THE SOURCE OF THE DAMAGING
ARTICLES IN THE GUARDIAN
NEWSPAPER, EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS
APPARENTLY GONE UNDERGROUND,
LEAVING BEHIND HIM SOME
TROUBLING QUESTIONS.

GUYS,
HAVE YOU A LOT MORE ACCESS TO A
LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF A
NETWORK, BECAUSE YOU'RE MANAGING
IT.

THE CONNECTION WAS MADE.

WHILE THE FBI NOW FOCUSES ON HOW
HE DID WHAT HE CLAIMS TO HAVE
DONE, AND WHETHER HE HAD HELP.

CALLED ON THE CARPET, THE HEAD
OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
SUMMONED TO THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEES TODAY TO EXPLAIN.

SNOWDEN FIRST REACHED OUT
ANONYMOUSLY TO AWARD WINNING
FILMMAKER, LAURA POITRAS AFTER
SEEING HER FILM KUO THE PROGRAM"
ON A NEW YORK WEBSITE, SHE TOLD
SALON.COM.

WIDEN FILED LEGISLATION TO
DECLASSIFY THE FISA PROGRAM, AND
DEMANDED ANSWERS FROM CHIEF
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER JAMES
CLAPPER FOR DENYING RECORDS WERE
COLLECTED.

THE FBI IS SEARCHING FOR SNOWDEN
AND HIS COMPUTER TRAIL.

AND HOW DID A 29-YEAR-OLD
CONTRACTOR COPY SO MANY SECRET
DOCUMENTS?

IN HER BLOG SINCE TAKEN DOWN,
MILLS REFERS TO HIM AS KUO E",
AND TELLS FRIENDS SHE WAS IN A
STATE OF SHOCK OVER HIS SUDDEN
DEPARTURE.

DID HE ACT ALONE?

AND THE GUARDIAN'S GLENN
GREENWALD SAYS MORE LEAKS ARE ON
THE WAY.

TO BUILD A CASE AGAINST HIM.

AND GOOGLE HAS WRITTEN THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL, ASKING FOR
PERMISSION TO MAKE PUBLIC THE
NUMBER OF SECRET COURT ORDERS IT
HAS BEEN FORCED TO COMPLY WITH
FOR DATA, WHICH GOOGLE SAYS WILL
SHOW IT IS FAR LESS THAN THE
REPORTS HAVE CLAIMED.

GUY, AND WHEN
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE I.T.

THE FILM PROFILED A
DISILLUSIONED RETIRED NSA
ANALYST WILLIAM BENNING.

WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TONIGHT ABOUT
THE AMERICANONTRACTOR WHO
EXPOSED THE U.S. SPY PROGRAM MAY
HAVE HAD HELP.

THE GLOBAL MANHUNT FOR EDWARD
SNOWDEN CONTINUES.

WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT
MORE SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS
THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN HEARD
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS AND
MONTHS.
