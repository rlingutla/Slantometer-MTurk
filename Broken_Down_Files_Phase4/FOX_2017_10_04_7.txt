WE SHOULD KNOW THIS FBI
INTERVIEW IN LOS ANGELES COULD
GO FOR SEVERAL MORE HOURS.

YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

INVESTIGATORS ASK HER QUESTIONS.

HOW MANY PEOPLE CAME IN, DOCTOR?

LATER ON WHEN WE GET THE
FEEDBACK OVER THE SATELLITE,
YOU'LL SEE THE PICTURES IN THE
ENTIRETY AND CLARITY.

GO THAT WAY.

EVERYBODY DID AN AMAZING JOB.

A MATT RUSH TO TRY TO GET OUT.

YOU HAVE BEEN A REAL
INSPIRATION.

IN THE INTERVIEW, THEIR FACES
ARE BLURRED TO PROTECT THEIR
IDENTITIES.

JOHN ROBERTS FAMILIAR WITH THIS.

AUTHORITIES ARE WORKING ON
IDENTIFYING THREE OF THEM WHO
DIED ON THAT FATEFUL NIGHT.

YOU CAN SEE THE BREAK-UP.

I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WAS
TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE THAT CHEAPLY
OF TRANSFORMING A SEMIAUTOMATIC
INTO AN AUTOMATIC WEAPON.

MONDAY WHEN ANNOUNCED THAT HE
WAS GOING TO COME, SITTING DOWN
AND TALKING WITH THE THAI PRIME
MINISTER, NOBODY FROM HIS STAFF
NEW THE PRESIDENT PLANNED TO
COME WEDNESDAY.

THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET
INTO A REAL TUSSLE OF A DEBATE
IN CAPITOL HILL.

MANY OF THEM FELL TO THE GROUND
MORE TALLY WOUNDED OR SERIALLY
WOUNDED.

WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW ORDINARY
PEOPLE STEP FORWARD AND BECOME
EXTRAORDINARY INDIVIDUALS OR WE
LEARNED OF THEIR EXTRAORDINARY
FORTITUDE AS THEY HELPED PEOPLE
OUT, STORIES OF PEOPLE PUTTING
FOLKS IN THE BACK OF THEIR
TRUCKS TO TAKE THEM TO
HOSPITALS.

THEY'RE SHOOTING RIGHT AT US,
GUYS.

MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT
ALONE AND GIVES US STRENGTH.
