EVENING, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME
TONIGHT WE HEAR AND SEE THE
MOMENT THAT TORNADO HIT ONE OF
THOSE TWO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

WE'VE DONE IT ONCE ALREADY.

THAT CONVERSATION HAS BEGUN.

SHE TELLS DAVID MUIR HOW THEY
ALL MADE IT OUT.

COMPLETE DARKNESS.

THIS IS THE PLAYGROUND.

BY THE WAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL
VISIT OKLAHOMA THIS WEEKEND, AND
ABC'S DAVID MUIR LEADS OUR
COVERAGE ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH
THAT EXCLUSIVE.

YEAH.

WE'LL COME TOGETHER AND
BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.

THIS IS WHERE WE WALKED DOWN,
AND I WAS RIGHT HERE.

WOW, OH, MY GOD.

PLAYGROUND HERE?

IT'S JUST NOT -- THESE PEOPLE
ARE JUST GOING TO BE TOUGH, GET
UP AND GET IT DONE.

 THIS WEEK WE WATCHED ABC'S
MIKE BOETTCHER, WALK THE STREETS
IN OKLAHOMA, HIS HOME STATE.

[ WIND AND SCREAMING ]
FROM THE TORNADO TOOK HOLD OF
THAT SCHOOL, THAT BATHROOM, FELT
THE AIR PUSHING DOWN.

IT'S ALMOST OVER.

IT'S ALMOST OVER!

WE CAN DO IT AGAIN.

SO MANY STORIES, BUT THAT WAS
TRULY STUNNING.

TEACHER WHO COULD NOT BELIEVE
WHAT SHE WAS SEEING.
