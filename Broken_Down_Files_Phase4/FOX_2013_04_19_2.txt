SUSPECT IS IN THAT BOAT IN
THE BACKYARD AT 57 FRANKLIN
STREET IN WATERTOWN.

SAY IT AGAIN?

A WHOLE ROLL OF FIRE
CRACKERS.

POLICE WANT TO RUSH TO THE
SCENE AND STATE POLICE
WERE, YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE
EVERYBODY WAS BACK.

AND IT'S A VER
VERY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

OUR CORRESPONDENT MIKE
TOBIN IS NEARBY AND ON
SCENE IN WATERTOWN.

WE WERE
QUITE
CLOSE AND THEN THEY JUST
STARTED PUSHING US BACK.

WHAT THESE NEW EXPLOSIONS
ARE, WE DON'T YET KNOW.

THE SUSPECT CONSIDERED
INSIDE THIS BOAT ACCORDING
TO SOURCES.

LAY DOWN IN -- I DIDN'T SEE
ANYBODY GOING BACK.

FAIR, BALANCED AND STILL
UNAFRAID.

BELIEF NOW THAT
THE SECOND SUSPECT IN THE
BOSTON MARATHON SHOOTING IS
DOWN ON THE STREET IN WATER
TOWN MASS.

WE STOPPED, WE RAN OVER
HERE, WE SAW POLICE
FLOODING THE SCENE.

JARED HOLBROOK IF HE IS ON
THE LINE LIKE TO BRING HIM
BACK MORE ABOUT THIS
POTENTIAL HIDING SPOT FOR
THE INDIVIDUAL AND NOW WE
SEE IF YOU LOOK FURTHER ON
DOWN, SOME MORE WELL-ARMED
OFFICIALS.

AND IT APPEARS THAT
SOMETHING IS HAPPENING AT
THIS MOMENT IN WATERTOWN.

WE HEARD A SERIES -- MANY
HERE BELIEVE INCLUDING
MYSELF THAT THERE WERE
GUNSHOTS FIRED.

VERY FLUID SITUATION AS YOU
CAN IMAGINE.

THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO PULL
BACK TO ALLOW A ROBOT TO GO
IN THERE AND TAKE A LOOK
AROUND AND SEE THE SUSPECT
FIRSTHAND AND TRY TO
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT
THERE ANY EXPLOSIVES MAY BE
THERE AS WELL.

THIS IS THE EXACT SAME AREA
THAT WAS CORDONED OFF AND
LOCKED DOWN FOR THE
ENTIRETY OF THE DAY.

AND MARK, I JUST HEARD
FROM A VERY TRUSTWORTHY
STATE SHOTS FIRED AND A
SUSPECT IS DOWN.
