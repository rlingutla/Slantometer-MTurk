AND THEN WITHIN ANOTHER MAYBE 30
SECONDS, ANOTHER EXPLOSION.

I SAW A MAN WHO LOST PART OF HIS
LEG.

ALREADY
ON THE SCENE.

THEY WERE AMONG THE TARGETS.

IT IS VERY FAR FROM NORMAL,
BRIAN.

YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING.

THE IDEA OF USING TWO EXPLOSIVE
DEVICES, THE FIRST CHARGE WHICH
ATTRACTS TO SOME EXTENT THE
FIRST RESPONDERS -- POLICE,
FIRE, MEDICAL -- AND THEN HAVE A
SECOND CHARGE GO OFF THAT'S
TARGETING THOSE RESPONDERS
POTENTIALLY IS THE SIGN OF A
MORE SOPHISTICATED ATTACK.

AND ALL OF THE FOLKS FROM THE
MARATHON WERE TREATING THE
RUNNERS AND HAD TO BE CALLED
INTO ACTION.

THERE WAS A GROUND STOP AT LOGAN
AIRPORT.

BOSTON POLICE SAY THERE WAS NO
SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE WARNING OF
ANY KIND OF ATTACK.

IT IS A POPULAR AREA.

RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE.

AT THIS POINT THEY BELIEVE IT IS
CONFINED TO BOSTON.

ONE OF THOSE, A PERSON IN WHOM
THERE IS SOME INTEREST IS A
YOUNG PERSON WHO WAS HERE ON A
STUDENT VISA.

MORE THAN A HUNDRED WOUNDED.

PUTTING IN PLACE THAT KIND OF
SECURITY AT AN OUTDOOR MARATHON,
BRIAN, WOULD BE A DIFFERENT
MATTER.

TONIGHT AUTHORITIES CONFIRM
THAT THERE WERE TWO BOMBS.

SETTING HERE AND THE RUNNERERS
ARE MAKING THEIR WAY BACK HOME,
BACK TO YOUR HOTELS.

AND THE WORD, OF COURSE, OF
ANOTHER BOMB ELSEWHERE PLACED AT
THE JFK LIBRARY IS APPARENTLY
TURNING OUT NOT TO BE TRUE.

IF THEY HAVE TO GO OUT TO AVOID
LARGE CROWDS.
