POWERFUL WORDS CAME FROM THIS
10-YEAR-OLD A MESSAGE SHE SAID
SHE HAD FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.

HE IS NOW SAFELY BACK ON THE
TURKISH SIDE OF THE BORDER WITH
A LOT MORE ON TODAY'S
FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS.

THE IMAGES OF ENTIRE FAMILIES
DEAD IN THEIR BEDS, HUMAN
SUFFERING THAT WE CAN NEVER
IGNORE OR FORGET.

NOW JALAL'S MOTHER WEEPS FOR ALL
THEIR LOST LOVED ONES.

ONE REASON JOHN KERRY WAS SO
PASSIONATE TODAY, THE SCALE OF
THIS ATTACK AND ITS BRAZEN
QUALITY.

THEY HAVE PENTAGON PLANS ON THE
SHELF FOR A WHILE.

JALAL WAS HIT BY SHRAPNEL AND
WATCHED CLOSE FRIENDS DIE.

DENIES IT EVER USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY
THIS AFTERNOON LAYING OUT THE
CASE FOR A LIKELY U.S. MILITARY
RESPONSE.

THEY'RE SCHEDULED TO LEAVE
SUNDAY.

POSSIBLE TARGETS, SYRIAN
MILITARY FACILITIES AND WEAPONS
SYSTEMS, PLANES AND AIRFIELDS,
COMMAND AND CONTROL BUNKERS, BUT
NOT U.S. OFFICIALS SAY PRESIDENT
ASSAD HIMSELF.

[ SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE ]
OLD HE LOOKS BACK ON WHAT WAS
ONCE A HAPPY CHILDHOOD IN SYRIA.

WHEN WE GET BIGGER, WE ARE GOING
TO WRITE, "OBAMA DIDN'T HELP US"
SHE SAID.

ANN JOINS US FROM AMMAN.

WITH THE MASSIVE NUMBERS AND THE
SHOCKING IMAGES OF CHILDREN
SUFFERING IN AN APPARENT
CHEMICAL ATTACK, THE WAR IN
SYRIA APPEARS TO BE TURNING AN
EMOTIONAL CORNER, CAPTURING THE
ATTENTION OF THE WORLD.

TODAY WE FOUND ONE SMALL SYRIAN
BOY, ONE OF THE ONE MILLION.

SOME WESTERN OFFICIALS BELIEVE
THAT PRESIDENT BASHAR AL ASSAD
PERSONALLY ORDERED THE USE OF
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

THEY WOULD SLAUGHTER THE MEN AND
CUT OFF THEIR FINGERS OR ARMS
AND THROW THEIR BODIES INTO THE
SCHOOLS."

KIDS TO BE LIKE US?

WOULD IT BE LEGAL?
