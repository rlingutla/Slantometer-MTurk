HE IS ALIVE BUT IS HE
REFUSING TO COME OUT.

CERTAIN SOLID A MAJOR
SCENE AS THE DEVELOPMENTS
DEVELOPING RAPIDLY HERE
RIGHT NOW AS WE HAVE LAW
ENFORCEMENT FROM ALL OVER
DESCENDING ON THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD IN WATER TOWN.

AS THE SUN GOES DOWN.

BUT IT IS A FLUID SITUATION
HERE TO SAY THE LEAST.

WE BELIEVE THE SUSPECT IS
SURROUNDED AND IN A BOAT.

VERY DARK IN THE AREA WHERE
THE SHOTS ARE COMING FROM.

WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG HE
HAS BEEN IN THAT BOAT IF
IT'S BEEN ALL DAY SINCE
THIS MORNING WHEN HE
ESCAPED THE GUN FIGHT.

ALTHOUGH THERE VICE
PRESIDENT BEEN MANY OF THEM
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN LONG
DAYS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
THE MENTAL DURESS PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH IN
THIS COMMUNITY AND AROUND.

I UNDERSTAND WE ARE NOW
GETTING INFORMATION THAT
THEY ARE INDEED AND WE
TALKED ABOUT THE
POSSIBILITY OF EXPLOSIVES
GOING TO GET A ROBOT TO GO
IN TOWARDS WHAT JARED
HOLBROOK DESCRIBED EARLIER
AS A BEAT ON A TRAILER IN A
BACKYARD.

IT HAS BEEN STATIONARY
SINCE IT GOT THERE.

THE WATER TOWN POLICE WILL
TELL YOU AND THEY DID TO
THE WORLD TODAY.

BOSTON E.M.S.

NOW ANOTHER STANDOFF AFTER
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE NIGHT
IN WATER TOWN WHEN THESE
TWO SUSPECTS REPORTEDLY IN
A STOLEN OR CAR JACKED CAR
AS POLICE ARE CHASING THEM
AND A GUN FIGHT IS ONGOING.

ACCORDING TO WITNESSES SOME
30 SHOTS FIRED.

THE FACT I
KNOW AND WE CAN'T KNOW.

ON HIS PERSON.

NOW BACK TO WATERTOWN WHERE
THE POLICE ACTIVITY
CONTINUES.

OH MY GOD.

WE CAN'T KNOW YET WHAT THE
REPORTS OF GUNFIRE ARE.

IT'S THE DARK OF NIGHT.
