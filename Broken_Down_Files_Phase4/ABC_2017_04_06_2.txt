PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP HAD LONG
ARGUED AGAINST ACTION IN SYRIA,
REPEATEDLY TWEETING ABOUT IT.

BACK IN 2013, AFTER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK, WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA WAS WEIGHING MILITARY
ACTION, TRUMP TWEETING, "DO NOT
ATTACK SYRIA.

THIS WEEK FROM SYRIA PUT A LIE
TO THE SYRIAN AND USA CLAIMS
THAT THE COUNTRY'S STOCKPILE OF
SARIN GAS AND OTHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

I HAVEN'T, BUT AT SOME POINT I
MAY.

ASSAD'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE IS
UNCERTAIN CLEARLY, AND WITH THE
ACTS HE HAS TAKEN, IT WOULD SEEM
THERE IS NO ROLE FOR HIM TO
GOVERN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.

MARTHA, AS YOU BEEN REPORTING WE
HAVE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS THERE
IN RECENT WEEKS, WE LEARNED OF
HUNDREDS BEING SENT INTO SYRIA.

I THINK WHAT ASSAD DID IS
TERRIBLE.

SECRETARY OF STATE, REX
TILLERSON, A MAN OF FEW WORDS
SINCE TAKING OFFICE, TONIGHT
WITH HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL YET,
FOCUSING ON SYRIA'S PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYING,
"SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN" AFTER
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.

HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED?

HIT SYRIAN AIRFIELDS TO GROUND
ASSAD'S AIR FORCE.

WE DO, DAVID, AND THAT'S A
REAL CONCERN.

BRIAN, WE SHOULD CAUTION, WE
DON'T KNOW ANY ACTION IF ANY AT
ALL IS GOING TO BE TAKEN
TONIGHT.

OBAMA WEIGHED MILITARY ACTION
BEFORE.

DO YOU THINK THAT ASSAD
SHOULD LEAVE POWER IN SYRIA?

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE TARGET?

TONIGHT, HE IS SIGNALING HIS
STANCE HAS CHANGED.

TODAY HE SIGNALED HE'S WEIGHING
MILITARY ACTION.

SIR, DOES ASSAD HAVE TO GO?

AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN
SUPPORTING SYRIAN LEADER BASHAR
AL ASSAD, SAID TODAY SUPPORT FOR
ASSAD NOT UNCONDITIONAL, BUT
URGING CAUTION.
