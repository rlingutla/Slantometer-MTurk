IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

THANK YOU.

THE DANGEROUS WINDS ARE EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE FOR 24 HOURS.

HERE'S A LOOK AT THE STORM FROM
SPACE AS THE CORE MOVES OVER
PUERTO RICO.

IT'S NOT SAFE TO GET OUT OF THE
HOUSES.

IF YOU'RE AN AVERAGE CITIZEN IN
PUERTO RICO RIGHT NOW, YOU MIGHT
NOT HAVE A ROOF.

THEY SAY THE STORM COULD
"DECIMATE" THE ISLAND'S POWER
COMPANY.

IRMA AND WITH MARIA.

FIVE MILLION PUERTO RICANS IN
THE MAINLAND.

RETAINING WALLS AND BUILDINGS
ARE WEAK.

MOST OF THE MODELS MAKE THIS
NORTH WARD TURN HERE.

THE HURRICANE SIDE SWIPED THE
ISLAND.

ALL THE BEST, CONGRESSWOMAN.

YOU PROBABLY HAVE STRUCTURAL
DAMAGE WHEREVER YOU LIVE AND YOU
DEFINITELY DO NOT HAVE
ELECTRICITY.

RIGHT NOW, I'M FINE.

IN
THE MORNING.

WAITING UNTIL THE WINDS GETS
OVER THE ISLAND.

TWO WEEKS AGO, HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDING WITHOUT ELECTRICITY.

MAYBE ON THE OUTER BANKS?

BROCK LONG IN JUST A MOMENT FROM
FEMA.
