TERROR ATTACK AT THE BOSTON
MARATHON.

THAT IS FOR SURE,
OBVIOUSLY.

THERE ARE REPORTS OF
CHILDREN AT SOME OF THE
OTHER HOSPITALS INVOLVED
HERE.

MORE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE
ITSELF?

FIRST RESPONDERS SCRAMBLED
TO GET TO THE SCENE OF THIS
HORROR.

I THINK THE CHANCES OF THAT
LAST POSSIBILITY ARE
PROBABLY PRETTY SLIM AND IT
PROBABLY ONE OF TWO FLAVORS
OF DOMESTIC ATTACK.

THE WHITE HOUSE PUT OUT A
PHOTO OF THAT YOU SEE NEW
LISA MONACO IS THE
PRESIDENT'S NEW HOMELAND
SECURITY VOFER.

THE MAYOR ASKED EVERYBODY
TO STAY HOME IT KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE WITH THIS
SNAPSHOT THEY HAVE DONE
THAT.

WELL, OBVIOUSLY THE
FIRST STEP IS TO CARE FOR
THE INJURED AND TO CARE FOR
THEIR FAMILIES OF THE
CASUALTY TODAY.

AUTHORITIES INITIALLY CAME
OUT AND SAID NO DEFINITELY
NOT TIE TIED TOGETHER BUT
NOW THEY ARE INVESTIGATING
THAT FOR NOW THIS IS AN
ISOLATED EVENT.

YOU HEARD THE FIRST
EXPLOSION.

OFFICIALS WERE TRYING
NECESSARILY TO KEEP US OFF
THE COURSE.

WE HAVE HAD SOME WORD THAT
THE BOMBS MAY HAVE BEEN
PACKED WITH BALL BEARINGS.

FIRST OF ALL EVERYBODY WAS
FINE THERE.

WHAT WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT
HIMSELF HAS BEEN DOING TO
STAY ON TOP OF THIS
INVESTIGATION WAS HE WAS ON
THE PHONE EARLIER WITH
WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR ROBERT
MURIEL.

IN THE VICINITY OF H HAVE
BUILDING OPENED IN 2011
THAT HOUSES OFFICES IN THE
CLASSROOM AND THE REST.

LISTEN.

IS THAT STILL THE CASE?

THIS WILL BE A JOINT NEWS
CONFERENCE AIM THE AGENCIES
INVOLVED.

TELEVISION, CHANNEL 7, THE
NBC STATION IN BOSTON IS
REPORTING THAT AMONG THE
TWO CONFIRMED DEAD IS AN
8-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
