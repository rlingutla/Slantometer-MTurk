THE BATTERING OF HURRICANE MARIA
AND HER 40 INCHES OF RAIN
CAUSING THIS MAJOR DAM'S
FAILURE.

TONIGHT BREAKING
DEVELOPMENTS AS WE COME ON THE
AIR.

U.S.

A LARGE DAM IS BEGINNING TO
FAIL.

WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

DRIVERS LINED UP HERE AS FAR AS
THE EYE CAN SEE TO ACCESS ONE O
TOWERS.

THE GOVERNOR SAYING IT'S TIME TO
GET PEOPLE OUT.

SOME 70,000 PEOPLE ACROSS THE
ISLAND.

TWO TOWNS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE IN DANGER DOWNSTREAM.

THEY SEEM TO SHIFT NIGHT TONIGHT ROB.

THEY ARE BRACING FOR A MAJOR DAM
TO COLLAPSE TELLING TENS OF
THOUSANDS TO SEEK HIGHER GROUND
IMMEDIATELY.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

IT'S GOING TO BE A DANGEROUS
NIGHT AHD DAVID.

COMMUNICATIONS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
ACROSS THE ISLAND.

A FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY IN
EFFECT RIGHT NOW.

HOW LONG DOES A TANK LAST?

CATASTROPHIC FLOODING AND
MUDSLIDES ALREADY.

WHEN WE RETURNED TODAY HELP HAD
NOT ARRIVED.

ELATION WITH KNOWING THERE'S
ENOUGH FUEL TO AT LEAST GET
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

WE'LL STAY ON THAT.
