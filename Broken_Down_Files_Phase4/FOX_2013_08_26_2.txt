WHAT WE SAW IN SYRIA
LAST WEEK SHOULD SHOCK THE
CONSCIENCE OF THE WORLD IT.

IT COULD VERY WELL BE ONE
OF THE OPTIONS THE
PRESIDENT USES JON.

SO, ED, WHAT IS NEXT FOR
THE PRESIDENT ON THIS
ISSUE?

IT IS UNDENIABLE, THAT'S
WHAT SECRETARY OF STATE
JOHN KERRY SAID TODAY ABOUT
LAST WEEK'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK IN SYRIA.

JOHN KERRY SPOKE ABOUT
SYRIA.

THEY FLATLY DECLARED THAT
AND JOHN KERRY WENT ON TO
TO SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT
WANTS TO HAVE
ACCOUNTABI HINTING AT U.S. MILITARY
ACTION.

NOW, WHITE HOUSE
SPOKESMAN JAY CARNEY TODAY
REFUSED TO GET INTO ANY
HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT WHAT'S
THE NEXT MOVE FROM THE
PRESIDENT.

NO INJURIES REPORTED.

THE INDISCRIMINATE
SLAUGHTER OF CIVILIANS, THE
KILLING OF WOMEN AND
CHILDREN AND INNOCENT
BYSTANDERS BIOCHEMICAL
WEAPONS IS IMMORAL
OBSCENITY.

IT DEFIES ANY CODE OF
MORALITY.

PRESIDENT OBAMA BELIEVES
THERE MUST BE
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE
WHO WOULD USE THE WORLD'S
MOST HEINOUS WEAPONS NOW
SYRIA IS THREATENING TO
STRIKE BACK AS UNITED
NATIONS INSPECTORS DODGE
SNIPER FIRE AT THE SCENE OF
A POSSIBLE CHEMICAL ATTACK.

AS WE REPORTED AT THE TOP
OF THIS NEWSCAST, OFFICIALS
SAY THE U.S. NOW HAS FOUR
WARSHIPS OFF THE COAST OF
SYRIA READY TO STRIKE AT A
MOMENT'S NOTICE.

GROUND TROOPS,
BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS.

NOW WE'RE TOLD THAT
GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY, THE
CHAIR OF THE JOINT CHIEFS
HAS PRESENTED THE PRESIDENT
WITH ONE PLAN THAT WOULD
INCLUDE GROUND TROOPS,
COULD INCLUDE HALF A
MILLION U.S.

FOUR U.S. NAVY DESTROYERS
ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SYRIA
TO LAUNCH A MISSILE STRIKE
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

INSTEAD FOR FIVE DAYS THEY
REFUSED INVESTIGATORS TO
THE SITE OF THE ATTACK THAT
WOULD ALLEGEDLY EXONERATE
THEM.

NOW, THERE IS NO
INDICATION AT THIS MOMENT
WHEN THOSE UNITED NATIONS
INSPECTORS MIGHT LEAVE
SYRIA FOR ANYONE READING
THE TEA LEAVES THAT ACT
MIGHT BE ANOTHER IMPENDING
MILITARY ACTION.

IF THE UNITED STATES
STANDS BY AND DOESN'T TAKE
VERY SERIOUS ACTION.

THAT'S RIGHT, JON IT WAS
ONE YEAR AGO THIS MONTH AT
A NEWS CONFERENCE HERE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE THAT THE
PRESIDENT FIRST DREW THAT
RED LINE FAMOUSLY IN TERMS
OF THE USE OF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS BY PRESIDENT ASSAD
IN SYRIA.

THE STILL PHOTOGRAPHS OF
THAT INTERVIEW WERE
RELEASED BY STATE RUN
SYRIAN MEDIA WE CANNOT
INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRM THEM.
