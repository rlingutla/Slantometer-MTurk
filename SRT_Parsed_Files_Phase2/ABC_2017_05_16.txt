INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS,
DURING THEIR MEETING AT THE

OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY.

THE JET COMING IN OVER A
SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

WITNESSES WATCHING THE PLANE

A FIREBALL ERUPTING.

TONIGHT, THE AUDIO, THE CALLS
FROM THE COCKPIT.

LATE TODAY, THE NEW HORROR
THE IMAGES EMERGING FROM SYRIA.

THE U.S. NOW ACCUSING SYRIA OF
EXECUTING THOUSANDS IN AN
ALLEGED CREMATORIUM.

WHAT THE SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL
TONIGHT.

MARTHA RADDATZ STANDING BY WITH
NEW REPORTING.

AND THE TOUR BUS CRASH, MORE
THAN TWO DOZEN STUDENTS AND
ADULTS ON THEIR WAY TO
WASHINGTON, D.C., AND THE
EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

GOOD EVENING.

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
HERE ON A MONDAY NIGHT.

AND WE BEGIN WITH THAT
BOMBSHELL HEADLINE BREAKING LATE
TODAY.

"THE WASHINGTON POST" REPORTING
PRESIDENT TRUMP DISCLOSED HIGHLY
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE
RUSSIANS.

"THE POST" REPORTING THAT THE
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL WAS
REVEALED DURING A MEETING WITH
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR WHILE THEY
VISITED THE WHITE HOUSE LAST
WEEK.

IF TRUE, SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE AISLE TONIGHT SAYING THIS
IS ALARMING.

THE NEWS TRAVELING FAST LATE
TODAY.

LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA, LIVE
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WITH THE
TO YOU.

THIS IS A BOMBSHELL ALLEGATION
THAT HAS ROCKED THE WEST WING.

TONIGHT, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, A
STRONG DENIAL.

I WAS IN THE ROOM, IT DIDN'T
THAT WASHINGTON POST THAT SAYING
DURING LAST WEEK'S OVAL OFFICE
MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP DISCLOSED HIGH
LY CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE.

THE STORY IS FALSE.

AT NO TIME -- AT NO TIME WERE
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES OR METHODS
POST THE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
ABOUT A ISIS PLOT IN SYRIA WAS
GIVE ON THE U.S. BY A PARTNER.

AND IS SO SENSITIVE THAT NOT
EVEN ALLIES HAVE ACCESS TO IT.

THAT OVAL OFFICE MEETING TOOK
PLACE A DAY AFTER THE PRESIDENT
FIRED FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY
IT WAS ALREADY UNDER SCRUTINY
BUT NOW RAISES MORE QUESTIONS.

TONIGHT, THE RESPONSE FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE SWIFT.

SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
WAS IN THE ROOM FOR THAT
MEETING, SAYING, THEY DID NOT
DISCUSS SOURCES, METHODS OF
MILITARY OPERATIONS.

.

NO ONE HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
IS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THE
MAIN ALLEGATION LAID OUT IN THIS
STORY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
REVEALED CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
AND IN DOING SO, HE MAY HAVE
JEOPARDIZED CRITICAL
INTELLIGENCE-SHARING OPERATIONS,
DAVID.

CECILIA VEGA LEADING US OFF.

IN THE MEANTIME THAT
WASHINGTON POST HEADLINE THAT
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN
THAT HIGHLY CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS
RACED ITS WAY TO CAPITOL HILL.

TONIGHT, THEY'RE CALLING IT
TROUBLING AND ONE USING THE WORD
ALARMING.

AND REACTION JUST COMING IN.

RINGING HERE TONIGHT FROM BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE.

THAT'S REALLY SHOCKING AND
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A
LOT MORE WORK FOR US THIS WEEK.

TROUBLING.

I HAVE NO IDEA.

IT'S DISTURBING AND LET'S FIND
OUT THE DETAILS ARE.

THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MARK
WARREN TWEETING, IF TRUE THIS IS
A SLAP IN THE FACE TO THE INTEL
COMMUNITY
RISKING SOURCES AND METHODS IS
INEXCUSABLE, PARTICULARLY WITH
THE RUSSIANS.

THEY'RE ASKING THE INTELLIGENCE
LEADERS TO BRIEF THE COMMITTEE
ON WHAT WAS SHARED WITH THE
RUSSIANS IN THAT MEETING.

MARY, THANK YOU.

OF COURSE ALL THIS MEANTIME AS
PRESIDENT TRUMP LOOKS FOR A NEW
FBI DIRECTOR.

AFTER THAT WARNING TO THE
DIRECTOR HE FIRED, JAMES COMEY,
SAYING COMEY BETTER HOPE THERE
ARE NO TAPES OF THEIR
CONVERSATIONS.

TONIGHT, REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS ARE NOW DEMANDING TO
KNOW, ARE CONVERSATIONS BEING
RECORDED WITH THE PRESIDENT?

AND IF SO, THEY NOW WANT THEM.

HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE
RESPONDING TO THAT, HERE'S OUR
CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT,
JONATHAN KARL.

TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ASKED
ABOUT HIS SEARCH FOR A NEW FBI
DIRECTOR TO REPLACE THE FIRED
JIM COMEY.

MR. PRESIDENT, HOW'S THE
PROCESS OF GOING --
 THANK YOU.

THANK YOU.

ARE YOU SHAKING UP YOUR
STAFF, MR. PRESIDENT?

THANK YOU.

VERY GOOD.

THANK YOU.

MOVING RAPIDLY.

MOVING RAPIDLY, BUT THE WHITE
HOUSE IS DEFYING CONGRESSIONAL
DEMANDS FOR ANSWERS ON WHETHER
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SECRETLY
RECORDING HIS CONVERSATIONS.

LATE LAST WEEK, HE IMPLIED HE
WAS, TAUNTING THE FIRED FBI
DIRECTOR WITH A TWEET, SAYING,
"JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THAT
THERE ARE NO 'TAPES' OF OUR
CONVERSATIONS BEFORE HE STARTS
LEAKING TO THE PRESS!"

IF THERE ARE TAPES AS THE
PRESIDENT HAS SUGGESTED, HE
SHOULD TURN THEM OVER
IMMEDIATELY.

ARE SAYING IF THERE ARE TAPES,
THEY NEED TO BE PRESERVED AND
TURNED OVER.

YOU CAN'T BE CUTE ABOUT
TAPES, IF THERE ARE ANY TAPES OF
THIS CONVERSATION, THEY NEED TO
BE TURNED OVER.

IF, IN FACT, THERE ARE SUCH
RECORDINGS, I THINK THOSE
RECORDINGS WILL BE SUBPOENAED
AND I THINK THEY WILL PROBABLY
HAVE TO TURN THEM OVER.

QUESTIONS ON THIS WHATSOEVER.

IS THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDING
TO COOPERATE WITH THOSE REQUESTS
AND FURNISH THAT INFORMATION AS
REQUESTED IN WRITING?

I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR LAST
WEEK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT.

DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE
PRESIDENT WILL DENY THOSE
REQUESTS?

I SAID I WAS VERY CLEAR THAT
THE PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE NOTHING
FURTHER ON THAT LAST WEEK.

DIRECTOR SEARCH IT'S APPARENTLY
A CROWDED FIELD.

AT LEAST EIGHT CANDIDATES,
INCLUDING SENATOR JOHN CORNYN
AND FORMER CONGRESSMAN ROGERS
HAVE ALREADY BEEN INTERVIEWED.

WITH MORE LIKELY TO COME.

LEADING THE INTERVIEWS, DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN
AND ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF
SESSIONS, A POTENTIALLY AWKWARD
POSITION BECAUSE THE FBI
DIRECTOR WOULD LEAD THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION AND SESSIONS HAS
RECUSED HIMSELF FROM ANYTHING TO
DO WITH THAT.

A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WHO THINK
THAT BECAUSE HE RECUSED HIMSELF
FROM THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION
HE SHOULD NOT BE IN THAT
POSITION.

I THINK THIS IS A PROCESS
THAT'S RUNNING COMPLETELY AS IT
SHOULD.

JONATHAN KARL LIVE WITH US
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

THERE'S ALSO NEWS THIS EVENING
ON TWO KEY FIGURES AND WHETHER
THEY'LL TESTIFY BEFORE THE
SENATE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,
JAMES COMEY HIMSELF AND THE
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL
WHO WROTE THE REVIEW, CITED IN
THE FIRING OF COMEY.

WHO WILL WE HEAR FROM FIRST?

BE BEFORE THE SENATE.

ALL 100 SENATORS ARE INVITED TO
THE BRIEFING.

IT'S A CLOSED BRIEFING, DAVID,
WHICH MEANS WE WON'T ACTUALLY
SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY, AND IT'S
A CONFIDENTIAL BRIEFING.

HE'LL FACE TOUGH QUESTIONS IN
HIS ROLE IN THE FIRING.

AS FOR JAMES COMEY, HIS
ASSOCIATES SAY THAT HE'S WILLING
TO TESTIFY BEFORE OPEN SESSION,
I TALKED TO THE COMMITTEE A FEW
MINUTES AGO, STILL NO WORD
EXACTLY WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN.

JON KARL, OUR THANKS TO YOU.

MEANTIME WE TURN TO THE
SCENE JUST OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY
TONIGHT.

A DEADLY PLANE CRASH, THE
LEARJET APPROACHING TETERBORO
AIRPORT.

WITNESSES SAY IT FLIPPED
UPSIDE-DOWN AS IT FLEW OVER A
SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

SLAMMING INTO AN INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX.

TONIGHT, THE AUDIO IN THOSE
FINAL MOMENTS.

ABC'S LINZIE JANIS IS ON THE
SCENE FOR US.

HARROWING SCENE -- A PLANE
PLUMMETING OUT OF THE SKY,
CRASHING AND ERUPTING INTO A
BALL OF FLAMES.

REQUEST FOR A MUTUAL AID
AMBULANCE IN CARLSTADT SCENE OF
A PLANE CRASH INTO A BUILDING.

LEARJET, LESS THAN ONE MILE FROM
THE RUNWAY AT NEW JERSEY'S
TETERBORO AIRPORT, WHEN
EYEWITNESSES SAY THE PLANE LOST
CONTROL, FLIPPING OVER, AND
SLAMMING INTO THREE BUILDINGS.

IT SKIDDED AFTER IT HIT THE
TOP OF A BUILDING.

AND THEN SKIDDED INTO THE
BUILDING ADJACENT TO IT.

BLOWING UP CARS AND ANYTHING IN
ITS PATH.

OFF FROM PHILADELPHIA, TWO
PILOTS ONBOARD DIED.

FLYING DEBRIS DESTROYING
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.

I JUST HEARD A LOUD BOOM AND
A FLAME GO ACROSS THE WHOLE
FRONT OF OUR BUILDING, ACROSS
SHUT DOWN, PLANES GROUNDED,
WHILE THE FLAMES STILL BURNED.

IT HIT THREE BUILDINGS, THERE
ARE JUST PIECES OF THE PLANE,
LIKE, ALL THROUGHOUT THE YARD.

MELTED CARS THAT WERE PARKED
HERE.

IT'S REALLY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO
DESCRIBE.

TO THE SCENE, A WAREHOUSE
COMPLEX, INCREDIBLY NO ONE ON
THE GROUND INJURED.

AND LINZIE WITH US LIVE FROM
THE SCREEN.

INVESTIGATORS I KNOW ARE LOOKING
INTO THE CAUSE, LINZIE.

YOU WERE TELLING US, ONE FACTORS
THEY'RE EXPLORING ARE REPORTS OF
HIGH WIND GUSTS AROUND THE TIME
OF THE CRASH.

DAVID.

WIND GUSTS UP TO 35 MILES PER
HOUR.

IT'S NOT YET KNOWN IF THEY
PLAYED A ROLE INTO THE CRASH.

INVESTIGATORS FROM THE FAA AND
THE NTSB ARE ON THEIR WAY HERE.

DAVID.

LINZIE, THANK YOU.

NEXT TONIGHT TO THE
HEADLINE -- YET ANOTHER HARROW
EMERGING FROM THE WAR IN SYRIA.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT ACCUSING THE
SYRIA CARRYING OUT MASS
EXECUTIONS.

U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THEY
UNCOVERED THE ATROCITY USING
SATELLITE IMAGES OF A NOTORIOUS
PRISON OUTSIDE  DAMASCUS.

ABC'S MARTHA RADDATZ AT THE
STATE DEPARTMENT TONIGHT.

HORRORS REVEALED IN THESE
SATELLITE IMAGES.

A SECRET CREMATORIUM, BELIEVED
CONSTRUCTED IN THE NOTORIOUS
SEDNAYA PRISON, WHERE AS MANY AS
50 PEOPLE ARE KILLED EVERY DAY.

LOOK AT THE NEARBY BUILDINGS IN
THE COMPLEX, A WHITE BLANKET OF
SNOW COVERS THEM, BUT THE ROOF
OF THIS BUILDING, WITH THE
INTENSE HEAT FROM WITHIN,
SNOW FREE.

THAT IS WHERE THE STATE
DEPARTMENT BELIEVES BODIES ARE
BURNED, TO HIDE EVIDENCE OF AN
ESTIMATED 5,000 TO 15,000
POLITICAL KILLINGS.

THE BUILDING OF A CREMATORIUM
IS AN EFFORT TO COVER UP THE
EXTENT OF MASS MURDERS TAKING
PLACE IN SEDNAYA PRISON.

NO IMAGES EXIST FROM INSIDE,
BUT AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL HAS
RECREATED THE PRISON ITSELF,
BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH THOSE
WHO MANAGED TO SURVIVE THE
CONDITIONS.

"AS WE ARRIVED," SAYS THIS MAN,
"EVERY GUARD GRABBED A DETAINEE
AND STARTED BEATING HIM."

THE U.S. BLAMES ASSAD FOR THE
CREMATORIUM, BUT SAYS RUSSIA AND
IRAN HAVE PLAYED A PART, FOR
SUPPORTING THE REGIME.

A REGIME THE U.S.

ATTACKED LAST
MONTH AFTER EVIDENCE EMERGED IT
USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS TO ATTACK
CIVILIANS.

MARTHA RADDATZ WITH US LIVE
TONIGHT FROM THE STATE
DEPARTMENT.

MARTHA, THIS NEW EVIDENCE COMES
AS THE PRESIDENT PREPARES FOR
HIS FIRST OVERSEAS TRIP TO SAUDI
ARABIA, ISRAEL AND THE VATICAN.

SURELY THESE IMAGES WILL COME
UP.

THAT'S RIGHT.

HE'S GOING OVER TO SAUDI ARABIA.

HE'LL MEET WITH SUNNI LEADERS.

THEY'LL BE SHOWN THESE SATELLITE
IMAGES.

ALL OF THOSE GROUPS ALREADY
DESPISE THE ASSAD REGIME.

THEY'LL BE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THIS
TOUGH STAND AGAINST THEM.

DAVID.

MARTHA, THANK YOU.

AND NOW TO ANOTHER GLOBAL
WORRY AT THIS HOUR.

WE DO HAVE NEW REPORTING IN THE
MASSIVE CYBERATTACK.

HOSPITALS PARALYZED, SURGERIES
HALTED, AND TODAY WE LEARNED OF
AN AUTO ASSEMBLY LINE SUDDENLY
STOPPED BECAUSE COMPUTERS HAD
SHUT DOWN.

HACKERS INFECTING SOME 300,000
COMPUTERS IN MORE THAN 150
COUNTRIES NOW, INCLUDING THE
U.S., LOCKING THOSE COMPANIES UP
THROUGH THEIR COMPUTERS, AND
THEN DEMANDING RANSOM TO FREE
THE FILES.

AND TONIGHT, INVESTIGATORS SAY
NEW CLUES MAY BE POINTING TO A
FAMILIAR CULPRIT.

HERE'S BRIAN ROSS.

RESEARCHERS TRACKING THE ATTACK
TONIGHT, SAY THE TRAIL COULD
LEAD TO NORTH KOREA.

THAT THE COMPUTER CODE THAT
PRODUCED THE ATTACK WITH THESE
OMINOUS MESSAGES, THE CODE USED
BY NORTH KOREA ON ATTACK ON
INTERNATIONAL BANKS LAST YEAR.

IT COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE USING
THE NORTH KOREAN CODE, SAYS
RESEARCHERS.

BUT THE COUNTRY HAS A LONG
RECORD OF COMPUTER CRIMINALITY.

WE HAVE SEEN THEM STEAL MONEY
AND INFORMATION.

WE HAVE SEEN THEM DESTROY
INFORMATION.

ATTRIBUTION OF WHO WAS BEHIND
THE MASSIVE ATTACKS.

AS OF TONIGHT THE TALLY OF
ATTACKS HAS GROWN.

MORE THAN 300,000 IN 150
COUNTRIES.

AUTO PLANTS, OFFICES, RAILROADS
AROUND THE ROAD, AND FEDEX IN
THE U.S.

WERE ALL HIT.

THE MOST DEVASTATING, HOSPITALS
IN GREAT BRITAIN, WHERE
AMBULANCES WERE TURNED AWAY.

CANCER TREATMENTS AND SURGERIES
CANCELLED.

HORRIBLE.

CRIED A LOT.

DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

COMPANIES APPEAR TO HAVE
FOLLOWED THE HACKERS' DIRECTIONS
TO PAY $300 IN RANSOM OR MORE TO
HAVE THEIR FILES FREED, AND
THAT, TOO, TURNED OUT TO BE
SCAM.

IT APPEARS LESS THAN $70,000
HAS BEEN PAID IN RANSOM.

WE'RE NOT AWARE OF PAYMENTS THAT
HAVE LED TO ANY DATA RECOVERY.

BRIAN ROSS WITH US LIVE
TONIGHT.

THOSE ATTACKS ARE STILL COMING
FROM THAT SAME GROUP, BRIAN.

THAT'S RIGHT, THERE WAS A NEW
VARIANT OF THE ATTACK TODAY AND
ANOTHER ONE YESTERDAY, BUT WERE
SHUT DOWN BEFORE THEY SPREAD TOO
FAR.

NEW WAVES OF THIS ATTACK.

WHAT DO YOU DO?

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS
TO DOWNLOAD ANY UPGRADES, THE
FIXES WITH THE PATCHES THAT
BLOCK THIS ATTACK.

USE THOSE AUTOMATIC UPGRADES.

ALL RIGHT, BRIAN, THANK YOU.

TO OTHER NEWS TONIGHT, NORTH
KOREA ALSO CELEBRATING ITS MOST
RECENT MISSILE TEST.

WE HAVE NEW IMAGES OF THAT
TONIGHT, SHOWING KIM JONG-UN
THERE ON SUNDAY.

AS THE MEDIUM-RANGE ROCKET WAS
READIED AND LAUNCHED.

THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF
THIS NEW TYPE OF MISSILE.

POTENTIALLY THEY SAY CAPABLE OF
REACHING U.S.

BASES IN PACIFIC.

AFTERWARD, NORTH KOREA UPPING
THE THREAT, CLAIMING THE MISSILE
COULD BE LOADED WITH A NUCLEAR
WARHEAD.

U.S. OFFICIALS CANNOT CONFIRM
THAT CLAIM TONIGHT.

NEXT, BACK HERE AT HOME, AND
TO AN ACCIDENT ON I-95 IN
MARYLAND, INJURING MORE THAN 20
SCHOOLCHILDREN.

THEIR BUS OVERTURNED ON THEIR
WAY TO WASHINGTON, D.C.
FOR AN EVENT MARKING
INTERNATIONAL POLICE WEEK.

BEHIND THEM ON THE ROAD, ANOTHER
BUS, FULL OF POLICE CADETS WHO
RUSHED IN TO HELP EVERYONE.

HERE'S ABC'S DAVID KERLEY.

TERRIFYINGLY, TURNED UPSIDE
DOWN.

THIS IS A MASS CASUALTY, WITH
AT LEAST 30 PATIENTS.

TOSSED ABOUT.

WHEN THE BUS BEGAN TO FLIP,
SHE HEARD SOME SCREAMING AND
STUFF, BUT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
ALL A DREAM.

BOARD CRITICALLY INJURED.

TWO DOZEN OTHERS NEEDING CARE.

IT RAN ANYWHERE FROM HEAD
INJURIES, BROKEN BONES, MINOR
BRUISES, THINGS LIKE THAT.

ANOTHER BUS, FILLED WITH POLICE
CADETS, WAS NEARBY.

AND THOSE CADETS SPRANG INTO
ACTION, TRYING TO CALM THE
CRYING, INJURED STUDENTS.

I HAVEN'T SEEN IT VERY OFTEN,
BUT I'M VERY GLAD THAT THEY WERE
THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY
HELPFUL.

FROM THE PHILADELPHIA SCHOOL TO
A FIELD TRIP IN D.C.

WHEN A
SMALL SEDAN TRIED TO PASS THE
BUS.

THAT VEHICLE RUNS OFF THE ROAD
AS THE DRIVER CORRECTS, THE CAR
CROSSES THE SOUTHBOUND LANES,
CLIPPING THE FRONT OF THE BUS
SENDING IT INTO AN EMBANKMENT
LINED WITH TREES, AND THROWING
IT, AND THE 30 OCCUPANTS, ON ITS
SIDE.

MANY OF THE INJURED STUDENTS
TREATED AT LOCAL HOSPITALS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN DISCHARGED.

THE DRIVER OF THAT SMALL SEDAN
WHICH APPARENTLY CAUSED THE
ACCIDENT, COULD FACE CHARGES.

DAVID.

DAVID KERLEY WITH US TONIGHT
AS WELL.

THANK YOU, DAVID.

THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE
AHEAD -- WE HAVE NEW
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DEADLY
POLICE SHOOTING OF A TEENAGER.

NEW IMAGES RAISING QUESTIONS AND
THIS MAJOR QUESTION, WAS HE LEFT
THERE FOR SIX HOURS?

THE 15-YEAR-OLD BOY SHOT AND
HANDCUFFED, SEEN LYING ON THE
GROUND.

HIS FAMILY NOW SAYING HIS LIFE
COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.

THE HOME THAT WENT UP IN
FLAMES.

THE FAMILY OF SEVEN THAT DID NOT
SURVIVE.

INVESTIGATORS ARE ON THE SCENE
TONIGHT.

WHAT THEY'RE NOW SAYING.

AND LATER TONIGHT, THE
SKYDIVER JUMPING INTO THE RECORD
BOOKS.

YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW OLD HE IS,
OR BETTER YET, WE SHOULD ASK,
HOW YOUNG IS HE?

STAY TUNED FOR THAT.

MMMM.

MMMM.

STAY TUNED FOR THAT.

NEXT TONIGHT HERE, THE
DEADLY POLICE SHOOTING OF A
TEENAGER IN CONNECTICUT.

A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY, ALLEGEDLY
RAMMING AN OFFICER WITH A STOLEN
CAR.

NOW, A NEW VIDEO SHOWING THE
MOMENTS AFTER POLICE OPENED
FIRE.

HERE'S ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS.

BY A BYSTANDER, ARE RAISING
QUESTIONS TONIGHT.

15-YEAR-OLD JAYSON NEGRON
HANDCUFFED ON THE GROUND WITH
HIS HEAD FACING TO HIS RIGHT.

THE CAMERA PANS OFF AND FOUR
SECONDS LATER, NEGRON'S HEAD IS
IN A DIFFERENT POSITION.

THE VICTIM'S FAMILY SAYS THE
PICTURES SUGGEST NEGRON WAS
STILL ALIVE AND THEY SAY THAT
CONTRADICTS WHAT POLICE TOLD
THEM, THAT NEGRON WAS KILLED
WHEN HE WAS SHOT.

ACCORDING TO BRIDGEPORT,
CONNECTICUT, POLICE, THE OFFICER
SHOT NEGRON AFTER HE REFUSED
ORDERS TO STOP AND HIT THE
OFFICER WITH A STOLEN CAR ON
TUESDAY.

THIS IS A YOUNG MAN, WHO PUT
HIMSELF IN A REALLY BAD
SITUATION AND LOST HIS LIFE.

PASSENGER WAS ALSO SHOT, BUT
SUFFERED NONLIFE-THREATENING
INJURIES.

THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS NEGRON'S
BODY WAS LYING IN THE STREET FOR
ABOUT SIX HOURS AFTER THE
SHOOTING FOR EVIDENCE-GATHERING
REASONS, BUT NEGRON'S FAMILY
MEMBERS SAY THAT POLICE NEVER
PROVIDED HIM MEDICAL ATTENTION
THAT THEY BELIEVE MIGHT HAVE
SAVED HIS LIFE.

HUNDREDS GATHERED LAST WEEK TO
PAY TRIBUTE TO THE TEEN AND
CALL FOR ACTION.

THAT OFFICER IS ON
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE PENDING THE
OUTCOME OF AN INVESTIGATION.

DAVID.

LINSEY DAVIS, THANK YOU.

WHEN WE COME BACK -- THE
POLICE OFFICER'S ACCIDENTAL
OVERDOSE AFTER HE TOUCHED A KIND
OF POWDER.

THEY REVEALED WHAT IT WAS.

AND REMEMBERING THE ACTOR
FAMOUS FOR HIS BAD-GUY ROLES.

AND THEN MORE ON THAT
DEVASTATING FIRE.

THE HOME IN FLAMES.

THE FAMILY OF SEVEN TRAPPED AND
INVESTIGATORS ON THE SCENE.

TO THE "INDEX" AND THE
DEADLY HOUSE FIRE IN AKRON,
OHIO, A MOTHER, FATHER AND FIVE
CHILDREN REPORTEDLY KILLED WHEN
THEIR HOME UP IN FLAMES.

NEIGHBORS FRANTICALLY CALLING
911.

INVESTIGATORS ON THE SCENE.

THE FIRE CHIEF TONIGHT SAYING
HE'S NOT RULING OUT ARSON.

A POLICE OFFICER SUFFERED AN
ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE IN EAST
LIVERPOOL, OHIO, THE OFFICER WAS
SEARCHING FOR DRUGS IN A CAR
USING HIS BARE HAND TO BRUSH
WHITE POWDER OFF HIS SHIRT,
PASSING OUT AN HOUR LATER.

POLICE SAY THAT IT WAS FENTANYL,
A SYNTHETIC OPIOID.

FIVE TIMES AS STRONG AS HEROIN.

IT TOOK FOUR DOSES OF NARCAN TO
REVIVE THE OFFICER.

AND A PASSING TO NOTE
TONIGHT, ACTOR POWERS BOOTHE HAS
DIED.

HE WAS 68.

WHEN WE COME BACK TONIGHT --
THE WORLD WAR II VETERAN, 101
YEARS OLD, AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO
SEE WHAT HE WAS WILLING TO DO.

STAY TUNED.

FINALLY TONIGHT, HE'S BECOME
THE WORLD'S OLDEST SKYDIVER.

THE D-DAY VETERAN PROVING HE'S
FOREVER YOUNG.

ABC'S STEVE OSUNSAMI.

HAPPEN IN THESE NEXT FEW SECONDS
IS A WORLD RECORD.

THIS IS 101-YEAR-OLD VERDUN
HAYES, ABOUT TO BECOME THE
WORLD'S OLDEST SKYDIVER.

FOUR GENERATIONS OF HIS FAMILY
JOINED HIM FOR THE FLIGHT, HE
ONLY NEEDED TO JUMP FROM 10,000
FEET FOR THE RECORD, BUT WENT
FOR 15,000.

HOW YOU FEELING?

ALL RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY OVER
THE MOON!

OH, YES, HOPEFULLY I'LL BE DOING
IT AT 102 OR 103.

PREVIOUS RECORD HOLDER BY 35
DAYS.

I SLEPT VERY WELL INDEED AND
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING THE
HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD.

IN NORMANDY IN 1944.

CLEARLY JUMPING OUT OF PLANES
MAKES HIM FEEL FOREVER YOUNG.

STEVE OSUNSAMI, ABC NEWS,
ATLANTA.

HE'S HOPING TO DO IT WHEN
HE'S 103.

I'M DAVID MUIR, I HOPE TO
SEE YOU RIGHT BACK HERE
TOMORROW.

GOOD NIGHT.
