TONIGHT, A
DEEPENING MYSTERY
AFTER THE MASSACRE
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

WHY DID HE DO IT?

AS WE SEE INSIDE THE
KILLER'S HOTEL ROOM,
CHILLING NEW DETAILS
ON HIS ARSENAL, THE
DEVICE USED TO MODIFY
THE GUNS, HIDDEN
CAMERAS HE SET UP AND
BIG MONEY HE SENT
OVERSEAS SHORTLY
BEFORE COMMITTING MASS
MURDER.

TONIGHT POLICE SAY THE
GIRLFRIEND IA PERSON
OF INTEREST.

WHAT DID SHE KNOW?

ALSO THE HEROS IN THE
CROWD.

SHE WAS CRYING AND
JUST KEEP TALKING TO
HER SO WE KNEW SHE WAS
CONSCIOUS.

I'LL NEVER FORGET HER
FACE, EVER.

EMOTIONAL STORIES
EMERGE.

PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP
IN PUERTO RICO AFTER A
PUBLIC WAR OF WORDS.

AND A ROCK LEGEND
LOST.

TRIBUTES POURING IN
TONIGHT FOR TOM PETTY.

"NIGHTLY NEWS" BEGINS
RIGHT NOW.

VEGAS MASS SHOOTING,
THIS IS "NBC NIGHTLY
NEWS" WITH LESTER
HOLT, REPORTING
TONIGHT FROM LAS
VEGAS.

GOOD EVENING IN A
PLACE STILL
OVERWHELMED WITH THE
SADNESS OF LIVES LOST,
AT LEAST 59 AND MORE
THAN 500 INJURED,
THERE IS ALSO A
GROWING RECOGNITION
AND APPRECIATION OF
THE NUMBER OF LIVES
SAVED.

THERE'S NO TALLY OF
THE HEROES WHO DRAGGED
STRICKEN PEOPLE FROM
LINE OF FIRE, APPLIED
A TURNEKIT OR APPLIED
PRESSURE TO WOUND.

BUT INSPIRING.

LIKE THE PARAMEDIC I
MET WHO RACED TO THE
SCENE SUNDAY NIGHT,
RADIOING AHEAD KNOWING
HIS DAUGHTER WAS
THERE.

TWO OR THREE
MINUTES LATER CAME
BACK AND SAID I HAVE
EYES ON HER, SHE'S
OKAY.

BIGGEST RELIEF OF MY
LIFE.

YOU CAN ONLY
IMAGINE.

HEAR MORE IN A MOMENT
BUT FIRST GETTING
FIRST GLIMPSE IN THE
KILLER'S HOTEL ROOM
TURNED SNIPER'S NEST
IN THE HOTEL BEHIND
ME.

INTRICATE SETUP,
WEAPONS MODIFIED FOR
MAXIMUM KILLING AND
STRATEGICALLY PLACED
CAMERAS.

PETE WILLIAMS WITH
LATE NEW DETAILS.

YELLOW POLICE TAPE
MARKS THE SCENE WHERE
THE RAIN OF GUNFIRE
CAME FROM, STEPHEN
PADDOCK'S 32ND FLOOR
HOTEL ROOM.

VISIBLE THERE ONE OF
THE 22 WEAPONS HE
BROUGHT THERE IN 13
SUITCASES.

HIGH-POWERED SNIPER
RIFLE WITH SCOPE AND
STABILIZING BIPOD.

AUTHORITIES NOW KNOW
WHY HE WAS ABLE TO
SHOOT SO QUICKLY WITH
DEADLY EFFECT.

HE BOUGHT TWO
ATTACHMENTS, SOLID
LEGALLY, THAT ALLOW
CONVENTIONAL ASSAULT
STYLE RIFLES TO BE
FIRED LIKE MACHINE
GUNS.

WE ARE AWARE OF A
DEVICE CALLED A BUMP
STOCK, AND THAT
ENABLES AN INDIVIDUAL
TO SPEED UP THE
DISCHARGE OF
AMMUNITION.

OFFICIALS SAY HE
FIRED MOST OF THE
SHOTS IN THE FIRST
NINE MINUTES OF THE
ATTACK.

SHERIFF ALSO SAYS
PADDOCK STATIONED
CAMERAS IN THE HOTEL
HALLWAY TO WATCH FOR
APPROACHING LAW
ENFORCEMENT.

POLICE ARE TRACING
WHAT HE WAS UP TO
BEFORE CHECKING INTO
THE MANDALAY BAY LAST
THURSDAY.

WEEKEND BEFORE HE
RENTED ROOMS IN HIGH
RISE CONDO BUILDING
OVERLOOKING EVEN
BIGGER OUTDOOR MUSIC
FESTIVAL.

WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A
DRY RUN.

EARLIER HE WIRED
$100,000 TO THE
PHILIPPINES WHERE HIS
GIRLFRIEND MARILOU
DANLEY IS FROM.

TYPICAL GENEROSITY HIS
BROTHER SAID TODAY.

STEVE TOOK CARE OF
THE PEOPLE HE LOVED.

HE HELPED MAKE ME AND
MY FAMILY WEALTHY.

HE'S THE REASON I WAS
ABLE TO RETIRE.

MARILOU DANLEY, A
PERSON OF INTEREST,
RETURNS TO THE U.S.

SHORTLY.

IN THE WEEKS BEFORE
HIS ATTACK, PADDOCK
RACKED UP 16
TRANSACTIONS FOR MORE
THAN $10,000 EACH IN
LAS VEGAS CASINOS.

IN MESQUITE WHERE HE
LIVED, NEIGHBORS SAY
HE WAS INTENSELY
PRIVATE.

I HAD NO IDEA A
LUNATIC LIVED THREE
DOORS DOWN.

MORE IS KNOWN ABOUT
WORK BACKGROUND,
LETTER CARRIER FOR A
YEAR AND A HALF AND
WORKED AS IRS AGENT
BEFORE HE MADE
MILLIONS IN REAL
ESTATE.

POLICE HAVE SEARCHED
HOUSES, CARS AND HOTEL
ROOM BUT NOTHING HAS
TURNED UP TO EXPLAIN
WHY HE TURNED TO MASS
MURDER.

HOPING TO FIND CLUES
ON CELL PHONES AND
COMPUTERS.

LESTER.

AS PETE MENTIONED,
ONE OF THE BIGGEST
QUESTION MARKS IS THE
SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND,
OUT OF THE COUNTRY
WHEN THE MASSACRE
HAPPENED BUT REMAINS A
PERSON OF INTEREST FOR
THE AUTHORITIES WHO
WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
IF ANYTHING SHE KNEW
ABOUT THE DEADLY PLOT.

STEPHANIE GOSK HAS
MORE.

POLICE WERE ON THE
LOOKOUT FOR MARILOU
DANLEY.

WE ARE INTERESTED
IN A COMPANION
TRAVELING WITH HIM.

REALIZED 62-YEAR-OLD
DANLEY WAS NOWHERE
NEAR LAS VEGAS THAT
NIGHT.

WE'VE LOCATED HER
OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH
HER AND BELIEVE HER AT
THIS POINT NOT TO BE
INVOLVED.

FLEW TO THE
PHILIPPINES AROUND
PADDOCK WIRED MONEY TO
BANK IN THAT COUNTRY.

A NEPHEW SPEAKING OUT
TODAY.

SHE WOULD HAVE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN AND
TRAVELS MULTIPLE TIMES
TO THE PHILIPPINES
WHERE SHE WAS BORN.

THIS IS A PHOTO OF HER
WITH PADDOCK IN 2014.

MARRIED FOR MORE THAN
20 YEARS BEFORE
GETTING DIVORCED IN
2015.

AT THE TIME LIVING
WITH PADDOCK IN RENO,
NEVADA, WORKING AT
LOCAL CASINO.

SHE WAS HOSTESS AT
ATLANTIS, STEVE WAS A
BIG FISH THERE.

THEY WERE ADORABLE.

NEXT DOOR.

NEVER SAW THEM
TOGETHER.

I NEVER DID.

WALKED INTO THE
GARAGE, I NOTICED A
LARGE SAFE, HALF THE
SIZE OF A
REFRIGERATOR.

SINCE THIS HAS
HAPPENED WE DREW A
CONCLUSION IT WAS GUNS
ENFORCEMENT NOT
CALLING DANLEY A
SUSPECT BUT REMAINS A
PERSON OF INTEREST.

CRITICAL QUESTION
TONIGHT, DID SHE HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT HE WAS
PLANNING?

ONLY PERSON WHO
LIKELY KNEW DAILY
ROUTINE WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE PERSON HE WAS
LIVING WITH.

THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE
SHE'S ESSENTIAL.

POLICE ARE IN CONTACT
WITH DANLEY AND SENIOR
OFFICIALS TELL US
SHE'S EXPECTED TO
RETURN TOMORROW.

NO INDICATION THAT
PLANS HAVE CHANGED.

LESTER.

THANK YOU
STEPHANIE.

NOT ALL THE FIRST
RESPONDERS SUNDAY
NIGHT WORE UNIFORMS
AND MANY WHO DID WERE
NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT
THEY FACED.

PEOPLE, COPS, FIREMEN,
REGULAR CIVILIANS DID
WHAT THEY HAD TO DO.

VIDEO OF PEOPLE HELPED
INTO THE EMERGENCY
ROOM SPEAKS TO ALL
HANDS EFFORT THAT
GIVES THIS CITY
SOMETHING TO BE PROUD
OF EVEN IN DARK DAYS.

BLOOD-STAINED
BANDAGE, DISCARDED
GLOVE AND TOURNIQUET
BY THE SIDE OF THE
ROAD.

REMINDS YOU OF
NIGHTMARE YOU HAD
WAKING UP.

THESE ARE THE ONES
THAT GOT OUT.

GOT THIS FAR AND
TREATED?

YEAH.

WORKING CONCERT
SECURITY SUNDAY NIGHT.

THERE WAS A POINT
WHERE I WAS BACKSTAGE,
LOOKED OUT AND
EVERYTHING WAS BLACKED
OUT.

AND TO SEE THE CELL
PHONES LIGHT UP, HEAR
THE RINGING, THAT WOKE
ME UP THE FIRST NIGHT.

PEOPLE CALLING TO
CHECK ON LOVED ONES?

CALLS THAT WEREN'T
GOING TO GET ANSWERED.

AS THE TWO MEN TREATED
BADLY WOUNDED AND
HELPED OTHER ESCAPE
OVER THE FENCE, 15
MILES AWAY, PARAMEDIC
BRIAN ROGERS WAS
RACING TO THE SCENE.

DID YOU GET 911
CALL OR DISPATCH ON
YOUR OWN?

ON MY OWN BECAUSE
OF WHAT CAITLYN TOLD
ME.

HIS 22-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER AT THE
CONCERT.

I HID BEHIND A
POWER BOX AND CALLED
DAD THE SECOND I
COULD.

EXACT WORDS WERE
DADDY, THEY'RE
SHOOTING AT ME.

OH, MY GOD.

TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST
WENT OUTSIDE OF
PROTOCOL AND TOLD ONE
OF THE PEOPLE RUNNING
EVENT ITSELF OVER THE
RADIO, YOU FIND MY
DAUGHTER.

I COULDN'T HELP IT.

THE ANSWER CAME
BACK SOON.

THREE OR FOUR
MINUTES LATER, HE SAID
I HAVE EYES ON HER.

SHE'S OKAY.

IT WAS THE BIGGEST
RELIEF OF MY LIFE.

I SAW MY DAD AND
RAN INTO HIS ARMS
CRYING BECAUSE I KNEW
HE WAS OUT THERE.

AND I KNEW HE WAS
TAKING CARE OF
PATIENTS BECAUSE
THAT'S WHO MY DAD IS.

THEN BOTH PRESSED
INTO ACTION TO SAVE
LIVES.

I HAD TO STAND
THERE AND HOLD A
GIRL'S IV BAG AS SHE
WAS CRYING AND JUST
KEEP TALKING TO HER SO
THAT WE KNEW SHE WAS
CONSCIOUS.

I'LL NEVER FORGET HER
FACE, EVER.

MEANTIME DARIUS
HARPER, RETIRED ARMY
COMBAT VETERAN SAYS
HIS TRAINING ONLY WENT
SO FAR.

AT SOME POINT YOU
REALIZE I DON'T HAVE
GEAR TO RESPOND BUT
YOU DO IT ANYWAY.

IT'S WHAT WE DO.

WHAT HE DID WAS NOT
LOST ON HIS
19-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,
WHO WROTE IN A
FACEBOOK POST.

SHE WROTE I COULD
HAVE WOKEN UP THIS
MORNING WITHOUT MY DAD
BUT I DIDN'T.

PRAISE GOD THAT NOT
ONLY IS HE OKAY BUT HE
HELPED TO SAVE MANY
MORE PEOPLE'S LIVES
LAST NIGHT.

THANK YOU FOR
CONTINUING TO LOOK
AFTER OTHERS IN OUR
COUNTRY.

I LOVE YOU.

PRETTY POWERFUL AND
WRITTEN AS A TRIBUTE
TO HER FATHER BUT
COULD BE A TRIBUTE TO
ALL THOSE WHO STEPPED
FORWARD SUNDAY NIGHT
AND PUT THE SAFETY OF
OTHERS IN FRONT OF
THEIR OWN.

AS WE RECOGNIZE THE
INCREDIBLE HEROISM,
ALSO LEARNING MUCH
MORE ABOUT THE 59
PEOPLE KILLED IN THE
TRAGEDY.

ALL BUT THREE ALL
IDENTIFIED BY
AUTHORITIES AND TODAY
A NUMBER OF MOVING
TRIBUTES WERE HELD AS
STAGGERING LOSS SENDS
RIPPLES OF EMOTION
ACROSS THE NATION.

MORE FROM MIGUEL
ALMAGUER.

ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
SONGS OF MOURNING.

ALL TO REMEMBER THE
UNFORGETTABLE,
LIFETIMES LOST IN
INSTANCE.

ANGIE GOMEZ, 20, NEW
JOB AS A NURSING
ASSIST.

BILL WOLF, JR,
WRESTLING COACH IN
PENNSYLVANIA
CELEBRATING WEDDING
ANNIVERSARY.

HEATHER HAD A STORY
BOOK MARRIAGE.

SHE WAS SURGEON, HE
WAS NURSE.

ENDED TOO SOON.

COULDN'T TELL WHERE
THE BULLETS WERE
COMING FROM, HE
GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND
AND RUNNING WITH ME
AND THEN I FELT HIM --
I FELT HIM GET HIT IN
THE BACK.

HUSBAND SONNY SHIELDED
HER, SACRIFICING HIS
LIFE TO SAVE HERS.

HE TOOK CARE OF
OTHER PEOPLE, EVEN AT
SHOOTING LEFT SO MANY
CHILDREN WITHOUT LOVED
ONES.

54-YEAR-OLD TOM DAY
JR., THE BEST DAD SAY
HIS FOUR CHILDREN, WHO
WERE WITH HIM AT THE
CONCERT.

AT 28, CHRISTOPHER
RAIBLE HAD SEEN A
BATTLEFIELD BEFORE,
SERVED IN AFGHANISTAN
AND MISSED BY HIS
MOTHER.

HE'S A VET.

HE HAS A SHIRT WITH A
GUNSHOT THROUGH IT.

SAT ON A LOT OF BOMBS,
NEVER BLEW HIM UP.

32-YEAR-OLD, MICHELLE
VO, BRIGHT SMILE.

NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR DAD
WHO LOVED GOLF.

BROTHER-IN-LAW THE
MOST PATRIOTIC PERSON
YOU EVER MET.

I GUARANTEE YOU HE'S
FULLY COVERED IN RED,
SONNY MELTON'S MOTHER
SHARES THE PAIN,
HEARTBREAK FELT BY A
NATION.

I'LL MISS HIS SMILE
AND I'LL MISS HIM
SAYING I LOVE YOU
MAMA.

DOZENS HOSPITALIZED
TONIGHT IN CRITICAL
CONDITION, STILL
FIGHTING FOR THEIR
LIVES, 59 FAMILIES ARE
PLANNING FUNERALS,
LIVES CUT TRAGICALLY
SHORT BUT CELEBRATED
BY ALL THEY KNEW.

LESTER.

ALL RIGHT.

MIGUEL.

THANK YOU.

TRAGEDY HERE HAS
PLUNGED THIS COUNTRY
BACK INTO MOST HEATED
DEBATES OF OUR TIME,
FIGHT OWN GUN LAWS.

SPECIFICALLY THE
DEVICE USED BY THIS
KILLER TO MODIFY HIS
GUN INTO MACHINE GUN.

SHOULD IT BE LEGAL?

CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT HALLIE
JACKSON TAKES A LOOK.

GUN DEBATE CENTERS ON
PIECE OF PLASTIC LIKE
THIS.

BUMP STOCK AND LAS
VEGAS SHOOTER
PURCHASED TWO BEFORE
THE ATTACK.

ALLOWS A SEMIAUTOMATIC
GUN TO FIRE FASTER
LIKE IN THIS YOUTUBE
DEMO VIDEO.

ALMOST LIKE AN
AUTOMATIC.

THEY'RE LEGAL BUT
CONGRESS MAY
RECONSIDER.

TURN SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS INTO VIRTUALLY
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS,
THAT'S SOMETHING I
THINK WE'LL TAKE A
LOOK AT.

ALL THINGS THAT
MAKE AMERICA SAFER AND
DON'T INFRINGE ON THE
SECOND AMENDMENT,
COUNT ME IN.

YOU THINK IT'S TIME
TO HAVE POLICY DEBATE?

GOOD TIME HAVE A
HEARING.

I WOULD PRAY THAT
NRA DID SOUL SEARCHING
ABOUT THE BUMP STOCKS.

GENERALLY OPPOSES MORE
REGULATIONS ON THINGS
LIKE BUMP STOCKS.

EVEN IF OUTLAWED
AND RESTRICTED, IT'S
DON'T SELL ANY.

DUE TO THE COST OF
THE PART AND INCREASED
COST IN AMMUNITION
WHEN YOU FIRE, NOT
SOMETHING WE
NECESSARILY SEE VERY
OFTEN.

NEW GUN LAWS SEEM
UNLIKELY AND PRESIDENT
IS NOT ENGAGING, AT
LEAST NOT YET.

WE'LL BE TALKING
ABOUT GUN LAWS AS TIME
GOES BY.

SHOW SCHEDULED THIS
WEEKEND NOT FAR FROM
MANDALAY BAY, DEBATE
ABOUT GUNS LOOMS OVER
VEGAS AND BEYOND.

A TIME.

PRESIDENT LEFT PUERTO

SCHEDULE, NO REASON
GIVEN FOR THAT.
