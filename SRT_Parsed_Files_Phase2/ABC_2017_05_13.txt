TONIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
WARNING TO THE FBI DIRECTOR WHO
HE JUST FIRED.

SAYING JAMES COMEY, BETTER HOPE
THAT THERE ARE NO TAPES.

AFTER THE PRESIDENT SAYS THEY
HAD THREE CONVERSATIONS CLEARING
HIM.

IS THAT A THREAT TO THE MAN WHO
WAS HEADING THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION?

AND THE WHITE HOUSE IS ASKED,
ARE CONVERSATIONS BEING
RECORDED?

THEIR ANSWER.

ALSO BREAKING, THE POLICE
CHIEF SHOT AND KILLED.

TWO NURSING HOME EMPLOYEES ALSO
DEAD.

RESIDENTS RACED TO SAFETY.

THE MOTHER'S DAY STORM, THE
NOR'EASTER MOVING UP THE COAST
TONIGHT.

AND THE NEW SURVEILLANCE
FROM INSIDE THE SCHOOL.

THE MOTHER WHO WAS TOLD HER
8-YEAR-OLD BOY FAINTED.

DOES THE VIDEO TELL A DIFFERENT
STORY?

AND HOW LONG WAS HE LEFT THERE,
DAYS LATER, TAKING HIS OWN LIFE.

AND THE DEADLY COLLISION
WITH A BUS.

TRAFFIC HALTED FOR MILES.

AND, BREAKING NOW, THE
MASSIVE, FAST-MOVING U.S. CYBER
ATTACK.

U.S. COMPANIES SHUTTING DOWN
THEIR COMPUTERS.

BRIAN ROSS STANDING BY.

GOOD EVENING, IT'S GREAT TO
HAVE YOU WITH US ON A FRIDAY
NIGHT.

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S MESSAGE FOR FIRED FBI
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETING THAT
JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THERE
ARE NO TAPES OF WHAT THEY SAID.

THE PRESIDENT SAYING COMEY TOLD
HIM HE'S NOT UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

BUT TONIGHT, MAJOR NEW
QUESTIONS.

IS THE WHITE HOUSE RECORDING
CONVERSATIONS?

ARE THERE TAPES?

AND IS THE PRESIDENT THREATENING
THE MAN WHO WAS LEADING THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION?

TONIGHT, HOW THE WHITE HOUSE
ANSWERS.

JONATHAN KARL LEADING US OFF.

AND TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMED
AN APPARENT THREAT AT FORMER FBI
DIRECTOR, JAMES COMEY.

TWEETING, COMEY HAD BETTER HOPE
THERE ARE NO TAPES BEFORE HE
STARTS LEAKING TO THE PRESS.

WAIT A MINUTE, TAPES?

IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TAPING HIS
WHITE HOUSE CONVERSATIONS?

TODAY AFTER THE TWEET, A
NONDENIAL.

WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA THAT YOU
SAID THERE MIGHT BE TAPE
RECORDINGS?

THAT, I CAN'T TALK ABOUT.

I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

ALL I WANT IS FOR COMEY TO BE
HONEST, AND I HOPE HE WILL BE.

AND I'M SURE HE WILL BE, I HOPE.

REVEAL WHETHER COMEY SAID WHAT
THE PRESIDENT CLAIMS HE SAID
ABOUT THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

I SAID, IF IT'S POSSIBLE,
WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW, AM I
UNDER INVESTIGATION?

HE SAID, YOU ARE NOT UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

PRESIDENT WAS THREATENING COMEY.

AND WHETHER ANY RECORDINGS
ACTUALLY EXIST.

DID PRESIDENT TRUMP RECORD
HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH COMEY?

I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT.

THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING
FURTHER TO ADD ON THAT.

ARE THERE RECORDING DEVICES
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR RESIDENCE?

I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO
ADD.

DOES HE THINK IT'S
APPROPRIATE TO THREATEN SOMEONE
LIKE MR. COMEY NOT TO SPEAK?

THAT'S NOT A THREAT.

HE SIMPLY STATED A FACT.

THE TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

I'M MOVING ON.

TO CONFIRM OR DENY WHETHER OR
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE IS BUGGED.

SEAN, DID YOU ASK THE PRESIDENT
IF HE'S INSTALLED LISTENING
DEVICES IN THE WHITE HOUSE?

DID YOU ASK THE PRESIDENT IF HE
INSTALLED LISTENING DEVICES?

SECRET WHITE HOUSE RECORDINGS
ARE NOT UNPRECEDENTED.

KENNEDY AND LBG SECRETLY TAPED
THEIR OVAL OFFICE MEETINGS.

AND SO DID RICHARD NIXON.

NIXON'S TAPES HELPED BRING DOWN
HIS PRESIDENCY, AND NO PRESIDENT
SINCE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
INSTALLING LISTENING DEVICES IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.

JON, THE QUESTION TONIGHT IS,
IS THIS WHITE HOUSE RECORDING
CONVERSATIONS, OR WERE THOSE
JUST WORDS IN A TWEET?

SEAN SPICER REFUSING TO SAY
WHETHER THEY WERE RECORDING
PEOPLE?

STRIKING THAT HE DID NOT KNOCK
DOWN OR DENY THAT THE WHITE
HOUSE AND OVAL OFFICE IS BUGGED.

AND NOW, TWO TOP DEMOCRATS
IN THE HOUSE SAYING THEY WANT TO
SEE ANY TAPES RELATED TO THE
COMEY FIRING.

AND THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE,
WHICH IS LEADING THE
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA, TELLS
ABC NEWS, IF THERE ARE TAPES,
THEY SHOULD BE PRESERVED AND
HANDED OVER.

JON, THANK YOU.

THIS EVENING, JAMES COMEY'S
SIDE OF THE STORY BEGINNING TO
EMERGE.

SOURCES CLOSE TO HIM SAYING HE'S
FURIOUS.

AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE DINNER
BETWEEN THE TWO, COMEY'S CAMP
SAYING THE PRESIDENT ASKED HIM
TO BE LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT.

AND TONIGHT, ONE KEY PLAYER
SAYING COMEY SAID HE WAS
UNCOMFORTABLE GOING INTO THE
DINNER.

PIERRE THOMAS AGAIN TONIGHT.

TWO DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT
STORIES.

ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED SOURCES IN
FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES
COMEY'S CIRCLE SAY, AT THAT
JANUARY DINNER, PRESIDENT TRUMP
ASKED COMEY MORE THAN ONCE
WHETHER HE WOULD BE LOYAL TO
HIM.

OUR SOURCES SAY COMEY ONLY
PROMISED TO BE HONEST.

BUT TODAY, THE PRESIDENT FLATLY
DENIED THAT EVER HAPPENED.

DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?

NO, I DIDN'T.

BUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE A
BE A BAD QUESTION TO ASK.

I THINK LOYALTY TO THE COUNTRY,
TO THE UNITED STATES, IS
IMPORTANT.

IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE
LOYALTY.

NUMBER ONE, NUMBER TWO, I DON'T
KNOW HOW THAT GOT THERE.

BECAUSE I DIDN'T ASK THAT
QUESTION.

ALSO TELL ABC NEWS THEY DO NOT
BELIEVE COMEY TOLD THE PRESIDENT
HE WAS NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION,
AS TRUMP CLAIMED.

HE WANTED TO STAY ON AS FBI
HEAD, AND I SAID I WOULD
CONSIDER IT.

WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

AND WE HAD A NICE DINNER.

AT THAT TIME, HE TOLD ME YOU ARE
NOT UNDER INVESTIGATION, WHICH I
KNEW ANYWAY.

OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES
CLAPPER MET COMEY ON THE DAY OF
THE DINNER, AND SAID COMEY WAS
WORRIED HOW IT WOULD APPEAR.

HE MENTIONED HE HAD BEEN
INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO
HAVE DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT.

AND HE WAS UNEASY WITH THAT.

A SHOWBOATER.

ALL OF THIS GALVANIZING MANY IN
THE FBI RANK AND FILE.

WHO BELIEVE COMEY HAS BEEN
TREATED SHABBILY.

AS FOR A REPLACEMENT, THE SEARCH
BEGINS TOMORROW.

AT LEAST FOUR CANDIDATES HAVE
BEEN INTERVIEWED.

AND WE'RE LEARNING COMEY WILL
NOT TESTIFY ON THE HILL NEXT
WEEK?

DESPITE THE INVITATION TO SPEAK
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS?

BUT THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
SAYS HE BELIEVES COMEY WILL
APPEAR AT THE RIGHT TIME AND
PLACE TO TELL HIS SIDE OF THE
STORY.

DAVID?

THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM HIM AT
SOME POINT.

PIERRE, THANK YOU AS WELL.

AND WE'RE ALSO FOLLOWING A
DEADLY ATTACK AT A NURSING HOME
IN OHIO.

A POLICE CHIEF AND TWO WORKERS
DEAD.

RESIDENTS RACED TO SAFETY.

HERE'S EVA PILGRIM.

OHIO ARE INVESTIGATING WHY THIS
GUNMAN TOOK AIM IN THIS SMALL
VILLAGE.

THERE'S BEEN A SHOOTING IN
THE NURSING HOME.

IS THIS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER
EVENT?

THAT'S AFFIRMATIVE.

A.M., THE SUSPECT OPENING FIRE.

HE APPARENTLY WAS IN A VERY
SMALL WOODS BACK THERE.

AND ACTUALLY TOOK TWO PASSERSBY
AS HOSTAGE.

GETTING AWAY.

BUT THE POLICE CHIEF MOVING IN.

HE HAD THE SHOOTER IN SIGHT.

WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER DOWN.

THE BODY OF THE POLICE CHIEF, A
FATHER OF SIX, WITH A SEVENTH ON
THE WAY.

HE HAD ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB FOR
ABOUT THREE WEEKS.

INSIDE THE NURSING HOME, THE
BODIES OF TWO EMPLOYEES AND THE
GUNMAN.

TONIGHT, A SOLEMN PROCESSION FOR
THE POLICE CHIEF.

THE RESIDENTS ARE ALL OKAY.

TONIGHT, INVESTIGATORS TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT THE MOTIVE OF THE
SHOOTING.

DAVID?

EVA, THANKS.

NEXT, THE MASSIVE MOTHER'S
DAY STORM.

A NOR'EASTER SET TO HIT.

THE SAME SYSTEM PRODUCING TWO
CONFIRMED TORNADOES NEAR BATON
ROUGE.

AND POWERFUL STORMS IN NORTH
CAROLINA.

THOUSANDS WITHOUT POWER.

OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS, THE
NOR'EASTER MOVING UP THE COAST.

WE HAVE THE TRACK OF IT, WHEN IT
WILL HIT, AND WHERE.

STEVE OSUNSAMI TONIGHT.

LOOK AT THAT!

AROUND BATON ROUGE TONIGHT ARE
TRYING TO GET THE LIGHTS TURNED
BACK ON AFTER A TORNADO WITH
WIND SPEEDS OF UP TO 90 MILES AN
HOUR TORE THROUGH THE MORNING
RUSH HOUR.

OH, JEEZ.

PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.

WENT VIRTUALLY UNDETECTED BY
RADAR.

AND WAS A STORM THAT DID NOT
HAVE A WARNING.

LOOK AT THESE CARS FLIPPED
OVER.

ANOTHER TORNADO HIT FURTHER
SOUTH.

THERE'S A TRAMPOLINE.

HANGING IN THE TREE THERE, BLEW
FROM TWO HOUSES OVER.

TEXAS, A LIGHTNING STRIKE SET
THESE CRUDE OIL TANKS ON FIRE.

MORE THAN 100 FAMILIES NEARBY
HAD TO BE FORCED FROM THEIR
HOMES.

THOUSANDS LOST POWER IN RALEIGH
WHEN HIGH WINDS BLEW TREES
THURSDAY NIGHT.

UNBELIEVABLE THAT EITHER ONE
SYSTEM IS NOW MOVING EAST.

AND AT A MINIMUM, COULD BRING
HEAVY RAINS.

STEVE, THANK YOU.

LET'S GET RIGHT TO ROB MARCIANO,
TRACKING IT ALL FOR US.

HEY, ROB.

THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF THE
STORM, THE CLOUDS IN NEW YORK
LOWERING.

AS THE RAIN SHIELD ADVANCES
NORTH.

IT'S ALREADY IN THE MIDATLANTIC,
AND THE SEVERE STORMS IN NEW
ORLEANS TO TALLAHASSEE.

A ROUGH EVENING AHEAD.

THE RAIN WILL BE ROUGH IN D.C.

TOMORROW MORNING.

ALREADY RAINING IN NEW YORK.

IN CHESAPEAKE BAY, YOU'LL SEE
FLOODING.

TOMORROW, COMING DOWN IN NEW
YORK AND HARTFORD.

BOSTON GETS IT ON SUNDAY, AND
WRAPAROUND SHOWERS THROUGH
MOTHER'S DAY.

MOMS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST,
PROVING JUST HOW TOUGH THEY CAN
BE.

DAVID?

STAY SAFE ON THE ROADS THIS
WEEKEND.

ROB, THANK YOU.

WE MOVE ON.

POLICE IN CINCINNATI ARE
REOPENING THE INVESTIGATION INTO
THE DEATH OF AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY.

THE BOY HAD KILLED HIMSELF, BUT
TONIGHT THERE ARE MAJOR
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE THAT.

DID HE REALLY FAINT AT SCHOOL,
OR WAS HE BULLIED?

HERE'S ALEX PEREZ WITH NEW
SURVEILLANCE.

DISTURBING VIDEO, SHOWING
SUSPECTED BULLYING DAYS BEFORE
AN 8-YEAR-OLD TOOK HIS OWN LIFE.

I WAS EXTREMELY SHOCKED TO
FIND OUT THAT IT HAD GOTTEN TO
THIS POINT.

BOY WALKS INTO THE BATHROOM,
SHAKES HANDS WITH ANOTHER
STUDENT, AND THEN APPEARS TO BE
YANKED TO THE FLOOR.

THE OTHER BOY IS SEEN THROWING
HIS ARMS UP.

LITTLE GABE LAYS THERE,
MOTIONLESS, AT LEAST TEN
STUDENTS WALKING PAST.

AFTER THREE MINUTES AND 30
SECONDS, THREE STUDENTS APPEAR
TO TAUNT AND KICK HIM.

THEN, AFTER FOUR MINUTES AND 40
SECONDS, ADULT HELP FINALLY
ARRIVES.

TWO DAYS LATER, THE 8-YEAR-OLD
COMMITTED SUICIDE.

HIS MOTHER SAYS SHE WAS ONLY
TOLD GABE HAD FAINTED, BUT NEVER
ABOUT THE ALLEGED INCIDENT.

IF THE SCHOOL HAD TOLD MOM,
YOUR SON WAS ASSAULTED, SHE
WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY TAKEN HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

SUSPECTED BULLYING AFTER A
DETECTIVE OBTAINED THE VIDEO
FIVE DAYS AFTER THE SUICIDE.

IN A STATEMENT TODAY, THE SCHOOL
SAYS, OUR HEARTS ARE BROKEN WITH
THE LOSS OF THIS CHILD, AND IT'S
OUR FIRM POSITION THAT THE
ALLEGATIONS IN THE MEDIA ARE NOT
SUPPORTED BY THE VIDEO.

POLICE HAVE NOT FILED CHARGES.

THE CORONER'S OFFICE PLANS TO
RE-EXAMINE THE CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING THE BOY'S DEATH.

DAVID?

ALEX, THANK YOU.

AND NEXT TONIGHT HERE, A
DRAMATIC POLICY SHIFT ON CRIME
IN THIS COUNTRY.

ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS
DIRECTING FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TO
PURSUE THE MOST SERIOUS CHARGES
POSSIBLE AGAINST SUSPECTS.

IT REVERSES OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
POLICY THAT ENCOURAGED
PROSECUTORS TO CONSIDER
INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE PRISON
POPULATIONS.

NEXT HERE TONIGHT TO A MAJOR
GLOBAL HEADLINE UNFOLDING AS
WE'RE ON THE AIR TONIGHT.

A MASSIVE CYBER ATTACK UNDER WAY
AT THIS HOUR.

74 COUNTRIES, AND RIGHT HERE IN
THE U.S.

EVEN HOSPITALS AMONG THEIR
TARGETS, COMPUTERS FROZEN,
SURGERIES HALTED.

AND U.S. COMPANIES ARE TAKING
ACTION.

HERE'S BRIAN ROSS.

UNFOLDS TONIGHT, THE FIRST U.S.
COMPANY TO ADMIT BEING TARGETED
IS FEDEX.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ATTACKS
AROUND THE WORLD WERE ANNOUNCED
WITH THIS MESSAGE.

WHOOPS, YOUR IMPORTANT FILES ARE
ENCRYPTED.

WITH A FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE, PAY
YOUR RANSOM OR LOSE YOUR FILES.

THE REASON THIS IS HITTING SO
MANY COMPUTERS AT ONCE, THEY
DISCOVERED A VULNERABILITY IN
THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD, IN
MICROSOFT WINDOWS, AND THEY'RE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT.

THE SINGLE BIGGEST RANSOMWARE
ATTACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE
INTERNET.

IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL ATTACK,
AND A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES AND
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN
AFFECTED.

COMPUTERS OF HOSPITALS.

SOME CANCELLING SURGERIES.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT CAME THAT ALL
THE COMPUTERS WOULD BE DOWN
UNTIL AT LEAST MONDAY.

LACK OF ACCESS TO PATIENT
RECORDS, DOCTORS FEAR LIVES
COULD BE AT RISK.

BRIAN, SOURCES TELLING YOU
OFFICIALS IN THE U.S. ARE
SCRAMBLING TO CONTAIN THIS?

THAT'S RIGHT.

OFFICIALS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS
MET LATE TODAY TO SEE WHAT THEY
CAN DO TO STOP IT.

AND THE IRONY IS, THE ATTACKS
ARE BASED IN PART ON TOOLS
DEVELOPED BY U.S.
INTELLIGENCE TO PENETRATE
ENEMIES, AND NOW THEY ARE BEING
TURNED AGAINST US.

BRIAN, THANK YOU.

A VERY CLOSE ENCOUNTER
BETWEEN U.S. AND RUSSIAN
MILITARY PLANES.

THE U.S. NAVY REPORTING THEY
CAME WITHIN 20 FEET OF EACH
OTHER OVER THE BLACK SEA.

AN AMERICAN PLANE IN
INTERNATIONAL AIRSPACE, WHEN THE
RUSSIAN JET CAME ALONGSIDE IT.

FLYING WINGTIP TO WINGTIP UNTIL
THE U.S.

PLANE CHANGED COURSE.

THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE
AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT"
THIS FRIDAY.

YOU CAN'T MISS AS WE HEAD INTO
THIS MOTHER'S DAY WEEKEND.

WHO IS OUR PERSON OF THE WEEK?

♪
 FINALLY TONIGHT HERE, OUR
PERSON OF THE WEEK.

AND WITH MOTHER'S DAY THIS
WEEKEND, IT WASN'T DIFFICULT
MAKING OUR CHOICE.

TONIGHT, THE STORY OF THREE BOYS
WHO WERE DEALT UNSPEAKABLE
TRAUMA EARLY IN LIFE, AND THE
YOUNG MOM WHO WANTED TO RAISE
THEM AS HER OWN.

TONIGHT, MEET OUR PERSON OF THE
WEEK.

IT'S THE DINNER HOUR, AND THIS
MOM, LIKE SO MANY, HAS HER HANDS
FULL.

VERONICA BLACK, AND HER FOUR
BOYS.

A DETERMINED SINGLE MOM, WITH
HER OWN SON, SHE CHOSE TO ADOPT
THREE MORE.

FOSTERING THEM FIRST.

I WAS SHOCKED.

I WAS SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF
CHILDREN THAT WERE IN CARE.

AND THE ISSUES AND THE TRAUMA
THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED.

FOSTERING TEN YEARS AGO.

TAKING IN HER OLDER SON, HE WAS
JUST 6 AT THE TIME.

HE HAD LIVED IN SEVEN DIFFERENT
HOMES.

ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS BELONG
AND BE PART OF A FAMILY.

FOSTER AND ADOPT TWO MORE.

THERE THEY ARE ON THE DAY THEY
WERE ALSO GOING TO JOIN HER
FAMILY.

HERE'S THE MOMENT IN COURT WHEN
SHE OFFICIALLY ADOPTS THEM.

IT'S GOING TO BE OFFICIAL,
OKAY?

[ APPLAUSE ]
OUR PARENT COMPANY DISNEY,
SUPPORTING FOSTER CARE MONTH,
PARTNERING WITH FOSTER MORE.

AND TONIGHT, ON THIS MOTHER'S
DAY WEEKEND, THE BOYS WITH A
MESSAGE FOR THEIR MOM.

THE SUPPORT AND LOVE THAT
COMES FROM FAMILY, WHICH IS VERY
MEANINGFUL, I CAN'T ASK FOR A
BETTER ONE.

IT'S ALMOST LIKE LIVING IN A
DREAM, EVERY DAY, WITH THESE
GUYS.

IT'S JUST SPECIAL.

IT'S GREAT THAT I HAVE
FINALLY SOMEONE, A FAMILY TO
HAVE FOREVER, AND NOT BOUNCING
AROUND.

SHE'S REALLY SPECIAL.

SHE WAS THE ONE WHO DIDN'T GIVE
UP ON US TO ADOPT US INSTEAD OF
WHO SAW CHILDREN IN NEED AND
MADE THEM HER OWN.

THEY'RE AT HOME, SETTLED,
THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE SAFE, AND
WE ARE A FAMILY.

AND SO WE CHOOSE VERONICA
BLACK, AND ALL THE MOMS AND
STEPMOMS ON THIS MOTHER'S DAY
WEEKEND.

I'M DAVID MUIR.

I HOPE TO SEE YOU ON MONDAY.

HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, MOM.

GOOD NIGHT.
