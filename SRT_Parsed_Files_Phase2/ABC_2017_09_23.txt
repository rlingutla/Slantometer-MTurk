NOW PROMISING AN H-BOMB IN THE
PACIFIC.

AND BREAKING NOW, THE
HOSTAGE SITUATION UNFOLDING AT
THIS HOUR INSIDE A BANK.

SEVERAL REPORTEDLY TRAPPED
INSIDE.

GOOD EVENING.

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

WE BEGIN WITH THE URGENT
HEADLINE FROM PUERTO RICO AT
THIS HOUR.

A DAM AT IMMINENT RISK OF
FAILURE, A LIFE-THREATENING
SITUATION.

A MASS EVACUATION UNDER WAY.

SOME 70,000 PEOPLE ACROSS THE
ISLAND.

CATASTROPHIC FLOODING AND
MUDSLIDES ALREADY.

THE GOVERNOR SAYING IT'S TIME TO
GET PEOPLE OUT.

WE BEGIN WITH ABC'S ROB MARCIANO
ON THE SCENE TO GET TENS OF
THOUSANDS TO HIGHER GROUND.

ROB.

DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING IN PUERTO
RICO.

A LARGE DAM IS BEGINNING TO
FAIL.

TWO TOWNS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE IN DANGER DOWNSTREAM.

A FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY IN
EFFECT RIGHT NOW.

OFFICIALS URGING PEOPLE TO GET
TO HIGH GROUND.

THIS IS A LIFE-THREATENING
SITUATION HAPPENING NOW.

TONIGHT THE NEW EMERGENCY IN
THIS UNFOLDING DISASTER.

THE BATTERING OF HURRICANE MARIA

CAUSING THIS MAJOR DAM'S
FAILURE.

FLASH FLOODING FORCING 70,000

VOICE.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

WE CAN'T LET THEM DIE.

WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

PLEASE.

THURSDAY AS SHE STRUGGLED TO
KEEP 11 NURSING HOME PATIENTS
ALIVE.

THEIR GENERATOR LOW ONUE FL.

I SEE WHEN THAT RUNS OUT --
 WHAT WE GOING TO DO?

WHAT WE GOING TO DO?

SWELTERING CONDITIONS INSIDE.

SOME CLINGING TO LIFE.

WHEN WE RETURNED TODAY HELP HAD
NOT ARRIVED.

THE GENERATOR OUT OF FUEL.

POWER GONE.

IT'S BEEN 20 HOURS SINCE WE
CALLED THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON
HER BEHALF.

CALLING AGAIN TODAY.

WE HAD TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH
AND WE'RE NOT ALONE.

COMMUNICATIONS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE
ACROSS THE ISLAND.

DRIVERS LINED UP HERE AS FAR AS
THE EYE CAN SEE TO ACCESS ONE O
TOWERS.

MARIA HASN'T SEEN OR HEARD FROM
HER MOTHER SINCE BEFORE THE
HURRICANE HIT.

SOME RELIEF KNOWING HER PARENTS
ARE OKAY.

THEN THE SON OF ONE OF HER
PATIENT'S SHOWS UP WITH A DIESEL
THAT THE CARE CENTER DESPERATELY
NEEDS.

HOW LONG DOES A TANK LAST?

EIGHT HOURS.

ELATION WITH KNOWING THERE'S
ENOUGH FUEL TO AT LEAST GET

THE MILITARY VEHICLES TRYING TO
GET PEOPLE OUT RIGHT NOW.

IT'S GOING TO BE A DANGEROUS
NIGHT AHD DAVID.

THE MEANTIME THE POSSIBLE
PATHS FOR HURRICANE MARIA AS IT
MOVES TOWARDS THE EAST COAST.

THEY SEEM TO SHIFT NIGHT TO
NIGHT ROB.

U.S.

THE ALL CLEAR AND NOW
THEY'RE SHIFTING CLOSER TO HOME.

RIGHT NOW IT'S A CAT 3 AND WILL
WEAKEN FARTHER NORTH AND A CAT 1
BY WEDNESDAY.

JUST ABREAST OF
NORTH CAROLINA, THE FORECAST
GETTING CLOSE TO THE U.S. AND
OUR SPAGHETTI MODELS SPREAD OUT.

SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE AND THERE
COULD BE SOME DIRECT IMPACTS
FROM MARIA IN THE U.S.
BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

DAVID.

ROB MARCIANO ON THE GROUND IN
PUERTO RICO AGAIN TONIGHT.

THANK YOU.

TO MEXICO CITY AT THIS HOUR.

DAYS AFTER THAT EARTHQUAKE AND
THE CHEERS ERUPTING AT A FACTORY
THAT CAME DOWN DURING THE
EARTHQUAKE.

ABC'S MATT GUTMAN WITH THE
MOMENT THAT ANOTHER PERSON WAS
FOUND ALIVE.

FLATTENED BUILDINGS THERE ARE
SPIKES OF HOPE.

CHEERS ERUPTING AT THIS
FLATTENED FACTORY WHERE ANOTHER
PERSON WAS FOUND ALIVE.

THOSE RESCUES DANGEROUS AS WE
SAW FIRSTHAND.

DEBRIS CRASHING DOWN AROUND US.

WATCH IT WATCH IT!

MOMENTS LATER OFFICIALS
CLEARING THE SCENE FEARING
ANOTHER COLLAPSE.

WE JOINED THE SEARCH AND RESCUE
TEAM AT THIS PANCAKED OFFICE
BUILDING GEARING UP FOR A GRIM
SEARCH.

FIRE RESCUE TEAMS SAY THAT THOSE
SIX STORIES COLLAPSED SO DENSELY
THAT THERE'S NO VOID SPACE AND
CONCERN IS NOBODY COULD HAVE
SURVIVED.

AND YARDS FROM THE RUBBLE THE
FAMILIES OF THE DOZEN OR SO
MISSING PRAYED.

IT WAS AFTER THOSE PRAYERS THAT
WE MET FABIOLA.

HER BROTHER IS IN THAT BUILDING.

SHE SHOWED US AROUND THE
IMPROVISED TENT WHERE FAMILIES
HAD BEEN LIVING FOR THE PAST
FOUR DAYS.

THEY'RE ALL THERE.

COUSINS, SIBLINGS, FRIENDS.

AND THEN THAT CALL FOR SILENCIO,
SILENCE.

SHH.

SILENCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY
TRY TO LISTEN TO SOMETHING IN
THE RUBBLE.

THESE ARE THE MOMENTS OF HOPE.

SHE TOLD US THEY NEED TO SHOW
STRENGTH.

BUT AFTER FOUR DAYS EVEN IRON
WILL CAN SNAP.

♪ SHE SAYS HER BROTHER IS VERY
STRONG.

♪
THIS BUILDING A SALUTE TO THE
MEXICAN NATIONAL ANTHEM.

AND MATT FROM MEXICO CITY.

THE SCENE OF THAT APARTMENT
BUILDING AND MATT YOU'RE HEARING
THEY'RE BRINGING IN A CRANE TO
LIFT UP SECTIONS OF THE
BUILDING?

THE CRANE IS GOING TO LIFT
LAYERS OF THAT BUILDING WHERE
YOU SEE THAT SWARM OF RESCUERS.

WHICH IS A SIGN THAT THIS COULD
TURN FROM A RESCUE OPERATION TO
A RECOVERY OPERATION.

FOR DAYS WE HAVE BEEN ASKING
MEXICAN OFFICIALS FOR THE LIST
OF THE MISSING BUT IN THE SCOPE
OF THIS DEVASTATION THEY SAY
THEY STILL DON'T HAVE ONE.

DAVID.

MATT GUTMAN ON THE SCENE.

THANK YOU.

THE MAJOR HEADLINE, A MAJOR BLOW
IN THE NEW EFFORT TO KILL
OBAMACARE AND IT COMES FROM THE
SAME SENATOR WHO KILLED THE
REPEAL THE LAST TIME.

SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN DECLARING HE
WILL VOTE NO.

MARY BRUCE WITH THE TWO KEY
SENATORS WHO WILL BREAK OR MAKE
THIS REPEAL.

WHERE DO THEY STAND TONIGHT.

EIGHT WEEKS SINCE THE COUNTRY
WATCHED JOHN MCCAIN WALK ONTO
THE SENATE FLOOR, SHOCKING HIS
OWN PARTY, WITH THIS DEFIANT
THUMBS DOWN.

[ GASPS ]
DELIVERING THE FINAL BLOW TO THE
PRESIDENT'S ATTEMPT TO REPEAL
AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.

TONIGHT, WITH ONE MORE CHANCE AT
A REPEAL BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S
DEADLINE, JOHN MCCAIN STUNNING
THE PARTY AGAIN.

ANNOUNCING TODAY, "I CANNOT IN
GOOD CONSCIENCE VOTE FOR" THE
LATEST REPUBLICAN PLAN.

HE SAYS A "BILL OF THIS IMPACT
REQUIRES A BIPARTISAN APPROACH."

MCCAIN MIGHT HAVE JUST KILLED
THIS NEW REPEAL, BECAUSE THEY
CAN ONLY AFFORD TO LOSE TWO
VOTES.

RAND PAUL HAS ALREADY SAID NO.

AND MCCAIN DID THIS, EVEN THOUGH
HIS OWN BEST FRIEND IN THE
SENATE, LINDSEY GRAHAM IS ONE OF
THE ARCHITECTS.

I DON'T EXPECT HIM TO VOTE
HIM TO VOTE FOR WHAT'S BEST FOR
THE COUNTRY.

STATES MORE FLEXIBILITY TO CRAFT
THEIR OWN HEALTH COVERAGE, BUT
WITH FAR LESS FEDERAL FUNDING.

AND WITH NO GUARANTEE OF HOW
THEY WOULD COVER AMERICANS WITH
PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS.

EXPERTS SAY IT COULD LEAVE
MILLIONS MORE WITHOUT INSURANCE.

ALL EYES NOW ON TWO KEY
SENATORS.

SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS OF MAINE,
AND LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA.

COLLINS TONIGHT IS LEANING NO.

I JUST HAVE TO DO WHAT'S
RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF MAINE AND
OUR COUNTRY, AND IF I DON'T DO
THAT I CAN'T LOOK AT MYSELF IN
THE MIRROR.

MURKOWSKI'S OFFICE PROTESTERS
CAMPED OUT URGING HER TO PROTEST
THIS BILL LIKE SHE DID THE LAST
TIME.

I SAID IN JANUARY WE SHOULD
NOT REPEAL WITHOUT A
REPLACEMENT.

JUST AN INDEFINITE HOLD ON THIS
JUST CREATES MORE CHAOS AND
CONFUSION.

MARY BRUCE BACK WITH US FROM
WASHINGTON.

AND JIMMY KIMMEL WHOSE OWN BABY
BOY
NEEDS SEVERAL OPERATIONS, AND
FOUGHT FOR OTHER FAMILIES TO
HAVE COVERAGE IF THEY'RE IN THE
SAME SITUATION.

HE TWEETED SENATOR MCCAIN.

KIMMEL WITH A TWEET OF PRAISE
SAYING THANK YOU JOHN MCCAIN FOR
BEING A HERO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND
NOW AGAIN.

AND JOHN MCCAIN'S WIFE RESPONDED
TWEETING THANK YOU FOR THE KIND
WORDS ABOUT MY HUSBAND AND GOD
BLESS YOUR SWEET BABY.

DAVID.

AS WE HEAD INTO THE WEEKEND,
MARY THANK YOU AGAIN.

MEANTIME NEXT TO THE NEW THREAT
FROM NORTH KOREA.

KIM JONG-UN SAYING PRESIDENT
TRUMP WILL QUOTE, PAY DEARLY FOR
HIS SPEECH AT THE U.N.
AND NORTH KOREA WARNING OF THE
BIGGEST EVER HYDROGEN BOMB TEST
IN THE PACIFIC.

HERE'S MARTHA RADDATZ TONIGHT.

TONIGHT A DRAMATIC ESCALATION
OF TENSIONS.

NORTH KOREA NOW THREATENING TO
TEST A HYDROGEN BOMB ABOVE THE
PACIFIC OCEAN.

THEIR RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

THE UNITED STATES HAS GREAT
STRENGTH AND PATIENCE, BUT IF IT
IS FORCED TO DEFEND ITSELF OR
ITS ALLIES, WE WILL HAVE NO OIC
NORTH KOREA.

PRESIDENT'S HEATED LANGUAGE HAS
SO FAR FAILED TO STOP KIM.

3 MISSILE TESTS AND AN
UNDERGROUND H-BOMB TEST SINCE
TRUMP WARNED OF FIRE AND FURY.

BUT DETONATING A NUCLEAR BOMB
OVER THE PACIFIC WOULD BE KIM'S
MOST PROVOCATIVE MOVE YET.

A HYDROGEN BOMB, A THERMO
NUCLEAR WEAPON IS GOING TO HAVE
A LOT OF RADIATION.

IF IT HITS THE WATER, THERE IS
GOING TO BE CONTAMINATION FOR
HUNDREDS OF MILES AROUND.

CONTINUED TO PRESS SECRETARY OF
STATE REX TILLERSON ABOUT THE US
RESPONSE.

BUT IF WE SEE THIS DETONATION
OF AN H-BOMB IN THE PACIFIC,
WHAT WILL THE U.S. DO?

WELL, WE WILL CONTINUE OUR
EFFORTS IN THE DIPLOMATIC ARENA
BUT ALL OUR MILITARY OPTIONS, AS
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, ARE ON
THE TABLE.

THEMSELVES, TRADING A VOLLEY OF
INSULTS.

RESPONDING DIRECTLY TO TRUMP,
CALLING HIM "MENTALLY DERANGED."

THE PRESIDENT BRANDING THE NORTH
KOREAN DICTATOR "A MADMAN" WHO
"WILL BE TESTED LIKE NEVER
BEFORE."

MARTHA YOU AND I HAVE BOTH
BEEN TALKING TO COLONEL STEVE
GANYARD AND HE MAKES THE POINTER
EVERYTHING THEY SAID THEY WOULD
DO AND NOW THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT TESTING A HYDROGEN BAUM IN
THE PACIFIC.

DO THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO
TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB AND AN
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
MISSILE.

WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHETHER
THEY COULD ARM AN ICBM WITH A
BOMB BUT THIS HAS TO BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY.

THIS WOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARILY
ALARMING AND DANGEROUS MOVE AND
THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE TO
RETHINK WHAT IT IS DOING.

ALL RIGHT.

MARTHA RADDATZ TRACKING THE
SITUATION WITH NORTH KOREA EVER
STEP OF THE WAY.

THANK YOU MARTHA.

PRESIDENT TRUMP RESPONDING
TONIGHT AFTER FACEBOOK REVEALED
THOUSANDS OF ADS WERE BOUGHT BY
RUSSIAN AGENTS DURING THE
ELECTION, ADS THAT PRAISED
DONALD TRUMP OR ATTACKED HILLARY
CLINTON.

MARK ZUCKERBERG SAYING HE WILL
TURN THOSE ADS OVER TO CONGRESS.

TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETING
THE RUSSIA HOAX CONTINUES, NOW
ITS ADS ON FACEBOOK.

TAXPAYER MONEY SPENT ON FLIGHTS
ON PRIVATE JETS.

ANOTHER CABINET SECRETARY UNDER
SCRUTINY FOR HIS TRAVEL HABITS.

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CHIEF
TOM PRICE TAKING PRIVATE JETS
DOZENS OF TIMES FROM D.C. TO
PHILADELPHIA.

CECELIA VEGA WITH THE PRICE TAG.

HOW MUCH YOU HAVE SPENT ALREADY.

SECRETARY TOM PRICE UNDER
INVESTIGATION FOR DOZENS OF
OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT TRIPS ON
LUXURY PRIVATE PLANES.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO
KNOW THAT THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE
BEING SPENT WISELY.

PRICE ONCE TWEETED "CONGRESS
DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE PRIVATE
JETS."

BUT NOW ACCORDING TO POLITICO,
HIS PENCHANT FOR PRIVATE PLANES
HAS COST TAXPAYERS MORE THAN
$300,000.

LAST WEEK ALONE, ON A LUXURY JET
LIKE THIS, HE TOOK FIVE FLIGHTS.

ONE OF THEM, A SHORT 30 MINUTE
ROUND TRIP TO PHILADELPHIA.

THE COST, $10,000.

COMPARED TO ABOUT $700 FOR A
COMMERCIAL FLIGHT.

IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT, IT'S
JUST NOT RIGHT.

LETTER, THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TELLS
PRICE, "THE AMOUNT OF TAXPAYER
FUNDS YOU SPENT ON JUST ONE
SINGLE FLIGHT IS MORE THAN SOME
OF MY CONSTITUENTS MAKE IN A
.

"AR
 I JUST SAY TO THE SECRETARY,
MR. SECRETARY YOU CAN DO BETTER
AND YOU NEED TO SET THE EXAMPLE
FOR THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION.

TRUMP CABINET SECRETARIES NOW
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR
EXPENSIVE TRAVEL ON THE PUBLIC
DIME.

TONIGHT, ABC NEWS HAS LEARNED
THAT AFTER ONE MEETING WITH THE
PRESIDENT AT TRUMP TOWER,
TREASURY SECRETARY STEVE MNUCHIN
FLEW BACK TO WASHINGTON ON AN
AIR FORCE JET, COSTING TAXPAYERS
AT LEAST $25,000.

AN OFFICIAL TRIP ON A GOVERNMENT
JET TRIP TO KENTUCKY, WHERE
MNUCHIN AND HIS WIFE VIEWED THE
ECLIPSE IS ALSO UNDER REVIEW.

ON TOP OF MNUCHIN'S REQUEST TO
HAVE A GOVERNMENT PLANE FLY HIM
AND HIS WIFE TO THEIR HONEYMOON
OVERSEAS, A REQUEST HE
ULTIMATE WITHDREW.

CECELIA VEGA, SECRETARY
PRICE, SECRETARY MNUCHIN BOTH
UNDER SCRUTINY.

HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING TONIGHT?

SAYS THEY WELCOME THIS
INVESTIGATION.

PRICE'S OFFICE SAYS HE USES THE
PRIVATE PLANES IN ORDER TO
ACCOMMODATE HIS DEMANDING
SCHEDULE.

THEY SAY HE HAS TAKEN COMMERCIAL
FLIGHTS BUT YOU HEARD THE
DEMOCRATS.

THEY ARE CALLINGS HI TA
MILLIONAIRE MIND-SET TOO COMMON
IN THIS ADMINISTRATION.

CECELIA VEGA THANK YOU.

STILL MUCH MORE AHEAD THIS
FRIDAY.

THE MAJOR AMERICAN COMPANY

BATTLE FOR YOUR GROCERY DOLLARS,
WALMART TAKING THE CONVENIENCE

THE DRIVER ENTERS A ONE-TIME

HOME.

PLACE AN ORDER ONLINE AND
WALMART'S DELIVERY PERSON CAN
USE A ONE-TIME CODE TO GAIN
ENTRY TO YOUR HOME, EVEN STOCK
YOUR FRIDGE, ALL WHILE YOU'RE
WATCHING IN REALTIME ON YOUR
SMARTPHONE.

I THINK FOR YOUNGER FOLKS
WORKING AND PUTTING IN ALL KINDS
OF HOURS AND HAVING A LARGE
COMMUTE IT'S A TREMENDOUS IDEA.

QUESTIONS, TOO.

NOT SO SURE ABOUT THEM COMING
IN MY HOME WHEN I'M NOT THERE.

THIS IS ONE MORE STEP IN THE
MAJOR COMPETITION BETWEEN
WALMART AND AMAZON.

BOTH RETAILERS DUELING TO
INCREASE CONVENIENCE AND OF
COURSE, PROFITS, TOO.

DAVID.

REBECCA, THANK YOU.
