AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE GLOBE
AND HERE AT HOME.

THE HACKERS DEMANDING A RANSOM.

THE RACE TO STOP THE THREAT.

TRUMP'S TOP COP, THE
PRESIDENT ANNOUNCING A NEW FBI
DIRECTOR IS ON THE WAY.

POTENTIAL CANDIDATES.

SHOWING AUTHORITIES ENTERING A
HOUSE ON FIRE.

THE FRANTIC RUSH TO SAVE THE
RESIDENCE
 AND THE FASHION ICON
TRAGEDY, KIDNAPPERS TARGETING
THE FAMILY OF DESIGNER
CAROLINA HERRERA, THE RUTHLESS
RESULT AFTER A RANSOM WAS PAID.

AND GOOD EVENING.

THANKS FOR JOINING US ON THIS
SATURDAY.

I'M TOM LLAMAS.

WE BEGIN WITH
THE CYBERATTACK ROLLING ACROSS
THE GLOBE.

TARGETING GOVERNMENTS, HOSPITALS
AND MAJOR COMPANIES.

SECURITY EXPERTS RACING TO FIGHT
BACK.

HACKERS STRIKING AROUND 100,
LOOK AT THAT, COUNTRIES
INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S.
LOCKING UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
COMPUTERS, DEMANDING RANSOM TO
FREE THEM UP.

TONIGHT THE COMPUTER WIZ WHO MAY
HAVE STUMBLED ON A WAY TO
DISABLE THE ATTACK AND THE
INTERNATIONAL HUNT TO CATCH THE
CULPRITS BEFORE THEY STRIKE
AGAIN.

ABC'S BRIAN ROSS STARTS US OFF.

VICTIMS TONIGHT INCLUDES FEDEX
AND THE UNITED STATES, RUSSIA
AND RAILROADS, GERMANY AND
FACTORIES AND PHONE COMPANIES
ACROSS EUROPE AND HOSPITALS IN
GREAT BRITAIN WHERE SURGERIES
WERE CANCELLED.

AMBULANCES TURNED AWAY AND LIVES
PUT AT RISK.

IT'S A HEINOUS CRIME.

THIS HACKING BECAUSE THEY'RE
CYBERATTACK TITLED WANT TO CRY
WAS ANNOUNCED WHEN TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF TARGETS
RECEIVED THIS
MESSAGE THAT THEIR COMPUTERS
WERE FROZEN.

OOPS, YOUR IMPORTANT FILES ARE
ENCRYPTED FOLLOWED BY TO PAY A
RANSOM OF $300 OR MORE TO KEEP
THEIR FILES FROM BEING ERASED
PERMANENTLY.

THE REASON THIS IS HITTING SO
MANY COMPUTERS AT ONCE IS THEY
DISCOVERED A VULNERABILITY IN
THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING
SYSTEM IN THE WORLD IN MICROSOFT
WINDOWS AND THEY'RE TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

IT'S ONE THAT MICROSOFT
DELIVERED A SOLUTION FOR BUT A
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T USED IT.

SPREAD TO MORE THAN 100
COUNTRIES IN FIVE CONTINENTS THE
DAMAGE WAS
CONTAINED TODAY FOR THE MOMENT.

WHEN A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN
GREAT BRITAIN STUMBLED ON TO A
KILL SWITCH BASED ON THE WORK OF
THIS COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN
INDIANA WHO TALKED WITH US BY
SKYPE.

ONCE THE KILL SWITCH WAS
ACTIVATED, THE MALWARE WOULD DO
NOTHING.

IT WOULD NOT CARRY OUT ITS
INFECTION OR TAKE FOR RANSOM ALL
THE FILES ON THAT COMPUTER.

INTELLIGENCE AUTHORITIES AROUND
THE WORLD LED BY BRITAIN'S NEW
COMPUTER SECURITY SQUAD WHERE WE
WERE RECENTLY GIVEN RARE ACCESS
ARE WORKING TO TRACK DOWN
WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE.

WITH RUSSIAN ORGANIZED CRIME
CONSIDERED A LEADING SUSPECT.

PEOPLE TRYING TO STEAL MONEY.

THE DIGITAL WORLD GIVES PEOPLE
AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

BELIEVE THE ATTACK WAS CARRIED
OUT WITH THE HELP OF A PROGRAM
FIRST DEVELOPED BY U.S.
INTELLIGENCE TO COMPROMISE THE
COMPUTERS OF TERRORISTS AND
FOREIGN ADVERSARIES.

THEY LOST IT.

SOMEBODY STOLE THE INFORMATION,
PUBLISHED IT ON THE INTERNET AND
NOW IS BEING USED AGAINST
VICTIMS IN THE UNITED STATES AND
ELSEWHERE.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD YOUR
REPORT ABOUT THE KILL SWITCH BUT
THE PROBLEM ISN'T OVER?

U.S. OFFICIALS BELIEVE AMERICAN
COMPANIES DODGED THE BULLET IN
THIS CASE BECAUSE MOST HAD
UPGRADED THEIR COMPUTERS TO
CLOSE THE VULNERABILITY AND THE
QUICK ACTIVATION OF THE KILL
SWITCH.

ALSO HELPED.

OFFICIALS SAY THEY BELIEVE THE
HACKERS ARE PREPARING A SECOND
WAVE OF ATTACKS WITHOUT A KILL
SWITCH THAT COULD COME ANY TIME
SOON TOM.

WHAT'S ADVICE FROM OUR
EXPERTS TO OUR VIEWERS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES?

THE MICROSOFT SYSTEM SHOULD
DOWNLOAD ANY UPGRADES INCLUDING
THE PATCH THAT COVERS THIS
VULNERABILITY.

TOM.

THANKS SO MUCH.

WE MOVE ON TO THE FALLOUT AFTER
THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY.

COMEY EMERGING FROM HIS HOME IN
VIRGINIA FOUR DAYS AFTER SEEN ON
TV THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD LET
HIM GO.

AT THE SAME TIME CANDIDATES WHO
REPLACE HIM LINING UP FOR
INTERVIEWS AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT TONIGHT.

GLORIA RIVIERA STAKING THEM OUT.

SENDING HIS SEARCH FOR A NEW FBI
DIRECTOR INTO OVERDRIVE.

OUTSTANDING PEOPLE THAT ARE
VERY WELL KNOWN.

HIGHEST LEVEL.

SO WE COULD MAKE THE BEST
BE DECIDED BY NEXT WEEK.

EVEN THEN IT'S POSSIBLE.

LEAVING HIS HOME.

SOURCES TELLING ABC NEWS HE IS
FURIOUS AT HOW THE FIRING HAS
BEEN HANDLED.

THIS AS CANDIDATES TO REPLACE
HIM ARRIVING AT THE DEPARTMENT
OF JUSTICE.

WERE YOU ASKED IF YOU COULD
FAITHFULLY SERVE THE PRESIDENT?

NO COMMENT.

INTERVIEWS DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN AND
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS,
SESSIONS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM
INVESTIGATIONS INTO WHETHER THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH
RUSSIA'S MEDDLING IN THE
ELECTION AND TAKING A ROLE IN
CHOOSING WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE
FBI'S CASE.

YOU CANNOT STOP THE MEN AND
WOMEN OF THE FBI FROM DOING THE
RIGHT THING.

CONTRADICTED THE WHITE HOUSE
CLAIM ABOUT THE OUSTED DIRECTOR
IN A HEARING ON CAPITOL HILL.

IS IT ACCURATE THE RANK AND
FILE NO LONGER SUPPORTED
DIRECTOR COMEY.

NO, SIR.

THAT IS NOT ACCURATE.

WAS ASKED ABOUT THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.

REPEATEDLY DISAGREED.

I SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS RUSSIA
THING WITH TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A
MADE-UP STORY.

CALLING FOR A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR
INTO RUSSIA BEFORE ANY VOTE ON
COMEY'S REPLACEMENT.

I WILL VOTE AGAINST ANY
CONFIRMATION OF AN FBI DIRECTOR
UNLESS THERE IS SUPPORT FOR A
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

GLORIA IS LIVE AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT.

TONIGHT A GROUP OF CURRENT AND
FORMER FBI AGENTS PUSHING A
CANDIDATE, A NAME THEY WANT
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CONSIDER.

ASSOCIATION IS ENDORSING MIKE
ROGERS, HE IS SCHEDULED AS THE
FINAL INTERVIEW TODAY.

HE HIMSELF IS A FORMER SPECIAL
AGENT AND A MEMBER OF CONGRESS
AND
IN TERMS OF NEXT STEPS THE WHITE
HOUSE SAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
HIMSELF MEET WITH FINALISTS ONCE
THIS VERY LONG LIST NARROWS.

TOM.

BREAKING NEWS FROM OVERSEAS,
A NEW PROVOCATION FROM NORTH
KOREA.

U.S. OFFICIALS CONFIRM THAT
THEY HAVE CONDUCTED A NEW
MISSILE TEST.

THAT MISSILE STAYING IN THE AIR
400 MILES.

IT IS THE SEVENTH TEST SINCE
DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE.

THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED
ON THE LAUNCH.

PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ADDRESSING
THE GRADUATES AT LIBERTY
UNIVERSITY IN VIRGINIA.

HIS ADVICE TO THE GRADUATES
ABOUT DREAMERS AND CRITICS.

A REMINDER TO HIMSELF AFTER A
TOUGH WEEK IN WASHINGTON.

DAVID WRIGHT THERE TODAY.

PRESIDENT IS DOING HIS BEST TO
TURN THE PAGE ON THE ROUGHEST
WEEK YET.

HOLED UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE
SINCE SUNDAY, A FEW DAYS BEFORE
HE FIRED THE FBI DIRECTOR, TRUMP
WENT TO LIBERTY UNIVERSITY TODAY
TO GIVE THE COMMENCEMENT
ADDRESS.

HIS ADVICE TO THE GRADUATES --
 NO ONE HAS EVER ACHIEVED
ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT WITHOUT A
CHORUS OF CRITICS EXPLAINING WHY
IT CAN'T BE DONE.

OF THE PEP TALK HE'S GIVING
HIMSELF.

RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE
AN OUTSIDER.

EMBRACE THAT LABEL BEING AN
OUTSIDER IS FINE.

EMBRACE THE LABEL BECAUSE IT'S
THE OUTSIDERS WHO CHANGE THE
WORLD.

CLEARLY FRUSTRATED WITH WHITE
HOUSE MESSAGING IN AN INTERVIEW
AIRING TONIGHT ON FOX NEWS, HE
BACKED UP HIS BELEAGUERED
SPOKESMAN ONLY SO MUCH.

HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB BUT
GETS BEAT UP.

WILL HE BE THERE TOMORROW?

HE'S BEEN THERE FROM THE
BEGINNING.

IDEA OF GETTING RID OF THE
BRIEFINGS ALL TOGETHER.

WE DON'T HAVE PRESS
CONFERENCES.

AND WE DO --
 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT?

JUST DON'T HAVE THEM UNLESS I
HAVE THEM EVERY TWO WEEKS AND DO
THEM MYSELF.

WE DON'T HAVE THEM.

I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

LIBERTY UNIVERSITY GAVE TRUMP A
WARM RECEPTION BUT EVEN HERE
SOME DOUBTERS.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS
DECISION TO FIRE THE FBI
DIRECTOR?

I THINK IT WAS SHOCKING AND A
LEVEL OF ARROGANCE THAT I HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

I THINK IT WAS HIGHLY IMPULSIVE.

I WONDER IF HE LISTENS TO HIS
ADVISERS.

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THE
THINGS HE DOES SOMETIMES.

I AGREE WITH HIS CONCEPTS AND
WHAT HE STANDS FOR BUT THE
EXECUTION SEEMS TO BE SOMETIMES
A LITTLE BIT ROOM FOR
IMPROVEMENT.

DAVID, THE PRESIDENT HINTED
THERE MIGHT BE TAPES OF HIS
CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER FBI
DIRECTOR COMEY BUT REFUSED TO
SAY MORE.

ABOUT THE RECORDED CONVERSATIONS
BUT WE KNOW RECORDED
CONVERSATIONS ARE A PART OF
WHITE HOUSE HISTORY?

THERE'S A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT
FOR IT.

ALL THE WAY BACK TO FDR MANY
PRESIDENTS HAVE RECORDED THEIR
MEETINGS WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS
BUT EVER SINCE RICHARD NIXON AND
THOSE WATERGATE TAPES THEY
THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT IT TOM.

TOMORROW MORNING TUNE INTO
"THIS WEEK."

BOMBSHELL FIRING

AFTER HER NEPHEW WAS ABDUCTED,
HELD FOR RANSOM, AND MURDERED.

VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES SAY

HERRERA AND HIS BUSINESS PARTNER
31-YEAR-OLD FABRIZIO MENDOZA
WERE TAKEN HOSTAGE IN CARACAS BY
A GANG THURSDAY NIGHT.

THE PAYMENT, THE TWO WERE FOUND
FRIDAY DEAD INSIDE A TRUCK.

CAROLINA HERRERA POSTING TO
SOCIAL MEDIA.

OUR ONLY HOPE IS THAT THE TRAGIC
ASSASSINATION OF OUR NEPHEW AND
HIS COLLEAGUE WILL SERVE TO
MITIGATE THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE
AND MURDERS COMMITTED AGAINST
OUR YOUTH IN VENEZUELA.

THE ELECTORAL RESULTS MUST BE
RESPECTED.

THE COMMUNIST DICTATORSHIP MUST
GO.

POLITICAL TURMOIL AND GROWING
ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS LED TO
RAMPED CRIME IN THE SOUTH
AMERICAN NATION.

SINCE JANUARY THERE HAVE BEEN
ALMOST 400 KIDNAPPINGS NEARLY AS
