THIS IS "WORLD NEWS,"
TONIGHT DANGER ZONE, MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS FACING A POWER-PACKED
STORM.

TORNADOS ALREADY ON THE GROUND.

A SYSTEM LIKE THE ONE A YEAR AGO
WITH EXPLOSIVE WINDS AND
FLOODING RAIN AND STRETCHING
HUNDREDS OF MILES.

HIGH ANXIETY.

THE DRAMATIC RACE TO SAVE TWO
WINDOW WASHERS AT THE TOP OF A
SKY SCRAPER HAS THE SCAFFOLDING
FOLDS BENEATH THEM.

AIR UNFAIR?

HOW CAN YOUR PLANE TICKET COST
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS MORE THAN
SOMEONE ELSE IN ANOTHER SEAT ON
THE SAME FLIGHT?

GOOD EVENING.

WE BEGIN WITH THE SEVERE STORM
ROLLING ACROSS THE NATION RIGHT
NOW, WEATHER EXPERTS PUTTING OUT
A KIND OF ALL-POINTS BULLETIN.

ONE IN FIVE AMERICANS IN THE
PATH OF WHAT COULD BECOME A
WEATHER PHENOMENON CALLED A
DERECHO, A 240-MILE STRETCH OF
WICKED WIND.

GINGER ZEE IS STANDING WATCH
WITH THE PEOPLE OF CHICAGO RIGHT
NOW.

GINGER?

THE FIRST RUMBLES OF THUNDER AND
SEEING THE LIGHTNING OVER
THE SKYLINE OF CHICAGO.

WE'RE NOT SOMEWHERE RURAL.

TONIGHT MILLIONS IN SOME OF THE
BIGGER CITIES IN THE MIDWEST
INCLUDED IN THIS HIGHEST RISK
ZONE.

ATMOSPHERE IS FULLY CHARGED.

TORNADOS POPPING UP IN IOWA,
SEVERE STORMS IN ILLINOIS AND WE
ARE RIGHT HERE.

I'M JUST LOOKING UP AT THE
ATMOSPHERE REALLY FIRED UP
ALREADY HERE.

JUST OUTSIDE CHICAGO, THE HIGH
RISK ISSUED FOR CITIES LIKE
DAVENPORT, IOWA, ALL THE WAY TO
FORT WAYNE AND INCLUDING
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

A HIGH RISK IS JUST OFF THE
CHARTS.

THAT'S WHEN WE'RE REALLY
SOUNDING THE BELL AS LOUDLY AS
WE CAN TO LET FOLKS KNOW THEY
REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION AND
THEY NEED TO TAKE THIS
SERIOUSLY.

WEATHER SERVICE OUTSIDE CHICAGO
ABUZZ.

WE COULD SEE THOSE
THUNDERSTORMS GATHER TOGETHER
AND COALESCE INTO A SERIES OF
LINES AND SEGMENTS THAT WOULD
PRODUCE DAMAGING WIND GUSTS.

ATMOSPHERE COULD PRODUCE A
DANGEROUS WEATHER PHENOMENON
KNOWN AS A DERECHOES.

ITS CALLING CARD?

OMINOUS SHELF CLOUDS LIKE THESE.

POWERFUL LINES OF STORMS.

WINDS BLASTING UP TO 100 MILES
PER HOUR.

IT TAKES ON A BOW SHAPE BECAUSE
AIR RISES IN STORMS, COOLS, THEN
FALLS BEHIND THEM AND THEN
PUSHES THE FRONT OF THE LINE
OUT.

THEY CAN BE DEADLY AND CERTAINLY
AS DAMAGING AS WEAK TORNADOS.

LAST YEAR'S DERECHO TORE THROUGH
12 STATES, WITH IT BLINDING
DOWNPOURS FROM ILLINOIS TO D.C.,
WINDS GUSTING OVER 100 MILES PER
HOUR AND A HUGE PART OF THE
NATION PEPPERED WITH LIGHTNING.

TREES WERE PLUCKED AND CHUCKED
INTO HOMES AND CARS.

THIS STREET IN OHIO BLANKETED IN
POWER LINES.

IT LEFT $1 BILLION IN DAMAGE AND
KILLED 13 PEOPLE.

I NEED TO SHOW YOU THOSE BIG
AREAS THAT ARE ON ALERT TONIGHT.

SO FROM EASTERN IOWA ALL THE WAY
THROUGH CHICAGO, INTO NORTHWEST
INDIANA AND SOUTHWEST MICHIGAN.

THAT'S THE HIGHEST RISK BUT
THERE'S A BIGGER AREA THAT YOU
SEE HIGHLIGHTED THERE.

IT HAS THE POTENTIAL ALL THE WAY
THROUGH PARTS OF OHIO AND
TOMORROW INTO PARTS OF THE EAST
COAST.

GINGER, I KNOW YOU SAID
PEOPLE SHOULD STAY INDOORS BUT
WHAT IF YOU ARE CAUGHT OUTSIDE?

WE WANT EVERYONE TO BE IN
SHELTER ALWAYS.

IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE, IN YOUR CAR,
YOU WANT TO BE IN YOUR CAR, PUT
YOURSELF THERE AND SEATBELT OF
COURSE, PUT THAT ON, PUT THE
HEAD DOWN, THE FLASHERS ON AND
COVER YOUR HEAD FROM DEBRIS.

IF YOU CAN GET TO SHELTER,
PLEASE DO.

EVERYONE IS WARNED TO DO JUST
THAT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

GINGER ZEE REPORTING AND
STANDING WATCH TONIGHT.

FROM CHICAGO AND THAT STORM
WE HEAD TO COLORADO SPRINGS
WHERE TONIGHT ALL EYES ARE ON
WILDFIRES, HOMES DESTROYED AND
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ON THE
MOVE.

ABC'S CLAYTON SANDELL HAS THE
VERY LATEST FROM THERE.

HOT, DRY WINDS ARE FANNING SEVEN
FIRES, THE WORST BLOWING UP AND
FORCING EVACUATIONS OVER 50
SQUARE MILES.

WALLS OF FLAME FROM THE BLACK
FOREST FIRE NEAR COLORADO
SPRINGS ARE TAKING OUT
MILLION-DOLLAR HOMES.

EVERY HOUSE ON THIS STREET GONE.

WE HAVE AN ASSESSMENT
COMPLETED ON 4 12 HOMES.

92 ARE TOTAL LOSSES.

PEOPLE ORDERED TO LEAVE HAD
LITTLE WARNING --
 I'M JUST COMPLETELY TERRIFIED
AT THIS MOMENT.

FLAMES AND OMINOUS SMOKE.

ONE OF THE WORST FEARS IS
THAT PEOPLE TOOK THEIR CHANCES
AND IT MAY HAVE COST THEM THEIR
LIFE.

90 FRANTIC MINUTES TO DECIDE
WHAT SHE COULD TAKE.

PEOPLE WERE GRABBING PHOTOS
OFF THE WALL, PHOTO ALBUMS.

WHETHER THE HOUSE IS STILL
STANDING, I DON'T KNOW, EVERYONE
SEEMS TO THINK THAT IT'S GONE.

LEARNED HER FAMILY'S HOME FOR
18 YEARS BURNED TO THE GROUND.

THE MINUTE YOU LEAVE YOU
REALIZE THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU
FORGOT.

THREATENED ROYAL GORGE BRIDGE
AND FORCED STATE PRISON
OFFICIALS TO MOVE 900 INMATES
OUT OF THE FIRE'S PATH.

THESE FIRES ARE AGGRAVATED BY
WINDS AND DROUGHT.

DRY BRUSH LIKE THIS IS TURNED
INTO SUPER FUEL.

THE FIRES ARE BAD FOR PEOPLE BUT
ALSO WILDLIFE.

THIS BABY DEER WAS RESCUED BY A
FIREFIGHTER, ONE SMALL ACT AMID
OVERWHELMING DESTRUCTION.

CLAYTON SANDELL, ABC NEWS,
COLORADO SPRINGS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

NOW WE TURN TO THAT MANHUNT,
THE 29-YEAR-OLD GIVING CHASE TO
THE U.S. SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT.

EDWARD SNOWDEN WHO MADE ALL
THOSE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS
PUBLIC EMERGED FOR A SHADOWY
MOMENT BEFORE DISAPPEARING
AGAIN.

HE EVEN HINTED THERE MAY BE MORE
SECRETS TO COME.

HERE'S ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
CORRESPONDENT, BRIAN ROSS.

IT CLEAR HE IS STILL IN HONG
KONG TELLING THE SOUTH CHINA
POST IT IS HERE THAT HE WANTS TO
MAKE HIS LAST STAND TO REVEAL
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS AND
TARGETS WORLDWIDE.

SNOWDEN MAY BE HOLDING A LOT
MORE SECRETS.

HIS LAST POST WAS AT THE NSA,
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
FACILITY IN HAWAII THAT IS A HUB
FOR AMERICAN SPYING AND COMPUTER
HACKING ON CHINA AND NORTH KOREA
AS WELL AS HONG KONG.

IF HE MAKES PUBLIC THE NAMES OF
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OTHERS
WHO ARE TARGETS IT COULD BE FAR
MORE DEVASTATING THAN WHAT HE
HAS DONE SO FAR.

THAT'S THE $64,000 QUESTION
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THE TARGETS
ARE.

IF THAT COMES OUT THEN THERE
WILL BE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO
NATIONAL SECURITY.

THE HEAD OF THE NSA, GENERAL
KEITH ALEXANDER, SAID SNOWDEN
ALREADY HURT THE U.S.
 GREAT HARM HAS ALREADY BEEN
DONE BY OPENING THIS UP.

OUR SECURITY IS JEOPARDIZED.

OTHERS SAID THE 29-YEAR-OLD
SNOWDEN HAD BEEN DISHONEST ABOUT
HIS BACKGROUND AND HIS CLAIMS TO
"THE GUARDIAN" NEWSPAPER THAT
U.S. CITIZENS ARE BEING WIRE
TAPPED.

I, SITTING AT MY DESK, HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO WIRE TAP ANYONE
FROM YOU OR YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A
FEDERAL JUDGE TO EVEN THE
PRESIDENT IF I HAD A PERSONAL
E-MAIL.

FALSE.

I KNOW OF NO WAY TO DO THAT.

THE NSA ACKNOWLEDGED HE WAS
STUNNED THAT A 29-YEAR-OLD
ANALYST WHO DROPPED OUT OF HIGH
SCHOOL IN HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR
COULD HAVE ACCESS TO SO MANY TOP
SECRET DOCUMENTS.

I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS OVER
THAT.

THE ACCESS THAT HE HAD, THE
PROCESS THAT WE DID.

STRONGLY DEFENDED THE NSA'S
SECRET PROGRAMS AS LEGAL,
NECESSARY AND RESPONSIBLE HE
SAID, FOR STOPPING DOZENS OF
TERRORIST EVENTS IN THE U.S. AND
ABROAD.

BRIAN ROSS REPORTING IN AGAIN
TONIGHT.

THANK YOU, BRIAN.

WE HEAD OVERSEAS TO THE
UNCERTAINTY INSIDE AMERICA'S
VITAL ALLY, TURKEY.

WE SHOWED YOU THE VIOLENT
CLASHES BETWEEN PROTESTORS AND
POLICE YESTERDAY.

TODAY THE SCENE CALMER AS THE
PRIME MINISTER ORDERED THE
PROTEST TO END WITHIN 24 HOURS.

DEMONSTRATORS GATHERED AGAIN BUT
POLICE WERE NEARBY AND THERE WAS
NO WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE.

WORD OUT OF SOUTH AFRICA
94-YEAR-OLD NELSON MANDELA
RESPONDING TO TREATMENT
FOLLOWING WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED
AS A DIFFICULT FEW DAYS.

THIS IS HIS FIFTH DAY IN THE
HOSPITAL FOR A LUNG INFECTION.

49 YEARS AGO TODAY BY THE WAY,
MANDELA WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN
PRISON FOR BATTLING AGAINST
APARTHEID.

BACK HERE AT HOME A WAKEUP
CALL FROM TRIPLE A.

WE HAVE BEEN WARNED ABOUT
TEXTING WHILE DRIVING.

NOW THERE'S A NEW STUDY ABOUT
HANDS-FREE DEVICES AND SOMETHING
CALLED A KIND OF BLINDNESS
BEHIND THE WHEEL WHICH IS WHERE
WE FIND DAVID KERLEY TONIGHT.

ELECTRODES ARE YOU PUTTING ON?

I AM GETTING WIRED FOR RESEARCH.

I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND
STRETCH THIS OVER YOUR HEAD.

I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PUT
THE CHIN STRAP ON.

CONNECTIONS --
 GO AHEAD AND SCAN YOUR EYES
TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT AS FAR AS
MUCH MY BRAIN CAN HANDLE BEHIND
THE WHEEL.

REACTION TIME.

WHERE MY EYES LOOK.

9 MILLION CARS TODAY HAVE
SYSTEMS THAT LET YOU TALK TO
YOUR CAR SO YOU CAN KEEP YOUR
HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

62 MILLION WILL HAVE THEM IN
FIVE YEARS.

BUT IS IT SAFER?

WITH A SMALL BUTTON ON MY THUMB,
I CLICK WHEN A GREEN LIGHT
FLASHES, SIMULATING SOMETHING ON
THE ROAD THAT NEEDS MY
ATTENTION.

I DRIVE LISTENING TO THE RADIO.

THEN ANOTHER TRIP, WITH SPEECH
TO TEXT, HEARING AND ANSWERING
EMAIL.

HEY, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
IN A WHILE.

OKAY, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO
SAY?

SEND.

I CLICKED THE BUTTON, BUT --
HOW DID I DO, JOEL?

YOUR RESPONSE TIMES WERE A
BIT DELAYED WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGED
IN THAT SPEECH TO TEXT TASK.

RESEARCHERS FOR AAA FOUND --
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DISTRACTION
WAS THE RADIO.

GOING UP THE SCALE, TALKING ON A
HANDS-FREE PHONE, TALKING TO A
PASSENGER.

A HANDHELD PHONE WAS NEXT.

BUT IT'S THOSE SPEECH-TO-TEXT
PROGRAMS CAUSING THE MOST
DISTRACTION.

A FRACTION OF A SECOND.

IT CAN BE DANGEROUS.

THEY CALL IT, "INATTENTION
BLINDESS."

EVEN IF YOUR HANDS ARE ON THE
WHEEL AND YOUR EYES ARE ON THE
ROAD, YOU MAY NOT BE SAFE.

STUDY SENDS A MISLEADING
MESSAGE, SUGGESTING HANDS-FREE
AND HANDHELD DEVICES ARE EQUALLY
RISKY.

THE RISK, SAYS AAA, IS THAT
THESE SYSTEMS SOLD AS SAFE MAY
REALLY LEAD US TO DISTRACTION.

YOUR NEXT MESSAGE IS LOADING.

DAVID KERLEY, MARYLAND.

NEXT A MOMENT OF TERROR 46
STORIES IN THE AIR, TWO WINDOW
WASHERS IN NEW YORK CITY NEAR
THE TOP OF A SKY SCRAPER, THEIR
SCAFFOLDING REFUSED TO FLATTEN
OUT, BUCKLED IN THE MIDDLE FROM
THE GROUND.

YOU CAN SEE HOW HIGH THEY WERE
STRANDED.

THEY WERE EVENTUALLY SAVED BY
RESCUERS WHO REMOVED PART OF A
WINDOW NEXT TO THEM, PULLED THEM
INSIDE THE BUILDING.

THE RESCUERS SAY THE WINDOW
WASHERS WERE NOT PANICKED.

IN FACT, THEY SMILED AND SAID,
"ALL THIS FOR US?"

NOW TO A TRIUMPH FOR AN
AMERICAN FAMILY WHO REFUSED TO
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL NAMED SARAH
NEEDED A NEW LIFE SAVING SET OF
LUNGS BUT THE FINE PRINT OF THE
DONOR RULES STOOD IN HER WAY.

AN OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT CHANGED
THE STORY AND DAVID WRIGHT TELLS
US THE LATEST TONIGHT.

A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO CAN
BREATHE A BIT EASIER TONIGHT.

RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE, A
HOPE.

CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND NEEDED A NEW
SET OF LUNGS, A RARE COMMODITY
ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS BECAUSE OF
THEIR SIZE.

CHILDREN UNDER 12 HAVE TO WAIT
FOR DONOR LUNGS FROM OTHER KIDS.

ADULT LUNGS HAVE TO BE TRIMMED
DOWN TO FIT THEM.

A RISKY PROPOSITION.

THAT'S WHY THE U.S.

REQUIRES ALL
AVAILABLE ADULT LUNGS TO BE
OFFERED TO ADULTS FIRST.

MADAM SECRETARY, I WOULD URGE
YOU THIS WEEK TO ALLOW THE LUNG
TRANSPLANT TO MOVE FORWARD.

FOUGHT FOR SARAH ALL THE WAY TO
WASHINGTON.

UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE ABOUT
40 VERY SERIOUSLY ILL
PENNSYLVANIANS OVER THE AGE OF
12 ALSO WAITING FOR A LUNG
TRANSPLANT.

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED SHE BE
PLACED ON THE ADULT LIST, A
CONTROVERSIAL DECISION.

I DON'T THINK WE WANT JUDGES
MAKING MEDICAL DECISIONS ANYMORE
THAN WE WANT DOCTORS DECIDING
SUPREME COURT CASES.

WHOA!

MY HOPE IS SHE ACCOMPLISHES
ALL THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT TEN
YEAR OLDS SHOULD ACCOMPLISH.

A SECOND CHANCE.

DEAL WITH THE AIRLINES.

SHOW US THE POSSIBILITIES IN OUR
LIVES.

THIS IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR
BREATH AWAY.

NOW A KIND OF TRUTH OR DARE,
2 MILLION AMERICANS A DAY TRAVEL
BY AIRPLANE FOR WORK OR
VACATION.

TRAVELERS DON'T KNOW IF THEY
PAID A LOT MORE FOR THEIR TICKET
THAN SOMEONE SMART SITTING RIGHT
NEXT TO THEM.

LINSEY DAVIS ON THE NEW MAGAZINE
SHOW THE LOOKOUT ASKING ARE YOU
GETTING THE BEST DEAL?

TICKET PRICES VARY BUT HERE IN
ATLANTA WE WERE SURPRISED TO
FIND A SPREAD OF MORE THAN $600
FOR THE SAME TICKET.

HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR YOUR
TICKET?

$320.

ROUND TRIP $240.

A LITTLE OVER $600.

THIS MAN NAMED DAVE GOT US
SCRATCHING OUR HEADS.

FATHER WAS $427.91, A GRAND
TOTAL OF $481600.

WHEN DID YOU BOOK THAT?

ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO.

WOULD YOU BE REALLY
DISAPPOINTED TO KNOW THE LADY
SITTING RIGHT THERE ON THE END
PAID ABOUT $250.

I WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED.

SHE BOOKED TWO WEEKS AGO ON
EXPEDIA.

WOW.

DELTA TOLD US FARES ARE
DETERMINED BY MARKET SUPPLY AND
DEMAND AND DUE TO GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS THEY COULDN'T
DISCUSS IT FURTHER.

FINAL CALL FOR ALL
PASSENGERS.

I GUESS I BETTER GET ON THIS
FLIGHT NOW.

ONCE WE STARTED ASKING --
 DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER HOW MUCH
YOU PAID FOR YOUR FLIGHT TICKET?

50,000 POINTS.

PEOPLE COULDN'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT.

HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR YOUR
TICKET?

280 TO 300.

259.

PER PERSON?

FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT PRICES?

FOR ANSWERS WE WENT TO THIS
LITTLE GUY.

DON'T KNOW HIM?

HE'S HIPMUNK, THE FACE OF A
TRAVEL SITE THAT MAKES IT THEIR
BUSINESS TO TRY TO MAKE SENSE OF
ALL THE PRICES.

AIRLINES REALIZE THAT PEOPLE
ARE WILLING TO PAY
DIFFERENT AMOUNTS DEPENDING ON
DIFFERENT THINGS.

THEY'RE TAKING FULL
ADVANTAGE.

ALL DAY LONG.

THERE'S NO GREAT WAY TO GAIN THE
SYSTEM.

INCREDIBLE RANGE OF PRICES
YOU SHOWED US THERE SO YOU SAID
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF TIPS THAT
REALLY DO WORK.

THE OLD STAND BY OF BUYING
EARLY AT LEAST 21 DAYS IN
ADVANCE AND YOU WANT TO TRY TO
STAY OVER SATURDAY NIGHT IF YOU
CAN.

STAY OVER SATURDAY.
