TONIGHT, THE HORROR SEEN
AROUND THE WORLD.

THE IMAGES ARE DISTURBING.

THE DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
UNLEASHED IN SYRIA.

WE ARE STAYING AWAY FROM THE
MOST GRUESOME MOMENTS.

FAMILIES, CHILDREN, AMONG THE
VICTIMS.

GASPING FOR AIR TO SURVIVE.

AND THE MOMENT ANOTHER EXPLOSION
HITS.

OUR TEAM MAKING CONTACT WITH A
DOCTOR ON THE GROUND.

ALSO BREAKING, PRESIDENT
TRUMP AND HIS CLAIM THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA WIRETAPPED TRUMP
TOWER BEFORE THE ELECTION.

NOW, THE NEW QUESTION TONIGHT
INVOLVING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,
SUSAN RICE.

DID SHE ASK FOR NAMES?

DID SHE UNMASK THEM?

MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP TEAM CAUGHT
UP IN SURVEILLANCE BY THE U.S.
WHAT SHE IS SAYING TONIGHT.

THE ABC NEWS INVESTIGATION.

FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER
CARTER PAGE.

WERE RUSSIAN SPIES ACTIVELY
TRYING TO RECRUIT HIM TO WORK
FOR THEM?

BRIAN ROSS FINDS HIM TODAY.

DID YOU GIVE THEM DOCUMENTS?

DID YOU RECEIVE DOCUMENTS FROM
THEM?

AND, TWO SEPARATE MANHUNTS.

THE OFFICER KILLED SHOWING UP TO
WORK.

AND IN ATLANTA, THE FEMALE
LAWYER TARGETED AND KILLED
DURING RUSH HOUR.

NEW REPORTING TONIGHT.

GOOD EVENING.

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.

WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN TONIGHT
WITH THE IMAGES THAT HAVE
STUNNED THE WORLD.

IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER
SIX YEARS OF WAR IN SYRIA, THERE
COULD BE SOMETHING EVEN WORSE
THAN WHAT MANY HAVE ALREADY
SEEN.

TONIGHT, OUR TEAM HAS TAKEN
GREAT CARE TO POUR THROUGH THE
IMAGES FIRST, BUT WE WARN YOU,
THEY'RE STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE.

A CHEMICAL ATTACK.

SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN
AMONG THE VICTIMS.

SURVIVORS BEING SPRAYED OFF,
AFTER WAR PLANES DROPPED WHAT
APPEARS TO BE A TOXIC GAS.

THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDING.

HERE'S JONATHAN KARL.

OVER THESE SCENES OF HORROR AND
SUFFERING IN SYRIA.

AN APPARENT WAR CRIME, A
SUSPECTED SARIN GAS ATTACK BY
THE GOVERNMENT KILLING DOZENS
AND SICKENING MANY MORE, YOUNG
CHILDREN AMONG THE VICTIMS.

RESCUE WORKERS DESPERATELY WORK
TO WASH THE CHEMICAL FROM THE
VICTIMS.

CHILDREN CLINGING TO LIFE,
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.

THE GAS ATTACKS ARE
CONTINUING EVERY DAY AND NO ONE
IS DOING ANYTHING TO STOP THIS
GAS ATTACK.

FOLLOWING TWO CHLORINE GAS
ATTACKS OVER THE PAST WEEK.

WHILE THIS LOCAL ACTIVIST
REPORTED FROM ONE OF THOSE
HOSPITALS, IT WAS HIT WITH
ANOTHER AIRSTRIKE.

THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED THE
ATTACK "REPREHENSIBLE" AND SAID
IT "CANNOT BE IGNORED BY THE
CIVILIZED WORLD."

BUT THE STATEMENT ALSO TOOK AIM
AT PRESIDENT OBAMA.

"THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
BASHAR AL-ASSAD REGIME ARE A
CONSEQUENCE OF THE PAST
ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS AND
IRRESOLUTION."

THAT'S A REFERENCE TO PRESIDENT
OBAMA'S FAILURE TO PUNISH SYRIA
FOR CROSSING THE SO-CALLED RED
LINE WHEN IT USED CHEMICAL
WEAPONS IN 2013.

PRESIDENT OBAMA IN FACT BOASTED
THAT HE HAD WORKED OUT AN
AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA AND SYRIA
TO GET RID OF ASSAD'S CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

ASSAD GAVE UP HIS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

THAT'S NOT SPECULATION ON OUR
PART.

WAS NOT TRUE.

AT LEAST SOME OF THE WEAPONS
REMAINED.

THE BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL
HOLD ASSAD ACCOUNTABLE FOR USING
CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT TODAY
BUT HE DID SAY THIS IN A SPEECH
ON THE ECONOMY.

I'M NOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO
BE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD.

I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, AND FROM NOW ON, IT'S
GOING TO BE AMERICA FIRST.

REX TILLERSON IGNORED QUESTIONS
ON THE ATTACK.

MR. SECRETARY, ANY COMMENT ON
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA?

BASHAR AL ASSAD SHOULD STILL
BE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA?

CHANGE IN LONGTIME U.S. POLICY
THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD MUST GO.

I THINK THE STATUS IN THE
LONGER TERM STATUS OF PRESIDENT
ASSAD WILL BE DECIDED BY THE
SYRIAN PEOPLE.

SYRIAN PEOPLE AREN'T DETERMINING
THE STATUS OF ASSAD, THEY ARE
TRYING TO SURVIVE HIS BRUTALITY.

AND JON WITH US LIVE TONIGHT
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

SECRETARY TILLERSON DID NOT TAKE
QUESTIONS ON THIS TODAY, BUT HE
APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN TO HARSHER
LINE IN A STATEMENT TODAY THAN
LINE.

A WRITTEN STATEMENT WHERE HE
CONDEMNED ASSAD.

REFERRING TO HIS BRUTAL,
UNABASHED BARBARISM.

AND HIS FUNDAMENTAL DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN DECENCY.

AND CALLED OUT RUSSIA AND IRAN,
SAYING THEY BEAR GREAT MORAL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS.

BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION WILL DO ABOUT IT
AND WHETHER THEY NOW WANT ASSAD
TO GO.

JON, THANK YOU.

WE TURN TO THE OTHER MAJOR
HEADLINE INVOLVING THE WHITE
HOUSE, AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
CLAIM THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA
WIRETAPPED TRUMP TOWER.

SUSAN RICE ANSWERING QUESTIONS
TONIGHT.

DID SHE ASK THAT MEMBERS OF THE
TRUMP TEAM WERE UNMASKED AFTER
BEING SWEPT UP IN SURVEILLANCE
ON FOREIGN THREATS?

HERE'S CECILIA VEGA.

MONTH AGO THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACCUSED PRESIDENT OBAMA OF
WIRETAPPING HIM IN TRUMP TOWER.

AND TONIGHT, THE PRESIDENT'S
CONSERVATIVE ALLIES SAY OBAMA'S
FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
SUSAN RICE REVEALED THE
IDENTITIES OF TRUMP ASSOCIATES
SWEPT UP IN SURVEILLANCE.

FROM RICE TODAY, A FIRM DENIAL.

THIS IS NOT ANYTHING
POLITICAL HAS BEEN ALLEGED.

THE ALLEGATION IS THAT SOMEHOW
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
UTILIZED INTELLIGENCE FOR
POLITICAL PURPOSES.

THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

NEWS THAT AS THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY INVESTIGATED RUSSIA'S
ELECTION MEDDLING, IN SOME
CASES, TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
TRANSITION OFFICIALS WERE PICKED
UP IN SURVEILLANCE.

RICE REQUESTING THEIR
IDENTITIES.

TODAY RICE SAID SHE DID INDEED
ASK TO KNOW NAMES.

A REQUEST KNOWN AS UNMASKING,
DONE IN CASES WHERE U.S.
SECURITY IS AT RISK.

AMERICAN IDENTITIES THAT WOULD
OTHERWISE BE ANONYMOUS ARE
REVEALED TO THOSE WITH SECURITY
CLEARANCE, LIKE RICE.

IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE REPORT, AND
ASSESS ITS SIGNIFICANCE, IT WAS
NECESSARY TO FIND OUT, OR
REQUEST THE INFORMATION AS TO
WHO THAT U.S. OFFICIAL WAS.

WHETHER ANY OF THOSE NAMES WERE
TRUMP ASSOCIATES AND SHE
VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT SHE
LEAKED ANY NAMES.

I LEAKED NOTHING TO NOBODY
AND NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WOULD.

UNMASKING WAS A KEY PART OF HER
JOB.

WE CAN'T BE PASSIVE CONSUMERS
OF THIS INFORMATION AND NOT --
AND DO OUR JOBS EFFECTIVELY TO
PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

IMAGINE IF WE SAW SOMETHING OF
GRAVE SIGNIFICANCE THAT INVOLVED
RUSSIA, OR CHINA, OR ANYBODY
ELSE, INTERFERING IN OUR
POLITICAL PROCESS AND WE NEEDED
TO UNDERSTAND THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THAT.

FOR US NOT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND
IT WOULD BE DERELICTION OF DUTY.

BUYING IT.

SENATOR RAND PAUL TWEETING,
"SMOKING GUN FOUND."

SAYING --
 SO NOW WE KNOW THAT SOMEONE
IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS
EAVESDROPPING AND SPECIFICALLY
SEARCHING A DATABANK LOOKING FOR
THE TRUMP PEOPLE.

NO.

NO.

THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

THERE WAS NOTHING ILLEGAL, NO
SMOKING GUN, AND NO WIRETAPPING
OF TRUMP TOWER.

THERE WAS NO SUCH COLLECTION
OR SURVEILLANCE ON TRUMP TOWER
OR TRUMP INDIVIDUALS AND IT IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND,
AND BY THAT I MEAN DIRECTED BY
THE WHITE HOUSE OR TARGETED AT
TRUMP INDIVIDUALS.

LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA,
AND SOME REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING
FOR RICE TO TESTIFY.

WHERE DOES THE WHITE HOUSE
STAND?

WEIGHING IN ON THIS ONE JUST
YET.

THEY DO, THOUGH, CALL THE
REPORTS ABOUT UNMASKING
TROUBLING, BUT THE CALLS GROWING
LOUDER.

THE REPUBLICANS JUST SENT A
LETTER TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEES
DEMANDING THAT RICE BE CALLED
UPON TO TESTIFY.

CECILIA, THANK YOU.

WE TURN NOW TO AN ABC NEWS
INVESTIGATION, AND IT INVOLVES
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER
CARTER PAGE.

AND THIS QUESTION -- DID RUSSIAN
SPIES TRY TO RECRUIT HIM TO WORK
FOR THEM?

TONIGHT, THE EVIDENCE, AND HOW
HE ANSWERS WHEN BRIAN ROSS
TRACKED HIM DOWN TODAY.

THIS NEW YORK BUSINESSMAN,
CARTER PAGE, BECAME A FOREIGN
POLICY ADVISER TO CANDIDATE
DONALD TRUMP, RUSSIAN SPIES
TRIED TO RECRUIT HIM AS AN
INTELLIGENCE SOURCE.

FBI DOCUMENTS SHOW THEY OFFERED
PAGE, IDENTIFIED AS MALE NUMBER
1, "FAVORS" AND "BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITIES" IN RUSSIA IN
EXCHANGE FOR INFORMATION.

"HE FLIES TO MOSCOW MORE OFTEN
THAN I DO," ONE RUSSIAN SPY TOLD
ANOTHER ABOUT PAGE.

"IT'S OBVIOUS THAT HE WANTS TO
EARN LOTS OF MONEY."

"YOU PROMISE A FAVOR FOR A
FAVOR."

THE SPIES, POSING AS RUSSIAN
TRADE OFFICIALS, SAID PAGE
PROVIDED THEM WITH DOCUMENTS ON
THE U.S. ECONOMY.

TODAY PAGE TOLD ABC NEWS THAT
ANY DOCUMENTS HE PASSED TO THE
RUSSIANS WERE OF LITTLE
CONSEQUENCE.

ANY INFORMATION I WOULD GIVE
IS, IS, AGAIN, IMMATERIAL.

YOU WERE WORKING FOR THEM AS AN
INTELLIGENCE SOURCE?

OF COURSE NOT, OF COURSE NOT.

CALL YOU.

IT'S RIDICULOUS.

EVERYTHING.

MAKING IT UP AGAIN.

NOTHING.

GOOD TO SEE YOU.

IN PAGE CONTINUED DURING THE
CAMPAIGN.

LAST JULY, THE LITTLE-KNOWN
BUSINESSMAN WAS INVITED TO
DELIVER A PRESTIGIOUS SPEECH AT
A MOSCOW UNIVERSITY WHERE HE
DENOUNCED THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION.

BUT PAGE HAS SAID ALLEGATIONS HE
SERVED AS A GO-BETWEEN FOR THE
KREMLIN AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
OR MET WITH SENIOR RUSSIAN
OFFICIALS ARE FALSE.

COMPLETELY MADE UP AND --
YEAH.

INTERVIEW, PAGE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
HE DID MEET WITH THE RUSSIAN
AMBASSADOR AT THE REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND.

WHITE HOUSE AIDES SAY PAGE WAS
NEVER A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE
CAMPAIGN.

AND THE RUSSIAN SPIES WHO TRIED
TO RECRUIT HIM ARE NOW BACK IN
MOSCOW.

BRIAN, DURING THE CAMPAIGN,
AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS
BECAME CONCERNED THAT PAGE WAS
ADVISING DONALD TRUMP?

THAT'S RIGHT, WHEN HE SHOWED
UP IN MOSCOW TO GIVE THE SPEECH
LAST JULY, IT ONLY ADDED TO
THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE
POSSIBLE RUSSIAN CONNECTION.

BRIAN, THANK YOU.

MEANTIME ON CAPITOL HILL,
THE NEW EFFORT TO REPEAL AND
REPLACE OBAMACARE, TAKE TWO.

PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY
HOPING FOR A VOTE NOW BY THE END
OF THE WEEK.

INTENSE MEETINGS TAKING PLACE
WITH SOME CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICANS WHO STOPPED THE DEAL
LAST TIME.

BUT COULD PRE-EXISTING CONDITION
COVERAGE BE GOING AWAY IN THIS
NEW REPLACEMENT?

HERE'S MARY BRUCE.

TODAY, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE
STEPPING IN TO BRING HEALTH CARE
REFORM BACK FROM THE DEAD.

IS HEALTHCARE GOING TO GET DONE
THIS WEEK?

WHAT MAKES THIS TIME ANY
DIFFERENT?

THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW TRYING TO
STRIKE A DEAL WITH THE FREEDOM
CAUCUS, THOSE ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE
MEMBERS WHO KILLED THE FIRST
BILL.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ATTACKING THEM
EVER SINCE.

BUT NOW, EAGER FOR A WIN, THE
WHITE HOUSE SEEMS TO BE PUTTING
ON THE TABLE SOMETHING THE
PRESIDENT VOWED NOT TO TOUCH.

WHEN YOU REPLACE IT, ARE YOU
GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE
WITH PRECONDITIONS ARE STILL
COVERED?

YES.

BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF
THE STRONGEST ASSETS.

HOUSE IS CONSIDERING EFFECTIVELY
DOING AWAY WITH THAT PROVISION.

PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS COULD SEE THEIR
HEALTH CARE COSTS SKYROCKET.

ALSO ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK, THE
REQUIREMENT THAT INSURANCE
COMPANIES COVER ESSENTIAL
BENEFITS LIKE WELLNESS VISITS,
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT,
MATERNITY CARE AND EVEN
AMBULANCES.

NOW, INDIVIDUAL STATES COULD OPT
OUT.

SO, IS HEALTHCARE REFORM BACK
ON?

YES, IT IS.

WITH MEMBERS ABOUT TO HEAD HOME
FOR TWO WEEKS, THEY COULD BE
FACING MORE OF THIS.

IF YOU YELL ONE MORE TIME
LIKE THAT, I'M GOING TO ASK
YOU --
AGREEMENT.

IT'S PREMATURE TO SAY WHERE
WE ARE OR WHAT WE'RE ON, BECAUSE
WE'RE AT THAT CONCEPTUAL STAGE
RIGHT NOW.

MARY, ARE MODERATE
REPUBLICANS GOING TO BE ONBOARD
THIS TIME?

FACING THE SAME BALANCING ACT
THAT DERAILED THEM THE FIRST
TIME.

ANY CONCESSIONS TO CONSERVATIVES
RISK ALIENATING THE MODERATES.

THE VICE PRESIDENT IS BACK HERE
ON CAPITOL HILL TONIGHT MEETING
WITH REPUBLICAN LEADERS.

THEY'RE EAGER TO GET THIS DONE.

MARY, THANK YOU.

ALSO THIS EVENING, IVANKA
TRUMP ANSWERING CRITICISM ABOUT
HER INVOLVEMENT WITH HER
FATHER'S ADMINISTRATION.

TAKING ON AN OFFICIAL ROLE AT
THE WHITE HOUSE AS AN ASSISTANT
TO THE PRESIDENT.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CBS NEWS,
ASKED WHETHER SHE'S COMPLICIT
WITH HIS POLICIES, HERE'S WHAT
SHE SAID.

IF BEING COMPLICIT IS WANTING
TO, IS WANTING TO BE A FORCE FOR
GOOD, AND TO MAKE A POSITIVE
IMPACT, THEN I'M COMPLICIT.

IVANKA TRUMP WITH CBS.

NEXT TONIGHT, EXTREME
WEATHER ON THE WAY FOR MUCH OF
THE EAST.

FROM THE GULF UP THROUGH THE
OHIO VALLEY.

54 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE PATH
OF SEVERE STORMS.

POSSIBLE TORNADOES.

THE LATEST, IN DAYS OF DAMAGING
STORMS WE'VE BEEN COVERING.

THIS TORNADO WHIPPING UP 100
MILES AN HOUR, RIPPING OFF THE
SIDE OF A VIRGINIA BEACH HOME.

AFTERWARD, YOU CAN SEE THE OWNER
ON THE LEFT OPENING THE DOOR,
CREEPING TOWARD WHERE THERE USED
TO BE A BEDROOM WALL.

AND ROB MARCIANO, THIS IS GOING
TO BE ALL THE WAY UP THE COAST.

IT.

A SNOWSTORM IN DENVER.

NOW IN THE PLAINS.

AND SEVERE WEATHER ALREADY
POPPING.

IN OKLAHOMA, A SEVERE WEATHER
WATCH THERE, WITH THE STORMS
FIRING.

DAMAGING HAIL AND WIND.

AND IT'S GOING TO EXPAND, BY
TOMORROW MORNING, TWO BANDS
ACROSS ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, THE
SOUTHEAST.

AND ANOTHER ROUND OF SEVERE
WEATHER LATE TOMORROW.

THE BULL'S EYE WILL BE IN
GEORGIA AND ALABAMA, AND THE
THREAT STRETCHES ALL THE WAY UP
INTO OHIO.

TOMORROW WILL BE A VERY, VERY
ACTIVE DAY.

ROB, THANK YOU.

THERE IS A MASSIVE MANHUNT
IN TEXAS FOR THE KILLER OF A LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

AUTHORITIES SAY THIS BLACK SUV
PULLED UP TO THE COURTHOUSE, AND
OPENED FIRE ON AN OFFICER.

AND REPORTS THAT LAST WEEK,
CLINT GREENWOOD TOLD CO-WORKERS
HE FELT THREATENED BY SOMEONE
HE HAD ONCE INVESTIGATED IN A
CORRUPTION CASE.

THE REWARD STANDS AT 6$5,000.

THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE
AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS TONIGHT."

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE KILLING
OF A LAWYER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

THE SUSPECT SEEN ON SURVEILLANCE
RUNNING FROM THE SCENE.

POLICE WITH NEW INFORMATION
TONIGHT COMING IN.

ALSO, THE TEENAGER ATTACKED
BY A SHARK ON THE AMERICAN
COAST.

FIGHTING IT OFF, TO STAY ALIVE.

AND THEN TONIGHT, THE SMALL
PLANE SLAMMING INTO THE SIDE OF
A MOUNTAIN.

THE DELTA 767 THAT HEARD THEIR
CALLS FOR HELP.

YOU'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

NEXT TONIGHT, NEW TROUBLE
FOR FOX NEWS.

A NEW LAWSUIT, THIS TIME
CLAIMING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION.

AND IT COMES AFTER ALLEGATIONS
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

TONIGHT, THERE'S NEW FALLOUT ON
THAT FRONT AS WELL.

A GROWING NUMBER OF ADVERTISERS
FLEEING BILL O'REILLY'S SHOW.

HERE'S LINSEY DAVIS.

MORE THAN 15 COMPANIES PLAN TO
PULL ADS FROM THE NETWORK'S
TOP-RATED SHOW, "THE O'REILLY
FACTOR," IN THE WAKE OF REPORTS
BILL O'REILLY AND FOX NEWS PAID
FIVE WOMEN A TOTAL OF ALMOST
$13 MILLION IN SETTLEMENTS
DATING BACK 15 YEARS.

JUST YESTERDAY, RADIO HOST
DR. WENDY WALSH SAID SHE TOO WAS
SEXUALLY HARASSED BY O'REILLY.

HE TOLD ME I WAS A BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN.

HE ASKED ME TO GO TO HIS HOTEL
ROOM.

AND THEN HE BECAME HOSTILE TO ME
WHEN I SAID NO AND I WAS SOON
AFTER DISCONTINUED FROM HIS
SHOW.

NOT ASKING FOR MONEY.

BUT MONEY IS WHAT O'REILLY SAYS
IS WHAT MAKES HIM A TARGET.

IN A STATEMENT POSTED ON HIS
WEBSITE OVER THE WEEKEND,
O'REILLY SAYS HE HAS TO PUT TO
REST ANY CONTROVERSIES TO SPARE
HIS CHILDREN.

TONIGHT, FOX NEWS IS RESPONDING,
SAYING WE VALUE OUR PARTNERS,
AND ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO
ADDRESS THEIR CURRENT CONCERNS
ABOUT "THE O'REILLY FACTOR."

LINSEY, THANK YOU.

WHEN WE COME BACK, THE
LAWYER TARGETED AND KILLED
DURING RUSH HOUR.

YOU'LL SEE THE SUSPECT ON

SHE PUNCHED TO FIGHT OFF THE
SHARK.

HER MOTHER SAYS CAITLYN SUFFERED
CUTS TO HER HAND, JAW AND LEGS,
REQUIRING MORE THAN 120
STITCHES.

SHE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

NEW CONCERNS ABOUT INTERNET
PRIVACY IN THE HISTORY OF WHAT
YOU LOOK FOR ON YOUR COMPUTER.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNING A LAW
ALLOWING INTERNET PROVIDERS TO
SELL YOUR BROWSING HISTORY AND
PERSONAL DATA TO ADVERTISERS.

THE NEW LAW MAKES IT EASIER FOR
COMPANIES SUCH AS COMCAST, AT&T
AND VERIZON TO TRACK YOUR ONLINE
INFORMATION.

IT OVERTURNS AN FCC PRIVACY
REGULATION THAT WAS SET TO TAKE
EFFECT LATER THIS YEAR.

REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THAT
MEASURE WAS EXCESSIVE.

WHEN WE COME BACK, "AMERICA
STRONG."

 FINALLY TONIGHT HERE,
"AMERICA STRONG."

THE DEVOTED MOM, THE DETERMINED
BOY, AND THE COACH WHO HEARD
THEM.

IT'S A FIELD OF DREAMS FOR ONE
BOY WHO WISHES HE WAS OUT THERE.

8-YEAR-OLD DANNY JONES OF FT.
WORTH, TEXAS, WHO LOVES
BASEBALL.

HE WAS BORN WITHOUT A
FULLY-FUNCTIONING HEART, RELYING
ON JUST HALF OF IT.

HE'S HAD SEVEN SURGERIES, AND IS
STILL WAITING FOR A NEW ONE.

THE BACKPACK HAS LIFE-SAVING
MEDICATION TO KEEP HIS HEART
GOING.

HIS MOTHER WAS DETERMINED TO GET
HIM ON THE FIELD.

I ASKED SOME FRIENDS ON
FACEBOOK, DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY
OLD UNIFORMS.

THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS.

UNIFORMS.

ONE LITTLE LEAGUE COACH HAD A
SPOT ON THE TEAM.

I DIDN'T HESITATE.

I SAID, I'LL TAKE HIM.

PLAY, HE WAS GOING TO BE ON THE
TEAM.

BUT THEN, LOOK, DANNY, UP AT THE
PLATE, DURING PRACTICE.

HIS BACKPACK ON.

HIS BAT READY.

HE COMES TO THE FIRST
PRACTICE.

HEY, WHERE DO YOU WANT ME,
WINNING ATTITUDE, HE EARNED A
SPOT.

HE SAID, I'VE BEEN WAITING
ONE EXCITED.

FINALLY, DANNY'S CHANCE.

HE TAUGHT US WAY MORE THAN WE

DANNY MADE IT HOME.
