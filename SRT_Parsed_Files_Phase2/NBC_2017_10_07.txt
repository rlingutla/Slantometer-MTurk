PENSACOLA.

IT COULD HIT AS A
HURRICANE.

DID ANY ONE ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THE PLOT TO
KILL IN LAS VEGAS.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN
THE INVESTIGATION.

POLICE NOT CONVINCED
THAT THE ATTACKER KEPT
IT TO HIMSELF.

BIRTH CONTROL
BATTLE.

THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION ROLLS
BACK OBAMA ERA RULES,
ALLOWING MORE
EMPLOYERS TO OPT OUT
OF PAYING FOR
CONTRACEPTION
COVERAGE.

SHOCK WAVES,
RIPPLING ACROSS
HOLLYWOOD AND NEW
FALLOUT FOR A POWERFUL
MOVIE MOGUL FACING A
STORM OF ACCUSATIONS
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT
INCLUDING FROM A MAJOR
STAR.

AND SONG AND A
PRAYER.

LIN MANUEL MIRANDA
LEADS AN ALL-STAR
TRIBUTE FOR POUERTO
RICO.

"NBC NIGHTLY NEWS"
BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

GOOD EVENING TO OUR
VIEWERS IN THE WEST.

THANK YOU FOR BEING
WITH US.

LATE TODAY, THE GULF
COAST BRACES FOR
ANOTHER POSSIBLE
HURRICANE.

THIS ONE IS CALLED
NATE.

TROPICAL STORM NOW,
THREATENING TO BUILD
TO HURRICANE STRENGTH
BEFORE HITTING THE
GULF COAST THIS
WEEKEND.

POSING A MAJOR FLOOD
DANGER AFTER LEAVING
NEARLY TWO DOZEN DEAD
ACROSS CENTRAL
AMERICA.

HURRICANE AND TROPICAL
STORM WARNINGS ARE
POSTED TO NIGHT FROM
LOUISIANA TO THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE.

OUR KERRY SANDERS HAS
THE LATEST.

CENTRAL AMERICA AS A
WEAK TROPICAL STORM,
BUT THE IMPACT
POWERFUL.

IN HEART-HIT
NICARAGUA, UP TO
15-INCH ELSE OF RAIN
TURNS ROADS LIKE THIS
INTO RIVERS.

THIS WOMAN SAID THE
STORM HAS LEFT SO MANY
CHILDREN CRYING,
THEY'RE HUNGRY AND
THIRSTY.

IN MOUNTAINOUS COSTA
RICA MAJOR MUDSLIDES
AND WIDE-SPREAD POWER
OUTAGES.

THOUSANDS NOW
HOMELESS.

AT LEAST 22 DEAD,
AMONG THEM TWO KIDS
SWEPT AWAY IN
FAST-RISING WATERS.

HURRICANE WARNING NOW
IN PLACE FOR PARTS OF
LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI
AND ALABAMA.

IN NEW ORLEANS, A RACE
TO SANDBAG TONIGHT.

RESIDENTS HERE NOT
WORRIED SO MUCH ABOUT
THE LEVY SYSTEM GIVING
WAY AS HAPPENED
12 YEARS AGO DURING
KATRINA, RATHER FEARS
THE CITY'S CRIPPLED
PUMPING SYSTEM WILL
FAIL.

IT WAS RECENTLY
TESTED, YOU KNOW.

THE SYSTEM ITSELF, IT
JUST DIDN'T HOLD.

PUMPS IN THE CITY LOST
POWER.

ONLY EIGHT INCHES OF
RAIN TURNING INTO A
CALAMITY.

I WANT TO BE REALLY
CLEAR.

WE HAVE SUFFICIENT
PUMPS POWER AND
MANPOWER TO HANDLE
THIS THREAT IF THE
RAIN TOTALS REMAIN AS
FORECAST AND THE
INTENSITY IS DIRECTED.

ATTENTION IS NOW ON
THOSE PUMPS LIKE THE
ONE OVER MY SHOULDER
HERE WITH THE
EXPECTATION THAT NATE
WILL BECOME A
HURRICANE.

AS YOU NOTED AT THE
TOP HERE, LESTER, THE
MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS
HAS ISSUED MANDATORY
EVACUATIONS FOR
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE
DIE.

KERRY SANDERS
TONIGHT.

THANK YOU AND LET'S
TURN TO AL ROKER WITH
THE LATEST FORECAST
TRACK WHICH HAS
SHIFTED SLIGHTLY SINCE
LAST NIGHT, AND
WHETHER IT HITS AS A
TROPICAL STORM OR
CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF
DIFFERENCE TO FOLKS
ALONG THE GULF COAST
AFTER WHAT THEY'VE
SEEN THIS STORM
SEASON.

ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
LESTER.

THE TRACK HAS SHIFTED
A LITTLE TO THE WEST.

RIGHT NOW 80 MILES
EAST OF COZUMEL,
MEXICO,
60-MILE-PER-HOUR
WINDS.

WE'RE
TALKING A MOVEMENT OF
NORTH/NORTHWEST,
BOOKING AT 21 MILES AN
HOUR.

AT THIS POINT IT IS
ABOUT 200 MILES AWAY
FROM NEW ORLEANS,
SATURDAY AT 100 P.M.
70-MILE PER HOUR
WINDS.

IT MAKES LANDFALL
ABOUT 100 A.M. AND
CONTINUES TO MOVE
RATHER RAPIDLY, ABOUT
140 MILES OF THAT CONE
OF UNCERTAINTY, AND
MOVES VERY QUICKLY OUT
TO SEA.

HOWEVER, HERE IS WHAT
WE LOOK FOR.

HURRICANE WARNING
RIGHT NOW FROM
LOUISIANA ALL THE WAY
TO ABOUT THE
PENSACOLA/MOBILE,
ALABAMA AREA.

HEAVY RAIN, FLASH
FLOODING, TROPICAL
FORCE WINDS.

LOOK AT THE STORM
SURGE, LOUISIANA, FOUR
TO SIX FEET, FOUR TO
SIX FOR PENSACOLA,
FLORIDA.

WE HAVE TO WATCH
THIS AND WAIT
BECAUSE A TRACK CHANGE
OF 50 MILES CAN MAKE A
BIG DIFFERENCE.

AL ROKER, THANK
YOU.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS
FOR THE MASS SHOOTING
IN LAS VEGAS.

INVESTIGATORS
EMPHASIZING LATE TODAY
THEY DON'T BELIEVE
THERE WAS A SECOND
SHOOTER, BUT A LOT OF
QUESTIONS REMAINED
ABOUT WHO ELSE MAY
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS
PLOT.

MEANWHILE, ALL 58
VICTIMS KILLED HAVE
NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED.

WE'LL GET THE LATEST
FROM NBC'S MIGUEL
ALMAGUER.

THE WINDOWS WHERE
STEVEN PADDOCK
UNLEASHED THE MURDER,
THE NIGHTMARE.

INVESTIGATORS HAVE
NEW SCOURED MULTIPLE
CRIME SCENES, THE
HOTEL, THE CONCERT
TURNED KILLING FIELD
AND THE HOMES WHERE HE
LIVED.

WHAT CAN YOU TELL
US ABOUT MOTIVE?

I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
FOR MOTIVE.

HE ITS THE ONLY
SHOOTER,
I'M CONFIDENT HE WAS
THE ONLY PERSON
INVOLVED AND THE ONLY
PERSON IN THE ROOM.

BUT DID ANYBODY ELSE
KNOW WHAT HE WAS
PLANNING AND WHY?

THAT IS THE MAIN FOCUS
OF OUR INVESTIGATION
RECORDS SHOW PADDOCK
EARNED AT LEAST
$5 MILLION GAMBLING IN
2015.

TWO SOURCES SAY THE
GUNMAN BOUGHT SOME
AMMO  FROM A RECENT
GUN SHOW IN PHOENIX.

AND SOUGHT TO PURCHASE
TRACER ROUNDS, BULLETS
THAT LEAVE A VISIBLE
TRAIL IN THE DARK.

SHOT FOUR TIMES,
SAMANTHA FERANDA WAS
ABLE TO GO HOME TODAY.

I'M GRATEFUL I
DIDN'T HAVE TO
COMPLETELY SAY GOODBYE
TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE
THAT I LOVE.

HAPPENED IN VEGAS IS
BEING FELT NATIONWIDE.

TODAY IN CHICAGO AND
AUSTIN, STEPPED-UP
SECURITY AS THOUSANDS
GATHER FOR CONCERTS
AND BASEBALL GAMES.

TONIGHT WE NOW KNOW
THE NAMES OF ALL 58
VICTIMS, 30 WITH TIES
TO SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA.

THE YOUNGEST JUST 20.

BAILEY SCHWEITZER,
THE OLDEST, 67-YEAR
OLD PATI MESTAS, LOVED
LIFE AND HER EIGHT
GRANDCHILDREN.

VEGAS POLICE OFFICER
CHARLESTON HARTFIELD
SERVED 16 YEARS IN THE
MILITARY, DYING ON A
BATTLEFIELD AT HOME IN
THE CITY HE LOVED.

â™ª AMAZING GRACE
GROWING MEMORIALS IN
LAS VEGAS AS 58
FAMILIES BEGIN TO PLAN
FUNERALS.

INVESTIGATORS POUR
OVER THE CRIME SCENE
BEHIND ME THEY SAY
THEY ARE CONFIDENT THE
GUNMAN ACTED ALONE.

WHAT THEY'RE UNCERTAIN
ABOUT IS AFTER MONTHS,
POSSIBLY EVEN YEARS OF
METICULOUS PLANNING,
HOW COULD NO ONE ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THE
MURDEROUS PLAN?

LESTER.

MIGUEL ALMAGUER IN
LAS VEGAS TONIGHT.

THANK YOU.

WE'RE LEARNING OF
ANOTHER PLOT TO ATTACK
CONCERT VENUES IN
OTHER CROWDED AREAS
SUCH AS TIMES SQUARE
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

FEDERAL PROSECUTORS
SAY THREE MEN WERE
ARRESTED FOR THE
ISIS-INSPIRED PLAN
THAT WAS BROKEN UP
THANKS IN PART TO AN
UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT.

NBC JUSTICE
CORRESPONDENT PETE
WILLIAMS IS FOLLOWING
THAT.

PROSECUTORS SAY THAT
THE DISCOVERY OF THIS
PLOT INSPIRED BY ISIS
WAS KEPT SECRET UNTIL
TONIGHT BECAUSE THE
FBI WANTED TO FIND OUT
IF OTHERS WERE
INVOLVED.

COURT DOCUMENTS SAY
THREE MEN FROM CANADA,
PAKISTAN AND THE
PHILIPPINES PLANNED TO
SET OFF BOMBS IN TIMES
SQUARE AND SHOOT AT
PEOPLE ATTENDING
CONCERTS AROUND THE
CITY.

THEY TALKED ABOUT THE
2015 ATTACKS IN FRANCE
AT THE BATACLAN
THEATER AND SAID, "WE
JUST WALK IN WITH GUNS
IN OUR HANDS, THAT'S
HOW THE PARIS GUYS DID
IT."

THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT
SETTING OFF BOMBS IN
THE CROWDED NEW YORK
SUBWAY AND IDENTIFIED
WHICH LINES THEY WOULD
FOCUS ON.

THIS PLOT WAS ACTUALLY
BROKEN UP IN MAY OF
2016.

PROSECUTORS SAY WHEN
THE MEN WERE
DISCOVERED
COMMUNICATING ABOUT
TERRORISM AN FBI
UNDERCOVER AGENT SOON
JOINED IN AND THE
THREE WERE UNDER CLOSE
SURVEILLANCE.

ONE HAS NOW PLEADED
GUILTY, THE OTHER TWO
ARE UNDER ARREST.

LESTER.

PETE WILLIAMS IN
OUR WASHINGTON
NEWSROOM.

THANK YOU, PETE 
TONIGHT, A NEW TURN IN
THE BATTLE OVER BIRTH
CONTROL AND RELIGIOUS
FREEDOMS IN
WASHINGTON.

THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION IS
ROLLING BACK OBAMA ERA
RULES AND ALLOWING
MORE EMPLOYERS TO OPT
OUT OF PAYING FOR
CONTRACEPTION
COVERAGE.

AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT
HAS WOMEN'S HEALTH
ADVOCATES VOWING TO
FIGHT BACK.

OUR CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT HALLIE
JACKSON HAS DETAILS.

IT IS GETTING HARDER
FOR SOME WOMEN TO GET
BIRTH CONTROL THROUGH
THEIR INSURANCE AFTER
A SWEEPING CHANGE BY
THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION THAT
WILL LET MORE
EMPLOYERS OPT OUT OF A
REQUIREMENT TO PAY FOR
CONTRACEPTIVE
COVERAGE.

THE NEW RULE NOW
ALLOWS MORE BUSINESSES
WHO DON'T WANT TO
SUBSIDIZE BIRTH
CONTROL FOR EMPLOYEES
TO ASK FOR EXEMPTIONS
FOR MORAL OR RELIGIOUS
REASONS, NOT JUST
RELIGIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS BUT
BUSINESSES OF ALL
SIZES, SCHOOLS AND
UNIVERSITIES, AND
NONPROFITS, TOO.

THE DECISION TODAY
CELEBRATED BY
RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES
ADVOCATES.

WHAT IT DOES DO IS
CREATE A NARROW AND
TARGETED EXEMPTION FOR
THOSE WHO CANNOT IN
GOOD CONSCIENCE
PROVIDE THIS AS PART
OF THEIR HEALTH CARE
TRUMP FULFILLING A
CAMPAIGN PLEDGE.

THE FIRST PRIORITY
OF MY ADMINISTRATION
WILL BE TO PRESERVE
AND PROTECT OUR
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

ADMINISTRATION SAYS
THE NEW EXEMPTIONS
MIGHT ONLY APPLY TO
200 COMPANIES AND WILL
NOT AFFECT THE VAST
MAJORITY OF WOMEN, BUT
THAT'S ONLY BASED ON
GROUPS THAT SO FAR
HAVE SUED THE
GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE
TO OPT OUT OF
OBAMACARE'S
CONTRACEPTIVE
REQUIREMENT.

WHAT'S UNKNOWN IS WHO
ELSE MIGHT ASK FOR
EXEMPTIONS.

ADVOCATES FOR BROADER
ACCESS TO BIRTH
CONTROL DESCRIBE THIS
AS A SETBACK WITH THE
ACLU ALREADY
ANNOUNCING A LAWSUIT.

WHAT THIS RULE DOES
IS PUT THAT COVERAGE
IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE IT
PUTS CONTROL IN THEIR
BOSS'S HANDS AS TO
WHETHER THEY HAVE
ACCESS TO BIRTH
CONTROL COVERAGE THAT
IS CURRENTLY
TIMING, THE NEW RULE
GOES INTO EFFECT
IMMEDIATELY.

LESTER.

HALLIE JACKSON AT
THE WHITE HOUSE.

THANKS  NOW TO THE
CRYPTIC COMMENT FROM
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT
IS RIPPLING ACROSS
WASHINGTON TONIGHT.

SURROUNDED BY MILITARY
LEADERS AND THEIR
SPOUSES, THE PRESIDENT
TOLD REPORTERS THAT
THEY MIGHT BE SEEING
"THE CALM BEFORE THE
STORM," A REMARK THAT
PROMPTED MANY TO ASK
WAS HE REFERRING TO
SOMETHING SPECIFIC.

THE WHITE HOUSE ISN'T
SAYING.

NBC'S PETER ALEXANDER
HAS MORE.

THANK YOU VERY
MUCH, EVERYBODY.

OVAL OFFICE TONIGHT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH A
WINK AND A TEASE.

THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

YOU'LL FIND OUT.

NO NEW DETAILS ABOUT
THE MEANING OF THIS
CRYPTIC COMMENT DURING
A RECEPTION WITH
MILITARY LEADERS AND
THEIR SPOUSES THURSDAY
NIGHT.

YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT
THIS REPRESENTS?

TELL US, SIR.

MAYBE IT IS THE
CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

WHAT'S THE STORM?

COULD BE THE CALM,
THE CALM BEFORE THE
STORM.

WHAT STORM, MR.
PRESIDENT?

YOU'LL FIND OUT.

TALKING ABOUT?

THE WHITE HOUSE
INSISTING PRESIDENT
TRUMP NEVER TIPS HIS
HAND.

WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO SAY IN ADVANCE WHAT
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING
UNCLEAR WHETHER THE
PRESIDENT WAS JUST
TOYING AROUND,
DEFLECTING FROM THE
POLITICAL STORM AND
HOPING HIS
ADMINISTRATION OR
PREVIEWING SOME NEW
ACTION.

TONIGHT MULTIPLE U.S.
OFFICIALS TELLING NBC
NEWS PRESIDENT TRUMP
WILL LIKELY ANNOUNCE
NEXT WEEK HE WON'T
CERTIFY IRAN IS
COMPLYING WITH THE
NUCLEAR DEAL, A MOVE
THAT COULD LEAD TO NEW
SANCTIONS.

HIS PRESS SECRETARY,
UNPROMPTED, ALSO
BRINGING UP NORTH
KOREA.

WE'RE CONTINUING TO
PUT MAXIMUM ECONOMIC
AND DIPLOMATIC
PRESSURE ON COUNTRIES
LIKE NORTH KOREA.

WE'RE GOING TO
CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

HOUSE VETERANS WARN
WORDS MATTER.

THOSE WORDS THAT
COME OUT OF THE
PRESIDENT'S MOUTH HAVE
AN IMPACT ALL AROUND
THE GLOBE, AND
SOMETIMES THERE ARE
UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE
OF THE WORDS THAT ARE
SPOKEN.

THE FORMER REALITY TV
STAR TURNED PRESIDENT
IS LEAVING AMERICAN
ALLIES AND ADVERSARIES
WITH A CLIFFHANGER.

PETER ALEXANDER, NBC
NEWS, THE WHITE HOUSE
 NOW TO THE LATE
CONFIRMATION FROM THE
PENTAGON A FOURTH
AMERICAN SOLDIER WAS
KILLED IN NIGER, LEFT
BEHIND AFTER ISLAMIC
MILITANTS AMBUSHED A
U.S. SPECIAL FORCES
PATROL ON WEDNESDAY.

WE GET THE LATEST FROM
NBC NEWS PENTAGON
CORRESPONDENT HANS
NICHOLS.

BODIES OF THREE FALLEN
GREEN BERETS BACK HOME

WRIGHT FROM LYONS,
GEORGIA, JUST 29 YEARS
OLD.

 YEAH.

-- IT WAS JUST
HEARTBREAKING.

BERETS JUST A FEW OF
THE 800 AMERICAN
TROOPS IN NIGER WHERE
U.S. STATIONS DRONES
TO WATCH ISLAMIC

ROUTINE MISSION TURNED
INTO FULL-FLEDGED
COMBAT WHEN NEARLY A
DOZEN U.S. AND NIGER
FORCES WERE SURPRISED
BY ISLAMIC MILITANT
ALSO.

A DEADLY FIRE FIGHT
ENSUED.

FRENCH HELICOPTERS
EVACUATED THE
CASUALTIES.

IN THE CHAOS OF
BATTLE, ONE WAS
MISSING.

U.S. SPECIAL OPERATORS
WERE FLOWN IN FROM
ACROSS THE GLOBE, BUT
IT WAS TOO LATE.

HIS BODY FOUND TODAY
BY NIGERIAN TROOPS.

YOU TRY NEVER TO
LEAVE A SOLDIER
BEHIND.

IT IS UNUSUAL TO DO
SO.

IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE
HECK OF A FIRE FIGHT
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

OFFICIALS TELL NBC
NEWS THAT THE GREEN
BERETS DID KILL SOME
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS BUT
THEY CAN'T SAY HOW
MANY, WHERE THEY CAME
FROM OR IF THEY'LL
STRIKE AGAIN.

HANS NICHOLS, NBC
NEWS, THE PENTAGON.
