SUMMONING REPORTERS TELLING THEM
THEY'RE WITNESSING THE CALM

OUR REPORTER ASKS THE WHITE
HOUSE TONIGHT -- WHAT IS HE

A FAMOUS DALLAS COWBOYS STAR
AND HIS SON.

TONIGHT, A CAMPUS FRATERNITY
ACCUSED OF HAZING HIM DESCRIBED
AS A FIGHT CLUB.

IN NEW YORK CITY,
AUTHORITIES SAY IT WAS AN
ALLEGED TERROR PLOT.

POLICE SAY THE PLANS FOR TIMES
SQUARE AND THE NEW YORK CITY
SUBWAY.

AND KEITH URBAN.

THE MOMENT THAT MOVED SO MANY,
AS WE HONOR THE FACES.

GOOD EVENING AND IT IS GREAT TO
HAVE YOU WITH US ON A FRIDAY
NIGHT.

WE ARE A HURRICANE WEARY NATION
AND YET TONIGHT ANOTHER POWERFUL
STORM HEADED FOR THE U.S.
AT THIS HOUR NATE IS SPEEDING UP
AND GAINING STRENGTH.

RIGHT NOW HEADING INTO THE WARM
WATERS OF THE GULF.

STATES OF EMERGENCY ACROSS THE
GULF.

THE SYSTEM DEADLY BEFORE
ARRIVING.

22 LIVES LOST.

PREPARATIONS UNDER WAY AT THIS
HOUR AND THERE ARE NOW SOME
MANDATORY EVACUATIONS UNDER WAY.

LET'S GET TO GINGER ZEE WITH US
TONIGHT BECAUSE THIS WILL NOT
ONLY HIT THE GULF BUT WILL
TRAVEL THROUGH THE COUNTRY.

UP THROUGH THE NORTHEAST.

WE HAVE GOT TO WATCH FOR FLASH
FLOODING ALL THE WAY THROUGH
PENNSYLVANIA.

LET ME TAKE YOU STRAIGHT TO THE
MAP BECAUSE THE PENINSULA IS
SHOWING THE STORM EAST.

FLYING AT 21 MILES PER HOUR.

TO THE NORTH, NORTHWEST.

HURRICANE WARNING IN PLACEOR F
NEW ORLEANS, GULF PORT, BILOXI
MOBILE, TROPICAL WARNINGS
EXTENDING TO INLAND THERE.

THE BRUNT WILL BE FELT SATURDAY
NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING.

THAT'S WHEN IT IS GOING TO MAKE
LANDFALL AND SPEEDS UP THROUGH
THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE
NORTHEAST AND OUT BY TUESDAY.

BUT BEFORE THAT, THE IMPACT
STORM SURGE, FOUR TO SIX FEET.

ANYWHERE IN RED, THE BAY, GULF
SHORES UP TO EIGHT FEET AND TEN
INCHES OF RAIN.

ALONG THE GULF COAST.

TRACKING IT INTO THE WEEKEND.

THANK YOU.

IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THIS STORM
NEW ORLEANS AND THE LOW LYING
CITIES ALONG THE GULF DANGEROUS
FLOODING AND STORM SURGE IS
LIKELY AND THIS QUESTION
TONIGHT.

ARE THE PUMPS READY IN NEW
ORLEANS?

ABC'S STEVE OSUNSAMI IS THERE.

TONIGHT, THIS IS THE STATE OF
EMERGENCY AND THEY'RE RACING TO
GET READY FOR THIS STORM.

WE'RE GOING TO FLOOD.

I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO FLOOD.

THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

OTHERWISE I WOULD STILL BE AT
THE OFFICE RIGHT NOW.

IN NEW ORLEANS A DOZEN OF THE
CITY'S DRAINAGE PUMPS AREN'T
WORKING.

THAT THEY NEED TO KEEP THE CITY
DRY.

TEAMS ARE CLEARING DRAINS AND
PARTS OF JEFFERSON PARISHES,
NEW ORLEANS AND ST. BERNARD,
MORE THAN 1,000 FAMILIES FORCED
TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES.

ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS
TO THIS STORM IS NOT NECESSARILY
INTERIOR RAIN, BUT STORM SURGE.

LEAVING TONIGHT.

HE'S MOVED EVERYTHING OFF THE
GROUND.

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SURGE
IS GOING TO DO.

IF YOU DON'T PICK IT UP YOU LOSE
IT.

THIS IS LIKE A GAMBLE.

SIX FEET, HE LOSES EVERYTHING.

HE'S EXPECTING FIVE.

YOU CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

YOU CAN'T RUN FROM WATER, BABY.

ALREADY KILLED.

AT LEAST 11 DEAD IN NICARAGUA,
AND EIGHT IN COSTA RICA.

DOZENS MORE MISSING AFTER
MUDSLIDES WASHED AWAY HOMES
 AND STEVE JOINS US LIVE
TONIGHT.

STEVE, YOU WERE TELLING US THOSE
PUMPS CAN PULL OUT AN INCH OF
RAIN IN AN HOUR?

HOUR.

AFTER THAT, THE ABILITY OF A
PUMPING STATION DROPS TO ABOUT
HALF AN INCH AN HOUR ASSUMING
ALL THE PUMPS ARE WORKING WHICH
WOULD SURPRISE JUST ABOUT
EVERYONE IN THE CITY.

WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF
SEVERAL INCHES OF RAIN FALL OVER
NEW ORLEANS ALL AT ONCE, THIS
CITY WILL STILL FLOOD EVEN WITH
ALL OF THE PUMPS WORKING
PROPERLY.

WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT
CITY AND EVERY CITY ALONG THE
GULF.

THANK YOU.

WE MOVE ON TO OTHER
HEADLINES AT THIS HOUR AND FROM
LAS VEGAS NEW DEVELOPMENTS.

WHAT DREW THAT HOTEL SECURITY
GUARD TO THE HOTEL ROOM IN THE
FIRST PLACE AND EVEN THOUGH HE
WAS SHOT THROUGH THE DOOR WAS HE
THE ONE WHO STOPPED MORE
BLOODSHED?

MATT GUTMAN FROM LAS VEGAS
TONIGHT.

WORST MASS SHOOTING IN AMERICAN
HISTORY, LAS VEGAS POLICE
ACKNOWLEDGING THEY STILL DON'T
KNOW WHAT DROVE STEPHEN PADDOCK
TO OPEN FIRE ON THAT HELPLESS
CROWD.

I GET IT.

WE ALL WANT ANSWERS.

WE HAVE LOOKED AT EVERYTHING.

LEARNING THAT HERO SECURITY
GUARD JESUS CAMPOS MAY HAVE
PREVENTED FURTHER BLOODSHED.

POLICE SAY PADDOCK HAD BEEN
SHOOTING WHEN CAMPOS ARRIVED ON
DOOR ALARM.

WE BELIEVE HE WAS SHOOTING
INTO THE CROWD, AND THEN THE
SECURITY GUARD WAS SHOT DURING
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE FRANTIC
EFFORTS TO SAVE THE VICTIMS.

48-YEAR-OLD DOUG CARTER WAS
ATTENDING THE CONCERT WITH HIS
WIFE AND SON.

BUT THEY BECAME SEPARATED IN THE
CHAOS.

YOU SEE DOUG HERE DAZED AND
STAGGERING, A BULLET IN HIS ARM.

THE MAN TAKING THIS VIDEO RAY
PAGE TAKES HIM TO A MAKE-SHIFT
TRIAGE CENTER.

STAND RIGHT HERE.

HE'S IN SHOCK.

HEAR HIM MUMBLE ABOUT HIS GUT.

I GOT MY GUT HURTS THOUGH.

HELPING HIM PULL UP HIS SHIRT
THAT LIGHT ILLUMINATES ANOTHER
BULLET HOLE IN HIS CHEST.

I DO GOT ONE?

YEAH.

COMFORTING HIM, KEEPING HIM
CALM.

RAY PAGE THEN GOES TO GET HIS
TRUCK.

I'M GOING TO TRY TO FIND A
MEDIC.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

VICTIMS PILING INTO HIS PICKUP.

RAY PAGE DELIVERING DOUG AND THE
OTHERS TO SAFETY.

AND IT WOULD BE 14 AGONIZING
HOURS UNTIL DOUG WAS REUNITED
WITH HIS FAMILY.

DID YOU KNOW HE WAS HIT?

I HAD NO IDEA UNTIL 1200 THE
NEXT DAY WHEN WE FOUND HIM IN
THE HOSPITAL.

THANKFUL TO THE HEROES WHO SAVED
HIS DAD.

JUST AMAZING THERE WAS
SOMEBODY THERE TO HELP MY DAD
AND HE WAS -- I THOUGHT HE WAS
ON THE STREET SOMEWHERE.

I HAD NO IDEA.

MATT POLICE ARE CALLING THAT
SECURITY GUARD A TRUE HERO.

POLICE ARE SAYING AS THAT GUARD
NEARED THE DOOR IT DIVERTED HIS
ATTENTION FROM THE CROWD TO THE
HALLWAY.

HE BEGAN FIRING WILDLY INTO IT
INJURING THAT SECURITY GUARD.

SOMEHOW THAT GUARD MANAGED TO
GET AWAY AND ALERT AUTHORITIES.

HE'S BEING HAILED AS A HERO AS
THE CITY CONTINUES TO MOURN.

THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE HERE AT THIS MEMORIAL
SITE ALL DAY DAVID.

ALSO TONIGHT, WHAT WAS
WRITTEN ON A NOTE FOUND IN THE
GUNMAN'S HOTEL ROOM AS WE
LEARNED HOW MUCH THE GUNMAN MADE
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK
AND THE MILLIONS HE MADE IN JUST
ONE YEAR.

HERE'S BRIAN ROSS.

TO THE US FROM THE PHILIPPINES
TWO DAYS AGO, BUT TONIGHT
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE PUT A
CLOSE WATCH ON MARILOU DANLEY TO
MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T TRY TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY AS THEY
STRUGGLE TO FIND THE MOTIVE
BEHIND HER BOYFRIEND'S CRIME.

WE HAVE NO CREDIBLE
INFORMATION TO REPORT TO YOU AS
TO MOTIVATION.

POLICE SAY THEY ARE SKEPTICAL OF
DANLEY'S CLAIMS THAT SHE KNEW
NOTHING ABOUT THE PLANS OF HER
LONGTIME BOYFRIEND
STEPHEN PADDOCK.

BUT A FAMILY FRIEND WHO VISITED
THEM IN NEVADA SAY THAT COULD
WELL BE TRUE, THAT SHE WAS
SUBSERVIENT TO HIM.

IT'S NOT WHAT I SAW AS A
LOVING, CARING RELATIONSHIP.

AN AUSTRALIAN TV STATION HE
SPENT A WEEK WITH THE COUPLE IN
NEVADA IN 2015, STAYING WITH
THEM IN A LUXURY CASINO SUITE,
AND LATER AT HIS HOME, WHERE
PADDOCK SHOWED OFF WHAT HE
CALLED HIS GUN ROOM.

HE WAS VERY STRICT AND VERY
FIRM ON THE FACT THAT IT IS A
RIGHT, IT IS A CAPACITY, AND IT
IS THE FREEDOM OF EVERY AMERICAN
RESIDENT AND PERSON TO
PARTICIPATE, TO OWN A GUN AND
USE IT AS SEEN FIT WHEN NEED BE.

AND THAT LAW SHOULD NEVER BE
CHANGED.

AUTHORITIES CONFIRMED REPORTS
THE SHOOTER LEFT BEHIND SOME
KIND OF A NOTE, WHICH
AUTHORITIES SAY CONTAINED A
SERIES OF CRYPTIC NUMBERS, BUT
WAS NOT A SUICIDE NOTE.

OFFICIALS ARE TRACKING EVERY
ASPECT OF HIS LIFE, BACK TO HIGH
SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES AND
EARLIER, AND HIS RECENT
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VALIUM.

WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY
ASPECT FROM BIRTH TO DEATH OF
THIS SUSPECT IN THIS CASE.

BEFORE THE SHOOTING, OFFICIALS
TELL ABC NEWS HE WAS IN THE
COMPANY OF PROSTITUTES AND WENT
GAMBLING IN THE MANDALAY BAY
CASINO, WINNING BIG JACKPOTS ON
BOTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS.

BRIAN YOU WERE SAYING
STEPHEN PADDOCK CALLED HIMSELF A
PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER.

AND YOU'RE LEARNING HOW MUCH HE
MADE IN ONE YEAR ALONE?

IN THE YEAR 2015 HE REPORTED
INCOME OF $5 MILLION.

AND NO MOTIVE?

THAT'S RIGHT.

BRIAN, THANKS.

I HOPE EVERYONE WILL JOIN US FOR
AN ABC NEWS "20/20" DOCUMENTARY
PRESENTATION ON THE LAS VEGAS
MASSACRE, HEARTBREAK AND HEROES.

WE HAVE NEW REPORTING TONIGHT AT
1000 EASTERN/9:00 CENTRAL.

IN THE MEANTIME, NEXT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT PRESIDENT
TRUMP RAISING NEW QUESTIONS
AFTER WHAT HE SAID DURING A
PHOTO-OP SUMMONING REPORTERS
TELLING THEM THIS WAS THE CALM
BEFORE THE STORM.

CECELIA VEGA ASKING THE WHITE
HOUSE WHAT DID HE MEAN.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SUMMONED
REPORTERS TO SEE -- THE
PRESIDENT SMILING, SURROUNDED BY
HIS TOP MILITARY LEADERS AND
THEIR SPOUSES.

THEN CAME THE UNSOLICITED,
CRYPTIC COMMENT.

DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT THIS
REPRESENTS?

TELL US, SIR.

MAYBE IT'S THE CALM BEFORE
THE STORM.

WHAT'S THE STORM?

COULD BE THE CALM -- THE CALM
BEFORE THE STORM.

WHAT STORM, MR. PRESIDENT?

WE HAVE THE WORLD'S GREAT
MILITARY PEOPLE.

I WILL TELL YOU THAT.

THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

THANK YOU.

WHAT STORM MR. PRESIDENT?

YOU'LL FIND OUT.

MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DID YOU
MEAN BY "CALM BEFORE THE STORM"?

YESTERDAY WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY
PAUSE --
 YOU'LL FIND OUT.

ESPECIALLY OMINOUS AS THE UNITEO
ST
WORDS WITH NORTH KOREA, AND THE
PRESIDENT IS ON THE VERGE OF
DECERTIFYING THE NUCLEAR DEAL
WITH IRAN.

WAS HE REFERRING TO MILITARY
ACTION WHEN HE SAID CALM BEFORE
THE STORM?

WE'RE NEVER GOING TO SAY IN
ADVANCE WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO DO.

HOW SERIOUSLY SHOULD THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC OR AMERICAN
ADVERSARIES FOR THAT MATTER TAKE
THESE COMMENTS?

IS HE SERIOUS?

I THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE
PRESIDENT PROTECTING THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ALWAYS EXTREMELY
SERIOUS AND IF HE FEELS THAT
ACTION IS NECESSARY, HE'LL TAKE
IT.

CECELIA VEGA PRESSING THE
WHITE HOUSE TODAY.

IN THE MEANTIME, WE ALSO KNOW
THE ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING
FORWARD TODAY ON A ROLLBACK OF
AN OBAMACARE MANDATE REQUIRING
EMPLOYEE COVERAGE OF BIRTH
CONTROL, 55 MILLION WOMEN HAVE
ACCESS TO WITHOUT A COPAYMENT
LONGER OFFER THESE INSURANCE
PLANS THAT COVER BIRTH CONTROL.

IF THEY CLAIM IT VIOLATES
MORAL CONVICTIONS OR
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS IT TAKES
EFFECT IMMEDIATELY.

DEMOCRATS ARE CALLING THIS A NEW
LOW AND REPUBLICANS ARE CHEERING
THIS AS THE PRESIDENT MAKING
GOOD ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE.
