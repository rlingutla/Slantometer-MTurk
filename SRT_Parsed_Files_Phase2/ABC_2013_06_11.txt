THIS IS "WORLD NEWS."

TONIGHT ON THE RUN.

HOW ONE YOUNG MAN GOT HIS HANDS
ON MANY OF THE NATION'S TOP
SECRETS.

HE IS ON THE MOVE TONIGHT.

HOW DANGEROUS IS IT?

ON THE GROUND TORNADOS
SPEEDING THROUGH KENTUCKY,
WASHINGTON D.C., BRACING FOR
TWISTERS, TOO.

ON TRIAL, IT BEGINS, GEORGE
ZIMMERMAN ACCUSED OF MURDERING
TRAYVON MARTIN AMID A DEBATE
ABOUT RACE, GUNFIRE AND JUSTICE.

GOOD EVENING ON THIS MONDAY
NIGHT.

WE BEGIN WITH ONE YOUNG AMERICAN
MAN WHO SAYS HE HAS CONTROL OF A
LOT OF THE NATION'S SECRETS
TONIGHT.

EDWARD SNOWDEN, THE 29-YEAR-OLD
WHISTLE BLOWER BEHIND THAT
MASSIVE INTELLIGENCE BREACH AT
THE NSA.

TONIGHT HE SAID HE'S A
TARGET AND ON THE MOVE, HIDDEN
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SHROUDED IN
MYSTERY AND DRAMA.

BRIAN ROSS HAS THE LATEST ON WHO
HE IS AND WHAT ELSE HE HAS.

BRIAN.

SCRAMBLING TO FIND HIM THERE ARE
REPORTS HE'S PREPARING TO MAKE
PUBLIC EVEN MORE OF THE NATION'S
MOST CLOSELY GUARDED SECRETS.

UNTIL HE CHECKED OUT SOME TIME
TODAY, EDWARD SNOWDEN HAS BEEN
HOLED UP IN LUXURY FOR THREE
WEEKS IN HONG KONG AT THE MEARA
HOTEL, ACCORDING TO EMPLOYEES
THERE.

BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT, EVERY MEAL
CAME FROM ROOM SERVICE, PILL
OH,S STUFFED UNDER THE DOOR TO
PREVENT EAVES DROPPING, AND HE
USED THE CODE NAME VERAX, LATIN
FOR TRUTH TELLER TO COMMUNICATE
WITH THE WASHINGTON POST.

HE TOLD THE GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER
HE KNEW THE U.S. WOULD BE COMING
AFTER HIM, MAYBE EVEN WITH HIT
TEAMS.

THAT'S A FEAR I'LL LIVE UNDER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE, HOWEVER
LONG THAT HAPPENS TO BE.

HE'S BEING PURSUED BECAUSE HE
REVEALED SECRETS USED TO TRACK
TERRORISTS.

LEAKS OF SENSITIVE CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION THAT CAUSE HARM TO
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY INTEREST
ARE A PROBLEM.

NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE
SURVEILLANCE AND COLLECTIONS
THEIR GOVERNMENT IS CARRYING
OUT.

THE NSA SPECIFICALLY TARGETS
THE COMMUNICATIONS OF EVERYONE.

IT INGESTS THEM BY DEFAULT.

UNDER SUSPICION UNTIL HE
DISAPPEARED FROM HIS JOB AS A
TECHNICIAN AT THE NSA IN HAWAII
MEDICAL LEAVE FOR EP LEPSY.

NEIGHBORS SAID HE VANISHED ONE
DAY.

ONE DAY HE WAS THERE, THE
NEXT HE WAS GONE.

MARYLAND DECLINED TO COMMENT BUT
A NEIGHBOR SAID HE WAS ALWAYS AT
HIS COMPUTER AS A YOUNG MAN.

I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING SCHOOL
WORK AND COME TO FIND OUT HE
DIDN'T EVEN GRADUATE FROM HIGH
SCHOOL.

SNOWDEN CLAIMED HE HAD QUITE THE
TOP SECRET RESUME FOR SOMEONE
WHO DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

STARTING WITH NSA SECURITY
GUARD, FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF
FAILED ATTEMPT TO BECOME A
SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER.

THEN A HUGE JUMP, A CIA SPY IN
SWITZERLAND WORKING WITH
COMPUTERS.

THEN FOUR YEARS AS A CIVILIAN
CONTRACTOR WORKING WITH
COMPUTERS AT THE NSA IN JAPAN,
WASHINGTON AND HAWAII WHERE HE
SAYS HE DECIDED TO BLOW THE
WHISTLE ON WHAT HE CALLS THE
ABUSE OF THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF
AMERICA.

I SITTING AT MY DESK
CERTAINLY HAVE THE AUTHORITIES
TO WIRE TAP ANYONE FROM YOU OR
YOUR ACCOUNTANT TO A FEDERAL
JUDGE TO EVEN A PRESIDENT IF I
HAD A PERSONAL E-MAIL.

IS SNOWDEN HAS APPARENTLY WITH
HIM MORE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS
INCLUDING THE NAMES OF HUNDREDS
OF SECRET AGENTS.

HE SAYS HE CHOSE TO GO TO HONG
KONG BECAUSE IT HAS A HISTORY OF
ALLOWING FREE SPEECH.

DIANE, IT ALSO HAS AN
EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE U.S.
 WHAT DO INTELLIGENCE
OFFICIALS SAY TO YOU ABOUT
SOMEONE OF THAT RANK WITH ACCESS
TO THOSE TOP SECRETS?

IT TURNS OUT HE IS ABOUT ONE
OF 850,000 PRIVATE CONTRACTORS
WHO HAVE SUCH TOP SECRET
CLEARANCE.

THAT'S PART OF A GROWING PROBLEM
UNDERSCORED BY THIS CASE IN
WHICH WHEN EVERYTHING IS SECRET
IT'S HARD TO KEEP THE TRUE AND
IMPORTANT SECRETS SECRET.

850,000.

THANK YOU, BRIAN ROSS, REPORTING
IN TONIGHT.

NOW WE TURN TO THAT OUTBREAK
OF SEVERE WEATHER WE'VE BEEN
WATCHING ACROSS THE EAST.

WE WANT TO BRING YOU THE LATEST
REPORTS RIGHT NOW, FLASH FLOOD
WARNINGS AND REPORTS OF TORNADOS
TOUCHING DOWN.

HERE'S ABC'S DAVID KERLEY.

TONIGHT 40 MILES NORTH OF
NASHVILLE JUST ACROSS THE
BOARDER HITTING ADAIRVILLE,
KENTUCKY.

THIS JUST WENT OVERTOP OF US.

FUNNEL FORMATION OF THIS TORNADO
WHICH BLEW OVER THE SMALL TOWN.

ONE OFFICIAL TOLD US TWO ELDERLY
LADIES RODE OUT THE STORM
HUDDLED IN A BATHTUB.

THEIR HOUSE IS DESTROYED, BUT
THEY BOTH SURVIVED WITH MINOR
INJURIES, TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL
AND RELEASED.

IT STILL LEFT ITS MARK.

WE HAD A TORNADO COME
THROUGH, DAMAGED FIVE TO SEVEN
HOUSES, PRETTY WELL DESTROYED
SEVERAL BARNS AND BUILDINGS.

NOBODY WAS INJURED SERIOUSLY.

OUT AND BELONGINGS MOVED OUT OF
DAMAGED BUILDINGS, FIREFIGHTERS
LENDING A HAND.

TONIGHT KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE,
A LARGE PART OF THE MID ATLANTIC
AS WELL ARE EXPECTING STRONG
THUNDERSTORMS.

THIS YEAR'S TORNADO SEASON
STARTED LATE BUT IT HAS BEEN A
MONTH TO REMEMBER, THE
DEVASTATION AND DEATH IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA AND JUST 11 DAYS LATER,
THE WIDEST PATH OF DESTRUCTION
ON RECORD.

THOSE ARE SUCTION BORDERS
GOING AROUND THE EDGE.

TORNADO MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF
MILES AT ITS WIDEST SPOT.

OH, MY GOD, THAT IS HUGE.

FAR FROM THE END OF TORNADO
SEASON.

DAVID KERLEY, ABC NEWS,
WASHINGTON.

NOW WE TURN TO THAT HIGH
PROFILE MURDER TRIAL.

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN ACCUSED OF
MURDERING TRAYVON MARTIN.

TODAY IT BEGAN WITH LAWYERS
PROBING THE SECRET FEELINGS OF
PROSPECTIVE JURORS ABOUT RACE,
BIAS AND CRIME.

MATT GUTMAN WHO BROKE A LOT OF
NEWS ON THIS CASE FROM THE START
WAS BACK IN THE COURTROOM TODAY.

AFTER A SINGLE GUNSHOT IN THE
TINY COMMUNITY TRIGGERED A
NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT RACE,
PROSPECTIVE JURORS IN THE GEORGE
ZIMMERMAN MURDER TRIAL WERE
ASKED THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION.

IS THERE ANY QUESTION IN YOUR
MIND YOU CAN BE FAIR?

NO QUESTION.

ZIMMERMAN, A WHITE HISPANIC
WATCHMAN SHOT 17-YEAR-OLD
TRAYVON MARTIN IN 2012.

FOR WEEKS NATIONAL PROTESTS AND
A WAVE OF HIGH SCHOOL WALKOUTS
GRIPPED THE NATION, EVEN
GRABBING THE ATTENTION OF THE
PRESIDENT.

IF I HAD A SON HE WOULD LOOK
LIKE TRAYVON.

THIS MORNING THE FIRST 100
MARCHED THROUGH THE DOORS
FILLING OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THIS
CASE.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU'RE
LIKE A BLANK SLATE.

TRYING TO WEED OUT JURORS WHO
ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS,
TALKING WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

WHAT SIGNS DO THEY TAKE?

THE CHILD, OF COURSE HE WAS A
CHILD.

LAWYERS GRAPPLING WITH THE
THORNY ISSUE OF RACIAL BIAS IN
THE JURY POOL.

WHAT LETS THE PROSECUTION OR
THE DEFENSE KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS
BIASSED?

THEY MAY BE SUBTLE BUT
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE SIGNS IS
WHAT ORGANIZATIONS DO YOU BELONG
TO AND ARE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS
ORGANIZATIONS THAT IN THE PAST
HAVE EXCLUDED MINORITIES.

LAST YEAR'S TENSION REMAINS
HIGH AS IS THE THREAT FOR BOTH
FAMILIES TANGLED UP IN THE
SHOOTING.

THE MARTIN'S.

PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOUR KIDS
AND FAMILY MEMBERS BY NAME?

YES.

AND THE ZIMMERMANS.

WE HAVE DEATH THREATS
DIRECTED AT US FOR BEING
GEORGE'S FAMILY.

SELECTION BRINGING BROAD TEDIUM,
LEVITY AND ULTIMATELY IN A FEW
WEEKS, SIX JURORS WHO WILL
DECIDE ZIMMERMAN'S FATE.

MATT GUTMAN, FLORIDA.

UP NEXT AN UPDATE ON THE
SHOOTING IN CALIFORNIA.

WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE
MAN POLICE SUSPECT OF KILLING
FIVE PEOPLE.

23-YEAR-OLD JOHN ZAWAHRI.

THAT'S HIS HIGH SCHOOL YEAR BOOK
PHOTO AND HERE IN SURVEILLANCE
PHOTOS, DRESSED IN BLACK
CARRYING A SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE
AS HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AT
SANTA MONICA COLLEGE.

THE LOS ANGELES TIMES SAYS HE
HAD MENTAL PROBLEMS BUT ABC NEWS
LEARNED INVESTIGATORS DO NOT
BELIEVE HE WAS ON RECORD WITH A
CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS, SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED HIM
FROM BUYING A FIREARM.

WE HEAD OVERSEAS NEXT TO
SOUTH AFRICA WHERE NELSON
MANDELLA IS SPENDING HIS THIRD
DAY IN THE HOSPITAL BATTLING A
RECURRENT LUNG INFECTION, THE
94-YEAR-OLD SAID TO BE IN
SERIOUS BUT STABLE CONDITION.

TODAY HIS EX-WIFE, WINNIE, CAME
TO SEE HIM.

TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH
AFRICA CALLING ON HIS COUNTRYMEN
PRAY FOR NELSON MANDELLA'S
RECOVERY.

IN LONDON PRINCE PHILIP
FROM HIS HOSPITAL BED RECOVERING
FROM EXPLORATORY SURGERY ON HIS
ABDOMEN.

HIS BIRTHDAY GIFT, A 25-MINUTE
VISIT FROM THE QUEEN WHO ARRIVED
HOLDING A BIRTHDAY CARD
ADDRESSED TO HIM.

WE HAVE A HEADLINE TONIGHT
FOR ANYONE WITH A SMART PHONE.

WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE HUGE SPIKE
IN CRIME CAUSED BY THIEVES
LAST YEAR 1.6 MILLION AMERICANS
HAD THEIR SMART PHONES STOLEN.

POLICE PUSHED PHONE COMPANIES TO
COME UP WITH A WAY TO DETER
THEFT.

TODAY APPLE REVEALED A NEW IDEA.

ABC'S GIO BENITEZ ON WHAT THEY
ANNOUNCED.

BE TAKING A PAGE FROM MISSION
IMPOSSIBLE.

THIS TAPE WILL SELF-DESTRUCT
IN FIVE SECONDS.

SELF-DESTRUCT?

PERHAPS NOT PHYSICALLY BUT AT
THE COMPANY'S BIG UNVEILING THIS
AFTERNOON, A SOLUTION THAT LAW
ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN BEGGING
FOR, A SO CALLED KILL SWITCH
INTO A USELESS BOX, IT COULD BE
THE STRONGEST WEAPON YET TO
THEFTS.

THEFTS HAVE BECOME SUCH A
PROBLEM, THERE'S EVEN A TERM FOR
IT, APPLE PICKING, A 40%
INCREASE IN
THEFTS JUST LAST YEAR.

LOOK AT THIS DRAMATIC
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO FROM A NEW
YORK SUBWAY IN MARCH.

POLICE SAY THIS MAN TURNED TO
VIOLENCE JUST TO STEAL A CELL
PHONE.

THIS WOMAN KNOCKED OVER AND
PUNCHED SPEAKING TO LINSEY
DAVIS.

THE GUY SNATCHED THE PHONE
OUT OF MY HAND AND KEPT RUNNING.

PHONE'S CURRENT SOFTWARE CALLED
TRACK A LOST PHONE.

NOW WITH ACTIVATION LOCK, IF
A THIEF TRIES TO TURN OFF FIND
THE DEVICE ENTIRELY, THEY WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO REACTIVATE IT.

THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN
CALLING ON TECH COMPANIES TO
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF SMART
PHONES THEFT.

THE IDEA THAT, SURE YOU CAN
TRACK YOUR PHONE BUT WHEN
SOMEONE STEALS THE PHONE THE
ROBBER OR THIEF CAN START USING
IT.

APPLE HAS COME UP WITH A FEATURE
THAT WON'T ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

OTHER CELL PHONE MAKERS TO SEE
IF THEY FOLLOW APPLE'S LEAD.

GIO BENITEZ, ABC NEWS, NEW YORK.

AMERICA'S CREDIT RATING
BATTLING BACK TONIGHT.

REMEMBER THE U.S. WAS STRIPPED
OF ITS AAA RATING BY STANDARD
AND POOR NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO
IN THE HEAT OF THE BATTLE OVER
THE DEBT CEILING.

TODAY STANDARD AND POOR RAISED
THE OUTLOOK FROM NEGATIVE TO
STABLE.

S&P CITING SMALLER DEFICITS AND
BETTER COOPERATION IN
WASHINGTON.

THE ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO GET
A BIG BOOST, THE AUTO INDUSTRY
REV BE UP FOR A LOT OF NEW HIRE,
CAR MAKERS IN DETROIT LOOKING
FOR ENGINEERS, TECHNICIANS AND
FACTORY WORKERS.

35,000 WORKERS EXPECTED TO JOIN
THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR AS AUTO
SALES ARE EXPECTED TO SOAR IN
2013 UP TO MORE THAN 15 MILLION
VEHICLES WHICH WOULD BE THE
HIGHEST IN SIX YEARS.

STILL AHEAD HERE ON "WORLD
NEWS," AN AMERICAN SECRET SO
MANY COUPLES SLEEP APART TO GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST.

IS IT REALLY YOUR SPOUSE'S
FAULT?

OUR EXPERIMENT EXPLORES HOW TO
SLEEP IN PEACE.

LATER AN URGENT EFFORT TO
SAVE CHEETAHS, CRANES, PANDAS
AND LEOPARDS FROM
EXTINCTION.

YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHERE THIS IS
HAPPENING TONIGHT.

EXTINCTION.

YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHERE THIS IS
HAPPENING TONIGHT.

NOW TONIGHT AN EPIDEMIC NOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE DISCUSS.

THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF AMERICAN COUPLES WHO SAY THEY
CANNOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP IF THEIR
PARTNER IS IN THE SAME BED.

OUR OWN MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR DR.
JENNIFER ASHTON AND HER HUSBAND
DECIDED TO BRING US A REALITY
CHECK, AGREEING TO TAKE US
INSIDE THEIR OWN SLEEP WARS AT
HOME.

MARRIED COUPLES SAY THEY SLEEP
IN SEPARATE BEDS JUST TO GET A
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS
ANYMORE.

I CAN'T SLEEP.

IT USUALLY TURNS OUT TO BE
SOMEONE STOMPING OFF TO THE
COUCH.

I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT I
OFTEN MOVE TO A DIFFERENT ROOM.

SHE SAYS I DISRUPT HER SLEEP.

I SNORE.

IT CAUSES ME TO WAKE UP FROM
MY SLEEP THREE OR FOUR TIMES A
NIGHT.

EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BOTH
DOCTORS, WE HAVE LONG LAUGHED
AND DEBATED WHAT'S REALLY GOING
ON, SO WE CALLED IN PROFESSIONAL
HELP --
 THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE.

SLEEP RESEARCHER,
DR. WENDY TROXEL.

WHAT'S YOUR GOAL HERE?

I WOULD LIKE TO SLEEP NEXT TO
MY HUSBAND EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

SHE PUT US TO THE TEST,
MEASURING OUR BRAIN ACTIVITY
WHILE WE SLEPT.

THE SLEEP STUDY WILL CONFIRM
SCIENTIFICALLY THAT ROB'S
SNORING DISRUPTS MY SLEEP.

SIDE BY SIDE.

SNORING WOKE ME UP.

WITH ROB, I HAD 173 AWAKENINGS,
WHICH IS SLEEP SCIENCE LINGO FOR
COMING OUT OF DEEP SLEEP.

THE NEXT NIGHT COULDN'T COME
SOON ENOUGH.

I GET TO SLEEP BY MYSELF.

BUT TO MY GREAT SURPRISE, ALONE
I HAD 135 AWAKENINGS, NEARLY AS
MANY AS WHEN I SLEPT WITH ROB.

THERE WAS A LINK BETWEEN
ROB'S SNORING AND YOU HAVING
THESE LITTLE AWAKENINGS FROM
SLEEP.

BUT IT WASN'T ALL ROB'S FAULT.

YOU CONTINUED TO HAVE AWAKENINGS
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, EVEN WHEN
ROB HAD STOPPED SNORING.

SCIENCE CONFIRMS WOMEN ARE
LIGHTER SLEEPERS THAN MEN.

BIOLOGICALLY, OUR BRAINS ARE
CONDITIONED TO JUST WAKE UP.

BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS WOMEN ARE
BETTER SLEEPERS THAN MEN AND
QUICKLY FALL BACK ASLEEP AGAIN.

BUT DR. TROXEL SAYS THE BAD NEWS
FOR WOMEN IS WE OFTEN THINK WE
SLEEP WORSE THAN WE REALLY DO.

I WAS PROOF.

THE STUDY ACTUALLY SHOWED MY
OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY WAS
ACTUALLY EXCELLENT BOTH NIGHTS.

YOUR SLEEP WHEN YOU WERE
SLEEPING WITH ROB COMPARED TO
THE NIGHT YOU WERE SLEEPING
ALONE WAS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL.

BIGGER IMPACT.

HE GOT AN EXTRA 20 MINUTES OF
DEEP SLEEP WITH ME BY HIS SIDE.

SO, I AM TELLING YOU THERE IS
ACTUALLY HEALTH BENEFITS, AT
LEAST FOR ROB, TO SLEEPING WITH
YOU.

NOW I FEEL REALLY GUILTY.

BECAUSE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT
MEN
SLEEP BETTER WITH A PARTNER THAN
ALONE, AND PROTECTING SLEEP FOR
BOTH OF US MEANS PROTECTING OUR
MARRIAGE.

REMEMBER IT IS IMPORTANT TO
EXCLUDE MEDICAL CAUSES SUCH AS
SLEEP APNEA WHICH CAN BE
DANGEROUS.

WE KNOW APNEA IS VERY SERIOUS
BUT IS THE REST OF IT ANNOYING?

WHAT'S THE MOOD IN WHICH WE
APPROACH THIS?

TAKE IT SERIOUSLY BUT DON'T
BECOME TOO ANXIOUS OVER A SLEEP
ISSUE.

SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE WORSE THAN
THE POSSIBLE ITSELF.

THANK YOU, DR. ASHTON AND DR.
ASHTON.

THE TWO DOCTORS, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.

COMING UP NEXT, TAKE A CLOSE
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

DOES IT LOOK LIKE A UFO TO YOU?

WE TAKE YOU CLOSER TO A NEW
MYSTERY TONIGHT.

OUR "INSTANT INDEX."

OUR "INSTANT INDEX" TONIGHT
BEGINS WITH A REMINDER.

HUMANS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES TO
SUCCUMB TO TEMPTATION.

POLICE IN FLORIDA CAME TO THE
RESCUE OF THIS LITTLE FAWN, HER
HEAD STUCK IN A BAG OF DORITOS.

SHE WANDERED OVER TO THE POLICE
CAR AND LET THE POLICE REMOVE
THE BAG AND SCAMPERED BACK INTO
THE WOODS.

ONE OFFICER SAID SHE MUST HAVE
REALLY WANTED THAT LAST CHIP IN
THE BOTTOM OF THE BAG.

A TIP OF THE HAT TO CYNDI
LAUPER.

OUR PERSON OF THE WEEK,
SHE TOOK HOME THE TONY FOR KINKY
BOOTS.

SHE TWEETED OUT THIS PICTURE.

LAUPER THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN
THE SOLO AWARD FOR BEST SCORE.

STRAIGHT FROM THE X FILES, A
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THINK THEY
STUMBLED ON A UFO WHILE ON
VACATION.

SNAPSHOTS FROM THEIR TRIP TO THE
NETHERLANDS AND THE FIRST
PICTURES, A CLEAR SKY OVER THE
CASTLE BUT THEN, LOOK, A STRANGE
OBJECT, SMALL FINS IN THE SKY.

HERE IT IS AGAIN COLOR DRAINED
TO HIGHLIGHT THE MYSTERIOUS
OBJECT.

BELIEVERS SAY THOSE PHOTOS PROVE
IT WAS MOVING AT SUPER SONIC
SPEED.

CRITICS SAY IT'S A BUG ON THE
LENS.

COMING UP NEXT, TO THE
RESCUE, THE RACE TO SAVE
CHEETAHS, CRANES, PANDAS, AND
LEOPARDS FROM THE BRINK OF
EXTINCTION.

FINALLY TONIGHT WE'RE GOING
TO TAKE YOU TO A MYSTERIOUS
PLACE DESIGNED TO CREATE MORE
LIFE FOR SOME OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL CREATURES ON EARTH.

COME WITH US, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
TO THE HILLS OF VIRGINIA AND
INSIDE A PASSIONATE RACE AGAINST
TIME WITH ABC'S RON CLAIBORNE.

TO DISAPPEAR.

A 3-MONTH-OLD CLOUDED LEOPARD IS
ONE OF THE LAST OF A VANISHING
BREED.

THIS THREE-MONTH-OLD CUB'S
DAZZLING LIQUID BLUE WILL DARKEN
SOON.

THAT'S ONE OF THE SECRETS OF
THESE MYSTERIOUS CATS -- NATIVE
TO INDONESIA -- THAT ARE BEING
UNLOCKED BY RESEARCHERS AT A
LITTLE-KNOWN ANIMAL CONSERVATION
FACILITY.

THESE CLOUDED LEOPARD CUBS
ARE JUST 100 DAYS OLD.

BROTHER AND SISTER.

VERY SOFT AND VERY FRIENDLY.

I'M ANOTHER LEOPARD.

THE POPULATION OF CLOUDED
LEOPARDS IN THE WILD HAS BEEN
DECIMATED BY HUNTERS AND
POACHERS.

BUT HERE, SCIENTISTS ARE
STUDYING THESE ANIMALS TO TRY TO
SAVE THEM.

ONE THING THEY'VE LEARNT --
THE HIGHER THE TREES THEY'VE GOT
TO CLIMB, THE LOWER THE CATS'
STRESS LEVELS.

AND THAT HELPS THEM BREED.

SO FAR, THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY
RAISED 80 OF THESE MAGNIFICENT
CATS.

MANY OF THESE EXOTIC ANIMALS
WILL EVENTUALLY BE RETURNED TO
NATURE.

LIKE THESE MONTH-OLD BABY
BLACK-FOOTED FERRETS.

ONCE ALL BUT WIPED OUT, THE
INSTITUTE HAS BRED AND RELEASED
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

THEY CAN END UP IN ARIZONA,
KANSAS.

BUT THEY'LL BE IN THE WILD?

THEY'LL BE IN THE WILD.

OPEN SPACE.

THERE ARE PANDAS, CRANES.

WHEN IT COMES TO ALL THESE
ANIMALS, THE ONE COMMON
DENOMINATOR IS LOSS OF HABITAT.

TIME.

RON CLAIBORNE, ABC NEWS.

IT'S GREAT TO BEGIN THE WEEK
WITH YOU.

WE'RE ALWAYS THERE AT ABC
NEWS.COM, "NIGHTLINE" LATER AND
I'LL SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW
NIGHT.

GOOD NIGHT.
