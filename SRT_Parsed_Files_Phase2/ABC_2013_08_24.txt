THIS IS WORLD NEWS TONIGHT,
AMERICA WARSHIPS AT THE READY.

WILL THERE BE ACTION AT THE NEW
TROUBLING IMAGES FROM SYRIA
TONIGHT.

THE PRESIDENT HUDDLING WITH
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, DOCTORS
ON THE GROUND TREATING THOUSANDS
OF PATIENTS, REVEALING THE
SYMPTOMS  TONIGHT.

ABC'S MARTHA RADDATZ STANDING BY
IN THE REGION.

YOSEMITE ON FIRE.

OUR TEAM INSIDE THE PARK
TONIGHT.

HOW CLOSE ARE THE FLAMES TO
SITES.

A MAJOR CITY, THAT FIRE
THREATENING POWER AND WATER.

REMEMBER THE DREAM.

TONIGHT THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON
50 YEARS AFTER THE REVEREND
MARTIN LUTHER KING MADE THAT
DREAM FIRST.

HOW HIS "I HAVE A DREAM" SPEECH
IS BEING KEPT ALIVE.

AND AN AMERICAN VOICE SILENCED.

♪ YOU'RE NO GOOD, BABY YOU'RE NO
GOOD ♪
 SINGER LINDA ROSTADT
REVEALED, THE CONDITION THAT HAS
STOLEN HER VOICE.

GOOD EVENING, GREAT TO HAVE
YOU WITH US ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.

WE BEGIN WITH THAT GROWING
URGENCY OVER SYRIA.

AMERICAN WARSHIPS BEING
REPOSITIONED, WHAT IS COMING
NEXT?

PRESIDENT OBAMA IN A RARE WHITE
HOUSE MEETING WITH HIS NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISORS TODAY.

THIS PROMPTED THE MEETING.

GROWING PROOF THAT CHEMICAL
WEAPONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED TO
KILL MORE THAN 1,000 IN SYRIA,
AMONG THEM SO MANY CHILDREN.

TONIGHT VOLUNTEERS, DOCTORS
WITHOUT BORDERS, INSIDE SYRIA,
TREATING PATIENTS.

NOW REVEALING THE SYMPTOMS THEY
ARE TREATING.

SAYING MORE THAN 3,000 PATIENTS
WERE RUSHED IN WITH WHAT THEY
CALL NEUROTOXIN SYMPTOMS,
SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'D SEE IN A
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE THEY SAY
DIED.

TONIGHT HERE THREE URGENT
QUESTIONS, IS AMERICA ABOUT TO
GET INVOLVED?

WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

ABC'S CLEAVE GLOBAL AFFAIRS
CORRESPONDENT MARTHA RADDATZ
REPORTS FROM THE REGION ON THE
CRIS THIS SYRIA.

MARTH RA.

DAVID.

AS WE STAND HERE TONIGHT, U.S.

WARSHIPS ARE BEING REPOSITIONED
VERY NEARBY IN CASE OF A
MILITARY AIR STRIKE ON SYRIA.

TONIGHT, EVIDENCE OF A CHEMICAL
ATTACK IN SYRIA IS MOUNTING.

NEW IMAGES SHOWING THE HORROR.

THE PRESIDENT SPENT THE DAY
HUDDLED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH
HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM,
WEIGHING THE EVIDENCE AND HIS
MILITARY OPTIONS.

WE'RE GATHERING INFORMATION
ABOUT THIS EVENT.

BUT IT'S VERY TROUBLESOME.

ON THE TABLE, TARGETING SYRIAN
MILITARY OR GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS
WITH MISSILES, FOUR NAVY
WARSHIPS ARE ALREADY IN THE
MEDITERRANEAN LOADED WITH
TOMAHAWK MISSILES.

U.S.

FIGHTER JETS COULD ALSO
ATTACK FIRING FROM OUTSIDE
SYRIAN AIR SPACE, SOAPY LOTS
WOULD BE OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN
FORTHCOMING IN SAYING THAT RISK
MUST BE LOW.

WE CANNOT RISK GETTING
SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN HURT.

AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET PULLED
INTO ANOTHER QUAGMIRE IN THE
UNTIL THE U.S.

CONFIRMS THE
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

TODAY SYRIAN STATE TV CLAIMS THE
REBELS WERE BEHIND THE ATTACK.

ABANDONING THE POSITION THAT NO
CHEMICAL ATTACK OCCURRED.

UN OFFICIALS IN SYRIA ARE
PUSHING FOR ACCESS TO THE SITE
FOR INSPECTION.

THE GROUP DOCTORS WITHOUT
BORDERS SAID TODAY, THAT 3600
PATIENTS WITH NEUROTOXIC
SYMPTOMS WERE TREATED THE DAY OF
THE SUSPECTED ATTACK.

THEY SAY 355 OF THOSE PATIENTS
DIED.

DAVID, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
VERY RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE IN
SYRIA.

BUT WITH THESE URGENT MEETINGS,
AND HIS STRONG LANGUAGE, IT
SUGGESTS HE MAY BE CHANGING HIS
MIND.

DAVID.

MARTHA RADDATZ LEADING OFF.

THANK YOU.

ONE MORE NOTE ON THIS TONIGHT.

THE WHITE HOUSE REVEALING THE
PRESIDENT DID SPEAK WITH BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON
TODAY.

THE SUBJECT WAS SYRIA AND
POSSIBLE RESPONSES BY THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO THE
USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT TONIGHT
MARTHA WILL ANCHOR AB'S CHRIS
WEEK FROM THE REGION FIRST THING
TOMORROW MORNING.

WE MOVE ON TONIGHT TO THE OTHER
URGENT HEADLINE HERE, THE WILD
FIRE NOW SPREADING IN YOSEMITE
NATIONAL PARK.

A STATE OF EMERGENCY NOW FOR SAN
FRANCISCO, THEIR WATER COMES
FROM YOSEMITE.

TONIGHT OUR TEAM INSIDE THE
PARK, THE FIRE ALMOST COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTROL.

THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ALERT,
THEIR HOMES THREATENED, STUNNED
BY THE SPEED OF THE FIRE.

AND LOOK AT THIS TONIGHT.

THE VIEW FROM SPACE.

THE WILD FIRES SO BIG, THE SMOKE
CLEARLY VISIBLE THERE.

TONIGHT WE ASK ABC'S NEIL
KARLINSKY HOW CLOSE THE FIRE IS
TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS SITES
INSIDE YOSEMITE.

FROM THE EDGE OF THIS ANGRY
FIRE, HERE'S A FLARE UP FROM THE
LAST TEN MINUTES OR SO.

WE'RE JUST BACK FROM DOWN THE
ROAD HERE INSIDE YOSEMITE, WHERE
WE GOT AN UP CLOSE LOOK AT
EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE PARK.

YOSEMITE IS BURNING, THESE ARE
THE FIRST PICTURES INSIDE THE
PARK OF FIREFIGHTERS MASSING TO
KEEP THE DAMAGE TO A MINIMUM AT
ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST PRISTINE
TREASURES.

WE'RE IN YOSEMITE.

THIS IS EVERYONE'S WORST FEARS.

A FIRE IN YOSEMITE.

I'VE BEEN HERE FOUR DAYS,
IT'S JUST BEEN GOING AND GOING
AND GOING.

IT'S JUST NONSTOP.

WATERFALLS AND PEEKS IS STILL
OPEN.

AND THE CONCERN IS REAL.

WE ARE HERE TO STOP THE FIRE
FROM GETTING WORSE THAN IT IS
RIGHT NOW.

IF IT PICKS UP INTENSITY, WE'LL
KNOCK IT DOWN TO KEEP IT FROM
GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF
EMERGENCY FOR THE CITY OF SAN
FRAN, 150 MILES AWAY, BECAUSE
THE POWER LINES THAT FEED THE
CITY COULD BE CUT OFF BY THE
FIRE.

WATER IS AN ISSUE AS WELL.

WE TRAVELED TO THE MASSIVE
RESERVOIR INSIDE YOSEMITE, WHICH
PROVIDES 85% OF SAN FRANCISCO'S
WATER.

THE CONCERN EVIDENCE IN THESE
PICTURES, THAT ASH AND DEBRIS
WILL POLEUTE THE WATER.

OFFICIALS SAY THE SIZE OF THE
FIRE HASN'T ACTUALLY CHANGED
THAT MUCH.

IT'S THE INTENSITY.

STILL THERE ARE EVACUATIONS
UNDERWAY AND ONE SMALL PIECE OF
GOOD NEWS.

THE FIRE IS NOW ABOUT 5%
CONTAINED.

THAT'S NOT MUCH.

BUT IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THE 1%
THEY HAD JUST A DAY AGO.

DAVID.

5%, NEIL, A LONG WAY TO GO.

GINGER ZEE IS WITH US HERE AT
THE DESK.

YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS AS
WELL.

THE FIRE FORECAST TONIGHT.

THE HUMIDITY IS LOW IN THESE
PLACES, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO
GET A LOT OF HELP, ESPECIALLY BY
THE COLD FRONT THAT IS FLIPPING
DOWN FROM THE NORTHWEST.

DAVID, YOU SEE HOW IT COMES IN.

THE LIGHTNING COMES WITH IT.

YOU GET THUNDERSTORMS.

THE WINDS HIT THE GROUND.

THEY GUST AND MAKE THE FIRES
EVEN MORE ERRATIC THAN THEY
ALREADY ARE.

WHAT ABOUT THE MOISTURE TO
THE SOUTH OF THERE, THERE WAS
SOME THOUGHT MAYBE IT WOULD
HELP.

YEAH.

IT'S NOT GOING TO.

THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE NOW.

EVO NO THREAT TO LAND AND
WEAKENING.

THIS IS THE PATH.

STAYS OFFSHORE.

WE'RE STILL GOING TO SEE PIECES
OF MOISTURE, THAT TROPICAL AIR
REALLY RISING INTO A SATURATED
SOUTHWEST.

AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT, YOU
GET ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS, THAT
COULD DROP REALLY HEAVY RAINS.

WE'RE TALKING ONE TO TWO INCHES
PER HOUR.

AND IN PLACES LIKE THIS, THEY DO
NOT DO WELL.

FROM LAS VEGAS, SAN DIEGO,
PHOENIX, NOT AS WELL AT ALL WITH
THAT TYPE OF HEAVY RAIN.

YOU SEE WHERE YOSEMITE'S FIRE
IS, NOT IN THE RAIN ZONE.

ALL THE WAY AROUND IT.

BUT NOT WHERE IT'S NEEDED.

THANK YOU.

TO WASHINGTON TONIGHT, TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS
MARCHED ON THE NATIONAL MALL TO
THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL TO REMEMBER
A DREAM.

IT WAS INSPIRED BY THIS HISTORIC
MARCH BACK IN 1963.

THAT LANDMARK EVENT IN THE CIVIL
RIGHTS MOVEMENT, SOME 50 YEARS
AGO.

THAT LED TO SO MANY CHANGES.

AND TODAY, ALL OF THESE YEARS
LATER, SO MANY STILL DETERMINED
TO FINISH THAT WORK.

TODAY THEY MARCHED AGAIN STILL
INSPIRED BY THOSE STIRRING WORDS
FROM DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

I HAVE A DREAM.

BANNER, AND HER MEMORIES.

THAT LITTLE GIRL'S FACE NOW
RECREATED ON THE WALL AT BEN'S
CHILI BOWL RESTAURANT IN

THE WORDS ON THE SIGNS ARE
DIFFERENT TODAY.

BUT THE DREAM LIVES ON.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID HE'S A
TESTAMENT TO THE ENORMOUS

A COMEBACK?

UNCLAIMED WINNING TICKET WORTH
$1 MILLION.

TO CLAIM IT.

EARS...

IT'S BEEN A HAPPY UNION.

HE DOES LAUNDRY,
AND I DO THE CLEANING.

THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US...
HOW MUCH DIRT
CAN WE MANUFACTURE?

BETWEEN DEEN AND FORMER EMPLOYEE
LISA JACKSON, WHO CLAIMS SHE
SUFFERED FROM RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL
HARASSMENT.

THE TWO SIDES SETTLING IN COURT,
WITH NO MONEY CHANGING HANDS.

AND THEN A BIZARRE ABOUT FACE,
JACKSON EVEN STATES HER
ADMIRATION, SAYING QUOTE, THE
PAULA DEEN I HAVE KNOWN FOR MORE
THAN EIGHT YEARS IS A WOMAN OF
COMPASSION AND KINDNESS.

AND WILL NEVER TOLERATE
DISCRIMINATION OR RACISM OF ANY
KIND TOWARD ANYONE.

THE QUESTION NOW, WILL IT BE
ENOUGH TO REPAIR HER DAMAGED
MULTIMILLION DOLLAR REPUTATION?

YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE COURT
OF LAW.

YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN THE COURT OF
PUBLIC OPINION.

SHE'S CLEARLY WINNING IN THE
COURT OF LAW.

BUT SHE'S ALREADY LOST IN THE
COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.

AND THAT'S THE REALITY SHE HAS
TO LIVE WITH.

UNDER OATH, SHE ONCE USED THE N
WORD.

PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

APOLOGIES, THE FOOD NETWORK,
QVC, SEARS AND MANY OTHERS HAVE
DISTANCED THEMSELVES FROM THE
CHEF, COSTING HER AT LEAST $12.5
MILLION IN ENDORSEMENT DEALS.

DEALS SHE MAY STRUGGLE TO WIN
BACK.

DEEN'S ACCUSER ALSO SAYS SHE
DISCOVERED THE COMPLAINTS SHE
HAD BEEN MAKING ABOUT HER WORK
PLACE ENVIRONMENT WERE NOT
GETTING TO PAULA DEEN.
