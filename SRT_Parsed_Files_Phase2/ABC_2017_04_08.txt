NEW IMAGES OF THE ARMED SUSPECT
AT THE CENTER OF A NATIONWIDE
MANHUNT.

IS HE PLOTTING TO KILL, PLUS HIS
MESSAGE FOR THE PRESIDENT.

BREAKING NEWS.

BOUNCE HOUSE DISASTER.

MULTIPLE CHILDREN RUSHED TO THE
HOSPITAL.

TWO BOUNCE HOUSES SENT AIRBORNE
HITTING POWER LINES.

THE DANGER WITH THIS PARTY
ATTRACTION.

AND TAX WARNING.

THE NEW CHANGE AFFECTING
MILLIONS OF TAXPAYERS.

GOOD EVENING.

THANKS FOR JOINING US ON A
SATURDAY.

I'M TOM LLAMAS.

WE BEGIN
WITH NEW BOMBINGS BY PRESIDENT
BASHAR AL ASSAD ON HIS OWN
PEOPLE IN THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THIS AS IMAGES ARE EMERGING OF
SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF FROM THE
AIRBASE TARGETED BY U.S.
TOMAHAWK MISSILES.

PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDING AND
EXPLAINING THE DECISION NOT TO
BOMB THE RUNWAYS AND TONIGHT WE
HEAR FROM ONE OF THE MOST
VISIBLE VICTIMS FROM THE SYRIAN
ATTACK.

THE FATHER OF BABY TWINS KILLED
BY THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

ABC EAST ALEX MARQUARDT LEADS US
SYRIAN AIRBASE HIT BY THE U.S.
MILITARY BACK UP AND
RUNNING, NEW PHOTOS SHOWING
SYRIAN JETS TAKING OFF LESS THAN
24 HOURS AFTER THE U.S. STRIKE.

THE MARKINGS FROM THE BOMBINGS
SEEN ON BUNKERS.

IMAGES SHOWING AIRCRAFT AND
BOMBED OUT FUEL TANKS AND DAMAGE
TO AIRCRAFT SHELTERS.

BUT THE RUNWAYS UNTOUCHED.

TONIGHT THE PRESIDENT TWEETING A
DEFENSE.

THE REASON YOU GENERALLY DON'T
HIT RUNWAYS IS THAT THEY ARE
EASY AND INEXPENSIVE TO QUICKLY
FIX.

THE PENTAGON SAYS IT WAS FROM
THIS BASE THAT A PLANE TOOK OFF
WITH THE DEADLY NERVE AGENT USED
IN TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL ATTACK
THAT KILLED MORE THAN 80 PEOPLE.

AND THAT TOWN BOMBED AGAIN TODAY
ACCORDING TO A WATCHDOG GROUP.

THERE IS IRONY HERE THAT IT
DOES APPEAR THAT IT'S OKAY FOR
MR. ASSAD TO BLOW UP HIS PEOPLE.

IT'S JUST NOT OKAY TO GAS THEM.

WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
ANNOUNCED THE STRIKE HE POINTED
TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED.

IT WAS A SLOW AND BRUTAL
DEATH FOR SO MANY.

EVEN BEAUTIFUL BABIES WERE
CRUELLY MURDERED IN THIS VERY
BARBARIC ATTACK.

PERHAPS NO IMAGE MORE GUT
WRENCHING OF THIS ONE OF ABDUL
HAMEEM YOUSSEF HUGGING HIS
TWO LIFELESS
TWINS.

HE WENT HOUSE TO HOUSE TRYING TO
RESCUE NEIGHBORS AND FAMILY.

MANY FOAMING AT THE MOUTH.

HE LOST 25 RELATIVES IN THE
ATTACK DURING WHICH HE FAINTED.

ASKED FOR THEM HE SAID.

I TOLD THEM HELLO DARLINGS I
TOOK TOO LONG.

I RESCUED EVERYONE ELSE BUT I
COULDN'T RESCUE YOU.

DESCRIBING THE MOMENT THE PHOTO
WAS TAKEN YOUSSEF SAID I WASN'T
AWARE OF ANYTHING.

I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALIVE.

I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO HUG ME
BACK.

THAT FATHER'S STORY AND THE
IMAGES SO DEVASTATING.

ALEX JOINS US LIVE.

THE BIG QUESTION, WILL SYRIA
RESPOND TO THE U.S.

ATTACK AND
DO WE KNOW IF TODAY'S NEW
BOMBING BY SYRIA OF THAT TOWN
WHERE THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
OCCURRED WAS THAT RETALIATION?

WHETHER THAT SYRIAN ATTACK WAS
IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE
AMERICAN STRIKE WHICH PRESIDENT
ASSAD HAS CALLED AN UNJUST ACT
OF AGGRESSION BUT WE ARE SEEING
THE REACTION.

A DEFIANT
ASSAD SAYING WE ARE GOING TO
CONTINUE CARRYING BOMBING RUNS
AND LAUNCHING OUR PLANES FROM
THE BASE THAT YOU JUST STRUCK.

TOM.

ALEX, THANK YOU.

DIGGING DEEPER INTO THE DECISION
AROUND THAT STRIKE PLUS THE
BREWING CIVIL WAR INSIDE THE
WEST WING BETWEEN TWO OF THE
PRESIDENT'S TOP AIDES.

ABC'S DAVID WRIGHT REPORTING
FROM WEST PALM BEACH TONIGHT.

PRESIDENT STILL INSISTS THE
TOMAHAWK MISSILE STRIKE WAS AN
UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.

TWEETING OUT, "CONGRATULATIONS
TO OUR GREAT MILITARY MEN AND
WOMEN FOR REPRESENTING THE
UNITED STATES, AND THE WORLD SO
WELL."

NOT LONG AGO TRUMP WAS RELUCTANT
TO INTERVENE IN SYRIA.

WE DON'T WANT WORLD WAR III OVER
SYRIA.

BACK WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
WANTED TO PUNISH SYRIA FOR A
PREVIOUS CHEMICAL ATTACK.

TRUMP TWEETED WHAT WILL WE GET
FOR BOMBING SYRIA BESIDES MORE
DEBT AND A LONG TERM CONFLICT.

OBAMA NEEDS CONGRESSIONAL
APPROVAL.

TRUMP INFORMED CONGRESS AFTER
THE MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ASKED
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
IF THE STRIKE SIGNALS A CHANGE
IN U.S. POLICY.

THIS STRIKE WAS RELATED
SOLELY TO THE MOST RECENT
HORRIFIC USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS
AGAINST WOMEN, CHILDREN AND AS
THE PRESIDENT SAID EVEN SMALL
BABIES.

WE ARE CALLING ON BASHAR AL
ASSAD TO CEASE THE USE OF THE
WEAPONS.

OTHER THAN THAT THERE IS NO
CHANGE TO OUR MILITARY POSTURE.

EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT WAS
JUGGLING TWO FOREIGN ISSUES,
CHINA AND SYRIA.

HE HAD TO INTERVENE IN A
CONFLICT AMONG HIS OWN SENIOR
STAFF.

CHIEF STRATEGIST
STEVE BANNON AND SON-IN-LAW
JARED KUSHNER WERE ALLIES DURING
THE CAMPAIGN BUT SOURCES SAY
LATELY THE TWO HAVE CLASHED WITH
KUSHNER PUSHING FOR GREATER
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORLD,
BANNON FOR THE STRATEGY AMERICA
FIRST.

ABC NEWS LEARNED THE DAY AFTER
THESE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN AT
MAR-A-LAGO KUSHNER AND BANNON
SAT DOWN FRIDAY IN AN ATTEMPT TO
SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES.

CHIEF OF STAFF REINCE PRIEBUS
ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING BUT
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS DENY ANY
IMMINENT SHAKEUP.

DAVID, THE PRESIDENT IS
DEALING WITH SYRIA, A NEW
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, THIS
PUBLIC FEUD BETWEEN AIDES IS THE
LAST THING HE NEEDS RIGHT NOW?

THIS IS A HUGE MOMENT FOR THE
PRESIDENT.

YOU HAVE GOT A CHINA SUMMIT THAT
CAME OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT.

MISSILES THAT HIT THEIR TARGETS
IN SYRIA AND A NEW SUPREME COURT
PICK TO BE SWORN IN ON MONDAY.

THE LAST THING THE WHITE HOUSE
WANTS IS TALK OF INFIGHTING,
TOM.

DAVID, THANKS.

THERE'LL BE MUCH MORE ON THE
INTERVIEW WITH SECRETARY OF
STATE TOMORROW ON "THIS WEEK."

TURNING TO SWEDEN.

A COUNTRY STILL IN SHOCK OVER A
TRUCK ATTACK MOWING DOWN
PEDESTRIANS IN THE CAPITAL.

A 39-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT UNDER
ARREST AND INVESTIGATORS
EXAMINING A DEVICE THEY SAY WAS
FOUND INSIDE THE TRUCK.

THE COUNTRY'S PRIME MINISTER
PAYING HIS RESPECTS AT A
MA
MAKE-SHIFT
MEMORIAL.

MOMENT OF TERROR.

A STOLEN BEER TRUCK SUDDENLY
TRANSFORMED INTO A MASSIVE
WEAPON, BARRELING DOWN A CROWDED
SHOPPING STREET.

THERE WERE BODIES ON THE
GROUND EVERYWHERE, AND A SENSE
THE MAN AUTHORITIES SAY WAS
BEHIND THE WHEEL, SEEN HERE IN
GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES
RELEASED WHILE HE WAS ON THE RUN
AFTER THE ATTACK.

HE'S 39 YEARS OLD, ORIGINALLY
FROM UZBEKISTAN IN CENTRAL ASIA,
KNOWN TO SECURITY SERVICES HERE
AS A POSSIBLE ISLAMIC EXTREMIST,
BASED ON HIS SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS,
BUT HE WASN'T BEING MONITORED.

AND THIS TODAY, HE MAY HAVE HAD
A BOMB IN THAT TRUCK.

WE HAVE FOUND SOMETHING IN
THE TRUCK, IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,
A TECHNICAL DEVICE WHICH SHOULD
NOT BE THERE.

IN A STOCKHOLM SUBURB, SEVERAL
PEOPLE DETAINED FOR QUESTIONING.

THE SUSPECT, WHO AUTHORITIES
HAVEN'T NAMED, ISN'T TALKING,
AND THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES.

WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE
ARE FURTHER PERSONS INVOLVED IN
THIS ACT, OR NOT.

TEN REMAIN HOSPITALIZED,
INCLUDING A CHILD.

THE ATTACK SHUT DOWN CENTRAL
STOCKHOLM FOR HOURS AND IT
SHOCKED THE PEOPLE OF THIS
NORMALLY PLACID COUNTRY TO THEIR
CORE.

TODAY THEY'RE ERECTING THIS ALL
TOO FAMILIAR MAKESHIFT MEMORIAL
WHICH WE'RE SEEING IN CITY AFTER
CITY ACROSS EUROPE.

AND NOW A GRIM PATTERN IS CLEAR.

TRUCKS AND CARS, SO ORDINARY, SO
UBIQUITOUS, INCREASINGLY
WEAPONIZED BY TERRORISTS.

NICE, IN FRANCE, LAST JULY, A
SLAUGHTER ON BASTILLE DAY,
86 DEAD.

BERLIN, CHRISTMASTIME,
12 MURDERED.

JUST LAST MONTH IN LONDON,
5 KILLED.

AND NOW, STOCKHOLM.

TERRY MORAN ABC NEWS, STOCKHOLM.

ASKING FOR THE PUBLIC'S HELP TO

BIG GUSH OF AIR AND THE
BOUNCE HOUSE PROBABLY WENT UP A
GOOD 20, 30 FEET.

SAY THE BOUNCE HOUSE THEN, HIT
NEARBY POWER LINES, SENDING THE
CHILDREN, FALLING TO THE GROUND.

I'VE ONLY GOT FOUR PATIENTS
SO FAR.

THEY'RE ALL JUVENILES.

RUSHED TO THE SCENE AT THIS
SOUTH CAROLINA SAY INCREDIBLY,
NO ONE WAS ELECTROCUTED BUT FIVE
CHILDREN WERE HURT AND RUSHED TO
THE HOSPITAL.

THESE KINDS OF ACCIDENTS
HAPPENING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

IN 2015, THIS BOUNCE HOUSE ON
THE BEACH IN FLORIDA, TUMBLING
AND SENT FLYING, INJURING THREE
CHILDREN.

TWO CHILDREN HURT.

THERE'S NOT A KID IN THERE?

THERE'S NOT A KID IN THERE IS

BLOW-UP SLIDE AND SLAMMED IT
REPEATEDLY INTO THE GROUND.

I WAS PICKED UP INTO THE AIR

TONIGHT WE'RE TOLD THE
CHILDREN'S INJURIES IN SOUTH
CAROLINA ARE NOT
LIFE-THREATENING.

THANK YOU.

NEXT TO THE TRAVEL HEADACHES
THAT WON'T QUIT FOR DELTA
AIRLINE PASSENGERS.

HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS CANCELLED
TODAY.

WHAT'S BEHIND THE ONGOING
PROBLEMS TRYING THE PATIENCE OF
SO MANY?

ADRIENNE BANKERT HAS SOME
ANSWERS.

FRUSTRATIONS.

FIRST WILD WEATHER, AND NOW
SPRING BREAK, CREATING A
DISASTROUS DOMINO EFFECT
IMPACTING DELTA.

I WAS ISSUED TWO MORE TICKETS
THAT DAY.

BOARDED THREE SEPARATE AIRCRAFT.

ALL OF WHICH EITHER WERE GROUND
STOPPED OR NEVER LEFT THE GATE.

WEDNESDAY STRUCK THE AIRLINES
HUB IN ATLANTA, CANCELLING
3,500 DELTA FLIGHTS, AT LEAST
275 TODAY ALONE.

WITH DELTA DELAYING FLIGHTS
EVERY 30 MINUTES UNTIL THEY
FINALLY CANCEL THEM, I HAVE
OPTED TO RENT A CAR.

WAS RESCHEDULED ON DIFFERENT
FLIGHTS FOR FIVE DAYS STRAIGHT.

I'VE BEEN
DRIVING TWO HOURS, STILL HAVE
SEVEN HOURS TO GO, BUT MOVING
FASTER THAN DELTA IS.

OTHERS STUCK BECAUSE OF THE
SURGE OF SPRING BREAK TRAVELERS
WITH STORMS FORCING PLANES AND
CREWS OUT OF POSITION.

PASSENGERS VENTING ONLINE,
REALITY TV'S TODD CHRISLEY
TWEETING, "I USED TO BE PROUD TO
SAY I ONLY FLY DELTA, THE FACT I
NOW HAVE 2 SAY 'USE TO' IS SAD."

DELTA RELEASING A STATEMENT,
"WHILE WE CAN'T CONTROL THE
WEATHER, WE UNDERSTAND THE
RESULTING RECOVERY HAS NOT BEEN
IDEAL, AND WE APOLOGIZE FOR
THAT."

A TRAVEL WAIVER HAS BEEN
EXTENDED FOR PASSENGERS WHOSE
TRAVEL PLANS ARE FLEXIBLE.

TOM.

MORE NOW ON THE WILD WEATHER
AND THE DAMAGING
WINDS OUT WEST.

THE CLEANUP UNDER WAY FOR
HOMEOWNERS IN OREGON.

MANY DOWNED TREES.

THOSE FIERCE WINDS SLAMMING
PORTLAND AS WELL.

ALL PART OF A SYSTEM MOVING
EAST.

WITH THOSE PLANES IN THE CROSS
HAIRS FROM OKLAHOMA TO
MINNESOTA.

LET'S GET TO ROB MARCIANO.

THE STORM THROUGH THE
NORTHWEST, UNLIKE ANY I'VE SEEN.

MORE LIKE A FALL WIND STORM.

IT'S A MESS OUT THERE.

WINTER STORM WARNING FROM
CALIFORNIA TO WYOMING.

A SEVERE WEATHER THREAT
FROM IOWA BACK DOWN THROUGH
OKLAHOMA CITY.

A CHANCE WE DON'T BREAK WHAT WE
CALL THE CAP BUT IF WE DO IT'S
GOING TO BE VERY ACTIVE TOMORROW
AFTERNOON AND A LOT OF WARM AIR.

80 DEGREES IN ST. LOUIS SURGING
AND WARMER ON TUESDAY.

IT WILL START TO FEEL LIKE JUNE
IN SOME SPOTS TOM.

STILL MUCH MORE AHEAD THIS
SATURDAY.

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION AND FIRE
FLATTEN A HOME.

WE'LL TELL YOU WHERE THIS HAPPEN
AND WHAT INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW
SAYING.

PLUS WITH THE TAX DEADLINE
LOOMING A NEW PROBLEM TO WORRY
ABOUT.

WHY IT MIGHT BE HARDER TO TELL
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IRS
AND SWAMMERS.

THE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO
KNOW.

AND WOULD YOU JUMP OUT OF AN
AIRPLANE TO ASK SOMEONE OUT ON A
DATE?

THIS TEENAGER DID.

DID HIS PROM STRATEGY WORK?

THAT'S COMING UP.

BACK NOW WITH A NEW IRS
PROGRAM THAT COULD CONFUSE
TAXPAYERS.

ABC'S STEPHANIE RAMOS WITH WHAT
YOU NEED TO KNOW TO PROTECT YOUR
MONEY.

FOR YEARS LIKE THIS.

BEFORE THERE IS AN ARREST
WARRANT ISSUED, I WANT YOU OR
YOUR ATTORNEY TO GIVE US A CALL
BACK.

TAXPAYERS.

ANGRY HARASSING CALLS LIKE
THESE ARE NOT HOW WE DO
BUSINESS.

FOUR COMPANIES TO CHASE DOWN AND
CALL PEOPLE WITH LONG OVERDUE
TAXES THAT THEY CAN'T GET TO.

THIS WEEK THE IRS COMMISSIONER
WENT TO CAPITOL HILL TO DEFEND
HIRING OUTSIDE
COMPANIES THAT MAKE CALLS THAT
SOME SAY CAN CAUSE CONFUSION.

AND HELP SCAMMERS.

I'M PROTECTING TAXPAYERS.

WE HAVE HAD GOOD SESSIONS WITH
THE PRIVATE DEBT COLLECTORS.

PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE
TO --
 WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCES IF
THEY DON'T FOLLOW YOUR
DIRECTION?

WE CAN TERMINATE THE
CONTRACT.

SAYS, TO REMEMBER IF YOU GET A
CALL, THE IRS WILL CONTACT YOU
MULTIPLE TIMES IN WRITING BEFORE
YOU'RE CALLED BY CONTRACTORS OF
THE IRS AND YOU WON'T HEAR FROM
A PRIVATE COLLECTOR UNLESS YOU
HAVE MULTIPLE YEARS OF OVERDUE
TAXES.

THE IRS SAYS THESE PRIVATE
COLLECTORS WILL NEVER THREATEN
YOU WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ASK
FOR YOUR CREDIT CARD.

ALL PAYMENTS WOULD GO ONLY TO
THE IRS.

TOM.

STEPHANIE RAMOS WITH
IMPORTANT TIPS.

THANK YOU.

STILL AHEAD, A FATHER SPEAKS
OUT.

STARTLING COMMENTS FROM THE
FATHER OF THE GIRL WHO RAN OFF
WITH THE TEACHER.

WAS SHE COERCED INTO GOING WITH
HIM?

AN INCREDIBLE SCENE, A GREAT
WHITE SHARK STUCK ON A REEF.

WHY IT'S RESISTING TO GET IT
BACK IN THE WATER.

STAY WITH US.

 BACK NOW WITH OUR "INDEX".

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION LEVELS A
HOME IN MISSISSIPPI TO THE
GROUND.

SMOKE AND FLAMES POURING FROM
THE HOUSE FOLLOWING THE
EXPLOSION YESTERDAY.

IT WAS EMPTY AT THE TIME.

INVESTIGATORS DO NOT KNOW YET
WHAT CAUSED THE BLAST BUT SO FAR
THEY SAY IT DOES NOT LOOK
SUSPICIOUS.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
SEARCH FOR A TEEN AND A TEACHER.

THE FATHER OF ELISABETH TOMS
SAYING IN COURT PAPERS HIS
DAUGHTER FEARED THE TEACHER AND
HE USED THREATS TO GET HER TO
RUN AWAY WITH HER.

TEACHER TAD CUMMINS IS ACCUSED
OF ABDUCTING THE 15-YEAR-OLD
THREE WEEKS AGO.

TO RESCUE A SHARK ON A
CALIFORNIA REEF.

THE INJURED GREAT WHITE WASHING
UP ON THE ROCKS IN SANTA CRUZ.

ANIMAL RESCUE WORKERS WERE ABLE
TO GET THE SHARK
INTO THE WATER BUT IT TURNED
BACK.

SCIENTISTS SAY THEY'RE NOT SURE
IF IT STRANDED ITSELF OR IS
SICK.

ACROSS THE POND A WORLD
RECORD.

85 HOT AIR BALLOONS TAKING OFF
FOR A FLIGHT ACROSS THE ENGLISH
CHANNEL LANDING IN FRANCE THREE
HOURS LATER.

THE PREVIOUS RECORD WAS 49.

ORGANIZERS DID NOT FILE THE
PROPER FORMS WITH GUINNESS SO
THE NEW RECORD IS UNOFFICIAL BUT
THEY DID MAKE "WORLD NEWS
TONIGHT."

SO IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

UP NEXT, TAKING THE PROM-POSAL
TO NEW HEIGHTS.

THIS KID JUMPING OUT OF A PLANE
TO WIN HIS DATE'S HEART.

DID SHE SAY YES?

I HOPE SO.

THAT'S COMING UP.

FINALLY TONIGHT, ASKING A
DATE TO PROM HAS CHANGED A LOT
OVER THE YEARS.

BIGGER, FLASHIER.

TONIGHT ONE THAT PROVES THE SKY
IS THE LIMIT.

HERE'S GLORIA RIVERA.

MIND, PROM.

WHAT BETTER WAY TO GO ABOVE
AND BEYOND THAN JUMP OUT OF A
PLANE TWO MILES ABOVE THE EARTH?

DECIDED ON, A SO-CALLED
PROM-POSAL FROM 12,000 FEET.

AND LOOK CLOSELY, THAT'S NOT A
JUMPSUIT HE'S WEARING, IT'S A
SUIT AND TIE.

VERY ROMANTIC.
