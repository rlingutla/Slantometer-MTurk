TONIGHT, BREAKING NEWS AS WE
COME ON, WHAT COULD BE A NEW
BOMBSHELL.

DID PRESIDENT TRUMP ASK FORMER
FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY -- TO
SHUT DOWN THE FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION INTO RETIRED
GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN, THE
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER WHO
SURVIVED JUST 24 DAYS ON THE
JOB.

"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTING
MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT SAID
TO COMEY, "I HOPE YOU CAN LET
THIS GO."

COMEY WAS FIRED LAST WEEK.

ALSO TONIGHT, THE WHITE
HOUSE, REFUSING TO SAY WHETHER
PRESIDENT TRUMP GAVE THE
RUSSIANS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

TONIGHT, WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS
NOW SAYING HIMSELF.

IN OTHER NEWS, THE DEADLY
HIGHWAY COLLISION IN THE EAST,
ALONG I-95.

SEVERAL BIG RIGS AND CARS
COLLIDING, THE CHARRED WRECKAGE.

THE HIGHWAY SHUT DOWN.

THE TORNADO THREAT AS WE
COME ON TONIGHT.

ONE ON THE GROUND JUST A SHORT
TIME AGO.

MILLIONS IN THE PATH OF THE
STORMS TONIGHT.

AND THE NEW CAFFEINE
CONCERN.

THE 16-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD A
COFFEE, AND SEVERAL OTHER DRINKS
WITH CAFFEINE, THE CORONER WHO
SAYS IT KILLED HIM.

THE NEW WARNING, HOW MUCH
CAFFEINE IS TOO MUCH.

GOOD EVENING.

AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH
US HERE ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.

AND WE BEGIN WITH THAT
BREAKING HEADLINE AS WE COME ON
THE AIR.

TONIGHT, OUR TEAM NOW CONFIRMING
A REPORT LATE TODAY IN "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" THAT FIRED FBI
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY WROTE A
MEMO, DOCUMENTING SOME OF HIS
INTERACTION WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

AND TONIGHT, THIS QUESTION, DID
THE PRESIDENT ASK JAMES COMEY
TO, QUOTE, LET THIS GO, WHILE
TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION
INTO THIS MAN, RETIRED GENERAL
MICHAEL FLYNN, AND RUSSIA.

FLYNN OF COURSE RESIGNED JUST A
FEW DAYS INTO THE
ADMINISTRATION.

COMEY WAS FIRED ONE WEEK AGO
TONIGHT.

ABC'S SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA
LEADING US OFF.

BOMBSHELL AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

ABC NEWS CONFIRMS PRESIDENT
TRUMP ALLEGEDLY SUGGESTED FORMER
FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY SHUT
DOWN HIS INVESTIGATION INTO
FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER
MICHAEL FLYNN.

A SOURCE CLOSE TO COMEY TELLS
ABC NEWS, COMEY WROTE A MEMO IN
FEBRUARY THE DAY AFTER FLYNN WAS
FIRED.

I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS GO, THE
PRESIDENT ALLEGEDLY TOLD COMEY.

ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE, HE IS A
GOOD GUY, I HOPE YOU CAN LET
THIS GO.

"THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHO FIRST
REPORTED THE MEMO SAYS IT WAS
PART OF A PAPER TRAIL COMEY
WANTED TO LEAVE BEHIND AS
EVIDENCE INTO WHAT HE CALLED
IMPROPER INFLUENCE INTO HIS
INVESTIGATION.

THE TIMES DIDN'T VIEW A COPY OF
THAT MEMO.

BUT SAYS ASSOCIATES OF COMEY
READ IT TO A REPORTER.

TONIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE IS
DISPUTING THE STORY.

SAYING IN STATEMENT, THE
PRESIDENT HAS NEVER ASKED MR.
COMEY OR ANYONE ELSE TO END ANY
INVESTIGATION,
INCLUDING ANY INVESTIGATION
INVOLVING GENERAL FLYNN.

THIS IS NOT A TRUTHFUL OR
ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF THE
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND MR. COMEY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID COMEY WAS
FIRED BECAUSE HE WAS NOT
COMPETENT, CALLING HIM A
SHOWBOAT.

THIS GALVANIZED MANY IN THE FBI.

THE ACTING DIRECTOR COMING TO
COMEY'S DEFENSE LAST WEEK.

IS IT ACCURATE THAT THE RANK
AND FILE NO LONGER SUPPORTED
DIRECTOR COMEY?

NO SIR, THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

YOU CANNOT STOP THE FBI FROM
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

SO THERE HAS BEEN NO EFFORT
TO IMPEDE OUR INVESTIGATION TO
DATE.

LET'S GET TO CECILIA VEGA.

THE WHITE HOUSE I KNOW IS
DENYING THIS.

BUT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORT,
IS BASED IN PART LATE TODAY ON
TWO PEOPLE THEY SAY READ THE
JAMES COMEY MEMO.

PART OF A PAPER TRAIL THAT COMEY
DOCUMENTED AS THE TIMES PUT IT,
"IMPROPER EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE
THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO
FLYNN AND RUSSIA."

TIMES SAID THEY DIDN'T SEE THIS
MEMO THEMSELVES BUT THEY SOURCED
THESE TWO PEOPLE THEY SAY THEY
READ IT.

THE REACTION HAS BEEN POURING
IN.

DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY TALKING
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY -- RAISING
THE POSSIBILITY OF OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE.

THAT'S OF COURSE A FEDERAL
CRIME.

ONE SENATOR SAID THAT WE MAY BE
TALKING ABOUT AN IMPEACHMENT
PROCESS.

DAVID, I WAS JUST SPEAKING WITH
A SOURCE ON CAPITOL HILL.

THIS JUST CAME IN, "I DON'T
THINK WE COULD BE STUNNED
ANYMORE GIVEN THE PAST WEEK.

THIS BLEW THAT OUT OF THE
WATER."

THE SAME REACTION AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TONIGHT.

ANOTHER LONG NIGHT AHEAD FOR
YOU, CECILIA.

I WANT TO BRING IN PIERRE
THOMAS, WHO COVERS THE FBI.

PIERRE, YOU ACTUALLY CONFIRMED
THIS EVENING THAT COMEY DID
WRITE A MEMO TO DOCUMENT HIS
INTERACTIONS WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

THE SOURCE TOLD YOU THAT THE
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLEGEDLY ASKED
HIM TO GO EASY ON FLYNN.

DAVID, THE SOURCE SAID HE'S
SEEN THE COMEY MEMO, AND HE
CONFIRMED THE QUOTES IN "THE NEW
YORK TIMES" SPECIFICALLY,
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALLEGEDLY
SAYING, I HOPE YOU CAN LET THIS
GO, HE'S A GOOD GUY.

DAVID, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS A
LOT OF PEOPLE COMING TO THE
DEFENSE OF COMEY WHO BELIEVE
HE'S A MAN OF INTEGRITY AND
HONOR, NOT PERFECT.

BUT A MAN OF INTEGRITY.

AS FOR THE MOOD AT THE FBI
THEY'RE PROFESSIONALS AND
THEY'RE CARRYING ON THEIR WORK.

BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE,
A NUMBER OF FORMER FBI AGENTS I
TALKED WITH ARE EXTREMELY ANGRY
AT THE WAY COMEY WAS FIRED.

DAVID.

PIERRE THOMAS WITH US
TONIGHT.

PIERRE, THANK YOU.

ALL OF THIS COMES AS THE
WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO SAY
WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE
THE PRESIDENT GAVE CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS.

THAT HEADLINE BROKE LAST NIGHT
AS WE CAME ON.

OUR TEAM COULD HEAR THE YELLING
BEHIND THE WALLS OF THE WEST
WING.

THE PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY
REVEALING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
ABOUT AN ISIS PLOT.

THAT INFORMATION COMING FROM AN
U.S.

ALLY WHO HAD NOT GIVEN
PERMISSION TO SHARE IT.

TONIGHT, DID THE PRESIDENT'S
REVEAL PUT ANY SOURCES ALREADY
IN HARM'S WAY AT GREATER RISK?

HERE'S ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL.

MET WITH THE PRESIDENT OF TURKEY
TODAY, HE WAS HOUNDED WITH
QUESTIONS --
 DID YOU REVEAL CLASSIFIED
INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION WITH
THE RUSSIANS?

MR. PRESIDENT, DID YOU SHARE
CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE
INFORMATION WITH THE RUSSIANS?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

RUSSIANS AS A SUCCESS.

WE HAD A VERY, VERY
SUCCESSFUL MEETING WITH THE
FOREIGN MINISTER OF RUSSIA.

OUR FIGHT IS AGAINST ISIS.

PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE MET WITH
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND
AMBASSADOR IN THE OVAL OFFICE
LAST WEEK.

THE "WASHINGTON POST" FIRST
REPORTED THAT THE PRESIDENT
SHARED HIGHLY SENSITIVE
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ABOUT AN
ISIS PLOT TO TARGET CIVILIAN
AIRPLANES WITH LAPTOP BOMBS --
SECRET INFORMATION, ABC NEWS HAS
LEARNED, GIVEN TO THE UNITED
STATES BY ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE.

LESS THAN TWO HOURS AFTER THE
STORY BROKE, THE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER EMERGED FROM
THE WEST WING TO SHOOT IT DOWN.

THE STORY THAT CAME OUT
TONIGHT AS REPORTED IS FALSE.

PRESIDENT SEEMED TO CONFIRM HE
SHARED SENSITIVE INFORMATION
WITH THE RUSSIANS, TWEETING --
"AS PRESIDENT I WANTED TO SHARE
WITH RUSSIA, AT AN OPENLY
SCHEDULED WHITE HOUSE MEETING,
WHICH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT
TO DO, FACTS PRETRAINING TO
TERRORISM AND AIRLINE FLIGHT
SAFETY.

CONFIRMING MANY OF THE DETAILS
IN THE "POST" STORY AND NOT
DENYING THE INFORMATION SHARED
WAS CLASSIFIED.

GENERAL, WHEN YOU CAME OUT
AFTER THE STORY BROKE, YOU SAID
THAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT
DISCLOSE ANY SOURCES OR METHODS.

HE DID NOT REVEAL ANYTHING ABOUT
MILITARY OPERATIONS.

WHY WERE YOU DENYING THINGS THAT
WERE NOT EVEN REPORTED?

WHAT THE REPORT SAID IS THAT THE
PRESIDENT REVEALED CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN SHARED
BY ONE OF OUR ALLIES IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.

SO THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY A YES
OR NO QUESTION HERE.

DID THE PRESIDENT SHARE
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WITH THE
RUSSIANS IN THAT MEETING?

AS I MENTIONED ALREADY, WE
DON'T SAY WHAT'S CLASSIFIED,
WHAT'S NOT CLASSIFIED.

WHAT I WILL TELL YOU AGAIN IS
THAT WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHARED
WAS WHOLLY APPROPRIATE.

THE STORY COMBINED WHAT WAS
LEAKED WITH OTHER INFORMATION,
AND THEN INSINUATED ABOUT
SOURCES AND METHODS, SO I WANTED
TO MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYBODY THAT
THE PRESIDENT IN NO WAY
COMPROMISED ANY SOURCES OR
METHODS IN THE COURSE OF THIS
CONVERSATION.

POLITICAL NIGHTMARE FOR THE
TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE, AS A CANDIDATE, DONALD
TRUMP MADE SUCH AN ISSUE OUT OF
HILLARY CLINTON'S HANDLING OF
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

WE CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE IN THE
OVAL OFFICE WHO DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE
WORD CONFIDENTIAL OR CLASSIFIED.

AUTHORITY TO DECLASSIFY
ANYTHING, THE QUESTION IS, WHY
HE WOULD SHARE IT WITH AN
ADVERSARY?

THE WHITE HOUSE INSISTS HE WAS
SOLICITING RUSSIAN HELP IN THE
FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.

THE "POST" STORY SUGGESTS TRUMP
WAS TRYING TO SHOW OFF, QUOTING
HIM TELLING THE RUSSIANS, "I GET
GREAT INTEL.

I HAVE PEOPLE BRIEF ME ON GREAT
INTEL EVERY DAY."

COULD NOT HAVE TOLD THE RUSSIANS
THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW THE
SOURCE.

THE PRESIDENT WASN'T EVEN
AWARE OF WHERE THIS INFORMATION
CAME FROM.

HE WASN'T BRIEFED ON THE SOURCE
OR METHOD OF THE INFORMATION
EITHER.

WASN'T AWARE OF WHERE THE
INFORMATION CAME FROM.

JONATHAN KARL LIVE WITH US AS
WELL.

YOU WERE IN THAT BRIEFING ROOM.

THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY DIDN'T
SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT THE
POTENTIAL OF CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION GIVEN OUT.

THEY MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE
BIGGER CONCERN HERE, IN THEIR
OPINION, IS WHO LEAKED WHAT
HAPPENED.

JON, THE INITIAL CALL -- THE
INITIAL CALL OF CONCERN TO THE
CIA AND THE NSA YOU HAVE
REPORTED HAS COME FROM WITHIN
THE WHITE HOUSE.

KNOW, SHORTLY AFTER THAT MEETING
WITH THE RUSSIANS, A TOP
OFFICIAL ON THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL HERE AT THE
WHITE HOUSE PLACED CALLS TO THE
NSA AND THE CIA TO INFORM THEM
ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD
SAID, SO, CLEARLY THERE WAS
ENOUGH CONCERN HERE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE ABOUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT
REVEALED THAT THEY FELT THEY
NEEDED TO TELL THE CIA AND THE
NSA.

ALL RIGHT, JON, THANKS TO
YOU.

AND ON CAPITOL HILL TONIGHT,
REACTION POURING IN ON BOTH
FRONTS.

ON THE REPORTED PRESSURE ON
JAMES COMEY, TO GO EASY ON
MICHAEL FLYNN, AND ON THE
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ALLEGEDLY
GIVEN TO THE RUSSIANS.

BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
WANT THE TRANSCRIPT NOW, THE
NOTES, FROM INSIDE THAT OVAL
OFFICE MEETING.

ABC'S MARY BRUCE ON THE HILL
TONIGHT, NEW CALLS FROM BOTH
PARTIES FOR THE FORMER FBI
DIRECTOR TO TESTIFY ON CAPITOL
HILL.

I DON'T WANT TO READ A MEMO.

I WANT TO HEAR FROM HIM.

REELING WHAT THE PRESIDENT
ALLEGEDLY REVEALED IN THAT
MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS.

HOPEFUL TO HAVE LESS DRAMA
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

STANDING BY THE PRESIDENT.

DO YOU HAVE ANY WORRY OF THE
PRESIDENT'S ABILITY TO PROPERLY
HANDLE CLASSIFIED INFO?

NO.

PRESIDENT'S TOP ALLIES SAYS THE
WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO GET ITS ACT
TOGETHER.

OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE IN A
DOWNWARD SPIRAL RIGHT NOW AND
THEY'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO COME TO GRIPS WITH ALL THAT'S
HAPPENING.

CONCERN?

JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE
DISCIPLINE.

POINTING OUT WHAT THE PRESIDENT
ONCE SAID ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.

HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE OUT
CHANTING "LOCK HER UP" AND TRUMP
HIMSELF SAYING SHE WAS UNFIT TO
GOVERN BECAUSE OF THAT?

AND HERE HE IS NOW RELEASING
REAL SECRETS DIRECTLY TO THE
RUSSIANS.

AND THE IRONY OF THAT IS PRETTY
ASTOUNDING.

SO LET'S GET TO MARY BRUCE
WITH US AS WELL FROM CAPITOL
HILL.

HOUSE MEMBERS MEETING TONIGHT
WITH THE CIA DIRECTOR HOPING TO
GET MORE ON THE NEWS OF JAMES
COMEY AND THIS REPORTED PRESSURE
THAT WAS PLACED ON HIM TO GO
EASIER ON RETIRED GENERAL
MICHAEL FLYNN?

INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE JUST
FINISHED MEETING WITH THE CIA
DIRECTOR.

THEY WERE HOPING FOR ANSWERS BUT
EMERGED FROM THAT MEETING FACING
EVEN MORE QUESTIONS NOW ABOUT
THAT COMEY MEMO, THE TOP
DEMOCRAT ON THE COMMITTEE
REITERATING HIS CALLS FOR COMEY
TO TESTIFY HERE ON THE HILL.

DAVID.

MARY BRUCE WITH US TONIGHT,
AS WELL.

MARY, THANK YOU.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IT'S
BELIEVED IN TALKING WITH THE
RUSSIANS IN OVAL OFFICE, WAS
TALKING ABOUT AN ISIS PLOT, WHAT
COULD BE THE BIGGEST PLOT TO
TAKE DOWN A PLANE SINCE 9/11.

TONIGHT, BY SHARING THAT
INFORMATION, ARE THE LIVES OF
SOURCES AT GREATER RISK, AND
WHAT ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE ALLY WHO GAVE THE WHITE
HOUSE THAT INFORMATION IN THE
FIRST PLACE.

HERE'S BRIAN ROSS TONIGHT.

TONIGHT, ACCORDING TO CURRENT
AND FORMER U.S. OFFICIALS, IS
THE LIFE OF A SPY INSIDE ISIS,
PLACED THERE BY ISRAEL,
PROVIDING SENSITIVE INFORMATION
ABOUT TERROR PLOTS AGAINST
AMERICA ON THE CONDITION THE
U.S. KEEP THE SOURCE SECRET.

THE REAL RISK IS NOT JUST
THIS SOURCE, BUT FUTURE SOURCES
OF INFORMATION ABOUT PLOTS
AGAINST US.

INTELLIGENCE FROM INSIDE ISIS
INVOLVES AN ACTIVE PLOT TO BRING
DOWN A PASSENGER JET EN ROUTE TO
THE U.S., WITH A BOMB HIDDEN IN
A LAPTOP THAT THE U.S.

BELIEVES
CAN GET THROUGH AIRPORT
SCREENING MACHINES UNDETECTED.

THE INFORMATION IS SO RELIABLE
THAT THE U.S. IS CONSIDERING A
BAN ON LAPTOPS ON ALL FLIGHTS
FROM EUROPE TO THE U.S.
 WHAT THEY WANT TO DO THE MOST
IS THEY WANT TO HAVE A LARGE
AIRPLANE BLOW UP IN FLIGHT.

TAKEN CREDIT FOR BLOWING UP A
RUSSIAN AIRLINER TWO YEARS AGO,
KILLING MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE,
CLAIMING THE BOMB WAS HIDDEN IN
A SOFT DRINK CAN.

THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL
SECURITY ADVISER SAYS THAT
JUSTIFIES PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DISCLOSURES TO THE RUSSIANS.

THIS WAS THE CONTEXT OF THE
CONVERSATION IN WHICH IT WAS
WHOLLY APPROPRIATE TO SHARE WHAT
THE THREAT WAS AS A BASIS FOR
COMMON ACTION AND COORDINATION.

COUNTERTERRORISM COMMUNITY SAY
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID WAS A
MISTAKE.

RUSSIA IS NOT PART OF THE
ISIS COALITION.

THEY ARE NOT OUR PARTNER.

AND BRIAN ROSS WITH US NOW.

BRIAN REPORTED THERE THAT IT'S
BELIEVED IT WAS ISRAEL, OUR
ALLY, WHO GAVE US THAT
INFORMATION.

LOT OF PEOPLE ARE POINTING TO
THE FACT IF THIS CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION WAS GIVE ON THE
RUSSIANS THEY COULD GIVE IT TO
PLAYERS WHO ARE CLEARLY NOT
FRIENDS WITH ISRAEL.

THAT'S RIGHT -- DAVID.

INCLUDING IRAN, ALSO A SWORN
ENEMY OF ISRAEL.

BRIAN, THANK YOU.

WE DO HAVE OTHER NEWS WE'RE
FOLLOWING AT THIS HOUR.

A FIERY CRASH ON I-95, SEVERAL
BIG RIGS AND SEVERAL CARS
