AS PRESIDENT TRUMP UNLEASHES AN
ENDLESS STREAM OF TWEETS ON GAME
DAY.

ALSO BREAKING, THE DEADLY
CHURCH SHOOTING.

THE GUNMAN WEARING A MASK,
OPENING FIRE.

AND THE CHURCH MEMBER WHO
CONFRONTED HIM.

SHOW OF FORCE.

AMERICAN BOMBERS FLYING THE
CLOSEST TO NORTH KOREA IN NEARLY
TWO DECADES.

PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLING KIM
JONG-UN "LITTLE ROCKET MAN" AS
NORTH KOREAN LEADERS SAY
TARGETING THE U.S. MAINLAND IS
MORE INEVITABLE.

AND, DANGEROUS TURN?

THE CRIPPLED DAM IN PUERTO RICO.

THOUSANDS RUSHING TO GET TO
HIGHER GROUND.

AND HURRICANE MARIA'S NEW PATH.

THE NEW WATCH JUST ISSUED FOR
THE EAST COAST.

AND GOOD EVENING.

THANKS FOR JOINING US ON THIS
SUNDAY.

I'M TOM LLAMAS.

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH THE
UNESCAPABLE HEAD-ON COLLISION OF
POLITICS AND SPORTS.LARS RESPON
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTACK ON
THOSE WHO KNEEL IN PROTEST
DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

SIMILAR ACTS OF DEFIANCE SEEN
BEFORE EACH GAME.

PLAYERS PEACEFULLY TAKING A
KNEE, LOCKING ARMS, SOME WITH
FISTS RAISED IN THE AIR.

THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS AMONG
THE TEAMS CHOOSING NOT TO TAKE
THE FIELD DURING THE ANTHEM.

TRUMP SAYING PLAYERS WHO PROTEST
SHOULD BE FIRED OR SUSPENDED.

THE NFL COMMISSIONER, OWNERS,
COACHES AND PLAYERS SENDING A
UNITED MESSAGE.

AND TONIGHT, NEW COMMENTS FROM
THE PRESIDENT.

HERE'S MARY BRUCE.

SUNDAY --
♪ OH SAY CAN YOU SEE
A MESSAGE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

FROM DETROIT TO BUFFALO, AND ALL
THE WAY TO LONDON, AS THE ANTHEM
PLAYS, THE CHORUS OF OPPOSITION
FROM THE FIELD IS GROWING.

PLAYERS AND COACHES KNEELING
TOGETHER.

ARMS LINKED, FISTS RAISED IN
SOLIDARITY.

THE NATIONAL ANTHEM AT FORBES
FIELD ENDING WITH THIS MOMENT.

THE PATRIOTS' TOM BRADY,
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH HIS
TEAMMATES.

IN CHICAGO, ALL BUT ONE OF THE
STEELERS DECLINED TO TAKE THE
FIELD.

THE LONE PLAYER WHO STOOD,
ALEJANDRO VILLANUEVA, A U.S.
ARMY VETERAN.

AND IN NASHVILLE, THE TITANS AND
THE SEAHAWKS SITTING OUT THE
ANTHEM TOGETHER.

IT STARTED WITH THIS JAB, AND
CRUDE LANGUAGE, FROM THE
PRESIDENT ON FRIDAY.

TAKING ON FOOTBALL PLAYERS LIKE
COLIN KAEPERNICK, WHO KNEEL
DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM TO
PROTEST RACIAL AND SOCIAL
INJUSTICE.

WOULDN'T YOU LOVE TO SEE
SOMEBODY DISRESPECTS OUR FLAG,
ONE OF THE NFL OWNERS TO SAY,
"GET THAT SON OF A [ BLEEP ] OFF
THE FIELD RIGHT NOW, OUT.

HE'S FIRED.

HE'S FIRED!

DOUBLING DOWN.

I THINK THE OWNERSHIP SHOULD
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY
DISRESPECTFUL TO OUR FLAG.

NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE.

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
RACE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

IT HAS TO DO WITH RESPECT FOR
OUR COUNTRY.

PRESIDENT SAYING IF NFL FANS
REFUSED TO GO TO GAMES UNTIL
PLAYERS STOP DISRESPECTING OUR
FLAG AND COUNTRY, YOU WILL SEE !

BUT THE NFL IS BACKING ITS
PLAYERS.

IN AN UNUSUALLY STRONG REBUKE,
THE COMMISSIONER SAYS, "DIVISIVE
COMMENTS LIKE THESE DEMONSTRATE
AN UNFORTUNATE LACK OF RESPECT
FOR THE NFL, OUR GREAT GAME AND
ALL OF OUR PLAYERS."

PEOPLE  PRESIDENO  TWHT NKD  IW
TOGETHER.

AND THAT INCLUDES BLACKS AND
WHITES AND EVERYTHING.

AMERICANS SAY HE IS DOING MORE
TO DIVIDE THE COUNTRY THAN UNITE
IT.

HE'S NOW USING SPORTS AS THE
PLATFORM TO TRY TO DIVIDE US.

FOOTBALL.

TRUMP IS TAKING ON BASKETBALL
TOO, AFTER NBA CHAMPION STEPH
CURRY SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO
VISIT THE WHITE HOUSE.

I DON'T WANT TO GO.

THAT'S REALLY IT.

TO IT, DISINVITING HIM.

TWEETING, "GOING TO THE WHITE
HOUSE IS CONSIDERED A GREAT
HONOR FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM.

STEPH CURRY IS HESITATING,
THEREFORE INVITATION IS
WITHDRAWN!"

LEBRON JAMES' FIRST RESPONSE?

"YOU BUM.

CURRY ALREADY SAID HE ISN'T
GOING.

GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE WAS A
GREAT HONOR UNTIL YOU SHOWED
UP."

MARY, FROM OUTSIDE
FEDEXFIELD, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
WEIGHING IN AGAIN TONIGHT.

CLEARLY WATCHING SOME OF THE
GAMES TODAY?

HE DID WATCH SOME OF TODAY'S
GAMES, BUT HE SAID HE SAW
TREMENDOUS SOLIDARITY FOR OUR
COUNTRY AND OUR FLAG.

ON TWITTER, HE ADDED STANDING
WITH LOCKED ARMS IS GOOD.

KNEELING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

AND TOM, DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S
RECENT COMMENTS, HE INSISTS HE'S
NOT URGING HIS SUPPORTERS TO
BOYCOTT THE NFL.

TOM?

SENDING A MIXED MESSAGE.

MARY, THANK YOU.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S OUTBURSTS
SPREADING BEYOND FOOTBALL AND
BASKETBALL.

MAXWELL, BECOMING THE FIRST
MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER
TAKING A KNEE DURING THE ANTHEM.

OUTRAGE IS BUILDING OVER THE
PRESIDENT'S HEATED COMMENTS.

HERE'S RYAN SMITH.

I HATE YOU!

CONTROVERSY IGNITED BY PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

THE NFL UNITING.

I GUESS WE'RE ALL A SON OF A
[ BLEEP ].

REX RYAN CAMPAIGNED FOR TRUMP,
BUT HAD HARSH WORDS TODAY.

I'M PISSED OFF, I'LL BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

BECAUSE I SUPPORTED
DONALD TRUMP.

ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.

THAT'S NOT THE MEN THAT I KNOW.

THE MEN THAT I KNOW IN THE
QUARTERBACK TERRY BRADSHAW
DISAGREES WITH THE PROTEST, BUT
STANDS BEHIND THE PROTESTERS'
RIGHT TO DO IT.

IF OUR COUNTRY STANDS FOR
ANYTHING, FOLKS, WHAT, IT'S
FREEDOM.

PEOPLE DIED FOR THAT FREEDOM.

I'M NOT SURE IF OUR PRESIDENT
UNDERSTANDS THOSE RIGHTS.

TEAMS TAKING THE FIELD DURING
THE ANTHEM IN SUPPORT OF THEIR
PLAYERS.

PATRIOTS OWNER BOB KRAFT IS A
WELL KNOWN FRIEND OF TRUMP, EVEN
FLYING ON AIR FORCE ONE,
DONATING $1 MILLION TO HIS
INAUGURAL COMMITTEE.

BUT TODAY SAYING HE'S "DEEPLY
DISAPPOINTED BY THE TONE OF THE
COMMENTS" AND "THERE IS NO
GREATER UNIFIER IN THIS COUNTRY
THAN SPORTS.

UNFORTUNATELY, NOTHING IS MORE
DIVISIVE THAN POLITICS."

WE SPOKE TO FANS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AND THAT DIVIDE IS
CLEAR.

I STAND FOR THOSE WHO STAND
FOR US.

YOU GUYS MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,
AND THEY SHOULD STAND DURING THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

I VOTED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP,
BUT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES HE
SHOULD BE MORECEON C WEDRN IT
 WE AGREE WITH STANDING UP FOR
HASHTAG TWEETED ROUGHLY 2
MILLION TIMES.

TONIGHT I'M TAKING A KNEE FOR
AMERICA.

STEVIE WONDER AND HIS SON
KNEELING AT THE GLOBAL CITIZENS
CONCERT LAST NIGHT.

BRUCE MAXWELL SHOWING HIS
SUPPORT.

AND TONIGHT, THE NFL WILL PLAY
THIS AD IN PRIMETIME SHOWING HOW
FOOTBALL CAN UNIFY.

WE MAY HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES,
BUT RECOGNIZE THERE'S MORE THAT
UNITES US.

RYAN JOINS US FROM OUTSIDE
METLIFE STADIUM.

I KNOW YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR
SOURCES IN THE NFL.

ARE THEY SAYING THIS IS ONLY THE
BEGINNING OF THE PROTESTS?

RUNNING HIGH AMONG MANY PLAYERS,
AND FANS WERE GENERALLY
SUPPORTIVE OF THE PROTESTS ON
SUNDAY.

THAT MEANS THERE COULD BE MORE
PROTESTS TO COME.

RYAN, THANK YOU.

SOME BREAKING NEWS OUT OF
TENNESSEE.

A DEADLY CHURCH SHOOTING THERE.

AT LEAST ONE KILLED, SEVERAL
WOUNDED.

AUTHORITIES SAY THE GUNMAN
WEARING A MASK, ARRIVED AT THE
CHURCH AND OPENED FIRE.

A CHURCH MEMBER STANDING UP TO
THE GUNMAN.

RAMPAGE.

HE WAS JUST SHOOTING, HE CAME
RIGHT TO THE MIDDLE AND SHOT
DRESS BLOODY FROM HELPING THE
PASTOR, ONE OF SEVEN HURT ALONG
WITH 68-YEAR-OLD LINDA BUSH.

SHE WAS PRETENDING TO BE DEAD
SO HE WOULDN'T SHOOT HER AGAIN.

MINUTES OF HORROR, ROBERT INGLE,
A CHURCH USHER, CONFRONTING THE
SHOOTER.

HE TACKLED HIM, HE WAS HURT
IN HIS HEAD, AND WITHOUT HIM I
THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

IDENTIFIED BY POLICE AS
25-YEAR-OLD EMANUAL SAMSON, SHOT
DURING THE STRUGGLE.

POLICE SAY THAT HEROIC USHER
SAVED LIVES.

THE CHURCH USHER IS AN
EXTRAORDINARILY BRAVE
SHOOTER'S MOTIVES.

HE'S A FORMER MEMBER OF THE
CHURCH, AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE IS OPENING UP A CIVIL
RIGHTS INVESTIGATION INTO THE
SHOOTING.

ADRIENNE, THANK YOU.

NEXT UP, THE U.S. WITH A
SHOW OF FORCE, SENDING A MESSAGE
TO NORTH KOREA.

NORTH KOREAN COAST.

AS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE
REGIME TRADE NEW INSULTS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED
SATURDAY, "JUST HEARD FOREIGN
MINISTER OF NORTH KOREA SPEAK AT

HIS TWEET COMES AFTER THE NORTH
KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER SLAMMED
THE PRESIDENT AT THE UNITED
NATIONS, CALLING HIM "A MENTALLY
DERANGED PERSON" WHO "COMMITTED
AN IRREVERSIBLE MISTAKE."

DAYS EARLIER, PRESIDENT TRUMP IN
THE SAME VENUE WITH THAT
WARNING.

IF IT IS FORCED TO DEFEND
ITSELF OR ITS ALLIES, WE WILL
HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TOTALLY
DESTROY NORTH KOREA.

THREATENED TO TEST A HYDROGEN
BOMB ABOVE THE PACIFIC OCEAN,
SOMETHING THEY HAVE NEVER DONE
BEFORE.

EVERYTHING HE HAS SAID HE
WOULD DO.

I WILL TEST A HYDROGEN BOMB, I
WILL SEND AN ICBM TEST.

HE'S DONE.

SO WHY WOULDN'T HE TEST A
HYDROGEN BOMB OVER THE PACIFIC?

I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD IS
THERE THAT HE WILL TEST A BOMB
AT SOME POINT.

AND BOB JOINS US LIVE.

YOU'VE BEEN COVERING NORTH KOREA
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, YOU WERE
JUST ON THE NORTH KOREAN/CHINA
BORDER.

AND YOU TOLD ME SOMETHING YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE?

ON THE CHINESE SIDE, THE
TENSION IS GROWING.

PROBABLY WITH MORE MISSILE
LAUNCHES AND NUCLEAR TESTS.
