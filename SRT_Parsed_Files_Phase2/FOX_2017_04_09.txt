REPORTING LIVE.

LET'S BEGIN IN EGYPT, ISIS,
ISLAMIST STATE TERROR ARMY IS

ALSO UNFOLDING U.S. MAKING MOVES
IN TWO MAJOR GLOBAL HOT SPOTS,
SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA, PRESIDENT
TRUMP ARRIVING BACK IN
WASHINGTON D.C. AFTER A FEW DAYS
IN FLORIDA MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT OF CHINA.

THEY TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

AND RECENT PROVOCATIONS
INCLUDING BANNED MISSILE TESTING
BY NORTH KOREA, PRESIDENT IS
SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE BY
DELAYING A U.S. CARRIER STRIKE
GROUP.

USS CARL VINSON AND ITS
SUPPORTING CHIP, THAT MASSIVE
FIGHTING FORCE IS BEING DIVERTED
TO WATERS OFF OF THE KOREAN
PENINSULA.

WHEN I WAS AMBASSADOR IN
CARRIER BATTLE GROUP AS A
100,000 TONS OF DIPLOMACY.

I WORKED CLOSELY WITH CENTRAL
COMMAND THEN TO MAKE SURE WE
HAVE CARRIER PRESENT IN NORTHERN
GULF WHEN WE NEEDED IT.

I THINK THAT PRESIDENT HAS MADE
THE RIGHT MOVE BOTH IN SYRIA AND
IN KOREA.

BUT, THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

HARRIS 100,000 POUNDS OF
DIPLOMACY,R WE BRING IN DAVID LE
MILLER TO START COVERAGE WITH
LATEST FROM MIDDLE EAST
BOMBINGS.

REPORTER HARRIS, EGYPT'S
PRESIDENT DECLARING A 3-MONTH
STATE OF EMERGENCY, FOLLOWING
TWO TERROR ATTACKS ON COPTIC
ORTHODOX CHURCHES, DOZENS DIED,
AND OVER 100 WOUNDED.

DEATH TOLL COULD HAVE BEEN
HIGHER.

BOTH OF THE INCIDENTS WERE
CAUGHT ON CAMERA, WE CAUTION,
SOMEWHAT OF YOU ABOUT TO SEE AND
HERE IS DISTURBING.

SURVEILLANCES VIDEO SHOWS A
SUICIDE BOMBER.

BOMBER IS TURNED AWAY FROM THE
MAIN GATE, AND DIRECTED TO A
METAL DETECTOR, HE THEN WALKED
PAST A FEMALE OFFICER IRK --
TALKING TO A WOMAN, AND
DETONATES THAT BOMB.

EARLIER, LEADER OF THE COPTIC
CHURCH FINISHES SERVICES.

LOCAL REPORTS SAID HE WAS STILL
IN THE BUILDING AT THE TIME OF
THE BLAST BUT NOT HURT, 11
PEOPLE WERE KILLED, INCLUDE
THREE POLICE, THE CATHEDRAL IS
CONSIDERED SACRED.

TODAY'S FIRST ATTACK WAS IN
TANTA, 26 WORSHIPPERS WERE
KILLED.

CHURCH'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL WAS
TRANSMITTING AS THE BOMB REPORT
OFF, AND VIDEO ABRUPTLY ENDS.

A WITNESS WHO LIVED ACROSS THE
STREET, DESCRIBED CHURCH DEACONS
IN BLOOD-STAINED WHITE ROBES
RUNNING FROM THE SCENE, AND
OTHER SERIOUSLY INJURED VICTIMS
WERE RUSHED TO HOSPITALS IN
PRIVATE CARS, ISIS CLAIMS
RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOTH DEADLY
BLASTS, AND THREATEN TO INCREASE
ATTACKS TARGETING EGYPT
MINORITIES, CHRISTIANS, THEY
REFER TO AS INFIDELS, THERE HAVE
BEEN OVER 2 GO DOZEN ATTACKS OFE
COPTIC ORTHODOX COMMUNITY.

HARRIS LET'S GET TO U.S. NAVY
CARRIER STRIKE GROUP, HEADED TO
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, THE NEXT
MOVE BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

OFFICIALS SAY THIS IS A SHOW OF
FORCE IN THAT REGION FOLLOWING
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PHONE CALL
WITH SOUTH KOREA PRESIDENT
YESTERDAY.

WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT TWO MEN
AGREED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE
NORTH.

THAT COUNTRY APPEARS TO BE
CONTINUING WITH NUCLEAR PROGRAM
AND IS NEARING ANOTHER TEST.

IN A INTERVIEW TODAY, SECRETARY
OF STATE REX TILLERSON HAD A
MESSAGE FOR COUNTRIES WHICH
VIOLATE INTERNATIONAL LAW.

IF YOU FAIL TO LIVE UP TO
COMMICOMMITMENTS, IF YOU BECOMEA
THREAT TO OTHERS, AT SOME POINT
A RESPONSE IS LIKELY TO BE
UNDERTAKEN.

HARRIS LUCAS WITH MORE.

REPORTER GOOD EVENING HARRIS,
THIS DECISION TO SEND THE CARL
VINSON STRIKE GROUP WAS THE
PRUDENT THING TO DO.

THIS SAY ROGUE REGIME.

THAT IS NOW A NUCLEAR CAPABLE
REGIME.

THE PRESIDENT HAS ASKED US TO BE
PREPARED TO GIVE HIM A FULL
RANGE OF OPTIONS TO REMOVE THAT
THREAT TO THE EMERGENCY PEOPLE,
AND TO OUR ALLIES AND PARTNERS
IN THE REGION.

REPORTER LAST MONTH BATTLE
GROUP TOOK PART IN ANNUAL
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH SOUTH
KOREAN AND JAPANESE ALLIES,
SATURDAY, IN ADDITION TO HIS
CALL WITH SOUTH KOREA ACTING
PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE
TO JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER TO
DISCUSS THE NORTH KOREA THREAT.

THAT SAME DAY, HEADS OF PACIFIC
COMMAND ORDERS AIRCRAFT CARRIER
DO REVERSE COURSE.

CANCELING A PORT CALL IN
AUSTRALIA, AMONG THE STRIKE
GROUP ARE TWO DESTROYERS AND A
CRUISER.

DEFENSE OFFICIALS TELL FOX THIS
ABILITY TO LAUNCH MISSILES TO
NORTH KOREA MAY BE A BIGGER
MESSAGE TO SEND NORTH KOREA THAN
THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER.

PENTAGON SEES SIGN THAT ROGUE
COMMUNIST REGIME IS PREPARING
FOR ANOTHER NUCLEAR TEST, AND I
AM TOLD THAT DESCRIBE GROUP WILL
ARRIVE LATER THIS WEEK.

THERE IS ALSO A SUBMARINE
LURKING, BUT U.S. OFFICIALS DO
NOT LIKING ABOUT THOSE
OPERATIONS.

NO DOUBT, ANYBODY WHO SEES
OUR FIGHTING FORCE, 100,000
POUNDS OF DIPLOMACY TOWARD IT,
THEY KNOW THEY NEED TH THE REPO.

NEW QUESTIONS SURROUNDING
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND WHETHER
HIS TEAM ARE ACTUALLY ON THE
SAME PAGE, AMBASSADOR TO UNITED
NATIONS NIKKI HALEY SIGNALS THAT
PRESIDENT MAY BE IN FAVOR OF
REGIME CHANGE IN SYRIA, WE GO TO
THAT NOW, BUT SECRETARY OF SAY
THE TILLERSON SAID IT IS UP TO
THE SYRIAN PEOPLE, NATIONAL
CLEAR FI FID THOSE COMMENTS.

AMBASSADOR HALEY POINTING OUT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
HOW A POLITICAL SOLUTION.

WE ARE NOT SAY WE'RE THE ONES
WHO WILL AFFECT THAT CHANGE,
WE'RE SEEING OTHER COUNTRY HAVE
TO ASK THEMSELVES HARD
QUESTIONS, RUSSIA SHOULD ASK
THEMSELVES, WHAT ARE WE DOING
HERE.

HARRIS PETER IS AT THE WHITE
HOUSE NOW WITH MORE ON THIS,
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS NOW TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER A SERIOUS
STRATEGY?

REPORTER THEY KNOW THEY WANT
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD TO GO
AWAY, BUT NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHO WOULD TAKEOVER IF
HE WAS TO GO.

AND IF THAT IS EVEN THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT A
REGIME CHANGE OR PUSH FOR ONE.

AND REASON THEY ARE CONCERNED IS
BECAUSE THEY REMEMBER HOW
QUICKLY THINGS WENT SOUTH IN
LIBYA WITH GADHAFI WAS TOPPLED.

WE HAVE TO LEARN LESSONS OF
PAST AND WHAT WENT WRONG IN
LIBYA WHEN YOU CHOOSE THAT
PATHWAY OF REGIME CHANGE.

WE KNOW THIS WILL BE HARD WORK.

BUT WE THINK IT IS ALSO A
PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO A
DURABLE AND LASTING STABILITY IN
SYRIA.

REPORTER WHICH WEEK'S
AIRSTRIKES WERE MEANT TO WEAKEN
THE ASSAD REGIME AS A RESPONSES
TO THEIR USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPON,
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION KNOWS THAT
ISIS FIGHTERS WHO SET UP SHOP IN
SYRIA ARE A MAJOR NATIONAL
SECURITY CONCERN AS WELL.

GETTING ASSAD OUT IS NOT ONLY
PART, WE HAVE TRYING TO DEFEAT
ISIS.

SECONDLY WE DON'T SEE A PEACEFUL
SYRIA WITH ASSAD IN DPLSM THEREE
MOVE TOWARD A POLITICAL
SOLUTION, AT END OF THE DAY THIS
IS A COMPLICATED SITUATION.

REPORTER NATIONAL SECURITY
MAIN OBJECTIVE OF U.S. WITH
AIRSTRIKES AGAINST THE AADD
REGIME, WAS -- ASSAD REGIME WAS
TOO SEND A STRONG POLITICAL
MESSAGE.

HARRIS I KNOW THERE ARE CHANGES
MADE AT NATIONAL SECURITY LEFT
THIS NEWS DEVELOPING, K.T.

AS U.N.

AMBASSADOR TO SINGAPORE.

REPORTER SHE WAS MICHAEL BLIN'S
FLYNN'S DEPUTY, AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS EXPECTED TO NOMINATE
HER TO AMBASSADOR OF SINGAPORE,
THAT WOULD BE A PROPORTION FOR
HER, SHE JOINS STEVE BANNON AS
SECOND OFFICIAL TO LEAVE
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISE
COUNCIL.

SINCE MICHAEL FLYNN RESIGNED.

WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
ABOUT A NATIONAL SECURITY
CONCERN BUT ON A DIFFERENT
TOPIC, TALKING ABOUT CHURCH
BOMBINGS IN THE MIDDLE EAST,
TWEETING, SO SAD TO HEAR OF
TERRORIST ATTACK IN EGYPT, U.S.

STRONGLY CONDEMNS, I HAVE GREAT
CONFIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT ASEE
-- WILL HANDLE THOSE PROPERLY.

PRESIDENT TRUMP BACK AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.

HE HAS SERIOUS BUSINESS TO GET
DOWN TO.

HARRIS WELL, AS EVERYONE CAN
APPRECIATE, YOU KNOW, WE NEARED
THAT LONGER HOUR DAY, IT IS
LIGHTER OUT.

PEOPLE CAN SEE WITH MORE
DAYLIGHT, WE'RE SEEING QUITE A
BIT OF SUPPORT FROM BOTH
POLITICAL PARTIES FOR TRUMP'S
MOVE ON SYRIA MILITARY FOR
UNLEASHING CHEMICAL WEAPONS ON
CITIZENS THERE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
TO GETTING A CRITICAL LOOK ON
CAPITOL HILL.

I'LL TALK WITH ONE LAW MAKER WHO
BACKS THE PRESIDENT ON SYRIA,
BUT SAID HOW HE JUSTIFIED IT
LEGALLY WAS FLAWED.

AND SAID THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO
GET INVOLVED IMMEDIATELY, SCOTT
TAYLOR A FORMER NAVY SEAL, AND
MEMBER OF HOMELAND SECURITY, HE
WILL JOIN ME LATER THIS HOUR,
STAY CLOSE.

AND RIGHT NOW, FOX NEWS IS
LEARNING NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE
MAN ACCUSED OF PLOWING A BEER
TRUCK INTO A CROWD OF PEOPLE IN
STOCKHOLM, WE'D SWEDEN, WHEN HIS
REASON FOR DOING THIS MAY HAVE
DONE.

A DOMESTIC FOCUS FOR THE
PRESIDENT LAST YEAR, URBAN
BLIGHT AND CREATING JOBS FOR
POOR AMERICANS IN THE CITIES,
HEAD SECRETARY.

YOU SEE HIM THERE BEN CARSON
WILL JOIN US LIVE ON THE "FOX
REPORT" WITH A CHECK IN FROM HIS

SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND
URBAN DEVELOPMENT, DOCTOR BEN
CARSON RETURNED TO THE DETROIT
NEIGHBORHOOD.

THAT TRIP TO SHOW, THEN
CANDIDATE DONALD TRUMP TO SHOW
THE MORE IMPOVERISHED AREAS.

NOW, HE SAYS HE WANTS TO DO MORE
THAN JUST PUT ROOFTOPS OVER THE
HEADS OF AMERICANS.

HE HOPES TO EMPOWER THEM AS
WELL.

SECRETARY CARSON IS HERE TO TELL
US ABOUT THE PLAN.

IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

MY FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU HAS TO
DO WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO
GATHER INFORMATION.

YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
LISTENING TO HER.

I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHERE YOU
HAVE GOTTEN WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD.

THE FIRST PLACE I STARTED WAS
IN THE HUD BUILDING.

PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE
FROM 10 - OF 40 YEARS AND THEY
HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT
INFORMATION.

I'M STILL GETTING INFORMATION
FROM THEM.

AS I HAVE GONE TO SOME OF THE
CITIES, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
HAS IMPRESSED ME AND WORKED
EXTRAORDINARY WHILE WAS THE
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND
THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL
DOLLARS IN SOME PLACES LIKE
DETROIT, AT A RATE OF 8 - 1.

THIS GETS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY
INVESTED IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVE
A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE
THE PROJECT SUCCEEDS.

SO YOU DON'T HAVE JUST THESE
FEDERAL PEOPLE LOOKING OVER
EVERYBODY'S SHOULDER.

I THINK THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING?

WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOREIGN
POLICY THAT WE HAVE NOT TALKED
AS MUCH ABOUT DOMESTIC POLICY
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEN
CANDIDATE WANTED TO FOCUS ON IN
URBAN AREAS.

CREATING JOBS IS AN AREA HE
THOUGHT HE COULD WIN VICTORY.

GOING FORWARD, WHAT YOU SEE IS
THE PLAN?

I HAVE BEEN READING THAT YOU
WILL BE LEANING ON RICH URBAN
HOMEOWNERS TO BE HELPING OUT
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

HAVE YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT
TO SEE WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT
THAT?

THE PRESIDENT AND I ARE VERY
WELL ALIGNED.

WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS ALREADY
IN PLACE, LIKE SECTION THREE
WHICH REQUIRES THOSE PEOPLE
RECEIVING HOUSING FUNDS TO
EMPLOY SOME OF THE LOW INCOME
PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

IT HAS BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BECAUSE
PEOPLE FREQUENTLY DO NOT HAVE
THE SKILLS.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS A WAY
TO, AHEAD OF TIME, MAYBE A YEAR
AHEAD OF TIME BEFORE MAJOR
PROJECT, GO IN AND TRAIN PEOPLE.

NOW YOU DON'T HAVE THAT EXCUSE.

WE HAVE MORE EMPLOYMENT OF
PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP WITH
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.

NOW THEY HAVE A SKILL THAT
TRAINS THEM.

THESE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO DO
WITH TO DEVELOP OUR PEOPLE.

NOT JUST PUT A ROOF OVER THEIR
HEAD.

DEVELOPING THE WHOLE PERSON.

THAT MEANS WORKING WITH THE
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THE
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,
TRANSPORTATION, HHS, A NUMBER OF
THINGS TO CREATE VIBRANT
COMMUNITIES.

YOU MENTIONED THAT 8 - 1 WHEN
YOU LOOK AT THE PRIVATE PUBLIC
PARTNERSHIP AND HOW FAR PUBLIC
DOLLARS WOULD GO.

I IMAGINE THAT'S IMPORTANT.

PART OF THE WHITE HOUSE BUDGET
PROPOSAL WOULD CUT THE
DEPARTMENT AT HUD BY MORE THAN
13%.

WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO HAVING
TO DO THE JOB ON LESS MONEY FOR
YOUR DEPARTMENT?

WE ARE LOOKING AT
EFFICIENCIES.

HOW DO WE CARVE OUT AND GET THE
BANK FOR OUR BUCK.

ALSO, THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT
INTERESTED IN HURTING PEOPLE AND
PUTTING PEOPLE OUT ON THE
STREET.

WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING
SURE THAT WE ARE EFFICIENT AND
THAT WE ARE COMPASSIONATE, NOT
ONLY TO THE PEOPLE TODAY BUT THE
PEOPLE TOMORROW.

EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN OWES
$60000 IN TERMS OF OUR NATIONAL
DEBT.

WE HAVE TO START LOOKING OUT FOR
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING AFTER
US.

WE CANNOT JUST IGNORE THAT.

MANY NATIONS HAVE TRIED THAT IN
THE PAST AND IT HAS BEEN
DETRIMENTAL TO THEM.

THE VIDEO WE SHOWED AT THE
TOP WAS YOU AND YOUR FORMER HOME
OF DETROIT.

WE KNOW THE STATE OF MICHIGAN
HOW MUCH THEY HAVE SUFFERED BOTH
ECONOMICALLY AND EVEN IN TERMS
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN FLINT WITH
THE DRINKING WATER AND SOME OF
THE PROBLEMS THERE.

OVER YEARS AND DECADES OF
LIBERAL LEADERSHIP AND DEMOCRATS
IN OFFICE.

POLITICS COME UP IN YOUR
LISTENING TO HER?

NOT VERY MUCH.

I HAVE DEALT WITH BOTH
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.

THE ISSUES THAT FACE US ARE NOT
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT ISSUES.

WE HAVE 3 - 4 TIMES THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE WHO NEED AFFORDABLE
HOUSING THE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION,
BABY BOOMERS WHO NEED TO RETIRE
BUT DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO
DO SO BECAUSE THEIR 4O1 KAYS
HAVE NOT DONE MUCH IN THE PAST
TEN YEARS.

WE HAVE GOT TO BE CREATIVE AND
THINK OUT-OF-THE-BOX IN ORDER TO
MAINTAIN A REASONABLE LIFESTYLE
FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

THIS CERTAINLY CANNOT BE A PART
OF SOMETHING.

REAL QUICK, BEFORE I LET YOU
GO YOU SEEM TO BE RIGHT ON
TARGET WITH THIS I KNOW YOU TO
CRITICISM EARLY ON, BUT THIS IS
IN YOUR WHEELHOUSE, YOU'VE GONE
BACK TO THE URBAN AREAS.

I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE LAST
WORD.

OKAY.

THE LAST WORD IS THAT WE ONLY
HAVE 330 MILLI- PEOPLE IN
AMERICA.

ONE QUARTER WHAT CHINA HAS, ONE
QUARTER OF WHAT INDIA HAS.

WE HAVE GOT TO DEVELOP ALL OF
OUR PEOPLE IF WE ARE GOING TO
COMPETE IN THE FUTURE.

THAT MEANS TAKING A HOLISTIC
APPROACH.

NEXT, WHERE YOU GOING?

HEADING OFF TO MIAMI.

I WILL BE GOING THERE THIS WEEK.

I'M SURE WE'LL SEE A LOT OF
GREAT THINGS THERE.

WERE LOOKING NOT ONLY THE
POSITIVE THINGS BUT THE NEGATIVE
THINGS BECAUSE WE CAN LEARN FROM
BOTH.

YOU HEARD IT HERE HERE FIRST.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR
CARSON.

POLICE IN SWEDEN ARE RELEASING
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEADLY
TRUCK ATTACK IN STOCKHOLM.

WHY POLICE SAY HE WAS ALREADY
BEING SOUGHT.

HE WAS ABLE TO SLIP THROUGH
THEIR FINGERS.

POLICE HAVE ARRESTED A SECONT
WEEKEND'S DEADLY TRUCK ATTACK.

LEARNING ABOUT THE MAN WHO WAS
ACCUSED OF CARING THAT OUT.

HE WAS ORDERED TO LEAVE THE
COUNTRY AFTER HIS REQUEST FOR
RESIDENCY WAS DENIED.

INSTEAD, HE STAYED AND DODGED
DEPORTATION BY GIVING THEM THE
WRONG ADDRESS.

AS FOR THE MEMORIAL, ORGANIZERS
ARE RELOCATING IT AFTER NEARBY
FENCE THREATENED TO COLLAPSE.

PASSWORD AND LOOKING AHEAD TO
A BIG STORY THIS WEEK.

JUDGE NEIL GORSUCH WILL BE SWORN
COURT JUSTICE, TOMORROW MORNING
AFTER BEING CONFIRMED BY THE
SENATE LAST WEEK.

COURSES WILL GET RIGHT TO WORK
AS THE HIGH COURT IS EXPECTED
TO'S HERE TO CASES AND THE NEW
COMING WEEKS.

HERE IS MORE ON THE SUPREME
COURT'S NEWEST MEMBER.

NOW THAT THE SENATE HAS
CONFIRMED NEIL GORSUCH TO BE THE
NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE
WAITING TO SEE HOW GORSUCH VOTES
ON THE BET.

HOW CLOSELY HE FALLS IN LINE
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SUMMI IDEA.

THE NOMINATION OF NEIL M
GORSUCH OF COLORADO TO BE AN
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, IS
CONFIRMED.

HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING ON
THURSDAY, THE NEW JUSTICE WILL
MEET WITH HIS COLLEAGUES TO
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO HEAR
NUMBER OF CASES IN THE FALL
TERM.

THERE ARE STILL A COUPLE OF
MONTHS IN THE CURRENT TERM FOR
THE COURT WHICH ENDS IN JUNE.

HE FEELS THE CONSERVATIVE SEAT
LEFT VACANT BY THE LATE JUSTICE
ANTONIN SCALIA.

HIS NEW VOICE COULD BE THE
TIEBREAKER VOTE.

UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE
HIGHEST COURT WHETHER OR NOT TO
HEAR THE CASES ABOUT SECOND
AMENDMENT RIGHTS AS WELL AS OF
BUSINESS OWNERS MAY REFUSE TO
OFFER SERVICES TO SAME-SEX
COUPLES.

I CASE BOTH PARTIES WILL BE
CLOSELY WATCHING, HOW INSTEP THE
NEW JUSTICE IS WITH THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS REVISED TRAVEL
BAN ON REFUGEES.

GETTING GORSUCH ON THE BENCH HAS
NOT BEEN EASY FOR THE PRESIDENT
OR GOP LEADERS.

AFTER BETTER CONFIRMATION BATTLE
IN THE SENATE WHICH PRONTO
REPUBLICANS TO USE THE NUCLEAR
OPTION, NOW BLAMED FOR THE
HISTORIC MOVE BEING TOSSED
BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES.

BOTH DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS HAVE BLAME.

BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
HAVE HANDLED THINGS IN A WAY
THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE.

WE SHOULD CHANGE OUR RULES BY
BIPARTISAN.

WE SHOULD NOT CHANGE OUR ROLES
TO ACCOMPLISH A PURPOSE.

TOMORROW MORNING, NEIL
GORSUCH WILL BECOME THE NINTH
HE WILL BE SWORN IN IN A ROSE
GARDEN CEREMONY.

BEING MADE HERE ON FOX NEWS
CHANNEL.

WE'LL BRING A COMPLETE COVERAGE
OF THE CEREMONY, AND WE WILL LET
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU JUST HEARD
LAUREN TALKING ABOUT, THE
PRIVATE ONE AS WELL.

THE COUNTRY WILL BE ABLE TO
WATCH THAT PLAY OUT THAT IS
PUBLIC.

STAY WITH THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL
AT 900 A.M. EASTERN.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TAKING ACTION
ON FORM POLICY.

WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AT
THIS HOUR.

SCREEN LEFT, THE AIRSTRIKE ON
THE SYRIAN AIRBASE IN RESPONSE
TO THAT CHEMICAL ATTACK.

THE RIGHT SCREEN, THE AIRCRAFT
CARRIER, THE PINNACLE OF
AMERICAN FORCE PROJECTION,
100,000 TONS OF DIPLOMACY AS WE
HAVE HEARD AN EARLIER GUEST
STAY.

IT IS STEAMING TOWARD THE KOREAN
PENINSULA TO SEND A STRONG
MESSAGE.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS
FOR THE PRESIDENT, THE NATION,
AND WHAT COMES NEXT.

CONGRESSMAN SCOTT TAYLOR FROM
VIRGINIA IS COMING UP NEXT.

STRIKES IN SYRIA ARE RAISING
QUESTIONS AMONG LAWMAKERS IN
WASHINGTON OVER WHAT ROLE WE
SHOULD PLAY IN THE SIX YEARS
CIVIL WAR GOING FORWARD.

ONE SURVIVOR OF THE CHEMICAL
ATTACK THAT SPURRED THAT
OPERATION SAID PEOPLE SHOULD
FORGET THE POLITICS.

THAT MAN LOST HIS WIFE.

YOU PROBABLY SEEN THE PICTURE
GONE VIRAL OF HIM HOLDING HIS
TWIN BABIES.

THE ASSAD REGIME TOOK THEM OUT
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

HE SAID THE U.S. SHOULD DO MORE
NOW, NOT JUST ONE STRIKE.

NOT ALL SYRIANS AGREE.

ENGINEMEN HALL HAS THE STORY
FROM TURKEY.

IT WAS WATCHING VIDEOS OF
THIS HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK
WHICH DROVE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO
INTERVENE.

WHILE SPEAKING TODAY PEOPLE ARE
DIVIDED UP IT IS EASY TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT DROVE HIM.

IT WAS ALSO AN INCREDIBLY
SOBERING MOMENT.

AMONG THE FAMILIES WE SPOKE TO
WAS ABDUL, HE HAS BECOME THE
FACE OF THE TRAGEDY.

HE WAS REUNITED WITH FAMILY
MEMBERS WHO DID SURVIVE, THOUGH
HE LOST 22.

HE DESCRIBED SOME OF THE THINGS
HE SAW.

AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE, THE
WHOLE FAMILY WAS DEAD.

GROWN-UPS, DEAD.

FAMILY ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, MY
BROTHER, HIS WIFE, THEIR
CHILDREN, MY NIECES, ALL OF THEM
DEAD.

AFTER A FEW MINUTES, I FAINTED.

AMONG THE DEAD, HIS 11 MONTH
OLD TWINS.

HE BURIED THEM IN HIS WIFE WITH
HIS OWN HANDS, BUT CANNOT BEAR
TO PUT THEM IN THE GROUND,
GRIPPING THEM TILL THE BITTER
END.

HE SPOKE TO US ABOUT THE
AMERICAN STRIKES.

I WANT TO TELL PRESIDENT
TRUMP, THE FIRST STRIKE WAS
GOOD, IT SAVED US.

BUT JUST A FEW HOURS LATER THE
AIRBAGS CONTINUED WORKING, IT'S
LIKE A CHALLENGE FROM ASSAD.

I CAN STILL ATTACK FROM THE SAME
BASE YOU ATTACKED.

NOT ONLY A PLANE STILL TAKING
OFF FROM THE AIRBASE, THERE
STILL BOMBING THE TOWN.

APPARENTLY ADD A GREATER PACE
THAN BEFORE, WITH NOBODY TO STOP
THEM.

ASSAD IS A CRIMINAL.

HE IS KILLING NOT ONLY HUMAN
BEINGS AND CHILDREN, BUT ANIMALS
AS IF THEY WERE THE SAME.

HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL.

THE FEELING IS ONE OF
GRATITUDE TOWARD THE U.S.

THE STRIKES GIVE THE SYRIAN BITE
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND
OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTURE.

BUT THE LESS THEY HAVE DONE TO
BACK UP THE ASSAD REGIME, HE
WILL CONTINUE TO KILL HIS PEOPLE
LIKE HE HAS DONE FOR THE LAST
SIX YEARS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DECISION TO
LAUNCH THE MISSILE STRIKE ON
SYRIA.

HE OPPOSES THE LEGAL BASIS ON
WHICH YOU ORDER THAT MISSION.

VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN,
SCOTT TAYLOR IS A MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE APPROPRIATION ON HOMELAND
SECURITY.

THE U.S. NAVY SEAL, HE HAS
SERVED HIS COUNTRY IN THAT WAY.

THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.

I WANT TO START WITH WHERE YOU
ARE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE
PRESIDENT AND WHY YOU SAY
CONGRESS NEEDS TO IMMEDIATELY
GET INVOLVED NOW?

LET'S BE CLEAR.

OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION THEY
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY AND
FLEXIBILITY AS A PRESIDENT THAT
HE OR SHE SEE SOMETHING AS A
THREAT TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
TOWARD TROOPS AND INTEREST THEY
HAVE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO
ASK.

WITH THAT BEING SAID, CONGRESS
DECLARES WAR OR CREATE STATUTORY
LAWS THAT ALLOW FOR USE OF
FORCE.

THIS PRESIDENT, AND THE PREVIOUS
PRESIDENT, TWO ADMINISTRATIONS
OPERATING OFF USE OF MILITARY
FORCE FROM 16 YEARS AGO FROM A
THIRD ADMINISTRATION.

CONGRESS DOES NEED TO LEAD AND
THAT NEED TO HAVE A VOICE IN
THIS.

I'VE SEEN MANY CONGRESSMEN AND
WOMEN ON NATIONAL NEWS IN THE
PAST FEW DAYS BECAUSE OF THE
STRIKE.

THE BEST THING WE CAN DO AS
LEADERS IN CONGRESS IS TO TAKE
IT UP IN DEBATE AND TALK ABOUT
IT.

THE PRESIDENT DID HAVE THE
ABILITY TO ACT.

HE HAS THAT TIME AND FLEXIBILITY
TO DO SO.

UNDER THE UN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
TREATY, YOU CANNOT PRODUCE,
DEVELOP, OR USE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, I DO SUPPORT THE
PRESIDENT AND HIS ACTION.

I THINK THE WORLD WAS WATCHING
WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND I SUPPORT
HIS DECISION TO TAKE ACTION AND
SAY THAT WILL NOT STAND.

CAN SEE EYES GLAZING OVER.

CONGRESS CUT SEEM TO AGREE ON
ANYTHING.

I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE SAID,
THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT YOU
ARE WORKING OFF A 16-YEAR-OLD
AUTHORIZATION OF MILITARY FORCE
TO GET THIS DONE.

DO YOU REALLY HAVE CONFIDENCE
THAT IN A BIPARTISAN MANNER YOU
CAN MOVE FORWARD AND GIVE THE
PRESIDENT SUPPORT HE NEEDS?

THAT THE NEXT ONE QUESTION.

BECAUSE CONGRESS IS SLOW TO
DEBATE AND THERE'S DIVERGING
INTEREST THERE, THERE THE
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVE.

THAT'S WHEN EXECUTIVE HAS
FLEXIBILITY IN TIME TO TAKE
ACTION IF THEY DEEM FIT.

BUT, LEADERS MUST ACT.

LEADERS MUST LEAVE.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE
A SAY IN USE OF MILITARY FORCE
AROUND THE WORLD.

THAT BEING SAID, HOW TO HAVE A
SAY?

TO THE REPRESENTATIVES IN
CONGRESS.

IT'S IMPORTANT THEIR VOICES LIKE
MYSELF FOR SPEAKING OUT SAME
CONGRESS MUST TAKE THIS OUT AND
DEBATED.

THEY NEED TO COME TOGETHER
BIPARTISAN AND SAY WHAT WERE
GOING TO DO.

IF WERE GOING TO AUTHORIZE THE
USE OF MILITARY FORCE FOR LONGER
TIME ARE NOT.

THAT HAS BEEN LINGERING, THAT IS
OUR COMPLETE MISSION.

AS A FORMER NAVY SEAL YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENDGAME IT
SAVES PEOPLE'S LIVES AND KEEPS
OUR VISION CRISP.

IT KEEPS THINGS FROM VEERING UP
AND BECOMING OTHER THINGS.

WHAT IS THE ENDGAME HERE?

TO WE KNOW WHAT IT IS?

THAT'S NEXT LINE POINT.

WERE NOT GOOD TO BE TALKING
ABOUT TACTICS, STRATEGY -WISE
IT'S IMPORTANT.

THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SHOULD COME
TO CONGRESS AND TALK ABOUT THE
INTELLIGENCE, THE GOALS, THE END
STATE.

I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SYRIA, IT'S
A POWDER CAKE, ANYTHING THAT I'M
AWARE OF SINCE WORLD WAR II YOU
HAVE TURKEY, US, ISRAEL, RUSSIA,
OTHERS IN THAT SPACE AS WELL.

IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

I RAN AS WELL, HEZBOLLAH.

YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL
FOR FLASHPOINT.

AND NOT ENOUGH TO COMPLEXION A
POTENTIALLY GREATER CONFLICT.

IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE ENDGAME
AND THE STRATEGY AND THE GOAL OF
THE UNITED STATES.

HEAR THAT IS GOING TO BE.

YOU HEARD THAT FATHER IN SYRIA
WHO LOST HIS TWINS, AMERICA DO
MORE THAN ONE STRIKE.

ARE YOU CONCERNED THE EMOTION
BASED UPON THE NEED FOR POLICY?

HOW DO YOU KEEP THEM SEPARATE?

IT IS A HORRIBLE TRAGEDY AND
WATCHING THE IMAGES AND
LISTENING TO THAT FAMILY.

IT DOES TUG AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.

IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LEADERS TO
BE ABLE TO SEE CLARITY THROUGH
CHAOS.

UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGY AND
THE GOALS ARE.

WE CANNOT SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT EVEN
SYRIA SIGNED ONTO THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS CONVENTION AS WELL.

IT'S IMPORTANT THE WORLD'S LEAD
AND THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
CANNOT AND WILL NOT STAND.

THE PRESIDENT TOOK DECISIVE
ACTION AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PRESIDENT THAN THE
LAST ONE.

WHEN YOU HAVE DIPLOMACY THAT THE
WORLD AGREES WITH YOU HAVE TO
BACK IT UP WITH FORCE.

THAT'S IMPORTANT.

TO STEP UP AND BEGIN THAT
LEADING IN CONGRESS TO MAKE SURE
YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT
HE NEEDS.

WHEN YOU COME BACK, I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT VETERANS AFFAIRS.

YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THINGS
DONE AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT ON THAT
PART OF DOMESTIC POLICY.

WE'LL BRING YOU BACK.

AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANOTHER
TIME, DOES THAT SOUND GOOD?

I'M OPTIMISTIC AND POSITIVE
THAT WERE GONNA GET STUFF DONE
AT THE VIRGINIA.

THANK YOU.

TIME.

POPE FRANCIS IS WEIGHING IN ON
THE DEADLY BOMBING SAID TO
CHRISTIAN CHURCHES IN EGYPT.

THE POPE IS CONDEMNING THE
ATTACKS HAS THAT HAPPENED AS HE
WAS HOLDING HIS PALM SUNDAY MASS
AT THE VATICAN.

HE OFFERED HIS CONDOLENCES AND
SAID HE IS PAYING FOR THOSE WHO
DIED.

THE BOMBING BECAME'S WEEKS BE
FOR HIS VISIT TO CAIRO.

PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SEARCHING FOR
AN END WITH DOMESTIC ISSUES.

WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT
THE VIRGINIA IN COMING WEEKS AS
WELL.

THE PRESIDENT IS NOW TURNING
TOWARD TAX REFORM.

WE'LL HAVE TO TURN TO DEMOCRATS
TO GET SOMETHING DONE, TO HELP
HIS PRIORITIES BECOME A REALITY?

WE'LL TALK WITH MY NEXT GUEST,
DEMOCRAT.

DEMOCRAT.

NEW DETAILS ON A MANHUNT FOR A
SUSPECT POLICE CALL A NATIONAL
THREAT.

THE STREET OF DOWNTOWN DALLAS TO
SPEAK OUT OF AGAINST PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICY.

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING
IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES AREN'T
MARCHING TO MILES WHAT IS CALLED
THE MEGA MARCH.

THEY'RE PACKED INTO SAID HE
HALTED AND THE DEMONSTRATION.

THEY EXPECT ABOUT 100,000
PEOPLE.

THEY DID THAT BEFORE IN 2006, I
THINK IT WAS.

BACK TO WASHINGTON WHERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS LOOKING TO
MOVE ON WITH HIS DOMESTIC
AGENDA.

AFTER FAILING TO REPEAL OBAMA
CARE, HE AND CONGRESS ARE
GEARING UP TO TACKLE TAX REFORM.

EARLY SIGNS INDICATE A TOUGH
FIGHT AHEAD.

WITH EVEN REPUBLICANS
DISAGREEING OVER KEY PARTS OF A
PROPOSED PLAN.

CAN PRESIDENT TRUMP GET
DEMOCRATS ON HIS SIDE?

MY NEXT GUEST HAS EXPERIENCE
WORKING WITH THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE POLITICAL AISLE FROM THE
WEST WING.

HE SPENT SIX YEARS WITH
FORMER ADVISOR TO BILL CLINTON
AND A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND
FRIEND, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ABOUT
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

PRESIDENT CLINTON PROBABLY
TEACHES A FEW THINGS ABOUT
DEALING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE,
RIGHT?

HE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT
CONGRESSES, THE FIRST ALL
DEMOCRAT, THE NEXT THREE FOR THE
REST OF HIS PRESIDENCIES HE WAS
STACKED AGAINST REPUBLICANS.

WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

BIPARTISANSHIP.

WHAT WAS I CALL TRIANGULATION.

CANDIDLY, WITH DONALD TRUMP
FIGHTING WITH REPUBLICANS, HE
HAS TO IF HE IS GOING TO
SUCCEED, BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF
LAST WEEK'S RAID AND BEGIN
BIPARTISAN OUTREACH TO THE
DEMOCRATS.

WHAT YOU MEAN?

THE ATTACK ON SYRIA FOLLOWI
FOLLOWING.

BECAUSE HE HAS BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT ON THAT.

YES, NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK
SCHUMER.

NOW, GIVEN THE FACT THAT
REPUBLICANS ON HEALTHCARE ARE
DIVIDED BETWEEN THE FREEDOM
CAUCUS, THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE
REPUBLICANS AND MODERATES, HE
REALLY HAS TO IF HE IS GOING TO
SUCCEED.

WHETHER IT BE A TAX REFORM,
HEALTHCARE, OR INFRASTRUCTURE.

THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT PRESIDENT
CLINT OUT WITH.

I WANT TO DO APPLES AND APPLES.

WHO DOES THE PRESIDENT REALLY
NEED TO REACH OUT TO?

THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT WE
NEED TO DO CORPORATE TAX REFORM.

WE NEED TO REPATRIATE THE MONEY
THAT MAY BE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
THAT ARE OVERSEAS AND LOWER THE
RATE.

HUNDRED DEMOCRATS FEEL?

DEMOCRATS FEEL FINE ABOUT IT.

THEY DON'T WANT TO REDUCE TAXES
ON THE WEALTHY WHICH IS ONE OF
HIS SIGNATURE INITIATIVES AS
WELL.

IF THEY CAN BE BROKEN UP AND BE
DONE AS BITE-SIZE INITIATIVES
TERMS EVERY PETRI MONEY
OVERSEAS?

IF THE PRESIDENT GOES TO
CHUCK SCHUMER AND SAID CHUCK, WE
HAVE TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON
CORPORATE TAX REFORM BEFORE WE
DO INDIVIDUAL TAX REFORM.

JUST MAYBE WE CAN BEGIN TO GET
SOME MOMENTUM TO GET OTHER
ISSUES.

THE PRESIDENT HAVE TO GO TO
SENATOR SCHUMER?

WHY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

YOU SAW WITH THE NOMINATION OF
NEIL GORSUCH, YOU SAW THAT
DEMOCRATS DO WANT TO PLAY BALL,
THEY WANTED TO FILIBUSTER.

WE BASICALLY GOT TWO SIDES NOT
WINNING BUT WE GOT A SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE WHICH I THOUGHT
EVERYBODY AGREED ON UNTIL CAME
TO POLITICS.

THAT MIGHT BE GREAT FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT AWFUL FOR
CAPITOL HILL.

MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS, WHY
CAN'T DEMOCRATS OFFER SOMETHING?

DOESN'T MAKE THEM LOOK WEAK?

ONE WORD, POLITICS.

THE DEMOCRATIC POLITIC PARTY ITS
DIVIDED.

THE ONLY THING THEY AGREE ON IS
OPPOSING DONALD TRUMP.

THEY WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
STRATEGY AS WE JUST SAW,
DEMONSTRATIONS, RESISTANCE,
OPPOSITION.

THAT IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WHO
HASN'T SPOKEN TO SCHUMER IN
ABOUT TWO MONTHS HAS TO REACH
OUT.

YOU HAVE LOST 1000 SEATS BETWEEN
HOUSES, PRESIDENCY, CONGRESS,
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU.

RIGHT.

THAT IS THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATS
HAVE COME TO THIS.

ADVOCACY OF IDEAS.

WE SOUGHT WAS SECRETARY CLINTON,
WE SOUGHT IN STATE AFTER STATE,
DOES NOT WORK.

WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FOUND
RECENTLY IS THE OPPOSITION
STRATEGY.

THAT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD DO, AS
YOU ARE SUGGESTING, URGE
BIPARTISANSHIP.

FOR THE PARTY BASE, THE
LEFT-WING, THIS RESPONSE
RESONATES.

EIGHT?

ON THAT WAS CHUCK SCHUMER.

THERE IS SOME DONATION DOLLARS
IN THE HISTORY WITH THEIR
CURRENT PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS A
PRIVATE CITIZEN THAT WENT TO THE
GANG OF EIGHT.

A FEW DOLLARS, NOT A LOT WENT TO
SENATOR SCHUMER AT THE TIME FOR
THE CAUSE THEY WERE WORKING ON.

THEY HAVE SOME HISTORY TOGETHER.

DOES THAT GIVE YOU SOME HOPE
THAT WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH SOME
SORT OF BIPARTISANSHIP?

IT DOES GIVE ME HOPE.

SENATOR SCHUMER HAS MOVED AWAY
FROM WHERE HE WAS IN DECEMBER
WHICH WAS TO WORK WITH THE
 HE'S IN THE OPPOSITION CAN.

RESIST, RESIST, RESIST.

I THINK OF THE PRESIDENT REACHES
OUT WE CAN GET A DEAL
POTENTIALLY ON HEALTHCARE, TAX
REFORM, EVEN IMMIGRATION.

TO BROKER THAT?

I'M NOT KIDDING.

YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE.

I WOULD DO ANYTHING I COULD
TO GET THAT DONE FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

PLEASE CONSIDER NATIONAL THREAT
IS AT LARGE AT THIS HOUR.

THE DETAILS ON THE HUNT FOR THIS
PERSON INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE HAS
A BEEF FOR POLITICIANS.

WHAT ONE MAN SAID TO DONALD
TRUMP.

NOW THE SEARCH IS ON TO FIND
HIM.

THEY'RE CALLING HIM A NATIONAL
THREAT.

ABSOLUTELY.

THIS IS A NATIONAL MANHUNT.

THIS WISCONSIN RESIDENTS ARE ON
EDGE THIS WEEKEND AND
AUTHORITIES ARE KEEPING A CLOSE
EYE OUT ON CHURCHES AFTER
DISCOVERING ALARMING DETAIL IN
THE MANIFESTO.

THIS COMES AFTER POLICE WORKING
ON A TIP RATED AT JANESVILLE
HOME LAST NIGHT.

NOTHING TERMED UP FROM THAT.

150 MEMBERS OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT
ARE SEARCHING AROUND THE CLOCK.

THE STARTED TUESDAY WHEN JOSEPH
-- MAILED HIS LENGTHY MANIFESTO
TO DONALD TRUMP.

IT HAD HATRED FOR
LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND A CALL FOR
REBELLION IN THE CELL PHONE
VIDEO BE FOR PUTTING THE
MANIFESTO IN THE MAIL.

ANYBODY QUÉBEC THAT THIS
LETTER MIGHT WANT TO READ IT.

IT'S A REVOLUTION.

IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE.

LATER THAT NIGHT HE ALLEGEDLY
STOLE 16 FIREARMS FROM A GUN
SHOP, TORTIOUS CAR AND THEN
DISAPPEARED.

PLEASE HAVE BEEN GOING THROUGH
HIS MANIFESTO AND SAY IT MAKES
GENERIC THREATS AT SCHOOLS,
POLICE AND POSSIBLY PLACES OF
WORSHIP.

IT HAS CAUSED LAW-ENFORCEMENT TO
STEP UP PATROL TO CHURCHES AND
OTHER RELIGIOUS OF VENUES.

ONE CHURCH CANCELED ITS PALM
SUNDAY SERVICES THIS WEEKEND.

WE LEARNED HE IS NOT A STRANGER
TO LAW-ENFORCEMENT.

PAST CHARGES INCLUDE BATTERY,
MULTIPLE CHARGES FOR RESISTING
ARREST.

THERE IS ONE SPECIFIC CASE
WHERE HE ATTEMPTED TO DISARM A
POLICE OFFICER.

NOT FOR THE VERY SECURE HOLSTER
OF THIS OFFICER HE WOULD MOST
CERTAINLY DISARMED THAT POLICE
OFFICER.

FOR THAT CRIME HE WAS SENT TO
PRISON.

THE FBI IS OFFERING A
10000-DOLLAR REWARD FOR
INFORMATION THAT LEADS TO HIS
ARREST.

GREAT BRITAIN IS PAYING RESPECTS
TO A POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN
LAST MONTH'S TERROR ATTACK.

QUEEN ELIZABETH GAVE PERMISSION
FOR THE OFFICER COFFIN TO LIE IN
A CHAPEL IN PARLIAMENT.

HE WAS STABBED AND KILLED
ACCORDING TO BRITISH AUTHORITIES
AFTER HE DROVE AN SUV INTO A
CROWD.

PALMER WILL BE LAID TO REST
TOMORROW AFTER FULL POLICE
FUNERAL.

HARRIS THIS IS AWESOME.

AN EYE CATCHING PICTURE HIT
TWITTER, IN PAST HOUR, OLD
POLITICAL RIVALS SHARING A GOOD
TIME, FORMER PRESIDENT BILL
CLINTON TWEETING OUT THIS
PICTURE WITH GEORGE H.W.

BUSH ON
A VISIT TO HOUSTON, THEY TALKED
ABOUT GROWN KIDS, GRAND KIDS,
CLINTON GAVE BUSH A GIFT, A
GREEN PAIR OF SOCKS WITH
LABRADORS AND A BLUE PAIR WITH
BEES.

AND IT TOOK LONGER THAN EXPECTED
BUT WE HAVE A WINNER AT THE
MASTERS, SERGIO GARCIA IS TAKING
HOME THE FAMOUS GREEN JACKET,
EPIC FASHION.

HE WON TOURNAMENT AFTER A
PLAY-OFF HOLE AGAINST JUSTIN
ROSE.

THIS IS GARCIA'S FIRST EVER
MASTERS WIN.

WATCH THIS, IT WAS SOMETHING TO
SEE, HIS FIRST MAJOR
CHAMPIONSHIP, AS WELL.

SO WEARING OF THE GREEN, AND THE
WEARING OF THE SOCKS, IT HAS
BEEN A GOOD HOUR, I'LL SEE YOU
BACK HERE TOMORROW, NOON
EASTERN.

MY FRIEND JESSE WATTERS' WORLD
IS NEXT, WE'RE ABOUT TO BE IN
IT, HAVE A GREAT WEEK.
