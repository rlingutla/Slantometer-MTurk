TONIGHT, SEVERAL BREAKING
STORIES AS WE COME ON THE AIR.

THE MASSACRE IN LAS VEGAS.

NEW IMAGES INSIDE THE KILLER'S
HOTEL ROOM.

THE DOOR BLOWN OFF.

RIFLES ON THE FLOOR.

AND TONIGHT, WE HAVE JUST
LEARNED THE GUNMAN WAS FIRING AT
THE CROWD FOR NINE MINUTES.

AND THIS EVENING, WHAT WE DID
NOT KNOW.

HE HID A CAMERA IN A SERVICE
CART IN THE HOTEL HALLWAY, SO HE
WOULD KNOW WHEN POLICE WERE
MOVING IN.

ALSO TONIGHT, FOR THE FIRST
TIME, WE TAKE YOU INSIDE THE
TRAUMA WARD AT A LAS VEGAS
HOSPITAL.

MORE THAN 100 PATIENTS BROUGHT
TO THIS HOSPITAL ALONE.

TONIGHT, THE SURVIVORS.

ONE OF THEM AT THE CONCERT FOR
 ALSO TONIGHT, PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN PUERTO RICO.

AFTER TWEETING ABOUT PUERTO
RICO, THAT "THEY WANT EVERYTHING
DONE FOR THEM."

TODAY, THE PRESIDENT TOSSING OUT
SUPPLIES.

AT ONE POINT, COMPARING TO WHAT
HE SAW TO A, QUOTE, REAL
CATASTROPHE LIKE KATRINA.

AND HIS MEETING WITH SAN JUAN'S
MAYOR.

IN NEW YORK CITY, THE NEW
IMAGES TONIGHT, THE PRESSURE
COOKER BOMB LEFT ON THE STREET
TO EXPLODE.

AND REMEMBERING AN AMERICAN
ORIGINAL TONIGHT.

TOM PETTY.

AND GOOD EVENING FROM LAS
VEGAS TONIGHT.

WHERE AUTHORITIES CAME BEFORE
THE CAMERAS JUST A SHORT TIME
AGO AND REVEALED SEVERAL
STUNNING FINDINGS TONIGHT.

WE NOW KNOW THE GUNMAN WAS
FIRING FOR NINE MINUTES AFTER
THAT FIRST 911 CALL CAME IN.

THAT HOTEL RIGHT BEHIND ME.

WE ARE SEEING INSIDE THE HOTEL.

THE DOOR THAT S.W.A.T.

TEAMS
BROKE DOWN.

IT TURNS OUT HE HAD A CAMERA
ATTACHED TO A CART IN THE
HALLWAY SO HE WOULD KNOW WHEN
POLICE WERE MOVING IN.

ONE OF THE 23 WEAPONS HE HAD
WITH HIM IN THAT ROOM, THE
EVIDENCE MARKER STILL IN PLACE.

AND TONIGHT, VIDEO OF THAT VERY
ROOM TAKEN BY A TOURIST WHO
STAYED IN THAT ROOM JUST A YEAR
AGO.

AND THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOW,
RIGHT DOWN ONTO THAT CONCERT
SITE.

THE GUNMAN CHECKED INTO THAT
HOTEL WITH TEN SUITCASES.

THOSE SUITCASES WERE FULL OF
WEAPONS.

ABC'S SENIOR NATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT MATT GUTMAN ON THE
SUSPECT'S FINAL 48 HOURS.

â™ª
AT THE HARVEST FESTIVAL.

22,000 PEOPLE JOINING TOGETHER
FOR GOD BLESS AMERICA.

BUT HIGH ABOVE THE LAS VEGAS
STRIP, ANOTHER SPECTATOR WAS
WATCHING THEM.

A MASS MURDERER.

AND JUST ONE HOUR LATER --
[ GUNFIRE ]
TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT
HOW 64-YEAR-OLD STEPHEN PADDOCK
PLANNED HIS ATTACK.

AUTHORITIES SAY HE CHECKED INTO
THE GLITTERING MANDALAY BAY
RESORT LAST THURSDAY.

CHECKED IN, CARRYING MULTIPLE
BAGS AND LIKELY PASSING A SIGN
JUST LIKE THIS.

BUT PADDOCK DIDN'T JUST BRING IN
A FIREARM.

HE BROUGHT AN ARSENAL.

TEN SUITCASES, 23 GUNS.

TODAY, OUR FIRST GLIMPSE INSIDE
THAT HOTEL ROOM.

AN AR-15 SEEN THROUGH THE
BATTERED DOORWAY OF THE
SHOOTER'S LUXURY SUITE.

THAT GUN OUTFITTED WITH A SCOPE
TYPICALLY USED FOR HUNTING AND A
BIPOD TO STABILIZE THE WEAPON.

PARTS OF WHAT EYEWITNESSES
CALLED THAT KILL BOX WERE A FULL
FIVE FOOTBALL FIELDS AWAY FROM
THAT SHOOTER'S PERCH UP THERE ON
IMPOSSIBLE, HAD HE JUST BEEN
USING HANDGUNS INSTEAD OF THOSE
LONG GUNS.

HE SHUTTERED HIMSELF IN HIS
SUITE, TAKING IN ROOM SERVICE,
SAY POLICE, AS THE COUNTRY MUSIC
FESTIVAL KICKED OFF ON FRIDAY,
WAITING.

SUNDAY, THAT JOY TURNING TO
PANIC.

WHEN AT 1008 P.M., HIGH ABOVE
THE CROWDS, POLICE SAY PADDOCK
HAMMERED THROUGH TWO OF THE
HOTEL'S THICK WINDOWS AND
STARTED FIRING DOWN ON THE CROWD
BELOW.

ON THE GROUND, PEOPLE RUNNING,
HUDDLING TOGETHER, SHOTS FIRED
FOR NEARLY NINE MINUTES.

THEN, OFFICERS AND SECURITY
GUARDS SPOT THE SHOOTER.

I SEE THE SHOTS COMING FROM
MANDALAY BAY, HALFWAY UP.

SHOOTER MAY HAVE HAD EYES ON
THEM.

POLICE SAY HE'D SET UP AT LEAST
TWO CAMERAS.

ONE MONITORING THE HALLWAY, SEEN
RIGHT THERE ON THAT SERVICE
CART, POSSIBLY TO MONITOR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.

THE OTHER INSIDE HIS ROOM.

AND WHEN OFFICERS FINALLY BROKE
DOWN THE DOOR --
 BREACH, BREACH, BREACH.

ALREADY DEAD.

JUST SOME CHILLING NEW
DETAILS TONIGHT.

MATT GUTMAN WITH US LIVE IN LAS
VEGAS.

AND MATT, WE KNOW THE GUNMAN
STAYED IN THAT ROOM UNDETECTED
FOR DAYS.

THOSE SUITCASES FULL OF WEAPONS.

EVEN ORDERING ROOM SERVICE
SEVERAL TIMES?

ROOM SERVICE.

IN FACT, THE SHERIFF SAYING THAT
MULTIPLE HOTEL EMPLOYEES HAD
BEEN IN THAT ROOM BEFORE THE
SHOOTING, WHICH BEGS THE MAJOR
QUESTION, GIVEN HOW ELABORATE
PADDOCK'S SETUP HAD BEEN WITH
THOSE TEN CASES OF LUGGAGE, THE
23 FIREARMS, THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS
OF AMMUNITION AND, OF COURSE,
THOSE CAMERAS, HOW NOBODY
NOTICED ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

DAVID?

YEAH, SOMEHOW IT WENT
UNNOTICED.

MATT GUTMAN LEADING US OFF.

MATT, THANK YOU.

AND THERE WAS ANOTHER MAJOR
DEVELOPMENT LATE TODAY.

THE GUNMAN'S LONG-TIME
GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY,
RIGHT NOW, OUT OF THE COUNTRY,
IS NOW BEING CALLED A PERSON OF
INTEREST TONIGHT.

ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS.

LABELED THE SHOOTER'S
GIRLFRIEND, MARILOU DANLEY, AS
CENTRAL TO THE ONGOING
INVESTIGATION, MUCH MORE THAN
SIMPLY ANOTHER WITNESS.

CURRENTLY, SHE'S A PERSON OF
INTEREST.

THE DISCOVERY BY POLICE OF SO
MANY WEAPONS, SO MUCH AMMUNITION
AND EXPLOSIVES AT THE HOME THEY
SHARED IN MESQUITE, NEVADA.

HOW COULD SHE NOT KNOW WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN HER OWN HOUSE
WITH THESE WEAPONS?

SHE HAD TO KNOW SOMETHING, AT
THE VERY LEAST, QUESTION HIM AS
TO WHERE ARE THESE WEAPONS
COMING FROM, WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL
THESE WEAPONS?

DANLEY, WHO USES AN AUSTRALIAN
PASSPORT, TRAVELED TO HER HOME
COUNTRY, THE PHILIPPINES, TWO
WEEKS BEFORE THE SHOOTING, ON
PADDOCK ACTUALLY VISITED HER
FAMILY IN THE PHILIPPINES FOUR
YEARS AGO.

ONE OF THEM POSTED THESE PHOTOS
ON FACEBOOK.

NOW, U.S. OFFICIALS WANT TO KNOW
WHY PADDOCK BEGAN TO TRANSFER
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO
SOMEONE IN THE PHILIPPINES JUST
PRIOR TO THE SHOOTING.

I ANTICIPATE SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO COME IN
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

RELATIVES, DANLEY APPARENTLY MET
PADDOCK AT THIS HOTEL CASINO IN
RENO, WHERE SHE WORKED AS A
HOSTESS TO ENTERTAIN HIGH
ROLLERS, LIKE PADDOCK.

EMPLOYEES AT THIS BAR IN
MESQUITE, AND FORMER NEIGHBORS,
SAY THE COUPLE WERE REGULARS,
DRINKING BEER AND TEQUILA AND
PLAYING VIDEO POKER AND THE
SLOTS.

SO, HE JUST ONE TIME PULLED
HIS PHONE OUT AND SAID, HERE'S A
PICTURE OF THE SLOT MACHINE
WHERE WE WON $20,000.

BRIAN ROSS JOINS US LIVE
TONIGHT.

AND BRIAN, WE HEARD YOUR REPORT
THERE THAT AUTHORITIES ARE NOW
CALLING THE SHOOTER'S GIRLFRIEND
A PERSON OF INTEREST.

THEY'RE MAKING PLANS FOR HER TO
THE FBI IS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN
MAKING SURE SHE GETS ON A PLANE
TO COME BACK TO THE U.S., WHICH
WE'RE TOLD COULD HAPPEN IN THE
NEXT 24 HOURS.

DAVID?

BRIAN ROSS AGAIN TONIGHT.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE WERE
GIVEN ACCESS TODAY TO ONE OF THE
TRAUMA WARDS AT A HOSPITAL RIGHT
HERE IN LAS VEGAS.

ONE OF THE SURGEONS TAKING US
FROM ROOM TO ROOM, AND WE MET
THE SURVIVORS.

ONE OF THEM, A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL
BROUGHT ON THE BACK OF A PICKUP
TRUCK.

THE E.R.

SUDDENLY OVERFLOWING.

DOCTORS DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO
THEY WERE OPERATING ON, IT WAS
HAPPENING SO FAST.

THEY SIMPLY MOVED IN AND SAVED
LIVES.

WE HEAD INTO DESERT SPRINGS
HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER HERE IN
LAS VEGAS.

WHERE MORE THAN 100 VICTIMS WERE
RUSHED IN.

SO, HAVE YOU CAUGHT YOUR BREATH
AT ALL?

PETER CARAVELLA IS A SURGEON
HERE WHO GOT THE EMERGENCY CALL
AT 1100 SUNDAY NIGHT.

WE GOT HERE, THERE WAS
PROBABLY 50 OR 60 PEOPLE IN THE
E.R.

PEOPLE HERE ALREADY?

ALREADY, BEFORE WE GOT HERE.

THERE WERE SO MANY PATIENTS, YOU
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME -- YOU
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO THESE
PATIENTS WERE?

I HAD NO IDEA.

THE E.R.

DOCS REALLY DID A GREAT
JOB.

THEY BASICALLY TRIAGED EVERYBODY
AND SAID, THIS ONE'S CRITICAL,
THIS ONE'S CRITICAL, THIS ONE
NEEDS THIS, THIS ONE NEEDS THAT.

AND WE BASICALLY JUST WENT BED
TO BED TO BED.

WERE PRONOUNCED DEAD SHORTLY
AFTER THEY ARRIVED HERE.

SO MANY OF THE PATIENTS WITH
MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

AND THIS SURGEON TELLS ME, THIS
TIME, IT WAS DIFFERENT.

WE SAW DIFFERENT PIECES OF
MACHINERY AND ARTILLERY THAT
WERE BASICALLY DISPERSED
THROUGHOUT THE ABDOMEN, CHEST.

THOUGH THIS SUSPECT WANTED TO
INFLICT MAXIMUM DAMAGE HERE.

CLEARLY, CLEARLY.

OF THE PATIENTS HE HELPED SAVE.

SHELDON, HOW ARE YOU?

IT JUST KIND OF ALL HAPPENED
SO FAST.

IT SEEMS SURREAL.

JUST A BAD NIGHTMARE I HAVE TO
WAKE UP FROM.

BUT I JUST KEEP SEEING IT IN MY
MIND STILL AND IT JUST HAUNTS
ME.

PLAYING OUT STILL.

YEAH.

VIDEO HE TOOK OF THE CONCERT
JUST MOMENTS BEFORE THE GUNFIRE
BEGAN.

AND YOU WERE SEEING PEOPLE
AROUND YOU GET HIT FIRST?

YEAH, I SAW A GIRL, LIKE TWO
ROWS AHEAD OF ME, AND SHE GOT
HIT IN THE NECK AND WENT DOWN.

HIM.

THEN HE GOT SHOT, TWICE.

IN THE ARM AND IN THE ABDOMEN.

SOME HERO CAME AND SAVED ME,
NAME?

I WISH I DID.

WAY TO THE HOSPITAL WITH YOU.

YEAH, HE WOULDN'T LEAVE MY
SIDE.

SAVED MY LIFE.

STILL WANTS TO MEET THAT HERO,
AND HIS MOM AND DAD WOULD LIKE
TO MEET HIM, TOO.

THEY KNOW THEIR SON STILL HAS SO
MANY QUESTIONS, AMONG THEM, WHY?

HE WAS SAYING, YOU KNOW, WHY
WOULD SOMEONE DO THIS?

SUCH EVIL?

YOU KNOW, I -- I HAVE A LIFE
AHEAD OF ME, WHY DOES SOMEONE
WANT TO KILL ME AND LEAVE ME
LYING ON THIS FIELD AND
EVERYBODY ELSE?

SHOT IN THE ARM AND IT WENT
STRAIGHT THROUGH TO HER ABDOMEN.

IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND AND GOOD
SAMARITANS WHO HELPED SAVE HER,
PUTTING HER IN THE BACK OF A
TRUCK.

WERE YOU IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP
TRUCK?

YEAH, HE ONLY HAD A
TWO-SEATER TRUCK, SO, I WAS
LAYING MANY THE BED WITH HIS
NIGHT OUT OF HER HEAD.

I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, IT STILL
HASN'T FULLY HIT ME.

IT'S KIND OF STARTING TO, BUT --
NOT FULLY.

THINK ABOUT.

I JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S A
LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD IT A LOT
WORSE.

SO, IT'S KIND OF JUST, LIKE,
HARD TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT
OF PEOPLE DEAD FROM IT, TOO.

YOUR DAUGHTER WAS SAYING THAT
THE HARD PART WAS KNOWING SO
MANY PEOPLE DIDN'T GET OUT.

I THINK THAT'S THE HARD PART
FOR ALL OF US.

AND SEEING WHAT WE SAW.

AND I THINK, AS A MOM, KNOWING
THAT THEY HAD TO SEE THAT, AND
THAT'S STUCK WITH THEM FOREVER.

THE SURGEON TOLD US THAT BOTH
OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO
BE OKAY.

AND THEY'RE GRATEFUL TO THOSE
DOCTORS AND NURSES.

AND AS FOR SHELDON, HE WANTS TO
MEET THAT HERO WHO WAS RIGHT
THERE BY HIS SIDE.

THEY BELIEVE THAT THE HERO WAS
GRAZED BY A BULLET, TOO, BUT IS
NO LONGER AT THE HOSPITAL.

SO, IF THAT HERO IS WATCHING
TONIGHT, SHELDON'S FAMILY WANTS
TO THANK YOU.

WE TURN NOW TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP, IN PUERTO RICO TODAY,
MEETING WITH OFFICIALS INCLUDING
THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN.

SHE WENT ON LIVE TV, BEGGING THE
ADMINISTRATION FOR HELP, AND HE
THEN TOOK AIM AT HER ON TWITTER.

HE ALSO TWEETED OF PUERTO RICO,
"THEY WANT EVERYTHING DONE FOR
THEM."

WHAT HIS MESSAGE WAS TODAY WHEN
HE LANDED THERE.

ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL FROM
PUERTO RICO.

A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO A
DISASTER ZONE QUITE LIKE THIS
ONE.

AT A CHURCH IN SAN JUAN,
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOSSED PAPER
TOWELS TO HURRICANE VICTIMS AS
IF HE WERE PLAYING BASKETBALL.

THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE IN THIS
TO PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR, HE
TOUTED THE DEATH COUNT AS IF HE
WERE KEEPING SCORE.

IF YOU LOOK AT A REAL
CATASTROPHE LIKE KATRINA, AND
YOU LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT DIED,
WHAT IS YOUR DEATH COUNT AS OF
THIS MOMENT, 17?

16 CERTIFIED.

16 PEOPLE, CERTIFIED.

16 PEOPLE VERSUS IN THE
THOUSANDS.

TALKED UP THE FEDERAL RECOVERY
EFFORT --
 THE WHOLE TEAM HAS BEEN
AMAZING.

COULDN'T HELP BRINGING UP THE
HIGH COST.

I HATE TO TELL YOU,
PUERTO RICO, BUT YOU'VE THROWN
OUR BUDGET A LITTLE OUT OF
WHACK.

THE MAYOR OF SAN JUAN, WHO THE
PRESIDENT HAS SLAMMED
RELENTLESSLY ON TWITTER FOR
SAYING PUERTO RICO NEEDS MORE
THAN IT'S GETTING.

HOW ARE YOU?

SIR.

NICE TO SEE YOU.

IT'S ALL ABOUT SAVING LIVES,
IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICS.

MAYOR CALLED THE MEETING
PRODUCTIVE.

BUT ON CNN, SHE DISMISSED THE
PRESIDENTIAL VISIT AS PUBLIC
RELATIONS.

RATHER THAN COMMANDER IN
CHIEF, HE SORT OF BECOMES
MISCOMMUNICATOR IN CHIEF.

THERE, WE MET UP WITH HECTOR
GARCIA.

HE HAD NO IDEA THE PRESIDENT WAS
ON THE ISLAND, BUT HE TELLS US,
HE'S HAPPY HE'S HERE.

"HE CAME HERE," GARCIA TOLD US,
"BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'RE IN
CRISIS."

DAVID, THE GOVERNOR'S BEING
DIPLOMATIC TONIGHT.

HE SAYS HE APPRECIATES THE
PRESIDENT'S VISIT AND HIS
COMMITMENT TO THE ISLAND OF
PUERTO RICO.

HE WANTS TO SEE RELIEF EFFORTS
CONTINUE, INCLUDING THINGS LIKE
THE U.S.

NAVAL HOSPITAL SHIP
"COMFORT" BEHIND ME.

THIS JUST GOT HERE TODAY, TWO
WEEKS AFTER THE STORM HIT THE
ISLAND.

DAVID?

JON KARL, OUR THANKS TO YOU
TONIGHT.

AND WE WANT TO LET EVERYONE
AT HOME KNOW THAT WE WERE IN
PUERTO RICO OVER THE WEEKEND,
WHEN THE SHOOTING BROKE OUT HERE
IN LAS VEGAS.

AND BEFORE WE LEFT TO COME HERE,
WE HAD GONE TO A NEIGHBORHOOD,
JUST A SHORT DRIVE FROM WHERE
THE PRESIDENT WAS TODAY.

NEARLY TWO WEEKS AFTER THE
HURRICANE, WE DISCOVERED
FAMILIES IN SWELTERING HEAT, NO
POWER, NO RUNNING WATER -- AND A
CALL FOR HELP.

WE WENT LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT
BUILDING, JUST 15 MINUTES FROM
THE AIRPORT IN SAN JUAN.

BECAUSE WE HAD HEARD THAT NEARLY
TWO WEEKS AFTER THE HURRICANE
HIT, THEY WERE STILL WITHOUT
POWER AND WITHOUT RUNNING WATER.

WE WALK UP THIS DARKENED
STAIRWELL AND DOWN THE HALLWAY.

LIZBETH?

LIZBETH VAZQUEZ DELGADO LIVES IN
NEW YORK CITY, BUT SHE IS HERE,
TAKING CARE OF HER PARENTS.

THE PRESIDENT HAD TWEETED JUST
DAYS AGO, ALL BUILDINGS NOW
INSPECTED.

AND WE WONDERED, HAVE THEY SEEN
ANY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS OR ANY
MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT HERE?

WE HAD HEARD THAT INSPECTORS HAD
BEEN VISITING SOME OF THESE
BUILDINGS, ALL OVER PUERTO RICO.

HAVE YOU SEEN ANY INSPECTORS?

NO.

NOT AT ALL.

THEY HAVE NOT COME TO SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO THESE APARTMENTS.

NO ONE HAS COME.

NONE.

NONE AT ALL.

NO CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

CAN YOU DRINK THE WATER?

NO, WE CANNOT.

AT ALL.

TINY APARTMENT, THEIR WINDOWS
STILL BLOWN OUT BY HURRICANE
MARIA.

AND IN THE BEDROOM, HER PARENTS,
ELMER AND GLORIA, ON THE BED IN
NEED OF MEDICATION.

THIS WAS THE FIRST DAY ANY
DOCTOR HAD PAID A VISIT.

THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE?

THIS IS THE FIRST MEDICINE.

I HAD A PIECE OF BREAD, HALF
OF BREAD AND I SHARED IT WITH,
WE SEE OTHER RESIDENTS, SOME
CARRYING FLASHLIGHTS.

AND WE HEAD INTO ONE OF THOSE
APARTMENTS, WHERE WE MEET A
WOMAN LIZBETH HAS BEEN SHARING
HER BREAD AND WATER WITH.

MARIA DIAZ IS 70, AND SHE TELLS
US, SHE'S BEEN DRINKING THE
WATER FROM THE FAUCET, EVEN
THOUGH SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT SAFE.

SHE HOLDS AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF
WATER.

TELLING US IT COST $6.

WITH LITTLE FOOD AND NO CLEAN
WATER, SHE IS PANIC-STRICKEN,
TELLING ME, "I DON'T WANT TO DIE
HERE."

IN SO MANY OF THESE APARTMENT
BUILDINGS, THEY ARE UNAWARE OF
THE FEMA HELP, BECAUSE THEY HAVE
NO POWER, NO ACCESS TO THE NEWS.

AND TONIGHT, JUST 7% OF THE
ISLAND HAS POWER BACK.

THIS BUILDING DOES NOT.

A GENERATOR IS TURNED ON A
COUPLE OF HOURS A NIGHT.

AND WE WALK UP THE STAIRS,
KNOWING THERE ARE 13 STORIES IN
THIS BUILDING.

AGAIN, THEY TELL US, NO FOOD.

DOWN THE HALL, YOU CAN SEE THE
DESTRUCTION THROUGH THE WINDOW.

WE STEP OVER A DOORWAY BLOWN IN
BY THE HURRICANE.

FLOOR AFTER FLOOR, WE HEAR THE
SAME CONCERNS.

WHILE BACK DOWN ON THE FOURTH
FLOOR, LIZBETH, SHARING WHAT
LITTLE BREAD SHE HAS AND A SLICE
OF CHEESE WITH HER NEIGHBOR.

AND I'M NOT ONLY ASKING FOR
MY PARENTS.

THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE
THAT DON'T HAVE FAMILY.

AND WE CHECKED BACK IN WITH
THEM THIS AFTERNOON, THEY ARE
STILL ASKING FOR HELP TONIGHT.
