ROB, WHERE IS THIS HURRICANE
TONIGHT?

AND YOU HAVE THE NEW MODELS, THE
TIMING, AS IT GETS CLOSER TO THE
FORECAST, DAVID.

FIRST OF ALL, THE CENTER OF THIS
THING IS NOW OFF THE COAST,
ABOUT 75 MILES EAST OF THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

THE MOUNTAINS OF PUERTO RICO
TOOK A LITTLE STEAM OUT OF IT.

IT'S A CATEGORY 2 NOW,
110-MILE-AN-HOUR WINDS.

IT MAY VERY WELL STRENGTHEN
AGAIN AS IT HEADS TOWARDS THE
TURKS AND CAICOS.

SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THE MOST
POPULATED AREAS THERE.

GETTING UP TOWARDS THE CAROLINAS
COME MONDAY.

WHAT IT DOES AFTER THAT,
CERTAINLY SOME QUESTION MARKS,
BUT OUR LONGER TERM MODELS, AS
YOU MENTIONED, DO HAVE IT COMING
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO THE
COASTLINE, MAYBE COMING UP
TOWARDS NEW ENGLAND, MAYBE
TAKING A VERY JOSE-LIKE TRACK.

TOO SOON TO TELL WHETHER IT WILL
IMPACT THE U.S.

DIRECTLY.

BUT SOMETHING WE'LL BE WATCHING
VERY, VERY CLOSELY IN THE COMING
DAYS.

DAVID?

AS WE ALL THINK OF THE PEOPLE
OF PUERTO RICO TONIGHT.

ROB, IN THE MEANTIME, OUR THANKS
TO YOU AND TO VICTOR.

WE TURN NEXT TO THE OTHER
DEVASTATING SCENE UNFOLDING
RIGHT NOW.

THE CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE IN

BUILDINGS COMING DOWN.

PEOPLE TRAPPED.

SO MANY OF THEM CHILDREN.

TONIGHT, WE'RE ON THE SCENE OF A
SCHOOL COLLAPSE.

SOME OF THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN
PULLED OUT.

AND RESCUE CREWS SHOUTING
"SILENCE" SO OFTEN TODAY, IN THE
MOMENTS THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD
HEAR THE CHILDREN.

ABC'S MATT GUTMAN IS ON THE
SCENE TONIGHT.

SCHOOL, RESCUERS PEERING INTO A
HOLE.

SUDDENLY YELLING, "THERE ARE
CHILDREN HERE, THERE ARE
CHILDREN HERE."

THEN, PULLING A SMALL CHILD OUT.

DUSTY, MISERABLE, BUT ALIVE.

HUNDREDS STILL PRYING AWAY AT
THE DEBRIS, HOPING TO UNCOVER A
SIGN OF LIFE.

A LITTLE GIRL, BELIEVED TO BE
ENTOMBED IN THE RUBBLE THAT WAS
ONCE HER SCHOOL, POSSIBLY
COMMUNICATING WITH LOVED ONES BY
TEXT MESSAGES.

TONIGHT, POLICE ESCORTING US
INTO A SEARCH BOTH FRANTIC AND
EERILY QUIET.

FIRST RESPONDERS CRANING IN TO
LISTEN FOR A SIGN OF LIFE.

YOU SEE THOSE HANDS UP IN THE
AIR.

THEY'VE JUST CALLED FOR SILENCE.

THAT MEANS THEY'RE TRYING TO
LISTEN TO SEE IF THEY CAN
ACTUALLY HEAR THE PERSON THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR INSIDE STILL.

THAT SCENE REPEATING ITSELF ALL
AFTERNOON.

BUT SO FAR, THAT MISSING GIRL
HAS NOT BEEN FOUND.

YOU CAN SEE THE DESTRUCTION FROM
OVERHEAD.

"SILENCE" WRITTEN IN HUGE
LETTERS.

THROUGH A WINDOW, CHILDREN'S
BACKPACKS STILL HANGING ON THEIR
HOOKS.

13-YEAR-OLD RODRIGO NARROWLY
PICAESNG
HE SAYS, "WE HAD TO BE EVACUATED
BY CRAWLING OVER A WALL."

THE SCHOOL, ONE OF DOZENS OF
BUILDINGS THAT COLLAPSED IN
CENTRAL MEXICO WHEN THE MASSIVE
7.1 QUAKE STRUCK.

SENDING MILLIONS INTO THE
STREETS.

PEOPLE POSTING TO SOCIAL MEDIA
TO SHOW THE DEVASTATION.

FACADES CRUMBLING.

ACROSS MEXICO CITY, THE
DESPERATE SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS
STARTING IMMEDIATELY, CONTINUING
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

AND AT THE SCHOOL, NEIGHBO
LIKE JESUS AMONG THE FIRST TO
RUSH INTO THE RUBBLE, HEARING
SCREAMING FROM THE INSIDE.

THEN, MAKING A GRIM DISCOVERY.

WE PULLED OUT A KID AND I
SAW -- AND THEY PUT HIS OWN
SWEATER ON HIS FACE AND THEY
PULLED HIM OUT ON THE STRETCHER.

I DON'T THINK HE WAS.

DEAD IN THE SCHOOL ALONE.

11 RESCUED.

THESE HANDWRITTEN PAGES WITH THE
NAMES OF THE WOUNDED AND THEIR
HOSPITALS.

OTHER NOTES LISTING THE MISSING.

DAVID, AN ENTIRE NATION IS
FIXATED ON THE DRAMA PLAYING OUT
JUST BENEATH ME.

NOW, WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR EIGHT
HOURS WATCHING RESCUERS GET
CLOSERND CLOSER TO THAT LITTLE
GIRL.

RIGHT NOW, THEY SEEM
TANTALIZINGLY CLOSE, BUT ONE
THING THEY ALL SAY, THEY ARE NOT
LEAVING HERE UNTIL THEY PULL THE
LAST PERSON OUT OF THAT SCHOOL.

DAVID?

MATT GUTMAN RIGHT THERE IN
MEXICO CITY.

MATT, THANK YOU.

TO THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT,
AND NEW REPORTING HERE ON THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

SPECIAL COUNCIL ROBERT MUELLER
AND HIS NEW STEPESTING ESENT TR
ARE NOW UNDER SCRUTINY,
INCLUDING HIS FIRING OF FBI
DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.

AND THE MEETING WITH RUSSIAN
OFFICIALS IN THE OVAL OFFICE THE
VERY NEXT DAY.

ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL WITH
WHAT HE'S LEARNED TONIGHT.

CLEAREST INDICATION YET SPECIAL
COUNBEG ROL TOUE T MRTHE ACTION
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF.

AS "THE NEW YORK TIMES" FIRST EE
PO
WHITE HOUSE DOCUMENTS
SURROUNDING THE PRESIDENT'S OVAL
OFFICE MEETING WITH RUSSIA
OFFICIALS THE DAY AFTER HE FIRED
FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TOLD THE
RUSSIANS, QUOTE, "I FACED GREAT
PRESSURE BECAUSE OF RUSSIA.

THAT'S TAKEN OFF."

THE NEXT DAY, HE PUBLICLY
ACKNOWLEHE TEDSIUS R
INVESTIGATION WAS ON HIS MIND
WHEN HE FIRED COMEY.

WHEN I DECIDED TO JUST DO IT,
I SAID TO MYSELF, I SAID, YOU
KNOW, THIS RUSSIA THING WITH
TRUMP AND RUSSIA IS A MADE-UP
STORY.

DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE
RESPONSE TO THE NEWS THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S SON, DON JR., MET
WITH RUSSIAN OPERATIVES DURING
THE CAMPAIGN.

AT THE TIME, THE WHITE HOUSE
INSISTED THE MEETING WAS ONLY
ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTIONS AND THE
PRESIDENT PUBLICLY DEFENDED HIS
SON.

MY SON IS A WONDERFUL YOUNG
MAN.

THE MEETING WAS SET UP, QUOTE,
"TO PROVIDE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
WITH SOME OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND
INFORMATION THAT WOULD
INCRIMINATE HILLARY."

WE LATER LEARNED THE PRESIDENT
WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
CRAFTING THAT FIRST MISLEADING
RESPONSE.

AND JON KARL WITH US HERE IN
NEW YORK TODAY.

AND WE LEARNED SOMETHING ELSE
TODAY, THAT THE LEGAL BILLS FOR
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS SON ARE
BEING PAID FOR BY DONATIONS MADE
BY EVERYDAY AMERICANS TO THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.

PERFECTLY LEGAL, BUT IT IS
HIGHLY UNUSUAL, IF NOT
UNPRECEDENTED, FOR A POLITICAL
PARTY TO PAY THE PERSONAL LEGAL
BILLS OF A PRESIDENT AND HIS
FAMILY.

AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $230,000
FOR DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS, AND
ANOTHER $200,000, NEARLY
ALL THE MORE NOTABLE, DAVID,
BECAUSE IN THIS CASE, THE
PRESIDENT IS A BILLIONAIRE.N NE
YORK.

JON, THANKS, AS ALWAYS.

IN THE MEANTIME, NEXT, TO
CAPITOL HILL TONIGHT, AND THE
SENATE'S HAIL MARY PUSH TO KILL
OBAMACARE.

THEIR NEW REPLACEMENT PLAN
TURNING OVER MUCH OF THE
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE STATES.

BUT IT IS RUNNING INTO A LOT OF
OPPOSITION TONIGHT, INCLUDING
FROM LATE NIGHT TV HOST JIMMY
KIMMEL, MAKING HIS PERSONAL
STORY A POLITICAL ONE.

ABC'S MARY BRUCE WITH THE TALLY,
REPUBLICAN SENATORS CAN ONLY
AFFORD TWO "NO" VOTES.

KIMMEL IS TAKING ON THE
ARCHITECT OF THE NEW REPUBLICAN
HEALTH CARE BILL.

AND THIS GUY, BILL CASSIDY,
JUST LIED RIGHT TO MY FACE.

HIS INFANT SON'S HEART
CONDITION.

NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO
DECIDE IF THEY CAN AFFORD TO
SAVE THEIR CHILD'S LIFE.

SENATOR CASSIDY PROMISED HE
WOULD DEFEND PROTECTIONS FOR
PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS.

BUT NOW, KIMMEL SAYS HE'S NOT
LIVING UP TO HIS WORD.

YOU CAN PROMISE THOSE PEOPLE
WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS
THAT THEY WILL NOT BE CHARGEMOR
DISCRIMID NATED AGAINS
T, THEY
WON'T BE DENIED CARE?

ABSOLUTELY.

IT'S IN THE LEGISLATION.

THERE'S NO GUARANTEE.

IN THE NEW BILL, STATES COULD
ALLOW INSURERS TO CHARGE MORE TO
PEOPLE WITH SOME PRE-EXISTING
CONDITIONS.

STATES STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE
ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE
COVERAGE, BUT THOSE TERMS ARE
NOT DEFINED OR ENFORCED.

OPTIONAL PRE-EXISTING
IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE A
PRELIMINARY REPORT NEXT WEEK,
OUTLINING HOW MUCH THE BILL
COSTS, BUT NOT HOW MANY
AMERICANS COULD STAND TO LOSE
COVERAGE.

FOR THAT, THEY NEED MORE TIME.

MARY BRUCE WITH US LIVE
TONIGHT.

'R
STILL WAITING FOR THE CBO SCORE,
WHICH WOULD ESTIMATE HOW MANY
FEWER AMERICANS WOULD BE
INSURED.

IN THE MEANTIME, WE KNOW THAT
REPUBLICANS CAN ONLY AFFORD TO
LOSE TWO VOTES.

FOUR KEY SENATORS TONIGHT, RAND
COLLINS, LISA MURKOWSKI, THEY
COULD ALL BE PIVOTAL HERE.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW, MARY?

STATE OF PLAY.

PAUL TELLS ME HE'S A NO.

COLLINS IS LEANING NO.

MURKOWSKI SAYS SHE'S STUDYING
REPUBLICANS DO NOT HAVE THE
VOTES YET.

BUT THEY INTEND TO HOLD A VOTE
NEXT WEEK.

DAVID?

MARY BRUCE LIVE ON THE HILL
AGAIN TONIGHT.

THANK YOU, MARY.

NEXT, NORTH KOREA REACTING
THIS EVENING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S FIERY ADDRESS AT THE
U.N.

THE PRESIDENT SAYING THE U.S.
MAY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
TOTALLY DESTROY NORTH KOREA,
CALLING ITS LEADER KIM JONG-UN A
ROCKET MAN ON A SUICIDE MISSION.

TONIGHT, NORTH KOREA'S FOREIGN
MINISTER CALLING THOSE REMARKS,
QUOTE, THE SOUND OF A DOG
BARKING, AND THAT NORTH KOREA IS
NOT SCARED.

WE TURN NOW TO THE HORROR
UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW IN MYANMAR.

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE JUST
TODAY TELLINSETYNCO  SG SWG T A
THE ROHINGYA ARE CONSIDERED ONE
OF THE MOST PERSECUTED
MINORITIES ON EARTH.

OUR CAMERAS THERE AS THEY ESCAPE
THEIR HOMES AMID REPORTS OF
TORTURE, RAPE AND ETHNIC
CLEANSING BY THEIR OWN COUNTRY'S
MILITARY.

MYANMAR'S DE FACTO LEADER, ANG
SAN SUU KYI, A NOBEL LAUREATE,
ADDRESSING THE ROHINGYA CRISIS
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE REPORTS
MORE THAN 400,000 HAVE NOW FLED
IN FEAR.

AND ABC'S BOB WOODRUFF TONIGHT,
ON THE FRONT LINES IN MYANMAR.

YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WHAT BOB
FOR THEIR LIVES, HOPING TO
ESCAPE WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS
CERTAIN DEATH.

RISKING IT ALL TO CROSS
ILLEGALLY FROM MYANMAR INTO
BANGLADESH.

PERSECUTED.

WE ARE SCARED.

THERE HAVE BEEN KILLINGS.

EMERGING OF A NEW WAVE OF
ATTACKS UNLEASHED BY GOVERNMENT
FORCES IN MYANMAR ON THE
ROHINGYA, A MUSLIM MINORITY.

THERE ARE REPORTS OF VILLAGES
SURROUNDED, HOMES BURNED TO THE
GROUND, TORTURE, EXECUTIONS AND
RAPE.

SO, WE TRAVELED TO BANGLADESH TO
SPEAK WITH SURVIVORS OF
GOVERNMENT ATTACKS.

ATTACKS SUCH AS THIS ONE.

ROHINGYA VILLAGERS SEEN HERE
STRUCK REPEATEDLY BY POLICE.

EVERYONE WE ENCOUNTER WANTS TO
SHARE THEIR STORY.

DID YOU SEE GUN FIRE?

DID YOU SEE ATTACKS FROM THE
GOVERNMENT?

WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

THIS IS THE NAF RIVER,
SEPARATING MYANMAR FROM
BANGLADESH.

JUST ACROSS THE WATER THERE IN
RAKHINE IS WHERE THE ATTACKS
AGAINST THE ROHINGYA ARE
REPORTED TO BE UNFOLDING.

MYANMAR AUTHORITIES ARE NOT
HOLDING ANYBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR
THE CRIMES THAT ARE BEING
PERPETRATED AGAINST THE CIVILIAN
POPULATION.

S LIMIE  ERYTA
 AND BOB WOODRUFF IS WITH US
NOW.

AND BOB, WE MENTIONED THEIR DE
FACTO LEADER, ANG SAN SUU KYI,
CONDEMNED IT YET.

CONDEMNED IT YET.

THERE'S A LIST OF LEADERS AROUND
THE WORLD THAT ARE CRITICIZING
FOR THIS, INCLUDING THE POPE.

THE STRONGEST WORDS SO FAR,
REALLY, ARE FROM VICE PRESIDENT
PENCE TODAY, WHERE HE CALLED ON
MYANMAR TO, QUOTE, END THEIR
VIOLENCE IMMEDIATELY AND SUPPORT
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS FOR A
LONG-TERM SOLUTION.

OPTION.
