THIS IS "WORLD NEWS."

TONIGHT, BREAKING NEWS IN THE
HEARTLAND.

TORNADOES TOUCHING DOWN RIGHT
NOW.

30 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE
STORM ZONE.

THIS EVENING, THE NEW WARNINGS
AND THE GIANT TWISTERS CAUGHT ON
TAPE.

METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT ALL TONIGHT.

OFF THE RAILS.

THE DRAMATIC MOMENTS RIGHT AFTER
THAT MAJOR COMMUTER TRAIN
DERAILED, SMASHING INTO ANOTHER.

AND TONIGHT, YET ANOTHER TRAIN
OFF THE TRACKS.

THE WARNINGS FOR TOMORROW
MORNING'S COMMUTE.

THE ONE AND ONLY.

THAT RECORD POWERBALL JACKPOT.

AND WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE
ONE WINNING TICKET.

AND WHY THIS WINNER HAS NO
CHOICE.

THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY
ANONYMOUS.

AND HER TURN.

AFTER THAT FAMOUS OSCAR MOMENT,
BEN AFFLECK TELLING THE WORLD
HIS MARRIAGE WAS WORK.

HIS WIFE, ACTRESS JENNIFER
GARNER, GETTING THE LAST LAUGH.

A GIFT.

I WOULD HAVE SAID, THANK YOU
TO MY WIFE.

OUR MARRIAGE IS A GIFT.

GOOD EVENING.

AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH
US HERE ON A SUNDAY NIGHT.

AND WE DO BEGIN WITH A DANGEROUS
SCENE PLAYING OUT ACROSS MUCH OF
THE HEARTLAND AT THIS HOUR.

SEVERAL CITIES TAKING COVER.

AND THESE PICTURES JUST COMING
IN FROM OKLAHOMA CITY TONIGHT.

YOU CAN SEE THE FIERCE CLOUDS
THERE, DARKENING THE HORIZON,
SENDING DEBRIS IN EVERY
DIRECTION.

KNOCKING OUT POWER ALREADY.

GINGER ZEE HAD BEEN WARNING ALL
OF US OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS
THAT THIS SUNDAY EVENING, THE
SEVERE WEATHER WOULD TAKE AIM AT
FAR MORE POPULATED AREAS.

THAT'S WHAT'S UNFOLDING AT THIS
HOUR.

IT'S BELIEVED THERE'S
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE.

ALL OF IT UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW.

I WANT TO BRING IN GINGER,
OUTSIDE WICHITA, KANSAS,
TONIGHT.

THE SKY DARKENING AS SHE WAS
JUST READY TO COME ON THE AIR
FOR US.

GINGER?

DAVID, WE'VE BEEN STORM
CHASING ALL AFTERNOON.

AND LOOK BEHIND ME.

THAT IS THE STORM THAT BROUGHT
THE TORNADO RIPPING THROUGH
WICHITA, KANSAS.

IT'S MOVING TO OUR NORTH AND
EAST.

THERE'S A TORNADO ON THE GROUND
NEAR OKLAHOMA CITY.

THIS IS AN ACTIVE AND FLUID
SITUATION.

WE'LL BRING YOU THE LATEST
DETAILS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

BUT LOOK AT THE WILD WEATHER SO
FAR.

IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US.

KANSAS LANDSCAPE, MULTIPLE
VIOLENT TORNADOES.

WATCH AS LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES
THIS TWISTER IN SANFORD, KANSAS.

THAT TORNADO ALSO TOUCHED DOWN
NEAR ROSEL, WHERE IT WAS CAUGHT
FROM EVERY, SINGLE ANGLE.

AND BIG HAIL COMING DOWN.

PUMMELING THIS WINDSHIELD IN
NEBRASKA.

IN OKLAHOMA CITY,
60-MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS TOPPLED
POWER LINES ON SATURDAY.

THERE'S BEEN NEARLY 400 REPORTS
OF SEVERE WEATHER IN JUST THE
LAST 2 DAYS.

MAJOR HIGHWAYS TURNING INTO
RIVERS.

THESE SEMIS STUCK IN NORTH
DAKOTA.

AND IN GEORGIA, PARTS OF ATLANTA
UNDER WATER.

ROADS CRUMBLED AFTER UP
TO SEVEN INCHES OF RAIN FELL
OVERNIGHT.

THE STEADY AND INTENSE DOWNPOUR,
FLOODING BACKYARDS.

THIS PLAYSET SUBMERGED FROM THE
RISING WATERS.

IT RAINED FROM 200 UNTIL
600, NONSTOP.

STORMS ON THE WAY.

DAVID, THE THREAT IS FAR FROM
OVER.

LET ME SHOW YOU THIS MAP.

TONIGHT, HERE IS WHO NEEDS TO BE
CONCERNED.

ANYWHERE FROM OKLAHOMA CITY TO
KANSAS CITY.

THAT'S THE IMMEDIATE THREAT.

BUT THE LARGE, SEVERE WEATHER
THREAT GOES FROM MINNESOTA TO
TEXAS.

AND TOMORROW, THE STORM MOVES
SLOWLY TO THE EAST, FROM
CHICAGO, DOWN TO TEXAS.

ALL OF THE PLAINS INCLUDED HERE.

GOING TO BE A TORNADIC AND
SEVERE WEATHER DAY.

DAVID?

THAT'S A HUGE STORM ZONE,
GINGER.

GINGER WILL STAY ON THIS
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND
STRAIGHT THROUGH TO "GOOD
MORNING AMERICA" FIRST THING IN
THE MORNING.

AS THAT UNFOLDS, ANOTHER
MYSTERY UNFOLDING TONIGHT.

THE QUESTION, WHO IS AMERICA'S
NEW MULTIMILLIONAIRE?

HARD TO BELIEVE, BUT THERE WAS
JUST ONE WINNING TICKET
IN THE GIANT POWERBALL LOTTERY
OVERNIGHT.

AND IT WAS SOLD IN ZEPHYRHILLS,
FLORIDA.

HERE ARE THE WINNING NUMBERS,
10, 13, 14, 22, 52.

THE POWERBALL WAS 11.

AND YOU DON'T NEED US TO TELL
YOU.

THE JACKPOT WAS $590.5 MILLION.

SOMEONE HERE DID THE MATH TODAY,
LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE INCOME
FOR ZEPHYRHILLS.

IT WOULD TAKE THE AVERAGE PERSON
WHO LIVES THERE 28,000 YEARS TO
MAKE THAT MUCH.

BUT FOR SOMEONE OR SOME GROUP,
THEY MADE THAT IN AN INSTANT.

ABC'S STEVE OSUNSAMI, IN THAT
TOWN TONIGHT.

IT'S A RECORD-BREAKING
JACKPOT.

THING TO HAPPEN IN ZEPHYRHILLS,
FLORIDA.

KNOWN FOR ITS LARGE
NEIGHBORHOODS OF GROOVY SENIORS
AND A PRETTY POPULAR BRAND OF
BOTTLED WATER.

ZEPHYRHILLS.

VALUABLE WINNING TICKET EVER.

WORTH MORE THAN $500 MILLION.

AND SOMEONE HERE IS WALKING
AROUND TOWN WITH IT BURNING IN
THEIR POCKET.

COULD BE A FRIEND.

COULD BE FAMILY.

I HOPE SO.

IT WILL BE KNOWN WHO WINS.

IT'S A SMALL TOWN.

AND EVERYBODY TALKS.

STORE THAT SOLD THE WINNING
TICKET, THEY TELL US THEY'VE
BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH CALLS FROM
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, FROM REALLY
FRIENDLY RELATIVES TO CHECK TO
SEE IF THEY WON.

THIS GUY TOLD US HE'S KEEPING
THE DREAM ALIVE, REFUSING TO
CHECK HIS TICKETS UNTIL LATER
TONIGHT.

I COULD BE THE WINNER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE AN URGENCY
TO CHECK?

YOU SEE, THE ANTICIPATION IS
MORE OF A PLEASURE THAN ACTUALLY
LOSING, WHICH IS MOSTLY WHAT
HAPPENS.

I ANTICIPATE LONGER.

AND I'M A BILLIONAIRE UNTIL I
FIND OUT.

WORTH $590.5 MILLION.

THAT'S ONLY IF THE WINNER TAKES
ANNUAL PAYMENTS.

TAKE IT AT ONCE AND IT'S NEARLY
$371 MILLION.

THE LOTTERY WITHHOLDS 25% IN
FEDERAL TAXES.

BUT IN FLORIDA, THERE'S NO STATE
TAX, GREAT NEWS FOR THE WINNER.

WHO IS LEFT WITH ABOUT
$278 MILLION AND CHANGE.

THE RUMOR MILL IS ON FIRE.

IS IT ONE OF THE TOWN'S SENIORS?

OR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WORKS AT A
STORE?

FLORIDA SAW SAYS THE WINNER MUST
COME FORWARD TO CLAIM THE MONEY.

THE TICKET THAT WON IT ALL WAS
SOLD AT THIS FLORIDA GROCERY
STORE.

STATE LOTTERY OFFICIALS SAY
THEIR OFFICE IN TALLAHASSEE WILL
BE OPEN BRIGHT AND EARLY
TOMORROW MORNING.

THAT'S THE SOONEST WE COULD HEAR
FROM A WINNER.

DAVID?

STEVE, THANK YOU.

SOMEONE OR SOME GROUP NOT
HEADING BACK TO WORK TOMORROW
MORNING.

BUT FOR THE REST OF US WHO
ARE, A MORNING HEADACHE IN MUCH
OF THE COUNTRY.

ANOTHER TRAIN OFF THE TRACKS
TONIGHT.

TWO THIS WEEKEND.

AMTRAK TRAIN DERAILING NEAR
CHICAGO'S UNION STATION TODAY.

197 PASSENGERS ONBOARD THE TRAIN
FROM NEW ORLEANS.

NO ONE WAS HURT.

BUT THIS COMES JUST AS WE GET
NEW IMAGES FROM THE DERAILMENT
FRIDAY NIGHT.

THAT TRAIN FROM NEW YORK TO
CONNECTICUT AND THE STRUGGLE TO
SAVE THE INJURED.

ABC'S GIO BENITEZ WITH THE NEWS
THAT THOSE TRACKS WILL NOT BE UP
AND RUNNING FOR SOME TIME TO
COME.

IMPACT, CAPTURED BY TEENAGERS
SKATEBOARDING NEAR THE ACCIDENT
SITE.

ALL I HEAR IS A BIG BOMB
BEHIND ME, OVER THERE.

AND JUST A BIG DUST CLOUD.

HIS FRIENDS GOT UP CLOSE AND SAW
THE AFTERMATH.

THE TRACK, LIKE IT'S OFF THE
TRACKS.

LOOK AT THIS.

IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE
THAT.

METRO NORTH COMMUTER TRAIN, FROM
NEW YORK CITY TO NEW HAVEN,
CONNECTICUT, DERAILED IN
BRIDGEPORT CARRYING 300
PASSENGERS.

ANOTHER TRAIN WITH 400
PASSENGERS ONBOARD, HIT THAT
DERAILED TRAIN.

AT LEAST 70 PEOPLE WERE INJURED.

THE POLICE ARE COMING.

EVERYONE'S PANICKING.

SEE THE CHAOS AND CONFUSION.

BUT ALSO, THE RUSH TO HELP THE
PASSENGERS ONBOARD.

ONE WOMAN, UNABLE TO WALK IS
PULLED OUT.

IS THERE A BABY IN THERE?

YOU HEAR ABOUT THE STORIES ON
THE TELEVISION.

YOU'RE LIKE, OH, IT'S NOT SO
BAD.

BUT TO ACTUALLY LIVE IT AND SEE
IT, DOCUMENT IT, IT'S LIKE A
WHOLE DIFFERENT THING.

AND IT JUST HITS.

YOU.

OF THE TRAIN CARS WERE REMOVED.

INVESTIGATORS ARE SENDING A
BROKEN PIECE OF RAIL TO BE
ANALYZED AT A GOVERNMENT LAB.

IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY
THE ACCIDENT ITSELF.

IT COULD HAVE BEEN BROKEN PRIOR
TO THE ACCIDENT.

COMMUTE.

HERE AT GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL
IN NEW YORK, THE 30,000 PEOPLE
WHO RELY ON THAT LINE WILL HAVE
TO FIND A NEW WAY TO TRAVEL.

THAT'S BECAUSE PARTS OF THOSE
TRACKS WILL BE SHUT DOWN FOR
DAYS, DAVID.

AMTRAK SERVICE AFFECTED, AS
WELL, GIO.

AND OUR THANKS TO YOU, FROM
GRAND CENTRAL TONIGHT.

WE TURN TO THE HORRIFIC HOME
INVASION IN WHICH A COLLEGE
STUDENT WAS KILLED.

HER TWIN SISTER, WITNESSING IT
ALL.

WHEN THE SUSPECT INSIDE, POLICE
ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.

THAT'S WHEN THE SUSPECT PUTS ONE
OF THE YOUNG WOMEN IN A HEADLOCK
AND TAKES AIM AT THE OFFICERS.

THEY SHOOT BACK.

THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS KILLED.

SHE WAS REMEMBERED, TODAY, AT
THE HOFSTRA GRADUATION.

HERE'S ABC'S LINZIE JANIS.

TURNED BITTERSWEET.

OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE
WITH ANDREA'S FAMILY.

AND WITH HER FRIENDS AND
CLASSMATES.

HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY, WEARING
WHITE RIBBONS AND PAUSING FOR A
MOMENT OF SILENCE TO HONOR
FELLOW STUDENT ANDREA REBELLO.

JUST TWO DAYS AGO, SHE WAS
KILLED DURING AN ARMED ROBBERY
AT HER OFFCAMPUS HOME.

AFTER A NIGHT OUT CELEBRATING
THE END OF FINALS, REBELLO AND
HER TWIN SISTER, JESSICA,
RETURNED HOME WITH A ROOMMATE
AND A FRIEND.

THAT'S WHEN POLICE SAY
30-YEAR-OLD DALTON SMITH CAME IN
THROUGH AN UNLOCKED DOOR AND
ROBBED THEM.

SMITH TOOK VALUABLES.

BUT HE WANTED MORE.

SO, HE SENT THE TWIN'S ROOMMATE
TO AN ATM.

SHE BOLTED AND CALLED 911.

HE TOLD HER IF SHE DID NOT
RETURN WITHIN EIGHT MINUTES, HE
WOULD KILL ONE OF THE
INDIVIDUALS IN THE HOUSE.

OFFICERS ARRIVED TO FIND SMITH
HOLDING REBELLO IN A HEADLOCK.

POINTING A GUN SAYING, I'LL KILL
HER.

ONE OFFICER INSIDE WITH THE
HOSTAGES AND THE GUNMAN.

SHOTS FIRED.

WE HAVE A SUBJECT DOWN.

HIS GUN AT THE POLICE OFFICER,
THE OFFICER FIRED EIGHT SHOTS.

SEVEN STRIKING AND KILLING THE
SUSPECT.

AND ONE BULLET TAKING REBELLO'S
LIFE, TOO.

TONIGHT, ANDREA'S FAMILY ARE
MOURNING THE LOSS OF THEIR
DAUGHTER, WHO WAS AN INSPIRATION
TO MANY.

ANDREA HAD A BIT OF ADVICE
SHE TOOK FROM A BOB MARLEY SONG.

IT WAS, LIVE THE LIFE YOU LOVE
AND LOVE THE LIFE YOU LIVE.

FIRED THE SHOTS IS DESCRIBED AS
HIGHLY DECORATED.

POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING THE
SHOOTING.

WE SPOKE TO SEVERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WHO SAY
THAT POLICE OFFICER HAD NO
CHOICE BUT TO SHOOT ONCE THE
SUSPECT TURNED THE GUN ON HIM.

AN AWFUL SCENE INSIDE THAT
HOME.

AND A TOUGH DAY AT HOFSTRA.

WE'RE TURNING TO IRAN, WHERE
STATE RADIO IS REPORTING THAT
TWO MEN HAVE BEEN EXECUTED FOR
SPYING FOR THE CIA.

THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED BY
TEHRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD
COURT AND WERE HANGED AT DAWN.

IRAN REGULARLY ACCUSES THE U.S.
AND ISRAEL OF SPYING.

PARTICULARLY ON ITS NUCLEAR
PROGRAM.

AND NORTH KOREA, ADDING ONE
MORE ROCKET LAUNCH TO THIS
WEEKEND.

A SHORT-RANGE MISSILE FELL INTO
THE WATERS OFF NORTH KOREA'S
COAST TODAY.

THE LAUNCH HAS SET BACK RECENT
MOVES TO EASE TENSIONS ON THE
KOREAN PENINSULA AND APPEAR TO
HAVE BEEN PROVOKED BY THE
ARRIVAL OF THE U.S. AIRCRAFT
CARRIER, "NIMITZ" IN THE REGION.

NOW, TO THE IRS TARGETING
TEA PARTY AND SPECIAL GROUPS FOR
SCRUTINY.

THE WHITE HOUSE OF COURSE UNDER
FIRE BECAUSE TREASURY DEPARTMENT
OFFICIALS WERE TOLD OF THE IRS
INVESTIGATION A YEAR AGO.

BUT TONIGHT, WE HAVE LEARNED
THAT SOME REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS WERE ALSO TOLD BACK
THEN.

ABC'S REENA NINAN JOINING US
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

REENA, GOOD EVENING.

EVENING.

A SENIOR OBAMA ADVISER SAID THE
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS WERE FIRST
MADE AWARE OF THE IRS PROBE IN
LATE.

NT OBAMA
LEARNED ABOUT IT WHEN THE STORY
WAS REPORTED IN THE MEDIA.

WHITE HOUSE AIDE DAN PFEIFFER
ALSO SAYS NO ORDERS WERE GIVEN
TO THE IRS TO GO AFTER TEA PARTY
GROUPS.

BOTTOM LINE, NO COMMUNICATION
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW FROM THE
WHITE HOUSE, TO THE IRS, ABOUT
THIS TARGETING?

NO.

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

WHETHER IT'S LEGAL OR ILLEGAL,
IS NOT IMPORTANT TO THE FACT
THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE MATTER.

WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

OFFICIALS LEARNED OF THE
INVESTIGATION LAST YEAR AND
APPARENTLY SO DID REPUBLICANS.

THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT
COMMITTEE KNEW OF THE PROBE IN
JUNE.

AND ROUGHLY, WHAT WOULD BE IN AN
IRS INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT.

I KNEW WHAT WAS APPROXIMATELY
IN IT WHEN WE MADE THE
ALLEGATIONS A YEAR AGO.

REPUBLICANS THAT CALLED FOR A
DEEPER INVESTIGATION.

I THINK A SPECIAL COUNCIL IS
GOING TO END UP BEING NECESSARY
HERE.

MEANWHILE, ADMITS THE TARGETING
WAS WRONG.

BUT THE WHITE HOUSE WILL ONLY GO
SO FAR.

WHAT WE'RE NOT PARTICIPATING
IN IS PARTISAN FISHING
EXPEDITIONS DESIGNED TO DISTRACT
FROM THE REAL ISSUES AT HAND.

HEARINGS ON THE HILL THIS WEEK.

AND REPUBLICANS ARE CALLING FOR
A WIDER INVESTIGATION.

AND QUESTIONING THE IRS' FUTURE
ROLE IN IMPLEMENTING HEALTH CARE
REFORM.

DAVID?

THIS IS NOT GOING AWAY.

REENA NINAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE
TONIGHT.

REENA, THANK YOU.

NOW, A COMEBACK TO REPORT
TONIGHT.

THE TROUBLED DREAMLINER IS
RETURNING TO AMERICA'S SKIES.

UNITED AIRLINES WILL FLY
BOEING'S NEW JUMBO JET TOMORROW.

THE FIRST FLIGHT SINCE THE
ENTIRE FLEET WAS GROUNDED IN
JANUARY BECAUSE OF BATTERY
PROBLEMS.

A TEAM FROM ABC NEWS WILL BE ON
THE FLIGHT.

WE'LL BE REPORTING FROM HOUSTON
TO CHICAGO.

THERE IS MUCH MORE AHEAD ON
"WORLD NEWS" THIS SUNDAY NIGHT.

HIGH-POWERED ADVICE FOR
GRADUATES.

FROM THE PRESIDENT.

FROM THE FIRST LADY.

FROM THE ACTRESS WHO DELIVERS
HER LINES IN THE WEST WING.

IT'S WHAT ONE FAMOUS MAYOR
SAID THAT LED TO THIS IMAGE, THE
PLUNGER ON HIS HEAD.

BUT DOES HE HAVE A POINT?

WEIGH IN, RIGHT AFTER THE BREAK.

WELL, GRADUATION SEASON IS
UPON US TONIGHT.

THE PRESIDENT AMONG THE
HEADLINERS OFFERING ADVICE THIS
WEEKEND.

SOME OF IT A BIT STINGING.

AND THERE WAS THE FAMOUS MAYOR
WHO SUGGESTED STUDENTS WHO ARE
SO-SO, IN HIS WORDS, TO SKIP
COLLEGE COMPLETELY, BECOMING A
PLUMBER.

MAKING THE CASE WHY, ABC'S SUSAN
SAULNY.

I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE JUST
GRADUATING, THANK YOU, LORDY.

SUGAR-COATING REALITY THE IN THE
COMMENCEMENT SPEECH PRESIDENT
OBAMA DELIVERED TO MOREHOUSE
COLLEGE IN THE RAIN.

WHATEVER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH,
IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE
HARDSHIPS OF PREVIOUS
GENERATIONS.

REALITY THAN ANYTHING.

MICHELLE WILL TELL YOU I'M
FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA TOLD A
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATING CLASS IN
NASHVILLE, TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS,
THEY MUST EXPERIENCE FAILURE.

I COULD TAKE UP A WHOLE
AFTERNOON TALKING ABOUT HIS
FAILURES.

HE LOST HIS FIRST RACE FOR
CONGRESS.

AND NOW, HE GETS TO CALL HIMSELF
MY HUSBAND.

PRESIDENTS, KERRY WASHINGTON,
WHO PLAYS AN ADVISER TO ONE ON
ABC'S HIT "SCANDAL," ADDRESSED
STUDENTS AT HER ALMA MATER,
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY.

YOU CAN FOLLOW SOMEONE ELSE'S
SCRIPT, TRYING TO MAKE CHOICES
THAT MAKE OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY.

OR YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL
YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY AND
USE IT AS FUEL TO VENTURE FORTH
AND WRITE YOUR OWN STORY.

ALTOGETHER?

TO BE A PLUMBER?

THAT'S WHAT MIKE BLOOMBERG'S
DEBATABLE ADVICE TO WHAT HE
CALLED SO-SO STUDENTS ON HIS
WEEKLY RADIO SHOW.

THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS" HAD
FUN WITH THE IDEA.

BEING A PLUMBER ACTUALLY FOR
THE AVERAGE PERSON PROBABLY
WOULD BE A BETTER DEAL BECAUSE
YOU DON'T SPEND FOUR YEARS
SPENDING $40,000, $50,000,
TUITION WITH NO INCOME.

UP AFTER THE MAYOR'S COMMENTS,
WITH MANY PEOPLE AGREEING WITH
HIM.

OTHERS SAID BY HIS LOGIC, EVEN
EINSTEIN, WHO WAS A SO-SO
STUDENT, WOULD HAVE BEEN A
PLUMBER.

EINSTEIN WAS A SO-SO STUDENT.

BUT WE NEED GOOD PLUMMERS.

IT'S HOW HE DELIVERED THAT
ADVICE.

SUSAN, GREAT TO HAVE YOU
ONBOARD, BY THE WAY.

WHEN WE COME BACK HERE
TONIGHT, TO REMEMBERING THE
ACTRESS AND THAT NIGHTMARE
20,000 FEET.

AND YOU'LL REMEMBER THIS.

BEN AFFLECK FAMOUSLY TELLING
TENS OF MILLIONS HIS MARRIAGE
WAS WORK AT THE OSCARS.

HIS WIFE, JENNIFER GARNER,
GETTING THE LAST LAUGH THIS
WEEKEND.

WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR WHAT SHE
SAID ABOUT THEIR MARRIAGE BEHIND

NOW, TO OUR "INSTANT INDEX"
WHAT'S TRENDING RIGHT NOW.

A HOLLYWOOD PASSING TO TELL YOU
ABOUT TONIGHT.

CHRISTINE WHITE, BEST KNOWN FOR
HER PORTRAYAL OF A WIFE OF A
YOUNG WILLIAM SHATNER.

SHE TURNED TO HER HUSBAND AS THE
FLIGHT IS TAKING OFF, AND SAYS,
HONEY, YOU ARE CURED.

HE SUFFERS ANOTHER NERVOUS
BREAKDOWN.

WHITE ALSO APPEARED ON EPISODES
OF "BONANZA," PERRY MASON," AND
"FATHER KNOWS BEST."

SHE WAS 86.

THE ASK ANY MARRIED COUPLE
THAT A MARRIAGE IS WORK.

BUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT IN FRONT
OF TENS OF MILLIONS, IT GETS
SOME ATTENTION.

BEN AFFLECK, DURING A SPEECH HE
SAID TO HIS WIFE, JENNIFER
GARNER, IN THE AUDIENCE, I WANT
TO THANK YOU ON WORKING ON OUR
MARRIAGE.

IT'S WORK.

HE TOOK A LOT OF HEAT.

WHILE HOSTING "SNL" HE INVITED
HIS WIFE ON TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF.

AND SHE HAD A FEW CHOICE WORDS
FOR HIM.

OUR MARRIAGE IS A WORK OF
LOVE.

WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE CALLED IT IN
THE SPEECH?

A GIFT.

I WOULD HAVE SAID THANK YOU TO
MY WIFE.

OUR MARRIAGE IS A GIFT.

IT'S A GIFT, TO THE WORK OF
MARRIAGE, WHICH YOU GIFTED ME,
WITH ENORMOUS WORK.

IF WE'RE GOING TO BE
COMPLETELY HONEST HERE, WHY
DON'T WE MENTION WHO DOES ALL OF
THE WORK.

I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I WISH
I HAD ENDED THAT SPEECH.

OKAY?

I COULDN'T DO ANY OF THE THINGS
THAT I DO, WITHOUT YOUR SUPPORT.

YOU ARE MY ANGEL, MY LIFE AND MY
WORLD.

YOU'RE READING THAT.

A LITTLE HELP ON THE CUE
CARD.

THEY LOOK PRETTY HAPPY TO ME.

AND WHEN WE COME BACK, THE
STAR-MANGLED BANNER.

YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS ONE TO
BELIEVE IT.
