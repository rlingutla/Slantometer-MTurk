FROM THAT NIGHT.

ALSO TONIGHT, WERE THERE TWO
OTHER CITIES THE GUNMAN WAS
LOOKING INTO?

CHICAGO AND BOSTON.

AND THE GIRLFRIEND, THE FBI
INTERVIEW AND WHAT SHE'S NOW
SAYING.

AND ABC NEWS OBTAINING THIS
CHECK.

THEIR PURCHASE IN THE WEEKS
BEFORE.

A STATE OF EMERGENCY
DECLARED TONIGHT IN NEW ORLEANS.

PREPARING FOR A POSSIBLE
HURRICANE.

THE DEADLY STORM ALREADY.

THE PATHS THEN HAVING IT
TRAVELING RIGHT UP TO THE
NORTHEAST.

BREAKING NOW.

THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN
CAUGHT UP IN A SEX SCANDAL.

HE HAS JUST GIVEN HIS TWO WEEKS
NOTICE.

THE NFL STAR UNDER FIRE
TONIGHT.

RESPONDING TO A FEMALE REPORTER,
TELLING HER, "IT'S FUNNY TO HEAR
A FEMALE TALK ABOUT ROUTES."

AND THE MAN BEHIND SOME OF
THE BIGGEST MOVIES OF OUR TIME,
AND TONIGHT, HIS VERY PUBLIC
APOLOGY TO THE WOMEN HE'S WORKED
WITH.

GOOD EVENING.

AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH
US HERE ON A THURSDAY NIGHT.

AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH MAJOR
NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAS
VEGAS MASSACRE.

WE ARE LEARNING THE KILLER MAY
HAVE SCOUTED OTHER POTENTIAL
TARGETS IN CHICAGO AND IN
BOSTON.

AND THE DRAMATIC NEW VIDEO FROM
THAT NIGHT.

RUN!

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

GO!

KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

GO.

JUST AFTER THE GUNFIRE BEGAN,
CAN YOU HEAR THE OFFICERS
TELLING THE THOUSANDS TO RUN FOR
THEIR LIVES.

HELPING THE VICTIMS WHO HAD BEEN
SHOT AND WHO HAD FALLEN.

AND TONIGHT, OUR TEAM FLYING
BESIDE THE HOTEL AND OVER THE
MASSIVE CRIME SCENE WHERE THE
FBI IS STILL CAREFULLY COMBING
THROUGH THE EVIDENCE.

ABC'S SENIOR NATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT MATT GUTMAN
LEADING US OFF AGAIN TONIGHT.

HELICOPTER HERE IN LAS VEGAS FOR
THE FIRST LOOK TONIGHT INTO
STEPHEN PADDOCK'S SNIPER'S NEST.

HIGH ABOVE THE LAS VEGAS STRIP
AT THE GILDED DE.CAFATHF  OE
INSIDE ONE SHATTERED WINDOW,
PILLOWS STACKED HIGH ON A
STRIPPED BED.

THE OTHER WINDOW, PARTIALLY
BLOCKED BY PLYWOOD.

BUT INSIDE, INVESTIGATORS
CAREFULLY DISSECTING THE SCENE.

DOWN BELOW, YOU CAN SEE FBI
AGENTS PICKING THROUGH EVERY
SINGLE PIECE OF DEBRIS DOWN
THERE ON THE FAIRGROUNDS FLOOR.

THEY DON'T WANT TO MISS
ANYTHING, A SINGLE BULLET
FRAGMENT OR A SINGLE PIECE OF
EVIDENCE.

THIS IS THE AFTERMATH.

BUT TONIGHT, NEW VIDEO GIVES NEW
INSIGHT INTO THE CHAOS ON THE
TRIGGERING HYSTERIA, CONFUSION.

SHOCKINGLY, PEOPLE SEEM UNABLE
TO PROCESS WHAT'S HAPPENING.

RUN!

THOSE ARE SHOTS!

RUN!

DON'T WALK!

YELLING AT THEM THAT THEY'RE
UNDER ATTACK.

EVERYBODY
AS THE CROWDS RUN PAST HER.

LET'S GO!

TRUCK, PARKED NEARBY, DRIVING IT
BACK INTO THE KILL ZONE, TURNING
IT INTO A MAKESHIFT AMBULANCE.

RIGHT HERE, COME IN HERE.

IN, ONE AFTER ANOTHER.

GET IN THE TRUCK, GET IN THE
TRUCK.

DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WOUNDED
PEOPLE WE CAN TAKE?

NOT RIGHT NOW.

BEHIND THE WHEEL, DRIVES THEM
BACK DOWN THE STRIP TO
PARAMEDICS.

I GOT FIVE WOUNDED.

GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE CHEST HERE.

SOMEONE HELP, PLEASE, PLEASE.

I'M BLEEDING SO MUCH.

ABOVE, EVIDENCE OF A MASSACRE
STILL FROZEN IN TIME.

IT DOESN'T LOOK SO MUCH LIKE
THERE WAS A CONCERT THERE, BUT
AATTH
THOSE OVERTURNED LAWN CHAIRS,
WE'VE SEEN STROLLERS THERE,
WE'VE SEEN WALKERS THERE.

EVIDENCE OF JUST THE ABSOLUTE
CHAOS.

AND TONIGHT, WE ARE LEARNING
THAT STEPHEN PADDOCK MAY HAVE
SCOUTED OTHER TARGETS AS FAR
AWAY AS BOSTON AND CHICAGO.

ACCORDING TO SOURCES BRIEFED ON
THE INVESTIGATION, HE BOOKED
ROOMS AT CHICAGO'S BLACKSTONE
HOTEL IN AUGUST, THE SAME DATES
AS THE LOLLAPALOOZA FESTIVAL
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET IN GRANT
PARK.

ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE ATTENDED
EACH DAY.

BUT PADDOCK NEVER CHECKED IN.

LAW ENFORCEMENT SOCES ALSO
TELL US HIS PHONE SHOWS A GOOGLE
PARK" IN BOSTON.LS AROUND FENWAY
THAT BALLPARK'S CAPACITY?

NEARLY 38,000 PEOPLE.

BUT NO EVIDENCE HE TRAVELED TO
BOSTON, EITHER.

INSTEAD, HE STAYED CLOSE TO
HOME, HOLING UP IN ONE OF THE
CASINOS HE KNEW SO WELL, LOOKING
DOWN ON THAT HELPLESS CROWD.

SO, LET'S GET TO MATT GUTMAN
LIVE WITH US AGAIN TONIGHT.

AND MATT, NOW YOU'RE LEARNING,
THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE ELSE
AUTHORITIES WANT TO TALK TO?

INVESTIGATORS SAY THAT PADDOCK
WAS SEEN WITH A MYSTERY WOMAN IN
HIS LAST DAYS.

NOW, SHE WAS NOT HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY.

THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO
SHE IS AND WHAT SHE KNOWS.

ALSO, GIVEN THE ARSENAL THAT HE
AMASSED, ALONG WITH EXPLOSIVE
MATERIALS AND THE FACT THAT HE
MAY HAVE HAD AN ESCAPE PLAN,
THEY'RE NOW SAYING THAT THEY
CANNOT RULE OUT THAT HE HAD AN
ACCOMPLICE.

DAVID?

MATT GUTMAN LEADING US OFF.

MATT, THANK YOU.

THE OTHER MAJOR HEADLINE
INVOLVES THE GIRLFRIEND, NOW
QUESTIONED BY THE FBI BACK HERE
IN THE U.S.
WHAT MARILOU DANLEY SAYS WHEN
ASKED IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING.

AND TONIGHT, ABC NEWS OBTAINING
A CHECK.

WHAT THEY PAID CASH FOR IN THE
WEEKS BEFORE.

AND HOW THE SALESPERSON
DESCRIBED THE COUPLE.

HERE'S ABC'S CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN ROSS.

TONIGHT FROM AN UNLIKELY PLACE
ABOUT STEPHEN PADDOCK -- THE
RENO CAR DEALERSHIP WHERE HE
PAYING CASH, WITH A CHECK FOR
$14,411 -- NOT A SIGN OF SOMEONE
WITH FINANCIAL PROBLEMS.

EMPLOYEES HERE TODAY TOLD US THE
FBI QUESTIONED THEM ABOUT
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH
PADDOCK AND HIS GIRLFRIEND,
MARILOU DANLEY, WHEN THEY CAME
TO BUY THE CAR.

MARILOU EVEN WANTED TO GET A
LEXUS, BUT HE WAS LIKE, I'M NOT
GOING TO SPEND $10,000 MORE FOR
A CAR THAT'S GOT THE EXACT SAM
WENT ON A TEST DRIVE, SHE TOLD
THE FEMALE SALESPERSON THAT
PADDOCK HAD SAHED VEOMFRR  A
TROUBLED MARRIAGE.

SHE SAID SHE HAD A BAD
RELATIONSHIP PRIOR TO HIM.

AND HOW HE HAD, YOU KNOW, TURNED
RELATIONSHIP WITH PADDOCK HAS
NOW BECOME A KEY FOCUS OF THE
INVESTIGATION.

AGENTS PADDOCK WAS A CARING MAN
WHO SHOWED NO SIGN OF VIOLENCE.

AND THE FBI ALSO WANTED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE MORE THAN $100,000
THAT PADDOCK WIRED TO THE
PHILIPPINES FOR DANLEY, BEFORE
SENDING HER THERE JUST TWO WEEKS
IN ADVANCE OF THE SHOOTING.

HER LAWYER READ HER STATEMENT.

I WAS GRATEFUL, BUT HONESTLY,
I WAS WORRIED THAT FIRST, THE
UNEXPECTED TRIP HOME AND THEN
THE MONEY WAS A WAY OF BREAKING
INVESTIGATION, THE FBI SAYS IT
HAS RULED OUT MONEY PROBLEMS AND
RULED OUT ANY CONNECTION TO
ANARCHIST GROUPS, TO
ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUPS, TO
OVERSEAS TERROR GROUPS.

AND BRIAN ROSS WITH US LIVE
TONIGHT.

FOUR DAYS LATER, STILL NO
MOTIVE.

BUT AS YOU BEGAN TO POINT OUT
RIGHT THERE, YOU HAVE LEARNED
WHAT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO RULE
THEY'RE STILL STUMPED, BUT
THEY'RE CERTAIN THEY WILL FIND
OUT A MOTIVE, SOONER OR LATER.

DRILLING DOWN FURTHER NOW ON HIS
FINANCES, HIS COMPUTER AND HIS
MENTAL HEALTH, DAVID.

ONE THING, BRIAN, SO MANY
PEOPLE ARE ASKING ABOUT IS THIS
BELIEF HE DIDN'T SNAP IN THE
MOMENT, BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY
SIGNS NOW HE HAD BEEN PREPARING
THIS FOR SOME TIME.

THIS WAS A WELL-PLANNED ATTACK.

NEARLY TWO DOZEN WEAPONS IN HIS
HOTEL SUITE, HALF OF THEM
CONVERTED TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC,
AS WELL AS THOSE CAMERAS,
INCLUDING THE ONE IN THAT ROOM
SERVICE CART OUTSIDE HIS ROOM,
PLACED TO GIVE HIM EARLY WARNING
ABOUT ANYONE COMING TO STOP HIM,
DAVID.

STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THAT MOTIVE.

BRIAN ROSS TONIGHT, THANK YOU.

AFTER THE MASSACRE TOOK 58
LIVES, COULD THERE BE BIPARTISAN
MOVEMENT NOW ON THIS IN
WASHINGTON?

THE GROWING CALL TONIGHT TO BAN
OR REGULATE THOSE SO-CALLED BUMP
STOCKS.

THE DEVICE USED BY THE GUNMAN,
ATTACHING IT TO SOME OF HIS
WEAPONS, TURNING SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS TO FIRE LIKE AN
AUTOMATIC.

DEMOCRATS, SOME REPUBLICANS AND
A SIGNAL TODAY FROM THE NRA ON
THIS?

HERE'S ABC'S SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA.

MOST POWERFUL GUN LOBBY, TODAY,
A CALL FOR CHANGE IN THE WAKE OF
THE NATION'S DEADLIEST MASS
SHOOTING.

FOUND ON A DOZEN OF THE LAS
VEGAS SHOOTER'S WEAPONS, THOSE
BUMP STOCK ATTACHMENTS THAT
ALLOW A RIFLE TO FIRE LIKE A
MACHINE GUN.

THE NRA NOW SAYS, "DEVICES
DESIGNED TO ALLOW SEMIAUTOMATIC
RIFLES TO FUNCTION LIKE FULLY
AUTOMATIC RIFLES SHOULD BE
SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL
REGULATIONS."

AND TONIGHT, A GROWING NUMBER OF
TOP REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WOULD
CONSIDER LEGISLATION BANNING
BUMP STOCKS ALTOGETHER.

IF THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO
A FIREARM THAT BREACHES THE
SPIRIT OF THE LAW AGAINST
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, THEN I THINK
THERE WOULD BE BIPARTISAN
SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH IT.

CLEARLY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE
NEED TO LOOK INTO.

REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN EVEN
VOWING TO INTRODUCE HIS OWN
BILL.

WITH A BUMP STOCK, ASSAULT
RIFLES CAN FIRE HUNDREDS OF
ROUNDS PER MINUTE, CHANGING A
GUN FROM THIS TO THIS.

BUT NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ARE
ONBOARD WITH TOUGHER LAWS.

I DON'T THINK THE 80 OR
90 MILLION AMERICANS WHO
EXERCISE THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHTS TO OWN A GUN SHOULD BE
PUNISHED FOR THE ACT OF ONE EVIL
PERSON.

FAR SILENT ON GUN CONTROL IN THE
WAKE OF THE LAS VEGAS MASSACRE,
BUT LATE TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP
SIGNALED HE'LL BE WEIGHING IN ON
THE BUMP STOCK DEBATE, TOO.

WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THAT
OV TER
TIME.

ALL RIGHT, CECILIA VEGA LIVE
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.

THE PRESIDENT THERE SAYING HE
WILL LOOK INTO WHAT CAN BE DONE
ON THESE BUMP STOCKS.

IN THE MEANTIME, CECILIA, I WANT
TO ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER REPORT
BREAKING TONIGHT INVOLVING THE
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.

REPORTS IN POLITICO THAT JOHN
KELLY'S PHONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
COMPROMISED?

REPORT SAYS THAT GENERAL KELLY'S
PERSONAL CELL PHONE WAS
COMPROMISED.

NO INDICATION OF HOW OF BY WHOM
OR EVEN WHETHER ANY DATA MAY
HAVE BEEN ACCESSED.

THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT TELLS US
THAT THE GENERAL'S PHONE STOPPED
WORKING IN DECEMBER, SO, HE
STOPPED USING IT THEN.

THIS IS BEFORE HE EVEN JOINED
THIS ADMINISTRATION, BUT DAVID,
DEFINITELY RAISING QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHETHER ANY SENSITIVE INFO
MAY HAVE BEEN ACCESSED.

ALL RIGHT, CECILIA VEGA WITH
US AGAIN TONIGHT.

CECILIA, THANKS, AS ALWAYS.

AND WE SHOULD MENTION, BACK
ON THE LAS VEGAS MASSACRE, THAT
ABC NEWS AND "20/20" WILL AIR A
SPECIAL DOCUMENTARY PRESENTATION
TOMORROW NIGHT, WITH NEW FIRST
ON THE
HEROISM AMID THE TRAGEDY.

"WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS" AIRS
TOMORROW AT 1000 P.M. EASTERN.

I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

WE HOPE YOU WATCH, OR SET YOUR
DVR.

THAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT.

IN THE MEANTIME, OVERSEAS
TONIGHT, AND THE DEADLY AMBUSH
TARGETING AMERICAN TROOPS IN
THE PENTAGON CONFIRMING THREE
ARMY GREEN BERETS KILLED AND TWO
WOUNDED DURING AN ATTACK BY
ABOUT 50 EXTREMISTS NEAR THE
MALI BORDER.

THEY WERE ON A JOINT PATROL AT
THE TIME.

THE AMERICANS PART OF A TEAM
ASSISTING A COUNTER-TERRORISM
OPERATION THERE.

BACK HERE AT HOME TONIGHT,
AND LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA
DECLARING STATES OF EMERGENCY
TONIGHT.

PREPARING FOR A POSSIBLE
HURRICANE, HEADED STRAIGHT FOR
THE U.S.

THE MASSIVE TROPICAL STORM,
NATE, ALREADY BLAMED FOR MORE
THAN A DOZEN DEATHS IN NICARAGUA
AND COSTA RICA.

AS IT MAKES ITS WAY TOWARD THE
GULF TONIGHT, THE PATHS TAKE IT
RIGHT UP THROUGH THE COUNTRY,
RIGHT INTO THE NORTHEAST.

SO, LET'S GET RIGHT TO ROB,
BECAUSE HURRICANE SEASON IS NOT
UNLIKE THE OTHER STORMS, THIS
ONE IS GOING TO BE MOVING
QUICKLY.

RIGHT NOW, IT'S OVER LAND.

OVER HONDURAS, AND ONCE IT GETS
INTO THE CARIBBEAN LATER ON
TONIGHT, LOOK OUT.

THE WATERS THERE, VERY WARM.

WE'VE GOT HURRICANE WATCHES NOW
THAT ARE POSTED FOR CANCUN, SO,
IT GOES ACROSS THE YUCATAN
TOMORROW NIGHT.

THEN INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO,
INTENSIFYING AS IT DOES.

SO, HOW STRONG?

WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE, BECAUSE IT
WILL BE MOVING SO QUICKLY, BUT
AT LEAST A CATEGORY 1, INTO AND
AROUND NEW ORLEANS AND THE
CENTRAL GULF COAST EARLY SUNDAY
MORNING.

THERE ARE THE TRACKS, MORE
CONFIDENCE THERE.

LOOK AT THE WARM WATERS, DAVID.

ALL RIGHT, ON THE WATCH IN
THE GULF TONIGHT.

ROB, THANK YOU.

NEXT THIS EVENING, THE
BREAKING HEADLINE INVOLVING A
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND HIS
SEX SCANDAL.

TIM MURPHY OF PENNSYLVANIA, A
HUSBAND AND FATHER, GIVING HIS
TWO WEEKS NOTICE TODAY.

HERE'S ABC'S DAVID WRIGHT.

PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICAN CAUGHT
IN A SEX SCANDAL.

CONGRESSMAN TIM MURPHY
EFFECTIVELY GAVE TWO WEEKS
NOTICE.

HE'S OUT OF CONGRESS, EFFECTIVE
 I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT
HE MOVES ONTO THE NEXT CHAPTER
OF HIS LIFE.

IS KNOWN FOR HIS ANTI-ABORTION
VIEWS.

I DON'T KNOW IF WOMEN WHO GO
IN FOR AN ABORTION REALLY KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS.

PITTSBURGH POST GAZETTE"
PUBLISHED TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN
HIM AND HIS FORMER MISTRESS,
MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WHILE HE'S
AGAINST ABORTION, HE WANTED HER
TO HAVE ONE.

IN JANUARY, SHE TOOK HIM TO TASK
FOR "POSTING YOUR PRO-LIFE
STANCE ALL OVER THE PLACE WHEN
YOU HAD NO ISSUE ASKING ME TO
ABORT OUR UNBORN CHILD JUST LAST
WEEK."

HE TEXTED BACK, EXPRESSING
REMORSE.

TURNS OUT, IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

BUT THE AFFAIR BECAME PUBLIC AS
A RESULT OF HER DIVORCE
PROCEEDINGS, MUCH TO THE
CONGRESSMAN'S EMBARRASSMENT.

THE CONGRESSMAN IS MARRIED, TOO.

HE SAYS HE'LL TAKE SOME PERSONAL
TIME TO GET HELP, AS HE AND HIS
FAMILY SORT OUT THEIR
DIFFICULTIES.

DAVID?

DAVID, THANK YOU.

AND ONE MORE HEADLINE OUT OF
WASHINGTON TONIGHT.

ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS
TODAY REVERSING AN OBAMA-ERA
POLICY, SAYING FEDERAL CIVIL
RIGHTS LAWS DO NOT PROTECT
TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM
DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE.

SESSIONS SUGGESTING
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEX DOES
NOT INCLUDE ISSUES OF GENDER
IDENTITY.

WE TURN TONIGHT TO FOOTBALL
STAR IGNITING A NEW OUTRAGE THIS
EVENING.

CAROLINA PANTHERS QUARTERBACK
CAM NEWTON UNDER FIRE, ACCUSED
OF MAKING SEXIST REMARKS TO A
FEMALE REPORTER.

AT LEAST ONE SPONSOR ALREADY
CUTTING TIES.

AND HERE'S ABC'S PAULA FARIS
NOW.

NEWTON HAS BEEN SWIFT.

NEW DANNON OIKOS IS MY GO-TWO
PROTEIN SNACK.

OF NEWTON'S ADS.

AND GATORADE CALLING HIS
COMMENTS "DISRESPECTFUL TO ALL
WOMEN."

IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THIS
EXCHANGE WITH A FEMALE REPORTER.

DEVIN FUNCHESS SEEMS TO
REALLY EMBRACE THE PHYSICALITY
OF HIS ROUTES.

IT'S FUNNY TO HEAR A FEMALE
TALK ABOUT ROUTES.

LIKE -- IT'S FUNNY.

25-YEAR-OLD JOURDAN RODRIGUE,
SHOT BACK ON TWITTER.

"I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY TO BE
A FEMALE AND TALK ABOUT ROUTES.

I THINK IT'S MY JOB."

BUT RODRIGUE ALSO IN HOT WATER,
APOLOGIZING FOR YEARS OLD
OFFENSIVE TWEETS THAT SURFACED
THIS WEEK.

RODRIGUE WAS BACK AT PANTHERS
PRACTICE TODAY, BUT NOT
COMMENTING.

THE TEAM, QUIET, AS WELL.

BUT THE NFL, WITH NEARLY HALF
ITS FANBASE NOW CONSISTING OF
WOMEN, SAYING "THE COMMENTS ARE
JUST PLAIN WRONG AND
DISRESPECTFUL."

IF YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING
THAT HAS ADDED UP, THE DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE ISSUES, THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM CONTROVERSY, THEY'RE
HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH
RATINGS.

BIG CONCERN FOR THE NFL.

THIS IS WHERE THE LEAGUE MAKES
ITS MONEY.

AND SO FAR THIS SEASON, RATINGS
ARE DOWN 9%.

DAVID?

PAULA, THANK YOU.
