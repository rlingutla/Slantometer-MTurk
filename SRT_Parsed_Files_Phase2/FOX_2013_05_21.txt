I'M SHEPARD SMITH THE DAY
AFTER THE STORM IN THE
MIDDLE OF NEIGHBORHOOD
KINGS MANOR AND TELEPHONE
ROAD PICKING UP THE PIECES
SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS.

TEAM FOX COVERAGE BEGINS
NOW.

MOORE, OKLAHOMA, A SUBURB
OF OKLAHOMA CITY AND
COMMUNITY IN AMERICA'S
HEARTLAND THAT IS RIGHT NOW
DEALING WITH A DISASTER ON
UNMANAGEABLE SCALE.

TONIGHT SEARCH CREWS AND
SEARCH LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
BURIED ALIVE ONE DAY AFTER
THE TORNADO SCRAPED THE
LANDSCAPE RAW.

THREE HOURS AGO THE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
CONFIRMED WHAT MANY OF US
SUSPECTED THE TORNADO THAT
HIT THIS CITY AND THIS AREA
WAS AN EF-56789 THE TOP
LEVEL POSSIBLE.

THAT MEANS IT CARRIED WINDS
IN EXCESS OF 200 MILES PER
HOUR.

AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT THOSE
WINDS DID.

BLOCK AFTER BLOCK AFTER
BLOCK.

HOMES HERE GONE, SHREDDED,
CRUSHED WALLS AND
FURNITURE.

PHOTOGRAPHS.

ALL THE ORDINARY EFFECTS OF
EVERY DAY LIFE TURN TO
PIECES AND SCATTERED IN THE
WIND AFTER A COLUMN OF
DESTRUCTION DROPPED FROM
THE SKY AND CHEWED A
17-MILE PATH ACROSS THIS
CITY AND REGION.

THE FIRE CHIEF HERE SAYS HE
IS 98% SURE THAT TEAMS FROM
ALREADY FOUND ALL THE
SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS.

HE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO
HIT THE STREETS SEARCH THE
ENTIRE COMMUNITY AT LEAST
TWICE MORE, JUST TO BE
SURE.

AND OKLAHOMA'S GOVERNOR
SAYING TODAY SHE STILL
DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY
PEOPLE ARE LISTED AS
MISSING.

WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE
PEOPLE AND BODIES THAT HAVE
BEEN TAKEN TO THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER'S OFFICE, BUT WE
HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT THERE
MAY BE BODIES THAT HAVE
BEEN TAKEN TO LOCAL FUNERAL
HOMES.

AND SO, WE ARE WORKING REAL
HARD RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO
GET A MORE ACCURATE COUNT
OF THE LOSS OF LIFE AND WE
HOPE TO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS
ON THAT.

MEDICAL EXAMINER SAYS AT
LEAST 24 PEOPLE ARE
CONFIRMED DEAD.

NINE OF THOSE CHILDREN.

HOSPITAL WORKERS ALSO SAY
THEY HAVE TREATED MORE THAN
200 PEOPLE SO FAR.

MORE THAN 70 THEM KIDS.

RIGHT NOW I AM STANDING
NEAR WHAT USED TO BE A
BOWLING ALLEY RIGHT BEHIND
ME.

ABOUT A HALF MILE EAST OF
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.

BEFORE AND AFTER IMAGES
SHOW DESTRUCTION AT THAT
SCHOOL WHERE SEVEN CHILDREN
DIED.

AND WHERE RESCUERS FOUND
OTHERS STILL ALIVE.

WE HAVE AN IMAGE OF ONE
CHILD WHO PHOTOGRAPHER SAYS
WAS CALLING OUT FOR HIS
FATHER AS MEN PULLED HIM
FROM THE SHATTERED CONCRETE
OF THAT SCHOOL.

AND WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM
A GRANDFATHER WHOSE
DAUGHTER AND CHILDREN AS
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY.

SHE WENT TO GET THEM BEFORE
THE TORNADO HIT.

MAYBE SAVE THEIR LIVES.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT I
WOULD HAVE DONE IF I HAD
LOST MY GRAND KIDS.

SO I'M PROUD OF HER FOR
BEING SMART.

SHE DID THE RIGHT THING.

SURVIVED THIS TORNADO ARE
DESCRIBING WHAT IT WAS LIKE
WHEN IT HIT.

WHEN THE WIND STARTED
BLASTING IN THEIR
DIRECTION.

[SIREN]
 A LOT OF RUMBLING.

THE THING THAT GOT ME IS
WHEN THINGS STARTED HITTING
THE HOUSE HARD ENOUGH TO
SHAKE THE HOUSE.

WE WENT UNDER A BRIDGE
AND TOOK COVER UNDER THE
BRIDGE.

WE HEARD THE STORM.

IT WENT RIGHT OVER US AND
FELT THE DEBRIS.

HE GOT HIT WITH SOME ROCKS
AND STUFF.

BUT, IT WAS SCARIEST THING
THAT I HAVE EVER WENT
THROUGH.

IT LOOKED LIKE A WAR
ZONE.

IT JUST LOOKED LIKE BOMBS
HAD BEEN IGNITED
EVERYWHERE.

IT WAS -- THERE IS A CAR
PART IN MY BEDROOM YOU
KNOW.

EVERYTHING IS GONE, YOU
KNOW.

JUST IN A MATTER OF 30
MINUTES YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS
TORN UPSIDE DOWN.

IN THAT SAME SITUATION.

SOME AS FOX REPORTS TONIGHT
WITH NOTHING LEFT.

SHEAR IS A PHOTO OF ONE
FAMILY'S HOME BEFORE THE
TORNADO AND THEN AFTER IT.

THAT'S MARY BARNHILL
SITTING NEXT TO HER
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW BRENDA.

THEY ARE IN FRONT OF
BRENDA'S HOUSE OR WHAT
REMAINS OF IT.

TODAY, AMERICANS ACROSS
THIS COUNTRY ARE TRYING TO
HELP PEOPLE LIKE BRENDA AND
HER NEIGHBORS.

TEXAS SENDING AN ELITE
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAM
ABOUT 70 FIRST RESPONDERS
WHO SPECIALIZE IN GETTING
PEOPLE OUT FROM UNDER
WRECKAGE.

FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW
MEXICO A 26 MEMBER TEAM
INCLUDING DOCTORS AND
NURSES AND FROM JOPLIN,
MISSOURI POLICE AND
FIREFIGHTERS HEADED TO THE
SCENE.

PAY BACK AS THEY PUT IT FOR
THE HELP THAT COMMUNITY
RECEIVED AFTER ITS OWN
DEVASTATING TORNADO IN
2011.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP
THOSE WHO HAVE LOST SO MUCH
IN OKLAHOMA, THE RED CROSS
IS ACCEPTING DONATIONS.

CAN YOU VISIT RED CROSS.ORG
OR CALL 1-800-RED CROSS.

THIS MORNING PRESIDENT
OBAMA SPOKE FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE.

HE TOLD ALL THOSE AFFECTED
THAT THEIR COUNTRY WILL BE
THERE TO HELP TODAY AND
FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

THERE ARE HOMES AND
SCHOOLS TO REBUILD
BUSINESSES AND HOSPITALS TO
REOPEN THERE ARE PARENTS TO
CONSOLE.

FIRST RESPONDERS TO COMFORT
AND OF COURSE FRIGHTENED
CHILDREN WHO WILL NEED OUR
CONTINUED LOVE AND
ATTENTION.

THERE ARE EMPTY SPACES
WHERE THERE USED TO IT BE
LIVING ROOMS AND BEDROOMS
AND CLASSROOMS.

EMPTINESS HERE IN MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

AND A LOT OF WORK YET TO BE
DONE, OF COURSE.

BUT THIS COMMUNITY HAS
FACED SITUATIONS LIKE THIS
IN THE PAST.

AFTER THE TORNADO THAT
DEVASTATED THIS AREA AN MAY
THE 3RD 1999.

SO TONIGHT, EVEN AS PEOPLE
OF MOORE TAKE STOCK OF ALL
THEY HAVE LOST, AS FAMILIES
MOURN THEIR DEAD AND
COMFORT THE LIVING, WE KNOW
THAT THEY WILL RECOVER.

AND THEY WILL REBUILD.

"THE FOX REPORT'S"
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HUNT
IS HERE WITH US IN MOORE
THIS EVENING.

SOME INSPIRATION OUT THERE
AMID ALL THE LOSS.

AMAZING STORIES OF LOSS,
SHEP.

AMAZING STORIES OF
SURVIVAL.

AND STORIES OF PARENTS
HAVING TO MAKE UNIMAGINABLE
CHOICES.

TODAY, WE CAME ACROSS TRACY
STEPHAN IN HER BACKYARD,
WHAT USED TO BE HER
BACKYARD SIFTING THROUGH
THE WRECKAGE OF HER HOME.

YESTERDAY, SHE WAS AT HOME
WHEN SHE HEARD THE TORNADO
WARNINGS.

SHE LEFT HER2 YOUNGEST
CHILDREN THERE WITH A
FRIEND AND RUSHED TO THE
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL TO TRY TO FIND HER
ELDEST DAUGHTER.

SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED INTO
THAT SCHOOL.

THE DOORS WERE ALREADY
LOCKED.

SHE THEN HAD TO CHOOSE
WHETHER TO STAY THERE
CLOSE TO HER ELDEST
DAUGHTER OR RUSH HOME TO
HER TWO YOUNGEST CHILDREN.

LISTEN.

HONESTLY I FELT LIKE I HAD
TO PICK AND CHOOSE STAYING
AT THE SCHOOL WITH ONE
CHILD OR COMING BACK HOME
TO MY TWO OTHER CHILDREN.

IT'S A TOUGH DECISION I
DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH
AGAIN.

TRACY CHOSE TO COME HOME
TO HER TWO YOUNGEST
CHILDREN.

SHE HID WITH THEM IN THE
CELLAR.

THEN, WHEN THE TORNADO HAD
PASSED SHE RUSHED BACK TO
THE SCHOOL, DESPERATELY
TRYING TO FIND HER ELDEST
DAUGHTER.

LISTEN AGAIN.

WERE SAVED HER LIFE.

SHE HOVERED OVER HER DURING
THE WHOLE TIME, SUCH
SELFLESS ACT.

SHE ENDED UP NEEDING TO
SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION
BECAUSE SHE HAD CUTS AND
SCRAPSZ AND WAS BLEEDING.

SAVED MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.

YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT
MOMENT WHEN YOU FIRST SAW
YOUR DAUGHTER; THE HAPPIEST
DAY OF MY LIFE.

IT WAS AMAZING.

BEING ABLE TO SEE HER AND
SHE IS OKAY.

AND SHE WAS EXCITED THAT
THERE WAS NO MORE SCHOOL.

TRACY'S DAUGHTER EXCITED
THAT THERE WAS NO MORE
SCHOOL AND TRACY'S
DAUGHTER SAVED BY THE
ACTION SHEP, OF THAT
HEROIC TEACHER'S AIDE WHO
JUST COVERED HER UP AND
SAVED HER FROM ALMOST
CERTAIN DEATH.

AMAZING STORIES COMING
FROM SO MANY PLACES.

JONATHAN THANKS VERY MUCH.

FOR A WHILE, MOST OF THE
IMAGES WE GOT WERE FROM
ABOVE.

THIS AFTERNOON THE WEATHER
WAS SO BAD HERE IN MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

THEY WERE NOT TORNADO
WARNINGS BUT SEVERE
WARNINGS.

WARNINGS OF LARGE SIZE
HAIL.

THANKFULLY THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.

THE RAINS CAME AND ALL THE
CHOPPERS CAME OUT OF AIR.

OUR FRIENDS AT WTOV AND
KOTV HAVE PUT THEIR CHOPPER
BACK UP IN THE AIR AND
WE'RE ABLE TO GET LIVE
PICTURES NOW.

WE ARE SHOWING YOU THE
DESTRUCTION AROUND THIS
AREA AS WE SPEAK.

OF COURSE, THERE ARE LOTS
OF WAYS TO HELP THE PEOPLE
HERE IN OKLAHOMA AND ACROSS
THE REGION.

WE HAVE A COUPLE PERFORM
OPTIONS.

CAN YOU DONATED TO THE RED
CROSS IF YOU LIKE OR THE
SALVATION ARMY, OF COURSE,
ONLINE OR BY PHONE.

WE HAVE MOORE INFORMATION
AT OUR WEB SITE.

IT'S VERY EASY.

JUST GO TO FOXNEWS.COM/SHEM
AND IT'S ALL THERE FOR YOU.

AFTER YESTERDAY'S TORNADO,
A PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK A
PICTURE NEAR THE PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
AND TODAY IT APPEARS ON THE
COVERS OF NEWSPAPERS FROM
CALIFORNIA TO FLORIDA AND
BEYOND.

A WOMAN CARRYING A CHILD
THROUGH A FIELD.

WE DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES
OR WHAT'S BECOME OF THEM,
FRANKLY, BUT WE'LL HAVE
MORE ON THE SCENE AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY COMING UP
INSIDE FOX REPORT.

WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM SOME
OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
TAKING PART IN THE MASSIVE
SEARCH AND RESCUE
OPERATION.

A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST
VERY SAD.

I MEAN, AS CAN YOU IMAGINE
HAVING TO PULL ANYBODY
WHETHER IT BE CHILDREN OR
ADULTS IS JUST GOING TO BE
OVERWHELMING FOR A PERSON.

SO YOU KNOW, AT THIS
POINT, WHEN IT WENT FROM A
CERTAIN AND RESCUE TO
SEARCH AND RECOVERY.

THE MOOD OVER THERE HAS
DEFINITELY CHANGED.

THAT AND CONTINUING
COVERAGE OF THE DISASTER IN
THE HEARTLAND.

COMING UP FROM THE
JOURNALISTS OF FOX NEWS ON
THIS TUESDAY FOX REPORT,
LIVE FROM MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

OKLAHOMA STRONG.

WELCOME
GREAT THINGS HAPPEN.

YOU SEE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE SCREEN FROM KOTV --
LET'S SEE FROM KWTV AND
KOTV OUR NEWS AFFILIATES
WHO HAVE THEIR DHOPPERS UP
LIVE TONIGHT.

WE WILL BE SHOWING YOU THE
DEVASTATION AND CLEANUP AS
THE NEWSCAST CONTINUES.

TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FROM
RELATIVES OF CHILDREN WHO
SURVIVED THE TORNADO'S
DIRECT HIT ON THAT SCHOOL
PLAZA ELEMENTARY AS I
REPORTED AT THE TOP OF THIS
NEWSCAST OFFICIALS TELL US
AT LEAST SEVEN CHILDREN
DIED IN THAT SCHOOL.

BUT RESCUE WORKERS DID
MANAGE TO PULL SOME OF THE
KIDS OUT OF THE RUBBLE
FORMING A HUMAN CHAIN TO
PASS THEM TO SAFETY.

TODAY ON "STUDIO B" I SPOKE
WITH A MAN WHOSE 6-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER MADE IT OUT OF
THAT SCHOOL ALIVE.

SHE WAS A LITTLE FREAKED
OUT O.

SHE SAID THAT THE SCHOOL
FELL DOWN.

AND SHE GOT A COUPLE
SCRAPES AND SCRATCHES.

NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
WHY IT HAPPENED TO US.

BUT SHE IS HAPPY THAT WE
ARE ALL FINE AND HER DOG IS
FINE.

SO SHE IS ACTUALLY QUITE
HAPPY ABOUT IT THAT WE ARE
ALL OKAY.

OKAY.

THIS IS WHAT IS LEFT OF
THEIR HOUSE.

JUSTIN TOLD ME HE WAS AT
WORK WHEN THE TORNADO HIT.

HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
RODE OUT OTHE STORM IN A
NEIGHBOR'S BASEMENT.

HE ALSO TOLD ME HE IS NOT
WEARING A JACKET TODAY
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T FIND
HIS CLOSET.

HE HAS SINCE GONE TO
SHELTERS AND GOTTEN A NEW
ONE BUT JOHN ROBERTS IS AT
PLAZA TOWERS ELEMENTARY
TONIGHT OR WAS EARLIER
TODAY AND IS HE LIVE HERE
IN MOORE TONIGHT.

JOHN WHAT'S THE LATEST ON
THAT SCHOOL.

DO WE KNOW?

THERE IS A SMALL PIECE
OF GOOD NEWS, SHEP.

IF THERE IS ANY GOOD NEWS
IN THIS DISASTER.

IS THE FACT THAT FOR ABOUT
17 OR 18 HOURS IT WAS
BELIEVED AS MANY AS TWO
DOZEN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN
TRAPPED IN PARISH IN
ADDITION TO THE SEVEN YOU
MENTIONED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
IT APPEARS NOW THAT WAS
SIMPLY THE FOG OF CONFUSION
FOLLOWING THE INITIAL
STRIKE OF THE TORNADO.

RESCUE WORKERS WENT THROUGH
A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A
NUMBER OF TIMES TODAY AND
DID NOT FIND ANY MORE
VICTIMS.

THE DEATH TOLL HOLDING
STEADY NOW AT 24.

IT STILL COULD RISE BUT AT
LEAST WE BELIEVE NOW 24
ADDITIONAL CHILDREN DID NOT
DIE.

WE'RE ALSO LEARNING A
LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED INSIDE THAT SCHOOL
IN BRIAR WOOD ELEMENTARY
FROM AN A.P.

STORY THAT
CAME OUT JUST A LITTLE
WHILE AGO.

AS THE STORM WARNINGS WENT
OUT, THOSE TORNADO WARNINGS
ALL THE CHILDREN WERE TAKEN
OUT OF THEIR CLASSROOMS AT
PLAZA TOWER SENT TO THE
CALF FEAR I CAN'T TO WAIT
FOR THEIR PARENTS TO PICK
THEM UP.

BUT WHEN THE TORNADO SIRENS
WENT OFF SCHOOL OFFICIALS
SCRAMBLED TO GET THEM ALL
INTO THE HALLWAY AN AREA
THEY THOUGHT WOULD BE A
SAFE PLACE.

BUT ONE TEACHER AT PLAZA
TOWERS SAID THIS HALLWAY IS
NOT SAFE.

SHE GRABBED A BUNCH OF KIDS
AND TOOK THEM INTO THE
BATHROOM.

WHEN THE T. HIT THE
CHILDREN SURVIVED.

SIMILAR TORE THE CHILDREN
TOOK THEM INTO THE HALLWAY
IT'S NOT SAFE.

TOOK THEM A FEW OF THEM AND
WENT INTO THE CLOSET.

THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY NONE OF THE CHILDREN AT
BRIAR WOOD PERISHED.

WE SHOULD POINT OUT SHEP,
NEITHER BRIAR WOOD NOR
PLAZA TOWERS HAD ANY KIND
OF SAFE ROOM OR HARDENED
TORNADO SHELTER.

THE STUDENTS SIMPLY HAD THE
STRUCTURE TO PROTECT THEM.

WE SAW HOW WELL THAT DID
DURING THIS TORNADO.

OF THAT JOHN, IT'S MY
UNDERSTANDING YOU MET A MAN
WHOSE DAUGHTER REALLY
DIDN'T TRUST THAT THE
SCHOOLS COULD BE SAFE IN
THE STORM.

FELLOW WHO LIVES JUST
ACROSS THE STREET, HIS NAME
IS JIM GARNER.

HE SAID THAT YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON HIS DAUGHTER, WHO
HAS FOUR KIDS AT PLAZA
TOWERS ELEMENTARY GOT A
HINKY FEELING ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

HE PICKS UP THE TIME LINE
FROM THERE.

SHE KNEW THIS WAS COMING.

SHE HAD A BAD FEELING.

SO SHE WENT TO THE SCHOOL
AND PICKED MY GRAND KIDS UP
FROM SCHOOL.

WHAT TIME WAS THAT AT.

AROUND 200.

259?

YES SIR.

SHE MADE A GOOD DECISION.

SHE WENT AND GOT THEM OUT
OF SCHOOL AND BROUGHT THEM
HOME.

BROUGHT THEM HOME AND
TOOK THEM IMMEDIATELY TO
THE UNDERGROUND TORNADO
SHELTER RIGHT BEHIND THEIR
HOUSE.

SHE ADDED SIX MORE
CHILDREN.

JIM GARNER, HIS DAUGHTER
AND 10 CHILDREN RODE OUT
THIS TORNADO IN UNDERGROUND
STORM SHELTER SHEP.

THEY ALL ESCAPED UNSCATHED.

THOUGH JIM TOLD ME HE HAD
TO HOLD ON TO THAT DOOR
BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE THE
TORNADO WAS TRYING TO SUCK
IT OPEN AND SUCK THEM OUT.

SHEP?

WITH US TONIGHT IN
OKLAHOMA.

LAWMAKERS FROM THIS AREA
SAY HELP IS REALLY ALREADY
POURING IN FROM ACROSS THE
COUNTRY AND FOR THAT MATTER
AROUND THE WORLD.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS IS HE
TAKING STEPS TO SPEED
DISASTER RELIEF FROM
WASHINGTON.

HE WHITE HOUSE.

BUT, FIRST SHEAR LOOK AT
SOME OF WHAT I SAW EARLIER
TODAY JUST AFTER WE LANDED
IN MOORE OKLAHOMA.

24 HOURS LATER AND YOU
COULD TAKE THIS CAMERA TO
ANY PLACE WITHIN MILES AWAY
AND FIND SOMETHING EXACTLY
LIKE THIS.

SEE THE SIDE OF THIS HOUSE
HERE?

COVERED IN MUD.

THE TORNADO THREW IT UP
AGAINST THE HOUSE.

BEAMS COMING DOWN, METAL IN
THE TREES.

ALL ALONG HERE, DEBRIS FROM
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE.

THESE ARE EITHER POWER
LINES AND SOMEBODY'S GAS
CAN.

AND OVER HERE YOU CAN SEE
THE REST THAT WAS DONE BY
THE STORM.

THAT'S A TREE THERE IN THE
THE CENTER THAT WAS A TREE.

AND NOW ROOF AFTER ROOF IS
GONE.

PEOPLE HAVE COME IN TO TRY
TO GET SOME OF THEIR THINGS
TODAY.

AND THIS IS RIGHT ON THE
CORNER NEAR THE BIG MEDICAL
CENTER THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT
YESTERDAY.

STAY RIGHT THERE SCOTT, SO
YOU YOU CAN SEE IT BACK
BEHIND YOU.

THIS IS THE MEDICAL CENTER
OVER HERE.

IT JUST WIPED OUT.

YOU CAN SEE THIS WAS THE
MAIN ENTRANCE.

THE WOMAN CENTER AND BACK
BEHIND JUST WHAT'S LEFT OF
THIS FACILITY.

AND AS SCOTT WALKS OVER TO
HIS LEFT, YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO SEE IN THE DISTANCE
THERE CAR AFTER CAR SCOTT
PAN TO THE RIGHT AND IT IS
AS IF THE TORNADO JUST
PICKED ALL OF THESE CARS UP
AND JUST PUSHED THEM INTO
THIS BUILDING.

YOU SEE THE X'S ON THE SIDE
OF THESE VEHICLES, RIGHT?

AN X MEANS THAT THEY HAVE
SEARCHED THE VEHICLE AND
THERE IS NOBODY INSIDE.

BY THE THOUSANDS PART-TIME
HAVE COME HERE.

TO TRY TO VOOL TIER.

AND OVER HERE, AN AMERICAN
FLAG IS UP.

IT'S OKLAHOMA.

IT'S THE HEARTLAND OF
AMERICA.

THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS
BEFORE.

A DEVASTATING STORM IN
1999.

THE DEVASTATING ALFRED T.
MURROW FEDERAL BUILDING
BOMBING.

ANOTHER HORRIBLE STORM IN
2003.

AND NOW THEY ARE AT IT
AGAIN.

AND EACH TIME THEY HAVE
BEEN AN INSPIRATION TO THE
NATION.

AS THEY COME IN WITH A
SHOPPING CART WITH WHAT
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
SALVAGE FROM THEIR HOME, A
REMINDER OF EACH SINGLE
INDIVIDUAL'S STRUGGLE AND
THE STRUGGLE THAT WILL GO
ON FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS TO
COME.

OKLAHOMA NEEDS YOUR PRAYERS
AND YOUR HELP.

IS PRAISING THE HEROS HERE
IN THE HEARTLAND AND
PROMISING THAT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT WILL DO
EVERYTHING IT CAN TO HELP.

HE SAYS HE HAS ALREADY
SIGNED A DISASTER
DECLARATION TO GET THINGS
MOVING RIGHT AWAY.

OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH THE
PEOPLE OF OKLAHOMA TODAY.

OUR GRATITUDE IS WITH THE
TEACHERS WHO GAVE THEIR ALL
TO SHIELD THEIR CHILDREN
WITH THE NEIGHBORS FIRST
RESPONDERS AND EMERGENCY
PERCH NELL TO HO RACED TO
HELP AS SOON AS THE TORNADO
PASSED.

AND WITH ALL OF THOSE WHO
AS DARKNESS FELL SEARCHED
FOR SURVIVORS THROUGH THE
NIGHT TENT THE FLAG ON
CAPITOL HILL IS STILL
FLYING AT HALF-STAFF IN
HONOR OF THE VICTIMS IN
OKLAHOMA.

ED HENRY LIVE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TONIGHT.

ED?

SHEP IT'S INTERESTING
BEFORE THE PRESIDENT MADE
COMMENTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE
HE HAD A HIGH LEVEL
BRIEFING WITH SOME OF THE
ADVISORS INCLUDING JANET
NAPOLITANO.

YOU CAN SEE THE OFFICIAL
WHITE HOUSE PHOTO OF THAT,
LISA MONICA.

ONE OF THE OTHER ADVISORS
THERE.

YOU REMEMBER SHE WAS
PIVOTAL IN THE BOSTON
BOMBING INVESTIGATION AS
WELL IN TERMS OF KEEPING
THE PRESIDENT IN THE LOOP
ABOUT THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENT.

AND THE PRESIDENT MADE
CLEAR THAT THE FULL FORCE
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
WILL BE ON HAND IN OKLAHOMA
TO DEAL WITH THIS TRAGEDY.

TAKE A LISTEN.

NEIGHBORHOODS WERE
DESTROYED.

DOZENS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR
LIVES.

MANY MORE WERE INJURED.

AND AMONG THE VICTIMS WERE
YOUNG CHILDREN TRYING TO
TAKE SHELTER IN THE SAFEST
PLACE THEY KNEW, THEIR
SCHOOL.

INTERESTING AS WELL
BECAUSE CRAIG FUGATE WAS
NOT IN THIS BRIEFING WITH
THE PRESIDENT ONLY BECAUSE
HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY
TO OKLAHOMA.

SO HIS DEPUTY WAS HERE TO
HELP BRIEF THE PRESIDENT
THE HOMELAND SECURITY
SECRETARY JANET NAPOLITANO
IS NOW ON HER WAY AS WELL.

SHE WILL BE IN OKLAHOMA
WHERE YOU ARE TOMORROW,
SHEP.

MEANWHILE, IN TERMS OF THE
PRESIDENT WE DON'T KNOW
YET WHEN HE WILL GO.

BUT WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS
ARE SAYING PRIVATELY THAT
LIKELY GO AT SOME POINT BUT
RIGHT NOW PUBLICLY, THEY
ARE SAYING HE DOES NOT WANT
TO GET IN THE WAY OF ALL
THE FIRST RESPONDERS TRYING
TO YOU KNOW, BRING
EVERYONE TOGETHER, TRY IN
THAT RECOVERY MISSION TO
DEAL WITH EVERYONE ON THE
GROUND.

THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO
DO IS BRING THE PRESIDENT'S
SECURITY DETAIL IN AND
DISTRACT FROM ALL OF THAT,
SHEP.

WE WON'T SEE HIM FOR AT
LEAST A COUPLE DAYS.

TAKE MUCH MORE TRAFFIC
CONGESTION HERE FOR SURE.

ED HENRY AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.

THERE HAVE BEEN MANY
STORIES OF FAMILIES WHO
RODE OUT THIS TORNADO IN
THEIR UNDERGROUND STORM
SHELTERS.

EARLIER TODAY OUR CASEY
STEGALL WENT OUT INTO ONE
OF THOSE SMALL SPACES AND
GOT A SENSE OF WHAT IT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR
PEOPLE TO CLIMB BACK OUT
ONLY TO FIND HEIR HOMES
WERE I DON'T KNOW IF GONE.

IN OKLAHOMA, THESE ARE
COMMON IN THE HOMES.

THEY ARE JUST A LITTLE
SPACE AND YOU HAVE LUGGAGE
IN HERE.

SOME BOTTLED WATER.

MAYBE YOUR RADIO WEATHER
RADIO, A FLASH LIGHT.

LOOK AT THIS.

THIS IS THE GARAGE.

YOU CAN SEE THAT'S WHAT'S
LEFT OF THE HOME.

ALL AROUND.

THE FEAR IS SOME HOMES MAY
HAVE COLLAPSED ON TOP OF
THOSE STORM SHELTERS AND
THE FEAR IS SOME PEOPLE
COULD STILL BE TRAPPED.

SO THEY ARE FEVERISHLY
SEARCHING.

COME COMING UP A LIVE
REPORT FROM THE DISASTER
SCENE AND WORD ON THE COST
OF THIS DEVASTATION.

FIRST, WE ARE TRACKING
THREATS OF MORE SEVERE
WEATHER RIGHT NOW.

OUR METEOROLOGIST JANICE
DEAN IN THE FOX EXTREME
WEATHER CENTER LIVE BACK IN
NEW YORK.

JANICE?

HI, SHEPARD YES.

WE STILL HAVE ARKANSAS,
LOUISIANA, MISSISSIPPI UP
TOWARDS TENNESSEE AND
KENTUCKY.

AND SEVERAL SEVERE
THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS JUST
EAST OF DALLAS.

NORTH AND EAST OF AUSTIN,
MOVING IN TOWARDS THE
CAROLINAS.

GEORGIA, TENNESSEE AND
KENTUCKY EACH THE
NORTHEAST WE ARE SEEING
MANY SEVERE THUNDERSTORM
WARNINGS.

SO SOMETHING WE ARE GOING
TO TRACK THROUGHOUT THE
EVENING.

THERE IS YOUR SEVERE RISK
IN THE YELLOW WITH THAT RED
SHADED AREA WHERE WE STILL
THINK WE COULD HAVE THE
POTENTIAL FOR HAIL
DAMAGING WINDS AND EVEN
TORNADOES.

THE GOOD NEWS IS STY SKIES
ARE CLEARING IN MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

MORE COVERAGE WITH SHEPARD
SMITH LIVE FROM MOORE
OKLAHOMA WHEN WE RETURN.

IT'S "THE FOX REPORT."

IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE
HOUR, TIME FOR THE TOP OF
THE NEWS FROM MOORE
OKLAHOMA.

THE COMMUNITY HERE WILL
REBUILD.

IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME.

THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO
REPAIR.

NOTHING FOR FAMILIES TO
SALVAGE.

INSTEAD, THEY ARE HAVING TO
CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT AND
FRANKLY START FROM SCRATCH.

JUST WATCH HERE AS ONE
FAMILY CONFRONTED THE
BRUTAL REALTY THEY RECORDED
THE MOMENT THAT THEY
EMERGED FROM THEIR
UNDERGROUND STORM SHELTER
EVERYTHING THEY OWN IN A
PILE OF RUBBLE.

RIGHT WHERE THEIR HOME HAD
BEEN.

NOT A SINGLE STRUCTURE
STANDING AS FAR AS THE
CAMERA COULD SEE.

WE CANNOT MEASURE OF HUMAN
COST OF THIS TRAGEDY YET.

BUT THE DAMAGE TO HOMES AND
BUSINESSES COULD BE IN THE
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

IN FACT, OKLAHOMA'S
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER
PREDICTS IT WILL TOP THE
$3 BILLION IN DAMAGE FROM
THE JOB PALESTINIAN
MISSOURI STORM A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO.

TODAY WE SPOKE WITH A WOMAN
WHO WENT TO JOPLIN BACK
THEN TO HELP.

SHE SAYS SHE REMEMBERS
VIVIDLY THOSE HEART BROKEN
SURVIVORS NOW SHE IS ONE OF
THEM.

I'M FROM KANSAS
ORIGINALLY.

SO FRIENDS AND I WENT OVER
AND WE JUST HELPED PASS OUT
WATER AND WE HELPED PEOPLE
GO THROUGH HOMES AND GET
WHAT THEY COULD AND, YOU
KNOW YOU ALWAYS PRAY AND
HOPE THAT IT'S NEVER YOU.

AND I HOPED IT WASN'T US
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS.

THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF HER
HOME SEARCHING FOR HER DOG.

HER PUT WAS IN A BACK ROOM
WHEN THE TWISTER HIT.

SHE SAYS THE ENTIRE ROOM
VANISHED DOG AND ALL.

CASEY STEGALL SPOKE TODAY
WITH THAT WOMAN AND MANY OF
THE OTHER VICTIMS.

CASEY, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING
THERE WHERE YOU ARE?

WELL, SHEPARD YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE STARTED OUR DAY
THIS MORNING IT WAS A
MEMBER OF YOUR OWN TEAM WHO
SAID HEY WHERE ARE YOU
LOCATED?

I LOOKED AROUND AND I WAS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
TO TELL THEM TO GO AND I
REALIZED I WAS LOOKING IN
THE WRONG SPOT TO TELL THEM
WE WERE AT HEATHER LANE AND
SOUTHWEST SIXTH STREET.

SHEPARD, ON THE OUTSIDE
TODAY WAS ABOUT SIFTING
THROUGH THE RUBBLE IT WAS
ABOUT PICKING THROUGH THE
PIECES AND CLEANING UP.

BUT ON THE INSIDE, IT WAS
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE ALL
TOGETHER IT WAS ABOUT HOPE.

HOPE THAT MORE SURVIVORS
WOULD BE FOUND AND HOPE
THAT THE DEATH TOLL
WOULDN'T RISE AND THAT IS
EXACTLY EMBODIED RIGHT BACK
THERE.

LOOK AT THAT A POWERFUL
IMAGE, A TATTERED AMERICAN
FLAG HANGING.

THE HOMEOWNER THERE SAYS
THAT HIS WIFE AND TWO
CHILDREN RODE THE STORM OUT
IN THEIR BATHTUB.

THEY ARE OKAY.

HE SAID HE WANTED TO HANG
THAT FLAG THERE AS A
REMINDER THAT NEIGHBORS ARE
HELPING THY NEIGHBOR AND
THIS COMMUNITY WILL
REBUILD.

WE ALSO WERE HERE THIS
MORNING WHEN THIS PERIMETER
WAS UNSEALED AND THEY LET
THE RESIDENTS IN FOR THE
VERY FIRST TIME AND WE WERE
WITH THIS WOMAN WHEN SHE
SAW EVERYTHING FIRSTHAND
EVERYTHING I KNOW, I RODE
MY STREET, MY BIKE THROUGH
THIS STREET.

THESE ARE MY FRIENDS
HOUSES.

I USED TO TAKE THE BUS
ROUTE AROUND HERE AND NOW
I DON'T KNOW, JUST REALLY
SAD AND SCARY AND IT'S
GOING TO TAKE SO LONG TO
REBUILD.

BUT THEY WILL REBUILD.

WE HAVE SEEN IT DONE
ELSEWHERE.

AND WE WILL SEE IT HERE.

IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT
WE WILL GET THERE.

CERTAINLY WILL TAKE SOME
TIME.

CASEY STEGALL IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT ALL.

CASEY, THANKS.

DISASTER RELIEF IS WELL
UNDERWAY HERE.

SALVATION ARMY OFFICIALS
SAY THAT THEY HAVE
DISPATCHED RESPONSE TEAMS
AND SET UP MOBILE FOOD
STATIONS TO GET REALLY

WE ARE GOING TO GO TO BED
AT THAT TIME.

ALL ROUTINES ARE OUT THE
DOOR.

AND CHILDREN ARE A LOT OF
WORK FOR A LOT OF FOLKS
AROUND HERE NOW.

MUCH MORE AHEAD FROM
OKLAHOMA.

WE'LL BRING YOU THE
BREAKING DETAILS AS THEY
COME IN.

PLUS WE'RE FOLLOWING OTHER
BIG STORIES TODAY.

INCLUDING THE TRIAL OF JODI
ARIAS WHO SPOKE OUT TODAY
IN COURT.

YOU WILL HEAR WHY SHE SAYS
SHE WOULD PREFER NOT TO DIE
IN PRISON AND ALL THAT SHE
HAS TO PROVIDE SOCIETY FROM
INSIDE PRISON, THAT AND THE
HORROR IN THE HEARTLAND
JUST AHEAD AS FOX REPORTS
LIVE TONIGHT.

MOVE OKLAHOMA WITH MORE ON
THE KILLER TORNADO IN THE
HEARTLAND.

FIRST, JURORS HAVE BEGAN
DELIBERATING WITH JODI
ARIAS GETS LIFE OR DEATH
AFTER SHE REVEALED TODAY
THAT SHE NO LONGER WANTS TO
DIE OR SO SHE SAYS IS.

SHE NOW SAYS SHE WANTS LIFE
IN PRISON.

UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, I
COULD NOT HAVE MANAGED
STANDING BEFORE YOU ALL AND
ASKING YOU TO GIVE ME LIFE.

TO ME, LIFE IN PRISON WAS
THE MOST UNAPPEALING
OUTCOME I COULD POSSIBLY
THINK OF.

I THOUGHT I WOULD RATHER
DIE.

BUT AS I STAND HERE NOW, I
CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE
ASK TO YOU SENTENCE ME TO
THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE TOLD
OUR STATION FOX 10 IN
PHOENIX JUST HOURS AFTER
THE JURY FOUND HER GUILTY
OF MURDER IN THE FIRST
DEGREE AFTER SHE STABBED
HER EX-BOYFRIEND 27 TIMES
SHOT HIM AND SLIT HIS
THROAT.

AT THAT TIME SHE CALLED
DEATH THE ULTIMATE FREEDOM
BUT TODAY SHE TOLD THE JURY
SHE HAS MORE PERSPECTIVE
NOW ABOUT THE POSITIVE
CHANGE SHE CAN MAKE IN
PRISON.

I DESIGNED A T-SHIRT.

THIS IS THE T-SHIRT.

WHICH 100% OF THE PROCEEDS
GO TO SUPPORT NONPROFIT
ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ALSO
IS OTHER VICTIMS OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

AND THE DEFENSE DID NOT
PRESENT MUCH EVIDENCE TO
SUPPORT THE CLAIM THAT SHE
HERSELF WAS A VICTIM OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE AT ALL.

TODAY SHE SAID THAT PEOPLE
THAT DON'T BELIEVE HER ARE
ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINIONS.

SHE ALSO SHOWED OFF SOME OF
HER AFTER THE -- ARTWORK
DRAWINGS OF FRANK SINATRA
ELVIS PRESLEY AND ELIZABETH
TAYLOR.

JODI ARIAS SAYS AS IT
STANDS SHE WILL NEVER
CREATE ANOTHER OIL PAINTING
IN HER LIFE AND WE ARE NOW
ABOUT TO HEAR EVEN MORE
FROM THIS, WOMAN BECAUSE
SHE HAS AGREED TO
INTERVIEWS WITH MAJOR
TELEVISION NETWORKS,
INCLUDING FOX LATER
TONIGHT.

TRACE GALLAGHER LIVE IN THE
WEST COAST NEWS HUB.

MAYBE THIS WILL BE THE LAST
OF IT.

JURY HAS THE CASE AGAIN
SHEP.

THEY DELIVERED IT FOR AN
HOUR AND HOUR AND A HALF.

15 MINUTES AGO 1000 LOCAL.

100 IN THE EAST.

EXPERTS DO NOT BELIEVE
THESE DELIBERATIONS DIDN'T
LAST VERY LONG.

REMEMBER DURING THE GUILT
PHASE DELIBERATED 15 HOURS.

DURING THE AGGRAVATING
PHASE THEY ONLY DELIBERATED
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.

HERE NOW IS A SAMPLE OF THE
CLOSING ARGUMENTS FROM BOTH
SIDES.

ALL OF THIS IS BEING
PRESENTED TO YOU DURING
THIS PHASE OF THE
PROCEEDINGS.

MOST OF IT HAS COME FROM
THE DEFENDANT'S MOUTH.

THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL
NOT HESITATE WHEN THE TRUTH
FAILS TO COME UP WITH A
LIE.

BUT LYING IS NOT A
CAPITAL CRIME.

AND LYING DOES NOT GIVE YOU
THE DEATH PENALTY AND LYING
ISN'T EVEN AN AGO
AGGRAVATING FACTOR.

IF SHE GETS LIFE SHE
GOES BACK TO THE MARICOPA
COUNTY JAIL FOR A SHORT
TIME AND THEN TO PRISON.

IF SHE GETS DEATH.

SHE GOES DIRECTLY TO DEATH
ROW, SHEP.

PERSPECTIVE NOW TRACE.

IF I IF I FILL US IN ON ALL
THIS PERSPECTIVE.

YEAH, SHE SAID THAT IF
SHE ASKED FOR THE DEATH
PENALTY IT WOULD BE LIKE
COMMITTING SUICIDE AND THAT
WOULD BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL
FOR HER FAMILY AND SHE SAYS
HER FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH
ENOUGH PAIN.

SHE SAYS IF SHE GETS LIFE
IN PRISON, SHE WOULD TEACH
INMATES SPANISH EVEN SIGN
LANGUAGE.

MAYBE EVEN START UP A BOOK
CLUB.

SHE SAYS THE TIME FOR
HEALING HAS BEGUN.

LISTEN.

THIS IS THE WORST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER
DONE.

IT'S THE WORST THING I EVER
COULD HAVE SEEN MYSELF
DOING.

IN FACT, I COULDN'T SEE
MYSELF DOING IT BEFORE THAT
DAY I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT TO
HARM A SPIDER.

YOU COULD SEE JODI ARIAS
WAS CLEARLY NERVOUS AS SHE
WAS READING THAT STATEMENT.

THE FAMILY OF TRAVIS
ALEXANDER SAT IN THE
BACKGROUND MOTIONLESS.

JODI ARIAS WILL SPEAK WITH
FOX TONIGHT 930 LOCAL TIME
AND WE WILL AIR PARTS OF
THAT INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

BROADCAST NETWORK OR FOX
NEWS CHANNEL OR WHAT?
