THIS IS "WORLD NEWS."

TONIGHT, YOSEMITE BURNING.

AND THE NEW THREAT THIS EVENING.

THE FIERCE WINDS NOW FUELING THE
FIRE.

AS CREWS FIGHT TO PROTECT THE
ANCIENT SEQUOIAS.

THE HOMES ON THE PARK'S EDGE.

AND THE RESERVOIR WHERE SAN
FRANCISCO GETS ITS WATER.

THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IN EFFECT
TONIGHT.

TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.

THE MESSAGE FROM THE U.S. TO
SYRIA THIS EVENING.

WILL THE WHITE HOUSE TAKE
ACTION, AFTER NEW AND GRUESOME
IMAGES?

ABC'S MARTHA RADDATZ, STANDING
BY.

TAKING ON TRUMP.

THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS
SUING DONALD TRUMP TONIGHT,
AFTER SPENDING OVER 35 GRAND TO
ATTEND TRUMP UNIVERSITY.

WHAT DID THEY GET IN RETURN?

AND THE LITTLE BOY AND HIS
BRAVERY.

CALLING 911.

SOMEONE'S TRYING TO BREAK
INTO MY HOUSE.

WHAT HE DOES, AND THAT
CALMING VOICE AT THE OTHER END.

YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

YOU'RE DOING REAL GOOD.

DOING PERFECT.

YOUR MOM'S GOING TO BE SO PROUD
OF YOU.

GOOD EVENING AND THANKS FOR
BEING HERE ON A SUNDAY NIGHT.

AND WE DO BEGIN WITH THE NEW
THREAT THIS EVENING.

THE FIERCE WINDS NOW FUELING THE
FIRE, BURNING IN YOSEMITE
NATIONAL PARK.

WINDS EXPECTED THROUGH THE
EVENING AND TONIGHT, NOT ONLY
ARE FIRE CREWS TRYING TO KEEP
THE FLAMES FROM REACHING
THOUSANDS OF HOMES, THEY ARE
BATTING TO PROTECT THOSE FAMOUS
GIANT SEQUOIAS, THE ANCIENT
TREASURES OF THE PARK.

THE FIRE HAS NOT REACHED THEM
YET, BUT SO MANY OTHER TREES THE
FIRE HAS REACHED.

133,000 ACRES, A HUGE PART OF
THE PARK, ALREADY CHARRED.

JUST LISTEN TO IT TONIGHT.

THE SOUND OF THE BONE DRY TIMBER
GOING UP IN FLAMES.

AND OUR TEAM, VISITING THAT
CRUCIAL RESERVOIR IN THE PARK,
WHERE SAN FRANCISCO GETS ITS
WATER SUPPLY.

CONTRIBUTING TO THAT STATE OF
EMERGENCY NOW IN CALIFORNIA.

AND TONIGHT, AS 47 FIRES BURN IN
NINE WESTERN STATES, THE BIGGEST
FIGHT IS RIGHT THERE AT YOSEMITE
AND THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN WITH
ABC'S NEAL KARLINSKY AGAIN
TONIGHT.

INSIDE YOSEMITE IS HOT AND
INTENSE.

CREWS AREN'T JUST TRYING TO STOP
THE FIRE -- THEY'RE TRYING TO
PROTECT A GROVE OF THE PARK'S
FAMED SEQUOIAS -- THREE DOZEN IN
ALL.

THE HUGE TREES ARE AMONG THE
OLDEST LIVING THINGS ON EARTH,
AND TEAMS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED
JUST TO THEM.

I'M FROM VIRGINIA, SO THE
FUEL TYPES HERE ARE DIFFERENT.

AND THIS IS DEFINITELY DRY, SO,
THIS IS SOME PRETTY EXTREME FIRE
BEHAVIOR THAT WE'RE ENCOUNTERING
HERE.

INSIDE THE PARK TO PROTECT THE
AREA AROUND THE MASSIVE
HETCH HETCHY RESERVOIR.

WE SAW FIRST HAND, THE FIRE IS
CLOSE TO THE AREA THAT SUPPLIES
85% OF SAN FRANCISCO'S WATER.

CAUSE ENOUGH FOR THE GOVERNOR TO
DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND
PUT PUBLIC UTILITY CREWS ON
ALERT TO MONITOR THE WATER'S
QUALITY.

IT'S STILL ACTIVELY BURNING
AS WE SPEAK.

IT HAS AFFECTED OUR WATER AND
POWER SYSTEM.

THE PARK, CREWS ARE CUTTING DOWN
BURNED TREES THEY CALL "WIDOW
MAKERS," BECAUSE THEY FALL
WITHOUT WARNING.

FURTHER TO THE NORTH, THE NOW
FAMILIAR SIGHT -- MORE FAMILIES
DISPLACED, EVACUATING AS THE
FIRE BURNS THEIR WAY.

15 MINUTES TO BE OUT OF OUR
HOUSE.

SO WE ONLY GOT OUR KIDS, OUR
ANIMALS AND A LITTLE BIT OF
PICTURES.

CHOKED WITH THICK SMOKE AND ASH
IS THE PROBLEM.

YOU CAN FEEL IT.

YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

IT'S PRETTY BAD.

I'M ALL CONGESTED.

YOU GET THE SINUS INFECTION AND
ALL THAT STUFF.

TO PROTECT.

THESE PICTURES WERE TAKEN INSIDE
YOSEMITE ON SATURDAY BY TOURISTS
HERE FROM THE UK, AMAZED THAT
THE FIRE IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
INSIDE -- FOR NOW.

WE'RE HERED A THE SIDE OF
YOSEMITE THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED
OFF AND IS NOW BEING PROTECTED
BY FIREFIGHTERS.

THIS FIRE REMAINS VERY INTENSE,
ONLY ABOUT 7% CONTAINED.

IT'S BURNING HOT, THEY'RE HAVING
A VERY HARD TIME GETTING AHOLD
OF THIS ONE, DAVID.

ALL RIGHT, NEAL KARLINSKY
LEADING US OFF.

NEAL, OUR THANKS TO YOU.

I WANT TO BRING IN ABC
METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE.

AND AS WE'VE BEEN SAYING HERE,
THE MAJOR THREAT TONIGHT, THE
WINDS.

RIGHT.

AND THAT IS GOING TO SUBSIDE
ONLY A LITTLE AS WE GET INTO THE
START OF THE WORK WEEK.

I HAVE TO SHOW YOU, DAVID,
THE REAL PROBLEM IS GOING TO BE
THE HEAT AND, OF COURSE, THE DRY
CONDITIONS.

IT'S GOING TO BE EVEN HOTTER AND
DRIER AS WE START THIS WEEK IN
THAT PART OF CALIFORNIA.

ALSO, THE FLOODING AND THE
HEAT YOU'RE WATCHING AS WE TURN
TO ANOTHER WEEK.

RIGHT.

HUGE HEADLINES COMING OUT.

AND WE'VE GOT FLASH FLOODING
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN
THE SOUTHWEST.

YOU CAN SEE, SOME PICTURES,
FRESH IN FROM NEAR NEEDLES,
CALIFORNIA, WHERE U.S. 95 MEETS
HIGHWAY 40, I-40, IT HAD TO SHUT
DOWN IN BOTH WAYS BECAUSE OF ALL
THAT RAIN.

GREATER THAN A HALF INCH IN JUST
15 MINUTES.

I HAVE TO SHOW YOU, IT'S NOT
OVER.

AND THIS IS A TWO-DAY EVENT
HERE.

REALLY MOSTLY TONIGHT INTO EARLY
TOMORROW, YOU COULD GET TWO-PLUS
INCHES VERY QUICKLY.

AND QUICKLY DAVID, I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, HEAT IN THE MIDWEST,
IT IS RECORD-BREAKING.

MINNEAPOLIS TODAY HIT 96.

LEGITIMATE HEAT WAVE FOR
CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS AND KANSAS
CITY.

ALL RIGHT, TRACKING IT ALL.

GINGER ZEE TONIGHT.

GINGER, THANK YOU.

NOW TO THE CRISIS IN SYRIA
THIS EVENING, AND TO A MESSAGE
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, INTENDED
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF SYRIA.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THERE IS
VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS
THE SYRIAN REGIME THAT USED
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AGAINST ITS OWN
PEOPLE IN RECENT DAYS.

AND TONIGHT, MORE OF THOSE NEW
IMAGES OF THE AFTERMATH.

BELIEVED TO BE THE SINGLE
DEADLIEST ATTACK SO FAR THERE IN
SYRIA.

SYRIA SAYS IT WILL ALLOW
INSPECTORS.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING THAT TIME
HAS PASSED.

AND SO TONIGHT HERE, WE ASK,
WILL AMERICA ACT?

WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS?

AND IF SO, HOW SOON?

ABC'S CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS
CORRESPONDENT, MARTHA RADDATZ,
REPORTING IN FROM THE REGION
AGAIN TONIGHT.

MARTHA?

TO TAKING MILITARY ACTION IN
SYRIA THAN EVER BEFORE, WITH
STRONG WORDS FROM U.S. OFFICIALS
TODAY AND WARSHIPS AT THE READY.

NAVY DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES
NOW IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA
COULD LAUNCH CRUISE MISSILES
INTO SYRIA WHENEVER ORDERED,
TARGETING SYRIAN REGIME COMMAND
AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS,
AIRFIELDS OR AIRCRAFT THAT MIGHT
BE USED TO CARRY CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

ANOTHER OPTION -- U.S.

FIGHTER
JETS LAUNCHING WEAPONS FROM
OUTSIDE SYRIAN AIR SPACE.

THE SYRIANS HAVE CREATED THIS
SANCTUARY, WHERE THERE ARE
SURFACE TO AIR MISSILES.

SUSPECTED CHEMICAL ATTACK HAVE
OUTRAGED THE WORLD.

MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN KILLED
IN THE MOST HORRIFIC WAY.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SAYS HE WILL NOT
INTERVENE UNTIL THE ATTACK IS
VERIFIED, BUT ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS ARE TONIGHT SAYING
THERE IS A STRONG SUSPICION THAT
THE ASSAD REGIME LAUNCHED THE
ATTACK, ADDING THAT THE REBELS
DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE KIND OF
ROCKETS IN WHICH THE CHEMICALS
WERE BELIEVED TO BE DELIVERED.

TODAY, SYRIA SAID IT WOULD ALLOW
U.N.

INSPECTORS TO VISIT THE
SITE, BUT AMERICAN OFFICIALS SAY
IT'S TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE, AND
THE EVIDENCE THEY WOULD PRESENT
IS LIKELY CORRUPTED.

SO, HOW SOON COULD THIS HAPPEN?

U.S. OFFICIALS TELL ABC NEWS, A
RESPONSE MUST BE TIMELY, DONE
SOON ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANOTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACK.

"WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
MONTHS."

I THINK THE BEST THAT WE
COULD HOPE FOR IS TO DETER MR.
ASSAD FROM USING CHEMICALS
AGAINST HIS PEOPLE AGAIN.

AND WORST CASE, DRAG US INTO A
LARGER MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT.

ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO MADE
VERY CLEAR THEY DO NOT WANT TO
TAKE ANY KIND OF ACTION ALONE.

SO, THERE HAVE BEEN URGENT
MEETINGS WITH ALLIES HERE IN THE
REGION AND ELSEWHERE.

DAVID?

MARTHA RADDATZ WITH US AGAIN
TONIGHT.

MARTHA, OUR THANKS TO YOU.

AND NOW TO EGYPT THIS
EVENING, WHERE IT'S BEEN HARD TO
KEEP TRACK OF WHICH LEADERS ARE
JAILED, WHICH ONES HAVE BEEN SET
FREE.

TONIGHT, THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF
FORMER EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI
MUBARAK SINCE HE WAS RELEASED
LAST WEEK.

MUBARAK ARRIVING BY HELICOPTER
FOR A COURT APPEARANCE THIS
SUNDAY.

THIS IS NOW HIS RETRIAL FOR THE
KILLING OF PROTESTERS DURING THE
ARAB SPRING.

INSIDE, HE SAT IN A WHEELCHAIR
IN THE DEFENDANT'S CAGE, WEARING
DARK SUNGLASSES THERE.

LAST WEEK, WE SHOWED YOU MUBARAK
BEING FREED AFTER THE CURRENT
PRESIDENT, MOHAMED MORSI, WAS
JAILED INSTEAD.

TO ANOTHER CASE OVERSEAS
INVOLVING AMERICAN COLLEGE
STUDENT AMANDA KNOX, WHO NOW
SAYS SHE WILL NOT BE ATTENDING
THE SECOND TRIAL IN HER CASE IN
ITALY.

HER LAWYERS HAVE CONFIRMED THAT
SHE WILL NOT GOT BACK FOR THE
PROCEEDINGS.

KNOX IS BEING TRIED AGAIN FOR
THE MURDER OF HER ROOMMATE BACK
IN 2007.

SHE SPENT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON
FOR THAT CRIME BEFORE HE
CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED.

HER LAWYERS WILL REPRESENT HER
AT THE RETRIAL, WHICH BEGINS
NEXT MONTH.

AND TO AUSTRALIA TONIGHT,
WHERE THERE IS A SEARCH UNDER
WAY THIS EVENING FOR A VICTIM
AFTER A VERY RARE ATTACK THERE.

A YOUNG MAN VANISHING AFTER
BEING ATTACKED BY A CROCODILE IN
AN AREA WHERE THE ONCE
ENDANGERED CROCODILE POPULATION
IS NOW FLOURISHING.

AND IT ALL PLAYED OUT AS
ONLOOKERS WATCHED HORRIFIED BY
WHAT THEY SAW.

HERE'S ABC'S JEFFREY KOFMAN.

TAKE PICTURES.

BUT STAY OUT OF THE WATER.

THAT IS THE VERY CLEAR ADVICE
FOR TOURISTS IN THIS
CROCODILE-INFESTED CORNER OF
AUSTRALIA.

24-YEAR-OLD SHAWN COLE WAS AT A
WIRTH DATE PARTY IN A REMOTE
JUNGLE LODGE WHEN HE AND A PAL
DECIDED TO IGNORE THE COUNCIL
AND SWIM IN THIS NOTORIOUS
RIVER.

AS HIS HORRIFIED FRIENDS LOOKED
ON, IT WAS OVER IN AN INSTANT.

A 16-FOOT CROCK SNAPPED HIS JAWS
AND THE YOUNG PARTY-GOER
DISAPPEARED.

ONE OF THE GUARDS THAT WORK
HERE SAID, LOOK, I THINK
SOMEONE'S BEEN TAKEN BY A CROCK.

I WENT, ARE YOU JOKING?

AND THOUSANDS IN THIS RIVER.

POLICE AND WILDLIFE OFFICERS
RUSHED TO THE SCENE, SEARCHING
THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR SOME SIGN
OF THE VICTIM.

BY DAYBREAK, THEY KILLED THREE
GIANT CROCKS, BUT FOUND NOTHING.

JEFFREY KOFMAN, ABC NEWS,
LONDON.

JEFFREY, THANK YOU.

AND BACK HERE AT HOME
TONIGHT, AND TO A BREAK IN THE
CASE IN TEXAS, AFTER A
REMARKABLE 911 CALL.

A BRAVE BOY AS HIS HOME WAS
BEING ROBBED, CALLING FOR HELP.

AND THE CALMING VOICE AT THE
OTHER END OF THE LINE.

HERE TONIGHT, ABC'S GIO BENITEZ.

12-YEAR-OLD DEION MURDOCH DIALS
911, ALONE IN HIS TEXAS HOME.

911.

WHERE IS THE EMERGENCY?

HELLO?

SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BREAK
INTO MY HOUSE.

THEY JUST BROKE THE WINDOW,
MA'AM.

THEY JUST BROKE THE WINDOW?

WHAT ROOM ARE YOU IN?

I'M IN MY MOTHER'S ROOM RIGHT
NOW.

PLEASE HURRY.

IS YOUR HOUSE -- I AM.

STAY ON THE PHONE WITH ME.

THE CLOSET, DOING HER BEST TO
REASSURE HIM ALONG THE WAY.

AS POLICE SAY THESE TWO YOUNG
MEN BREAK INTO THE HOUSE.

I'M GOING TO HAVE TO WHISPER
NOW BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE
COMING IN.

PLEASE HURRY.

THEY ARE, THEY ARE.

THEY'RE IN THERE.

THEY'RE INSIDE THE ROOM NOW.

SILENCE FOR A FULL MINUTE.

YOU THERE?

DEION?

OKAY, JUST STAY THERE.

THE OFFICERS, I THINK THEY'RE
GOING TO CATCH THE GUY, OKAY?

ARRIVED, THEY SAID THEY SAW THE
TWO MEN RUNNING FROM THE HOME.

THE DISPATCHER KEEPING THE CHILD
ON THE LINE, WITH A LOVING TONE.

SO, IS THE POLICE OFFICER
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE?

YEAH.

BUT STAY INSIDE THE CLOSET.

BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND
THE BAD GUYS, OKAY?

YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

YOU'RE DOING REAL GOOD.

DOING PERFECT.

YOUR MOM'S GOING TO BE SO PROUD
OF YOU.

THIS IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY
THING I COULD THINK OF.

WELL, YOU THOUGHT WELL.

YOU THOUGHT WELL.

YOU'RE A VERY, VERY SMART YOUNG
MAN.

YOU DID A GOOD THING.

AND DURING THE BREAK-IN, DEION'S
MOM SAYS SHE WAS AT THE HOUSING
AUTHORITY, LOOKING FOR A NEW
HOME.

BECAUSE OF THE BOY'S QUICK
THINKING AND THAT CALM
DISPATCHER, DAVID, THE SUSPECTS
ARE NOW BEHIND BARS.

LOVE HOW SHE SAID THE MOM
WOULD BE PROUD.

SO MANY PROUD OF THE DISPATCHER,
TOO.

THANK,S, GIO.

TO WASHINGTON TONIGHT, THE
HISTORIC CIVIL RIGHTS MARCH, 50
YEARS AGO, IS BEING REMEMBERED.

A QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE
FLOODING THE CITY IN 1963,
MARCHING FOR THEIR RIGHTS.

THIS WEEKEND, TENS OF THOUSANDS
RETURNING TO REMEMBER MARTIN
LUTHER KING DELIVERING HIS "I
HAVE A DREAM" SPEECH.

TONIGHT HERE, WE HEAR FROM
ANOTHER MAN WHO SPOKE THAT DAY,
THAT KNEW KING AND WHO KNEW
PRESIDENT JFK, A PRESIDENT
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT WOULD PLAY
OUT THAT DAY.

ABC'S BYRON PITTS IS IN
WASHINGTON.

PREACHER HAD THE AUDACITY TO
DREAM ALOUD.

WE ARE DETERMINED TO BE FREE
IN '63.

OPTIMISTIC.

ORGANIZERS HOPED FOR 100,000.

A QUARTER MILLION SHOWED UP.

DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

1963, NOT A SOUL HAD A CLUE HOW
IT MIGHT TURN OUT.

EDITH LEE PAINE WAS 12.

SHE TRAVELED BY BUS NINE HOURS
WITH HER MOTHER TO BE THERE ON
THE MALL.

WHAT DID YOU THINK OF DR. KING?

I HELD ONTO EVERY WORD THAT
HE SAID, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
THAT WAS HERE.

WORLD.

BOTH DRAWN BY WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
AT THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL.

AND STILL REELING FROM WHAT DID
ON THE STREETS OF BIRMINGHAM
WEEKS EARLIER.

CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, BACK
THEN, THE NEWLY APPOINTED
CHAIRMAN OF THE STUDENT
NONVIOLENT COORDINATING
COMMITTEE, WAS ALREADY THERE.

WHEN WE MET WITH PRESIDENT
KENNEDY, HE WAS SO AFRAID OF
VIOLENCE.

WAS ONE OF THE MARCH ORGANIZERS
AND SPEAKERS.

WE WANT TO BE FREE NOW.

YOU RECOGNIZE IT AS AN HISTORIC
MOMENT?

I STEPPED TO THE PODIUM.

I SAW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF
YOUNG PEOPLE.

I SAID TO MYSELF, THIS IS IT.

A KID.

WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING ON
A LUNCH COUNTER STOOL AND
SOMEONE WALK UP AND SPIT ON YOU,
POUR HOT WATER, HOT COFFEE ON
YOU, YOU SAY YOU'RE COMMITTED TO
NONVIOLENCE, YOU HAVE TO GROW
UP.

SAY.

I WAS AN OLD SOUL.

FOR A NEW AMERICA.

I HAVE A DREAM.

ONE MAN, THE FINAL SPEAKER OF
THE DAY.

MY FOUR LITTLE CHILDREN WILL
ONE DAY LIVE IN A NATION WHERE
THEY WILL NOT BE JUDGED BY THE
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN BUT BY THE
CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER.

I HAVE A DREAM TODAY.

LATER.

YOU STILL COME HERE OFTEN?

OH, YES.

TO REFLECT.

TO REMEMBER.

FRIEND AND THE DAY THAT BOTH
MADE HISTORY AND CHANGED IT.

OUR THANKS TO BYRON TONIGHT.

AND ABC NEWS WILL CARRY
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH,
MARKING THE ANNIVERSARY, LIVE
FROM THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL,
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON HERE.

AND A PASSING TO NOTE
TONIGHT, A STAR OF STAGE, SCREEN
AND TV HAS DIED.

JULIE HARRIS PLAYED A
12-YEAR-OLD IN "THE MEMBER OF
THE WEDDING" AND WON FIVE TONY
AWARDS FOR HER ACTING ON
BROADWAY.

IN HOLLYWOOD, SHE STARRED AS THE
ROMANTIC LEAD AGAINST HEARTTHROB
JAMES DEAN IN "EAST OF EDEN" AND
PLAYED THE FREE SPIRIT ED LILIME
CLEMENTS ON THE PRIMETIME SOAP
"KNOTS LANDING."

JULIE HARRIS WAS 87 YEARS OLD.

AND AN IMAGE TO PASS ALONG
TONIGHT OF AMERICA'S NEWEST
TREASURE.

IN FACT, AFTER A CAREFUL
EXAMINATION THIS SUNDAY, THE
BABY GIANT PANDA BORN AT
WASHINGTON'S NATIONAL ZOO

AND TODAY, THE ALL IMPORTANT
CHECKUP.

ZOO KEEPERS SAY THEY FOUND THE
CUB TO BE HEALTHY AND VIBRANT,
BUT THEY WON'T KNOW IF IT'S A
BOY OR A GIRL FOR ANOTHER TWO OR
THREE WEEKS.

SO STAY TUNED.

THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE
