THIS IS "WORLD NEWS."

TONIGHT, BREAKING NEWS.

A MASSIVE TORNADO, MORE THAN A
MILE WIDE, TEARS THROUGH
OKLAHOMA ON LIVE TV.

JUST SAW A POWER FLASH IN THE
SKY.

THIS IS A LARGE, VIOLENT
TORNADO.

AN ENTIRE TOWN IN RUINS.

FIRES BREAKING OUT.

A SCHOOL SUFFERS A DIRECT HIT.

HOPEFULLY WE DIDN'T LOSE ANY
LIVES HERE.

AS NEIGHBORS DIG THROUGH
DEBRIS BY HAND TO TRY TO HELP
THEIR NEIGHBORS.

THE DAMAGE IS OVERWHELMING.

IT IS MIND-BLOWING.

AND TONIGHT AN OUTBREAK OF
MORE THAN 50 TWISTERS HAS TAKEN
LIVES AND FLATTENED HOMES.

55 MILLION AMERICANS STILL IN
THE STORM ZONE TONIGHT.

OUR EXTREME WEATHER TEAM RIGHT
THERE IN THE HEART OF TORNADO
ALLEY, WITH THE VERY LATEST ON
"WORLD NEWS."

GOOD EVENING ON THIS MONDAY
NIGHT.

AS WE COME ON THE AIR, WE ARE IN
THE MIDDLE OF A BREAKING STORY.

A MASSIVE TORNADO DESCENDING
THROUGH THE HEARD LAND LIKE A
WRECKING BALL.

HOUSES GROUND TO SPLINTERS.

AS THOSE FIRES ERUPED.

WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THERE,
HOURS AGO, WAS THE SCHOOL
GYMNASIUM.

AND THERE'S THIS NEW PHOTO, A
LITTLE GIRL PULLED ALIVE FROM
THE RUBBLE OF HER ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
PASSED ALONG A HUMAN CHAIN TO
SAFETY.

AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
THE MOMENT OF THE CRISIS.

THIS IS IN THE DAY.

SUDDENLY SKIES ARE DARK AS
MIDNIGHT AS THE STORM MOVERS IN.

LISTEN.

[ CRACKLING, WIND BLOWING ]
 AS OF RIGHT NOW, 37 ARE
REPORTED DEAD.

AT LEAST 100 INJURED OR BEING
FREETED IN HOSPITALS.

NATIONAL GUARD DESCENDING AND
EMERGENCY MEDICAL TEAMS RACING
INTO TOWN.

OUR EXTREME WEATHER TEAM IS IN
OKLAHOMA.

AND ABC'S GINGER ZEE LEADS US
OFF.

IT'S TURNING INTO A
DESTRUCTIVE TORNADO AND IT'S
GETTING BIGGER.

LOCAL TELEVISION HELICOPTER
CATCHING THE PICTURES, CATCHING
THIS TORNADO, RANKED A
PRELIMINARY EF-4 HELP YOU CAN
SEE THE FLASHES OF THE POWER
LINES AND TRANSFORMERS BEING
RIPPED APART.

THERE'S A HUGE FLASH RIGHT
THERE.

IT'S JUST RIPPING UP EVERYTHING
IN ITS PATH.

DARKNESS OVERWHELMING MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

YOU CAN SEE THE COLOSSAL TORNADO
BEARING DOWN ON ON THE STREET.

UNBELIEVABLE DESTRUCTION.

ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD, GONE.

HOUSES AND CARS PILED ON TOP OF
EACH OTHER.

IN SOME PARTS, EVERYTHING
LEVELED.

CARS TOSSED.

PEOPLE DIGGING AND CRAWLING
THROUGH RUBBLE.

STARTED HEADING IN.

WE WERE PULLING WALLS OFF OF
PEOPLE.

THERE WERE PEOPLE CRAWLING OUT
FROM EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE.

BASICALLY JUST A WAR ZONE.

BY THE DESTRUCTIVE TORNADO THAT
WREAKED HAVOC FOR ALMOST AN
HOUR.

AND HERE, SCHOOL BUSES STILL
LINED UP OUTSIDE THIS SCHOOL.

BUT THE GYM, TORN APART.

IT JUST TORE THROUGH IT LIKE
A TRUCK RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE
CENTER OF IT.

AND SADLY, THEY FOUND A MAN
AND THEN A WOMAN AND A SMALL
BABY.

OH.

TO SIXTH GRADER BRADY WHO WAS
INSIDE BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL WHEN THE STORM HIT.

UM, WELL, I WAS IN MY
BUILDING.

WE WERE TOLD TO GET IN OUR
TORNADO PRECAUTION SYSTEM.

BUT THEN THEY MOVED US TO THE
BOYS AND GIRLS BATHROOM.

SOME KIDS WERE NOT FOLLOWING
DIRECTIONS OF STAYING AWAY FROM
UNDER THE, UH, SINKS AND STUFF.

AND THEY GOT UNDER THERE AND
SOME OF THE BLOCKS COLLAPSED ON
THEM.

IT WAS JUST DEBRIS.

THERE WAS JUST CARS BEAT UP.

MY MOM WAS FLIPPING OUT.

THAT WAS HER CAR.

ARE YOU DOING ALL RIGHT, BUD?

I KNOW THIS IS PRETTY WILD TO
TAKE IN ALL AT ONE TIME.

HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO
YOUR MOM?

YEAH, SHE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

SHE WAS ABLE TO BE WITH ME.

NEWS, MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

AND FROM GINGER TO ABC'S
VETERAN JOURNALIST MIKE BECHER.

HE'S IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA AS WELL.

YOU KNOW HIM FROM HIS REPORTING
FROM THE DANGEROUS ZONES IN
AFGHANISTAN.

HE REPORTS IN TO US NOW.

DIANE AS THE SUN SETS OVER
THIS MASSIVE SCENE OF
DESTRUCTION IN MOORE, OKLAHOMA,
THE FOCUS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
I'M IN HAS SHIFTED FROM
BRIARWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,
WHICH WAS HIT BY THE TORNADO, TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AS THEY SEARCH
UNDER PILES OF WOOD AND BRICK
AND STONE THAT USED TO BE
HOUSES, LOOKING FOR, EITHER
SURVIVORS, OR FOR THE DEAD.

THE GOOD NEWS NOW IS THAT
STUDENTS IN THE SCHOOL AND
ADULTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
SCHOOL, TELL US THAT NO CHILDREN
DIED.

THAT TORNADO PASSED RIGHT OVER
THAT SCHOOL.

WE WERE LESS THAN A MILE FROM IT
WHEN IT HIT THE SCHOOL, AND YOU
COULD SEE THE EXPLOSION AND THE
DEBRIS WHEN IT HIT THAT LARGE
STONE STRUCTURE.

BUT A LITTLE 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL
PULLED ME ASIDE AND SAID, I WAS
IN THAT SCHOOL.

AND OUR TEACHER GRABBED ME, AND
THE REST OF THE STUDENTS, AND
SAID, WE'RE GOING TO THE SAFE
ROOM, AND WE ALL GOT THERE, AND
WE WERE QUIET.

AND THE TORNADO CAME, AND IT
PASSED.

AND WE WALKED OUT, AND WE WERE
ALL ALIVE.

THAT WAS HER QUOTE.

SHE WAS TAKING IT IN STRIDE
BECAUSE SHE WAS SITTING IN FRONT
OF WHAT USED TO BE HER HOME,
WHICH NO LONGER EXISTED.

SO THIS SEARCH AND RESCUE IN
THIS IMMENSE OF A DISASTER WILL
TAKE DAYS BEFORE THERE'S A FINAL
TOLL OF THE DEAD, AND ALL OF THE
LIVING ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.

DIANE?

THANK YOU SO MUCH, MIKE
BOETTCHER REPORTED IN FOR US
TONIGHT FROM MOORE.

AND WE ARE HEARING REPORTS OF
VICTIMS BEING RUSHED TO NEARBY
HOSPITALS.

MOMENTS AGO I SPOKE TO A
HOSPITAL 12 MILES FROM MOORE,
OKLAHOMA, WHERE THE INJURED ARE
BEING CARED FOR RIGHT NOW.

BROOK, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
TALKING WITH US TONIGHT.

GIVE ME A SENSE, HOW MANY
PATIENTS DO YOU HAVE PER MINUTE
STILL COMING IN?

WE'RE RECEIVING PATIENTS
LITERALLY, MINUTE BY MINUTE.

AT LAST CHECK, WE RECEIVED A
TOTAL OF 37 PATIENTS.

THEY RANGE, WE HAVE TEN IN
CRITICAL CONDITION RIGHT NOW.

12 IN SERIOUS.

AND 15 ARE LISTED IN FAIR OR
GOOD CONDITION AT THE MOMENT.

WHAT KIND OF INJURIES ARE YOU
SEEING?

WE'RE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM
JUST MINOR LACERATIONS TO SEVERE
HEAD INJURIES AND ABDOMINAL
WOUNDS.

MOST LIKELY FROM PUNCTURES FROM
FLYING DEBRIS.

WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT
THOSE CHILDREN IN THE TWO
SCHOOLS, WHO WERE INSIDE.

ANY OF YOUR CHILDREN FROM THOSE
SCHOOLS, AND WHAT ABOUT THEIR
CONDITION?

WE RECEIVED A TOTAL OF FIVE
CHILDREN OF THOSE 37.

I KNOW THAT TWO OF THE 37 WERE
FROM THAT SCHOOL.

AND IS IT POSSIBLE, WITH
PRIVACY, TO GIVE US ANY SENSE OF
THEIR CONDITION?

WELL, THANKFULLY NONE OF THE
FIVE CHILDREN THAT WE HAVE RIGHT
NOW ARE LISTED IN CRITICAL.

ONE IN SERIOUS AND THE OTHERS
ARE FAIR OR GOOD.

SO THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

THAT'S REALLY GREAT NEWS.

HOW MANY MORE PATIENTS CAN YOU
RECEIVE?

HOW MUCH ARE YOU EQUIPPED TO
RECEIVE?

WELL, WE DO RUN THE BUSIEST
ER IN THE STATE, SO WE ARE
ACCUSTOMED TO HIGH VOLUME.

MAYBE NOT TO THE EMOTIONAL
EXTENT OF THIS TRAGEDY, BUT WITH
ONLY TEN CRITICAL AT THE MOMENT,
WE'RE CAPABLE OF HANDLING
ANYMORE.

GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT
YOU'RE HEARING AROUND TOWN.

ARE THERE AMBULANCES GOING OUT
ALL OVER TOWN, OR ARE YOU STILL
LOOKING FOR REINFORCEMENTS?

WHAT WE'VE HEARD IS THAT THE
ROADS ARE STILL IMPASSABLE IN
THAT AREA, SO IT'S TAKING A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TO
GET OUT OF THE AREA AND TO OUR
HOSPITAL.

THE AMBULANCES ARE SHOWING UP,
INSTEAD OF JUST ONE PATIENT AT A
TIME, THEY'RE BRINGING THREE AND
FOUR PATIENTS AT A TIME.

MANY PEOPLE ARE JUST ARRIVING BY
PRIVATE VEHICLE AS WELL.

AGAIN, WE THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR PHONING INTO US.

WE KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG
NIGHT.

CERTAINLY DIANE.

WE WISH ALL OF YOU THE BEST
AS YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU.

AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO BEEN
HEARING EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTIONS,
VIVID ONES, OF THE UTTER
DESTRUCTION ON THE GROUND.

EARLIER, MELISSA NEWTON SPOKE
ABOUT THE DEVASTATION SHE SAW
WHEN SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE HER
DOOR.

I LOOKED TO THE WEST AND I
SEE IT.

HAIL THE SIZE OF GOLF BALLS
POUNDING MY CAR AT THE TIME.

GOT HOME FAST AS POSSIBLE, GOT
OUR DOGS, AND GOT INTO THE
SHELTER, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
LATER, WE WERE HIT.

OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS COVERED IN
DEBRIS.

SHINGLES AND PIECES OF SHEET
ROOT AND WOOD IN OUR YARD AND
ALL ACROSS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

SOME HOMES COMPLETELY GONE.

IT'S DEVASTATING.

THERE ARE TWO BY FOURS GOING
THROUGH PEOPLE'S ROOFS LIKE
PROJECTILE OBJECTS.

HEARING THE STORM GOING OVER MY
HOUSE, WHICH ROARING, WHIRLING
SOUND, IT WAS SO LOUD.

OUR DOGS WERE DOWN ON THE GROUND
JUST SHAKING, BLESS THEIR
HEARTS.

IT WAS A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.

THANK GOD WE HAD A SHELTER.

AND SO MANY HAD SHELTERS.

NOW, I WANT TO CHECK BACK IN
WITH ABC'S METEOROLOGIST JINKER
ZEE FOR A MOMENT.

SHE'S ON THE GROUND IN MOORE,
OKLAHOMA.

GINGER, IN THESE MOMENTS, WHAT
ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW?

RIGHT AWAY, AT BRIARWOOD
ELEMENTARY, ONE OF THE SCHOOLS
HARDEST HIT.

WE MET ONE WOMAN LOOKING FOR HER
NIECE.

SHE STILL HADN'T FOUND HER.

SHE KNEW SHE WAS OKAY, BUT STILL
HADN'T BEEN RE-UNITED.

WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THOSE
TYPES OF STORIES.

ALSO AT THIS POINT I'M SEEING
THE WARREN THEATER, NOW WE'RE
SEEING SOME OF THE WALLS UP, BUT
JUST PEOPLE WALKING THE STREETS.

REFUGEES WITH SUITCASES OF ALL
TWHA HAVE LEFT, WHAT THEY'VE
BEEN ABLE TO GET BEFORE THE SUN
SETS HERE IN MOORE.

ARE YOU STILL SEEING PEOPLE
DIGGING THROUGH THEIR HOMES?

ABSOLUTELY.

THE WATER IS SPOUTING OUT OF THE
PLUMING AND THEY'RE STILL
DIGGING THROUGH TRYING TO FIND
THINGS BEFORE THE SUN SETS.

ONE WOMAN TOLD US, WE JUST WANT
TO FIND OUR OWN THINGS BEFORE
SOMEBODY ELSE DOES.

AND INITIALLY, WE SAW ALL
THOSE FIRES BURNING, HAVE THEY
GONE OUT?

WE STILL SEE SOME PLUMES OF
SMOKE.

I SAW A COUPLE BEFORE ME MOVED
TO A DIFFERENT AREA.

SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S OVER
WITH YET.

THE SMELL OF GAS IS PERMEATING
STILL.

IT'S ALMOST SICKENING WHEN
YOU'RE STANDING THERE.

AND OF COURSE SO DANGEROUS.

THANK YOU, GINGER AND I KNOW
YOU'RE STANDING BY FOR THE REST
OF THE BROADCAST.

I WANT TO TURN TO ABC'S SAM
CHAMPION 26 MILES AWAY FROM LAKE
THUNDERBIRD, OKLAHOMA.

TELL US MORE ABOUT THIS MASSIVE
TELL YOU, THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE
SIGHT.

THIS IS THE THIRD DAY THAT
VIOLENT STORMS HAVE BEEN IN THIS
AREA.

AND THE THIRD DAY SEEMED TO HAVE
DROPPED THE WORST TORNADO OF
THEM ALL.

WE'LL HAVE PICTURES FROM STORM
CHASER VIDEOS.

THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS
THIS STORM RIGHT NOW ON A
PRELIMINARY CATEGORY HERE AS AN
EF-4, THIS IS RARIFIED TERRITORY
FOR TORNADOES.

THERE ARE SOME REPORTS IT WAS ON
THE GROUND FOR 40 MINUTES,
COVERING 12 MILES IN THAT TIME.

THERE ARE SOME REPORTS THAT SAY
ON THE GROUND, THIS TORNADO WAS
ABOUT TWO MILES WIDE.

AND WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL WE CAN
GET IN AND LOOK AT THE DEBRIS
FIELD THERE.

YOU CAN SEE THE TORNADO FILLING
THE SKY.

ANOTHER AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS
TORNADO IS ON THE RADAR, WHEN IT
FIRST POPPED OUT IN NEWCASTLE,
BY THE WAY, THIS IS BEING CALLED
THE NEWCASTLE-MOORE TORNADO, BUT
WHEN IT DROPPED DOWN, IT WAS
JUST A FINGER OF A TORNADO,
BARELY A FUNNEL CLOUD.

WITHIN AN HOUR, IT WAS A MONSTER
STORM DEVELOPING JUST ABOUT AS
QUICKLY AS ALL THE DETAILS HAVE
TOLD US THE JOPLIN STORM
DEVELOPED.

THIS STORM HAS BEEN COVERED WITH
STORM CHASERS AND LOCAL
TELEVISION FROM START TO FINISH.

RUBBLE.

'RE LOOKING A THE
THE UNBELIEVABLE DEBRIS FIELD.

YOU HEARD GINGER IN THE FIELD
WALKING AROUND THERE AND WE
HEARD REPORTS THAT SOME OF THE
FOUNDATIONS WERE COMPLETELY
CLEARED.

THAT PUTS IT DEFINITELY IN THAT
EF-4 AND MAYBE EVEN HIGHER
CATEGORY, THE STORM THAT'S
CAPABLE OF TAKING A FOUNDATION
AND CLEARING IT OF DEBRIS, AS
THE STORM LEAVES THE AREA.

SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN SWEPT
ALREADY BY A BIG TRACTOR.

BUT IT HASN'T BEEN YET.

IT WAS JUST THE STORM THAT DID
THAT DAMAGE.

AND IN OTHER AREAS, BUILDINGS
JUST SHATTERED.

THEN YOU LOOK AT MAJOR
CONSTRUCTION.

YOU SEE MAJOR CEMENT
CONSTRUCTION ALSO BEING DAMAGED.

THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL AND THE
SIGNATURE OF A VERY LARGE AND
VERY POWERFUL TORNADO.

FOLKS HAVE BEEN DIGGING THROUGH
THE DEBRIS AND LIFTING UP THESE
HEAVY PIECES OF DEBRIS, WHETHER
IT'S WALL BOARD OR SIDING OR
ROOFING, TWISTED METAL, TRYING
TO FIND ANYONE WHO MIGHT STILL
BE IN THE RUBBLE.

ALL OF THIS IS GOING ON, BECAUSE
THIS IS STILL A VERY LARGE AREA.

FROM THE SKY, YOU CAN SEE IT'S
HOUSE AFTER HOUSE AFTER HOUSE IN
NEIGHBORHOODS.

THIS IS A GROWING NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT'S JUST SOUTH OF OKLAHOMA
CITY.

VERY LARGE AREA OF HOMES, VERY
LARGE RESIDENTIAL AREA, WITH
LOTS OF HOMES.

AND IT'S HOMES, BUSINESSES,
HOSPITALS, ALL JUST TAKEN OUT BY
THIS ONE STORM.

SOMETHING THAT I GOT TO TELL
YOU, I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

AND I DON'T LIKE TO COMPARE
STORMS TOO MUCH.

BUT SOMETIMES YOU LOOK AT THE
DAMAGE AND YOU SEE IT AND IT
REMINDS YOU OF ANOTHER STORM AND
THIS STORM IS REMINDING US A LOT
OF JOPLIN AND THAT'S NOT A GOOD
THING.

THANK YOU AGAIN, SAM.

JUST REMINDS US HOW IMPORTANT
THE WARNING SYSTEM IS AGAIN.

THERE WERE 20 OR 30 MINUTES FOR
EVERYONE TO GET TO SOME KIND OF
SHELTER.

STILL AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS," WE
HAVE MORE STORIES FROM THE STORM
ZONE, INCLUDING THE INCREDIBLE
ONE OF A FATHER AND SON
RE-UNITED TONIGHT.

 THEY ARE STUNNING PICTURES
AND STUNNING STORIES FROM THE
FAMILIES ON THE GROUND THERE IN
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

AND ONE A FATHER, HIS SON
GABRIEL WAS IN SCHOOL, RODE OUT
THE STORM INSIDE ONE OF THE
SCHOOLS THAT TOOK A DIRECT HIT.

AND HOURS AGO FATHER AND SON
WERE REUNITED, HERE'S THEIR
STORY IN THEIR OWN WORDS.

THIS IS GABRIEL AND RYAN
WHEELER.

HE'S MY SON.

AND 30 MINUTES AGO YOU DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE HE WAS?

DID NOT KNOW WHERE HE WAS.

I JUST RUSHED HOME, WE JUST GOT
REUNITED, BUT HE'S OKAY.

HE WAS DIRECTLY IN THE TORNADO.

HIS TEACHER WAS RIGHT NEXT TO
HIM.

MISS SIMON HAD THE KIDS IN ONE
HALLWAY, AND SHE SAID THAT IT
SOUNDED LIKE A TRAIN COMING.

SO SHE SAID THAT THEY HAD TO
MOVE, SO THEY WENT INTO AN
INTERIOR CLOSET.

THERE WAS ONLY SIX KIDS.

THEY GOT DOWN.

THEY WERE TELLING STORIES AND
APPARENTLY THEY GOT INTO
POSITION, AND THE TEACHER HELD
THEIR HEADS, AND BRICKS AND
EVERYTHING WERE FALLING ALL OVER
THE KIDS.

SHE GOT HER ARM INJURED.

ONE OF THE BOYS GOT A BIG GASH
IN HIS HEAD BUT HE'S OKAY.

AND HE WAS THE LAST ONE TO BE
REUNITED WITH A FAMILY MEMBER,
SO WE'VE GOT HIM.

SHE SAID HE WAS HELPING PEOPLE,
PULLING STUFF OFF OF KIDS.

WE'RE JUST GLAD THAT HE'S SAFE.

I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY, WE WERE
GETTING SLAMMED WITH HAIL AND
RAIN AGAIN.

AND ALL I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS
MY SON.

ALL THE REPORTS WERE SAYING THAT
BRIARWOOD WAS GOING.

SO THAT'S ALL -- IT DIDN'T
MATTER.

I FELT THEM AND IT WAS
RAINING ON ME AND ALL THAT.

CAN YOU TELL ME, IN THAT
CLOSET, WHAT WAS YOUR TEACHER
TELLING YOU AS SHE PUT HER HANDS
OVER YOUR HEAD AND HELD YOU
CLOSE?

SHE SAID IT WAS JUST OKAY.

FOR ONE FAMILY, SUCH GREAT
NEWS TONIGHT.

AND COMING UP NEXT HERE,
OTHER FAMILIES SENDING A MESSAGE
TO THE WORLD FROM THE STORM
ZONE, HOW ONE WOMAN COMFORTED A
LOT OF SMALL CHILDREN AS THE
TORNADO WAS BEARING DOWN.

 MORE FACES FROM THE STORM.

AND TONIGHT WE ARE HEARING FROM
ONE WOMAN WHO'S A RESIDENT OF
MOORE, OKLAHOMA.

SHE WORKS AT A DAYCARE CENTER,
AND WHEN THE STORM HIT, IT WAS
UP TO HER TO KEEP SMALL CHILDREN
CALM AND SAFE, AND HERE'S WHAT
SHE TOLD US.

WE KNEW THE STORMS WERE
COMING.

WE HAD THE NEWS ON AND WE HAD
THE RADIO ON, AND MY PHONE
STARTED GOING OFF, LETTING US
KNOW THERE WAS AN ALERT.

THE SIREN.

WE LINE OUR KIDS UP, STRAIGHT
INTO THE INNER MOST BATHROOM AND
PUT MATS ON TOP OF ALL OF US,
HUDDLED TOGETHER UNTIL IT WAS
OVER.

YOU SING AND YOU READ TO MAKE
THEM NOT CRY OR BE SCARED OR
UPSET ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT STREET WAS
TURNING ON TO WALK TO MY HOUSE.

HOUSES EVERYWHERE JUST
FLATTENED.

YOU SEE PEOPLE JUST SITTING
AROUND WITH THEIR STUFF THAT'S
DESTROYED.

I FEEL HORRIBLE FOR EVERYBODY
THAT THEIR HOUSES ARE GONE.

AND I WAS AT WORK, SO I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

I KNOW WALKING AROUND AND SEEING
EVERYBODY, IT'S PRETTY TOUGH.

AND I'M REALLY SCARED TO SEE
WHAT MY HOUSE LOOKS LIKE.

QUITE A TEACHER, QUITE A
WOMAN.

AND COMING UP, WE HAVE THE
VERY LATEST ON THIS BREAKING
STORY.

NEW TORNADO WARNINGS RIGHT NOW,
AND FINAL THOUGHTS FROM THE
STORM ZONE.

A DEVASTATING SCENE IN
OKLAHOMA.

BREAKING NEWS, DEDETAILS ON
THE MASSIVE PATH OF
DESTRUCTION.
