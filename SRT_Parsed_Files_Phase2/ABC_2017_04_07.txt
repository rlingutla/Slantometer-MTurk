TONIGHT, BREAKING NEWS.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND POSSIBLE
MILITARY ACTION AGAINST SYRIA.

THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYING,
"SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN" AFTER
THE CHEMICAL ATTACK IN SYRIA.

THIS EVENING, THE PRESIDENT AND
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT NOW
WEIGHING OPTIONS AFTER TRUMP
REPEATEDLY SAID BEFORE THAT THE
U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED IN
SYRIA.

MARTHA RADDATZ, JON KARL, AND
BRIAN ROSS STANDING BY.

ALSO TONIGHT, THE SUDDEN
MOVE TO STEP ASIDE.

THE REPUBLICAN LEADING THE HOUSE
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
MEDDLING AND ANY POSSIBLE
COLLUSION, NOW RECUSING HIMSELF.

DID YOU DISCLOSE ANY
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?

WHAT NEXT IN THE
INVESTIGATION?

IN THE SENATE TONIGHT, THE
SHOWDOWN OVER THE SUPREME COURT.

REPUBLICAN SENATORS CHANGING THE
RULES, USING THE SO-CALLED
"NUCLEAR" OPTION, SET TO PUSH
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PICK THROUGH.

SEVERE STORMS AS WE COME ON
THE AIR TONIGHT.

AT LEAST 13 REPORTED TORNADOES
ALREADY.

50 MILLION AMERICANS BRACING FOR
DANGEROUS STORMS TONIGHT.

AND REMEMBERING AN AMERICAN
GREAT.

TONIGHT, WE CELEBRATE THE LIFE
OF DON RICKLES.

GOOD EVENING.

AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH
US HERE ON A THURSDAY NIGHT.

AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH
FAST-MOVING DEVELOPMENTS ON
SYRIA.

JUST 24 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID HIS MIND HAD BEEN
CHANGED ON SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL
ASSAD.

TODAY HE SIGNALED HE'S WEIGHING
MILITARY ACTION.

SAYING IN HIS WORDS, SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

IT COMES AFTER THE IMAGES OF
THAT HORRIFIC CHEMICAL ATTACK.

DOZENS KILLED BY WHAT TURKISH
OFFICIALS NOW SAY WAS SARIN GAS.

CHILDREN AND BABIES AMONG THE
VICTIMS.

THE SURVIVORS SPRAYED DOWN.

MANY OF THE VICTIMS STRUGGLING
TO BREATHE.

TONIGHT, WE KNOW THAT THE
DEFENSE SECRETARY IS NOW
BRIEFING THE PRESIDENT ON THE
OPTIONS.

WHAT ARE THEY?

AND HOW SOON COULD THIS COME?

ABC'S CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS
CORRESPONDENT MARTHA RADDATZ
LEADING US OFF.

TRUMP, WITH HIS STRONGEST WORDS
YET ON THE CRISIS IN SYRIA.

AS THIS PRESIDENT, NOW 77 DAYS
INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, DECIDES
WHETHER TO TAKE MILITARY ACTION.

I THINK WHAT ASSAD DID IS
TERRIBLE.

I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN SYRIA
IS ONE OF THE TRULY EGREGIOUS
CRIMES.

AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO
HAPPEN.

HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED?

AT SOME POINT I MAY.

I HAVEN'T, BUT AT SOME POINT I
MAY.

DO YOU THINK THAT ASSAD
SHOULD LEAVE POWER IN SYRIA?

I THINK WHAT HAPPENED IN
SYRIA IS A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.

AND HE'S THERE AND I GUESS HE'S
RUNNING THINGS, SO SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN.

SECRETARY OF STATE, REX
TILLERSON, A MAN OF FEW WORDS
SINCE TAKING OFFICE, TONIGHT
WITH HIS STRONGEST SIGNAL YET,
FOCUSING ON SYRIA'S PRESIDENT.

SIR, DOES ASSAD HAVE TO GO?

ASSAD'S ROLE IN THE FUTURE IS
UNCERTAIN CLEARLY, AND WITH THE
ACTS HE HAS TAKEN, IT WOULD SEEM
THERE IS NO ROLE FOR HIM TO
GOVERN THE SYRIAN PEOPLE.

WILL YOU AND PRESIDENT TRUMP
ORGANIZE AN INTERNATIONAL
COALITION TO REMOVE ASSAD?

THOSE STEPS ARE UNDER WAY.

WEEK AGO, THE SECRETARY OF STATE
SUGGESTED SOMETHING FAR
DIFFERENT, SAYING THE SYRIAN
PEOPLE SHOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO
GET RID OF ASSAD.

THIS SHIFT COMES JUST 24 HOURS
AFTER THE PRESIDENT, WITH THE
WORLD WATCHING, SAID THOSE
IMAGES OF CHILDREN GASSED HAD
CHANGED HIS MIND.

I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S ALREADY
HAPPENED THAT MY ATTITUDE TOWARD
SYRIA AND ASSAD HAS CHANGED VERY
MUCH.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER,
BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE TELLING YOU.

PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP HAD LONG
ARGUED AGAINST ACTION IN SYRIA,
REPEATEDLY TWEETING ABOUT IT.

BACK IN 2013, AFTER A CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACK, WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA WAS WEIGHING MILITARY
ACTION, TRUMP TWEETING, "DO NOT
ATTACK SYRIA.

IF YOU DO, MANY BAD THINGS WILL
HAPPEN.

AND FROM THAT FIGHT, THE U.S.
GETS NOTHING!"

TONIGHT, HE IS SIGNALING HIS
STANCE HAS CHANGED.

AND THE RUSSIANS, WHO HAVE BEEN
SUPPORTING SYRIAN LEADER BASHAR
AL ASSAD, SAID TODAY SUPPORT FOR
ASSAD NOT UNCONDITIONAL, BUT
URGING CAUTION.

ON CAPITOL HILL, A LEADING
REPUBLICAN SAID THIS IS A TEST
FOR TRUMP.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO MAKE A
DECISION THAT'S GOING TO DEFINE
HIS PRESIDENCY ONE WAY OR THE
OTHER.

IF HE DOES NOTHING, THEN IT'S
GOING TO BE OBAMA ON STEROIDS.

HASN'T SAID WHAT HE WOULD DO IN
SYRIA, BUT THERE ARE MANY
MILITARY OPTIONS.

HIT SYRIAN AIRFIELDS TO GROUND
ASSAD'S AIR FORCE.

GO AFTER MILITARY TARGETS SUCH
AS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.

WHAT COULD WE USE?

SEA-BASED CRUISE MISSILES OR
U.S.-MANNED AIRCRAFT.

RISKIER BUT WE HAVE HIGHLY
SOPHISTICATED WARPLANES.

AND MARTHA JOINS ME NOW.

MARTHA WE KNOW
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEFENSE
SECRETARY ARE NOW TOGETHER.

HE'S BEING BRIEFED ON THE
POTENTIAL OPTIONS.

WE LEARNED THAT THE AIRCRAFT
THAT DROPPED THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WAS IN FACT A SYRIAN
MILITARY AIRCRAFT.

THEY SAY THERE'S NO QUESTION
IT WAS A SYRIAN MILITARY
AIRCRAFT.

WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE EQUIPMENT
THERE OVER SYRIA NOW THEY COULD
ACTUALLY WATCH, GO BACK AND SEE
WHAT KIND OF AIRCRAFT DROPPED
THOSE MUNITIONS.

WE HAVE MORE EQUIPMENT THERE.

MARTHA, AS YOU BEEN REPORTING WE
HAVE MORE AMERICAN TROOPS THERE
IN RECENT WEEKS, WE LEARNED OF
HUNDREDS BEING SENT INTO SYRIA.

WE DO, DAVID, AND THAT'S A
REAL CONCERN.

IF MILITARY ACTION IS TAKEN
THERE WILL BE A WARNING TO
ASSAD -- DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR
THOSE AMERICAN TROOPS, DO NOT
TARGET THEM, BUT THERE'S A RISK.

MARTHA, THANK YOU.

AND AS YOU HEARD MARTHA
REPORT, ANY ACTION IF TAKEN
COMES WITH GREAT RISK.

OBAMA WEIGHED MILITARY ACTION
BEFORE.

NOW, RUSSIANS ARE INVOLVED AND
AMERICAN TROOPS ARE THERE.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE TARGET?

AND WHAT ARE THE GREATEST RISKS?

HERE'S BRIAN ROSS.

MILITARY TONIGHT, AMONG THE
OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED ARE THE
VERY PLANS THE PENTAGON PLANNED
FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN A PRIME
TARGET WAS THE SPECIFIC MILITARY
UNIT THAT GUARDED AND DEPLOYED
SYRIA'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

UNIT 450, OF THE SYRIAN AIR
FORCE.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO STRIKE IN
A WAY THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED
TO CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE, YOU'D
HAVE TO HIT SOME PART OF UNIT
450.

THIS WEEK FROM SYRIA PUT A LIE
TO THE SYRIAN AND USA CLAIMS
THAT THE COUNTRY'S STOCKPILE OF
SARIN GAS AND OTHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS HAD BEEN DESTROYED.

BUT EVEN WITH A DIMINISHED
SUPPLY, A DIRECT STRIKE ON
WHATEVER CHEMICAL WEAPONS REMAIN
STILL RUNS A SERIOUS RISK.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO HIT THEM,
IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRY TO BLOW
THEM UP, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GOING
TO CREATE AGENT PLUMES, WHICH
ARE GOING TO DAMAGE, YOU KNOW,
CIVILIAN AREAS.

PLAN IN 2013 INCLUDED SYRIAN
AIRFIELDS, TANK DEPOTS AND EVEN
THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE IN
DOWNTOWN DAMASCUS.

THEY CAN GO RIGHT THROUGH A
TEN-FOOT BLOCK OF THAT BUILDING,
SO RIGHT INTO A PARTICULAR
OFFICE.

COULD BE LESS SWEEPING BECAUSE
OF THE PRESENCE OF RUSSIAN
SOLDIERS AND ADVISERS ACROSS
SYRIAN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

ALONG WITH ADVANCED RUSSIAN
ANTI-AIRCRAFT DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

LET'S BRING IN BRIAN ROSS.

BRIAN, WE SHOULD CAUTION, WE
DON'T KNOW ANY ACTION IF ANY AT
ALL IS GOING TO BE TAKEN
TONIGHT.

BUT WE HEARD THOSE WORDS JUST 24
HOURS AGO FROM THE U.S.

AMBASSADOR, NIKKI HALEY ASKING
HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE TO
DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?

THOSE WERE STRONG WORDS.

AIMED AT RUSSIA, VLADIMIR PUTIN.

WE HAVEN'T HEARD PRESIDENT TRUMP
ADDRESS PUTIN IN THAT WAY.

IS THAT A TEST OF THAT
RELATIONSHIP TOO?

IN FACT, THE WORLD IS
WATCHING TO SEE IF THE PRESIDENT
IS NOW PREPARED TO CHALLENGE
RUSSIA AND ITS LEADER WHO HE HAS
PRAISED SO MUCH, VLADIMIR PUTIN.

BRIAN, THANK YOU.

AND AS WE KNOW,
SYRIA IS NOT THE ONLY FOREIGN
CRISIS TESTING PRESIDENT TRUMP
TONIGHT.

HIS HIGH-STAKES MEETINGS NOW
WITH CHINA'S PRESIDENT ARRIVING
AT MAR-A-LAGO.

PRESIDENT TRUMP EXPECTED TO TALK
ABOUT NORTH KOREA WITH HIM.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVING JUST
SAID THAT, IF CHINA DOESN'T FIX
THE NORTH KOREAN ISSUE, THE U.S.
WILL.

ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL IN
FLORIDA TONIGHT.

OPTIONS ON SYRIA, TODAY, WITH A
MASSIVE STORM HITTING
WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT TRUMP FLEW
TO MAR-A-LAGO TO FACE ANOTHER
CRISIS, NORTH KOREA'S ADVANCING
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

AND TONIGHT, HIS MOST IMPORTANT
FOREIGN MEETING YET, GREETING
THE LEADER OF THE COUNTRY HE'S
PREVIOUSLY CALLED OUR ENEMY,
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING
ABOUT BOTH TRADE, NORTH KOREA
AND MANY OTHER THINGS.

CAMPAIGN, TRUMP HAD HARSH WORDS
FOR CHINA.

WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO ALLOW
CHINA TO RAPE OUR COUNTRY AND
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

THEY'RE TAKING OUR BUSINESS.

THEY'RE TAKING OUR JOBS.

THEY'RE MAKING OUR PRODUCT.

CHINA'S WONDERFUL, BUT THEY'RE
GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER.

CHINA TO TURN UP THE HEAT ON
NORTH KOREA.

JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO TWEETING,
"NORTH KOREA IS BEHAVING VERY
BADLY.

CHINA HAS DONE LITTLE TO HELP!"

AND AS HE FACES THESE
HIGH-STAKES INTERNATIONAL
CHALLENGES, MORE DETAILS ABOUT
THAT WHITE HOUSE SHAKE-UP
INVOLVING THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF
STRATEGIST, STEVE BANNON.

A HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE,
BANNON WAS DUBBED "THE GREAT
MANIPULATOR" BY "TIME" MAGAZINE.

BUT ACCORDING TO WHITE HOUSE
SOURCES, HE HAS RECENTLY CLASHED
WITH JARED KUSHNER, THE
PRESIDENT'S SON-IN-LAW.

AND YESTERDAY, HE WAS REMOVED
FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL.

WHILE WHITE HOUSE SOURCES TELL
US HE THREATENED TO QUIT THE
ADMINISTRATION OVER THE MOVE,
BANNON HIMSELF TELLS ABC NEWS
THAT'S NOT TRUE, CALLING IT
ABSURD.

I THINK WE HAVE SHAKEN THINGS
UP, BUT I THINK WE'VE HAD ONE OF
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL 13 WEEKS IN
THE HISTORY OF THE PRESIDENCY.

GREATER THAN THE ONES HE HAS
FACED SO FAR.

LET'S BRING IN JON KARL.

LIVE IN WEST PALM BEACH.

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHINA'S
PRESIDENT XI SITTING DOWN
TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME.

WE ALL REMEMBER, AS YOU REPORTED
THERE, THE PRESIDENT'S ATTACKS
ON CHINA DURING THE CAMPAIGN AT
ONE POINT CALLING THEM OUR
ENEMY.

BUT THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY
THINKS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY
HERE?

THEY DO.

THEY EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE
AGREEMENTS COMING OUT OF THIS
THAT WILL MEAN CHINESE
INVESTMENT AND AMERICAN JOBS
AND, REGARDING NORTH KOREA THE
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID TODAY,
QUOTE, I THINK CHINA WILL BE
STEPPING UP.

DAVID.

A LOT ON THE AGENDA THERE IN
FLORIDA.

JON KARL, THANKS TO YOU.

MEANTIME ON CAPITOL HILL,
TONIGHT, THE SUDDEN MOVE TO STEP
ASIDE.

THE REPUBLICAN LEADING THE HOUSE
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
MEDDLING AND POSSIBLE COLLUSION
IS NOW RECUSING HIMSELF.

OUR CORRESPONDENT FINDING HIM AS
HE LEFT THE CAPITOL HILL.

HERE'S ABC'S CECILIA VEGA.

TODAY, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES
RUSHING TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

CONGRESSMAN?

AFTER RECUSING HIMSELF FROM THE
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BECAUSE HE
IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF A HOUSE
ETHICS PROBE.

DID YOU DISCLOSE ANY
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION?

I ISSUED A STATEMENT, AND YOU
GUYS HAVE IT, SO.

WHY DID YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND
THOUGH?

YOU HAD SAID THIS WAS ALL
POLITICS?

I SENT OUT A STATEMENT AND
THAT'S MY -- MY STATEMENT WILL
STAND.

BUT YOUR RESPONSE TO THE
COMPLAINT SPECIFICALLY.

DID YOU DISCLOSE ANY CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION?

I TOLD YOU I SENT OUT A
STATEMENT AND MY STATEMENT WILL
STAND.

COMMITTEE RELEASING FEW DETAILS,
SAYING ONLY THAT THE COMMITTEE
IS AWARE OF PUBLIC ALLEGATIONS
THAT REPRESENTATIVE DEVIN NUNES
MAY HAVE MADE UNAUTHORIZED
DISCLOSURES OF CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION.

NUNES BLAMING SEVERAL LEFT-WING
ACTIVIST GROUPS, ADDING, "THE
CHARGES ARE ENTIRELY FALSE AND
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED."

THE CONGRESSMAN HAS BEEN UNDER
FIRE FOR WEEKS.

A MEMBER OF THE PRESIDENT'S
TRANSITION TEAM, NUNES ACCUSED
OF BEING TOO CLOSE TO THE WHITE
HOUSE TO CONDUCT AN IMPARTIAL
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIAN
MEDDLING IN THE ELECTION AND
POSSIBLE COLLUSION, ESPECIALLY
AFTER HE CLAIMED TO HAVE
EVIDENCE THAT MEMBERS OF TEAM
TRUMP WERE PICKED UP IN
INCIDENTAL SURVEILLANCE, AND HE
RUSHED TO THE WHITE HOUSE TO
BRIEF THE PRESIDENT.

WHAT I'VE READ BOTHERS ME,
AND I THINK IT SHOULD BOTHER THE
PRESIDENT HIMSELF AND HIS TEAM.

LATER, IT WAS REVEALED THAT VERY
INTELLIGENCE NUNES SHARED WITH
THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVEN TO HIM
BY WHITE HOUSE AIDES.

TODAY, THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON THE
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE,
APPLAUDING NUNES FOR RECUSING
HIMSELF.

IS THIS ENOUGH TO PUT YOUR
INVESTIGATION BACK ON TRACK IN
TERMS OF PUBLIC PERCEPTION?

I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

IT SHOULD BE.

CECILIA VEGA WITH US NOW LIVE
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

NOW THAT CONGRESSMAN NUNES HAS
RECUSED HIMSELF, WHO WILL BE
HEADING UP THE HOUSE
INVESTIGATION INTO RUSSIA.

DAVID, THAT JOB GOES TO TEXAS
CONGRESSMAN MICHAEL CONAWAY.

HE'S NOW PROMISING TO CONDUCT A
BIPARTISAN INVESTIGATION.

ALSO HELPING THEM THOUGH TREY
GOWDY, THE PERSON WHO CHAIRED
THAT SELECT COMMITTEE
INVESTIGATING BENGHAZI.

DAVID.

CECILIA VEGA BACK AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.

AFTER THAT MOMENT ON CAPITOL
HILL.

THANK YOU, CECILIA.

NOW TO THE SHOWDOWN OVER THE
SUPREME COURT TONIGHT AND TO
THAT HISTORIC MOVE IN THE
SENATE.

REPUBLICANS TRIGGERING THE
THE REPUBLICANS TRIGGERING THE
SO-CALLED NUCLEAR OPTION, THAT
SETS UP A VOTE TOMORROW.

NOW TO CONFIRM SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE NEIL GORSUCH BY A SIMPLE
MAJORITY.

THE REPUBLICANS WON'T NEED ANY
VOTES FROM DEMOCRATS.

ABC'S MARY BRUCE TONIGHT ON THE
FALLOUT.

PARTISAN BATTLEFIELD WITH A
THUMBS UP.

THE TOP DEMOCRAT, HIS HEAD HUNG
LOW IN DEFEAT.

LEFT BEHIND, THE CASUALTIES, A
SENATE AND A SUPREME COURT
FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED.

ARE 52.

BLOCKING THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE
NEIL GORSUCH, REPUBLICANS MAKING
A CONTROVERSIAL PLAY, CHANGING
THE SENATE RULES TO CONFIRM
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES FROM NOW
ON WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE,
LOWERING THE THRESHOLD FROM 60
VOTES TO JUST 51.

A MOVE SO DRASTIC IT'S KNOWN AS
THE "NUCLEAR OPTION."

FOR TWO DAYS, DEMOCRATS PUT UP A
FIGHT ON THE FLOOR, ONE SENATOR
TALKING FOR 15 HOURS STRAIGHT.

THIS IS AN EXTREME NOMINEE
FROM THE FAR RIGHT.

HAD THE VOTES TO BLOCK GORSUCH,
BUT REPUBLICANS WERE PREPARED TO
GO NUCLEAR.

CERTAINLY, I THINK THIS STEP
IS WORTH IT.

HESITANT, WARNING THE MOVE COULD
HAVE LASTING CONSEQUENCES ON THE
COURT.

IT'S A BAD DAY FOR THE
SENATE.

IT MEANS YOU WILL PROBABLY GET
MORE IDEOLOGICAL JUDGES, BUT WE
ARE WHO WE ARE.

IF YOU HAVE THESE
RESERVATIONS, WHY DO IT?

WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A
SYSTEM WHERE REPUBLICANS CAN'T
GET JUDGES AND DEMOCRATS CAN.

BUT MANY DEMOCRATS ARE STILL
FUMING, AFTER REPUBLICANS
REFUSED TO EVEN CONSIDER
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINEE TO
FILL THIS SEAT, MERRICK GARLAND.

IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS
REPUBLICANS WHO SUPPORTED IT,
WARNED OF THE FALLOUT.

IT MAKES THINGS MORE
DIFFICULT IN AN
ALREADY-DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT.

THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE
TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY.

SO LET'S BRING MARY BRUCE
LIVE FROM CAPITOL HILL TONIGHT.

THIS NOW PAVES THE WAY FOR A
FINAL VOTE ON NEIL GORSUCH
TOMORROW.

DAVID, NOW THAT THE PATH IS
CLEAR THE SENATE IS IN ITS FINAL
ROUND OF DEBATE.

DEMOCRATS ARE STILL SPEAKING OUT
ON THE FLOOR, BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

THE SENATE IS EXPECTED TO VOTE
AND CONFIRM NEIL GORSUCH
TOMORROW.

DAVID.
