TONIGHT, THE WORLD WATCHING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

THE PRESIDENT DECLARES SYRIA HAS
CROSSED MORE THAN A RED LINE,
THAT ASSAD HAS CROSSED SEVERAL
LINES.

ON THE WORLD STAGE, THE
PRESIDENT SAYS HIS POSITION ON
ASSAD, ON SYRIA, HAS CHANGED
AFTER SEEING THE IMAGES OF THE
FAMILIES, THE CHILDREN, THE
VICTIMS OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK.

WILL THE U.S. TAKE ACTION?

MARTHA RADDATZ STANDING BY.

ALSO TONIGHT, THE SHAKEUP.

THE PRESIDENT'S TOP STRATEGIST
STEVE BANNON REMOVED FROM HIS
POST ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.

AT THIS HOUR, WE'RE ALSO
WATCHING THE SEVERE STORMS, THE
TORNADO WATCHES AND WARNINGS
ACROSS SEVERAL STATES.

60 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE
PATH.

THE FLOOD WATCHES RIGHT INTO THE
NORTHEAST.

THE F-16 CRASH.

HOW THE PILOT BARELY AVOIDED A
SUBURBAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

AND TONIGHT, FOUR DOZEN
ADVERTISERS HAVE NOW PULLED
THEIR ADS FROM "THE O'REILLY
FACTOR."

AS PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDS THE
FOX HOST BILL O'REILLY.

GOOD EVENING.

IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US
ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH PRESIDENT
TRUMP IN FRONT OF THE WORLD ON
SYRIA, ON BASHAR AL ASSAD, ON
THE APPARENT CHEMICAL ATTACK
THAT KILLED SO MANY FAMILIES AND
CHILDREN.

THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNING THE
ATTACK, CALLING IT QUOTE, AN
AFFRONT TO HUMANITY.

SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

THE GRAPHIC IMAGES SEEN AROUND
THE WORLD.

MORE THAN 80 MEN, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN DYING.

THOSE WHO DID SURVIVE GASPING
FOR AIR.

WHAT THE WORLD WAS WAITING FOR
NEXT, WAS WORD FROM PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

HOW HE'LL HANDLE THIS, WILL THE
U.S. ACT?

TONIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR WHAT HE
SAID.

ABC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN KARL
LEADING US OFF.

THE PRESIDENT FIRMLY CONDEMNED
THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN
SYRIA, PLACING THE BLAMING
-- BLAME SQUARELY ON THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT.

IT IS A TERRIBLE AFFRONT TO
HUMANITY, I CAN TELL YOU.

TERRIBLE.

JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE
ROSE GARDEN, HE SUGGESTED THERE
SHOULD BE RETALIATION.

THESE HEINOUS ACTIONS BY THE
ASSAD REGIME CANNOT BE
TOLERATED.

AND AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP SAID THE
U.S. SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED.

TWEETING "SYRIA IS NOT OUR
PROBLEM" WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
PROPOSED PROTECTING CIVILIANS.

AND AFTER ASSAD'S MASSIVE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK IN 2013,
HE TWEETED "DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA,
FIX U.S.A."
ADDING, "IF YOU DO MANY BAD
THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT
FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!"

BUT NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAYS
THESE HORRIFIC IMAGES HAVE
CHANGED HIS VIEWS ON THE ASSAD
REGIME.

INNOCENT CIVILIANS SUFFERING
FROM THIS WEEK'S ATTACK, MORE
THAN 80 DEAD.

HERE A FATHER CLUTCHES HIS TWIN
9-MONTH-OLD BABIES, BOTH OF THEM
KILLED.

TODAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE, TALK
OF A CHANGED SYRIAN POLICY.

I DO CHANGE.

AND I AM FLEXIBLE.

AND I'M PROUD OF THAT
FLEXIBILITY.

AND I WILL TELL YOU, THAT ATTACK
ON CHILDREN YESTERDAY, HAD A BIG
IMPACT ON ME.

BIG IMPACT.

AND IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE,
AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT'S
ALREADY HAPPENED, THAT MY
ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA AND ASSAD
HAS CHANGED VERY MUCH.

PRESIDENT OBAMA FOR THE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS BUT
ACKNOWLEDGES IT'S NOW HIS
CHALLENGE TO SOLVE.

I NOW HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND
I WILL HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY
AND CARRY IT VERY PROUDLY, I
WILL TELL YOU THAT.

IT IS NOW MY RESPONSIBILITY.

IF I COULD JUST QUICKLY ASK
YOU IF THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS
CROSSES A RED LINE FOR YOU?

IT CROSSED A LOT OF LINES FOR
ME.

WHEN YOU KILL INNOCENT CHILDREN,
INNOCENT BABIES -- BABIES,
LITTLE BABIES -- WITH A CHEMICAL
GAS THAT IS SO LETHAL.

PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR WHAT
GAS IT WAS, THAT CROSSES MANY,
MANY LINES, BEYOND A RED LINE.

MANY, MANY LINES.

WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS I
THINK YOU'VE NOTICED ABOUT ME IS
MILITARILY, I DON'T LIKE TO SAY
WHERE I'M GOING AND WHAT I'M
DOING.

I'M NOT SAYING I'M DOING
ANYTHING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO
BE TELLING YOU.

ABDULLAH MADE IT CLEAR, THE
WORLD IS LOOKING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

I BELIEVE UNDER YOUR
LEADERSHIP WE WILL BE ABLE TO
UNRAVEL THIS VERY COMPLICATED
SITUATION.

PREDECESSOR, IS PROMISING TO
TAKE ACTION.

THE WORLD IS A MESS.

I INHERITED A MESS.

WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.

WE'RE GOING TO FIX IT.

AND JON KARL WITH US TONIGHT
LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR HE
WON'T SAY WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

BUT DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF TIME
LINE FOR POSSIBLE ACTION HERE?

WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY
THIS IS VERY HIGH ON THE AGENDA.

IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF
CHAIRED A MEETING OF HIS
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL TODAY
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE
CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK.

BUT, DAVID, NO TIME LINE YET FOR
A RESPONSE.

ALL RIGHT, JON KARL LEADING
US OFF.

JON, THANK YOU.

WE JUST HEARD PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAYING THAT SYRIA CROSSED
NOT ONLY A RED LINE, BUT SEVERAL
LINES.

WE ALSO SAW U.N.

AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY HOLDING UP PICTURES
TODAY SAYING, IF THE U.N.

DOESN'T ACT THE U.S. MAY HAVE
TO.

HOW MANY MORE CHILDREN HAVE
TO DIE BEFORE RUSSIA CARES?

THE UNITED STATES SEES
YESTERDAY'S ATTACK AS A DISGRACE
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

AN ASSURANCE THAT HUMANITY MEANS
NOTHING TO THE SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT.

WHEN THE UNITED NATIONS
CONSISTENTLY FAILS IN ITS DUTY
TO ACT COLLECTIVELY, THERE ARE
TIMES WHERE WE ARE COMPELLED TO
TAKE OUR OWN ACTION.

I WANT TO BRING IN MARTHA
RADDATZ, WITH US TONIGHT.

YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT THERE
SAYING HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SYRIA
HAS CHANGED.

WE JUST HEARD AMBASSADOR HALEY
SAY, AT TIMES WE'RE QUOTE,
COMPELLED TO TAKE OUR OWN
ACTION.

FOR AMERICANS AT HOME TONIGHT
WONDERING WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN,
WHAT'S NEXT?

WHAT'S THE GOAL HERE?

DO THEY WANT TO PREVENT FURTHER
ATTACKS?

DO THEY JUST WANT TO PUNISH OR
DO THEY WANT TO GET RID OF
BASHAR AL ASSAD?

WE DON'T KNOW.

IN 2013, THERE WERE ARRAY OF AIR
STRIKES WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA
SAID THEY CROSSED THE RED LINE.

THEY DIDN'T USE THEM.

THEY STILL HAD THAT
INTELLIGENCE.

BUT MOST OF THOSE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS, THE STOCKPILES, ARE
GONE SO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS
USED HERE WERE HIDDEN.

THIS IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

AND AS WE HEARD, THEY MET
WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM
TODAY.

MARTHA, THANK YOU.

ALL OF THIS PLAYING OUT AMID
A SHAKEUP ON THE PRESIDENT'S
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.

THE PRESIDENT'S CHIEF POLITICAL
STRATEGIST
STEVE BANNON HAS NOW BEEN
REMOVED FROM THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL.

WHAT'S BEHIND THE MOVE?

HERE'S ABC'S SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT CECILIA VEGA.

PRESIDENT TRUMP, REVERSING HIS
CONTROVERSIAL DECISION TO PUT
HIS CHIEF STRATEGIST, STEVE
BANNON, ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL.

BANNON'S PRESENCE ON THE COUNCIL
DREW HARSH CRITICISM, A
LIGHTNING ROD, HIS RIGHT-WING
VIEWS ON NATIONALISM AND ISLAM
NO SECRET.

IT'S PRETTY DARK HERE IN
EUROPE RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE'S
SOMETHING ACTUALLY MUCH DARKER
AND THAT IS ISLAM.

ADDED BANNON TO THE COMMITTEE,
HE ALSO EXCLUDED KEY MILITARY
AND INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AND
WAS ACCUSED OF FAVORING POLITICS
OVER NATIONAL SECURITY
EXPERIENCE.

TODAY'S RESTRUCTURING LARGELY
DUE TO THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER,
ON THE JOB AFTER MICHAEL FLYNN
WAS FIRED AFTER JUST 24 DAYS.

THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE
LEADERS INITIALLY EXCLUDED, NOW
RESTORED TO THEIR PERMANENT
SEATS ON THE COUNCIL.

VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SAYING
TODAY, "THIS IS JUST A NATURAL
EVOLUTION TO ENSURE THE NATIONAL
SECURITY COUNCIL IS ORGANIZED IN
A WAY THAT BEST SERVES THE
PRESIDENT IN RESOLVING AND
MAKING THOSE DIFFICULT
DECISIONS."

WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SAY
SAME PHILOSOPHY AND VISION AND
THERE WAS NO LONGER A NEED FOR
BANNON ON THE COUNCIL.

THEY SAY BANNON HAS NOT BEEN
DEMOTED.

AS THIS NEWS WAS BREAKING, THE
PRESIDENT IN THE OVAL OFFICE
WITH "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"
TALKING ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED
"ONE OF THE BIG STORIES OF OUR
TIME."

IT INVOLVES PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER SUSAN
RICE AND HER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
THAT SHE ASKED TO KNOW THE
IDENTITIES OF AMERICANS PICKED
UP BY SURVEILLANCE, A PROCESS
KNOWN AS UNMASKING.

SOURCES TELLING ABC NEWS THAT IN
SOME CASES THEY WERE THE NAMES
OF TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND TRANSITION
OFFICIALS, CAUGHT UP IN
SURVEILLANCE AS THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY INVESTIGATED RUSSIA'S
ELECTION MEDDLING.

RICE DENIED LEAKING ANY NAMES.

I LEAKED NOTHING TO NOBODY
AND NEVER HAVE AND NEVER WOULD.

SIMPLY NEEDED TO KNOW THOSE
NAMES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE INTELLIGENCE
REPORTS SHE WAS READING.

WE CAN'T BE PASSIVE CONSUMERS
OF THIS INFORMATION AND NOT --
AND DO OUR JOBS EFFECTIVELY TO
PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

"THE NEW YORK TIMES" IF RICE
COMMITTED A CRIME, PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID, "DO I THINK?

YES, I THINK."

CECILIA, PRESIDENT TRUMP OF
COURSE HAS ACCUSED PRESIDENT
OBAMA OF WIRETAPPING HIM.

AS YOU JUST REPORTED THERE, HE
NOW JUST SAID THAT SUSAN RICE
MAY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME.

WHAT IS SHE SAYING TONIGHT?

A SPOKESPERSON FOR RICE SAID,
I'M NOT GOING TO DIGNIFY THE
PRESIDENT'S COMMENT WITH A
RESPONSE.

THEY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR RICE AND
THEY'D LIKE HER TO TESTIFY
BEFORE THEIR PANELS.

DAVID.

CECILIA VEGA WITH US AGAIN
TONIGHT.

THANK YOU, CECILIA.

WE TURN NOW TO ANOTHER
FIRESTORM, THIS ONE INVOLVING
FOX NEWS HOST BILL O'REILLY.

TONIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
DEFENDING HIM.

HERE'S ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS.

CAUTION, YOU'RE ABOUT TO
ENTER THE NO-SPIN ZONE.

STAR OF FOX NEWS FACES A
FIRESTORM OVER ALLEGED SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, THE PRESIDENT IS
COMING TO HIS DEFENSE.

IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE "THE
NEW YORK TIMES" PRESIDENT TRUMP
SAID -- I THINK HE'S A GOOD
PERSON.

FOX NEWS IS FACING GROWING CALLS
TO FIRE O'REILLY.

AND NEARLY 50 COMPANIES HAVE
PULLED THEIR ADS FROM THE SHOW.

O'REILLY PAID FIVE WOMEN ALMOST
$13 MILLION IN SETTLEMENTS OVER
CLAIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYS
"PERSO.

THE PRESIDENT NOW SAYS
"PERSONALLY I THINK HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE SETTLED.

BECAUSE YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT
ALL THE WAY.

I DON'T THINK BILL DID ANYTHING
WRONG."

IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S
DEFENDED A FOX TITAN.

LAST SUMMER, WHEN FORMER CEO
ROGER AILES FACED MULTIPLE
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, CANDIDATE TRUMP
DEFENDED HIS FRIEND.

THEY'RE SAYING THESE HORRIBLE
THINGS ABOUT HIM.

IT'S VERY SAD.

BECAUSE HE'S A VERY GOOD PERSON.

BEFORE THE ELECTION IT WAS TRUMP
UNDER FIRE FOR THAT INFAMOUS
"ACCESS HOLLYWOOD" TAPE WHERE HE
TALKED ABOUT GROPING WOMEN.

I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY TOO
MUCH OF IT BECAUSE IT IS CRUDE
GUY TALK.

THEN GAVE O'REILLY THE FIRST
TV INTERVIEW IN THE WAKE OF THAT
EXPLOSIVE TAPE.

WELL, FIRST OF ALL, LOCKER
ROOM TALK, AND MOST PEOPLE HAVE
HEARD IT BEFORE.

THE REMARKS.

MORE THAN A DOZEN WOMEN CAME
GUARD ACCUSING HIM OF
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL ADVANCES
AND GROPING.

ALLEGATIONS HE DENIES.

IN A STATEMENT OVER THE WEEKEND,
HE SAID HIS FAME MAKES HIM A
TARGET.

HE HAS TO PUT TO REST ANY
CONTROVERSIES TO SPARE HIS
CHILDREN.

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE OF
O'REILLY COMES JUST DAYS AFTER
THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED APRIL
AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AND AWARENESS
MONTH.

NEXT, THE NEW TORNADO
THREATS.

60 MILLION AMERICANS
BRACING FOR POSSIBLE TWISTERS
AND LARGE HAIL AND FLOOD WATCHES
RIGHT UP INTO THE NORTHEAST.

A CONFIRMED EF-2 TORNADO
TEARING ACROSS GOODMAN,
MISSOURI, ON THE GROUND FOR
ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM PUSHING ITS
WAY EAST.

ABC'S STEVE OSUNSAMI IS IN
ATLANTA, WHERE THEY ARE BRACING
FOR DANGEROUS WEATHER TONIGHT.

DEEP SOUTH TONIGHT ARE FACING AN
EMERGENCY, FROM SWIFT-WATER
RESCUES AT FLOODED STREETS IN
ATLANTA, TO THIS TORNADO IN
WESTON, GEORGIA.

FARMS WERE TORN APART, MOBILE
HOMES DESTROYED.

THE TOP OF THE HOUSE STARTED
PEELING OFF, SO WE KNEW IT WAS A
VERY SERIOUS STORM.

TOURNAMENT IN AUGUSTA, IT WASN'T
SAFE TO STAY OUT ON THE GREENS.

WE ARE ASKING YOU TO EVACUATE
THE GROUNDS.

ACROSS THE REGION, TORNADO
SIRENS ARE BLARING, THE FLASH
FLOODS ARE RISING.

IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT
FOR NEARLY 60 MILLION AMERICANS.

YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL.

THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS
SITUATION YOU'RE COMING INTO.

LIGHTNING STRUCK SEVERAL HOMES
AND SET THEM ON FIRE.

THE HOMEOWNER TOLD ME IT
SOUNDED LIKE A STICK OF DYNAMITE
BE ABLE STAY HERE TONIGHT.

I'VE SEEN A LOT OF LIGHTNING
STRIKES BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM
HURLED AN EF-2 TORNADO AT THE
KIND PEOPLE OF GOODMAN,
MISSOURI.

WINDS AS HIGH AS 120 MILES AND
HOUR HIT A FIRE STATION AND TORE
APART THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

LUCKILY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY
HURT.

STUNNING IMAGES OF THAT
SCHOOL.

STEVE WITH US LIVE FROM ATLANTA.

THIS ISN'T OVER YET.

A BRAND-NEW TORNADO WATCH JUST
ISSUED FOR THE METRO AREA THERE.

IT JUST CAME IN, A BRAND-NEW
TORNADO WATCH FOR THE ENTIRE
ATLANTA METRO AREA UNTIL 900
P.M. TONIGHT.

AND TALK ABOUT A STORY HITTING
CLOSE TO HOME, THIS IS MY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

THE STREET IS BLOCKED.

POWER CREWS ARE OUT HERE, TRYING
TO CLEAR THE ROAD THAT LEADS TO
MY HOUSE AND RESTORE POWER TO
THIS ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD.

DAVID.

WE'RE CERTAINLY YOU'RE OKAY.

WE'RE THINKING OF YOUR
AND EVERYONE ACROSS THE SOUTH.

ROB WITH US TRACKING THIS
NOW.

IT'S NOT JUST THE SOUTH, THIS IS
MOVING EASTWARD AS WE SPEAK.

SUCH A LARGE, SUCH A DYNAMIC
SYSTEM, A HUGE AREA UNDER THE
GUN.

LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.

ALABAMA, GEORGIA, CAROLINAS,
PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION
IN THAT SPOT THERE.

THAT'S A RARE ISSUANCE.

AND THE RADAR LIT UP.

MORE STORMS FIRING.

IT GOES INTO KENTUCKY, OHIO AND
INDIANA.

IT PUSHES OFF TOMORROW INTO THE
EAST AND MID-ATLANTIC WHERE THE
STORMS WILL BE.

SNOW ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS.

BIG-TIME RAIN ACROSS THE
