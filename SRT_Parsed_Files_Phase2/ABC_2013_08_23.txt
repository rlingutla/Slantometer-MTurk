THIS IS "WORLD NEWS."

TONIGHT OUT OF CONTROL, HOW TO
STOP THE WILDFIRE NOW
THREATENING ONE OF AMERICA'S
GREAT NATIONAL PARKS, TRIPLING
IN SIZE, BURNING IN THREE
DIRECTIONS TONIGHT.

THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN ITS
PATH.

WE'RE LIVE AT YOSEMITE.

BREAKING NEWS, THE STUNNING
NUMBERS ON SYRIA, HOW MANY
PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTACKED
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND WHAT
THE FBI DIRECTOR IS TELLING ABC
NEWS ABOUT AMERICANS IN SYRIA.

ARE THEY A NEW THREAT TO OUR
HOMELAND.

TEXT MESSAGES, THE TEENAGER
ABDUCTED AND RESCUED FROM THE
WOODS REVEALING WHAT WAS IN
THOSE MESSAGES AND LETTERS SHE
EXCHANGED WITH HER KIDNAPPER.

AND VANISHED.

WATCH THESE TREES TONIGHT
DISAPPEAR BEFORE OUR EYES.

THE MASSIVE SINK HOLE CAUGHT ON
TAPE IN ONE AMERICAN COMMUNITY,
WHAT CAUSED IT, AND THIS EVENING
WHERE IT COULD HAPPEN NEXT.

GOOD EVENING.

DIANE IS OFF ON THIS THURSDAY
NIGHT.

WE DO BEGIN WITH AN AMERICAN
TREASURE THREATENED BY THAT
FIERCE AND GROWING WILDFIRE
TONIGHT.

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THAT
FIRE INCHING CLOSER BY THE
MINUTE.

THIS IS THE SCENE ON THE GROUND
THIS EVENING.

THE ANCIENT SEQUOIAS, FIRE
TRUCKS RUSHING THROUGH VALLEYS
OF FIRE.

AND JUST LISTEN TONIGHT.

THE SOUND OF THAT WILDFIRE
RAGING OUT OF CONTROL, HUNDREDS
OF FIREFIGHTERS NOW DEPLOYED.

NEW EVACUATIONS UNDER WAY.

THAT FIRE ONE OF AT LEAST 50
BURNING IN THE WEST TONIGHT
IN THE COUNTY WHERE YOSEMITE IS
JUST DECLARING A STATE OF
EMERGENCY.

ABC'S NEAL KARLINSKY IS ON THE
FRONT LINES FOR US AND HE LEADS
US OFF TONIGHT.

GOOD EVENING.

THE SOUTH SIDE OF AN ANGRY FIRE
TONIGHT.

THESE ARE NOT CLOUDS BEHIND ME.

THIS IS SMOKE.

THIS GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE
SIZE AND THE SOAP OF THIS BLAZE
AS THESE PLUMES CONTINUE TO
INTENSIFY AND GET DARKER AND DIE
DOWN AGAIN AS THIS FIRE IS
FOUGHT MAINLY FROM THE AIR.

AT THE YOSEMITE ROSE BED AND
BREAKFAST BUILT FOR THE
THOUSANDS WHO FLOCK TO ITS
UNTOUCHED BEAUTY EACH YEAR,
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR LAST STAND.

THE FIRE IS COMING OVER THE HILL
STRAIGHT AT THEM AND THE OWNER
IN HIS BULLDOZER TO HELP OUT IS
MAKING PLANS WITH THE FIRE TEAM.

GIVE ME THE SIGNAL AND I CAN
MAKE LAPS AROUND THE HOUSE
WITHOUT A PROBLEM.

AT HIS HOUSE, STARING DOWN AN
INTENSE AERIAL FIRE FIGHT TO
STOP THE FLAMES BEFORE THEY BURN
THROUGH HIS PROPERTY.

ARE YOU STICKING HERE
THROUGHOUT?

ABSOLUTELY.

SLEL TER SHELTER IN PLACE,
PROTECT WHAT I CAN AS LONG AS I
CAN.

WE FOUND OUT FIRST HAND.

IT SHOT UP AGAIN, THE FLAMES
DID.

WHILE SHOOTING THIS MATERIAL IN
THE FIRE ZONE -- WHOA!

A CHUNK OF FLAMING TREE BIG
ENOUGH TO SERIOUSLY HURT SOMEONE
FELL NEAR OUR CAR.

IT'S UNUSUALLY BAD RIGHT NOW
EVEN THOUGH THE WILDFIRE NUMBERS
ARE DOWN NATIONWIDE.

THEY'RE WAY UP IN CALIFORNIA
WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN NEARLY 40
PERCENT MORE FIRES THAN LAST
YEAR.

HUNDREDS MORE CAUSED BY
LIGHTNING WITHIN JUST DAYS.

WE FOUND HOMEOWNERS PACKED UP,
READY TO LEAVE IF THEY HAVE TO.

IF WE LOSE IT ALL, WE HAVE A
GREAT INSURANCE POLICY, SO.

HOPEFULLY IT WON'T COME TO
THAT.

WE'LL START ALL OVER AGAIN.

THREATENING ANY MORE HOMES RIGHT
NOW BUT IT IS CONTINUING TO
GROW.

IT HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE SINCE
YESTERDAY.

THEY'VE GOT A REAL FIGHT ON
THEIR HANDS.

THAT DARK SMOKE BEHIND YOU,
NEAL.

THANKS TO YOU.

I WANT TO BRING IN ABC'S
METEOROLOGIST GINGER ZEE WHO IS
TRACKING THIS FIRE FOR US.

YOU WERE TELLING ME THE FIRE IS
CLOSE TO YOSEMITE AND THE PARK
IS NOT IN THE CLEAR YET.

NOT AT ALL.

THEY HAVE THAT DRY FOALAGE.

IT'S ALL OF THE WEST.

50 LARGE WILDFIRES IN NINE
STATES OUT WEST DEALING WITH
THIS.

LIGHTNING AS NEAL MENTIONED A
HUGE ISSUE.

THAT'S WHY WE HAVE RED FLAG
WARNINGS FOR SO MANY PLACES.

I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHO HAS THIS.

SEE THAT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUE.

KICKING OFF THUNDERSTORMS, GUSTY
WINDS AND IN JUST THE LAST 24
HOURS OVER 4,400 LIGHTNING
STRIKES STARTING 45 NEW FIRES
JUST IN CALIFORNIA.

GINGER, THANKS TO YOU AS
ALWAYS.

WE TURN OVERSEAS TO SYRIA
AND THE STUNNING NUMBERS TONIGHT
WE HEARD FROM THE STATE
DEPARTMENT, POTENTIALLY MORE
THAN 1,000 VICTIMS IN THE LATEST
POSSIBLE CHEMICAL ATTACKS, THE
WORLD STILL STUDYING THOSE
DISTURBING IMAGES, THE VICTIMS,
INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF
THIS NEWEST ATTACK.

THIS EVENING THAT DISTURBING
HEADLINE FROM WASHINGTON ABOUT
WHAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT NOW.

U.N.

WEAPONS INSPECTORS ARE ON
THE GROUND FACING HUGE HURDLES
TRYING TO DETERMINE IF CHEMICAL
WEAPONS WERE, IN FACT, ACCUSED.

ABC'S CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS
CORRESPONDENT MARTHA RADDATZ IS
IN THE REGION FOR US TONIGHT.

URGENT TASK.

TONIGHT THE U.S. AND U.N.

RACING
TO FIND OUT WHETHER CHEMICAL
WEAPONS KILLED THESE MEN, WOMEN
AND CHILDREN AND JUST HOW MANY
DIED.

TODAY A SHOCKING NEW NUMBER FROM
OPPOSITION GROUPS REVEALED IN
WASHINGTON.

THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES
WE'VE SEEN RANGE FROM 1,000 TO
1800 WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A BROAD
SAYS THE CLAIMS THAT IT CARRIED
OUT A CHEMICAL ATTACK ARE
BASELESS.

BUT THE WORLD IS REACTING
SWIFTLY AND FORCEFULLY.

AS U.N. INVESTIGATORS BEG FOR
ACCESS TO THE SITE, THE EVIDENCE
MAY BE QUICKLY DISSIPATING.

DAVID, TONIGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA
HAS DIRECTED THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY TO DO EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE TO FIND ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SUSPECTED
ATTACK, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE U.S.

RESPONSE WOULD BE.

DAVID?

MARTHA RADDATZ WITH US AGAIN
TONIGHT.

THANK YOU.

ALSO NEW WORD THIS EVENING
ON AMERICANS NOW BELIEVED TO
HAVE JOINED THE FIGHT ON THE
GROUND IN SYRIA POTENTIALLY
HELPING TERRORIST GROUPS THERE.

COULD THOSE AMERICANS, IN FACT,
POSE A THREAT TO OUR HOMELAND.

OUR SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT
PIERRE THOMAS SAT DOWN WITH FBI
DIRECTOR ROBERT MULLER TODAY.

WE KNOW MULLER IS ABOUT TO
STEP DOWN AFTER 12 YEARS.

THIS WAS REALLY SOMETHING TODAY
IN YOUR INTERVIEW EXPRESSING
REAL CONCERN ABOUT AMERICANS ON
THE GROUND IN SYRIA?

REPORTER THE FBI DIRECTOR IS
CONCERNED ABOUT RADICALS WHO
HAVE GONE TO FIGHT INCLUDING
MEMBERS OF AL QAEDA, AND HE SAID
THERE IS INTELLIGENCE AMERICANS
MAY HAVE JOINED THEM.

YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT
THEY -- NUMBER ONE, THE
ASSOCIATIONS THEY WILL MAKE AND
SECONDLY, THE EXPERTISE THEY
WILL DEVELOP AND WHETHER OR NOT
THEY WILL UTILIZE THAT EXPERTISE
TO UNDERTAKE AN ATTACK IN THE
HOMELAND.

SO, YES, WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
THAT.

AS HE GETS READY TO LEAVE HIS
POST, PIERRE, YOU ASKED WHAT
STILL KEEPS HIM UP AT NIGHT AND
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

ALWAYS.

HE WORRIES ABOUT TERRORISTS
TAKING ON A PLANE WITH A BOMB OR
USING BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL
WEAPONS.

HE SAID THOSE THREATS ARE VERY,
VERY REAL.

PIERRE THOMAS WITH US FROM
OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU, THANK
YOU.

FROM SYRIA TO THE BREAKING
IMAGES FROM EGYPT TONIGHT WHERE
AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND
BARS, FORMER PRESIDENT HOSNI
MUBARAK WAS LET OUT OF PRISON,
TAKEN AWAY IN A HELICOPTER.

A DRAMATIC CHANGE OF FORTUNE
FROM OUR TIME THERE DURING THE
REVOLUTION THAT BROUGHT HIM
DOWN.

OUR ABC NEWS TEAM WAS ON THE
GROUND IN CAIRO AS THEY PUSHED
HIM FROM POWER.

WE ALL REMEMBER THAT MOMENT IN
THE
SQUARE AS SUPPORTERS WITH WHIPS
RODE IN ON CAMEL AND HORSE BACK
TARGETING THE PROTESTORS.

NOT LONG AFTER, THIS IMAGE,
AROUND THE WORLD OF MUBARAK
DISGRACED IN A CAGE IN A
COURTROOM.

TONIGHT THE EYES OF EGYPT AND
THE WORLD WERE ON THAT
HELICOPTER, MUBARAK BEING
WHISKED AWAY TO A MILITARY
HOSPITAL.

THE MAN ELECTED TO REPLACE HIM,
MOHAMMED MORSI, IN PRISON
INSTEAD.

BACK AT HOME TO AN AMERICAN
WHO SHARED SECRETS BEFORE EDWARD
SNOWDEN AND THE NSA.

BRADLEY MANNING WAS THE ARMY
PRIVATE WHO LEAKED THE TOP
SECRET DOCUMENTS, JUST SENTENCED
TO 35 YEARS BEHIND BARS THIS
WEEK, TONIGHT REVEALING HE WANTS
TO LIVE BEHIND BARS AS A WOMAN.

THE AMERICAN MILITARY RESPONDING
TO THAT REQUEST.

HERE'S ABC'S SENIOR NATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT JIM AVILA NOW.

ONE MORE SECRET TO TELL, THE
SMALL STATURED MAN IN THE ARMY
GREENS IS ACTUALLY A WOMAN
INSIDE.

THOSE PICTURES OF HIM CROSS
DRESSING SHOWN AT TRIAL WERE
REAL AND NOT A DEFENSE TACTIC.

IN A LETTER RELEASED TODAY,
MANNING WROTE, "AS I TRANSITION
INTO THIS NEXT PHASE OF MY LIFE,
I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THE REAL
ME.

I AM CHELSEA MANNING.

I AM A FEMALE."

MANNING WANTS TO BE CALLED "SHE"
AND BEGIN THE TRANSFORMATION
IMMEDIATELY.

"GIVEN THE WAY THAT I FEEL AND
HAVE FELT SINCE CHILDHOOD, I
WANT TO BEGIN HORMONE THERAPY AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE."

THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE AT
FORT LEAVENWORTH WHERE HE'S TO
SERVE A 35-YEAR SENTENCE FOR
RELEASING 700,000 DOCUMENTS TO
WIKILEAKS, THE MILITARY DOES NOT
OFFER THAT TYPE OF TREATMENT BUT
MANNING'S ATTORNEY VOWS TO
FIGHT.

I'M GOING TO CHANGE THAT.

DEMONSTRATED THEIR CLIENT'S
FEELING ABOUT BEING A WOMAN
DURING THE PRE-TRIAL HEARINGS.

MANNING CALLED HIMSELF BRIE YAN
NA BACK THEN.

TODAY THE SIGNATURE READS
CHELSEA.

JIM AVILA, ABC NEWS, WASHINGTON.

NEXT TO CALIFORNIA TONIGHT
AND THE TEENAGER KIDNAPPED AND
RESCUED FROM THE WOODS, HANNAH
ANDERSON.

WE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE DOZEN
TEXT MESSAGES SENT BACK AND
FORTH WITH THE KIDNAPPER IN THE
HOURS BEFORE IT UNFOLDED.

TONIGHT SHE REVEALS IN HER OWN
WORDS WHAT THOSE TEXT MESSAGES
WERE ABOUT AND THE LETTER SHE
EXCHANGED WITH THE ALLEGED
KIDNAPPER, TOO.

HERE'S ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS
TONIGHT.

HER MOTHER AND BROTHER TORTURED
AND KILLED.

NOW A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK
AFTER HER RESCUE, 16-YEAR-OLD
HANNAH ANDERSON SEEN BY SO MANY
AS A VICTIM, FEELS THE NEED TO
DEFEND HERSELF.

IN AN INTERVIEW BROADCAST ON NBC
NEWS, SHE EXPLAINED WHY SHE HAD
HER 40-YEAR-OLD ABDUCTOR WHO SHE
HAD ALWAYS KNOWN AS UNCLE JIM.

THE LETTERS WERE FROM A YEAR
AGO WHEN ME AND MY MOM WEREN'T
GETTING ALONG VERY WELL.

ME AND HIM TALKED ABOUT HOW TO
DEAL WITH IT.

OF HER ABDUCTION, SHE SAYS THEY
WEREN'T PHONE CALLS BUT TEXT
MESSAGES BECAUSE HE WAS PICKING
HER UP FROM CHEERLEADING CAMP
AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND
HER.

AS THE COMMUNITY COMES TOGETHER
TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE FUNERAL
OF HER MOW AND 8-YEAR-OLD
BROTHER, HANNAH EXPRESSES
GRATITUDE FOR THE AMBER ALERT
THAT SHE SAYS SAVED HER.

I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT
WAS BUT I KNOW IT HELPED PEOPLE
FIND ME.

WITH EVERYONE'S SUPPORT IT CAN
PEOPLE WON'T SEE HER AS A VICTIM
BUT AS A SURVIVOR INSTEAD.

LINSEY DAVIS, ABC NEWS, NEW
YORK.

TO BOSTON TONIGHT, NEW
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE OF THE
FORMER FOOTBALL STAR CHARGED
WITH MURDER IN MASSACHUSETTS.

FORMER NEW ENGLAND PATRIOT AARON
HERNANDEZ DIDN'T SPEAK BUT
MOUTHED THE WORDS "I LOVE YOU"
TO HIS MOTHER IN COURT TODAY.

HE WAS INDICTED BY A GRAND JURY
FOR SHOOTING HIS FRIEND.

PROSECUTORS SAY HE ORCHESTRATED
THAT KILLING.

HE'S BEING HELD WITHOUT BAIL AND
REMAINS IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

TO A CASE PLAYING OUT IN SAN
DIEGO TONIGHT INVOLVING THE
EMBATTLED MAYOR THERE.

ALL WEEK PROTESTORS PUTTING
PRESSURE ON THE MAYOR TO RESIGN
AFTER THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SCANDAL, THAT 1-800 NUMBER SET
UP FOR ALLEGED VICTIMS.

ONE PROTESTER TAKING TO THE AIR
WRITING, "SURRENDER BOB," ACROSS
THE SKY.

TONIGHT A NEW IMAGE GIVING US A
CLUE ABOUT WHAT THE DISGRACED
MAYOR MAY BE PLANNING NEXT.

ABC'S RYAN OWENS ON THE CASE
AGAIN TONIGHT.

MAYOR FILNER, ARE YOU GOING
TO RESIGN?

ANY INDICATION, IT MAY FINALLY
BE OVER.

SAN DIEGO MAYOR BOB FILNER
LOADING BOXES INTO HIS SUV
OUTSIDE CITY HALL LAST NIGHT.

GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

LEARNED MAYOR FILNER IS PREPARED
TO RESIGN TOMORROW IF THE CITY
COUNCIL SIGNS OFF ON A DEAL
HASHED OUT OVER THREE DAYS OF
MEDIATION.

THE 70-YEAR-OLD IS ACCUSED OF
SEXUALLY HARASSING 18 WOMEN.

THERE WAS A HAND THAT WENT TO
MY BACK, TO MY BUTTOCK AND I WAS
SHOCKED.

MANY DON'T WANT TAXPAYERS TO PAY
FILNER ANOTHER CENT.

HIS PARTING GIFT SHOULD BE
GOOD RIDDANCE INSTEAD OF A
HANDOUT.

HE'S BECOME SUCH A PUNCH LINE.

♪ MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU LEFT
VOTERS WANT HIM RECALLED BEFORE
HE CAN QUIT.

THEY SAY RESIGNATION IS TOO EASY
FOR A MAN WHO HAS EMBARRASSED
RYAN OWENS, ABC NEWS, SAN DIEGO.

NOW TO THE BREAKING HEADLINE
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALL DAY
FROM WALL STREET.

REAL CONCERN TODAY WHEN
COMPUTERS SUDDENLY FROZE, STOCKS
HALTED, NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS
HAPPENING AT THE NASDAQ AS
THEIR RETIREMENTS, WERE FOR A
TIME FROZEN FOR THREE HOURS.

I WANT TO BRING IN OUR CHIEF
BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
CORRESPONDENT REBECCA JARVIS.

YOU WERE WITH US ALL AFTERNOON.

YOU WERE TELLING ME THIS IS
UNPRECEDENTED.

THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE IN COMPANIES MOST
PEOPLE OWN IN THEIR RETIREMENT
SAVINGS -- APPLE, GOOGLE,
MICROSOFT, FACEBOOK.

ALL OF THESE COMPANIES CEASED TO
TRADE FOR THREE HOURS TODAY.

MUCH OF THAT TIME WAS SPENT
TRYING TO DETERMINE JUST WHY
THAT WAS.

VERY LITTLE INFORMATION COMING
OUT.

THEY'VE TRACED IT TO A TECHNICAL
PROBLEM AT THE NASDAQ BUT STILL
WE DON'T KNOW WHY THAT HAPPENED.

WE KNOW THERE WAS A FEAR THAT
THIS WAS A POTENTIAL TERROR
THREAT, A POSSIBLE HACKER.

THE FBI DIRECTOR TOLD ABC NEWS
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
KEEPS HIM UP AT NIGHT.

THIS IS WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS
NOTIFIED.

THE S.E.C., THE TREASURY ALL
WATCHING THIS SITUATION TO
DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE IT GOES.

THERE IS A VERY REAL CYBER
THREAT AND IF IT IMPACTS OUR
MARKETS IT COULD IMPACT PEOPLE'S
LIVES.

WE SHOULD MENTION WHEN IT WAS
ALL OVER THE NASDAQ CLOSED UP 38
POINTS TODAY.

THE DOW WAS UP 66 POINTS.

NO MONEY WAS LOST BUT SOME REAL
NERVES WERE TESTED ON WALL
STREET THIS AFTERNOON.

THERE IS STILL MUCH MORE
AHEAD ON "WORLD NEWS" THIS
THURSDAY NIGHT.

LOOK AT THESE TREES THIS
EVENING.

THIS IS NO SCI-FI THRILLER, THIS
IS THE REAL THING IN AN AMERICAN
TOWN, A MASSIVE SINK HOLE.

WHAT CAUSED IT.

WHY SCIENTISTS SAY IT CAN HAPPEN
AGAIN AND WHERE.

BREAKING, A HUSBAND
OVERBOARD, LOST AT SEA, JUST
FOUND, SURVIVED 18 HOURS, NO
LIFE VEST, HOW DID HE DO IT?

TO PROVE TO YOU THAT ALEVE
IS THE BETTER CHOICE FOR HER,
SHE'S AGREED TO GIVE IT UP.

THAT'S TODAY?

TO SEE HOW IT GOES.

IT'S REALLY BEEN SOMETHING.

WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF THOSE
STUNNING SINK HOLES THIS YEAR
BUT NOTHING LIKE THIS.

TONIGHT A REMARKABLE SCENE IN
LOUISIANA CAUGHT ON CAMERA,
EVERYTHING VANISHING IN 30
SECONDS BUT WHAT CAUSED IT AND
COULD IT HAPPEN NEAR YOU.

HERE'S ABC'S MATT GUTMAN
TONIGHT.

OPTICAL ILLUSION.

A STAND OF TREES SEEMLY MELTING
INTO THIS SWAMP IN LOUISIANA IS
BEING SWALLOWED INTO A MASSIVE
SINK HOLE, SUCKING EVERYTHING
DOWN WITH IT.

WATCH THOSE TREES AGAIN DIPPING
SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN QUICKLY
VANISHING INTO THE HOLE.

SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S MORE THAN A
FOOTBALL FIELD DEEP.

IT'S NEAR AN OLD SALT MINE.

WORKERS WERE USING WATER TO
DISSOLVE AND PUMP OUT THE SALT
DEEP UNDERGROUND AND EVENTUALLY
PUMPED OUT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE
GROUND GIVE WAY.

NOW THE EARTH SLOWLY MOVES INTO
THE CAVERN CAUSING GROWING SINK
HOLES ABOVE.

IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO
GROW UNTIL IT FINDS A POINT
WHERE IT CAN SUPPORT ITSELF.

APPEARED A YEAR AGO.

150 HOUSEHOLDS WERE EVACUATED
AND THE STATE IS SUING THE
COMPANY THAT MINED THE SALT.

SINK HOLES ARE COMMON AND OFTEN
OCCUR NATURALLY.

THIS ONE IN DOWNTOWN GUATEMALA
CITY BORE A HOLE BIG ENOUGH TO
SWALLOW THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

THEY RIDDLED THE STATE OF
FLORIDA BECAUSE MOST OF THE
STATE SITS ON POUROUS LIMESTONE.

IT BURNS THROUGH THE ROCK.

WE'RE TALKING HUNDREDS OF
ORLANDO GULPED DOWN PART OF A
RESORT, FORCING DOZENS TO
EVACUATE.

ANOTHER ONE IN FLORIDA EARLIER
THIS YEAR TURNED DEADLY, KILLING
JEFF BUSH AS HE LAY SLEEPING IN
BED.

PERHAPS THERE IS NO GREATER
VISUAL OF A SINK HOLE'S
DESTRUCTIVE POWER THAN THIS.

MATT GUTMAN, ABC NEWS,
LOUISIANA.

WHEN WE COME BACK, BREAKING
TONIGHT, AN AMAZING TALE OF
SURVIVAL, A HUSBAND WHO SURVIVED
18 HOURS, TOSSED OVERBOARD, NO
LIFE JACKET.

AN ENTIRE FLIGHT.

HE DIDN'T SAY, "THIS IS YOUR
CAPTAIN SPEAKING."

HE SANG INSTEAD, WHEN WE COME
BACK.

INSTEAD, WHEN WE COME
BACK.

OUR "INSTANT INDEX" TONIGHT
STARTS WITH AN AMAZING SURVIVAL
TALE.

AT 1000:A.M. A MAN SET OUT ON A
SOLO FISHING TRIP IN THE GULF OF
MEXICO.

THREE HOURS LATER HE TEXTED HIS
WIFE THIS PICTURE BUT THAT WAS
LAST SHE HEARD FROM HIM.

BY 830 AT NIGHT SHE CALLED THE
POLICE.

RESCUE CREWS SEARCHED BY AIR AND
SEA.

AT 400 IN THE MORNING THEY
FOUND HIM ALIVE FLOATING WITHOUT
A LIFE VEST, TREADING WATER, 18
HOURS LATER FOUND, AND A WIFE
RELIEVED TONIGHT.

SOMETHING MILLIONS OF
AMERICAN FAMILIES WHO WELCOME A
PUPPY INTO THEIR HOME CAN RELATE
TO.

PRESIDENT OBAMA REVEALING
SOMETHING ABOUT THE NEWEST
ADDITION TO THEIR FAMILY TODAY,
THEIR PUPPY, SUNNY.

NOT COMPLETELY POTTY TRAINED.

SAYING TO THE FOLKS THERE
HE'S NOT COMPLETELY POTTY
TRAINED.

GIVEN THAT INFORMATION TONIGHT,
THERE IS NO WORD ON WHETHER
SUNNY HAS BEEN ALLOWED INTO THE
OVAL OFFICE TONIGHT.

WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.
