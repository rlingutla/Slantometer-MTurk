GETTING WORK DONE.

ERIC IT'S A THREE-YEAR PROJECT
TO REFURBISH THE TOWER.

IT WILL COST ABOUT $42 MILLION
WILL TAKE HALF A YEAR JUST TO
PUT UP THE SCAFFOLDING.

THE CLOCK WILL BE STOPPED FOR
THREE MONTHS TO DO THE
MAINTENANCE.

ARTHEL JULIA'S UP NEXT.

JULIE PRESIDENT TRUMP
REPORTEDLY TRYING TO SMOOTH
THINGS OVER A MONTH THE
HIGH-LEVEL PEOPLE IN HIS OFFICE
IN THE TURMOIL.

AS THE PRESIDENT AND HIS
ADVISERS -- I'M JULIE BANDERAS
AND THIS IS "THE FOX REPORT".

AMERICAN TOMAHAWK MISSILES
NEARLY LEVELING A SYRIAN AIRBASE
HANGER.

DEMOLISHED AND RUNWAYS DAMAGE
THE SYRIAN FORCES ARE LASHING
OUT AT REBEL TARGETS.

WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS THE
GLOBAL REACTION POURS IN?

THE MAN WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN
LADEN SAYS DIPLOMACY MUST BE A
FACTOR.

THEIR PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON
PLANNING THIS SINCE 2003.

THE PLAN WILL BE THERE BUT AGAIN
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE WAR COME IS
GOING TO BE DIPLOMACY.

JULIE WE HAVE TO "FOX NEWS"
TEAM COVERAGE.

WE BEGIN WITH KRISTIN FISHER WHO
IS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT
THIS WEEKEND AT MAR-A-LAGO IN
FLORIDA AND KRISTIN IT'S BEEN
OVER 48 HOURS SINCE HE TOOK HIS
VERY FIRST BIG MILITARY ACTION
AS PRESIDENT.

ANY INDICATION OF HOW HE'S DOING
TONIGHT?

BY ALL ACCOUNTS PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S VERY PLEASED THAT HIS
DECISION TO STRIKE AND WITH HOW
IT'S PLAYING OUT.

HIS DECISION TO STRIKE HAS
RECEIVED WIDESPREAD PRAISE FROM
OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION.

THE SAUDI TEAM CALLED A
COURAGEOUS ACT AND SPRAYS BY
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON
CAPITOL HILL.

THE ONE AREA WHERE PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS RECEIVED CRITICISM
THAT WAS HIS DECISION TO ACT
WITHOUT FIRST SEEKING
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL BUT EVEN
ON THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED
THAT DECISION TODAY IN A LETTER
TO CONGRESS.

HE WROTE THAT I ACTED IN THE
VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY AND
FOREIGN-POLICY INTERESTS OF THE
UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO MY
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO
CONDUCT FOREIGN RELATIONS AND AS
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND CHIEF
EXECUTIVE.

THE U.S. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL
ACTION AS NECESSARY AND
APPROPRIATE TO FURTHER ITS
IMPORTANT NATIONAL INTERESTS.

THE TWO BIG TAKEAWAYS THERE ARE
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP REITERATING
WHAT THE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.
NIKKI HALEY SAID YESTERDAY, THAT
THE U.S. MAY BE WILLING TO TAKE
FURTHER ACTION IF NECESSARY IF
ASSAD DOES NOT STOP THE CHEMICAL
WEAPONS ATTACKS AGAINST HIS OWN
PEOPLE AND THEN IT ALSO, THEY
SHOW PRESIDENT TRUMP BELIEVES HE
CAN TAKE THAT ACTION WITHOUT
RECEIVING CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
TO DO SO.

I AM SURE A LOT OF FOLKS ON
CAPITOL HILL WOULD DISAGREE WITH
THAT.

JULIE WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
KRISTIN ABOUT ALL THESE REPORTS
OF A SHAKEUP WITH SENIOR WHITE
HOUSE STAFF?

ANY TRUTH TO THEM?

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS NO TRUTH
THAT THIS HAS KIND HAVE BEEN
BREWING FOR SOME TIME.

THE MAIN SOURCE OF CONFLICT IS
BETWEEN SENIOR ADVISER JARED
KUSHNER AND STEVE BANNON.

AND THEN OF COURSE IS A
NONINTERVENTIONIST.

HE BELIEVES THE U.S. SHOULD NOT
INTERVENE IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA
AND THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HE
ARGUED AGAINST THE STRIKE.

LAST NIGHT AT THE PRESIDENTS
REQUEST THE TWO SAT DOWN AT
MAR-A-LAGO BUT THESE IDEOLOGICAL
DIVISIONS REMAIN.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

FORMER CAMPAIGN MANAGER COREY
LEWANDOWSKI PUTS IT IN
PERSPECTIVE.

ANYONE WHO WANTS TO PRETEND
TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE
PRESIDENT MAY FIND THEMSELVES
BACKTRACKING VERY QUICKLY WHAT
WE KNOW IS THE PRESIDENT IS THE
ONE WHO MAKES THE DECISIONS IN
THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT WHO IS
GOING TO LEAD.

THE WHITE HOUSE DOWNPLAYING
ANY REPORTS OF A STAFF SHAKEUP
IS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTRACT FROM
THE GOOD WEEK THE PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S HAD.

JULIE TO SERIOUS MISSILE LAUNCH
SIGNAL A SHIFT IN THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION?

I THINK THIS RIFT BETWEEN
BANNON AND KUSHNER IS INDICATIVE
OF THE CROSSROADS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS AT.

IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING TO
CONTINUE ON WITH HIS AMERICA
FIRST THEME INSTEAD OF COUNTRIES
LIKE SYRIA OR IS HE BECOMING A
BIT MORE OF A HUMANITARIAN
INTERVENTION IS SOMETHING THAT
HE WARNED AGAINST ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

ANOTHER QUESTION IS IS HE NOW
TURNING ON RUSSIA A COUNTRY THAT
STRONGLY SUPPORTED BASHAR
AL-ASSAD ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE
HAVE BEEN ALL THESE REPORTS BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS HIS
ASSOCIATES THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOO
COZY WITH RUSSIA AND THERE ARE
SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO
WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF HIS
ASSOCIATES BROKE THE LAW.

ONE THING IS CLEAR THOUGH AND
THAT IS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
WILLING TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE.

HE'S WILLING TO CHANGE HIS MIND
TO DEFAULT.

THE BIG QUESTION THOUGH IS
EVOLVE INTO WHAT?

EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF POLICIES HE
GOING TO HAVE GOING FORWARD AND
WILL IT ALIGN WITH THE JARED
KUSHNER BRANCH OF THE WEST WING
OR WHAT SIDE MORE WITH STEVE
BANNON?

JULIE KRISTIN FISHER FOR
TONIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

THE U.S.

ATTACK APPARENTLY HAS
NOT SLOWED SYRIA DOWN MUCH.

THAT IS THE WORD.

JUST HOURS LATER SYRIAN
WARPLANES FROM OTHER BASES
APPARENTLY STRUCK OPPOSITION
TARGETS INCLUDING ONE NEAR THE
SITE OF A DEADLY CHEMICAL ATTACK
WHICH PROVOKED THE U.S.

RESPONSE
OF THE VERY FIRST PLACE.

THIS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE JOHN
STRIKE WAS A GOOD START BUT MORE
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

LISTEN.

I WOULD ARGUE FOR A NO-FLY
ZONE AND ARMING AND TRAINING THE
FREE SYRIAN ARMY.

AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST
CONTINUE TO TAKE MOSUL AND RAQQA
AND STOP THIS FLOW THAT IS
COMING OUT OF RAQQA AND BEING
SENT TO EUROPE AND TO THE UNITED
STATES TO PREVENT TERROR.

SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE
THE RIGHT FIRST STEP AND I THINK
HE HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

JULIE PENTAGON PRODUCER LUKE IS
THOMAS AND IS LIVE WITH THE VERY
LATEST.

WHAT ELSE WOULD I GUESS WE LIKE
TO SEE AS FAR AS AIRSTRIKES INTO
SYRIA, WHAT MORE THEY TALKING
ABOUT?

JULIE TODAY AN OLD ARCH ENEMY
OF THE ASSAD REGIME TURKISH
FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THIS EARLY
TODAY IN TURKEY.

WE SEE THE U.S.

INTERVENTION
AS APPROPRIATE.

THIS IS NOT ENOUGH EITHER.

DEFENSE INTERVENTION OF AN
AIRBASE THAT DOES NOT CONTINUE
IF WE DON'T REMOVE THE REGIME
FROM POWER AND THIS REMAINS A
COSMETIC INTERVENTION.

ANIMOSITY BETWEEN TURKEY AND
ASSAD REGIME GOES BACK DECADES.

1939 TURKEY ANNEXED LAND AT
NORTHWEST AREA WHICH TODAY IS
TURKEY'S SOUTHERNMOST PROVINCE.

SENIOR MILITARY OFFICIALS HELPED
A RUSSIAN DRONES SEEN OVER A
HOSPITAL WHERE VICTIMS OF
TUESDAY'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS
ATTACK WERE TAKEN AND FIVE HOURS
LATER RUSSIAN AND SYRIAN JETS
BOMBED IT IN AN EFFORT TO KILL
MORE PEOPLE AND DESTROY THE
EVIDENCE OF THE CHEMICAL ATTACK
RADIOS OFFICIALS SAY RUSSIA HAS
CHEMICAL WEAPONS EXPERTS INSIDE
SYRIA INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINAL
ROLE -- A LITERAL PRE-TWO DAYS
AFTER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILE STRIKE IN SYRIA "FOX
NEWS" HAS LEARNED THE U.S.
MILITARY IS RAMPING UP EFFORTS
TO PROTECT THE NEARLY 1000
AMERICAN TROOPS ON THE GROUND IN
SYRIA OR U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THE
COALITION IS CUT BACK ON SOME OF
ITS AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ISIS
THERE BECAUSE U.S. AIR FORCE
F-22 STEALTH FIGHTER JETS FROM
THE AIRBASE IN TURKEY NOT FAR
FROM THE SYRIAN BORDER ARE
CONDUCTING IN CREASED AIR
PATROLS A CASE OF SYRIAN OR
RUSSIAN MILITARY TRIES TO ATTACK
AMERICAN FORCES ON THE GROUND.

FOR THIS MOMENT JULIE U.S.
OFFICIALS SAY THE ASSAD REGIME
HAS NOT BEEN MAKING ANY
THREATENING MOVES THE KEEP IN
MIND IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDREDS
OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES ON
THE GROUND YOU HAVE A U.S.
MARINE CORPS ARTILLERY BATTERY
OUTSIDE OF RAQQA SUPPORTING
U.S.-BACKED FORCES AS THEY TRY
TO RECAPTURE.

JULIE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
EXPECT MORE AMERICAN AIRSTRIKES
AGAINST ASSAD REGIME BECAUSE IT
SEEMS AS THOUGH THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS HINTED THAT THERE ARE MORE
TO COME AND OF COURSE THEIR
POLICY AT THIS POINT AT LEAST
WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE
CLEAR IS THAT HE DOESN'T PLAN ON
MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HEAR WHAT THEIR PLAN IS UNTIL IT
HAPPENS.

THAT'S RIGHT IN OFFICIALS
I'VE SPOKEN TODAY SAID NOT TO
EXPECT ANY MORE AIRSTRIKES ON
THE ASSAD REGIME ANYTIME SOON.

AS WAS ALLUDED TO THIS WEEK
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HANDED MORE
PLANTS TO STRIKE THE ASSAD
REGIME.

MADE THE DECISION IN FOUR HOURS
LATER THE TOMAHAWK CRUISE
MISSILES LEFT THE RAIL.

YESTERDAY THE U.S.

AMBASSADOR
THE UNITED NATIONS NIKKI HALEY
SAID THE UNITED STATES COULD
STRIKE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

UNITED STATES TOOK A VERY
MEASURED STEP LAST NIGHT.

WE ARE PREPARED TO DO MORE BUT
WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE
NECESSARY.

JULIE ONE OF THOSE U.S.

WARSHIPS THAT FIRED THE TOMAHAWK
CRUISE MISSILES INTO SERIOUS
HEADING TO AN UNDISCLOSED
LOCATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TO
REARM.

I JUST RECEIVED NEWS A FEW
MINUTES AGO THE USS CARL VINSON
AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAD BEEN
PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED IN A PORTED
AUSTRALIA HAS TURNED AROUND AND
WILL BE PROCEEDING OUT THE
KOREAN PENINSULA IN THE WAKE OF
RECENT NORTH KOREAN
PROVOCATIONS.

JULIE VERY INTERESTING.

LUCAS TOMLINSON THANK YOU VERY
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MOVE TO STRIKE
THE SYRIAN AIRBASE WINNING
PRAISE FROM OUR ALLIES AROUND
THE WORLD WHILE RUSSIA AND IRAN
ARE PREVENTING THE ATTACK --
CONDEMNING THE ATTACK.

PROTESTERS LINING THE STREETS OF
DAMASCUS CALLING THE ATTACK AND
AGGRESSION AGAINST THE ENTIRE
NATION BUT RUSSIA REMAINS THE
MOST CRITICAL.

KATIE LOGAN HAS MORE FROM OUR
LONDON BUREAU.

UK, THE STRONGEST OBJECTIONS
ARE COMING FROM RUSSIA.

THEY VOICED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S.
ACTION IN SYRIA IS THE SAUDIS
CALLING IT A COURAGEOUS DECISION
BUT REFLECTING A REGION OVER
SYRIA IRANIAN PRESIDENT A STRONG
ALLY OF ASSAD HAS BEEN CRITICAL
OF U.S. DECISION.

IT WAS THESE IMAGES OF THE
HORRIFIC CHEMICAL STRIKE IN
NORTHERN SYRIA WHICH SPARKED
GLOBAL OUTRAGE THAT LED TO THE
U.S. MILITARY RESPONSE.

U.S. OFFICIALS ARE LOOKING INTO
WHETHER RUSSIA MAY HAVE
SUPPORTED US.

GOVERNMENT IN CARRYING OUT THE
ATTACK BUT ALL EYES ARE NOW ON
THE RUSSIAN REACTION TO THE KEY
ROLE IN SYRIA WHILE STANDING BY
ASSAD AGGRESSION.

RUSSIA HAS BEEN THE MOST
CRITICAL OF THE U.S. MISSILE
STRIKE SAYING THEY WERE IN
VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.

IT ALSO SAYS IT'S A SETBACK FOR
RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. AND MAY
HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR
THE REGION.

RUSSIA KEEPS UP A STRONG
MILITARY PRESENCE ACTIVELY
ASSISTING THE ASSAD REGIME IN
THE COMPANY.

YESTERDAY THIS RUSSIAN WARSHIP
PASSED THROUGH TURKISH WATERS
HEADING TOWARDS THE SYRIAN
COAST.

SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
WILL NO DOUBT BE DISCUSSING
SYRIA WHEN HE DOES -- VISITS
RUSSIA NEXT WEEK.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KEEPS
PRESSURE ON THE SYRIAN REGIME.

JULIE SENATOR RAND PAUL AND A
CRITIC OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
EXPRESSING DOUBT OF U.S. STRIKE
ON SYRIA SAYING THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD OBEY THE CONSTITUTION AND
ASK OR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL
BEFORE USING MILITARY ACTION.

WAR HAS CAUSED THESE REFUGEES
TO FLEE SO WILL MORE WAR
ACCELERATE OR ACCENTUATE THE
CURRENT INVOLVEMENT?

WILL THERE BE LESS REFUGEES
UNLESS DEATH?

I WOULD SAY THERE WOULD BE MORE
DEATHS AND MORE REFUGEES.

I DON'T KNOW THAT OUR BOMBING
WILL LEAD TO PEACE.

JULIE BUT SENATOR IF WE DON'T
GET INVOLVED WHAT DID THEY DO
JUST CHEMICALLY GASSED EVERY
BABY IN THE PLACE AND EVERY
WOMAN AND CHILD?

IS DOING IT ON HIS OWN.

THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DEPLORABLE.

ATROCITY IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO
DISOBEY THE CONSTITUTION.

JULIE HEAR MORE FROM THE SENDER
TONIGHT AT 900 P.M. EASTERN
WITH JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JUDY
AIRING ON THE "FOX NEWS"
CHANNEL.

RIGHT NOW VICTIMS FROM A DEADLY
ATTACK IN SWEDEN ARE B
HONORED AFTER YESTERDAY'S DEADLY
TRUCK ATTACK IN SOUTH HOLMES OR
THE SUSPECT REMAINS IN CUSTODY.

INVESTIGATORS ARE SAYING ABOUT
HIS PATH IN THIS TERROR ATTACK.

A MANHUNT FOR A MAN POLICE ARE
CALLING A NATIONAL THREAT.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUSPECT
IS ACCUSED OF STEALING GUNS AND
SENDING A MANIFESTO TO THE
PRESIDENT AND SECRETLY RECORDING
IT, NEXT.

TO HACK ONE SUSPECT IN CUSTODY
AFTER A BOMB LIKE DEVICE WAS
DISCOVERED IN OSLO NORWAY.

THE DEVICE IS NOT HARMFUL
HOWEVER A LARGE AREA IS BEING
ROPED OFF WHILE THEY INVESTIGATE
NORWAY IS ON HIGH ALERT AFTER
NEIGHBORING SWEDEN SUFFERED A
TERROR ATTACK ON FRIDAY.

TONIGHT'S VICTIMS FROM THAT
DEADLY TERROR ATTACK IN
STOCKHOLM ARE BEING HONORED WITH
CANDLES AND FLOWERS LAID OUT
WHERE THIS SCENE TOOK PLACE, A
TRUCK CRASHING INTO DEPARTMENTS
ARE KILLING AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE
AND INJURED MORE THAN A DOZEN
OTHERS.

POLICE NOW TO HAVE CUSTODY OF
THE SUSPECT WHO HAS BEEN ON THE
RADAR APPARENTLY IN THE PAST.

RIGHT NOW WE ARE LEARNING MORE
ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.

BRYAN LLENAS IS HERE WITH MORE.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUSPECT
AND A POSSIBLE MOTIVE?

WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE
MOTIVE IN TERMS OF HE HAS NOT
SPOKEN YET BUT POLICE SAY THEY
ARE CONFIDENT THE 39-YEAR-OLD
UZBEKISTAN MAN WITH THE DRIVER
BEHIND THE STOLEN BEER TRUCK
THAT PLOWED THROUGH CROWD IN
CENTRAL STOCKHOLM KILLING FOUR
AND WOUNDING 15 OTHERS ON
FRIDAY.

THIS IS CELL PHONE VIDEO OF THE
SUSPECT BEING ARRESTED 25 MILES
NORTH OF STOCKHOLM.

HE HAD BEEN ON INTELLIGENCE
RADAR SOMETIME AGO BUT WAS
DEEMED QUOTE A MARGINAL
CHARACTER.

HE IS NOW FACING TERROR MURDER
CHARGES.

WE DON'T KNOW THE SUSPECTS NAMES
OR WHETHER HE'S A LEGAL RESIDENT
OF SWEDEN.

POLICE CONDUCTED OVERNIGHT RAIDS
AROUND STOCKHOLM QUESTIONING
PEOPLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CASE AND THEY HAVE NOT RULED OUT
THERE WILL BE OTHER ARRESTS.

WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE
ARE FURTHER PERSONS INVOLVED.

WE ARE NOT EXCLUDING THAT.

WE ARE WORKING ON A
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SEE
WHETHER THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY
THAT FURTHER INDIVIDUALS ARE
INVOLVED.

THE MAN IS ACCUSED OF STEALING A
BEER TRUCK EARLY ON THE DAY ON
FRIDAY RAMMING INTO CROWD BEFORE
CRASHING INTO A POPULAR
DEPARTMENT STORE.

POLICE FOUND A DEVICE THAT COULD
BE AN INCENDIARY DEVICE OR BOMB
IN SWEDISH PUBLIC BROADCAST SAYS
IT WAS A BAG OF EXPLOSIVES AND
THE ATTACKERS SUFFERED BURNS
FROM THESE EXPLOSIVES AFTER HE
FAILED TO DETONATE IT PROPERLY.

NO ONE HAS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK
THOUGH NEWS OF YESTERDAY'S
ATTACK SPREADS QUICKLY ON ICE
AND SLEET SOCIAL MEDIA COUNTS.

JULIE WHAT HAS THE REACTION
BEEN TO THIS?

SHOP THEN STUNNED.

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE TODAY
GATHERING OF MEMORIAL AT THE
CRASH SITE OUTSIDE A DEPARTMENT
STORE.

MOURNERS INCLUDING THE PRIME
MINISTER HIMSELF LAYING FLOWERS
AND OFFERING PRAYERS.

FLAGS ARE FLYING AT HALF-STAFF
TO COMMEMORATE THE VICTIMS.

MONDAY WAS DECLARED A NATIONAL
DAY OF MOURNING AND THE CROWN
PRINCES VISITED THIS SITE THE
PRIME MINISTER SAYING CITIZENS
WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND HE HAS
BEEN WALKING THE STREETS
SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN STOCKHOLM.

HE SAYS ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT
THIS IS INDEED OR WAS A
TERRORIST ATTACK JULIE.

JULIE BRYAN LLENAS THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

THE FBI IS NOW REVIEWING THE
HANDLING OF THOUSANDS OF
TERRORISM RELATED -- FOLLOWING A
STRING OF RECENT TERRORIST
ATTACKS.

THE AGENCY IS TRYING TO ENSURE
TIPS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
WERE PROPERLY INVESTIGATED AND
NO OBVIOUS RED FLAGS OR MISS
WITH THE REVIEW FOLLOWS ATTACKS
BY PEOPLE WHO ARE ONCE ON THE
FED'S RADAR INCLUDING THEIR LAND
OF NIGHTCLUB SHOOTER OMAR MATEEN
AND THE MAN WHO OPENED FIRE FORT
LAUDERDALE AIRPORT IN JANUARY
ESTEBAN SANTIAGO.

SEEMS THE FBI IS FACING
CHALLENGES IN PREDICTING WHICH
OF THE THOUSANDS OF TIPS THEY
RECEIVE ANNUALLY MIGHT ONE DAY
MATERIALIZE INTO A VIABLE VIABLE
THREAT.

U.S. TO THE U.S.

MATURE
CONFIRMING AN AMERICAN SOLDIER
HAS BEEN KILLED IN ACTION IN
AFGHANISTAN.

THE ATTACK APPARENTLY HAPPENING
IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY DURING AN OPERATION
AGAINST AN ISIS AFFILIATED GROUP
SPECIAL OPS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING
THEIR FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.

HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THE TERROR
GROUP IS CONTAINED INSIDE TO
DISTRICT DEVICES REMAINS A BIG
THREAT.

THEY'RE CURRENTLY MORE AMERICAN
TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN IN IRAQ
AND SYRIA COMBINED.

TWO ACTIVE-DUTY MARINES
RECEIVING THE FIRST PUNISHMENT
IN CONNECTION WITH NUDE
PHOTOGRAPHS THAT WERE SHARED ON
LINE.

THE DISCIPLINE THEY NOW WILL
FACE PLUS THIS MAN CONSIDERED
ARMED AND VERY DANGEROUS.

WHY POLICE ARE INTENSIFYING
THEIR SEARCH FOR A MAN THEY SAY
HAS BECOME HIGHLY AGITATED BY
NATIONAL POLITICS.

MY DAD ACTUALLY KNOWS HIM SO
IT'S EVEN MORE AWKWARD THAT
SOMEONE SO INNOCENT COULD DO
SOMETHING SO TERRIFYING
( ♪ )
JULIE THE U.S. NAVY DECIDED TO
GROUND ALL P45 TRAINING JETS
INDEFINITELY AFTER AN EXCLUSIVE
FOX REPORT THAT NAVY PILOTS
REFUSE TO FLY THE JETS BECAUSE
THEY SAID THE OXYGEN SYSTEM WAS
TAINTED AND THE AIR OF THE
PILOTS WERE BREATHING WAS --
THERE NEARLY 200 AND SERGEANT
WICKER OF THE HOUSE ARMY
COMMITTEE ADDRESSED THE ISSUE
TODAY.

LISTEN.

I'M ENCOURAGED THAT A SERIOUS
PROBLEM HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED
AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH
BE TAKEN TO ARRIVING AT A
SOLUTION.

THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY TAKEN
APART.

THE KIND OF ANALYSIS THAT CAN BE
DONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE
BEFORE.

I THINK WE ARE IN A POSITION
WHERE THERE IS EVERY HOPE THAT
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE PROBLEM.

JULIE THE NAVY PREVIOUSLY
ANNOUNCED A THREE-DAY PAUSE TO
THE TRAINING SCHEDULES WHICH WAS
BY THE WAY DUE TO EXPIRE MONDAY.

A MASSIVE MANHUNT UNDERWAY RIGHT
NOW FOR SUCH A CONSIDERED A
NATIONAL THREAT BY LAW
ENFORCEMENT POLICE ARE CURRENTLY
LOOKING FOR THIS MAN 32-YEAR-OLD
JOSEPH JAKUBOWSKI AFTER THEY SAY
HE STOLE FIREARMS FROM A GUN
SHOP AND THEN THREATEN TO USE
THEM AGAINST SEVERAL -- HE'S
ALSO THE USE OF SENDING AN ANGRY
MANIFESTO TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
OF COURSE VIDEOTAPING ALL THE
EVIDENCE.

WILL CARR JOINS ME LIVE FROM OUR
WESTERN BUREAU WITH MORE ON
THIS.

HOW DID THIS ALL START?

JULIA TOOK AUTHORITIES A
COUPLE OF DAYS TO PIECE A
TIMELINE TOGETHER.

EVERYTHING STARTED TUESDAY WHEN
JOSEPH JAKUBOWSKI WAS IN THE
POST OFFICE IN JANESVILLE
WISCONSIN AND CELL PHONE VIDEO
SHOWS HIM ADDRESSING A MANIFESTO
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP TO TAKE A
LISTEN TO THE MOMENTS JUST
BEFORE HE PUTS THE MANIFESTO
INTO THE MAIL.

REVOLUTION.

TIME FOR CHANGE.

APRIL 4, 2017 AT 543.

YOU SEE MY NAME.

STAMPED, GAME TIME.

JAKUBOWSKI'S ALLEGEDLY STOLE
GUNS FROM A LOCAL GUN SHOP
INCLUDING A RIFLE.

HE HAD A BULLETPROOF VEST AND A
MILITARY STYLE HAMMOCK.

POLICE BELIEVE THAT JAKUBOWSKI
TORCHED HIS CAR AND DISAPPEARED
IN THURSDAY'S SO-CALLED
ASSOCIATE TOLD LOCAL AUTHORITIES
THAT JAKUBOWSKI MADE A VAGUE
THREAT ABOUT A SCHOOL BECAUSE A
NUMBER OF WISCONSIN SCHOOLS TO
CLOSE ON FRIDAY AND AT LEAST ONE
CHURCH DECIDED NOT TO HOLD
SERVICES THIS WEEKEND.

THE SAME ASSOCIATE TOLD
AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE 161 PAGE
MANIFESTO.

THE ROCK COUNTY SHERIFF TELLS ME
PART OF THE CALLED MEMBERS OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT QUOTE AGENTS OF
THE 1% WHO ENSLAVE AND KEEP THE
POPULATION DOWN.

WITH ALL OF THAT IN MY JULIE THE
FBI IS OFFERING A 10,000-DOLLAR
REWARD.

JULIE WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THIS GUY?

IT'S AMAZING TO ME THEY HAVE NOT
FOUND HIM.

WE KNOW HIS NAME AND WE HAVE
SEEN HIS FACE AND NOBODY HAS
COME FORWARD.

WE KNOW THAT HE IS WELL-KNOWN
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

HE HAS MORE THAN 30 TRAFFIC
CITATIONS.

HE ALSO HAS RESISTING OR ARREST
IN TRYING TO DISARM A POLICE
OFFICER.

NOW HE'S CONSIDERED ARMED AND
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND THE
LOCAL SHERIFF TOLD ME IF ANYBODY
IN THE AREA HAPPENS TO SEE HIM
THEY ARE ASKED TO SIMPLY CALL
911 TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE.

JULIE DID HE AT ANY POINT A
MENTION OF WANTING TO OFF
POLITICIANS FOR THE GOOD OF THE
PEOPLE OR THE GOOD OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE?

VSO VENGEANCE APPARENTLY OUT FOR
POLITICIANS.

THE SHERIFF TELLS ME THAT HE
MADE THREATS AGAINST LAW
ENFORCEMENT AND THE MANIFESTO.

THEY'RE NOT RELEASING THE
SPECIFIC TYPES OF THREATS OR THE
SPECIFIC DETAILS BUT 161 PAGES
IN THAT MANIFESTO IN MANY OF THE
SENTIMENTS ARE ANTI-GOVERNMENT
ANTI-LAW ENFORCEMENT IN HIS
WRITINGS.

JULIE WILL CARR FROM LOS
ANGELES THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THAT'S DISTURBING.

CONGRESS IS OFF FOR A LITTLE
BREAK BUT AN AGENDA IS WAITING
IN WASHINGTON INCLUDING HEALTH
CARE REFORM AND THE POTENTIAL
THREAT FOR A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
HOW LIKELY IS THAT ANYWAY?

WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT PLUS
DEMONSTRATORS LINED THE SIDEWALK
OUTSIDE OF THE SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER'S HOME STATE OFFICE
ROWLING FOR HEALTH CARE, NOT
REPEAL BUT EXPANSION.

OF ALL THE FORMS OF
HEALTH CARE IS THE MOTION
DOCKING AND INHUMAN.

TUNE I'M JULIE BANDERAS.

IT'S TIME FOR THE TOP OF THE
NEWS.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S
DECISION TO LAUNCH AIRSTRIKES IN
SYRIA GETTING PRAISE AND
CRITICISM ARE MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS SOME THINKING THE
MATTER NEEDS TO BE DEBATED ONCE
THEY RETURN FROM EASTER RECESS
IN TWO WEEKS THROUGH PUBLIC
WEIGHING IN AT A TOWN HALL IN
CALIFORNIA TODAY SAYING WHILE
SUCH AN ATTACK MAY BE NECESSARY
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS NEED TO MAKE
THE DECISION, NOT THE PRESIDENT
ALONE.

WHAT A CHAR AL-ASSAD DID IS A
WAR CRIME.

IT IS AN ATROCITY.

IT IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
BUT THE FOUNDERS WERE VERY CLEAR
THAT IF THIS COUNTRY NEEDS TO
COMMIT TO WORK NEEDS TO BE UNDER
THE SAY-SO OF THE CONGRESS
REPRESENTING ALL THE PEOPLE AND
NOT THE DECISION OF ONE
INDIVIDUAL.

JULIE AND IN KENTUCKY HEALTH
CARE WAS ON THE MINDS OF MANY
PROTESTERS OUTSIDE THE SENATE
MAJORITY LEADER'S OFFICE.

GATHERED IN LOUISVILLE FOR A
SIDEWALK TOWN MEETING IN FAVOR
OF A SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE
PLAN.

IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK YOU CAN
SAY THAT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
HIS ADMINISTRATION HOSTING THE
MINISTER OF CHINA A SUCCESSFUL
VOTE ON HIS SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE AND OF COURSE THE
MISSILE STRIKE AGAINST SYRIA BUT
IN THE SHADOW OF ALL OF THAT THE
ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF
RUSSIA'S INFLUENCE IN THE U.S.
ELECTION AND THE PRESIDENT'S
UNPROVEN CLAIMS THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION TAPPED HIS PHONE.

NOW HE APPEARS TO HAVE LOST A
BIG ALLY ON THE HILL.

JULIE U.S. RELATIONS WITH
RUSSIA CONTINUED TO WORSEN THE
SECRETARY OF STATE REX TILLERSON
IS PREPARING TO TRAVEL TO MOSCOW
NEXT WEEK AND CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATORS ARE EXAMINING
RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

NOW THOSE CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BECOME
CONTROVERSIAL DEVIN NUNES IS
RECUSING HIMSELF AGAINST THE
COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION INTO
RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE IN THE
PRESIDENT'S ELECTION BECAUSE AN
INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER HE
MADE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES OF
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

NUNES CALLED THAT INVESTIGATION
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.

IR TO GIVE A STATEMENT ON
THAT.

I EXPECT THIS TO GET DONE VERY
QUICKLY.

AND YOUR STATEMENT THAT YOU
DID NOTHING WRONG.

ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

CONGRESSMAN MIKE CONAWAY SENIOR
MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE WILL NOW
LEAD THE INVESTIGATION.

CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS ALSO
EXAMINING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIM THAT
PRESIDENT OBAMA WIRETAPPED HIM
AN OUT CALLS ON SUSAN RICE TO
TESTIFY.

THAT ISSUE HER A REQUEST TO NAME
TRUMP ASSOCIATES CAUGHT AND
SURVEILLANCE.

THAT SURVEILLANCE IS ROUTINE AND
WHEN AMERICANS ARE CAUGHT
SPEAKING WITH FOREIGN NATIONALS
THE NAMES ARE MASTER PROTECTED
IN A SPREAD RICE CLAIMS SHE
ASKED FOR THE NAMES TO BETTER
UNDERSTAND THE MAIN INTELLIGENCE
AND MAINTAIN SHE NEVER REBUILT
THOSE NAMES PUBLICLY.

JULIE RICH EDSON WILL THANK
YOU.

CONGRESS HAS ADJOURNED FOR TWO
WEEKS FOR THE EASTER HOLIDAY
THAT LAWMAKERS WILL HAVE PLENTY
OF WORK WAITING FOR THEM WHEN
THEY RETURN INCLUDING THE BATTLE
OVER OBAMACARE.

HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN
INSISTING THEY ARE CLOSE TO
REACHING AN AGREEMENT, VERY
CLOSE HE SAID BETWEEN
CONSERVATIVE AND MODERATE WINGS
OF THE PARTY IN REPEALING THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HOWEVER HE
SPOKE AT THE REPUBLICAN CORPSMEN
WHO SAID NOT NECESSARILY THAT
CLOSE TO IT WHICH IS GOOD AND
WHAT IS THE LATEST?

PETER DOOCY JOINS US FROM D.C..
HOW ARE LAWMAKERS EXPLAINING THE
DELAY IN REPEALING OBAMACARE?

JULIE WE WATCHED HOW ONE
REPUBLICAN DID IT IN A TOWN HALL
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE CONGRESSMAN
US SOMETIMES ROWDY CROWD THAT IT
IS TAKING A WHILE FOR HIS PARTY
TO UNITE AROUND A REPLACEMENT.

WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS RIGHT
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FOR --
PERFECT PLAN.

OUR SYSTEM WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO
BE PERFECT.

IF OUR SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO
MAKE THE BEST LAW ACCESSIBLE TO
MOST PEOPLE.

THERE IS ONE MODERATE
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN CASTING
DOUBT ON SPEAKER RYAN'S
REASSURANCES THAT THE REPEAL AND
REPLACE EFFORT IS STILL ON TRACK
NOW THAT SOME OF THE FREEDOM
CAUCUS BACKS AN AMENDMENT THAT
LEADERSHIP SAYS THEY CAN LIVE
WITH.

I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE
AS CLOSE AS MANY WOULD SAY ON
THE HEALTH CARE BILL RIGHT NOW.

THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT OFFERED
WHICH ON BALANCE WAS GOOD
$15 BILLION OVER EIGHT YEARS FOR
HIGH-RISK POOLS BUT IN MY VIEW
THERE OTHER STRUCTURAL CLAUSES
OF THE LEGISLATION.

TODAY'S HE WARNED HIS LEADERS
AGAINST RUSHING TO REPEAL.

JULIE HOW LIKELY IS A
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AT THE END
OF THE MONTH?

JULIE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING AT
THE WHITE HOUSE STOPS ASKING
THEM TO FUND THE BORDER WALL AND
CUT OUT MONEY TO DOMESTIC
PROGRAMS THEY'RE WILLING TO PLAY
BALL.

A SPOKESMAN FOR THE SENATE
MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER
SAID SAID THIS QUOTE THE ONLY
THING THAT COULD DERAIL THAT
PROCESS IS THE WHITE HOUSE
INSISTING ON THEIR EXTRANEOUS
DEMANDS WHICH WOULD MEAN
BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION.

IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE LAWMAKERS
FEEL THE NEED TO CUT RECESSION
OR WERE TO WORK ON THE BUDGET OR
TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF FORCE IN
SYRIA EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY THEY
WANT TO BE INVOLVED.

WE CAN'T ACT ON AUTHORIZATION
UNLESS THE PRESIDENT ASKED FOR
AUTHORIZATION SO THERE'S NOTHING
FOR US TO STAY HERE TO ACT ON.

THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT
PRESIDENTS COMING FORWARD WITH A
REQUEST TO CONGRESS.

IN A LETTER TO LAWMAKERS
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WILL
KEEP THEM UPDATED ABOUT ANY
FUTURE ACTIVITY GETS ASSAD THAT
DID NOT ASK FOR AUTHORIZATION.

JULIE PETER DOOCY THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

THE HIGHEST COURT IN ONE STATE
IS WEIGHING A VERY SENSITIVE
QUESTION.

SHOULD THE STATE BE ABLE TO STEP
IN AND DETAIN IMMIGRANTS FOR
I.C.E.?

HE WAS FACED WITH PROLONGED
UNLAWFUL CONSTITUTIONAL ARRESTS
