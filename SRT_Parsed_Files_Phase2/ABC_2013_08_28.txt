THIS IS "WORLD NEWS."

TONIGHT TAKING AIM, AMERICA
WEIGHS MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
SYRIA AND TONIGHT WE TAKE YOU
INSIDE THE MIND OF THE LEADER
ACCUSED OF UNLEASHING CHEMICAL
WAR.

COULD HE MAKE A DIRECT HIT ON
THE UNITED STATES?

OUR MARTHA RADDATZ IS IN THE
REGION WITH THE NEWS.

EXTREME WEATHER FORCING
CHILDREN TO COOL OFF IN ICE
CUBES, SCHOOLS CLOSED IN SIX
STATES AND OUT WEST HAVE
FEARLESS FIREFIGHTERS STOPPED
THE BLAZE NEAR YOSEMITE.

WATCH DOG, WE FIND $1
MILLION OF TAXPAYER MONEY GOING
TO WASTE IN A CLOSET.

TRYING TO GET ACTION TONIGHT.

HIDDEN WORLD, THE CLOSED
LIFE OF THE AMISH, IS IT FINALLY
EXPOSED AND IS THERE REALLY AN
AMISH MAFIA?

GOOD EVENING.

AS WE BEGIN TONIGHT, THE CLOCK
IS TICKING ON U.S. MILITARY
ACTION IN SYRIA.

THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS A DECISION
IS NEAR AND U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE
IN POSITION.

AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS
ALSO JOINING THE DEBATE ABOUT
WHAT KIND OF ACTION AND EXACTLY
WHEN.

THE GOAL, TO STOP A MAN USING
BRUTAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS 5,000
MILES AWAY.

ABC'S MARTHA RADDATZ HAS IT ALL
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.

THE CENTER OF THIS HORROR.

A BRUTAL DICTATOR WHO THE VICE
PRESIDENT SAID TODAY IS
UNDENIABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
GASSING HIS OWN INNOCENT PEOPLE.

THERE IS NO DOUBT WHO IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HEINOUS USE
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA.

THE SYRIAN REGIME.

NO QUESTION THAT THE U.S. IS
READY TO STRIKE A PUNISHING BLOW
TO ASSAD.

U.S. WAR SHIPS ARE IN PLACE,
CRUISE MISSILES AT THE READY,
THE TARGETS IN SYRIA SELECTED.

YOU'RE READY TO GO LIKE THAT?

WE'RE READY TO GO LIKE THAT.

IN RESPONSE?

THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS HUNDREDS
OF TONS OF MUSTARD GAS AND STOCK
PILES OF SARIN.

ADD TO THAT 100,000 MISSILES AND
ROCKETS INCLUDING THOUSANDS OF
POWERFUL SCUD MISSILES WHICH
COULD REACH ANY TARGET IN
NEIGHBORING ISRAEL.

TODAY IN ISRAEL A RUN ON GAS
MASKS, REQUESTS INCREASING FOUR
FOLD.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU SAYING ISRAEL IS READY
FOR ANY SCENARIO AND IF WE
IDENTIFY ANY ATTEMPT WHATSOEVER
TO HARM US, WE WILL RESPOND IN
STRENGTH.

THERE IS NO ONE STRONGER IN THIS
REGION.

NUCLEAR ARMED ISRAEL HAS THE
MOST ADVANCED BALLISTIC
MISSILES, CRUISE MISSILES AND
MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS MAKING
EXPERTS BELIEVE ASSAD WOULD BE
CRAZY TO TRY TO HIT ISRAEL.

IT MIGHT CREATE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR ISRAEL THAT THEY
WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF AND PERHAPS ASSAD WOULD RUE
THE DAY THAT HE GAVE THEM THIS
OPPORTUNITY.

ENOUGH TO RAIN CHEMICALS DOWN
ON HIS PEOPLE KNOWING THE
POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES THERE IS
NO TELLING WHAT HE WOULD DO IF
CREWS MISSILES START RAINING
DOWN ON HIS OWN REGIME.

MARTHA RADDATZ JOINS ME FROM
JERUSALEM TONIGHT.

ARE THEY GOING TO TARGET HIM?

THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TARGET
HIM PERSONALLY.

THEY HAVE MADE A POINT OF THAT
BUT CERTAINLY MILITARY TARGETS
IN HIS REGIME.

THAT'S GOT TO MAKE HIS NERVOUS.

I REMEMBER MEETING HIM AND
INTERVIEWING HIM.

I SHOULD REMIND EVERYBODY HE
GREW UP A LOT OF HIS LIFE IN
LONDON.

HE'S A PHYSICIAN, EDUCATED
THERE.

WHY WOULDN'T THEY TARGET HIM?

WHAT DO THEY EXPECT FROM HIM
NEXT?

I THINK THEY'RE AFRAID OF
REACTION AND THEY DON'T WANT
REGIME CHANGE.

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY
CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

THIS IS A LIMITED STRIKE.

IT'S ONLY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER
CHEMICAL ATTACKS.

THEY DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED
IN THIS CIVIL WAR BUT IT MUST BE
EXTRAORDINARY FOR YOU TO LOOK AT
THIS MAN AS YOU SAY EDUCATED IN
LONDON WHO IS DOING THESE KINDS
OF BRUTAL, BRUTAL THINGS.

HE'S SOMEONE WHO NEVER
EXPECTED TO TAKE OVER FROM HIS
FATHER.

THANK YOU SO MUCH, MARTHA
RADDATZ AGAIN REPORTING FROM
JERUSALEM TONIGHT.

NOW THE NEWS BACK HERE AT
HOME, THERE ARE HOPEFUL SIGNS
TONIGHT THAT FIREFIGHTERS MAY
HAVE SAVED YOSEMITE NATIONAL
PARK IN THE NICK OF TIME.

THE FIRE STOPPED BEFORE IT
REACHED THE GATES.

ABC'S NEAL KARLINSKY NOW ON THE
FRONT LINE ONCE AGAIN.

FROM INSIDE THE FIRE ZONE
TONIGHT WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME
OFFICIALS BELIEVE THEY HAVE
TURNED A CORNER ON THIS ONE.

THEY SAY THE FIRE IS ROUGHLY 20
PERCENT CONTAINED.

THE AREAS OF CONCERN RIGHT NOW
ARE TO THE NORTHWEST, TOWARDS
THE CITY OF TUOLUMNE.

THEY BELIEVE THAT HAVE THAT ONE
FAIRLY WELL IN HAND AND ALSO TO
THE EAST INTO DENSE FOREST LAND
THAT OFFICIALS SAY THEY'RE NOT
CONCERNED ABOUT.

AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WHO LIVE
IN THE AREA HAVE BEEN DEALING
WITH DENSE HEAVY SMOKE FOR MORE
THAN A WEEK NOW.

SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN CLOSED.

TOURISM IS WAY DOWN.

WE TALKED TO ONE BUSINESS OWNER
WHO SAYS HE'S LOST ABOUT 98
PERCENT OF THE BUSINESS HE
NORMALLY HAS THIS TIME OF YEAR.

HOWEVER, YOSEMITE, THE HEART OF
IT, REMAINS WIDE OPEN WITH BLUE
SKIES, CLEAR SAILING, THEY SAY,
FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

STILL HOPING PEOPLE WILL
COME.

THANK YOU, NEIL.

THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

WHAT A DEBT OWED THOSE
FIREFIGHTERS.

THE MIDWEST LIKE A
CONVECTION OVEN.

LOOK AT THIS MAP.

HEAT WARNINGS STRETCHING FROM
NEBRASKA AND ILLINOIS TO
MINNESOTA WHERE THE TEMPERATURE
FELT LIKE MORE THAN 100 DEGREES.

NEAR RECORD TEMPERATURES FORCED
SOME SCHOOLS TO CLOSE TODAY, AND
THE SCHOOLS THAT WERE OPEN HAD
FANS ON FULL BLAST AND THEY GAVE
CHILDREN POPSICLES AND ICE TO
KEEP COOL.

THERE MAY NOT BE RELIEF UNTIL
THIS WEEKEND.

THERE IS A LOT OF CLEANING
UP TO DO IN PHOENIX TONIGHT
AFTER AN EERY DUST STORM, A
HABOOB.

IT LOOKED LIKE A HUGE DOOMSDAY
TIDAL WAVE 4,000 FEET HIGH
SLOWLY MOVING OVER THE AREA,
DAYLIGHT SUDDENLY VANISHING, A
PICTURE CAPTURED THE CLOUD
MOVING TOWARD A BASEBALL STADIUM
PUSHED BY 60 MILE PER HOUR
WINDS.

THE STADIUM CLEARED OUT.

AROUND TOWN, VISIBILITY WAS LESS
THAN 100 FEET.

SHE HAD SO MANY ROOTING FOR
HER AND NOW TONIGHT THE LITTLE
GIRL WHO SPENT SIX MONTHS IN THE
HOSPITAL GETTING A NEW SET OF
LUNGS IS HOME AND LOOKING
FORWARD TO STARTING HER NEW
LIFE.

ABC'S LINZIE JANIS ON A
HOMECOMING.

MURNAGHAN IS HOME TONIGHT AFTER
TWO LUNG TRANSPLANTS AND MORE
THAN SIX MONTHS IN THE HOSPITAL.

SARAH IS LOOKING FORWARD TO
BEING A REGULAR LITTLE KID.

AGO SARAH WAS DYING OF LATE
STAGE CYSTIC FIBROSIS AND THE
MURNAGHANS SUED TO GET HER ON
THE ADULT TRANSPLANT LIST,
SOMETHING SHE WAS DENIED.

BECAUSE OF A LAW THAT
PRIORITIZES CHILDREN 12 AND
OLDER.

HER PARENTS REACHED OUT TO THE
MEDIA MONTHS AGO IN HOPES OF
HIGHLIGHTING HER PLIGHT AND
SPARKED A NATIONAL DEBATE OVER
TRANSPLANT RULES.

IN JUNE, A FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERED
A TEMPORARY HALT TO THE SO
CALLED UNDER 12 RULE AND SARAH
GOT HER LUNGS.

AFTER HER LITTLE BODY REJECTED
THE FIRST PAIR, DOCTORS TRIED A
SECOND TRANSPLANT THREE DAYS
LATER.

SO FAR THEY SAY HER PROGNOSIS IS
GOOD.

HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE HOME?

GOOD.

THEY'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE
UNDER 12 RULE BUT SOME SAY
SARAH'S CASE MAY HAVE SET A
PRECEDENT FOR ALLOWING MEDICAL
DECISIONS TO BE MADE IN THE
COURTROOM.

PEOPLE MIGHT RIGHTLY ASK
WHETHER IT'S FAIR FOR LUNGS TO
BE ALLOCATED FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN
CREATE THE BIGGEST MEDIA SPLASH.

TO MAKE THE BEST OF HER NEW
LIFE, SHARING HER PLANS FOR
RECOVERY IN HER FIRST POST
TRANSPLANT INTERVIEW WITH CNN.

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

I'M JUST GOING FOR POSSIBLE,
AND WHAT'S IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT
NOW IS POSSIBLE.

BEING A FIGHTER.

LINZIE JANIS, ABC NEWS,
PENNSYLVANIA.

LOOKING AT THE POSSIBLE
TONIGHT.

GINGER ZEE.

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN WANTS THE
STATE THAT PUT HIM ON TRIAL TO
PAY A LOT OF HIS LEGAL COSTS, NO
SMALL AMOUNT AND FLORIDA MAY
HAVE TO DO IT.

HERE'S ABC'S MATT GUTMAN.

A FREE MAN BUT HIS NOT GUILTY
VERDICT COULD COST THE STATE OF
FLORIDA A PRETTY PENNY.

S.
 WE'RE STILL TALLYING UP THE
FIGURES BUT IT'S GOING TO BE
$200,000 OR $300,000 IN COST
MONEY.

LAST MONTH OF A SINGLE COUNT OF
SECOND DEGREE MURDER AFTER
SHOOTING 17-YEAR-OLD TRAYVON
MARTIN IN FEBRUARY 2012.

ACCORDING TO FLORIDA LAW,
BECAUSE OF THAT HE HAS THE RIGHT
TO EXPENSE, QUOTE,
REASONABLE EXPENSES BUT NOT
LAWYERS FEES.

HE CAN EXPENSE EXPERT WITNESSES,
TRAVEL, PHOTO COPIES AND
POSSIBLY THE 3-D PHOTO USED IN
THE COURTROOM.

HIS LAWYERS EXPECT A FIGHT.

THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY
OUTSTANDING THAT HAS NOT BEEN
COVERED.

ATTORNEYS SAY THEIR CLIENT HAS
BEEN LIVING OFF OF DONATIONS TO
HIS WEBSITE.

THE FEE FOR THEIR SERVICES COULD
HAVE TOPPED $2 MILLION.

AS FOR HIS WHEREABOUTS, THEY ARE
STILL UNKNOWN.

HIS LAWYERS SAY HE'S IN HIDING,
BUT HE'S BEEN SPOTTED LAST MONTH
IN TEXAS BY A STATE TROOPER WHO
DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHO HE WAS.

YOU DIDN'T SEE MY NAME?

NO.

WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

THIS PHOTO WITH THE OWN OF A GUN
FACTORY IN FLORIDA, THE SAME
MANUFACTURER THAT MADE THE GUN
USED TO SHOOT MARTIN.

HE MAY BE BACK IN COURT SOON,
HIS WIFE FACES A PERJURY CHARGE
FOR LYING TO THE COURT ABOUT
DONATIONS.

HIS WIFE PLEADED NOT GUILTY AND
HAS A COURT HEARING TOMORROW.

MATT GUTMAN, ABC NEWS, MIAMI.

NOW TONIGHT WE HEAR A FORMER
PRESIDENT TALK ABOUT THE MOMENT
SOMEONE TRIED TO ASSASSINATE
HIM.

IT'S A LONG LOST TAPE OF
PRESIDENT GERALD FORD
TESTIFYING, DESCRIBING THE
MOMENT BACK IN 1975 WHEN THAT
STRANGE WOMAN IN RED, A MEMBER
OF THE MANSON FAMILY CALLED
SQUEAKY FROMME EMERGED FROM A
CROWD IN SACRAMENTO.

HE SAYS HE LOOKED AT HER FACE.

HE DESCRIBED IT AS WEATHERED AND
THEN HE SAYS HE SAW THE GUN.

HERE ARE HIS WORDS.

I HAD THE IMPRESSION SHE
WANTED TO SPEAK TO ME OR SHAKE
MY HAND AND AS I MOVED TO EITHER
SHAKE HANDS OR SPEAK TO HER, I
THEN NOTICED THE GUN.

SQUEAKY FROMME WORE A KIND OF
NUN'S RED ROBE THAT DAY.

SHE SAID SHE ONLY WANTED TO GET
FORD'S ATTENTION TO DISCUSS RED
WOOD TREES WITH HIM.

SHE DIDN'T FIRE A SHOT, SERVED
34 YEARS IN PRISON AND IS NOW
OUT ON PAROLE LIVING IN UPSTATE
NEW YORK.

AND FROM WASHINGTON TONIGHT,
THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM SPENDING
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER
MONEY SO EVERYONE CAN WORK
FASTER ONLINE.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE $1 MILLION WE
FOUND GOING TO WASTE IN JUST ONE
CLOSET.

ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR DOZENS
OF TEACHERS.

OUR WATCH DOG, DAVID KERLEY,
BACK ON THE CASE OF THE COSTLY
PROGRAM.

ON THE INTERNET.

A FAST CONNECTION.

AND WE NEED IT TO REMAIN
COMPETITIVE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY
SAYS THE PRESIDENT.

TO HARNESS THE FULL POWER OF
THE INTERNET.

THAT MEANS FASTER AND MORE
WIDELY AVAILABLE BROADBAND.

ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE
GOVERNMENT CAME UP WITH $7
BILLION AND THOUSANDS OF
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HOOKED UP.

TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

THESE BOXES STACKED IN A WEST
VIRGINIA CLOSET ARE BLAZING
FAST, HIGH SPEED ROUTERS.

YOU PAID FOR THEM, 20 GRAND
EACH.

THEY'RE UNUSED.

THE STATE BOUGHT TOO MANY AND
THE WRONG ONES.

ONE AND A QUARTER MILLION JUST
IN THIS CLOSET GATHERING DUST
FOR THREE YEARS NOW, ENOUGH FOR
A YEAR'S PAY FOR 30 TEACHERS.

THAT'S NOT ALL.

CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS
QUESTIONED OTHER SPENDING ASKING
IF UP TO $230 MILLION WAS
WASTED.

IT'S THE PEOPLE'S DOLLARS
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

NONE OF IT SHOULD BE WASTED.

IN THIS CASE IT'S OBSCENE.

ALONE, $14 MILLION WASTED
ACCORDING TO THE STATE AUDITOR
THERE.

CRITICS WORRY ABOUT WHERE THE
MONEY WAS SPENT.

WHEN THEY DID USE THOSE ROUTERS
IN WEST VIRGINIA, THEY PUT SOME
IN PLACES LIKE THIS, THE SMALL
COMMUNITY LIBRARY IN
SHEPHERDSTOWN.

THERE ARE LESS THAN 5,000 ANNUAL
VISITORS TO THIS LIBRARY WHO NOW
HAVE SCREAMING FAST SERVICE, BUT
TWO LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS NEARBY
GOT NONE OF THOSE ROUTERS.

OF COURSE THE HIGH SCHOOLS
SHOULD GET IT.

I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT
REALLY DOES A GOOD JOB SPENDING
MONEY AT ALL.

DOING ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THE
MONEY IS WELL SPENT?

WE WENT TO ASK A TOP OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL
RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE
SPENDING, LARRY STRICKLING.

CAN WE ASK HIM A COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS BEFORE THE HEARING?

NO, NO.

BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS --
 WHAT HAVE WE GOT FOR $2.8
MILLION?

HE DID DEFEND THE PROGRAM.

WE'RE QUITE HAPPY WITH THE
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SAY THEY
STILL CAN'T GET ANSWERS, AND ASK
HOW MUCH REALLY WAS WASTED?

DAVID KERLEY, ABC NEWS,
WASHINGTON.

AND WE THANK ALL OF YOU WHO
WROTE US ABOUT OUR WATCH DOG
REPORTS ON FACEBOOK LAST NIGHT.

WE WANT TO HEAR MORE OF YOUR
THOUGHTS.

KEEP THEM COMING.

STILL AHEAD HERE ON "WORLD
NEWS," A CLOSE SOCIETY UNDER THE
SPOTLIGHT TONIGHT, SECRETS
REVEALED.

DO THE AMISH REALLY HAVE A
MAFIA?

AND THE IMAGE ROCKETED AROUND
THE WORLD, THE STORY BEHIND THIS
NOW VERY FAMOUS PICTURE.

I LOVE IT!

NOW THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT
TO US.

THERE ARE ABOUT 250,000
AMISH LIVING PEACEFUL, SIMPLE
LIVES RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES.

THE GROUP THAT SHUNS THE MODERN
WORLD SAYS TONIGHT THAT A
REALITY SHOW ABOUT THEM IS
ANYTHING BUT REAL.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS DECIDED TO
LOOK AT WHAT'S BEHIND THE AMISH
MAFIA.

COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, SOME
50,000 AMISH LIVE AS THEY HAVE
FOR NEARLY 300 YEARS, SIMPLY AND
HUMBLY, ALMOST NO MODERN
TECHNOLOGY.

BUT A HIT REALITY SHOW IS
PAINTING THIS PEACEFUL CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY AS BRIMMING WITH
INTRIGUE AND CONTROVERSY.

THE MAFIA OPERATES OUTSIDE OF
AMISH LAW.

IN ITS SECOND SEASON, AIRING
TONIGHT ON DISCOVERY CHANNEL
FOLLOWS THIS MAN, "LEBANON
LEVI," AND HIS ASSISTANTS, WHO
PURPORTEDLY LOOK AFTER THE AMISH
COMMUNITY HERE IN LANCASTER
COUNTY, AND DO THE DIRTY WORK
THE CHURCH CAN'T.

LEVI'S A GREAT GUY, BUT IF
YOU CROSS HIM, HE'S NOT AFRAID
TO CRACK SOME SKULLS.

SYSTEM THAT TAKES THE MATTERS OF
THEIR COMMUNITY INTO THEIR OWN
HANDS.

THEY ALSO KEEP AN EYE ON THE
TEENAGERS, WHO TAKE TIME OFF TO
EXPERIENCE THE OUTSIDE WORLD
BEFORE COMMITTING THEIR LIVES TO
THE SECT.

I MAKE SURE THE PEACE IS
BEING KEPT AND EVERYBODY IS
OBEYING THE RULES.

AMISH DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE
AMISH MAFIA.

MUCH OF THE SHOW'S CONTENT HAS
BEEN STRONGLY CRITICIZED BY
AMISH SCHOLARS.

QUESTIONS HAVE EVEN BEEN RAISED
AS TO WHETHER SOME OF THE CAST
MEMBERS ARE ACTORS.

BUT PRODUCERS SAY THE MAIN CAST
MEMBERS AREN'T ACTORS, THEY JUST
HAVEN'T BEEN BAPTIZED IN THE
AMISH CHURCH SO TECHNICALLY THE
STRICT RULES DON'T APPLY.

SO WHY HAVE YOU NOT DECIDED NOT
TO GET BAPTIZED?

I'D RATHER HAVE A COMPUTER
AND WATCH TV, MAYBE.

DRIVE A CAR, AND NOT DRIVE A
HORSE.

REAL REALITY TV, THEN THE
"CENTURIES-OLD PLAIN" LIFESTYLE
CERTAINLY ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO
BE.

LINSEY DAVIS, ABC NEWS,
LANCASTER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA.

THERE WILL BE MORE OF THE
HIDDEN AMISH COMMUNITY TONIGHT
ON "NIGHTLINE."

BE SURE TO WATCH.

STILL AHEAD HERE, A
SURVEILLANCE TAPE WE NEVER
EXPECTED TO SEE.

HERE'S THE WONDERFUL STORY
COMING UP NEXT.

EXPECTED TO SEE.

HERE'S THE WONDERFUL STORY
COMING UP NEXT.

FINALLY TONIGHT THERE IS A
PHOTO OF A PICTURE PERFECT
COUPLE.

YOU MIGHT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE
STORY BEHIND IT, BUT IT IS
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT
SOMEONE WHO IS BRAVE, SOMEONE
WHO IS LIKE SUNLIGHT AND
TOGETHER HOW THEY GAVE A LESSON
TO EVERYONE.

ABC'S JON DONVAN.

WORDS" CATEGORY, WHAT ARE SOME
WORDS THIS ONE CALLS UP?

OF A COUPLE TAKING THE DAY A
PHOTOGRAPHER DROPPED BY FOR A
BUNCH OF FAMILY PHOTOS.

BUT THIS ONE, SPONTANEOUS, THE
PHOTOGRAPHER HAPPENED TO PUT ON
FACEBOOK, AND THEN IT ROCKETED.

AN INTIMATE MOMENT -- SHE HELPS
HIM LIKE THIS A LOT -- THAT WENT
VIRAL BECAUSE OF THE WORDS THAT
WERE NOT SPOKEN.

LIKE THE WORD SERIOUS AS IN
SERIOUS PAIN.

BACK IN AFGHANISTAN JESSE COTTLE
STEPPED ON AN IED, THE AFTER
MATH
OVERHEARD VIA A FELLOW MARINE'S
HELMET CAMERA -- JOINING HIM TO
BACK THEN, 2009, HOME BUT NOT
HOME, AS HIS MOM SAID THEN --
 SHE CAME INTO HIS LIFE WHEN
MANY WOULD LOOK AWAY.

KELLY BECAME HIS WIFE WHEN THE
TRUTH IS MANY WOULD BACK AWAY.

WHEN SHE LOOKS AT JESSE --
 HIS PERSONALITY AND THE WAY
HE IS OUTWEIGHS HIS INJURIES BY
SO MUCH THAT YOU SORT OF FORGET
ABOUT IT AFTER A WHILE.

STRENGTH, THE PURE PHYSICAL KIND
IT TAKES TO DO THIS, HER BACK,
HER ARMS.

THESE WIVES NEED THAT KIND OF
STRENGTH AND THE OTHER KIND.

HER INTERNAL STRENGTH IS
PROBABLY EVEN GREATER AND
SOMETHING I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR
GRATIFYING FOR IT IS FOR THE
REST OF US WHO DO NOT KNOW THE
WAR WOUNDED THAT THESE TWO GAVE
US A STORY OF THE TRUTH OF THE
LOSS HE GAVE TO US THAT SAYS
WITHOUT WORDS THAT THERE IS A
WAY BACK HOME.

JON DONVAN, ABC NEWS,
WASHINGTON.

WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
WATCHING TONIGHT.

WE'RE ALWAYS THERE AT
ABCNEWS.COM, "NIGHTLINE" LATER
AND I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN RIGHT
BACK HERE TOMORROW NIGHT.
