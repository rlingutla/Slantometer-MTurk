MEANWHILE, INVESTIGATORS HERE
IN NEWTOWN ARE TRYING TO PIECE
IT ALTOGETHER.

THEY FOUND MORE INFORMATION ON
THE SHOOTER, BUT STILL NO
MOTIVATE.

WE GET MORE NOW FROM CNN
NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT SUSAN
CANDIOTTI FOLLOWING THE
INVESTIGATION.

LEARNING MORE EACH DAY THAT MAY
EXPLAIN WHAT LED 20-YEAR-OLD AID
DAM LANZA TO LAUNCH A VICIOUS
ATTACK ON YOUNG CHILDREN AND
ADULTS AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

OUR INVESTIGATORS AT THE
CRIME SCENE, THE SCHOOL, AND
SECONDARILY AT THE SECONDARY
CRIME SCENE THAT WE DISCUSSED
WHERE THE FEMALE WAS LOCATED
DECEASED DID PRODUCE SOME VERY
GOOD EVIDENCE IN THIS
INVESTIGATION THAT OUR
INVESTIGATORS WILL BE ABLE TO
USE AND HOPEFULLY PAINT A
COMPLETE PICTURE AS TO HOW AND
MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY THIS
OCCURRED.

POLICE WON'T SAY WHAT THE
EVIDENCE IS.

HOWEVER, INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN
CHECKING OUT GUN RANGES AND
SPORTING GOODS STORES.

THEY FOLLOWED A LEAD THE SHOOTER
TRIED TO BUY A GUN TUESDAY AT
THIS LOCATION.

AFTER SEARCHING STORE
SURVEILLANCE VIDEOS, THE TIP
DIDN'T PAN OUT.

TO DATE ATF HAD NOT UNCOVERED
ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD
SUBSTANTIATE THE FACT HE TRIED
TO ACQUIRE GUNS RECENTLY.

WE'RE OUT THERE ACTIVELY
INVESTIGATING.

ALSO SAID THEY RECOVERED WEAPONS
AT THE HOME THE SHOOTER SHARED
WITH HIS MOTHER.

SOURCES SAY THREE MORE GUNS WERE
FOUND.
