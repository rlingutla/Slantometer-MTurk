WEST COAST WHERE LOTS OF ACTION
IS UNFOLDING.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING THIS
HOUR ABOUT THE FUTURE OF
AMERICAN WORKERS.

THIS COMES AFTER THE PRESIDENT
ANNOUNCES A NEW TRAVEL BAN.

IT IS FIRST TWO EFFORTS HAD
LEGAL CATS, BUT THIS THE THIRD
TIME MAY JUST BE THE CHARM FOR
THE PRESIDENT.

REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE TAKEN
ANOTHER TRY AT CHANGING
OBAMACARE.

THEIR DEADLINE IS THIS WEEK, AND
A COUPLE OF KEY COLLEAGUES SAY
THEY ARE NOT ON BOARD.

WE WILL SEE WHO WILL NEED TO
CHANGE THEIR MIND AND WILL THE
PLAN WERE?

WILL GIVE YOU PUERTO RICO, WILL
AMERICANS NEED HELP AFTER A
TERRIBLE HURRICANE.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FOOD, GAS AND
THE CLEANUP EFFORT THAT COULD BE
MEASURED IN MONTHS.

LET'S GET TO IT.

BREAKING NEWS.

"SHEPARD SMITH REPORTING" LIVE
FROM THE FOX NEWS DESK.

OUT FOR REPUBLICANS TO GET
SOMETHING DONE BEFORE THEY BRING
IN DEMOCRATS OR MORE
REALISTICALLY, MOVE ON.

CAP A HELL RIGHT NOW ON
HEALTH CARE ALSO PROTESTS OVER
THE REPUBLICAN PLAN AND SOME
PROTESTERS BEING DRAGGED OUT OF
THE HEARING.

THE WHITE HOUSE, PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS TO SPEAK AT ANY TIME NOW ON
JOBS, BUT WE ARE ALSO WATCHING
TO SEE THE PRESIDENT CONTINUE TO
PUT THE PRESSURE ON HIS OWN
PARTY.

IN HOPES OF AVOIDING ANOTHER
FAILURE ON HEALTH CARE.

SENATE REPUBLICAN YESTERDAY
ADDED MORE MONEY AND USED
RESTRICTIONS AS PART OF THE BILL
KNOWN AS GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL.

THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL GO
TO STATES LIKE ALASKA, ARIZONA,
KENTUCKY, MAINE, AND TEXAS.

ALL OF THOSE ARE STATES, THAT
HAVE A SENATOR THAT SAID HE OR
SHE IS VOTING NO, OR NOT RIGHT
NOW, OR HAS NOT YET COMMITTED.

WE REPORTED, SO REPUBLICANS CAN
AFFORD TO ONLY LOSE TWO VOTES IN
PASSIVE
IF NOTHING CHANGES, IT IS DEAD
ON ARRIVAL.

ARE AGAINST.

TED CRUZ OF TEXAS SAID, HE IS
OUT KNOW AT THIS MOMENT.

SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS AND MIKE
LEE ARE LEANING NO, AND LISA
MAKOWSKI IS PUBLICLY UNDECIDED
JOHN ROBERTS IS A LIFE OR IS
THERE THIS AFTERNOON AND IN
SPITE THE NOTE COUNTS, THE
WHITE HOUSE IS PUSHING FOR A
VOTE.

THEY ARE PUSHING.

THEY ARE TRY TO GET 50 VOTES
BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK, AS
YOU MENTION.

THEREFORE, MAYBE SIX HOLDOUTS.

YOU LISA MURKOWSKI,
MAINE, WAITING FOR THE CBO SCORE
TO COME OUT IN THE NEXT HOUR OR
SO.

RAND PAUL IS AGAINST THIS,
POSSIBLY TED CRUZ AND MIKE LEE
AS WELL.

TWEAKS TO THE PLAN THAT WOULD
GIVE MORE MONEY TO EAT CERTAIN
STATES THE PRESIDENT TWEETING
FROM
ALASKA, ARIZONA, MAINE,
KENTUCKY, OUR BIG IN HEALTH CARE
OF, SEVEN YEARS OF REPEAL AND
REPLACE, SOME SENATORS NOT THER
THERE.

SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS TOLD US
AT A BRIEFING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
THEY ARE PULLING OUT ALL THE
STOPS TO TRY TO GET THIS THING
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

LISTEN HERE.

WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A
VOTE, WE SURE HOPE SO.

WE'VE BEEN CALLING ON CONGRESS
TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO
DO.

CERTAINLY WHAT MOST OF THEM HAVE
CAMPAIGNED ON, AND THAT IS TO
REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.

WE ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH
FORWARD.

WE KNOW WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THE
OBAMACARE STATUS QUO.

THE PRESIDENT ALSO TAKING
WOODSHED AFTER HE SAID
DEFINITIVELY THAT HE IS AGAINST
THE GRAHAM-CASSIDY BILL.

LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID ON THE
"RICK AND BUBBA SHOW."

YOU LOOK AT WHAT
TREMENDOUS SLAP IN THE FACE OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

TREMENDOUS.

HE WAS GOOD TO GO ALL WEEK LONG,
ALL MONTH LONG, HE WAS GOOD TO
GO, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THUMBS
DOWN.

YOU CAN CALL WHAT YOU WANT THAT
WAS A -- THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WE DO NOT HAVE IT, BECAUSE OF
 THE PRESENT CONTINUING TO PUT
THAT
NEVER INTENTION TO VOTE FOR THE
BILL, WHICH IS GOVERNOR LOVES.

LET ARIZONA DOWN AND THEN'S WENT
ON TO SAY, DEMOCRATS ARE
LAUGHINGLY SAME, A MOMENT OF
COURAGE.

TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF
ARIZONA WHO RECEIVED 100%
INCREASE.

THE PRESENT IS TALK ABOUT THE
HEALTH CARE COSTS.

THE NUCLEAR CRISIS WITH
NORTH KOREA LIKE NOTHING WE HAVE
SEEN SINCE THE COLD WAR.

THERE'S CLEANUP AND RECOVERY IN
PUERTO RICO, AND IN TEXAS, AND
OF FLORIDA, AND A LONG, LONG
LIST COMING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
KEEPS TWEETING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

YES, AND THIS STARTED ON
FRIDAY NIGHT, SHEP, WHEN HE WAS
DOWN IN ALABAMA AT A RALLY FOR
SENATOR LUTHER STRANGE, WHO IS
IN THE FIGHT OF HIS LIFE.

AND TOMORROW NIGHT'S PRIMARY.

THE PRESIDENT ZEROING IN ON
RESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN FLAG
AND GOING ON TO SAY, HE WISHES
THE SUM OF THESE NFL OWNERS, ANY
TIME THE PLAYER TAKES A KNEE
DURING A NATIONAL ANTHEM, WOULD
TELL THOSE SOBS THAT THEY ARE
FIRED.

I ASKED SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS
ABOUT THE COMMENTS, WHETHER THEY
WERE TOO STRIDENT AT THE
BRIEFING A SHORT TIME AGO, GIVEN
THE REACTION THAT THEY PROVOKED
OVER THE WEEKEND.

LET'S LISTEN TO THAT EXCHANGE.

DID THE PRESIDENT GO TOO FAR?

I THINK IT IS ALWAYS
APPROPRIATE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITES STATES TO DEFEND OUR
FLAG, DEFEND THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND TO DEFEND
THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT AND
DIED TO DEFEND A.

AS HE SAID OVER THE WEEKEND,
SOME 200 PLAYERS OUT OF 1600
EITHER TOOK A KNEE AT THE
VARIOUS GAME OR IN THE CASE OF
THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS,
SEATTLE SEAHAWKS, AND ONE OTHER
TEAM, AND ACTUALLY STAYED INSIDE
THE LOCKER ROOM RATHER THAN
COMING OUT.

FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

ONE NOTABLE EXCEPTION, ALEJANDRO
VILLANUEVA FOR THE PITTSBURGH
STEELERS, WHO DID THREE TOURS OF
DUTY AS AN ARMY RANGER IN
AFGHANISTAN HE WAS THE LONE
PLAYER DURING THAT GAME TO COME
OUT OF THE TUNNEL PUT HIS HAND
OVER HIS HEART AND STAND FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

ROGER THE NFL COMMISSIONER SAID,
THE FRUSTRATION OVER THE VICE OF
RHETORIC THAT WE HEARD FROM
TRUMP.

TOM BRADY, THAT PATRIOT ON THE
RADIO CALLED THE PRESIDENT'S
COMMENTS DIVISIVE AND SAID, HE
DID NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THE
PRESIDENT SAID.

AND NOW NASCAR IS WEIGHING IN ON
ALL OF IT.

OFFICIAL STATEMENTS INCOME IN
SPORTS ARE UNIFYING INFLUENCE IN
OUR SOCIETY, PUTTING PEOPLE OF
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND
BELIEFS TOGETHER.

I RESPECT FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A HALLMARK OF OUR PRERACE
EVENTS.

THANKS TO THE SACRIFICES OF
MANY, WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY OF
UNPARALLELED FREEDOMS AND CALLUS
LIBERTIES, INCLUDING THE RIGHT
TO PEACEFULLY EXPRESS ONE'S
OPINION.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT TEAM OWNER
SAID HE WANTED HIS TEAM MEMBERS
TO STAND UP FOR THE
NATIONAL ANTHEM, DALE
EARNHARDT JR. TWEETED, ALL
AMERICANS ARE GRANTED RIGHTS TO
PEACEFUL PROTESTS.

THOSE WHO MAKE PEACEFUL
REVOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE WILL MAKE
VIOLENT REVOLUTION INEVITABLE.

THE TOP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED
A NEW BAN, BUT IT'S CLIMATE
NOTHING MORE THAN WINDOW
DRESSING ON MUSLIMS.

HIS TEMPER A BAND ON TRAVELERS
ELECTED TO EXPIRE.

FROM SIX MAJORITY MUSLIM NATIONS
FROM ENTERING UNLESS THEY HAD A
SOUL CARD SO-CALLED BONA FIDE
RELATIONSHIP HERE IN THE U.S.
NOW, SUDAN IS FINE, AND OFF THE
LIST.

IT'S NEIGHBOR CHAD IS NOW ON THE
LIST, AND VENEZUELA.

ALTHOUGH THE RESTRICTIONS APPLY
ONLY TO A GROUP OF GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

THE CHANGES TAKE EFFECT ON
OCTOBER THE 18TH.

THE HOME UNSECURED OFFICIALS SAY
THE EIGHT NATIONS EITHER FAILED
TO SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH
THE UNITED STATES OR DID NOT
TAKE ENOUGH SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
IN MAKING THE ANNOUNCEMENT.

PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS IS ALL
ABOUT SECURITY.

THE PRESIDENT TWEETING, MAKING
AMERICA SAFE IS MY NUMBER ONE
PRIORITY.

WE WILL NOT ADMIT THOSE INTO OUR
COUNTRY THAT YOU CANNOT SAFELY
BET.

NEW TODAY, THE SUPREME COURT
CANCELED ARGUMENTS FOR NEXT
MONTH WITH HIS OLD TROUBLE BAND
AFTER HE ANNOUNCED NEW
RESTRICTIONS, CIVIL RIGHTS
GROUPS SAY THE NEW BAN ISN'T
COVERED, NORTH KOREA AND
VENEZUELA ON THE LIST, THE STILL
AMOUNT TO A MUSLIM BAN.

SIX OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
TARGETED COUNTRIES ARE MUSLIM,
THE FACT THAT TRUMP HAS ADDED
NORTH KOREA, WITH FEW VISITORS,
AND
AND A FEW GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS
FROM VENEZUELA, IS DOES NOT
CONCEAL THE REAL FACT THAT IT IS
STILL A MUSLIM BAN.

PRESIDENT TRUMP ORIGINAL STANCE
CANNOT BE CURED BY THROWING
OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE ENEMY
LIST.

BACK TO JOHN ROBERTS AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.

JOHN?

THE PRESIDENT, SHEP, BELIEVE
THAT BY MODIFYING THE TRAVEL
BAN, IT WILL PASS MUSTER IN THE
COURTS.

YOU BET THEIR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE
THE ACL YOU, WILL GO TO TRY TO
GET STOPPED AS WELL.

THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THAT BY
WRITING THESE OUT TO INCLUDE
CHAD AND NORTH KOREA INSERTED
OFFICIALS FROM VENEZUELA, A GETS
THEM OUT OF THAT IDEA THAT SO
MANY PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT.

YOU READ THAT STATEMENT FROM THE
ACLU, THIS IS SIMPLY MUSLIM BAN,
IT'S HOPEFULLY ONE THAT CAN
MUSTER IN THE COURTS, BECAUSE
THE RESTRICTIONS ARE TAILORED TO
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.

CERTAINLY, THE WATERFALL OF
CRITICISM CONTINUES TO BE AIMED
AT THE PRESIDENT WHETHER IT IS
ON CAPITOL HILL WITH THE
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FROM
CIVIL LIBERTARIAN GROUPS, YOU
WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS IN
THE COMING DAYS, SHEP, DESPITE
THE FACT THAT THE SUPREME COURT
PUT ON HOLD THE HEARINGS THAT
WERE SCHEDULED FOR THE TENTH
SAYING, WITH THE NEW TROUBLE
BAND IN PLACE, THOSE HEARINGS
THE WHITE HOUSE.

LET'S GO TO JAIL, REPORTER WITH
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HEALTH CARE.

THAT OVER OR NOT?

THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT
THINGS GOING ON WITH THE
WHITE HOUSE.

THEY ARE PLANNING A NEW TAX
REFORM PLAN THIS WEEK AS WELL.

THEY ARE ASPIRING TO MULTIPLE
DIFFERENT FRONTS RIGHT NOW.

HEALTH CARE, IT STILL SEEMS
THEY'RE CROSSING THE FINGERS
REALLY, REALLY HOPING THAT
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PULL A COUPLE
OF SENATORS OVER THE LINE AND
SAY THIS BILL.

EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS
ACKNOWLEDGED HIS COMMENTS THAT
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN THIS TIME
AROUND.

MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE
PULLOVER AS YOU DESCRIBED?

WE WILL HAVE TO SEE A REPORT
SAYS TODAY, BUT IT IS NOT
LOOKING GOOD.

VIEWERS, THE REPORT WILL BE A
FULL REPORT.

THEY'LL BE SOME GUIDANCE, IT
WILL GET SOMETHING FROM THAT
INHERE FROM THOSE ON
CAPITOL HILL AS A RESULT.

ON THESE OTHER MATTERS, JILL,
LOTS OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT
FOOTBALL, BUT I WOULD RATHER
STICK TO THE REAL ISSUES AT
HAND.

THE NORTH KOREA BACK AND FORTH
REGARDING NUCLEAR WAR, IT SOUNDS
LIKE THE NORTH KOREANS ARE NOW
THREATENING -- THEY ARE
THREATENING TO SHOOT DOWN OUR
JETS IN THAT REGION.

THE WHITE HOUSE -- THEY PLAN TO
SEE MORE ON THIS?

IS ESCALATING TO A POINT THAT
AMERICANS NEVER HAVE SEEN.

YET THE FOR MR. SAINT TODAY THAT
THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS OVER
WEEKEND HAS COME IS A THREAT OF
WAR AND SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS
SAINT, WE ARE NOT THREATENING
WAR.

WE WILL NOT GO TO WAR WITH KORE
KOREA.

THE PLAN RIGHT NOW NONETHELESS,
THESE ARE VERY SCARY WORDS
COMING FROM PERSONALITIES, WHO
REALLY SEEM TO BE ESCALATING THE
RHETORIC AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.

SPIEL WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS SORT
OF
THING SINCE THE COLD WAR, AND I
WONDER IF THERE ARE MEETINGS OR
DISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY TO TRY TO
CAMPED ON THE RHETORIC AND ALL
THOSE WITH IT, BECAUSE OUR
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY REALLY
WANT IS TO GET TO THE TABLE AND
TALK ABOUT THIS.

SPEAK OUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME
CONVERSATIONS THROUGH
INTERMEDIARIES TAKING PLACE.

PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS
ESCALATING RHETORIC FROM THE
PRESIDENT'S TWEETS, ESPECIALLY
THOSE THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY
GOING AFTER KIM JONG UN
PERSONALLY AND CREATING A
PERSONAL WAR BETWEEN THESE TWO
MEN, WHO ARE VERY MUCH
INTERESTED IN STICKING TO THEIR
HEELS.

AS ONE OF THE SITUATIONS, WHERE
THEY ARE VERY FEW GOOD OPTIONS,
AND THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN
THINKING AND CONSIDERING WHAT
THEIR OPTIONS ARE INCLUDING
MILITARY OPTIONS.

TRAVEL BAN, IS A TRAVEL BAN --
WILL GO THROUGH NOW OR IS THERE
MORE TO COME?

WE HAVE TROUBLE BAND 1.0,
2.0, THIS IS 3.0 THAT HE SIGNED
ONE DAY.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT, ESPECIALLY
FROM THE FIRST ONE THAT THEY
PUSH THROUGH JANUARY, IS REALLY
THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE HHS
AND STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE SPENT
COMING UP WITH A STANDARD THAT
THEY USE TO PICK WHICH COUNTRY
WOULD BE IMPLEMENT IT, IMPACTED.

THERE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT
POTENTIAL LEGAL CHALLENGES, AND
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THIS FOR
MONTHS AND MONTHS GOING THROUGH
ALL OF WHAT THEY THINK ARE THE
REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY WANT FROM
COUNTRIES.

AS PEOPLE COME TO THE
UNITED STATES, THINGS LIKE
WHETHER THOSE COUNTRIES GIVE
THEIR CITIZENS PASSPORTS.

WHETHER THEY REPORTED STOLEN AND
COUNTERFEIT PASSPORTS TO
INTERPOL.

WHETHER THEY SHARE INFORMATION
WITH THE U.S. ABOUT TERRORIST
LINKS.

THE U.S.

PUT TOGETHER THAT SET
OF BENCHMARKS, WENT THROUGH
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IT'S
A COME HERE THEY ARE.

YOU COMPLY AND COME TO OUR
COUNTRY, OR YOU DO NOT COMPLY,
AND YOU WILL HAVE RESTRICTIONS
PLACED ON YOU.

THE GOVERNMENT SAID, THESE EIGHT
COUNTRIES OF THE EIGHT COUNTRIES
THAT DO NOT LIVE UP TO THOSE
REQUIREMENTS.

REPORTER FOR THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS.

HIS THE REPEAL OF OBAMACARE
DEAD?

NOT IF REPUBLICANS CAN HELP IT.

HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO GET ON
BOARD WITH THE HEALTH CARE PLAN.

THAT'S COMING UP AT THE FOX NEWS
DECK ON THIS MONDAY.

♪
SPILL IT MORE NOW ON REPUBLICANS
PUSH TO CHANGE OBAMACARE.

THE PARTY FACING AN UPHILL
BATTLE IS IN SOME OF ITS OWN IT
CENTERS HAVE COME OUT AGAINST
THE GRAHAM CASSIDY PROPOSAL.

REPUBLICANS CONTROL THE SENATE.

52-48, AS REPORTED, THEY CAN
LOSE BUT TO SENATORS IN ORDER TO
BE SUCCESSFUL SINCE ALL
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WILL VOTE NO.

UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES, IT
DOES NOT LOOK GOOD FOR THE
G.O.P.

'S LATEST EFFORT.

MIKE EMANUEL IS LIVE ON
CAPITOL HILL WITHOUT SENATE
FINANCE COMMITTEE IS HOLDING A
HEARING.

MIKE, WHAT IT'S LIKE THERE, AND
HOW WERE THEY TRYING TO GET
SENATORS TO CHANGE THEIR MIND?

SHEP, THEY OFFERED SWEETENERS
OVER THE WEEKEND, MORE SPENDING
TO STATES LIKE ALASKA AND MAINE,
HOPING THEY GET THEM ON BOARD.

GOOD OLD-FASHIONED LEGISLATION
TO GET YES VOTES.

BOTTOM LINE IN THE HALLWAY HERE
OUTSIDE THE COMMITTEE, IT IS
REALLY, REALLY LOUD.

YOU CAN SEE IS PICKING UP A BIT
RIGHT NOW.

ALL THE DISRUPTION HERE, PEOPLE
EXPRESSING THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT.

THE CHAIRMAN MAKING THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT.

IF THE HEARING IS GOING TO
INVOLVE INTO A SIDESHOW OR A
FORUM SIMPLY FOR PUTTING PARSON
POINTS ON THE BOARD, THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR US TO
BE HERE.

I AM SAYING THIS TO THE BENEFIT
OF MY COLLEAGUES.

LET'S HAVE A CIVIL DISCUSSION.

HE REPUBLICANS CLEARLY
LOOKING TO HAVE THIS HEARING
THIS WEEK ON A CRITICAL WEEK FOR
HIS HEALTH CARE REFORM PUSH BY
REPUBLICANS.

IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW FAR IT WILL
GO, BUT THEY'RE GIVING IT THEIR
BEST SHOT.

BOTTOM LINE, THEY'RE TRYING TO
GET THE 58 REPUBLICAN YESES
WHICH FEELS A LOT LIKE JULY,
WHEN THEY KEPT SAYING THEY WERE
GETTING CLOSE, BUT NEVER DID
QUITE GET THERE, SHEP.

GIVE 50 REPUBLICANS, DELECTABLE
AND DEMOCRATS, AND I ASSUME THEY
MAY AS WELL FORGET THAT
 FORGIVE ME.

I'M HAVING TROUBLE HEARING.

IN TERMS OF THE DEMOCRAT SIDE OF
THINGS, WE JUST TALK TO HAWAII
SENATOR, WHO FELT GOOD ABOUT
THINGS, BUT SAID IT IS NOT OVER
TILL IT IS OVER.

UNTIL THESE FILLED BY ME, KEEP
FIGHTING.

ANOTHER KEY DEMOCRAT SAID REJECT
THIS EFFORT BY THE PUBLICANS.

NOBODY HAS GOT TO BUY A LEMON
JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE LAST CAR
ON THE LOT.

THIS TRUMP CARE BILL IS A
HEALTH CARE LEMON.

A DISASTER IN THE MAKING.

AT THE START OF A VERY
EMOTIONAL WEEK.

A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH
DISABILITIES ARE HERE TODAY
ALONG WITH ACTIVISM PROTESTERS.

SENATORS GETTING AN EAR FULL
FROM FOLKS AS THEY WORK ON
HEALTH CARE.

SAYING, HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN
RIGHT.

HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON ALL DAY.

MIKE, HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON ALL
DAY?

DESCRIBED FOR US.

I AM SORRY, SHEP.

IT IS HARD TO HEAR.

THERE WERE LINED UP HERE ALL
DAY.

THEY REALLY GOT LOUD AROUND 200
OR SO, WHEN SENATORS WERE GOING
IN TO THE VERY ROOM FOR THIS
HEARING.

IT DIED DOWN A LITTLE BIT WHEN
SOME WERE ARRESTED, DISPERSED BY
CAPITOL POLICE.

THEY ARE FIRING UP AGAIN,
PERHAPS WITH THE SENATORS IN THE
HALLWAY OR JUST WANTING TO
EXPRESS THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT
RIGHT OF A SHEP.

THE WHOLE OF CONGRESS, THANK YO
THANK YOU.

BRACING FOR THE HEALTH CARE
EFFORTS TO FAIL.

THAT IS A WORD FROM OUR NEXT
GUEST, WHO SAID, THERE IS VERY
SIMPLE REASON THIS BILL CANNOT
PASS.

WHAT IS THAT REASON?

SHE WILL HAVE IT FOR US NEXT.

THIS NEW HEALTH CARE BILL,
BAILEY YOU WANT TO CRUSH
OBAMACARE AND GET RID OF
IT, HOW DO YOU GET ENOUGH
SENATORS ON BOARD TO MAKE IT
HAPPEN?

WHAT DO YOU DO?

THE SEARCH TO A CONGRESSIONAL
REPORTER FOR "POLTICO."

THEY ARE TRYING, WHAT CAN THEY
DO, RACHEL?

SPEAK OUT NOT MUCH MORE
THERE BRACING FOR FAILURE RIGHT
NOW.

THAT IS BECAUSE ON THE ONE SITE,
HAVE CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT TO
TAKE THIS BILL TO THE RIGHT.

TED CRUZ, RAND PAUL, WANTING
LESS REGULATION, BUT THEN YOU
LOSE PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS
PAIRED PEOPLE RELYING ON
MEDICAID ARE VULNERABLE, AND YOU
HAVE A LOT OF MODERATES WHO ARE
HOLDING OUT AND WORRIED ABOUT
SUPPORTING, BECAUSE I THINK IT
WILL HURT PEOPLE WHO RELY ON
THESE PROGRAMS.

TO ADD ON TOP, THE PROTEST THAT
WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW, I JUST
DON'T SEE SUSAN COLLINS,
SAYING THEY WILL BACK THIS.

A LOT OF MY REPUBLICANS
COLLEAGUE SOURCES ARE SAYING,
THIS WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE.

THINK THAT THIS TIME WOULD BE
DIFFERENT?

WHY BRING THIS UP AGAIN TO WHAT
APPEARS AT LEAST FOR NOW TO BE A
FAILURE, IF YOU DID NOT HAVE
SOMETHING TO PLACATE THOSE WHO
ARE VOTING NO?

I THINK TWO THINGS.

THE TIME ISSUE.

RIGHT NOW, REPUBLICANS ONLY HAVE
UNTIL THE END OF THE WEEK TO
PASS AN OBAMACARE REPEAL.

ONCE WE HIT SATURDAY, THEY
CANNOT DO THIS ANYMORE, BECAUSE
THEY LOSE THE ABILITY TO
CIRCUMVENT DEMOCRATS AND BYPASS
THE FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE.

THAT GOES AWAY.

IT DISAPPEARS.

REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING BECAUSE
OF THE TIME PRESSURE, PEOPLE
WOULD FEEL LIKE THEY HAD TO
SUPPORT SOMETHING RIGHT NOW,
EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE
EVERYTHING LEGISLATION LOOK
REPUBLICANS, GRAHAM AND CASSIE,
WERE GOING TO THROW
MORE MONEY AT OPPONENTS.

PUTTING MONEY IN ALASKA, ARIZON
ARIZONA, AND ALSO KENTUCKY
SQUARELY AT SENATORS, WHO ARE
OPPOSED.

THE ISSUE IS, YOU CANNOT BUY
THESE GUYS ARE.

PROCESS.

HE WANTS MORE COMMITTEE
HEARINGS.

ALSO RAND PAUL, HE HATES THE
IDEA OF SENDING MONEY TO THE
STATES.

THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY FEDERAL
HEALTH CARE MONEY.

GET RID OF THAT.

THESE ARE THINGS YOU CANNOT
BRIDGE PEOPLE BY, AND
REPUBLICANS, THE TIME IS
TICKING, AND THEY WANT TO DO
SOMETHING, BUT THEY ARE IN A BAD
SPOT RIGHT NOW.

PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKING ABOUT
NORTH KOREA ON THE ONE HAND AND
RATCHETING THAT UP AND ON THE
OTHER HAND, ALL THE RACISM WITH
THE NFL.

HE HAS NOT BEEN TWEETING ABOUT
HEALTH CARE AT ALL.

DOES HE CARE ABOUT THIS?

WELL, HE CERTAINLY SAYS HE
DOES.

I CAN TELL YOU REPUBLICANS ON
THE HILL ARE VERY UPSET ABOUT
THE FACT THAT HE IS IN A WAR
RIGHT NOW WITH THE NFL.

THEY SAY IT IS A DISTRACTION.

IT THEY COULD REALLY USE HIS
HELP GETTING THIS ACROSS THE
FINISH LINE, AND ANOTHER THING
COMING HERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE A
BIG PUSH ON TAX REFORM.

WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM PUT OUT
A BUNCH OF DETAILS ON TAX
REFORM.

HE WAS GOING TO GO OUT AND
SUPPORT.

LOOK AT THE FRONT PAGE OF THE
PAPERS RIGHT NOW.

WE'RE SEEING SEEING AGAIN, LIKE
YOU SAID, THE SPATS AND THESE
ARE NOT THINGS THAT REPUBLICAN'S
WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

NOT WANT IT, RACHEL, BUT THIS
THING, I READ THE EMAIL.

I HAVE TWITTER, I LET THEM TAKE
CARE OF IT.

IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT FOR HIS
BASE, DISSES THE RED MEAT OF ALL
RED MEAT.

THEY ARE ABLE TO RECLAIM THIS?

THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY, THEY WERE
ATTACKING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM,
ATTACKING THE TROOPS, ATTACKING
THE FLAG.

NONE OF WHICH THEY ARE DOING.

THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.

THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT RACIAL
INJUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY, AND
THEY'RE UPSET ABOUT THE THINGS
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, AND
HE TURNS IT AROUND FOR HIS BASE.

IS THIS ALL A PLAY TO HIS BASE,
AND COULD POSSIBLY BE SO THEY DO
NOT NOTICE, THERE IS NO
HEALTH CARE AND NORTH KOREA IS
THE BIGGEST MESS SINCE THE
COLD WAR?

A DISTRACTION HE WANTS RIGHT
NOW, RIGHT?

A PLACE TO A CORNER OF HIS BASE,
FRACTION.

I'LL TELL YOU I'LL TALK TO A
REPUBLICAN ABOUT THIS COUPLE OF
HOURS AGO.

THEY DO NOT SEE THIS HELPFUL AT
ALL.

THESE PROTESTERS WERE A FEW
PLAYERS COME AND THEY'RE BARELY
GETTING ANY HEADLINES, AND THEN
TRUMP ATTACKS THEM, AND ATTACKED
THE NFL, NEVER SINCE THEN, HE
RATCHETED IT UP SO YOU HAVE 200
PLAYERS TAKING A KNEE OR BACK IN
THE LOCKER ROOM, NOT STANDING
FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, AND IT
IS AN UGLY DISPUTE RIGHT NOW.

PEOPLE IN GENERAL DO NOT LIKE IT
WHEN PEOPLE PROTEST THE
PROTESTING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

IT HAS BECOME MORE ABOUT THE
FLAG, OBVIOUSLY, BECAUSE THE
FOLKS FEEL THE PRESIDENT IS
GOADING BLACK FOOTBALL PLAYERS
AFTER THE CHARLOTTESVILLE
CONTROVERSY A FEW WEEKS LATER.

IT'S BATTLEGROUND FOR
TO SEE YOU FROM "POLTICO."

KEEP IT UP.

MORE ON THE SHOWDOWN WITH
NORTH KOREA AFTER THE
WHITE HOUSE DISMISSES THE CLAIM
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
DECLARED WAR ON NORTH KOREA.

THAT IS COMING UP IN 2 MINUTES
PAIRED WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE
MAN WHO POLICE SAY SHOT PEOPLE
INSIDE A CHURCH IN TENNESSEE.

IN THE USHER WHO RISKED HIS LIFE
TO TAKE DOWN THE GOVERNMENT.

THAT IS STRAIGHTAWAY.

♪
FOX NEWS DECK.

AN USHER SAVED COUNTLESS LIVES
WHEN A GUNMAN OPENED FIRED AT A
CHURCH.

THAT IS THE WORD FROM POLICE AND
NATURAL.

INVESTIGATORS SAY EMANUEL SAMSON
KILLED ONE WOMAN AND SHOT SIX
PEOPLE THE CHURCH, INCLUDING A
PASSER, AND ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
HIMSELF WHEN THE CHURCHES USHER,
A MAN NAMED CALEB ENGLE, IT
CONFRONTED HIM.

THERE IS THE USHER.

IN A STATEMENT, THE REAL HEROES
ARE POLICE AND OTHER
FIRST RESPONDERS SAID CALEB
ENGLE.

SURVIVAL WITH HIS BATTLE AGAINST
BRAIN CANCER.

A VERY POOR PROGNOSIS.

I UNDERSTAND, AND WE WILL DO
WHAT WE CAN.

EDUCATION IS SO IMPORTANT.

AT EVERY LEVEL, WHETHER IT IS

ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS -- DO WHAT
YOU LOVE, STUDY WHAT YOU LOVE.

SOMETHING, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS, BUT TRY
TO FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT YOU
LOVE, WHETHER IT IS STUDIES OR
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF SCHOOL, DO
WHAT YOU LOVE, AND YOU WILL BE
SUCCESSFUL.

WORK HARD.

ALL OF THOSE THINGS, BUT YOU
HAVE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART TO A
CERTAIN EXTENT, AND MAYBE EVEN
TO A LARGER EXTENT.

WHEN YOU GET OUT THERE, DESH IS
VERY INTERESTING AND I SAY THIS
A LOT, DO WHAT YOU LOVE, IF YOU
LOVE IT IT IS NOT WORK.

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

THANK YOU ALL VERY IMPORTANT  M.
SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH
SOME MIGHTY GOOD LITTLE KIDS
ABOUT STEM PROGRAM.

THERE PLAINTIFF SPENT
$200 MILLION FOR CODE AND
COMPUTER SCIENCE.

PUERTO RICO
IS HOME TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
AND CAN RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE
DEVASTATED.

THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF FOOD.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GAS TO GO
AROUND.

PEOPLE THERE ARE GROWING MORE
DESPERATE BY THE HOUR.

WE WILL GO LIVE AND TALK TO
GERALDO RIVERA, WHO IS THERE,
BECAUSE HE HEADED TO THE ISLAND
TO HELP HIS FAMILY.

THAT IS NEXT.

RISK
MUSICAL
NORTH CAROLINA ARE TELLING
PEOPLE TO LEAVE SOME AREAS OF
THE OUTER BANKS AS HURRICANE
MARIA MOVES TOWARD THE AREA.

OFFICIALS HAD MANDATORY
EVACUATION SEVERAL ISLAND
STARTING TODAY.

HERE'S THE LATEST TRACK FOR YOU,
FORECASTERS SAY THEY DO NOT
EXPECT THAT CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE
TO MAKE LANDFALL IN THE
UNITED STATES AT ALL.

IT WILL NOT MAKE LANDFALL THEY
TELL US, BUT THEY SAY IT WILL
CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE
UP AND DOWN THE EAST COAST.

TELLING PEOPLE TO PREPARE FOR
STRONG WINDS, STORM SURGE, AND
SOME FLOODING.

THIS COMES DAYS AFTER THE STORM
SLAMMED PUERTO RICO, LEAVING
BEHIND DESTRUCTION AND I CANNOT
POWER IT TO EVERYBODY THERE.

OF COURSE, THERE'S SO MUCH
STRONGER.

ONE LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY,
HURRICANE MARIA SAID BACK TO
UNITED STATES TERRITORY BY
DECADES, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT
ISLAND THAT IT WAS WEEK AGO.

IMAGES TO SHOW YOU IN A
SLIDESHOW THIS AFTERNOON,
CERTAINLY DIFFERENT ISLAND AND
IT WAS A WEEK AGO.

PEOPLE STANDING OUTSIDE AND AT
SAN JUAN TO LINE UP TO BUY GAS.

REPORTS PEOPLE WAITED HOURS IN
SOME AREAS TO GET A LITTLE BIT.

HERE ARE KIDS FEELING JUGS WITH
FRESH WATER IN A DISTRIBUTION
POINT A LITTLE BIT FARTHER EAST
OF THERE.

EMERGENCY WORKERS DELIVERED MORE
THAN 1 MILLION AND A HALF
GALLONS OF WATER TO THE ISLAND.

THIS IS SAN JUAN.

A WI-FI HOT SPOT.

PEOPLE GETTING SERVICE.

CELL PHONES ARE TOUGH.

WATER FLOWS FROM THE DAM ON THE
NORTHWEST SIDE OF THE ISLAND,
WHERE OFFICIALS TOLD THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE TO EVACUATE.

CONCERNS OF THE DAM WOULD BREAK
AND CAUSE MORE FLOODING.

MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
OFFERING TO HELP THIS WOMAN
EVACUATE AFTER THE GOVERNMENT
OPENED THE GATES OF A DAM NEAR
HER HOME.

GERALDO RIVERA IS IN
PUERTO RICO.

HE IS PUERTO REAGAN HIMSELF AND
HIS LIVE WITH US THIS AFTERNOON.

GERALDO, TELL US HOW IT IS FIRST
AND?

SHEP, LET ME WELCOME YOU TO
PUERTO RICO ISLAND OF DESPAIR.

THE ISLAND GOT RACKED BY
HURRICANE IRMA TWO WEEKS AGO.

THAT HURRICANE ACT OF 17% OF THE
POWER GRID.

THEN CAME THE MUCH MORE SAVAGE,
POWERFUL HURRICANE MARIA, AND
THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY DECIMATED
THIS ISLAND.

IT HAS SCORCHED THE AGRICULTURAL
FIELD OF PUERTO RICO.

80% OF THE CROPS HAD BEEN
DESTROYED.

THERE IS NO ELECTRIC POWER SHEP,
THE POLLS ARE DOWN EVERYWHERE.

THE LARGE CONDUCTIVE POLLS, THE
TELEPHONE POLES, THERE'S VERY
LITTLE COMMUNICATION.

SO SERVICE, EXTREMELY SPOTTY.

THERE IS NO SYMPTOM OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING ON AN ISLAND WITH NO
WATER AND NO FUEL THEN THE LINES
AT THE SERVICE STATIONS.

NOT ONLY EITHER SCORES OF
PEOPLE, YOU LOOK AT THIS LINE IT
GOES ALL THE WAY I'LL COME
AROUND THAT CORNER, AND THIS IS
THE SCENE AT EVERY SINGLE GAS
STATION IN PUERTO RICO.

WITHOUT GAS, THEY CAN'T RUN THE
GENERATORS THAT THE FEW HAVE TWO
POWER THE WATER PUMPS THAT ALLOW
THEM NOT ONLY TO GET WATER TO
BATHE AND DRINK, BUT ALSO TO RUN
THE TOILET.

THIS SITUATION IS AS DIRE AS YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

3.4 MILLION AMERICAN CITIZEN IN
THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATION,
AND IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET
WORSE.

THE MILLION AND A HALF GALLON
ALREADY DELIVERED, A DROP IN THE
BUCKET, IT IS NEEDED.

GERALDO, WITH INTEREST AND A LOT
OF LOVE THERE, ARE THEY GOING TO
NEED AN AIRLIFT OR BOLT LEFT
OUT OF THERE AND TO, OR CAN THEY
GET THIS BACK UP AND RUNNING TO
GET THIS FROM BEING A NECESSITY?

SHEP, THERE HAS BEEN AN
EXODUS FROM PUERTO RICO SINCE
THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.

THIS U.S. COMMONWEALTH IS
BANKRUPT.

MORE THAN A MILLION HAVE LEFT
THE ISLAND.

I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE PEOPLE
FORCED TO LIVE UNDER THE
PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS, THE YOUNG
ONES WILL LEAVE.

WHAT HAPPENS, THE OLD AND FEEBLE
THEY STAY BEHIND, THEN YOU
CANNOT LEAVE.

SCHOOLS ARE CLOSER, BY THE WAY.

BUSINESSES INCREDIBLY DISRUPTED.

OF THE 3.4 MILLION, YOU'LL SEE A
TREMENDOUS EXODUS TO FLORIDA,
NEW YORK STATE, AND LESS THIS
POWER GRID IS RESTORED.

IT WAS IN TERRIBLE SHAPE BEFORE.

IT WAS PLAGUED BY CORRUPTION, BY
INCOMPETENCE, BY SCANDALOUS
DEALINGS WITH PEOPLE PURCHASING
FUEL OIL, PURCHASED THE LOW
WAS GREAT, IT SOLD FOR THE
HIGHEST.

NOW THE GRID IS DESTROYED.

TO BRING AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER IN
AND THEY ARE NOBLE PEOPLE, AND
ARE HELPING, BUT WITH THIS
ISLAND NEEDS IS AN ENTIRE NEW
POWER GRID.

3.4 MILLION PEOPLE, MORE THAN A
MANY STATES IN THE UNION.

I THINK WHAT YOU WILL SEE HERE
IS A.

OF SEVERE DISRUPTION.

THEY ARE SAYING THAT 4-6 MONTHS
BEFORE THEY GET THE POWER GRID
UP AND RUNNING SO PEOPLE WOULD
GENERATORS, THIS WILL BECOME A
SYMBOL OF WHAT THEY BECOME
TODAY.

WIND POWER, THE TURBINES HAVE
BEEN SHREDDED BY THE SUCCESS OF
THE HURRICANES.

THE TOURISM HERE ALSO SHREDDED.

THIS IS AN ISLAND IN CRISIS.

IT IS BECAUSE -- EIGHT HUGE
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

IT IS NOT LIKE THEY ARE ALL
JOINING OR BILLIONS OR COLLAPSE,
BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS A
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.

PEOPLE ARE IN DIRE STRAITS.

THIS WILL BE A MARSHALL PLAN
SCALE REBUILDING OF THE
ELECTRICAL GRID BEFORE YOU CAN
HAVE THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS
WE KNOW IT IN PUERTO RICO.

ARMED GUARDS ON THE GASOLINE.

ONLY LESS THAN A WEEK INTO THIS
CRISIS.

IMAGINE A MONTH FROM NOW OR TWO
MONTHS FROM NOW.

KNOWING NO ONE HAD A HOT SHOWER,
NO ONE CAN FLUSH THE TOILET BUT
FOR THE COSTLY INCLUSION OF A
GALLON OF GAS IN THE COMMODE.

IMAGINE WHAT IS GOING TO BE
LIKE, SHEP.

THERE IS NO OVERSTATING THE
CRISIS HERE, THE PRESIDENT
SHOULD COME.

THE PRESIDENT SHOULD SEE FOR
HIMSELF.

SEND MARCO RUBIO AND HEAD OF
FEMA, THEY ARE HERE TODAY.

THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE
CAME IN WITH THE PLANE.

ALL THOSE GESTURES ARE VERY
IMPORTANT, BUT YOU NEED IT
SYSTEMIC REFORM, WAY TO BAIL
THESE PEOPLE OUT.

IT IS NOT JUST MY FAMILY.

MY FAMILY, GOD KNOWS I LOVE
THEM.

I LIVED IN THE VERY HOUSE WHEN I
WAS A TEENAGER.

THEY ARE HIGH-FUNCTIONING, THEIR
CHILDREN HAVE BECOME DOCTORS.

I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL
HAVE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THE
WATER AND POWER IS NOT RESTORED.

MAYBE THE BRONX IN NEW YORK OR
SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY CAN
LIVE WITH A DECENT LIFE WITHOUT
WHAT IS DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY,
A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS OF MONTA
MONUMENTAL PROPORTIONS.

SPILLED BEST OF LUCK TO YOUR
FAMILY AND THE PEOPLE OF
PUERTO RICO
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

BE SHUTTING DOWN FOR THE DAY AND
JUST ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND 15
SECONDS.

IT HAS BEEN A DOWN DAY.

THE TACK
GOT WALLOPED TODAY, BUT THERE IS
SOME BRIGHT SPOT.

NO CAVUTO CAN ALWAYS FIND HIM.

YOU'LL START LOOKING FOR THEM
WHEN "YOUR WORLD" WITH NEIL
CAVUTO BEGINS RIGHT AFTER THIS
READY FOR A LITTLE FOOTBALL
TONIGHT?

FOUR AND A HALF HOURS FROM
MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, AND IT
COULD BE ONE FOR THE BOOKS.

AT 830 P.M. AND AT GLENDALE,
ARIZONA, THE ARIZONA CARDINALS
ARE TAKING ON JERRY JONES AND
THE DALLAS COWBOYS.

JERRY JONES, OF COURSE, FAMOUS
FOR SAYING, HE LIKES HIS PLAYERS
TO RESPECT THE FLAG, NOT A FAN
OF COLLIN KAEPERNICK LAST WEEK.

SAY TO F THE END, A WEEK AGO
, IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO
ANYTHING THAN UNDER THE FLAG.

THEY'LL BE TESTED TONIGHT.

DOES OF COURSE HAS READ THE RIOT
ACT THAT HIS PLAYERS ALL TOE THE
